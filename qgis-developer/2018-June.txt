Hi all,

To fix this issue, you have to add HOME environmental variable to a 
directory in which the directory .qgis2 is writable for the user used by 
QGIS Server, with Apache2, it's www-data.

For exemple, do these commands:
```
mkdir /srv/qgis/.qgis2
chown www-data:www-data /srv/qgis/.qgis2
chmod 774 /srv/qgis/.qgis2
```

And add this in your apache virtual host:
```
FcgidInitialEnv HOME "/srv/qgis"
```

The documentation probably needs to be updated.

Regards,
René-Luc

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsFeatureRequest SortByOrder
Message-ID: <005a01d3f9c3$d3b1cc20$7b156460$@com.br>

Can anyone help me how to iterate through features using a Field as a sort order?

 

I saw that there is a function  <https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureRequest.html#ad9c11d4c88185fcfb0a54f8703699717> setOrderBy on QgsFeatureRequest, by it seems to request a OrderBy Class argument, but I could not get how to use it.

 

Simple example:

"

lyr = iface.activeLayer()

prov = lyr.dataProvider()

for feature in prov.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest()):

    print feature.id()

"

 

Thank you

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Crash with QgsAuthManager() in 3.x
Message-ID: <751d7895-ea8f-0755-ba34-9ebe964c5246@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Coding a plugin which has to retrieve json from some services with Basis
Authentication I thought to use QgsAuthManager etc... Both to hold
username/password AND the service url, so users decide by choosing the
right profile which service url/username/password to use.

Created a small ui for it QgsAuthConfigSelect(), and used something like:

auth_man = QgsAuthManager()
uri = auth_man.availableAuthMethodConfigs()[conf_id].uri()

To search for a uri of a selected config..

BUT every time QGIS crashes.

To me it looks like QgsAuthManager() should(!) be a singleton, but
isn't. And QGIS crashes in the destructing of the QgsAuthManager...

Can somebody confirm? I'll create a ticket.

Easy test?
1) Start QGIS3/master
2) open python console
3) type 'QgsAuthManager()' and ENTER
4) do this again (and sometimes again)
5) if you still do not have a crash: stop QGIS: will stop with the
following (both on Linux and Windows):

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Crash at application termination on Linux
Message-ID: <3173700.9Wf0inAqjn@even-i700>

Hi,

wondering if I'm the only one in that case, but I get systematic crashes on QGIS exit on Ubuntu 16.04, with master or 2.18 branch
This is super annoying conceptually, and on practice as well since on master, gdb gets automatically attached to the process, which is slow.

When running under Valgrind, this is typically due to things like the following [1], but this is just an extract of
a long list of errors.
There are as many occurences of this as there are static variables using QT data types in QGIS code base.
I experimented changing a few of them, by changing to static pointers instead, and not as static members, and
with explicit cleanup() function to reclaim the memory explicitly from QgsApplication::exitQgis().
This works, but this is super tedious, and I'm wondering if I'm not missing something obvious.

Like if libqgis_core would be deinitialized after libQTCore.

Do other people experiment that issue as well ?

Hi

Just a small fix to an error in my last message, the QGIS Developer Meeting in Zanzibar is 22 - 26 of August as per the event wiki page and not the 20-24 August as stated in the message below.

Regards

Tim

The docs need fixing here (I'll do that). You shouldn't be creating
your own auth manager, but instead use the manager returned by

I personally haven't seen this on any of the platforms I build on
(which includes Fedora, Ubuntu 18.04, and Windows), but can understand
it would make bug fixing super annoying.

I wonder if using Q_GLOBAL_STATIC would be a good fix here?

Eureka! I finally found what's wrong. I had an old version of the  
output/lib/qgis/plugins/libqgisgrass7.so.2.99.0 alongside its more .so.3.1.0 variant
and both were loaded. And that same for my 2.18 build with all the 2.18.x micro versions.

Apart from remembering to do a clean to avoid that, a potential fix would be to change
QgsPluginRegistry::restoreSessionPlugins() to use a "*.so" filter instead of the "*.so*" one (consistently
with the filter of gsProviderRegistry::init()). That would work
since there's a libqgisgrass7.so symlink to the most recent libqgisgrass7.so.X.Y.Z file.

OK, so no longer crash at exit. There's still something fishy, but this one looks
like a real bug.

Ah, Thanks Nyall: works!! :-)

About docs: I had a look into the pyqgis docs:

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Auth/QgsAuthManager.html

But the code is very thin on comments/docs a thin code either:

https://qgis.org/api/qgsauthmanager_8h_source.html

https://qgis.org/api/qgsauthmanager_8cpp_source.html

Is the plan to update the cookbook?

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/authentication.html

Or do we prefer to update docs in code so it will show up in api docs?
I can help with the cookbook, though I'm not very much up to date with
specific changes, but I can at least check things there and writup what
I do now.

Regards & thanks again,

Richard

hi

in the PDAL ml, there is a discussion about if to remove pdal packaging
from osgeo4w. This can affect QGIS especially regarding future 3d rendering
capabilities on point cloud data (and especially analisys)
This is a discussion regarding integration using OSGeo4W env instead of a
"defacto" standard as the conda packaging system.
Any technical opinion would be welcome in the PDAL list.

My first thoughts (as someone not acquainted with conda): this seems
interesting, maybe it will avoid some of the shortcomings of osgeo4w.

And then I checked and they are stuck on Qt 5.6 (recognised by some
QGIS developers to be the WORST release in recent Qt history). And
then I come across this thread:
https://github.com/conda-forge/qt-feedstock/issues/53.

Conclusion: it's like someone took the worst parts of homebrew and
magnified them! There's no way this is a viable alternative for us to
rely on.

	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-PxsxTLEFS3xP4A6MSYyNEUZ=0AveMF_oBSFLFKcaoLpFH9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is my report for Week 3 (May 28 - June 3):

*What did you get done this week?*

   - I was almost working on the improvement of the library for parsing
   description files for QGIS Processing plugin. (1)
   - I test creating of GUI from descriptions.

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Final Python library for parsing descriptions.
   - Split GRASS module parameters in Processing plugin to basic and
   advanced tabs.

*Are you blocked on anything?*

   - I have some questions about different ways in QGIS and GRASS, I will
   discuss them with my mentors.

The wiki page can be found in [2].

Hi Jorge,

There are two possibilities, one is to use the full-blown API with
OrderBy class etc. And then there is a shorthand for this, called
QgsFeatureRequest.addOrderBy which is enough in 90% of the cases.

Short version:

  request = QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.addOrderBy('field_name')

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Feature/QgsFeatureRequest.html#qgis.core.QgsFeatureRequest.addOrderBy

Long version:

  clause = QgsFeatureRequest.OrderByClause('field_name')
  orderBy = QgsFeatureRequest.OrderBy([clause])
  request = QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.setOrderBy(orderBy)

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Feature/QgsFeatureRequest.html#qgis.core.QgsFeatureRequest.setOrderBy

Regards Matthias

Hi devs,

the last news says that Microsoft will acquire the Github Platform.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/microsoft-is-said-to-have-agreed-to-acquire-coding-site-github?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google

https://itsfoss.com/microsoft-github/

Sorry i can't find the discussion about migration from github to gitlab.

João Gaspar

What's the issue? It's still just a closed source site run by a
commercial organisation... nothing has changed from the perspective of
the QGIS project!

If the service turns to crap in the next 12 months then we could
re-evaluate, but I honestly don't see that happening.

Hi Joāo

Please see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingMadeira2018#moving-the-qgis-bug-tracker-away-from-redmine

There is a full video of the discussion there.

Short version : it is planned.

As an aside, I don’t think Microsoft acquiring GitHub is a good reason to move off it (after all they already provide the platform for 95% of our users to run QGIS on). If you watch the video there are other more pragmatic reasons to move to gitlab...

Regards

Tim

Hi Matthias,

Thank you very much!

Assunto: Re: [QGIS-Developer] QgsFeatureRequest SortByOrder

Hi Jorge,

There are two possibilities, one is to use the full-blown API with
OrderBy class etc. And then there is a shorthand for this, called
QgsFeatureRequest.addOrderBy which is enough in 90% of the cases.

Short version:

  request = QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.addOrderBy('field_name')

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Feature/QgsFeatureRequest.html#qgis.core.QgsFeatureRequest.addOrderBy

Long version:

  clause = QgsFeatureRequest.OrderByClause('field_name')
  orderBy = QgsFeatureRequest.OrderBy([clause])
  request = QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.setOrderBy(orderBy)

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Feature/QgsFeatureRequest.html#qgis.core.QgsFeatureRequest.setOrderBy

Regards Matthias

as far as I know/remember, nothing is changed from the AuthManager point of
view... only the sigleton has been moved as wrote by Nyall, as most of
singleton.

Hi,

Is it normal that http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.2.0/ provides
only 5 new features?

Hi,

interesting, even those commits tagged with [FEATURE] are not in the
changelog, if I am not wrong, those were added automatically in the past.

These commits are added to the QGIS-Documentation issue tracker, but not in
the QGIS changelog.
Developers should do it themselves with the form.
We don't create always one changelog entry per feature, for instance with
new expressions, we create only one entry in the changelog referencing all
new expressions with a bullet list.

Nope, nothing is added automagically...

What we have is a githook which adds an issue in the documentation issue 
list when a QGIS commit msg contains [FEATURE]:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues

Developers, Funders or just normal users have to add features for the 
Changelog theirselves, eventually based on something like:

git log --oneline | grep FEATURE

As 3.2 is coming, PLEASE add items to

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.2.0/

so we will have a well filled nice changelog around the actual release!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks Etienne and Richard,

I am aware that there is a documentation hook in place.

I was under the impression that in the past new changelogs where
pre-populated with commit messages containing [FEATURE] and I just had
to fill the details and add others that were missing. But if you say it,
I must be mixing something up here.

I added everything manually now. I can't see it nowhere, but I hope it's
in some review queue.

Thanks
Matthias

Hi Matthias, I approved 3 pending entries for you .
The current Projecta workflow makes entries disappear when you submit them,
and one with privileges must approve it (Tim, Richard and I, IIRC)

I agree this is surprising and suboptimal, but we rely on Tim's efforts for
having projecta, which is already a great tool.

I see, there is a lot of Tim's good will involved in this tool.
This is much appreciated!

Thanks for approving, Régis.

Cheers

Hi Richard, hi group,

has anything changed recently? We have -again- since several days 
problems mirroring ubuntugis locally:

debmirror --dist=xenial --section=main --arch=i386,amd64 --cleanup 
--host=qgis.org --root=ubuntugis-ltr --method=https --rsync-extra=none 
/mirrorpath
fails with 403 both via http and https

Bernhard

Hi

Thanks for the kind comments. We have an open ticket for getting rid of the pending state stuff:

https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/806

We thought it was a great idea in the beginning, now we realise it was a crap one :-P

Regards

Tim

Odd.  With wget and a browser I can get
https://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr/dists/xenial/Release.

But I can reproduce with debmirror.   I works when when I use nocache.qgis.org
instead of qgis.org.

Looks like a cloudflare issue.

Using myself here (adding -v -debug).
Using nocache.qgis.org (which is NOT going through cloudflare), I get
another problem, but that is maybe because nocache.qgis.org is not known
in keys/certificates or so?

# debmirror -v -debug --dist=xenial --section=main --arch=i386,amd64

Did some more testing, and it is definitly a cloudflare issue.
If I disable caching on qgis.org temporarily it works.

But if I use a silly (googled) perl script which mimics the perl lines
from debmirror:

# Create a user agent object
use LWP::UserAgent;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
my $res = $ua->mirror(
'https://anonymous at qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr/dists/xenial/Release',
'/tmp/Release' );
# Check the outcome of the response
if ($res->is_success) {
    print $res->content;
}
else {
    print $res->status_line, "\n";
}

it also(!) just works...
Tried to set the ssl_verification to false, other headers, but I could
not make debmirror work.

We cannot remove cache from qgis.org (as we generate too much web
traffic then, and our services really become slower)

You could use https://nocache.qgis.org ?

I prefer to keep ubuntu.qgis.org cached too, unless others have problems
with it too..

Sorry I cannot be of more help.

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing plugin deprecated
Message-ID: <CAD3koGmZeEc1SeaTwgjLjY_crT9oTWwK2jmK63xbcJUH0V9Bvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

the Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rectovalDigit ) has an issue that causes
QGIS to slow down and get unstable:
https://github.com/vinayan/RectOvalDigitPlugin/issues/6

I sent a pullrequest with a fix for the problem (
https://github.com/vinayan/RectOvalDigitPlugin/pull/7  ) but the plugin
does not seem to be maintained any more.


In 2013 there was already a discussion that the plugin does not seem to be
maintained any more:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Fwd-Re-WG-quot-Rectangles-ovals-digitizing-quot-plugin-is-broken-in-QGIS-1-9-td5028866.html

I asked the author if the plugin is still maintained by him:

----

Hello,

just a short question: Is the RectOvalDigitPlugin still maintained by you?

best wishes,
Thomas

---
The answer:

Pavol Kapusta
Hello, the short answer is no. Best regards
---
Thomas

Ok, thanks for the reply.
I think the Plugin should then be marked as deprecated as it has some
issues that slow down qgis.( I sent a pull request with a patch).
Are you ok with that?

---

Pavol Kapusta

Hello,

I am OK with that, of course.

Best regards

---



The plugin was obviously migrated to the github account of Vinayan
Parameswaran ( https://github.com/vinayan/RectOvalDigitPlugin ) in 2013 but
this repository also does not seem to be maintained any more.
I sent an email to Vinayan Parameswaran but did not get an answer yet.

As the plugin slows down QGIS very badly until it freezes after editing and
saving edits for some time I think that the current version in the official
plugin repository should be marked as deprecated.

best wishes,
Thomas

Ok, I added the deprication flag then, also as there are alternatives
available for doing this if I'm correct.

Let me know if this is a problem for anyone, we can easily remove the
flag, but I agree that we should not make QGIS behave badly because of this.

I have never used the plugin but repeatedly seen its name mentioned, so
I assume it's widely used?

In this case, it would be great if someone could volunteer as a new
maintainer for the plugin. I think the minimal amount of work would be
to merge pull requests and upload patched releases to the plugin repository.

Matthias

I know, it was the first plugin which made it possible to to rectangles
and shapes.

BUT it is also known as a plugin which kills QGIS after some time, eg:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/9229 and other issues.
If I'm correct it keeps connecting actions, but never removes them or so...

That was the reason to add the flag so swiftly...

Agreed, and I'm fine with that too.
But we should also not keep old, troubling plugins in the repo list IF
there are better newer alternatives available.
In this case, try:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/shapetools/

which can even create heart shapes :-)

But: feel if anybody takes over the Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing plugin,
we can easily remove the flag again.

Richard Duivenvoorde

That's the information I was missing, if this one is in good shape and
can even create hearts, it's just a matter of spreading the word.

Could there be a link to newer plugins on deprecated ones (where
applicable)?

It's not needed anymore - 3.0 has the built in rectangles and ovals
digitising tools.

Just a note that setting this flag, does not make them uninstallable.

In the Plugins/Settings you can check 'Show also deprecated plugins' and
you can see and install them..

About linking to newer plugins:
- currently using the flag uses will not see this 'notion' of an
alternative plugin
- we could update the plugin manager maybe? So it always shows the
deprecated ones by default?
- I added some text to the 'description' and 'about' field, but am not
sure if it is feasible to do this: which alternative(s) to choose, how
to keep those fields updated etc...

But we'll see.

That's good news, but for the current LTR and as general question on
deprecating plugins I think it's still a valid request ;-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsAuthConfigSelect use
Message-ID: <b66ac827-1b0b-d0eb-b32f-db4ab2a3cbd4@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm using the QgsAuthConfigSelect-widget, to create 'configs' (with url,
id, username, password (basic auth)) etc.

It works great!! I could even incorporate it in my dialog!

Two comments, of which I like to have some input of others if possible:

1) (see screenshot) currently the 'type' is always added in the dropdown
(in my case you always see (Basic)). If a user wants to see this, it is
possible to add it themselves (see (mytype)).
So Question: would there be troubles if I remove that?

2) the first item is ALWAYS: 'No authentication'.
In my case that does not make sense. If you did not create a 'profile',
there is not an url, no nothing, so I would prefer to see either:
- nothing (no item)
- 'Please create an authorisation profile'
- 'Please configure first'
or something like that.

Any comments?

I'm aware that this is build for governmental use, so if this is cast in
stone, then... we leave it like this?


Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python support broken in OSGeo4W nightly?
Message-ID: <528856dccde42a4ddc88cb283672e9c3@carto.net>

Hi, 

With version https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8f55093642 (OSGeo4W
nightly of QGIS master) I get a Python error message on startup, and as
a result all Python support is disabled: 

Error message: 

---------------- 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "C:/Programme/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis-dev/./python\qgis\utils.py",
line 33, in 
    from qgis.core import Qgis, QgsExpression, QgsMessageLog,
qgsfunction, QgsMessageOutput, QgsWkbTypes
ImportError: cannot import name 'Qgis' 

------------------------- 

Is this a windows specific problem or a general problem in master in
this commit? 

Or is this fixed by
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8ef0d1f7d95bdc52904cd1d075f2f409f8523cb6
? 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

I use it, but only when needing to actually draw, as it leaks memory 
quite badly causing the software to slow down. The rest of the time I 
start up Qgis (2.18) using the -noplugins flag to prevent it from loading.

I know there is some kind of capability in 3.0 included but I haven't 
figured out how to use it.

Hi Andreas,

It's my fault, it'll be fixed by tomorrow's build.
In the mean time, you can manually fix this by adding missing __init__.py
in python/{core|gui|analysis|server}/
you can use empty files as a quick and dirty or copy the content from here
(rename .py.in to .py)
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/__init__.py.in

Sorry for the inconvenience.
Denis

Are the build in rectangles and ovals tools in QGIS 3 maptools to digitize
objects in a polygon-layer or 'just' an algorithm of the processing toolbox?

A fixed version of the plugin is available at
https://github.com/rdbath/RectOvalDigitPlugin for people who would still
like to use the plugin.
I was just thinking about if I should volunteer as a maintainer but I think
the code of the plugin is in general a bit "stale" and would need an
overhaul for which I just don't have the time to do that.
So I am not sure if it's a good idea to make a new version of the plugin
available even if the major problem of the plugin is fixed.

The plugin in use and probably causing data loss, reducing productivity
and giving bad reputation for QGIS (I guess many are not aware that it's
actually a plugin which is responsible for the situation, that their
QGIS is slowing down).

BTW the debian builds were also affected.

Hi,

I forked it some years ago since it wasn't maintained, see 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/CADDigitize/

FYI, it's integrated into QGIS 3.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error when trying to save feature sink as file in
	processing plugin
Message-ID: <76FA15B5-AD6D-4E88-BA2E-D354800BFC9B@gmail.com>

Hi,

I’m developing a processing plugin and one of the outputs of my algorithm is a table of values. I’m using a feature sink to populate that table with the values I want. When I run the algorithm and just output the table to memory (i.e. don’t specify a place to save it), it works fine. But when I try “Save to file…” it doesn’t work. I get an “Exception: unknown” error on this line of my code:

(sink, dest_id) = self.parameterAsSink(parameters, self.OUTPUT_ESV_TABLE, context, output_esv_table_fields)

I get the same error regardless of which type of file I try to save it as (csv, gpkg, shp, etc).

I get the same error regardless of whether or not I select “Open output file after running algorithm”.

If instead of providing a typical file path and name like “/Users/me/Desktop/project/whatever.csv”, I enter “memory:”, it works. 

My algorithm also outputs a raster and when I try to save that output to a file it works fine.

Any idea what the problem is?

Thanks,
Phil Ribbens

Message-ID: <CABPxTTpXP3YyFO88ZQpUzraoPc26KCxQMaesSyohqdfO7N8rkg@mail.gmail.com>

In QGIS 2 when you apply a pseudocolor color ramp to a DEM there was an
Invert color ramp check box. I cannot find it in QGIS 3.0.3. Am I missing
something or has it been dropped? I use that feature all the time.

Thanks,

Right click on the color ramp button, you'll find an "invert ramp" menu
item.

Hi,

good to know that there is a acitvely maintained alternative to the old
plugin.

I agree with Matthias that a patch should be shipped.

( "



*From my point of view, this patch should be shipped even without a general
overhaul.  The plugin in use and probably causing data loss, reducing
productivity and giving bad reputation for QGIS (I guess many are not aware
that it's actually a plugin which is responsible for the situation, that
their QGIS is slowing down).* " )

The current version of the plugin has more than 70000 Downloads so probably
there are a lot of people affected by the bug.

What's really nasty about the plugin is the fact that is slows down QGIS
even if you don't use it's functionality. As soon as it is installed it
listenes to the currentLayerChanged signal and connects the editingStarted
and editingStopped signal again and again to the toggle function.

At the company I'm working for this bug had caused a lot of frustration
until I found out what caused QGIS to slow down, freeze and crash.
Indeed the users (of course) did not differentiate between the core QGIS
and plugins   and their feedback just was that their QGIS is slow and
unstable.


*Now I tried to upload a new version of the plugin with the bugfix at
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/> but I get following error-message:*

"You cannot modifiy this plugin. "

How should I proceed?


Thomas

I'm happy to move owner/maintainership to Thomas or Loïc, if needed.

But it is not fully clear to me about which plugin (version) you 
(Thomas) are talking?

So please:
- make sure you have consent from the old maintainer to take over
- sent me your username
- the name of the plugin that you want ownership of
- fix metadata of your new version so you credit yourself AND old 
maintainer
- fix metadata so it points to your new maintained repo/docs/plugin 
site.

Then we can move maintainership (and/or remove deprecated flag)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Not for me :)

I maintain only my fork (CADDigitize), and I preferer work on cad
integration into qgis :)

No offense to my question, but why use this plugin again, since
CADDigitize or QAD (and maybe others) do the same job (better) and more?

Regards

Loïc

The main other issue with it is if I have a form that I need to fill in 
the fields on, that doesn't pop up when you rightclick. You have to go 
find it in the table and then fill the fields in.

Hi,
Should we not take the occasion to get rid of this plugin

plugins. If in this case there are (better?) alternatives, we should not
revive the plugin imho.
I'd be in favor of fixing the current issue of freeze while deprecating it
with a message in its description (in Plugin Manager) inviting potential
users to migrate to the alternatives.

In the fixed version of the plugin I have written in the about section:
"about=THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. PLEASE USE CADDIGITIZE
INSTEAD: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/CADDigitize/"

So the idea behind the update is just to fix the problem for the users who
have installed the plugin and point them to an alternative.
I think that these users won't find out that they should get rid of the
plugin if it's just flagged as deprecated or does the user get a message
for already installed plugins if they get flagged as deprecated?

Well, no offence either, but I think humans in general are conservative 
and like habits and structure :-)

So Matthias' (probably valid) point is: now we deprecated the (old 
Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing plugin), people get lost because the miss 
there 'old/valuable/' plugin...
Fact is also that older plugins popup earlier in google results if you 
google for certain words.

So the best way to handle this is to 'market' (better working) plugins 
more by maybe writing some blogposts, make people aware of your plugin 
in mailing lists etc etc?

In this way natural selection/evolution should make that the 
plugin-dino's finally get extinct because of Google finding the 
alternatives :-)

In general I think it is ok to deprecate plugins! In this case: an 
unmaintained buggy one, which has better alternatives... why keep it?
But we have to find an (for us easy) way to help people who got lost 
because of a deprecation...
(while writing I see Thomas is answering: I put a pointer to better 
working plugin in a fixed version. I think that is a good solution!)

While we are discussing this - I'd also like to seem the same logic
applied to the OpenLayers plugin. That plugin has very serious issues,
more so than the Rectangles/ plugin (since OpenLayers can cause data
corruption!). Better alternatives exist now (XYZ tiles,
QuickMapServices plugin).

I'd be very much in favour of deprecating the OpenLayers plugin and
marking it with a "install QuickMapServices" instead warning.

Maybe better to point to core fucntionality than yet another plugin?

@ Richard Duivenvoorde :

I am talking about the Rectangles Ovals Digitizing plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rectovalDigit/  )
Current version is 1.1.2

The code is currently available at
https://github.com/vinayan/RectOvalDigitPlugin

The author itself ( Pavol Kapusta ) is ok with the idea of deprecating the
plugin.

I emailed the current maintainer Vinayan Parameswaran ( vinayan123 at gmail.com)
to find out if he still maintains the plugin but did not get an answer.

If someone else knows how to get in contact with him feel free to do so.

My fork of the plugin with the bugfix is available at

https://github.com/rdbath/RectOvalDigitPlugin/

as version 1.1.3.

Thomas

I understand your point, and I confirm that a large number of users
complain about this. I'd appreciate, before taking any step, if the
original author would comment on this.
Thanks Pirmin.

The functionality isn't the same. Core functionality lets users manually add
tileservers. OpenLayers and QMS plugins allow users to add *preconfigured*
tileservers. Do I recall that QMS adopted native tileserver functionality
where possible? I'd therefore point users to QMS, as Nyall suggests.

as it often happens, I fully agree with you. Let's keep on reducing
duplication and confusion among users.

Ismail Sunni has patched the changelog - it no longer requires moderation for categories, versions &  entries. I hope that makes the process much smoother now!

as far as I can understand, OL plugin is the sole that can be used
legally; the others may violate GG licence (caution: IANAL).
One alternative to deprecating would be to state clearly advantages
(legality) and disadvantages (limitations or bugs) clear in the
description and about.

All the best.

I understand that's the case, but at the same time -- what's
ultimately better for our users? I think that given:

- there's a demonstrated need for this plugin, yet only in narrow
circumstances (users who specifically require Google Maps base layers,
and have made the call that using the Open Layers approach is legally
acceptable for their organisation)
- there's very serious, long standing issues here, causing real world
data corruption, and wasted time/frustration by our users, and better
alternatives exist which meet the needs of most users

we should deprecate it and mark it with a large warning, and ideally
see it moved it to a 3rd party plugin repo (which is not included in
the default QGIS install).

I'm not sure I understand what you are asking: the ("Basic") string is the
authentication type (that comes to the authentication plugin that the
configuration is using)  and it is a useful piece of information, but of
course it is not required.

I think you should handle that in your particular dialog logic, the widget
does what it was designed for, that is allow the users to choose and
existing authentication configuration AND/OR to create a new one, editing
and deletion of existing configs is also available.

Nothing is carved in stone, but still I would leave like it is now.

Hi all,

in the vertex editor of QGIS 2.x when a line of the table id selected
the corresponding vertex is highlighted in the map.

In QGIS 3 it seems that this super useful feature is not there anymore.
I just wanted to report this ;)

Cheers

Hi Jorge,

yes exactly. But in the vertex table, if you click on one or many rows
the corresponding vertex are not highlighted in the map like it is for 2.x

Hi Alessandro,

In my case where a user will have 5 - 10 auth-profiles, all those ending
with (Basic) does not add info for my users. And IF I think it is
helpfull to know if it is either a 'Postgres' or a 'Basic
Authentication' profile, I can add it myself to the title of the profile?

In my case, the widget is used for a little more: it actually not only
defines the username/config, but also the actual url-api-endpoint the
users connects to.
o in my case 'No authentication' does not cover the content... If I
could choose it said: 'Please create a profile' or so.

I have been looking at:
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/Auth/QgsAuthConfigSelect.html

But I do not think I have a handle to change or reach the actual
combobox is it? To either change the caption or so?

Anyway, thanks for all this. Besides this minor points it works great.

Regards,

RIchard

Now I understand, selecting rows on table it selects the respective node on canvas. But selecting the node on canvas it does not select it on table.

Sorry for the noise.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PSA: Use of Hotspot to find performance bottlenecks
Message-ID: <CAB28Asi55TM9c2gu0XkTpiUG-4rCOBv8b61SRck=Kv1wtLDOxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thought I'd give a bit of a "heads-up" regarding a tool I've been
using a lot recently to find performance bottlenecks in QGIS code.

The tool is hotspot - https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot . It's a
graphical frontend to the kernel perf tool (so linux only). What makes
it really easy to use is the different views it provides to the perf
reports. I've especially found the "flamegraph" view to be very
helpful at tracking down bottlenecks.

To use it, you launch QGIS and get ready to run the process you want
to profile. Then from hotspot, you run the File - Record Data command,
and attach to the running QGIS process. Flick back to QGIS, do some
stuff, and return to hotspot and Stop Recording then View Results...
and fingers crossed, you'll find some nice and easy bottlenecks to
fix.

I've tried other tools like this in the past, but found hotspot is the
easiest to to use because it doesn't require any compilation changes,
you can attach to already running applications, and because the
supplied views are very helpful.

I think the server team especially may find this beneficial during
their current hunt on server performance regressions!

Hi
I have been testing building models in Processing and I have some additional
thoughts.

- I would like to see better documentation, including descriptions and
examples, including images where applicable, for all algorithms. For quite a
few algorithms, there seems to be no documentation in the tool at all.
- Not exclusively related to Processing, but support for reading data from
LDAP would be valuable.
- How about support for duplicating a model in the model list? I can imagine
that I would like to create similar models somewhere down the road.
- It should be possible to drop files outside of QGIS directly on a model
and use it as input.
- In the algortihm for dropping attributes, it seems that I manually have to
enter the attributes to remove. The drop down list is empty. Is this
intended? I would prefer a list/window where I can select one or more
attributes to drop.
- When writing to a SHP file that already exists, I get a Python error. When
I remove the file and run the model again, it works as expected.
- When writing to an excel file and the file already exists from a previous
model run, all of the featres are replaced. There should be an option for
how to handle this case. Replace the file, truncate, add features to the
existnig content.
- How do I write to multiple data sets in the same model? For me, it is not
uncommon that I want to create for example SHP and excel output in the same
job, but I don´t see how to create more than one output file.
- When I write features with a geometry to an excel file, I get a Python
error and the result is emty. If I drop the geometries in the model, it
works as expected. Of course, excel files can´t contain geometry, but when
writing to file formats that don´t support geometry, the geometry should be
ignored and not cause an error.
- I would like to see support for using a template for styling the exel
files created with a model. For example fonts, locking the first row and so
on.
- The algorithm for calculating the shortest path onlys seems to allow
selecting start and end point manually from the map. In some cases, I have a
large table with coordinates for start and end points and I would like to be
able to use these attributes instead, creating one route for each
combination of points. Perhaps this would be good candicate for using
OpenCL?

Any thoughts?

Regards,

Magnus

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS server question: opacities of selection
	colors in a layer
Message-ID: <48863f4e-756e-3c8f-de87-9a5050fe16e6@carto.net>

Hi,

I am refering to the SELECTION parameter in QGIS server, as described in 
https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/services.html#getmap 
- see section on "SELECTION"

I am trying to achieve a transparent selection, so that layers beneath 
the selected layer can shine through. I thought that QGIS server would 
pick up the selection color and opacity of the project - but apparently 
this isn't the case. Is there a possibility to influence selection color 
and opacity in QGIS server?

My tests were with QGIS server 2.18. Not sure if things have improved in 
version 3 in this respect?

Thank you for your replies.

Andreas

		Hi Andreas,
Version 2 of the server is not working for your case, there’s a bug that I reported some time ago but version 3 works as expected plus it has a test for your case.Cannot point you to the issue on redmine as I’m on my phone.
All the best,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems with QGIS 3 Hillshade
Message-ID: <CABPxTTp=DDZj1UHnL5uBnxT9jQg_FJP4QvJXK6U2kL1dMj45aQ@mail.gmail.com>

OS: Windows 7
QGIS 3.0.3

I have encountered several issues with the Hillshade algorithm in QGIS 3.

1. It is much slower that the QGIS 2 hillshade perhaps as much as 10x
slower. This is a problem because I process very large images. 60,000 x
80,000 pixels or greater. I eventually killed the process and went back to
QGIS 2 to complete the job.

2. I tried using Multidirectional shading and received an error. This is
basically the command issued.

gdaldem hillshade input.tif output.tif -of GTiff -b 1 -z 1.0 -s 1.0 -az
315.0 -alt 45.0 -multidirectional


I get the gdal error "ERROR 6: -multidirectional and -az cannot be used
together". If multidirectional is enabled then you cannot add the -az
parameter. If have tried running the same command in the command line and
removed the -az and it worked fine.

Can you post the command created in QGIS 2.18 for comparison?

Confirmed, thanks - fixed by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7209
and unit tests added.

You can edit the model and save as a new one from the modeler dialog.

Yes, this is intended. When you are designing a model the child
algorithm's don't know which layer they will be operating on, or what
attributes will be present in those layers. So you need to manually
enter things like this.

What's the Python error? Is this 2.x or 3.0? (If 2.x, use 3.0 -
modeler is much stabler in 3.0).

> - How do I write to multiple data sets in the same model? For me, it is not

Try adding a "drop geometries" step to your model, so that the model
has one output before the drop geometry and one for the result of the
dropped geometry (for the excel output).

What's the error?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] changeAttributeValue() slower after editing
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OeAcjupUPZcmm-G=Zp=i3zWPpBHpJxZa2=qhxAanr4b=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running method to update attributes. Here is a simplified version:

"""
    def recalculateAttributes(self):
        self._layer.setReadOnly(False)
        self._layer.startEditing()

        features = self._layer.getFeatures()
        for feat in features:
            self._layer.changeAttributeValue(feat.id(), 2, 1)

        self._layer.commitChanges()
        self._layer.setReadOnly(True)
"""

I am running this function after loading (seems OK) and after editing:

"""
                layer.setReadOnly(False)
                iface.actionToggleEditing().trigger()
                iface.actionDeleteSelected().trigger()
                iface.actionSaveActiveLayerEdits().trigger()
                iface.actionToggleEditing().trigger()
                layer.setReadOnly(True)
"""

In this case recalculateAttributes() runs at least 3-4x slower. On my
PC of my colleague even 10x slower.

Layer is stored in SQLite format. Using QGIS 2.18.20. Any idea what
could be wrong? Thanks! Martin

I was using the Hillshade from the Terrain Analysis plugin. I don't know if
it uses GDAL for the processing or not, but it does not give a GDAL command
line. The Terrain Analysis plugin seems to be dropped for QGIS 3, but if
the GDAL hillshade is going to be as slow as it was, that is going to be a
serious problem for me.

Thanks,

Calvin

Calvin,

The terrain analysis plugin in 2.18 is QGIS specific code.

Your observations don't match mine. I tried on a 60,000x80,000 input TIFF of 
type Byte, without nodata. Ubuntu 16.04 / gcc 5.5

The timings I get:
- debug GDAL -dev & QGIS 2.18 builds:
    * gdaldem hillshade: 11m10s
    * terrain analysis plugin: 14m10s

- optimized GDAL -dev & QGIS 2.18 builds:
     * gdaldem hillshade: 2m35s
     * terrain analysis plugin: 12m00s

I've compared source codes between GDAL and QGIS. The overall structure is 
identical, process line by line, same type of algorithms, but the GDAL code 
has a few optimized paths compared to QGIS one (much less trigonometric 
computations in critical path), which explains the difference of timings in 
optimized builds. But not in the direction you mention.

can you post the output of gdalinfo on your input DEM ?

Interesting. One difference is that I am running this on an input of type
float32 with NODATA. I am on Widows 7. The data I am working with is from

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Improve GRASS GIS integration in QGIS 3 - Week 4
	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-PxszmjfV0GN7vYkZeuNd_PW3ZAs-_qPCO8XfCRz90WcGUqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is my report for Week 4 (June 4 - June 10):

*What did you get done this week?*

   - I finalized the library for parsing description files for QGIS
   Processing plugin. [1]


   - Add 'Controversy decision' in building the parser to wiki. [2]

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Split GRASS module parameters in Processing plugin to basic and
   advanced tabs - it should be required and optional tab.


   - Check GRASS X QGIS parameter descriptions in order to take care of
   differences in terminology.

*Are you blocked on anything?*

   - No, at the moment I’m not blocked.

Hi Tim,

Apparently, you're using the system Python. Are you sure you have sip
installed in there?
In my config, sip is installed in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/

Thanks for your reply. Yeah I know - I’m more trying to figure out how to get it to ignore the system install python 3. Its wierd because distils is always showing the system include dir rather than my local one e.g.:

[timlinux at sandstone ~/dev/cpp/QGIS (master)]$ /usr/local/bin/python3
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48ecebad5, Dec 18 2017, 21:07:28)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import distutils.sysconfig
>>> distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/include/python3.6m'

I’m expecting it to return

/usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/include

Since I ran the brew installed python3.

Even overriding the CMAKE options in my kit always returns the /library path because FindPython calls the FindLibPython.py before doing anything else it seems.

Regards

Tim

Hi

Oops looking more closely at FindPythonLibrary.cmake, it only uses your cmake overrides if all three of PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH, PYTHON_LIBRARY and PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_DIR are set. I put mine to:


PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=/usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/include/python3.6m/
PYTHON_LIBRARY:STRING=/usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/
PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_DIR:STRING=/usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib

Just busy compiling mine to see if that works now…

Regards

Tim

Yeah, mine is returning
'/usr/local/opt/python/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/include/python3.6m'

here is my cmake config
https://gist.github.com/3nids/60bc40b47e6e4db32cd20b81b58c9098

there is the Pyhton executable, that's the only thing I see

I hope this helps.

Denis

Looks great again, making very nice progress!

I'm wondering, have you tried yet to generate a diff of the output of
your tool vs the current processing txt descriptions? I'd be keen to
see the results of this as soon as it can be done, because I suspect
this diff will reveal some issues in the current description files
which would be good to fix before 3.2 final release.

	changed by dataProvider
Message-ID: <CADk-=6dDFz6tPCOWeuQiYZW2hDZVgoStaWYQaH-7onC29JLxVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone, i"m using QGIS2.18, and trying to change feature attributes
using the following two methods:

*dataProvider:*

attrs = { 0 : "hello", 1 : 123 }
layer.dataProvider().changeAttributeValues({ fid : attrs })

*layer object:*

layer.startEditing()
layer.changeAttributeValue(fid, fieldIndex, value)
layer.commitChanges()

I keep the attribute table open, and monitor the changes. The first method
dataProvider is not able to update the attribute table on the fly, even the
"reload table" button on the top menu of the table does not work. I have to
re-open the table to see the changes. The second method is working, the
attribute table gets instantly updated.

I would like to stay with the dataProvider method but not sure how to get
instantly updated attribute table?
Thanks.

Best regards,
Ethan

The provider's dataChanged() signal needs to be emitted, I think you can
directly emit that or call `dataProvider().forceReload()`.

Out of curiosity, why would you like to stay with the dataProvider  method?

Hi Ethan,

there are of course advantages and disadvantages of both methods, but in
most cases the QgsVectorLayer ones just "do the right thing", especially
when used with a `with` block, see also this post:

http://www.opengis.ch/2015/08/12/with-edit-layer/

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3 modeler - GDAL call parameters double
	escaped
Message-ID: <8c821100-35d3-2320-f684-3afecbcaff45@di.uminho.pt>

Hi,

I was showing a very small use case of the modeler, with just two steps,
to count reindeers in a IR raster. It failed with a very simple error.
If I use spaces in the final output name, it fails. This is not a high
priority issue.

If I set the output name as 'reindeer polygons', the gdal call is:

gdal_polygonize.py
/tmp/processing_7b5b06e1a8f14ee09ac38187a00ce932/dfee0e38cbd1483ca732fd82a12110c5/OUTPUT.tif
"\"/tmp/processing_7b5b06e1a8f14ee09ac38187a00ce932/ef043a13ea8044c4a4ab9fee9c373b1f/gdal_polygonize_1_reindeer
polygons.shp\"" -b 1 -f "ESRI Shapefile"

But the additional " are not necessary and it will fail. The entire log
is below.

If the generated string was just (without the additional \"):

gdal_polygonize.py
/tmp/processing_7b5b06e1a8f14ee09ac38187a00ce932/dfee0e38cbd1483ca732fd82a12110c5/OUTPUT.tif
"/tmp/processing_7b5b06e1a8f14ee09ac38187a00ce932/ef043a13ea8044c4a4ab9fee9c373b1f/gdal_polygonize_1_reindeer
polygons.shp" -b 1 -f "ESRI Shapefile"

it works.

So, it is escaped only if there are spaces on the output name. In Linux
this double escaping fails. Does this escaping works on other OS? Is it
safe to discard this double escaping mechanism?

Regards,

J. Gustavo

Glad you like it :)

Forwading this answer also to the mailing list for future reference,
Ethan, you need to use "reply to all" in your mail application or other
are not able to follow our conversation (which would be a pity ;) ).

Best regards
Matthias

Thanks Matthias. Got it. I was just trying to not flood messages to those
pals who may not be interested.

should be applied the same fix applied to gdal_calc...
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6984

in that case the problem was interpreting the formula as path... in your
case you are escaping a real path

GdalUtils.escapeAndJoin in  getConsoleCommands(...) do escaping...

Hi,

just to comment that indeed, updating GEOS to v3.6.1 (available now in
OSGeo4W) fixed the Difference algorithm. Now it works with multipoins
as well!

I hope the weekly QGIS installer (i.e., the .exe available in QGIS
downloads) gets updated for next Monday, since the current one
(latests Monday) does not include an updated GEOS yet.


Regards,

Germán

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Dynamic Pie Shape Style
Message-ID: <CABPxTTr9KqY6ui3LJrpbRo0Qh7fj9WPoONiKY76u4TrMOD9wbA@mail.gmail.com>

I had a request from a user of "Shape Tools" to make the pie shapes dynamic
in the sense that as you zoom in and out they would visibly resize to be
remain seen. Since "Shape Tools" creates the pie polygons that is not
possible.

I was wondering if it is possible to add some type of shape style that
would render a pie shape from a point layer with the options of specifying
starting and stopping angles and its relative size.

I don't know if this is possible so I thought I would solicit some ideas to
see if it worth pursuing.

Thanks,

Calvin Hamilton

Hi Matthias

I follow the steps in the link you posted and get the following errors when
trying to import

ImportError: cannot import name QgsEditException

Do I have to install some modules? Didn't find any luck on google.

Best regards,
Zhang Qun

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Implement polygon feature selection using
	QgsMapTool in QgsMapCanvas
Message-ID: <CAH=uC=8FzX976bc8n28zyNbT_M+ZMnBgDRVn=JePaY7JJwA9mA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to develop a plugin which contains it's own QgsMapCanvas. I need
the user to select a feature on the map canvas which requires the map tool
to replicate the function of the Select Feature of the Qgis
Interface.[iface.actionSelect().trigger()]. Is there any way to do it?

Hi Calvin,

Does that not mean you could use svg symbols for this?
I know parts of svg is made dynamic, as you can define the color of svg's.
I'm not sure if you can make other parts of an svg dynamic too?
Would be cool to be able to use expressions for example to
color/rotate/size svg symbols?

Another thing I was thinking about: did you explore the geometry
generator stuff?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Gentle reminder: please test 3.2 RC and update
 Visual Changelog with your work items
Message-ID: <7b807553-49b7-a1e6-124a-d5df5a0d7ff4@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

With QGIS 3.2 coming near...

Please devs: add items too our visual changelog,
so if downloads start we will have something to show (off):

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.2.0/
It should be a little easier now
(@Tim, no more approval needed if I'm correct...?)

And for users: please test our latest development version!
Really fresh builds you can updated every day come in via the OSGeo4W
installer.
But if that is too much for you, you can test your work process by using
a weekly build standalone installer:
https://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/?C=M;O=D

And for all (also wannebee) devs: please take the time to clear up some
issues of current master:
https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues

Hope 3.2 will be the best release ever (well at least untill the one
after that ;-) ).

Regards & Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hello!

I have a question, maybe you have time to answer :)
I need to automate as much as possible with python in QGIS. First I want to switch the coordinate system of a layer, for example to WGS84. I can't find any way to do this. Maybe you can help me with an hint, or if it is even possible to do this via python?

My plan is to create a fertilizer map for my fields and combine it with the sentinel 2 satellite to also use the ndvi.


QGIS Version: 2.18.18
QGIS Codeversion: b33566195a
Other detailed informations I attached.


Kind Regards Lukas

it's QgsEditException. The edit(layer) statement is working just fine.

Hi Lukas,

You can have a look at the PyQGIS (Python QGIS) documentation.
In your case, have a look at QgsMapLayer.setCrs
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/Map/QgsMapLayer.html#qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCrs

(almost) everything's possible with PyQGIS!

Message-ID: <1760223.sH3VGvW3Lm@thinkpadx1>

Hi Devs!

I have searched and I don't found any documentation about how to migrate some 
functions inside processing tool, I use it inside my plugin (but it's not a processing plugin 
inself) and I need to migrate specifically the VectorWriter function for write a vector points 
file, such as:

from processing.tools import vector

writer = vector.VectorWriter(....)
...
f = QgsFeature(...)
...
writer.addFeature(f)


Please help, Thanks!

You should use the standard QgsVectorFileWriter class instead.

There's a bit of a guide to porting processing applications here:

 Hi All,

This is my report for Week 5 (June 11 - June 17):

*What did you get done this week?*

Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of time for the project this week,
because I have exams at my university.

   - I improved the library for parsing description files for QGIS
   Processing plugin. (1)
   - Add all 'Controversy decision' in project and summary from hangouts to
   wiki. (2)

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Split GRASS module parameters in Processing plugin to tabs - it should
   be on GUI Tabs.
   - Find all differences in the terminology of QGIS and GRASS GIS.

*Are you blocked on anything?*

   - No, at the moment I’m not blocked.

Hi Radek,

Can you elaborate more on what your plans are here? This is
potentially a very large change in Processing itself, since Processing
does not currently handle tabbed parameter dialogs.  I'd strongly
recommend to leave this as a follow up action when the rest of the
work is complete, as I'd be concerned that trying to tackle this
alongside the GRASS parsing library will cause a large delay to the
rest of your project.

It's also a change which would need to be discussed via a "QEP" (QGIS
Enhancement Proposal - see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues) first, in
order to ensure that the approach taken here is correct for both code
and UI.

Hope that makes sense! I'd hate to see your great progress slowed by
delays caused by this component of the project.

Thanks Nyall, It was good reference for read more the new api changes in processing 
functions, finally I migrated the VectorWriter like as:

from qgis.core import QgsVectorFileWriter, QgsWkbTypes

writer = QgsVectorFileWriter(output, "System", fields, QgsWkbTypes.MultiPoint, crs, "ESRI 
Shapefile")
f = QgsFeature(...)
writer.addFeature(f)

Thanks for the reminder!

I've just trawled through all the commits since 3.0 was released and
added entries for all missing features. Some of these are very empty
though - just a heading.  I also may have missed sponsors if they
weren't indicated in the commit message - so please double check those
for any sponsored work which wasn't already added to the changelog.

So now it's over to some other magic elf to flesh out these entries
with nicer text and lovely screenshots. ;)

Whee, go devs, goooo :-)

Thanks all!

And to make it better: 10 of the PR's are actually tagged FEATURE, so

So actually we are ... 29 ;-)

Sorry for the late reply, I´ve been out of office for a while. I used the
weekly build of QGIS 3. I will  try again in 3.2.0 next week and open
tickets if I still get the Python errors.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2.18 and 3.x Fix regression in Legend Composer :
	PR 7260
Message-ID: <ad63a38b-0abf-65ef-89b5-798c16a66019@gmail.com>

Hi Dev,

I have proposed to fix a regression in Legend Composer for release-2_18 
and in release-3_x. This feature is probaby not well known by QGIS devs 
and users because it has never been documented.

In QGIS 2.0, I have introduced the capability to use the layer's title 
as the default layer legend name. This feature has been introduced to do 
not have to rename manually all the legend layers item in composer eahc 
time a legend is added in a composer or the layer is added.

As a QGIS user, when I load layers in my project, from Shapefiles, Gpkg 
or PostgreSQL, I do not rename them in the layer panel (the "legend") 
because I like to see the real source name. For example I keep 
"main_roads" instead of renaming to "Main roads". In this context, I 
like to use the metadata "title" property as a replacement. Inside the 
composer, I would like to have the titles used, because my exported PDF 
is for my colleague and not me.

So do you think, this regression has to befixed or not ?

	layer variables in Qgis3
Message-ID: <68E7E61D-5BBE-4C3E-B340-0DC0B2E5454F@3liz.com>

Hi

I'm trying to set custom layers variables from processing using  QgsExpressionContextUtils.setLayerVariables to destination layers , I have found that those variables does not appear in 
Qgis. 

I have found that when the layer is inserted in the current project (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/Postprocessing.py#L81 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/Postprocessing.py#L81>) the layer variables are removed - Checking existence of the variable before
and after the call of 'addMaperLayer' shows that layer variables are removed from custom properties.

I cannot tell if this is a bug or not because it seems that the removal may occurs in some signal handler. So if somebody has some clues to where to look, I will be grateful.


Qgis version: 3.0.3-Girona

Just found out that this is not addMapLayer that remove the variables but 'layer.loadNamedStyle'

Print layer.customProperty('variableNames') just before calling 'layer.loadNamedStyle' show variables
Print layer.customProperty('variableNames') just after the call :  empty list

Reproduced in the python console:

>>> QgsExpressionContextUtils.setLayerVariable(layer,'FOO','BAR')
>>> layer.customProperty('variableNames')
['FOO']
>>> layer.loadNamedStyle('mystyle.qml')
('', True)
>>> layer.customProperty('variableNames')
[]

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qt 6 plans
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash3eRrftifVm3QGCuMeNdJQUvoV2maHPrAEN1H_Dp8x1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

The Qt project have recently been discussing plans for the next major
release (Qt 6). This blog post is a summary of their current plans:

https://tsdgeos.blogspot.com/2018/06/qt-contributor-summit-2018.html

It all seems quite good from a QGIS perspective, and unlikely to be as
large a porting effort as Qt 5 was.

If their time frame of November 2020 for a first release is kept (and
we wait for Qt 6 for QGIS 4.0) then we'd be probably be looking
roughly at a late 2021-mid 2022 timing for QGIS 4.0. (Put it in your
calendars now so you don't forget to install the new version.)

What about putting some qgis.ics calendar file on qgis.org, so you can
put all Qt/QGIS/Grass/* releases, hackfests... from now until 2050 into
your calendar ;-)

Hi René-Luc,

Thank you for bringing up this topic.

I think there are a few things to consider here:

 - This might break working 2.18 workflows, where in the legend is
   currently labelled with the name and not the title. The question here
   is, what's more important, not breaking working 2.18 projects or
   having a 0-work migration path from 2.14. This is the main question
   concerning merging this into 2.18.

For merging into 3.0, the questions are different ones.

 - Is it a requirement that QGIS needs to be able to use different names
   in the layer tree than the ones used as the printing default?
   Currently the table name is visible on the tooltip and in the general
   tab.

   - If yes, would it be more appropriate to define this on application
     level, that you'd like to use table names rather than the name in
     the layer tree.

   - Is it appropriate and transparent to the user, that information
     from the metadata tab is used to override the name? At the moment
     this is as far as I know a unique behavior within QGIS to use meta-
     data for this kind of thing and the behavior is quite obscure.

Thanks again for raising this discussion
Matthias

Hi David,

this sounds like a bug, so I would say: create an issue with clear steps
so others can reproduce/fix.... BUT I cannot reproduce. Doing your steps
I see 'FOO' is just saved in the project file (and viewable after
unzipping the qgz file)....
And even after loading the qml and restartnig QGIS it is there.

I also am not sure what the exact purpose of
QgsExpressionContextUtils.setLayerVariable
would be, if I want stuff to be saved in project file I use:
layer.setCustomProperty('FOO', 'BAR')
and to retreive it:
layer.customProperty('FOO', '')

But, maybe others can tell something about this.
I use QGIS self build on Debian:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4790747aea

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi David,

Variables are a part of QML / Layer Style. There is a QEP open about
handling of this:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/125

While variables are not explicitly mentioned in there, it would be good
to treat them in the same way. I.e. allow exporting and importing QML
files without variables. This should allow to export and subsequently
load a style without variables being embedded.
Would be great if you could add a comment to the QEP.

Thanks
Matthias

Hi,

Yes, that's the point. I was surprised by the fact that those variables where stored as part of the exported qml file. 

I was trying to set those variable in processing algorithm so that I could achieve some parametrization of the style associated with the processing output, but no luck
since the qml  overwrite them when loaded in the layer.

Message-ID: <CA+qEb=1a2HiFeBh4zdSnF__WD2bV2UX_G_4+G7mTFdomDpA5-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm looking for a way to enable "Add polygon" tool from the editing toolbar
using PyQGIS (v3) - so the 4th icon from the left. This way when I press a
button in my plugin, I'd have a cursor ready to draw features, instead of
having to manually click the icon. I tried setting the map tool to
QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing, but it's not the way.



Is there a way to do it?

Best regards
Adam Borczyk

Hi,

I've raised the question [0] but I did get no answer two weeks later so
making a wider call

Select a polyline layer and toggle it to edit
Draw a polyline
Configure the snapping options
Enable the tracing tool and add a positive value in the offset option box
Draw a new line following the one previously made

According to all the sources I find (PR, .h file): """ *Offset value can be
either positive (right side) or negative (left side)*."""

Is the line being drawn at the right or the left? Right or left of what,
btw?
In my conception, it's drawn on the left, considering the direction i'm
moving the mouse.
Am I wrong? Am I mistaking my left and my right or is it in the source doc
that the error lies?

[0] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2155

Thanks for any input.

Regards,
Harrissou

It should be left/right when looking from the direction of the
original line. So for example if the original line goes from bottom to
the top, the left/right side should be the same as the map
orientation, but if the line goes from the top to the bottom, then the
left/right side would be reversed...

I draw a line from bottom to top
then I snap to the lower point and trace with a positive offset: the new
line is placed on the left side of the screen (should it? Positive value
goes right), and coincidentally the left of the tracing direction.
If I snap to the higher point and trace with the positive value: the new
line is placed on the right side of the screen, and coincidentally still
the left of the tracing direction.

It looks like it has not to do with the _direction of the original line_
but with the direction of the trace. And that positive value rather goes to
left (unlike doc statement)

Sorry to bother with what may look like details but...

Thanks,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Identify [feature] tagged reports that are not
	worth documenting
Message-ID: <CAECJsSoEPQxJpSFkCFXuqjUkgOROYgRDLFVyX2r5pVNxqkXp6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The [FEATURE] tagged pull-requests are used to advertize devs of a new
feature but also populate both doc issue repo and changelog.
While the automatic issue report is really really great, not all the
[features] implementations are worth mentioning in the user manuals,
sometimes because it's a low-level feature eg and has interest only for the
changelog.
The side effect is that we end up with a growing queue in the doc repo and
i'm afraid that in the doc team we do not have all the background (I'm
referring at least to myself) to always quickly identify (and understand)
whether a feature needs documentation or should be closed as unresolved.
You can find an introductory list at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/labels/ToDocOrNotToDoc%3F (still
incomplete as it needs someone to browse the list and weigh the interest of
the report - your opinion is btw welcome on those)

I guess, you devs might have some more ideas whether a feature you are
writing may be of interest in user doc. So could we imagine another tag eg
[no-docs] that will be added to the list of automatic issue triggers?
Actually it'll only be used along the [feature] tag to indicate that it's a
new feature (for changelog or whatever) but do not waste your time on
trying to write about in docs.

Does it sound a workable proposal? Anything better?

Cheers,
Harrissou

Hi,

Congratulations to all the cleaners! I can see that GitHub had for a moment
reported 32 issues today and I'm pretty sure it'll go lower.

When Nyall launched this "32 by 3.2" operation, I laughingly suggested to
some people that in the Doc repo we also tried a "320 by 3.2" operation. We
were at 400 issue reports so you agree that 32 was not a realistic target.
320 was neither sure given the low traffic in the repo. But I'm glad to
announce that we also did it thanks to the turbo contributions of these
last days. A big "Thank you" to writers and reviewers!

However, it's not finished and you can help us improve this situation and
set what would be considered as the upper limit of issue reports in 3.4
period: comment whether the issues at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/labels/ToDocOrNotToDoc%3F
deserve a documentation or not.

Greetings,
Harrissou

Sorry for the confusion - I have checked again and you are right:
- direction is determined from the traced line (not the original line
orientation)

Message-ID: <CABPxTTqjbfL66N66B5Mtg=KLja75tt0D0Z-d75r3TCJsWAN8UQ@mail.gmail.com>

Sometime in the last several months something changed such that trying to
pip install any package in the OSGeo4W shell gives this error message.

C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python27\lib\site-packages\pip\_vendor\urllib3\util\ssl_.py:137:
InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This
prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain
SSL connections to fail. You can upgrade to a newer version of Python to
solve this. For more information, see
https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings
  InsecurePlatformWarning

At the FOSS4G NA workshop we had this problem and just used whl packages
and manually installed them.

Is there a good procedure to fix this problem without having to manually
install packages? I see a number of references when I do a google search,
but I have not been successful except for manual installation.

Thanks,

Calvin

Guess you didn't try the experimental packages - I just promoted them.

Good idea! I had a quick look at the queue and closed some stuff.

I noticed there's a lot of open auto tickets caused by API additions
which are marked as [feature]. These are features in a sense, but
don't need documenting (outside of the regular code documentation). I
wonder if it would be worthwhile introducing a "[no-docs]" tag which
could be used alongside "[feature]" to avoid the auto-opened ticket?

Yep - we're now floating around the 32 +/- 4 mark, depending on the
time of day. I think we can declare this campaign a success and all
have a virtual beer together!  Seriously, this is a tremendous effort
consider that we had > 150 open requests just a short while ago. It
presents us much better as a friendly, welcoming project who value new
contributions.

So where to from here? I've given it some thought, and here's my
current thinking:

- I'd love to see us get below 25 open PRs (so that they fit on a
single page on GitHub), but honestly I think it's probably not a
realistic (or even desirable) goal for a project the size of QGIS.
Maintaining a queue size of between 30-40 open requests is an
achievable target IMO. It's small enough to be able to track them all
without any being neglected.

- I think we need some target goals in regards to PR timing. My ideas are:

a. Aim to have some comment on every PR at least every 2 weeks. Either
a "gentle ping" from others requesting a progress report, or a "I'm
still working on this, here's where it currently stands" by the
original submitter.

b. Close long-standing feature PRs which aren't actively being worked
on, with the understanding that the submitter can re-open when they
recommence work on the feature. An open, stagnant PR doesn't add any
value to the project and instead causes stress to project maintainers
and detracts from timely feedback and reviews of other active PRs.
We've also seen good results recently from closing stagnant PRs -
specifically the oauth2 PR which was closed without merging quickly
saw someone step up to fund the remaining work and get this work
merged.

c. For new/infrequent contributors (e.g... not the usual crew. You
know who you are) aim to have SOME comment/feedback on new PRs within
24 hours. Specifically just a general comment like "Hey, this is great
work. There's a lot to review here so it will take some time for us to
perform a full review, but we'll do that as soon as possible" / "This
looks like a valuable bug fix, thanks! I'm not familiar with this area
of code, so will assign to @g-sherman for review" / "Thanks for this
valuable contribution. We'll review as soon as possible, but in the
meantime please have a look at the failing CI tests on Travis and ask
us if you have any questions on how to get them passing". There's
nothing more demotivating then sending through a PR to a project and
having zero feedback for lengthy time periods. If we can be diligent
about providing some fast initial comment I'm sure we'll see more new
contributors keep the motivation to contribute further to the project.

Hi,

Not really! In my suggestion [no-docs] was supposed to alert docs writers
so that they close the issue immediately. In yours, it blocks the creation
of the issue report, which is far better. ;)

And thanks for the impressive cleanup of the list.

I agree fully. How to implement this? IMHO, shared responsibility do not
work well for this kind of task. We had the same issue with plugin
management, with too many falling into cracks.
I believe we need a PR manager, who gives the initial feedback and
forward each PR to the most appropriate dev, or back to the proposer.
This boils down, as for other unsexy tasks, to how to motivate people.
Until now several people had taken one or more of them as a volunteer
work. Now we have some proposal to trade this kind of things with an
explicit sponsorship level. Other proposals will be most welcome.
In any case, it is clear that providing adequate motivation and
incentives is vital to the project, I'm not sure volunteering can last
forever and it can cover all our needs.
All best wishes.

I'm superhappy to see it was worth the effort and having the queue down
to a manageable size it feels indeed much better to review pull requests!

I am also taking this as an opportunity to reflect on the current state
of the project. I think we have seen an incredible improvement
concerning stability and processes recently. Pull requests are the
standard, the amount of unit tests and reliability of the CI
infrastructure is constantly improving, we have a very active reviewing
process (it's a nice job to learn and improve skills by the way, anyone
interested in helping here is welcome. It's worth getting started, just
pick your pull requests!). In short, we have done a leap forward!
A huge applause for the project which I think has proven to be mature
and ready for any infrastructure.

I'm also in favor of having some automation on the pull request in place
to make stalled pull requests move forward and closing them after a time
of inactivity. This will help to shift some of the responsibility away
from reviewers towards pull request authors, and if done in a polite way
clearly stating reasons and possible steps I think this does not have
any bad impact. Even more, it frees some resources on reviewer side
which may be better invested on active pull requests where motivation is
high to advance things.

If I am not wrong the proposal to trade things for sponsorship levels
has been scheduled for the next PSC meeting? I think this is a topic
which requires very careful evaluation!

Thanks
Matthias

Message-ID: <179229ac-c279-62ec-d433-e18caa268a93@opengis.ch>

Hi PSC,

We have seen some quite nice improvements in the recent past with the
visual changelog, the certification program and the sponsor map managed
on projecta.

I am not sure if changelog.qgis.org is the only DNS entry we have to
this host, it's at least the one that google delivers as first result here.

This feels a bit weird because

 - I think the finalized changelog goes to qgis.org, but the name
   changelog.qgis.org sounds like that's the authoritative one

 - For sponsors it's more or less the same question, there's a list on
   qgis.org and one on changelog.qgis.org.

 - As far as I know certification is only available on projecta, so at
   least for this it seems to be the main point of access.

I wonder what's the roadmap here, having projecta mostly as management
infrastructure for maintaining sponsorship, feature and certification
databases or if it's also something that should act as a frontend for
users. In the second case, are there any plans to move these to
dedicated subdomains?

And as a sidenote, it would be nice to have SSL enabled on the webservers :)

Thanks
Matthias

Hi all,

On behalf of the QGIS.ORG project, I'm extremely pleased to announce the
winning proposals for our 2018 QGIS.ORG grant programme. We managed to make
some more funds available to support more than the planned EUR 25,000.
Read all about the successful proposals here:

http://blog.qgis.org/2018/06/22/qgis-grant-programme-2018-results/

A number of interesting and useful proposal didn’t make it because of our
limited budget; we encourage organizations to pick up one of their choice
and sponsor it.

Regards,
Anita

Hi Users/Devs,

please everybody have a look at the upcoming list of features for 3.2:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.2.0/

If you think a Feature is interesting, you know something about it, OR
you want to learn something about it? Pick it up, adopt it, and add an
image or some more specific text.

My plan is to move the entries to the website within a couple of days
after the release of 3.2  (so very very soon...). And not wait untill
the changelog is filled.

If every user picks a  feature to create some screendump, it is done
within minutes ;-)

Regards & thanks for the help.

Since a few months ago, we added custom domain supports to the ‘projecta’ app we have built. That lets us host all the projects on one server instance but each project registering a custom domain can specify their own project or group of projects to be what is seen when you visit that domain. So while in the past you would see a bunch of different unrelated projects, you now see :

http://changelog.qgis.org -> goes straight to the QGIS projecta project
http://changelog.inasafe.org -> goes to the projecta landing page for InaSAFE (which then lists a few subprojects of InaSAFE)
http://changelog.kartoza.com -> goes to the generic landing page which any new project will be registered on
http://???? -> more to come in future


Although we built this platform based around the things we identified as useful for QGIS, we planned to make it generic enough that it can be used by other projects, with eventually a monetisation scheme (which QGIS will be exempt from) whereby we will charge a small transaction fee on donations, sponsorships, certificates etc. passing through the system. We already spent a LOT of time and money on building the platform and would like to have it funded so it can be sustainable into the future. The monetisation will be on top of the stripe commission fees which to participating projects will probably mean around an 8% overhead on transactions coming through the platform. That is more than the do-it yourself stripe approach but we feel the convenience of the platform makes that a good value proposition.

Everything is projecta is open source so QGIS could conceivably run it on its own infrastructure if you decide you don’t like something we are doing….and Richard already knows how to get an instance up and running….its not too hard.

Richard has already done an integration to automate the sponsorships going into projecta to appear on the QGIS.org sponsors page (via a feed that we provide on projecta for sponsors). We can do this because sponsors can be shown to users as static content.

Likewise for the changelogs there is a feed to grab them from projecta and (with a bit of massaging from Richard) incorporate them into QGIS.org. We probably want to keep this workflow because a) static pages are nice :-) and b) once in sphinx the changelogs can be translated using the same workflows as the rest of the site.

Certification is on projecta and I can’t see it going to a static site right now - In the future maybe when we have views for ‘upcoming courses near you’ and ‘find a training centre’ etc. we could probably pull these over but even that probably isnt worth it. We could probably tweak projecta to allow custom domains for a project’s certification page (e.g. https://certification.qgis.org).

The same for the lessons platform we build (see http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/section/list/ for all the new training materials we have been developing for QGIS) - we could be pulling this over to QGIS.org as static content and then incorporating into translation workflows there. We have also a translation framework for lessons on the platform, but it probably won’t scale well for many many languages.

SSL is on our roadmap for projecta,

We are also going to be rebranding it soon as http://prj.app (nothing to see there yet) with an on ramping process to make it easy for new projects to sign up.

We would be happy to tweak things to include custom domain support for other parts of the app e.g. http://lessons.qgis.org. There are also other interesting things that we built on the platform that never really got used - especially the quorum tool which lets you form teams in a project, make and record decisions (pre-dated loomio) and has a concencus model built in.

For QGIS.org I would suggest to generally keep things as you have it - pull static content onto the site and use projecta as backend where you prepare content. It is a ‘safe’ way to manage things since once content is static, there isnt much that can go wrong and we trade a few moving parts in the content preparation phase for basically no moving parts in the content delivery stage.

Hope that sheds some light on the big picture view of things from project’s side - and hopefully those with other published software will consider using Prj.app in the future to benefit from all the stuff we have built for QGIS.org and to help support us in maintaining the platform….

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I have finally made an application there can load and show a OSM in a
window as a standalone application both on windows and a raspberry pi
(compiled from source)

I had some issues getting the map showed correct.

This code here is working:
import sys
import os

if not os.name == 'nt':

sys.path.append('/home/pi/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python')

sys.path.append('/home/pi/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins')
    sys.path.append('/home/pi/apps/share/qgis/python/plugins')
    sys.path.append("/home/pi/apps/share/qgis/python")
    sys.path.append("/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/IPython/extensions")


from qgis.core import QgsApplication
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
from window_class import OurMainWindow
from graph_class import main_graph

if os.name == 'nt':
    os.environ["QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH"] = r"C:\Program Files\QGIS
3.0\apps\Qt5\plugins\platforms"
    os.environ["GDAL_DATA"] = r"C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.0\share\epsg_csv"
    data_file = r"C:\Users\Kasper\My Documents\LiClipse
Workspace\gis_test\source\kor_ind_mod_terminal.ood"
    QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(r"C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.0\apps\qgis",
True)
else:
    QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(r"/home/pi/apps", True)
    data_file = r"kor_ind_mod_terminal.ood"

app = QApplication([])
QgsApplication.initQgis()

gp = main_graph()
mw = OurMainWindow(gp,data_file)
mw.show()

app.exec_()
mw = None
QgsApplication.exitQgis()

However i am wondering why i have to use the QApplication([]) instead  app
= QgsApplication([]) ?

If i use the QgsApplication the map is not shown.

Could someone explain why and if it is the purpose.

Maybe some Path there is overwritten from system?

	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-Pxswo9f0fmrCSf4yoJ2Y-knJQ_XU3qzrYae92SRzxPZQDRA@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi All,

This is my report for Week 6 (June 18 - June 24):

*What did you get done this week?*
I had last week of my exams at my university, hence a progress in the
project is not big.


   - I continued with bug fixing in parser library (1)
   - Split GRASS module parameters in Processing plugin to tabs was

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] delimited text import still broken
Message-ID: <bc8c5915c59c24b1d04c3f312788cac5.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there,

sorry for bumping this, but it's really destroying incoming data.
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18601

CSV is a bad format, we all know that. But it's spread widely in
context of OpenData, since it's pure text.

Like stated in the issue, a quick work-around is to cast all incoming
fields to text. Then it's not destructive anymore.

A better approach is the one from Excel or LibreOffice and the XLSX
importer. It lets you choose the the field's type. New Excel also
supports reading the first 200 or 100% of the lines to identify the
type. It's better than some regex guessing based on a few head lines.

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi Tim,

Wow, thanks for the very detailed answer.

First, thanks a lot! The platform is extremely valuable and fills a
missing gap in the project. I'm glad to hear you have plans to build a
sustainable business model around it. If that helps to make it grow and
pays for its maintenance, that will improve the product.

Having Sponsorship and Changelog as static content (mirrored) and keep
certification dynamic sounds like a good plan.

Having either a proper subdomain like proposed here and/or (if not
feasible quickly) move the whole QGIS project to something like
project.qgis.org which is generic enough to serve for all the subparts,
that would be great. Especially since the main landing page for the
changelog is not projecta but the mirrored content on the qgis page, it
would be good to move things to a different subdomain. It would also be
nice to have a link on top of
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/ etc. that links to the
mirrored page, once it's there, so people landing on the projecta page
will be redirected to a translated and updated site on qgis.org.


The most important question I wanted to raise here is, how can we make
sure that customers landing on the certification page respect it as a
trustworthy platform. Things that come to my mind here

- Having another subdomain than changelog.qgis.org

- Having SSL (signed with qgis.org)

- Having a page design that matches qgis.org

- Having a link from qgis.org

Wow, that is looking good! It would be great to advertise this more!

Cool, not much to add from my side. I'm generally happy with the process
as long as a visitor can easily see where the "authoritative" version is
located and whenever the "authoritative" version of a framework is on
prj.app it appears trustworthy for a visitor.

It does, this platform has a big potential for QGIS but also for other
projects.

I think we can change this easily enough, project.qgis.org sounds like a nice name.

It would also be nice to have a link on top ofhttp://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/ <http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/> etc. that links to the mirrored page, once it's there, so people landing on the projecta page will be redirected to a translated and updated site on qgis.org.

Its on our road map.

Also on our road map to support theming though making it look 100% matched might give us some challenges.

Hi, 

I noticed at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingZanzibar2018#register
that noone is staying at the suggested Maru Maru hotel. 

I was going to book a room at Maru Maru, but wonder why no-one booked
there? Are they full, too expensive or not good? Why do the locals
recommend Maru Maru? 

If you don't stay in Maru Maru, what other hotel is recommended? It
probably would make sense if we don't spread out in too many hotels. 

Thanks for you information, 

Andreas

While I'm glad to see that the Training manual update has been retained as
2018 Grant Proposal (and I really appreciate how this has been managed by
the PSC and members), I'm afraid that once it's updated for 3.4, the next
round will be for 4.x (meaning that we have some stale lessons at a moment).
So if there's an ongoing work to provide a more modern, more uptodate and
maintainable, and more efficient lessons interface to the community, better
avoid spreading the project energy/time/money in different plans and focus
on what looks the best and future-proof option (in case it's).

PS: I didn't check how the lessons in projecta do work yet but these are
the questions that come to mind when I read your message. Maybe I'm totally
mixing things up, here.

Regards,
Harrissou

We have also a translation framework for lessons on the platform, but it probably won’t scale well for many many languages.

Basically the things you find in the lessons app are worksheets we developed for our own training courses. We tried to come up with a new approach where the worksheets are focussed on the learners doing things and figuring things out themselves and not so much ‘follow the bouncing ball’ instructions. The latter are ok but very hard to maintain and IMHO the learners don’t learn as much as when they have to work stuff out themselves more. The lessons are also much more intended to be instructor lead - you need a competent person guiding the learners through the materials and filling in extra bits of info beyond what is presented on the sheets. I’d be interested to hear feedback from those using them for self-study to see how they work for them, but that wasnt the design intent. We first started working doing the materials in libreoffice but it was very cumbersome dealing with docs in git. The original repo is here:

https://github.com/kartoza/QGISTrainingWorkshop

And you can get an idea of the intended structure of the worksheets here:

training-approach.pdf <https://github.com/kartoza/QGISTrainingWorkshop/blob/master/training-approach.pdf>

We wanted to make it so that each worksheet could be used independently and that it fits on two sides of an A4 sheet so that the activities are in nice bite-sized chunks. We devised a fairly tight structure to the sheets so that learners get the rythmn of the training and start to move through the materials easily. Another design intent was that we could quickly assemble courses customised to the user’s needs. So if a group wants to focus on digitising we can pull out a set of sheets relating to that topic area. We have run quite a few training courses with these (and we made similar sheets for InaSAFE) and they work pretty well for us and, once they grasp the fact that they are not being spoon fed, most of our learners feedback say they enjoy using their brain more during the training. Each lesson has an exercise with a list of specifications. We really try to avoid making particular reference to Gui elements, and rather give instructions like ‘open the vector layer properties and set your line thickness to 4pt, colour to red and opacity to 50%’. This makes the content less vulnerable to a dev tidying up the UI and breaking all the documentation for it, and makes it more fun for the learner to hunt around in the Gui for the different options. We didnt always succeed completely in avoiding specific Gui references but we try our best to do so.

One of the other motivations for shifting to the web is to make it easier for people to get the content formatted nicely - the lessons are created using as structured form that asks for different elements (intro, further reading etc.) and then we assemble the content into the lesson layout. You can also use markdown in the lesson content for basic styling. We have some work in progress to have a ‘curriculum designer’ that will let you tick off one ore more sheets on a form and assemble your own PDF and unique URL with your curriculum so that when you present a course you can link to the sheets being used for the course. At some point it would be nice to link this to the certification app too so that you can say ‘Joe did our course and it covered these modules’.

I don’t know if our approach will work for everyone, but if others are interested to use the platform for QGIS everything we made is open content and the platform is open so feel free to use it - and if you are interested contribute new content. If QGIS.ORG as a whole is interested in making it an official part of the project (e.g. to replace our old training manual work) that is fine with us too - though we dont have the same level of coverege for QGIS as the manual has yet. Also we would probably want to move the translation system into QGIS.ORG sphinx since it will probably be tedious to support ~26 languages or whatever the count we have currently in QGIS.ORG. If anyone wants edit rights to tweak and improve what you see in the lessons app, just pop me a note and I will give you the needed access.

I hope that gives a better background, and thanks to Etienne Trimaille, Ismail Sunni, Rohmat Muhammad, Alison Mukoma and Anita Hapsari who are great examples of people that you may not have heard of who are working away to make cool stuff for QGIS :-)

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Merge of shapefiles to GPKG fails
Message-ID: <434c595e-99fb-248a-5c21-0ce8a39daf9e@gmail.com>

I have saved a shapefile to a GPKG and I want to merge some other 
shapefiles into the GPKG using the Data Management Tools -> Merge Vector 
Layers feature.

The existing GPKG is used as one of the source layers and the other 
layers are SHP. The merged layer is created as a temporary layer.

The merge proceeds as expected but when attempting to save the merged 
layer to a new GPKG it fails because the fid fields in the merged 
shapefiles have not been set to a value and contain nulls. If the values 
are copied and pasted from a shapefile to a GPKG these values are 
automatically generated as should be the case for the merge tool.

I want to use the merge tool because copying and pasting between layers 
constantly freezes. However it seems there is a problem with the merge 
tool because the values of the fid field are not being auto-generated.

Hi Andreas,
thanks for raising this point. I agree it is preferrable to be together
in the same hotel. As for me, I didnt book yet, waiting for others to
converge on one choice, so I'llbe happy to follow te crowd.
All the best.

For me I didn’t use that place because I found a cheaper place nearby:

Beyt-al-salaam Boutique Hotel

I will add it to the wiki page.

Continuing my quest for QGIS ETL perfection, I have a few more questions:

1) Is there a way of selecting output from multiple algorithms as input for
an algorithm? In the drop down list, I can only select one input source and
I often want to use more than one.

2) I want to adjust lower/upper attribute string values. I can of course use
upper/lower functions in the Field Calculator but what if I want to change
"firstname lastname" to "Firstname Lastname"? Is there a way of changing
only the first character in each word?

3) Is there a way of splitting an attribute with a specific character? For
example, I might want to split an attribute with '>' and set an upper limit
for how many new attributes may be created by this operation, in case the
input attribute contains more than one '>'. This seems hard to do with the
Field Calculator, where I have to specify the name and data type of a single
new attribute.

4) Continuing on #3: Why do I have to specify the data type inside a model?
Shouldn´t that be a task when writing the output? Before that, the user
shouldn´t have to think about data types.

Regards,

Magnus

Just some extra thoughts from a colleague on what might be needed to replace
FME with Processing:

"I use the modeler quite a lot and I must admit I find myself typing in the
model canvas expecting to see a list of processing tools come up like they
do in FME sometimes. GUI improvements and customisation for the modeler
would be lovely.

"As for functionality priorities it is probably easier to identify what QGIS
currently cannot do? for example modeler cannot reference PostGIS/database
layers that are not in the project AFAIK, whilst it can reference flat file
sources. That would be essential."

Perhaps open tickets for these suggestions as well? It would be great to get
additional processing improvements into 3.4 LTR.

Anybody else seeing this?

Looks like there is a problem with the "final" keyword, probably in
combination with some older versions of sip.

I'm traveling so I don't have the possibility to fix this timely, I'm sorry.

This works, if the algorithm accepts multiple layers. E.g. merge
vector layers, package layers, etc. It doesn't work for algorithms
which work on a single input layer (e.g. buffer).

Both these could be done by the "Refactor fields" algorithm.

Can you elaborate?

Cool, this will already look a lot better. If https is enabled on this
domain, that would even already look quite professional I think :-)

And +1 to all the additional comments further down in the mail.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Several Processing Plugin Questions
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqrR5uYhtM13w8ycYqkE2gaNKy6paOi-o8kwhnhzxkd6w@mail.gmail.com>

1. For the QgsProcessingAlgorithm you define 'name', 'displayName',
'group', and 'groupId'. The group creates a sub folder within my processing
toolbox. What if I don't want a group sub folder within my toolbox. How do
I have the algorithm on the first level?

2. I am working on this for Shape Tools and not all the tools will be
processing algorithms. I would like to be able to call the processing
algorithm from my Shape Tools menu. I see no reason to programmatically
create two interfaces for the algorithm. How can I launch the processing
algorithm from the menu.

Thanks,

Calvin Hamilton

Hi Matthias,

Now I have this one:

I'm not sure if it is in anyway helpfull to let this know here, as I do
not dare to fix this myself...
But maybe others are trying to compile and fail also.

If devs prefer that I make an issue of these, just let me know.

Hi Richard,

Can you try changing the `!= 't'` to `!= QLatin1String( "t" )` and open
a PR if that solves the issue? I assume a compiler or old Qt version
compatibility issue.

And concerning the "is it appropriate to post here", I can't answer this
question, but in cases like here, where a particular line number in a
file is mentioned, it's often very efficient to comment on this line on
github, since the person in charge of the change will be notified right
away.

Cheers

Matthias

Hi Matthias,

Thanks, Even Roualt just fixed.

I'm on Debian testing: Qt 5.7.1

That's not possible in <=3.2. I'm refactoring the toolbox currently,
I'll add support for this for 3.4.

> 2. I am working on this for Shape Tools and not all the tools will be processing algorithms. I would like to be able to call the processing algorithm from my Shape Tools menu. I see no reason to programmatically create two interfaces for the algorithm. How can I launch the processing algorithm from the menu.

Call either

    # populate with parameters you want to show in the dialog, if you
want non-default values
    initial_parameters = {}
    results = processing.execAlgorithmDialog('qgis:buffer', initial_parameters)

Or

    # populate with parameters you want to show in the dialog, if you
want non-default values
    initial_parameters = {}
    dlg =  processing.createAlgorithmDialog('qgis:buffer', initial_parameters)
    # do something with dlg

The difference is that execAlgorithmDialog handles automatically
showing the dialog and return the algorithm results, while
createAlgorithmDialog leaves it up to you to show and execute the
dialog and retrieve the results.

Hi,
I would like to know is there any ongoing work on adding export as python
to Graphical Modeler section in 3.X.
I am interested in this feature.
If possible I would try to contribute too.

I'm not aware of any work going on in this regard, but I'll help
mentor if you want to tackle it.

Hi guys,

I'm also having issues compiling latest master on both Fedora 27 and Fedora
28 since https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7319 has been merged.

I'm getting this error:

[ 70%] Linking CXX shared library ../../output/lib64/libqgis_3d.so
BUILDSTDERR:
CMakeFiles/qgis_3d.dir/terrain/qgsdemterraintilegeometry_p.cpp.o: In

BUILDSTDERR: make: *** [Makefile:155: all] Error 2


It's always reproducible and it happens with both make -j20 and make -j1. I
was able to reproduce it locally and on a remote builder, see
https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/dani/qgis-testing/fedora-28-x86_64/00772119-qgis/build.log.gz
Do you have any hint? I'm running Qt 5.10, cmake 3.11 and gcc 8.1.1

Many thanks,
Daniele

I was able to identify why it's failing when building packages, but not on
QGIS Travis and/or when making a simple compilation from git: hardening!

Packages on Fedora are built with gcc hardening set (this is usually
required by packaging policies). Unfortunately Travis is not testing this
environment. I added a full description of the problem here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7319#issuecomment-401261273

This problem may affect other distributions, like SuSE. Not sure about
Ubuntu/Debian, but I would expect hardening enabled by default also on them
nowadays.

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <16b601b5-edf1-e934-5108-120d90ad4ccd@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I have two QGIS 2.18: one compiled from source and one standard deb
package, on Debian Sid. In the first one the Lizmap plugin works well,
while in the self compiled on I get an error at startup:
ImportError: cannot import name QgsCodeEditorHTML
There is a ticket on the plugin bugtracker:
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-plugin/issues/55
but no real explanation.
Does anyone have an idea?
Thanks.

Hi!

I have 3 layers in my qgis project. The first is called correct_crs(vektor), second and third are satellite images (raster) from sentinel band 4 and band 8.
I want to calculate with these pictures the ndvi via python in a script. I produced following code - - > https://pastebin.com/dpLK6DnW

My problem is that "calc.processCalculation()" returns memory error - 5 (early it returned parse error - 4). And I don't know how to handle such error

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Updating qgis:rastercalculator to work better in
	models
Message-ID: <CAOJAE5oNFJ2szeV+HtKCz2V1NyqKiAFuG_bWSwKa45Ft4pnTqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to make some updates to qgis:rastercalculator in processing
to make it work better in models. The raster calculator evaluates
expressions based on the source file name. The problem with using this
in the model builder is that the file names are not always known up
front.

The list of layers in the expression widget are of class
QgsProcessingModelChildParameterSource, so I'm trying to figure out
how to set an appropriate source name for different situations.

1. The layer is an input parameter
In this case there's no way to know the source name up front, but it
could be approximated by lyr.parameterName(). This assumes that the
parameterName and the source name of the layer are the same. It's a
bit of a stretch, but I can't think of a better way to do it.

2. The layer is an anonymous layer output by another algorithm
In this case the name of the output file can be known for certain from
lyr.outputName(). This adds another problem though, since most
algorithms have the same outputName ('OUTPUT'). I have worked around
this by adding an incrementing number to the end of the index (i.e.
OUTPUT, OUTPUT1, OUTPUT2, etc.). It's not perfect but at least then
there would be a viable way to build expressions with multiple inputs.

3. The layer is a named output from another algorithm
If the algorithm has a named output, then the source file name would
be a predictable composite of lyr.outputChildId() and the 'Parameter
name'. I expected to get this from lyr.outputName() once set, but it
seems that outputName is not updated (it remains OUTPUT for most
algorithms). Is there some other way to get the 'Parameter name'
string from QgsProcessingModelChildParameterSource (or some other
way)?

Handling these three situations would improve the situation, but it's
still a bit clunky (and complicated for users to understand). Another
option would be to forego the source() names altogether, and use an a,
b, c notation like many of the other raster calculators do. The
challenge then is to have the layer identifiers in the expression
builder match the layer identifiers that are passed to
QgsRasterCalculator. One way to achieve this would be to have the
'Layers' list in the expression builder show only layers that are
selected as 'Reference layers'. That way, only the layers that are
passed to Raster Calculator as parameters could be included in the
expressions, and there can be a consistent referencing pattern whether
you are using it as a standalone algorithm or in a model. I'm just not
sure how to get the list of selected Reference layers from inside
ExpressionWidgetWrapper. If there's interest in reworking it in this
way and somebody can point me in the right direction I'd be happy to
give it a go.

Some background to this here: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19302

Kind regards,
Rudi
