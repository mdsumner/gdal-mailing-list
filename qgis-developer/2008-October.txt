If we remove them more people than you believe will complain. But I
agree we should mark dead links so that people dont waste time trying
to download stuff that no longer exists.... Legacy downloads that live
on osgeo server should remain there in perpetuity..or server
catastrophy....

Message-ID: <d368056f0810021445k20f070dcqb3e38014e840bee2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

If you cast your mind back to our feature plans for QGIS 1.0, one
sorely needed improvement is a better labelling engine. During the
FOSS4G conference, I came across just such a project [1] where they
have implemented just such a labelling engine in C++. This api also
has a JNI interface and has been used in sextant / gvSIG via an
extension (see [2]). Martin I know you had plans to do some work in
this area - have you started anything yet?

Since 1.0 will promise a stable API, and we have a golden opportunity
here to incorporate proper labelling before we finalise the 1.0 API, I
would like to propose that we revoke the feature freeze termporarily
in order to allow us to incorporate the work of the PAL library.
Marco and I will look at the feasibility of incorporating the PAL
library into QGIS, and what kind of effect it would have on the API
during the FOSS4G code sprint on saturday.

What do others think?

Regards

I must say I'm impressed by this project. Looking at the slides from
foss4g presentation, it looks they've implemented quite a lot from the
things I would implement by myself and even in the way I wanted to do
it too (e.g. they're referencing A. Wolff's combinatorial approach).

I haven't started with labeling implementation, I've just considered
doing that for my master thesis... but it looks like I'll have to
search for another topic :-)

Incorporating PAL would be probably a good step forward. But I can
imagine that we could do that also as an incremental change - although
that would mean that we keep the old labeling engine in place.

One thing I'm affraid of is the license - GPLv3. Any ideas about v2
and v3 compatibility?

Hi Tim.
I agree QGIS cannot be "sold" as a real desktop GIS without proper
labelling, so I would be very much in favour of including the engine you
suggest (provided it is feasible to include it in a reasonable time frame).
One thing I do not see (but it's implemented in Mapserver) is the
"follow" option, where labels are allowed not to be on a straight line,
but they follow a curve. Do the devs of PAL have plans to include it?
All the best.

+1, if your investigation at the code sprint reveals it can be done in  
a reasonable time frame.

Interesting, but sounds like a it needs some man-hours. What's the time 
frame?

As a side question, is there possibilit to have labels manually placed 
and position saved in QGis?

So the idea would be based on our discussions with them (PAL) tomorrow
we could see if any API changes are required. If API changes are
required my proposal would be to do it now before 1.0 release so that
we can live up to our promise of a stable long supported API. However
if it looks like it will be feasible to do it with no API changes, my
feeling would also be to slot it in as a new feature for 1.1.

If I recall correctly, the demonstration they showed (based on gvsig)
had a 'free' mode that followed features - they had quite a few other
options for tweaking label placement behaviour. I'll follow this up
with them tomorrow.

I was also thinking about this. We will have quite a bit of
flexibility in this regard I think since the label placement lib need
not be passed all labels. To explain better: if a user uses e.g. a
table attribute to fix the label to a specific location, we could
consider the bounding box of the label a 'feature' that other labels
need to place themselves around....once again we will probably have a
better idea about the possibility of doing this after tomorrow.

Other thing for discussion is that PAL is using GEOS C++ API so that
back before qgis geos C API port...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] coordinate capture plugin with QGIS dataset
Message-ID: <20081005100346.73f8fd1a@nature>

Hi, 

I wanted to create an example for the coordinate capture plugin and had a
problem with the alaska dataset [1]. The data are projected in Albers Equal Area
with unit meters (EPSG 2964).

PROJCS["NAD_1927_Albers",
    GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1927",
	DATUM ["D_North_American_1927",
	     SPHEROID["Clarke_1866", 6378206.4,294.9786982]],
	     PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
	     UNIT["Degree", 0.0174532925199433]],
    PROJECTION["Albers"],
    PARAMETER["False_Easting", 0.0],
    PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],
    PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-154.0],
    PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1", 55.0],
    PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",65.0],
    PARAMETER ["Latitude_Of_Origin",50.0],
    UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

As far as I understand the procedure inside the plugin is:

- define the correct projection for the alaska data (EPSG 2964) in the project
properties dialog and activate OTF
- load an alaska dataset layer
- start the plugin and define another projection in the first row (click to
select the CRS...) e.g. WGS84 (EPSG 4326)
- click on the coordinate capture icon and click somewhere on the canvas to grep
some coordinates

=> first row should show the lat/lon WGS84 values and the second row EPSG 2964
coordinates for the alaska dataset. This does usually work fine for other
projections but not for the alaska dataset. I found this problem in the QGIS
forum as well but it doesn't seem to be solved:
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1384

There is probabaly something wrong with the projection definition of EPSG 2964.
A new parameter as far as I remember is +to_meter=0.3048006096012192, before it
was simply +units=m.

any help from projection experts is welcome :-)...

thanks,
 Otto

We also had a few requests regarding labeling on the INTERGEO qgis booth
- and someone else filed a bug about this meanwhile.

I have attached a patch for #1335 that adds scale based label visibility
and line oriented labels, which might add or interfere with the libpal
integration.

Regarding the GEOS C++ API:  porting libpal to the C-API doesn't seem
that hard, so that shouldn't be a (technical) problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feature count don't increase
Message-ID: <E1KmquQ-00043k-Rj@web02.mi6.kiev.ua>

Hi, all!
After learning sources of some Python plugins I'm a bit understood with process of adding new features to the vector layer. Here is my code

lstFeatures = []
lstLayers = []
self.layermap = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
for (name, layer) in self.layermap.iteritems():
	lstLayers.append(name)
vLayer = self.layermap[lstLayers[0]]
# for debug: show feature count before adding
#QMessageBox.information(self.iface.getMainWindow(), "Debug", str(vLayer.featureCount()))
provider = vLayer.getDataProvider()
provider.reset()
ft = QgsFeature()
geom = QgsGeometry.fromPloygon([lstCoord])
ft.setGeometry(geom)
lstFeatures.append(ft)
# commit changes
provider.addFeatures(lstFeatures)
self.iface.getMapCanvas.refresh()
# for debug: show feature count after adding
#QMessageBox.information(self.iface.getMainWindow(), "Debug", str(vLayer.featureCount()))

It's work fine for me - features appears on map and in attribute table. But exists two problems:
1. After adding, feature count don't changes. Why? I do something wrong or skip something?
2. After adding I want see all features (old and new), so it's nessesary update "overview" window and zoom to full extent of working layer. But
 
self.iface.getMapCanvas.updateOverview()
self.iface.getMapCanvas.updateFullExtent()

don't work. As far as i understood this is result of previous problem. If feature count has no changes, so extent also don't change. What i need to do for solve this problems?

Best regards,
 Alexander Bruy

Yes, I try to use vLayer.commitChanges() and vLayer.updateFeatureCount(),
but this take no effect. Code is:

lstFeatures = []
lstLayers = []
self.layermap = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
for (name, layer) in self.layermap.iteritems():
	lstLayers.append(name)
vLayer = self.layermap[lstLayers[0]]
# for debug: show feature count before adding
#QMessageBox.information(self.iface.getMainWindow(), "Debug", str(vLayer.featureCount()))
provider = vLayer.getDataProvider()
provider.reset()
ft = QgsFeature()
geom = QgsGeometry.fromPloygon([lstCoord])
ft.setGeometry(geom)
lstFeatures.append(ft)
# commit changes
provider.addFeatures(lstFeatures)
self.iface.getMapCanvas.refresh()
#vLayer.commitChanges()
vLayer.updateFeatureCount()
# for debug: show feature count after adding
#QMessageBox.information(self.iface.getMainWindow(), "Debug", str(vLayer.featureCount()))

>From http://spatialserver.net:3001/ I download qgsAzimuth.zip archieve with plugin and test it: create new feature and try to zoom to full extent of the layer. New feature appears on map and in attribute table, but feature count don't increase too.
?an it is related to that addition takes place through "qgsDataProvider" not throught "QgsVectorLayer"?

Possibly:

Looking back at some code of my own, I see that I have used 
vlayer.updateExtents() after using provider.addFeatures([feature_list]). 
This was for use with a vector layer based on the memory provider, but 
since it is also a QgsVector layer, it may be the same?

Although, based on the test below, this appears to be 'fixed'/not 
nessesasry in QGS 1.0.0:
 >>> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
 >>> layer = mc.getZpos(0) # Grabs the first map layer in the TOC
 >>> layer.featureCount()
88
 >>> provider = layer.dataProvider()
 >>> provider.name() # just a quick check to make sure we have a valid 
provider
ogr
 >>> fet = QgsFeature()
 >>> provider.getNextFeature(fet)
True
 >>> geom = QgsGeometry(fet.geometry()) # use this to create a valid 
QgsGeometry
 >>> feat = QgsFeature()
 >>> feat.setGeometry(geom)
 >>> provider.addFeatures([feat]) # add the feature with the 
're'-created geometry
(True, [<qgis.core.QgsFeature object at 0x98037ec>])
 >>> layer.featureCount()
89

Let me know how you get on,

Carson

This icon file was renamed in rev 9444 and 9445, so the above 
cmake_install.cmake seems to be not reconfigured after then.

Odd, running ccmake to reconfigure and generate didn't fix this. I had  
to blow away my build directory and reconfigure to solve it.

You need to regenerate the Makefiles using cmake to get around this.

Some dependencies contain * instead of a list of filenames. Since adding 
or deleting a file doesn't involve editing a CMakeLists.txt file, cmake 
doesn't know it has to regenerate the Makefiles.

I have no idea how to specify this rule but when * is used in a rule, 
thee should be another rule that states the list generated from * 
depends on the modification date of the directory containing *.

The ui files, image files and grass modules are places where I have 
encountered this message but there could be others.

Hi all,

I recently used QGIS quite a lot and I am really impressed! I did
encounter some issues though (Windows 2000, with QGIS 0.11):

    * digitizing: when the digitizing toolbar is detached, the tooltips
      vanished
    * digitizing: sometimes new points get added to polygons when moving
      a point (this might as well be intended behaviour, but can be
      annoying)
    * digitizing: when the map is being panned by the keyboard,
      sometimes the currently selected element is suddenly invisible
    * digitizing: the placement of the label can be very confusing. In
      the case of multigeometries I would suggest adding a label to all
      members / parts of the geometry
    * digitizing: a feature request: It would be perfect if one could
      configure the attribute-field  that gains focus, when digitizing
      of a new feature stops. Currently all attributes show up and no
      field gets focused

I did not submit the above as bugs to the qgis trac since I know that I
am rather unprecise at some of the issues (I'm recovering the bugs from
notes I took on a sheet of paper weeks ago)

Keep the good work up!

Regards,
Marc

Hi Marc.
Several of your notes are already on the trac; please check and add
others if appropriate.
You may also check the upcoming version (1.0 preview 1) to see if they
still apply.

This plugin has not been updated to the latest API. In this case, 
addPluginMenu should be updated to addPluginToMenu.
Perhaps the author of this plugin could update it?
I imagine there will be many updates once the final QGIS 1.0.0 has been 
released...

Paolo, 

The installer blocks incompatible repositories _except_ the "official" one. 
This one contains mostly plugins for 0.x, but there and also few plugins for 
1.x. When we open the new repository for 1.x, this one will be of corse 
blocked in QGIS 1.0 and leaved for 0.x.

Hi all.
I noticed our plugin "arpat" is no longer working; probably API have

I can upgrade the plugin, but then it will be compatible with trunk and
no longer with preview1, I suppose.
Any hint?

Yes.  http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/9449

I don't think the plugin upgrade will fix this.  The plugin probably
wasn't updated in the repository yet - and as there are probably more
api cleanups underway, there's not much point in doing it now anyway.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin repositories for 1.0
Message-ID: <200810081448.50335.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hello Everybody,

It's high time to provide the plugin repositories for 1.x. In the last months 
Tim, Otto and I was writing about that and have received no objection, so I 
understand everybody agree we should create two repositories: 
- the official one: moderated, supported, and enabled by default 
- the unsupported open sandbox or "waiting-room", just like the present 
repository.

I found the most reliable solution is to leave the present one exclusively for 
0.x and create the pair of repositories for 1.x. The installer is ready to 
handle them all (to automatically switch from the old one to the new pair 
after qgis upgrade and to suggest user the update of all plugins).

So I imagine we need to:
1. open the two new repositories and point the installer to them
2. move existing plugins for 1.0 to the new sandbox
3. ask plugin authors to update their 0.x plugins and put them to the sandbox
4. assign somebody to be a sandbox admin to keep everything correct and clean
5. create a committee to qualify plugins to the closed repo

So the first question is where we can open them. Can we ask Spatialserver for 
two more repositories? :) We have all the repo stuff already done there. 
Unfortunatelly I notice a lack of Spatialserver connection about every week. 
The problems aren't ever prolonged so it's usable, just may be annoying for 
some users... So should we move to another location? Only if anybody any 
better idea now. Time is short :)

Regards,
B.

Yes, I meant upgrading the plugin in the repo to the new APIs (I'm the
maintainer of the repo).

Ok, so will it be possible to have a list of calls to be changed when
APIs will be freezed again?
Thanks.

Thanks Borys.
Wouldn't it be possible to use some space @OSGeo for this?

Hi Borys

just one note: although we are in feature and gui freeze, the api is
not yet frozen since we are still making some final cleanups to make
it more consistent and natural to use. As such we should wait until we
have it frozen before setting up any official 1.0 repo and calling for
plugin writers to port to the updated api.

best regards

Tim

I could volunteer ftools.ca (where I currently have my own repository), 
but I don't have a huge amount of server space for it. Eventually I will 
move it to my own server, but in the mean time it may not be as reliable 
as we would want...

I agree calling for porting makes no sense now, but why not to set up the 
repositories beforehand? And clean the 0.x repo at once.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMultipolyline
Message-ID: <48ECD148.3010703@gmail.com>

Hello list,

I have looked at the bugs list, and have not been able to find anyone 
else experiencing this problem, so perhaps I'm doing something wrong?

When creating a MultiPolyline geometry, I am able to combine several 
Polylines to form a single Multipolyline. However, when attempting to 
write this out to a shapefile using QgsVectorFileWriter, the resulting 
file contains no entries. I have inspected the Multipolylines, and they 
appear to be valid, and the QgsGeometry is created without a problem.

Somewhere between feature.setGeometry(multi_geom) and 
writer.addFeature(), the geometry information appears to be rendered 
invalid?

Any suggestions?

Better to set up the repos earlier than later - there's no reason to
wait with that...

Sounds like we need something like tile indexes as in GDAL/mapserver.
Did anyone already look into supporting these?

If you already have the world files built, then it is just automating 
the load process. The best approach for this would be a simple python 
script. It would only be a couple of lines long ( 
loadDirectoryOfGeoTiffs( aDirectory ) ). Pass in a directory containing 
your geotiffs, load each one. If each image has a "border" you could 
also set the transparency values at the same time.

I can offer to provide an example, but I am quite the python idiot and 
someone who knows python could throw this together in just a  couple of 
minutes.

Yes, your code works from QGIS Python console in both versions (1.0.0 preview 1 and 0.11.0), but when this code with some changes (geometry builds from list of coordinates) runs from Python plugin feature count don't changes and zoom to full extent don't work correctly (only old features zooming).
I run next test from console (with new empty layer, on Windows XP SP2, Python 2.5.2, Qgis 1.0.0 and 0.11.0):
>>> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
>>> vLayer = mc.getZpos(0)
>>> vLayer.featureCount()
0
>>> provider = vLayer.dataProvider()
>>> provider.name()
ogr
>>> lstCoord = []
>>> lstCoord.append(QgsPoint(5295480.10,5291778.46))
>>> lstCoord.append(QgsPoint(5295506.65,5291781.13))
>>> lstCoord.append(QgsPoint(5295512.19,5291821.17))
>>> lstCoord.append(QgsPoint(5295475.22,5291820.33))
>>> geom = QgsGeometry.fromPolygon([lstCoord])
>>> fet = QgsFeature()
>>> fet.setGeometry(geom)
>>> provider.addFeatures([fet])
(True, [<qgis.core.QgsFeature object at 0x03727660>])
>>> vLayer.featureCount()
0
>>> vLayer.updateFeatureCount()
-1
>>> vLayer.featureCount()
0
>>> vLayer.updateExtents()
>>> vLayer.featureCount()
0

I have no ideas for this. Maybe, it's necessary manually flush(save) changes to disk/database and then re-read layer?

Best regards,
  Alexander

yes I fully support setting up the repositories now I just didnt want
to create the impression for plugin devs that the api is finalised
now.

Hi Tim + others.
Any news about the integration of PAL? Does it look feasible within a
reasonable time frame?
Looking forward to it.
All the best, and thanks.

fixed in r9469 :-)
When you do f.setGeometry() the geometry gets copied to the feature.
Copying multi-part geometries in GEOS < 3.0 is slightly incorrect
because the geometries degenerate to more general geometry collection
class, which is not supported by QGIS... The fix forces GEOS not to
degenerate the clone.

It's possible to work around this problem also with earlier QGIS
versions. Geometry can be in QGIS represented in WKB or GEOS or both
formats. If you call e.g. wkbBuffer() / wkbSize() / wkbType() it will
create also WKB representation (if doesn't exist already) so when
geometry gets cloned later in setGeometry(), it will have already
correct WKB for QgsVectorFileWriter.

Others can chime in on this, but I "overheard" on irc that PAL does  
not have a mature enough API to include in 1.0, so the plan is to  
hopefully have it in 1.1. So it will not be in 1.0 from my  
understanding.

John

It seems to be working fine for me with points too - can you paste me a
simple example when it doesn't work? You can also take a look at the
debugging output from QGIS - if writer's addAttribute() function fails, it
should give some debugging message.

Yes, that's what I meant. With limited access to the first repo, of course. 

One improvement suggested by Barry for the second repo is to allow multiuser 
collaboration. It would be nice feature, however multiuser accounts aren't 
prohibited as I see, so it's legal and feasible even with current interface.

Hi lists,
Recent API changes affect older versions of the plugin installer (< 0.06.4). 
So if after recompiling QGIS from trunk the installer doesn't start, remove 
the ~/.qgis/python/plugins/plugin_installer directory to unmask the built-in 
instance, which of course works (thanks Jef!). Then you can safely upgrade it 
to a recent version.

Hi All

My apologies for the delay in providing feedback on this topic - I was
away for a week post conference trip with Marco Hugentobler, Horst
Deuster and Till Adams. On the code sprint day we had a long detailed
discussion with the PAL folks so let me bullet out the synopsis:

- Max, one of the PAL developers is finalising some API cleanups and
generally getting it ready for us / folks like us to use. Because of
this, introducing PAL into QGIS now is probably not a good idea and we
are proposing to do it in QGIS 1.1 rather.
- PAL does not do curve fitting of labels, it is a label placement
library only and does no rendering.
- PAL is currently using GEOS C++ api, since they had issues with some
equavalet parts of the C api in GEOS not being implemented yet. On IRC
Jeurgen Fischer suggested this could be addressed with patches to
GEOS.
- There is probably scope for Martin to do a Masters project on
labelling still because although PAL will offer  a huge leap forward
to QGIS labelling, there are still a number of things it doesnt do:

  * intelligent dropping of 'unimportant' labels when conflicts occur
  * incremental drawing of labels (it needs to search for the entire
solution first)
  * curve fitting etc of labels
  * prevention of labelling when adjacent features (e.g. road
segments) have the same attributes
  * we would probably want a way to force some labels to specific
locations (e.g. grass label points) and then make others flow around
those.

In short we came away feeling that we should wait for QGIS 1.1.0 for
labelling. On an aside, the PAL guys are really great - very helpful
and friendly so they should be receptive to the enevitable queries etc
the will come up along the way....

Best regards

Tim

Yes there are (probably quite a lot) more API cleanups planned as the
more I go through the API, (qgis core and qgis gui only being
considered here) the more inconsistencies I find. I would like to have
the API really clean, neat & tidy, logical and predictable for 1.0
since we will be stuck with it for a long time.

> Ok, so will it be possible to have a list of calls to be changed when

Yes all changes are listed here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/VisualChangeLog1.0.0

In theory you can apt-get install rpl and then run all the rpl
commands listed on your plugin and it will just work. However I
recommend manually updating it rather since in practice running the
rpl list may also cause hidden side effects. At the very least, make
good backups before attempting automated API updates with rpl.

> APIs will be freezed again?

They never were frozen yet, only the GUI and feature set are frozen.
I'm hoping to finalise API refactoring within the next month - I'll
announce when I'm done and if folks are happy with the final product,
we will freeze it and folks can start readying their plugins for 1.0
release. I'll send out a follow up email with release plans in the
next day or two.

Tim

In chatting to Marco this week, he mentioned this icon was renamed
instead of moved by mistake, causing the incorrect icon to be shown in
the user interface. We need to try to reinstate the original pan in
the main gui if it doesnt irritate the documentation folks too much.

We would like to bring the upcoming 16th ACM SIGSPATIAL
International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information
Systems (ACM GIS 2008). It will be held in Irvine, CA, in
November 5-7, 2008.  This year's Conference builds on the great
success of last year's Symposium where more than 180 people
attended, and on being the premier annual conference of the newly
established ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information
(ACM SIGSPATIAL http://www.sigspatial.org/).  The invited
speakers include Jack Dangermond, Founder and President of ESRI,
and Vinton Cerf, VP of Google and 2004 ACM Turing Award Winner.
This year we will also have for the first time a Ph.D. showcase track
and a demo track. The information can be found at
http://acmgis08.cs.umn.edu/ and the program is there as well. The
program is also repeated below. There is also a pre conference
workshop on November 4, 2008 called SPRINGL2008 on Security
and Privacy in GIS and LBS. We hope that you are able to come
and look forward to seeing you there.

The ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic

Information Systems 2008 (ACM GIS 2008) is the sixteenth event of a

series of symposia and workshops that began in 1993 with the aim of

bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners

carrying out research and development in novel systems based on

geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary

discussions and research in all aspects of geographicinformation

systems. The conference provides a forum for original research

contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation

aspects of GIS ranging from applications, user interface considerations,

and visualization down to storage management and indexing issues.

This year's conference builds on last year's conference great success

and on being the premier annual conference of the newly formed ACM

Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL). ACM

GIS will have two invited speakers, 38 full papers, 37 poster papers,

8 Ph.D. showcases, and 12 demos. (see below)

      Understanding the Privacy- Efficiency Trade-off in Location-Based

            Queries

                Gabriel Ghinita (Purdue University, USA)

                Abstract: Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities

                        (e.g., GPS) allow users to ask queries relative to their

                        present location. Since certain queries may be

                        privacy-sensitive, it is important to protect
the identity

                        of the users who send requests for
Location-based Services

                        (LBS). Instead of reporting the exact user
location to the

                        LBS provider, existing privacy-preserving
techniques either

                        perturb or encrypt the location data.

                        Current LBS privacy solutions fall into
several categories,

                        based on the type of location transformation
they employ,

                        and the system architecture they rely on. In
this position

                        paper, we introduce a taxonomy of LBS privacy
solutions, and

                        discuss the privacy-efficiency trade-offs achieved by

                        various techniques. We also identify several
open problems,

                        and propose some interesting directions for
future research.

      Key note presentation
      Understanding the Privacy- Efficiency Trade-off in Location-Based Queries
		  Gabriel Ghinita (Purdue University, USA)
      		  Abstract: Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities (e.g., GPS)
		  allow users to ask queries relative to their present location. Since certain
		  queries may be privacy-sensitive, it is important to protect the identity of 
		  the users who send requests for Location-based Services (LBS). Instead of 
		  reporting the exact user location to the LBS provider, existing privacy-preserving
		  techniques either perturb or encrypt the location data.
      		  Current LBS privacy solutions fall into several categories, based on the type 
		  of location transformation they employ, and the system architecture they rely 
		  on. In this position paper, we introduce a taxonomy of LBS privacy solutions, 
		  and discuss the privacy-efficiency trade-offs achieved by various techniques. 
		  We also identify several open problems, and propose some interesting directions
	          for future research.

Hi Hosein,
I think it's better to address this kind of questions in the qgis-USER 
list: qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org

Besides this I think we will need some more information: what kind of 
vector layer are you trying to edit (shape, postgis other)? Is there 
something special with it?
What version /OS are you using etc.

Normally (IF your dataset isn't read-only), in the right-corner of the 
attribute-table there is a button 'start editing'. After pushing that 
one you can edit fields. If your dataset is readonly (eg if you do not 
have write-permissions on the dbf/shp files, or your postgis user does 
not have write permissions on the table), the buttons cannot be 
activated (greyed-out).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, Marco. Is there a more recent Windows build available? I don't know 
if the release has changed significantly since you made this build for

Honestly, I don't know about changes. I quickly followed the ML, but I 
didn't have time to focus on it.
Unfortunately I'm extremely busy now, I've got the thesis dead-line on 
November 4th, and I'm under a big pressure.
I'm afraid, but any QGIS work (and GRASS, too, actually) is delayed after 
November 18th.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python plugins bugs
Message-ID: <48F62B6C.8040705@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I am running a course on QGIS, and we stumbled across a few problems 
with python plugins.
64bit machines running Fedora Core crash regularly while running fTools, 
specifically when selecting the file name to save to. This might be 
related to path lenght, but not in an obvious way. 32bit are ok.
Message is:
===
Warning: QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::findMatchingProj will only work 
if prj acr ellipsoid acr and proj4string are set!...
Segmentation fault
===
Additionally, the regular points utility (under fTools) has apparently 
an encoding problem:
===
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

===
Covex hull plugin puts the same ID (the last one) to all polygons, 
instead of the correct ID from the points file.

Split plugin generates incorrect file names (not  the value from the 
variable field, but filename_VARIABLE_<PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 
0x92c3bec>.shp

List unique values seems to add a blank line, thus giving incorrect 
results (N+1).

Mapserver export plugin does not append automatically the extension 
".map" to the file name.

Check geometry validity: the status bar does not work.

Multipart to singlepart and vice versa seem to have inverted names.

ManageR freezes after loading a layer if the projection of a layer is 
not set.

Ready for testing if necessary. Please let me know whether I should open 
tickets for this.
All the best.

Message-ID: <07B7870CE4945841951B429C10A4C9296DEFE9@email1.mitretek.org>

Hi,

 

I recently started looking into building a QGIS plugin in that would
connect to PostGIS and be able to edit database entries.

 

How do I go about starting this? I want to make an external plug-in. I
started creating the development environment following
http://www.webalice.it/marco.pasetti/qgis+grass/BuildFromSource.html and
ran into problems. I'll have to try it again and get the exact error
message but in short, when I got to installing GRASS, it said that it
couldn't find Lex. I had installed Flex by downloading the prebuilt
binary package and somehow GRASS installation couldn't find it. When I
went to reinstall Flex by building it myself, I think it said that it
couldn't find Bison which I had also installed using prebuilt binaries.
How do I get it to find Flex and Bison? BTW, I'm building this on
Windows using msys.

 

In the meantime, I ran into
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopingPlugins?highlight=%28plug%29
which is outdated but seems to say that I don't need the entire
development environment.

 

Could someone give me any pointers on this endeavor? I'm a newbie. I
know some programming in Java but not on C++ or Python and planning to
learn what I have to learn to do this.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

Hi Elisabeth.
Some of the functionality you are looking for are already present in a
couple of python plugins: have you checked those? Anyway, if you want to
develop a python plugin, you do not need to recompile qgis.
All the best.

Hi Elizabeth,

as Paolo mentioned, the standard Postgis layer (Layer / Add a Postgis 
layer) makes it possible to connect to postgis, view the geometries AND 
view/edit/save the attribute data.
If that's what you want, you're done :-)

But if you just want to write some code /plugin for qgis, go ahead.

You can either write your plugin in cpp (which is/was the normal way 
pre-0.8 or so). The Copyrightlabel, GPS Tools etc are written in cpp. 
But you will need a full cpp build environment (which I think is a 
little easier to make in ubuntu (???)).

In my opinion, the easiest way to write a plugin is in python. Search 
the wiki for python plugin:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PluginRepositories?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=python+plugin&fullsearch=Text
I think http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopingPluginsWithPython is a 
good page to start :-)

In this way you do NOT need to rebuild qgis at all. You can just start 
hacking into one of the existing easier plugins (sources) into (on 
windows where you apparently are developing in)
"C:\Documents and Settings\[YOURNAME]\.qgis\python\plugins"

So install qgis and python, and install for example the "Raster File 
Info" plugin via the plugin-installer OR by just extracting the zip from 
: http://spatialserver.net:3001/python_plugins/list?page=2
into your C:\Documents and Settings\[YOURNAME]\.qgis\python\plugins 
directory.
As you can see, you can use existing plugins to peep into the source for 
ideas etc. There are already some postgis-related plugins available 
(from: http://spatialserver.net:3001/python_plugins/list):
- PostGPS: A set of dialogs for converting a point layer into a .gpx 
file and to take a any point layer and insert it into a PostGIS table
- NewLayer  	Example of how to create a new minimal PostgreSQL layer 
with predefined field types (not very useful but demonstrates the concept).
- pypostgis  	Plugin to run queries from inside qgis and load them into 
the canvas. Uses OGR as connection library.

One remark: in this time (just before the 1.0 release of qgis) there are 
some api-changes, so beware of that).

Another remark: there is also a difference in making a plugin with nice 
dialogs, of plugins with only  msg-box-like alerts.

Developing plugins with dialogs you will need to set up qt and pyqt to 
build those dialogs. But I would say: start with alerts first ...
(see my first steps in plugins: http://www.duif.net/qgis/ with some 
links in it)

Regards and have fun,

Tara, Marco, I'll tag another preview  (preview 2) towards the end of
this month once I have finished API revisions for the release. Tara
there shouldnt be any visual changes since we are in gui freeze since
preview 1. Marco H inadvertantly changed the pan icon, but I will
restore it to the original before doing the preview 2.

Please don't open tickets for the fTools stuff. You have given me a nice 
list to work through, so I'll try to tackle these as soon as I can. I 
think the 64bit crash is related to Qt, but I could be mistaken.

What version of QGIS and fTools are you using?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] White space bug?
Message-ID: <48F831CB.4040706@zamg.ac.at>

hello,

I use Qgis 0.11.0 under Windows 2000. The grass environment is installed 
by osgeo2w[1]. Grass version is 6.3.0 (2008).

When I import shapefiles with whitespace in the pathname, I get an error 
message.

for example:

$ v.in.ogr 'C:/Dokumente und
Einstellungen/user/Desktop/Daten/Bsp/Example.shp' output=line

$ v.db.addcol map=line columns='test double'

ERROR: value <und> out of range for parameter <driver>
         Legal range: dbf,ogr,pg,sqlite

Description:
   Executes any SQL statement.

...

Is this a bug? Maybe similar to Ticket #1005 [2].

regards
   stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapLayerRegistry (and QgsMapCanvas) problem
Message-ID: <48F8A393.9080102@gmail.com>

Hello gang,

According to the API, QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers() should 
return (in the case of python) a dict with the following format:
{ layer0 : QgsMapLayer, layer1: QgsMapLayer }
However, what I appear to be getting is slightly different. Instead of 
QgsMapLayers, I get QgsVectorLayers and QgsRasterLayers. This also 
occurs when trying to get a QgsMapLayer from the map canvas. Is this 
intended, and if so then this creates a problem:

QgsMapLayer.type() returns (as of 9490-ish) either VectorLayer (0) or 
RasterLayer (1) [ QgsMapLayer.LayerType ]
QgsVectorLayer,type() returns either Point (0), Line (1), Polygon (2), 
or UnknownGeometry (3) [ QGis.geometryType ]
QgsRasterLayer.type() returns (as far as I can tell) the same as 
QgsMapLayer.type(), so: RasterLayer (1)

So the problem is this:
If we are trying to check what type of layers we have in our 
QgsMapLayerRegistry, if it's a raster, we will be told that it's a 
raster by returning QgsMapLayer.RasterLayer (or 1), however, if it's a 
vector, then we will get QgsVectorLayer.type() instead of 
QgsMapLayer.type().

I see three solutions to this problem:
a) I'm doing this all wrong, and hopefully someone will tell me this,
b) My favoured solution: Since QgsVectorLayer inherits QgsMapLayer, 
QgsVectorLayer.type() should be changed to QgsVectorLayer.vectorType()
c) All of these enumerators should return something other than numbers?

Clear as mud?

Thanks,

Carson

Regarding b) yeah type() is probably being overloaded by
QgsVectorLayer causing confusion. I removed the vector from vectorType
because I thought it was redundant. If we need to change it back I'd
probably prefer to call it geometryType().

Regarding c) they should all be returning enumerated types but I guess
the side effect is that the QgsMapLayer::type() enumerators and those
of teh first two entries in QgsVectorLayer::type() return  matchin
numbers. I could force them to be higher no's to remove such
inadvertant collisions. I'll take a look at this later tomorrow -
thanks for the feedback on this.

Any other comments on API changes as I do them are welcome...

Regards

Tim

Fair point. I possibly misunderstood and read Tom to say that he was  
willing to let it resolve itself once Qt4.5 becomes stable.

If it is an easy thing to do, I would also favor the proof-of-concept  
being committed to svn so the problem can be resolved now.

Hi Folks

Note that we are currently in GUI freeze. While I support the fix we
should liase with the community / documentation team to see if these
changes will be ok for them. Tara / Otto can you please give the go
ahead if possible?

As a general rule we need to consult the  community / documentation
team before doing any GUI changes prior to 1.0 release with some
comment on impact levels they may expect.

+1 for the change from my point of view pending their ok.

Regards

Tim

Agreed but I don't see a GUI change here. The bug is that the volume 
list in a QFileDialog (a Qt not QGIS widget) contains only the boot 
volume rather then all volumes. The fix is to add code to append items 
items to a pre-existing list. The list content becomes longer but the 
GUI doesn't change.

+1 for the change. And as Tim said, it would be nice, if someone can give us a
list, what changes we may expect and need to update in the manual.

Hi all,

I'm also in favour of adding more python plugins to the repository (e.g. fTools and geoprocessing). Requirement is that a plugin is of general interest and that the author agrees to maintain the plugin.

In the few seminars I've done, my lesson #1 is "Adding Basic Plugins". 
With the new plugin installer, beginners have to scroll thru the long - 
and ever growing- list of plugins (which, of course is a good thing!) to 
find and add one or two additional basic tools. I'd just as soon have 
fTools available by default, like Delimited Text, SPIT, etc.

And of course we should wait with this until the API cleanups in trunk are finished. Plugins will need some changes to work with QGIS 1.0 API.

this is correct behaviour. Python doesn't support casting in a way
that c++ does. I.e. one you have a QgsMapLayer reference, you can't
cast it to QgsVectorLayer (although it would be a correct cast). So
SIP has a mechanism (which PyQGIS uses) that returns a subclass
instead of parent class. You can take a look at qgsmaplayer.sip in
python/core dir to get an idea.

b) is correct! type() should be really renamed back to vectorType()
because current behaviour is not acceptable.

AFAIK python doesn't support enumerations, you get an integer instead.
SIP generates objects for enumerations, so you can use e.g.
QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer instead of numbers.

Tim, please rename vector layer's type() either back to vectorType()
or some other name to avoid override.


> Any other comments on API changes as I do them are welcome...

I was not happy with all the renaming taking place, but generally
they're fine. One thing I don't really like is that
QgsVectorDataProvider::reset() was renamed to begin(). The real
purpose of this function is to restart reading of the data, one
doesn't have to call it when starting retrieval of features - but
that's what the current name suggest. I would suggest using e.g.
resetReading() as it better corresponds with the action it takes (and
stays consistent with OGR).

I'm glad to hear that people are finding fTools useful. I would be happy 
to have it included in the SVN, however, I think it would need a lot 
more work to get it up to standard.

I am slowly reworking many of the functions, tightening up the code, and 
generally making a more integrated tool. (Future installs should also be 
smaller). However, I would appreciate it if people could send me their 
thoughts, comments, suggestions, and bugs, so that I can fix and find 
things that I may have thought of myself...

Message-ID: <34316.24.205.58.134.1224356207.squirrel@mail.acm.caltech.edu>

I have this problem on a new Ubuntu Hardy 8.041 system.  qgis from the
repository  works (it is 0.11.0-Mettis) but the checkout verision does
not.  I downloaded it, ran  cmake with no errors, it compiled,  linked
and installed with no errors.  But when I tried to run it, I got

/woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis: error while loading shared
libraries: libgeos-3.0.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

I have 2.2.3 on my system, so I put in a  symbolic link to that (ln -s
libgeos.so.2.2.3 libgeos-3.0.0.so), and got

% /woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis

another symbolic link (ln -s libgdal1.4.0.so.1.11.4 libgdal1.5.0.so.1)
gave me

which shows linking to different versions of the library than what you
actually  compiled against is a bad idea.  Now, a previous post in the
installation forum claimed:

  Postby ludodo on Wed Feb 13, 2008 10:46 am
  Hi,

  Maybe you've got a problem with the configure parameter GEOS_LIBRARY
  It sounds like i had the same compilation error when i putted this as the
  parameter :
  GEOS_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/
  Then, it worked well when I precised more than the path with the name of the
  lib :
  GEOS_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libgeos.so.2.2.3

but I  tried this and  it didn't get through the compilation.  What my
ccmake screen gives is the following:

GEOS_LIBRARY /usr/lib/libgeos_c.so

(this is generated  automatically  when  I configure), and  that  this
library does exist.

I  should  note that  I have a 32-bit Ubuntu Hardy machine at home and
have had no problem installing and compiling from scratch.  On this 32
bit Ubuntu Hardy system, I have the following:

GEOS_LIBRARY /usr/lib/libgeos.so

rather  than  libgeos_c.so as  on the 64-bit system.  When I  put this
library location that works on the 32 bit system on the 64 bit system,
I get the following errors.

CMake Error: Error in cmake code at

Message-ID: <d8ad40b50810181509i1b6155c3i16da40e30fef0bb6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

 I've been editing some of my plugins to work with the API changes in
the 1.0 preview release. Which just seems to involve changing
'getMapCanvas' for 'mapCanvas' here and there, and a few other things.
I should really read the changelog and fix everything in one go
instead of loading, reading error message, reloading... Anyway...

 I think they are all compatible for 1.0 now, and I've stuck them on
google code in the 'bsrplugins' section:

http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/

 feel free to check them out from SVN and play. They're not in my repo yet...

 I'm still not sure how to mesh SVN with the Qgis plugin folder and a
repository. I want my SVN working copy to be 'live' in the qgis
plugins folder so edits are instantly there. But I also want to make
sure the zip in the repository is valid, and an install from that
would stomp on my working copy... I'm all a bit confused... Any tips
for best practices for integrating SVN with plugin development and a
repository?

Sorry to insist, but all this will be a lot easier if fTools stay within
main QGIS code.
Any objections incorporating it in svn, and granting access to Carson?
All the best.

Hi Barry

Please note that API changes for 1.0 are not finalised (we are gui and
feature frozen but not API frozen yet), so it may be better to hold
off publishing your plugins until they are. I hope to have the API
cleanup done by the end of the month but it may take a little longer
than that.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] R plugins crash
Message-ID: <48FB41ED.7020009@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I get frequent qgis crashes when enabling various R plugins:

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x8, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace
Selection:

Anyone has an explanation (or, better, a solution)?
All the best.

The override has been resolved as of yesterday (sat 18 oct).

Bear in mind whatever we dont clean up now, we will be stuck with for
a long time (3 years+?). The API is full of inconsistancies and
english wobblies that make using it harder than it needs to be. For
example we have enumerators in various forms:

enum FOO
{
  BAR_VAL,
  ZED_VAL
}

enum foo
{
  barval,
  zedval
}

etc etc. There are many other places where it needs cleanup beyond
this simple type of example, so better we spend the time now and get
them sorted out...

1) The change to reset was done in consultation with Marco H. Calling
reset sounds like its doing something damaging rather than moving to
the start of the selection. Another option would be something like
toSelectionStart() if you feel it would make its purpose clearer.

2) Providers are an abstraction and the Provider interface should not
emulate the OGR api per se.

Hi Doug.
Tested rather intensively last week, and the packages worked very well.
Lots of thanks! Just a few notes:
- qgis should depend on (or at least strongly suggest) gpsbabel
- apparently, html grass help is missing from the package
Additionally, ogrinfo package seems to have trouble reading GRASS
layers, eg:
ogrinfo -so -al  /grass/location/PERMANENT/vector/riserve/head
does not work.
All the best, and many thanks!

In fact I hope we won't get stuck with this API for next 3 years :-)
(but that's for discussion in another thread)

and what about seekToBegin() or resetReading() ?
begin() itself really doesn't make things clear.

I was giving OGR just as an example of API that many people know and
are familiar with...

Message-ID: <939ef32f0810200446i56b5b006p6d3037dc9de15d41@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!! I've tried to compile qgis in windows, I'm trying to get msys with
dependencies (like it's explained in install text file ) but the link
doesn't work.

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.zip

So I'm looking for msys on web and I've found a msys but it doesn't work me
neither. it gives me  an error message in make process with the include of
geos's library:

" You're using deprecated header io.h. Please update your sources according
to new layout of GEOS headers and namespace "

but i don't find a geos header compatible with the sources.

how could I download a correct msys or geos library compatible??

should be fixed now. Seems GEOSGeomFromWKT got changed to 
`GEOSGeomFromWkt during api clean up.

I'm getting a new problem:

Does GEOSWKTReader need to be changed to GEOSWktReader?

Hi Alberto:

If you already did an svn checkout, you should read the INSTALL file in the
part 6. Creation of MSYS environment for compilation of Quantum GIS. That
part details the creation of msys and compilation of dependencies step by step.

I have tried to download the msys file several times but it seems like the file
have been unavailable for some time.

Hope this helps.
Regards
Godofredo Contreras

Hi Alberto & Godofredo

My apologies the msys environment lives here now since our server
crashed some months ago:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/win32/

Please advise of any places where the old links exist and I will
endeavour to update them.

Hello,

Has anyone built or is anyone planning to build QGIS for 64bit CentOS  
systems? I am trying to get my university facility to adopt QGIS but  
this is a barrier to getting the software installed here.

Thank you,

All,
The Wiki, download, and main QGIS website, as well as the Python plugin 
repository will be unavailable at some point between 12:30am and 4:30am 
Central time on October 21, 2008. Testing is being done to diagnose a 
potential hardware problem. The length of the downtime is unknown but 
should occur within this window.

Thanks tim, but it's the file which I had found because there is a problem
with the geos library...

" You're using deprecated header io.h. Please update your sources according
to new layout of GEOS headers and namespace "

The  file install talk about some directories that is not present then I
think it's not the file correct.

I'm going to read the section which godofedro talk about

Seems like it shouldn't be too hard. Have you talked with the people who
have made the i386 packages
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/linux/CentOS_5x/qgis-0.11.0/
Their direct contacts are on that page too.

When the qgis site comes back up (down for some hardware
troubleshooting) check the build instructions, any instructions for Red
Hat or Fedora should get you most of the way.

I assure you it works on 64bit, I'm running Ubuntu though so I can't
make you a package.

I have this problem on a new Ubuntu Hardy 8.041 system.  qgis from the
repository  works (it is 0.11.0-Mettis) but the checkout verision does not.  I
downloaded it, ran  cmake with no errors, it compiled,  linked and installed
with no errors.  But when I tried to run it, I got

% /woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis
/woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis: error while loading shared
libraries: libgeos-3.0.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

I have 2.2.3 on my system, so I put in a  symbolic link to that (ln -s
libgeos.so.2.2.3 libgeos-3.0.0.so), and got

% /woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis
/woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis: error while loading shared
libraries: libgdal1.5.0.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

another symbolic link (ln -s libgdal1.4.0.so.1.11.4 libgdal1.5.0.so.1) gave me

% /woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis
/woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/bin/qgis: symbol lookup error:
/woldlab/shrew/data1/mccue/apps/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.0: undefined symbol:
_ZN14QGraphicsScene11eventFilterEP7QObjectP6QEvent

which shows linking to different versions of the library than what you
actually  compiled against is a bad idea.  Now, a previous post in the
installation forum claimed:

  Re: building unstable branch fails - Ubuntu/Mandriva x86_64
  Postby ludodo on Wed Feb 13, 2008 10:46 am
  Hi,

  Maybe you've got a problem with the configure parameter GEOS_LIBRARY It
sounds like i had the same compilation error when i putted this as the
parameter :
  GEOS_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/
  Then, it worked well when I precised more than the path with the name of the
lib :
  GEOS_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libgeos.so.2.2.3

but I  tried this and  it didn't get through the compilation.  What my ccmake
screen gives is the following:

GEOS_LIBRARY /usr/lib/libgeos_c.so

(this is generated  automatically  when  I configure), and  that  this library
does exist.

I  should  note that  I have a 32-bit Ubuntu Hardy machine at home and have
had no problem installing and compiling from scratch.  On this 32 bit Ubuntu
Hardy system, I have the following:

GEOS_LIBRARY /usr/lib/libgeos.so

rather  than  libgeos_c.so as  on the 64-bit system.  When I  put this library
location that works on the 32 bit system on the 64 bit system, I get the
following errors.

Am I correct in understanding that this only affects the Mac GUI? If 
that is the case, then there is no problem. We have not generated any 
screenshots using that platform. However, if this change would affect 
the Linux GUI, we would need Otto and Stephan Holl to comment on that 
because they have already generated a lot of screenshots.
If it affects the Windows GUI, I would need to know how it would affect 
the screen shots I have already created using that platform, and I would 
need to have someone create an up-to-date build for me.

Borys-
The only files in

C:/Documents and Settings/Tara/.qgis/

are
qgis.db
qgis.qmldb

I am updating parts of the manual for QGIS 1.0, so I am necessarily 
working with this version.
I have a windows build that was generated for me by Marco Pasetti 
against code revision 9303.
I will not have access to any other version until after Nov. 18 because 
Marco has to finish his thesis at the
moment (unless someone else knows how to provide a Windows build).

At present I am updating the Forward, which describes the overall 
capabilities of QGIS. Currently there are statement such as:
"You can perform spatial data analysis on PostgreSQL/PostGIS and other OGR
supported formats using the geoprocessing plugin."
Will the geoprocessing plugin be modified to work with QGIS 1.0.0 in 
time for the release, or can we expect that capability to not be 
available for a while?
Our timeline is to finish the first draft of the user guide update 
within 2 weeks (Nov. 4) so I need to know whether I should be
taking these statements out, or leave them in in anticipation of the 
plugins being updated.

Thanks, Tara

Hi,

During drag-and-drop operation within leged cursor's icon is confusing.
It suggests, that change of layers order is not allowed.

QGIS 1.0 Kore Preview 1, Windows XP.

I have more such observations. Should I put this sort of observations on

So the installer doesn't create the missing directories. I'll fix it tomorrow 
and now you can easily fix it by manually creating the directory "python" and 
the "plugins" inside:

C:/Documents and Settings/Tara/.qgis/python/plugins

Then the plugins should install.

The API is changed nearly every day, so plugin updating is suspended until the 
API freeze. Surely all valuable plugins will be updated before the day of 
1.0.0 release, but probably not before November 4th...

I think you can use this plugin under QGIS 0.11 and assume that its gui won't 
be changed... But I don't know Author's plans.

Btw. should I write a section about the Plugin Installer? Or is it done 
already? Furthermore, there is lack of guidelines describing preparation of 
the plugin packages and the authors sometimes do it wrongly. Could we include 
it to the user guide?

I would definitely recommend you add them to trac. Any bugs filed  
there will be posted to the dev list, so you get both for the price of  
one. Also, that will get them in the queue for a dev to squash at some  
point.

Why pyramid for raster maps is used in plural?
Isn't it just one piramid per file?

  I should note that this was solved.  I had switched this system from Debian
to Ubuntu and apparently their are libraries in the output directory which are
not removed by make clean (or replaced by make install).  Removal of the
output
location directory solved the problem.  THanks to Magnus Homann.

Do you have multiple installation of ligqgis_core and libqgis_gui?

Do a 'ldd qgis' and see if there are any strange links

Subject: [Qgis-developer] scaling bug?
Message-ID: <48FED65F.2040504@gmail.com>

Hi developers and users!
Maybe I'm just to dumb to understand but probably its also a bug.

There is a small section called "Scale" in the lower right corner of the 
QGis Main-Window.
Even when nothing is loaded and I move the map scale is changing. To be 
honest, when I just move a map scaled to a decent scaling I don't expect 
the scaling to change when I just move around.
Also when I work in the QGIS in windowes mode and i maximize the window 
to "full screen" I personally would expect the scaling to stay at eg 
1:50000 and not to change.

The second is just a suggestion but is the first thing a bug or is it 
just me not understanding something?
Can someone clearify this?

Thx in advance
regards
Werner

Hi Carson

Right, I didn't test with a clean build yesterday.
I now reverted some of my sip changes to allow compilation. I wonder what the 
problem was. Maybe Python does not like virtual functions?

The problem was that readSymbology() and writeSymbology() functions
were already present in the sip file...

I think the skeleton file gives us more functionality with smaller gui change.
The only one gui change is additional File menu item "save as default project" 
or so. I think it's the essential improvement for QGIS 1.1 and maybe it's 
worth considering to include it to the 1.0?

Message-ID: <49004302.2040300@gmail.com>

I know this question has been asked a thousand times, but I still can't 
get things to work here a work...

Does anyone have experience using QGis behind a university proxy server? 
I have tried everything I can think of, but can't seem to access the 
python plugin repositories, or and WMS servers. I can however, launch 
Firefox from QGis, and since my proxy settings work in Firefox, I have 
no problem getting out.

Any ideas?

Apparently it's a bug in Qt (bug opened; I cannot check it now, but you'll
find it in the trac).
I agree in some situations is a very serious issue.
All the best.

 I've just written a workaround. It's a python class called QPHttp
which is a drop-in replacement for QHttp but sets proxy settings from
those that urllib.getproxies() gets.

 I've tested it standalone, all I need to do now is s/QHttp/QPHttp/ in
the right places in the plugin installer..

 I'll attach it for anyone to play with - there may be some people
with proxy configs that break it...

Thanks a lot!
I'm applying it to the Installer for a broad testing.

It might also be good to allow other types of proxy settings in QGIS?
So the user could specify what type of proxy to use:

http, socks 4 or 5, etc...

Thoughts?

Yes! good idea. I stumbled over the broken QT-proxy-stuff and never got
the proxy-stuff working for my needs.

Did anybody file a bug against the QT-libs? I like to follow the
ongoing on that side.

I've just uploaded the new proxy-friendly version of the Plugin Installer with 
Barry's patch (0.06.5). Proxy users, Could you upgrade and test it please?

If you can't use the present installer, just unpack the file below to your 
~/.qgis/python/plugins directory:

http://spatialserver.net/pyqgis/plugins/plugin_installer.zip
(compatible with all QGIS versions with python support, so since 0.9 to trunk)

Dear Martin,

I can suggest python codes for this issue. if QtWidget is QLineEdit in
python console, you can use this code:

txtEnter = QLineEdit

  def keyPressEvent(self, event):
    if event.key() == QtCore.Qt.Key_Up:
      self.txtEnter.undo()
      self.txtEnter.deselect()
    elif event.key() == QtCore.Qt.Key_Down:
      self.txtEnter.redo()
      self.txtEnter.deselect()

I hope it works.

Hello, I do believe I signed on to the wrong list-serve. I had a question
earlier as a user and I certainly did get help but some of this stuff is

If there is a list serve that helps users deal with issues that would be
cool.

Hi all,

recently I've been working on a simple PostGIS database manager plugin for QGIS.

Features:
- list schemas, tables, views and their geometry types
- show table metadata (fields, constraints, indexes)
- show attribute table and map preview for layers loadable by QGIS
postgres provider
- create tables including geometry column and spatial index
- rename / delete tables and views
- create / rename / delete schemas
- load and dump data using pgsql2shp and shp2pgsql

You can try it out from my sandbox:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/plugins-sandbox.xml

You'll need QGIS from SVN trunk.

I'd like to hear some feedback whether you like / don't like it and
what features are missing.

Bye
Martin

Getting lots of these errors when viewing features or the table:

Feature:
I don't see on the list... import aspatial data(ie: csv or dbf files).
Not every table is going to come from a shapefile and I have yet to find
a GUI tool for import of non spatial data.

Weird, when exactly does it crash? Actually the plugin doesn't use
QgsProject in any way so I would be quite surprised if it's the plugin
what causes the crash.

Ah, this is similar to ticket #777. I've done a workaround for that
and uploaded as v0.1.1.

Btw. the table preview so far doesn't behave correctly. It expects
that feature ids are counted from 0 to feat.count-1 - and that's not
always true :)

the plugin:

Ah, I've forgot to add that you need psycopg2 python module installed
(for interfacing PostgreSQL database from python)

Ok, after that install, the plugin loads.

I get a nice list of all my tables and the meta data is listed, but  
nothing shows under the table or preview tabs. I am not running a  
debug build, but can make one and give error messages if you'd like.

This did pop up in the Console when I opened the plugin:
10/27/08 12:04:06 PM [0x0-0x24d24d].org.qgis.qgis[80700] Warning:

The plugin should be able to show table and map for tables that are
accessible within QGIS. If you can open them within QGIS and not in
plugin, something's wrong with plugin and debugging output might be
useful to track down the reason.

This shouldn't have any impact on the problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fonts in map composer
Message-ID: <4EFF03D4-0088-4BC6-ADE1-7071C0B847AF@me.com>

Marco,

First, thanks for all the wonderful improvements to the map composer.  
This is now quite stable and usable for production quality maps.

One of the last remaining issues is the quality of fonts in printed  
maps. Here ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/67875808@N00/2979503270/ )  
are sample outputs using qgis and mapserver. Note the fonts and buffer  
are antialiased in mapserver (right), but not in qgis (left). This  
makes labels for small font sizes quite unattractive. Also, note that  
the characters are not spaced evenly.

Is there a way to have antialiasing available for all font sizes? (Is  
there a cutoff size for antialiased fonts?) Both maps use Arial, a  
standard TrueType font on my system (Mac OS X). I had to select font  
size 8 in qgis (yet it is still too large); mapserver is using a  
larger size (font size 12). I tried with a larger canvas and larger  
fonts, but things did not improve a great deal and the file size and  
computation time grew considerably.

If you have any insights or ideas on this, I'd love to hear them.

Cheers,
John

The plugin loads when QGIS starts. When I click on the tool icon QGIS  
crashes. There is no project loaded. I'm using Qt 4.3.x---I wonder if  
your plugin relies on a more recent version since Jctull is able to  
run it.

I've observed the character spacing issue before.  My slightly-educated
guess is that it's a Qt font-rendering deficiency related to using really
small fonts (similar to the font-garbling issue) - as far as I know, the
drawing code is using all floating-point precision.

Hi John

I think Steven is right, it is a problem with the scaling of Qt fonts. There 
was a similar problem with composer labels (text boxes that can be placed in 
print composer). The solution there was to request fonts in larger size and 
scale the painter down before applying QPainter::drawText.

It should be possible to do the same for labels printed on the map. I created 
a ticket for this (#1379)

Regards,
Marco

I'm using Qt 4.3.4, however Qt version shouldn't affect this... any
chance that something's wrong with your QGIS installation?

I do recall the scaling problem with symbols and lines in the earlier  
composer. I assume that an option to scale fonts will have to be added  
to the gui, so something to look for in 1.1 or the advanced editing  
branch at some point? I'll be happy to provide some feedback on your  
solutions as they are developed. Feel free to email me if you have  
something to test.

That is plausible as I am running Qt 4.4.

Aside: I now have a debug build that I will test shortly to try and  
find out what was causing my table and preview to render blank.

Gary,

How are you linking your libraries in your qgis binary? I run these  
two commands to get things properly linked in my builds (assuming you  
did a 'make install' and not 'sudo make install'. This is a long  
running issue on OS X with python plugins/functionality:

install_name_tool -change /Users/jctull/sources/qgis/trunk/build/src/ 
gui/libqgis_gui.dylib @executable_path/lib/libqgis_gui.dylib -change /

Maybe I have an idea what's wrong, but not sure. Please try this:
- go to plugin's directory: ~/.qgis/python/plugins/postgis_manager
- edit ManagerWindow.py:
  - on lines 311 and 313 add "self" to empty parentheses, so that it looks like:
	self.table = QTableView(self)
			
	self.preview = qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas(self)

And let me know if that helped!

Question looks trivial, but ... how to change QGIS interface to english

There is no such file in i18n folder and no option "ignore locale".

And one more question. What is the function of qt_*.qm files in i18n folder?

Two options:
1) Set "LANG=C" in unix before you start QGIS
2) In Settings -> Options -> Locale you can override the system locale and use e.g. "en_US".
You have to restart QGIS for this to take effect.

This gets installed and are used during run-time for translations (I think).

Welcome to the translation effort! :-)

Message-ID: <FB4EB68C-B255-4A7F-A9FF-6D111D1635DE@me.com>

Marco,

First, thanks for all the wonderful improvements to the map composer.  
This is now quite stable and usable for production quality maps.

One of the last remaining issues is the quality of fonts in printed  
maps. Attached are sample outputs using qgis and mapserver. Note the  
fonts and buffer are antialiased in mapserver, but not in qgis. This  
makes labels for small font sizes quite unattractive.

Is there a way to have antialiasing available for all font sizes? (Is  
there a cutoff size for antialiased fonts?) Both maps use Arial, a  
standard TrueType font on my system (Mac OS X). I had to select font  
size 8 in qgis (yet it is still too large); mapserver is using a  
larger size (font size 12). Maybe I need to change my map canvas size  
and use larger fonts, but I'm guessing they will still not be  
antialiased.

If you have any insights or ideas on this, I'd love to hear them.

Cheers,
John

Apologies for not asking on irc, but I don't have access to that right 
now...

Is the current preview version of QGIS 1.0 based on the 
Release-1_0_0-preview1 tag? I am asking because I'm trying to put 
together a plugin for this release, but I have been working with trunk 
and so want to build the preview release as well for testing purposes.

Thanks in advance,

Carson

Message-ID: <200810292140.10890.borys@wolf.most.org.pl>

Hi,
I can't fix the last serious bug in Installer. In case of SOME connection 
problems, QHttp stays in memory endlesly and hangs QGIS when closing. 

The problem occurs only if the machine is online in local network, but 
external network is disabled. In this case QHttp seems to be indestructible 
and hangs QGIS when it attempts to exit. Neither calling the QHttp.abort() 
nor deleting it by del (or rather deleting the pointing variable - AFAIK I 
can't do more in Python) doesn't help.

Note that if machine is just offline, QHttp quickly returns a connection error 
and everything works ok. Also if a host is unreachable and QHttp waits for 
connection, it's no problem, because closing QGIS kills it properly and I 
don't even need to call the QHttp.abort().

Has anybody any suggesions? 

I set the 'looking for updates on startup' disabled by default. In most cases 
user can safely enable it, but we just can't provide such potentially 
unreliable feature enabled by default.

Are you sure it's QHttp, and not my QPHttp wrapper class? It may be
that the proxy object isn't getting destroyed properly when the
connection closes, and something weird might be happening...

 Of course if this happens with plain QHttp then it's not that...

Yes, the problem is older then your QPhttp class :(

On Windows XP "lang=c" is not working.
I made *.bat file containing:
set lang=en
"C:\Program Files\QGIS-Dev\qgis.exe"

And it works fine.

I want to do a preview 2 tag and call for packages this weekend so bug
reporters etc can be using something a little fresher. I still have
more api cleanups to do mainly in gui and chaning the
provider->begin() call as Martin requested. Those API changes will be
done by the end of November latest I hope and then we will freeze the
API and head towards a December 24 release...if we are ready....

So it might be worth waiting till I tag Release-1_0_0-preview2 this weekend....

Regards

Tim

Any chance someone could put up a build of 0.11 to the launchpad repo 
for the new version of Ubuntu? Since it is the stable release we 
probably should keep building it until 1 is done.

I'm happy help if I can, I just don't know how to build debs properly yet.


Thanks,
Alex

Word of caution, we've identified that somethings wrong with qt4 in 
intrepid. This appears to work on kde4 installs but not purely gnome.

I'll post again when we resolve the issue.

Message-ID: <1337323490.20081031222258@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

Does someone want to test our brand new QGIS plugin? It is C++ based,
so you need to copy it to plugins. This is part of the ongoing process
to develop a bigger one and our first try, so judge accordingly ;)

It adds two simple instruments, one tool is used to open the
coordinates of the click in Google Maps and other tool gets and open a
geometry from active layer in Google Earth. It is a handy tool for
quickly sending stuff from QGIS to GE, we're using ourselves quite a
bit.

If someone is interested, svn is here:
http://svn.gis-lab.info/qgis2google

Win version can be downloaded from here
http://gis-lab.info/programs/qgis/libqgis2googleplugin.zip

Still trying to figure out the best way to distribute stuff like this
for other OSes too, not much experience here.

Maxim
