Thanks for your report Akbar!

I'm sorry if you've not taken into account my repeated calls to keep
authentication and proxy support in the primary goals. As I explained you
this is very important for some companies and organizations that needs
authenticated endpoints in their networks.

If this plugin will not use this feature, the a.m. organization will not be
able to use it (and they will not invest any time or resources in its
maintainance or future development), they will just build their own sharing
solution.

For this reason I've been pushing since the very beginning to use
QgsNetworkAccessManager for all network calls, in order to be able to use
QGIS proxy settings and authentication plugins.

For the zip/tar file handler (or other yet to be developed handlers), I
believe that unless we end up with a centralized index (like plugin manager
does with XML file), we really need to separate the metadata protocol from
the payload protocol.

Of course, this should be an optional override: if there is no change of
protocol for a particular collection, the handler will just use the repo's
protocol, but for the ZIP file if we do not want to download the whole zip
just to be able to read the metadata, there is no other way than to provide
a distinct metadata URL.

Additionally, I believe that providing a ZIP handler is very important,
since it will likely become the most popular way to share resources,
everybody is able to build a zip file and put it online, without even
knowing what GIT is.


The algorithm could be:

# Browsing:
- for each the repo url:
   - if it does not point to a metadata.ini file
      - get the metadata address from the URL
   - if we have an handler to retrieve the metadata.ini
      - retrieve the metadata.ini
   - else
      - error

#Installing
- if the metadata does not contain a download URL for the collection
    - build the collection download URL from the repo URL and protocol and
collection name
- if we have an handler to retrieve the collection
    - download and install
- else
    - error


Cheers

Agreed. In the network class, I used QgsNetworkAccessManager. The tricky
part is the Dulwich's porcelain used to interact with git repositories. For
this, I think we need to do it manually through git configuration to use
proxy.

The algorithm could be:

I was thinking to separate between Metadata Handler and Repository Handler
as they don't have any correlation. For example, the metadata could be in
an ftp and the repository could be in git. Doing if else (treating the only
one git case: that the repository URL is a git repository and building a
metadata URL from that URL is not that worth it). So when users add a
repository, they add the metadata url. What do you think?

In this case we will loose authentication, but I guess it's not a great
issue: I don't think that git will be the preferred sharing protocol in
case of authenticated repos.

It looks good to me, browsing metadata and installing a collection are two
separate steps (in time and scope) and it's worth splitting the URLs into
different protocol, if needed.

Of course, for most repos, the handler and protocol will just be the same
for both operations.

In general, I feels that this is a better approach also in the sense that
"explicit is better than implicit", we provide explicit URIs instead of
delegate guessing them to the software layer.

Ok thanks Ale. I'll focus on separating metadata handler and repository
handler this week.

I guess support for relative URLs should be trivial and make the
repositories more portable. And as far as I can see it should be
possible to have relative and absolute paths side-by-side, no?

If it's a matter of portability, users can still put the metadata inside
the repository itself (if they put the repository in a directory based e.g
git/local file system). It's just that they need to explicitly put the
metadata URI in the settings when adding a repository.

If users want to make a zip collections, they need to put the metadata
somewhere else outside the zip. I agree with Ale though that most users
probably prefer this, they can just put a zip and the metadata file in
dropbox or google drive for example.

Cheers

Hi Matthias,

I think I missed your point before. I think I will add a flag in the
metadata that users need to put, to state whether the repository is using
the same protocol as the metadata or not. This way it could be more
portable to use the repository in different protocol. For example users can
clone a repository from git and use that repository in the local without
having to change the metadata file itself.

Cheers

Hi Akbar,

Do you really need a flag? I think you can just check if the scheme is
specified in the URI. If it's missing, assume the same protocol.

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing-R multiple fields error
Message-ID: <96be1384-badf-7b4b-b5ac-beab89dc72e7@gmail.com>

Hi all,

a couple of days ago I reported a bug in when creating an R script and
one of the input is `ParameterTableMultipleField` [0].

I had a look at the code an maybe I solved a part of the issue, that is
the algorithm GUI does not complain anymore.

But I'm sill not able to use the outputs of that parameter. If I load
some random Fields and I just try to print them in the R console, I get
this error:

Source:
"/tmp/processing8e0411a7ebc64ffc9f75b69d1f7e1f5e/f3653d7497eb4d62b0ffaf62c7a5631c",
layer: "dataexp"
with 102 features
It has 6 fields
multiple field Layer="SN;Y"
Error: unexpected symbol in "multiple field"
Execution halted


Here the piece of the super simple R script:
##Basic statistics=group
##Layer=vector
##Field=multiple field Layer
>Field


And the fixes of Processing are here [1]. Just one file, an import
missing and a small import problem (file is
processing/gui/ListMultiselectWidget)


Anybody has an idea? This could be a super feature to have

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Nicklas,

Just a heads up that this is still an issue with 2.16.0; however now it 
seems to be even worse now:

  - the "Clear" button for clearing the cache has now been changed to an 
icon with arrows, that is confusing to the user.  I think a button with 
the words "Clear Cache" makes more sense.
  - I just now spent 4 hours trying to get a service to appear in QGIS, 
and the issue was that pressing the clear cache icon in QGIS 2.16.0 
wasn't actually clearing the cache: I had to go into 
C:/Users/Jeff/.qgis/cache/data7/ and manually delete the contents of 
that folder, and magically my WMS service worked in QGIS

Keep your heads up for that issue.

-jeff

Hi,

we are now about 30 people on the wiki lists for the hackfest in Bonn and we
added some more accomodations to the github wiki:

https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2016_Code_Sprint#Registered_Attendees
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Hackfest---Bonn---August-2016

but I have heard, that there are still people missing on the wiki list and
there are also still (about 10-15) people looking for accomodation. Please
add your names (also important for us to organize the dinner).

We are in contact with places close to the basecamp. If you need help,
please send an email directly to me, so I can organize something for you.

Regards,
Otto

Hi Nathan, 

no problem. Just wanted to send you some input. Hopefully it helps. You
are doing a lot for the project and I understand that during 2.16 you
were focused on the styling dock. 

As always: thanks for your efforts!

Hi,

here are some news for people who are still looking for accomodation in
Bonn. We called some hotels and this is the result: 

2 have still enough space for the 10-15 people that are probably still
looking for rooms.:

1) IBIS Hotel (5km from Basecamp), but with good connection by public
  transport http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-1441-ibis-bonn/index.shtml
 
  Costs for Single and Double are the same (128€) for 2 nights from 21.-23.
  August. 

2) Hotel Garni Jacobs (15 min walk)  http://www.hotel-jacobs-garni.de/

  Enough rooms for 10-15 people. Costs are 65EUR/75EUR for Weekend/Week in a
  single room and 90EUR/100EUR for Weekend/Week in a double.

Since we have no idea how long you want to stay and what you prefer, we
would kindly ask you to make a reservation personally. And if you need help,
we can assist, of course. Just send me an email.

Regards,
Otto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding SQL provider to QGIS
Message-ID: <e101a2a2-b04c-820d-c6e5-d27dbbc78404@adtechgeospatial.com>

We developed DB2 support for QGIS using the ODBC driver that is built in 
to QGIS/Qt for Windows. But the ODBC driver isn't built in on other 
platforms and using ODBC on other platforms is sketchy.

Is it possible to build and use the Qt DB2 driver with QGIS and is there 
any documentation on how to do this?

At one point I was able to build the Qt DB2 driver but haven't been able 
to get it recognized and loaded in the QtCreator environment, let alone 
with QGIS.

Does the Qt DB2 driver have third party dependencies?

For the Oracle provider we have a modified QOCI driver that is built with QGIS
when it's dependencies are available, but that usually not the case on
platforms other than (osgeo4)Windows either.

Yes, probably similar to Oracle.

How do you build the driver? Does it end up being a new QGIS executable 
or does it just create an additional DLL with the QOCI driver?
We want to avoid requiring end-users to build complete QGIS from source 
- it is hard enough for experienced developers to get this to work ;-)

We've managed to build the Qt QDB2 driver DLL but have not been 
successful in having a Qt application load it.

David

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapSettings: store layer pointers instead of
	layer ids?
Message-ID: <b6a60af6-621b-f4f7-0dcb-16ebb4171157@gmail.com>

Hi

For a project I need independent QgsMapCanvas instances, in particular a 
child view which is unrelated to the main view (including its 
layertree). (Easy example: the main view displays a city, and if the 
user clicks on a "show building schema" button in the building feature 
attribute dialog, the schema of the building is opened in a secondary 
view. The layers of the building schema should not appear in the main 
layer tree however).

Currently this is not possible: while one can set the layers 
individually for each QgsMapCanvas, the QgsMapSetting ends up storing 
the layer ids and hence they must be stored in the QgsMapLayerRegistry. 
Items which are stored in the QgsMapLayerRegistry will always be visible 
in the application legend tree.

So I was thinking about whether it would make sense to store the actual 
QgsMapLayer pointers instead of the layerIds in QgsMapSettings, so that 
the whole rendering process is independent of QgsMapLayerRegistry.

I haven't yet investigated extensively how invasive such a change would 
be, but are there some initial opinions?

Thanks
Sandro

You can use QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer, False) -
the layer will get to the registry, but it will not end up in the
layer tree. Doesn't it solve your problem?

Oh, why think small when you can think big... I think I somehow just

Hi Sandro,

I think it's a good idea to reduce the usage of the registry where
possible. Reducing dependency on this singleton will not only help
moving towards multi-canvas but also towards multi-project.

The main thing to watch out for is not to use map layer pointers outside
of the main thread and to clean them up when a layer is deleted.

Message-ID: <F9FD4AD5-D73C-47D2-8CF0-43537D31D0D4@kartoza.com>

Hi

Apologies if this is a side topic from actual development

I have a potential client who wants to use QGIS API in their app. They live in a complicated bureaucratic  world and need to get legal advice to ensure they are properly GPL v2 or greater compliant. Does anyone know of a good lawyer who deals with this stuff? Preferably someone you have used before that you can vouch for? And no simply reading the license is not enough for them they need to have legal review.

Thanks!

Hi Tim,
You may be better off asking the OSI - https://opensource.org/ - I'd guess this is the sort of thing they can help with, or at least point you in the right direction.
Cheers,

In master it was correct by

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/2134112aab2defda41e8d16c3ddd27a17e66f553

Works fine now, as far as I can see.

HI,

This is the report for the 11th week of GSoC.

*What did you get done this week?*

   - *Implemented Remote HTTP(s) ZIP Handle. *User can make a repository in
   HTTPS with zip collections inside that repository.
   - *Implemented Authentication.*This is only useful for Remote ZIP
   handler as other handlers (git, filesystem) use diferent protocol
   - *Added some verification if downloaded collections exist in the file
   system - *if not uninstall the collection
   - *Wrote unittests*

I made a short video to demonstrate how remote zip handler and
authentication can be useful here: https://youtu.be/xBiI3OGy6zs

*What do you plan on doing next week?*



   - Some small tasks: more unittests, add pep8, file header, scripts for
   packaging
   - Documentation
   - Meet with Richard to make some collections

*Are you blocked on anything?*
No

*Other Thought*

   - If anyone has some good collections that should be added in the
   official repository, please let me know, I can spend some time to manage
   the collections
   - I still haven't made the tool possible for the collections to point to
   different handlers (zip, git) in a repository. There is something dubious
   with this. Why would users want to put the collections in different places
   in the first place? I'll also need to refactor classes as this changes what
   the repository claass is responsible for, and we need to make collections
   handler too (whether it's pointing to zip remote, git, filesystem, etc). I
   don't think this is worth the effort
   - I was thinking that maybe it's better for users to specify the type of
   the repository first (whether it's git, filesystem, or remote zip
   repository) and validate the url based on that selection. Rather than
   guessing what the handler is from the given url. WIth this, we can also
   give users more options from selected handler, e.g if they choose the git
   repository, in what branch the repository is (right now it's hardcoded to
   master branch).
   - The summary of the installation might be really useful (so that after
   installations, users know what and where the resources are installed). This
   is better not a one-time summary, so that when user clicks an installed
   collection, they still can see the summary.
   - Add composer template resource handler. Probably copying the composers
   to the user's local composer template directory is enough?

Hmm sorry if I am just braindumping here :) Have a nice weekend.

Regards

Hi,

for my own private anjoyment (role playing) I hacked the OpenLayers Plugin
to work with Stamen terrain-background. As I think having a background
which _only_ consists of physical features might be interesting for other
uses, too, I suggest to you to add this to the OpenLayers Plugin.

(I would have sent you a patch, but my abilities to hack python are very
rudimentary...)

Hi Arne,
have a look at the QuickMapServices-plugin.
There are already some Stamen backgrounds available.
Maybe the one you look for is there too. Have also a look at Settings/More  
services/Get contributed pack

As far as I know, OpenLayers will be replaced by QuickMapServices

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 3 - breaking user projects?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashe9a4s90vgzicrBL_yXTctXy8LFaLOz+30KTuKS=suBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm wondering - what's our stance on breaking users projects for QGIS
3 (in extreme circumstances, obviously)?

There's 2 related changes I'd like to make:



1. Kill the old composer attribute table classes:

I'd like to kill off the old composer attribute table classes. Here's
the situation:

- there's currently 2 type of attribute tables in composer, one is the
old one which only allowed single frames, the other is the newer type
which allows tables flowing across pages
- since 2.6 all projects have created the newer composer tables - it's
been impossible to create new tables using the old classes, but
projects with existing old tables could still be used

I'd now like to remove all the code regarding the original tables. It
amounts to 1000s lines of mostly unused code. The side effect of this
is that people loading pre 2.6 projects will be missing any attribute
tables from composers.

I think this is a fair option - 2.6 is ancient history and it's not a
big deal to reinsert tables into a composer. Writing transition code
to automatically upgrade the tables would be a couple of hours work
which I cannot afford, and honestly seems like a waste of time to me.



2. Kill off some old expression variables

I've also got a PR in place to clean up the expression classes
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3364). These classes have got very
messy and fragile since the introduction of expression
contexts/variables (due to requirement to keep api compatiblity) and
it's time to fix this. A side effect is that the use of the following
"special columns" in expressions no longer works:

$rownum (has been replaced by @row_number)
$scale (has been replaced by @map_scale)
$map (has been replaced by @map_id)
$numpages (has been replaced by @layout_numpages)
$page (has been replaced by @layout_page)

I'd like to change/rename (eg $CURRENTDATE in composer labels - I

should be killed and replaced with a generic date('dd/mm/yy') type
function).

As an alternative to building and maintaining a bunch of translation code, how feasible would it be to build something like a python project migration tool?

I'm not very familiar with the project XML structure but I'm wondering if it could be done using a python xml library which could update the appropriate bits of the project file without needing to handle the full structure (eg using libxml or something like that).   That would provide some support to users if their projects were broken by the updates without adding to the core code base.  (Similar idea to python 2to3 tool, but a lot simpler of course).  It needn't be perfect - if it handled 95% of cases then that would still be a great improvement.

Note that while 2.6 may seem ancient history from a developer point of view, for users in secured corporate environments it can be difficult to get newer versions of software approved and installed.  I suspect that running older versions is more widespread than you might think!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 3 - breaking user projects?

Hi all,

I'm wondering - what's our stance on breaking users projects for QGIS
3 (in extreme circumstances, obviously)?

There's 2 related changes I'd like to make:



1. Kill the old composer attribute table classes:

I'd like to kill off the old composer attribute table classes. Here's
the situation:

- there's currently 2 type of attribute tables in composer, one is the
old one which only allowed single frames, the other is the newer type
which allows tables flowing across pages
- since 2.6 all projects have created the newer composer tables - it's
been impossible to create new tables using the old classes, but
projects with existing old tables could still be used

I'd now like to remove all the code regarding the original tables. It
amounts to 1000s lines of mostly unused code. The side effect of this
is that people loading pre 2.6 projects will be missing any attribute
tables from composers.

I think this is a fair option - 2.6 is ancient history and it's not a
big deal to reinsert tables into a composer. Writing transition code
to automatically upgrade the tables would be a couple of hours work
which I cannot afford, and honestly seems like a waste of time to me.



2. Kill off some old expression variables

I've also got a PR in place to clean up the expression classes
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3364). These classes have got very
messy and fragile since the introduction of expression
contexts/variables (due to requirement to keep api compatiblity) and
it's time to fix this. A side effect is that the use of the following
"special columns" in expressions no longer works:

$rownum (has been replaced by @row_number)
$scale (has been replaced by @map_scale)
$map (has been replaced by @map_id)
$numpages (has been replaced by @layout_numpages)
$page (has been replaced by @layout_page)
$feature (has been replaced by @atlas_featurenumber)
$atlasfeatureid (has been replaced by @atlas_featureid)
$atlasfeature (has been replaced by @atlas_feature)
$atlasgeometry (has been replaced by @atlas_geometry)
$numfeatures (has been replaced by @atlas_totalfeatures)

Expression variables have been around since 2.12, so there's been
plenty of time for users to fix their expressions. Again, I've toyed
with the idea of writing an automatic translator but
1. I don't have the time

That's a good alternative. The conversion wouldn't actually be that
complex - it's just a matter of time really.

Sounds like a perfect opportunity for one of these companies to step
up and sponsor this work...

Hi all,
agreed:
* let's drop compatibility
* make this very clear in release notes
* offer the opportunity to sponsor an external utility (a plugin?) to
convert old project.
Thanks.

Forwarding this message from the user list about some Registry troubles.

What about the idea to make the 'ini-file- based QSettings type the
default QSettings system for ALL Operating Systems?

Some context:
- on windows the QSettings info is in the Windows Registry, on Linux it
is an ini-file in ... and on Mac ... I do not know
- if you use the --configpath option it is ALWAYS an ini-file

In general I think it is just easier to instruct users to either throw
away or edit a file then fiddling in the registry..

QGIS3 would be a nice place in time to do this?

Richard Duuivenvoorde

I finally fixed my crash on every exit of QGIS 2.16.

Since my previous post my PC was replaced and I tried a fresh install of
2.16.1 but still got the crash every exit.

I ended up deleting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QGIS branch from the
registry.

Even though it was a fresh install of QGIS I think my user profile meant
the old registry values followed me to my new computer.  This fixed the
issue but was a bit heavy handed as I lost a lot of customs settings.  I
exported the branch from the registry before I deleted it.  Merging it
back into the registry caused the problem to reappear.  I tried deleting
a few of the more complex looking sub branches but didn’t find the
registry value causing the crash.  Finally I deleted the whole
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QGIS branch again, then started QGIS and with
GIS running I merged the branch back  into the registry, I then exited
QGIS without getting a crash!  I no longer get a crash on exit and I
retained almost all of my settings - active plugins, recently used
paths, expressions etc.  I lost a couple of thing that must be saved on
exit such as the layout of the layers panel and the browser panel, but
all good.


Cheers,

Martin

I also get a crash every time exiting 2.16.  (On Windows 7 32 bit, OSGeo
installer).


I deleted the .qgis2 folder from C:\Users\<username> but still got a
crash on every exit, also tried running the OSGeo installer and
selecting “Reinstall” for every item, currently using 2.14.3


Nice to know (sort of) that I’m not the only one.

Hi Paolo,

After checking the links in the tickets:


   - US National Park Service https://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/map-symbols.cfm
   *.* It's in AI file, need to extract each SVG one by one
   - From gfoss.it link, most of the SVGs are too small, they need to be
   edited first. But probably we can make a script to fit all the svgs
      - alberi/trees - Empty SVGs(?)
      - geologia/geology
      <http://gfoss.it/userfiles/file/simboli_geologici_tar.gz> - small SVGs
      - meteorologia/meteorology
      <http://gfoss.it/userfiles/file/Meteorology_tar.gz> - small SVGs
      - frecce del nord/north arrows
      <http://gfoss.it/userfiles/file/N_Arrows_tar.gz> This is nice, I can
      manage it right away
   - http://gis-lab.info/qa/qgis-symbols.html - I don't understand at all,
   it's in Russian cyrillic
   - Road-signs.zip is all good with nice and clear README. I can make the
   collection right away
   - https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/category/markers/ - the icons are all
   in PNGs, need to convert it first
   - http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd/download.php - They are in
   pdf, AI format, need to extract manualy
   - https://github.com/mapbox/maki - Nice, I can import them

I'll make the road-signs, frecce del nord/north arrows, mapbox maki
collections for now

Cheers

Hi Akbar,

Having one nice full blown repo is nice to have as testing repo. But I
would not invest your precious time in converting half baken styling
examples for now.

Should we (as in: not only you, but some community members too) try to
create the 'default QGIS styling' repo? Which then could include some
maps (data?) from the training manual based on those styling?

Feel free to do whatever you think is necessary off course, but creating
repo's is something I would move to the community :-)
Better to give them good docs on HOW to do it then to ti yourself?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

Of course it's back to the community how the tools will be used. I agree
that it's a good idea to provide default QGIS styling that is also in line
with the training manual. But at the end of this GSoC, besides publishing
the plugin and the documentation, I want to also provide some collections
that users can use. I think those 3 collections that I mentioned won't take
much time to prepare.

Cheers

Agreed, possibly the most unfriendly thing in QGIS.

Hi Akbar,

Just wondering - have you given thought to parameterizing the svgs in these
repos? This would make them much more powerful for use in QGIS :)

actually, some scripting to help doing this would also be useful for the
future.

Furthermore, the process can be a good test case to check and eventually
improve the workflow.
Anyway, Akbar, feel free to ask the community for support in preparing
these.

I am +0 on this:

Con:

In windows we often used .reg files e.g. when doing training courses to reset specific settings so that trainees all have the same state (you can just double click on the .reg file to apply it). We also can use the registry to enable things via NSIS installers - for example we make a nightly build of the plugin (http://nightly.inasafe.org) which is packaged as an NSIS installer that makes sure the plugin is activated in the user's profile.

Probably we can do the same things by manipulating .ini files but the current system is pretty easy.

Pro:

Using a unified configuration system on all platforms would be nice...

Regards

Tim

I think having an option to use the registry on windows would be best
then. As Régis also stated, in some enterprise environments it as
apperently not doable to use the not-registry option...

Then we have best of both worlds?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Style Editor request
Message-ID: <CAMwNHLeU2hjZptyGkN5y-RxPKdNPPuBsyCtNMtzTHYUzLV9TZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I sent this request earlier with an attachment (screen shots) and received
back an email advising the email was too big (greater than 80KB)

here it is again without the attachment

Hello Qgis developers…
I have a request for an enhancement to the style editor for raster images,
or if you know this feature already exists as a plug-in or in a more recent
release (I’m working with 2.8), please let me know)

Some background…. I work for the US Geological Survey on projects that map
fires and burn severity using Landsat imagery (see http:\\mtbs.gov). We are
unable to map all fires and know that many local fire managers would like
to map fires that we cannot due to time and budget constraints.  All of our
MTBS processing uses proprietary software.

With funding support from NASA and the US National Park Service we are
developing a Qgis plug-in to allow users to perform a Landsat image-based
burn severity assessment.

One of the important steps in the process requires the user to visually
evaluate a signed 16-bit gray-scale image known as the Differenced
Normalize Burn Ratio (dNBR). Higher dNBR values correspond with higher burn
severity, and there is a dNBR value that corresponds to a threshold between
burned and unburned vegetation.

During this visual evaluation, the user is trying to determine the
burned/unburned and high severity thresholds in the dNBR image. These vary
from fire to fire and the process is essentially a trial and error effort
where user selects a threshold value, colors the dNBR pseudo-color image
and compares it to the satellite image or a copy of the original dNBR.

In the ERDAS/Imagine software package, the raster attribute editor allows
the user to display the entire range of dNBR values in pseudo color.  Then,
using the mouse/cursor or “Criteria” (e.g. values >= 100) the user can
select a large range of values and color code them all at once.

In QGIS style editor, the user can also display the dNBR image in
pseudo-color, but the user must specify the number of “classes” to show,
from 5 to perhaps hundreds.  5 is too few and even 50 is too many because
the user may only select one class at a time to assign a color rather than
a range of classes.  So the more classes (gray scale levels) the user
chooses for gray scale resolution, the more tedious it becomes to color
code the classes.

Enhancement request:   Allow the user to select multiple pseudo-color
classes at one time. A “left-click select” followed by a “shift left-click
select” would be sufficient.

Enhancement request: Allow the elements in the display area of QGIS to be
manipulated (zoom, change display order etc) while the “properties/style”
interface is open.  During the interpretation process, it helps to be able
to make these manipulations without having to close then reopen the style
interface.

We hope to release our plugin in early 2017, and I am writing up a
user-guide describing the step-by step process to order Landsat imagery,
pre-process it, and subsequent steps to interpret the dNBR using the
plug-in we’re developing.

I can send jpgs showing a dNBR.tif and the final classified image
(_dnbr6.tif) and some screen shots of style editor and the dNBR imagery.  A
pseudo-color image would provide more precision if the number of class
intervals were set 100. (The min and max of -200 to 800 was set by me
because I already knew the range of relevant dNBR values for this fire.
Note the full range of dNBR values is -1454 to 1750 and for the final
pseudo-color image I changed the max changed to 1400 to fill in the values
above 800 ).

The 6 class dNBR image was created using thresholds interpreted using
ERDAS/Image Raster attribute editor, the thresholds are <80 (unburned, Dark
Green), 80 (burned not burned) 81 – 420 (low severity), 421 – 775 (moderate
severity, yellow) and >775 (high severity, red)

Thanks for your consideration of this request.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can send
screen shots if that would help.

Please acknowledge receipt of this request by return email.   Thanks again.

Steve.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] featureID changed to row number
Message-ID: <57A88D61.3080109@jena.de>

Hi all,

in former versions QGIS' featureID used to be indentical with the 
primary key value of a PostGIS layer (if the field was an integer or 
similar)
Now (QGIS 2.16.1) the featureID seems to be identical with the row number
My questions:
1) has this been changed by intention?
2) If yes - why?
3) if yes - since when (version)?

Please enlight me

regards

Bernhard

Message-ID: <0AC478ABD0BC8740B773FA46332BC8B83C922803@DE-CM-MBX22.corp.capgemini.com>

Hello,

I'm importing SLD in QGis Essen, and I note that unit for parameter (thickness for example) in setting layer styles are always in millimeter.
But the application I used to export my SLD uses pixel as unit.
Is there a parameter in QGis that allow me to change this default unit ?

Hi Bernhard,

The behavior has been changed only for 64bit signed integers in QGIS 2.16.

Hi Matthias,

thanks for the hint. I was guessing that it was connected to a mapping 
for bigint primary keys Jürgen talked about the other day. Hmm, will 
have to rethink if I can avoid bigint PKs.

Message-ID: <CAKWoFMJ7amhe0vp3NDsuSHna7+e-SvZmr9uS3nEmLZmtsuhWpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is it intentional or a bug?
I case of relations:
When trying to select child features in parent's attribute form either
using a attribute table view or a form view child features won't
become selected. In the table/form features get high lighted but the
actual layer selection won't update.

This is the case with 2.14.5 and with nightly release on windows.

Should I create a new issue? (couldn't find one yet)



Kind regards,

-Lauri

Hi Lauri,

This was done intentional. In case you have multiple feature forms open
in parallel, which one is authoritative? If you click "delete selected"
in form A would you also expect features from form B deleted? With the
selection being isolated in the feature form, these are no issues.

If you can come up with a good plan avoiding unexpected behavior for the
user and a good usability, please propose this as a feature request.

Bests,

Matthias

This discussion seems to not resolve the issue.

Default units in SLF is pixel, and QGis always interpret it as millimeter.
Even using solutions mentioned in this discussion.

Hi Matthias,

I see your point.

Would it work if the selection updates globally and the "delete child
features" deletes only child features of the current parent (button
disabled if selection doesn't include any children of current parent).

Currently selection in normal attribute tables updates globally if one
has more than one attribute table open. I would expect the same
functionality with child forms/tables.
Are there now any way to actually select child features?



Thanks,

Lauri

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C578462D@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi

I'm playing around with the QGIS (d01bfd1) snap functionalities in python and I'm trying to get it return all the segments in the vicinity of the point of interest.

    sl = QgsSnapper.SnapLayer()
    sl.mLayer = canvas.currentLayer()
    sl.mTolerance = 50
    sl.snapTo = QgsSnapper.SnapToSegment

    snapper = QgsSnapper(canvas.mapSettings())
    snapper.setSnapLayers([sl])
    snapper.setSnapMode = QgsSnapper.SnapWithResultsWithinTolerances

         (retval, result) = snapper.snapMapPoint(point_of_interest_in_map_coordinates)

If I choose a point near two coinciding polygon edges I only get one result.

If I choose a point near a place where three different polygon edges meet at the same point, I still only get one result.

I though using the snap mode SnapWithResultsWithinTolerances (or even in this case SnapWithResultsForSamePosition) would allow the snapper to give me more than one result?

Probably we can add a setting in QGIS to indicate whether settings should be in native or ini style format [1]. Of course that is a bit paradoxical since it will need to read the settings to get the setting for reading the settings .... :-)

I was more thinking like: we make ini file settings default for all OS's
(instead of taking the OS-specific defaults).

And make a startup parameter (or environment variable) so you can start
using QGIS with your OS-specific setting, if you really want?

Yeah or a simple text file in the QGIS share dir which contains the preferred option.

This sounds tempting to do but the focus of the plugin should be for
distributing the collection. But we'll see later if it's really needed.

Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E014A26BD9E@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,



Having a problem dissolving two large multi polygons – one of my students asked why I suggest ‘dissolve’ – when ‘merge selected features’ was so much faster. Dissolve takes ages.



After consulting a master on this issue (Nyall ☺) he suggested that I change the settings -> Options -> Digitizing -> and change "Validate geometries" from QGIS to "GEOS".



Now the dissolve runs smooth and fast



I don´t have a clue about this topic – But my question is: Why is this not standard ?

Hi, 

A question probably for Jürgen. 

In the OSGeo4W distribution - is there a way to get access to nightlies
from the "master" branch? I know that these builds could break regularly
- nevertheless I think it would be useful to have. 

I noticed that "qgis-dev" package is a build of the master_2 branch. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

FWIW - I backported the commits you are probably interested in earlier today ;)

No.  master will eventually become Qt5/Python 3 only.  So packaging master
would only work until that switch is done - and after that Qt5/Py3 is required
that is not yet in OSGeo4W.

Is there any plan regarding this?

Are you in charge of packaging Qt5/Py3 in osgeo?
Do you have an idea about the time frame?

I am wondering how we should deal with plugin compatibility.
In other words, if we wait a bit of time before making packages with
Qt5/Py3 available, shall we have a description for plugins to tell with
wich Python version they're compatible?

Thanks,
Denis

I am holding back with changes that have a hard requirement on Qt5/Py3
until major platforms have these dependencies available.
Do you have different plans?

osgeo4w, yes.

I did build Qt 5.7 - but only started with the packaging, no python3, no PyQt5,
no QGIS based not it.

Not really.  After the Qt4 support is removed.

This is a general question, that is not tied to OSGeo4W.  The plugin manager
and the plugins site will have to deal with this.

QGIS3 will be Qt5/Py3.  So anything available for >=3 (and >=2.99 once we
remove Qt4 support from master) will have to work with it.  So it might not be
necessary to address that separately.

For me master is in development and packaging can be done when it settles.

The linux platforms already have Qt5/Py3 and OSGeo4W will eventually catch up.
So what needs doing can be done in master right away.

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks for the details, I thought we had to wait for the switch to Qt5
on qgis-dev on Osgeo.

So if I got it correctly:
* We can drop Qt4 support from master whenever needed.
* Nightly packages of master3 will be provided later. (Will they be
called qgis3-dev to distinguish their dependencies from qgis-dev ?)
* Plugins supporting QGIS3 are Py3 compatible.

:)

Thanks,
Denis

Hi,

Bernhard just pointed out a mistake in the German translation in 2.14.5
(For "Automatically create transaction groups").

I have checked in transifex, but the string is correctly translated
there. Are the translations for point releases synchronized (and the
correction on transifex is just very recent) or do such translations
need to be fixed in a different way (e.g. github)?

Thanks

Matthias

Sounds like the same chicken-egg problem we had with debian and
QtWebKit. Mutual waiting on others to do the first step.
Feel free to do the first step without waiting for stuff to be broken ;)

The translations from transifex are only pulled in on release.  Updates in
release branches have to be done the "old" way (eg. using linguist).

Personally I'd rather wait till all existing tests are passing on the qt 5
builds before breaking the qt4 ones.

Otherwise we run the risk of these handful of remaining unit tests breaking
inadvertently.

Hi,
Is this supposed to stay like this? I think that people will be really
puzzled and complain about this. And why would a common user want to keep
2.16.0 and 2.16.1 and so on...?
It seems that it affects also 2.14 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15387)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with QGIS server on CentOS - self compiled
Message-ID: <ed0618c7ab32ce244cbd908c14baf522@carto.net>

Hi, 

I self-compiled QGIS Server (on CentOS 7) and it works fine for
GetCapabilities and GetProjectSettings commands, but fails for GetMap. 

In the Apache log I get an error: 

libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.5.13
libpng warning: Application is running with png.c from libpng-1.2.56
libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library

I checked libpng and there is "libpng-1.5.13" on my machine in
/usr/lib64. Within the gdal source tree (also self-compiled) there is a
is a second version of libpng, which seems to match libpng-1.2.56 

Do you have an idea how I can influence the QGIS server fcgi file to
pick up libpng-1.5.13 first? 

I tried to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and set "/usr/lib64" first, so I assumed
it picks up the newer version first. But it still fails ... 

Does libgdal.so contain the older version of libpng which conflicts? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAFN_Nvb13daYn1k_BrcCDKXNv0u5EDtm2tOFcpRqay3GLXjsag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to setup a value relation edittype by pyqgis. I can use
setWidgetType but then, none of the following seem to work:

vlayer.valueRelation(index).mLayer = target_layer.id()
vlayer.valueRelation(index).mKey = key_field
vlayer.valueRelation(index).mValue = value_field
vlayer.valueRelation(index).mAllowNull = True
vlayer.valueRelation(index).mOrderByValue

I also asked this question at GIS stackexchange (
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/204175/how-to-set-and-configure-a-value-relation-edittype-in-qgis-2-14)
but no responses so far.

Does anyone know how to configure the value relation from python?

Thanks,
Josef

QGIS is packaged in EPEL, so that would be another option.

	without primary key
Message-ID: <a6f3953e-985a-ff29-4aec-0db7cc412c64@gmail.com>

Hi, 

I just noticed that feature.id() always return 1 when iterating on a
postgresql layer which has no single column primary key.

Using the demo data qgis_test.book_authors, in console writing, 

for f in iface.activeLayer().getFeatures():
  f.id()

prints out

1
1
1
1

Anyone knows where the issue come from?

Thanks,

Denis

It's http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15223 - pretty nasty, and I can't
think of a good (ie, not slow!) workaround. It's what pushed me back
to Qt4 builds for the present.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Pyqgis - QgsComposerLabel issues with Html
 rendering (state = 2) in QGIS 2.16
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5_M1233u6c=z_ffMCXkXf50RCAuQ3Grf5g_r-bWzdZvw@mail.gmail.com>

​​
Hi folks,

In one of my plugins I create a QgsComposition and fill it with some
QgsComposerLabel items. Extract of code :

http://paste.debian.net/788195/

In 2.14, this works fast and well -> my HTML is well rendered when
exporting the composition to pdf.

In 2.16, generation take ages, and the exported PDF shows blank labels with
no rendered content.

If I comment the line 17 ( with : cl.setHtmlState(2) ) and test again in
2.16, PDF generation is as fast as in 2.14, and text is rendered (but
oviously HTML is not rendered, only plain text ).

It seems there is an issue with HTML rendering in my QGIS context with QT.
What would you advise me to do to understand what is going on here ? What
can I try ?

NB: is here my QGIS "about" information data:

HI David, 

Thanks - I am aware that there are packages. But there are two main
reasons why I want to self-compile: 

* being able to use certain configuration options or supporting
databases that are not supported by the standard package (such as Oracle
support) 

* being able to test new features from github regularly 

I still haven't fixed the issue with the two incompatible libpng. Seems
to be more a runtime issue with Apache fcgi and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. BTW:
output as JPEG works fine ... 

I will post again if I was able to fix the issue. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Instead of using QgsSnapper classes, try QgsPointLocator. The old
snapping classes around QgsSnapper will be removed in QGIS 3.0 as they
have been replaced by QgsPointLocator and QgsSnappingUtils anyway -
the new classes perform better and they are easier to use. They are
available in API since QGIS 2.8.

The following should work for you to get all segments in vicinity:

loc = QgsPointLocator(canvas.currentLayer())
results = loc.edgesInRect(QgsPoint(2.0, 2.0), 0.5)

The "results" variable will contain matches with all edges around
given point with specified tolerance.

Martin

Hi Martin

My goal was to use the snapping functionality to snap to the nearest edges/vertices and when a snap occurred I would evaluate the features involved in the snap. If two or more edges where equally close (ex. on top of each other) I needed to remember which ones it was.

Using the methods of QgsSnappingUtils I only get one match back. Is it possible to get all the matches back or do I need to use the QgsPointLocater afterwards to determine if I was snapping to more than one feature? I see no reason to make two lookups if the results I'm looking for is available already.

Regards, Casper

Have you considered using COPR so other could benefit from your work and
potentially help out? (
http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/03/11/intro-coprs/ )

There are already a few COPR repos, but a "nightly" one would be a nice
addition for this interested in testing out the latest and greatest. I'm
not sure if the Oracle stuff would run into licensing issues, but if not,

There are more way how to do it - one as you say would be to check
with individual QgsPointLocator instances. Internally the locators
build their cache, so subsequent calls are fast anyway.

The other option would be to use QgsSnappingUtils::snapToMap() with a
custom filter (an optional argument in various QgsSnappingUtils and
QgsPointLocator methods). Your filter does not need to filter out any
matches, but instead it can collect any relevant matches that would
not be returned otherwise. See for example here [1].

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FAHAYJYrHwvoZLoO9XbxXRQw51J-ocHcDL4vP8TwDX8w@mail.gmail.com>

While trying to convert a DXF file using the dxf2shp plugin, I'm getting a
strange .shp.shp file instead of the name I have chosen. This makes it very
useless as QGIS can not recognise it as a valid vector layer later.

But, if I overwrite an existing file, it saves just fine.

This is happening to me in 2.14 and 2.16.
Is there any workaround?

What are the remaining advantages of using this instead of loading the
dxf file using add vector layer?

Hi Martin

Thanks for the reference to your nodetool and the concept works great for me. Its cool to know about the locators cache too. I have always thought of filters as being an object for the method to use and not an object which can collect and afterwards return information. My mind is expanding...

Hopefully I'm now a step closer to being QGIS 3.0 compliant :)

Hi Martin

When using the QgsSnappingUtils and between snapping make some changes to the features in the layer I'm snapping to, the snapping mechanism stops working.

Example: 

1. I have enabled snapping
2. The user snaps to an edge.
3. I then cut up a geometry (the one the user snapped to), replacing the geometry of the snapped feature and insert new features for the remaining geometries from the cut.
4. Snapping now only works on the geometry which weren't changed and part of the changed geometry.

Cut pseudo code:
    geometry = QgsGeometry(f.geometry())
    (result, other, pts) = geometry.splitGeometry([p1, ..., pn])

    # Update feature.
    layer.startEditing()
    layer.dataProvider().changeGeometryValues({f.id() : geometry})
    # Insert new feature.
    f2 = QgsFeature(layer.pendingFields())
    f2.setAttributes(f.attributes())
    f2.setGeometry(other[0])
    layer().dataProvider().addFeatures([f2])
    layer.commitChanges()

I can think of two reasons here. Either I do the cutting in an impropriate way or I need to update an index somewhere.

Can you point me in the right direction?

Regards, Casper

Use layer.changeGeometry() and layer.addFeatures() instead of the
methods from data provider. They do not notify the rest of the app
about the changes, so the index does not get updated.

Maybe even better you can use QgsVectorLayerEditUtils.splitFeatures()
to cut features (it will do the splitGeometry calls, change geometries
and add features).

Hi Martin

Going through the layer object works much better, thanks yet again :)

Since I cannot remember all the syntaxes and ways to do stuff I found this page, which I have found so many times now:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html

The page suggest that you go through the data provider. Perhaps that is not the best way to go anymore, or does it depend on what you want to do?

Hi Casper,
this page may need some update. Not many pythonistas are currently
available to improve the PyQGIS Cookbook pages so once you went through the
process and are aware of the best practices on this side, a couple of code
sample or hints would be very welcome.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou

I can give examples of how I did a few things, but I will definitely not be able to determine if my examples cover all situations or if the current examples provide an overall better solution.

Hi Casper,
this page may need some update. Not many pythonistas are currently available to improve the PyQGIS Cookbook pages so once you went through the process and are aware of the best practices on this side, a couple of code sample or hints would be very welcome.
Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi Martin

Going through the layer object works much better, thanks yet again :)

Since I cannot remember all the syntaxes and ways to do stuff I found this page, which I have found so many times now:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html

The page suggest that you go through the data provider. Perhaps that is not the best way to go anymore, or does it depend on what you want to do?

Use layer.changeGeometry() and layer.addFeatures() instead of the methods from data provider. They do not notify the rest of the app about the changes, so the index does not get updated.

Maybe even better you can use QgsVectorLayerEditUtils.splitFeatures()
to cut features (it will do the splitGeometry calls, change geometries and add features).

Cheers
Martin

Thanks, it helped a bit - it still does not have Stamen terrain-background
or something comparable, but it has two other maps I might use eventually.

I might try to add Stamen terrain-background when I get around to it -= but
I expect this will take some months.

Hi Arne,
adding Stamen terrain background will not take months but a few minutes.

You can either use the Add\Edit\Remove tab under settings, or just copy a  
Stamen folder in qgis2/QuickMapServices/Contribute/data_sources and put it  
into /.qgis2/QuickMapServices/User/data_sources and then adjust the naming  
of the folder and of the settings in the metadata.ini

which looks like this then:

[general]
id = stamen_terrain_background
type = TMS

[ui]
group = stamen
alias = Stamen Terrain Background
icon = stamen.png

[license]
name = CC-BY 3.0
link = http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
copyright_text = Map tiles by Stamen Design, under CC BY 3.0. Data by  
OpenStreetMap, under ODbL
copyright_link = http://maps.stamen.com/
terms_of_use = http://maps.stamen.com/
[tms]
url = http://tile.stamen.com/terrain-background/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
zmin = 0
zmax = 19
y_origin_top = 1

This works quite well, but the service itself is somehow buggy. Lots of  
tiles are missing in deeper zoom levels, both in the browser-based version  
and in QGIS, so the problem is not from QuickMapServices but from the  
service itself.

Hope this helps
Bernd

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iKcqAkafNsLP-QC2jDu1s+gap0G0XDzbJT2u7sTBbCsrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is my last report of the GSoC project. I would like to thank Ale and
Anita as my mentors, Richard (esp. for allowing me to visit his hackerspace
in Denhaag and taking me to Indonesian restaurant :)), Tim, Martin, and
everyone from QGIS community.

*Brief Description*
The project idea is to make svg, symbol, and style sharing easier. The idea
of the implementation is changed (from the web service architecture to
distributed directory based repository system). Nevertheless, the aim of
the project is still the same.

*The state of the project before my GSoC*
There was not any tool that allows QGIS users to do this.

*The addition that your project brought to the software*
With this new plugin it's easier to share resources among QGIS users and
hopefully we will have rich collections (whether it's icons, svg, images)
to make cool maps.

*Links to access the relevant code and documentation for the user to get
started with testing your application.*
I put these in the slide, but I will write it again:

   - Slide: http://www.akbargumbira.com/slide_gsoc2016
   - Plugin VCS:  https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing
   <https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing>
   - Plugin Test Repository:
   https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_data
   - Plugin Documentation:
   http://www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_resources_sharing

*Slide*
I hope this slide is informative enough for people who don't follow the
project from the beginning: http://www.akbargumbira.com/slide_gsoc2016

Note that I haven't published the plugin to the plugin manager. Will do
later tonight or tomorrow.

Cheers

Thanks everyone for the great work, particularly you Akbar! I really
enjoyed working with you.

Looking forward to putting this new plugin to good use in the upcoming
weeks.

Hi

Thank you so much for everything. This has been a really well run GSOC project - both from your side and from the input and mentoring you have received from Ale, Anita, Richard and others who have pitched in. I hope you will be back for more next year, and stick around in the project to contribute and participate in the community further. Why not consider making a pitch for the QGIS grant programme[1] next?

Hi Ale,

Thanks, it's nice to work with you too. Sorry if sometimes I think too much
of possibilities though I know that you already gave me direction most of
the time :)

Thanks, I hope I could publish the plugin today. The last 2 day I've been
testing on Windows and I think it's all fine.

Thanks, but I think I will just maintain the plugin and maintain the django
site (if there's anything to fix) , and perhaps next year I'll apply for
GSoC again.

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt 5.5 Conversion from QVariant to QString is
 broken for double and float values
Message-ID: <3bdfe292-738b-816d-cd6b-9880ddadd57e@gmail.com>

Hi all,

While looking at failing tests on Qt5, it seems that QgsJSONUtils test
is failing due to a regression on Qt 5.5.
Conversion from QVariant to QString is broken for double and float
values [0].
It seems to have been fixed in Qt 5.7

Especially QgsJSONUtils.encodeValue(5.9) returns '5.9000000000000004'.

What would you suggest?

* Don't care and discard failing test with Qt 5.5 - 5.6? (is this really
an issue?)
* Use a custom toString method to fix this?
* Bump min Qt version to 5.7?
* ....?

Cheers,
Denis

Message-ID: <7f156ae5-0f14-103e-1669-edce6f5aa979@opengis.ch>

Hi guys, any idea on this? it is still the same problem of
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-July/043744.html

I removed all packaged qgis stuff, and installed all the 2.16.1
packages, same result.

I'm on ubuntu xenial with http://qgis.org/debian xenial in apr sources

self compilation has no issues.

ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] master and PyQt5 evolutions...
Message-ID: <37C3D764-1CFA-4A7D-BCB6-EA06E95363BA@medspx.fr>

Hello devs,

I would like to know if it is OK to replace the few PyQt4 methods that have been modified in PyQt5 directly into master branch ? The code is not correctly ported with 2to3 because this is a PyQt evolution and not a python3 improvement. 

For example, QFileDialog.getOpenFileName in PyQt5 is the new name of QFileDialog.getOpenFileNameAndFilter in PyQt4 (which returns a tuple and not only a string). There is no getOpenFileNameAndFilter in PyQt5. If I "port" to the PyQt5 method, the code will not work anymore in PyQt4.

Of course, I could make a lib2to3 custom fix class (like in fix_pyqt.py) but it seems to be very complicated (well, for my skills).

I can also test for the current PyQt version directly in the code, before launching a QFileDialog method, but this is not very elegant.

What are the rules for the master branch with not retrocompatible PyQt5 code ?

Cheers,

IMHO Qt really dropped the ball on this one. Such an annoying blocking
bug to have present in their LTS release!

I'd go with:
- minimum recommended version >= 5.7
- allow builds with 5.5/5.6, but with a prominent warning in the
release note that strings such as map grids, etc will be ugly!

I'd love to just say we put a hard minimum version of 5.7 (and avoid
all the numerous bug reports which are bound to come in!), but I don't
think that's realistic given the glacial pace some of our supported
distributions move at...

There's discussion here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Windows-builds-of-the-master-branch-td5280168.html

Personally I don't think we should break qt4 builds until we have all
the existing tests passing on the Travis qt5 builds.

Hi all,
does this have any impact on our developmant?
All the best.

-------- Messaggio Inoltrato --------
*Week 12 Report [Final] blogpost link
<http://gsoc2016gdaldwg.blogspot.ru/2016/08/week-12-report-final.html>*


Brief description of the idea.

The aim of my project was to extend GDAL supported formats with DWG.


The state of the project as it was BEFORE your GSOC.

There was a DWG support, but it was not built-in by default, and GDAL
Driver was based on third-party library Teigha (which is not X/MIT
licensed, not even close).


The addition that your project brought to the software.


Libopencad (GDAL CAD Driver engine)

Overview

Libopencad is a library written in C++11, which provides a way to
read/write CAD (DWG/DXF/DXFB) files. It was designed to have a uniformal
API to work with any CAD files. It has a base class - CADFile.
Inheriting this class it’s possible to create a ‘driver’ for any CAD
format, all you need to do - is to overwrite interface functions like
‘GetGeometry(index)’, and others. Now it has an implementation for
DWG2000 (R15), but only for read.

Library comes with ‘cadinfo’ utility, which prints out everything
library can get from file - header variables, CAD custom classes,
presented layers and geometries with their attributes.

Internal structure

Library presents CAD objects in different ways - base class CADObject
and other CAD...Object classes are exact analogues of how DWG format
stores information about its objects. CADGeometry, and other classes
which inherits it, are done for API access to CAD...Object classes.

Library supports 3 modes of reading - READ_ALL (means everything which
can be extracted from CAD file will be read) READ_FAST (skipping some
kind of meanless information - linetypes, CRC check, etc), READ_FASTEST
(only geometries reading, additional info is skipped).

When parsing the file, library does not store any information it does
not need. First, it reads file meta-information, and creates a file map.
It only stores some info about presented layers, and header variables.
Then, when calling application uses CADLayer.GetGeometry(index), it
actually reads a geometry from file, using prepared file map. Sometimes
it will be slower than having everything you have read in cache, but
gives you more flexibility what you want to store in memory, and what
you wont.

Library also has special classes which incapsulates I/O functions, so
it’s possible to reimplement them for your needs - by default it uses
std::fstream, but you can make it possible to work with network by make
a class inherited from CADFileIO.


Supported geometries list:

Point, Circle, Ellipse, Arc, Text, Solid, Spline, Line, Polyline 2D,
Polyline 3D, LWPolyline, Ray, Raster (Images), MText, MLine, XLine,
Polyface Mesh, 3DFace.




GDAL CAD Driver

Overview

GDAL CAD Driver uses libopencad as a datasource. Not everything that
libopencad can read from file is mapped into OGR infrastructure, but it
will be done in near future. Current features are:

 1.

    OpenOptions are presented with 2 options:

- MODE - READ_ALL/READ_FAST/READ_FASTEST (means the same as library
OpenOptions).

- ADD_UNSUPPORTED_GEOMETRIES_DATA (YES/NO) - unstable feature, if some
of the objects cannot be mapped into OGR representation (or its just not
implemented yet), it will be presented as a CADUnknown object -
OGRFeature without geometric representation, but with basic info -
geometry type, some additional params.

 2.

    CAD header variables are mapped into metadata.

 3.

    Unlike DXF driver, CAD driver stores vector data in the appropriate
    layers (not all entities in single layer).

 4.

    Raster subdatasets are also supported.

 5.

    Coordinate system is extracted from DWG file (if it is presented in
    accordance with ESRI Docs for DWG files), or from %FILENAME%.prj
    file in the same directory.

 6.

    CAD Geometry attributes mapping is completely done into
    OGRLayerDefn. So, any ACAD BlockReference attributes will be seen in
    OGRLayerDefn.


Add all the links (hopefully permanent) to access the relevant code and
documentation for the user to get started with testing your application.

During the planning stage, I decided to separate my project into 2
parts: separated CAD formats support library (named libopencad), and
GDAL driver, which uses it. Library can be used by itself for any
reason, and will be maintained after GSoC.

Hi Paolo, 

I'll let Jürgen comment in more detail. 

But their approach is different to the libdxfrw approach. Also - again
the main bottleneck would be the limited OGR features styles. Also, the
approach Jürgen will do will generate label/symbology rules as good as
possible and provide caching in a SpatiaLite or geopackage file behind
the scenes.  

But it is good to have choice. If we can enable this in our "Add Vector
Layer" dialog as well, people could then decide whether they want the
OGR DXF/DWG driver or the QGIS native one through libdxfrw. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Calvin

I’m facing the same problem and before I go home I just wanted to ask if you found a solution to this problem?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with using QGIS Custom Widgets

I am using Qt Designer to add a QgsColorButtonV2 to the ui of a QGIS plugin. I am using uic.loadUiType to load my .ui file. Specifically here is the line of code:

FORM_CLASS, _ = uic.loadUiType(os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(__file__), 'heatmapdialog.ui'))

When I load the plugin in QGIS I get the error:

---------------------------
ImportError: No module named qgscolorbuttonv2

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python\qgis\utils.py", line 306, in startPlugin

    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)

---------------------------

In my code I have the import line:

from qgis.gui import *

From the QGIS console if I do that import, QgsColorButtonV2 is available.

It appears that uic.loadUiType is the problem. How do I solve this?
Thanks,
Calvin

Hi,

QgsColorButtonV2 is a QGIS custom widget.

When compiling the UI file having a custom widget, uic needs to find the
qgis gui library which has its definition.

That means you have to specify the QGIS python directory in your python
path. This works fine when using pyuic4 in command line.

I am not sure about uic.loadType. Why not using pyuic4 directly?

Maybe this is relevant:

Cheers,
Denis

Yes I did. When you save the file it uses the C++ header so in my case it
had the following:

 <customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsColorButtonV2</class>
   <extends>QToolButton</extends>
   <header>qgscolorbuttonv2.h</header>
  </customwidget>
 </customwidgets>

You need to replace qgscolorbutton2.h with the PyQT/PyGIS gui module. In
this case it is:

<customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsColorButtonV2</class>
   <extends>QToolButton</extends>
   <header>qgis.gui</header>
  </customwidget>
 </customwidgets>

I think this works for all of the custom QGIS widgets. Unfortunately, every
time you save using Qt Designer it overwrites qgis.gui and you have to
manually go put it back in.

I hope this helps.

Calvin

Hi, 

Answering myself: with the help of Mathias I was able to resolve the
issue. Apparently I had two different library versions of gdal installed
in /usr/local/lib, one with external libpng and one with internal (older
libpng). Apparently, at runtime it was decided to pick up the older
version, while QGIS was compiled against the newer version. After
cleaning up any old gdal libraries and reinstalling from source,
everything went smoothly. 

Thanks all and esp. Matthias! 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Best way to share QGIS scripting techniques
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqZG8jMmwQ_ufVEPJkiNS5w0PNp1xnL85BRw-Go4rgVTw@mail.gmail.com>

Recently, I needed to create a set of images using a vector data set that
contained dates. I wanted to iterate across years to generate the images.
The TimeManager plugin works perfect for this, except I needed more control
of the output image - the type of control I get from the Print Composer.
To accomplish the task I created the Print Composer to generate the layout
that I wanted. Then I wrote a python script that communicated with the
TimeManager plugin to set the date and then called the Print Composer's
generate tiff image routine. It worked great.

I think this would make a good how-to tutorial. Where is the best location
to put such a tutorial and is there a public data set that you would
recommend that I could use for the tutorial because my data set is not
sharable. It would need a date field.

Thanks!!!

I get exactly the same result as Yves. I can't get the POST request to work
with QGIS server 2.14.

Therefore replicating this example with OpenLayers and QGIS server doesn't
seem to be possible.

Hello,

I try to run a WFS POST request with QGIS server 2.14 without success. I can
get the answer from the similar GET request but not with the POST method.

Anyone tried with success such request? Any working example even if I have no

The page is somehow outdated... You can go directly through data
provider, it is the most efficient way, but probably most often you
want to do the updates to vector layers through QgsVectorLayer methods
because these will notify other parts of the code about the changes,
and they are integrated with undo/redo functionality, so you as a
developer (or user in GUI) can roll back any pending changes until
they are committed (that's the point when data provider's method are
called internally).

Hi,

A short note to the future reader on

... if used correctly. I've seen dataprovider methods called in loops
and I/O roundtrips adding up to way slower behavior than if the layer
methods had been used. The efficiency difference normally is negligible
but there's much to loose.

Hi Martin

I guess what you are writing is exactly what should be written in the cookbook. If you want to handle stuff and updates yourself use the provider. If you want QGIS to sense and react to your updates, use the layer.

The page is somehow outdated... You can go directly through data provider, it is the most efficient way, but probably most often you want to do the updates to vector layers through QgsVectorLayer methods because these will notify other parts of the code about the changes, and they are integrated with undo/redo functionality, so you as a developer (or user in GUI) can roll back any pending changes until they are committed (that's the point when data provider's method are called internally).

Yes I did. When you save the file it uses the C++ header so in my case it had the following:

 <customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsColorButtonV2</class>
   <extends>QToolButton</extends>
   <header>qgscolorbuttonv2.h</header>
  </customwidget>
 </customwidgets>
You need to replace qgscolorbutton2.h with the PyQT/PyGIS gui module. In this case it is:

<customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsColorButtonV2</class>
   <extends>QToolButton</extends>
   <header>qgis.gui</header>
  </customwidget>
 </customwidgets>
I think this works for all of the custom QGIS widgets. Unfortunately, every time you save using Qt Designer it overwrites qgis.gui and you have to manually go put it back in.
I hope this helps.

Hello,

You can try to remove the "maxFeatures="200" " if you have it in your request.

It was the problem for me. We corrected this in the last release of QGIS 
(probably 2.16 but I am not sure?)

​A blog post would work as Tom mentioned. If you don't have a blog, I can
offer you to write a guest post on my blog.

Another place would be the PyQGIS cookbook.

Concerning datasets, I've used e.g. OSM data (contains timestamps for last
update per feature) in the past. There is also some public movement data
that could be used.

Best wishes,
Anita

Your search through API docs was effective, there indeed isn't a
dedicated API call for that :-) The information is stored within
project properties and you can read the enabled state like this:

QgsProject.instance().readBoolEntry("ScaleBar", "/Enabled", False)

This will return a tuple (is_enabled, success) where the first value
is the value you are looking for, the second one just tells whether
the reading of the project property was successful.

Hope that helps!

Hi,

Has anything changed regarding the way SVG icons are handled in QGIS 2.16 ?

My python plugin's toolbar doesn't display well anymore in QGIS 2.16 :
- QGIS 2.14 :

- QGIS 2.16 :


My SVGs are 64x64 pixels, and I add them to the toolbar using this code :
QIcon(os.path.join(pluginDir, 'icons/config.svg'))

Thanks for any hint.

Christophe

Hey Christophe,

I won't answer your question directly I'm afraid, but there might be a
better-practice / compatibility improvement you can do to your icons.

Question first: are the background O\D elements text objects, or paths? If
the answer is text objects, you'd be better transform those into paths.

Hi Mathieu,

Thank you very much for your advice.
Backgrounds were indeed text objects, they now display well on QGIS 2.16 
after I transformed them into paths.

I still wonder what has changed with QGIS 2.16...

Have a nice day,

Hello,

I can confirm this. I am also using composer scripts, which crash on 
Ubuntu Xenial with 2.16.1 from the official qgis.org repositories.

Something seems up with Python tools using HTML rendering, maybe this is 
linked to this bug?

   https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15301

For now I'll be staying staying on 2.14, but I'm happy to provide more 
debugging information.

Cheers,
François-Xavier

Subject: [Qgis-developer] JSON parsing
Message-ID: <CAKOK4jjLe4_6iFfx5tWtSz_6kjBukSO4WY9MS0Fo3O62Y4Jeng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

For my editor widget stuff, I need to parse JSON (to get the stored the
widget config from the DB). I've seen that the arcgirest provider uses
qjson for that, so I've tried to use it. Works fine on my machine, but
fails to compile on Travis (missing include file for qjson/parser.h). Now,
I've seen that the arcgisrest provider is not compiled in Travis. That
explains why it is green without my patch.

Now, can I add qjson-dev as dependency to the Travis build in master?

For QT5, there is a JSON parser included, so I could #ifdef the hell out of
it and use the Qt parser if in Qt5.

What do you guys think?

Thanks.

The arcgis stuff will be ported to the Qt5 parser and Qt4 support will
disappear in master.  So adding qjson will only help for now.

And there's also possibility to parse json without qjson in Qt4 (used in the
wms provider to parse GetFeatureInfo responses in json).

Just wondering - why not XML in the database? It's how styles are stored,
so it'd be nice to keep consistency.

The widget config is a QMap<QString, QVariant> and it was easier to convert
a JSON into that. But yes, this is a good idea (eventhough I hate XML).

OK, switching to that.

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Attribute values changes in SHAPE FILE on save
 (even though the attributes weren't edited)
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C5788557@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have a shape file in QGIS (2.16.1 and master 0a07fee) with one polygon and around 20 attributes. According to the TableManager plugin two of these fields have the type "String(1)" and outside QGIS I can tell that their value is HEX 20 (a space character).

After changing the geometry a bit I save the layer. The result is that also the attributes are changed (the DBF file). There are differences in the header, where the "change date" has been updated [1]. But also the two fields of type "String(1)" are updated:

    HEX 20 (the space) is changed to HEX 3F (a question mark).

In front of one of the two fields 10 characters are changed from HEX 20 to HEX 2A (a *).

My initial thoughts are encoding, badly defined shape file or finally a bug in the way QGIS handles the shapefile.


Can anyone give me a hint as to why this is happening?


Regards, Casper

Isn't the widget config stored in the style anyway?

Or is it for a plugin? In this case why not use `import json`?

Anita,

Thank you for your reply. I may take you up on your offer for a guest post
or else look into PyQGIS cookbook. What is the public movement data that
you mentioned?

Thanks,
Calvin

​Good, let me know if you want to write something. I was thinking of this

Message-ID: <CAOnR-i+CvoWhrBTG+=P_=eSz_JELvn=2XwMHgUj0sqHePa+AXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just knew about this problem (which actually has been there for quite
some time). It seems that the released QGIS 2.16 for Ubuntu 16 is packaged
without QtWebKit. I see that other plugins: lrs, InaSAFE, qgis2web,
QuickOSM (and many others probably) are affected too.

   - LRS: https://github.com/blazek/lrs/issues/9
   - QGIS2web: https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/309
   - QGIS Resource Sharing:
   https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing/issues/25
   - Quick OSM: https://github.com/3liz/QuickOSM/issues/84


I tried to compile QGIS without QtWebKit and I could replicate the issue.
The problem is that as python plugin developers, we couldn't do much as the
QtWebKit module from python side is actually there. I thought I could just
try to import QtWebKit and if it's failed just use QTextBrowser. But the
crash happened when we try to call some methods (and we couldn't catch it
from the python side). Of course for some plugins they might be able to
compensate this (either using QTextBrowser as an alternative or just remove
it). Personally for my plugin, I would hesitate to replace QWebView with
QTextBrowser as this problem only affects Ubuntu 16 users with the released
QGIS 2.16. Of course we could check the host, but again some users also
compile QGIS themselves.

So, what should we do to overcome this issue? Is there perhaps a flag (e.g
telling if QGIS is compiled with/without webkit) that we can use?

Cheers

Hi,

I'll take the opportunity of being at the codesprint to try to reduce the
amount of WKB usage in the code.

For those being at the code sprint, don't hesitate do drop by if you have

I confirm, a number of other plugins are broken, e.g.

Cxf_in
FAOSTAT Data Downloader
gaeta
LRS
OpenLayers Plugin
Plugin Builder

It would be very good to solve this, however I do not see a simple fix.
All the best.

Isn't it as simple as shipping QGIS linked with QtWebKit? It's available
everywhere except Debian unstable.

even there couldn't it be compiled? The /rules and /controls should be

As I understand it, this is fixed in master/2.17/dev, but the fix has not
been backported to 2.16 for a point release.

- is that summary correct?
- if so, will 2.16 be patched with this fix?

Thanks

Tom

I've replied on the other thread about this issue. However, just to state
that eg QTextBrowser is not an option for me, obviously, since I'm using
QtWebKit for web pages.

At least in Win7 64 bit many plugins either ignore Qlonglong fields or regard
them as text.

It is quite annoying to have to store attributes as Real to be able to work
in Qgis - especially since you have to add decimals as real 10.0
automatically is being converted to Qlonglong. And if you create a field as
short integer next time you open the shape file it is being regarded as
Qlonglong.

Hi Morten,

This is something that needs to be solved in the many plugins
themselves, so it would be best to start opening issues there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remove layer from layer tree without destroying
	the layer
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C5789C75@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have added a layer to the layer tree and now I want to remove it from the layer tree:

self.layer = self.create_my_layer()

QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().insertLayer(0, self.layer)

QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().removeLayer(self.layer)

But it seems like my layer has been destroyed while removing it from the layer tree. Is it possible to not destroy the layer while still removing it from the tree?

Hi All,

as I know, with 2.16 version,  "FTools" plugin disappeared,  included into
"Processing".

But, some useful function also disappeared, it seems to me, as  the old
SRS PRJ saver.

:(

I wrong ?   There is an equivalent, and where ?


Thank you for any info  (and sorry for my bad english)

If you are present at the hackfest here in Bonn and would like to show off your work informally to a very receptive audience of fellow QGIS lovers, can I invite you to register your talk / presentation here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Hackfest---Bonn---August-2016#presentations-at-the-hackfest

We will try to record the talks some how.

Hi Richard,

Which issues exactly? What if you leave the attachments on redmine for now?

It would be great if we could make a step forward in this matter.

We discussed this at length at the PSC meeting - our plan to move forward is:

1) Lease a new Hetzner VPS for Redmine
2) Deploy the latest redmine + the OAUTH plugin on it
3) Migrate existing content from the old redmine to the new
4) Discontinue any repos, wikis etc. in redmine except for the QGIS code base


If anyone out there is able to help with this migration process your help will be most appreciated.

Running the newer redmine will hopefully provide a little more modern experience whilst still satisfying the needs of those who wish to benefit from its feature set.

Regards

Tim

Sounds great! Will we also discontinue hosting 3rd party plugin's
issue trackers on the new instance? (please say yes!)

It is possible - just temporarily disable the bridge to map layer
registry before removing the layer:

QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRegistryBridge().setEnabled(False)

... and then enable it again.

You should make sure to remove the layer from the map layer registry
later when you have finished using it. Otherwise if user saves the
project, that layer will still be referenced (and loaded when the
project loads) but it will not be accessible from the GUI.

Cheers
Martin

Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fg_Ndv_Az2dwbOzGd-5pse6GXQ=ktj-uPN=0t2Cah0bbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

While testing the resource sharing plugin, I found that some symbols cause
the preview area to change behavior and show the full symbol name instead
of cutting it off at some fixed length.

Here you can see the fixed length in the style manager versus the full
length in the style panel:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ajbe5q2d8as821/Screenshot%202016-08-23%2014.22.36.png?dl=0

The full length names make the preview area really messy and uses up a lot
of space. Any idea what causes this behavior?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

It's seems that the issue has been fixed in QGIS 2.16 and available in 
QGIS 2.16.1
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/47cf9240b3e6362cabbcb5e21956f6a33e4079fa

I'll backport it in QGIS 2.14 LTR!

Hi all,
reading the list at:

it seems to me that some items have already been addressed, some maybe
even fixed. Could you confirm which ones are still valid?
Should we prioritize the remaining ite, or redefine them as

Dear Community,

there will be a change in the QGIS PSC. 

I (Otto) decided to step back from my PSC role as Community Advisor. I
enjoyed being part of the PSC for a couple of years but realized that I
won't find enough time in the future for this job anymore.

At the hackfest in Bonn the PSC decided not to recast the Community Advisor
role. Instead there will be team managers who together with a team of
contributors will take care about the tasks this role has included so far.

In this context we are happy to announce that we have already found two well
known community members to fill this gap - Lene Fischer from Denmark and Yves
Jacoline from France. Lene will concentrate on community tasks and Yves on
documentation.  

More details about the new structure will be announced by the PSC in the
near future.

Best wishes
Otto

Message-ID: <1471969453615-5282056.post@n6.nabble.com>

Are there any gotchas when reading and writing boolean project settings? I'm
getting baffled by why I can't get mine to work properly:
QgsProject.instance().writeEntry("qgis2web", param,
value)QgsProject.instance().readBoolEntry("qgis2web", param)[0]
These store and retrieve values for GUI checkboxes:
if isinstance(value, bool):    if value:        self.setCheckState(1,
Qt.Checked)    else:        self.setCheckState(1, Qt.Unchecked)
I don't know if isinstance still recognizes the value as a boolean after it
has been saved and retrieved.

Hi,

Thanks Paolo for raising this.

I do think we should :
- set a definite release objective for 3.0 ( date / content)
- minimize the risk of not reaching this goal

This list is a good start for gathering what is needed for 3.0. It is
named QGIS3_api, so I imagine that it only contains modifications we
want in the API ? It would be good to have a full list of things we want
to have for 3.0.

It would be great if we could :
- have a full list of things we would like to see in 3.0, and especially :
  - API breaks
  - Code refactoring
- Then qualify them as necessary/useful/nice to have, discussing in the
tickets whenever assigned labels are not trivial to set or not everybody
agrees
- Then get an approximation of time/funding needed for necessary issues
(at least these ones)
- ...so that we can secure funding for the necessary issues ( at least).
Maybe through the Grant Program or QGIS.org funds ?
- ...so we can communicate with confidence on a 3.0 release date

First steps are to be done by the developers, the sooner the better.
How does that sound to you ? seems doable ? Nice way to proceed ? Do we
have alternative strategies ?

We do need to have a clear communication on the 3.0, and be confident in
it. I do think releasing in Feb. 2017 is doable, but we should state
this, so that users can be prepared, and developers continue to work
towards this aim.
If we have a better idea of the effort needed, then we can improve our
developement efforts, our (own) funding effort, and improve external
fundraising if needed.

My 2 cents,

Vincent

Hi all,
we are currently busy migrating the good old redmine to a new
infrastructure. We intend, for various reasons, to migrate only the data
for the main application. We would therefore appreciate if you could
move your projects (mostly plugins, some extra stuff) to another
platform of your choice, remove the project from hub, and update
metadata.txt on plugins.qgis.org accordingly.
Do not hesitate asking in case you need assistance.
All the best.

We've been closing as they are fixed, so everything still open is
outstanding.

I don't think anyone's specifically working through that list yet - we are
very much still in the "cleanup" phase and removing years of legacy cruft.

There's still a lot of work to do to remove all the remaining deprecations,
but at least with every removal the code gets a bit cleaner and future
tasks are easier.

So far everything has been done by just a handful of devs in their spare
time. I'm not sure how useful it is for someone to specifically prioritize
them. I think it's being driven more by how annoying each individual dev
finds that part of the API!

I'd say we are still very early days in the work towards 3.0 and release
checklists could come later.

Hi Paolo: thanks for the info.  I've backed up some relevant
MetaSearch wiki pages.

I'm guessing the issues will be ported over as part of the migration?

Cheers

Hi Nyall,
thanks for your reply. Here at the HF we are discussing about this, and
it seems to me that the work can be split in two major areas:
* removal of cruft and general cleanup
* implementation of new, better APIs.
It seems that the first phase is being done, partly automatically, in
large part manually, in small steps, whereas a good part of it could be
made automatic, with some perl magic etc.
So my proposal: set aside some of our budget for QGIS grant to allow key

How does it sound?

I disagree - yes, some of this was done using scripts in the past (the
removal of V2 from names), but I'm sure Jürgen would agree that there
was still a lot of manual grunt work required.

Personally, I'm ULTRA cautious whenever removing things marked as
deprecated, because they are still sometimes used in the codebase or
core python plugins. It takes a lot of careful grepping through the
code to make sure there's no unpleasant side effects (especially since
only processing has unit tests which would inform us of breakage).

Is there any concerns about the current approach? I've been thinking
progress is moving along nicely...

I'm sure none of us would object to being paid to do work we currently
voluntarily do ;)

Hi Paolo,

how can I remove the projects I created? I didn't find any button to do 
that on hub.
If I cannot do that myself you may remove DataDrivenInputMask and 
DigitizingTools now.

best regards

Bernhard

I can do that, whan you confirm all the good info has been safely moved
elsewhere, and metadata updated.

Paolo,

I have moved the open tickets to github and updated metadata on 
plugins.qgis.org accordingly. Plugins' metadata.txt files will be 
updated with the next relaese of the respective plugin.

thanks

Mmm, unfortunately not :-(

Because of the (old) Redmine version some redmine2github exporters we
found on Github just did not work (at least not for the
QGIS-application). We also hit the 'api-throtteling-limit' pretty soon...

We are preparing a dedicated server, now to run a recent version of
Redmine. But we choose to only run the issuetracker, so no
wiki-pages/project pages anymore. The Redmine is a vanilla as possible
to minimize work on updates/wikispam etc etc.

BUT: as MetaSearch is a core plugin 'your' plugin's will be in the
QGIS-application ones?

Regards,

Richard

So can/should we use the wiki at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki instead?

Yes, correct.  MetaSearch is a category within QGIS-application.

Message-ID: <1472060086435-5282208.post@n6.nabble.com>

I don't know if this deduction from a lot of banging my head against a bug is
correct, but this seems to me to be the behaviour:

1. QgsProject.instance().writeEntry() a variable with spaces in the variable
name
2. Read it back in - this works
3. Save your project
4. Read it back in - works
5. Close your project (open a different one, or close QGIS)
6. Reopen your project
7. Read it back in - fails

This does not seem to affect var names with no spaces. So the spaces are
being stripped, but only when written to the project file, not when they are
still in memory?

Can anyone confirm? Is this a bug?

We prefer that you do not use the wiki. The reason is that over time content in a wiki becomes stale and useless because generally people do not maintain their wiki pages well. We prefer that you maintain application documentation in the QGIS Documentation project and developer documentation in the Doxygen docs directly in the source tree. This way content will also be versioned so that you can always get content appropriate to the version of QGIS you are running.

Our intention is to use the GitHub wiki only for:

* Organising hackfests
* Providing links to PSC meeting minutes

Similar content which does not need to be maintained and is only there for archival purposes.

Thanks!

Tim

Hi devs, I have developed an experimental code to support more than one map in QGIS. I created a video showing the features implemented ( https://vimeo.com/179982647 ).
The main features are:
   
   - New user option to enable multi map canvas mode.   

   - QGIS has one no closeable default map, and 0-N extra dockable maps.   

   - Full integration of maps in legend using a new map legend node for each map.   

   - Print composer supports layouts with different maps.   

   - New legend menu option to synchronize the extent of maps.   

   - Map tools and plugins work with the current selected map (The signals and slots to the map canvas are updated with an automatic mechanism of synchronization to minimize the migration of code and to preserve behavior).   


I'm aware that this is a big change in QGIS, and I am sure that this capability must be debated by many people (project and developer leaders...) before writing any code. Because of that, I have not created any QEP entry in the https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals page. 
I developed it to learn QGIS core and it will have work to do (plugins and tools). But it runs fine, and it was funny :-). If at least, it is useful for a day to implement this capability in QGIS or to see the amount of changes needed, I am satisfied.

Since https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/469 (quite old) you're supposed to
get a warning message in the console when using invalid keys.

Keys must be valid XML names in order to be properly saved to the file.

To me, being able to use invalid keys in the first place could arguably be
considered as a bug. It would maybe be better to have an exception thrown
in these cases.

Best regards,

Olivier

Hi,

yesterday Daniel Morrisette(?) of Mapserver asked me if the mapserver
export is still working good enough to name it in his FOSS4G mapserver
talk today... I totally forgot about it :-(

if anybody has good information, please let me (or Daniel direct) now
about current status. I haven't used it for a long time myself..

Hi,
it should work, but certainly is not up to date with current symbology
bells and whistles.
Thanks for the interest.

Mmm, I cannot even find it anymore in QGIS. Is it still around?

Reading this:

http://docs.qgis.org/1.8/nl/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_mapserver_export.html

it's not and I remember it is only working with 'old symbology'...

So we only have the rt-export plugin:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/rt_mapserver_exporter/

which needs mapscript...

Ok, will report this to daniel.

Thanks for response..

Richard

Not, the idea is to migrate only core, and let plugins have their own system. Most are on github anyway.
Thanks for helping.

Hi,
Really nice feature in my opinion. Out of curiosity: would it be possible
to split Map 1 and Map 2 between two different screens? It would be really
nice to be able to drag Map 2's window to a second screen.
Thanks
Cheers

Ah, OK. Thanks! No console warning message, as far as I can see. I'll
sanitize the var names myself. What I'm more interested in is that reading
from memory works, but when the vars are written to file, it changes.

I think setting invalid var names should throw an error in 3.0.

Thank you very much Paolo!
Of course, I have no problem to create a QEP if the QGIS community thinks this is interesting (and also the developer committees are agree the code).

Hi Alvaro,
compliments for your work. Looks interesting to me, from an user point
of view.
All the best.

The extra maps are normal windows as any dockable window in QGIS. It is a QDockWidget object, and your behavior is as usual.

Hi,
Really nice feature in my opinion. Out of curiosity: would it be possible to split Map 1 and Map 2 between two different screens? It would be really nice to be able to drag Map 2's window to a second screen.
Thanks
Cheers

Hi devs, I have developed an experimental code to support more than one map in QGIS. I created a video showing the features implemented ( https://vimeo.com/179982647 ).
The main features are:
   
   - New user option to enable multi map canvas mode.   

   - QGIS has one no closeable default map, and 0-N extra dockable maps.   

   - Full integration of maps in legend using a new map legend node for each map.   

   - Print composer supports layouts with different maps.   

   - New legend menu option to synchronize the extent of maps.   

   - Map tools and plugins work with the current selected map (The signals and slots to the map canvas are updated with an automatic mechanism of synchronization to minimize the migration of code and to preserve behavior).   


I'm aware that this is a big change in QGIS, and I am sure that this capability must be debated by many people (project and developer leaders...) before writing any code. Because of that, I have not created any QEP entry in the https://github.com/qgis/ QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals  page. 
I developed it to learn QGIS core and it will have work to do (plugins and tools). But it runs fine, and it was funny :-). If at least, it is useful for a day to implement this capability in QGIS or to see the amount of changes needed, I am satisfied.

Message-ID: <2692ec25-54d8-9bec-0e90-15e46aec0ec5@opengis.ch>

Hi all,
I'm trying to move some git repos (multiview, pluginsstarter,
scattergramdentify)
from hub.qgis.org to github but I fail.

I tried

git clone  gitosis at qgis.org:multiview.git
Cloning into 'multiview'...
ssh: connect to host qgis.org port 22: Connection timed out
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

I tried to readd my ssh key to redmine but the page
http://hub.qgis.org/my/public_keys

is not available any more.

any hints?

ciao
Marco

Hi

Alvaro I also think this would be very interesting to add - and timely to get into QGIS 3.0. Looking forward to hearing opinions from other devs. I expect there will be many many corner cases you will have to deal with where there is currently an implicit assumption that only 1 canvas exists....

Regards

Tim

You have done an amazing job in the QGIS project and in the PSC over the years -having great user documentation is a huge selling point for QGIS. I thank you on behalf of everyone in the project and we look forward in collaborating with you in the future, even if you are no longer actively serving on the PSC.

To Lene and Yves, a huge thank you for stepping in to fill Otto's shoes - we could not have asked for more capable substitutes!

That would be great thanks Akbar - please do so if you haven't already done so!

Thanks Tim! You are right, there will be many code with this assumption. It is true that I have only reviewed the main tools in QGIS, but these changes have been small or zero. At least we can know with this commit the amount de changes to do in the main application (100 files edited, some of them with minimum changes).

Regards
Alvaro

Hi
Alvaro I also think this would be very interesting to add - and timely to get into QGIS 3.0. Looking forward to hearing opinions from other devs. I expect there will be many many corner cases you will have to deal with where there is currently an implicit assumption that only 1 canvas exists....

Tim

The extra maps are normal windows as any dockable window in QGIS. It is a QDockWidget object, and your behavior is as usual.

Hi,
Really nice feature in my opinion. Out of curiosity: would it be possible to split Map 1 and Map 2 between two different screens? It would be really nice to be able to drag Map 2's window to a second screen.
Thanks
Cheers

Hi devs, I have developed an experimental code to support more than one map in QGIS. I created a video showing the features implemented ( https://vimeo.com/179982647 ).
The main features are:
   
   - New user option to enable multi map canvas mode.   

   - QGIS has one no closeable default map, and 0-N extra dockable maps.   

   - Full integration of maps in legend using a new map legend node for each map.   

   - Print composer supports layouts with different maps.   

   - New legend menu option to synchronize the extent of maps.   

   - Map tools and plugins work with the current selected map (The signals and slots to the map canvas are updated with an automatic mechanism of synchronization to minimize the migration of code and to preserve behavior).   


I'm aware that this is a big change in QGIS, and I am sure that this capability must be debated by many people (project and developer leaders...) before writing any code. Because of that, I have not created any QEP entry in the https://github.com/qgis/ QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals  page. 
I developed it to learn QGIS core and it will have work to do (plugins and tools). But it runs fine, and it was funny :-). If at least, it is useful for a day to implement this capability in QGIS or to see the amount of changes needed, I am satisfied.

Message-ID: <CACfnYnTmucNVNikLFyE5rnu6Tr7OJyrS_gpa3mabdFG9U5mGfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Tim,


> We discussed this at length at the PSC meeting - our plan to move forward is:
>
> 1) Lease a new Hetzner VPS for Redmine
> 2) Deploy the latest redmine + the OAUTH plugin on it
> 3) Migrate existing content from the old redmine to the new
> 4) Discontinue any repos, wikis etc. in redmine except for the QGIS code base


I was under the impression that we were leaning towards to migrating
to GH issues tracker.
What was the main reason behind choosing Redmine again? technical
issues? lack of time to solve them? Will the migration to a new
Redmine version be effortless?


> If anyone out there is able to help with this migration process your help will be most appreciated.

I'm available if necessary.

cheers!

Hi!

Did I miss something or isn't it just a question of cloning it locally
and pushing it to github?

I have not tried that yet (because all my plugins are already on github)
but I think that should work. (though you might have to either delete
the .git directory or change some parts of the config file inside the
.git directory - or even init the locally cloned repository as a new one)

regards
Werner

Hi Paolo,
you can close http://hub.qgis.org/projects/easycustomlabeling. It has been
ported to GH a long time ago and old Redmine issues are saved to GH now.
Thanks for the cleanup :)

Me too. I'm still convinced that this is a _very_ sub optimal solution for everybody. 
Pity we really want to stick with something that forces us continuing having two different, non integrated tools where one could have done it in a great way.

Hi,

The issue tracker was discussed almost 1.5h at the board meeting - and 
it wasn't a clear and unanimous decision. Some board members (including 
me) also changed their minds during the discussion. Apparently not all 
core devs were happy with the quite limited filtering and structuring 
options that github offers. The issue tracker is certainly quite 
limited, compared to other issue tracker offerings. Offering only labels 
is quite limited. In addition, migrating all the existing tickets from 
Redmine to Github turned out to be non-trivial - and we don't want to 
loose the old issues.

Finally, it is probably good that we are in control of the issues and 
that it runs on free software. The board knows that not all people are 
happy with this decision but one cannot make everyone happy ... we hope 
that the "unhappy" people can still live with the renewed (and faster) 
Redmine.

The issues are migrated to the newest Redmine version and on a dedicated 
machine rented by QGIS.ORG to ensure good performance. This should make 
dealing with issues much more pleasant and more performant.

Big thanks to Jürgen, Richard and Pirmin for dealing with the Redmine 
migration.

Hi all,

Being part of the unhappy, I would like to ask if you have considered
running our own gitlab instance or using a gitlab service?

To me integrated solution should be a hard requirement.

If we have to maintain something like Redmine, why not gitlab. It seems you
can categorize issues.

Hi Denis,

We had a look at hosted solutions (for Gitlab and for Redmine) - but 
most of them had been too expensive for our case - they have a limit on 
the number of users that can be associated with a project, or other 
limits like file sizes/total project size, etc.

Running our own gitlab instance would have been an option, but no one 
volunteered to take on the task of permanently maintaining the 
infrastructure, e.g. dealing with security issues/patching/upgrading, 
spammers, deal with the evil guys out on the web. Maybe if we can find 
someone who wants to take on the task (ideally more than one person), we 
could reconsider to use a self-hosted gitlab.

Note that the new Redmine instance has some integration with github. 
Jürgen, Richard or Pirmin can tell you the details.

What is so bad with Redmine? And exactly what integration with github 
are you missing? Maybe Redmine can do this integration.

Andreas

Hi all,
I am volunteering to install, do maintenance if you'll go the gitlab way. I would have said this from the start but I didn't notice that such a discussion was taking place. I am positive that I would manage this I have good enough experience with system administration and I'm actually maintaning a gitlab private instance for about 2 years now.Although I can manage it on my own it would be very nice if somebody else would also be involved.I can also help with migrating the issues from redmine to gitlab. 
 Regards,Tudor

PS. I think gitlab would be the better option

To add some extra info:

- we put effort in porting the existing issues to github (given the
precondition we want to keep full history with such a move, and not
loose information). But failed both in time and complexity, and
everybody was 'waiting' on a move ...

- also administration/updating the running service was an issue in this.
Because of the old version of the OS it was not so easy to update
Redmine, because of the old verson of Redmine we have a security issue
AND the redmine2github scripts that we found on internet did not work
with this older redmine version...

So having a fast and uptodate OS now, with a Redmine that is easily
updatable (apt-get update) we think this is the best step for now.
Github Integration I think is doable with the plugins, webhooks we use now.

As Gitlab is not in the repo's we would have to install our own, AND we
also were not able to recover the issues.

Now that it looks that we can at least move all our issues + info to an
up to date OS/Redmine version, maybe somebody can do some testing to see
if he/she is able to use newer 'export/import' scripts available... But
note that you VERY early hit in Github throtteling issues....

So: please bear with us for now, and if we have the new Redmine running
(it is at least very fast!), we can always see if there is another
alternative, given the precondition that we want to pull all info over
to another 'system'... we 'just' need somebody to do it :-)

Regards,

Richard

Hi All


A couple of notes from me from the meeting to add to Andreas and Richard's comments:

* We looked at the GitLab issue tracker - the functionality seems close to GitHub's tracker so no category support. This is a blocker for some.
* Until someone has complete and working migration to GitHub or GitLab, the option should be considered off the table since losing our history was considered a blocker.

Please consider the Redmine upgrade an interim solution which gives us:

* Redmine updated to the latest version with improved functionality
* Getting ourselves off the OSGEO authentication framework so we can get rid of the mantra etc. experience
* Hosting on a new server with SSD drives etc and  hosted in europe will make the site much more responsive
* Using oauth authentication means you should be able to log in with your existing credentials from GitHub

In the process we are also streamlining things to get rid of the WIKI and other hosted projects on redmine so that when we do eventually do a complete migration we don't have anything to deal with.

In summary it is a step forward, maybe not the step we all wanted, but it is pragmatic and paves the way for full migration into a unified platform (GitHub or GitLab) later when someone has stepped up to the plate to support doing a complete migration.

Regards

Tim

For your information, there's an ongoing effort to setup
an OSGeo-wide GitLab instance: https://git.osgeo.org/gitlab

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.16 compiling with '-std=c++11',
	Screen refreshing
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBiR6U616z+g+nrUAMupY2S8qA+vg-4MVmfJBHVKR9Y4NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday I managed to resolve dependency problems which prevented the
install of the present QGIS 2.16.

So I am now attempting to compile the branch 'release-2_16', since 2.10 was
the last version that I could compile and use properly.

At 51% it received warnings/errors:

"warning: identifier 'nullptr' is a keyword in C++11 [-Wc++0x-compat]"
"error: 'nullptr' was not declared in this scope"

which I hope will be resolved by adding '-std=c++11' to the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS

I just greped the source and see that 'nullptr' is used quite often and has
been  defined in
- analysis/qgsrastercalcparser.cpp
- core/qgsexpressionparser.cpp
since version 2.8, so I am not sure if this is the correct solution
(compiling now at 48%)

--
While trying out 2.16, I noticed that the Screen refreshing (since commit
2014_05_01) still blanks out the screen when moving around.
This is VERY hard on the eyes and is the main reason why I have been using
the commit of 2014_02_22 since then.

But since there have been many changes since the (geometry editing is what
interests me most), I would like to use the latest version - but without
this eye-sore (including the distracting scrollbar that goes back and forth
instead of a 'busy' cursor).

Is there a way to turn is off?
- i.e. back to previous 'freeze' of the image with 'busy' cursor until the
refresh has completed

I do a lot of georeferencing, so am concentrating on the map while moving,
so this 'blinking' is truly a strain on the eyes.

---
The above solution seems to have resolved the first issue, since it went on
to 54% where it failed while linking qgis.

to `QgsRelationManagerDialog::setLayers(QList<QgsVectorLayer*> const&)')

Which compiler are you using?
CMake should add this flag or an appropriate definition if not available
automatically.

Hello,

Just a note to say that SAC is currently testing an OSGeo GitLab
instance. It is on a temporary server, but may be used freely and can be
used for testing and migration purpose.

What is currently lacking is not setup time, but instead :
* a decision from OSGeo's community on what we do want to use as a
modern software hosting platform
* a maintainance team
* a better server for the definitive setup

I think that if QGIS is willing to migrate to GitLab, using this
opportunity to join forces with current SAC effort would be great.
CCed to Bjorn and Sandro who currently lead the testing effort.

You can already give it a try here (latest GitLab version) :
https://git.osgeo.org/gitlab/

Hmm I thought the whole point of using github etc was so we don't have to
run our own setup and can just deal with making the software?

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBhxQ40=0hqB3JZhick7cgi6Ln3WV+PgWrh6cAVoLQ8BGw@mail.gmail.com>

g++ 4.9.1

After looking for the cause of the link problem, I came to the conclusion
that my (rather old) git copy has gotten a bit 'confused'.

I have made a new copy and have started again (without adding '-std=c++11')
- it is now at 40%, well see how fart it goes.

Alvaro,

as I can see in github repository,  at:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/master...ahuarte47:Feature_MultimapView

As I can see, your  MultimapView  will change many calls, adding parameters.
I suppose therefore that almost all plugins will have to take account of
these new parameters and need to be changed, it is no longer compatible.
We can not adopt a "soft" technique, in the sense that new parameters can be
optional ?

Thank you

Roberto

Hi Roberto,

You may not be aware that QGIS is currently moving toward version 3.0, and
as part of that we have broken compatibility for plugins made for 2.x.

As a result all plugins and scripts will need to be reworked anyway,
including adapting them for qt5 and python 3.

As such it's actually the perfect time to introduce a change like this!

Cheers
Nyall

Hi,
This is a long awaited feature, partially fullfilled by DockableMirrorMap
and Auxiliary windows plugins. I'm glad someone reactivates work in that
area :)
Keeping it simple in API and in UX are the main obstacles. QGIS was seen as
a user friendly GIS because there was no hard multimap ergonomy. We must
find our way to have it pretty simple in a user point of view. Composer's
redesign into Layout is also deeply impacted.

+1 for a QEP, there are so much changes implied in that, UX, API, but also
map and layer presets that currently allow the multimap workflow.

Cheers
Régis

Hi Roberto, I only removed some QgsMapCanvas parameter in some dialog's constructor in the app module, but I can revert it to avoid plugins to be changed if they use it.
For tools and plugins I think I don't break any API. For MapTools you can override the new "setMapCanvas" method if you want update some setting in your own tool. For Plugins I didn't change any code, but there are new methods in QgisInterface object to query the current list of canvas created in the application, defaut map canvas, etc... 
Of course, all advices are welcome, If the qgis dev community want use this commit as start point!!!
Best regards
Alvaro

Hi Alvaro,

Your idea looks very promising and I could probably think of a situation or two where this would be very useful.

I wonder though, why only allow a map to sync with the other maps and not sync to a specific map? If I could sync to a specific map, I would be able to setup four maps where they sync in pairs.

Thanks Tim! You are right, there will be many code with this assumption. It is true that I have only reviewed the main tools in QGIS, but these changes have been small or zero. At least we can know with this commit the amount de changes to do in the main application (100 files edited, some of them with minimum changes).

Hi

Alvaro I also think this would be very interesting to add - and timely to get into QGIS 3.0. Looking forward to hearing opinions from other devs. I expect there will be many many corner cases you will have to deal with where there is currently an implicit assumption that only 1 canvas exists....

The extra maps are normal windows as any dockable window in QGIS. It is a QDockWidget object, and your behavior is as usual.

Hi,
Really nice feature in my opinion. Out of curiosity: would it be possible to split Map 1 and Map 2 between two different screens? It would be really nice to be able to drag Map 2's window to a second screen.
Thanks
Cheers

Hi devs, I have developed an experimental code to support more than one map in QGIS. I created a video showing the features implemented ( https://vimeo.com/179982647 ).

The main features are:


  *   New user option to enable multi map canvas mode.
  *   QGIS has one no closeable default map, and 0-N extra dockable maps.
  *   Full integration of maps in legend using a new map legend node for each map.
  *   Print composer supports layouts with different maps.
  *   New legend menu option to synchronize the extent of maps.
  *   Map tools and plugins work with the current selected map (The signals and slots to the map canvas are updated with an automatic mechanism of synchronization to minimize the migration of code and to preserve behavior).

I'm aware that this is a big change in QGIS, and I am sure that this capability must be debated by many people (project and developer leaders...) before writing any code. Because of that, I have not created any QEP entry in the https://github.com/qgis/ QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals  page.

I developed it to learn QGIS core and it will have work to do (plugins and tools). But it runs fine, and it was funny :-). If at least, it is useful for a day to implement this capability in QGIS or to see the amount of changes needed, I am satisfied.

Hi, there is not problem with this. Simply I did the minor work as possible :-)
Yes, we could show a new item menu with all canvas currently created and then the user define which of them to synchronize.

Asunto: Re: [Qgis-developer] QEP about Multimap support for QGIS    Hi, Really nice feature in my opinion. Out of curiosity: would it be possible to split Map 1 and Map 2 between two different screens? It would be really nice to be able to drag Map 2's window to a second screen. Thanks Cheers       On Thu, Aug 25, 2016 at 2:36 AM, A Huarte<ahuarte47 at yahoo.es> wrote:

 Hi devs, I have developed an experimental code to support more than one map in QGIS. I created a video showing the features implemented (https://vimeo.com/179982647 ).    The main features are:       
   - New user option to enable multi map canvas mode.
   - QGIS has one no closeable default map, and 0-N extra dockable maps.
   - Full integration of maps in legend using a new map legend node for each map.
   - Print composer supports layouts with different maps.
   - New legend menu option to synchronize the extent of maps.
   - Map tools and plugins work with the current selected map (The signals and slots to the map canvas are updated with an automatic mechanism of synchronization to minimize the migration of code and to preserve behavior).
    I'm aware that this is a big change in QGIS, and I am sure that this capability must be debated by many people (project and developer leaders...) before writing any code. Because of that, I have not created any QEP entry in the https://github.com/qgis/ QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals  page.     I developed it to learn QGIS core and it will have work to do (plugins and tools). But it runs fine, and it was funny :-). If at least, it is useful for a day to implement this capability in QGIS or to see the amount of changes needed, I am satisfied.          github: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/ compare/master...ahuarte47: Feature_MultimapView    video: Multi Map Canvas for QGIS

Hi,

I am trying to validate a few geometry layers using "Processing/QGIS geoalgorithms/Vector geometry tools/Check validity" and it immediately fails each time I try with the following message.

Hi Björn

I tried again... before logging to osgeo wiki to be sure about my
credentials... and than to osgeo gitlab, but... no way :(

there is a way to help you to test?

Note that the OSGeo Wiki does *NOT* use the LDAP credentials.
What you could try is logging into a trac instance (where you could
report the issue), or into Gogs (https://git.osgeo.org/gogs)

FWIW, I have had an osgeo account (trac for postgis etc.) for a long
time, and I was able to log into the gitlab instance.

Also, with respect to migration, I think free software orgs self-hosting
is a good thing, but using gitlab hosting seems nice because it's free
software (unlike github) and most importabtly because gitlab is said to
have export/import so one has the option to switch to self-hosting
later.

Hello to all,

For some time I cultivated the intention of approaching the study of
graphs and with / after it, that of directed graphs and networks;
finally the time has come, at least the first step, and I am here to
talk about it with you.

There are a lot of documentation and a lot of software about the
issue, but my little project, built from the ground as a learning aid
to graphs, can also be useful to others, at least I hope so :-)

I wrote a few notes to raise awareness of intentions and contours of
my project and I put it here:
http://www.slideshare.net/giulianc/graphs-plugin-20160829.

I hope to be welcomed with generosity: I'm not a graph expert nor a
professional programmer :-) all comments, suggestions, advices,
supports and criticisms are welcome, even in private.

The code is still unpresentable and therefore not yet deposited
anywhere; nevertheless it is of course available for anyone interested
to view it.

I apologize for the bad English; as you understand, it's not my native
language, thanks, greetings,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New GPS POI Exporter Plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTq2TkcS+2VYerM5Z80zO3XmfqjWa-NEdQ3b=LZyM9v=Mg@mail.gmail.com>

A few week ago I went of vacation to visit some archeological sites. I keep
a database of these sites that I wanted to format so that I could load them
onto my Garmin devices. Neither right mouse clicking on my layer and saving
it as a GPX file nor GPS Tools did what I needed so I wrote a python script
to format my data as POI files so that I could load them onto my GPS
devices the way I wanted them. Afterwords, I decided to make my script into
a plugin.

I am planning on uploading this to the QGIS plugin repository, but before I
do I wanted to solicit any comments for the QGIS community. Here is where
you can the plugin on GitHub.

https://github.com/hamiltoncj/qgis-poiexport-plugin

When you download it rename the folder to poiexport and drop it into your
QGIS plugin folder. It installs itself under Vector->GPS->POI Exporter.

This was designed to work with my Garmin devices, but I am hoping it will
work with others and would like to know if it does. If there are some
changes that can be made, that do not get into proprietary formats, then I
may consider supporting them.

Thank!!!

​Very nice​! I didn't see it mentioned in your slides, but are you aware of
the network analysis library that is part of QGIS core? It implements many
clases that would seem useful, e.g. for shortest path calculations.

​Don't worry, publish it whenever you feel ready. ​

this issue had been the argument of a same discussion with my friend
pCav :-) probably I have not warned about my (partial) knowledge of
the Network Analysis Library and some recent plugins: I hope to fill
the gap :-)

on the matter, my target (now) is little different; I'm not ready for
a complete plugins to analyse digraphs and networks; now, my interest
is in graph learning and my plugin is a tool oriented toward the
elemental properties of the graphs, not the global performances of the
network;

I hope in the near future to get even more complete analysis of graphs
and networks; by then I hope to be ready, having studied better what
is already available in QGIS

Thanks Greg and others who have commented on this thread. I would just mention again that the discussion of hosting platforms is moot without an accompanying offer to  migrate our issue database to the new platform....

FYI: we are currently running:

Redmine 1.0.3.stable (MySQL)

the github project above says >=1.3

while it is ok if you try out something, also note we have like (200000
comments to push to Github...).

IF we succeed with the move to latest Redmine first, you will have a
newer version from which it is maybe(?) easier to migrate anyway.

our experience was that the xml received from Redmine did just not
contain all info we wanted to take over. That is why we first exported
all info to a Sqlite db and tried with that one.

Regards,

Richard

Anybody familiar with gitosis here?

That is wat is running on hub, but I'm not able to make it work again.

As a last resort, we can do a local checkout on the server and zip it
and sent it to the project maintainers.

Hi,

Users report that loading projects with print composers is much slower in
recent versions than in 2.8 and earlier. https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10828

Do you know what has changed to cause these long loading times?

Just two comments:

* I think he was talking about GitLab

* The new GitHub API allows pushing by issue rather than comment. So
that brings it down to ~16000 requests.

Those throtteling api is pretty frustrating to use. It took me hours to
only try to match Redmine users to Github users! Doing 1000 requests...
waiting... etc etc

> Do you have a list of what needs be taken over?

Well, the goal was "do not loose any information", so yes:

- Everything :-)

Meaning: comments, attachments, labels, users (to be matched/checked
first), commits etc etc

FYI: the "Import tickets from Redmine" item in the
GitServiceRequirement OSGeo wiki page [1] had 0 votes.

I guess this is just a sign of people not really planning to invest
time in OSGeo infrastructure, but in case some of you are considering
that path, please make your voice heard !

Hi,

I noticed that from 2.16 version I cannot "dock" the floating palettes,
that is I can not get back inside the QGIS interface edges. Has anyone else
noticed this strange behavior? It just happens to me?


Thank you

Roberto

Qt can be a bit picky at times. Nothing has changed between 2.14 and 2.16
to effect that.

It does seem like a difficult task, but with GitLab you do not have to use
a throttled REST API to manipulate it, potentially it's possible to write
directly to its PostgreSQL database.

Yep, I'm responsible for the experimental deployment of GitLab that Vincent
mentioned before. I wasn't aware a migration was beeing worked on and that
GitHub is the current target, sorry for jumping in uninformed in this
thread.

I agree that having a free service taking care of infrastructure and
security issues is a nice thing, but I also think that what is free today
might not be free tomorrow and it's good to at least have a plan for that
day. For instance, the throttling REST API that GitHub offers does not only
make migration to GitHub difficult it will also affect an eventual
migration *from* GitHub.

I've only put a small amount of effort to deploy GitLab at this point and
while I'm willing to do more I agree it should involve more than one person
and need a clear motivation from involved parties to defend the effort
required to maintain it properly.

 layer(.dataProvider()).getFeatures(...)
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C578A8CF@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi,

I have a point SHAPE layer with 4 points on a line (just to make them easy to number in this example, and the layer is created in QGIS).


1.       Start editing.

2.       Delete point number 3.

3.       In the python console do the following:

>>> len(list(iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().getFeatures()))
3
>>> len(list(iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().dataProvider().getFeatures()))
4
>>> req = QgsFeatureRequest()
>>> req = req.setLimit(3)
>>> len(list(iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().getFeatures(req)))
2
>>> len(list(iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().dataProvider().getFeatures(req)))
3

If I access the features using the data provider with no request, I get too many features back. If I use a request when getting features directly from the layer, I get too few features back.

I guess the layer directly gives me the best result, but it chokes when the request is limited.

Who can I trust when getting features during an editing session? Or should I approach this in another way?

Regards, Casper

If you haven't saved the layer after you did the delete the provider still
thinks there is 4 features. The layer itself and the edit buffer sit above
the data provider.

Generally you should trust the layer as it knows the state of the edit
buffer.

Hi Nathan

Thanks for clarifying that, I’ll try to put my faith in the layer. My question is then, why does the layer only respond with 2 features when I ask it for max 3 features, since 4 – 1 = 3?

Does it find 3 features, determine that one of them has been deleted and only returns the two living features?`

I guess (no verification done) that in the background the limit is
forwarded to the dataprovider which returns 3 features from which 1 is
filtered out by the layer so only 2 remain.

Please report this as a bug. I'm not sure if an action will be taken,
most of the "fixes" to this which I can think of defeat the purpose of
sending as few requests as possible to the database, but on the other
hand, this situation here can really lead to confusion.

Hi,

Is there anything on the plugin repo wiki page that we still need? I
reviewed it and it seems pretty much outdated:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/PluginRepository

It also mentions "trusted" users, which causes confusion with our current
effort to establish trusted plugin authors. (See comment in
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/203116/what-does-the-trusted-flag-mean-for-qgis-plugins
)

I suggest deleting the wiki page.

Best wishes,
Anita

I'd say something like this could work. In QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator:
- take the feature request limit for mProviderRequest
- if deleted features are present in the edit buffer, add the number
of deleted features to the limit in mProviderRequest
- if changed feature attributes are present, and the request is an
expression based request, add the number of changed features to the
limit
(could be smarter here and check which attributes are required by the
filter + which have changed)
- if geometry changes are present and a filter rect is in place then
add the number of geometry changes to the limit

That would still gain us most of the benefits of feature limits +
handle this case, and the only penalty is present when the bug would
otherwise show itself.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multiple replacements in a string
Message-ID: <81f4e26c87aeab7b240d5865b4bd5cd7@carto.net>

Hi all, Hi Nyall, 

Came across https://twitter.com/northroadgeo/status/770490090724491265
demoing the replacements of multiple values at once through a nice GUI
where you can define a replacement map.  

I wonder if we couldn't have a more powerful replacement function like
this in the QGIS expressions as well, something like: 

replace(string, replacement_map) where replacement_map would be a
dictionary such as defined in the above tweet, e.g. 

replace(streetname,{'Road'->'Rd','Lane'->'Ln','Highway'->'Hwy'}) 

That way we could use it everywhere we want (not just in the labeling
part) and it would be much easier to write than having to nest multiple
replace() statements. 

Would this be achievable for QGIS 3.0? 

Thanks for your feedback, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAKOK4jgaHTYhZo_HnTVmPtYp5dkxzMaUK1rk8DPQ4UYVfqs_Pw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on [1] and I'm adding a widget for editing a key/value field. I
want it to look like that in the form view (yes I still have some details
to iron out):
[image: Inline image 1]

But, for the table view, this widget is too big to fit in a table cell. So
want I envision is too show the keys/values in a simple textual form and
when the user clicks on the cell to edit it, to pop up a window with the
widget as shown in the form view.

What do you guys think?

I've looked at the code and found nothing with a similar behavior for
editor widgets. Did I miss something or do I have to refactor a bit the
code to add the possibility to have a different widget for the table view?

Thanks for your help.

After some discussion with Nyall we stumbled again over the
inconvenience that widgets in QGIS mix data (core) and GUI part. This
effects many places in QGIS where you want to address the display value
of a widget instead of the raw value: QGIS Server (e.g. GetFeatureInfo
Requests), Print Composer, Labels, Save to Spreadsheet with human
readable values, and many more. 

So before people are introducing more and more widgets (which is nice) I
would suggest to first improve our widget infrastructure for QGIS 3.0 to
decouple the Core/data part from the GUI part, which would allow code to
access all widget configuration and properties without having to deal
with the GUI part of the widget. Nyall mentioned that the symbology
rendering separates this nicely, but the attribute widgets do not. 

Nyall suggested to do a QEP for that to discuss the implications and how
this can be cleanly designed. 

Matthias - since you are "the widget guy" - do you want to take a lead
on this QEP? Or should I ask Nyall? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

I'm a big +1 on that.  I will add my notes on a QEP if one is opened

(Hopefully I can be a bit more active in the project after a bit of a break)

+1 from me too

As a project we should really take the opportunity of a 3.0 branch to
review this kind of architectural cleanups and focus on a healthy code
base more then on new features for the .0 version, in my opinion.

best off course if core dev's take the lead in this

Richard

Hi,

I've already got some ideas because it affects QField (where I'm about
to drop the whole gui lib) as well.

Implementing this in QGIS instead of QField is much preferred.

>From a technical perspective, I would propose to use a tree-like
structure based on QVariants.
They've got all it takes for this:

QVariantMap can handle tree structures of key value pairs (for XML child
nodes), a key "__attributes__" can be added to save the XML element
attributes into.

This way, the information can be read without knowledge about a
particular widget's implementation details and is available directly
from core. The widgets (or whatever part) can add the semantics on top
in their own library.

So that's the inoffical QEP, I'd say we skip the official part.

Matthias

I'd say something like this could work. In QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator:
- take the feature request limit for mProviderRequest
- if deleted features are present in the edit buffer, add the number of deleted features to the limit in mProviderRequest
- if changed feature attributes are present, and the request is an expression based request, add the number of changed features to the limit (could be smarter here and check which attributes are required by the filter + which have changed)
- if geometry changes are present and a filter rect is in place then add the number of geometry changes to the limit

That would still gain us most of the benefits of feature limits + handle this case, and the only penalty is present when the bug would otherwise show itself.

Hi, 

Is it possible to add my own buttons to the toolbar of the attribute
table window? 

If yes - do you have some sample code how to do this? 

My goal is to trigger some Python code that would process the currently
selected features of the attribute table. 

Thanks,

Hi Andreas,

I think you can create Python-based actions and use the new option "show
them in the attribute table"

Just to clarify - are you proposing that only a map of widget
configuration is moved to core? I'd say the representValue function
for each widget should also should be moved across, otherwise we'll
end up with multiple code paths reimplementing the logic from each
widget + plugins having to redo this themselves.

Fine by me - a QEP would have just been a way to get yourself and
Denis to approve a design for this :)

Ah indeed :)
I see. I don't know very well this part of the code, but I don't think
there is a direct way to add a button in the attribute table.

You could always use QT introspection to look for the QToolBar and add
your own button ... but it's quite hacky.

Or we could extend a bit the concept of action to allow the action to be
called with a list of features, rather than with only one feature. By
default it would call the action for each selected feature. If needed,
we could add a way for the user to add its own "multiple feature"
version of the action.

Good point,

that will also be nice to have in core.

In this case we'll end up with two registries and two factories
(although only a few widgets will need core functionality).
Or did you have a different idea in mind?

Hi,

On win64 latest Master version gives me error:
Error reading repository: QGIS Virallinen Liitännäisten Etäkirjasto

Server response is 200 OK, but doesn't contain plugin metatada. This is
most likely caused by a proxy or a wrong repository URL. You can
configure proxy settings in QGIS options.

Annoying ....
Boundless repo OK so probably not program error.

Cheers,
Kari

That would force the plugin writters to provide two plugins: one for core
that could be used for qgis server as well and one for gui. Then how do we
make sure the user install the two plugins at the same version? I guess the
GUI plugin will depend on the core one...

I do agree that representValue would be useful in core, but that has some
cost to split the thing in two. Or maybe reprensent value is something
totally different from the widgets for editing the fields and they don't
have to be in 1-1 relation.

Not really, you can add two register calls in one plugin.

As long as there is no representValue() method (most of the widgets
actually) I don't think the core part is required and just some generic
default module can handle this.

​I'll move on and delete it. Bellow, you find the content for future
reference:​​

​---------------------------------------------------------------​

​This is the entry point for those interested in working on the plugin
repository. The plugin repository is a django application. The source code
for the application is hosted on github:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django

If you would like write access to the above repository, please contact Tim
Sutton (tim at linfiniti.com).

Note the repository was changed from a personal repository to a community
one - please note the new url above.


h2. The pieces

* http://plugins.qgis.org - the upload and download app
* http://hub.qgis.org the bugtracker for the plugins
* http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues the bugtracker for the
webapp


h2. Version 1.0

This section lists wanted features for the first version of the plugin
repository. Once everything is on its place, we can probably switch from
the original repository now hosted at pyqgis.org and require all the plugin
developers to upload the plugins to the new repository. From that time, no
more public 3rd party repositories will be encouraged - everyone should be
happy to use the official repository :-)

For easy usage of the repository, a command line tool (supposedly a python
module) should be provided with qgis that will upload new plugin version,
given just the package file, changelog and username/password. Later we
could even create a plugin for convenience with simple GUI for instant
publishing.

List of views and actions in the plugin repository application:
* views for registered users:
** list my plugins
** plugin details with editing (remove incorrect upload, delete plugin, add
owner etc.)
* actions for registered users:
** add plugin / edit plugin
** upload new plugin version
* views for all users:
** list plugins (main page)
*** show either featured (default) or all plugins
*** show plugins of a particular user
*** sorting: recently added/updated, most downloaded
** show plugin details
** repository xml compatible with original repository

Notes:
* user authentication - osgeo LDAP should be used (no more new logins
please!), using HTTPS so that the passwords are not visible (see
http://packages.python.org/django-auth-ldap/)
* there is always one or more owners for a plugin, any owner of a plugin
can add new people as co-owners. Only owners are allowed to upload new
versions, edit or completely remove a plugin. If the owner of a plugin
disappears, a new owner could be assigned for the plugin by the admins
* download counts
** downloading of plugin packages should be redirected in order to
calculate download count directly (without accessing web server stats)
* featured plugins
** admins might want to mark interesting (and well behaving) general
purpose plugins as featured to make them more visible from the less
interesting ones
* trusted users
** a simple protection from malicious users: everyone is at the beginning
marked as untrusted, the uploaded plugins are not visible until an admin
doesn't review the code and mark the user as trusted. Plugins uploaded by
trusted users are immediately visible - this still leaves some space for
malicious users (first upload something good, get trusted, then upload
something bad), however we don't have resources to check all the updated
plugins. Malicious users - once detected - get blocked forever.
* plugin uploading: user should only select a file for upload and provide a
changelog - the rest should be handled on the server
* plugin versioning: for each plugin, the entire release history will be
kept. By default users will see only the last version. For plugins that
make distinction between development (experimental?) and stable versions,
there should be an option when uploading the plugin whether that is a
development version. The owner should be able to mark also manually which
version is the last stable and last development (experimental) version.
* upload checks
** check that the uploaded file has an acceptable size (e.g. < 1MB)
** check that the uploaded file is valid zip archive
** check that the plugin exists, user is owner of the plugin, this version
does not exist yet, ...
** parse plugin metadata and update the plugin details from it: nowadays
the plugins store metadata in __init__.py file, but it has been suggested
to migrate them to a separate text file (so that both repository and plugin
manager in qgis will have easier work). Of course a compatibility python
method should be kept in __init__.py file that would create the metadata
info from the text file. Syntax of the metadata file should be
user-readable and editable (i.e. no XML!), probably the best choice will be
the format used in "ConfigParser":
http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html Python module.

Preliminary suggested table structure (incomplete):
* users: owner_id, name, mail, trusted  (connected to "LDAP":
http://packages.python.org/django-auth-ldap/?)
* plugins: plugin_id, name, description, last_version, last_update_time,
create_time
* plugin_versions: plugin_id, version, upload_time
* plugin_owners: plugin_id, owner_id


h2. Version 2.0

* categories/tagging of plugins - "django-tagging":
http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/ or "django-taggit":
http://github.com/alex/django-taggit/
* user rating (no registration) - "django-simple-ratings":
http://github.com/coleifer/django-simple-ratings ?
* download charts (?)
* searching - "django-haystack":
http://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/ ?
* "ponies!":http://djangopony.com/
* for each plugin, a link to its original repo (default to a standard repo)
* for each plugin, a link to its bugtracker (for now, http://hub.qgis.org)​

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis resource sharing VS processing for script
	sharing
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7ChRxncYvwY28YaeopHDon6_u6AsYs6zN3SiYZv=yB5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS folks,

Since the release of the great plugin "Qgis resource sharing" (1) (2) & (3)
we can share many resources, and processing scripts are among them.

We have also another Processing dedicated github repo for sharing Python
scripts, R scripts and models (4)

Regarding this current situation, what should we tell users and developpers
who want to share Processing scripts ? What shoud they use to share their
scripts ?

Once the new plugin will be able to let users share R scripts and
processing models, could we get rid of the historical Processing sharing
tool ?

Thanks in advance for your ideas about this topic.

Cheers
Michaël

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Inconsistent usage of field aliases
Message-ID: <CAHCHdbJq4k3uvzJfxTuooJX8iY3LVArJt=LNd2boX6cT6b2u3w@mail.gmail.com>

I recently worked with a map where another user had defined aliases on a
couple of fields. While trying to build expressions in the field calculator
and other contexts I became confused because the alias names that I saw in
the attribute table were not available in the expression builder. After
some searching (and panic over the thought that the shapefile was
corrupted) I realized that the expression builder refers to fields by their
actual name without any reference to the alias. Since I wasn't aware that
aliases had been set it didn't occur to me to check there.

It is highly confusing to use column aliases in some contexts and actual
names in other contexts. To improve user experience this should be unified.
There was a mailing list conversation in 2014
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-September/034551.html>
about this issue but as far as I can tell nothing was done about it.

There seem to be good arguments for using actual names and for using
aliases so I think the best solution will need to accommodate both usage
patterns. What is clear is that using aliases in some contexts and not in
others is not an intuitive design.

Has this been discussed more recently than my 2014 reference? If not, the
API changes to 3.0 might be a good opportunity to tackle this usability
issue.

Regards,
Spencer Gardner

Hi Michaël,

To be honest, when I implemented it to support sharing python processing
scripts (https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing/issues/11),
I didn't really think much about this concern that you raise. The one in
processing toolbox is very nice and focused only on the processing scripts.
The only thing missing from the one in the toolbox is to search the script
itself (?) If the number of the scripts is getting bigger, users would
probably find it hard to search for scripts they are looking for. The idea
itself is from Ale and Victor, so perhaps they can share their vision?

Cheers

Hi Kari,

is it still a problem? Because for master the url that is used is:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.17
(for master_2)
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.99
(for real master)
which now work both

(could be a timeout? Because if I'm correct the master ones are not cached)

Regards,

Richard

Mmm, I think a QEP is not only to discuss but also to give some
background/context. To be honest I understand  'decoupling' between
model/view gui/core, but you lost me when you talked " to use a
tree-like structure based on QVariants".

Would it not be a good idea (also for future reference) to write a short
QEP, with
- the problem we have
- some context + link to your backgroud info
- maybe some more layman description of the used solution?
- some examples (Python/cpp?)

I really like the way Python uses it PEP-documents: you get an idea WHY
in history something is done.

I'm even happy to try to write it, IF I could follow the discussion :-(

Richard Duivenvoorde

This is what I was thinking - I can't think of a nice way around this.

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C578ADFE@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hello,

I am trying to follow Tim's blog post[1] on how to build QGIS using QtCreator on linux. The blog post is a couple of years old now and I have found a couple of replaced/extra packages I needed to install to get to the error below. I am at the step where I am using the CMake Wizard to run CMake and create the "cbp" file. It seems like it cannot find the QCA library:

CMake Error at cmake/FindQCA.cmake:64 (message):
  Could not find QCA
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:322 (FIND_PACKAGE)

If I haven't already got the QCA dependency, which library should I install?


Regards, Casper
