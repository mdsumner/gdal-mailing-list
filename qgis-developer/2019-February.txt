Hi Nyall,

Thank you for your time! I really appreciate it and will definitely implement those suggestions as well.

I am using QGIS 3.4 however the bug seems to be resolved with the your suggestions and if I save the script to the processing toolbox rather than run it from the editor. 

Kind regards,
Bjorn

This was a bug fixed already - are you on QGIS 3.4?

Anyone, the problem stems from this line:

    templines = st.run('native:splitwithlines',parameters)

This should be:

    templines =
st.run('native:splitwithlines',parameters,context=context,
feedback=feedback)

I.e. you need to pass the child algorithm the context and feedback
objects given to your algorithm, to allow that child algorithm to push
feedback messages and access existing map layers.


Two other suggestions:

            except Exception as e:

feedback.pushInfo(QCoreApplication.translate('Sample_Area','%s'%(e)))

Here this would be better as:

            except Exception as e:

feedback.reportError(QCoreApplication.translate('Sample_Area','%s'%(e)))

(reportError instead of pushInfo)

And

for part in geom: #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry

This should be

for part in geom.asGeometryCollection(): #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry

(or, nicer for 3.4):

for part in geom.parts(): #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry


Hope that helps!
Nyall

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Find unmaintained plugins
Message-ID: <CAD3koGnyD8qYKkJrGcCv8GJUadxBrmtGa5Gay8oeRwwJ60XX7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello qgis-devs,

I made the experience that there are QGIS-plugins which are not maintained
anymore.
Example:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing-plugin-deprecated-td5366686.html

Recently I asked some maintainers if they have plans to update their
plugins to be QGIS3-ready because I was willing to update them if the
maintainer wouldn't do it... but again I got the impression that some
plugins are not maintained anymore.
Example:
https://github.com/NathanW2/selection-sets/issues/5

Now that there is the change from QGIS2 to QGIS3 some unmaintained plugins
will just dissapear like through a "natural selection". But in one or two
years there could again be lots of unmaintained plugins which could have
bugs that slow down qgis or make them unstable like it happened with the
Rectangles-Ovals-Digitizing-plugin (
https://github.com/vinayan/RectOvalDigitPlugin/issues/6 ).

Wouldn't it make sense to check once a year if all plugins are still
maintained?

You could for example use something like LimeSurvey (
https://www.limesurvey.org/community ) and ask every maintainer to respond
if they still feel responsible for the plugin. In the backend of Limesurvey
you have a database with the responses so it should be quite easy to
automatically synchronize the results with your repository-items.
This way the unmaintained plugins could be marked as deprecated if no
response is sent back.

Just my two cents...

regards,
Thomas

Hello everyone,
QGIS currently has a spatialite support of 4.3 where some very important
modules like virtualKNN [0] are missing. There are post here [1] and here
[2].
This message as feature request, to enable SpatiaLite >= 4.5, I think this
enable very important features.

Not sure what the latest released version is.  From the home[0] and download
page it looks like it's 4.3.0a - for the others there are only RCs or betas.

thanks a lot for your suggestion. I agree that the move to QGIS 3
automatically purges old unmaintained code, but this does not solve
entirely the issue.
In short do you suggest we should run a survey once a year, sending it
to the list of plugin maintainers, and marking as deprecated all plugins
for which we do not receive a positive response?
I would be a bit skeptical, as many plugins are still useful even if not
actively maintained. An alternative would be to add to our Django app an
automatic reminder to be sent to maintainer, asking to confirm they
maintenance; in absence of a feedback, we could mark it as unmaintained,
and make this visible to users, so they have the options of adopting it,
supporting it, or stopping using it before it actually stops working.
How does it sound? in case you agree on this or a modified version of
it, would you be available to help implementing this?
All the best.

Hi Devs,

Seeing this tweet:

pointing to

https://erouault.blogspot.com/2019/01/srs-barn-raising-8th-report-ready-for.html

With the help of Even I've been able to compile proj+gdal master (to
become proj6). If you want to compile and use it next to the proj/gdal
from your distro (Debian testing here) you maybe need some extra tips,
which Even jotted down here:

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingOnUnixGDAL25dev

So now "we" can start to make this work with QGIS.... :-)

Hi Paolo,

sounds like a good idea to send a reminder once a year to the maintainer
and mark plugins as unmaintained if no feedback is received.

I am available to help implementing it.

Thomas

I would only send a reminder to the maintainer if there has not been a
recent update and for some plugins they may not need to be updated for
several years - with the exception of a major release i.e. 2 to 3.

Calvin

Hi Calvin,
I have opened issues on GitHub for several plugins or sent pullrequest with
no reaction at all what's pretty frustrating.
I don't think that it's a good idea to wait several years until it's clear
that a plugin is not maintained anymore.
Answering one email per year (and plugin) doesn't seem to be too much
effort to me.

Regards,
Thomas

Thanks for your offer of help. I agree that the mail should be sent only
for plugins not updated in the last (3? 6? 9?) months.
Could you please start filling up a ticket on
https://issues.qgis.org/issues
so we can define specs resulting from this thread and start implementing it?
Cheers.

A Jupyter Console QGIS Plugin would probably be a good "Google Summer
of Code 2019 Idea"?

Hi Richard,

I can build QGIS with the latest proj and gdal if I add this to cmake: -D
ACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H=1

Thanks

Hi all,

Marking a plugin as "unmaintained" or "deprecated" is a heavy action which may discourage developers and make even useful plugins disappear.

Thus if this is done in any way, I am in favor of sending several reminders to a plugin author over a time period of at least 6 months before taking any action. It then needs to be super easy for a plugin maintainer to remove this status from their plugins.

Maybe alternative approaches could also be considered to move maintained plugins to the top and make stars / votings more relevant. Or have the possibility to flag a plugin as unmaintained (like stackoverflows "needs moderator attention") where it's required to post a link to an issue which has not received an answer in a long time.

There are various variables which need to be balanced in this discussion like losing useful plugins, adding maintenance burden (to plugin developers and plugin maintainers), having a credible plugin ecosystem. Let's make sure we keep all of them in mind.

Thank you
Matthias

There were already a past GSoC focused on something similar... But oriented
to use qgis as back end for mapping only.

IMHO a GSoC should be on remove (if possible) at console ernel sharing
limitation when embedded.. Not specifically a qgis oriented stuff.
I hadn't time to investigate, but 1.5y ago I challenged various talented
devs and none found a solution... But having a well focused GSoC probably
could help :)

Hi All,

there should be some mechanism to overtake a plugin.
For example the qgsaffine plugin [1], the last commit was in 2015 on 
github and there is a pull request [2] (more than one month old) which 
upgrades plugin to qgis 3.4.
Deadlock...

This is a temporary workaround to raise attention on the fact that proj_api.h 
will be removed completely in PROJ 7 in one year. See
https://proj4.org/development/index.html
At some point QGIS should migrate to use proj.h which was added in PROJ 5.

sounds like a good candidate for a QGIS grant. Even, would you be
interested in submitting a proposal?
Thanks.

So ;-) , do we have a good idea for GSoC 2019 - and a mentor (you)?
My contribution could be use and test cases...

deprecated yes, unmaintained not necessarily. We could just let the user
know, perhaps suggesting a way to solve this, without removing them for
the list of available plugins (just like the Featured tag).

agreed. maybe 3 months would be enough.

Or have the possibility to flag a plugin as unmaintained (like stackoverflows "needs moderator attention") where it's required to post a link to an issue which has not received an answer in a long time.

unfortunately it seems that our users are not very interested in rating
the plugins.

sure, thanks for your thoughts. the sheer number of plugins makes the
issue very delicate; we cannot think of managing 1k plugiins by hand, we
need more automatic approaches.

all the best.

the plugin manager can change the author email and name. of course it
would be good to have the original author's assent, but I realize that
this is not always possible.
Perhaps this should only be made more clear and visible to power users.
What do you suggest?

Hi Paolo,
if I understand well, your reply implicitely highlights several topics.

Plugins are plug-ins, they are supposed to serve as an integration of
specialised functions that are too specific to become part of the main
program. This in theory; sometimes they are a temporary solution for a more
general audience, sometimes they propose an alternative solution for
something that is already in QGIS.
I think this should be clear to users, what category the plugin belongs to,
and one of the most important enhancements to the present situation is
adding this information to the list. Then it should be clear since what
version the functionality provided by a plugin has been added to the QGIS,
so the plugin should not be installed unless the user is so fond of the
provided workaround to prefer the plugin to the solution adopted by QGIS
(it happens!).

The second item is about categorisation of plugins. They are many more than
anyone would expect when the plugins were introduced. Alphabetical order is
not anymore a solution when you have several hundred plugins (there should
be a psycological rule written about this somewhere, please fill in if you
know ;.)), we should find out categories and attribute plugins to these
categories. When a developer wants to do something about any issue which is
already tackled by one of more plugins (it's frequent, I see), he should
also provide information about what plugins become obsolete. It's not a
good idea to "vote for obsolescence".

The third item is about automation. Github has some experience about how to
evaluate source code, I think we should bring the data that Zoltan shows
for the plugin he evaluated in the list, adding how many bugs were found,
closed or stay open since when, suggesting that some plugins should be
subject to further investigation. This is the area for human intervention.
Some warning can be automated, but it would be better to provide a
responsible feedback. Some developer feel more responsible for certain
subject, I think that categorising plugins helps developers to keep an eye
on plugins that are relevant for everyone's area of experience.

Over all, I think that the work you do about administrative and technical
approval (thank you very much for your attention and even for your
occasional failures) could be balanced by Anita Graser who has frequently
focused on some interesting plugins. This is another important issue about
documentation. There should be a comprehensive description of what plugins
do. Having a simple list, even a categorised list, is not enough. Some
plugins – DbManager comes immediately to my mind – are even more important
for me and for others than many features of the main program.

Sorry for being so verbose, but all the work done on plugins so far
deserves great attention.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New (small) feature Point Displacement Label
	distance (factor)
Message-ID: <CANZ8k-3_c+31-in9D5Ai5d5jxuiuweD4wFcN6sBYrzkF0zAiag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I've used the great Point Displacement symbology, but found the hard coded
label distance to be too limiting. So I've adjusted the Point Displacement
tool by adding a spinbox to allow the user to adjust the distance. I've
attached a screenshot of the feature at the bottom of the mail.

The issue have been reported before, and one suggested solution is to
replace the current labeling with qgis standard labeling dialog, something
these adjustments do not do. (https://issues.qgis.org/issues/5945)

If no one suggests otherwise, I'm planning to make a pull request for this
adjustment soon.

Also, I could not find out who the current "technical advisor" is whom I
should contact about this. Is there someone I should contact before I make
the pull request?

As I'm a new developer (both c++ and the QGIS code was new to me) i've
followed the great guides:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md
and
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/INSTALL

There is no change to the current master unit test run after my adjustments
and the feature works as I expect it too.

Then I misunderstood the goal of this proposal, sorry.

I was imagining myself looking through a plugin list of a software of
which I am an ordinary user and seeing a plugin tagged as
"unmaintained". This would make me think it's unreliable, outdated and
unstable and hence not recommended.

What signal do you think this label should send to a user?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Linking layout and symbol legend
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWA1q8s4A7aucO6bB7OQM+oPjWgMBgbr9saWAoUshpXNCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have asked Mr. Dawson about this but I am aware that he is quite busy
with bugfixing and probably everyone reading this message.

As some of you might be aware I am trying to implement a way to evaluate an
expression in the legend.

Currently this part seems to be functional but I am currently stuck and I
can't seem to find an easy way so I'm wondering if this is a design thing
or I'm overlooking something.

What I aim to do is to get the legenditemlayout context and the
symbolLegendNode context in a common place to evaluate both of them.

In the element of the layertree folder there are a couple of place that can
implement the featurecount method, but it seems that those are separate.
And I find it strange that the symbolLegendNode is not linked to the legend
as it has its own separate tree when not using autoupdate.

What would be the best way to have both expression context?? Currently the
evaluation is done in the symbollegendnode but I could move it to the
legendModel, or just retrieve the generated string.

Cordially,

Alex RL

I think this actually IS the intention here.

But, as you've pointed out, no activity =/= unmaintained, as sometimes
no activity just means bug free and feature complete. In this case I
think it's fine to require developers to respond to a quick "is this
still maintained" survey in order to avoid the flag.

Great! Sounds like a handy addition to this feature.

That information is quite outdated, and really pre-dates the modern
QGIS development process. There are some areas of code which some devs
know better than others, but that's sorted out AFTER creation of the
pull request. (A PR fixing up the developer docs to remove this
outdated info would be nice to see!)

So the next step is to open the PR and make your changes public, and
let the code review team take it from there...

Thinking out-loud, but it would be nice if we had some way to abstract
consoles and have some common interface for them.

Beside the current python console and some 3rd party plugins like the
IPython console, I would very much like to see an embedded "terminal"
console and interactive R console...

Super bonus points if I can access these via a Quake style ~ shortcut ;)

The good news is that North Road received funding for this (and other
related improvements) last week, thanks to the Australian ICSM and the
team behind the GDA2020 projection.

More on this later this week.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsiAHVsF+oWBEG03qHmOheapsvzg==G4F7TkRMiAjGQGWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

This is a quick announcement of North Road's latest funding drive,
which is targeted at development of an automated ESRI ArcGIS "LYR" and
"MXD" to QGIS conversion tool.

Yes, you read that correctly... a completely automated tool to allow
opening ESRI LYR files (including original symbology!) and MXD
documents within QGIS! We're aiming for a deep integration here, so
that end users will be able to interact with these file types via drag
and drop, browser integration, etc.

You can read the full campaign details and see some mockups here:
https://north-road.com/2019/02/04/announcing-our-slyr-funding-drive/

If you're aware of any organisations out there who have been
investigating a move to open source GIS, but are held back by the need
to access existing ArcGIS LYR/MXD documents, please make them aware of
this tool and the campaign.

Regards,
Nyall
North Road

I would thing it carefully, mainly to avoid to involve someone to works on
something that we are not sure it could work! and I can investigate only
after the UserConf (hopefully)

If there is a implementation possibility? I would be happy to mentor.

Hi, 

If you plan to visit the A Coruña dev meeting and would like to get
travel support, please do not forget to fill in the form at
https://goo.gl/forms/YKm5fo7ll5GfQEJI3 

Reimbursement of travel cost will be done during or shortly after the
meeting. 

In order to make life easier for me, it would be great if you would send
me ONE SINGLE PDF with the following information: 

1. Your name and address 

2. Your IBAN number and SWIFT code 

3. A list of items you want to get reimbursed and their cost 

4. The total cost 

5. All of your invoices/receipts 

PLEASE, PLEASE: do not send me many different jpeg files, but combine
everything into one single PDF file. This can be easily done in
LibreOffice, or using one of the free PDF tools, such as PDFSAM or
similar. There are also online services that allow to combine different
PDF and jpegs into one single PDF. 

Thanks a lot for your collaboration - looking forward to meet you in A
Coruña! 

Greetings, 

Andreas

And sometimes even if the plugin is unmaintained it is still useful to lots of people (even if it has a few known bugs)…..

I’m not sure if flagging plugins as unmaintained is always so nice.. I would favour an approach where we could just list plugins in the plugin manager based on the date of their last release, most recent first so that you can see old versus new

Definitely -1 here on removing plugins that are orphaned unless they are part of a security / data integrity risk. Many people may have built up specific workflows around the existence of a particular plugin or two and there is no need to break this for people even if the plugin is orphaned…

Tim

Hi,

I also dislike the idea of removing plugins completely, as already pointed
oout sometimes a plugin "just works" and there is no real maintenance
needed.
Also - even it is not maintained anymore the code inside can still be
useful to create something new out of it. And without seeing the plugin
everything would have to be invented again.

so -1 from my side for  removing plugins that are orphaned unless they are
part of a security / data integrity risk too.

regards
Werner

Could the GUI invite users to _become_ maintainers ?

Hi,
I can understand concerns about not wanting to discourage maintainers.

But at the same time you have to see that buggy unmaintained plugins can
cause a lot of frustration to users.
I have made the experience that problems caused by such plugins are also
actually very bad for the reputation of qgis.
(Because most of the users (and the deciders in a company) won't
differentiate between qgis "core" and the plugins which are distributed
over the official(!) repository. From their point of view qgis is just
buggy.)

I think it's just fair to inform the user if a plugin is still maintained
or not and to be honest I don't quite understand why it should be too hard
to click on a confirmation-link once a year to prove that you still
maintain a plugin.

If the maintainer does not want to respond or does not find the time to
click the link than I guess it just reflects the fact that the plugin isn't
maintained by this person anymore.


For qgis 2.18 there were more than 800 plugins in the official repository
and I guess that in some years there could be even more plugins available
for qgis 3.

I think it will be hard to keep qgis3 stable and performant if buggy
unmaintained plugins won't be sorted out or at least marked as unmaintained.

Regards,
Thomas

wording should be careful here, not to confuse users. Something like
"Can you write Python code? Please consider adopting this plugin" with a
pointer to instructions etc.
Thanks for the suggestion. Better start noting it down somewhere (a
QEP?), not to miss the many ideas tha are coming.
Cheers.

I don't think anybody wants to *remove* a plugin, just eventually tag it
to make it clear its situation to the user, or at worst deprecate it.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Tackling Postgis layers connection recover
Message-ID: <1817584.kHGuZzuVTU@darth-vader>

Hello qgis-devs,

This is my first message here and first contribution to QGIS, so I thank you in advance for being indulgent and do not hesitate to correct me on any mistake I will make.
I didn't want to jump right into proposing my patch "as is" in a PR as I'm new to this project, so first I wanted to discuss about it to make sure I got it right.

Here's a recap of what I have found so far (sorry if it's a bit long):

I'm using QGIS 3.4 with a PostgreSQL database to store layers and I'm facing the same issue as described in https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20170 : unrecoverable PostgreSQL connections.

I have cloned the repo and started to dig, as it is really annoying because it forces you to abandon your changes and close and reopen your project.

To reproduce the problem, the simplest way is to spin a local PostgreSQL database with postgis and create a table with just a serial and a geometry:
 CREATE TABLE foo (id serial primary key, geometry GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)); 

Open it in QGIS, create several features, save them then simply restart the PostgreSQL service so that all connections are forced to be closed.
QGIS logs will display that the connections to PostgreSQL were lost but recovered and features will still be accessible.

However if I start editing the layer by adding a feature and then call save, it will fail:

2019-02-04T19:11:30     CRITICAL    Layer foo : PostGIS error while adding features: FATAL: terminating connection due to administrator command
             la connexion au serveur a été coupée de façon inattendue
              Le serveur s'est peut-être arrêté anormalement avant ou durant le
              traitement de la requête.
        
2019-02-04T19:11:30     WARNING    Commit errors : Could not commit changes to layer foo
2019-02-04T19:11:34     CRITICAL    Layer foo : PostGIS error while adding features: no result buffer
2019-02-04T19:11:34     WARNING    Commit errors : Could not commit changes to layer foo

My only option is to cancel my edits and reload the project to regain full access to the db.

So in fact this problem has 2 causes: (time to dig in the C++ code) 

First:

The QgsPostgresProvider::connectionRO() method does not offer a proper way to reset the connection when the connection was lost; therefore every SELECT after a connection was lost will  cause the Q_ASSERT to fail in  src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresconn.cpp, line 86 and will promptly crash my debug build of QGIS.

Let's take for example QgsPostgresProvider::featureCount(): it checks connectionRO in case it is null, but doesn't check if the connection is still valid and will call connectionRO()->PQexec( sql ) in any case. Now PQexec is indeed checking the connection status, but will not try to reset the connection and will simply return a nullptr, which is then passed to QgsPostgresResult::PQgetvalue and will cause the assert to fail. 

Note that PQexecNR is properly handling checks on the status and will call PQreset, resulting in a successful re-connection and request to Postgresql ( that's why other connections are not affected and can recover) but PQexecNR is never called on ConnectionRO, so the connection remains staled.

I see 2 paths to fix this issue:

- Implement a check in  QgsPostgresProvider::connectionRO()  that will call a new QgsPostgresConn::PQreset method  which in turn call libpq PQreset on its mConn attribute, resulting in a proper connection reset. As ConnectionRO is const, we can't simply create a new connection so we can only reset the existing one. 

- Implement the same logic as in PQexecNR to handle reset in case of staled connection, ie add a retry flag and a call to libpq PQreset.

I quickly tried the first approach and it fixed the issue; however this does not provide an automatic retry mechanism on the first failure, so maybe the second one is better.


Now the second cause:

I couldn't understand why QGIS was emitting a SELECT statement before an INSERT, and the answer is simple:

2019-02-04T19:11:34     WARNING    Connection error: SELECT nextval('foo_id_seq'::regclass) returned 1 [FATAL: terminating connection due to administrator command

Right before the INSERT query ( which would otherwise work), QGIS makes a SELECT to get the default value for the primary key field.

The culprit here is a bad condition in the optimization in  QgsPostgresProvider::addFeatures when it checks for a PK field which is using a sequence: it only checks if the value is not null, but as a primary key in not null by definition, QGIS automatically sets the not null constraint and default to the SQL default of nextval('foo_id_seq'::regclass). So in fact the optimization is never used and a SELECT is issued. Adding a check to ensure value does not start with next_val  fixes the issue and the optimization is used.


I am willing to propose a PR if my fixes make sense and are acceptable, this will fix an annoying issue.

Thanks in advance for your feedbacks,

I also see a need to inform users about buggy or not-working plugins.
Obviously the votes are not having this effect (since they only increase?).

But "maintained" does not mean "bug-free"  - as you all know e.g. from
commercial SW ;-).
And open source SW dev and maintenance in ones leisure time does not get
better when you get an flaq "unmaintained" on your plugin.

I'm thinking along the line to allow comments in the repo
http://plugins.qgis.org (always with mandatory info about version of
plugin, OS, etc.).
And in almost any  case, we need more maintainer (sic!) efforts to maintain
the plugin repo.

Hi Shane,

Yes - absolutely.

Have a look at 
https://north-road.com/2019/02/04/announcing-our-slyr-funding-drive/

This initiative was announced by Nyall today, but there is already 
existing work that his current proposal builds on. So Nyall already has 
collected a lot of knowledge around the reverse engineering of the 
undocumented ArcGIS .lyr and .mxd formats.

You can discuss details with Nyall and you are welcome to join the effort.

Greetings,

Andreas

Upfront, thanks for the great attitude. This is one of the MOST
effective ways to get bugs fixed... rolling up your sleeves and fixing
them yourself!

They both sound reasonable to me, and yes, valuables fixes for an
annoying issues! Looking forward to the PRs! (One request: please file
these as two separate PRs, so both fixes can be discussed and reviewed
independently.)

Hello,
the page of this plugin:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/RepairLinesConncetions/
heads to the repository for another plugin developed by Carlos Eduardo
Cagna.
The right link should be:
https://github.com/CarlosCagna/RepairLinesConncetions
It would be event better to fix the spelling of Connections on Github
before changing the page of the plugins, but...
Thanks in advance. Sobretudo for the plugin which is a true blessing when
working on hiking trails ;.).

Yes, I agree this might be useful (even though the lack of votes means

Thanks.

Hi list,

For the last couple of days I've been hitting an issue with redmine

after refreshing the submission it works OK the second time.

Is anyone else seeing this?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Windows only version of a QGIS 2.18x plugin
Message-ID: <ab583dfd6cf640b6b8efb7f50fd1b53e@exch4-cdc.nexus.csiro.au>

Hi QGIS dev list,

I have just uploaded a new QGIS 2.18.x plugin called PAT - Precision Agriculture Tools.  It relies on VESPER,  a Windows only bit of software so therefore I went ahead writing a Windows only plugin using QGIS 2.18.x and  the non-QGIS Python dependencies of rasterio, Fiona, geopandas and our pyprecag package.

The majority of our users are Windows users and are the likes of Farmers and Ag consultants with no programming experience and very little QGIS experience which also led to the decision of making PAT a Windows only plugin. I have developed a series of dependency checks based on the Windows environment and create a Windows batchfile that the user can launch to install the Python dependencies correctly for use with QGIS.

On uploading to the QGIS repository I have been advised by @pcav (see https://github.com/CSIRO-Precision-Agriculture/PAT_QGIS_Plugin/issues/7 ) that PAT must support Linux and OSX operating environments. I have had a look on https://plugins.qgis.org/ and I cannot find where this is listed in bullet points under how to add your plugin to this repository as a requirement for the approval of plugins. @pcav advised that I email this list regarding this issue.

Is it acceptable to add a line in the metadata.txt file clearly pointing out that this plugin is to be used in Windows only and will it still be approved for the QGIS plugin repository?

If not what are my options?
Are there any guides on how to best setup and test QGIS plugins for Linux and OSX environments? I only have access to Windows at the moment and I am a novice at Python programming in these other environments.

Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Christina Ratcliff

Don't we have other tools in the repo which are dependant on
platform-specific binaries? E.g.  "Cuda Raster" is linux only.

Hey,

Hmm, I'm not sure we should reject something if it only works on Windows
because of a 3rd party tool.  Given the limited user base, limited in the
sense that it's not a general tool for all users of QGIS and not targeted
as one, I think it would be fine if it was just listed in the comments that
this currently only works on Windows due to X reasons.   In the ideal world
it would be great if everything was cross platform but it's not life so
this is a +1 from me because it opens QGIS to more users who really will
never worry about linux or OS X.

If it was a core bit of QGIS function that would be a different question as
we try and make sure it runs the same on all platforms but personally I see
no reason we can't allow a 3rd party plugin.with those limits.

Also speaking personally as a core dev and plugin author I do all my work
on Windows and if something doesn't run on Linux or OS X others will have
to get me a fix because I can't work on those environments.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Cristina,

Personally I would be OK with it, though I hope that with most other
plugins people try to run the extra mile and make a plugin work on all
platforms (or ask for help) if possible, so we will not end up with more
'linux/windows/mac only'-plugins.

Another option for you would be to just create your own repo at the same
server where people download VESPER from. While you are busy doing the
bat files, you can even install the plugin for the user maybe?
It would mean an extra step to the user to add an extra repo url though.
Or you forget about the whole repo, can do the plugin installation (is
unzipping in the right directory) in your Setup.exe of Vesper?

If you prefer to put it in QGIS repo: just add a big note in the
metadata.txt description that this plugin is only usable with vesper and
windows. And maybe do an OS check in the __init__ for illiterate users ;-)

Also: as 2.18 (and python2) is not to be maintained anymore in near
future... why not port to 3 now you are busy with it.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I respectfully disagree with that: at the very core of the QGIS project
it stands the idea of letting everybody use the best possible GIS,
without discrimination. This kind of approach would in fact favour
Windows users. I have no issue if someone wants to create their own
repo, as suggested by Richard, but the official one IMHO should remain
platform-independent. I'm now dealing with CUDA, thanks Nyall for
letting me know. Please let me know if you know of other plugins in the
same situation.
I would appreciate avoiding plugin approval until the discussion has
come to a shared conclusion.
Thanks.

Dear Devs.

Kind of a help request here. Usually I would ask in a Discord or some 
other chat program but there doesn't seem to be one?
I am trying to write a plugin to import Open Mining Format data into 
QGIS(and maybe export it??)
Anyway, I went through the process of setting up a new plugin through 
the Plugin Creator Plugin, went through the hassle of doing the 
resources on Windows by doing
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/273552/pyrcc5-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command 

since OS4Geo-shell doesn't recognize the bin and has no access to the 
.exe for some reason.

So the plugin initializes and shows in QGIS.
Now, I copied the OMF library files into my plugin folder so now it 
contains
python\plugins\omf_loader\omf\
However, upon trying to import the library by calling "import omf" or 
"from . import omf" in the "run" Method, I get the error that the 
library can not be found.
This is weird since I had a look at other plugins and they also use 
local imports for helper functions...


Can you provide any help?

Paul

Sorry if I¡m too superficial without knowing deeply the plugin use cases,
this is my 2c:

if VESPER kiging is the reason limitate the plugin to only windows, is
something I do not understand. QGIS/processing with RSpatial, saga and
grass are full of kiging interpolation methods why not use the available
multiplatforms tools?

QGIS is for the users in the end, if this opens a new world of users, and
note this is government funded, I don't think we should avoid allowing
these kinds of things in.  This isn't a core feature of QGIS and more of an
exception than a rule.  I don't see most plugins going this route but the
few that do because of X reasons they have no control over should still be
part of the community I think.

I really don't see the harm here as it's not something that most people
will know or care about in the end.  Getting plugins to work cross-platform
is a lot of work and I don't really like pushing people away because they
can't do it for whatever reason.  If this was going to be a core feature I
would be on your side for it but the plugins are for the users.

I would also note we have some features of QGIS that only work on some
platforms and not others and we are fine with that because it makes it
better for those users, so this is the same here IMO.  Pushing them out to
a self-hosted plugin repo just adds extra overhead and limits user base
and visibility of well-funded work that we should embrace.

Hi Christina,

I'm not sure if I get your questions right, but one of the best things of
Python is that is very portable across different operating systems, if you
want to set up a testing environment for your plugins you could start with
a Linux Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine and install QGIS inside it.

I am tempted to think in the same direction. Most plugins will be
cross-platform anyway because Python and because Qt and because QGIS.

If they are not and it's trivial to solve (e.g. someone is using \ as
path separator instead of os.path.join...) than things can go through an
issue report. If it's more complex it's a question of effort vs.
benefit. If it's a single-purpose use-case specific plugin which is
intended to be run inside a specific organization / scenario, then I
don't see the benefit of investing a lot of effort into something that
will never be used.

IMO we should be open to anyone and in parallel encourage people to
support as many platforms as possible. E.g. adding metadata with
supported platforms might help to be more transparent about supported
platform, filter plugins in the plugin manager and offer specific help
to make plugins cross-platform down the road.

On the subject, is there any possibility to test a plugin at another
platform?

I'm developing my plugin on Windows machine and I have a Linux server,
which I can test the plugin on but when it comes to OSX I have no machine
to test it on. Does anyone have experience/good cookbooks how to set up a
OSX virtual box or something similar to test a plugin in?

Best regards
Axel

I'm not a lawyer but I believe that you are breaking the law if you do not
run Apple software on Apple hardware.

Hi Axel,

There is the possibility to run continuous integration on various
platforms on travis-ci and there are other continuous integration
services as well. But I don't think you have the possibility to manually
click through the user interface there and really need to setup unit /
integration tests.

By "effort", do you mean the work to make it cross-platform? If so, yes, but
in the case you describe, there is also no argument that the plugin should
go in the official repo.

This is a specific, but not uncommon, case, if I understand correctly. The
QGIS plugin is a kind of middleware between QGIS and another tool which is
not cross-platform. At work we have multiple users with another such plugin.

In these cases, I guess it's a judgement call: are there enough potential
users out there who would benefit from the extra visibility of having this
plugin in the QGIS official repo? Or is the plugin so closely tied to the
third-party application that it is more appropriate that that other app
should host it, either on their own compatible plugin repo, or as a zip
(bearing in mind that installing a plugin from a zip is massively easier
than it used to be)?

At the end of the day, all other factors being taken into account, excluding
a plugin because it only works on Windows runs the risk of the project
appearing to be unfriendly towards Windows. As a Windows user myself, I'm
afraid that attitude is sometimes (often?) apparent among QGIS devs, as it
obviously is in the broader open-source dev community.

Cross-platform is a QGIS killer strength. But let's not make it a dogma.

Thanks (and apologies if this went a tad OT)

Tom

Hi,

I don't think that the supported platforms of a plugin should be a
limitation for publishing it in the QGIS repository. If it's useful for a
high number of users, why not?

To me the only important thing to do, is to inform the users of any OS
restriction, so that people don't waste time trying to make the plugin work
in a non supported platform.

I wonder how many of the published plugins have been tested to confirm that
they work both on windows, Linux and Mac.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Axel,

If you really want to test your plugin in macOS, you can sign up to one of
the cloud based services, which offers you remote access to a macOS
desktop. We use https://www.macincloud.com/ for QGIS macOS builds and their
customer service is very good.

Regards
Saber

Hi Paul,

besides the mailinglist there is a irc channel and a gitter channel
(with a bridge to the irc and vv):
https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS

But indeed this should work, something like

from .omf.base import UidModel

maybe?
Are you sure you have the python files unzipped there?

My preference would be to keep the official QGIS plugin repo more open
and allow plugins that do not support all QGIS platforms. Often there
are useful tools that are only available for one platform and plugin
author does not have power to change that. But we should not make life
of users on the supported platform more complicated just because other
platforms cannot be supported.

As it was suggested already, if there would be a larger amount of
plugins that are not multi-platform, we could have a piece of metadata
so that users on other platforms could be warned.

For example, Crayfish plugin for QGIS 2.x did not support macOS - it
was a known limitation and it would be sad if the plugin would be
rejected from the official QGIS plugin repo just because of that.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] NITF Metadata in QGIS
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrHti1ZadHiBtJBKQcz94MPx2OtmsShwt0tzq3GBCffpw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a user that would like to have all the metadata from a NITF image
available in QGIS. It appears that QGIS does not read it even though I can
see it when I run gdalinfo in he OSGeo4W Shell. I haven't investigated this
too much but is image metadata completely ignored in QGIS or is it ignored
just for NITF images? It is going to become increasingly more important
that metadata is properly supported for QGIS to enter more commercial
markets.

Do you have any suggestions on how I should proceed?

Thanks,

Calvin

Is it not possible to create two official repositories ? 
One for "all-platforms", one for "dirty/fishy/phony/dubious/in-progress"

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Accessing GRASS GIS addons from within QGIS
Message-ID: <20190206154326.smdspwye6dymhs5y@imap.dreamhost.com>

Dear QGIS team,
Dear GRASS GIS team,

I kindly ask for some response on how to offer access to a GRASS GIS
add-on through QGIS.

I have asked again about this, months ago.  Yet there are still
technicalities for which I need help to understand.

So, please bear with me and thank you in advance for any support.


I developed a GRASS GIS add-on which has been recently published as
an Open Source tool through the European Commission [0,1].

[0] https://gitlab.com/natcapes/r.estimap.recreation
[1] https://gitlab.com/natcapes/r.estimap.recreation/blob/master/C_2018_8970_F1_COMMISSION_DECISION_EN_V3_P1_1006093.PDF

The tool is in a working state, yet under bug-fixing and refactoring to
make it both easier to use and to maintain.


The official documentation of the QGIS project, leads to two ways to
"access" a GRASS GIS add-on through QGIS:

1. the QGIS GRASS plugin [2]

2. the Processing Toolbox [3] -- this wiki-page is created by me based
on detailed guidelines kindly provided by Médéric Ribreux

[2] https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/addinggrasstools.html
[3] https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/QGIS-Processing-GRASS-Provider


1)  For the QGIS GRASS plugin, there must be a way to update the file
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/b3d2619976a69d7fb67b884492da491dfaba287c/src/plugins/grass/modules/default.qgc
which sets up the list of available GRASS GIS modules under the QGIS
GRASS plugin.  This file seems not to be writable for normal users, after
installation of QGIS, i.e. there is no write access to
non-admin/non-root users.

Under Linux, for example, this file is/might be under
`/usr/share/qgis/grass/modules` and its owner is `root`. And, there
seems no way to edit/update this file from within QGIS at run-time.

While I can customise locally, as root, my own QGIS GRASS plugin, and
add an entry for a/ny GRASS GIS add-on,  I cannot, however, understand
how any user that installs QGIS, GRASS GIS and any desired GRASS GIS
add-on, can access it through QGIS.

Something similar is valid under Windows as well.

Can/should I write my own routine(s) to ensure the appearance of my/any
GRASS GIS add-on in the list of available QGIS GRASS modules?  This is
something suggested in an earlier thread [*].

Is it possible at all to update this file at run-time, for any user,
under any major/well known operating system?


2) For the Processing Toolbox, my understanding is that it requires
significant effort to reflect the logic of a GRASS GIS module using
QGIS' Processing interface to GRASS GIS.  Am I wrong?

If I go for the Processing option, however, is it possible to inegrate a
GRASS GIS add-on under the QGIS' Processing GRASS provider, at run-time?

Essentially, is it possible to write (new) "description" files under
`python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description/` which are likely
placed under directories owned by the root/admin user?


If none of the above can ensure access to a GRASS GIS add-on through
QGIS, one that is to be installed using `g.extension` after having
installed QGIS and GRASS GIS, what would you then recommend?

Do only core GRASS GIS modules work for any of the above mentioned
options?


Thank you,

Nikos Alexandris

I have been following this interesting discussion and thought I would make
a couple of comments. I understand the different views people have. Ideally
it would be nice for all plugins to work on all platforms, but I can see
the benefit from certain plugins accessing external libraries that are not
available on all platforms. I have considered doing this myself in
accessing some of the excellent astronomical packages on Windows, but have
been concerned that I could no post the plugin in the official repo. Yes
you can set up a separate repo, but it makes it very difficult for the
plugin to be found and it would not be worth it to me to put in the effort
to have it not be officially recognized and be discoverable.

I personally think it is important that there be some mechanism for people
to publish plugins that have platform dependencies. Ideally, they would
first try to find alternative solutions before making the decision to link
to platform specific resources, but some very important capabilities will
require this. I wouldn't want to discourage developers by insisting that
all plugins must work on all platforms.

I am not sure that having two separate repositories is the best approach
either. I don't think that a separate repo should be classified as 'dirty',
etc. I would think that this could be addressed by the metadata associated
with the plugin.

I strongly disagree with such discrimination based on the supported
OS. In the most
cases this is because some tools/libraries existis only for one or two
platforms and
plugin author can not change situation and have a choice to develop and publish
plugin for one OS, or do nothing.

There are quite a few plugins in the repo for very specific tasks like
converting local
data formats, plugins with non-English UI, plugins which does not work
on all platforms,
we even have plugins which make it easier/encourage users to violate TOS of some
basemaps providers (and even tagged it as featured)... Rules should be
equal for all.

The problem with metadata is that if you use it, you have no way to easily know if something (a  group of plugins) uses a platform-specific plugin.

For example, in ubuntu, I can choose:

-          Official  (secure)

-          Universe (insecure/half-legal)

-          Partner (copyrighted/patented)

-          and of course custom repos

So if somebody or some tutorial tells me to add the « universe » repo, I know instantly not to do that on a server or in a security-critical situation.

If it instead would tell me to install package x, which then installs 20 other packages, which then each install more packages – how do I even filter that information if I have per-package metadata ?  I wouldn’t even use metadata for that, because something might run on Linux, but not on your specific version, for example ARM processor on Linux Chromebook. You’ll have to subdivide by processor for binaries.  Plugins can depend on other plugins.

It might be even better to have 5 repositories:
All-platforms, Windows-only, Linux-Only, Mac-Only, Rest-of-the-world
So if your plugin works on Windows and Linux, you just upload it to the 2 repositories, and finished.

If somebody then tells me to add a „windows only“ plugin, I know to steer clear of that shit if I use Linux, and vice-versa.
And that without having to lookup metadata.

Betreff: Re: [QGIS-Developer] Windows only version of a QGIS 2.18x plugin

I have been following this interesting discussion and thought I would make a couple of comments. I understand the different views people have. Ideally it would be nice for all plugins to work on all platforms, but I can see the benefit from certain plugins accessing external libraries that are not available on all platforms. I have considered doing this myself in accessing some of the excellent astronomical packages on Windows, but have been concerned that I could no post the plugin in the official repo. Yes you can set up a separate repo, but it makes it very difficult for the plugin to be found and it would not be worth it to me to put in the effort to have it not be officially recognized and be discoverable.

I personally think it is important that there be some mechanism for people to publish plugins that have platform dependencies. Ideally, they would first try to find alternative solutions before making the decision to link to platform specific resources, but some very important capabilities will require this. I wouldn't want to discourage developers by insisting that all plugins must work on all platforms.

I am not sure that having two separate repositories is the best approach either. I don't think that a separate repo should be classified as 'dirty', etc. I would think that this could be addressed by the metadata associated with the plugin.

My preference would be to keep the official QGIS plugin repo more open and allow plugins that do not support all QGIS platforms. Often there are useful tools that are only available for one platform and plugin author does not have power to change that. But we should not make life of users on the supported platform more complicated just because other platforms cannot be supported.

As it was suggested already, if there would be a larger amount of plugins that are not multi-platform, we could have a piece of metadata so that users on other platforms could be warned.

For example, Crayfish plugin for QGIS 2.x did not support macOS - it was a known limitation and it would be sad if the plugin would be rejected from the official QGIS plugin repo just because of that.

Cheers
Martin

I agree that if we want to have plugins sorted by their legality or
other somehow dubious practices, separate repositories are a good way to go.

Plugins which only support a subset of possible platforms are in no way
more nor less critical than any other plugin which claims to support all
platforms.

The metadata we talk about here is not something to lookup by people on
a regular basis, but for

- the plugin manager to check if it's suitable for the current platoform
(i.e. it will not even offer me to install it on my Linux machine), just
like Ubuntu won't even offer arm packages if it's running on a x86_64
machine.

- general information purpose on the plugin website

Yea, but I preferably don’t want to have to lookup a website for every plugin if somebody gives me a list of plugins to install.

If you have plugins, there will generally be a few categories:

1)      The ones that only use Python

2)      The ones that use Python and custom python modules, or native binaries

3)      The ones that use Python R/Java/.NET/C/C++/Ruby/Whatever


Now 1) goes into all platforms, everything else into a platform repository, because it anyway has to. (JRE in the proper version is not necessarely installed)
And done. No metadata necessary.

Since the QGIS maintainers know for which platforms they compile QGIS, that limits the list of necessary platform repositories.
If a third-party wants to support another platform, they can make their own repo.
If it gets traction, it can be added to the main, if not, then it’s good the way it is.

Anyway, since there might be native dependencies, the whole thing would belong into apt/yum/pacman/whatever in the first place, because that is where package management happens, and plugin management is exactly that.
If I want to update qgis to the latest version, I should at the very least get warnings if plugin X is not ready – and I should get that warning the moment I want to update qgis.
Which is why it would belong into the package manager.

Luckily, the plugin manager can do that for us, just like pacman,

Like QGIS?  No, that's not illegal ;)

But running macOS on non-apple hardware is.

Here's another consideration:

What about plugins which target a particular OS, based on features
which are SOLELY available to that operating system?

I'm thinking something like a (theoretical) plugin which enables use
of the Mac "touch bar" in QGIS. It's only EVER going to be of use
under MacOS, yet I'm sure those users would very much value this
plugin and not want to see it held back because Windows/Linux don't
support touch bars...

Bah, one last thing I want to say here:

I think the true nature of open source is that if someone has
developed a plugin under a particular operating system, and hasn't had
the resources to test under other platforms, and then **I** come along
with my different operating system requirements and want to use this
plugin: the ultimate responsiblity lies WITH ME to get MY platform
supported by the plugin. NOT the original author. Sure, most plugin
authors will happily help and fix issues for you, but it's not THEIR
responsibility. Ask them nicely, bribe them with board games, PAY
them, or JFDI yourself. /end rant

Hi all

Frankly I am a little surprised at this thread. While I agree that we should encourage the development of cross platform plugins, I don’t ever recall us stating that it is a hard requirement, and it is not listed as such in the plugin requirements page[1]. If it is going to be a requirement, let us make it clear and upfront so that people don’t invest in significant amounts of work only to find their plugin rejected.

@Paolo: Don’t you think it would be better for us to conclude the debate and have a clear policy before contacting other plugin developers?

I think there are probably numerous plugins which are ’single platform’ plugins - even some from our most valued core developers e.g. crayfish in 2.x did not support macOS[2] - thanks for fixing that in 3.x Lutra!

Even in core QGIS we have platform exclusion stuff - can anyone *actually* get grass algorithms to run on macOS?

And what about plugins that exclude users for other reasons e.g. AustrianElevation only works for people in Austria. Isn’t the whole point of the plugin repo to provide a platform for more niche functionality that might not be applicable to all users, albeit discriminated by operating system, societal domain or geographic region?

As a last note for the original poster: if your windows dependency is a windows executable. I did a quick test and was nominally able to get Vesper to run on macOS under wine so I suspect if you are interacting with it via python process calls you should be able to get your plugin to run easily on macOS and Linux (*cough* GNU Linux, apologies St. Ignutius :-P). That would swiftly resolve your original issue and probably equally swiftly open a whole new debate about the relative merits of a plugins in the the QGIS plugin repo that requires a shareware licensed[3] dependency (gosh do people still use the shareware model, you are taking me back 35 years to my misspent youth!).

Hi, 

I think 90% of the devs who stated their opinion in this thread are in
favour of allowing plugins that work only on one single OS. Not because
they like it particularly, but because they want to be pragmatic and
inclusive. I think this is already a clear statement. 

We don't want to encourage single OS plugins. When approving them we can
investigate if they can be made multi-OS with reasonable effort - but we
want to be inclusive. We just have to communicate it clearly that they
only work on OS xy. 

Situation is different with binary stuff in a plugin. Shipping exe files
with a plugin should be clearly forbidden - but if that binary stuff can
be installed separately through a different mechanism, then it should be
fine. 

So if the outcome of this discussion is not clear enough, we can also do
a voting on Loomio. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

My recommendation:

I would implement expose your GRASS add-on as its own processing
provider. You would base this almost entirely off the existing
processing grass provider, but with its own set of description files
exposing only your add on modules. You should be able to do this by
importing the existing grass provider classes, and overwriting the
provider code to have a new ID/name/icon/etc.

This would also make it easy to redistribute - you'd wrap your
provider into a plugin, and then could distribute via the normal
plugin channels. And if you do it right (and only import existing
processing grass code, minimising the copy/paste of this code), then
you're provider will automatically inherit any future fixes and
features added to the main grass provider.

It is going to become increasingly more important that metadata is properly supported for QGIS to enter more commercial markets.

Hi devs,

sorry for cross-posting but I want to be be sure that all of you get
this email.

It seems that github-transifex have a direct integration.

Don't really know how/if we can dig into this topic, but it is worth to
mention ;)

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

I hope this email finds you well.

We are excited to introduce you to our new Github integration. Over the
past months, our team has been working hard on this new initiative to
make it easier for our customers to integrate their Github repositories
with Transifex. With the new GitHub Integration, you will be able to
connect a localization project in Transifex with a specific repository
in GitHub using only the Transifex user interface.

We will continue to stabilize this release and fix any remaining issues
over the coming weeks so we would greatly appreciate it if you could
help us ensure that this is a high-quality release by testing this out
and providing us with your valuable feedback.

So, if you are interested, we will be glad to enable this feature for
your account providing you with early access to this new enhancement.
More information about this can be found in our documentation guide here
<https://docs.transifex.com/integrations/ghost/transifex-github-integration>.

However, if you would prefer an official release instead, then we will
get back to you as soon as this happens.

Of course, it is up to you to select either option but gathering your
feedback for the upcoming official release would be extremely valuable.

Please, let us know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you in advance!


Kind Regards,

Hi All,

Thank you for the lively debate.

Just to answer the concerns regarding the VESPER exe.

I am not distributing the VESPER exe with the plugin.

There are instructions in the provided manual and on the github page on where to download VESPER and how to configure it for PAT on Windows. It is up to the user to do this.  If VESPER is not installed the user will get a warning message and won’t be able to run the kriging part of the tool. There is currently only one tool from a group of around 13 which relies on VESPER. The kriging functionality already provided in QGIS is not suitable for our needs hence we are using VESPER.

Regards,
Christina Ratcliff

Thanks yes that was clear for everyone - just ignore my attempt at a lighthearted dig at the use of shareware, it was not intended to derail the conversation.

That makes me think that perhaps the best win-win solution would have been
to fix/improve QGIS's Kriging implementation instead of relying on a
windows-only binary.

Hi Christina

I'm sure you gathered this already, but in my opinion, your plugin design
and logic regarding the third-party module is precisely as it should be in a
QGIS plugin. It's good that you've surfaced an issue on which hopefully the
QGIS devs are reaching consensus. Thanks for your patience.

Tom

*Dear QGIS Communitywe invite you to elect your favorite community
voting members. One community voting member is appointed in tandem with
each QGIS Country User Group Voting Member.Due cancellation of two
groups and the addition of three groups, this year there is only one
spot up for vote.The purpose of the voting members is to elect the board
(ex PSC) and to collectively make decisions related to QGIS governance
where needed.Please note that in my call for nominations I mistakenly
wrote that incoming community voting members will be selected based on
the number of nominations they receive, whereas in the form I correctly
wrote that we would start a ballot. Please read the instructions
carefully and establish your eligibility to vote which I repeat here for
your convenience:"Only community members with commit rights to an
official QGIS git repository or with write access in transifex are
eligible to vote nominees”*

**

*Voting will close on Wednesday 13 February 2019. The voting form is
here:https://goo.gl/forms/ieqIGSybQJJdcJ1t2*

Message-ID: <ad8152af-f4b3-eebb-3039-ac9599338c3a@developpement-durable.gouv.fr>

Hi all,

If you check the option "ignore the encoding declaration of the internal 
form file", QGIS does not seem to read the CPG file if exists.
Is there a reason not to use the CPG file to automatically propose the 
correct encoding, rather than proposing the last encoding in the dialog 
box (or by drag and drop) ?

regards,
Alain

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] The correct import Qt5 in plugins
Message-ID: <1921123.FRaXzhOnOP@thinkpadx1>

Hi all!

I have a question, I'm developing some Qgis3 plugins, I see that Qgis has some 
"links" to the Qt library, like as:

from qgis.PyQt import uic
from qgis.PyQt import QtWidgets

But, normally it is:

from PyQt5 import uic
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets

Both works well, but:
What is the difference and what is the recommended one?

Thanks
Best regards,
Xavier Corredor Ll.

Hi Xavier,

better to use

from qgis.PyQt import uic

so it is QGIS directly that handles the correct PyQt version to import

Cheers

Hi all,

I've found this WMSRequestDefinedDataSources option in the code (exposed in
the Server GUI settings as "Allow defining datasources in server

First question: what was it for?

Second question: ok to remove it or is anybody willing to add an
implementation in a reasonable time?

@Xavier: some historical background: with the move from qt4->qt5 even
simple plugins written for both python2 and python3 could not be run in
both QGIS/Qt versions because there was always this

from PyQt{VERSION} import QtX

in the Plugins

By abstracting out the version we 'hide' this and make an upcoming Qt
upgrade easier.
It was also possible to fix some things in between.

Richard Duivenvoorde

The files are unzipped into \omf\ and they have an __init__.py file in 
that folder, it should at least FIND it...

It was possible to request dynamically created vector and raster layers 
by giving path/datasource information to the server (tags RemoteRDS / 
RemoveVDS as SLD extension). To avoid potential security risks, the 
option 'Allow defining datasources in server requests' is off by default.

We don't use it in the current projects, so I don't have a strong 
opinion here.

Hi Marco,

thank you for the clarifications, I think that if that option is not
implemented in the current server version we should drop it, I'll take care
of it.

See eg https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16937 or
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16434 or https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16497
and more... unless I misunderstand what was done.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Updating a WMS layer's legend with the same style
 as the one used by the data provider
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQZxy=uY-x7nrvzV6HafHp5WKkpKDrEcdChrEjh1W7RNug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have a working python code snippet that enables updating a WMS layer with
a different named style.

It basically manipulates the raster provider's `dataSourceUri` property,
replacing the `style=` with a different substring. and then it calls for a
reload of the data and triggers a repaint of the layer. Something like this:

```
provider = layer.dataProvider()
original_uri = provider.dataSourceUri()
new_uri = modify_uri(original_uri)
provider.setDataSourceUri(new_uri)
provider.reloadData()
provider.dataChanged.emit()
```

It is working fine and the layer is shown with the updated style. Now I'd
like to have also the layer's legend be refreshed with the correct style.

Is this possible?

I've tried

```
iface.layerTreeView().refreshLayerSymboogy(layer.id())
```

This does not work, I am monitoring the WMS server's logs and I don't see
any new `GetLegendGraphic` request being issued.

Thanks in advance

Dear Nyal,

thank you for your time and the recommendation.  I guess this is
currently the only reasonable approach to distribute the "provider" and the
plugin.

Kind regards, Nikos

Hi Paulo, 

VESPER provides local block kriging. It has also been adopted as the method and tool of choice by the Precision Agriculture industry here in Australia.

Further information on VESPER can be found at https://sydney.edu.au/agriculture/pal/software/vesper.shtml.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] nodata and raster calc
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjmwvhZkYAQGD64hLE9SKjPyMaOs3CRKauHQmXo3oo=+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm seeking some feedback on whether our current handling of nodata
pixels in the raster calculator is correct, or (my suspicion) annoying
and limiting.

Currently, we treat nodata pixels the same as a "NULL" value in SQL --
so ANY function or operation with nodata as an input results in a
nodata output.

This means:

- nodata + 1 = nodata
- nodata * 1 = nodata
- nodata AND 1 = nodata
- nodata OR 1 = nodata

To me this is a mistake. I don't think we should treat nodata the same
as NULL, and I think for rasters then "nodata OR 1" should return 1.

The end result of the current behaviour is that ANY nodata input
blocks processing of that pixel. So you can't do something like take
two raster files, and create an output showing where either input has
a 1 value (which I would expect raster1 at 1 OR raster2 at 1 to do).

Otherwise, we need to have some concept of "coalesce" in the raster
calc. So then at least you could do:

    coalesce(raster1 at 1, 0) OR coalesce(raster at 1, 0) ....


Thoughts?

Nyall

Yes this was by design. IIRC Marco Hugentobler implemented the raster calculator under contract to me a long time ago and we discussed this use case in particular. Our view was that nodal acts as a mask. To work around the case where you want to treat nodata as zero you would need to reclassify the raster to recode null to zero and then perform your calculation. To support your use case couldn’t we just add a zero_if_null(raster) function that you can wrap around layer references? Or use your coalesce idea below - though maybe zero_if_null will be more intuitive?

Regards

Tim

Hi Christina,
thanks for this. I believe implementing this in QGIS should not be hard.
In any case, R has the most reliable and complete set of kriging
methods, and can be used within Processing.
Al the best.

This long and fruitful exchange about usage of Windows-only executables
inside QGIS suggests the availability of some "bridge" made using wine (
winehq.org). This could be an infrastructure made available to Processing
that could ease accessing some valuable tool.

I would see the proposal I made to use wine more in ‘dirty hack’ territory than something we should try to recommend as standard. Far nicer, as others have suggested in this thread, would be to implement missing analysis functionality as core QGIS processing algorithms or lean on our existing integrations like SAGA/R/GRASS etc.

Hi all,
importing the attached shp into PostGIS results in an error[0]. When
saving it to a linestring without the Z dimension, The import goes
smoothly. I suspect this is a bug on our side. Any hint?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <c512e7f4978e44c088fe94c00cbf6355@josephinum.at>

Hello!

I'm trying to change the icon of my python plugin ... but it only changes in Plugin Manager, but the icon gets invisible in the qgis toolbar.
First I copied a new png file to the root of my plugin directory (traktor.png).
I changed the icon_path variable in my .py file from icon_path = ':/plugins/FertilizerMap/icon.png' to icon_path = ':/plugins/FertilizerMap/traktor.png'
After I changed the resource.qrc to
<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/plugins/FertilizerMap" >
        <file>traktor.png</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>

At last I used "pyrcc4 -o resources.py resources.qrc" to compile it. It compiles with no errors or warnings.

Did someone experience the same?

Kind regards Lukas

Message-ID: <CAHCHdbJY3Tm6nkAkR9SUdtmQjAdBMvE9WDv2-YihEARUvYo_Gg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a map document set up with a report that filters an attribute table
based on an attribute in the layers used for filtering (i.e. the "atlas"
layer for lack of a better Reports-oriented term). In 3.4.2 I could use
the @atlas_feature variable to grab the attribute I needed, but I've
discovered this doesn't work in 3.4.4. Was there a change to the handling
of @atlas_feature between the two versions? If so, I'll file a bug report.
Otherwise, I'm at a loss as to what's going on.

Thanks!
Spencer

Hi All,

Thank you all for your suggestions and  ideas for resolving this issue.


The use of VESPER is currently not negotiable, and as I’ve previously pointed out, VESPER is a tool of choice for kriging in the Precision Agriculture industry in Australia. We will continue using VESPER as it is currently implemented in the PAT plugin. If hosting PAT on the official QGIS plugin repository cannot be approved, we will host it on our own repository. This would be disappointing as we believe the official plugin repository would provide the greatest visibility to the broader global  precision agriculture community.

Regards,
Christina Ratcliff

Hi,

Personally I don't see any reason to not allow it in official repo and
there is support for that here as IMO there is nothing bad here and nothing
should force people to work 100% on all platforms all the time because that
is a hell of a lot of work that is hard even for skilled developers.

I appreciate everyone trying to work out a method to allow this to run
cross-platform and a avoid a Windows-only solution, and in a perfect world
that is what we all want, but in this case, it won't work out and I think
having it in the official repo is better than not in this case as it allows
for better user experience for the target users..  If we can get it running
cross-platform by adding stuff to QGIS in future so be it  and we
can reevaluate at that point but I think we need to support this plugin in
this case as it's not how it is.

Regards,
Nathan

We will continue using VESPER as it is currently implemented in the PAT plugin. If hosting PAT on the official QGIS plugin repository cannot be approved, we will host it on our own repository. This would be disappointing as we believe the official plugin repository would provide the greatest visibility to the broader global  precision agriculture community.

Ho I see

I do not see any limitation to have the plugin in the repo until third
party and closed binaries are not distributed with the plugin as is the
case for VESPER executables. Does it make sense to contribute to other
communities (e.g. https://github.com/bsmurphy/PyKrige/issues/41) to open
the implementation that is already public?

Hi all,
I think I have hit a limitation of symbology that was unexpected at
least to me. Rule based symbology seems to be able to use only simple
markers, and not other renderers (heatmaps etc.). Am I missing
something? Is there a deep reason why it has not been added?

Hi Paolo, 

Not sure I can follow you what you want? 

Why combine rule based renderer with heatmaps? What's the use case? 

It is not true that you can only use simple markers with rule-based
symbology. All the symbol levels can be combined with the rule based
renderer (e.g. a simple fill, with a marker line on top of it and a
centroid on top of it and a geometry generator with some formula on top
of it.) 

If you need a heatmap with different filters, you can have the same data
source used in several layers with different filters applied - if this
is what you want? 

It wouldn't make sense to me to have several heatmaps (most likely
overlapping each other?) on the same layer with rule-based renderer.
That would quickly turn into something totall illegible. 

For certain renderers (point displacement and point clusterer) you can
combine it with other renderers, because it makes sense in this context.


Greetings, 

Andreas

having a heatmap when showing full map, replaced by symbols when zooming in.

I can see this for lines and polygons, not with points

Of course I can load the same layer several times, and apply different
symbology activating each layer at different scale, as we did before the
rule-based renderer, but this is cumbersome and inefficient.

All the best.

Message-ID: <2fad01ba-ca72-db6e-60be-0b8a83da6a0c@wildintellect.com>

I'm forwarding an interesting discussion about a possible bug.

TLDR; On some systems when saving edits to a geojson file, a geojson.tmp
is saved instead and never overwrites the original file. This is a
regression from previous versions where saving geojson overwrites the
original file correctly.

Full discussion is on:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/300860/why-does-qgis-3-4-create-tmp-file-instead-of-refresh-editing-layer-after-saving

Can anyone else confirm this behavior perhaps on the dev branch? It's
pretty easy. Make a geojson layer, reload it, edit and try to save the
edits. Do you get a geojson.tmp?

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding Layer tree embedded widgets programmatically
Message-ID: <85baf7ba-912f-5956-4dae-4f4203ba38e6@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Thinking about creating a small plugin which would add a 'Layer tree
embedded widget' to a layer in the legend, I hit:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3170

with a nice example on how to create such a widget (with 2 minor tweaks
see below).

But my question is if it is possible (in the python plugin) to attach
such widget to a specific layer? Now it is working but you can only
activate it via the layerproperties dialog.

I could not find a example or hint for it.

Any pointers appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS

To make Martins example https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3170) work in
QGIS3:

from PyQt4.QtGui import QComboBox
becomes
from qgis.PyQt.QtWidgets import QComboBox

QgsLayerTreeEmbeddedWidgetRegistry.instance().addProvider(provider)
becomes
QgsGui.layerTreeEmbeddedWidgetRegistry().addProvider(provider)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugins translation
Message-ID: <004401d4c39a$dfcde6a0$9f69b3e0$@com.br>

Hi devs,

 

For do the plugin translations I use

 

1) Linguist from QT5

2) The command line: 

    Pylupdate4 -noobsolete PluginName.pro (Is there a new version 5??)

3) and the classical code:

 

        # initialize locale
        locale = QSettings().value('locale/userLocale')[0:2]
        locale_path = os.path.join(
            self.plugin_dir,
            'i18n',
            'PluginName_{}.qm'.format(locale))

        if os.path.exists(locale_path):
            self.translator = QTranslator()
            self.translator.load(locale_path)

            if qVersion() > '4.3.3':

                QCoreApplication.installTranslator(self.translator)

 

        def tr(self, message):

            return QCoreApplication.translate(QWaterPlugin.SETTINGS, message)

 

 

The problem is that the option to use self.tr('message string') is not working. It only works when I use QCoreApplication.translate('Escope', 'message string') even if a tr function defined.

 

It used to work with linguist from QT4.

 

What  Am I doing wrong? BTW Is there a new better way to translate plugins?

 

Another thing, every time I update the translations strings with Pylupdate4, I have to translate all my plugin forms again even without any changes, any help???

 

Thanks,

 

Jorge Almerio

Hi Richard

You can add widgets to a specific layer if you know the widget provider's
id. It is simply a matter of setting up the relevant custom properties.

Take a look at the code in the PR you linked, more specifically here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3170/files#diff-0c8d41d794f1b84a1291aa29bb39392aR114


For example, the standard widget that provides a transparency slider has an
id of "transparency". Lets imagine I select the current layer in the canvas
and then want to make this widgets appear in its legend:

```python
layer = iface.activeLayer()
layer.setCustomProperty("embeddedWidgets/count", 1)
layer.setCustomProperty("embeddedWidgets/0/id", "transparency")
iface.layerTreeView().refreshLayerSymbology(layer.id())
```

This code assumes that the layer doesn't currently have any embedded
widgets.


P.S. - Now that I've tried it, it seems that the transparency slider works
differently for raster and vector layers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] UI: dockwidgets in tabwidgets and signals
Message-ID: <1e16bdb6-c1b0-16f5-ec60-d6bdccea5ee5@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Minor issue, but while looking at the Tile Scale Widget I see that the
orientation of the slider-widget is supposed to change, see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/wms/qgstilescalewidget.cpp#L115

it is connected to the dockLocationChanged-signal, see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/wms/qgstilescalewidget.cpp#L153

This is nice, but I never have seen that working... apparently I always
pull the full (tabbed?) widget (which encloses the tilescale
dockwidget?) to the top or bottom area.
And then this signal is not called, so the orientation of the slider is
not changed to horizontal with me.

BUT: if you ONLY take the TileScaleWidgetPanel (out of the tabbed one,
grabbig it by the bottom tab), THEN the signal is called and you have a
nice horizontal slider.

Others have seen that?

Question: why is our tilescalewidget not receiving the
dockLocationChanged signal when it is part of another dock.

Is the tabbedDock we dock our panels in supposed to bubble up this
signal and not doing it?

Qt docks write:
This signal is emitted when the dock widget is moved to another dock
area, **or is moved to a different location in its current dock area**.
This happens when the dock widget is moved programmatically or is
dragged to a new location by the user.
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdockwidget.html#dockLocationChanged

But I'm not sure if they mean "within it current dock area" or "when it
is in its current dock area"...

Anyway, I do not think other qgis widgets use this signal but I thought
to ask anyway :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I am trying to generate a proportional symbol symbology using data 
defined symbol size in a QGIS 3 python plugin.

Here is the working code :

# Symbol creation
symbolLayer = QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayer()
symbolLayer.setShape(QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayer.Circle)
symbolLayer.setSize(2.0)
symbolLayer.setColor(QColor(31, 120, 180)
symbolLayer.setStrokeColor(QColor(255, 255, 255)
symbolLayer.setStrokeWidth(0.4)

symbol = QgsMarkerSymbol.createSimple({})
symbol.changeSymbolLayer(0, symbolLayer)

# Size definition (Flannery method)
# layer is a QgsSingleSymbolRenderer
strExp = 'coalesce(scale_exp("value", 0.0, 150, 1, 20, 0.57), 0)'
symbol.setDataDefinedSize(QgsProperty.fromExpression(strExp))
layer.renderer().setSymbol(symbol)

The problem is the legend. This code :

# Legend
lgd = QgsDataDefinedSizeLegend()
lgd.setLegendType(QgsDataDefinedSizeLegend.LegendCollapsed)
lgd.setClasses([
     QgsDataDefinedSizeLegend.SizeClass(150, '150'),
     QgsDataDefinedSizeLegend.SizeClass(75, '75'),
     QgsDataDefinedSizeLegend.SizeClass(15, '15')
])

layer.renderer().setDataDefinedSizeLegend(lgd)

produces an enormous legend symbol :
https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvTgU.png

However, if I open the layer properties dialog and update parameters 
with datadefined size assistant, the legend is refreshed with the 
correct size :
https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3Ok2.png

What am I missing ?

Thanks for any hint,

Hi,

Since some time I receive redmine emails of issues which I did not
subscribe to or are involved in. Never thought about it and just ignored.
But today I clicked on the link to the issue, to reply, and found that
that actual email/attachment was NOT in the issue.

Turns out that (I think) those people reply directly to the emails they
receive from Redmine, BUT the reply address is 'redmine at qgis.org' which
apparently is sent to me and/or other admins.

I think we need to do something on this.
- either make the reply email a 'noreply at qgis.org' (or another non
existent email address)
- or (if possible) make the replies work like on github: a reply to
redmin at qgis.org is attached on the issue as comment...

Anybody has some time to dive into this?

Richard Duivenvoorde

I could do it with an Arcgis's extension called ET GEOWIZARD (Uniform

Hi,

There are probably other ways to (this is the que for other to chime in
:-) ), but for QGIS 2.x I created a simple plugin which does this: fill
one or more selected polygons with a grid or diamond shape of points (or
follow a line and put trenches on it).

I created it for a customer, so not sure if it fits your plan (there is
no way to tell the exact number of points for example. But you can find
it in the plugin manager (of QGIS 2.x only):

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/FeatureGridCreator/

Docs:

https://rduivenvoorde.github.io/featuregridcreator/FeatureGridCreator/help/html/en/

If it is something you could use, let me know, if I find time I'll try
to create a QGIS3 version for it.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

You can use the create grid algorithm, which allow a grid of points and
then intersect with the polygons layer:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorcreation.html#create-grid

I haven't tried but it may be possible to use a layer features for extent.

Would this work?

Afterwards select them by your polygon and delete the rest.

Hello.

I’m pretty god at python and I’m trying to make a pluggin for Qgis, but I have trouble figuring out how to make the snap visible with “QgsSnapIndicator snapVisible”. 

Need a hint on how to use it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Meteo in QGIS
Message-ID: <68ba7808-136d-2d7d-d764-5c74f0b1647f@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I think adding to QGIS the possibility of a direct download of meteo
(GRIB) data would be a big improvement, opening many new opportunities.
As you probably know, now GRIB files are fully supported natively by
QGIS, thanks to the work of Martin Dobias, Saber, and Lutra. What is
missing is a relatively simple downloader.
The good news is that there is already a free C++ downloader, from which
we can take inspiration if not directly code:
https://github.com/opengribs/XyGrib/blob/master/src/FileLoaderGRIB.cpp
https://github.com/opengribs/XyGrib/blob/master/src/DialogLoadGRIB.cpp
The port to PyQGIS/Processing seems relatively straightforward; the main
issue is probably replicating the many options available in the download
dialog, plus some specific meteo visualization options (e.g. wind
indicators).
I would be interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign about this -
anyone interested?
More info here:
https://github.com/opengribs/XyGrib/issues/180
Thanks.

Hi Ervin,

I went through the same pain not too long ago. Unfortunately there's no 
graceful way to rename a plugin. I mean, no way to just change the name 
and the stats and history will preserve. You will have to create a new 
plugin basically and deprecate the old one. In my case it was purely 
semantic, functionality didn't really change. If functionality changes, 
I guess creating a new plugin would be the better way anyways.

The way I did it (or better will do it next week hopefully):
1. Upload the new plugin, stating it's the descendant of the old plugin
2. Release a last version of the old plugin, that will only:
     - install the new plugin from the repo
     - uninstall itself
     - don't forget to flag as deprecated!

I'm happy to tell you though, that QGIS makes this reeeeally easy. Have 
a look at my last version, it's literally 5 lines of code (just be sure 
to call unload() before you uninstall):
https://github.com/nilsnolde/orstools-qgis-plugin/blob/01f1c6b1a10c4fdf11c1076e1d1064eaff92b44b/OSMtools/OSMtoolsPlugin.py#L51

I can't remember who suggested this method, but it came from this list 
here too. Other suggestions were simple messages to install the new 
version or other simple user dialogs. Due to its simplicity, I went with 
the auto-uninstall.

Best of luck
Nils

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin idea for Editing multiple layers
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_H=OCJjrkg+QM52c1s7Qbt9NiMt0TmtZnmdxF75HSpDSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I don't do much editing, but recently I needed to edit several layers at
the same time. Although I find the digitizing capabilities of QGIS great,
the bigger bottleneck I found in terms of productivity was in the selecting
tools, because it forces the user to first make the layer active before he
can select a feature in it. Editing multiple layers at the same time forces
you to repeat that over and over again.

So I though it would be nice to create a multi layer selection tool. It
would work like the identify tool, selecting the first feature from top to
bottom, then it would make the respective layer active, therefore ready for
editing.

Other options could be added later, like selecting the next and previous
feature, or selecting all features from all layer. There could be options
to determine which layers can be selected.

Two questions:
- for users: Anyone finds this useful?
- for developers: Being done as a python plugin, will this be to slow if
one uses too many layers/features?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hello Alexandre,
for editing/selecting multiple layers I have used the QAD Plugin before.
For just selecting features from multiple layers there is the MultipleLayer
Selection-plugin:
 https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MultipleLayerSelection/

I think such a tool is indeed very useful.

Regards,
Thomas

I believe that both plugins haven't been ported to qgis3, right?

I never tried QAD, I will look at it.

Thanks

Message-ID: <d4faa2e9-3af1-afe1-2a5d-129bb3f078b2@duif.net>

Hi, (sorry earlier version was encrypted)

for a (2.18) plugin which would only work on a crs in meters I did a check:

if layer.crs().mapUnits() != QGis.UnitType.Meters:
  return
	
Which worked in Linux. Then somebody reported an issue:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/featuregridcreator/issues/8

Where it appears that there seems to be a different behaviour in Linux
vs Windows:

On Linux these:
QGis.Meters
QGis.UnitType.Meters
both work
But on Windows
QGis.UnitType.Meters
throws an 'no attribute' exception??

Off course to fix it for me, I can just go use 'QGIs.Meters', but I
think that it would be better if the UnitType one worked?

Anybody an idea about this? Or how to make this work?

Am I correct that for QGIS3 I should use:
qgis.core.QgsUnitTypes.DistanceMeters ?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

In the QGIS options, there is a list of alternative help paths to search
for documentation.

Is there a zip file (or other means) available to download these docs to
keep them locally? I failed to find something.

Best regards

Matthias

Hi Matthias,

Nope, nothing available. The idea is/was that we add an extra step in
the build Makefile to just zip the language build and rsync it to the
docs server, OR to another download server.

One thing to note is that we (maybe Alexander Neto has better details)
do not have separated builds/image directories for all the docs in the
documentation tree (Documentation, PythonCookbook, Gentle Gis Intro, Doc
Guidelines).
I created a zip from this nights build for you:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/qgisdocs_en.zip  (183Mb)

I would be happy to split this up though.
My idea was to let people choose to download one language (for the
non-testing builds).
I was hoping that we could leave it zipped on the file-system and be
able to view in either in users browser OR in an embedded webkit widget
or so.

Regards,

Richard

How much data are we talking about, the 183Mb from the link above?

If it's not considerably more, I would say in order to minimize the
overhead we could just serve this monolithic file with all doc
parts/languages included in a first step and require the user to unzip
it himself.

Hi,

Yes, once the documentation is built, all images are gathered in the same
folder, which means that there is no way split each document in a clean
way. To separate a certain document (e. g., the user manual) you need to
ignore the other sections in the conf.py or directly on the sphinx_build
command.

On the other hand, adding other languages shouldn't increase the file size
that much, because most images are shared (we don't have many localized
screenshots).

See you soon.

Hi Alexandre,

What would be required to add an additional build step to zip the whole 
content including everything after build and push that to a downloadable 
location?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Provide a max. legend size in case of map unit
	sized symbols
Message-ID: <1550566975-02faad28f4ead928c1a07b86ee95d9ef@opengis.ch>


Hi there  
  
I'm struggling with the following issue [https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21309](https://issues.qgis.org/issues/21309) summarized like this:  
*When using map units as symbol size and having a max value in mm, this value is always taken in the **GetLegendGraphics** request with QGIS Server, what leads to huge symbols there (same in legend of print layout).*  
  
I think it's not always needed to adapt the exact size to the legend.  
So I see three approaches:  
- Don't adapt the size to the legend at all  
- Provide a configuration "Maximum size for legend"- Provide a max size property for the server (does not solve it for print composer)  
  
Where I would prefer the "Maximum size for legend" configuration.  
  
What do you think?  
  
Thanks  
Dave

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qgis flatpak - how to install additional python
	packages required by plugins?
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQZcN11G1+k=EeKuUi=wC-wbhc68fCQFDaoG9p7mxD3rpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
I'm using the flatpak version of QGIS and I'd like to install some
additional python packages. Is this possible?

My current use case is I'd like to install the Time Manager plugin. This
requires the `future` package, which I do not have installed. So I want to
install it.

The flatpak is using its own internal python and I'm not sure how I'd go
about pip installing stuff.

Looking around the web I couldn't find much info on this. Seems like a tool
like flapjack[1] might be usable for this, but it is seeming like overkill.

Thanks

Hi David,
>From a user point of view, using both desktop and server, I would go to the
second option with a configuration setting.
I think it should apply to all the classes of a layer, as soon as one of
the class symbols reaches max size, just don't scale any of the symbols in
the legend. This way you won't have a wrong legend, with some classes still
being scaled and bigger classes fixed.
Thanks for tackling this, it's a real issue for most users.
Best regards
Régis

Thanks for your feedback, Régis.  
  
So you propose to have all the symbols of the layer in the legend the same size, if one of them reaches the maximum size? Means, that some could even be "scaled up" in the end (because they would be smaller otherwise), correct? I understand the approach but I'm not convinced. The other solution would just have an individual max. size for the symbols in the legend. Then everything is scaled - just not bigger than the maximum.  
  
Btw. do you think it makes sense to have this configuration per symbol class / layer / project?  
  
Cheerio

Hi Matthias,

If I recall, each language is a separate build, therefore, adding a zipping
step in the makefile would create individual packages for each one of them.

Let me confirm if the languages output share the screenshots or not. If
that is the case, then it might be easier (even smaller) to zip the full
content of what we have in the site.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qgis flatpak - how to install additional

Daniele, all

I've checked the linked issue (and the others too) and it seems like there
isn't much traction to this. I'm just bringing it to attention here on the
list.

>From what I've gathered there is currently no easy way of installing
additional python packages that might be required by plugins when using the
flatpak install.

The flatpak effort seems great, but IMO, without a working strategy for
installation of plugin dependencies it is hard to consider it a viable
approach.

Anyone else has had success rocking the flatpak build with additional
python packges?

Isn't the underlying issue here that server generates the legend
without any knowledge of map scale? (And presumably uses a scale of 0
or some other huge scale, resulting in the symbols taking their
maximum size)?

If so, then i think the solution is:

1. Expose the choice of scale within the GetLegendGraphics call
2. Allow users to set a "default" legend scale for a particular
project, and use this scale when generating the legend.

> (same in legend of print layout).

Can you elaborate? The legend in print layout correctly follows the
scale of the linked map item (and there's unit tests covering this).

It doesn't work on Linux for me (Fedora 29). I think Qgis.Meters is

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Accessing GRASS GIS addons from within QGIS
In-Reply-To: <20190208185500.smd62kqkgb3uk6sd@imap.dreamhost.com>
Message-ID: <20190220004458.ymz5queiqiwftcx6@imap.dreamhost.com>

Dear lists,

following Nyall's recommendation [0],

[0] https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2019-February/056155.html

a QGIS plug-in [1] adds a provider in QGIS' Processing Toolbox to
expose a GRASS GIS add-on [2].

[1] https://gitlab.com/pmav99/estimap_recreation_qgis
[2] https://gitlab.com/natcapes/r.estimap.recreation

The installation of the/any GRASS GIS add-on, is independent from QGIS
and its Processing framework.  Nevertheless, it would be nice from a UX
point of view, if the plug-in can also install the GRASS GIS add-on
itself.

To perform the installation, the following is required:

1) enter in a GRASS GIS session
2) run `g.extension -a`, parse the output and check if the add-on is installed
3) if the add-on is not installed, then run `g.extension
extension='r.estimap.recreation'`

These steps do not manipulate any data.


Grass7Utils features the following relevant methods [3]:

- `executeGrass`
- `startGrassSession`
- `endGrassSession`

[3] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/1d8bd004a619cb001cfc469fd42a6f71ecb93888/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7Utils.py#L365-L469

There is, however, no documentation about what the arguments should be.

1. Is this the appropriate way to do this?
2. Is there any documentation or example code?
3. Where would it make sense to "plug-in" this code? Currently,
`Grass7AlgorithmProvider` is subclassed without essential modifications
[4] and it would make sense to keep it this way [5].

Message-ID: <CAD3koGmhtG02wsupyXW9D1YTM_MBOODHKGc=1dGpZqY0YtqJRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi qgis-devs,

I recently updated 15 QGIS-plugins to be QGIS3-ready. Most of them were
self written (in house) plugins but four of them were also plugins from the
official repository which were written by someone else.

I noticed that there are severals tasks that have many plugins in common
like:
- load a vectorlayer
- add a layer to the layertree
- iterate through all (visible?) layers of the layertree
- show a message with different levels (info, warning, critical)
- log messages
- reading setting, writing settings
- ...

It seems a bit ineffective that every developer writes these common task
'from scratch'.

There already were some ideas to collect common functions that could be
re-used by plugin-developers:

-some older functions (GIS2) like

https://github.com/NathanW2/parfait

https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis_wrappers

and something newer like

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/lib-qgis-commons
https://pypi.org/project/qgiscommons/


One nice example for utilities collected for a (huge) plugin is:

https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/tree/master/safe/utilities


Wouldn't it be possible to provide such a collection not only from privat
persons/projects but from the QGIS-project itself so users could add common
functions?
I think the chances would be higher that such a "official" collection would
be used in the long run and constantly extended.

Apart from the fact that developers could save time while writing their
plugins this could perhaps also help to improve the overall quality of the
qgis-plugins as there would probably be several persons who could/would
countercheck these common functions to make sure they are well written.

regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Recently more and more is added to QGIS in the `qgis.utils` module, for 
example the latest addition is the `@alg` decorator for processing 
algorithms [1].

I really like these efforts and more additions are very welcome!

 From a workflow perspective, it's good to come up with a QEP or a 
thread on the mailing list first. Very often those snippets overcome 
shortcomings of the QGIS API which should rather be fixed on C++ side.

Bests

Matthias

Message-ID: <979563ba-f5ba-38d4-b0b6-fd4826277536@carto.net>

Hi,

I have a reproducable crash when opening the attribute table in form 
mode on Windows. Most likely related to some relation reference widget 
initialization. The same crash doesn't happen on Linux (at least not 
when the PostgreSQL db is on the same machine).

Now - Matthias could have a look at it.

However, my problem is, that I can't see the crash dialogue anymore 
where I can copy the stracktrace.

The debugging symbols are installed for my OSGeo4W installations, 
however, I never see a dialogue where I could copy the stacktrace.

Is there some setting that enables display of crash dialogue / 
stacktrace on Windows?

All I get is this dialogue here:

Thanks if you have any idea.

Andreas

This is a single line via the existing API :

    vl = QgsVectorLayer( '/home/me/my.shp' , 'my_layer' )

I'm curious to hear how this could be improved?

> - add a layer to the layertree

# all layers
layers = [l.layer() for l in QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayers()]
# visible layers
visible_layers = [l.layer() for l in
QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayers() if l.isVisible()]

Ok, not super-obvious in this case, but still quite concise ;)

The QgsSettings class should make this straightforward

I'm not saying we can't improve the PyQGIS experience, but I don't
personally see these as good candidates.

I think we have a LOT of work to do with things like:
- throwing proper exceptions instead of crashing/returning "None"
values/returning "invalid" objects (e.g. QgsGeometry.fromWkt should
ideally raise an exception for invalid wkt instead of returning a null
geometry)
- providing Python-esque things like __repr__ methods, __len__, []
operators (which behave in a python style, e.g. with -1 returning the
last item), iterators, etc
- providing more "context managers" (e.g. with .... : #something )

(Definitely don't take this as a "don't proceed"... there is a VERY
STRONG need to improve the PyQGIS API/Documentation/examples, and this
would be very valuable work!)

Same for me with https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19118. Crashes without the
crash handler appearing to give me the trace.

Hi Tom,

Thank you for the reply.

Interesting - seems that in certain cases the crash handler is not 
appearing on Windows!

It doesn't seem generally broken - because I get the crash handler 
dialogue for other crashes - just not for the ones I am interested in ;-(

At least - good to know I am not the only one who is affected by this.

Strange ...

Andreas

Hi Andreas

It *might* be more specific even than that. You suspect your crash might be
triggered by an edit widget. Mine definitely is.

Thanks

Tom

Hi all,

Yes - I also think that my crash is related to an edit widget in form 
view (relation reference widget).

Unfortunately, I can't reproduce the same crash on Linux - even with a 
slow db connection the crash doesn't appear on Linux.

Shortly before the crash, I get the numeric values in the relation 
reference widgets, instead of the human readable text values I expected.

Hi Nyall  
  
I think, you're right. If there's no max size defined (enabled) on the GetLegendGraphics, it responds with memory error (so possibly because the size gets infinite because of zero scale).   
I thought that it has been the issue in the print layout as well, but I'm not sure anymore and I will check again when I'm back in the office. If it's not the issue on print layout - like you say - then I agree on your approach. Where should this default scale be defined in your opinion?  
  
Thanks  
Dave

I can confirm that there is no issue on print layout. I have been wrong because if there is not yet a map added, it displays the symbols in max size - what is not an issue since one don't need a legend without map. So I'll check out the solution with scale as request parameter and the default size in case there is no scale available.  
  
Thanks and regards

Hi,

with Windows 10 / Windows 7, QGIS 3.4.4.3 (OSGeo4W64, code version af723c4942) I have the problem that the window "Enter Credentials" is called again and again during work. The "Log Messages" says:

 WARNING    Connection to database failed
             fe_sendauth: no password supplied
			 

But I can't find a corresponding message in the PG server log. No entry is made there. 
This error does not occur with QGIS version 3.4.4.1 (OSGeo4W64, code version f6ddc62fdb) or with Xubuntu 18.04 with 3.4.4+28bionic (code version f6ddc62).

Can anyone confirm this bug?

Thanks a lot and kind regards

Burghardt

Hi Nyall,

thanks for your feedback.
You are right that some of my examples were not ideal to explain what I
meant, so I try to explain it a bit better this time ;-)

Some of the following pyqgis-examples may be outdated as things can be done
easier in qgis3 now but they should just be an example
for some functions that were written by users to make life easier during
the development of QGIS plugins.


Example1: QgsVectorlayer:

I wrote "load a vectorlayer" but meant "create a vectorlayer"

Something like:

https://gist.github.com/rdbath/bbba7640cf98ab09dc9bb6018011f05e#file-pyqgis_common_functions_examples-py-L24


Example2: For loading layer I meant something like

https://gist.github.com/rdbath/bbba7640cf98ab09dc9bb6018011f05e#file-pyqgis_common_functions_examples-py-L7
:


def load_layer(filename, name = None):
'''
Tries to load a layer from the given file
:param filename: the path to the file to load.
:param name: the name to use for adding the layer to the current project.
If not passed or None, it will use the filename basename
'''
name = name or os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(filename))[0]
qgslayer = QgsVectorLayer(filename, name, 'ogr')
if not qgslayer.isValid():
qgslayer = QgsRasterLayer(filename, name)
if not qgslayer.isValid():
raise RuntimeError('Could not load layer: ' + unicode(filename))

return qgslayer

Example3: Iterate through layers:


> # all layers
> layers = [l.layer() for l in

>


> # visible layers
> visible_layers = [l.layer() for l in

>

For the example of  visible_layers = [l.layer() for l in
QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayers() if l.isVisible()]  :
I would probably have needed some minutes to search in one of my plugins if
I have used such a code snippet before or google gis.stackexchange ;-)
Probably I also wouldn't have written such a fancy nice one-liner to get
these layers.

So if there would be a pyqgis-commons library where I would know that I
just have to call a function "get_visible_layers" instead of  using
[l.layer() for l in
QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().findLayers() if l.isVisible()]  I
probably could use this in my next plugin without having to search/google
how to do this.


Example4: show messages / log messages:

>
> > - show a message with different levels (info, warning, critical)
>
> iface.messageBar().pushWarning('blah','some message')
> iface.messageBar().pushInfo('blah','some message')
> iface.messageBar().pushCritical('blah','some message')

> QgsMessageLog.logMessage('my plugin','something', Qgis.Critical)



I had something in mind like the MessageManager of Germán Carrillo:

https://github.com/gacarrillor/AutoFields/blob/master/MessageManager.py

I like the MessageManager because I can easily switch between the
message-modes 'production' or 'debug.

One other example would be the function "display_warning_message_bar" from
the inasafe-utilities where I can show a short message and also provide a
button to show more details about a warning:
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/bd00bfeac510722b427544b186bfa10861749e51/safe/utilities/qgis_utilities.py#L132



 Example5: Settings:

>

>
> The QgsSettings class should make this straightforward

Here I hat something in mind like the qgis-settingsmanager of opengis (
https://github.com/opengisch/qgissettingmanager ).
I know it is not only a collection of python-/pyqt-functions but a whole
python module but I still it is an example of how functionalities are
provided to make the development of plugins easier.


So it is always about providing some helper functions that I could also
write by myself but which will save time during development and can help me
to do the things in a consistent way in all of my plugins.

I don't have such a deep insight in the QGIS-codebase but I guess this
would probably have to be done in the C++-part of QGIS, wouldn't it?


 (Definitely don't take this as a "don't proceed"... there is a VERY

I agree. Even if the PyQGIS-Documentation is now much better than in the
past for me often some short examples like the ones from Thomas Gratier are
really helpful to know how to proceed:
https://webgeodatavore.github.io/pyqgis-samples/

So I see three ideas here:

- provide a collection of common PyQGIS-functions
- provide nice PyQGIS-examples
- improve the PyQGIS experience in generall (your examples like throwing
proper exception)


regards,
Thomas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Request for Change of UserAgent
Message-ID: <4dbc86c4-311f-1002-379a-390141baf896@duif.net>

Hi Devs, PSC,

I had a short talk on IRC to 'Firefishy' the person who runs
tile.openstreetmap.org CDN
(in bcc, and see: http://irclogs.geoapt.com/qgis/%23qgis.2019-02-20.log)

In short: he/osm has an issue with QGIS using 'Mozilla/5.0 ....' as
User-Agent header, but QGIS NOT behaving as a true browser.

He explains that the tricks to create their abuse filters do not work on
QGIS because (for example) we do not honor cookies.

I asked this earlier:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-Do-we-have-a-User-Agent-string-for-QGIS-td5360740.html

But in my opinion now is time to change our default UserAgent.

In the email thread above people were afraid that certain wms proxies
would block us, but I think we should just try.

IF we have proxy troubles, we can change the UserAgent per service? For
example change the UserAgent only for OSM related services.
Mmm, is it possible to do that via Python...

I think that we should honor requests from a colleague-FOSS-service. He
notes that they are exceeding 17000 tile requests per second at peaks...

Hi Richard,

Sounds fair to me, you can put the user agent string setting (
/qgis/networkAndProxy/userAgent ) in global_settings.ini, no need to
rebuild.

QgsProcessingAlgorithm needs to implement this useless method
(createInstance) in my view of point.

Why do we even need the createInstance method? Couldn’t it be generic:

def createInstance(self):
    return self.__class__()

Ah, that one IS a source of pain. QGIS 3.0 makes it easier with

   new_empty_memory_layer = QgsMemoryDataProvider.createMemoryLayer( ... )

   and

   new_memory_layer_with_copy_of_features = source_layer.materialize(
QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression( ... ) )

You'd still need to follow these up with a call to QgsVectorFileWriter
to save as a disk based format.

There's some trickiness here because with some disk formats it's not
possible to create an empty layer upfront -- e.g. geojson. You have to
have some features ready to initially populate that layer with at time
of creation.

I'd be interested to hear any ideas for "ultimate wishlist" api here?

This approach is somewhat of a hack, which is why I wouldn't like to
see it as part of any "officially supported" python library. Really,
API for doing this belongs in core QGIS API itself (covered by
appropriate documentation + unit tests, of course!)

Right - but again, this doesn't belong in a Python specific library.
What we need here is a core API addition "visibleLayers":

    visible_layers = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot().visibleLayers()

Once again, I think this could easily be in the c++ API, so that both
Python and c++ code could take advantage of it. I don't see anything
Python-specific here.

Yes, that one *is* nice. I think Denis originally intended that to be
made available in the default PyQGIS library, but I suspect just ran
out of time.

> So it is always about providing some helper functions that I could also write by myself but which will save time during development and can help me to do the things in a consistent way in all of my plugins.

Right, but I think it's very important to differentiate here between:

1. API additions which are useful in all contexts (c++ and Python)
2. Python specific API additions, which make use of Python only
functionality like decorators, exceptions, and context managers

I'd love to see discussion on how we can merge this awesome resource

resource!

Hi Richard,

Each user can change the UserAgent, as ElPaso pointed out (under
Advanced settings).

But you are suggesting to start distributing QGIS with a different
default other than "Mozilla/5.0", right? Which kind of UserAgent you
think is a good one? "QGIS <version>"?

We can also add another default setting (not difficult to implement) to
use a specific UserAgent string when using te OpenStreetMap tile
service, and keep the default for all other services. Something like:
connections-xyz\OpenStreetMap\useragent=QGIS

Regards,

Jorge

Don't we already append "QGIS" to the end of the Mozilla/5.0 string?

QgsProcessingAlgorithm is a c++ class, which has no concept of
metaclasses and so requires subclasses to manually implement this
method.

But it should be possible to bake this into the PyQGIS bindings alone
- see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9226

(Firefishy/Grant in bcc)

Yes we have, but it is for OSM admins still to difficult to distinguish
apparently, AND it makes it more difficult that we say we are a browser
but do not act as one.

Maybe Jorge's proposal is best: for Nominatim and OSM servers we do
another UserAgent?

I would really like to understand (i.e. get an explanation) from the OSM
admins as to why a user agent that explicitly identifies itself as QGIS
like we have now is not enough for them before moving forward.

Being a web admin/developer myself, I can hardly find a reason why that's
not enough.

I'm more curious than anything else, lots of love to the great OSM guys :)

Cc'ing this to Grant/Firefishy too, so maybe he wants to answer here.

But one of the things he convinced me with was, that for example in
browsers they can work with cookies, while QGIS shows itself as a
Mozilla browser, BUT does not accept cookies etc etc.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MacOS and touchbar
Message-ID: <CAB28Asi1KiF0N2dnBEF8B8mcA9sZXozhFuH-TPLd27wUAB9V5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

This is just a heads up for any MacOS developers -- there's been some
upstream work recently on Qt and handling the MacOS touchbar. There's
two separate pieces of work here:

1. A (proposed) upstream Qt class - QMacTouchBar. Read more here:
https://www.kdab.com/qmactouchbar-has-landed/
Looks good in that it's intended to be part of the Qt library.

2. QtCreator's own implementation of touchbar handling - see
https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/commit/?id=3c5650e514d6d8bad86a54a037e550db7cc19a71
This one actually looks a lot nicer then QMacTouchBar, because it
allows for "nested" touchbars based on QAction.

If any MacOS developers* are motivated, I'd suggest [2] could be
pulled into the QGIS mac native library and used throughout QGIS.

Nyall

( * I'm neither a mac user nor a fan of the touchbar concept, so aside
from this heads-up I personally won't be pursuing this further)

Message-ID: <1dc6e4a6-894e-b34e-91a6-1bc74102936a@duif.net>

Hi Devs,Users,

Users report that in the 'Open Vector' dialog some items were shown
twice (geojson[0] and esri shape[1]).

I had a look into it for the geojson [2] and the issue is that we show
the dropdown with 'formats' based on the Drivers that GDAL is giving us.
In the case of geojson there is also geosjonseq: a way to 'stream'
features as json, and then in a couple of subvariants.
I added those in the dropdowns for 'files' and 'protocols'. But voices
say that this is actually cluttering the user interface.

So before trying to fix the esri one too (which is double because there
is also a ESRIjson) I was wondering what others think of adding all
these possibilities.

As an example: we could add a 'ESRI json' item in the file-open
dropdown, with filter esrijson and json? But should we also add an
esrijson protocol option?
GDAL/OGR will actually pick the right driver anyway: opening [3] as
geojson will happily show the esrijson as features...

Personally I'm ok with adding all the options, as I think they also show
the possible flavours or file extensions possible.

What do you think?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think we should be pushing users to use the native FeatureServer
provider here, as it has several advantages:
- downloads features "on demand", instead of upfront. (And many times
it will download these responsively in a background thread during the
rendering process)
- automatically styles layers with the same styling and labeling as is
set on the server
- full support for QGIS networking, including authentication system
- support for accessing data with custom referral checks and via
"borrowed" ESRI authentication tokens

(and hopefully in 3.8, editing support!)

Hi all,

Just a heads up: now that 3.4 is officially the LTR, I've enabled
github branch protection on the branch. This means all commits to the

I wonder if it is worth spending any effort on this? My experience from having a Touch Bar on my Mac is that I never use it, and when I do because I have to (e.g. to adjust volume or brightness), I wish I had keys rather. Maybe others do find it useful and I am an outlier, but without a ground swell of eager users, I think we might just be wasting effort (and bloating out code) on something that users won’t use.

I love Macs but the Touch Bar == fail for me.

Tim

Nyall, ok for the FeaturesServer protocol this is clear then: hide it
there.

Question: But should we then (only) add it to the Files-open? Because
having a esrijson file on disk, it could be handy to be able to open it?
Currentl FeatureServer provider only provides opening of online data
(which I think is fine)

Question: Then same for SaveAs, I think we should add it, as it could be
handy to be able to save some shp/json dataset to a esrijson file, eg
because you want to see what it looks like or because something is going
wrong?

Question: about file extensions... nope I'll do that in separate thread

Looks great!

One thing we could (but I'm not sure if we still should) is to be able
to translate it in transifex. The sphinx-based cookbook was in the
process, so could be translated.

I really like Thomas examples and clean view (though it says 'published
with gitbook' which seems not free?).

Even better (which is also discussed here earlier) is (ideally) a text
in rst (editable in github, and translatable on transifex (or alike),
with included(!) codesamples which could be build/tested on CI (so the
examples keep in line with QGIS main code).

Richard Duivenvoorde

It seems to me there are a few different aspects to this.

- The convention is to stick "Mozilla 5" into user-agents for browsers 
because every other browser uses it. At this point they all pretend to 
be each other - 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1114254/why-do-all-browsers-user-agents-start-with-mozilla

- Looking at a bunch of random user-agents, non-browsers don't usually 
put "Mozilla" in them (there are websites with long lists).

- For some reason OSM can't block the QGIS agent. I'm with Mathieu - 
this seems odd because it explicitly says "QGIS".

- Cookies - QGIS doesn't do this (makes sense, doesn't need them), but 
why does OSM need them? Relying on cookies alone isn't a good idea - 
many users don't allow 3rd party cookies, and many users delete cookies 
when the browser closes or even when the tab is closed (self-destructing 
cookies plugins).

So I'd suggest it probably is worth removing the "Mozilla" component but 
it's not clear what the OSM request is about or why, so there's no way 
to know how to help them solve their problem.

Cheers,
Jonathan

For what I understand, they use some cookie-based trick to help maintain
their QOS (and then to make it possible to throttle a very demanding web
application?).

This made sense to me. Also because I really do not envy maintainers of
such services: it is hard to keep up such free services (as an example
(see irc log) he mentioned that certain transportation software started
to poll the reverse geocoding every second in every car). I think it's
pretty important for us to have OSM, and be helpfull to them.
But if Firefishy/Grant is willing to give more details (he is in bcc)
that would be great.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

I don't think without more information it's clear precisely what QGIS 
should change to help them?

Indeed, personally I'm still not sure what the current problem is for 
them. I get that they have some over-users of their service and need to 
curtail this (a very tricky problem), but what's their current solution 
and how does a user-agent change help it?

I'd suggest against QGIS using different user-agents for destinations as 
was suggested earlier in the thread because down that road lies madness 
(it's a highly opaque thing that /will/ bite people as they try and 
debug issues).

Cheers,

Jonathan

The main fail for me is the missing physical esacpe key. But I guess, touch
bar was not designed for him users. The other fail is that it's only
available for Macbook pro users.

I had also a look and was thinking of taking example of Qt Creator's
implementation. It would be nice to configure the shortcuts for the
touchbar.

But as Tim pointed out, it's quite a big effort for a very few users. I was
thinking to do this during hackfest. Let's see!

FYI: we get a warning from Github for 'moderate severity' issues in our
current Django version we use for plugins.qgis.org:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/network/alert/REQUIREMENTS.txt/django/open

Not sure if we can easily upgrade (I fear we can not), but maybe this is
the que to get some people together next week to have a look into this
and/or to do some plugins.qgis.org work.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error building QGIS server withouth GUI
Message-ID: <1550998211.27345.1.camel@palan.at>

Hello everybody,

we are using QGIS server on our servers, without any GUI. For this I
built a single Debian package without the desktop components and
deployed on the servers. We are using currently version 2.18, but want
to make the switch to 3.4 in the next few weeks, also for participating
more in the dev process.

My problem is with building QGIS 3.4.4:
when I specify the cmake paramters like this:
cmake -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=1 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
        -DBINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL=TRUE \
        -DPEDANTIC=TRUE \
        -DSERVER_SKIP_ECW=TRUE \
        -DQGIS_CGIBIN_SUBDIR=/usr/lib/cgi-bin \
        -DWITH_APIDOC=TRUE \
        -DGENERATE_QHP=TRUE \
        -DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS=FALSE \
        -DWITH_GLOBE=FALSE \
        -DWITH_SERVER=TRUE \
        -DWITH_SERVER_PLUGINS=TRUE \
        -DWITH_QWTPOLAR=FALSE \
        -DWITH_DESKTOP=FALSE \
        -DWITH_GUI=TRUE \
        -DDOXYGEN_ON_DEMAND=TRUE ..

everything builds correctly.
But with WITH_GUI=FALSE the build fails with the following error:
ninja: error:
'../python/plugins/db_manager/db_plugins/postgis/plugins/versioning/pyg
ui', needed by
'python/plugins/db_manager/db_plugins/postgis/plugins/versioning/ui_Dlg
Versioning.py', missing and no known rule to make it

I am not sure what WITH_GUI does in the end, but as I want to remove
any unnecessary components (and therefore install dependencies), please
could somebody point me in the right direction? Thanks!

I keep getting tempted by https://palettegear.com/ , just for the "new
toy" factor. But everytime I think about it, I actually can't see any
practical use for them in QGIS which would improve a real-life
application use case. I think the touch bar falls into a similar
category.

The best use case I can come up with would be shortcuts for different
map themes, but that could just as easily be addressed by adding
ctrl+1, ctrl+2, etc keyboard shortcuts. And then everyone could take
advantage of them.

My main concern is possible regressions if we flip to a
"less-standard" user agent. It's highly likely that there's servers
out there which block requests based on user agent whitelists, so by
changing the user agent across the whole app we'd potentially be
blocking access to these servers.

This makes sense, but thinking about it, it doesn't seem plausible.

If I were whitelisting user agents, there are three ways I'd consider 
doing it.

Explicit full string:
* "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/3.4.3-Madeira" - except of course that'd break next 
time someone updates QGIS by even a point version. So I doubt anyone is 
doing that; too much maintenance. And if they *are* doing this, well 
then they'll have to update their whitelist with the new user agent on 
the new release whether it includes "Mozilla" or not.

* Some sort of regexp looking for that structure (i.e. "Mozilla/5.0 
QGIS/[0-9].[0-9]...") but allow any set of numbers. I can't conceive of 
when this would be the best option or even a "good" option - it's just 
asking for problems with version numbers (what happens when QGIS gets to 
double-digits in any version field for instance?). I don't doubt it may 
solve a particular problem somewhere maybe, but I would hope there 
wouldn't be many using this method (and of course, this is assuming that 
the "Mozilla" is part of the regex).

* Search the user agent for the string "QGIS". I do some things that 
look at user-agents and this is what I do. It's easily the simplest and 
definitely the most fool-proof way to validate a client is at least 
claiming to be QGIS.

So I'd suggest this is probably not something to worry about.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Actually - I'm thinking more of the case where a server doesn't
know/care about QGIS, and is only allowing requests which begin with
"Mozilla/5.0".

Interesting thought. But then, what scenario are you imagining? "Mozilla 
5.0" is typically for web-browsers (Richards original point), it doesn't 
seem to be used for most other GIS and tooling (at least when making OGC 
requests).

Examples of other user-agents that I have to hand (somewhat dated):

"ArcGIS Client Using WinInet" - ArcGIS 9.x (but probably 10.x too)

"Tableau 8100.14.0408.1805; pro; libcurl-client; 64-bit; en_US; 
Microsoft Windows 8 Professional (build 9200)"

"FME/2015.7.8.15021  libcurl/7.26.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8a zlib/1.2.7 libidn/1.25"

And I just downloaded gvSIG and uDig:

"uDig 2.0.0. (http://udig.refractions.net) Java/1.8.0_111"

"Mozilla/5.0 (gvSIG) like Gecko"

So it looks like only gvSIG does the Mozilla thing.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSoMEEG2D6bW3UBy=+W7qpi_A9LG1nk5heWHMxV+3d_qDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

A user who wanted to translate some strings in QGIS 3.4 contacted me
because he could not find them. Giving it a look, it looks like no text
from the
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/help/qgis.yaml
is available for translation (I couldn't find in transifex nor in the ts
file), condemning us to feed our users with only English help texts, for
their first contact with algs. Not nice imho.

Is that a bug or some kind of limitations? Otherwise any chance to get this
fixed in master and backported, please?
Thanks,

Harrissou

Unless the standalone install executable file has been re-uploaded with the
missing EXIV2.DLL dependency, I can confirm this is an issue here on

Hi,

we have had a similar discussion, but not able to find much benefits for
QGIS users too.

Message-ID: <c3657d57-0503-b285-336c-b1e1f9d10c3c@opengis.ch>

Hi

Recently sip 4.19.14 has been released, it fixes a critical issue with
our python bindings where geometries are converted to the wrong subclass
(see https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20661).

This leads to problems in custom (and core python based) processing
algorithms and probably other places too.

Would it be possible to upgrade sip to the latest version on OSGeo4W
(and any other builds where we ship sip ourselves)? If I can do
something to help, please let me know!

Best regards

Matthias

Honestly, these types of questions always get no reply. Windows build
issue are SO heavily dependant on the local environment that it's
almost impossible for anyone else to diagnose your problem.

You've also just demotivated anyone who was going to help by posting a
sarcastic reply. Everyone here is volunteer, you need to give people
time to respond.

Hi all,

I'm not a sysadmin but for our customers I'd like find the better way 
for deploy QGIS-server 3.

I try at least 3 ways:

1) Apache2 + libapache2-mod-fcgid

2) Nginx + fcgiwrap

3) Nginx + QGIS-Server working by socket/service (systemd)

By delveloper side, what do you think is the best?

I'd like to much 3) solution, but I found some problems, in particular, 
how many sockects I've to create watching at my server? (Number of 
processors )

For 1) and 2) have you experiences on performance and tuning?

Thanks in advance and thanks for work!

W

Hi Walter,

We, at 3Liz, use the 3) with supervisord and the number of process is 
based on the number of preocessors.

But we also used for QGIS3 a 4th way, a python server based on tronado:

On the camptocamp side, we use 1) within a docker image:
https://cloud.docker.com/u/camptocamp/repository/docker/camptocamp/qgis-server

What I strongly recommend is to add a FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess with a
value of 1000 (work around some potential  memory leaks in QGIS). I'd say
to set the number of processes to the number of CPU cores.

Ciao Walter,

we use 5) Nginx + spawn-fcgi (a lighttpd project) in multiple Docker
containers [0]. As a thumb rule I use one process per Docker with number of
QGIS threads equal to the available CPU 'cores' and a number of Docker
containers also equal to the number of CPUs. It depends anyway much on the
workload (i.e. long running requests vs quick ones).

When not using containers I would go for 3) nginx + systemd.

Cheers,
Daniele

Hi all,
now that 3.4 is LTR, is there a deb repo for 2.18? The reason is that
unfortunately several web clients (notably Lizmap) are not yet ported to
3, so a server install will require the old 2.18.
Thanks.

Does the API for 2.18 work for others?

When trying it here

https://qgis.org/api/2.18

becomes

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5eecQteG-Q844hZ6pttWvT+_ORWxCkqCt9KSYBcD9C+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I needed to gather basic stats for a layer containing multiple fields. I
created the following gist to compute the number of features per each
unique value for a list of given fields
https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/a234efb7e67ebd8dae3a04cb26cf5e72

I know I could use PostgreSQL to do it (see
https://twitter.com/kimaidou/status/1100053546978983936 conversation), wich
is much faster, but I needed a quick way to do it with Python.
I tested virtual layers too, but my source layer has many fields (with some
heavy data) and the copy/pasting into spatialite was not efficient here.

The method uniqueValues(fieldIndex) of QgsVectorLayer is pretty fast
compared to my iteration through the layer features. Any hint how to
improve the speed of my calculation ?

Regards,
Michaël

Hi,

For what I know there is no api call for it directly, but you can search
for child widgets in the main panel, something like this:

for widget in iface.mainWindow().children():
    if widget.objectName() == 'MessageLog':
        widget.show()

Or shorter (but trickier):

iface.mainWindow().findChild(QDockWidget, 'MessageLog').show()

With me this pops up the Messagelog Panel (though then you do not have
your tab yet, but that is a child of that one probably...)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ps what do you want to use it for, because more people see the use of it
maybe we can just add it (or ask to be added?)?

Checkout trap #3 from
http://nyalldawson.net/2016/10/speeding-up-your-pyqgis-scripts/.
Specifically, since you aren’t doing anything with the geometry, and
are only using a single attribute from the layer, by calling setFlags(
QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry ) and setSubsetOfAttributes() you can
tell QGIS that you don’t need the geometry, and only require a single
attribute’s value in the feature request. This will give a huge speed
boost to the feature fetching.

Potentially this could be a new method in QgsVectorDataProvider which
sends a native query to be executed on the backend (like uniqueValues
does -- that's why it's so fast). But that would require an addition
to the c++ QgsVectorDataProvider class, and implementations in the
popular vector data providers.

Thanks Nyall,

@all: I think it is still possible to add some nice screenshots or
pictures. If you have some time, please have a look at:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.6.0/

and maybe add some screenies.
First thing I will do then in A Coruna (monday) is to push the changelog
in the website and make it translatable.

Unless everybody thinks it is ok as is now, then I can maybe do it tomorrow.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Nyall,
looking at the changelog I don't see the raster SLD export.
We have a guide and screenshots here:
https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/qgis/index.html#exporting-raster-symbology

I'm also happy to contribute bits to the document directly, if I have
enough access to do so...
could I do a PR somewhere for example?

Cheers
Andrea

Hi Richard,

That worked perfectly, thanks!

When developing plugins I always find myself opening the Log window and the Python console, after I start up QGIS. It would be nice to have a way to save the panel layout. At the moment though, your code snippet is sufficient for my needs.

Regards,
Tej

Hi,

For what I know there is no api call for it directly, but you can search
for child widgets in the main panel, something like this:

for widget in iface.mainWindow().children():
    if widget.objectName() == 'MessageLog':
        widget.show()

Or shorter (but trickier):

iface.mainWindow().findChild(QDockWidget, 'MessageLog').show()

With me this pops up the Messagelog Panel (though then you do not have
your tab yet, but that is a child of that one probably...)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ps what do you want to use it for, because more people see the use of it
maybe we can just add it (or ask to be added?)?

Hi Patrick,

thanks for FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess indication, so for processes you 
set FcgidMaxProcesses or FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass?

In example FcgidMaxProcesses 4 if cores are 4?

Do you have docker file for qgis-server image that you post here?

Thanks

thank you for reply, I used only one time supervisord for a project. The 
4th way it'd be very nice :). Thanks.

This is clear :)

In example if you have 4 cores you create 4 qgis-server socks file and 
put every soscks in a nginx upstream:

upstream qgis_mapserv_backend {
         server unix:/run/qgis-server1.sock;
         server unix:/run/qgis-server2.sock;
         server unix:/run/qgis-server3.sock;
         server unix:/run/qgis-server4.sock;
}

In this way?

Grazie

There is Apache2 + mod_proxy_fcgi that you could use as well. As
opposed to mod_fcgid, mod_proxy_fcgi requires that you use your own
method for starting the FastCGI process(es) (QGIS Server here). In this
regard mod_proxy_fcgi is very similar to NGINX-based setups.


> 2) Nginx + fcgiwrap

I recently added a note to the QGIS Server docs [0] that recommends
against fcgiwrap. fcgiwrap is very slow, because it creates a new QGIS
Server process on each request!

[0]
<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/getting_started.html#nginx>

> 
> 3) Nginx + QGIS-Server working by socket/service (systemd)


I like this one a lot, because it doesn't require anything else than
systemd, which has become very very common on Linux distros. I even
wrote a blog post about it :-) See [1].

[1]
<https://oslandia.com/en/2018/11/23/deploying-qgis-server-with-systemd/>


> 
> By delveloper side, what do you think is the best?


As already said I like the systemd-only method because it doesn't
require more than systemd, which you probably already have and use on
your Linux system.

spawn-fcgi works great as well, but you will need to use something like
supervisord, or write a systemd system unit for it.

I'd recommend using one QGIS Server process per processor, or even a
few more for more parallelism during I/O operations. For example with 4
processors I think you can use 6-8 QGIS Server processes.


> For 1) and 2) have you experiences on performance and tuning?

Don't use 2 :-) I don't have much experience with 1 so I won't comment.
But Patrick's suggestions sound very good to me :)

One final note: at Oslandia we either use NGINX + systemd, or NGINX +
spawn-fcgi when running QGIS Server in Docker container. If you want
to use Docker I'd recommend taking a look at [2], which explains how we
build and run QGIS Server using Docker.

Good luck!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WMTS/XYZ on high DPI screens
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFf6G9tA+cNovv-dQthgxfo9zfrDzJ8OeFmrPt6+CT128A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Whenever I use a background map like OpenStreetMap on my high-res
laptop screen (192 DPI) in QGIS, the labels are tiny. That is
"natural" because tiles are made for screens with ~96 DPI where the
size of labels is just fine. When I look at OSM tiles in the browser,
I can see that the browser displays the tiles scaled ... so even
though the tiles do not look super crisp, at least I do not need a
magnifying glass to read labels.

A similar problem I have encountered before is when using tiles from
WMTS/XYZ in print/PDF output: with higher resolution of print the
rendering engine picks very detailed tiles which again may contain
very tiny labels.

I would like to fix this in QGIS but I am wondering what would be the
correct approach.

One simple (and wrong?) solution would be to just scale tiles of all
tile layers, but I guess if the service displays some raw imagery it
would be wasteful to scale them as this unnecessarily would remove
details which could be still shown on high res display.

Other solution would be to introduce a new flag for WMTS/XYZ layers
where users could set native DPI. By default this flag would be
disabled, but for services like OSM one could explicitly set their DPI
to 96 and get the tiles scaled accordingly. This would need an update
of raster block request API as well where we would also need to
specify output DPI in addition to output width/height (but that should
not be a big deal).

This solution could also work nicely with services that provide
high-res tiles (using 512x512 for each tile instead of 256x256) -
right now QGIS thinks they are 256x256 so instead of a magnifying
glass one needs a microscope - you can try it [1]. Setting explicitly
DPI of high-res tiles to 192 DPI should also fix also that issue.

My only worry is if this setting is not going to be too difficult to
use for ordinary users... But maybe a combo box would make the choice
easier: "Normal resolution (96 DPI)" / "High resolution (192 DPI)" /
"Custom resolution" (with a spin box).

Are there any opinions / ideas how to deal with that?

Cheers
Martin

If I understand you correctly, the scaling that you see on OSM is only
done on client side (in javascript)?

That sounds like a promising path.

Alternatively, I was wondering if this could be done on layer/renderer
level instead of provider level, with no provider changes involved, as a
"magnification factor" on the layer. The advantage would be that it
could be applied to any raster format (WMS or even local tif files
generated using the "Convert map to raster" processing algorithm).

Just an idea, I didn't look into if/how this is doable code-wise.

I wouldn't worry too much about that and rather have a clean and
powerful API.

- anything can be hidden in an advanced box in the beginning

- Configuring those is advanced magic anyway, QMS and whatever comes
along to ease the configuration can ship those parameters pre-filled so
the user does not need to care about it

Hi Andrea,

It is a django app, if you create a login (and sent me your username),
we can give you enough rights to edit yourself:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/accounts/signup/

I just added a a simple line and item now. Let me know if you want it to
be changed (added GeoSolutions as funder, could be developer too)

Yes, it should but that always has been buggy: people could add an
entry, but after that could not see/edit it anymore. What we did earlier
was make people (we knew) provide admin rights or so.

But maybe first try and see

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pylupdate5 Error
Message-ID: <008001d4ce0a$6a4f8c60$3eeea520$@com.br>

Hi devs,

 

How to use 'pylupdate5' as described in the documentation

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html?#ts-file

?

 

It's not recognized on my OSGeo Shell terminal. Only pylupdate4 is working

Hi Matthias

Thanks for your thoughts...

Yes this is handled by the client map library. In Javascript there's
window.devicePixelRatio property that gives you ratio between physical
pixels and CSS pixels (i.e. 1 for 96 dpi, 2 for 192 dpi). And if you have
high dpi tiles, then e.g. in OpenLayers you can set WMTS layer's
option tilePixelRatio to 2:
https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/wmts-hidpi.html

I was playing with this idea of magnification too. But with plain
magnification the problem is that the projects would not be portable - if I
have high-res screen and give my project to someone else with low-res
screen, the magnification factor would make tiles too large for them. So
rather than magnification factor it would need to be again something more
like reference DPI for a layer.

And I still think we need to have the DPI information in raster providers
so that they can pick the correct resolution. For example with a WMS layer
I would prefer if WMS server gives me the image for 192 DPI rather than it
would request it for 96 DPI and then just scale it - and for this to be
possible I think the DPI information needs to be propagated with raster
block requests into providers.

Yeah prepared configs from QMS can indeed make things easier.

The current state of varying DPI support in common protocols seems to be
quite poor:
- WMS 1.3 / WMTS 1.0 protocols simply assume that pixel size is 0.28
millimeters wide (that is ~90 DPI)
- there are custom extensions to WMS protocol to pass DPI to it (MapServer,
GeoServer, QGIS server all use different syntax)
- XYZ has no standardization either. I think some people use convention
http://example/layer/z/x/y.png for normal tiles and
http://example/layer at 2x/z/x/y.png for high-dpi tiles (device pixel ratio
2), but this is far from being standard
- ArcGIS REST map service seems to report DPI for tilesets ("tileInfo" ->
"dpi")

In terms of support in QGIS API and implementation:
- QgsRasterDataProvider has setDpi() method which is used in raster layer
rendering. This approach is quite coarse as it sets DPI for the whole data
provider, while the DPI should be ideally set per raster block request
- the value from setDpi() is only used by WMS provider
- DPI information reported by ArcGIS REST service is not used in QGIS

Cheers
Martin

Hi,

There is also the spreadsheet with the bug fixes done during the paid 
bug fixing effort:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F6v4g8Ayb3wIt73rxFKD8h4B95MaTwt-eDit8YvReB0/edit#gid=145548804

I remember that in older Visual changelog we included them as well.

Can we do that again? It would give the effort some visibility.

Can I include that myself and if yes - how?

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New Doxygen policies
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiVGPOkF4_SdbEUj+QPote=EnD4DXw-orvL19URp7yZ5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following the merge of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9269, this is
a notice regarding new practices regarding doxygen comments which
should be adhered to in all 3.8+ code.

The PR introduces some doxygen macro values, TRUE, FALSE and NULLPTR
(all caps). These should be used when dox mention true, false or
nullptr literal values, instead of "true", "false" or "nullptr". E.g.

 /*
  * Returns TRUE if something, FALSE otherwise.
 */

The macros expand out to "\c true", "\c false" and "\c nullptr" for
the c++ dox, and ``True``, ``False`` and ``None`` for Python
docstrings and the Python API docs. Basically, they apply the correct
formatting for literal values and ensure that the language-correct
values are used in the corresponding docs (Python users should never
have to care what a nullptr is!).

I've bulk updated all existing dox, but please stick to the new
strings when writing new dox.

Finally, we should consistently use "returns NULLPTR"/"set to NULLPTR"
instead of "returns a NULLPTR"/"set to a NULLPTR" (no "a"), because
otherwise the Python dox expand to the awkward phrasing: "returns a
None"/"set to a None".

So I'm guessing this setting would apply in print layouts too?
Regardless of the output resolution, it would be exported as though
it's at 96 dpi?

I have a vague feeling that Sourcepole's albiero fork implemented
something similar to this... some possibly related commits are

This wasn't an intentional omission, it was just committed after I'd
already populated the list.

Ah yes, GeoSolutions and Luigi have been doing the planning, execution and
validation,
but funding came from somewhere else (in particular, OSGeo UK, GeoServer
PSC and
Brad Hards), so need to fix that, I'll send you my login.

To All Devs, Funders and Users,

If you know (or you did) something new is created: just add it yourself.

The changelog is not something that is compiled together by a select
group of devs/psc or so.
Everybody can make a login and add his/her favorite piece!

It's easier for us to take out double items then to add something we are
not even aware of :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

	organisation for GSoC 2019
Message-ID: <CA+3oMjvQqcF83oOd8fmVv_CU+NFeQ733nxiZdocXf6Nmpbx7Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS community,
(and sorry for crossposting)

we’re pleased to announce that OSGeo has been selected as an umbrella
organisation for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019.

@Mentors: In the coming days, we admins will be inviting the mentors
that have filled the form [1]. If you want to be a mentor and haven’t
filled the form yet, please do it *ASAP*.

@All members of the community: be prepared and responsive in the
coming days to welcome students and answer their inquiries. From
Google admins: “Students who engage with their organization early (and
often) are more likely to be accepted and then succeed. We encourage
you to get to know the students and help them get to know you! Please
continue to flesh out your ideas lists and documentation over the next
few weeks.”

Please, forward this email to your developer and community mailing list.

@Students:
According to the official timeline [2], student application period
will be March 25, 2019 - April 9, 2019.

For your convenience, this year you can also download the proposal
template from [3]. After filling the template and detailing the
proposal, it must be submitted following the guidelines given by
Google.

Remember to submit your proposal well in advance, so that you can make
the most out of the feedback from mentors and the community at large
and refine your proposal until final deadline. Read the application
instructions here [4]. The same page contains all the info you need
before taking action, read it all carefully! Good luck everyone!

We admins will be available as always at <gsoc-admin at osgeo.org>,
however, consider using public channels if the topic is not sensitive,
i.e. soc mailing list [5]

We are looking forward to working with you towards another awesome
edition of GSoC!

Kind regards
OSGeo GSoC admins

Ok - I had a look at past entries and saw that it should be added to the
Category "Notable Fixes". 

I am copy/pasting the Google Spreadsheet with the bug fixes of the devs
to the respective categories with some Help of Regexp replace and
markdown. 

See
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.6.0/#bug-fixes-by-alessandro-pasotti
as an example.

Please keep in mind that to move the changelog to (clean/translatable)
rst these tables are hard to handle and a lot to translate.

I understand it is nice to show what people did, but if it affects the
easy building/maintaining of the website, I'd leave it.

I'll do a test now, to see if it works (export to rst, move into website
etc). If it works, cool.

Another options is to NOT move the changelog rst to the website anymore
but keep pointing to the projecta site (and not translate the changelog
anymore).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Nyall

You may be interested in some work already done for running qgis processing algorithms at server side with no gui and direct calls to "createAlgorithms":

https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps <https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps>

Development of embedding the processing machinery has raised some interesting questions about using processing in stand alone programs.

Hi Richard, 

Sorry for causing trouble with the tables. 

I think we can point directly to Projecta for the bug fixes. There is no
point in translating bug titles (noone would do it anyway). 

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Richard, 

When is the deadline with the copying of the changelog? 

Have to do some "real work" for my employer now, but will continue
tonight. Still good or too late?

Hi

Thank you very much, Jürgen. I can already see the strings in Transifex.
Nice!
Could that be backported to 3.4 LTR, please? We'd like to translate them,
easier for QGIS promotion in some administrations.

Thanks again,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WFS DescribeFeatureType Compliance question
Message-ID: <c9c314a79b2e876fc161dfa764a1a8e7@carto.net>

Hi, 

We are trying to connect Geomedia Desktop 2018 to our QGIS 3.6 WFS
Server - but fail. 

Geomedia complains about the extra "alias" attributes in the
DescribeFeatureType response: 

See also our temporary URL: 

http://linnode3.geo.zg.ch:8080/ows/Gewaessernetz?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=DescribeFeatureType


Questions: 

 	* Is the "alias" element valid or invalid according to the WFS spec?
 	* If yes, could we move the alias attribute to our own qgs namespace?
 	* What side-effects would such a change have? Which clients are using
the "alias" information?

Thanks, 

Andreas

Just a follow up: several developers are interested, we are discussing
about details and we'll come out with a proposal. Please add your
comments if interested.

Hi Martin,

not sure if this is helpfull, but Matthijs of the OpenGeoGroep.nl
created a hidpi tilecache for mac users not so long ago for an Dutch,
osm based base map. I asked him what he did.  He says (translated):

"Yes we serve two versions, eg"

http://www.openbasiskaart.nl/mapcache/wmts/?SERVICE=WMTS&REQUEST=GetTile&VERSION=1.0.0&LAYER=osm-nb&STYLE=default&TILEMATRIXSET=rd&TILEMATRIX=5&TILEROW=16&TILECOL=15&FORMAT=image%2Fpng

http://www.openbasiskaart.nl/mapcache/wmts/?SERVICE=WMTS&REQUEST=GetTile&VERSION=1.0.0&LAYER=osm-nb-hq&STYLE=default&TILEMATRIXSET=rd-hq&TILEMATRIX=5&TILEROW=16&TILECOL=15&FORMAT=image%2Fpng

"Only the tileing protocol metadata is not really prepeared for HQ
tiles. I now set it up i a way that for HiDPI tiles you have use the
same TILEMATRIX, TILEROW en TILEROW, but you receive either a 256x256
tile or a 512x512 tile depending on the TILEMATRIXSET. But you have to
fool the tile server a little, so if you use current URL
(http://www.openbasiskaart.nl/mapcache and layer with HQ in QGIS) you
get big labels."

Maybe you can use the service to check/test?
(note hq is only in EPSG:28992)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes, that's correct - print output would be affected too. That means
that tiles from a regular XYZ service would be scaled up. Now this is
something I am not 100% sure about how this should work. On one hand
scaling tiles up is useful with tile layers containing labels (they
will have the same size as on the screen), on the other hand for some
tiles this may not be desired (scaling them up would just reduce their
resolution).

I am wondering if we should have three options for tile resolutions:
- standard (96 DPI) ... autoscaled, for 256x256 tiles for XYZ tiles
- high res (192 DPI) ... autoscaled, for 512x512 tiles for XYZ tiles
- undefined ... not scaled

This should hopefully handle all the cases. I am not sure though which
option should be the default. For compatibility reasons (not to break
existing behavior of QGIS) probably it would be good to have
"undefined" as the default with no scaling of tiles on screen nor for
print. Only when deliberately switched to standard / high res
resolution we would apply scaling.

Thanks for the pointer to those commits! There seems to be a mix of
behaviors with somewhat arbitrary threshold of 225 DPI (I guess
assuming screens are < 225 while printing uses > 225). If I read the
code correctly, for screens it would not apply any scaling, but for
print it would scale tiles up. Not sure why the logic is designed this
way...

Cheers
Martin

It is invalid. The schema returned by the above requst doesn't validate 
against the XML schema of XML schema :-) from
https://www.w3.org/2009/XMLSchema/XMLSchema.xsd

>  	* If yes, could we move the alias attribute to our own qgs namespace?

Yes, using qgsextension:alias would validate XMLSchema.xsd as it has a 
provision for extra attributes in another namespaces.
That doesn't mean that Geomedia would be ready for it though. Depends on how 
it is coded...

Thanks for this - good to have also a WMTS service for testing. HQ
tiles look nice and crisp compared to the standard version :-)

Yeah if I am not wrong that's the limitation of WMTS protocol - it
does not tell you the true DPI (you _should_ assume 90 DPI according
to the standard). For a WMTS offering mixed bag of tile resolutions I
am not sure what would be the best solution - a single DPI setting for
the whole connection won't work well - you would need two
connections... one for normal-res tiles, the other for high-res tiles.
Another solution could be per tileset configuration of true DPI, but
that would be even more complicated...

Sounds reasonable.

I can see the following options for what a data provider can offer:

  * A predefined set of available DPI from the server (e.g. XYZ)

  * Manually specify DPI (e.g. as WMS parameter "DPI=300")

  * No scaling available

Some dataproviders might know what they can offer (WMS might include
that in the GetCapabilities, AFS maybe?), others might need
configuration on layer / data provider properties (XYZ, preconfigured
through QMS or ,qml/.qlr files).


I assume that it's also not always desired to get the maximum resolution.

E.g. in HighRes atlas printing a WMS via a network connection with
"DPI=3000" parameter could be very slow, so the API should be prepared
to specify

 * "data source DPI", i.e. what's requested from the provider

 * and output device DPI, i.e. what it's scaled to for screen/paper

Yes, that sounds like the safest approach.

Hi Even, 

We tried to add the qgs namespace as a prefix: 

qgs:alias 

in the DescribeFeatureType response. 

Unfortunately it didn't make Geomedia happy. But as you said - that
depends how it is coded. 

I also asked them what we should do with the alias attribute. Let's see
what they respond. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

We use the qgis2 server for several purposes. So IF a lot of people are
viewing/using plugins or qgis site, and we are building
docs/website/packages it get's crowded.

To fix this we could rent another server, or move the plugins dir to
another existing server (like the issue tracker (qgis3) or test server
(qgis4)) Another server is another 600 dollar per year

I wonder if spinning up an AWS for the heavy duty tasks (and switch it off
when done) would be the right thing to do here.

Thanks Richard for the explanation. I would expect the load will only
increase over time.
The investment seems reasonable to me. Are there alternatives, like
moving some of the heavy load to a public, free-as-beer service?
All the best.

The new osgeo server (osgeo7) is container compatible if QGIS would like
to deploy something there. The main osgeo download site will be moving
there shortly with significantly increased disk space.

Also a good time to review caching implementations.

As far as build loads, there are plenty of services to consider for
offloading some of that work, starting at free or possibly incurring
some cost, but probably less than renting a whole server.

Enjoy,
Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pyrcc5 is not installed ,
 pyuic4 is not in the path and other errors trying to build a plugin
 framework
Message-ID: <CAKsEmwp83Cnq4x3BV9FEBx=92EKL3xJQRCBj90FZTzy34+ngTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I've installed QGis desktop 3.6.0 from the OSGeo4w web installer on my
windows 10 machine. This most recent time with a default express-install. I
tried various things before on a different win7 machine and I thought maybe
a completely fresh install on a newer computer would work better, so this
was all the first time install on this machine.

Once I install and run the plugin "Plugin Builder3" , fill out the dialogs
then press "generate" to get a basic plugin framework made for me, I get
the error: "The resource compiler pyrcc5 was not found in your path. You'll
have to manually compile the resources.qrc file with pyrcc5 before
installing your plugin."

I saw a stackexchange question that seems to solve this problem,
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/273552/pyrcc5-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command
Run some bat files to get the right directories added to the path. That
seems to allow me to build the resource as a one off.

I believe the next step is to deploy using pb_tool. I don't have that, so I
installed pb_tool from the OSGeo4w shell with, "pip install pb_tool"
but then I get errors when running "pb_tool deploy" in my plugin directory,
"pyuic4 is not in your path---unable to compile your ui files pyrcc4 is not
in your path---unable to compile your resource file(s)"

Seems like a path issue again, so I run the bat files from the
stackexchange answer to add them again in my osgeo4w shell, then I get this:
C:\MyFiles\Medina\Generated_Plugin_Code\topology_edit>pb_tool deploy File
"C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python37\lib\site.py", line 177 file=sys.stderr)

which seems very odd to me. I don't think I should try to solve syntax
errors in teh python scripts. I feel like I must be doing something wrong
here, or there is a bug in the install that doesn't include these things
automatically, I assume the idea would be to have all the tools needed
installed by default.

I can get the plugin deployed by manually building the resources with the
stackexchange  bat file advice, then manually copy it to the plugin
directory, but I thought I would report my experience in case there was an
easy way that allows me to use pb_tool and automate that.
Cheers,

Right.

As mentioned in my earlier email, WMS, WMTS, XYZ have no way to tell
the true DPI of tiles (as far as I know). AMS does but QGIS does not
take it into account.

To specify output device DPI there's already
QgsRasterDataProvider::setDpi() call which is also used when drawing
raster layers.

I am not sure how do you mean it with specification of "data source
DPI" ... if I have a tileset with 96 DPI, do you mean that option
should allow overriding of the source DPI?

In any case, here's my take on fixing three problems in one go:
- correct rendering of XYZ tiles on high res screen (and in print output)
- correct rendering of high resolution XYZ tiles (on any screen)
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9296

The PR does not address scaling issues with WMTS layers. Compared to
XYZ layers where one connection = one tile layer, with WMTS there may
be multiple tile layers within one connection, each with different DPI
- and as mentioned above, WMTS does not provide information about DPI.

Cheers
Martin

I'm still seeing issues. From what I can tell, the Expression generator
appears to be correctly reading the @atlas_feature variable now, and in
fact most references in the Reports are working correctly. However, my
attribute tables are still empty on the Reports page. I'll file a bug
report to see if we can get to the bottom of it.

Or  we can just deploy on a smaller dedicated server - should cost any where near so much and we can isolate the services better.

Looking deeper, I realized even unfiltered attribute tables aren't showing
up for me. I can show column names, but no rows are displayed. Can anyone
else confirm?

Seems this bugfix has not been backported to 3.4.x yet (see pull request 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9306).

this is also a possibility, although this means administering another

Better have a general discussion about infrastructure in Coruña.

I was playing with this yesterday, provided you don't care about python2
you can add

call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\o4w_env.bat" call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qt5_env.bat"
call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\py3_env.bat" #make this apply to your user
set PATH=%PATH%;D:\PhotonUser\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\

to the osgeo4w.bat file and all works fine

What I wanted to say is mostly that the API should be prepared for that
(or at least not prevent it) if possible, so AMS can be improved or an
enhanced WMS version can communicate what they offer natively.

Hmm... I see the docstring that says output device. How does it work
that the provider can hold the output device DPI, when the same provider
will be used for printing and screen rendering? I was assuming that the
output device DPI will be specified per request / rendering context. Or
maybe I have a different understanding of what output device DPI means?

Yes, at least for all data sources that do not natively support
reporting the real DPI (so for most if I understand you correctly).

For those sources, 96 is just a guess (even though a quite common and
probable one).

E.g. it could be interesting to use file based tiled layers with
pyramids holding different levels of generalization rendered for HiDPI
as basemaps which need to be scaled down on screens with 96 DPI.

That looks like a good improvement, isolated to WMS, XYZ providers and
not affecting any public API from what I can see.

I just realized that we didn't try removing the attribute to see if that

The "trick" is that when rendering rasters, the provider gets copied
(equivalent of copying feature sources of vector layers) to make sure
we will have a local copy for rendering in background. DPI is set in
QgsRasterLayerRenderer before the provider is copied, so for each map
render we have the correct DPI stored in local provider copy. I am not
saying I like this approach - ideally DPI should be a part of block
request - but this already works so probably it's something to address
in QGIS 4 API.

With my PR I believe this should work correctly with XYZ layers: if
both source and output DPIs are defined, the "best" tile resolution is
adjusted based on their ratio.

Thanks. That PR does not affect WMS at all. It only affects XYZ and it
prepares ground for WMTS (for it we need a mechanism to set DPI for
WMTS tilelesets).

Hi,

Currently there's also the "Require branches to be up to date before
merging" option activated.

I think this option is quite painful because it requires travis to rerun
all the time which takes a lot of time, introduces many merge commits
and at the same time adds very little protection (I'm not aware of a
single pull request where it would have been useful. Ever.).

Any objections to disabling this option?

Matthias

Right -- use cases like this are actually one of the main motivations
behind the standalone executable!

The way I see it, benefits of using a standalone executable called via
subprocess (vs direct use of the PyQGIS API) for tools like
py-qgis-wps are:
- safer: less risk of the processing subprocess crashing and bringing
down the whole server process with it
- easier to use: no need to worry about the process of initializing
qgis and processing manually - this is all taken care of for you.
- works correctly with plugins, without the complexity of manually handling this
- easier to multithread without incurring Python GIL locks
