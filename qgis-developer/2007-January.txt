It is known problem, db driver is exe and when it is started by spawnl()
it opens Windows console for a while. I am not Win expert and I dont know
how to avoid this. I have asked already in QGIS and GRASS devel lists.

Some i.* modules which depend on GRASS monitor must be
impemented in QGIS in future. No solution for now.

*every module*

Any ideas what can be causing that?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] extremely slow rendering rasters
Message-ID: <4599513E.7070802@o2.pl>

Hi,

QGIS (0.8 SVN 2007.01.01) renders rasters extremely slow at high zoom
levels.

Take for example this raster
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/attachment/ticket/475/10res.tif

It is only 64 cells, but at a zoom level circa 1:60 panning get's
painfully slow. At 1:10 it gets impossible. On a 1,86 MHz ATI X700 laptop.

Can anybody reproduce it? Maybe it is just my setup... If it is not
only me, is the defect in QT or QGIS, and could it be fixed if the latter?

Cheers,
Maciek

Tim,

The gps provider dll is not present, which is probably the cause of 
ticket 469 (https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/469).

Maciek,

This is due to a deficiency in GDAL.

Qgis uses the RasterIO function in GDAL to take the data in a raster 
file and scale it to display on the map canvas. However RasterIO only 
accepts integer indices into the raster file data. This means that when 
one zooms in enough that qgis is just displaying a very small part of a 
single cell, it has to ask RasterIO to expand up the entire cell (i.e., 
it is not possible to ask for a part of a cell).

This can result in very large images (I easily got images of 10,000 by 
10,000 pixels), even though qgis is only displaying a small part of 
that. If you zoom in enough you'll eventually run out of memory and qgis 
will crash.

Somewhat ironically, but in line with the above explanation, if you use 
a raster file with a higher resolution, this problem will reduce. 
Similarly, if you zoom in on a single cell rather than where four cells 
meet, the problem will take more time to appear.

I can think of some enhancements to qgis that would improve the 
situation, and will have a go at them in the next week or two.

Gavin

python wasn't used because of missing findutils (locate). No trying to add
python support a problem appears, maybe someone has an idea?

I cannot get that message with
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup.exe
(02-Jan-2007 06:29   44M).

No idea, very strange. It was always working. The message means that
parameter 'output' is missing in the XML description of GRASS module
written out by a module run with --interface-description option.
 You could try to run a module (in shell) with that option and check if
the 'output' option  tag is in XML printed on stdout.

Hi

Yes thats a new build you tested with. I uploaded it I went to sleep
at 4am this morning. I was going to write a message when I woke up
saying the problem was fixed but looks like you beat me to it ! :-P
The version you have downloaded also has GRASS built with postgres
support. I was not able to test pg support at home - can someone give
it a try?

I'm hoping the version I uploaded last night

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_setup.exe

fixes all remaining issues so everyone interested in the Win build
please download it and test it out. Please note that the installer
offers to download sample data for you but you will need to manually
unzip the data in you Quantum GIS/SampleData dir since I couldnt yet
get NSIS to automate that.

I hope to put this version online on the main qgis 0.8 release page
later today so any issues found after that will have to get resolved
in a follow up bug fix release. I will also upload the msys
environment which contains everything you need to build grass for
windows msys later today.

Regards

Tim

Hi,
please don't forget to apply Release-0_8_0 branch bugfixes also to
SVN trunk. For example https://svn.qgis.org/trac/changeset/6361
should also be applied to trunc IMO, right?

BTW, I am right that Release-0_8_0 branch is in fact a release branch
for all 0.8.x releases, not just 0.8.0?

Hi Yes I will be merging these back to trunk too.

Yes I believe that is correct - we will tag 0.8.1 etc off the 0.8
branch. Once Martins merge takes place trunk will be unstable again
:-(

Hi Niccolo

Many thanks for your updates. I have committed them to svn with a small change:

Note I have made some changes to Niccolo's patch to allow building on
ubuntu edgy. In particular I have lowered the gdal min version to
1.3.1 since 1.3.2 is not available in edgy                 universe.

Obviously this is not ideal since gdal 1.3.2 is needed for certain
editing functions etc. However I prefer to make packages that are
compatible with stuff in official ubuntu repos rather than making them
mess around in their apt sources.list. By making this change the same
debian/ dir can be used to build packages for both edgy and etch.

Regards

Tim

Hi

For those interested, I have uploaded the complete msys environemnt
that Tisham Dhar and myself set up here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.gz

Its around 230mb since I have not run make clean in the source dirs
and stripped away unneeeded stuff. However it contains a complete
build environment for making grass (along with numerous other FOSS GIS
stuff) under msys / windows. The GRASS in there is an anonynous
checkout from head and a cvs client is included in teh msys so you can
cvs update grass from in the msys shell.

Regards

Tim

The i386 qgsrasterlayer.cpp code somehow did not make it into the 
binary. libqgis_raster.1.0.0.dylib is universal but qgsrasterlayer.o is 
not! The link should have failed due to missing input. Note below that 
the ppc code size is 5x the i386 code size.

I will recompile qgsrasterlayer.cpp and send you a pointer for i386

Hi Radim and Tim,

If the db driver is compiled with mingw gcc and you have the possibility to 
recompile it yourself, you may use the linker option -mwindows. I don't know 
of other possibilities to avoid the console (but I am no win expert too).

Hi

For me everthing is working fine. I just downloaded the version on the
download site on s different machine and it loads various data files
without problems.

Does anyone else have problems? Leonardo can yu give precise steps to
replicate teh issue?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Packaging Qgis for Debian, help understanding
Message-ID: <20070105104717.GA19991@rigacci.org>

The qgis Debian package depends upon libqgis0 (both packages from 
the same source).The dependency resulted to be strict on the same 
version, at least in the current release.

Unfortunately the package built by me, declares just a generic 
depends upon libqgis0, unversioned. In the control file there is:

  Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

So I think that the actual dependencies are deducted at 
packaging-time by dpkg-buildpackage.

Is it possible to impose the dependency upon the same version 
number without declaring it explicitly?


The bottom line could be: do you have some reading to suggest, 
about control file for a Debian multipackage?

Thanks!

Thanks Marco!
-mwindows helped, attached is patch for Grass.make.in
and dbf driver Makefile. Similar change must be done in
Makefiles of all drivers. configure must be run because
Grass.make.in is source for Grass.make

It would be nice if this patch or something similar could be applied
to GRASS CVS head and 6.2 release branch.

Tim can you patch your GRASS in MSYS and create a new build?
We dont have to wait for 0.8.1 IMO because it does not include
changes in QGIS, it is just a new binary build.

Hi Radim

I can make another build but probably not until monday. If the patches
go into grass cvs that will be great cause then I can just update &
build.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac style linux bundle for qgis
Message-ID: <d368056f0701051919s22974b54n8dfd687c5792741e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

As you may realise, packaging qgis for all the different linux distros
is a near impossible task. Additionally we have the issue of older
distros not haveing qt 4.2.x and many IT depts probably wont be keen
to start deploying new versions of distros to meet qgis dependencies.
When I was promoting the move to qt4 I promised to build a staticly
compiled version of qgis or something to provide an option for folks
with no Qt4 on their machines. Compiling statically has some issues
though - it requires tweaking the build system and it can create very
large binaries.

So I've been looking at using an approach similar to MacOSX
application bundles and Frank Warmerdams FWTools. My first effort
worked only on new distros like Ubuntu Edgy. Today I rebuilt using
Ubuntu dapper as a basis and got it working. I tested ont a slax and
ubuntu dapper live cds and Aaron Racicot has tested it on Fedora Core
6.

I would like to invite more people to test. My hope is that it will
work on all the linux distros in general use. I have not yet packaged
grass into it - Ill probably do that on monday. If you are able to
test please reply to this with a one liner email in the format:

Distro, Version, Works/Partially Works/Doesnt Work. e.g.

Ubuntu, Dapper, Works
Fedora Core, 6, Works

In the case of Partial and Doesnt Work please add any diagnostics you
can to explain the issues encountered.

The test bundle can be downloaded here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/qgis_linux_bundle.tar.bz2

The download is around 55mb. Once the bundle is completed (grass
support added), I will probably package it up using a windows style
installation wizard using BitRock.

Many thanks for any help testing  this.

Regards

Tim

Hi all.

We have created QGIS Press Centre pages on QGIS Wiki with the intention
to organize better translation and distribution of QGIS press releases,
especially stable release announcements.
The idea is that all press releases and translations are in the same place
and we have good overview of current state of translations.
Similarly a list of journals, mailing lists etc. where the
announcements are sent
is maintained on another wiki page.

We need help with translations and maintenance of the list of journals
and mailing lists
where the announcements should be sent. At this moment we need especially
to translate 0.8.0 stable release announcement and initially fill the
list of journals.

Press releases: http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Press_Releases
Journals: http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Journals

I hope you can help us, thank you

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Merge of refactoring branch
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0701061708t7ae71714l1883edfe89140a02@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

today I've ported all commits from trunk to Lib-refactoring branch, so
it gets ready to be merged back to SVN. I'd like to ask you if you
won't mind to merge it tomorrow.

Notes regarding the status of the branch:

= Build system =

To build it, you will need CMake (version 2.4 or preferably later). It
has been tested and builds and runs well under Linux and Windows. I
have no access to Mac, so I couldn't test there. I'm all for using
CMake as the only make system as it's universal, flexible and easy to
understand.

Thus I also suggest removing autotools and qmake files as they are not
needed anymore and might confuse people. As not much people know CMake
so far, we could make a wrapper 'configure' script that will help
users with the transition.

= API Changes =

Nearly all work in the branch has been focused on improving QGIS API.
I'm not going to list all changes here (as the list is quite long),
they're briefly listed this wiki page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Splitting_Into_Libraries
(gives also introduction how to build with CMake)

= New features =

Probably the only new features are addition of Python bindings,
support for Python plugins and addition of spatial index to QGIS API
(not yet used by providers).

= Stability =

This branch has in comparison with trunk some additional bugs, some of
them I'm aware (just didn't have time to fix them so far) and for sure
there are new problems caused by the great amount of changes. There
are some bugs related to removing very tight connections between map
layers, legend, attribute table and map canvas.

Recently we've discussed development cycle for QGIS. The conclusion
was: let's develop new features in branch and merge once it's stable.
I must say that this merge will violate this rule a bit. The reason of
merging now is that maintaining this branch is quite time-consuming
due many API changes. This branch lives many months already and has
been receiving from trunk mostly bugfixes - porting new features would
be absolute time killer.

= Future =

Refactoring of QGIS API is by no means complete for me, but the
biggest changes have been done already. It would be great if we
improved the API further - because also adding new features and
bugfixing will be easier. Here are the places where I see much
potential for improving:
- raster layers support - QgsRasterLayer should be definitely
refactored and we should develop good raster data provider interface
- vector layers support - splitting QgsVectorLayer to presentation and
data class, filtering, caching and indexing for data providers,
support for variant types in attributes, manipulation with geometries

I'd like to see 0.9 version as release with polished API rather than
with many new features. In my opinion QGIS code base is getting bigger
and bigger - without maintenance of old code will be adding new
features a nightmare instead of fun.


Please share your opinions :-)
Thus if noone objects I'll proceed with the merge.

A rather technical question: in IRC logs I've seen a mention of a
utility called svnmerge.py - I'm wondering whether it could be helpful
with such a great merge... any ideas what are the benefits to using
just "svn merge" ?

Regards,
Martin

I spent some time trying to get a cmake based build working with Visual  
C++ Express before realising that this branch did more or less the same  
thing (only better). The prospect of this being merged to trunk is bigger  
news for me than the 0.8 release... I'll be able to get back to my wee

I'm in favor of merging sooner rather than later but am concerned about 
the new build process.

If CMake is required, I'd like to hear the experience of some other 
developers using CMake and the Lib-refactoring branch. A new build 
process should be tested by several people on several machines before 
being rolled out.

I haven't used either CMake or the branch before so I downloaded both. A 
clean download doesn't build. In src/app, qgsmapserverexport.cpp doesn't 
compile due to a missing ui_qgsmapserverexportbase.h. My guess is that 
qgsmapserverexport.cpp doesn't belong here. Removing it caused the build 
to continue and the link succeeded. The right solution might be 
something else however.

The next issue is that qgsconfig.h is being constantly regenerated and 
the whole compilation restarting from the beginning. Initially, there is 
probably going to be a variety of build adjustments and it shouldn't be 
necessary to rebuild everything to do these. The autotool build knew 
enough not to rewrite files unnecessarily.

There are several Mac-specific issues.

1. In the autotool build, PREFIX was not defined for the Mac. The intent 
is to have a compile-time error if PREFIX occurs in code used by a Mac. 
How can PREFIX be removed from qgsconfig.h for the Mac?

2. On a Mac, Qt3Support requires QtSql. CMake doesn't figure this 
dependency out for itself. I was able to complete the build by editing 
two dozen generated files. What is the right way to handle this?

3. Main programs attempt to link against libutil which doesn't exist on 
a Mac. Again, I edited three generated files but it needs to be removed 
some other way.

4. The plugins are built as libraries (.dylib) rather then plugins (.so).

5. Is there a way to specify a search path for finding dependent 
libraries? I have multiple versions of libraries and the build process 
selected an incompatible set from a variety of locations. I had to edit 
all but one library path before I could build. For whatever reason, 
/usr/local, which has a complete and consistent set of libraries, was 
the least favorite place to search.

For many of these issues, I need to learn CMake and conditionalize the 
build process. The Mac problems shouldn't be a cause for delaying the 
merge but it would be good to hear that the new build works on a few 
developers' machines before moving forward.

Another possibility may be to do the merge now, temporarily update the 
autotool files to match the new directory structure and use the two 
build systems in parallel for a few weeks before retiring the autotool 
system.

I have never used CMake before.
I installed it and got the compilation going in less than 1 hour, 
including configuration.
After a couple of more hours I manage to add autodetect of postgres and 
gdal with the help of *-config binaries.
I never understood the old auto-stuff.

Of course, this was on Kunbuntu Edgy, which is probably much easier than 
Mac or Windows.

I'm all for merging, as I like the work being done on projections/SRS.

as far as I can tell, some devs have built it successfully since I've
assisted them with initial problems.

This must be caused from yesterday's porting from trunk -
qgsmapserverexportbase.ui has been removed from Makefile.am so I've
removed it also from CMakeLists.txt, but haven't tried clean install.
The right way is not to build qgsmapserverexport.cpp too as it's not
being used anymore. I'll fix it.

qgsconfig.h should be regenerated only during configure. Does it mean
that every time you try to compile it builds all source files again?
Maybe the problem is with writing qgssvnversion.h ?

It shouldn't be a problem to #ifdef PREFIX in qgsconfig.h.in so it
won't be defined.

This might be fixed by adding this to CMakeLists.txt in root directory:
IF (APPLE)
  SET (QT_USE_QTSQL TRUE)
ENDIF (APPLE)
However this should be handled correctly by the FindQt4 macro from
CMake, so it might be worth reporting that.

Here I don't have any idea what's wrong :-/
Is that CMake which adds libutil for the executables automatically or
does one of these variables specify it?
QT_LIBRARIES
PROJ_LIBRARY
SQLITE3_LIBRARY
GEOS_LIBRARY
GDAL_LIBRARY

> 4. The plugins are built as libraries (.dylib) rather then plugins (.so).

I don't understend well Mac libraries, but I guess this might be fixed
by setting second argument of ADD_LIBRARY() to MODULE instead of
SHARED for the plugins and providers.

This is possible - in cmake/ directory there are several files for
detecting dependency libraries. In FIND_PATH and FIND_LIBRARY commands
you can set preffered order of search. Looking at them I see that /usr
and /usr/local paths are in wrong order - first should be /usr/local
...
I can fix that...

I'm not a fan of the idea to leave (althogh just temporarily) both
build systems at the same time - IMHO it will just shift fixing build
issues to a later time as people will still try to use autotools...

I guess I didn't catch that with the merge CMake will be required. We  
need to consider this change carefully as it has not been tested on  
the Mac and Windows platforms. Unfortunately QGIS is not a "Linux"  
program anymore. Small changes in the code/build system on Linux can  
severely break things on the other platforms.

Our hope (well at least mine) was to get the next release out  
quickly. With the 0.7 and 0.8 series we have suffered delays due to  
major refactoring, projection support, and move to Qt 4. I hate to  
see the move to CMake force us to expend excessive energy on the  
build system to make it work on all flavors of Linux, *BSD, Mac, and  
Windows.

Perhaps this is not the case. I know that the Windows build relies on  
qmake and is just now working. With the merge we could end up with  
three build systems to maintain. Support for Mac and Windows has to  
be considered upfront, rather than an afterthought as we have  
sometimes treated it in the past.

Hi Gary,

probably you haven't read thoroughly my original post - I've mentioned
there that building on Windows works well. (I've been using Tim's MSYS
environment with success.)

In my opinion changing the build system won't delay the release. After
fixing Mac issues I don't see any serious issues with it. The
difference from 0.7 and 0.8 delays is that it's already done (and
needs only fixes).

My idea from the beginning was to have only one build system: CMake.
Autotools is complicated (IMHO) and build with qmake has also problems
(no configuration, providers can't have signals/slots, need of some
file changes).

The fact that CMake can also generate solution and project files for  
Visual Studio is very useful...

Hi all.
Sorry for my ignorance: how do I choose the install options with Cmake?
I normally use:
./autogen.sh --with-qtdir=/usr/share/qt4
- --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.2.1 --with-python --with-wfs
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
it's briefly described on wiki (section Building with CMake):
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Splitting_Into_Libraries

you can use 'ccmake' program for tweaking the parameter or you can use
something like:
cmake -DVARIABLE1=value1 -DVARIABLE2=value2
to specify the parameters from command line.

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that after many months all the changes from
refactoring branch were merged to SVN trunk (revision 6415).

As mentioned in previous thread, you should use new build system based
on CMake. That means that first of all you need it on your system -
version 2.4.3 or later is required. The only dependency of CMake is
C++ compiler so you don't have to worry about its dependencies.

(don't try to use 'configure' or 'autogen.sh' scripts - autotools
support is currently broken)

The preferred way how to compile it:

1. configuration: cmake allows keep all build-specific files in a
separate directory. You can use e.g. directory called 'build' and run
cmake there.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

If you have luck, cmake will detect everything for you. Otherwise
you'll need to run configuration utility.
- ccmake on linux/unix
- cmakesetup on windows
You have to pass it a directory as an argument where it should
operate. So if you're in the 'build' directory, just use: cmake .

There are several variables to tweak in configuration utility, you
might be especially interested in these ones:
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - where to install it
- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - whether to build Release or Debug version

When everything is configured, just use make and make install as usually.

To run QGIS, probably you'll need to set path to the qgis libraries, e.g.:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/wonder/qgis/lib

These instructions should suffice for basic setup - build system is
not yet fully mature so you maybe hit some problems. Please report
them to this mailing list and we'll try to help you.

Regards,
Martin

Thank you for the reorganization and new features.

As mentioned in other posts, the new CMake build systems requires 
additional work to run on a Mac.

Since CMake is new to me, I am going to attempt to fix the autotool 
files for Mac only. I may decide otherwise after trying but my current 
feeling is I can have a running Mac application in a day or two by using 
autotools whereas it will take at least two weeks to both learn CMake 
and sort through all the Mac issues.

If I have a running Mac application and can address CMake issues using 
about a quarter of my qgis time, I will probably make the transition 
over a month or two. From my perspective, autotools and CMake are 
somewhat equivalent. CMake seems easier to learn however I already know 
the autotools and the qgis autotool files contain a lot of Mac 
customization whereas I don't know CMake and the qgis CMake files don't 
contain the Mac customizations already in the old files.

Thus my preference is to learn CMake in parallel with other qgis work 
rather than hastily modifying CMake files, perhaps not even the right 
way, just to get QGIS/Mac building again.

The file ../qgsconfig.h was generated for me when I ran cmake ..

It contains the line:
#define VERSION "0.8.0"

Do you have this file and does it contain VERSION?

Every .o file in build.make seems to be dependent upon flags.make which 
is regenerated whenever I modify CMakeLists.txt. ccache bypasses the 
actual compilation but many files are reprocessed.

This solves the problem.

util was being appended to PYTHON_LIBRARIES in CMakeLists.txt. I changed

I will try MODULE; libtool was using -module. If it doesn't work, I will 
look at what -module expands to and see if I can add it directly to the 
link flags.

I can now build QGIS/Mac but plugins/providers all fail to load.

There is a CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK which defaults to FIRST. 
Setting it to LAST does what I want for now. Eventually, it should be an 
qgis Mac build choice. I have a complete set of libraries in both places 
and might want to use either. My first try however, was behaving as if 
set to RANDOM - not a documented option :)

I can now do a complete compilation but the installation is very 
strange. As I discovered with the CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK variable, CMake 
is doing path substitutions which I need to understand. In a pure Mac 
application, all libraries would be in /Library/Frameworks rather then 
/usr/local/lib. For both finding things and installing things, CMake is 
sometimes using a path as is and sometimes deciding to prepend or 
substitute or append some other Mac path.

It's nice to have the previous build system working so that I can do 
something else for awhile when making no forward progress on the new 
build sstem. I can run qgis/Mac if I manually rearrange the installed 
files so perhaps I won't resurrect the old build files if can get 
plugins to load.

Hi Tom

For interest, are you building with Qt build from source or from the
Qt dmg they introduced this release?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] operators of query builder missing in debian etch
	package
Message-ID: <20070109131040.6b263b55@localhost.localdomain>

Hi, 

I just installed the debian packages from Niccolo. And it seems that the opertor
buttons in the query builder are missing only for debian. They exist in preview
2 on my debian etch laptop and as well under windows and SuSe. 

Any idea why this happens? Do others have the same problem, or am I missing some
packages?

regards,
 Otto

Hi Otto!

I have experienced this problem also in my livecd based on Gentoo.I runned the test taken from the 
ticket related to this issue, and buttons doesn't work:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/252

Yesterday we did some tests with Martin Dobias inside the livecd using qt-designer; we discovered
that if you delete a button and recreate it, then this one is showed.

He says that will recreate all the buttons and let us known how it goes.

Bye
Luca

It looks like you're installing to /usr/local - are you root when
you're doing make install?

Ah yes, I forgot about setting that for python libs...

Thanks for your effort to port the build system also to Mac... with
your latest problems I'm of no help here because of not knowing the
platform. So I can only wish you good luck :-)

In meanwhile I'd like to do some minor improvements to the cmake
system in general ... e.g. detecting grass by checking some dirs
usually used, checking for versions of the dependencies, refine
building and installation of python bindings etc.

I'm using the prebuilt Qt 4.2.2 release.

After installation, I needed to change QT_EDITION_UNKNOWN to 
QT_EDITION_OPENSOURCE in 
/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Headers/qconfig.h to get anything 
to compile.

Before doing --with-qtdir=/usr/local/Qt4.2 in the old build system, I 
needed to add the following links:

ln -s /usr/bin /usr/local/Qt4.2/bin
ln -s /Library/Frameworks /usr/local/Qt4.2/lib

I also changed the following link (it was set to macx-xcode):

ln -sfh macx-g++ /usr/local/Qt4.2/mkspecs/default

Hmmm...
- do you have cmake 2.4.3 or later? (preferable the latest one... 2.4.5)
- does this happen also with a regular directory in when you don't
need to su / sudo?
- isn't something wrong with the source file (does it exist?) or isn't
something wrong with destination directory?

I checked two different Debian boxes, both with an updated Etch 
and my package 0.8.0-2: the buttons are there.

Check if qgis and libqgis0 are of the same version. Here are my 
packages version:

ii  libqgis0                         0.8.0-2
ii  libqgis0-dev                     0.8.0-2
ii  qgis                             0.8.0-2
ii  qgis-plugin-grass                0.8.0-2

ii  libqt4-core                      4.2.1-2
ii  libqt4-dev                       4.2.1-2

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Improved GRASS check
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0701091541m749dbe8cr75320e68d2e3ff7d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

in revision 6419 I've refined a bit the check for GRASS. How does it work now:

- you can specify WITH_GRASS variable - ON or OFF - it's on by default
so you can use it to disable GRASS support explicitly

- you can specify GRASS path using GRASS_PREFIX variable. Besides this
it supports some default paths - for now it's just (K)ubuntu's
/usr/lib/grass ... if you give me a note what directory your distro
uses by default I can add it so it will detected automatically

- check for GRASS now displays the version that has been detected (by
reading grass-prefix/etc/VERSIONNUMBER)

Hi Martin!

Thanks alot for this effort. Building with cmake (2.4.3) works fine  
under Ubuntu Edgy
with apt-installed python, qt4 etc...

But when I apt-install python-dev (2.4.3) python is included in the  
build process, but leads
to an error. the cmake command itself passes fine, but the make  
process fails with the following output:

....[ 65%] Generating qgis_se.qm

Can perhaps somebody give me a hint?

Hi

As far as I know you need SIP and PyQT installed for python bindings
to work. I dont think these are available in apt yet but I could be
wrong. Martin can no doubt provide better details...

They're not available on Debian etch. Compiling them, however, is very 
straightforward.

Hi,

basically python support has two stages in the build system:
- if Python includes and libraries are found, it will build mapserver
export tool
- if also SIP and PyQt4 are found, also python bindings will be built

SIP must be in version 4.5 or later and PyQt4 in version 4.1 or later.
These checks however are not yet in build system. Please check if you
have them in correct versions.

Your error happens during python bindings compilation when sip is
being run - it reports that QtCore/QtCoremod.sip is not found (should
be in /usr/share/sip). Can you check whether it exists?

Thanks Martin.
# aptitude show cmake
Pacchetto: cmake
Versione: 2.4.4-1
The problem turned out to be related to checkinstall (don't know what is 
wrong).
With make install everything ok.
Thanks.

Hi all.
I got the new refactored qgis working (after a few links), but now I get:
Python error
Couldn't load SIP module.
Python support will be disabled.
I have compiled SIP and PyQt (latest versions), and cmake . apparently 
finds it:
-- Python libraries found
-- Python bindings enabled

 From ccmake .

Hi all.
First tests on the refactored qgis: when activating editing on a postgis
layer, the activation checkbox does not work, in  the sense that when
closing the window of layer properties the checkbox deactivates, and the
layer is not editable.
Should we fill a ticket?

Hi Paolo,

there are surely some new bugs, but IMHO it's simply too soon to file
the bugs that are in trunk. I would suggest to start filing bugs for
0.9 release a bit later - around the time when feature freeze will
happen.

However if you'll do some testing and hit several bugs it's good to
report it to qgis-dev list.

This does show up when starting QGIS, right?
Try this:
1. start python interpreter in console
2. type:
from sip import wrapinstance, unwrapinstance

If that will fail, something's wrong with your SIP installation.
Otherwise there's problem with running this check in QGIS.

actually, not that good news :-)

maybe a problem with more python versions?
please check what python version is used in interpreter and what
version of python does QGIS use (in ccmake you'll see PYTHON_LIBRARIES
variable or something similar).

version in python interpreter you can find out as:
import sys
print sys.version_info

Hi Martin.
Thanks for the reply.

ccmake:
 PYTHON_LIBRARY                   /usr/lib/python2.4/config/libpython2.4.so

python
>>> print sys.version_info
(2, 4, 4, 'final', 0)

# aptitude show python2.4
Pacchetto: python2.4
Stato: installato
Versione: 2.4.4-1

So apparently they're all the same?

Just to make sure: are you using cmake to build trunk?

Also please provide some information:
- what's your cmake's version
- what steps have you made when trying to build

Yes, it seems to be okay - I'm quite confused what might be wrong...
Btw. python bindings were built and installed fine?

You can try to recompile them, but I'm not sure whether it will help.
If you'll have still problems, I'll prepare later a simple test
utility to do some checks.

Yes, currently it's broken. Please use CMake instead. You'll find
instructions for building with it just few threads back in qgis-dev
list.

In your case it should look like this:
cmake . -DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs
make && make install

Hi,

for those interested, there's a new CMake release available:

Hi all

QGIS/Mac will now run from the command line when built by CMake if 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the path to the qgis libraries 
(install-prefix/qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/lib).

It is not double-clickable yet because the library paths are not 
contained in the libraries and plugins (hence the need for 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).

When running cmake, some dependencies may be found and recorded as .so. 
Change these to .dylib which is the correct Mac library extension before 
running make.

Tom

Hi

I suspect you dont have the latest version of the mingw environment.
Please try redownloading it and rebuilding. I aslo suggest you get the
qgis 0.8 setup exe and overwrite anything in your
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-release directory with the contents of c:\program
files\quantum gis (after first installing the setup file of course).

Hope that helps

Regards

Hi Tom

Ive been trying to build on mac but its tripping up with:

[  0%] Built target svnversion
[ 10%] Built target ui
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/local/lib/libgdal.so',
needed by `src/core/libqgis_core.dylib'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Any ideas? I was also wondering how to get it to use the gdal from
Williams frameworks rather than the one I have installed in
/usr/local/lib

Regards

Tim

Hi Tom again

I should have better worded my question after re-reading your original
mail: How do you change the  deps that are incorrectly picked up as
.so to .dylib?

Thanks

All my frameworks have a handy symlink folder that can be used like a  
normal unix prefix without knowing anything about frameworks.  It's  
my "unix compatibility" setup.

ie, for GDAL, that would be:

prefix=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix

So, for includes: -I/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/include

and for linking: -L/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/unix/lib -lgdal

as you would expect.

I edit CMakeCache.txt. There's a ccmake editor but the (g) generate 
command disappears every time I modify something. I don't know if it's a 
Mac bug or I just haven't figured out the editor.

The cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK defaults to FIRST. I have a full 
set of libraries in both /usr/local and /Library/Frameworks and it finds 
frameworks over libs for all except gdal.

Since the paths can be changed and are remembered after changing, I 
haven't examined the Find* code yet. Along with fixing Find*, setting 
CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK to LAST should become an initialization option for 
Mac users who have frameworks and want /usr/local to be searched first.

Dear Tim Sutton,

I was installing qt-win-opensource-4.2.2-mingw.exe and using download MinGW
from internet option. It was automatically downloading MinGW-3.4.2.exe from
Qt official server (Sweden). Also I was using msys.tar.gz (269 Mb,
02-Jan-2007).

Tim what's the mean? I mean I want to know behind the scenes of your
suggestion for file overwriting from qgis 0.8 setup exe to
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-release. 

Thanks and best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

Hi Tom (and thanks for the reply Wiliam)

Ok so after following your CMakeCache.txt advice it built, but crashed
when trying to run by clicking the bundle. Did you say the bundle is
not clickable yet?

I attach the log from the crash.

Regards

Tim

It's not double clickable because the app, libraries and plugins can't 
find each other. The binaries do not contain path info. CMake is 
assuming that all libraries will be placed in a standard location.

Some CMake settings controlling paths need to be changed. Until then, 
you can run from the command line if you define:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/lib

Hi devs,

I really like the cmake build system. As it is quite new for me, I have a 
simple question about it:
Is it possible to change the qt location with a single -D? It seems possible 
to 
use -DQT_INCLUDE_DIR -DQT_LIBRARY_DIR -DQT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR -DQT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR 
and so on also for xml, qt3support, network and possible more. But it would 
be handy to have only a single variable pointing to the whole qt location 
(like --with-qtdir in autotools). Is there such a variable?

thanks,
Marco

Hi Marco,

this should be possible by specifying QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE - by
specifying the executable you should be able to change to the other
Qt4 installation - CMake gathers all information from it. To
understand how does it work, see
/usr/share/CMake/Modules/FindQt4.cmake

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0701140341p5529dd7aw4bc745c4afd36880@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

probably you're used to do always 'make' and 'make install' when
developing QGIS. Autotools use rpath for linker so the installed
executable knows where to search for the libs. CMake doesn't do that
normally. Well, it does, but only for build to source directory - when
doing make install it relinks the binaries and doesn't use rpath
anymore, thus you need to specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For more
information why, see:
http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake/2005-November/007490.html

This leads me to the question: why not to run it directly from the
sources? After some modifications I think we could achieve this by
some modifications. Then we could leave out 'make install', resulting
in faster rebuilds.

Martin

Hi All

I must say I really like cmake too and when / if it comes time to vote
on whether we should drop all other build systems (automake and
qmake), I'll be giving it a +1! On the mac with Toms latest commits
its incredibly easy to build and it builds in 8minutes on my macbook!

Regards

Tim

Hi Tom

Just a quick note to say thanks for your latest commits - double
clicking the app works now without needing to specify DYLIB path - and
also my gdal is picked up from the Williams frameworks now. Strangely
enough for gdal it still seems to be looking for headers in
/usr/local/include though. I'm taking my macbook in to the shop next
week to have its dead hard drive, heat damaged palmrest and probably
damaged heat sensors replaced  :-( and Im thinking that when I
reinstall the OS I will try to not put any hand built deps onto the
system and use only Williams frameworks.

Did you have a look at how easy / difficult it will be to copy the
frameworks into the bundle and run otool on the qgis libs using cmake?
It would be great if running make install did the whole kit & kaboodle
for us!

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend menus unification
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0701140541g35c28ba3y58fa4a8b7ddf0c17@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to clean up legend popup menus a bit and unify them with
toolbar actions with the same meaning. In legend we make have "legend
layer" items and "legend layer file" items. One legend layer contains
one or more layer files (with the same symbology). These menus however
are quite different although they shouldn't be.

Handling various actions for a legend layer with only one legend layer
file is simple - all actions like open attribute table, toggle
editing, toggle in overview etc. can be run as usually. But when you
have more layer files in one legend layer, things become a bit
complicated. Displaying attribute table for more layers at once is not
supported, toggling editing and visibility in canvas or overview can
be ambiguous. I see these approaches for legend layer menus:
- disable ambiguous menu items in legend
- use tristate checkboxes for toggle actions

Also it would be good to decide whether to use checkboxes / toggle
toolbar buttons or start+stop buttons for these actions for layers:
- editing
- overview visibility
- canvas visibilty
Currently we use both toggle buttons and start+stop buttons and IMHO
this mixture is not very nice to users...

Please share your opinions.

Bye,
Martin

Hi Martin,

> - disable ambiguous menu items in legend
> - use tristate checkboxes for toggle actions

In my opinion, tristate checkboxes have the advantage that it is still 
possible to enable/disable a property for all layer files in one go, even if 
there are several layer files in one layer.
On the other hand they may cause more confusion to users.

Thus I would favor tristate for visibility (important to toggle for all layer 
files) and disabling for editing and attribute table if there are several 
layer files. I cannot imagine a use case where I want to toggle editing or 
attr. table for more than one layer file at once.

> Also it would be good to decide whether to use checkboxes / toggle

For me,  checkboxes/toggle are more intuitive.

cheers,
Marco

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the hint with the .cmake file. 
Setting QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE works for me, but only when I generate a symlink 
called qmake-qt4 pointint to qmake. It seems as cmake is looking for this 
file (which does not exist when building qt from source).

I don't know how is it in your CMake installation, but in mine (2.4.3)
there is a line (in FindQt4.cmake) like this:
FIND_PROGRAM(QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE NAMES qmake-qt4 qmake PATHS ....)

that means that it first searches for 'qmake-qt4' and if that's not
found it will check for 'qmake' - so both options should work. IIRC in
recent version there were some improvements for qt4 search so maybe it
has changed.

Same here. And if you haven't started editing, the actionboxes for 
editing polygons/lines/points etc should be grayed out. Right no thay 
are instead sett afte the capability of the layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Preview2 tarball cannot be found and other issues
Message-ID: <20070115002218.GB6085@sssup.it>

Hi all,

Qgis-0.8.0-preview2 sources cannot be found on the previous location:
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis_Release-0_8-preview-2.tar.gz
Where can I found pre2 sources, please?

I'm noticing that QGIS-related URIs are breaking too often: since I
maintain ebuilds for Gentoo systems, I need that sources will be
available at any time in the same place and I already fixed the ebuilds
three times (since the release of 0.7.4 version) for unannounced changes
of sources URIs and/or samples tarball. Is it so difficult to maintain a
tidy repository of *all* (or one-year-old to last) QGIS versions also
with a *versioned* samples tarball and linking to that repository for
downloading purposes?  There's no need for a release plan of the samples
tarball, only if someone updates it, also have to increase the version
number (and leave the older tarball public available).

The naming scheme of the tarballs (and the main directory contained in
it) is, at least, strange. Mixed uppercase and lowercase in directories
and files doesn't help, also. I would suggest to KISS (without the last
's'). qgis-Release-0_8-preview-2 may become: qgis-0.8.0-pre2, for
example.

Thanks for the attention and I apologize if I was mean, I know you all
are doing the best for QGIS. Nonetheless, these little things are the
first that a new user will notice and they aren't so pleasant.

Dear Tim and developers

In first of all thanks a lot for your reply on SVN 6410 compile problem. I
was compiling it using your suggested method. 

In today I have trying to compile latest QGIS SVN build using CMAKE

Hi,

as you can see, the default generator for Windows is generator for
visual studio. Thus you need to say explicitly:
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" c:\dev\cpp\qgis.latest
(notice the double quotes to parse it as one argument.

On windows there's nothing like default path for libraries and include
directories - that's the reason why you have to set the paths
explicitly for the dependencies. (However in future we can decide that
c:\msys is our default path for windows build and it will detect
everything automatically as it does on unix.

Good luck,
Martin

Measure tool basically only works reliably when projection is turned on.
Scale bar and measure tool has different way of considering measuring.

I propose a unified measure model, where MapCanvas contain a QgsMeasure 
object which can be used by both measure tool, scale bar and scale 
indication (at the coorindates). I also propose that "map units" will 
direclty follow by projection. If it's a +proj=longlat (such as 2585) it 
will be shown as degrees. If it's a projected ( +proj=utm, etc) it will 
be in meters (or feet).

The projection used to determine scale/measurement will be project 
projection (if turned on) or active layer(???) if off.

I was goping to have a second look at the problme tonite, but as Micha 
brought it up... :-)

This will in that case be implemented in 0.9 only.

Sorry for the cross-mail. I will be on #qgis of a couple of hours.

I'm using QGIS quite often without projection turned on. In this case, the 
result I would expect is just a simple 2D measurement and the units are taken 
from the project properties.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS plugin not working with Geoserver
Message-ID: <8426825.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi all,
a QGIS and Geosever user recently reported me that the QGIS WFS plugin does
not work
with Geoserver.
I've tried it out (0.8 release) and in fact I can confirm that: the WFS
plugin connects
properly (GetCapabilities) but once I try to add a layer, it states the
layer is invalid.
I can see from the Geoserver log it does a DescribeFeatureType request, and
the
answer goes out without problems, so I guess the plugin is not pleased with
the result it gets.

As far as I know Geoserver works properly with various clients, given QGIS
popularity
I would be pleased to have it working properly as well.
Unfortunately I can't find a log or any extra information (no logs I can see
for example),
so I guess we can try to solve the issue the other way, by giving you a
public Geoserver
you can connect to and test, without the need to install Geoserver or Java
on your boxes.
This is the Geoserver instance:
http://sigma.openplans.org:8080/geoserver
and here is its GetCapabilities address:
http://sigma.openplans.org:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetCapabilities

If you have any issue you want to discuss, please don't hesistate to contact
me.
I'm following the list thru Nabble, so please cc me or I may loose the
message.

Cheers
Andrea Aime

Hi Andrea,

I think I tested with geoserver once, but only with a very limited set of 
examples. So your server URLs are a perfect starting point for fixes. I will 
have a look at why it does not work and give you feedback.

cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt 4.2 QDialogButtonBox and
	QMessageBox::StandardButton
Message-ID: <45AF3808.2060801@comcast.net>

Hi all,

Qt 4.2 has introduced some new features to provide better cross-platform 
button placement. For example, on a Mac, an "accept" button is placed to 
the right of a "reject" button whereas on Windows, the reverse is true.

For me (a Mac user), seeing a Cancel or reject button to the right of an 
OK or accept button is like seeing a red light on the bottom of a 
traffic signal. :)

In the coming days, I will be changing all code to use the new API. This 
message provides a brief overview. More datails can be found on the Qt 
4.2 QDialogButtonBox and QMessageBox doc pages.

When using the new StandardButtons API with QMessageBox or placing a 
QDialogButtonBox in dialog layouts, Qt will size and position buttons 
according to the platform. In some cases, even the name is adjusted; for 
example, "Discard" is "Don't Save" on a Mac.

The API uses the StandardButton enum instead of button names in 
parameters. OK, Open and Save are "accept" buttons and Cancel, Close and 
Abort are "reject" buttons. Eighteen buttons are predefined and it is 
also possible to create a custom labeled button, assign it a role and 
then add it to the dialog. The default and escape buttons are also 
selected based upon a button's role.

The old API used a zero based index and looked like this:

int ret = QMessageBox::warning(this, "Title", "Message", "Ok", "Cancel");
if (ret == 0) okAction();

The new API uses an enum and looks like this:

QMessageBox::StandardButton ret = QMessageBox:warning(this, "Title", 
"Message", QMessageBox::Ok | QMessageBox::Cancel);
if (ret == QMessageBox::Ok) okAction();

Buttons in the new API are 'or'ed together rather then listed in 
separate parameters since button order is determined by the platform 
based upon each buttons role.

Will this new API allow translation of the 'OK' and 'Cancel' texts? It
doesn't seem to work today.

The strings are in the QDialogButtonBox section of the file qt_*.ts 
which is provided by Trolltech. Some languages are provided but for 
others, we will have to do the translation.

When I place a qt_*.qm file into the same folder as qgis_*.qm, it works 
for me on a Mac.

Hi,

as you can see, the default generator for Windows is generator for
visual studio. Thus you need to say explicitly:
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" c:\dev\cpp\qgis.latest
(notice the double quotes to parse it as one argument.

On windows there's nothing like default path for libraries and include
directories - that's the reason why you have to set the paths
explicitly for the dependencies. (However in future we can decide that
c:\msys is our default path for windows build and it will detect
everything automatically as it does on unix.

Good luck,
Martin

I've never seen this before. pj_set_finder is a normal function that
should be in proj_api.h hedear. I guess you have it there, but for
sure could you check that? Also take a look if PROJ_INCLUDE_DIR (and
also include dirs for other deps) is set correctly to
c:/msys/local/include

Dear Tim and Martin,

Excuse me for my raw mistake. It was include path problem, now every thing
works fine, now compilation process is OK.

Thank you very much.

Another thing
-----------------

The vector layer editing functionality is not work correctly when I use my
own compiled QGIS. I have trying to edit existing SHP vector file also
creating new vector layer using QGIS. These are either is not work, it was
alerting me please check allow editing etc... Of course I have already
chosen (tick) start editing on my active (working) vector layer. 


With kind regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

I know that some commands stopped working - until it will be fixed,
here's a temporary solution: right click on legend, toggle show file
groups on. open the 'Files' item under the layer you want to edit and
right click the file name. You should get a similar popup menu, but
this one should be working (also displaying attribute table works from
there).

Message-ID: <45B331C0.10407@homann.se>

..there is a hectare (ha), which is 10 000 m2. Wikipedia says:

"The hectare is commonly used in many countries, especially in domains 
concerned with land planning and management such as agriculture, 
forestry, and town planning where the use of square metres would be 
cumbersome and unnecessarily precise."

It's strictly not a SI-unit, but it si exactly equal to a hm2, which is.

I plan to stick it into the area calculations between m2 and km2. 
Anybody against?

Hi,
instructions for compiling 0.8 version are in readme_windows.txt file
in sources. However I would recommend you to download QGIS with
installer (unless you're going to do some development) as it's not
straightforward to compile it on windows.

plugin_builder.pl is just a simple script that creates sources for a
new plugin from template - no reason to use it unless you're
developing a new plugin.

I recommend you to proceed first with downloading the sources and
compiling. Then you should learn how plugins work and how to write
them, take a look on this wiki page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersCorner
There's also section "Help on writing plugins" that you might find interesting.

Note: we don't use windows as a development platforms, so it's
possible that noone will be able to help you with some
windows-specific problems.

Hi,

I no longer manage to compile QGIS SVN HEAD on RHEL/64bit

       *Procedure for setup of a windows build environment for QGIS
                    Tim Sutton and Godofredo Contreras 2006
  With thanks to Tisham Dhar for preparing the initial msys environment*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes the process you need to follow to get QGIS built
directly
under windows (rather than using a cross compiler under linux).Note: The
process for building under windows is still being sorted out so
      check this document regularly for updates.

Msys:
-----
get this:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.bz2
and unpack to c:\msys
The file is compressed using bzip2 - you can get a free windows application
for creating and decompressing files here:

http://www.7-zip.org/

Qt4.2:
------

Download qt4.2 opensource precompiled edition exe and install (including the

download and install of mingw) from here:

http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows

Edit C:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat and add the following line (the second is
only
needed if you like vim in your shell):

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\msys\local\bin;c:\msys\local\lib
set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\Program Files\Vim\vim70\

If you plan to do some debugging, you'll need to complie debug version of
Qt:
C:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat compile_debug


QGIS:
-----
Check out to c:\dev\cpp\qgis:

cd c:\dev\cpp
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis

Currently you need to put it into that location in case you plan to create
the NSIS installer because so far it contains hardcoded paths for this
location.


Source changes:
---------------

Next you need to shift some files around. For convenience we've made an
archive
that handles all the changes for you. Download it and unpack to qgis source
directory:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis-qmake-files.zip

List of what has been changed / added by this archive to enable compilation:

 - moved qgscsexception.h, qgsspatialrefsys* and qgscoordinatetransform*
into core dir from gui
 - moved qgspluginregistry.* from core to gui
 - qgsspatialrefsys.cpp - commented out SRS validation using projection
selector
 - qgsspatialrefsys.cpp - commented out lines using qgsproject as it depends
on gui stuff
 - qgsdistancearea.cpp - commented out lines using qgsproject as it depends
on
   gui stuff and moved to core
 - lexer and parser generated by genlexyacc.bat
 - added custom qgsconfig.h and qgssvnversion.h


Building:
---------

Now open the qt command shell (or start "cmd" and run
c:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat)

cd c:\dev\cpp\qgis
qmake
make

This will compile both debug and release version. To make just a one of them
use "make debug" or "make release" respectively.

Note: debug version uses debug version of Qt library thus if linking fails
on not founding library QtSvgd4 (or similar), you need to compile them
as described in section for Qt.

Running: (optional)
--------

After successfull make you can run QGIS directly from the directory
where it has been built: qgis-debug and/or qgis-release in qgis root dir.
You only need to add data files - we have provided an archive for
convenience
which you can just unpack there and run QGIS:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis_data.zip

Then just run qgis.exe

GDB: (optional)
----

If you plan to do some debugging, download and install gdb-6.3.2.exe from

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/gdb-6.3-2.exe?download

and install to c:\msys\mingw


Create the installation package: (optional)
--------------------------------

Downlad and install NSIS from (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)

Download both the QGIS debug and release installer packages from

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/

and install them. Now copy the installation dirs from C:\Program Files\QGIS*
into
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-debug and c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-release respectively.
After
making these copies uninstall the release and debug versions of QGIS from
your c:\Program Files directories using the provided uninstaller. Double
check
that both dirs are complete gone under program files afterwards.

Now using windows explorer, enter the c:\dev\cpp\qgis\win_build directory
and right
click on qgis.nsi and choose the option 'Compile NSIS Script'. Do the same
for qgis-debug.nsi. Congratulations you should have two installable qgis
setup files in the win_build directory now..



I FOLLOWED THIS METHOD TO SETUP WINDOWS BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR QGIS...BUT

Those two files (and some more) are here:

It's mentioned in the readme, please read it carefully.

Hi Markus,

the variable QT_BINARY_DIR you're passing to CMake doesn't help. The
search for Qt4 starts by searching for qmake (or qmake-qt4) binary,
however QT_BINARY_DIR  is a variable that the search macro sets by
itself. You may be interested to set path directly to qmake binary
which is used by macro to gather all information. Try setting
QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to this file (e.g. /usr/bin/qmake-qt4 for me on
Ubuntu).

It uses also environment variable $QTDIR (not $QT4DIR) to search for qmake.

Hope that helps,
Martin

Hi Martin,

it helped! This works

GRASSBINS=/ssi0/ssi/neteler/grass63/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
QTDIR=/usr/lib64/qt4

mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -D GRASS_PREFIX=${GRASSBINS} -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${QGISTARGET} -D QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=${QTDIR}/bin/qmake-qt4 ..
make
make install


Thanks!

Well, I've got it all to build so far (no GRASS or Python support) using a  
cmake generated Visual Studio solution. I had to tweak a few files in  
qgis_core (tools.cc springs to mind). I also had to tweak one of the  
cmakelists.txt files. Having said that, I've not been able to get it to  
run yet. I could copy all the dlls to one directory by hand but I can't be  
bothered. I'll need to have a look at cmake's install stuff and find some  
way of getting it to set up Visual Studio's dependencies stuff (copy  
dependent dlls to runtime directories and so on). I've also modified the  
win32 icon file so that the .rc file can now be included directly in the  
source file list for building. If anyone's interested, I can attempt to  
put a patch together. Bear in mind though that this is a work in  
progress...

Today I've tried compiling QGIS trunk on windows - with no problems.
I've used "MinGW Makefiles" generator.

Do you have more troubles besides that one compile error in
spatialindex library you've mentioned on IRC?

Hi jaan,

 

What SVN version are you using? The latest SVN or 0.8.0 Release
(https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0_8_0/)? If you were
getting latest (unstable) SVN source then you have to use CMAKE instead of
QMAKE, of course latest SVN must be using CMAKE!

 

Also suggest to you Martin's advice too.

P.S By the way I have two versions of QGIS source codes (R 0.8.0 and latest
SVN) and they are compiled well in windows platform using Tim Sutton's
README_windows.txt (MinGW and bundled MSYS package) and CMAKE.

       Procedure for setup of a windows build environment for QGIS
                    Tim Sutton and Godofredo Contreras 2006
  With thanks to Tisham Dhar for preparing the initial msys environment 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----

This document describes the process you need to follow to get QGIS built
directly
under windows (rather than using a cross compiler under linux).Note: The
process for building under windows is still being sorted out so 
      check this document regularly for updates.

Msys:
-----
get this: 

 <http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.bz2>
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.bz2

and unpack to c:\msys

The file is compressed using bzip2 - you can get a free windows application
for creating and decompressing files here:

 <http://www.7-zip.org/> http://www.7-zip.org/

Qt4.2:
------

Download qt4.2 opensource precompiled edition exe and install (including the

download and install of mingw) from here:

 <http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows>
http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows 

Edit C:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat and add the following line (the second is
only 
needed if you like vim in your shell):

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\msys\local\bin;c:\msys\local\lib
set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\Program Files\Vim\vim70\

If you plan to do some debugging, you'll need to complie debug version of
Qt:
C:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat compile_debug


QGIS:
-----
Check out to c:\dev\cpp\qgis:

cd c:\dev\cpp
svn co  <https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis>
https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis 

Currently you need to put it into that location in case you plan to create
the NSIS installer because so far it contains hardcoded paths for this
location.


Source changes:
---------------

Next you need to shift some files around. For convenience we've made an
archive
that handles all the changes for you. Download it and unpack to qgis source
directory:

 <http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis-qmake-files.zip>
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis-qmake-files.zip

List of what has been changed / added by this archive to enable compilation:

 - moved qgscsexception.h, qgsspatialrefsys* and qgscoordinatetransform*
into core dir from gui
 - moved qgspluginregistry.* from core to gui
 - qgsspatialrefsys.cpp - commented out SRS validation using projection
selector 
 - qgsspatialrefsys.cpp - commented out lines using qgsproject as it depends
on gui stuff
 - qgsdistancearea.cpp - commented out lines using qgsproject as it depends
on 
   gui stuff and moved to core
 - lexer and parser generated by genlexyacc.bat
 - added custom qgsconfig.h and qgssvnversion.h


Building:
---------

Now open the qt command shell (or start "cmd" and run
c:\Qt\4.2.0\bin\qtvars.bat)

cd c:\dev\cpp\qgis
qmake
make

This will compile both debug and release version. To make just a one of them
use "make debug" or "make release" respectively.

Note: debug version uses debug version of Qt library thus if linking fails
on not founding library QtSvgd4 (or similar), you need to compile them
as described in section for Qt.

Running: (optional)
--------

After successfull make you can run QGIS directly from the directory
where it has been built: qgis-debug and/or qgis-release in qgis root dir.
You only need to add data files - we have provided an archive for
convenience 
which you can just unpack there and run QGIS:

 <http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis_data.zip>
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/qgis_data.zip

Then just run qgis.exe

GDB: (optional)
----

If you plan to do some debugging, download and install gdb-6.3.2.exe from 

 <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/gdb-6.3-2.exe?download>
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/gdb-6.3-2.exe?download 

and install to c:\msys\mingw


Create the installation package: (optional)
--------------------------------

Downlad and install NSIS from ( <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page>
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page )

Download both the QGIS debug and release installer packages from 

 <http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/>
http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/

and install them. Now copy the installation dirs from C:\Program Files\QGIS*
into 
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-debug and c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-release respectively.
After
making these copies uninstall the release and debug versions of QGIS from 
your c:\Program Files directories using the provided uninstaller. Double
check
that both dirs are complete gone under program files afterwards.

Now using windows explorer, enter the c:\dev\cpp\qgis\win_build directory
and right 
click on qgis.nsi and choose the option 'Compile NSIS Script'. Do the same 
for qgis-debug.nsi. Congratulations you should have two installable qgis 
setup files in the win_build directory now..

 


I FOLLOWED THIS METHOD TO SETUP WINDOWS BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR QGIS...BUT
ENCOUNTERED WITH SOME PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE...

1.after runnng make---errors due to missing of"qgsconfig.h &qgssvnversion.h"

where i can get it????

 

pls help me.......

Hi Magnus,

Yep, I did it. In my case I have using cmake 2.4.6 within MinGW-5.1.2 and
bundled MSYS (http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.gz) provided by Tim
Sutton.

By the way default configuration of CMakeLists.txt isn't define some
depended libraries paths (lib and include), therefore you should assign it
using cmakesetup tool or manually edit CMakeLists.txt. In personally I
suggest to you using cmakeSetup.exe tool for configuring QGIS.


Best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

Just a small note: yesterday I've added c:\msys\local\include and
c:\msys\local\lib to default search path for dependencies, so if you
have it in this path, it should configure automatically without the
need for manual settings.

I discovered an error: I had the c:\MinGW in mny path, and the 
includefiles ther was different. I should only use c:\msys\mingw.

So, I started make again, but on linking I got the "input line too long" 
error that Martin Dobias talked about on the cmake-list... :-) (I'm on 
Win2K)

Next step was using cygwin as shell (bash) and use "MSYS Makefiles" 
instead. That work for a while, until I got:

In fact I haven't solved this issue. Instead I've only modified
CMakeLists.txt to behave better... Back then, when generating ui_*.h
files from *.ui files, these generated header files were also moc'ed
which was producing additional (useless) files. Later I've corrected
this so less files were to be linked and I got rid of the "input line
too long" problem - on my WinXP. Probably longest input line is
shorter on Win2K.

I guess only workaround is to use MSYS Makefiles - they should compile
things equally.

Hmm... won't adding #include "qgis.h" to qgssymbol.h help? :-)

hi...
Hope u r fine...
let me tell you about my proceedings...
I followed your advice and got success in running make,make install..I am
really thankng you for helping me..

1.installed qgis in c:\programfiles\qunatum gis
2.copied files from c:\programfiles\quantum gis to
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\qgis-release(overwritten).
3.now i can run qgis from qgis-release..

Then i tried for adding plugins by following procedure
1.run perl script c:\dev\cpp\qgis\src\plugins\plugin_builder.pl,created
plugin
2.changed to source directory....executed ./autogen.sh--no errors(as
mentioned in developers plugin in  wiki)

CAN YOU HELP ME????

SORRY for disturbing and am thankful for spending your valuable time for
me....

Here's the problem - autogen.sh can't be used in windows - it won't
work. You have to create your own .pro file for the plugin. Have a
look at other plugins how can it be done. Or as you ask in other mail,
you can even take a working plugin, rename it and change the code.

That's because it isn't compiled. It must be added to Qmake build
system if you want to build it on windows.

It's already there. The problem seem to be that it's not possibel to use 
relative paths.

Hi

If you are working under linux there is a perl script to help you
build a new plugin framework that you can extend. However your
question is very unclear so its difficult to help you :-( I do suggest
you take a look at:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

As it may explain why your question has not received an answer yet :-(

Best regards

Tim

I think it would be great to be able to provide a solution for V
Studio buffs to develop on QGIS with so any detail howtos / patches
etc needed to make this happen will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Extending QgsMapToolIdentify and QgsIdentifyResults
Message-ID: <45B97175.80908@amnh.org>

Dear Developers,

I was wonder if it would be possible to disassociate the 
QgsIdentifyResults from a QWidget? My suggestions is to make 
QgsIdentifyResults a more generic object. This would allow for any class 
(or plugin) to implement QgsMapToolIdentify. The QgsMapToolIdentify 
mouse event would simply return a QgsIdentifyResult object that could 
then be displayed by the user or used to obtain attributes for the 
feature or pixel at the screen/map coordinates.

For example, I have been working on some modifications to the 
QgsRasterLayer and QgsRasterLayerProperties classes (and gui) to allow 
for basic stretching and multiple user defined transparency values.  One 
of the feature that was suggested was to have a "Identify Features" like 
tool to populate the transparency tables. In this example, the user 
would press a button "Add Values From Display" which I would like to 
launch a QgsMapToolIdentify like feature, but return the results as a 
simple object to QgsRasterLayerProperties.  QgsRasterLayerProperties 
would then use the results to populate a table in gui rather than simply 
display the pixel values in another dialog.

This would also allow users to inherit and extend the functionality of 
QgsMapToolIdentify. It seems like it should not be to difficult, but I 
may be missing something here.

cheers,
-pete

It looks like the Apple libraries are not being found when linking. One 
guess is that CMake decided you're not compiling on a Mac. Send me your 
CMakeCache.txt. I'll compare it to mine and see if some odd 
configuration decision was made.

Hi

As Martin suggested its probably easiest to copy and paste and
existing plugin directory (.e.g. north arrow plugin) and then just
rename the classes / reimplement the application logic. At some stage
in the future I hope to integrate a small plugin builder into the gui
and make it work with python bindings, but I have not exact idea when
I will get time to do this.

For writing new grass modules there is a tutorial on the qgis wiki here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Adding_New_Tools_to_the_GRASS_Toolbox?highlight=%28grass%29

Also if you use the wiki search function for 'grass' you will find
further helpful advice.

Can I gently nudge you once again to read this:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

In particular its good to put a subject line in your mails to the list
so the messages can be properly threaded.

Regards

Tim

Hi

Poking back into the old grey matter, I cant remember if any commercial GIS
applications show areas as ha, though I vaguely recally arcview having a
plugin that did. My feeling is that if adding the ability to show units in
ha doesnt require a large amount of effort it would be a nice feature to
have since its a basic working unit used by many people in land management.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] gdal-1.4.0 and qgis
Message-ID: <pan.2007.01.26.09.19.02.515792@geo.uu.se>

Hi!

I try to compile QGis 0.8.0. It worked fine as long as I had gda-1.3.2.
After an uprgrade to gdal-1.4.0, which I built with grass-support, I get
the following error below during compilation of QGis. Apparently libgrass
is not found, but I specified it and configure did not complain (I
configured with the same parameters as in the build against gdal-1.3.2).
Is there a problem with gdal-1.4.0 in general?

Henning

My thoughts exactly, escpecially as I'm interested in forestry. It's in 
trunk now, go ahead and test it if you like (when you get back).

Now that 0.8 is released, its time to consider OSGeo membership for
QGIS. Some of you may recall we ran a poll a while back about this  
issue (see
http://qgis.org/component/option,com_poll/task,results/id,12):

The results were:
   Yes  	   	 81.4%  	
   Maybe 	  	11.5% 	
   No  	  	  7.2% 	

Its clear that most responders are in favor. Adding the Yes and Maybe
votes yields ~93% non-negative response. Of course there is no way to
know who voted or how many times.

At present, there is no desktop GIS application like QGIS in the
OSGeo collection. GRASS is already part of OSGeo thus joining OSGeo
seems to be a natural step.

OSGeo offers increased visibility, promotion at conferences, access
to legal advice, hosting of downloads and other project services, and
management of sponsorships. Promotion at major conferences includes
brochures and booth presence.

For information on the incubation process see: http://osgeo.org/
incubator/process/process.html.

This is your chance as a developer and/or user to comment on the  
issue of QGIS
joining OSGeo.

Please provide any comments or input you have to the list no later  
than February 1, 2007.

Looking forward to your comments,

Hi Peter,

your idea sounds good for me. But could you explain how should
QgsIdentifyResult object look like? I mean what will be its contents
for vector/raster layers - e.g. only feature ID (for vector layers)
and cell coordinate (for raster layers) or whether it will contain
also more information etc.

Martin

My Win2K sp4 gcc couldn't handle paths ending in '/' or '/.'

I commited a fix for this r6459.

Hi:
 
I've been trying to build qgis using cmake in windows but I'm getting this:

I got the latest source code from svn and the latest msys. Also I tried setting the variables suggested with no success.

Hi,

if you're using latest SVN trunk (at least 6453), the libraries should
be found automatically if you have msys environment in c:\msys.

There is always possibility to specify the missing variables
(*_LIBRARY and *_INCLUDE_DIR) in a configuration program called
CMakeSetup (graphical tool similar to ccmake on unixes).

Specifying the library doesn't help? Do your settings for the deps
look like this:
GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR = c:/msys/local/include
GDAL_LIBRARY = c:/msys/local/lib/libgdal.dll.a

Martin,

For the most part the results that are displayed now are sufficient but 
here is a list of things that could be useful

All Results to include:
Map coordinate (projected)
Map coordinate (geographic)
Display coordinates, i.e., X,Y within the display (lower priority)
Layer type

Vector Specific:
Feature ID + all associated attributes (table values)
length or area of feature if not already in table (lower priority)

Raster Specific:
Pixel Coordinate
Pixel values (all bands)
Pixel count (for classified/categorical data)

WMS Specific:
???

For simplicity the result set could include more meta-data type 
information about the layer, but that is not necessarily needed as that 
information is readily available using QgsInterface::getActiveLayer(). 
For the actual storage of the results an xml document would be robust, 
but could add a little overhead.  Or, for everything but the vector 
feature attributes and the pixel values, a simple struct could be used. 
Vector feature and Pixel values could be a QList of another struct that 
is just an attribute name and value, so for raster it would be 
attribute=Band1 value=50 etc.

Anyway, thanks for thinking about this. I know there are a lot of other 
things to do but I think this would be a useful modification that would, 
for example, allow a plugin to respond differently to points based on a 
particular attribute i.e., loading an external file (path/url in 
attribute) with the correct application (depending the file type stored 
in another attribute). 

cheers,
-pete

This is weird, I?m using SVN trunk 6459.It does not detect the variables automatically also I set the variables in the form that you suggested and it still does not work.
I tried running cmake from cmd, qt console and msys with the same results. I will give a try to cmakesetup.

Hi all,

I've put together some notes on building QGIS with CMake on wiki:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_with_CMake

It's still a work in progress but it should serve as a source of
information on building QGIS SVN on any platform. Any comments and
suggestions are welcome.

I've compiled the latest SVN code (thanks to hints from Tom). I was  
able to run the application by double clicking on it in Finder. I

been completely resolved?

I also noticed some display problems. The title bar text ends up down  
in the map canvas area (see http://gisalaska.com/images/

This was fixed by r6426.

This first appeared with Qt 4.2. For qgis 0.8, it happens only when 
launching from the command line and will correct itself when a layer is 
added. For qgis 0.9, it happens both when double-clicking and launching 
from the command line; it does not correct itself.

The problem has something to do with the relationship of the overview 
canvas to something else; it may be the panning rectangle but I'm not 
sure. If you set the parent of QgsMapOverviewCanvas to 'this' in 
QgisApp::createOverview, the problem goes away. This is incorrect 
however and may cause some other problem in the future.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Translation Files for Qt Classes
Message-ID: <45BAF3DF.4040307@comcast.net>

Hi all,

I've added qt_*.ts translation files from the Qt distribution to the 
i18n directory. These files provide:

- Text for standard buttons (QDialogButtonBox context).

- Text used to adjust Mac menu locations (QMenuBar context).

- Text used in Open, Save and other standard dialogs.

For translated Mac menus to be displayed correctly, the About menu 
string in the QgisApp context must match the About string in the 
QMenuBar context, Exit must match Exit or Quit, and Options must match 
Config, Preference, Options, Setting or Setup. Either file can be edited 
as long as there is one match in each group; Qt does comparisons using 
these pairs.

All contexts in qt_*.ts are not used in QGIS so all do not have to be 
translated. At the minimum, QDialogButtonBox and QMenuBar should be 
translated. QFileDialog and QMessageBox are almost certainly used. 
Someone who regularly uses a translated QGIS should add other contexts 
to this list when they notice items that aren't translated and aren't in 
qgis_*.ts.

Qt provides files for Chinese, French, German, Russian, Slovak and 
Spanish (plus a few we don't use). These files are not always complete. 
They should be reviewed for the strings we need.

For other languages, we need to create the files ourselves. If anyone 
creates an additional file, they should consider submitting it to Qt for 
inclusion in a future Qt release.

Can a qt_*.ts for a new language be created by copying an existing 
language and clearing all the translated strings or should I add 
qt_untranslated.ts to svn? I added the QMenuBar context to the one 
distributed by Qt because it was missing.

Hi

See (as I suggested several times before)

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#forum

Randomly asking questions without doing any research into the answer
yourself is not going to help you get answers...your question relates
to the use of postgresql / postgis and you should ask your question on
their mailing lists - unless its something that specifically happens
while interacting with QGIS - which I cant tell because you havent
posted any supportive information.

Please read the page at this link - you will be amazed at how much
more easily you will actually get answers to your questions...

It's not clear from your question whether you'd like to create a
vector layer, add some features to it and save it as a shapefile or
whether you just would like to show some points / lines on map canvas.

Tim's suggestion is for the latter case. For the former one, you must
create new data source with OGR provider, and add features to it using
provider's functions.

For me, using meta-data seems to be a complication which is not
needed. I like the idea of having a generic (probably abstract)
QgsIdentifyResult that will contain only basic information, e.g. map
and screen coordinates. Then we can have derived objects for vector
and raster layers (that would contain the stuff you've written above).

I appreciate that you think about impacts of your additions to QGIS
architecture and I'm looking forward to see the patches from you :-)

What's the reason of not wanting to paint the features with
QgsRubberBand? It supports drawing polylines and polygons. For points
you can use QgsVertexMarker.

Also you could subclass your own map canvas items to do the same job.
So far we don't have any tutorials on this topic but it's not hard.

It's possible to do it in a way as you write. However the benefit of
drawing it as a canvas item would be that you don't need to render the
whole map when you change/add a feature.

If you're interested in creating a new layer and rendering it together
with other layers, you'll probably find out that API is not very
polished for this. Creating new features is complicated by the fact
that you need to specify the geometry in WKB. For adding new features
see QgsVectorLayer::addFeatures()

Hi

I have been pondering this since OSGEO started, and am fairly
convinced its the right way to go. In addition to raising the profile
of QGIS, we will benifit by being able to make use of the OSGEO
hosting offerings which will hopefully reduce the rather large amount
of time we currently devote to project admin related activities.

My feeling is that initially we should not make use of and financial
infrastructure from OSGEO and just do things one step at a time:

1) get ourselves incubated (can anyone say cheep! ?)
2) start migrating our web site / svn etc to osgeo servers where it
makes sense to do so
3) start thinking about if / how / when we want to make use of the
financial related parts of the OSGEO offering.

Regards

Tim

This should be fixed by r6471. Thee was an integer overflow when 
calculating an empty panning rectangle.

// setGeometry (Qt 4.2) is causing Mac window corruption (decorations
// are drawn at odd locations) if both coords are at limit. This may
// have something to do with Qt calculating dimensions as x2 - x1 + 1.
// (INT_MAX - INT_MIN + 1 is UINT_MAX + 1)
if (x1 == INT_MIN && x2 == INT_MAX) x1 += 1;  // x2 -= 1 works too
if (y1 == INT_MIN && y2 == INT_MAX) y1 += 1;

Message-ID: <894f2d3b0701290944r6bcd8f5bif5cd55c7b5df896e@mail.gmail.com>

We are an amateur orienteering team. We have analyze your program qgis and
we are interesting to insert the specific symbology to produce the
orienteering maps (please see the example enclose)

The map scale are 1:25,000 and 1:15,000 and the symbols must be realize
following the rules of International Orienteering Federation
www.orienteering.org like this two sets of symbols, depending the use of the
maps:

1. Standard symbols (ISOM2000) that is the most used (scale 1:7,500, 1:
10,000 and 1:15,000)

2. Symbols used in the Sprint game competitions (ISSOM 2005) that presents
some difference regarding park in the city (scale 1:4,000 and 1:5,000)

The rules are very accurate for the colour, orientation and are always
identified by unique-code (sometimes use by other software)

The symbols of the two set (130 symbols for each set) could be appears the
same, but sometimes the difference regard the dimension.

To begin the "work" could be useful start with the set ISOM2000.

The only software that we know, is Ocad www.ocad.com but it has many
problems about compatibility, and no layers.

We have no many fund and we wish that "work" not need many investment. We
would like only to promote the diffusion of the orienteering sport.

Hi,

could you provide more details about your problem? What version of
QGIS? What exactly do you mean by "not full" ? etc.

Also providing a simple project for replication would save us much work.

Hi Jack

Radim has mentioned some possible 'downsides' in the preliminary
discussions we had on the PSC mailing list before Gary sent the
initial email in this thread out for wider comment. I think I can
summarise by saying that Radims main concern was that the OSGEO
becomes some kind of defacto portal for people trying to find free and
open source GIS related software, essentially precluding non member
projects for similar consideration. Of course this can be seen as an
advantage for the OSGEO members projects, but since open source
developers have a libertarian approach to life I cant help but agree
with Radim a little. Not enough for me to *not* want to join PSC
though because I think that lifting up some open source projects into
the public eye will inevitably bring other initially less visible
projects into focus too.

In fact for me the biggest 'con' I can think of is the time and effort
we will need to invest to oversee the incubation process and any
additional admin overhead being an OSGEO member may introduce. Since
QGIS is a 100% volunteer effort at the moment, any time spent on admin
generally reduces otherwise productive developer time. The counter
argument to this is of course is that if OSGEO lives up to our
expectations it should reduce admin overhead that we currently invest
in managing our project servers, removing spammer posts to the forums
etc etc

Other than that I really dont see any great cons in the road ahead -
though it would be interesting to get a retrospective opinion on the
matter from some projects that have already gone through the
process...

Best regards

Tim

Hi all,

I'd like to ask you to try to build and run QGIS from SVN trunk in
case you're running a something other than Windows, Mac or Linux
(these platforms are already known to work). We're considering the
usage of CMake build system and we would like to know whether
everything will work also on platforms like *BSD, Solaris and other
UNIX systems.

Instructions on building can be found here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_with_CMake

Thanks for any help,
Martin

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0701310232m734ef4b1gf78f37708b4745ce@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

while resolving regressions in legend menus, I've realized that the
popup menu is getting quite long. In menu we have:
- zoom to layer extent
- show in overview
- remove layer
- show attribute table
- toggle editing
- rename
- properties

Plus there are global menu items for handling the legend:
- add group
- expand all
- collapse all
- show file groups

My idea is to remove these 4 items (which are not layer-specific) from
menu and implement their functionality as small buttons with icons on
top or bottom of the legend.

Any objections / other ideas?

Martin

I'm not in favor of adding permanently visible controls because it takes 
away from content space. A row of buttons means one less row for layers.

If the controls could be implemented as a hidable toolbar, that would be 
ok because it could be hidden by those who prefer content space over tools.

Personally, I don't think the menu is too long, however, I prefer 
applications that are primarily menu controlled.

Ideally, it should be possible to use the application either way. On a 
Mac, there is a 'hide tools' control in the window title bar. Apple 
recommends designing applications so every command is on a menu 
somewhere but to also provide toolbars for those who prefer that style. 
Each user then decides whether space should be devoted to content or tools.

Perhaps there can be a preference item: "Layer tools are buttons/menus". 
Depending on the choice, the items are displayed as buttons or appended 
to the menu as they are now.

This is not an immediate goal but somewhere in the future, I wouldn't 
mind having the legend be a separate window. In this case, a legend 
toolbar would be the place for these controls.

I have been able to build qgis svn trunk with cmake on Ubuntu 6.10
with "cmake -DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs ."


Unfortunately, while I was able to configure FreeBSD 5.5 with
"cmake -DGRASS_PREFIX=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs
-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2/bin/qmake ."
it failed to link because the options necessary to pull in pthreads
weren't automagically detected.  With the autogen.sh version I would
simply have done:

 ./autogen.sh --with-projdir=/usr/local
--with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.3.cvs
--with-qtdir=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.2.2

configure has a special case for freebsd that adds -lpthread to
QT_LIBS, not exactly sure at first pass how to force that through
cmake.

Dear Martin Dobias and Peter Ersts,

I am glad to hear extending QgsMapToolIdentify within QgsIdentifyResults. I
like your idea. 

I have some idea for few plug-ins. One of them requires user assigned extend
coordinate select by mouse click event on the map canvas. Actually this
plug-in will be used raster image warping like as gdalwarp util. 

Feel a free to advice and helping to me for above plug-ins work.

P.S I'm looking forward to see the suggestion and patches from you on
QgsMapToolIdentify and QgsIdentifyResults.

Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] Extending QgsMapToolIdentify
andQgsIdentifyResults

Martin,

For the most part the results that are displayed now are sufficient but 
here is a list of things that could be useful

All Results to include:
Map coordinate (projected)
Map coordinate (geographic)
Display coordinates, i.e., X,Y within the display (lower priority)
Layer type

Vector Specific:
Feature ID + all associated attributes (table values)
length or area of feature if not already in table (lower priority)

Raster Specific:
Pixel Coordinate
Pixel values (all bands)
Pixel count (for classified/categorical data)

WMS Specific:
???

For simplicity the result set could include more meta-data type 
information about the layer, but that is not necessarily needed as that 
information is readily available using QgsInterface::getActiveLayer(). 
For the actual storage of the results an xml document would be robust, 
but could add a little overhead.  Or, for everything but the vector 
feature attributes and the pixel values, a simple struct could be used. 
Vector feature and Pixel values could be a QList of another struct that 
is just an attribute name and value, so for raster it would be 
attribute=Band1 value=50 etc.

Anyway, thanks for thinking about this. I know there are a lot of other 
things to do but I think this would be a useful modification that would, 
for example, allow a plugin to respond differently to points based on a 
particular attribute i.e., loading an external file (path/url in 
attribute) with the correct application (depending the file type stored 
in another attribute). 

cheers,
-pete
