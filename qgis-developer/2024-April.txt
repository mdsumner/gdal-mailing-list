Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Announce - migrate our mailing lists to Discourse

[Message sent to all QGIS's lists. Sorry for crossposting - **please 
reply only in PSC list**? ]


Hi all,

as you may know, we traditionally use mailing lists?a lot in QGIS 
project as well as for other OSGEO projects.

All those mailing lists are server by mailman, a venerable piece of code 
written by Richard Stallman. Those mailing lists are hosted by OSGEO 
team (System Administration Committee known as SAC).

Mailman is end of life and all FOSS project are looking to its successor 
, like? GNOME project for instance?[0] .

Additionally, mailing lists are not used anymore by younger folks.

Reason for this are numerous, from competition with instant messenger 
tools, the lack of a nice responsive interface, difficulty to search and 
explore mails on the web, or simply because the monopolistic Outlook 
client does not make it easy to use mailing list correctly.

OSGEO team has deployed a Discourse instance, and after 4 months of 
tests with some early adopter -like QGIS-FR list - we think the project 
is mature enough to start discussing about migrating QGIS's main lists.

With this move, we hope that we can counter the current fragmentation 
and streamline our discussions. Please fell free to react.

Any help in this migration move will be more than welcome, from testing 
and spreading the word, to buying a beer after this move ;-)


## What is Discourse ?

Discourse [1]? is an open source only project built to support community 
discussions, started in 2013 and thought to address the gap between 
dying mailing list, forums and the rising instant messenger tools 
dragging all discussions into private and locked-in spaces.

It allows advanced moderation, advanced notification settings, and is 
thought to streamline discussions.

It is already used by tons of community projects, you probably already 
know it, from Gnome to Mozilla.

Want to have a look ? The already migrated lists are there : 
https://discourse.osgeo.org/

## What are the benefits of using Discourse ?

It is searchable on the web, and can be explored lot better than our 
mailman archives.

It is extremely easy to subscribe to a category. No more need to have 
one subscription per list.

Receiving mails and answering from your mail client is fully supported.

You can copy paste images, videos, code and can react via emojis.

There is a basic instant chat, based on matrix. We prefer at this stage 
to use a dedicated channel to avoid confusion. (We are already present 
on IRC and Matrix - see [3] )

## What if I prefer mailing lists ?

Discourse offers options that are very close to mailing lists. See 
Mozilla's tutorial :

https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-do-i-use-discourse-via-email/15279

## What calendar and steps for this migration ?

With the System Administration Committee we agreed to? :

- Prepare archive import for a zero downtime migration in June.
- Start with PSC list first, which is smaller
- Announce the? several times for a month we are going to switch, and 
ask everyone to create an account on Discourse via OSGEO LDAP connector. 
Channels will be lists themselves, blog, QGIS desktop feed, and asks for 
communities and user groups to relay in their dedicated channels.
- Do some tutorials about how to handle notifications and advanced options
- Do the switch list per list during june
- Put old mailing list in archive mode with disclaimers.


## What about private lists ?

We currently have private lists like QGIS-voting-members or 
PSC-Private.? We did not tested this yet, but Discourse has options for 
this [2]


Any thought from you is more than welcome, from ranting against 
modernity to thanking SAC for their hard work.

Best regards ,


R?gis on behalf of your beloved PSC

I'm unhappy about this, as I suspect are others who have been in the
Free Software world a long time.  I expect that this will lead to
reduced engagement by the longer-term-FS people.  Part of this is that
tools that encourage post-and-only-see-answers lead to a help desk
feeling that than a community.

I don't expect to be listened to in any serious way, but you said "feel
free to react" :-)

Hi Greg,
Of course you are free to react !
I'm interested in understanding why you feel this would reduce engagement.
I've been testing Discourse a lot in the past years. From french spaces
around open data and numeric commons, to a first test with QGIS french user
lists.
What I have observed is :
- new users jump in more easily than with our obscure mailing list habits.
- I just don't see any usage difference once I changed my settings from the
default digest setting to "one mail per interaction"
- it is a lot easier to subscribe to a category than to subscribe in
mailman to a new mailing list.
- finding topics via search engine is so much more normal. Remember we
needed Nabble to offer this and it was not an easy experience. And Nabble
died.
- as a list administror, mailman backoffice interface does not make it
easy. It has been designed in the early stages of the web. This is so hard
to understand, read and maintain. And don't try on a phone.

On the downsides, I just had to explore notification settings and
understand how categories work a bit more than I would have expected. But a
lot less time than the numerous hours struggling with mailman admin
interfaces.

So if you have tangible ideas or facts we are really interested.  Discourse
is open source and really full of features, settings or plugins to tune it
to our needs.

Cheers
R?gis

Message-ID: <d1817d59b73749728257aabc6307487a@erdc.dren.mil>

I recently installed QGIS 3.34.4, but when I run the debugger I received the error below.

DebugVS: Need install ptvsd: pip3 install ptvsd

I checked using pip list and see I have installed ptvsd 4.3.2 installed.

I checked the DebugVS plugin install and noted it stated:

For use, run this plugin and enable the Debug (Python:Attach) in Visual Studio.
Need install the debugpy's module(pip3 install debugpy).

I installed debugpy and now when I run Enable Debug for Visual Studio, it launches a completely new instance of QGIS and then the first instance of QGIS gives the error:

RuntimeError: timed out waiting for adapter to connect

In 3.16.16, I just ran the debugger in QGIS and hit F5 in VS Code and things just worked.

I do:
 - Lack of real sender email: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/3072
 - Bogus text/plain rendering: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/3073
 - Loss of GPS signatures: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/3109
 - Unconventional quoting: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/3119

Some of them have been reported upstream but there wasn't much action there.

Since then, I admit, I stopped testing it, so don't know if anything was fixed.

Message-ID: <rmimsqa5bm4.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

What I meant mostly is two things:

    People like me tend not to be happy about things turning into forums
  and are likely to participate less.  As an example, openstreetmap
  moved from mailinglists to forums and I have not, so I interract far
  far less and spend more time on other things.  I am probably somewhat
  unusual (started doing email in the 70s), and here probably only strk
  thinks I"m normal :-)

    My perception, perhaps off base, is that discourse facilitates
  people showing up, posting a question, and getting replies to the
  question, without also getting delivered to them everything else on
  the "mailing list".  Thus I expect a lot more help desk type
  interactions, where new people ask a question and don't really engage,
  rather than joining the community.
    Many projects have communities of long-term participants who get to
  know each other.  Partly from on-list, but partly from off-list
  converstations which are enabled by getting emails with the other
  person's email address.  I don't see this happening in a discourse
  world.  I'm not arguing there are no mechanisms and that people could
  not make it happen.  I am saying that I expect it to happen much less
  in practice.

I don't have any good ideas about the first pointl.

The second point could be addressed by allowing web signup, but allowing
posting only if one has email delivery of all messages, and having the
From: address be the person, and not breaking DKIM signatures.   In
short, having the email interface be a first-class non-broken
mailinglist, while also having a forum view.

(I've dropped psc because it doesn't allow non-members to send.)

Just for the record: I also don't like the move, I also feel the same pain and
I also think you're normal.

To make it worse the advertised discourse mailing list option apparently
doesn't work well - at least for "normal" people (see
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/3073).

Message-ID: <CAAgsrZjdDx0uuYfKg3gfY0KUOGQJXYKVgxjo_k+dOW8-MfJbSw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I have a simple case where I created an empty memory line layer in this way:

vl = QgsVectorLayer("LineString", "braiding_river", "memory")
vl.setCrs(crs)
pr = vl.dataProvider()
# add fields
pr.addAttributes([
    QgsField("reach", QVariant.String),
                  QgsField("braiding", QVariant.Double),
                  QgsField("Length", QVariant.Double)])
vl.updateFields()
feat_list=[]

then I populate the layer where inside a for cycle I have

fet = QgsFeature()
fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolylineXY(reach)) #reach is a list of
QgsPointXY
fet.setAttributes([ str(breakval),  brIndex,  lenReach])
feat_list.append(fet)

Outside for cycle I do:

(result, newFeatures) = pr.addFeatures(feat_list)

But I have always result to False so the feature is not added.

I think could be a problem related to the id of feature so I tried
also to use fet.setId() ad passing a specific unique value but the
result is the same.

can Anyone help me please?
Thanks
Pierluigi

Hi Pierluigi,

Are you sure the creation of the geometry is ok?

Because your code with some hardcoded values in it, just works in my python console:


vl = QgsVectorLayer("LineString", "braiding_river", "memory")
pr = vl.dataProvider()
# add fields
pr.addAttributes([
     QgsField("reach", QVariant.String),
     QgsField("braiding", QVariant.Double),
     QgsField("Length", QVariant.Double)])
vl.updateFields()
print(f"{vl.isValid()=}")
feat_list=[]

fet = QgsFeature()
fet.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40)'))
fet.setAttributes([ 'test',  2,  2])
print(f"{fet.isValid()=}")
feat_list.append(fet)

(result, newFeatures) = pr.addFeatures(feat_list)

print(f"{result=}")
print(newFeatures)



Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

To add another FtR: I feel the same. Though I'm not a qgis dev myself, I 
tend to follow this list closely to stay on top of new features and/or 
bugs. I usually use qgis home-built from master.
I understand the move, but personally I find it a big step backwards. 
With proper emails, I can read them in my preferred interface 
(thunderbird), tuned to what I like (e.g. sorting, spacing/font size, 
etc). I read a lot of mail lists, and it helps to have them all in the 
same interface, and all presented to me in the same consistent way. That 
saves a lot of context switching when going from one list to the other. 
I immediately see what messages are new since I looked last time, and 
what subjects they have, in a familiar and compact way. I usually check 
all lists that I follow (50+) daily.
As far as I know there does not exist a similar thing for forums, where 
I can view each forum that I'd like to follow in one single application, 
with a highly customizable interface.
When this list moves to discourse, I'm afraid it will just become 
another dormant tab in my browser. It will soon be out of my habit to 
look at, because it will be out of my overview in thunderbird.
I understand that this is just me having stubborn habits (I feel old 
now), but I'm sure there are many more people who feel like this :)

Cheers,
Vincent.

That's actually more of a workaround than a fix.
Discourse still ruins the body of email text/plain email messages.
Even those sent for administrative purpose (links are turned into
html anchor tags)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Modeler: Can a QgsProcessingOutputVariant be a
 QgsProcessingParameterGeometry for child algorithm?
Message-ID: <aa6751a6-4481-41e1-b530-ce977b61c0da@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm trying to build algorithms with geometry ouput.
It seems that QgsProcessingOutputVariant has been build for it.

But if I use my algorithms in a model with QGIS 3.34 :
* I can't provide a name to QgsProcessingOutputVariant to become model 
algorithm ouput
* I can't use QgsProcessingOutputVariant as a parameter for a child 
algorithm

What is the QgsProcessingOutputVariant use case?
Which QgsProcessingOutputVariant has been defined for?

Thanks,
Ren?-Luc

Message-ID: <005201da877e$6fd77070$4f865150$@ziggo.nl>

Greetings,

 

The other day I watched a video by Dror Bogin on Building QGIS Plugins. 

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw1tokdVB9c <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw1tokdVB9c&t=2885s> &t=2885s

 

Dror mentioned that he had uploaded his slides to the QGIS Wiki.

But if I look at the QGIS Wiki here: https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/wiki, I can?t find any relevant slides.

 

Is there maybe another Wiki that I am not aware of ?

Appreciate your feedback.

 

Cheers,

 

Bart Duijndam

Yes, I will give Selma all the support she needs :-). For those curious
about NixOS as a desktop / day to day productivity environment, yes you can
100% use it for this. And you don't need to be a guru to use it. Since
April 2022 there is a nice graphical installer (
https://www.phoronix.com/news/NixOS-22.05-Released) and they have probably
one of the largest repositories of packages of any Linux distribution
(around 80k packages), including QGIS and QGIS LTR which are always
current. There are many other popular GIS packages too (see
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/applications/gis with an
active community that maintains them and more are elsewhere in the package
repo). For novice users, installing a package is no more difficult than the
equivalent in ubuntu:

apt-get install qgis

becomes

nix-env -i qgis

In fact it is easier since you don't need to set up QGIS 3rd party repo
first in NixOS.


A number of our (Kartoza) team who are not linux gurus use NixOS on their
desktops - if you ever watched a QGIS Open Day event, it was orchestrated
by Amy on her NixOS laptop :-P

Have fun!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin using Pythonnet fails to start during
 installation
Message-ID: <DB9P190MB193923A6194B0E6CD9B04727B2072@DB9P190MB1939.EURP190.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi developers.

We've developed a QGIS plugin, that utilizes Pythonnet to communicate with C# on Windows.

Pythonnet is not part of the chosen distribution for Python in QGIS (as of 3.34), so we do a separate installation of this module into %APPDATA%/Python, which is used by all Python distributions on the PC.

But even after Pythonnet has been installed correctly, we get an error when the QGIS plugin installer tries to start the plugin.

[cid:image001.png at 01DA8A6B.9CAF2A30]

However, the plugin has been installed correctly, and it starts just fine when one manually activates it in the plugin window list.


Why can't the plugin start when activated by the QGIS plugin installer ?
Is it running in some kind of restricted environment, that excludes use of the APPDATA location ?

Cheers.


Ps!
We are aware of different versions of Pythonnet in Python 3.7 vs 3.9. We install both.

Hi Richard,

the only way I found to have that log message go away is to add manually

[cache]
directory=/path/to/qgis_cache_folder

inside QGIS3.ini wherever your QGIS server installation has created it.

>From the QGIS Server docs it seems to me that setting
"QGIS_SERVER_CACHE_DIRECTORY" in the virtual host should be enough, but it
never worked for me. Maybe I'm not understanding the docs the right way.

Maybe a QGIS Server dev can shed some light here.

This question has been raised few times and really never got a clear
answer, see for example

Message-ID: <CAKmgki5p5tsAXfh9_FPaKvLx+MTCZCbuLov6tk8-w0COsYYb4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers!

Hope you're all doing well!. My name is Joona Laine, and I've been making
many contributions to the QGIS project under the GitHub username
"Joonalai." during the past few years. I am also the author and main
contributor of the projects pytest-qgis and flake8-qgis.

Having read through the "Requirements for new contributors" requirements
and agreeing to them all, I'm writing to formally request commit privileges
to the QGIS repository. I believe these privileges would enable me to
contribute more effectively to the project's ongoing development.

I'm committed to upholding the project's standards and guidelines, and I'm
eager to take on a more active role in advancing the QGIS project. I'm
prepared to fulfill any additional requirements or steps necessary to
facilitate this process.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response and
the opportunity to continue contributing to the QGIS community.

Best regards,

Joona Laine

Hi Joona!

First off, thank you for your contributions to QGIS! They are certainly
valued and highly appreciated.

Can you explain a little more about why you desire commit rights to the
QGIS repo, and why this can't be met via pull requests?

Unfortunately, in the light of the recent xz hacking mess, I think the QGIS
project needs to be **extremely** cautious about granting additional rights
to **anyone** for the repositories, and treat this as an extreme measure
only done when absolutely necessary. It's the sad reality of the world we
currently live in. ??

Nyall

Hi Nyall,


Thanks for reaching out and giving me the chance to explain further.

I totally get the recent concerns about the xy backport, and I want to
assure you that I'm all about positive contributions to the QGIS project.

One thing I've noticed is that sometimes things can get a bit hectic for
core developers, and it's totally understandable that reviews might take a
bit longer. It can also be tough to get the active discussions started
sometimes. For example, I recently helped a friend make their first QGIS
core contribution (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/56825), and they were
really excited about it. But, despite our best efforts and a bunch of
pings, the PR hasn't gotten any feedback after a month.

I might not have the full picture of the whole project just yet, but I'm
genuinely keen to lend a hand and maybe tackle some demanding core
contributions down the line.

Thanks again for considering my request. Let me know if there's anything
else you need from me.

- Joona

this looks like your plugin's __init__.py (that one that contains the 
"def classFactory(iface)") want's to import the LIFA_ejdexplorer before 
it's location is added to the PYTHONPATH

You may need something like:

sys.path.append('folder to LIFA_ejdexplorer')

before the classFactory(iface) is called.

Greetings,
Benjamin

Hello,

I want to post a message (which contains an inquiry) to the qgis developer
list.
The message is the following:

Is there a solid documentation/tutorials on handling 3D on QGIS's python
API ? Currently working on a QGIS plugin that exports data in 3D format and
trying to make use of the 3D views in QGIS to visualize the outputs. I am
aware of the Qgis2threejs plugin (https://github.com/minorua/Qgis2threejs)
but I am more interested in working with the native 3D handling of QGIS.


Thanks in advance

Hi,

afaik the 3D Python API is not fully finalized yet. But you can already 
control some aspects of it from Python, mostly the views themselves. 
This was added recently, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/55862

Have fun!
Hannes

Hello everyone,

Please find below the report regarding the maintenance tasks and development of QGIS-Django, QGIS feed and QGIS Hugo websites:

New PR submitted:

  *   QGIS Hugo: Make default currency to Euro<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>
  *   QGIS Hugo: Make once-off payment the default<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>

Merged PR:

  *   QGIS Hugo: Fix header navigation bar and playwright test<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/213>

Updated server improvements:

  *   Update the System Administration Documentation: this is generally related to issue #111<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/111> on QGIS Django but it?s divided into smaller issues on the private repo.
  *   Monitoring server: Add the new servers to a new group

Next week will work on performance improvements on the updated servers.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] A load of updates in OSGeo4W
Message-ID: <20240414230246.rvykko63wuneci3m@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I just uploaded an update to OSGeo4W.   It is basically a rebuild of everything
with a newer compiler (Visual C++ 2022) and updates of almost all versions.
The update should work cleanly and cause no visual changes.

The main change is the move from Python 3.9.18 to 3.12.3.  But there's also an
update to Qt 5.15.13, OpenSSL 3.   Qt6 was also added enabling an experimental
build of QGIS master with Qt6. Based on that there is also an experimental
version of QField.

GDAL and PROJ also were updated to the latest version.

The legacy GRASS 7 was removed because it doesn't support Python 3.12.  GRASS 8
was already available and QGIS switch to it long before this update.

Please test and report.


J?rgen

Hi,
Is there a planned release timeline for official Qt6 support? This is
critical for customers who rely on Qt LTS for bug and security fixes (Qt5
is past its EOF for non commercial users and ends for commercial users in
~1 year). Many thanks to all the people who have worked towards this goal.

Hi devs,

I have found an issue and proposed fix 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57150 that has been merged and backported.
It will be possible to chain algorithm on Point and Geometry.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Modeler: What's missing to define string,
 number or other simple outputs
Message-ID: <288864b1-56c8-443b-99b5-63804b0c6b27@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

It seems it is not possible to define string, number, boolean or variant 
output for modeler algorithm.

For example, if you add Delete duplicate geometries 
`native:deleteduplicategeometries` algorithm in a model, you will not be 
able to define the name for the outputs Count of retained records 
RETAINED_COUNT and Count of discarded duplicate records DUPLICATE_COUNT.

So what's missing to be able to define the name for string, number, 
boolean or variant output to ensure that these became model algorithm 
output ?

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Hi Jeffrey,

Qt6 is being worked on actively. This is a huge project and QGIS.org is 
spending funds, and? volunteer developpers spend also countless hours on 
making this happen.

Be assured that this will happen.

Furhermore, QGIS project also funded some upstream fixes and features in 
Qt6. We definitely want to benefit from them.

Cheers

R?gis

Hello J?rgen,

Thanks for your job.

Does this mean that the version of Python and other dependencies will 
change in the current LTR or not (installed via msi or osgeo4w)? To what 
extent is this linked to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54491? 
Also, how are these massive OSGeo4W updates discussed and decided? Is it 
on the OSGeo discourse or on the mailing list or somewhere else? I would 
like to be notified in advance to inform our end-users for incoming 
changes. I've searched a bit but I did not found.

Regards,
Julien

That should not be necessary anymore.  The dependencies should be fine for a
while now.  Some of them were behind and complaints about that were increasing.

Some with regard to security, although some if not all just based on plain scan
results and not on actual assessments of the real severity of vulnerabilities -
which should have been low in the context of QGIS Desktop.  Still they were
valid.

We were still using OpenSSL 1 (no complaints about that though), which both Qt5
and Python were build against.  So both were blocking the update to OpenSSL 3.
And Qt6 needed to be introduced, preferably not built against the old OpenSSL -
although that would probably still have been a possibility.

So Python and Qt5 had to be rebuilt along with there reverse dependencies,
which almost is everything else there is.  So that was a good time to also
update.

To some.

There's not much discussion about OSGeo4W.  There's is a bug tracker
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w and a mailing list
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/osgeo4w-dev/

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Broken doctest infrastructure for Cookbook
Message-ID: <0f5ba189-c8c6-4fdc-8c3c-d19932c78636@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

May I request some help on this issue 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/9010), please? It 
happens for more than a week and makes every single commit fail. As 
noone on the docs side has touched the cookbook for a long time, I 
suspect the issue comes directly from master or its libraries (3.34 is 
just fine).

Thanks,

Harrissou

Hello everyone,

Here is the report for this week regarding the maintenance and development of the QGIS-Django, QGIS-feed and QGIS Hugo websites:

New PR submitted for QGIS-Django:

  *   Explicitly list invalid metadata keys<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/380>
  *   Show the modified date in the model list and detail<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/381>
  *   Show the number of results returned in the search<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/383>
  *   Add delay notification in the approval email<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/384>
  *   Fix the responsive navigation bar<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/385>

Merged PRs:

  *   QGIS Hugo: Make default currency to Euro<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>
  *   QGIS Hugo: Make once-off payment the default<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>

Updated server improvements:

  *   We have performed some performance tests on the updated websites using `ApacheBench`. We noticed that they were slower than the current ones. Therefore, we have put them under temporary domains to perform checks on the same configuration and get close results. Some of the static files might be cached by Cloudflare.
  *   We also tested the SSL certificate management and the updated websites are now available on temporary domains, which are as follows:
     *   https://plugins.kartoza.com for the QGIS plugins website
     *   https://feed.kartoza.com for the QGIS feed website
  *   We have updated the QGIS feed website (the one at https://feed.kartoza.com ) with the new look based on QGIS-Hugo (PR #72<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/72>)

Important note: We?ve scheduled the migration of these updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.

If you have any questions or feedback on these updates, please let us know.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Updated server improvements:

  *   Update the System Administration Documentation: this is generally related to issue #111<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/111> on QGIS Django but it?s divided into smaller issues on the private repo.
  *   Monitoring server: Add the new servers to a new group

Next week will work on performance improvements on the updated servers.

Have a great weekend.

Hi,

QGIS repos, like https://qgis.org/ubuntu or https://qgis.org/ubuntugis 
are not responding. The connection ends at cloudfare.com with timeout error.

Is it a problem on QGIS servers side or some cloudfare temporary issue?

qgis2.qgis.org was apparently dead.  Rebooted.  Builds restarted?

It looks like also https://issues.qgis.org/ (where the Redmine Issue 
reports are stored, e.g. https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12193) is not 
working:

Dear QGIS developers and users,

In my work as a freelance GIS consultant I work with QGIS as much as 
possible and try to convince clients that it will address all their GIS 
needs despite not having to pay a license fee for it (and no, it is not 
user unfriendly).

More and more, in addition to wanting 'a GIS system', there are requests 
for a web based management information system which shows both maps and 
a dashboard with selected KPIs, and where selecting a feature on the map 
will update the graphs and charts in the dashboard. So far, I have not 
been able to find out if this is possible using Open Source software, 
what it would require in terms of setting it up/configuring/additional 
development. I assume it is technically possible to develop it.

Does anyone have experience with this? How did you set it up? Any 
examples I could have a look at? I guess strictly speaking it is not a 
QGIS question, but seeing that some other proprietary GIS software 
vendors are offering web dashboard functionality 'out of the box' it 
does get associated with the GIS software procured.

Is there a demand for it (from my limited view - yes)? Are there 
thoughts about developing such functionality more 'out of the box' 
within the QGIS community? What would such development require? My 
impression is that there is more (very tentative) willingness from 
donors to consider contributing to Open Source software development as 
part of development projects, but it may mean that it would need to be 
written into tender proposals with indicative figures for the required 
funding.

I have a limited understanding of what is out there (I've just dabbled 
(so far unsuccesfully) with chartbrew and grafana the past few days to 
see how dashboard creation works) so I am not sure what are the right 
questions to ask. I realise my questions are still rather broad. I have 
some time at hand so I would be available to do more research and become 
more specific if there is an interest in this topic.

Looking forward to your ideas!
Janneke

Hi Rosa,

thanks for the quick response - I am also not sure exactly what my 
question is, so all answers are probably helpful. I am now having a look 
at streamlit and seeing if that helps me get a better picture. It's 
definitely interesting!

cheers from Tz :-)

Thanks for your response!

I think the most common case would be:

1. data in postgres database
2. editing done in qgis
3. viewing map and some selected graphs/tables in the web browser with 
the ability to (for example) click on a feature and use that to filter 
the data to only include data for that feature in the 
graphs/tables/other dashboard items, or be able to select from a drop 
down list and use that as a filter.

Which indeed corresponds to your Scenario 2. If I understand this 
correctly, you will always need to program the HTML frontend to 
communicate with the backend, and there are no tools that let you 
automagically configure the html front end with dragging and dropping a 
map widget and a graph widget with some settings for data sources?

I guess what clients might be asking for is the equivalent of ArcGIS 
dashboards... I have not worked with it, but from the docs it seems to 
be the type of functionality clients have on their wish list, where no 
coding is required to publish a map with some corresponding indicators. 
(https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/7edefc1970d44b839ebbfd7b45e51e2d 
for example).

So maybe my questions are on two levels:

- what would someone need to do to create something with a similar 
result (any recommended tools/libraries/languages - Rosa just 
recommended some)
- is it desirable to have an Open Source tool that allows for creating 
something with that functionality without the need for coding? And if 
so, what would be the way to go about it?? Which would maybe be more of 
a discussion rather than a technical question.

cheers!
Janneke

Dear all,

I'm the maintainer of the plugin opeNoise (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/opeNoise/)
The organization paying the maintenance would like to change the name from
opeNoise to opeNoise Map
Is it possible inside the plugin repo do that?
If I just change the name entirely in the project is it enough?
Thanks for your help

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build problems using install instructions
Message-ID: <1897794.1dCVfqAmtM@apn53>

Hi,
I'm not an experienced builder, and have come to this point after finding problems with 
QGIS using KDE Neon  - library problems with the binary and age problems with the 
flatpack version.

I'm running the latest KDE Neon version which runs on Ubuntu 22.04


I've managed a successful QGIS build parroting instructions from https://github.com/qgis/
QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md[1]

However this time around I've errors which I don't know how to resolve:

Hi,

You probably need to install the package which provide those files, it's
pyqt5-dev on Debian, so it should be the same on Ubuntu.

It's on the list of packages to be installed [0], did you install them ?

You can check if it's properly installed with the following command:

dpkg -l | grep pyqt5-dev

Regards,
Julien

Hi Saber,

>From the link you sent, I tried some code lines. For instance, I tried "
iface.mapCanvases3D()" but It doesn't seem to work, I'm getting the
following error: AttributeError: 'QgisInterface' object has no attribute
'mapCanvases3D'. I'm working on QGIS 3.34.5.


Kind regards,

Abdelghani

Hi Abdelghani,

that blog post highlights new features of version 3.36. Those methods 
are not available in 3.34.x. ;)

Cheers, Hannes

Hi Johannes,

You're right, thanks! Oh and by the way, using the _3d module documentation
of version 3.36 (https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.36/_3d/index.html) is it
possible to code everything that the GUI offers or some features of the GUI
are not yet implemented in the python API ?

Cheers,
Abdelghani

Hello everyone,

Please find below the report for this week:

New PR submitted for QGIS-Django:


  *   Add Layer Definition File and 3D Model to the resource API<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/388>
  *   Show the path for the forbidden dir in child folder<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/387>

Still working on:

  *   QGIS-Django - Update site branding to match feed.qgis.org<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/319>: I?ve proposed an approach for this issue. Please feel free to share your feedback about it.

New draft PR submitted for QGIS-Django:

  *   Site branding update<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/392>: this is for the issue I?m working on. It?s based on the changes made for the PR #374<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/374>
  *   Add Qt6 support, show min_qt_version and max_qt_version int the XML<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/386>: This is the proposed change for #373 according to the (ongoing) discussion at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8982. This will be marked as ready depending on the output of the discussion.
  *   Change db collation<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/378>: It?s based on the changes made for PR #374<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/374>. This should fix the issue #45<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/45>. However, it would be great if someone could advise me regarding the DB collation change, I was wondering if it will have another impact on the application. Considering that it will only be applied when migrating to the new server.

Important note: We?ve scheduled the migration to the updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.


Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Subject: Re: QGIS Full Stack Web Developer Report
Hello everyone,

Here is the report for this week regarding the maintenance and development of the QGIS-Django, QGIS-feed and QGIS Hugo websites:

New PR submitted for QGIS-Django:

  *   Explicitly list invalid metadata keys<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/380>
  *   Show the modified date in the model list and detail<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/381>
  *   Show the number of results returned in the search<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/383>
  *   Add delay notification in the approval email<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/384>
  *   Fix the responsive navigation bar<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/385>

Merged PRs:

  *   QGIS Hugo: Make default currency to Euro<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>
  *   QGIS Hugo: Make once-off payment the default<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/pull/216>

Updated server improvements:

  *   We have performed some performance tests on the updated websites using `ApacheBench`. We noticed that they were slower than the current ones. Therefore, we have put them under temporary domains to perform checks on the same configuration and get close results. Some of the static files might be cached by Cloudflare.
  *   We also tested the SSL certificate management and the updated websites are now available on temporary domains, which are as follows:

     *   https://plugins.kartoza.com for the QGIS plugins website
     *   https://feed.kartoza.com for the QGIS feed website

  *   We have updated the QGIS feed website (the one at https://feed.kartoza.com ) with the new look based on QGIS-Hugo (PR #72<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/72>)

Important note: We?ve scheduled the migration of these updated servers into production for 06 May 2024. During this time, uploading new plugins will be disabled and the ability to install plugins may be intermittently unavailable.

If you have any questions or feedback on these updates, please let us know.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,
Lova

Not sure if it helps, but:

# locate QtWidgetsmod.sip
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/bindings/QtWidgets/QtWidgetsmod.sip

# dpkg -S /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/bindings/QtWidgets/QtWidgetsmod.sip
pyqt5-dev: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/bindings/QtWidgets/QtWidgetsmod.sip

Do you have pyqt5-dev installed?

Note:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/debian/control.in
shows alle packages our Debian packager is using :-)

Else: try to a clean build?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Choose DEM layer as terrain in 3D view using PyQGIS
Message-ID: <CAOSq7HN2kXbf5qNYr7Wr--yyUGAH+MTJbTmc92XrhJ00TxGP2g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having a hard time showing my DEM raster heightmap as terrain in
QGIS's 3D view using the python API. I don't know which class is useful for
this task but I've had some guesses that didn't work so far : setting the
DEM raster layer to a QgsRasterDemTerrainProvider() / using
a QgsAbstract3DRenderer.

This is what I'm trying to have access to :
https://i.sstatic.net/FyzW3RlV.png (image containing the GUI responsible
for choosing DEM layer as terrain).

Any ideas ? Working with QGIS version 3.36.1.


Cheers,


Abdelghani TAMORT

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PKI Certs with QGIS
Message-ID: <CA+yeZQ+nkyJxf2sqSVmFQmqXiDzyQG2hKEDAZmoP7qa6mbvhMg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Support Team,

    I'm currently working on a script that will allow the CAC reader to
pull PKI Certs off the CAC card. I'm currently working with the CAC support
team and they have a few questions that I'm not familiar with that you may
know:

Does the opensource application support PKI?

How does the opensource application process FIPS 140 cryptography?


I believe QGIS does support PKI based on the authentication block I've
attached to this email but would you happen to know the answers to the
other question?

Thanks,

Joshua T

I've worked with CAC/PIV before, and your situation doesn't really make
sense to me, even though I can see how you might have ended up where you
did, and I could guess what's really going on -- but won't.

It looks like you attached a picture, which my mail reader didn't
display.  That's ok; I don't like to look at screenshots vs. text.

More or less, qgis can fetch GIS resources over https, and thus follows
pkix in much the same way other programs do.  I realize that's probably
not that helpful.

My impression is that you probably need a consultant.  You didn't
mention the purpose of your work.  As you know, ITAR is a real concern,
and it would be good to be clear that it is not related to a defense
service.  If you do need help with a defense service, you'll of course
need to find a US-based consultant.

I am the owner of the Curve Number Generator plugin and multiple people
have reported this issue. They are saying they never changed the default
format themselves.
When they make a new profile, everything works well. Someone has reported
this to QGIS as well

In fact, the issue continues to be reported for various GDAL processing 
algorithms.

For example, the following ones are the most recent reports regarding 
the default output layer extensions issue:

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54375
- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/55110#issuecomment-1873415345

Hi,

Sorry I didn't read your mail till the end, and actually I'm pretty
confident to know where it comes because I fixed it 4 days ago...

I'm pretty sure it's related to this:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57218

If you try to build master, just pull your repository, restart a
clean build, and it should be ok. Le me know if it's not the case.

Regards,
Julien

Hi all

Just a quick note that tickets for this year's User Conference are now
available!

You can get your ticket on the web site of the conference:
https://uc2024.qgis.sk/

There are two newly added pages on the site:
- tentative schedule - https://uc2024.qgis.sk/schedule/
- practical info when attending - https://uc2024.qgis.sk/attending/

We are now in the process of going through the submitted talks and
workshops - there are over 80 proposals! We would like to publish the
program sometime in May. Most likely we will be running talks in three
rooms in parallel, plus workshops in three more rooms.

See you in Bratislava!

Regards
Martin (on behalf of the local organizing committee)

Hi Abdelghani,

You should be able to achieve that by setting the project's terrain:
```
p=QgsRasterDemTerrainProvider()
p.setLayer(dem_layer)
QgsProject.instance().elevationProperties().setTerrainProvider(p)
```
This should get your dem_layer as a terrain for any new 3d views.
I don't think the API to change the 3d views' terrain is exposed to python
yet.

Stefanos

Thanks Julien and Richard


I gave it another shot on the weekend with a clean build which was successful.

But I'm now thinking I'd be better suited to using the latest stable version, 3_36 in this 
case.


My interpretation of the instructions,


git commit
git worktree add ../my_new_functionality
cd ../my_new_functionality
git fetch qgis/master
git rebase -i qgis/master
# only keep the commits to be pushed
git push -u my_own_repo my_new_functionality
is:
 
git commit
git worktree add ../release-3_36
cd ../release-3_36
git fetch qgis/master
git rebase -i qgis/master
# only keep the commits to be pushed
git push -u QGIS release-3_36


which failed with:


git fetch qgis/master
fatal: 'qgis/master' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.


Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.


git fetch QGIS/master yields the same result


My build tree is listed below

Tony

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Maintainance of QGIS Plugin repository
Message-ID: <d7c5f1e6-0a73-41c5-8fe6-c83a4b076842@gmail.com>

Hi All

I help out in the approval process of QGIS plugins. There are various 
issues that are listed https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues to 
streamline the approval process of plugins.

Over the years there has been a steady increase in plugins that are not 
approved <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/unapproved/>. This is due to 
a number of reasons:

* Duplication of functionality. Plugin functionality already exists in QGIS.

* Plugin authors not willing to address issues raised during the 
approval process.

* Plugins containing binaries (Not really sure about the policy here).

* Plugins which are a fork of an existing plugin and then they get 
renamed to something else without permission from the original author or 
the author is no longer interested i.e 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/active_fire2/.

* Old plugins that still use the old architecture i.e Python2.

Could we either implement the following changes to maintain/cleanup the 
plugin repository.

* Old plugins that were never approved because the author did not care 
to resolve issues flagged be deleted from the repository i.e 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ban_adresse_locator/

* Plugins that have vague names and offer functionality that is 
ambiguious i.e https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/upload/ be deleted.

* We could automate the deletion of plugins where feedback has been 
received but the author hasn't done any corrective measure maybe after a 
month or couple of months.

* Automatically flag the plugins which are not approved to Deprecated 
after some time.

I think the above and other recommendations will encourage people to use 
the plugin repository properly as currently it feels like a dumping ground.


On a side note: What is the policy for plugin names. I know it is up to 
the author to give his plugin a suitable name but something like 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/transfer_layerfilegdb_to_geopackage/#plugin-versions 
looks like a description rather than a name.

Regards

Adire

Hello Stefanos,

Thanks a lot, it works for me!
How about showing extruded buildings from a vector layer (using an
attribute containing height in meters)? I'm supposed to work with
the QgsVectorLayer3DRenderer class right ?

Best regards,

Abdelghani TAMORT

This is what I'm trying to achieve (sorry my QGIS GUI is in french, I know
it's not very pleasant for the eye) :
[image: image.png]
I'm supposed to define the symbology first using the
class QgsAbstract3DSymbol then feeding it to the QgsVectorLayer3DRenderer
(I imagine), but I haven't got a clue how to start doing that.

Hi Admire

Thanks for this! We can certainly task Lova with helping to streamline the
process, implement better moderation tools etc. With regards to deleting
plugins, I think we should take the approach that we in general do not
physically delete things, rather we unpublish them with a flag that removes
them from the plugins.xml, search on the plugins page etc. I think it would
be prudent to maintain the chain of evidence in case we ever have a dispute
or complaint about a plugin.

Regards

Tim

Hi Abdelghani,

You need to create a symbol, set its data defined properties, assign it to
a 3d renderer and then assign the 3d renderer to the layer:

```
s = QgsPolygon3DSymbol()
p = QgsProperty()
p.setField('field_containing_height')
c = QgsPropertyCollection()
c.setProperty(QgsPolygon3DSymbol.Property.ExtrusionHeight, p)
s.setDataDefinedProperties(c)
layer.setRenderer3D(QgsVectorLayer3DRenderer(s))
```

Best,
Stefanos

Hi Admire,

Thank you for helping with the plugins.

I think we can lower the administration time, if we can enable reviews 
by the users. Not just voting (that we already have), but written 
reviews. Written reviews can address issues you mentioned:

- Duplication of functionality. Plugin functionality already exists in QGIS.

- Plugins containing binaries (and related problems)

- Plugins which are a fork of an existing plugin

- Etc

As an example, Wordpress has about 60k plugins [1]. The submission 
process and rules are similar [2]. But the credibility about each plugin 
is mostly based on user's reviews, votes and number of downloads.

Basically, we already almost the same data as wordpress about plugins, 
but we miss user's reviews. User's reviews can add value.

What do you think?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

I think it's good to reject plugins.  To the extent that there are fewer
while still being able to do things, it makes the user's job easier.
That's an argument about rules like duplication.

I think the review committee should have high standards about
cooperation and it's ok to just close requests.

I haven't read it, but I think the rule should be  that plugsin
  - have a license which is compatible with qgis's license (they are
    derived works after all)
  - have a public repository and bug tracker

I also think that because qgis is broadly portable, a plugin needs to
have a story about how it's going to work on any computer which can run
qgi and run plugins.  that pretty quickly lands you at "no binaries",
but does admit "needs to build foo library".  For context, I use qgis on
NetBSD, and the modern world is dreadful at both "have this binary wheel
- it runs on 3 operating systems, 2 cpus each" and "to use this run
docker because our build system and instructions are such a mess that we
don't think you can build it".

Obviously (to me) proprietary binaries are totally out of the question.

Not clear why this is a hard no.  Could be failed as noise, could be
failed as failing to comply with community norms.  But if the original
is no longer maintained, and its a continuation fork, then it seems best
to unpublish the original and publish the fork.

sure, that's a technical fail.

I'm unclear on how the repository works, but it seems like it should be
a curated list of things that are ok and that involves kicking things out.

agreed.


All in all, I think the repository approval team should be empowered to
be heavy handed, with appeal to PSC.
