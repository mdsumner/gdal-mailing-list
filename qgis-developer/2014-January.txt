Just because someone complained about the slow JPEG2000 support in the weekly
builds.  The weekly standalone installer snapshots were based on the qgis-dev
package.   Not there's a qgis-full-dev package which the comming weekly builds
will be based on.

Hi all
+1 for Tim idea.
Some time ago I was thinking about further development of osmSearch plugin.
I created widget similar to Firefox search box with possibility to select
search engine. I was thinking about separate panel (like in osmSearch) but
this widget can be also added to new QGIS toolbar as Tim mentioned [0].

These are some of my ideas (similar to Tim suggestions):
- user can choose many search engines (by selecting them in menu/settings)
- user can assign key word to search engine and perform searching only in
chosen engine (e.g.. "m search_phrase" for MapQuest search)
- results are displayed in tree view (in separate panel) with root as search
engine e.g.:

+ OSM Nominatim
|- Result 1
|- Result 2
|- ...
+ MapQuest Nominatim
|- Result 1
|- ...
+ ...

- items in tree view can be set/unset visible on canvas by clicking checkbox
(including all groups)
- new search engines could be created as new python modules (plugins
architecture) inheriting from base search class (I think this could also
allow to search data sources in loaded layers/hard drives/web/OGC
standards/etc.)
- more autocomplete control by user
- pan/zoom to selected feature, limit extent

Other functionalities, like reverse geocoding or displaying result details
in widget, are also a good ideas that can be implemented. Any other
suggestions/ideas?

For now, to mid January, I have very limited time to take care of this
ideas. Later this month I can try to do some work.

Yes everything you have described is exactly what I was hoping we could see
in QGIS - if you ever get time to work on this I would be very happy to see
it included as a core functionality of QGIS!

Hello,

I had a similar problem and found help,  here can you look, how I solved 
it:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/WG-Re-WG-Re-cpp-plugin-for-QGIS-2-0-td5087852.html#a5087933

My problem was that I used the sources for 2.1.0 and not for 2.0.1 to 
compile my plugin. The next thing is that I could only compile it for a 
QGIS 2.0.1 (32 bit). In the 64bit version it isn't shown!
Until now I couldn't compile a QGis for  64 bit.

Happy new year!
Susann Schmidt

[Qgis-developer] C++ plugins instructions






I have an issue that after upgrading my C++ plugins to 2.0.1, they do not
show up in the 2.0 version of QGIS. Has the procedure for identifying and
installing C++ plugins in QGIS 2.0+ changed? I have tried using the 
start-up
plugins generator and that does not show up also in the 2.0 version. 

I have asked this question more than three times and I have not heard a
reply. May be it is the holidays, but I have been asking since October the
same question. I looked and tried many ways, and I am still without an
response. Is there a new instruction for plugin registration? Do we have a
new policy to limit C++ plugins from users, a new unwritten policy to 
unplug
C++ plugins? 

Just wondering,

Hi Minoru,

before all, happy new year :)

Then, with the new year, I had an idea: what do you think of a QT window
inside QGIS, which displays the 3D html page ?

Could it be doable ?   Do you have just tested ?


Regards

Minoru,

Other argument:
in this image, on the left you can see GoogleEarth, and on the right the
threejs.html :

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1QVVGVnJmMlBfOEk/edit?usp=sharing

It seems that 3D html model  has exagerated height.  True ?

Yes, it is exaggerated (x 1.5) currently.

I tested now, but I had:

"Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support WebGL"

:(

But, test it yourself, also. Who knows if you have some "magical" settings
on your machine...

Minoru,

this is my ( experimental starting )  test plugin for "webbrowser":

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1ZWstOWZ3aER2cDQ/edit?usp=sharing

Simply, drag and drop a url link inside the web view.  For example:

http://opensciencemap.org/map/#scale=12,rot=0,tilt=65,lat=42.3502,lon=13.3988

and you will have the message:

"Sorry, your browser doesn't seem to support WebGL"


How to discover what browser is used by Qt ?   I will investigate ...

Hi folks, happy new year to all of you,
Xavier is on vacations, I'll forward your messages. Merging the two plugins
is a good idea, in fact Xavier coded his plugin and discovered the other one
after when I asked him to rename it from Nominatim to a more user explicit
name. We had done a private plugin using our postgis ressources to locate
places, and Xavier wanted to make a public version of it, using Nominatim.
speaking of functionnal needs,  we have several other "place search"
services we wish to use, like french geoportal's one (requiring a key),
google's one. If porting it to core, we should allow users to choose which
location service they want to use, with specific parameters.. If not, we
will fork another plugin.. killing the advantage of having a core plugin.. 

Early 2014 will be a very busy period for us, I'm not sure we can invest a
lot on the plugin, and will still have  some others to upgrade , like
EaysCutomLabeling for instance. 

I'll let you know next week. 
Cheers
R?gis

Hi,

I just tested it and works wonderfully!
I also have tried it as web process for PyWPS and works very well!

Thanks a lot for this!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] About TINs and QGis
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhvpw9gkQrw-=4dytXj0uwTasc26abt=L-fqHRZ5ez+XUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


As in object, I have a question:

There is a way to display a TIN into QGis ?

I intended, there is a way to load a triangle net, also if only in 2D, and
display it like in this image:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1dkNaM1BvLWswZmc/edit?usp=sharing


This is an example of TIN , that I need to display with QGis:

Gaeta in   ITFformat  (VTerrain.org  format):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1eXl2OUZwT3daTUE/edit?usp=sharing


the same in PLY:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1VjdKejU2M1MxdFU/edit?usp=sharing

the same, using the gms TIN ascii format:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1RWkxbGVucmRzb2s/edit?usp=sharing


Thank you for any info abut this.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg906edFw+jQQLDVDKinYiNDY=zz6r1LHUBjcA3A3uyxtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I noticed that CPython has a list of "easy issues" in their bug tracker.
http://bugs.python.org/issue?status=1&@sort=-activity&@columns=id,activity,title,creator,status&@dispname=Easy%20issues&@startwith=0&@group=priority&keywords=6&@action=search&@filter=&@pagesize=50

I was thinking this would be good for us to have to.  I know that "easy" is
a subjective topic but I think we could make a start with small things like
typos, UI tweaks, etc.  I have had people ask me "is there a list of things
I could get started on" and having to respond with "I don't really know,
have a look though the tickets' isn't really a good way to respond.

In order to do this I think we will need a keywords field for RedMine.  Is
this possible?

Anyone against this?

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Minoru,

First of all, many thanks for your plugin.

As I use Mac OS X and the QGIS version of Kyngchaos, the path of gdalwarp is
/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.10/Programs/gdalwarp but this
QGIS version does not recognize  the PATHs defined in the UNIX environment
of MAC OS X ie:
        
        export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH
        which gdalwarp
       /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs/gdalwarp

So I had to make some changes in your qgis2threejs.py script to run on Mac
OS X with this version of QGIS. 
I know that you can not change your script for a specific case but I hope
that this will help Mac users  who want to use your plugin.

General:
----------
The os.system() works but it is marked as deprecated in the doc , so I use
the Python module subprocess to make the job (as in Processing or the old
Sextante) and it works:

original line 185
    os.system(cmd.encode(fsenc))
my solution:
     proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
stdin=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
     proc.stdout.read() 
 
   (subprocess.check_call(cmd,shell=True) does not work )

Specific to Mac OS X:
-------------------------
- I change the line 182 
"cmd = "gdalwarp " + u" ".join(options)"
in
"cmd = "/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.10/Programs/gdalwarp"
+ u" ".join(options)"

- and I have removed the conditional statement
#if not os.path.exists(demfilename):
#....

- the same with line 160 which becomes:

#options.append("--config GDAL_FILENAME_IS_UTF8 NO")

- a final command which works  is, for example:

"/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.10/Programs/gdalwarp -r
bilinear -te 201132.706856 87080.384980 206579.284551 91865.013464 -ts 214
188 -t_srs EPSG:31370 "/Users/Shared/Dropbox/my.asc"
"/var/folders/vu/vu099NovH-KZpE5TEa83BU+++TI/-Tmp-/dem20140101164100.tif"

Cosmetic
-----------
As I still use Snow Leopard version (witch uses Python 2.6, I know, I know,
it is old, but...), the line 48
      locale= localePath = os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'i18n',
'qgis2threejs_{}.qm'
becomes 
      localePath = os.path.join(self.plugin_dir, 'i18n',
'qgis2threejs_{0}.qm'.format(locale))

(working with Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x versions)

Hi Nathan,

a nice idea I think, also to attract new dev. I tried something like
that some time ago (with ubuntu as example):

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/OneHundredPaperCuts

but better to do it in Redmine indeed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Web Client improvements
Message-ID: <CAL5Q670rxBpoc2=bTHF_t-fyGXqk_vCyV2B2JPbZvt5oRsTkrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

happy new year to everybody!

I''ve started a new project with QGIS server and QGIS Web Client, my first
impression is that QGIS Web Client is a great tool, very easy to set up and
with mostly all the features you need ready-to-use.
A very good job!

Of course I would like to contribute with some code and translations, in
fact I've already started:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/pull/59

Here is my hypothetical TODO list, I need your comments about what could be
of general interest and hence been merged upstream and what do you think is
just my customization and can stay in my fork.


1. remove as many as possible hardcoded values from wsgi search scripts
(even if I prefer Python I did a re-implementation in PHP of these scripts
mainly because my customer needs them, this implementation has no hardcoded
values, no need for special columns and almost no configuration)
2. remove as many as possible hardcoded values from GlobalOptions.js and
Customizations.js or  try to guess smart defaults from ProjectSettings
response
3. resurrect the right panel (trying to solve the map reload issue) and
make it optional
3.1 make this info panel optionally available in the south area instead of
the east one
4. implement HTML tooltips taken from the HTML tooltip templates used in
QGIS desktop (done)
5. find a way to get reference map layers from ProjectSettings instead of
hardcoding them
6. this might be difficult or not possible: it would be nice to have an
interactive legend so that the user can directly click on a legend item to
filter->zoom to the features that match the selected legend item. I feel
this would require changes to the server side too....


Thanks in advance for your comments!

+1 for the php implementation as on an average web server php is more

This is all the configuration you need:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/master/php/config.php

I removed:
* the DB connection parameters (they are already in the project file)
* the search table name (it's now the layer name)
* the  displaytext, and search_category fields

The idea is that you should not have to modify your table and create any
particular column to make it work (it might be usefult to do that in any
case for performance reasons).



> Be aware of SQL injection!


Since most parameters are now taken directly from the project file, the
only parameters that need to be passed on the URL are the search text, the
layer name (which doesn't go directly in the query).
I'm using PDO prepare statements whenever possible to avoid injections and
a preg_replace to strip away everything  potentially harmful.

Not much yet. First I want to get the map parameter from the query string:

var project_map = Ext.urlDecode(window.location.search.substring(1)).map;

Then I would like to get layer from the ProjectSettings and automatically
select layers for the reference map.

Ideally, I would like to have the option to configure and use an additional
panel (south or east) to put one or all of the following accordion tabs:
* the search results
* the legend
* the feature attributes

I'm aware of the map resize->reload problem, I'm convinced that it can be
solved (and I would like to see an option here too: fo simple maps someone
maybe wants to keep the map resize active)

No, a discussed in point 2, I would like to have a way to (optionally)
automatically guess the reference (mini-map) layers.

First option would be: take all visible layers at start.

I also think it's not possible at the moment.
But I like the way it was implemented in other frameworks, all I need is a
way to get the style image for a single "class". I guess we need to add a
custom WMS method to the QGIS Server.

Hi gene,

I'm sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your concrete report.
I've changed the plugin code to do DEM warp with gdal.ReprojectImage
instead of gdalwarp program to store warped DEM data in memory raster,
so it may work in also Mac OS X, I guess. I will also fix the other
issue. Feel free to comment about the plugin.

Thanks,
Minoru

This is possible using the optional parameter "scale" from wms specs.
Using it and the layers param.
You could identify a single layer and get the legend at a specific scale.

Apy attention:
if you do not specify the scale parameter the wms server will return the 
render to ALL the scale.
This mean tahat the renddering is
a point a little scale and a polygon at large scale,
it will return an mage with a point and a polygon.

Andrea.

In the next QGIS version, you'll can use the RULE parameter to get the 
legend image of a class.

Maybe I did not understand what alessandro said, but it seems to me that it is 
rather the RULE parameter for the GetLegendGraphic that allow you to get the 
legend for one class.

In my case I deliberately decoupled the search completely from the
project - as a I want a lot of search options always available,
regardless of the project, also if the search layer is not available in
the project.

Imagine a project only containing raster maps. You still want to be able
to search for addresses, parcel numbers, streets, buildings, etc.
without having to load all of these layers into the project.

BTW: there is an alternative search method that uses the builtin layers
already. See section 4.2 in
https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/master/README

It uses QGIS server without any additional scripts necessary. It has a
"drill-down"-like interface which feels different from the other search
method.

So please just make sure that both versions will work - the decoupled
search as it is now possible and your new idea of deriving search from
the project.

This is already possible - see the section on Apache URL rewriting where
the map name parameter is derived from the URL.

See section 4.2.2 at
https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/master/README

Again, there is a good reason to do it and there are reasons for not
doing it. In my case I again wanted to decouple the reference map from
the content of the QGIS project. The best reference map in my case was
to use a topographic map series with different scales. I also wanted to
use this reference map in a project where the reference maps layers
aren't present in the project - e.g. in a project about different
orthoimages.

If you implement this in a configurable way, then I am fine with your
change - but make sure that the current behaviour of decoupled reference
map can be kept, if specified.

I am fine with that as long as it is configurable.

If the legend graphic would be an intelligent SVG graphic (with some
metadata in the SVG elements) rather than a stupid PNG I could see this
as a possibility. It would need an extension in the GetLegendGraphic
request. Each legend object in an SVG legend could know its relation
with the rule or category and the user could interact with it.

There is already a filter parameter available that allow the filtering
of a layer. See
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/QGIS_Server_Tutorial#FILTER-parameter

If an SVG graphics (with a bit of Javascript) could be coupled with the
already implemented FILTER parameter it would be rather easy to implement.

I would be interested in this improvement myself. So maybe we could team
up with this. Would be useful to further discuss what we want to
accomplish with the interactive legend.

Thanks,
Andreas

I see you point, I believe that both should be possible but I suspect that
the zero-configuration approach should come first.
This because this way you have a working installation with less
configuration, you can always override the default behaviour to have more
complex search options.

I saw this search feature, and I'm using both (the Python-wsgi/PHP one and
GetFeatureInfo) as they are both useful, I see them as a "generic search"
and an "advanced search", we need both.

Yes, absolutely agreed, my intention is to add features without breaking
the already existing (and yet amazing) features.

Again, I see you point :)
But again, I'm asking myself which is the easier/simple option to satisfy
the vast majority of use cases, I would by default start with the option
that works out of the box without the need to configure anything.
Then, show how to completely customize the reference map.

The overall feeling I've got  starting with QGIS Web Client is that the
search feature and reference map in QGIS Web Client start with the more
complex scenario and require too much user configuration to make it work
(even worse: the search requires a particular table structure and column
names!), on the contrary, we should start with the simplest scenario and
try to make it work with minimal configuration, then show a way to do the
most complicated things.

Great that you're in!

The simplest approach I see is to use the RULE parameter to
GetLegendGraphic to download the individual image for each class, then
build the legend on the client with a small Python/PHP helper.

An SVG image would also fit and would not require an additional Python/PHP
helper as long as the SVG has hooks to add js functionality to the legend
items.

Another option is to do some mapserver-like templating.

What about filing a ticket for this feature and moving the discussion there?

Thanks Yves, this is exactly what I need.

This is only available in master but not in 2.0.1, correct?

The RULE ?

It need to know exactly the class name,
but AFAIK the rule name is not available from the GetCapabilities

don't ?

Yes, but as I wrote, with a small Python/PHP helper that parses the project
file we can get that information and bind the two.

The SVG legend (if contains proper attributes to build the FILTER) would
work without an additional helper.

Hi Horst,

I have updated your QGIS Web Processing Client.
I have put the code on github : https://github.com/rldhont/qgis-wps-client

You can update the version on the QGIS plugin repository.

Hi devs,

You can test it and contribute.

Yes, but you can query the style in SLD and have the CLASS name.

Others clients like mapfish use it

Hi Salvatore,

Thanks! I'm working on a python class to easily publishing process based 
on PyWPS and QGIS-Processing.

I have updated my script exemple :
======================
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys, os
import inspect

#first qgis
from qgis.core import *
#next PyQt4
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

# init QApplication for processing and set the customSettingFolder
#a = QApplication( sys.argv )
QgsApplication( sys.argv, False, "/my/custom/path" )

# supply path to where is your qgis installed
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/my/build", True)

# load providers
QgsApplication.initQgis()

p = QgsProject.instance()
p.read( QFileInfo( "/my/project.qgs" ) )
print p.title()

mlr = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance()

qa = QApplication( sys.argv )
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
cmd_folder = os.path.split(inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()))[0]
if cmd_folder not in sys.path:
     sys.path.insert(0, cmd_folder)
Processing.initialize()

from processing.tools import *
#general.alglist( 'znt' )

#general.alghelp( 'modeler:znt' )

paramalg = []

print "runalg start"
general.runalg( 'process:identifier', *paramalg )
print "runalg end"

# quit
QgsApplication.exitQgis()
#a.exit()
QApplication.exit()
======================

Sorry, I don't understand before.

Obviously this mean that this solution is not for external wms where 
there isn't this little php addon.
Only for direct accessible server where is possible to add this 
php/python addon.

Also perhaps is better to add a vendor-specific parameter to the 
getcapabilites of qgis.
So you have no problem in evolutions of projects .qgs file formats

Hi,

Is really interst this information.
I don't know this option.

Is a wms specs request ?

To run QGIS Processing algorithms, I only rely on qgis.core but it is 
necessary to intialize a QGSApplication and a QApplication.

I'm working on a python class to easily publishing QGIS Processing 
server-side with PyWPS.
For example :
=============
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from pywps.Process import WPSProcess
from qgisWPSProcess import qgisWPSProcess

qgis = qgisWPSProcess("qgis:fixeddistancebuffer")

saga = qgisWPSProcess("saga:shapesbuffer")

grass = qgisWPSProcess("grass:v.buffer.distance")
==============
All theses processes has to be tested.

But I would like to add the ability to use a QGIS project to restrict 
processes on some layers.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q6728_pWhLN3GPaA9j+Z+SD-QOcxK0XoUKabCV2WFnJO6Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

while testing for GetStyles on master I noticed that the server raises an
exception if the parameter STYLE is not specified.

Digging in the code, it appears that Q_UNUSED( styleName );
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgsprojectparser.cpp#L1669


is there any reason for requiring a parameter (STYLE) that is not cited in
the official OGC specifications and it's not even used?

BTW: the server can be faked with an empty STYLE parameter, and the
exception is raised here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgswmsserver.cpp#L588

Should I file a ticket?

Hi,

It's just because the STYLE parameter is mandatory in GetMap Request and 
GetStyle is based on it.
If QGIS-Server will implement multi-styles, STYLE parameter will be 
usefull like in GetMap.

Thanks,

just to be sure: are you saying that GetStyle implementation in QGIS
Mapserver is based on GetMap and hence the parameter is needed (even if
unused) or that the OGC standard says that GetStyle is kind of sub method
of GetMap and it requires all mandatory parameters of GetMap?

Hi,

At today's PSC meeting, we decided that the QGIS Wiki  
(http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/) is in need of a serious cleanup.  
It's generally not well maintained and much of its content is better  
covered in the documentation and governance docs. In one week (on Jan,  
10th), we will be starting to remove content.

Please report any pages/content that you think should remain on the wiki.

If you find useful content but think it should be moved to a different  
location, please let us know as well.

Of course we will do a backup before we start the cleaning process.

Best wishes,
Anita

Yes, but GetStyle is not an OGC defined method.

The method defined by OGC is GetStyles to retrieve all the layer's styles.

You can open a bug, and discussing about GetStyle and GetStyles request.

Dear all,

I apologize for crossposting. As you know, QGIS has run a long series of very
successful developer meetings, where we fixed hundreds of bugs, wrote thousands of
lines of code and documentation, and took important decisions for the future of the
project. The next meeting will bring us even a step further: we decided to join the
so-called "C Tribe" Code sprint, which will be held in Vienna  [2], after another
history of successful events (Toronto [7], New York [6], Montreal [5], Island Wood
[4], and Boston [3]).
For the first time, QGIS will join forces with leading developers of projects like
GDAL, PostGIS, MapServer, PDAL, and many more get together to discuss new ideas,
hack, decide, tackle large geospatial problems. It will be presumably the largest
event of its kind ever, and we expect fruitful interactions and exciting results.
The participation of QGIS developers, who donate their time freely for what will be a
long coding week, will be made possible by your donations and sponsorship.
You are therefore invited to sponsor the event with a sponsorship (details on [9]) or
a free donation of any amount.
As a sponsor you profit from a number of honours. For example your logo or portrait
at the top of the sprint website, your name in public Code Sprint email communication
on the OSGeo mailing lists, your name and logo in an official OSGeo News entry, and
many more. All details can be found at the sprint website [9]. Of course we are open
to discuss your personal ideas to tailor your individual package.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Paolo Cavallini, on behalf of QGIS PSC

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ideas/proposal for Attribute Table
Message-ID: <23459542.6942351388851652834.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>


Hi, I list the main ideas / needs that have emerged from a hypothetical use in the office where I currently work (hypothetical because we currently uses a proprietary software):
1. Procedure to print ONLY the attribute tables: with the management of layout, borders, text, fit to page, etc..2. Report Creator for attribute table: integrating existing open-source programs or write new ones directly integrated into Qgis for GIS uses with sums, partial sums, statistics on the elements present in the fields etc..3. Managing the attribute table as a LibreOffice Calc (or Office Excel) filtered table: make available in an automatic way a filter in the column header that brings all the unique values ??and then allow the possibilities via checkboxes to filter what "see" and "don't see" and that visibility is reflected "at the same time" on the map (user choice).4. Reflect the colors classification of the geometry in attribute table: ie the background color of the rows in the attribute table correspond to the color set in the corresponding geometries (difficulty or inability with particular types of backgrounds / textures / gradients?).
Points 1, 2 and 3 are closely linked. Point 1. is already well-developed in the print layout of Qgis but my idea is to further refinement and "simplification", something like: Print -> Print Attribute Table ... and then from there I manage only the table, as described above (with particular reference to the most common print sizes A4 and A3). Point 2. could be a future step... users served / liked the Print Attribute Table? If YES we implement the Report Creator. Point 3. could be 2a. in the sense that it is closely related to 2. but with direct applications on the geometry (and of course also on the printouts of derived maps).

Sorry for the length of the text but I hope It was clear. Thank you very much for taking the time to read, but above all thank you for having created and subsequently developed this amazing software, I hope that these proposals can serve and be of interest to other users.
King regardsLuca

Message-ID: <CANVKczOBE_wNK9WcXc-FL_TJ=V-E6TitAza+Lpv5443GaPHpvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

 I've just spent an hour install qgis on a new Mint linux (saucy) box.
Here is the tale...

 I was using the qgis repo (because there's no ubuntugis for saucy at
the moment) and getting very weird behaviour. Installing the
python-qgis package removed the qgis package. And vice versa. I
eventually removed everything python, sip, gdal and qgis related and
eventually it all installed. Great. I think that problem was I did
have the ubuntugis repo in there at one point, and it may have been
getting incompatible gdal bits from somewhere.

 But then I ran it, and qgis python couldn't find sip so no python support.

 Python from the command line couldn't "import sip". I checked the
package dependencies - it was all there....

 Then I noticed I was running from a virtualenv....

 Tried from a fresh shell, and all was working - qgis and python in
perfect harmony. I can now get mapping!

 So I send this as a reminder that if people are having weird python
problems, check they aren't running from a virtualenv.

Barry

Agreed. I think it should have an open ticket (I must say: I hate
Redmine search).

Agreed.

Agreed.

IMHO, pages that have useful content, not to be missed, are:

* http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Adding_New_Tools_to_the_GRASS_Toolbox
(where to move it?)
* http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Bugreports
*
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Connect_to_a_Bluetooth_GPS_for_live_tracking
and
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Gps_units_download_data_and_live_tracking
(?)
* http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_Plugin_Ideas (?)

Furthermore, historical pages have already been largely removed. I feel
uneasy about this, and I think we should have (in either docs or gov) a
page about history, with the release announcements and dates, hackfest
participation and details, meetings and resolutions, etc.
Anyone would like to prepare a summary?

These should go to the gallery (or case study):

* http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/OpenStreetMap_data_rendered_with_QGIS
* http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/OS_Styles

All the best.

Checked, I added the tag for the first one, so you probably miss a
permission.
All the best, and thanks.

Plz have a look into this issue report:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9229

It turns out that certain python plugins are registering and
deregistering actions in a way it makes QGIS go slow.

Disabling (or removing the plugins) helps.

See the issue for 3 known affected plugins, plz add others if you can
find others with the same problem.

Hi all.
I would suggest an additional rule to accept a new plugin: we should
make sure it registers itself in the appropriate menu (Vector, Raster,
Database, Web, etc.), leaving in Plugins menu only those who cannot be
classified because they belong to more than one category,
This will help keeping the interface tidy.
Thoughts?
All the best.

Currently the 'menu'-functionality is half way there, I think.
While one defines a 'menu' in the metadata.txt, the actual placing has
to be done by the coder self in python.

Not sure what the reason was (alexander?)... (was it that the
pluginmanager had to know it, or that the plugins were loaded before the
gui or....).

But I think it would be nice to have this fixed first. Then a user can
even 'move' a plugin by changing the metadata.txt.

Richard Duivenvoorde

I can do some tomorrow before my holidays are over. If pages have already

Isn't that obsolete too?   New stuff should probably go into processing, right?

Why not leave information about Redmine in Redmine?

That's also something I'd keep in the wiki - IMHO that's what it's meant for.

Thanks, I'll do, but first I need to know why the QGIS Server code is as
ist is, I can't believe it's just an error.

I'm still confused: I know that GetStyles is an OGC method and GetStyle
isn't, but QGIS apparently doesn't, see line 705 in qgis_map_serv.cpp :

request.compare( "GetStyles", Qt::CaseInsensitive ) == 0 ||
request.compare( "GetStyle", Qt::CaseInsensitive )

so, it seems like QGIS server will serve both GetStyle and GetStyles
exactly the same.

Second point (that was my original problem) is why the STYLE parameter that
is both unused and out of the specifications is mandatory, unless I'm
completely missing the point, I dont' think it is a good idea to keep it.

So, please explain me why QGIS Server behaves like that, and if  there is
not a good reason, just tell me and I can provide a patch to remove that
stuff.

Hi Richard,

Yes, of these three, I had the Multipart Split.

I suspected that the problem could be some plugin. I uninstalled some, but not these...

I'll check if the problem is gone, or if there is another plugin causing the same behavior.

This was one of the worst problems I encountered in QGIS. I had to restart QGIS several times during longer editions. Thankfully the cause was diagnosed!

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Hi Luca,

the need to create some kind of reports is often uttered. IMHO a 
dedicated reporting tool can always handle this better than anything 
implemented in QGIS or any other GIS (because it is not a main GIS 
feature). I successfully coupled a Python implementation of 
JasperReports [1] with QGIS. JasperReports not only allows sum/average 
and the like but also subreports (for ?:n relations) charts and much 
more. AFAIK (but have not tried myself) LibreOffice output is possible, 
too. This solution needs some Python programming to create an XML 
document from your data and send the data and the report template to the 
server.

Hi,

if you need the multipart split try the EditTools plugin. Multipart 
split is included there (and much more :-). EditTools does not suffer 
from this bug.

Hi Bernhard,

Yes, it is an important tool for me, luckily there is an alternative, even more complete! Thank you very much!!

Are you referencing to the getmap rquest ?

In the wms specs 1.1.0 (OGC 01-047r2)  the style parameter is reported as
required in the GetMap request.
see table 7 pag. 23.

Also the styles param is null valuable . In this situation the wms will
choose the default style values for every layer.

Hi

QGIS server has its own GetStyle method because implementation of the 
server started based on WMS 1.3/SLD1.1. It seems OGC GetStyles is only  
present in WMS1.1.1/SLD1.0 and has been dropped afterwards. So it seems 
to me the bug in the server code is that GetStyles is directed to QGIS 
GetStyle.

I'm aware that WMS 1.1.1/SLD1.0 are very frequently used. So a patch to 
add OGC GetStyles behaviour for 1.1.1 is very welcome.

Regards,
Marco

I check also the wms 1.3.0 .
Is it also here required.

In the 7.3.3.4 paragraph it is named "the mandatory styles parameter.."

also it explain:

>the STYLES parameter shall include null
>values between commas (as in ?STYLES=style1,,style2,,?). If all layers are
to be shown using the default style,
>either the form ?STYLES=? or ?STYLES=,,,? is valid.

I guess the misunderstandin is on the mean of the style domanin: "0+".

I Guess this don't mean option parameter but instead it mean 0 values or
more.
Infact the paramter Style could give using the sintax:

..&style=&..

Andrea.

Hi Pedro,

The Multipart Split plugin should also be fixed. The Author would 
appreciate a feedback if the bug has been fixed indeed.

Hi all,

are we have policy for branches in our main repo? There are some
branches with functionality already merged into master or obsolete
ones. Should we remove them or keep?

As I can see we have next feature branches that can be deleted:
  dev-threading (obsolete)
  new_vector_api (merged)
  raster_resampler (merged?)
  sipapi-update (merged)
  wmts (merged)

Opinions?

I'd prefer to keep things tidy, and remove all the unnecessary stuff,
unless there are very good reasons to keep it.
All the best.

Hi Marco,

thank you for clarifying, you are absolutely right and it seems that it was
dropped after 1.0, my issue is related to "GetStyles" request, (please
notice the trailing "s"), I used this documentation
(02-070_Styled_Layer_Descriptor_Implementation_Specification.pdf,
http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=1188)  :

13.1. GetStyles
The GetStyles operation is used to retrieve user-defined styles from a WMS.
The
parameters of the HTTP-GET method are defined as follows:
Parameter Required Description VERSION Required
 Version as required by OGC interfaces.
REQUEST Required Value must be ?GetStyles?.
LAYERS Required Comma-separated list of named layers for which to retrieve
style
descriptions.
SLDVER Optional The SLD version requested for the SLD document. The default
is
to return the highest version supported by the server. If a version
is requested that the server does not support, then the next lower
supported version is supported by the server is returned, or the
server?s lowest supported version. This is similar to WMS version
negotiation.

If I understand this correctly, we should split GetStyle and GetStyles
calls and support the second one only if SLDVER is set and  SLDVER=1.0.0,
raise an exception if not match.

GetStyles should then accept the following parameters:

REQUEST=GetStyles
LAYERS=comma separated list of TypeNames
SLDVER=1.0.0 (this seems the only version that supports GetStyles)


BTW: does anybody know what method took the place of GetStyles after it was
dropped?

I made a patch to the multipartsplit plugin. The problem should be solved
by now. Please confirm.


Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

PS: In the next release to QGIS (2.2) there is a core tool to split
multipart features, so this plugin will no longer be necessary.

Yes, GetStyle and GetStyles should be split. As SLDVER is optional, it 
might be good to raise an exception only if wms version is != 1.1.1 (or 
if other required parameters are missing).

A quick followup - today I have pushed some changes that introduce a
connection pool for PostgreSQL. This should remove the problem with
too many connections. It limits the maximum number of concurrent
connections from one QGIS instance to four. Also, when the connections
are not used for some time, they get closed to save resources (right
now it is after one minute).

Please test and let me know if things work better now.

I will probably also look at pooling of SpatiaLite connections - right
now the queries within SQLite are serialized, so within one SpatiaLite
database you will not see any performance gain with parallel
rendering.

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field calculator does attribute changes silently
Message-ID: <52CAA93C.8010106@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Currently,when the field calculator does changes to attributes 
(modification, not adding a new column) it blocks signals of the vector 
layer while doing this. This leads e.g. to bug #9268 [1], that the 
attribute table is not updating properly. The fix would be very easy 
(i.e. remove the blockSignals() call) but I wanted to ask first, if 
there is a reason not to do this.

The main reason why I am afraid is, that apart from the blockSignals() 
call, there is also the paramter emitSignal specified as false in the 
call to vectorlayer->changeAttributeValue(). This parameter is currently 
not working, so I suppose that the blockSignals() call was introduced as 
a workaround.

However, there was a good reason, to block the signals explained in 
issue #7071 [2], fixed by J?rgen, that at the time when we only 
supported one iterator per layer, emitting this signal would break the 
update process and produce only partially updated results. This is 
fortunately no longer the case, so this reason can be considered obsolete.

Another reason which I could imagine (but I have no proof of) is that 
for big layers, emitting the signal for each feature can possibly take a 
long time. However, if this is actually the case we should rather think 
about batching the signal or fix unperformant consumer slots of this signal.

Be aware, that at the current state, there is no possibility, neither 
for plugins nor in QGIS core, to get reliable push-notifications when an 
attribute changes.

So my proposal is:

   * Remove the blockSignal calls and let attribute changes always be 
promoted
   * If there are problems introduced, lets fix the problems instead of 
working around them at the cost of unreliability
   * Don't fix the emitSignal parameter for 
QgsVectorLayer::changeAttribute and deprecate it for future removal.

If there is no objection, I would vote to make this changes before the 
QGIS 2.2 freeze

Best
Matthias

Hi all

I just discovered the plugin qgis2threejs. I love its simple yet powerfull
concept : export QGIS canvas as an image and drap it on a 3D model based on
some DEM elayer. I set up a demo and a video tutorial to show how it can be
used :

* video tutorial : https://vimeo.com/83511028

Richard,

We were discussing it already, without any success, and I can't imagine how it 
could be done with the 2.x API.

Currently each plugin just calls one of the QgisInterface methods: 
addPluginToVectorMenu, addPluginToRasterMenu etc. An obvious idea is to create 
an universal method "addPluginToTheRightMenu", but unfortunately it's not so 
simple. QgisInterface doesn't know "who" calls the method, so it can't access 
its metadata. The only way would be to explicitly pass the plugin module name:

moduleName = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))[1]
iface.addPluginToTheRightMenu( "A menu label", action, moduleName )

I guess it's too nasty to even discuss it ;)

So the only real solution I see would be to create an abstract plugin class 
and forece authors to inherite their plugins from this class. I'm not 
convinced if it's worth of the effort at all, but anyway it would be 
definitely a major change that has to wait for API 3.x

But maybe somebody has a simpler idea?

Regards,
B.

Message-ID: <CAKTWcSmnWRi+qHDghEPi=K8qZewU0TUXpUVKyXchgCa2TRMgkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a Computer Science Undergrad Student in India, currently in my third
year of study. I am good at C, C++, python, Web2py. I am doing research in
"Time Series Analysis of Spatial Data". My work is mostly centered around
satellite imagery.

I have been using Qgis for quite sometime now and feel that now I can
contribute towards its development. I tried to install Qgis from source
code by cloning it from the Qgis repository in Fedora 18 but faced a lot of
dependency issues. So I switched to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and tried the same
thing, but there was some error in the latest code. So I installed it from
the release prior to the latest one and was successful in doing that. After
I reported the bug in this mailing list only, it was rectified. So my
status at present is that I have Qgis installed from source code on my
machine.

Is there someway I can contribute in this community? If yes, do let me know
how can I start given that I have good background in C/C++ and Python
programming.

Thanking You,

Kshitij Kansal

suggest to do small tweaks and improvements while you get familiar with the
code and while the community gets used to working with you. There are also
many open tickets in out bug queue at http://hub.qgis.org - it would be
great if you can find some to resolve for us.

Have fun and welcome to the QGIS community!

Regards

Tim

I see. In any case, I think we should not approve a plugin unless it goes in the
appropriate menu.
BTW, could someone point out where we have a list of the items to be checked for
approval?
Thanks.

Is there a real problem we are trying to solve with this?

I am not sure, each plugin will belong to exactly one menu and the 
rules can technically be enforced. IMO They can as well have some 
entries in two different menus. Or require a totally new menu (although 
there need to be really good reasons for this).
This discussion seems related to the category vs. tags discussion for 
plugins, which we had some time ago, where I also think, that the 
category solution is not flexible enough in comparison to the 
possibilities offered to plugin authors by the extensive QGIS API.

Therefore, I would propose not to implement hard rules (like specifying 
the menu in metadata) but leave all the options to the plugin author 
and have some intelligent soft rules, which can be considered for each 
case individually, and eventually be discussed with the plugin author 
in the approval process.

Best
Matthias

Thanks for your comments.
I'd like to keep things simple at this stage: what I think we should avoid (and this
is easy to do) is having new plugins going to the Plugins menu, instead of the
appropriate one. Rationale:
* keeping a tidy interface
* make it predictable for users where to find a command.
I suggest to check this for each new plugin, and ask the author to chenge it if
necessary before approval.
All the best.

Hi Mohd,

Please contact the plugin author directly to ask for his plans to 
update the plugin. He might be doing it by himself or be happy to get 
help in this process.

Hi Matthias

I remember there was a performance consideration leading to the 
emitSignal parameter in changeAttributeValue. But I don't know if it is 
still needed, seems to be only used from field calculator, offline 
editing and a label tool.
So +1 for your proposal.

Thanks J?rgen, but QgsLegendInterface::moveLayer(QgsMapLayer *  ml,int
 groupIndex) is used to move a layer into a group ID according to the
documentation. It's not exactly what I want.
I'm surprise that we can't set an order for each layers like in
Openlayers or Leaflet. I'll wait for this enhancement :)

Etienne

This looks good to me. The "emitSignal" parameter simply feels wrong
and was likely introduced as a workaround for a slot that was
performing badly.

Hi all.
I agree this is an important issue. I heard there was some plan to implement this:
anyone knows the current status, and the prospects for the future?
Obviously, we have always the same duality: implementing outside QGIS is easier and
more powerful, reusing existing tools, whereas an internal implementation is far
smoother from an user point of view.
Historically, in most analogous cases we ended up implementing an internal solution
(sometimes using common libs), and I suspect sooner or later we'll have to do the
same for reporting also.
All the best.

Hm,

if you look at JasperReports it is Java. Can you implement this 
internally into QGIS? Looking at reports in general some kind of 
programming will always be needed to generate an individual report 
because the data structure is individual, too, so I think it will always

An idea to start with would be to create a new element in Composer that 
makes simple calculations like sum or average on a field: Choose layer - 
choose field - choose what to do. Evaluation time will be the same as 
for the map (either permanetly or on request but at least before printing).

How about adding this feature (aggregate functions like max/min/avg 
etc.) to QgsExpression instead? Then it could not only be used in the 
composer.

surely we want to keep Java out of our way, but there are libs also in Python, e.g.
python-reportlab

Yes and no, simple reports are within reach of the average user, see e.g. the
LibreOffice approach.

All the best.

Hi,

Personally I think that it is time to start implementing a reporting
within QGIS itself. We already have a very good start with the Atlas
feature.

If we want something integrated with not a lot of dependencies and
something relatively easy to use then we should not rely on external
tools, esp. if they are from the Java world.

Let alone that users would have to learn an entirely new tool just for
reporting whereas they may already be familiar with the QGIS concepts,
like expressions, data-defined values, the upcoming database
relations, etc.

With the other GIS we use (Autodesk) there is a combination with
Crystal Reports. It feels very strange, out of place and you would
need extra licenses. For that reason it is not in use very much -
whereas there would be a real need for a good GIS integrated reporting
tool in our organization.

This won't happen over night but it can be gradually improved.

- ---------

If we add python and expressions into the game and the HTML text box
you can already do a lot. You have the full HTML/CSS/SVG stuff
available. The major concern I have is about text flow and page
breaks. Currently these floatable HTML frames that can flow to a
different page just break in the middle of the content - e.g. a table
cell can be split across two pages - which is bad. I wonder if the
page/frame break situation can be improved with reasonable efforts?

- -----

btw: I agree with Matthias that it would be good to have these
aggregate functions as a QgsExpression.

Hopefully this thread will ignite a QGIS based reporting tool. My
organization would support such an effort financially and I would also
do testing and contribute ideas.

Andreas

Adding to QgsExpression doesn't make much sense as QgsExpression is only
based on a single feature.  You would need layer on top of if with
functions that can do aggregates.

That's also my aim, and hope.
Any taker? We do not need to build everything at once, there are a number of small
steps, as outlined by Andreas, that would already allow much.
Perhaps we should start a (wiki ;) ) page on specs?
All the best.

hi Luca,

It's seem that there are an error in QgsWpsDockWidget.py:34
We have : from wps.wpslib.processdescription import ..
We should have : from wpslib.processdescription import ..

You can correct it

Hi,

I would like to have spatial aggregation (which can not be done with the 
usual report generators). For example aggregated statistics on point 
features inside polygons.

Zoltan

Hi,

+1 from me for reporting tool for QGIS. This is important feature we
missed in QGIS. I proposed this idea some time ago (about year or
two) but didn't get much feedback. Now situation changed, much more
peoples are interested in such tool.

In terms of implementation, there is not only Jasper (which is Java), but
also other more or less powerful reporting tools/engines. For example,
there is a NCReports (C++/Qt), it has both commercial and opensource
versions (but AFAIK opensource one is a bit unmaintained), there is
OpenRPT (also C++/Qt, but without runtime report designer), QtRPT
(experimental), Exaro. Also there is a wonderful FastReports report engine,
but unfortunately it AFAIK Windows only, there is an opensource
crossplatform version called FreeReports.

I totally agree, it would be a plus if QGIS provided simple reports 
usable by anyone without programming or leaving QGIS. I am available for 
discussions and testing of such a "simple" report generator in QGIS as 
mentioned by Andreas.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673__hzkQNJeSQ3gKu_zHvLK0iv6hndbyL8FBkxmJr1EeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I started working on qgis server, trying to split GetStyles from GetStyle
as discussed yesterday.

While developing I'm encountering frequent crashes, now I wonder what is
the qgis-mapserver policy with segfaults? I  mean if they are triggered by
wrong query string parameters are they still to be considered as bugs?

I would say yes, but before wasting my time (and your time) in bug report
and fixes, I want to be sure.

A program should never segfault. Always a bug.

Users (even technical ones) have problems finding where plugins have
actually installed stuff - I've seen it first hand. By using a logical and
consistent approach, that issue is minimised. The biggest weakness of QGIS
in my mind is the fact that it's extremely hodge-podge and inconsistent
from the user-interface/user-experience perspective. Anything to fix that
is a good thing IMHO.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi,
I've gone through a small set of my bug reports - these ones appear like
they may be easy. However (a) I'm not a QGIS dev so don't know; (b) I don't
have tagging permissions anyway.

If they are and this "easy" issues thing takes off/is used, I can go
through the rest of my tickets too.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Reporting engine
Message-ID: <52CBF699.7030800@carto.net>

Hi,

I am starting a new thread on the reporting engine. As it generates a
lot of interest and the content is not related to attribute tables
anymore ...

I think it would be good to schedule a meeting at the next Hackfest in
Vienna.

Meanwhile it would be good to find out if the existing C++/QT based
solutions could be used from a licensing and from a technical point of
view. We could also start collecting requirements in a wiki. Or if it
may be wiser to write something from scratch based on our existing API
and the current Atlas functionality.

The question with the separate tools and libraries is if they could be
well integarted. Ideally the GUI would be in separate panels and
toolbars inside the QGIS print composer and not with a separate tool or
window.

Could someone open a wiki page for collecting the requirements and facts
about existing reporting tools? I am not too familiar with the new QGIS
infrastructure yet - just read you are migrating the content currently.

Thanks, Alex, for listing the C++ based options! Its a good start.

I had a very quick look on some of them. OpenRPT is GPL, which is nice,
but last update at Sourceforge from 2011 - not so nice. Or is QtRPT the
followup project?

Exaro does not show a lot of activity - last update 2009? Same for
FreeReport (last update 2002). I have severe doubts if a project hadn't
been updated for more thant tow years

NCReports seems to be quite powerful and advanced but I have doubts
about the license. Something to find out/negotiate.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Paolo and Jonathan,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

We should encourage plugin-authors to write a good get-started section 
in the description in their metadata. Or we could include yet another 
getstarted metadata section. I remember, I discussed another key 
"website" with Borys, which would be shown in a frame in the plugin 
description page. This could be used to show even pictures in a 
description. Or we could just embed the URL listed in homepage.

Why I think this is a better idea:

   * E.g. The processing plugin creates a new menu, this would not fit 
into the previously described scheme. (But the scheme could be adapted 
to contain an array of menu entries)
   * Plugins can have more than one menu entry (Sending them back to the 
plugins menu would totally fail to fulfill the requirements listed by you)
   * Evenmore: There may as well be plugins with no menu entry at all. 
(E.g. You could write a plugin just to add new attribute editor fields)

Optimally we should have a good guideline where we can point people to. 
And the plugin builder plugin should already help people to get this done.

So I would not say "anything to fix that" is a good approach, but a 
well-designed solution will be very welcome.

The other (technical) option which I can think of would be to define 
"access rights" or "hooks" which a plugin can acquire in the metadata 
section and then the app will be delivered with these. So a plugin could 
acquire the "Register a new toplevel menu item" or the "Register a 
vector menu item" or the "Register a new attribute editor widget" or the 
"Register a new raster pipe function" hooks. Smartphones use something 
like this for their permission management. While this offers some 
advantages (you can exactly list, what the plugin will do) it seems a 
bit over-engineered for this problem IMHO. And it would require to 
rewrite all plugins :) Therefore my preference: Solve it with human 
sense instead of technique.

Cheers
Matthias

If I'm understanding correctly, you're proposing that the explanations etc
be hosted online? From what I've picked up reading the lists and elsewhere,
QGIS is used in quite a few instances in locations where internet access is
lacking or merely unreliable. I think any help/explanation should be
integrated and distributed with the software.

So I would not say "anything to fix that" is a good approach

A poor choice of words on my part. Obviously a good fix is preferable to.
:-)
Cheers,
Jonathan

What about python-reportlab? A C++ implementation is not an absolute necessity.

Good point. Not necessarily, a get started text could be saved in the 
metadata as well. Or alternatively an html folder structure.

Or maybe a combination of on- and offline, so as long as the plugin is 
not installed, it would be loaded on-demand, so we don't need to 
transfer everything everytime we check for updates, but as soon as the 
plugin is installed it is loaded offline for machines without internet 
access.

But these are just ideas, I don't have any strong opinion about this (yet).

No worries, I just want to be sure we don't need to switch methods again 
in a couple of months ;-)

Hi Enzo,

I return to this old discussion because I noticed that the problem that I
described still remain the same when I use Qgis 2.0. On the contrary when I
use Qgis 2.1 all works fine.
I didn't  full understand this problem previously  because I use qgis 2.0
on my works PC and and 2.1 with linux on my laptop.

Anyway I resolve the problem whit Qgis 2.0 using your tip of QgsFeatureRequest
with NoGeometry flag, so the mail is just to keep track of the problem.

thanks again.
Luca

Yes - this looks interesting. More active, more features and BSD
license. Part of the libraries (e.g. XML parser) is GPL.

Something we should examine more closely.

Hi,

Maybe a side-effect of the recent changes around the confirmations and
undo rules in the legend: currently it is not possible to remove a group
in the legend.

See http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9308

Can others confirm?

Hi All,

I saw mention of this thread on Twitter via @underdarkGIS. To add another
similar plugin to the mix, we at Astun maintain a generic gazetteer search
plugin which provides Yahoo!, GeoNames and OSM Nominatim searches and
allows others to be added fairly easily. It's not an official plugin as yet
but it used by a number of local authorities in the UK who generally hook
it up to an address search. The code and details are available here:
https://github.com/AstunTechnology/QGIS-Gazetteer-Plugin.

The plugin was originally written by Nathan Woodrow and joint funded by
Astun Tech, Simon Miles from Windsor and Maidenhead Council (who runs the
QGIS UK User Group) and James Rutter at Surrey Heath Borough Council.

Cheers,

Matt.

I would love to see layer stats in QgsExpression. Then it'd be possible to
generate expressions which could compare individual features to the entire
layer - eg testing if a value is greater than the layer mean, etc...

There's already a bunch of non-feature specific functions in QgsExpression
and a lot of demand for even more.

Hi Martin,

I tested it and can confirm that the PostgreSQL pooling works fine and
fast now.

I see more than 4 Postgis connections though. But maybe these
connections are from other plugins using Postgis connections as well.

Good to see progress!

Thanks,
Andreas

I've  been following the evolution of WebGL support by Webkit since a lot
of time. Yet it's supported on few platforms, while it would require a
custom build to enable it in many others (with high chance to not
succeed!).
For the moment it doesn't seem to be an option for a wide adoption...

A positive note is the growing support on mobile browsers. Here a
screenshot on my Nexus with Firefox:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/couti1041gx2f5m/13891324843560.jpg

Touch navigation workd smoothly.

Thanks Minoru for this plugin. I had planned to develop something similar.
Now I will move to your code and (hopefully) I will try to contribute to it
;)

Hi xsc,
(sorry for sending it again, the images in the body exceeded the ML limit
for attachments)

the qgis-dev ML is in CC, that's the right place to discuss it as other
with the same problem can find the answer.

I guess you just miss the mapscript python module, you can install it from
the OSGeo4W setup.

Sent from mobile. Sorry for being short.

I could imagine aggregate functions as another layer on top of
QgsExpression instead of implementing the support directly into
QgsExpression. There could be a class that would deal with the whole
layer and register the aggregate functions to instances of the
expression engine where appropriate. This would keep the design clean.

> and a lot of demand for even more.

One thing I am worried about is the increasing number of custom
functions which make sense just in a particular context (e.g. in
composer). The issue is the fact that registering of functions and
setting "special columns" is done with static functions, therefore
affecting all instances of QgsExpression. Functions and special
columns valid in a particular context (field calculator, rendering,
...) should be made available only for instances where it makes sense.
I can imagine this as having "expression context" classes that would
extend the basic set of functionality of QgsExpression with more
functions. We could have contexts for:
- field calculator: $rownum
- rendering: $scale
- composer: "rendering context" + $map
- atlas: "composer context" + $page, $numpages, ...
- aggregate: min(), max(), avg(), sum(), count()
These contexts could be passed as a second parameter in QgsExpression
constructor.

Moreover, I am still not convinced that we need "special columns" in
QgsExpression - they should be handled as functions with zero
arguments to keep things simple.

I think we should fix these issues before adding more extensions to
QgsExpression, otherwise we may get into trouble in the future,
especially if multi-threaded execution will get more common. For
example, printing atlas pages in parallel would make things like $page
or $feature vulnerable to run conditions - e.g. sometimes it could
print everything correctly, other times all pages could have the same
number!

Martin

Hi Martin,

I also confirm I don't have any more trouble with too many connections.

This works like a charm!!!!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How wiki can be of help (or harm)
Message-ID: <52CCF6F6.8040108@faunalia.it>

A nice story, with happy ending:
* long ago, Etienne and I started a wiki page about possible
improvements on the colour ramps
* in the meantime, Etienne implemented most of the items
* as it often happens, the page got forgotten, buried among hundreds of
others, with a bunch of solved and unresolved issues
* luckily, the recent wiki cleanup forced me to reexamine it, and
together with Etienne we cleaned it up, moving all remaining issues to
tickets
* this prompted Etienne to solve a trivial, yet important from a user
point of view, long standing issue (in fact, there may still be another
ticket hanging out).
A trace here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1059#issuecomment-31800254
In short: cleaning up the wiki is a Good Thing.
All the best.

Hi Matt,
this convinces me more and more of the necessity of merging forces, to
have a common pluggable infrastructure in core.
Should we start a wiki page with all the specs?

Hi all.
In the field properties, it is possible to add a Calendar widget,
selecting a date/time format. However, the widget only shows a calendar,
therefore it is impossible to insert a time. This seems a bug:opinions?

Hi Paolo,

I'm currently working on a refactoring of the editor widgets, mainly to 
make them work asynchronously. This will make them much more pleasant 
to use and to maintain and open up new possibilities such as having 
non-modal attribute dialogs.

This means, that at the moment, I would not recommend to touch this 
code, but instead to wait for these changes to be merged. I will 
publish a branch for testing in the next days.

Amongst other things, also Issue #4417 [1] is solved, with code 
provided by Danial Vaz in the long-standing PR752 [2]

If there is sponsoring available for fixing the date-time issue, please 
let me know and I will happily include this in the refactoring work.

Best
Matthias

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u2HQH=f88HbxEiVGewHD-EovZneM8OH+neuXQ2ZN=t=gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm trying to build a windows customized package of QGIS but, given that
I'm not a code guru, I'm facing some issues.
I found this tutorial
link<http://linfiniti.com/2011/05/building-custom-qgis-installers-for-windows/>(thanks
Tim!) and I strictly followed it.
But when I type:

bash quickpackage.sh

so, at the end of the whole process, that's the error:

!insertmacro: macro "MUI_PAGE_LICENSE" requires 1 parameter(s), passed 0!
Error in script "QGIS-Installer.nsi" on line 232 -- aborting creation
process

I see that Tim's post is almost 2 years old, maybe something changes?
Someone knows where can I find a new updated tutorial?

BTW Debian 7.2 and I just cloned the QGIS repository this morning

Thanks

Cheers

Matteo

I guess this is due to recent changes in osgeo4w, including non-free
packages that require accepting a licence.
Isn't it documented in the manpage/readme?
All the best.

By the way - unless something has changed, the 'drag and drop' form
designer is badly named - it doesn't allow either dragging or dropping.
Perhaps it should be renamed to 'Interactive form designer' or something?

Hi

Paolo:
I haven't checked for #8818, #8820 yet, but didn't pay attention to 
solve them either... Let's see once it's finished. If there is still a 
problem, fixing should be easy and straightforward.

I will send you information in a PM soon.

We can rename it if the name "Interactive form designer" is clearer, I 
don't care (whereas the name "dual view" was admittedly a bad choice...) 
but you should be able to drag any field from the table on the left into 
the tree. Does that not work?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC first implementation of configurable search
	results output
Message-ID: <CAL5Q670Cay7YmEm5bAkVbet8p=EbX_QZR49Maicx2WppgEYsCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

as discussed a few days ago, I'm trying to implement a configurable output
for search results, it's now possible to show search results in left panel
(default), right panel, bottom panel and in a separate window.

I've published it in a branch (still work in progress), please give me some
feedback.

This is what I've done so far:

1. added an optional config var in GlobalOptions.js
var mapSearchPanelOutputRegion = 'popup' ; // Possible values:
default,right,bottom,popup, see
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/configurable_layout/site/js/GlobalOptions.js#L197

2. decoupled the search output from QGIS.SearchPanel, the search output is
now implemented with events and  listeners:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/configurable_layout/site/js/WebgisInit.js#L815
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/configurable_layout/site/js/WebgisInit.js#L890

3. added right and bottom regions, hidden and collapsed by default, these
panels are automatically activated when mapSearchPanelOutputRegion is
"right" or "bottom"

4. added an Ext alert modal in case of no results. I'm still looking for a
better solution, I'm sure that the user should be warned about "no records
found" but I'd rather prefer a spotlight message to a modal alert.


The default behaviour should be exactly the old one: search results under
the form in left panel.

This is the branch URL:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS-Web-Client/tree/configurable_layout

Hello Sir

Thank you very much for the reply and suggestions.

As suggested by you, I have found a bug to solve (
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9290). I was going through the source code and
the documentation provided, but things are clear to me only in "Bits and
Pieces".
I am not able to relate them.

Is there some way anyone can help me get through this?

I feel that once I am able to understand the *overall flow *of the code,
then I will be able to solve a lot more bugs.

Regards,

Kshitij Kansal

Guys,

We were also discussing another tag: about. Its main purpose was just what 
we're talking about: to guide the user how to use the plugin. It also allows 
to lighten the "description" tag by leaving only a brief note on the plugin 
purpose. Please see the example:
http://tmp.borysjurgiel.pl/description-about.png

Currently the plugin manager supports it for a test, but we didn't perform any 
broader discussion in Brighton, so it's "unofficial" and not implemented in 
the repository. We definitely have to discuss it here or in Vienna and either 
proceed or drop it. 

Regards,
Borys

I've no time now to to test plugin, but my recent experience creating a
complex plugin [1] where are interacting qgis<->python
plugin<->QtWebView(based on QWebKit or other rendering engine), let me say
that should be a great improvement if 3d is displayed in a QWebView
allowing interaction (signal and data exchange) with qgis and the 3d view.

my plugin was inspired by a "secret" work that a friend did in Brighton
hackfest... a really simple plugin to show data in D3... but he never
published it :(... that ideas are applied in my plugin, but mine is
something really complex and without didactic purpose.

Hi Gino. The world with D3 by Luca is a nice proof of concept. I will give
a look to yours soon.

As I already sais, AFAIK WebGL has very poor support in QWebView. Luca told
someone was able to make it work, with some tricks, on a Linux machine.
I've never tried. Anyway, it fkr sure doesn't work on Windows, at least
with Qt 4.7/4.8.
I hope someone has a better experience to share...

I download code_examples from svn,and build the

fail message:

I think I know the reason.
The plugin dir must be set
  QString myPluginsDir        = "/usr/local/lib/qgis/plugins";
  QString myLayerPath         = "dev/cpp/shape/bou1_4l.shp";
  QString myLayerBaseName     = "bou1";
  QString myProviderName      = "ogr";

Thinks for your attention.

Hi Alessandro

Pull request is applied. Good work!

One thing I noticed is that QgsProjectParser::getStyles uses 
QgsProjectParser::mapLayerFromTypeName. Like that, the styles are only 
returned for layers published as WFS. Is that intentional? Otherwise, 
QgsProjectParser::mapLayerFromStyle might be a better option, as it 
returns the layers published via WMS.

Regards,
Marco

No, it was not intentional, I will correct it.

A quick question: where are the API docs for the mapserver part?

I've found only this unofficial docs:
http://fossies.org/dox/qgis-2.0.1/classQgsSLDParser.html

maybe you forgot to push the changes.... I sent you a pull request

Right now the plugin not able to load getcapabilities request because

Don't know much about the public API docs, but my guess is that only the 
parts exposed via the public plugin API are present.

Message-ID: <52CE6D9F.1080900@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I'd like to improve the svg output of the composer, specifically:
(1) - put each layers in a separate svg group
(2) - fix #3975 (maybe with an option vectorise fonts yes/no to avoid 
breaking things in labelling)

To realize (1) I need to have some kind of action when the rendering of 
a layer starts. I'm considering the emission of a signal in 
qgsmaprenderer.cpp loop so that the impact on the rest of the code is 
minimal. I'll then have to create a custom QPaintDevice (based on 
QSvgGenator code) that will insert group tags in the svg when the signal 
is emmited.

I'm a bit worried in case of multi-threaded rendering since the layers 
are rendered in parallel, can someone give me some insight on this point 
? Is the multi-threaded/serial rendering dependent on the QPaintDevice 
beeing used ?

For (2) some insight from those who are familiar with the labeling would 
save me a lot of time.

Comments on the soundness of the design (or lack of it) are very welcome.

Cheers, and Happy new year to all.

V.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC and WMS FILTER in qgis mapserver
Message-ID: <CAL5Q6701nvWXstwvDJ=S2rv0KU59vKXCZXt+SSV7hc6m-o79eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to build an improved legend for QWC as explained in my previous
email.

The idea was to create an helper script (like those already existing for
search) that returns json data and base64-encoded images to allow building
of the legend on the client. The script currently query GetStyles to get
the classes and get the image for each RULE with GetLegendGraphic, so far
so good.

The legend is then cached on the file system for speed.

The important missing point is that I would be able to build an interactive
legend, so that the user can for example click on individual classes and
change visibility or maybe highlight or zoom to extent, this is why I need
FILTERS.

The work is almost done, but I've come to a stop with filter generation. I
can easily obtain ogc filters for each rule (they are in the SLD) but it
seems like the FILTER parameter in QGIS mapserver WMS follows its own
syntax.

The only option I see now is to convert OGC FILTER to the custom QGIS
FILTER syntax. This is easy for simpler rules but can become difficult when
rules have complex conditions.

Any idea or suggestion ?

Since OGC FILTER parsing is already implemented in QGIS, would it be
possible make the WMS understand OGG FILTER encoding in addition to the
custom syntax?

+1 from me, Anyway I would keep the custom mode too, which is simpler to
manage in most cases...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ortho line at specified line distance
Message-ID: <1389282616.3074.3.camel@pierluigi-Aspire-6930G>

Dear all
I'm looking for the best way to produce an ortho line to vector line at
specified along distance.

In past I did the same thing by grass using v.segment and connecting the
ortho points nodes.

what you suggest as best way to do that?

thanks in advance

Hi Pierluigi,
probably CAD Tools plugin is the right tool to do it

Hi Alessandro

 >Since OGC FILTER parsing is already implemented in QGIS, would it be 
possible make the WMS understand OGG FILTER encoding in addition to the 
custom syntax?

The problem is that the filter has the subset syntax of the data 
provider. So it would need translation OGC syntax -> provider syntax (or 
the possibility to choose between db server side filtering or QGIS side 
filtering with unified syntax).

Regards,
Marco

I thought this OGC filtering stuff was already implemented for WFS server
isn't it?

Hi all,

In the WFS standard FILTER parameter is defined to be an OGC FILTER 
encoding.
In the WMS standard there is no FILTER parameter if I remember correctly.

In the WFS QGIS-Server implementation, I have added the EXP_FILTER 
parameter which is used to filter features with a QGIS expression.

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Yes, that's what I meant with data provider filtering vs. QGIS 
filtering. WFS server uses QgsExpression (QGIS side filtering) while WMS 
takes the filter and sets the subset to the provider (db side filtering).
So it could be done by switching to QgsExpression depending on the 
filter format (pull requests welcome). Data provider syntax still needs 
to be supported because this kind of filtering is more powerfull and 
more performant.

Regards,
Marco

Ok, summarizing:

in WFS we have the standard OGC "FILTER" plus the  QGIS custom "EXP_FILTER"
in WMS we have QGIS custom "FILTER"

IMHO the best solution would be to have the same parameters also in WMS, so:

rename WMS QGIS custom  "FILTER" to "EXP_FILTER" and
implement OGC  "FILTER" even if it's not in the standard

Do you think that we can re-use the WFS OGC FILTER code for the WMS OGC
FILTER implementation?

As Andreas said before:
<This will not happen over night but it can be gradually improved.
I think that we could start by trasferring the already excellent management Table tools of the Print Composer in a independent management window (something like: Print -> Print Attribute Table) and then initiate a program of user information to understand the real needs, even in a part of the Qgis home page to highlight the wiki page mentioned by Andreas.
OT: following the example of Andreas, I was thinking to create 2 new threads for points 3 and 4 of my initial email to best manage ideas.

Any reason why you are trying to build such an old version of QGIS?

Is your code a plugin? Implementing the ortho line is quite easy (as you
can see from the code I pointed you to).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Approximation and geoprocessing
Message-ID: <52CFFD52.1040907@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I got into an interesting problem, before opening a few tickets I'd like
to discuss a line of action.
1. Some sw (namely geomedia) produces shapefiles with very slight
differences (same layer, modified and exported several times); I suppose
this is due to truncation/approximation in coordinate precision.
2. As a result, the diff between these layers produces a number of
virtually 0 width polygons, and some topological errors.
3. This in turn leads to 2 problems:
3.1. subsequent analyses fail because of the errors, and the user has no
clue about the reasons
3.2. The microareas are tricky and time consuming to remove (if they are
isolated, a possible solution is to select and remove those smaller than
an arbitrary threshold, but if they are linked to some "real" polygons,
this will not work).
I would therefore suggest a few improvements over the toolchain, i.e.:
* add a parameter in analyses, to either snap original data within a
threshold before running the analysis, or to clean up the results afterwards
* check & warn the user of topo errors in source layers, and of possible
wrong results; maybe this should be optional, as this will slow down the
analysis, and may be useless after first cleanup.

Sample data available for those interested.

All the best.

Hi,

I don't have a solution for the problem.

But I can confirm that the whole analysis chain is a bit problematic
with all these precision issues. As an example if you test intersections
of buildings against parcels (2 different layers) and the building
touches the parcel borders you may get very tiny intersects with parcels
(only a few square cms) and you wouldn't want to include these
intersections in your analysis.

So it would be cool if for geometry tests there could be a notion of
threshold values. If the area of an intersected polygon is below this
value it wouldn't be taken into account during the analysis.

These issues are really kind of show-stoppers and almost always require
intermediate steps to sort out these edge cases. It would be very handy
if the tools could handle this precision/uncertainty problems without
having to do a lot of intermediate steps.

Hi Martin,

I noticed that QGIS crashes (with the multi-threaded rendering) when you 
turn editing mode on for a layer if this layer exists several times in 
the legend (i.e. the same layer is loaded several times with different 
styles or whatever).

I observed this at least for postgres.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi,

I provided "eliminate sliver polygons" in the processing framework some 
months ago (thanks for your help, Victor!). Eliminate is based on a 
certain field. You would have to calculate the area (or area/perimeter) 
for all polygons and use that as a threshold in "Eliminate sliver 
polygons". No idea how to calculate that, though. How does the "Advanced 
python field caluclator work"?

Hi Bernhard,

there is a good article about Advanced Field Calculator [0], but
only in Russian (there is a Google Translate in the right sidebar).
Hope this helps a bit

Hi all,

If I understood correctly, someone added very recently the support of
QgsExpressions in the processing toolbox. This could help I suppose ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Font for tests
Message-ID: <52D02DE6.3080602@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I was looking at some of the tests, and realized, that the composerhtml 
test fails because of some slight font differences.

Firebug tells me that the following fonts are used (defined by 
bootstrap.css):

"Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif

I don't have any of these Helvetica fonts installed and I am not sure 
about their licensing, but it seems that no package includes them just 
like that. Does anybody know a font which is just available out of the 
box on all plattforms to get around such issues? Arial maybe?

This option seems much better to me than fixing things with a tolerance 
param.

Have a nice weekend,
Matthias

About a year ago, I added a custom built, very lightweight font,
FreeSansQGIS, just for tests [0], based off of FreeSans. Usage info is
explained in its README [1], notably that the font not be installed on the
system. It is intended to be loaded on-the-fly via Qt's font-handling
routines, and is already available in the utilities.py module via
loadTestFont() [2].

I have also added it to the startup functionality of the QGIS app and
server [3], which loads the font if the testdata directory is available,
e.g. when running ctest from build directory. Feel free to fix anything
wrong with my implementation.

Regardless, I have still seen differences in how the same font is drawn by
the different systems' window server, so some amount of tolerance (or a set
of anomalies) is probably always going to be needed. Though, hopefully
that's not a moving target because of the standardized test font.

Recently I came across another test font used by the MapServer project,
which we might also consider using because it also has bold face [4]. Not
sure how it compares to the 'normal' Vera font. However, I think if it is
used it should still be renamed to FreeSansQGIS to avoid conflict with
installed fonts, and make it easily searchable in the QFontDatabase.

We might also consider creating a Web font version of FreeSansQGIS.ttf
specifically to load into HTML tests.

The arial is not available on linux machines.

But the liberation Fonts are an Arial with an opensource licensing.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts
We use they usually with MapServer and qgis-server.

If interested, follow this link for the download.

Hi Denis

I have just tested with one postgis layer being loaded twice. Turning
editing mode on/off worked smoothly as expected. Could you please try
to track down in what cases it crashes? For example:
- does it happen only with postgis layers?
- must be the layer loaded multiple times in order to crash?
- what if rendering is not turned on when turning on editing mode?

Also, a backtrace would be useful...

Thanks
Martin

Any comment on this?

Should I file a [Feature] ticket?

Oh, so we have even three filter possibilities:

1. OGC Filter (done via QgsExpression )
2. Filter with QGIS custom syntax (done via QgsExpression)
3. Filter with provider subset with syntax of data provider (e.g. SQL). 
Done on provider (DB) side for very fast searches, therefore needs 
careful parsing against SQL injections

WFS server implements 1+2, WMS server implements 3. There are pros and 
cons for all of them, so it would be nice to have three parameter name 
to call all of them for WMS servers.

 >Do you think that we can re-use the WFS OGC FILTER code for the WMS 
OGC FILTER implementation?

QgsOgcUtils::expressionFromOgcFilter

Marco

So I suggest:

* build with current master or at minimum qgis 2.0.1 stable release
* send complete details of what operating system you are on
* send complete details of how you installed dependencies for QGIS

I suggest simply starting a new thread following my hints on how to write
an informative question earlier in this thread.

Regards

Tim

Hi

Has anyone used QGIS server on Apache 2.4 (I just upgraded from 2.2)? Would
you care to share your conf file so I can compare it to my own configs?

Thanks

Hi all,

A lot of commits are missing between january 1st and 11th on the repo. I 
suppose Alvaro forced an update since the whole is just after.

Who will take care of this ?

Hi Alexander,

thank you for the link. However it does not work in processing. Start 
the "Advanced Python field caluclator" from the tool box. Anything 
entered results in a Python runtime error:
"__init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (4 given)..."

Anybody successfully used this from processing?

Hi,

it depends...
Processing works as follows: take input layer(s) - do a process - create 
output layer
So if the "process" is a selection the result is an output layer with 
only the selected features included.
Therefore for "eliminate" I included a simple logical selection based on 
a field in the layer. Thus to use eliminate in a model you first have to 
create an input layer with a field that somehow marks all features to be 
eliminated (e.g. caluclate area/perimeter). Currently I do not know how 
this can be achieved. :-(
Any hints welcome.

Bernhard

I'm not sure what's happened here... this occurred after I accepted
pull request 1046. After I did this the commits from the 1st-11th were
still there, just out of order and pushed back onto the second page.
Now they've disappeared entirely :/

They are still in the log, but appear to be a year ago. So basically, 
we have commits from before 11.1.2013, followed by commits 
1.11.2014-11.11.2014, followed by 11.1.2013 - 1.1.2014 (including 
Alvaros commits) and then the new commits starting from 11.1.2014...

It is not a forced update (Alvaro has no push rights and Nyall did a 
simple merge) and the commits are not missing, the history just looks 
odd. If somebody knows how to fix that, please do.

Hi, I can not update the repo, I write pull requests that someone accept and merge after. I guess that's the right way to work, I manage something wrong with my pull requests?

e.g.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1046

Similarly, if it's something I've done wrong, please let me know - I'm
still finding my feet with git and it's more than possible I've made
some error.

Thanks Marco, now I hope I've got the whole picture.

Can we agree on the parameter names to use for those calls?

The only one which is in the official specs is WFS "FILTER", then we have
implementations for


OGC Filter  WFS="FILTER"
QGS Exp. filter WFS="EXP_FILTER"
QGS provider filter  WMS="FILTER"

I'm proposing this:

OGC Filter  WFS="FILTER", WMS="FILTER" (to be implemented)
QGS Exp. filter WFS="EXP_FILTER", WMS="EXP_FILTER" (to be implemented)
QGS provider filter  WFS="PRO_FILTER"   (to be implemented),
 WMS="PRO_FILTER" (to be renamed)


... I don't have any better idea for  PRO_FILTER but still don't like it,
any hint?


Note that this will break existing apps, if we are renaming the WMS FILTER
to PRO_FILTER (or something else)

Some general advice (althogh I'm not sure how exactly that happened) is to

For creating a pull request
===============
- always start a feature branch from current master
- if you are coding a feature branch, don't "merge" anything in
- before you create a pull request do "git fetch origin" and "git rebase 
origin/master" (given origin is the remote for upstream and not your own 
remote, check your .git/config or do "git remote -v | grep github.com/qgis")
- you may do a "git rebase" like in the last line repeatedly without 
doing any damage (as long as the only purpose of your branch is to get 
merged into master)
- Attention: After a rebase you need to "git push -f". CORE DEVS: IF YOU 
DO THIS ON THE UPSTREAM REPOSITORY YOU WILL BRING CAKE FOR EVERYBODY TO 
THE NEXT HF!

For merging a pull request
===============
Option A)
   - click the merge button (Creates a non-fast-forward merge)

Option B)
   - Checkout the pull request (See 
https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247)
   - Test (Also required for option A, obviously)
   - checkout master, "git merge pr/1234"
   - Optional: "git pull --rebase": Creates a fast-forward, no "merge 
commit" is made. Cleaner history, but it is harder to revert the merge.
   - "git push"

I hope that I got things right and that somebody finds this useful.

Best
Matthias

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.1 development cycle ends at 2014-01-24
(11 days away), we'll go into feature freeze and start the 2.2 release cycle in
which we'll do testing, bugfixing, translating and release preparations instead
of feature development for the 2.2 release. 

Please merge your new features before 2014-01-24 and prepare to start testing.
The 2.2 release will be on 2014-02-21 (39 days away).

Message-ID: <CALwGb1SD=HN=W2_jM_X_LVO1c5msD5q5z4E1DCZhwEJv36+HeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had a couple of questions that I was hoping could be answered here on the
mailing list. I am trying to write some code to find the current zoomed in
rectangular extent of my Map Canvas by the following pyqgis API function
<http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html#a878f0c387c9475d59c6aac425db01020>
 QgsMapCanvas.extent()

however I receive the error

TypeError: QgsMapCanvas.extent(): first argument of unbound method must
have type 'QgsMapCanvas'

Im not entirely certain what that is saying - first argument of unbound
method?

I want to apply this rectangular extent to the openlayers google earth
imagery and extract the current imagery as a spatially referenced raster
image. I dont know if anyone else has done this already or had some
suggestions? I was thinking that one could get the rendered image view in
the canvas and simply apply the extent mentioned above within the WGS84
datum?

Any help is appreciated,
Cheers,
Bjorn

Thanks Juergen for reminding this. Martin, does this mean multithreading

You should never do a rebase and a force push on a branch that is public
ever, ever.

If its public you should always merge.

You should NOT do this (and I did not want to say that you did)

"git push -f" is potentially dangerous (because it actually does edit 
the commit history and should not be used on shared repositories).
As I advised people to do this under certain circumstances (in a feature 
branch), I felt obliged to print a warning, where it should not be used.

Hi Matthias,

I think it is VERY usefull. But I also think we should create a
'git'-page in documentation which contains this info.

I think it would also be helpfull to show the (more general) git
commands for creating a local branch etc.

I'll try to create a page for that with the information above, and add
some stuff that I think is usefull.
Plz have a look into it when finished.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Merging something as major as multithreading this late in the game would
not be smart IMHO.  With our faster release cycle there is no harm in
holding this off until next release and we can test it fully and iron out
all the bugs.

I suspect that you are literally trying to call
"QgsMapCanvas.extent()" from Python, which is not possible. You need
to use an instance of QgsMapCanvas to call this (or any other) method.
The call you are doing would be possible only if the extent() method
would be a static method of the QgsMapCanvas class. Try this in QGIS
python console:
>>> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
>>> mc.extent()

I am still working hard on it and I hope that in about a week of work
it should be ready for merging. I am aware of the fact that some bugs
will probably pop up, but there is still fairly long window for bug
fixing prior to the release.

In case of you, Martin, being convinced, that it is stable enough and 
provided there is an easy switch to enable/disable mt-rendering 
(default of this switch should be discussed a week before releasing) +1 
for merging from my side.

Kind regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] attribute table issues
Message-ID: <1389609339760-5097703.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi there, 
as feature freeze is coming, I raise an issue i didn't find in the lists or
in the tracker. 
When working with attribute table, I had many problems on a classical use
case. I just explore attribute table, filter, order, and then select lines,
and zoom on the map. 

- selection of lines is very slow even for small tables. Do we need to
trigger redraws when the selected features are not in current canvas?
Anyway, selecting/ unselecting is to slow

- selected line(s) are grey, and my eyes can't see a difference with other
non selected lines. I liked old blue 1.x color. 

- When selecting a set of feature (using maps tools or expression), my first
idea is to explore the selected fetaures one by one. So I click on one and
then will zoom on the feature, but this refreshes current selection. When
displaying only selected items, I loose then my set of selected objects.
What is the right workflow? Is there a way to convert a manual selection set
into a filter? Or could we add a contextual click to 'zoom on the feature',
not modifying current selection? 

Tell me if I need to open tickets or if someone is already on it. 
Cheers, 
R?gis

How about using the selection color?

I'd just add to your notes that IMHO the current attribute search is much
less usable than the old one, I feel that the most frequent operation is
filtering but you have now to dig into the combo and choose "column filter"
to actvate one, while in previous versions the filtering functions were
immediately available.

Hi Bernard, 
I'm not aware that selection color applies to attribute view. My concern is
not about map object but attribute lines highlight. Did I miss one option?

Hi,

The too small color difference is actually a "focus" issue with the
qt-library and I believe it is not so easy to fix.

There is already a bug report here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8205

If you have an idea how to fix this, please re-open the bug and comment.

This might help to explain a few things:

Basically nothing is wrong as the order is not always in the date order

Could it be that b4d082f9 and 860e23afc7 have wrong date Jan 12 2013?
The 860e23afc7 has parent 0c6d9ef90 with Jan 12 2014.

The selection for big tables should be considerably faster than before 
(that was also confirmed by Vorarlberg in a recent user meeting), 
because only the selection delta is communicated. It also works fairly 
fast on small tables here, so I am not sure where the latency you 
experience is coming from.
If you assume that a repaint is the issue, have you tried if the 
multithreading branch makes a difference? It is well possible, that this 
solves the issue, because the UI stays responsive, even when a new 
rendering job is scheduled.

This seems to be a windows issue (see ticket referenced by Andreas). I 
think it should be possible to overwrite the stylesheet for this 
environment. The ticket has been reopened.

Context-menu "zoom to feature" would be great.

Richard this kind of stuff should go in the CODING doc. I have already
added some infor on Pull Requests there  following our previous to last PSC
meeting, and just updated it with Matthias' notes too. I'm just waiting for
my internet to allow me to actually push it.....

What would be the solution to this?
Promoting the columns to top-level items instead of second-level items?
Or having a single toplevel "Search" item, which searches on all columns?

Hello Matthias,

Unfortunately I'm not a UX expert, I just noticed that doing one of the
most common operations on attributes is IMHO harder than before.

It would be great if those of us who have more experience in collecting
user's feedback (i.r. during courses or trainings) could ask the users they
meet what is their feeling about this.

But what I would like to see is something like this:

Thank you Tim,

Small change:

"Don't merge anything in other than master"
I would remove "other than master".
Instead of merging in master, one should rather rebase on top of master 
like explained in the lines below. This keeps the history cleaner.

Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multi-threaded version and attribute table
Message-ID: <52D3E207.2040903@carto.net>

Hi Martin,

I tested the multi-threaded version with the latest version from git
regarding the attribute table. I noticed a problem when loading the
features for the table. It loads extremely slow, approx. 4 features per
second. It looks like each of the thread just loads one feature at the
time, or something similar. A table of 60'000 features which I tested
would take forever.

Is this a known issue?

Thanks for having a look at this.

Andreas

I should have mentioned that I tested with a Postgis layer. With
SpatiaLite it works much faster.

Hi,

Here it is rather slow, but not that bad (~25sec for a 25'000 rows layer)

Hi,

There is more information:

Postgis table works fast if the "Select at ID" checkbox is turned off.
If it is turned on it is unbelievably slow - loading only 1 to 4
features at the time.

The "Select at ID" has something to do with the local caching of the
table, doesn't it?

Hi Matthias, 
thanks for the answers. I didn't test multithread branch, but I did with
A.Huarte's. 

thanks for reopening the windows issue. The contextual right clic would be
great. 

I'll keep testing with new builds. 
Cheers
R?gis

For dataproviders which don't support SelectAtId, a locally cached copy 
of the complete dataset is made for the lifetime of the attribute table 
(because on-demand loading while scrolling would require a new full 
scan)
For others, the whole dataset is loaded, but only a certain number of 
features (10000 by default) are cached locally.

Hi,

I have implemented a fix for the windows issue. But I am not able to 
test it right now. Can a Windows user test this PR?

Alessandro, thank you for the mockup.

The issue I see with this is, that the filter is defined in two 
different locations (in opposite corners of the window).
This would probably be thought of as a two-step approach ( 1: Filter for 
visible features 2: In addition, filter for features containing 
"Australia") where the two conditions would probably be connected by 
AND. I am not sure if this makes things easier ("Why is Australia not 
listed? Ah yeah, I have to change back to "Show All". Or: "Why are not 
all features shown even though I see a button saying "Show All").

However, these are only my thoughts and I probably do have a strongly 
biased developers view.

I see your point, even if I think that as long as the "visible feature" is
not activated by default, the user is within the same single task: he will
probably recall that he has already set a filter ("visible features) and
quickly recognize why he's not seeing what he expected.

Other solution would be to put both in the same bottom line, do we have
enough horizontal space?

... or maybe just go back to 1.8 layout with the two bottom lines, with the
combo instead of the checkboxes.

No problem.

It seems to be fixed by:

git filter-branch --env-filter 'if [ $GIT_COMMIT =
"b4d082f97d82140c55a9b0afee5db06227b9c6b3" ]; then export
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="1417450920+1100"; export
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="1417450920+1100"; fi; if [ $GIT_COMMIT =
"860e23afc70b804b7ddc3f2e98f88e7ee5ac995b" ]; then export
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="1417450860+1100"; export
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="1417450860+1100"; fi' 224e34010aa..HEAD

Note that checksums of those two commits and all following commits will change.

Then you need to be courageous enough to run the very dangerous git
push -f. I am not. Please verify everything 10 times before push.

Could please someone third try to run the command above and confirm
that it corrects the dates and does not do any damage and can be
followed by git push --force?

I am not git expert.

Until we fix that, please do not commit to GitHub and preferably do
not comment commits after the problematic commits because checksums
will change.

Wait a moment the date is wrong as you probably noticed, I have messed
month with day. I'll post new version soon.

The threading branch has not been updated with recent changes to QGIS
master, so the attribute table is still affected by bug #8851 (fixed
in master in meanwhile). Maybe you could cherry-pick the fix in your
local copy in the mean time:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/c0b8e9abdf17c16a18235983688eee6104ce744e

Soon I will be updating the branch to catch up with the master branch
- there will be conflicts mainly with Alvaro's work (which seems to be
still in progress).

If yes, -1 to execute this unless there is an option which does not 
change checksums.

Hi Alessandro,

Thanks for the changes. Do you have an existing test installation
publically available. The GlobalOptions.js contain quite a few different
settings that wouldn't make it compatible with the demo projects in the
main branch. So it is a bit of work to set up your copy at my machine.

I would prefer if I could have a look at an existing working installation.

I have some questions below:

Does this concern the builtin search method that uses QGIS server? The
one in the panel on the left?

yes - maybe we should introduce a messaging system like in QGIS desktop
with a message bar that pops up at the top of the map panel but does not
block the interface. Until then you could use the status bar at the bottom.

Thanks,
Andreas

Not yet sorry, will be probably available in a couple of weeks.

My intention was to make all possible configuration parameters optional, so
that QWC can run with minimal (ideally no) configuration.
Your difficulties mean that I've failed :)
All new settings I've introduced are tested for
typeof('nameofsetting')=='undefined' and shouldn't be mandatory or have
smart defaults.

Yes. Default is just the old behavior, but now the user can config QWC to
show results in bottom, right and in a Ext window.

Yes, that was the idea, but I've already looked for an Ext solution in the
past without finding one. I'm too lazy to code one from scratches.

I'm now changing QGIS.SearchPanel to handle empty values if allowBlank is
True.
As always in web forms it's difficult to tell a blank from a null but I
would like to allow partial searches in the form when allowBlank is true
for some fields.
I think I will just add an optional configuration variable to define the
default behavior.

Hi, Martin, the proposed pull request #1053 (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1053) rewrite, among other things, the simplification API applying advices from Matthias Kuhn.?This pull request configures the simplification using a new class called "QgsSimplifyMethod" and "QgsFeatureRequest" class rollback to previous state from merged pull request #980 (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/980). Now, I think that will be fewer conflicts.

Whether Matthias agrees I suppose that it will been merged soon :-). I would like to help if you have any questions about any of conflicts.

Alvaro

Well - I did not really try. To be honest. I was just wondering if there
was an instance already set up that I can test.

I just saw the italian search configuration (CatastoFabbricatiSearch)
and assumed that it would not work with the small demo projects we have
(the hello world and natural earth example).

If you would put a compatible test project with a spatialite db in the
projects file I could more easily test the new search system. Even
better would be if you could enhance the existing projects (e.g. natural
earth) and provide a working search demo with this project. It would be
easier to merge with the main branch later on.

Thanks,
Andreas

I am not sure, maybe better, "git log --topo-order" should always give
correct order but after a while we will forget about messed dates and
reading log may become confusing.

Commit checksums are calculated from commit metadata including date.

Anyway, the correct command to fix it should be:

git filter-branch --env-filter '
  if [ $GIT_COMMIT = "b4d082f97d82140c55a9b0afee5db06227b9c6b3" ];  then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="1389504120 +1100";
    export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="1389504120 +1100";
  fi;
  if [ $GIT_COMMIT = "860e23afc70b804b7ddc3f2e98f88e7ee5ac995b" ]; then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="1389504060 +1100";
    export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="1389504060 +1100";

I will do, the only thing that it's not possible to test this way is
postgis related stuff in PHP.

Can we change minimum required GDAL version from current 1.4.x to
1.8.0 released in January 2011?

It is necessary for https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1066 (raster
values scale and offset). It can also be made conditional of course if
1.8 is too recent.

Hi!

gdal packages:

debian: 1.9.0-3
ubuntu LTS 12.04: 1.7.3
ubuntu LTS 10.04 : 1.6.3

I think 10.04 is more or less dropped anyway .. but there is still the
12.04 ubuntu release (desktop support until 2017)

But in favour of the ubuntugis repository I'd say 1.8 is a compromise
looking at the upcoming 14.04 LTS.

Do we follow ubuntu releases? LTS? Is there a decision? PSC?

regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map Canvas Current Zoomed Extent

Related to the second portion of my question regarding getting an image of
the rendered canvas extent as an output i've tried to implement the
following as modified from the pyqgis handbook

from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtXml import *

output = r'C:\output.png'

mc = iface.mapCanvas()
rect = mc.extent()
img = QImage(QSize(800,600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
color = QColor(255,255,255)
img.fill(color.rgb())
p = QPainter()
p.begin(img)
p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
render = QgsMapRenderer()
render.setExtent(rect)
render.setOutputSize(img.size(), img.logicalDpiX())
render.render(p)
p.end()
img.save(output,"png")

however the resulting image that I receive is simply a blank white image
(from the im.fill step) in addition im not entirely sure how the size of the
QImage can be related to the current extent rect? 

Again any help would be appreciated,
Cheers,
Bjorn

Ubuntu precise has only 1.7.3.

You also need to specify what layers should be drawn by the
QgsMapRenderer you create:
render.setLayerSet( ... )
The argument should be a list of layer IDs. You can get list of layers
from map canvas like this:
layers = mc.mapRenderer().layerSet()

> (from the im.fill step) in addition im not entirely sure how the size of the

Basically the extent says which part of the world to draw, the size of
the image says how big the resulting rendered image should be. So they
are independent.

IMHO the approach should be different: eliminating features a posteriori is always
feasible, but very inefficient, and it does not solve the "mouse tail" problem: a
valid feature is created, but attached to it hangs a close-to-zero-area that results
from different approximation of coordinate values.
This may seem a corner case, but is indeed preventing effective analyses in real cases.
All the best.

Agreed, this is a good approach IMHO.
Should I open a ticket?

Hi, I've set helloworld as default and deleted all my stuff.

There is initial sqlite search support but I had not time to solve the
spatialite PHP support problem (permission denied when loading spatialite
extension from PDO).
You can test the search output options though.

Hi

I approved it, but note that there are some issues that may make it
difficult for your users:

* it does not gracefully handle missing shapely dependency
* the main dialog's vertical orientation without and ability to scroll
makes it impossible to see the bottom (or click on any buttons etc.)

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I've seen the other thread about VoGIS Profiltool. Do we should write
a mail for asking an approval ?
Because I uploaded my first plugin last Tuesday and I don't have any news.
Actually, I don't really know in my plugin is is in the queue.

agreed, that eliminate does not solve the "mouse-tail" problem. It aims 
at getting rid of sliver polygons resulting from processing input layers 
having been digitized on different maps or scales.

No problems  here but try posting the complete build log it might give us
more clues. And also include the details of OS and QGIS versions you are
building with.

?Hello everyone ,?
?I did a project on Qgis -plugin development using the python API and Qt-Designer and it was an Awesome experience.now i am trying to develop standalone QGIS using the python API and Qt-designer as i used in the plugin development.
the reason for my development is?
1. i didn't want direct database editing and i want to put a middle-ware ?
2. i want to have more rich and simple GUI?
3. i want to add authentication module?
so am looking for a material to start standalone development and it is not that much i could found on the internet and?if there is a way to achieve this requirements using the plugin approach please let me know.?
?

Best Regards,

Hi all.
QGIS 2.2 release getting closer, I wonder what is our policy for blockers (about 30 now):
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?priority_id=10&set_filter=1&status_id=o&subproject_id=!*
Are we going to release even if blockers are still open? Otherwise, it seems unlikely
to have predictable release times.
In any case, I invite everybody to have a look to the list, and consider finding the
time or the money to fix some of these.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

I've tested with 1.8, 2.0.1 and 2.1.0 on W7, OsGeo 6.5, OsGeo 7.0 and
vanilla Ubuntu 13.10 (with only QGIS installed) and have never come across
an issue with shapely.

Any advice on how to get QGIS without shapely for testing?

Regards,
Wilhelm

I think I was testing on OSX using QGIS installed by brew. You could simply
temporarily remove your shapely package, start the plugin and see where the
error is being raised and then trap it with an ImportError.

I need a help from a python guru. I'm trying to move my first steps with
pyqgis.

I've got two qgis layer with a 1 to many relation. I create a custom form
for the parent layer with a QTableWidget that contain the primary key of
the child layer. Now I want to open another custom form with the data of
the child record selected into the QTableWidget. I try to look up into the
QGIS API Documentation but I'didn't find the solution to my problem.

Now I just can open form with this code, connected with a button:

    path = os.path.dirname( os.path.abspath( __file__ ) )
    uifile = os.path.join(path , my_form.ui')
    window = uic.loadUi(uifile)
    window.exec_()

how can I connect my form with the right data ?
Can I use some method to select the right layer/record and open it in the
form ?

Thanks in advance for any tips

Luca

Hi Luca,

The best way to do this, is to set your personnally designed UI file in 
the layer properties->field properties->attribute editor layout->provide 
ui file

Then, you want to call qgis method to show a feature form:
http://qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html#aff2467aa3cefd8fc5b59213f385b7180

And you would need some processing to show it:
1. get feature id from the selected line
2. fetch the feature of the main layer
3. get the foreign key from one of its fields
4. fetch the corresponding feature
4. show the feature form with it


Anyway, if I understand properly, you're trying to do something which 
has been recently added to QGIS (it's in the master version), it's 1:n 
relations.
See here for more info:

Cheers,

Denis

Hi denis,
thanks a lot for the tip,I'll try it immediately.

I know the brand new "1 to many" feature present in qgis 2.1 and it's
gorgeous, but as I know it works only with autogenerate forms, but I need
to use a custom forn because I have some code into it.

many thanks
Luca

Hi Luca,

Since two months, it does support custom ui form [0]

You have to place a widget in your form and a dynamic property to the 
widget.
You call it qgisRelation and set it to the id of the relation.

Cheers,

Denis

yeah !
IMHO the 1 to many feature is one of the best improvement of the 2.1 qgis
version. It solve to me a lot of work's problem.
Qgis Rulez!

I tried your tips and now all works fine.
Usually the problem for me is moving into API class reference. I need to
study it deeply.
Thanks a lot

Luca

Exactly.  We should try to fix all we can to the release date.  But unless
there is something really severe, whatever we have at 2014-02-21 (38 days away)
will get released as 2.2.

So everyone should participate in the test phase starting in ten days
(2014-01-24), test, report as good as possible to get QGIS into the best shape
on release day.

Starting to test after the release will only help 2.4.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer's legend layers title is using layers
 metadata and not title
Message-ID: <1389720280140-5097997.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi again,
In master, we updating legend content in a map composer, my layers get
metadata's title and not layer's title. 
IE: layer "Departement" with metadata's layers "d?partements IGN NE PAS
DIFFUSER" gets the second item in composer's legend. 

Is it a confusion ? If intended, i'm afraid this will give a lot of work to
users, and that this is far more complex than only pressing F2 on a layer in
map window to give it a usable name.
For me metadata must be kept for metadata use case. 
Should I file a ticket?

Hi Anita,

could you be a bit more specific about your setup?
I tested the lasted version on Windows with 1.8 and 2.0.1 (Standalone
installer) without problems.

Cheers,
Wilhelm

Sure, Win 7 + QGIS 2.0.1 from OSGeo4W installer. It's the first time I've  
seen an error like this.

Hi all.
I noticed the current dialog for Save as... for vectors should be improved:
* there is a lot of empty space in the middle
* the "More Options >>" button is non-standard, as it opens a side block with panels,
mostly empty
* IMHO the general appearance should be similar between this dialog and the Save
as... for rasters.
Should I open a ticket on this?
All the best.

Hi,

I would like to know if any of you (strk?) had a thought on the use of 
Tiny WKB inside QGIS's memory layer, it's a format created by Nicklas 
Av?n and included in PostGIS 2.2's trunk

To sum up, TWKB is a compressed binary format that allows to :
- control of the decimal precision
- relative coordinates
- id stored in the geom

The main advantages are :
- weight reduction, even for a single point
- no time wasted computing the edge position at 
6589786.35633001290261745 when your viewscale's resolution is over 1m

I think it is similar to the work done by Alavaro Huarte as it seems to 
be a way to improve display's efficiency without significant loss.

Blog posts about the format :

Thanks.
I just checked with 64bit OSGeo4W (Express Install).
No problems.

Have you done a custom install and maybe manually deselected any
dependencies?

Wilhelm

Subject: [Qgis-developer] List of geometries corrupted when given as a
	function parameter.
Message-ID: <52D696DD.7080806@espaces-naturels.fr>

Hi to all,


I'm working with QGIS 2.0.1 on a python plugin to help users enter data 
in a Postgis database.
Among others things, this plugin can convert selected features (from 
points to polygons, from lines to points, etc...)

_The plugin :_
operation_dialog.py is my main module.
convert_geometries module is used to convert features

In this second module, convert_geometries function accepts 2 parameters :
geomlist (a list of geometries),
geomoutput, (output data type : Qgis.point, Qgis.polygon ou Qgis.line).

extract :
/def convert_geometries(geomlist, geomtype):
      ret = None
      if len(set([geom.type() for geom in geomlist])) <> 1:
          print [geom.type() for geom in geomlist]
          ret = None
      else :
          if geomlist[0].type() == QGis.Line and geomtype == QGis.Polygon:
              ret = linestrings_polygon(geomlist)
.../

If geometries in geomlist have different data types, then ret=None (and 
the plugin manage this error).
Else, if features are lines and polygons are needed, corresponding 
conversion function is started.

convert_geometries is started from my main module :

/geom2=convert_geometries([feature.geometry() for feature in 
self.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()],geom_output) /

Here, geomlist is a list of geometries from features selected by user in 
the active layer).
geomtype=geom_output (selected by user in a combobox).

_The problem :_ Things go well if only one feature is selected. However, 
if 2 or more features of the same type are selected, (3 lines for 
example), geometries are systematically corrupted during passage from 
one module to the other, except the last one.

In the main module, this line :
? /print [feature.geometry() for feature in 
self.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()]/ ?
returns [1,1,1] (which means [line , line, line]).
However, in convert_geometries, ? /print [geom.type() for geom in 
geomlist]/ ? line returns [3,3,1]
(that is [unknowm geometry, unknowm geometry, line]).
If I try to display geometries in WKT format (/print [geom.exportToWkt() 
for geom in geomlist]/), QGIS closes without an error message.

_Question :_
Thus, if a list of several geometries is given in function parameter, 
they seems to be corrupted (except the last, or if there is only one 
geometry)

Do you have an idea of what happens ? Where is my mistake? Do you see 
tests to perform in order to diagnose this issue ? (particularly, why 
the last geometry of a list is not corrupted, unlike others ?)

Thanks for advance

That sounds very good to me! 
Potential impacts:
 - need to be able to edit default precision when creating such datasources
(processing output, new memory layer plugin)
 - memory layer saver plugin saves a raw binary data to qt datastream. What
about version compatibility issues?

Hi Vincent,

Is it possible that you are hit by the bug in this report [1]

The workaround would by to keep a reference to the encapsulating 
feature as long as you need their geometries. (Or possibly to copy the 
geometry with g = QgsGeometry( feature.gemetry() ))

Best
Matthias

Hi Wilhelm
I updated my QGIS install with default dependencies as they are installed
by the osgeo4w advanced installer.
Now the voGIS profileTools is installed without errors. It seems like
shapely has been updated since my last install?
regards
Josef

Thanks again for testing.
Don't know about any changes in the OSGeo4W Installer though.
I'm using the Standalone Installer mostly.

Are you using version 1.8.3 or 1.8.4 of the plugin?
1.8.4, where I'm checking for missing shapely, is not approved yet.

However you can get it here:
https://github.com/BergWerkGIS/VoGIS-Profil-Tool/raw/master/VoGisProfilTool/VoGisProfilTool.zip

Wilhelm

Hi all.
I have been reported some errors in Oracle data entry. Apparently it is impossible to
insert data in DATE field, as follows:

=====================
"Impossibile applicare le modifiche al vettore ZONA_RECUPERO

Errori: ERRORE: 1 geometria non aggiunta.

  Errori della sorgente dati:
      Errore Oracle nell'aggiunta di geometrie:Errore Oracle: Impossibile inserire

    Errore: INSERT INTO

VALUES (:f,'23005869',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'10/04/2014','10/12/2999',NULL,NULL) "
=====================

I cannot access an Oracle db, so the question is: is this supposed to work? Does
somebody use it successfully?

All the best.

Check the NLS of the connection.
If the connection don't declare an NLS , it will use the default NLS.
I guess the NLS in american or english and don't understand dd/mm/yyyy

I did the advanced install but did not (knowingly) deselect any
dependencies.

Maybe this trace helps:

Hello Matthias,

Just one question :
How many meters high, the statue? :-)

I've stumbled on this problem for three weeks!
Indeed, this is the right code :

/geom2=convert_geometries([//_QgsGeometry_//(feature.geometry()) for 
feature in self.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()],geom_output)/

Adding QgsGeometry() makes the plugin work perfectly with one or many 
features selected.

Thanks a lot!!
Best regards.

Vincent

Thanks for the Stacktrace.

Looks like the problem with missing shapely I took care of in version 1.8.4.
Did you use 1.8.3 or 1.8.4?

Message-ID: <52D77DB3.9060207@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
To the best of my knowledge, our make clean command, available through
the Processing subplugin:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processinglwgeomprovider/

is the most effective method to clean up invalid geometries.
I would therefore suggest to include it in master, in order to have it
available straight away for everybody.
This depends on lwgeom, available at least on Debian and Windows.

Opinions? Any blockers?

All the best.

good stuff! a Processing provider would be much welcome. The
availability of packages for many platforms will be the limiting factor
for its spread, however. Do you know if the authors have plans to
package it for e.g. Debian and OSGeo4W?
Thanks.

Hi,

did you configure the wsgi scripts to match your database and did you 
provide the search tables in the database?
Both is described in the README (section 6) [1]

I have recently made a Homebrew formula for Mac that allows liblwgeom to be
built without Postgres/PostGIS installs (a bit of a hack, actually). So,
the standalone lib is now readily available on Mac OS X as well [0].

+1 for this to be included in QgsGeometry or similar class.

It would help solve labeling issues where the extents-clipped geometry is
invalid. Would slow rendering down, of course, but would be good to have as
an option for faster machines and print jobs. Note: the validity fix would
be applied to the duplicates of feature geometries, which are used by PAL.

It should be applied only when the test IsValid fail.
This should limit the slowness.
Also pay attention that something the result of a MakeValid on an Invalid
poligon could be a MultiPolygon or also a Collection.
So to use it in an automatic manner need to apply also a
ST_Multi(CollectionExtract(ST_MakeValid(geometry),3)).
To be sure that it is always a geometry of the same kind.

Thank you. I was wondering how to do that!

I suppose that would be for the QgsGeometry class function(s) to handle,
thereby just returning an array of same geom type passed in, or returning
whether the fix was actually done and assigning any results to a referenced
variable.

Larry

Hi,
including it into processing is better than putting it as a separated
plugin, it depends on processing.
If there are no objections, please open a new pull request.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] matplotlib ascii errors when using OSGeo4W install
Message-ID: <CAJg9Up6yxopsnC6Mb8H+-f53kmGajLkjB2_bTOy_uh+xJweuKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recently reinstalled QGIS 2.0 and 2.1 from the OSGeo4W advanced install.
Now I get some ascii errors when importing some matplotlib modules. I have
narrowed it down to the import of matplotlib.fontmanager:

*import matplotlib.font_managerTraceback (most recent call last):  File

I have tried to reinstall matplotlib (from OSGEo4w 64-bit). No difference.

Any ideas?

Josef

Hi Paolo!

* What do you mean by "lot of empty space in the middle" here is only a 
very small stripe
* "mostly emtpy" -> it is filled on demand depending on how many options 
are provided by the format. - try to save as SpatiaLite

The only (currently) unfortunate thing is that the More Options button 
is not shrinking the window again if you press it again .. So once the 
extended options are opened you should leave them switched on.
If anyone has a good idea howto solve it .. suggestions welcome.

The original intention was to make the dialog as small as possible and 
not annoy novice users with extended options they might never need. Per 
default there should be no need to use the "More Options" button. Every 
format should have reasonable defaults now (if not tell me and I am 
going to change it).

I am not 100% happy with that layout either but it was the best we 
(Matthias and me) could make at that moment.

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with standalone python script and PostGIS
	Layers
Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F558B5AFB97@fmexch2.fylkesmannen.local>

Hello all,

I have a standalone python script that creates a bunch of PDFs for me.

Recently this script has developed an issue. It uses QGIS-dev so it could be related to some of the changes in master recently as it works fine with QGIS 2.0.

It makes about 42 PDFs then it stops.

It is not actually crashing as such, as you can see it running in task manager. It stays running using between 0 and 2% processor, and fluctuates a little with memory use (around 108840kB). But it does not produce any more PDFs. It is like it is stuck.

>From the log file that my script creates, I know that it is hanging with this line of code:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres")

If I try and connect to the database using DB Manager in QGIS or pgAdmin III while the script is still running, I get an error saying there is already too many clients already. If I kill the process in windows task manager, I am then able to connect to the database using DB manager.

Has anyone any suggestions as to what is wrong here? Is this a bug?

I updated QGIS dev this morning using the OSGeo4W installer (its revision is eb9ce3a).

	console
Message-ID: <DUB110-W461C9CE0A74C388444E59082B90@phx.gbl>

Hello,
I'm working on a plugin that will aim to ensure that the following steps either "transparent" to the user with one click:    1. Creating a table with predefined fields    2. Record in this table in postgis, then open in Qgis    3. Changing the properties (especially the properties of the fields tab) this layer to:           - Set "Edit widget" of fields           - Associate a form created with Qt Creator
For steps 1 and 2 is OK.
However despite researches in the qgis' Cookbook and forums, I haven't find functions that allow me to carry out step 3 using the python console ...
Have you any idea ?
Thanks for the answers in advance!

Hi,

I have no idea, where this is located on Windows...
but you need to adapt the wsgi files you downloaded from github with QWC 
to your db settings (see section 6.2)!

Bernhard

P.S. please try to reply to the list

I set up Apache config file:
insert following lines:
- LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
and

 WSGIScriptAlias /wsgi C:\OSGeo4W\apache\htdocs\qgis-web-client-master\wsgi
 WSGIScriptAliasMatch ^/wsgi/([^/]+)
"C:\OSGeo4W\apache\htdocs\qgis-web-client-master\$1.wsgi"


, after this I create tables in Posgis and modify connection string in
search.wsgi and getSearchGeom.wsgi.

Now when I run web page and try to search in search box I get this error:

Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain:
 "http://localhost:89/qgis-web-client-master/wsgi/search.wsgi?query=&searchtables=&query=89&cb=stcCallback1001".

Hi,

try to enter the url of the wsgi-script directly in your browser and see 
what it returns, check QWC's log file for any errors of the wsgi script.

Hi,

I wonder why the query parameter is included twice but on my server 
(Linux, though) it does not matter...
Anyhow I _think_ the script is not executed but I cannot help here. 
Maybe you want to search the web for "wsgi" and "Windows"

Bernhard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] matplotlib ascii errors when using OSGeo4W

OK, somehow the problem is fixed. I really do not know what happened and
why it starts working but along the way I tried removing the .matplotlib
folder in my user local settings. I also tried a fresh QGIS install from
the 64-bit standalone installer (2.0.1-3) and then the same from the 32-bit
standalone installer. Matplotlib was OK again after the 32-bit install,
even _after_ I uninstalled the 32-bit version.

Hi,

If you get the source code of the Python File than it means that the
wsgi module is not enabled or correctly configured.

But as Bernhard said - at the beginning you really have to work in
manual mode - not directly in QGIS web client. You will have to make
sure that the database is properly set up, the database connection and
credentials work and that the script returns a valid JSON response.

If that works you can continue testing it in QGIS web client.

If you are creating postgis layers in a loop, are you making sure to
destroy them again nicely in your loop? Anyway if it used to work before
maybe there was a regression somewhere....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis 2.0.1 - Group layer SR selection panel
Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhvUKPk+xUASH+sPHRg0rur22dVNqqF+QUatVVM7nXuLQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

there is something wrong, or too complex, in the panel in object.

In fact, if I create a layer group and I want to give a unique SR to all
layers under the group, in the panel it is not possible to select the SR
directly in the "recently used SR" list.

I tried using double click, single click ...  nothing to do  :(

The only way to do it is to ... select the SR from the "mondial reference
systems", that are not ordinated.

Please, tell me that it will be changed in the next version of QGis !


Thank you

Roberto

Thanks for the response Tim.

I have not been destroying my layers. This has not been an issue when running the plugin with 2.0.

This was the first thing I thought about in the version running against master so I added the following code to close the postgis layers as it once I am finished with them:

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(layer_id)
This has not made it difference. It still hangs at the same place and I still get the warning that there is already too many clients when trying to connect to PostGIS with DB Manager or pgAdmin.

Shall I open a bug?

Recently this script has developed an issue. It uses QGIS-dev so it could be related to some of the changes in master recently as it works fine with QGIS 2.0.

It makes about 42 PDFs then it stops.

It is not actually crashing as such, as you can see it running in task manager. It stays running using between 0 and 2% processor, and fluctuates a little with memory use (around 108840kB). But it does not produce any more PDFs. It is like it is stuck.

If I try and connect to the database using DB Manager in QGIS or pgAdmin III while the script is still running, I get an error saying there is already too many clients already. If I kill the process in windows task manager, I am then able to connect to the database using DB manager.

Has anyone any suggestions as to what is wrong here? Is this a bug?

I updated QGIS dev this morning using the OSGeo4W installer (its revision is eb9ce3a).

There is a bug [0] in the QgsProjectionSelector class and there is already
a PR [1] for fixing it.
So the upcoming release should have that patch!

Hello all,

I have a standalone python script that creates a bunch of PDFs for me.

Recently this script has developed an issue. It uses QGIS-dev so it could be related to some of the changes in master recently as it works fine with QGIS 2.0.

It makes about 42 PDFs then it stops.

It is not actually crashing as such, as you can see it running in task manager. It stays running using between 0 and 2% processor, and fluctuates a little with memory use (around 108840kB). But it does not produce any more PDFs. It is like it is stuck.

>From the log file that my script creates, I know that it is hanging with this line of code:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres")

If I try and connect to the database using DB Manager in QGIS or pgAdmin III while the script is still running, I get an error saying there is already too many clients already. If I kill the process in windows task manager, I am then able to connect to the database using DB manager.

Has anyone any suggestions as to what is wrong here? Is this a bug?

I updated QGIS dev this morning using the OSGeo4W installer (its revision is eb9ce3a).


If you are creating postgis layers in a loop, are you making sure to destroy them again nicely in your loop? Anyway if it used to work before maybe there was a regression somewhere....

Hi Minoru,


You can do it with latest code on GitHub.

I tested it   :)

I have an idea and a suggestion:

if a level was a WMS PNG24 or PNG32 of a DTM, do you think it would be
possible to use it to create 3D with your plugin?

This would be a very useful feature :)

I have

* deprecated signal QgsMapRenderer::hasCrsTransformEnabled()

I made sure to first install python-shapely from the Advanced installer  
and then installed the VoGIS Profile tool version 1.8.4

Interestingly, the installer offers python-shapely 1.2.9 and 1.2.18. I  
installed 1.2.18-1.

Best wishes,

Hi Werner,
I apologize if I sounded too harsh - I did not mean it.
Let me explain what I mean:

http://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/vector.png
http://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/raster.png

* in vector, after Scale I have some empty space
* in raster all options are in collapsible submenus, whereas in vector one should
press More options >> and it finds them on the side; I do not know which solution is
better (I incline for the raster one, but I'm not a GUI expert), but I think they
should be consistent
* CRS selector is different
* I see no point in having an empty collapsible box (Datasource Options, Layer
Options for Shapefiles)
* minor stuff could be made more consistent (e.g. Save as is over the box in vector,
and on the side in raster; Capitals should be only for the first word)

Thanks!

+1 There should definitely be consistency between the vector and raster  
"save as" dialogs.
Imho, the raster solution where all options are aligned in one column is  
preferable.
I also see quite a big empty area in the left column when I open the  
vector "save as" dialog. I can decrease the height of the dialog manually  
but it jumps back to the bigger size once I open "more options".

> * CRS selector is different

In case of CRS selector, I think I prefer the raster solution. Here's why:  
1. The raster solution has only one dropdown box where the vector solution  
needs a dropdown and a text box; 2. The vector solution is confusing  
because the CRS name in the (greyed out) text box is not updated when the  
user changes between layer, project, and selected CRS.

> * I see no point in having an empty collapsible box (Datasource Options,

+ 1 for no empty collapsible boxes.

> * minor stuff could be made more consistent (e.g. Save as is over the

The raster dialog lacks the very useful "Add saved file to project"  
checkbox.

Another small thing: I don't know about your experience, but I would very  
much like to have the "Add saved file to project" checkbox ticked by  
default.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi!

No problem with harsh .. I did not even understand it in that way :)

The more options are usually not needed - it should only be necessary
to open it if you know what you are doing.

I agree with the change in the CRS selector ..

>> * I see no point in having an empty collapsible box (Datasource Options,
>> Layer Options for Shapefiles)

If GDAL is extended with new options not available in the
preselectable options (or you have your own newer version of GDAL
installed) there is always the possibility to enter these new options
manual in these boxes (sometimes the commands can be quite long -
hence the space to overlook the full command). If you know a way of
hiding these boxes (again - more options should not be necessary to be
opened) it would be nice to make them smaller .. I did find no way.

which will mean that we loose functionality

Thats a thing I will take care of ..

Would be nice .. If I find out how I will add it ..

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYoj=8C2RAy-j8X+QQhnoPvSDPiPu5BBMZ2992JYJ25yVw@mail.gmail.com>

QgsMapCanvas::paintEvent() is called too frequently on my X11, for example:
- 11 times when mouse enters map canvas (if QGIS does not have focus)
- 10 times when mouse leaves map canvas
- 13 times when minimized QGIS is restored
etc.

Does anybody know why and how it could be reduced?

I think we might not be talking about the same thing here.

Check http://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/vector.png

"Datasource Options" and "Layer Options" are empty and could be hidden.

"Custom Options" contains two input fields for custom layer and datasource  
options. Those are fine!

Best wishes,
Anita

BTW, I think we should use the same selector throughout, e.g. Layer>New>New shapefile

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Difference for transform reference system between
	QGIS and GDAL
Message-ID: <CAC93zU2=3bYXru1e0YnGEXbr6WtacvNA8tbtGrDoTe61oYoSCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I had differences for transform the reference system of geometries between
GDAL and QGIS.

I made the transform using GDAL into geometry with reference system  SAD 69
UTM (EPSG 29191) to WGS 84 (EPSG 4326) .

When i add in QGIS the geometries with WGS84 and SAD 69  using 'on the fly'
(WGS84), has diferences positions of coordinate (see picture).

The QGIS reads the reference system of shapefile different than GDAL (see
layer property).

I would like understand how using GDAL for transform geometries this
reference system of this shapefile ?

How can difference reading shapefile by QGIS and GDAL ?


Data for help me:
1) python script using GDAL:
http://pastebin.com/ujeHJLx5

2) Shapefile with SAD69 UTM
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14847115/diff_qgis-gdal/sad69_utm.zip

3) Picture of QGIS with a difference between geometries
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14847115/diff_qgis-gdal/diff_transform.png

The code of python print the two geometries in WKT format.
I use the QuickWKT plugin for view these geometries

Luiz Motta

The shapefiles .prj file has no +towgs84 parameters, so GDAL sets them 
to zero.

QGIS assigns the EPSG:29191 to the file, which has +towgs84 parameters.

Hi Roberto,

The way of getting elevation values from 3 or 4 bands image data seems
a little strange. AFAIK, at least it is not common, and WCS is a more
ordinary way to get elevation data through internet access. Using QGIS
API (QgsRasterDataProvider) in addition to GDAL API to support more
data sources (1 band rasters) may be a good idea.

Hi Anita,

I'm still not able to reproduce the problem, but looking at this is bug,
geos seems to break shapely.
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.bugs.general/1111838

Would you mind checking with this version, if you still encounter an
exception?

Thanks,
Wilhelm

Hi Minoru,
I have another question for you :)
I'm dong some tests to apply vector "draping" on top of the PlanarGeometry,
i.e. positioning vector vertices on the terrain when they don't have z
values.
I've done a test with ray casting. Here a result which seems a caterpillar
walking along our mountains :)
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13861666/2014-01-17%2011_27_15-firenze.png
Do you know other/better solutions then raycasting? Maybe through shaders?

Andre,

Thank for quickly response.

The question is exact this, why the QGIS read the PRJ and understands the
'towgs84', otherwise, the GDAL don't understands, where , the QGIS use the
GDAL/OGR provider ?

File PRJ:
PROJCS["SAD69_UTM_zone_21S",GEOGCS["GCS_SAD69",DATUM["D_South_American_1969",SPHEROID["GRS_1967_Truncated",6378160,298.249999999996]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-57],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",10000000],UNIT["Meter",1]]

Proj4 for QGIS:
+proj=utm +zone=21 +south +ellps=aust_SA +towgs84=-57,1,-41,0,0,0,0
+units=m +no_defs

Proj4 for GDAL:
+proj=utm +zone=21 +south +ellps=aust_SA +units=m +no_defs

More observations.

When mouse enters the map canvas, first 10 (unwanted?) paintEvents
are caused by QEvent::HoverMove. Following QEvent::HoverMove events
are not causing additional paintEvents.

Single QEvent::HoverLeave is followed by 10 paintEvents (QEvent::Paint
- Screen update necessary).

QEvent::WindowActivate (restore) is also followed by 10 additional (11
in total) paintEvents().

Setting stylesheet, for example: setStyleSheet(":hover
{background-color: #ff0000;}");
increases the number of paintEvents to 20.

QGIS tries to find a (near) match to prj content in it's database, if found it
proceeds with it's CRS, instead of the CRS GDAL/OGR produced.

This is an intended behaviour.

Other software (like ESRI) don't write datum shifts in the .prj file, 
but leave it to the end user to select one of the available shifts. QGIS 
has to handle these files correctly, so it looks up the EPSG table and 
selects the best fitting code. If you think it has guessed wrong, you 
can assign another CRS to the layer.

GDAL does no guessing. Unless there are not datum shifts provided on 
source and target CRS (using either +datum, +towgs84 or +nadgrids), it 
does no datum shift at all. You can specify -s_srs to override the 
source file's .prj file with an EPSG code that contains a datum shift. 
This should bring the same result as QGIS does automatically.

HTH,
Andr? Joost

I tested with 1000 and with 1000.00 (but any other value has the same effect )

I tested with points and with a line. 

The srs was epsg:32632. 

But also other srs has the same effect. :(

Is it working to you ?

Hi all,

Thank J?rgen for your  explanation about how QGIS set the reference system
from source.

I agreement with Andr? Joost about the user should  select your specific
reference.

The source of my problem is the creating of shapefile by GDAL/OGR.

For creating shapefile, the OGR/GDAL not using  all parameters of reference
system.

I resolve my problem, creating the GML file, in this case, the refefence
system is identical of source.

How suggested Etienne i will raise this issue in gdal-dev list.

If someone want to see the script example:

Luiz Motta

Yes, but I don't use an Apple ;-)
What about Vector -> Geoprocessing -> Buffer?

Just lurking at this thread :
- it is a design decision that OGR will discard parameters of the SRS when 
writing it in a .prj. The .prj format is ESRI WKT and ESRI WKT does not 
support TOWGS84 parameters. Perhaps we could try to write them, but I have no 
way of checking if ESRI software will accept such files
- on reading .prj, as being said above, OGR will not try to find a SRS in the 
EPSG database that would be close. The .prj could be a custom SRS with a 
different TOWGS84 database. (By the way, the TOWGS84 presented by GDAL when 
resolving an EPSG code is just the "preferred" one , but there are potentially 
other possible TOWGS84 parameters that are a better fit for the area of 
interest. This is a complex issue...)

It does not redraw the map but QgsMapCanvasMap does repaint cached,
previously rendered, mPixmap. That is probably fast (takes some time
anyway), but there are also all QgsMapCanvasItems. QgsHighlight for
example, which renders identified feature every time and that can be
heavy (as R?gis pointed out) for complex polygons with thousands of
islands. That is how I came to it.

there are also pull requests (a few waiting for months) with patches
fixing issues (even blockers) and/or adding interisting features.

Hi Giovanni,

as you are pretty into issues as in the importance of problems, maybe
you can create a top-3 of PR's that you like to have fixed first (in
this weekend ;-) ).

Then hopefully people
1) can check if these PR's are still mergeable (I can do that)
2) have some guidance in the 'importance' of the PR's and we can have
some 'focus'
3) we can ask a core dev to have a look into the code and decide if the
fix is ok (or not!).

Idea?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

In other word: do  a "git pull origin master" to update you local repository 
and run make

I am using 12.04 also and I have successfully built QGIS yesterday!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changelog: Misleading "Author" tag
Message-ID: <52DAABEA.1080704@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Having a look at the (awesome) changelog [1] I noticed the "Author" tag. 
It looks to me, that this tag mentions the author of the changelog 
description, but it can easily be mistaken for the author of the feature 
(at least that's what I expected first when looking at it).
While I am extremely thankful to people writing these changelog entries, 
I think credit has to be given where it is due, so I would recommend to 
rename this tag to "description author" and have another tag "feature 
author(s)" next to it.

Best
Matthias

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw0fk5oFUkXJedW4B2QXjwWiFgvQRexi5JtFP6uj4OuKXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I noticed that if I do:

 1. QgsMapCanvas.freeze ( True )  - to stop drawing the mapcanvas
 2.  call QgsInterface.AddRasterLayer() two times to add two distinct WMS
layers
 3. QgsMapCanvas.freeze ( False )  - to enable drawing the mapcanvas
 4. QgsMapCanvas.refresh - to redraw the map

I noticed that AddRasterLayer completely ignores the freeze state of
QgsMapCanvas forcing it to draw the map on each call of AddRasterLayer.

Is there any way to avoid it?

page ASAP.

On the larger topic of providing credit, historically in our release
changelogs I have tried not to single out particular authors since for
every sexy new bit of eye candy 1 developer creates, there are 10 more devs
doing 'under the hood' work that end users often don't realise has taken
place, and that doesn't get mentioned in the changelog. For this reason I
prefer to keep the language in the changelog neutral as possible in terms
of who did what so that we feel a collective pride in the release.

As with all things this is open to debate and I am not trying to lay down
the law here....so if anyone feels strongly that the approach should be
otherwise lets discuss...

PS any ideas / bugs are welcome - simply drop them onto our backlog at
https://waffle.io/timlinux/projecta

PPS look out for the new voting functionality for project decisions we are
prototyping too...

Regards

Tim

Hi, I was who added a reference to this function in order to fix a bug, my apologies, It is only supported in gdal 1.10.

Tim,

What do you think about adding a "Funded by" attribute to changelog
entries? Ideally this would be with an optional url link to the
companies website.

people that put in a lot of work for free.

I don't mind too much - though I have a similar problem in that many of us
donate large amounts of time to the project which is essentially 'funding'
too that goes unacknowledged. On the other hand that may be a sacrifice we
as a group are willing to make in order to encourage 3rd parties to fund
work on QGIS. It certainly would be good publicity for any organisation
that does fund a feature. If others feel it is appropriate to do this we
can of course add a field, but even then my preference would be to simply
annotate the description field with a final line stating who funded the
feature e.g.:

(Funded by the three little pigs)[http://hohoho.com]

Tim

Well, if you really wanted a feature like that, you could:

1. link it to the person who donated their time's personal page if they've got one (or a page of their choice if they don't).
2. Have a generic "Time" logo/label and state that it was paid for by a donation of this person's time.
 
In an opportunity cost sort of way they paid for it by not going gardening/bike-ride/something-else-but-coding.

Of course this might also identify which devs might be seen as a soft touch...

-ramon.

Hi,

recently I've set up a development environment on Ubuntu 12.04, I've found
this article from Tim very useful:
http://linfiniti.com/2011/06/using-qtcreator-with-qgis/

a few images are missing and the qtcreator interface is a bit different but
the steps are still the same.

Hi Roberto,

Is your python webbrowser module overlapped by something? For example,
you have a plugin named "webbrowser" ? : ) Otherwise, please try to
set browser path in the setting dialog.

Minoru

Hi. Did anybody succeed in enabling search for QGIS web client on Windows
OS?
I follow all steps from Readme on https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client!
But my search wont work! Is there a way to do the change of the code so
that i can add my search panel?

 Thanks!

Hi Marco,

You will have to provide more details in order that we can help you.

Which search method are you trying to implement? There are at least
three different methods: the QGIS server based search that uses existing
layers within the project, the PostgreSQL/WSGI method, the
PostgreSQL/PHP method.

What did you do and what does not work?

Andreas

Yes, I created a plugin named "webbrowser" ... :(

So, this is the problem !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with QgsAttributeTableView in a plugin
Message-ID: <CAG-h0-_bDGa4QoG0oeP1S9JyBidDvXxAf2b6H=Uqy8JPMDU5+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Devs!

I would like to ask you for help with using a QgsAttributeTableView in a
plugin. I am using QGIS-master on Ubuntu 12.04 but the same applies to
QGIS-dev from OSGeo4W.

There is no problem when I use QGIS python console:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
w = QMainWindow()
cw = QWidget(w)
gridLayout = QGridLayout(cw)
w.setCentralWidget(cw)
tv = QgsAttributeTableView(cw)
gridLayout.addWidget(tv, 0, 0, 1, 1)
xs = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
xsCache = QgsVectorLayerCache(xs, 10)
model = QgsAttributeTableModel(xsCache)
model.loadLayer()
filterModel = QgsAttributeTableFilterModel(iface.mapCanvas(), model)
tv.setModel(filterModel)
w.show()

When using the some code in a plugin :

class TableViewDialog(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent, iface):
        QMainWindow.__init__(self)
        self.ui = Ui_TableView()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)
        self.iface = iface
        self.ui.refreshButton.clicked.connect(self.refresh)

    def refresh(self):
        tv = self.ui.tableView
        xs = self.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
        xsCache = QgsVectorLayerCache(xs, 10)
        model = QgsAttributeTableModel(xsCache)
        model.loadLayer()
        filterModel = QgsAttributeTableFilterModel(self.iface.mapCanvas(),
model)
        tv.setModel(filterModel)

I cannot get the table populated with features and QGIS crashes
occasionally when refresh() is called. The tableView object is promoted to
QgsAttributeTableView with header 'qgis.gui'.
What could make the difference between those two cases. Am I missing
something in the plugin code?

Thank you for any hint!

Radek

I agree with Tim. There are so many other things that people in QGIS
community do - bug fixing, translations, documentation, web, support on
mailing lists - that it feels wrong to highlight just donations for new
features. Also, it may be unfair to sponsors who give money directly to
QGIS project - they get credit for sponsoring the whole project, while
companies listed in changelog would eventually get more publicity without
directly contributing to the project's budget.

We should probably agree on a policy about the right way of giving credit
to organizations that fund development. Recently in source code there I
have some mentions of funding in comments which I believe are better kept
just in git commit comments, out of source code.

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting debug messages under windows
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3zyw2tzqWA7j_kxFbSH7mjB3AOJScuW44n0+LTc6fP_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

While being a C++ newbie, I've been able to build QGIS under Windows by
following the very precise information in the INSTALL file. Thanks to this,
I managed to do already some very small contributions to the core.

However, I've never been able to get debug output, which is refraining me
from doing more... I've searched a lot, and found a lot of stuff, but
nothing which worked or which made sense to me.

It seems I have to change the cmake option : -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG (or
RELWITHDEBINFO)

I don't know what that is, nor how to change it. I've set the target to
RELWITHDEBINFO in VCExpress (as stated in INSTALL), but that does not seem
to be sufficient to get any output.
I'm not even sure : is the output supposed to be printed in the command
prompt from which I launched QGIS ?


Thanks a lot in advance !

Olivier

Hi all.
I'm getting

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to
NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
OSGDB_LIBRARY

Of course, installing libosgearth-dev fixes this, so I guess there is a missing
build-dep.
All the best.

Hi Rados?aw,

Things like this are most likely introduced by loosing the reference to 
objects which then get garbage collected.

Try assigning the objects to local variables. I.e. change "model" to 
"self.model", "filterModel" to "self.filterModel" etc.

Hope this helps
Matthias

Hi all.
I'm noticing an incredible slowdown (half an hour for doing *anything* on any layer)
in master of a few days ago (5d4877a) for projects reading several PostGIS remote
layers. The same project in 2.0.1 reads just fine.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Hi Minoru,

All is OK, now.    It was my local "webbrowser"  test plugin, that
conflicted with your.

:)

Now, QGis2threejs  works perfettly

Thank you

"Server side simplification" in the rendering options could 
theoretically slow down a layer (e.g. if the server load is too high)

Hi Paolo,

No problems for me today.

But I had troubles on Ubuntu with Postgis last weeks.
This was due to the introduction of geometry sinplification, but has 
been solved for me since merge of pull 1053, 5days ago ( 8fb87f1 ).

Not sure if it has any relation, just FYI.

Cheers,

Denis

First of all thanks for answering! I try to implement search that uses
existing layers! I try to do this looking at helloworld project, but
my first problem is that when I try to run helloworld.qgs form default
projects i cant see map and i am getting an error:


   1. Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type

and this is my URL request

<http://localhost:91/qgisfolder/qgis-web-client-master/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=/qgisfolder/QGIS-Web-Client-master/projects/helloworld.qgs>*

I have my project named GisParcel.qgis-When I run it form location
C:\myproject\GisParcel.qgs its work fine. When it work fine URL is:
http://localhost:91/qgisfolder/qgis-web-client-master/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=
C:\myproject\GisParcel.qgs, but when I put it in project folder where is
helloworld.qgs located
(C:\OSGeo4W\apache\htdocs\qgisfolder\QGIS-Web-Client-master\projects) it's
not work and url for this is:

*http://localhost:91/qgisfolder/qgis-web-client-master/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=
<http://localhost:91/qgisfolder/qgis-web-client-master/site/qgiswebclient.html?map=>/qgisfolder/QGIS-Web-Client-master/projects/GisParcel.qgs*

And error is:

Why my project wont work where i put relative path in url -
*map=/qgisfolder/QGIS-Web-Client-master/projects/GisParcel.qgs*
and work with path map=C:\myproject\GisParcel.qgs?

Why I am getting error when try to open helloworld.qgs project?

Hi Olivier,

I don't work that much on Windows, so my experience may not cover all 
cases.

In my experience, the easiest thing is to start the application from 
VS. Do this, by right clicking the "qgis" project in the Solution 
Explorer and click "Set as StartUp project". Then click the play button 
(or Debug => Start Debugging). Now, the debug output should be in the 
Output window of VS (If compiled with RelWithDebInfo). I think it is 
also possible to attach Visual Studio to a running process, which 
should help as well. Or there is a tool called DebugView which is 
supposed to help, if VS is not installed.

Hi Minoru,


I have some other suggestion   :)

I am testing  with more than one image and DTM files.

I find that, in this case, it would be useful to have an automatic selector
of the DTM or DSM layer  (I don't know how, but, for example, it could be
the layer that starts with "DTM_")

Other problem is: if there are more than one  DTM_  layers, it could be
possible to have together clipped in the output ?   Or, only one is
possible to have ?


Thank you

Ciao

Roberto

Hi Minoru,


with last master version I had this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"C:\Users\rrr/.qgis2/python/plugins\Qgis2threejs\qgis2threejsdialog.py",
line 324, in run
    htmlfilename = runSimple(htmlfilename, context, self.progress)
  File

445, in writeVectors
    geom_type = layer.geometryType()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'geometryType'


I have only a  dtm tif  in the layer list.   Perhaps a vector is also
needed ?

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.1 development cycle ends on Friday
(2014-01-24; 4 days away), we'll go into feature freeze and start the 2.2
release cycle in which we'll do testing, bugfixing, translating and release
preparations instead of feature development for the 2.2 release.

Please merge your new features before 2014-01-24 and prepare to start testing.
The 2.2 release will be on 2014-02-21 (32 days away).

See also: http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html

There's also the question how the next release should be named.  My first idea
was "Dufive", but I'm sure there are better ideas around. ;)

question: do we *really* need a name? I think the good old days of pets & planets are
gone, we can always have problem choosing a wrong name, and it will be increasingly
difficult to find suitable ones.
All the best.

Hi,

If Martin's work is merged, I would vote for something like lightning, 
or cheetah!

Cheetah sounds nice! what a nice splashscreen it would be ;)

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Clustering algorithms from RISE
Message-ID: <CAN4DAm=BbJ5RJ17Tf=z7mvLmxwJZCWSTnof-1_XV6S6PMH9v8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

RISE group has been developing a project named Clusterpy, which is a
library of spatially
constrained clustering algorithms. At RISE we would like to contribute to
QGIS with the
algorithms we have on our project and specially with the algorithms
proposed by the group and
group Director, Juan C. Duque.

As one of the relatively new developers of Clusterpy, I have been looking
into the possibility of
making Clusterpy (a modified version) part of the Processing code.

First I would like to know, do you think that this kind of algorithms area
a good fit for the QGIS
core?
I also would like to know, what would be your proposed process to make this
happen? anyone
I should contact directly?

My non-official fork of the Clusterpy project is here:
https://github.com/sergiobuj/clusterpy (the
official project is on Google code)

Thank you for your time and I hope to hear back from you soon,

Sergio B

Hi,

I am trying to create a custom application using QGIS API.

I am using Qt Creator and while running the app I get this error:

Here is the project file:

And what about  the Eagle ?
It is the english translation of the italian city "l'Aquila" and we have also a splash screen here:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can we deactivate the Select datum transformations
	dialog by default?
Message-ID: <op.w9zxt0igna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I suggest to deactivate the Select datum transformations dialog by default.

Here is why:
- Most users are happy with the default transformations. (I assume that's  
the case because it's not often a topic in the support channels.)
- It adds at least two more clicks for opening a layer (if it has to be  
transformed).
- Opening old project files is a real pain (until you notice and decide to  
use "remember selection").
- Many users have no idea what to do with the dialog. It's just a list of  
weird parameters which most have never seen before. You only get some  
information about "preferred" and "deprecated" transformations on  
mouse-over.
- Hiding deprecated transformations does not seem to work currently  
(tested with nightly on Windows 7).
- Users who need non-standard transformations could add them to their QGIS  
options.
- I think we would just scare away users if the first thing they see when  
they try to load some dataset is this dialog.

Best wishes,
Anita

Well, we still have "Brighton" but I agree that we will probably run out  
of suitable names with the new faster releases. I could certainly live  
without release names.

+1 for this. Also, the dialog's columns need better default widths (too
thin now), and a little text about what the dialog is about would go a long
way for new users.

Yes, very annoying. Maybe there is a better way to indicate to the user
that transformations need to be addressed, even after a default one is
applied and the layer loaded?

For me, this is the most salient reason.

Agreed. This is already the case with the CRS dialog, which routinely
mystifies some new users, even is it is completely necessary to basic GIS
workflow.

Hi,

Regarding the name, we could also continue with other famous
cartographers - maybe someone from Latvia or England.

Ok I guess you can see where I am going to go with this email :-) Is there
any point to allowing users to simplify point layers? Alvaro, can your
remove the point rendering tab in layer properties (and I guess check
internally that you are not trying to simplify point layers)? Or is there a
use case for point simplification that I am not getting?

In the server world there is, could also be useful for navigating
gigantic data sets. Should definitely be a user toggled option.

Clustering
http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/examples/strategy-cluster.html

There are a few different ways to do it, and doing it server side can
save time when rendering WMS or prevent overload when WFS.

Thanks,
Alex

Yeah I am familiar with clustering (and would love to see it as a feature
in QGIS), but the simplification implementation (as coming in 2.2) is there
to strip vertices from geometries to speed up rendering. I don't think
there is much benefit of having that applied to points (since they are
composed of a single vertex.

Hi

Regarding whether we should keep giving releases names, I think we should
(big +1) for the following reasons:

* it (under our current scheme) pays homage to the hosts of our hackfests -
lets be honest there isn't much reward in hosting it other than seeing your
region represented in the release name
* its a 'fun' part of our project culture and I would not like to see that
we gradually remove everything that is fun and interesting about our project
* users that I interact with often reference the release by its name, and I
think it makes the individual releases more clearly distinguishable

I would suggest a Latvian cartographer or place of interest. Then next
release we can have a splash of some drunk guys wondering around Brighton
on a Saturday night :-P

Regards

Tim

I fully support all of Tims arguments..
I'd like to keep it too and especially the point of refering .. I
hardly heard the release number but more the release name..

We still have some hackfests that did not get a name..

And for the future I'd suggest to name the release after a hackfest
after the town where it has been - and if we are running out of names
inbetween take a famous kartographer (until we run out of them) ..

And for the suggestion with the picture of drunken guys in brighton ..
I think there are some .... :D

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis Dufour crashes when using
	QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2.setSubSymbol()
Message-ID: <52DD95C0.2090408@free.fr>

Hello,

I'm working on a python plugin to render S57 nautical charts using the 
ogr provider and QGis symbology. For now, I'm just testing how to use 
Symbology, as I'm not familiar with it, so I think I do something wrong, 
but can't find examples on Google.

I need to compose symbols for lines, using Svg files. This seems to be 
done using one or more QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2 in a QgsMarkerSymbol 
wrapped in a QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2 using setSubSymbol(...) method. 
Following this idea, I get QGis crashes.

I post some code at 
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/83517/qgis-dufour-crashes-when-using-qgsmarkerlinesymbollayer-from-a-python-plugin

When I comment the line calling setSubSymbol(), the layer is rendered 
correctly with a default symbol.

Thanks for help.

Alain

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsAttributeTableModel.setRequest in Python
Message-ID: <CAG-h0--9vOnpFJgQ5tHeip=MP8Lq-wnre+RzjLHTrnLhF3f_Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Devs!

I am trying to populate QgsAttributeTableView with some features that meet
a request in Python (QGIS-master).
My first try was to use
QgsAttributeTableModel.setRequest(QgsFeatureRequest) but it is not yet
implemented in Python bindings as I see in [1].
I would like to kindly ask if there are some plans for the implementation
soon? Or is there an other way to filter features for QgsAttributeTableView
?

Thank you for any information!

Radek

This patch?hides the simplification rendering tab for point layers, now it is not supported (internally I am not trying to simplify point layers).?Thanks Tim!

About if there is?a use case for point simplification, I know one, (gvSIG ?+ dielmo open lidar) use it for load extreme big point layers as LiDAR LAS files are.

It know the code in java and I think easy migrate to QGIS. Basically, It ignore points by distance in a similar style as the current simplifier classes.

If you think good for QGIS I think but I can imlement it.
Alvaro

Alvaro, can your remove the point rendering tab in layer properties (and I guess check internally that you are not trying to simplify point layers)? Or is there a use case for point simplification that I am not getting?

Sorry I see my original email was not very clear - I meant if there was a
use case for point simplification as *currently implemented in master* - I
fully agree that filtering proximal points would be a good performance
booster, as would providing a point clustering capability.

Hi Radek,

There is the QgsAttributeTableFilterModel which is a proxy model to be 
applied in front of the QgsAttributeTableModel, which allows you to 
dynamically apply filters, while the request set to the table model 
itself is rather static. With this one you can set the filter mode to 
ShowFilteredList and set a list of feature ids (setFilteredFeatures) 
which are to be shown.

But the setting the request should become part of the public API as 
well.

And, I wrote my reply wrong :-)

About point simplification, the strategy is no fetch in the featureiterator some points using a tolerance.
Do you think that I must try it ?

If you have time and inclination this would be great (note feature freeze
starts in 4 days). A logical starting may be to only return one point per
map pixel though I am not sure if you can push that kind of logic over to
provider side very easily.

+1 to deactivate the dialog by default.

Tho the dialog is quite usefull, I can imagine people getting frustrated
for not understanding what is that dialog for. Those who understand can
find it elsewhere.

Message-ID: <9d7d4d148561966bedd4f526b27dcaf7c3a425ad@webmail.westnet.com.au>

HI,

Opening one of my 2.0 projects in 2.1 I'm getting this dialogue for
one of the layers. The layer is in AMG84zone 51 and opens fine in 2.0.

I can see what it's supposed to do, but as a user, it's really not
clear which one I'm supposed to pick.

I also don't see why it's suddenly causing problems.

Sounds good.

Only one. You should merge DTM files into one in advance or make use
of vrt file.

+1, for two reasons:
* the advances function isn't needed for many types of qgis users
* the UI would benefit from re arrangements to make it more friendly when
users run into it (ie a short paragraph above list box to explain what this
is about, like with the crs selector)

Also, that logic can only be applied for fully opaque point symbols. As
soon as you have a semi transparent symbol, the repetition of points over a
same map pixel does matter and needs to be preserved.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can we deactivate the Select datum
	transformations dialog by default?

Hmm, looks like it just sent an email that pretty much confirms this. 

Can I ask, what caused this to pop up in 2.1 but not 2.0?

I'd be a lot less freaked if there was a description rather than a load of numbers.
Particularly as the numbers don't immediately related to the proj parameters for the projection I usually use (which because they're pair with a description I've started to become familiar with).

It also seems indiscriminate about what layers it's picking on. Mostly my projects are displayed in MGA94 zone 51 with OTF on. If I remotely understand this dialogue it's asking to transform a layer in AMG84 zone 51 into WGS84. Why only this layer? There are other layers in this project that aren't either WGS84 (which I presume is being used as a staging datum before moving to MGA) and they don't get picked up?

I hadn't even noticed that until you mentioned it. I'd be really tempted to swap them around. Most of the hover text in the dialogue. Details in the hover over.

+1

Not here, just confuse them by having a project they made 2 months ago fail in interesting ways.

Agreed but in that case surely you would just disable simplification?

Is there any point to allowing users to simplify point layers? Alvaro, can
your remove the point rendering tab in layer properties (and I guess check
internally that you are not trying to simplify point layers)? Or is there a
use case for point simplification that I am not getting?

If I well understand from documentation, a .vrt file is an xml index of many raster files. 
It is correct ?
And QGis supports it, true ?
I will try it as soon as possible :)

Thank you for the great suggestion

I also find the current setting quite intimidating for many, probably most, users.
Should we open a ticket?
All the best.

I agree, It is not possible, or very costly, detect if a point has?semi transparent symbol
Maybe, new Point layers should have the simplification disabled by default

Hi

I can live with either showing / not showing by default.
Just note that without showing, many people are receiving wrong 
transformation results without any hint. In my opinion, a normal GIS 
user should never have to do otf-reprojection, it is far to error prone 
(better, let the surveying departement do the conversion between 
different systems).

Regards,
Marco

A big +1 with Tim for the reasons he listed.

The Latvians should decide for 2.2 and Brighton for 2.4.

Hi,

The main problem for me is the modal popup which breaks the workflow 
and it's not easy to grasp the meaning the first time you see it.

Alternatives:
Message bar:
"Default transformation settings have been chosen for layers 'Moon' and 
'Mars'. If you would like to change the settings please click here. For 
more information click here."

Or in the TOC there could be a small exclamation mark next to affected 
layers, and the mouseover could give a hint about "unconfirmed 
transformation" and how to solve it. This would be even less intrusive.

Matthias

I like these ideas.

I'd still want the more information to be informative without having to mouse over it.

-ramon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] option to disable font vectorization in labels
Message-ID: <52DE3CB0.9010700@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on improving svg export from composer. The aim is to be able 
to fine tune maps in a vector graphics editor (e.g. Illustrator or 
Inkscape).

I already added an option to have each map layer in an different svg 
group that will be recognized by Inkscape as a layer 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1092).

Now I'd like to have text (especially labels) exported as text and not 
as paths.

At the moment text is vectorized (drawn with QPainter::drawPath) for 
understandable portability reasons. While this can remain the default, 
an option would be a nice addition and solve 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3975.

The option must be passed to QgsPalLabeling (tested, works at lest for 
simple cases).

The question is where to put this option ?

So far I think of 3 places:
- a global project option: you will see the result in the canvas as you work
- a layer label option: in this case you have to change the behavior for 
each layer
- a composer option: you make the choice when you export to svg, in this 
case you don't see the result until you open the svg

Suggestion ?

Thanks,

V.

Hi, since last week, I have recurrent crashes, when adding a layer to a
project and opening layer properties (either double clic or right clic). It
seems to occur with raster or wms layers (to be confirmed)
Anyone else ?

Hi all.
Several days ago there was a proposal to remove useless (thus obsolete and

e.g.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Compilation-Guide
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples

Hi R?gis,

It may be related to this merged pull request (though it was only merged 3
days ago):
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1082

Can you share a trace or crash report, or maybe create a ticket?

Regards,

Thanks for addressing this issue!
For me, the most obvious place to put this option would be in the print  
composer. Maybe close to the "print as raster" option?

I'm not a huge fan of this option, given that I'd like to keep the composer
window as clear of clutter as possible. I think output format specific
options like these (and saving svg to layers) should be put into a separate
dialog which appears after the save file dialog. Much like how
gimp/Photoshop/illustrator etc show a jpg quality dialog after choosing to
save a file as jpg. The settings could either be remembered globally or per
output filename.

My ultimate goal (I was going to run this by the ux list) is to move
infrequently used settings like resolution, page size/orientation, print as
raster, etc and the atlas settings to their own "composition properties"
dialog and then remove the need for the composition and atlas panels. Any
thoughts on this?

The issue is not actually fixed. The associated pull request only turns on
3/4-working code. A full fix should be forthcoming after the feature
freeze. If a full fix for exporting text-as-text for SVG/PDF can not be
verified with unit tests, then the option will need to be removed.

Hey Paolo,

Just uploaded a new version.

I don't think I will add them in to 2.2 but 2.4 it might happen.

I think I might have found a spot:
http://www.qgis.org/de/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issues

... very well hidden but could be expanded to include the Wiki content.

What do you think?

Hi Anita,

either expand that paragraph, or create a new page and link to it. I'll
update the menustuff if needed.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkYR4A7YGjTgFX9hnYoT-wP=AW_SeqA5pX5tdBOKBeVzBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

We have more or less finished writing up the changelog [1] for 2.2. If
anyone has further suggestions of things that should go into the changelog,
could you please create and account and add them, or just pop me an email.
Also some of the entries could use some more detail, please feel free to
send me extended notes.

@Marco Hugentobler (or anyone else who can answer) can you please provide
some background on the datum shift and dxf export features. How does the
datum shift dialog get triggered and what do users of the feature need to
know. Also for dxf export, is anyone able to provide a screenshot of a QGIS
exported project loaded in a CAD app?

@Paolo could you provide a definitive list of sponsors for me to add to the
top of the changelog  for 2.2.0?

Before the release we will export the changelog to Restructured Text and it
would be great if the docs team can incorporate it into the web site.

Tim -

What's the cut off date for editing the changelog? There's some
additions/fixes to descriptions I'd like to make, but want to take
maximum advantage of the pre-feature freeze cut off period before I
get around to this...

There is no specific cut off (other than the release date itself) but I
would like to personally stop working on it as I have other things on my
plate to deal with. Others feel free to add / revise entries as they see
fit (with the obvious request that things are kept neat & tidy).

Actually the point displacement renderer already does clustering,
though it lacks more options to customize how the clustered symbol
would look like.

Hi Denis

I think you just need to set the Run Environment of your project in Qt
Creator - add LD_LIBRARY_PATH or PATH environment variable (depending
on your system) pointing to the directory with QGIS libraries.

Hi all - (sorry Martin for sending this question to your private mail 
first!)

I have a question about Atlas generation and scaling:

Does the Atlas generator respect scale settings defined under "Project 
properties" --> "General" --> "Project scales" when you're using the 
"Margin around feature" option in "Atlas generation" --> "Scaling" 
settings ?

It would be nice to only have "decent" scale values in the atlas 
generated maps like "1:12.500",  "1:20.000" or whatever instead of 
"1:11.123,24"

I think the best thing to do for a start would be to create a Python
plugin for QGIS that will use the Processing framework. Then you could
upload the plugin to the repository [1], so the potential users will
be able to seamlessly download and install it.

If there would be a lot of interest from users to have the clustering
functionality available in default installation of QGIS, we could
discuss the inclusion of the code into QGIS codebase.

No, it doesn't respect them currently. Can you please file a feature
request for this at http://hub.qgis.org/issues?

Doesnt it do the reverse? i.e. when more than one point falls in the same
place, it shifts them aside so they are all visible. If it can be made to
produce a scaled symbol based on the number of underlying points that would
be cool.That would also be a good time to change its name to 'Custer or
displace' or something.

-1 for another dialog window. It makes the user have to set another step to 
export before having a result. If you want to export the same composition work 
multiple times with different file names you would have to set this every time.
If you want QGIS to remember the settings, the user should have set it 
somewhere specifically. UX simplification is good, magic things happening behind 
the scene are not.
Generally im am more in favor of a "configure first, then execute" way of 
working than the opposite.
An intermediate solution could be to have an extended "save as" dialog box, 
with some options on the side.

Same, more dialog boxes is a -1 for me, panels are quick and convenient, and 
give a fast overview of things.
An option to hide or reduce them on the side would be preferable imho.

Only my personal opinion for what it's worth.

Cannot it be done in a different way, maybe even more explicitly, for
example a bottom bar on splash screen telling place/institution.

Fun for you, disaster for me. When it comes to code names, I always
have to search a table of code names and translate it to a version
number. Too old, stupid, ... probably, even such people are using
QGIS.

If you insist on mountains/cartographers, please order them at least
by height/birth day, that would be very helpful.

Tim, I think that type of simplification should not be activated by
default. The risks of users just not knowing what's going on is high.

The discarding should be activated via check box when desired.

Even though I would keep the names, we'll have troubles anyway: 2 HF a

I think that was what the renderer did originally, but nowadays it
also groups points within configured distance. Unfortunately it always
tries to draw a circle around the clustered point with original
symbols. If we introduced few rendering options, it would be more
useful:
- draw just the clustered symbol for the whole group
- scale the clustered symbol depending on the number of points inside

Huh?   2 HF and 3 releases will help us catch up.  Even more: we're not doing
Linuxhotel releases and Vienna twice.

But I would also be fine if we'd just give it a monotonically increasing
version number (like firefox for instance) and be done with it and drop the
nameing hassle.

Hi

Well, we still have the version number .. and that is still THE
number for me anyway (and should always stay like that).
But the Codename was always a nice thing to have and to my experience
people tend to give a lot of things names (like naming their car), so
why not give a name to a new release.

It also brings the benefit of showing respect for the HF host (or a
cartographer) and although you cannot order the releases by their
names you can always by their version numbers. We are not going to
skip one in favor of the other.

And when I look at the wikipedia page [0] I see the Version number is
still listed before the "Codename".

Maybe I am blind but I don't see a real problem with that. And people
out there have the choice how they want to call it (as long as they
are using it)

kind regards
Werner

oopsss, yes.
I mixed up because we have a delay right now (Latvia being not the latest).

+1 for having a cleaner UI.
I think it does make sense to separate specific settings in specific 
dialogs. And, QGIS can remember the settings from one time to another 
(or am I missing something here?), no need to add a definition somewhere.

Then, I don't mind to have either a specific dialog for SVG export or 
the dialog to be shown after save as.
I think people are used to configuration dialogs being shown after 
choosing a format.

Again, I would also vote in favor of a specific dialog.
It's the same on the mainwindow, we don't have a single dock with all 
the settings at once.
I think it's more confusing (and finally less efficient) to have all the 
settings mixed on the composer dock.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Status of the multi-threaded rendering project
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdOk+CGKf_p9Eqvj188hst=mZkOx5ioxJUPXpqkAxk9TA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

As the feature freeze is approaching, I guess this is the right time
for an update about the progress of multi-threded rendering.

Since the last status update in December I have continued with the
implementation, adding support for more data providers, fixing bugs
and re-enabling features I disabled during the implementation [1]. The
code is in a state where it is quite ready for the merge to master and
I am satisfied with the outcome so far. Still, I believe it will be
better not to rush into the merge now for 2.2 and then run into
problems close to the release (or after!). Don't get me wrong - it
works well for me and for the other few brave souls who helped with
testing - but given the amount of changes it is likely that some
problems will appear sooner or later... git diff statistics say: 315
files changed, 13808 insertions(+), 9321 deletions(-).

So, I suggest that we merge the threading branch as soon as the
feature freeze will be lifted again, so we will have plenty of time
until 2.4 release (4 months) for fixing problems that may appear.

To get an idea of what is still missing, here's is my brief to-do list:
- merge from master and resolve any conflicts (mainly geometry simplification)
- update data providers (so that they work again):
  - mssql (Nathan has kindly volunteered to get it done)
  - sqlanywhere (needs to be done by folks who contributed it)
- (nice to have) - ability to cancel raster block requests. Otherwise,
rendering of raster layers may make the GUI unresponsive until they
finish. GDAL currently does not support that either, so this may need
also contributing to GDAL, otherwise only native raster providers
(wms, wcs, grass) would benefit from that

I would appreciate your observations from the testing!

Regards
Martin

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the update. I am trying the threaded version from time to
time. Not yet for editing, but for using it as a viewer. I should invest
more time into trying it with editing features. I primarily tested
SpatiaLite and Postgis, with occasionally some rasters/WMS.

I agree that it would probably be best to integrate it into master after
2.2 - given the amount of changes and not enough testing yet.

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Revisiting behavior of composer guides
Message-ID: <CAB28AsioV9PfwePvJYR1nE2MatW7wsGVcf=uG5ikMFj+gF6ENA@mail.gmail.com>

Following on from a discussion in March last year
(http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-March/025064.html),
I'd like to re-raise the idea of swapping the behavior of composer
guides lines from the current approach (clicking and dragging on the
horizontal ruler to create a vertical guide) to the opposite approach
(clicking and dragging down the horizontal ruler to create a
horizontal guide).

My rationale is:

- The rulers have changed appearance in 2.2, so this is a good time to
change this behavior if we do decide to do so. It's better to address
this now while things already look different to users then in a future
release.

- The alternative behavior is much more standard. A quick test shows
me that Illustrator, Inkscape, Publisher, Scribus, Gimp, Photoshop and
Indesign all use the drag a horizontal ruler to create a horizontal
guide approach. These are all industry-standard applications, and ones
which many cartographers/GIS users would be familiar with.

What's everyone's thoughts regarding this?

I dont think it will cause much upset to change it and making it work the
same as in other apps seems a logical thing to do.

+1 from me

Hi,

For me it would be a +1 to change to the common behavior of graphics and
DTP software. This is what I already stated in the discussion back then.

I understand that you, Nyall, are trying to make QGIS behave more like
conventions used in Graphics/DTP software (e.g. shortcuts, selection,
navigation, etc.) - so this should be part of the effort I think.

Thanks for dealing with this,
Andreas

After the discussion with Larry on PR 1096, it apears that font as font 
(i.e. non vectorized) will be the default soon (when the bugs are fixed).

The font vectorization is a nice option though, to create portable pdf/svg.

In PR 1092, I added an option to group layers in the svg, this option is 
a checkbox at the bottom of the "Save as svg" dialog. I think font 
vectorization ('Export text as ouline') would fit nicely right next to 
it. This way it does cluttet the composer tabs, you make the choice at 
the moment it should be made, and it's not an additional step (specific 
dialog after you chose your file name).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Viewing SpatiaLite views in QGis
Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhtCibQ53Z8JxGGdM7jrG9inFaUB3aikEh3_tmKR=_kuFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


I noticed a strange behavior in QGis when I am viewing  SpatiaLite views.

These are my steps:

1)  I have some SpatiaLite tables, that have  "Geometry" field.  For
example:

CREATE TABLE "Poligoni" (
"PK_UID" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
"field1" TEXT,
"Note" TEXT, "geometry" POLYGON)

2) I create a SpatiaLite view, that performs some spatial opetation, i.e.
an intersection

CREATE VIEW intersecato as
SELECT  b.field1as "field1", b."field2" AS "field2", a."field3" AS "field3",
    ST_area (a.Geometry) AS "area", b.arec as "arec",
 intersection (a.Geometry, b.Geometry) as Geometry
FROM "Poligoni" a, "otherTable" b
where
ST_intersects (a.Geometry, b.Geometry)  = 1
order by field1

3)  I insert into "geometry_columns" a record for the view:

insert into geometry_columns values
('intersecato','geometry',3,2,3003,0)


4)  I execute a query into SpatiaLite_gui to control that some record
exists.
     And...  they exist.   :)


5) I go to QGis (2.0.1 Dufour,  Windows, Linux or MacOSX :)   and connect
to SpatiaLite DB.

6) I insert my tables and view in Layer list.
We, now I see all the layers, as those corresponding to the tables, as
that correspond
to my SpatiaLite view.  But, this one do not display the correct records in
the attribute panel:  in this case, I only have a list of many "NULL", and
selecting a record, all records are selected  :(


Do you have any explanation for this?

Also I tried to add a PK_UID  in the view definition, but the result
remains the same.


Thank you for any help

Regards

Roberto

Yes, please erase it. The other entries don't mention the funders as well.

Hi all.
We just noticed that when loading a PostGIS table with >1 geometric
column, the one with the loaded geometry is not displayed, whereas the
others are (and, apparently, editable).
To me this is a bug: any thoughts?
All the best.

recommend to insert spatial view in *views_geometry_columns.*

Note: I had problems trying to use OGC_FID instead of ROWID as the PK 
for the view.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] data provider in a custom app
Message-ID: <52E12006.50700@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to do a custom application using QGIS libs and I have 
trouble to use data providers (i.e. spatialite).

In my application doing, QgsProviderRegistry::instance()->pluginList() 
returns " No data provider plugins are available. No vector layers can 
be loaded".

Then of course, trying to create a new db as it is done on 
QgsNewSpatialiteLayerDialog is impossible ( 
QgsProviderRegistry::instance()->library( "spatialite" );  )
and loading layers with
QgsVectorLayer* vl = new QgsVectorLayer( "dbname='path_to_sqlite_file' 
table='mytable'' (geometry) sql=", "layername", "spatialite" );
fails.

I believe I am missing something fundamental here, but I have no idea what.

If anybody has a lead, thanks a lot.

Cheers,

Denis

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_H+LV2e1Sn6z3ai6_ywP89NQ6C6P5SrL2Ydp6Q2nW4H3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

In 2.0.1, NULL values in X and Y fields for data defined labels were
ignored and the label would print in the default place.

Testing QGIS 2.1.0, I have noticed that label would not print in the same
conditions.

Is this the expected behavior?

This issue might be related: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9148 but the
proposed workaround does not seem very logic to me.

Thanks,

Alex

Hi dev....

the errors come from??std::swap<> calls....

void QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2::swap( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2 & other )
{
? std::swap( mSymbol, other.mSymbol );
? std::swap( mRotation, other.mRotation );
? .......
}


am I missing something?, or there is an error chaing std::auto_ptr for QScopedPointer ?

Can someone help me ?

Thanks!
Alvaro

	QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2.setSubSymbol()

Hello,

QgsSVGFillSymbolLayer.setSubSymbol() (to put the outline symbol of a 
polygon) also makes crash QGis.

I tested this with linux and windows 7.

I've found a workaround with QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer.createFromSld(). 
This does work from within a python plugin.

QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer.createFromSld() call setSubSymbol method from 
the C++ part. So maybe the problem comes from the python bindings, but I 
don't know sip.

Shall I report this as a bug?

Alain

Hi, it's not a bug, but it has some drawback in every day's use. 
The 'others' geometry columns are translated to WKT, and are sometimes huge
geometries. This makes attribute table very slow at last, more often
unusable. I don't remember well when, but in 1.9, thoses extra columns where
hidden for some times, and it was really faster.  
Another matter is that the database administrator is forced to creates views
without those columns. And I am the lazy DBA ;-) that wishes he could avoid
that ...
Until now, I haven't had a use case on QGIS side of seeing thoses columns?
Anyone does? 
R?gis

I could not reproduce this under Windows 7 with latest master build, nor
was I able to determine the cause by debugging your dump file (though I
don't have much experience using those files).

Could you create a ticket with an example project with similar data file
and wms link? Then I think I can use Qt Creator on Win 7 to debug or
postmortem-debug the crash.

Thanks,

Larry

Definite +1 from me. There is no reason for QGIS do behave differently  
 from all these standard softwares. Please get the change in for 2.2

Thanks and best wishes,

Did you ensure the QGIS_PREFIX_PATH is set and call initQgis? See [1] for
an example.

I tested with a large point dataset (geonames ~3.5 million records).
Basically enabling the point displacement renderer on that layer kills (or
takes so long I killed it) QGIS. Since the essence of clustering is to
speed up rendering times and reduce visual clutter, I suspect simple tweaks
to the renderer would not be enough.

Hi!

About simplification (no clustering),?I think that the If we?discard points based on the distance to the last fetched and rendered point (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsfeatureiterator.cpp#L36) it will be very effective to render big dense points layers. I have a GIS application using this technique and it draws LAS files (> 30mb) "fast".

I would like write a "point simplifier" in QGIS to validate results.
Do you agree ?

Alvaro

This is apparently due to a difference in implementation of std::swap. 
Sorry for that.

This should fix the problem: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1106

I haven't had an use either (while I'm full of those tables).
Geometries are usually not something that you want to edit "manually",
especially using a desktop GIS...

But it could be interesting to see if simply displaying less of it
(limit on size, click to expand?) would get the speed back. There would
be the same problem with big values of other data types (think text).

Hi all.
The speed issue could be solved by using the same approach of DB Manager (reading and
displaying only the geometry type). This could also avoid the problem with editing.
However, I do not see any reason to show an user geometry columns, and in case there
is a reason, why showing only non-loaded geometries?
All the best.

I think this would be great. Since you are doing a full scan of the
dataset, you should be able to count how many points each aggregate point
represents right? I was thinking we could pass that the the renderer as a
'virtual' attribute so that we can use it to e.g. scale the symbol size.

+1 from me to implement this anyway as a new cluster renderer (or a patch
the point displacement renderer if that seems workable).

Actually in the threading branch I have significantly reworked the way
how the clustering is done in the point displacement renderer. A quick
test with ~75K points shows that QGIS 2.0 takes ~10 minutes to render
with point displacement, while in threading branch it is matter of a
second or two. In the threading branch the renderer uses spatial index
for clustering. Another optimization could be to build the spatial
index for a layer just once, for even better performance.

So I believe now it's mainly a matter of adding more configuration
options.to allow output similar to "usual" marker clustering - and
make such options default.

I would prefer not to have "point simplifier" somewhere in the data
access API - like Tim suggests, it is best to keep such functionality
in a renderer.

Martin

Hi Martin,

So you think the same code of the point displacement renderer can also
be used for clustering?

It was developed exactly for the opposite: if multiple geometries are on
top of each other they are displaced so you can see all of the points. A
use-case is where several people live at the same address but have
different attributes and you want to see them all.

I am a bit surprised that the same code could be used for the opposite -
to cluster points that are not at the same position. Wouldn't it require
some additional code/work to do that?

Just wondering.

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis Dufour crashes when using

Hi Alain,

Please do file a report.

Before you do: Can you try to keep reference to the symbol you are 
adding ( self.mySymbol = createSymbol() | 
xxx.setSubSymbol(self.mySymbol) ) and see if that "fixes" your problem. 
Please file a bug even if it does "fix" it so we can still consider 
passing ownership to C++ in that bugreport.

Best
Matthias

When looking into the code history, there always used to be support
for a tolerance when two points are considered to be at the same
place. So the renderer always did grouping of nearby points, although
it was not originally designed to handle lots of points. And if we
display just the "group" symbol (without individual grouped markers),
there is the clustered marker renderer, isn't it? :-)

>From the technical point of view it is the same thing and the
difference is I think mainly in the use: point displacement is meant
for few close points (e.g. within a distance of 5 meters), while
marker cluster would be used for lots of points (and the distance is
best entered in pixels rather than map units to keep the map readable
with any scale).

Hi,

Thanks for explaining this.

I think it would be very cool to have such clustering available in QGIS.
>From time to time the questions comes up - and other GIS have this
available (e.g. OpenLayers, UMN - see
http://mapserver.org/mapfile/cluster.html)

Around 10-12 years ago. I did a clustering webmap-app with Postgis and
SVG. The use case was for a geology company who has around 20k reports
in all of Switzerland - although with a focus on the german part of
Switzerland. For small map scales we wanted to display clustered
symbols, as we zoom in we wanted to display single points eventually at
a large scale. In between we had threshold values of different cluster
sizes. But I agree with you that a notion of pixels would be better than
fixed map units for that purpose.

In our webmap-app we had differents symbols for clusters (red, bigger
squares) vs. single points where no clustering was made because (blue
smaller rectangles). The clustered symbols also varied in size based on
the number of features the cluster contains - see
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/bis_berichte.jpg as an example and
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/berichte.jpg for a zoomed in view.

I think however, from the usage, UI and preferences point of view the
options for the point displacement renderer are quite different from the
point clustering. For the clustering you want to be able to have
different sizes and shapes for clustered vs. single point symbols. You
want to be able to label the cluster symbol with the number of features
it contains. You want to be able to vary/classify the point symbol based
on the nr of features the cluster contains. For the identify tool it
would still be good to see the whole list of the cluster.

Would be interesting to see if someone could work on this and if someone
could fund the work. We would certainly be interested in the feature but
have other priorities for our funding.

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Blend modes and vector printing
Message-ID: <52E2490A.9010403@carto.net>

Hi,

I know that one has to print in raster if one uses blend modes. I love
blend modes but I tend to avoid them because one has to print in raster.

My question is: is it a limitation of the qt PDF export? As far as I
know Adobe PDF supports blend modes. Could the PDF exporter of qt be
improved? As far as I know it should now be a bit easier to contribute
to qt.

Would it be an option to develop improvements in qt's PDF renderer?

A similar situation is with qt and SVG. It is sort of imported but some
features are lacking and the exported SVG structure is not optimized.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Marco

> transformation results without any hint.

now I think I understand what do you mean. I just noticed that in QGIS
master the towgs parameters of CRSs in use for Portugal have vanished.
Is on purpose or should I consider it a bug?

for example in QGIS there are both the epsg 20790 that had the
parameters and its counter part without (102164) and the user was able
to choose between the two, choosing if he wanted the shift of not.

If the parameters removal was on purpose (also for other CRSs for
other countries) then we can have a serious issue.

Also I have personally a lot of difficulties understand how the datum
shift dialog works, then I guess that most of the people will have the
same problem :)

ntv2 grids were also added to the datum shift database, but never
managed to have them show in the dialog. What I'm doing wrong?

cheers!

'save as spatialite' takes forever. With a small shapefile (1 KB), the 
process of converting takes up to 3 minutes, the generated spatiallite 
is then always around 4000 bigger (4.21 MB). These ratios are the same, 
no matter how big the file is, the time taken enlarges linearly it seems.
When the export is a shapefile again, the whole thing is a matter of 
seconds.
Is this due to some kind of buffering issues or does this conversetion 
simply take that many resources?

Kind regards and thanks in advance for any pointers

Message-ID: <20140124124655.47c09210@acerCF>

hi all,

I'm new to the QGIS; 

I like to explore the capabilities of QGIS towards 3D performances,
I intend vector 3D;

I think of:
- visualization (orthogonal, axonometric and perspective views)
- sections (along with any plane, canonic or skew)
- volume and surface calculation
and so on;

I know that these operations are already possibile with raster layers 
and I did'nt intend to propose a flame for the primality of vector
and/or raster;

I think only to analyze and eventually build some tools for managing 3D
models, leaving to the user the choice of vector / raster selection;

I think that the possibility of managing, georeferencing and analyse
point clouds from laserscanner, sfm, etc, could be an interesting
chance;

From that point of view I'm curious of the presence in the QGIS API of
some features 3D: Line3D, Point3D, QgsTINInterpolator, Vector3D;
because I dont know the C/C++ and I can't see the original
documentation, where can I find some documentation in pythonish mode
(the pyqgis cookbook doesnt treat that subject) ? Which are the
development purposes about 3D?

sorry for my bad english, thanks in advance, best regards,

Message-ID: <52E25F10.5050306@carto.net>

Hi,

I know it is already feature freeze - but what I am still missing in the
print composer - is the ability to constrain a line to be horizontal or
vertical. In Inkscape you do this with the ctrl-key, which limits it to
15 or 30 degree steps. In QGIS we have something similar with the point
rotation which you can restrict to these steps.

And maybe the "arrow" should be renamed to "line" and the arrowhead
should be an option, not the default.

I often need lines in my layouts, but not so often arrows.

What do you think?

I could also wait for QGIS 2.4 of course ... I will be patient.

Looks like a bug. When did it appear? I did not do any changes to the 
datum transform code in the last month.

not sure when. The parameters are gone also for CRSs of other
countries, ex: Italy.

Hello Giuliano,

As for now, there is no support for 3D in QGIS, be it for visualization, or 
internally.

If you want to have some 3D features for your GIS you can :
* use qgis2threejs to visualize layers on top of a MNT with a WebGL browser
* Use the 3D features of grass through QGIS
* Use latest PostGIS versions, which allow you to manipulate 3D objects.
PostGIS + SFCGAL lets you do some computations on 3D objects with SQL. You can 
send SQL commands from within QGIS. See this video for an example and 
visualization of 3D objects with Horao (QGIS plugin to view PostGIS 3D 
objects) :
http://vimeo.com/74869530

There will probably be at some point an effort to support 3D objects in the low 
level QGIS code, and Marco already worked a bit on it I think. But this is a 
heavy-lifting task and a lot more work and funding are needed. Maybe Marco can 
elaborate a bit more on this.

Vincent

Following on from reporting the bug, I have done more digging into the problem.

It seems to be related to styleQML lines when I check what connections are being sent to PostGIS. These don't disappear with each loop iteration in Master, but they do in version 2.0. Eventually when my script gets to 100 connections, it hangs.

What can I do to make this work?

I have updated the bug report with more details, which can be found here https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9357.

Thanks for the response Tim.

I have not been destroying my layers. This has not been an issue when running the plugin with 2.0.

This was the first thing I thought about in the version running against master so I added the following code to close the postgis layers as it once I am finished with them:

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(layer_id)
This has not made it difference. It still hangs at the same place and I still get the warning that there is already too many clients when trying to connect to PostGIS with DB Manager or pgAdmin.

Shall I open a bug?

Hello all,

I have a standalone python script that creates a bunch of PDFs for me.

Recently this script has developed an issue. It uses QGIS-dev so it could be related to some of the changes in master recently as it works fine with QGIS 2.0.

It makes about 42 PDFs then it stops.

It is not actually crashing as such, as you can see it running in task manager. It stays running using between 0 and 2% processor, and fluctuates a little with memory use (around 108840kB). But it does not produce any more PDFs. It is like it is stuck.

>From the log file that my script creates, I know that it is hanging with this line of code:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres")

If I try and connect to the database using DB Manager in QGIS or pgAdmin III while the script is still running, I get an error saying there is already too many clients already. If I kill the process in windows task manager, I am then able to connect to the database using DB manager.

Has anyone any suggestions as to what is wrong here? Is this a bug?

I updated QGIS dev this morning using the OSGeo4W installer (its revision is eb9ce3a).


If you are creating postgis layers in a loop, are you making sure to destroy them again nicely in your loop? Anyway if it used to work before maybe there was a regression somewhere....

I'm late to make suggestions for features, but here following a small
list of (hopefully) issue fixing PRs

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1071

this fix area calculations when OTFR in on (regardless of a layer is
reprojected or not). This is really hurting right now in qgis 2.



https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1037

this should fix the value map widget, also broken in qgis 2



https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/772

this PR claims to solve memory leaks in symbology, but is unclear to
me if it is a finished job or not.

Hi,

I have problems with NULL values and GetFeatureInfo requests. They
appear as "0" if the data-type is numeric, instead of "NULL" or an empty
string.

Here is an example URL:

http://webgis.uster.ch/wms/av/grundplan_av?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&BBOX=695639.462784%2C245044.002%2C695811.726216%2C245141.724&FEATURE_COUNT=10&HEIGHT=1075&WIDTH=1895&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&INFO_FORMAT=text%2Fxml&SRS=EPSG%3A21781&X=805&Y=786&QUERY_LAYERS=LS%20Fl%C3%A4che%2CEOB%20unterird.%20Geb.%2CGeb.%2CProj.%20Geb.%2CEOB%20Unterstand%2CEOB%20Fl%C3%A4chen%2CSR%20Fl.%2CProj.%20SR%20Fl.%2CDBK%20Fl%C3%A4chen%2CDBK%20Linien%2CEOB%20Linien%2CGrenzpkte%2CHoheits-GP%2CRL%20Pktel.%2CRL%20Signalpkt%2CLfp3%2CLfp2%2CHFP3%2CHFP2%2CEOB%20Pkte%2CBodenbed.%20V25%2CGeb%C3%A4ude%20V25%2CGew%C3%A4sser%20V25%2CStrasse%20V25%2CBahn%20V25%2CRL%20Linienel.%2CLabel%20Pkte%20V25%2CGWS%20Linien%2CNutzungszonen%20Linien%2CAbstandslinien

My goal is to skip rows in QGIS Web Client when the value is really NULL
or an empty string so it does not "pollute" the tooltip.

Would this be a lot of effort to properly handle these NULL values if
the data-type is numeric?

Thanks,
Andreas

It is probably unrelated, but I've found a similar problem handling empty
values, it seems like in several parts of the core, QString.isEmpty is
tested instead of QString.isNull.

I mean, at least for request parameters, they should be trated as
three-state: (null, empty string and a string with not-zero length).

I've opened a bug for this and I've patched the core but I don't even dare
to propose a PR since it touches the innermost features of QGIS core.

this is the ticket http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9321

I have made some comments and will test it with some netcdf files.

It would be great to add this before feature freeze, but it is imperative
that a test is in place, at least to make sure that it does not break
anything with "normal" files.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis 2.2: removing spit and disabling "avoid
	intersection of new polygons"
Message-ID: <CACfnYnTd0L4DGwC1pzr4UokGYooQCwpVLvKqwAQnn+S225dkjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

a while ago I proposed to get rid of SPIT as it is unmaintained and
now redundant with a similar tool in the processing toolbox. This will
happen for 2.2?

More serious is the issue with the "avoid intersection" option in the
snapping dialog:

the functionality is broken as it often does not remove all the
overlapped parts, leaving behind (very) small areas and creating
multipart polygons when it is supposed to not happen.

There have been some discussion (and even a fix funding proposal) but
afaik no work has been done.

As this tool does not work as advertised and creates a lot of issues
when digitizing maps than need to be topologically correct, then I
propose to disable it until fixed (and this is a pity, as is one of
the most powerful options in qgis regarding dizigiting).

What is your opinion?

Hi,

2014-01-24 just ended in my time zone - feature freeze for 2.1 has become
effective.  Please don't add new features and switch to testing, debugging and
bugfixing.

The 2.2 release will be at 2014-02-21 (in 27 days).

This is something on my to-do list. I think there's also considerable scope
for improving how lines can be interacted with (eg, being able to drag the
start and end points rather then using a bounding box to resize). It'd be
nice to have the ability to curve lines too. It'll have to wait to 2.4
though!

I'd appreciate it if you could file requests for any missing line
functionality that you think of.

Cheers,

Hi

Is there any good reason for the small pop-up dialog asking for
composer name when user wants to create a new composer? There is the
composer manager where the composer can be renamed at any time, so to
me it looks like an unnecessary step and I would be happy to remove it
:-)

Hi Martin

+1 for removing it, as it is a step I usually skip too. But only if we
provide a input field in the composer properties tab to allow to add/change
the name directly in the opened composer (above the paper size for
example). This way I won't need to open the composer manager only to rename
it afterwards.

+1. I think this will solve also some long standing ticket.

we still have several bugfixing weeks left, and some resources to fix them.
It would be useful to agree on a prioritization.

Thanks.

+1 for removing the the popup. For me, it always stops me in my workflow.  
Even though I know it's there, I'm always surprised and just hit enter to  
make it go away.

Best wishes,

Hi,

+1 for removing it. Maybe an auto-generated name that does not clash
with existing composer names would be useful - which the user can later
on rename.

The user will have to set paper format anyway. In this step he can also
set the composer name.

Thanks for remembering us of it. I couldn't retrieve it from the ML!
Visvis seems a good approach to the visualization of 3D data in QGIS. I
imagine it won't be as performant as native implementations (like osg, used
by Horao) but it would be probably more portable and easy to mantain...

Hi Pedro,

I'm on Debian testing, but I had exactly the same error:

No rule to make target `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libspatialindex.so',
needed by `output/lib/libqgis_core.so.2.1.0'.

Something changed in the place/naming of libspatialindex

What helped in my case: have a look if you maybe have several
libspatialindex versions installed (in my case I had 2 version of the
dev files of it).
Then remove your build dir and start with a new build configuration:

That fixed it with me.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

Thank you very much for the hint! In my case I only have one version, libspatialindex-dev 1.7.0-1 (and libspatialindex1), the problem is that libspatialindex.so is in /usr/lib/libspatialindex.so and not in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libspatialindex.so. So I created a symlink and it worked!

But now bumped into the problem already pointed out by Paolo a few days ago:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Error-in-packaging-td5099082.html

Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] joinning tables
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1401252034050.19705@bme-geod>

Dear List,

I got into trouble joining tables in QGIS.
When I try to join shape to a csv, ods or xlsx file using columns with 
textual data, it doesn't work. I get only NULL values in the joint 
columns.
Using integer values the join works.
Is it a feature or an error?

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Minoru,


you asked me  if I had some reason to  define  my GEarthView  "temp"
 directory  inside the plugin.

Well, now I found the reason:  where is the "temp" of  QGis2threejs,  in
MacOSX  ?

:(

I can not find it ...    Also because you change HTML name   :)



Ciao

Hi,

I specifically added that dialog, since so many times my composers resulted
in unrecognizable names. I believe without it many users will suffer from
this as well. However, I'm not necessarily keen on its implementation, but
wish not to remove the functionality, just move it elsewhere. The new
naming functionality (e.g. to quickly base a name off of an existing
composer, etc.) is already part of Composer Manager, so nothing needs
changed there.

A better solution when creating a new composer, and gently nudging the user
to set a name for it, might be to move the dialog's widget functionality to
a 'Name' field at the top of the Composition panel.

Then, when a user creates a new composer and the main window is shown, set
keyboard focus to that field and set its background to a color to signify
the user should consider entering a unique name (e.g. pale yellow). The
background could be on a singleshot timer so that it fades out after a bit.

This would only be when creating a new Composer; and, since the field could
already have a generated name inputted, the user can just choose to ignore
it. This also means that GUI scripts don't have to deal with the current
interim dialog.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

So, to recap:

+1 to remove the annoying, interrupting new name dialog,
and +1 for moving its functionality to the top of the Composition Panel

A non-editable field displaying the name and a simple edit button next to
it that opens up the same rename dialog as is found in the Composer Manager
would be all that is needed. I suggest the continued use of the rename
dialog since it offers validation that the name is unique among existing
composers names, and allows for quickly building a name off of an existing
name.

If this change (not really a feature) will be allowed for 2.2 release, I
can commit the work today.

Regards,

Larry

ok, thanks. In case of processing plugin, by default, temporary
outputs are put into a directory that QDir.tempPath() returns [1].
Qgis2threejs is following it (Processing has an option to change
temporary output directory).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cad-Input for QGIS prototype
Message-ID: <CAExk7p0=vkcsUkidP=ab6JdH69C6kfYCnev5SoL0eYA=mR6KBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

Some times ago, on this list, we discussed[1] about real CAD-like input for
QGIS, and since I do myself long for such a feature very much, I'd like to
reopen that discussion by *proposing a python prototype*.


I know there are already a few plugins aiming in that direction (CadTools,
ImprovedPolygonCapturing, NumericalInput and a few other).
They provide the functionality, but not the ease of use you can find in CAD
packages.
One key aspect is that they are all specific tools, and do not work with
other tools directly.


The prototype is inspired from Archicad's input method which allows to
combine numeric input with mouse input in a very efficient and flexible
manner, to get the best of both.
It is currently very raw and not well tested at all... It also relies on a
lot of dirty hacks, since the python API is not well suited for this type
of plugins (have a look at the README on the github page for more details).

*DEMO (video) : https://vimeo.com/85052231 <https://vimeo.com/85052231>*
*GITHUB (readme, download...) : https://github.com/olivierdalang/CadInput
<https://github.com/olivierdalang/CadInput>*


Please, tell me what you think :

1) Concept
- Does this kind of input seem interesting to you ?
- How does it fit in a GIS-environment ? Since it comes from a CAD
environment, maybe it's more suited to designing than digitizing.

2) API/Core modifications (read
https://github.com/olivierdalang/CadInput#technical-notes )
- How do you see the suggested improvements ? Are they feasible ?
- Does developing this as a python plugin make sense, or does it have to be
in the core from the start ? (I'm not familiar with core developing)

3) Collaboration...
- Is anyone of you currently working on the same topic ?
- Would anyone have some time/interest in collaborating on this feature ?

4) Other ideas are welcome !


Thanks for your attention,

Olivier

I'm sorry. This was not correct. The option is not for temporary files
but for filename without path [1].

Hi Oliver, thanks for copying me in this email
 
Let me tell you that I have installed your prototype and tested it. I do think something like this is needed and I do like the fact that it works with other tools directly. I like the fact it gives you guidelines of what it will do like in CAD software. I think it would be nice to add also the possibility to use right clicks for actions
 
To address your points
 
1) yes this feature is needed in QGIS, other COTS software have this functionality as Advanced Editing and I do rely heavily daily on this type of things for my job and is amongst several reasons why we cant switch for QGIS. I know the main user base of QGIS probably use it only for analysis but for some of us we need to digitize precisely coordinates based on field data or to create specific features.
 
I would vote to keep to make it part of core as Advanced Tools or something, I also think it would be quite nice to merge the different CAD-like tools into one and have all this contributors who made this individual plugins work as a team. Resources are not always available and to join forces to me seems a better approach
 
2) I would leave that for developers
 
3) I cant code, at least I am not at that level. I am just learning python and it might take some time to achieve a level to make something useful. I can however test the plugin and suggest features. I think the best way is to add issues in the github repository of bugs, improvements etc.
 
4) Some ideas to start with, I will add them to github so you have them there also. I understand it is a prototype to see if it gathers traction but I feel it will
 
- snap to midpoint (snapping options to behave like in CAD software)
- Add trim line
- Add extend line
- Add ability to create arcs e.g. Tan Tan Radius; select center and add radius
- Add the ability to draw by deflection angle apart from perpendicular and parallel
- Maybe add the possibility to add x,y in DMS, DM, DD when working in WGS84
- The plugin already adds the function to calculate within fields. I think one useful thing in length is that by default it is m (or the epsg default unit I guess ft might be for some) and that you can add different units by adding the appropriate abbreviation like in other COTS e.g.
 
18 ft
1 NM
1 SM

I have just compiled from source, and the parameters are ok... so it
is something related to the nighly/ubuntugis build (that among other
things seems compiled now against an old gdal version).

Hi,

Regarding the "avoid intersection" problem: I agree with Giovanni, that this is one of the (or maybe even the major) strength of digitising functionality in QGIS, making it the probably most userfriendly and efficient GIS for digitising available.

>From my point of view proper digitising is a very important GIS feature for "basic" (and potential new QGIS) users. So, the topology imprecision is definitely a reasonable disadvantage in this regards, and personally I would give a high priority to fixing this.

However, I would not deactivate "avoid intersection" (but maybe make users aware of this issue (e.g. by adding a hint in the UI-lable)). Because, the (possibly) incorrect topology (with very small errors) can in many cases be fixed e.g. using GRASS`s v.clean through processing. I know that this is not elegant, but better than not havind this option at all...

Cheers
Stefan

we still have several bugfixing weeks left, and some resources to fix them.
It would be useful to agree on a prioritization.

Hi,

In testing - like in 2.0 - transparency of markers in marker line is  
neither applied nor stored.

I've opened a ticket for it http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9428

... not sure about the categorization. I chose GUI for now, but might as  
well be symbology or style.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Olivier,

There is a new category of GIS users: drone's users. There is already 
the "Video UAV Tracker" for Qgis.

For myself, I use underwater drones (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or 
Unmaned Underwater Vehicle) to collect environment data. We need 
softwares to prepare AUV missions, supervise these missions, and analyze 
data collected during these missions.

When preparing a mission, we have to gather many data (nautical charts, 
seabed sonar raster mozaics, etc...) in a single view, what Qgis does 
really well (except for S57 charts). Using all these data, the user need 
to plan the AUV itinerary, which can consists of waypoints, tracks, 
polygons to survey. Each of these shapes will receive attributes (for 
AUV, speed, depth or bottom altitude to follow, payloads to activate, 
etc ...).

The user also need functions, like creating a group of parallel lines 
oriented along some heading and spaced by a sonar range, all these lines 
clipped by a polygon. These actions have to be done just using the mouse 
(not by creating / naming / loading a shapefile at each step of the 
process) and the keyboard to input coordinates, with transforming 
DDD?MM'SSSS'' to DDD?MM.MMMM' or DDD.DDDDDD facilities for example, etc.

So, to build this itinerary, we need CAD-like input, and there's almost 
nothing in Qgis really user friendly. Within my colleagues, every one 
knows Qgis, but won't even try to use it for this lack. So, we use 
expansive softwares, and Qgis is sometimes the swiss knife to transform 
data from one software to another.

For other kind of drones, the problem is the same, with different 
constraints. UAV may be very close to AUV (6 degrees of freedom), and 
terrestrial robots may be more difficult to handle, because they may 
have to extract the robot path from the map, but with the support of 
CAD-like functions anyway.

Well, I'm not telling that Qgis has to be able to prepare missions for 
every robot. But think of all the software developers who won't write a 
qgis plugin for a robot, because they don't have builtin CAD-like 
functions, and will choose another (proprietary) software that does the 
job, but certainly won't offer Qgis skills for managing geographic data, 
which is really the need for many types of robot. And I also think about 
the thousands students around the world working on robot projects for 
fun, who are really inovative, and may adopt QGis easily if they find 
CAD-like input functions to build robot mission and then write a plugin 
that fits their need to interface the robot.

About Archicad like input, I think it's a good approach.

A python plugin may be a good way to show CAD-like input has to be in 
QGis core.

Yes, yes and yes again!

Personally I don't think we should narrowly constrain ourselves - if a tool
is broadly useful to get your work done lets not constrain ourselves to
whether it comes from the domain of GIS or CAD.

I don't think it matters too much if it is in C++ or Python. One advantage
of having these tools in C++ then provided to python via SIP is that the
users of languages can benefit from the improvements.

This looks really great and I think many people will benefit from these
tools.

I think this is fantastic, at least for users like me that have a CAD
background :-)

Hi again,

I've been testing with the master version downloaded a few minutes ago and it gives me an error, apparently with moc_qgssublayersdialog.cxx.o:

It must be something posterior to commit 5a2beb36e84d7f38041e8b7865fa2437dc3db8bb, since yesterday it did not happen.


Anyone confirm?

at least for precise, that repo now ships qgis nightly compiled
against an old gdal version.

Message-ID: <1390777736.49339.YahooMailNeo@web172703.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi dev, I have a question about QGIS behavior:

Why QGIS does not draw current selected features as identify tool does (using QgsHighlight class) ? It would not need to repaint the entire map for each selection (... with many features it has bad feedback).


My apologies if this is a stupid question :-)

Interesting - the minute I tell someone, you start to spread the word. ;)

Apparently it was that way since jan 9th, but for precise it's not true anymore
- and the others should follow with the next (successful) nightly build.  Lets
see if the sip updates work everywhere...

Ola Pedro,
glad to see I'm not the only one. So it is not related to a change in packages:
what has been changed recently?

me when uploading the plugin/creating the project, etc.

Thank you very much,

I have not tried your plugin but watched the video. Looking at defining 
an angle it should be definable relative to a) the last segment b) North 
c) another (helper) point

would be useful here, too
Although I think most CAD functions for which currently nothing similar 
is available in QGIS are for construction I still think, it would be 
great to have them. (Of course not those to create 3D screws :)

The digitizingTools plugin is trying a similar approach, namely to 
combine efforts and present _one_ plugin.

I am working more or less continuely on digitzingTools (if need arises). 
I can support in Python coding.

more easy control over snapping in general: currently snapping has to be 
set for each individual layer seperately: switch snapping on/off 
completely, set snapping behaviour for all layers at once (segment, 
node), additional snapping options needed: snap to middle of line, snap 
perpendicularly

> - Add trim line

+1
trim two lines so they form a corner

> - Add extend line

digitizingTools already offers continuing digitizing of a line (though 
not CAD like in prolonging the line in the direction of its last segment)
would be great to extend several lines until they meet

> - Add ability to create arcs e.g. Tan Tan Radius; select center and add
> radius

question would be how this is to be stored in GIS format

- general: provide a means to move the map while any digitizing tool is 
active. possible solutions
a) shift/ctrl + drag
b) add scrollbars (looks arkward but users at once know what to do)


my 2cts

Hi!

Just a short question (maybe I am not getting something here)

Why do we need "sortable" aliasnames for releases that are still able
to be sorted by the version numbers?
Is there any good reason for that?

regards
Werner

I made some tests and this is only happening with postgis tables. It seams
to me that labels are being rendered around 0,0 coordinates.

This worked well in 2.0.1, possible blocker?

I'm using QGIS master 64bit in windows 7 64bit

Hello All,

There is a new category of GIS users: drone's users. There is already the
> "Video UAV Tracker" for Qgis.
>


Yes,  true !

As you can see in this image:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwg_m86uaXY1Yy1IUW8tcFRMdTA/edit?usp=sharing


For that I created a new plugin, named  "DronePlanner", that has the
following functions:


1)  create a  DronePlan  along a line, calculating  intermediate  points,
with a delta distance from focal and CCD parameters, with direction angle
shift.

2) create a zig-zag path to cover an area.

3) display the path simulation on GoogleEarth,  and take from GE the angle
parameters to recalculate the path again.

4) export the path in MikroKopter format.


Who is interested ?   :)

That's pretty amazing, a lot of my users are used to CAD software and 
want the same kind of input features. I think it should be integrated in 
core.

Something interesting would be the ability to measure without actually 
adding vertex, so that it is possible for example to start a line 
perpendicular to another one and 3 meters from an existing vertex.

Hi,

It looks very useful.

I also think this should be in the core of QGIS - or before that it
would be nice if it could be integrated in Bernhards Str?bl
DigitizingTools plugin.

I hate it when I have to enable 5 different plugins to get a decent
digitizing environment. And when I teach QGIS to new users it is most
confusing if functionality is spread among too many plugins.

So if possible - please integrate such functionality in existing plugins
or into QGIS core rather than starting a new plugin.

Thanks a lot for your efforts.

Andreas

How about using matplotlib's mplot3d ? There are already a number of
plugins using matplotlib.

Auto-trace plugin might be of your interest as well. It's ready and should appear in QGIS plugin repo soon.

Hi,

It looks very useful.

I also think this should be in the core of QGIS - or before that it would be nice if it could be integrated in Bernhards Str?bl DigitizingTools plugin.

I hate it when I have to enable 5 different plugins to get a decent digitizing environment. And when I teach QGIS to new users it is most confusing if functionality is spread among too many plugins.

So if possible - please integrate such functionality in existing plugins or into QGIS core rather than starting a new plugin.

Thanks a lot for your efforts.

Andreas

Shouldn't we create e wiki page about QGIS and 3D? We could gather these
links there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Set QgsVectorLayer.EditType to value map and
 populate value:description pairs with python
Message-ID: <CAMM2+YoCBqB+H3+r4W70tOyk0r=6XDgrKGcM1XwsdVmf9tuGZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm running QGIS Master. I would like to update a vector layer's EditType
to a ValueMap and pass in the value:description pairs using python. I
haven't ever used C++ and am having some difficulty understanding the
documentation. Through reading the documentation and trial and error I was
able to adjust the edit type to a Value map with:

vectLayer = iface.ActiveLayer()
vectLayer.setEditType(4, QgsVectorLayer.EditType(3))

where 4 is the id of the attribute I want to update and
QgsVectorLayer.EditType(3) sets the EditType to a Value Map.

And this is where I'm stuck. I can't find anything in the API docs about
how to set the value-description pairs. Any help would be greatly
appreciated!

Thanks,
Eric

May I propose we make an inventory of all the cad/digitizing plugins and
their functionalities? Maybe have a google spreadsheet where we add them,
their respective developers and the functions. Also maybe creating some sort
of roadmap or list of desired functions?

I created a spreadsheet for the plugin developers here
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aql2dM0gxEH8dHNfcjh3RGRRcFExcVFzdmxKdDhjUVE&usp=sharing
feel free to edit it as you feel

And a google doc for the proposed functions/roadmap here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OUYqdAdE7d7_fNZ-im0Uo8AAtKcOB-uO7Gu07gDNusY/edit?usp=sharing

I think if all the individual developers of all those incredible plugins
worked together in this new all in one plugin this could be awesome soon

Ol? Paolo,

I already managed to compile. I think it was corrected by Jurgen on this commit: 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/587be8cde99142e67aa236e47985110a9a74ebc7?

You're still having the same problem?

This was working in 1.8, but it's not working in 2.x releases (so far).
You may have heard of the update to "SIP API v2". Since we did this, Qt 
objects are converted to python objects to make it more natural to use 
for developers. Before that, you could just retrieve the existing 
valuemap and edit it in place, because when you called 
layer.valueMap(idx), you would receive a reference to the map QGIS 
internally works with. However, the new SIP API converts the map you 
receive to a native python dict and creates a copy of it. And if you 
edit this copy, QGIS doesn't realize, that there are changes.

So, in short: If you use 1.8, just edit the map you get back. If you 
use 2.0, I don't think there is a possibility and there won't be one in 
2.2. However, for 2.4 there will be an update which will make this 
possible again (with a new API).

Regards
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Consistency in adding layers (especially OGC)
Message-ID: <CAA-xNcV+72RgOZiHoMHBX25cxwe1EcsHVKf7KN91DanG3bHCxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
This may be too late for 2.2 (some are features), but something that's
bugging me no end is the complete lack of consistency between all the
dialogs for the OGC services. Below I've created a somewhat exhaustive list
of differences-that-shouldn't-be between the way they behave - mostly the
add-layer dialog.

However, rather than rectify the issues, would it maybe make more sense to
just create a single new dialog from scratch and use that instead? Ideally
for all formats, but if necessary, just the OGC stuff.

  What are the plans relating to add-layer dialogs? Is there a preferred
option? Or will/desire to create a universal dialog for adding layers?

Cheers,
Jonathan

-------------

*Adding Layers:*

Add/Close buttons
For WCS these are the wrong way around!

Layer Title|Name:
- For WMS, WCS - use the layer Title rather than the layer Name when adding
to the layers list (WFS & WMTS already do this).
 - Either add "Use title for layer name" checkbox to WMS/WMTS, WCS, or
remove from WFS.
- WMS seems to allow you to fill in a "Layer name" - add to other dialogs?
If so, make it more obvious what it does.

Filter:
Add Filter function for WMS, WMTS, WCS (already exists for WFS).

Differentiate windows:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9193

Tabs:
WCS: Remove "Layers" tab as pointless.
WMS/WMTS - I have no idea what "Server Search" or "Layer order" do - never
seen them active.

CRS:
All - Make CRS section same between dialogs.
WMS - why is "Tile Size" and "Feature limit for GetFeatureInfo" inside the
CRS box?

Format:
WCS or WMS/WMTS - Use same method for selecting format. One uses dropdown
(WCS), one uses checkboxes. I guess WFS doesn't need this option.

Column list:
All - In list of layers, use same order of columns and same selection of
columns.
WCS, WMS - Column widths autodetected. (Already done for WMTS, WFS)

Caching:
WCS / WFS - Offer same method for choosing caching settings.

Add Layer:
WFS - Don't close the dialog. Or Do close it for WMS/WMTS and WCS.



-------------
*Create Connection*:
WMS/WMTS - says "Create a new WMS connection" - should say WMTS too.
 WCS/WFS - Referer option (in WMS already)
WFS - "Connection details" not in bold (is on WMS/WCS)


-------------

*Metadata*:
Following on from this ticket - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8870 - suggested
changes to layer properties -> Metadata:

WMS, WMTS and WCS:
 - Don't list entire Get Capabilities in properties, only the section for
that particular layer. WFS already does this.

 - All OGC Services - Populate the Description/attribution/metadataURL from
the GetCapabilities.

Hey Jonathan,

Yes this is a bit of a known issue.  It has always been a goal of mine to
try and tackle the issue of refactoring the whole lot into single dialog.
 I have some early dialog mockups floating around that you might be able to
find, although I would tweak it a bit now.

If you have some ideas for a new single UI it would be good to have a look,
or even if you just have ideas on what you want to see.

- Nathan

Hi Nathan,
Unfortunately my talent lies with finding flaws and suggesting
tweaks/improvements to things rather than designing UI's. I'm more than
happy to offer feedback.

Is there any way to spur this along? We have a limited amount of commercial
support (we're a local authority going through "austerity measures"-
budgets dwindling); this would be good to see in 2.4 if possible.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi guys,
I'm trying to create some diagram, but I notice that qgis crashes if the
diagram are histogram styled.
No problem with pie chart and text diagram.

Running qgis master on a debian machine.

Should I open a ticket?

Cheers

Ciao Matteo,

Please open a ticket and attach sample data/steps to reproduce.
Any crash should be treated as a bug.

+1?to create an universal dialog for adding layers (or folder of files/layers)

I have resolved the same problem in a personal application integrating all formats and types in a single loading form.
Basically each provider offers a PropertyPage collection to build the ConnectionString that each provider know to open.

I attach a short video to show the idea (~2.5 mb).

Alvaro

Hi,

Are there any User Interface Design (UX) Guidelines for QGIS?
Is there a need to define/refine/adapt ones?
I didn't find much for QGIS in this mailing list and elsewhere.

--Stefan

P.S. Here are some generic ones I can recommend:
* (Graphical) User Interface (UI/GUI) Design with Qt:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qt-gui-concepts.html
* Windows 8 App UX Guidelines:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465424.aspx

Hi Stefan,

You can find the HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) starting on line 1441 of

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/CODING.t2t

Best wishes,

The QgsWCSSourceSelect was written as subclass of QgsOWSSourceSelect
with intention to use later the QgsOWSSourceSelect also for other
services but I never got time to finish that. I am not even sure if it
is the right way, maybe it is easier to just keep it visually in sync.

Hi J?rgen,

Can the work outlined below, to move the interrupting dialog's
functionality to top of Composer's Composition Panel, be included with 2.2
release?

Larry

Hi Anita and J?rgen

Vielen Dank! That's a starting point.
There remains still much to say, like "where to place QButtonBox for
OK / Cancel / Help?", what default font size, etc.
Is it wrong to point at least to "UI Design with Qt" for further
reading in the "Developers guide for QGIS"?

Hi all.
Lidar data in LAS format are increasingly widespread. Leaving aside all 3D frenzy, we
would be interested in simply displaying them in QGIS, with their useful attributes
(classification and intensity), either with a native driver or through an available
library. All the licensing issues around libLAS/LSTools are a bit obscure to me, so I
wonder if someone has already dealt with this.
Any hint would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
All the best.

We need to have much more complete guidelines (preferably with visuals
illustrating how different design situations should be handled). I believe
that the UX are going to tackle something like that. Posting to external
docs may also be worthwhile in the short term.

Have you looked into PDAL [0][1]? It is already in OSGeo4W 32-bit, though
apparently not in 64-bit yet [2][3]. On the Mac side, it is already
available in the Homebrew package manager [4]. It appears to be BSD
3-Clause licensed.

Not entirely sure of its full API, but seems to be an ideal candidate for a
Processing provider, yes?

While I am not a Lidar guru by any means, it looks like the JSON output
from PDAL [5] is also an input for three.js [6], e.g. Qgis2threejs PyQGIS
plugin. So that is fairly interesting... may be possible to load in a
clipped .las file and visualize your map canvas on it? That would be very
cool.

Hi !


Thanks for all the replies !! I updated the plugin which should work on
mac/linux now, please give it a try ! Do you think it's too soon to put it
in the plugin repo as experimental at this stage ?


*INPUT vs TOOLS*

I understand one of the main concern is avoiding to have a CAD-plugins
proliferation, and I totally agree.

It's quite hard to draw the line on what can be packaged in one plugin and
what should rather be kept in another one.

I'd say we can distinguish between what really is about
- INPUT (coordinates, snapping, constraints, mouse, units ...)
and
- TOOLS (extend, trim, offset, rotate, create shapes ...)

In my opinion, mixing both in a unique plugin is a bad idea :
- at long term, we may want to integrate the INPUT part in QGIS's core, as
keeping TOOLS part as plugins may seem more relevant (easier to extend).
- TOOLS are feature specific. Some of them will operate only on polygons,
some other only on points, whereas INPUT should aim to be generally
available as possible.
- it's a conceptual soup

Of course, INPUT would allow to do some things that could also be
implemented as a specific TOOL. In Autocad, for instance, you can
extend/trim a line either with the extend/trim tool, or by moving a vertex
and taking advantage of the snapping system. That doesn't make one of them
useless.
INPUT can also enhance the way you use TOOLs. Take the rectangle-oval
digitizing plugin : thanks to CadInput, you can (well, you could, if it
worked better with drag-type tools) enter precise numeric input.


*TOOLS plugin ideas*

So I'd say packaging different CAD-tools in an unique and consistent plugin
is another (urgent) task. A key point may be classification.
IMO, a good start would be a toolbar by layer type (point, line, polygon)
in which all tools would be ordered/separated by funtion type (create,
reshape, merge/split, modify, delete...). The available toolbar would only
show when editing the corresponding layer type.
Native tools could be integrated in this classification as well.

To get a polished and consistent user experience, I think we need some
solid abstract tool classes, which takes care of how input is organised in
terms of UI (common interface for point/segment/object/numeric input) and
logic (operands then operation, or operation then operands). The QGIS C++
tool class leaves (too) much freedom to subclasses.
A great work towards such a plugin would be to try to implement that base
classe(s) in python. It would then be much easier for contributors to
extend the tool set. And in the end, the base class could be implemented in
C++.


Well that was it !


Regards,

Olivier


PS:

@Saber Razmjooei:
I didn't find auto-trace (guess it's not approved yet?)

@Leyan
Yes it's a good idea. There is already a construction mode which allows to
enter points without creating features. It could be made available even
when not using an editTool...

Thanks a lot Larry. PDAL is certainly interesting, as it is used and supported by
PostGIS [0]. Unfortunately is not (yet?) available on Debian-based OSs, but I guess
this can change. What would be good is, rather than (or in addition to) a Processing
provider, a data provider. I guess this should be developed from scratch, right?
All the best.

Hi List,
I have a friend, not in South Africa, who has a need to bundle raster & 
vector data with a map viewer, so that the entire package can be 
deployed via a DVD.
The catch is that usage of the data bundled with this DVD, needs to 
expire after 12 months.

So, does anyone know of a QGIS based solution - even if it comes with a 
proprietary encryption module that allows for an expiry date?

I'd be curious if anyone has implemented such solution.

I also think that there may be a possibility of fee for someone to 
develop such capability.

Regards and thanks,
Zoltan

Hi,

if I'm not wrong last year we have proposal for GSoC project with goal
to add native support for LAS data to QGIS [0]. Unfortunately this project
was not accepted.

Maybe we can found contacts of the author of this proposal and look
if he available for help?

That's a pretty messed up product I wouldn't go anywhere near. But short
answer is this isn't a QGIS specific thing it's DRM which the Video Game
industry has plenty of solutions for, most of which are completely
circumventable by smart computer users.

Hi Paolo,

This would probably be quite a different way of dealing with the data 
source. I suppose the idea would be to fetch all the points at once and 
store them in a kd-tree. Otherwise, refreshing the canvas would take 
ages to refresh.

The laslib [0,1] (from lastools) is LGPL.

But there is also liblas [2] which is available on Osgeo4W and has 
debian packages.
The code is on github [3], there is the licence info:

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all,
thanks for following up. Of course we need some smart way to deal with such huge
amounts of points (that's why I think we need a brand new provider). libLAS and PDAL
seem to overlap, and at least one developer is involved in both: does anybody know
why, and which one would be better to use?
All the best.

Largely my thoughts too - but I didn't think of steering him towards the 
gaming industry.....

Just to narrow down the prejudice a bit, what about a situation where a 
local authority is giving out a specific dataset that needs to be 
current, or at least non-editable?

I expect one could watermark the datasets with a routine that the 
source-code is not available for. This watermark could have multiple 
date-stamps that would "help" in not being able to turn the computer 
clock back - and the data encryption could render it useless for 
anything except the viewer it came with - in QGIS case, the inclusion of 
a hook to the binary subroutine that encrypted (ok, messed up :-) ) the 
data.

Just a thought to stir up some discussion.

The best way is to provide your data with a proper disclaimer of use.

Trying to add some lock is just useless. Anyone who will really wants to 
fully get or edit the data will still be able to do it.
You will just make your bundle less usable, and loose some time/money at 
trying to implement this.

How do you think that the survey services are publishing the land 
registry? For sure not on DVDs with DRM. But their data has time frame 
validity and is supposed to be read-only....

Cheers,

Denis

if I'm not wrong, pdal is the successor of liblas as it is meant to 
access more file format and provide the same set of functionalities than 
gdal.

Other interesting tools and libs are PCL, CLoudCompare, SPDLib/Viewer

Hi Olivier,

This is excellent work, thank you.

+1 on uploading it as experimental.

As already stated, I also believe that we would all benefit from a 
common framework for digitizing/CAD plugins.
If we could merge them all into one plugin, it would be awesome, plus 
this could be merged into core easier.

Best,
Angelos

+1 to publish

Great work, just what I needed in my everyday routine as a licensed
surveyor. QGIS is one more step closer to replacing proprietary CAD
application... If it were not for LISP routines, we would hardly be using
5% of CAD features anyway... And here we have Python ;-)...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labeling toolbar activating signals?
Message-ID: <1390990183922-5100666.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, 
I'm upgrading EasyCustomLableing plugin to 2.x API (late, I know).
I'm having troubles activating correctly labeling toolbar buttons.
When using StartEditing on active layer, with all labeling parameter
correctly set, following buttons don't activate, while others do:
- pin/unpin
-show/hide,
-move 
-rotate. 

When pressing editing button from GUI, thoses buttons activate correctly, so
my layer is correctly set. 

I tried following commands without success:


Any idea of what action to call , or what signal to emit?
Cheers
R?gis

I suppose you mean:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2013-November/037613.html
So the idea is writing an OGR driver for PDAL.
Still unsure if the result would be usable in QGIS, for performance reasons.
Anyway, the indication seems to go with PDAL rather than libLAS, good to know.
Thanks a lot.

Hi Paolo, about "performance reasons" recently we spoken about this item in other thread:

[Qgis-developer] On the fly simplication of point layer


In order to render so big layers as LAS files are, there are two strategies, discard points on renderer side, or on featureiterator side by distance proximity.

I think interesting to continue this item.
Alvaro

Hi !

Ok the plugin is published in the repo (with a nice icon for the occasion
;) ) ! Champagne !

I wanted to say that if you need a hand on implementing things in the API,

*Help on the API is more than welcome ! (I'm too much of a newbie in C++ to
do any serious work).*

*I'd say the C and D improvements suggested in the readme are the easiest
and could be a good point to start.*

*The E improvement (an UI improvement rather than API improvement) would be
welcome also (and be appreciated beyond the scope of this plugin).*

*I'm not sure if the A use useful, but it should be easy to implement and
may be useful to other plugins.*

*B would probably require more work (refactoring every single map tool,
unless we integrate the snapping hack as a default implementation, which I
think is a very bad idea).*
*I'd say before doing something like this, it could be a nice idea to think
about the point I made in my last post about a more rigid base class for
mapTools.*

Do you have a build environment? If so, while in the feature freeze period,
> we could work on a different branch.


*Yes, so testing another branch is no problem.*

By the way, was that a paid development or personal initiative?


*It is a personal initiative (i'm of course open to post-work sponsoring ;)
).*


Cheers,

Olivier

Hi Alvaro,
so you suggest to use a general approach to simplification, rather than having a
specialized las provider, right?
All the best, and thanks.

yes, it can be implemented on renderer level (Martin Dobias propose it) or on featureiterator level similar to current simplification classes for line and polygons

I think it is pending for a test of performance

Can it performs fast enough to display hundred millions points or 
billions at once ? Does it leverage a quadtree approach ?

I think but using a?quadtree approach there is a problem,?and it is none other than the construction of the quadtree itself for so big data.

IMHO I would use a specific provider (with a specific featureiterator) reading sequentially?the LAS file and discarding points before fetch it to renderer using the RectangleFilter of current FeatureRequest. It avoid create many-many QgsFeature's that after are discarded in renderer side.

I use this technique in a personal viewer, and after first read of file (the file is cached in SO), the following drawings are quite fast.

Hi Alvaro,
That seems really interesting, hopefully something similar thing can be
created for QGIS. Your video shows how slick it can be.

I've created a fairly bland issue for this - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9451
What's next?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Personally I do not think we can treat lidar data like with ordinary
vector layer. Using vector layer for point clouds seems like trying to
represent raster data as vector layer with square polygon per raster
cell - it is possible, but very sub-optimal. Also, lots of
functionality in vector layers does not make much sense for point
clouds. I believe the right approach would be to create a new type of
map layer and handle everything there. For a proof of concept, it
could be a new "plugin" layer type.

Most lidar files are not spatially ordered so with a sequential read you 
will end up reading the whole file, it's like accessing a untiled 
unpyramided bigtiff : painful.

I believe this is how uDig does it too.  Maybe good to have a look at uDig for inspiration as well?

Hi Alvaro,
That seems really interesting, hopefully something similar thing can be created for QGIS. Your video shows how slick it can be.

I've created a fairly bland issue for this - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9451
What's next?

Cheers,
Jonathan

I attach a short video to show the idea (~2.5 mb).

Hi Nathan,
Unfortunately my talent lies with finding flaws and suggesting tweaks/improvements to things rather than designing UI's. I'm more than happy to offer feedback.

Is there any way to spur this along? We have a limited amount of commercial support (we're a local authority going through "austerity measures"- budgets dwindling); this would be good to see in 2.4 if possible.

If you have some ideas for a new single UI it would be good to have a look, or even if you just have ideas on what you want to see.

Adding Layers:

Add/Close buttons
For WCS these are the wrong way around!

Layer Title|Name:
- For WMS, WCS - use the layer Title rather than the layer Name when adding to the layers list (WFS & WMTS already do this).
- Either add "Use title for layer name" checkbox to WMS/WMTS, WCS, or remove from WFS.
- WMS seems to allow you to fill in a "Layer name" - add to other dialogs? If so, make it more obvious what it does.

Filter:
Add Filter function for WMS, WMTS, WCS (already exists for WFS).

Differentiate windows:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9193

Tabs:
WCS: Remove "Layers" tab as pointless.
WMS/WMTS - I have no idea what "Server Search" or "Layer order" do - never seen them active.

CRS:
All - Make CRS section same between dialogs.
WMS - why is "Tile Size" and "Feature limit for GetFeatureInfo" inside the CRS box?

Format:
WCS or WMS/WMTS - Use same method for selecting format. One uses dropdown (WCS), one uses checkboxes. I guess WFS doesn't need this option.

Column list:
All - In list of layers, use same order of columns and same selection of columns.
WCS, WMS - Column widths autodetected. (Already done for WMTS, WFS)

Caching:
WCS / WFS - Offer same method for choosing caching settings.

Add Layer:
WFS - Don't close the dialog. Or Do close it for WMS/WMTS and WCS.



-------------
Create Connection:
WMS/WMTS - says "Create a new WMS connection" - should say WMTS too.
WCS/WFS - Referer option (in WMS already)
WFS - "Connection details" not in bold (is on WMS/WCS)


-------------

Metadata:
Following on from this ticket - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8870 - suggested changes to layer properties -> Metadata:

WMS, WMTS and WCS:
 - Don't list entire Get Capabilities in properties, only the section for that particular layer. WFS already does this.

 - All OGC Services - Populate the Description/attribution/metadataURL from the GetCapabilities.

Would LASTools add anything to the conversation? I do believe they 
re-order the file (but I've not used it).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] $scale not evaluated
Message-ID: <1391004913972-5100717.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi again, 
the very usefull $scale variable seems to be not evaluated everywhere in
QGIS interface.

- in Dufour 2.0, only label expression seem to get the value

- in master, label expression and data defined symbol properties have it,
but ruled based renderer gets nothing . 
Anyone has this behaviour? 

Is there any workaround in QGIS 2.0 to show/hide feature based on their
screen size. I use ($length / $scale) > threshold but $scale is broken .. 

R?gis

You are right,?but only if it is possible to generate the quadtree?on the fly?(millions of points), or preprocess it to disk.

this doc uses a mixed strategy (I used it and it works fine)...
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/papers/ilss-scdt-06.pdf


a first pass read the file to build a special quadtree which only save the number of points of each quad-item.
when the data is readed, it?accumulates the points, and when a?quad-item has all points, then it returns a releases the buffer of this?quad-item.

Hi,

I contacted Howard Butler, one of the developers of PDAL, about possibly
providing some input on questions we have in this thread, and believe he is
now subscribed to the list.

Howard, any ideas on a strategy for using PDAL in QGIS, e.g. via proposed
GDAL support, as a separate data provider, and/or utilizing its command
line utilities via a Processing plugin provider?

Regards,

Larry

IMVHO we need a data provider rather (before) than processing tools.
I believe this would be easier with a dedicated provider rather than through GDAL,
but I leave the question to Howard or others.
All the best.

I think authorities have tried to do this in the past with poor quality
images and pdfs where all the layers are sandwiched together and not
meant to be disassembled. So that the only way to extract the data
beyond viewing is hand digitizing and recoding of the attributes.

I agree with Denis though that a more sensible approach is to just state
the time limits on the data. Or you can be nefarious like some road
atlas producers and seed small fictitious data that makes it easier to
catch people using the data improperly.

Enjoy,
Alex

Hi,

Since LIDAR data 1. has a special data structure 2. is huge and 3.
needs index, using a database with QGIS as client seems to me a
natural architectural decision.
As you may know, PostgreSQL has a pointcloud extension made by the
"father" of PostGIS, Paul.
See e.g. my wiki notes and presentation here: http://giswiki.hsr.ch/PointCloud

Here's a little background on PDAL, where it is today, and where it hopes to go. First, PDAL was started due to the fact that I was doing lots of not-related-to-LAS point cloud processing for my work in point cloud data management. Specifically, we were using Oracle Point Cloud [1] to store and extract massive holdings of point cloud data for the US Army Corps of Engineers. At the time, Oracle was the only game in town for such an activity, but the tools around it to get data in and out of the system were deficient, and PDAL grew out of the need to fortify these. PDAL, as its namesake that it apes, aims to be a data translation and light duty processing library for point cloud data. Its initial niche is the same that GDAL fills -- providing an abstract API for translating disparate point cloud data formats. It also has some processing capabilities, but these are very much in the GIS rather than visualization or exploitation domain. 

libLAS was indeed the precursor to my work in PDAL, and it was focused explicitly on ASPRS LAS manipulation. libLAS came into existence due to the fact that Martin Isenburg's LASlib was unavailable at the time under an open source license. Now that LASlib (and many of LAStools) are available under a straight LGPL license, the reason for existence for libLAS is mostly gone. About the only feature it provides that LASlib doesn't is more complete SRS handling through its use of GDAL utilities and color overlay using a GDAL datasource. Both of these could be fixed with a few pull requests to LASlib. These features do exist in PDAL, however.  The difference between PDAL and LAStools is both mindset and features. PDAL right now at least focuses on data access with chain-able filtering. LAStools focuses on exploitation and leverage of features of the ASPRS LAS format (of which there are many).

PDAL defines a processing pipeline which on one end defines a datasource and on the other defines a data consumer. It has driver capabilities that are similar in concept, if not implementation, to GDAL's, including features like dynamically loaded plugins. My history, admiration, and familiarity with GDAL informs many concepts in PDAL although the API is a bit more C++'ish. PDAL also contains a command line application http://www.pdal.io/apps.html for manipulating and translating data via invocation, and a VRT-like XML pipeline language http://www.pdal.io/pipeline.html that allows you to define operations and filtering steps and execute them without having to write C++ to do it. 

As was mentioned, it's not really feasible to treat all the points in a point cloud as OGC simple features-style points. The quantity of data is simply too much. Are you going to render them in 3D? If you are looking to do 3D rendering, you might look to CloudCompare. CC is QT-based. Maybe there's opportunity to embed CloudCompare in some way inside of QGIS as its 3D renderer/plugin. Then both can be used together but evolve separately. The approach could easily be a goose chase too, but developing a satisfactory point cloud rendering capability is likely to be a significant effort. I do know that I hope to someday provide some patches to CloudCompare so it can consume PDAL datasources (it currently only consumes LAS data through libLAS). Having a capable cross-platform viewer handy is important for all kinds of tasks.

Are you going to simply generate a DEM? https://github.com/CRREL/points2grid points2grid provides a simple DEM generation capability. It can currently be used at the endpoint of a PDAL pipeline to generate ascii grids. With some development, this could be updated to output any GDAL-writeable raster type. I think this is where talk about the GDAL provider is aiming, but I'm not so sure. LAStools also provides DEM-generation capabilities, though I'm not sure if these are commercial or open source.

I think the first question to answer for a QGIS point cloud capability is to define what it will do. Is it a renderer/viewer? Product processing pipeline? Everything? I think it is important to keep the scope limited for the first few attempts to feel out the problem. 

I am currently in the process of finishing up the first official release of PDAL, 1.0.0. There have been a number of folks following along and contributing to PDAL as it has matured, and it is used in production for a number of our point cloud warehousing activities, but I have been hesitant to call it "done" enough to invite company to come over and see it. I suppose that feeling is true of all software. Anyway, I plan to do some push on packaging efforts, including Homebrew, OSGeo4W64, and UbuntuGIS, after the 1.0.0 release to make it easy for folks to utilize the capabilities. If anyone with experience in those environments is interested in chipping in, I'd be happy to help guide the effort.

I am *very* interested in supporting this in any way I can. My original
background is Computer Graphics so writing point rendering engines is
something I "should" be good at (makes you wonder, though, if you ever used
lasview) ... (-;

I have been spending a lot of time capacity building in the Asia / Pacific
region and the combination of QGIS and LAStools could be a much more useful
training tool if there was native LAS/LAZ visualization and simple editing
in QGIS. ESRI's ignorant move [1,2,3] on creating a new proprietary LiDAR
format puts this on the front-burner for several passionate geo-geeks.

I suggest to do this in a multi-step approach:

(1) single LAS/LAZ file support: biggest (initial) bang for this buck. a
relatively simple in-core point viewer with basic point inspecting,
coloring, and editing capacity. This alone would cause ripples. 

(2) area-of-interest selection from one/multiple LAS/LAZ files from a
corresponding map of boundary polygons and/or hillshade or intensity rasters
computes for the LiDAR

(3) long term: support for interactive browsing of entire LiDAR projects via
pyramiding and spatial indexing from (slightly-processed) folders of LAS/LAZ
or via a PDAL/PostGIS pipeline connection.

I would be excited to get personally involved starting on (1) followed by
(2) asap. The OSGeo Code Sprint in Vienna would seem like the perfect
gathering to get a skeleton functionality in place as several names in this
thread are listed to show up there.

My bad, sorry for that. In preparation for a new feature release I have
simplified the license and the wording for LAStools / LASlib / LASzip (or so
I hope).

Hope to see many of you in Vienna.

Yep - I agree that it is a fruitless venture - quite frankly, even the 
"license to use" methodology gives one no real peace of mind.
When this request popped into my mailbox, I figured it was worth a shot 
putting it "out there", as I had not given this any thought for a number 
of years now.
Interestingly, nothing has changed.
It is local authority information, and I have very strong views that it 
should be "free to all", because public money was used to 
gather/assemble the data set in the first place.

But, as I said, the request was not from a South African authority, so 
maybe that (African) country still needs to go down that road.

Mankind is not known for learning from history :-)

Regards & thanks to all who gave some input.
Zoltan

>  If anyone with experience in those environments is interested in chipping in, I'd be happy to help guide the effort. 

yes, I am interested 
:)

I worked for years in LiDAR data survey and processing, and I writed a program, named LaserDrink :)  that displays in realtime TerraSolid BIN point clouds, using a temporary WRL PointSet elements and the Coin3D library. 
Ok, time is passed, but my interest is the same, or more. 

Your suggestions are "music for my ears" :)  because they follow the same path I walked on:
CloudCompare is the best choice where to insert the hand, to have a tool for display and manipulate very BIG data ( and only who worked with lidar data knows how big and random they are... :)

Well, shortly: if I can give any help to implementation, MacOSX porting, italian documentation or ... other, simply tell me  :)

Thank you

Glad to see my request has spurred so much interest.
Let's keep on this discussion here, and see you in Vienna.

agreed fully. as I indicated in my original email, displaying data with their bsic
attributes is the first and most important step IMHO.

all the best, and thanks.

Hi all, 
answering to myself, Qgis requires a beginEditCommand to activate correctly
all editing tools:

self.iface.setActiveLayer(labelMapLayer )
labelLayer.startEditing()
self.iface.actionToggleEditing().setEnabled(True)
labelLayer.beginEditCommand("labeling action")

R?gis

Well, it doesn't always work. 
Anyone knows why startEditing() on a layer in Python does not activate all
labeling and editing buttons?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi all.
I have been pointed out to a problem in inserting dates in Oracle. How does one
specify which format does the data have? Is it a parameter to be set at connection,
or server side?

The error is:

    SQL: ORA-01843: not a valid month
    Impossibile eseguire l'istruzione
    Errore: INSERT INTO
"QGIS_TEST"."ZONA_RECUPERO"("SHAPE","VINCSIDE","VINCSCODTI","CODTIPCART","VINSSUPERF","LEGIDESTAR","VINCSDATAI","VINCSDATAF","LEGIDESTOP","GEOLINK")
VALUES (:f,'23005869',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'14/04/2014','31/12/2999',NULL,NULL) "

If we use to_date('2007/05/31','YYYY/MM/DD') instead, the INSERT goes well.

All the best, and thanks a lot.

Hi all,
I'm creating a print template and I noticed that the bar scale doesn't
update when loading layer with different extent. So scale bar results
extremely huge or small depending on the new layer uploaded in the print
composer.

Any hint?

Cheers

Hi,

I have to confirm that the file size is huge and saving performance is slow.
I'd like to emphasize that this is a show stopper for me for/against
Spatialite to become "the Shapefile of the future"!
I did not yet look into the QGIS driver code, but I assume (and hope)
that at least the saving performance can be enhanced.

Hi all

Could you try to use this commands in QGIS python console ? I have seen
that the parameter 1 in the function initspatialmetadata is very important
to have a very fast DB creation. If you are on Windows, change the path
"/tmp/test.db" by a more appropriate one.

from pyspatialite import dbapi2 as db
conn=db.connect('/tmp/test.db')
c=conn.cursor()
sql = "select initspatialmetadata(1)"
c.execute(sql) ; print [row for row in c]

Michael

I'm really sorry but I'm currently very busy, so I

Message-ID: <bfb49785fd203b8c743150831f55e359@lqt.it>

Just few technical considerations (may be useful):

a) any SpatiaLite DB (even one completely empty) is usually
    expected to consume about 4 MB.
    this is because the complete EPSG dataset (geodesic parameters)
    will be fully populated during the initial creation steps, and
    there are about 4.000+ SRID definitions to be stored in the
    "spatial_ref_sys" table.

b) surely yes: SQLite/SpatiaLite is a TRANSACTIONAL DBMS;
    attempting to perform several thousands INSERTS not
    opportunely contained within some BEGIN TRANSACTION statement
    will certainly cause a painful slowness.
    because in this case the SQL engine will then wait for every
    single row to be physically written to the hard disk before
    passing to process the next row ... an obvious performance
    killer.
    starting from the more recent versions of spatialite
    (> 4.0) SELECT InitSpatialMetadata(1) will automatically
    begin a transaction (1 stands for "with transaction")

c) may be I'm wrong about this, but from my personal tests
    it looks like as if a new DB will unconditionally be
    created for each SHP to be exported.
    any attempt to select an already existing DB will simply
    cause the whole DB to be overwritten.
    this seems to be a rather extravagant implementation,
    because after all the main advantage in using SpatiaLite
    is in that you can easily store many hundredths vector
    layers into the same DB file.
    but I'm unable to see any button like "add this layer
    to an already existing DB"

d) I was able to successfully save a POINT and a LINESTRING
    SHP, but while attempting to save a MULTIPOLYGON SHP
    I got an impressive list of severe errors complaining
    about mismatching Geometries.
    I strongly suspect that the layer type has been incorrectly
    defined in this more complex case.

e) last but not least.
    I read in the "save as" dialog this definition:
    "SpatiaLite [OGR] [*.sqlite *.SQLITE"]
    so I presume that this export operation isn't directly
    handled by the spatialite's own data-provider, but is
    indirectly handled by OGR.
    anyway, AFAIK OGR nicely supports several specific
    arguments allowing to finely control how to handle
    TRANSACTIONs, allowing to create a new layer into
    an already existing DB, and even allowing to nicely
    control mixed-type Geoms (i.e. POLYGON/MULTIPOLYGON
    from the same layer).
    so I imagine that some kind of improvement should be
    surely possible by carefully checking the arguments
    passed to OGR (the actual implementation seems to be
    rather simplistic and not fully adequate).

bye Sandro

To revisit your original immediate need, does the output from Howard's

Hi Larry,
we do not have immediate needs, it's a mid-term goal to make LAS data
available in QGIS.
Thanks anyway for the suggestion, interesting; probably it would be good
to check if there is something we can integrate or reuse.
All the best.

Although I know you're going to try it in Vienna, I would like to recover the idea of ??creating a new type of layer (eg QgsPointCloudLayer) that inherits from QgsVectorLayer to provide all the basic?vector?functionality (including a new simplification of proximity to fast rendering), and add extra capabilities for these data types: output rasters, 3D profiles, 3D visualization in plugins ...

Alvaro

Hi Roberto,

I think we have to separate these topics:

- support for georef PLY binary tins, that begins to be the standard
output from SfM Structure from Motion drone aerial video and photo low
cost surveys.

- SfM output into QGIS

Structure from Motion - A Visual Approach
http://ccwu.me/vsfm/

Tim has also this example in Mosaicking Aerial Photos with GDAL

Image Mosaicking with GDAL
http://linfiniti.com/2009/09/image-mosaicking-with-gdal/

It might be good to have QGIS plugin for Mosaicking Aerial Photos from UAV.

Open source UAV (ArduPilotMega (APM2.x), Mission Planner and APM
Planner 2.0)  are gaining traction in UAV Technology and Aerial Photo
Mapping.

We are using APM2.x UAV for forestry plantation aerial photos.

APM 2.x UAVs are discussed in this site.

Thanks.

Hi to all,

I'm using the point diplacement style. I noticed that it doesn't use the
new label engine for labelling the diplaced simbol, so the collision engine
doesnt' work.
There's in plain to migrate it to the new label engine? It could be useful
if I open a ticket ?

I also have some visualization problem, because at some scale the point
displaced symbols disappear (tested on qgis 2.10 Master - Ubuntu
13.04-64bit). Anyone can confirm this problem ?

Thanks in advance

I usually also tend towards just doing - but this time, with LIDAR
it's probably a good advice to think and discuss first
It's really a tricky thing. See e.g. Paul Ramsey's Talk at FOSS4G
2013, Birmingham:
http://elogeo.nottingham.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/url/186/pgpointcloud-foss4-2013.pdf

Exactly.

P.S. BTW there is another "battle field" over at the format definition
side which currently needs some attention:

Hi Luca,

I can't help with the labeling. At the time the point displacement
renderer was developed (about 5 years ago), the labeling engine wasn't
as advanced as it is today. So it wasn't an option and also not
necessary to the project.

I would not regard this as a bug request, but as a feature request and I
guess it would a substantial bit of work to integrate the new labeling
engine with the point displacement renderer.

Do you have an idea how it should behave? I guess, depending on how many
points there are there isn't a solution to perfectly label all points.

-----

The point displacement renderer could also be improved to display points
in a cluster, not just around the circle, but also inside the circle.
This would be more complex to implement, but it would save map/screen
space and would visually more pleasing.

If you have funds available - please consider hiring a developer.

-----

Regarding the second issue: this may be a bug. Or in extreme cases - if
you have many points at a single location - the circle could be so big
that it is rendered outside of the visible rendered map area.

I am also a user of the point-displacement renderer - so I would like to
see improvments in this feature!

Thank you for bringing this up.

Andreas

Hello Alvaro,

I just writed a program that displays in real time LiDAR point cloud data.

That program, named "LaserDrink" reads quickly TerraSolid Laser BIN format
( the father of LAS ... )  and writes a temporary WRL file that the Coin3D
viewer, then,  displays.
My temp WRL  contains the point cloud "class", or the "RGB" photo color, or
the color by height.   Also, the point aspect can be set, and it is
possible to display them greater or smaller, to realize a "3D photo" like
visualization.

OK, this was LaserDrink.    BTW, with it, I could insert TODAY the support
in QGis of LiDAR poin cloud real time display.

Someone is interested ?

:)

Ciao

Roberto

Hi Andreas,

thanks for your prompt reply !
I start to use this useful function for a project ant it resolve to me a
lot of problem.

I have at least 4-5 point in the circle. My points stay in a layer,
geographically "linked" with another point layer (all point have the same
coord) that contain only 1 point. I have 2 kind of problem:
- the first one is when I have just 1 point in the first layer, so the
point is not drawn in a circle and  the two layer are overlapping. On kind
solution is to allow to displace point in a circle also when there is just
one point in a place.

- the second one is when I have more than 1 point and the label of the
displaced point overlapping with the second layer label.

I can try to put this requests in my next commitment to qgis developers.

I noticed this bug also with 2 point and a small circle. I can investigate
deeper and try it also with 2.0 qgis version.

Thanks Denis, this is close but not totally related.
I finally managed to activate the buttons but this is like vaudou magic to
me:

I create a memory layer, and triggers actionToggleEditing once, and then a
second time but only after having refreshed the canvas.. :


        self.iface.setActiveLayer(labelMapLayer )
        labelLayer.startEditing()
        self.iface.actionToggleEditing().trigger()
        

       
        # connects label layer attributes values changed to
labelLayerModified function 
        labelLayer.attributeValueChanged.connect(self.labelLayerModified)
        
         #redraws registry and mapcanvas.
        if hasattr(labelMapLayer, "setCacheImage" ):
            labelMapLayer.setCacheImage(None )

        labelMapLayer.triggerRepaint()
        self.iface.legendInterface().refreshLayerSymbology( labelMapLayer )
        self.iface.actionToggleEditing().trigger()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] EditCommand (UndoAction) mandatory?
Message-ID: <52EB7874.9040101@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Yesterday I added some signals to QgsVectorLayer which are emitted in 
calls to beginEditCommand, endEditCommand and destroyEditCommand. This 
makes it possible for consumers of edit signals (attributeValueChanged 
etc.) to wait for a batch operation to finish and update once at the 
end. Example: In the case of the attribute table and an update to all 
columns from the field calculator it results in an enormous speed boost, 
if it is updated only once at the end of an operation and not for every 
single feature.

What I am doing now is to cache the "bounds" (min/max column/row) of 
changed attributes and when the next endEditCommand is made update 
everything within.

Now the question is: Can I rely on endEditCommand being called for every 
operation? Or do I have to check for out-of-edit-command changes and 
update immediately in this case?

Regards,
Matthias

Hi,

QGIS prevent to overwrite the primary key field when it copies/pastes, 
this is why it leaves the field empty.
One way would be to add the constraint after the copy/paste if it's for 
a single shot.
Otherwise, just add a unique constraint on f1 and add a serial as 
primary key.

Cheers,

Denis

Snap to intersection makes you snap to just that intersection point. Did a
test with two polygon layers and a point layer. Adding a point to the point
layer, while within the snap tolerance, made the point appear right on the
intersection between the two polygon layers. Removing the 'Enable snapping
on intersection' made the point not snap to the intersection.

I have set snapping settings to both polygon layers, prehaps you missed that
in the snap options.

Hi Jakob,
I tried as you described, in various combinations, but could not see a difference
between activating and deactivating the option.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] EasyCustomLabeling ported to QGIS 2.0
Message-ID: <1391188663179-5101254.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi there, 
I ported EasyCustomLabeling to new API so that it should be very few clicks
to make such maps in a few clicks:


<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/n5101254/EasyCustomLabelin0.5.png> 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ru3javeedl3urg/EasyCustomLabelin0.5.png
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ru3javeedl3urg/EasyCustomLabelin0.5.png>  

I would be pleased to get some feedback on it, from either users or dev's.

*Still here are some issues and one blocker I encountered:*

- Memory Layer Saver plugin can save the labeling layers BUT* can't restore
correctly unpinned labels* (free labels). It seems related to NULL - None -
PyQtNullVariant stuff. If someone has an idea, the plugin could then be
totally usefull. see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9148. Help !

- Signals attributeValueChanged seem sends floats values in string type when
manual editions are done in attribute table. Need a ticket? 

- There is no attributeValueChanged signal emitted when using field
calculator.. So some Callouts won't be updated if user choose to edit a
bunch of labels (to get them aligned for instance). 

Cheers!
R?gis
