Message-ID: <000001cae8ec$414139c0$c3c3ad40$@detecnik@jkp-sg.si>

I have a suggestion for better copy and paste features. 

When paste features qgis have to paste attributes with same name in both
table otherwise leave attribute null.

 

Thanks, Joze.

Hi Paolo,

You are obviously using a the newer version of rpy2. I have an updated
version of manageR which works with the newer versions of rpy2, but
I'm on holidays at the moment, so it won't be available in the repos
for at least a week and a half. Sorry for the inconvinience, but the
new version of manageR will be well worth the wait!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Getting WGS84 for a point
Message-ID: <h2kd8ad40b51005021201p798be510k8d4e95cd4437751f@mail.gmail.com>

I'm  trying to sort out the right way of getting from a click on the
map canvas to WGS84 coords for passing to web services that use WGS84
- this is for my clickfu plugin.

Currently the code looks to see if there's a CRS for the project, and
converts the click to WGS84 using a transform based on the project
CRS.

However if I start a new project and load in a shapefile with, say, an
OSGB CRS set in it's .prj file, my code doesn't do anything special,
doesn't find a project CRS, and so sends google maps a query with
lat=4453500 and lng=6755300.

Perhaps my code should check if the current layer has a CRS and
transform to WGS84 based on that instead of testing for a project CRS?
Or should it do both? Which first? Or am I doing something wrong here?

Thx

Barry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No "Type" in a SpatiaLite View
Message-ID: <20100502222354.180630@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I have a problem with a view in SpatiaLite.

The view has two columns.
First is a "Real"-Value from a Table and the other is the same "Real"-Value added with a Integer(constant).

Now I see in the SpatiaLite GUI tool or in QGIS the first Type as a "REAL" and the second as "" (No type).
But I need it also as a "REAL" Value. Because I can't select it in the Symbology as a "Graduated Symbol" when it's not a "REAL" Value.

The value itself is "REAL", I cast(x as REAL) it, and test it with typeof(x)

Can someone tell me something about this? I would be happy!
Thank you!

Greets Simon

Message-ID: <p2x25bc040b1005030320p5fdfa2efo91eb3fdb908cb782@mail.gmail.com>

As a problem related to the recent thread about "No 'Type' in a
SpatiaLite View" reported by Simon Keller, I have a related more
fundamental question:

Has anybody ever managed to load and display a SpatiaLite/SQLite layer
into QGIS when the source is a VIEW instead of a TABLE?

Yours
-S.

P.S. Here what I did:

-- Given the following famous Towns table from the SpatiaLite tutorial:
CREATE TABLE Towns (
  PK_UID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  Name TEXT,
  Peoples INTEGER,
  LocalCounc INTEGER,
  County INTEGER,
  Region INTEGER, "Geometry" POINT
)
SELECT * from towns;

-- Let's create a view... containing at least a PK (of type integer)
and a geometry
-- as well as a calculated column
CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS towns_test_v AS
  SELECT PK_UID, Name, Peoples + 1, Geometry from towns;

SELECT * FROM towns_test_v;

Built against Debian stock QT 4.6.2-4, GDAL 1.7.2 SVN r19558, GRASS 6.5 
SVN r42070, gdal-grass driver built from their sources.

GRASS built with -fexceptions. I make QGIS use GRASS 6.5 sources by 
linking src/plugins/grass/modules-6.4 as src/plugins/grass/modules-6.5.

Any ideas what would be the culprit of those crashes? Would it be 
usefull if I built QGIS with debugging on, or is it rather not a QGIS 
related issue?

Is someone aware of a feature or a plugin from QGIS that will do this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] same old bugs in the print composer
Message-ID: <4BDF3ABF.6070102@sieczka.org>

Hi,

I have set-up a composition as on the screendump attached, taken in the 
QGIS print composer window. However, any output type (pdf, png, svg) 
doesn't look the same as the view in the composer - pdf and png have 
fill patterns and point symbol scales different in the compsers legend, 
in the compsers map view and in the the map view of the main QGIS 
window. Svg output is mainly missing the legend and arrow.

These all look similar to old bugs that have been present in the print 
composer for years. Are these going to be fixed someday, or are they 
bugs in QT, elsewhere, and cannot be fixed?

Best,
Maciek

Message-ID: <4BE0F1F6.3030303@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think we should start preparing for the release of 1.5. There is a number of
blocking bugs:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes&order=priority
even though I suspect several of them are invalid. I invite everybody to check them,
eventually downgrading them, and to check if there are more tickets worth being upgraded.
IMHO, release should take place before summer, possibly in June.
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I reviewed the two must fix bugs I have in the queue, and neither of them have been addressed. I still feel that they are serious enough issues that they would require some action or being addressed prior to having a stable release. One of the bugs is likely (2483) a qt issue and may have to remain unresolved, but the other (2615) seems to have a coding solution as it has been implemented for old symbology. 

Thanks,
John

Hi Paolo

Yes I am in agreement that a release in late June would be good. I will start the release ball rolling in a week or so.

Hi all.
I think we should start preparing for the release of 1.5. There is a number of
blocking bugs:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes&order=priority
even though I suspect several of them are invalid. I invite everybody to check them,
eventually downgrading them, and to check if there are more tickets worth being upgraded.
IMHO, release should take place before summer, possibly in June.
Opinions?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS rasters
Message-ID: <4BE1249F.8050407@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Due to recent changes to the GRASS raster provider (no longer dependent on GDAL), a
number of options are broken (including many raster properties, the Value Tool
plugin, etc.). I think this should be fixed before releasing 1.5, as this represents
a serious regression over 1.4.
I also get many warnings of the type:

I would use QgsMapTool.toLayerCoordinates() method to find out the
clicked point's coordinates in the CRS of the layer. Then I would
transform it to WGS84 using QgsCoordinateTransform class.

The toLayerCoordinates() method first converts the point from canvas
widget coordinates to map (project) coordinates. Then, if the
on-the-fly projections are turned on, the map coordinates are further
transformed to layer coordinates. You don't have to work with project
CRS.

Message-ID: <s2ne8e7199c1005050448w7cd25feer506c66d3810858eb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I think we are still lacking a comprehensive resource for developers
using Python bindings to develop plugins and/or custom applications.
There are some resources in form of of blog posts and wiki pages, but
they are not well organized and sometimes outdated. Finally, existing
plugins contain a lot of useful (reusable) code, but going through a
plenty of source code of plugins is not a particularly good way to
learn QGIS API.

I've decided to start a PyQGIS cookbook that would introduce various
aspects of QGIS API in form of working code snippets. The cookbook
shouldn't replace the generated Doxygen documentation. Instead of
telling what a class can do, it should be task-oriented, i.e.
answering the questions "how do I?". Ideally, the cookbook should be
both a way how to learn QGIS API and a source of code for those
familiar with it, though not remembering the exact syntax/usage.

After reviewing possible documentation systems, sphinx [1] looked like
a suitable candidate (currently generator for Python documentation
[2]). It has plenty of features and supports various output formats.
It uses reStructured text syntax, which is quite similar to wiki
syntax.

As a start, I've combined Python_Bindings and
Developing_Python_Plugins wiki pages and added some new material, the
working draft is available here:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/html/

It is in early stages and covers only some parts of the API. If the
cookbook will get positive feedback, I'd like to move it to official
QGIS documentation page [3]. The source code for the cookbook could be
put into QGIS svn - either within the source tree or as a separate
branch in svn and the online docs could be regenerated daily as is the
case of Doxygen documentation.

I'd like to ask you for some feedback on the cookbook:
- do you like the idea?
- what parts of API should be documented - what is missing?
- do you know about any resources / useful code snippets that could be
integrated into the cookbook?

Any contributions to the cookbook would be highly welcome. I believe
after some time this could end up as a complete guide for all common
needs.

Thanks Martin, this is a great thing!
I fully agree with this effort, and I hope to contribute somehow, even
if I've started to develop with Qgis since a few weeks, and I'm mostly
directed to learn "how do I" in C++. Maybe the two languages could go
in parallel, similar to the docs for gdal/ogr api tutorials [1]. Ok,
one thing at a time :)

Anyway, +1!

 Cookbook idea is ace. Would be great if it was as easy for people to
edit as a wiki. Or maybe keep it all in SVN/hg and publish it
somewhere.

 Maybe cookbook recipes need tags, and versions, so qgis chefs can see
what they can use with a particular qgis version? And dates, and maybe
voting.. Or have I gone too far now?

 Something like the zope cookbook?

There are several bugs specific of QGIS 1.0.2:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2538
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2439
and are presumably no longer valid for 1.4.
Are we going to fix these? Or should we drop the support for 1.0 series?
Trying to keep the bug queue clean, not an easy task.

This is a great idea. I haven't started developing for QGIS because i don't
have the time to start learning the API. With such documentation, things
will go much much smoother.

Congratulations on the effort.

Hi Paolo,
I was playing with the source code few days ago. This plugin is
demonstrating quite interesting way to  request Google maps with
static API bundled with Google key in each request.  Also nice idea is
to store loaded map tiles as regular files on disk, so 1000 tiles per
day limit should not be so hot.
In other way, it is terribly hardcoded for Windows only usage and many
things can be done in better way. While playing with, I have changed
Windows only code to be usable on Linux, but I would vote for complete
rewrite.

So far, it is nice idea how to use Google maps.

Thanks Ivan for this review. I must say from an user point of view it seem to work
fairly well on Linux, but I did not inspect the code.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OpenGeo_RT plugin renamed in RT Sql Layer
Message-ID: <AANLkTinvy2vNpB9udw5EJ8SkFa2R5Monxx9qu068PSow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I renamed the OpenGeo_RT plugin. It's new name is RT Sql Layer.

It aims is to semplify the loading in canvas of a Postgres/PostGIS layer
by using a custom query. Click the QueryBuilder button in its toolbar.

You can also load in canvas an entire geometric table (without use a
query) by double click on the table name.

Cheers.

Paolo,
Do you really mean the GoogleLayers, not the OpenLayers plugin? GoogleLayers 
seem to not work with non-windows filesystem, while OpenLayers work well under 
Linux (thought don't refresh properly if render cache is enabled).

Just for information: A few minutes ago I renamed the plugin directory 
GoogleLayers-0311 to simple GoogleLayers to stop confusing the plugin 
installer. So if you did the same with your local copy and fixed it, be 
careful with reinstalling!

Before rewriting it, have a look at the OpenLayers Plugin from
our http://build.sourcepole.ch/qgis/plugins.xml repo (sources on github).
It still has refreshing issues, which require panning to fix it, but it's 
running on Windows and Linux. It uses the regular Google API (via OpenLayers) 
and does not store tiles on disk, because that's not allowed by the Google 
terms of use.

There are other two plugins that are broke or have hardcoded stuff
making them unsable and confusing for new users:

zoom to village

export to mysql

also in this case the authors gave no feedback to my mails.

Sincerely, I think we should focus primarily on Python - considering
that there are many more developers using Python than C++. I believe
the syntax can easily translated from Python to C++ and vice versa
with just very basic knowledge of the other language - so I'd like to
avoid writing the samples for both languages. The further advantage of
Python code samples is that Python is less verbose, so one can better
concentrate on the API. Additionally, in my opinion we should
concentrate on Python since the entry barrier is lower and the
distribution of plugins is much easier.

Of course, I don't mind including a chapter on C++ specifics.

yes, that's clear. Map canvas, map tools and canvas items are the
topics badly missing in the documentation. That's why I'm trying to
gather topics of much interest to determine the priorities...

Zoom to Village hangs my qgis, but Export to MySQL seems to work under ubuntu 
- what's wrong with this one?

I think using QGIS SVN for the management of the documentation source
files will be sufficient. I'd like to import the sources soon.

If some functionality is not available from QGIS 1.0, there should be
an appropriate warning with minimal required version.

Well... it should be more a guide than a list of standalone recipes.
For that, we could set up a site similar to djangosnippets.org - its
source code has BSD license - however I'm not sure if there would be
enough content for such a site.

 That'd be great - I'm itching to replace all the 'QgsCoordiante'

Has somebody else tested if it is working ? Both Linux and Win ?

According to this: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/
we do not need Maps API key anymore. So it can be removed, I will look at it.

Hi,

I'm testing on Linux (ubuntu, latest), it's running fine except that I
couldn't align the gmap layer with my ED50_UTM_32_N shapefile map.

On-the-fly projection is on and the shapefile layer has its CRS set.

any hint ?

Check if  Your project is correctly using Google 900913 CRS and Your data is also in correct projection.

Setting project projection to the custom projection created by the plugin
(which is in fact 900913) aligns perfectly.

What is still unclear to me is why it happens: shouldn't the layer's CRS be
sufficient to have a correct alignment ?

In other words, if I have 2 layers (shapefile=23032  and gmap=900913) with
CRS correctly set, the canvas should align independently from project's CRS,
am I wrong ?

Hi,
Some people have problems with grass plugin on Ubuntu: it gets compiled, but 
is unavailable in plugin manager. 

Now I see my grass plugin doesn't work too - it does load and shine, but not 
work at all. If I try to call any module, I get an error:

/usr/lib/grass64/bin/r.region: error while loading shared libraries: 
libgrass_vect.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 

Can anybody confirm? Trunk, Ubu 9.10, Grass 6.4rc5

You should always  use  900913 CRS for Your project and reproject all data in to this projection.

Exactly. Only vectors are reprojectable. Btw. Has anybody estimated 
performance of (potential) raster reprojection? Would it make any sense?

The module works well on Linux, but it fails on windows:

Cannot start module db.connect-login.pg.py

Perhaps a missing py library? Thanks for any suggestion.

Hi,

Then I zoom to Ukraine and press plugin button. After this I get an error

Hi Alexander, 
I can do the same without any problem.
This exception is case when there are wrong coordinate values for counting zoom level. For example, when You are very 
far from the map or in wrong coordinates.

1. Can You try different places and different zoom levels ?
2. Can You please replace line z = min(max(int(ceil(log(min(width / ((x2 - x1) * 256), height /((y2 - y1) * 256)), 2))), 
0), 19) with z= 10 and try again ?

It should be related to osgeo-setup rather than qgis, but on win it has
been reported that the GRASS module r.in.wms fails with:

So bc (The GNU bc arbitrary precision calculator language) should be added

Subject: [Qgis-developer] request for review: Add possibility to ignore
	geotransform/gcps in QgsRasterLayer
Message-ID: <201005071430.00345.m.massing@warped-space.de>

Hello,

I am currently fixing a problem with the georeferencer, which does
not handle files with existing georeferencing information correctly
(see #2465 - https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2465).

To this end, I'd like to add functionality which allows one to override the
gdal geotransform in QgsRasterLayer, but as this touches on a core class I'd
appreciate if someone could have a look and sign off or comment on the 
proposed patch.

Essentially, the patch adds a constructor and flags which allow one to
ignore ground control point and geotransform information when constructing the
QgsRasterLayer. 

Okay to commit? I'll add an appropriate unit test if accepted.

thanks & best regards,

  Manuel

Hello
I am trying to test this plugin out on Ubuntu Lucid. I have installed
it from the plugin manager. However I haven't got any Google Mercator
entry in the CRS menu. I've tried to search for EPSG 900913 and also
by name and it doens't show up. In case it is relevant I am using Qgis
1.4 from the ubuntugis-unstable PPA.

Hi,
You can add following lines  to '/usr/share/proj/epsg' to add Google projection (be carefull, projection definition must 
be at one line):

# Google projection
<900913> +proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null 
+no_defs <>

Howdy Manuel.

At first read through I am not sure this is the right approach. If I am 
imagining the problem correctly, you basically need to convert from map 
coordinates back to pixel coordinates. I think it would be better to add 
that functionality rather than forcing the layer to ignore it's 
geotransform.

If you can point me to the lines in the georeferencer code, I can try to 
take a look and see if there is an alternative option for modifying 
qgsrasterlayer.

The problem is that a lot of code in the georeferencer expects coordinates to
be expressed in pixel coordinates. This includes GCP point rendering (as
canvas items), coordinate picking (e.g., when adding a GCP), visualisation of 
residuals, and also the geotransform classes. Adding transforms in all these 
cases would IMO add an undue amount of complexity to what essentially is a 
corner case for georeferencing.

So, I do agree that its not really pleasing (more in an aesthetic sense :-)) 
to support such a limited use-case in a core class - that being said, it 
doesn't really add complexity to the QgsRasterLayer logic, so I thought it was
a good compromise.

Hmm, from the top of my head I'd think this would affect different parts of
the code, for example the addition of canvas items 
(qgsgeorefdatapoint.cpp:33),  adding points QgsGeorefPluginGui::addPoint
(qgsgeorefplugingui.cpp:434), etc. would need to be adapted to support
different coordinate frames, as would the qgsgeotransforms, GCP list loading /
saving etc., but I admit I haven't really looked into solving it from this
angle so maybe there is a simpler solution.

As a way to reproduce some of the problems: open an unreferenced raster,
add GCPs, then create a world file. If the (now georeferenced) raster
is reopened, raster and GCPs etc. are expressed in different coordinate 
frames.

thanks for your input,

  Manuel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Quantum GIS from the standard python shell -
	unable to load layer
Message-ID: <1273247265994-5019950.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi,

I'm trying to launch QGIS from the standard python shell.
But I'm unable to load a test layer which is very simple, as consisting in
only 2 polygons..

Here is what I write in the standard python shell
>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS Enceladus")
>>> QgsApplication.initQgis()
>>> vlayer=QgsVectorLayer("C:/testpol.shp","macouche","ogr")
Failed to load

But if i write the same lines of code in QGIS python console:
>>> vlayer=QgsVectorLayer("C:/testpol.shp","macouche","ogr")
>>>print vlayer.isValid()
True

it works...

Anything dealing with the prefix path?
Any idea?

Thanks in advance!

Hi all,

In testing on OS X using trunk, things seem to mostly work. 

The google mercator CRS I had was not working at first, but manually creating one with the parameters supplied below by Ivan did work.

My problem is that the google layer never refreshes once it is loaded. I assume this is not the correct behavior, but maybe I am incorrect. Can anyone comment on this?

Regards,
John

Each Google tile is loaded loaded as separate layer, so You need to
press button and load new layer again and again if You want another
tile. So You can finish with 100 layers loaded at the end. This plugin
is using Google maps static API, which was not build for flawless map
browsing (which is blocked from non-browsers by Google). Whole plugin
principle is nice hack.

Trying to switch off some more layers caused QGIS crasch (qtcore4.dll)

Seems the osm plugin doesn't unload completely. Restart qgis and all the 
plugins will be gone.

Thanks, Borys. No idea though is it something to be fixed or just a
coincidence. Strange thing was, I got that error only when touching
.tab layers not .shp.

Dear Horst,
I would like to kindly ask You to remove 'Qt.WindowCloseButtonHint'
from PostgisQuery.py which is not available in Qt 4.4.x.

Thanks a lot.

Hi,

I've try GoogleLayers plugin on another Windows box and all works fine.
Maybe my problem is system specific.

Hi, there is an error when launching plugin.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ivo/.qgis/python/plugins/postgisquery/PostgisQuery.py",
line 79, in run
    self.dlg = PostgisQueryDialog(self.iface.mainWindow(), self.flags)

You can send me 'PostgisQuery.py' for test before publishing. Sorry
for inconvenience.

Ok, this is my correction.
I suggest "if qVersion() >= '4.5':" because there is a problem also
with 4.4, not with 4.3.
Whole file is attached. Thanks a lot.

Hi,

In order to get qgis svn to compile on my machine, I needed the 
following patch:


Index: src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp
===================================================================
--- src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp    (revision 13455)
+++ src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp    (working copy)

    QSettings settings;
    restoreGeometry( settings.value( "/Composer/geometry" ).toByteArray() );
    QVariant splitterState = settings.value( "/Composer/splitterState" );
-  if ( splitterState != QVariant::QVariant() )
+  if ( splitterState != QVariant() )
    {
      
//mSplitter->restoreState(settings.value("/Composer/splitterState").toByteArray());
    }


Possibly due to gcc 4.5.0 here? Anyways, it compiles fine with the patch 
applied.

Regards,
Vincent Schut.

You should add second parameter set to True, i.e.:
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS Enceladus", True)

Using this, all other paths used within QGIS will be set according to
the prefix.

Hi,
can somebody write simple howto, how to import and build QGIS source in QTCreator ?
I am not C++ programmer, but it can be usefull for some advanced patch testing or for new developers.

I saw  Martin's .pro script in some post, but I need more info.

just simply open the root CMakeLists.txt file in Qt Creator. It will
recognize it as a project, ask for the build directory and run the
configuration. After a successful build you also have to install it -
qgis will not run from the source directory.

No .pro files are needed. Qt Creator has support for CMake.from version 1.1.

I have used QtCreator with QGIS for a while now. QtCreator can use cmake 
and you can create a new project by just opening the cmakefile.txt file.

 From the newer QtCreateor 2.0.x docs ( I have not tried 2.0 yet, still 
on 1.3 ):

Message-ID: <1273588469921-5036265.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hello,

I'd like to make a plugin that displays metadata of the current layer from a
web page..

For the development, I used a test plugin and modified the run function to
incorporate my code into it

I've got problems with the web windows: it automatically closes..

Here is the code:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import sys
import sqlite3
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtWebKit import *
from qgis.core import *

from ui_control import ui_Control
import resources_rc

class TestPlugin:

  def __init__(self, iface):
    self.iface = iface

  def initGui(self):
    # create action that will start plugin configuration
    self.action = QAction(QIcon(":/icon.png"), "Test plugin",
self.iface.mainWindow())
    self.action.setWhatsThis("Configuration for test plugin")
    self.action.setStatusTip("This is status tip")

    # connect the action to the run method
    QObject.connect(self.action, SIGNAL("activated()"), self.run)

    # add toolbar button and menu item
    self.iface.addToolBarIcon(self.action)
    self.iface.addPluginToMenu("&Test Plugin", self.action)

  def unload(self):
    # remove the plugin menu item and icon
    self.iface.removePluginMenu("&Test Plugin",self.action)
    self.iface.removeToolBarIcon(self.action)

  def run(self):
	#code to get the layer_id
    view=QWebView()
    url="http://info_layer.php?layer="+layer_id
    view.load(QUrl(url))
    view.show()

Any help would be appreciated

For the people encountering the same problem under windows, you must set the
path that way:
C:\\Program Files\\Quantum GIS Enceladus
and not that way
C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS Enceladus

The problem is that the "view" object is valid only within the context
of run() method - it gets destroyed automatically when the method is
finished. You can set the "view" object to be an attribute of the
class, i.e. self.view = QWebView(). This will destroy the view when
the plugin instance is deleted. Other possibility is to set parent of
the QWebView instance - the ownership will be transferred to the
parent and it will be deleted when the parent is deleted - see QObject
reference.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] RasterCalc Extent Mismatch
Message-ID: <4BE9A27B.2070009@wildintellect.com>

I've found a bug which I think might be easy to solve.
If you load several rasters, all of the same extent, but some of which
have different resolutions when a calculation is performed it will use
the pixel extent from the rasters in question but uses the resolution of
the largest raster(smallest cells) for the output.

So basically I load 3 rasters
a 100x100
b 100x100
c 2000x2000
All 3 have the same extent in the real world

if I do a-b = d
then d comes out as a tiny corner of the total image, it appears to be
the correct number of cells but the cell size is pulled from the
2000x2000 image c, instead of the images that the calculation was based on.

I can provide a sample dataset and screenshot if necessary.

Workaround, use a fresh qgis project with only the correct rasters
loaded for the calculation. Then it comes out correct.

Thanks,
Alex

This is wonderful, I was just struggling with how to teach people the
QGIS api for python. So FYI don't take the site down or move it for the
time being, I'm planning to use it in a class I'm teaching starting this
week until mid June.

I'll happily pass back feedback and contributions.

The plugin uses classes which have been added for 1.5 release. This
should be fixed within the plugin to use try/except block to handle
the import error. However, the plugin installer shouldn't allow the
plugin to be installed for qgis 1.4.

Got it: the user has a double installation (1.4 + 1.5), so (s)he installed the new
installer plugin in 1.5 and this gives the error for 1.4.
All clear, thanks.

hello Martin

Thanks a lot for your answer!

For those whore interested, here is run() function code.

The plugin gets the layer name and uses it to display metadata information
about it from an internal web window.

  def run(self):
    #code to get the layer_id
    sourceL=self.iface.activeLayer().source().split("/")
    table=sourceL[sourceL.count()-1].split(".")[0]
##  QMessageBox.information(None,"couche",str(table))

    #SQL
    fichier="C:/georep2B.sqlite"
    conn=sqlite3.connect(fichier)
    c=conn.cursor()
    c.execute("select id from georep where nomCouche='"+str(table)+"'")
    id=c.fetchone()[0]
    
    self.view=QWebView()
    url="http://info_layer.php?layer="="+str(id)
    self.view.load(QUrl(url))
    self.view.show()

Message-ID: <1253540616.20100512135819@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

I have a question about new symbology and Categorized renderer. There
several differences with old symbology which are missing. Will
it make sense to:

1. Add "add class"
2. Allow to keep set up styles for individual classes (if they were
changed) after hitting Classify again.

Is it something that was missed occasionally or it is not in the code?
Both features are present in old symbology. Or may be I'm missing
something?

I noticed on the buffer function, when doing a relatively large buffer,
that there's no visual feedback to the user that it's working.
The Percent bar never moves, no buttons are grayed out, etc. This seems
to confused people as to whether the tool is actually running.

Just thought I'd note that. If I get a chance later I'll see if I can
come up with a patch to make it more intuitive to the user.

Thanks for the good work,

Hi Alex,

there is a ticket with patch for making OK button grayed out after
starting operation https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2057

Problem with low speed on large datasets exists almost with all tools.

Those features are missing only due to the usual lack of time. Patches
are highly welcome.

Hi Manuel.

There are already several methods for transforming map to device 
coordinates (e.g., QgsMapToPixel) so working with the canvas is already 
taken care of. Only a similar function would be needed in the raster class.

It seems that there was an original design flaw in the georeferencer ( 
maybe that was because there was missing functionality in the raster 
class ) if it is only expecting pixel coordinates. I can also imaging 
that it could take a considerable amount of work to update the 
georeferencer to use the coordinate transforms, but that can not be a 
reason to add a potentially ugly shortcut. But this is just my opinion 
:) and I don't want to slow progress! As I have mostly absent from 
development in the last couple of years I would be good for a couple of 
other devs to provide their opinion.

take care!

Hello,

I'm using Pyqgis.

I'm trying to change the image for a vector layer. The default image is a
circle, I wish to change that for a triangle for some of the features, and
keep the circle for some other. I'm using a UniqueValueRender. The layer has
8 types of features, the first 3 should be rendered as triangles in the map,
and the remaining 5 as circle. So far I've creted the QgsSymbols, but I dont
see how to modifie the renderer to achieve this. Any help is welcome.

Hi all.
I'm having trouble with the SDA4PP plugin. Upon installation, it requires
several additonal packages and crashes [0].
I install the needed packages, but it fails to load rJava, and it gets
deactivated [1].
I think the dependency on rJava is very heavy, and should be avoided if at
all possible.
Thanks for any help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using RendererV2 crashes (Py)Qgis
Message-ID: <AANLkTilQjJQqrciq6mFtXmi9s75hXS5taSGZP8PCiAc6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I'm using a QgsRenderV2 in order to change the default circles marker to
triangles. I follow the example in the wiki
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Symbology-NG but when I try to assing a QgsRenderV2
to a layer, or to setUsingRenderV2 to True, the applications crashes. What I
do is:

- create a vector layer from a spatialite table
- create a renderV2 ( Random Render from the wiki)
- use myLayer.setRendererV2(miRender)

thats all. It crashes.

It is a python standalone application. The crash happens when I try to use
the zoom, or any other maptool. I'm using QGis enceladus, in windows XP. Is
there a solution for this? Is this a known bug? or am I doing something
wrong?



Marcelo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding "Save changes" button to layer editor
Message-ID: <AANLkTikNfWKeqncQ4AAIichTGnrDs653QvJ9ytQ87fx-@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I wanted to create plugin with similar functionality like it is
described in this ticket:  https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2579  .
I agree, that it would be nice to have such tool (or maybe only
keyboard shortcut to save changes) directly in QGIS.
My question is, has somebody plans to implement this ticket, or should
I write plugin by myself if I want this?

Hi Paolo,

just did a svn up and rebuild current trunk qgis on ubuntu lucid.
reinstalled ImageMapPlugin 0.4.2 from repository

I cannot confirm your problems. All seems fine with me.
Is it possible that the plugin is not generating anything for you, and 
you are loading an old image?

What version(s) are you using?
Special projections/data? (since 0.4.2 the plugin should handle 'on the 
fly'-reprojection, maybe there are gliches there ...?)
if possible, can you sent me the qgs file and example data?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Paolo,
on Debian Lenny plugin is crashin on start. I need to change line in
'ui_imagemapplugingui.py'
        self.progressBar.setProperty("value", 0)
to
        self.progressBar.setProperty("value",QtCore.QVariant(0))
Maybe it is Qt version compatibility issue.


Then it loads, but no attributes are generated to HTML.

I need to switch my project to 'on-the-fly' reprojection to WGS84 and
then all attributes are generated. This was the problem. Is it a
problem to enable plugin for all projections ?

Hi Ivan,

I'm the author of the imagemapplugin.

thanks for the progressbar bug, I will just put your fix into the code, 
strange it only pops up on debian?

for the problem below, can you sent me the qgs-file (and some example 
data?) you are using at that moment, OR write me exactly what you did?
because the on the fly stuff is just added in the last version and 
apparently it's not ok yet?

Regards

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, just tested. It looks fine. Nice improvements. I have installed it
manually, since it is not currently available from You repo.

This error is coming out when selected lines can not create single
LINESTRING. (they are not snapped together on line ends or they are
not snapped at all ).

in the Faunalia repository there are 2 versions of GdalTools:

v.1.1.9, the stable one
v.1.1.15, the experimental one (this contains the improvements)

So you have to enable experimental plugins in the plugins installer
to update the installed version.

Greets.

Yes, sorry, I have forgot to do it.
Maybe I have one suggestion, to include minimal Gdal version in
'About' dialog. There is a problem on older Gdal installations
(usually on Debian Stable :)), that some of the command line utilities
are missing (like gdalbuildvrt), some formats are not supported ... .
Maybe I would include minimal version information also to error
message which is comming out when command does not exists.

Thanks for Your work.

I'm not sure I understood.

GdalTools is not the only tool which uses GDAL libs. So I think it could
be a more general problem.
In this case it's QGis app that have to resolve this issue.

Right. I wrongly assumed general snapping configuration would be honnoured.

Yes, things will get even more complicated when gdal 1.7 will become
widespread, and more tools available only in 1.7 will be available.
Ivan, would you mind filling a ticket on GdalTools bugtracker?
All the best.

under ubuntu linux I'm not getting your problems/crashes after having
installed the necessary R packages. Did you get the errors/crashes using
a particular tool?

Under windows it seems that for now the plugin works only the standalone
version of qgis.

Should still work, rpy2 is how the plugin interacts with R, and as
long as rpy2 is installed via osgeo4w it should work. It's possible
that you'll have to add the path to you R installation to your path
environment variable, but this should be the same if you've installed
rpy2 for use with the standalone qgis as well.

Plugins that use the rpy2/rpy python library (of which I believe
SDA4PP is one) should still work under the osgeo4w version of qgis as
long as you've installed rpy2/rpy using the osgeo4w installer.

yes, you are right. I am working on it and will change and separate the
sequences of loading R packages at the start up of qgis.

while loading iplots package (one of dependencies is rJava) or loading all
of them at the start up, makes qgis to open a bit slow.

Optional R packages for tools; Kriging (automap package), Rggobi  (rggobi
package) and Linked Statistical Display (iplots package) will not be loaded
at the start up of QGIS in order to run more faster.
As Paolo mentioned, those packages have a very high load. These three tools'
packages will be loaded at the execution of the tool.

But other packages like rgdal, maptools and spatstat should be loaded at the
startup of the qgis, because these are the required ones.

I hope, tomorrow, I will finish this change and publsh.

regards,
Volkan Kepoglu.

SDA4PP uses only rpy2. I never tried under osgeo4w. But theoretically, as
Carson said, the plugin should also run under osgeo4w, if required R
packages are installed and the path of R is defined correctly.
if it is tried, is there any error?

I tried but it doesn't seems to work. It always says that rgdal is
missing, but R/rpy2/rgdal/etc. are correctly installed as the Home Range
plugin (that uses R/rpy2/rgdal/etc.) is working fine.

Hi Marin,

we've worked on that and here is the result (coded by Lynx, tested by
alexbruy and old_bibigon):
http://pastebin.com/HWKjQ4Tp

This patch:
1. Adds behavior to keep set up symbologies when hiting reclass
2. Adds 'add class' button
3. Changes the layout a little bit to allow 3, instead of 2 columns
for classes. This is needed, because there was no way before, that you
could change class value (symbol window was popping up).

Please let me know if there are any issues with the patch and accept
a compliment from our programmer who said that new symbology is a
piece of coding art.

Hi,

you can use either "old" symbology or "new" symbology (from 1.4). I
would recommend the latter as it is better extensible, though you may
choose the original symbology for compatibility with older versions.

An introduction to the new symbology approach can be found here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Symbology-NG

For old symbology unfortunately there is no such guide (yet). But you
were on the right track: first you need to construct QgsSymbol
instances, then add them to a renderer class using addSymbol method,
finally apply the renderer to your vector layer (setRenderer).

Regards
Martin

Please try again with development version of QGIS. If I recall
correctly, there were few problems - they're fixed in development
version (will be 1.5).

Some interesting changes are being made to the legend in print composer (eg
drag and drop), but a couple of bugs have appeared which may not have been
noticed:

1.       If the layer name is blanked out, that layer disappears from the
displayed legend (I often do this with single symbol layers)

2.       Selecting a layer and pressing 'Update' has no effect.

What would you think abut adding support for keyword substitution
in pgsql data provider ? Such a thing could be used to invoke
SQL functions that behave differently based on client state.

I'm thinking, for example, using map resolution for line simplification.

Hi,

I was wondering if it is possible to reverse https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/13499 ?

The reasoning behind the estimated metadata option is it only gets the table row count from the table statistics, regardless of any filters.

Thanks

But that's wrong, when there is a where clause.

We could fetch the feature count only if we actually need it.  But that would
require to change the API and drop the const from
QgsVectorDataProvider::featureCount().

Any objections?

Or you use 'mutable' members for special cases. Lazy fetching is one of the 
few cases where mutable makes sense (even though I agree that it should be 
used with cautiousness).

Ah, sure.  Much nicer than going through all the providers.   Done in r13524.

SDA4PP is revised to 0.181 and both problem is solved;

loading R packages at the start up is changed. should be, now, more faster.
tested under osgeow and the plugin is working.

Be sure that environmental variables should be set.
I am tested with R 2.10.1, so that, set two variables;

add path variable: C:\Program Files\R\R-2.10.1\bin
and set R_HOME = C:\Program Files\R\R-2.10.1 in the windows.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help Needed in retrieving file path from the layer
	name
Message-ID: <AANLkTikbbCBnSvdyUAMjINWTUi-GBHe0UTmVBXYr7vNC@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Is there any way to get the entire file path from the layer name?
For example:

A user selects a layer inside a combobox, which in turn accesses the map
layer registry.
Now I want to know the full path of the layer selected.
If the layer name through combobox is "xyz"
Then I want to get "c:/aa/bb/xyz.shp" or the exact location of the layer, in
the harddisk.

Any help regarding this will be highly helpful and appreciated.

With Warm Regards,
Sonai

If you can get the map layer from the layer registry, then should be
able to use layer.source() (or layer.publicSource() to hide passwords)
to get the layer path information.

Bishwarup Banerjee,

You can use the method QgsLayer.source()

I use this methods in the Spatial Query plugin:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/src/plugins/spatialquery/qgsspatialquerydialog.cpp
line 382 for populate ToolTipRole item in combobox

Hi

Yes .. It is wrong!  But the point of the estimated metadata isn't to get it right.  The point is that with very large tables, getting it right takes much too long - taking minutes to open layers (even if its only the first time with a lazy implementation) is very painful!

If the user wants it to be right (or at least, more nearly right), they don't have to use this option.  Even then it can still be wrong if another user is accessing and modifying the database.

Keeping the original implementation of the estimated metadata option gives the user the choice.

Cheers
Chris

But that's wrong, when there is a where clause.

But only if you set a where clause.  In which case the feature count is likely
to be much different from the full feature count.

Or do you have tables with mixed geometry types, that are always accessed with
a where clause to get a unique geometry type?

I now also changed filling the metadata page in vector properties only if the
user wants to see it.

Another place where the feature count is used is to show progress in
symbology-ng, although that doesn't seem to make much sense, unless you are at
full layer extent.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQgis crashes when using QgsComposition for
	printing
Message-ID: <AANLkTilcvegS8w2KwrIxhLebWZUVv5LOYzEJfIjT-Oui@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm developping a PyQgis Stand Alone App using Windows XP and Qgis
Enceladus. I was trying to add a function that prints the map to a pdf file.
I found this code:



# set up composition
mapRenderer = iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)

dpi = c.printResolution()
dpmm = dpi / 25.4
width = int(dpmm * c.paperWidth())
height = int(dpmm * c.paperHeight())

# add a map to the composition
x, y = 0, 0
w, h = c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()
composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, x,y,w,h)
c.addItem(composerMap)

# create output image and initialize it
image = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
image.setDotsPerMeterX(dpmm * 1000)
image.setDotsPerMeterY(dpmm * 1000)
image.fill(0)

# render the composition
imagePainter = QPainter(image)
sourceArea = QRectF(0, 0, c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight())
targetArea = QRectF(0, 0, width, height)
c.render(imagePainter, targetArea, sourceArea)
imagePainter.end()

image.save("out.png", "png")
It doesn't quite work, the file out.png gets created but the application
crashes a few seconds later. I'm using the code as it is with one
modification, instead of :

mapRenderer = iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
I use:

mapRenderer =  self.canvas.mapRenderer()

The line that causes the crash is: c.addItem(composerMap)
I tried to look for addItem in the QgsComposition functions list (in Qgis
API) but could not find it.

As always I'll be grateful for any advice.

Thanks,

Marcelo Reyes

I guess the point is that, as you rightly note, the feature count isn't very important, so having it wrong really doesn't matter.  On the other hand having a responsive interface is important.  

Optimisations like only filling in the metadata when it is required are great - they add value whether you are using estimated metadata or not.  

Where you do need to use the full metadata and properly interrogate the database (such as your example with mixed geometries), then the you can just turn this option off.

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fTools: selection problems
Message-ID: <4585d0b0ff30a006a0fb257e93806af1@localhost>


Hi all.
Using current trunk, the fTools selection tools have problems:
- selecting a number of features does not work (% is ok)
- stratified selection throws an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doSubsetSelect.py", line
79, in accept
self.compute(inVect, uidField, value, perc, self.progressBar)
File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doSubsetSelect.py", line
107, in compute
if atMap[index] == QVariant(i):
KeyError: 9

Versione Python:
2.6.5 (r265:79063, Mar 18 2010, 23:59:47) 
[GCC 4.4.3]

All the best.

Also random point generation fails:

value = sAtMap[index].toInt()[0]
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'index' referenced before assignment

Strangely enough, this does not happen with some PC, for unknown reasons.

Here (qgis trunk, ubuntu 9.04)the tool does not returns any error, but
it takes like 5 minutes to plot 10 random points.

Seems to be somehow related to the vector I'm using as input boundary.
Maybe is a problem with this vector, I'll check further.

Hi,

I did?  Sorry, I didn't mean to.

What I can agree with, is that we often don't need a feature count and also
that the feature count often doesn't need to be accurate.

But I don't see any point in having a significantly wrong feature count, eg.
having the attribute table report that it found roughly all rows after a query,
although it actually shows only say five.

But I was asking if you have a where clause.  Do you?

If you don't, I wonder how the change affects you and if you do, I wonder why
you insist on getting a wrong feature count - as would expect most where
clauses to limit the number of returned rows significantly.

And mentioning the mixed geometry case, was only to rule out the possiblity
that might have a where clause without knowingly having set one.

Hi Volkan,

very nice the idea to add the R package installer in the plugin.


I'm noticing the following:

*) the R package installer does not seems to "see" that the necessary
packages were already installed (using the R console).

*) after installing the packages, with the R package installer, it keeps
saying that iplots and rggobi are not installed (under Seven) or that
rgdal and rggobi are not installed (under xp).  Trying install again the
"missing" packages (even after removing the package folders in the R
library folder) does not seems to help.


cheers

Hi all,

I'm using the ManageR plugin 1.0 vers on Windows platform.

When I try to import an attribute table of a layer loaded in the canvas I
have this error message and no data are loaded on the R WorkShop.

Anyone have the same problem?

Thank you very much

Wouldn't it be good to integrate manageR and SDA4PP?

I cleaned the system, reinstalled R and QGIS and now it seems to work
all fine. So it was a problem not related to the plugin.


Sorry for the noise.

I think the goals of the two peices of software are quite different.
manageR is (in the longer term) designed to be an R leaning tool for
GIS users, so the goal is really to have the user know they are using
R, whereas SDA4PP is essentially trying to remove the user from R,
letting it do the work in the background (correct me if I'm wrong here
Volkan). To avoid hijacking this thread, I'll post some more
information in a separate email in a moment...

Regards,

Carson

Message-ID: <AANLkTilp3sdtz9rggUdsBgvp2M2-KMnkb3eUIpZ3EOFt@mail.gmail.com>

This is a bit of a continuation from the thread entitled:
[Qgis-developer] problems with SDA4PP plugin:

A bit of info on the direction I'm taking manageR:
manageR is (in the longer term) designed to be an R leaning tool for
GIS users, so the goal is really to have the user know they are using
R upfront. Having said that, manageR does support (it's a bit clunky
at the moment, but I'm getting there) plugins, so that if someone
wants, they can create GUIs for R functions similar to those available
via SDA4PP, but which still keeps the focus on 'seeing how R does it'.
I'm going to be using managR to teach R to non-stats folks by allowing
them to perform some common analyses with the GUI features, and then
providing the means to export the actual R code to scripts which they
can then use to automate tasks and learn how to use R effectively in
their own research. Eventually I'll have GUIs for R functions for
remote sensing, point pattern analysis, modeling, etc. Some GUIs are
already available, and I'm slowly adding more and more each day
(starting with spdep). In fact, if anyone in the QGIS community has
some R functions that they regularly use that might be helpful to
others, please don't hesitate to send them along, and I'll add them to
the analysis menu of manageR. On that note, I'd also welcome input
from users of manageR, as I've just released a new version with quite
a few changes, and I'd like to hear how it is working on the various
OS etc.
Some new features include:
1) A package manager nearly identical to the one available in the OSX R GUI
2) Additional GUIs for some common R analysis functions (mostly
spatial analysis)
3) A new workspace manager, very similar to the one available in the OSX R GUI
4) The option to use the R raster package for importing raster layers
5) Updated syntax highlighting and auto-completion features (command
and bracket auto-complete)
6) Many bug fixes, and several speed-ups.
7) A few additional features to aid in script writing and export (as
well as some improvement to editR, the R script editor which is part
of manageR).
8) manageR can also now be run as a standalone application (though at
the moment it still requires some of the files in the manageR plugin
folder, so it has to be run from the folder with something like : $
python manageR.py).

Thanks,

Carson

Hi Carson,

This all sounds like excellent progress. After updating to rpy2.1.x, your latest version appears to be working for me on OS X and qgis trunk. I have not put it through the paces, but so far so good.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding encoding file
Message-ID: <732025749.20100519104152@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

What do you think about adding capability to read optional cpg (code-page) file
to automatically determine encoding? Sort of like a prj file, but for
encodings. ESRI software uses *.cpg file for this purpose and we
could've make use of that too.

Switching back and forth from one encoding to another can be tiring
and this happens a lot with Cyrillics, well at least in my case :)

And yes, we can work on adding that if devs give green light.

1+ for me.
I generally don't switch beetwen encodings, but I think it's a good
improvement.

+1 from me too.

Many programs (espessially old) don't support unicode so data are
stored in other encoding and setting up encoding manually when
open dataset is a bit tiring.

What timing - I was just wrestling with this yesterday - going *to* Arc.

One problem that I discovered is that if the encoding is set in the DBF header (the LDID value), and which GDAL automatically does when creating shapefiles, Arc ignores the cpg file.  And I think that GDAL uses the wrong value (if it's intended to be UTF-8), since they didn't work in Arc.  I couldn't get a unicode shapefile to work in Arc until I zero'd the DBF LDID and added the cpg file.

Everyday! Continuously switching between utf and cp125x, sometimes also 
iso8859-x and old ibm85x ;-)

Looks like shapelib supports codepages in CPG and LDID both for reading
(DBFGetCodePage()) and creating (DBFCreateEx()) DBFs.

Meaning that we just need to tweak Open vector dialog somehow?

Right now, CPGs are not being read as I understand.

I'd suggest for starters that if CPG is present:

1. Open vector dialog automatically set the selector to this Encoding
(and may be block from changing adding something like: "UTF8: read from CPG"
2. 'qgis layername.shp' automatically loads it in correct encoding,
not the last one, like now.

No, we don't use shapelib directly and OGR doesn't seem to use or expose that
functionality.  But it might be a starting point and perhaps this should be
better added to OGR.

J?rgen, what would be your suggestion? Wait till this functionality
exposed in OGR and then deal with in QGIS? Or don't wait and add CPG
recognition ourselves?

I am completely agree on Carson. Also sda4pp focuses on only point patterns.
manageR is more generic console based tool that integrates R with python in
qgis. It is better to keep as separate.

Folks,

This would be a good time to improve encoding handling in OGR.

Hi J?rgen

Interesting point about top posting .. .  It's just the way MS Outlook sets up the reply, and I just go along with it. I'd never really thought about it before .. And here I go doing it again.

The answer to the "where" clause is, yes, sometimes.  And sometimes not!  Basically we have large datasets (national cadastral dataset, 3.5 million polygons for parcels, 19 million vectors for boundary dimensions etc, approximate counts!).  We use Qgis for investigative visualisation as well as in production processes using plugins etc.  In both instances we may be using where clauses to access subsets of the data (for example to exclude road/railway parcels from the view).  

We are generally using scale based rendering, so that we never view these layers over the whole country at once. In effect the main "where" clause is always the bounding box of the current view, generally a very small part of the full dataset.  We aren't really interested in how many features there are over the whole country.  And we don't want to wait for postgres to count them before we get to see the bit we are actually interested in.

Postgres/Qgis manages this scenario brilliantly provided that the postgres provider isn't trying to calculate statistics or other information over the whole dataset (or the whole dataset restricted by a non-spatial where clause).  

So that is the premise on which the estimated metadata option is based.  If you call it a "no non-spatial query" option may that would make more sense?

I hope that makes it clearer what why we are very keen on reversing or modifying the change!

Cheers
Chris

Ok, so are you trying to prove all my points against top posting or are you intentionally avoiding to tell me whether or not you are using a where clause?

Just to drop some pointers here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc23_ogr_unicode

The there mentioned "non-ascii filenames" are also an issue in QGIS, especially
on Windows where the standard library functions don't speak UTF-8 and a whole
different set of wide strings functions is to be used.   Apparently GDAL
already has some support for that, but only on WinCE.

Hi J?rgen,

Yes we do use symbology-ng. Specifically we use the vectorfieldrender python plug-in and some of the advanced rendering features in symbology-ng. We are not currently using the graduated symbol renderer.

Yes you are correct; we avoid ftools for large datasets. If we need to do queries and analysis of the data we do that at the PostGIS level, and then view those results in QGIS.

We do try to avoid the use of the attribute table, but some of our users still try to load it every now and again. When they do this it puts extra load on the server and of course QGIS become unresponsive for a large period of time. In our build of QGIS I have put a warning message before the attribute table is loaded if the feature count (estimated!) is larger than a defined option. Not the best solution, but it works. If we could only display features in the current canvas view that would be excellent. Is it hard to put this feature back in?

As Chris stated the whole reason why we implemented the estimated statistics option was to allow fast loading of layers into the interface with very large datasets. The caveat when using this option is the extents, geometry types and features counts could be wrong. But the user knows this when choosing the option and can choose to turn it off. If they want more correct information, then they don't have use the option.

Our users do look at the vector layer metadata in the properties dialog to view the URI and provider type. So if the feature count is still going to happen automatically at this point then it will be a big inconvenience. Maybe a solution to this to change the QgsVectorDataProvider interface to have a new method "bool hasEstimatedFeatureCount()" that returns false by default. In the postgres provider this method could be set to true when an estimated feature count is done. Then in the vector properties dialog it could display that the feature count is estimated, and give the option to click a button to do a "correct" count. Or something like that...

I've also noticed that feature count is fetched for progress reporting during layer rendering. This in my opinion is invalid as it's the number of features within the current dataprovider select filter that is more relevant. Maybe this code should just be removed. 

Cheers,
Jeremy

Well, I'm still interested in figuring out, where we still retrieve feature counts, that we actually don't need - which would be where the change hits you.

As said symbology-ng is a candidate, are you using it?

I imagine ftools is pretty unusable for you kind of dataset, give or take feature count.

You probably don't use the attribute table in those datasets either.  Am I right?

BTW there once was an option to have the attribute show only the features in the current canvas, which I imagine would still be a nice thing for your setup, would it?

Hi Carson.
First test of the new manageR, a few annoyances:
- characters become blank when selected via the mouse
- when deleting a graphic device with the graphic device manager, I get:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/manageR/manageR.py", line 2110, in

File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/manageR/manageR.py", line 2056, in
appendText
self.append(out_text)
RuntimeError: underlying C/C++ object has been deleted
The error remains even after quitting manageR; one has to restart QGIS.
- importing a 3.4Mb shp layer form the canvas takes a long time, and the
whole machine becomes unresponsive.
More testing to come as time will allow.
Thanks for your work.
All the best.

Although personally - except for WMS - I don't use much raster.  Looking at the

Did you have a selection on the layer? I have a few ways of speeding
things up (using rgdal directly), but if a layer has a selection, this
might be difficult. I'll try to post a revised version in the next few
days. Thanks for testing!

Oh, seems I missed this post. For me GdalTools and RasterCalc are two main

Well it actually is easy with easy_install. The biggest problem with
python debs is that they get out of date really fast. Personally I've
been raising the discussion with QGIS that we should look to moving
plugins to python eggs so we can introduce dependency tracking via
easy_install.

But yes a deb of pyspatialite would probably be useful at some point.

Hi,

I'm not sure if this has been reported, but running the photos2shape plugin when using a CRS other than wgs84 causes a crash, at least with reprojection enabled for the project.

QMessageBox::critical( 0, tr( "Multipart shape type not supported" ), tr(

Shouldn't it be "select a different editable, non multipart layer and

Hi all,

thinking about the next hackfest we could organize it in Wroclaw,
Poland, at the University.
Wroclaw is an old, beautiful city easily accesible by train or plane.

The venue we propose is Department of Climatology and Atmosphere
Protection, University of Wroclaw. It is located in the most beautiful
part of Wroclaw and is freely available from June to September. But
having in mind Barcelona conference, we think it would be convenient
to plan the hackfest for begining of July, lets say 2nd-5th of July.

Let us know if You like the idea, please.


Pawe? Netzel &
Milena Nowotarska

Hi,
during last hackfest has been also made a candidature for Portugal
(Lisbon, served by low cost flight companies). We have already the
interest of a local University to host the event.


Let us know

Hi Hugo,

in my case I removed qgis (all the osgeo4w installation), R, and the
folders where R/QGIS store libraries/plugins. Then I scanned the system
with CCleaner to remove registry errors.

After the re-installation of all the components all is working fine.


To notice that under Seven (english locale) the R console seems to want
to install the libraries into a folder called 

'C:\Users\username\Documents/R/win-library/2.11'

but that actually doesn't exist, because is ""My Documents" instead.


So the libraries in 'C:\Users\username\My Documents/R/win-library/2.11'

seem to be ignored by qgis plugins.


SDA4PP install the libraries in another location, that it good

C:\Users\username\R\win-library\2.11


cheers

The same for the other problem you reported (create new spatialite layer
fails).

I think it would be good if we could revise the blocking bugs, and decide
which ones are really blocking the release.

Hi,

I was testing the plugin under windows and linux and I noticed the
following.


Under Windows (Seven , XP) sometimes it returns:


---------------------
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Documents and Settings\jirodrig/.qgis/python/plugins
\GoogleLayers\GoogleLayers.py", line 151, in run
    z = min(max(int(ceil(log(min(width / ((x2 - x1) * 256), height /
((y2 - y1) * 256)), 2))), 0), 19)
ValueError: math domain error

Python version:
2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)]


QGIS version:
1.5.0-Trunk Trunk, 13555M
---------------------


other times the error doesn't show, but the only tile it adds to the map
is ths one that shows the full extent on the world.



Under Linux (ubuntu) things seems to work better, but if I save a
project that includes one or more tiles, then when I try to reopen the
project qgis crashes with the following message

-----------
Error: 
	GDAL Error 6: No translation an empty SRS to PROJ.4 format is known.
Segmentation fault
-----------

Thx for the help guys...Also using osgeo4w and the same conf. managed with
ease to get it working on my computer at home (xp) and linux also, but not
in computer at work. I guessing it doesn't work mainly because of the no
administrative rights - i think - 

Will dig on R to see if I can make those packages work with external
programs other than R itself.

Thx again for the help.

Cheers

I can only suggest a small list of known bugs/problems to be resolved in
time for 1.5, otherwise it will be considered a regression.


*) (after the GRASS raster provider has changed) raster properties for
GRASS rasters are not working/make no more sense. It works just the
transparency slider and a few other things. This panel need to be
changed.

*) raster icons in legend do not show anymore

*) ticket #2601
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2601

it make basically qgis useless under windows if a user has vectors in a
crs that is not included in the qgis default list.

I think there's some need for clarification about what a "must fix"
ticket should be and if that means it must be fixed for the next
release. Some of those bugs clearly need to be addressed but since
they've never worked as expected unless we choose that 1.5 should have
them they aren't must fix for 1.5. I would bump those to try to get them
done in 1.6

Maybe people are confused by the "must fix" and assume that we won't
look at the bug seriously if it doesn't have that. All tickets that
aren't enhancements are 'must fix' in my mind. Perhaps that term should
be "must fix for next release" or "plan to fix for upcoming release"

For instance  #2610 (Printing with SVG symbols: QGIS ignores totally the
size of SVG symbol) - Yes I agree we must fix this eventually, but I'm
not sure this ever worked right or that is a goal of 1.5 for this to
work right.

Things like segfaults and other types of crashes seem to be appropriate
things to at least try and solve before the release.

Thanks,
Alex

Oh sleepy me, looks like it does say "must fix for next release" but
people don't realize that's a tool for the dev team to indicate that
they "plan to fix for upcoming release", aka a "showstopper".

I had hoped to see #1786 (highlight selected SVG symbols) resolved, and 
I have an interest in #2528 (jumping items in legend) -- I've seen it 
often and had it reported to me, but I can't reproduce it consistently.

However, 1786 can be worked around without too much difficulty in a 
plugin, and I haven't had the time to make 2528 reproducible (or find 
the funding to fix it).

So, I guess I'm just expressing a wish list from one group of users.  If 
there aren't any solutions to those waiting nearby, they're probably 
impractical to fix with a deadline one month away.

Hi, I did some code cleaning to this plugin in the past. Currently,
code is still based on original version and it is still not very good.
I would do rather complete rewrite.

This formula is from original code and it is not very clear for me.
Maybe we can try to break it to smaller parts to detect the problem.
In my case it is OK. (I do not have any windows computer to test.)

On my Debian Lenny and current QGIS Trunk I receive this error always
I  save the project, but without segfault and crashing. I will look at
it.

I have found the reason of this problem. Would You please try to
replace original 'GoogleLayers.py' file with file attached in this
mail and test on Ubuntu?

Hi Borys,
more changes to plugin are needed. If You think deleting plugin
provided by original developer and uploading my version with me as
maintainer is ok, it can be better way than always asking You to
upgrade.

Hi Ivan,

the attached file made the trick, no more crashes under ubuntu when
opening the project file.


I tested the plugin under windows on other machines and I always see the
same behaviour: or the already reported pyhton error or it adds only
tiles with z:0.


thanks!

Hi all,
I attached a patch for ticket #2711. It should be related with tickets #2528

and #2018.
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2711
I hope it could fix all the three problems ;)
I think it may also resolve other crashes in legend drad'n'drop.

Cheers

Hi Giuseppe

The psc needs to decide about svn write access. As you agreed to be the 
maintainer of the GDAL Tools, I'm going to propose it to the psc (it can take 
up to a few days ).

Regards,
Marco

The main problem is that there's too confusion between old and new
symbology. Let me explain why:

- selecting a SVG symbol: works in the new symbol, but not in the old.
- categorized symbol rotation based on an field attribute: present in the
old, but not in the new. (Recentely wonder has implemented for
non-categorized new symbol)
- printing a map with the new symbology is different to the screen.

OK. This patch was just for problem on Linux (GDAL Error 6: No translation an empty SRS to PROJ.4 format is known.).

Paolo, thanks.  Somehow I'd missed that.

Re #1786 and Luca's point: for our purposes at least, having it fixed in 
new symbology is perfectly adequate.

Hi pfth,

did you find a solution to this problem?

I'm trying to print a map using the code Martin provided you but I get the
exact same problem. The application crashes a few seconds after the ong is
created. The crash is caused by the same line of code.

The plugin doesn't import matplotlib directly, so seems it's a problem with 
Qwt5 still (or rather its dependency on matplotlib)...

It's there - src/app/qgisapp.cpp:2793

maybe there's a problem in the moc processing?

...I could blame the small type on my iPhone screen for not noticing  
that you changed newSpatialiteLayer() and thinking it was  
addSpatialiteLayer() ;-)  Or I could blame my frazzled brain while  
dealing with a HD crash.

whatever - oops, sorry for the noise

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Seamless 3D Landscape Explorer...for QGIS
Message-ID: <4BFD79A7.8010409@enoreth.net>

Hi,

I would like to point out the existence of a 3D visualization software 
using OGRE [1] and Quantum GIS, it is called Seamless Landscape Explorer 
(SLE). It has been in development since at last 2008 [3] by S?bastien 
Griffon and Daniel Auclair, both from a french public research 
department [2].

This is a virtual visualization tool aiming to help to represent the 
evolution of an existing landscape [5] using land use layers, DEM and 
orthophotos. These data are manipulated and prepared under QGIS [4] 
(selection of the sources, display area, choice of the attributes) and 
once ready, are exported to SLE for the 3D part. Each attribute can be 
associated to a texture or a 3D model. One should not see it as an 
nviz-like but it still is an awesome tool.

The dependencies are Ogre / Qt / Caelum for skys&clouds/ Paged Geometry 
/ GDAL / Libnoise / QGIS

I found out about this software only today via a qgis'user on a french 
gis board and a quick search had led me to conclude that it could also 
be a pleasant surprise for some of you around here. I'll contact these 
researchers to get more informations (availability, license, etc.) and 
will report it here. Don't forget to watch out the videos [6]!

Jean Roc, thanks a lot!
This is a much asked for feature. Any chance of having SLE widely
available, also as packages for major OSs, for direct testing?
All the best.

it seems to work under win7 with qgis trunk/osgeo4w.





I'm also seeing a number of problems, they may (or not) be related to
the ones reported by Paolo today. I just upgraded to the latest version
of sda4pp.


*) on both linux and windows if there are no point layers in the project
and you open a tool, when you click on the "close" button you get always
a message like


Traceback (most recent call last):

in runClose
    sda4ppRoptions.closeRplot(self.R)
AttributeError: 'IntensityTool' object has no attribute 'R'


this seems to not happen with the "kriging" tool





*) under linux (ubuntu 10.04) the tools keeps telling 

"the plugin does not support unicode characters, Please..." 

even when there are no unicode chars, I used for instance your sample
dataset.






*) under ubuntu 9.04 all the tools return


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/gio/.qgis/python/plugins/SDA4PP/sda4pp.py", line 270, in

Message-ID: <AANLkTilDG4qoksTOjS1PygzyCX31qga1kgake1t8O9S4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
while I wrote a patch for QgsLegend, I found an issue related with
segmentation faults.

Here the bugged code:

QTreeWidgetItem* destItem = mDropTarget;
...
QgsLegendItem* dest = dynamic_cast<QgsLegendItem *>( destItem );

If mDropTarget is NULL QGis crashes with segfault.
In this case the problem is the dynamic_cast, used without make a null test
on destItem.

May some other crashes be due to a code like this??

Cheers.

Hi,

I made a few QGIS installation under Ubuntu 10.04, both using qgis 1.4
from the ubuntugis repository or compiling trunk.

I noticed that in all the cases the menus are missing the icons,
including plugins.

Anyone else has noticed this?

I just seen a very similar problem on a Linux machine, Ubuntu 10.04,
qgis trunk.

the plugins just add tiles with z:0 or throws

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ubc/.qgis/python/plugins/GoogleLayers/GoogleLayers.py",

I was working on a plugin of mine last night and noticed the window icon
had disappeared. I was only able to get it back by putting it in a
resource file, for some reason realative path just wasn't cutting it. I
wonder if this is related.

I think it is a bug or not setting proper backward compatibility in the
pyqt. I am using the designer to form all GUIs.

I upgraded the pyqt from 4.4.3-1 to 4.7.3-1 in windows xp. This error may be
related with this upgrade.

In the pyqt 4.4.3.1, it is; self.spinBoxF.setProperty("value",
QtCore.QVariant(0.1))

where as in 4.7.3-1, it is; self.spinBoxF.setProperty("value", 0.1).


QtCore.QVariant() is added so the error should be fixed.

the similar code is also added in the ui_graphics.py, where for example  in
line 106, it is: self.dSpinBoxHeight.setProperty("value", 600.0)

by the way I tested these guis with and without adding QtCore.QVariant() in
ubuntu 9.10 (4.6-1) and 10.04(4.7.2-0ubuntu1), and all is working. so this
is only valid for ubuntu 9.04

I do not have ubuntu 9.04. last week upgraded to 9.10 and I do not want to
install it again. so do you confirm that these errors are fixed
when QtCore.QVariant() is added.

if you confirmed this solution, we should report this issue to pyqt
community, shouldn't we?

I've got a reply from S?bastien Griffon, SLE is the result of an 
European Union's project called SEAMLESS which occured from 2005 till 
March 2009. Since this program has been partially pursued by the 
SEAMLESS Association [2] under the MPL, however due to AMAP's change of 
priority SLE has been put on hold. For these reasons the software wasn't 
publicized but its main dev is interested in a collaboration to improve 
the qgis plugin (as it is not compatible with the latest versions).

So the question is pretty simple, is there someone with technical skills 
willing to work with him ? This tool would really, really be popular.

There isn't a website for SLE but here is some bibliography around it :

Hi Alessandro,

when installing the plugin I get


"The plugin seems to have been installed but I don't know where.
Probably the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.

Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find
the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It
also means that I won't be able to determine if this plugin is installed
and inform you about available updates. However the plugin may work.
Please contact the plugin author and submit this issue."



Nevertheless the plugin seems to install and works but the plugin shows
twice in the installer, both as installed and not installed.

Using qgis under ubuntu linux.


Cheers

it really passes trough compiling code. If you are not comfortable I can
manage you qgis packages with the plugin included. Which flavour of
Ubuntu are you using? karmic or lucid?

Considered that is a really cool tool it would be better to have the
plugin added upstream... the possibility has been considered by the devs
(both of the plugin and qgis)?

I noticed that the dll version of the plugin for windows has problems
(qgis crashes when activating the plugin in the manager), there is a fix
on sight?

cheers!

I tested again on another 10.04 machine and I didn't had problems. But
the machine where it gives this error has Ubuntu localized in PT_PT
instead of EN. Could this be related considering that is seems to be a
problem with encoding? Do you want me to do further tests?

it gives another error now (see below), but if want to drop 9.04 support
no problem, I'm dropping too 9.04 this weekend :)

Fixed: so silly that qgis cannot handle zipfile name different from plugin
name, no room for version numbers :(

Hi all,
without any changes to that code, now QGis doesn't crash more if
I drop a layer in an invalid place.

I don't know if it was due to a bad compilation, but I'm sure
I compiled and recompiled QGis while I was searching for the error.

Cheers.

Still can't see any icon

Not exactly - you can use any suffix after a dot: myPlugin.suffix.zip
Note, that it concerns only the zip file and the directory inside still must 
be named just "myPlugin", without any suffix. 

This way you can keep multiple zip files and differentiate them by the 
"experimental" and "qgis_minimum_version" tags. Unfortunately, still only one 
of them can be installed.

This sounds odd, I can see the icons now. I tried to uninstall, checked that
the directory was deleted and reinstalled.

this plugin drops to support 9.04.

plugin is revised due;

to reverse the changes in the GUI,
to log the version of pyqt and rpy2
and a small note in the log file, if pyqt is smaller than 4.4.3

I don't think dynamic_cast on null pointers are bad.  But all should be
accompanied with a test for the result.  In qgslegend there are several places
where the result is not checked before dereferencing it.  For instance line
266 and 326 - but not in your quoted code.

I agree with you, it's strange without dereferencing.
But I added some debug message to understand where QGis crashed and the
line was the same of the dynamic_cast.
BTW now works fine.

Hi all

just a short note regarding my GSoC project "QGIS on steroids" - this
week I've successfully defended my master thesis ("Structural
recognition of facades") [1] and passed the final university exams, so
with a small delay I'm starting to work on the project. I'm really
looking forward to make QGIS faster!

Hi Martin,

This could be a nice QGIS summer camp :-)

With Multiple stops selected, i click the Add stop button and the color dialog appears where I then select the color and click OK. The Offset of the stop dialog appears. Whether I click Cancel or OK, QGIS no longer responds when the dialog closes. At this point I must kill QGIS.

I'm unable to replicate the problem here (linux). Does it happen
always, with any color and any offset?

I think the must-fix flags doesn't make much sense. It has been
created a long time ago, but never much used. Its meaning overlaps
with ticket priority and users tend to mark all bugs as must fix (and
that is natural, if they report the bug, they want it to be fixed).

We've created a patch[1] sometime ago to make small modifications to
raster properties window. Now the button we suggested is added, but
icon is missing [2] and nothing works, patch is not applied either. What
was the purpose of these modifications instead of applying patch is not clear.

As I said before, I don't mind including it at all, however, we cannot
guarantee operational support, though we do try to keep it runnable. If I remember right, this was the
stumbling point before. No maintainer - no inclusion in trunk.

I do think it would be fine for there to be a way for the developers to
flag which ones they plan to fix for a specific release and which
release is the target. There is a question of course about how to set
this up so it doesn't get set by everyone for everything.

With that in place I'd be fine dropping the current tag.

Thanks,
Alex

Still some errors with 0.190, after the execution of a command, when clicking on
"Close" (checked Uniform Intensity, Adaptive Density, etc.)

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/paolo/.qgis/python/plugins/SDA4PP/intensity.py", line 63, in runClose

Kernels give the following, due to the missing prj file, when saving to a raster (it
may be safer to take the proj from raster properties?):

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems with shapes projections,
	now also under linux
Message-ID: <AANLkTinyAqAXmdLq0cOkR8O--xZGkN57ZhjnOF73oYgM@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am using qgis trunk r13502 under ubuntu linux (10.04) and I'm seeing
problems with shapes projections:

When opening a shape qgis do not show the right crs in the "properties ->
general" menu, regardless if the vector projection is available in the qgis
crs list or not (in my case it shows wgs84 as defined in "options -> CRS").

This is similar to

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2601

as seen on windows, that by the way seems to me a show stopper on the road
to 1.5


Moreover when saving a shape ("save as...")  the .qpj file is saved in the
home folder instead of the choosen location.


Cheers

It fails with any color or offset selection. The fact that it hangs whether I click OK or Cancel in the offset dialog would indicate a problem exiting this dialog in the GUI.

I'm unable to replicate the problem here (linux). Does it happen
always, with any color and any offset?

you need to clean out the old auto-generated moc-files from your
build directory using "make clean".

Hi,

more notes.

I tested r13584 under ubuntu 10.04: in general it recognize shapes crs
that are in qgis db, but fails with shapes crs that are not in db. This
message is shown in the context ba

crs undefined - defaulting to default CRS

the same that appens under windows as described in ticket #2601

There are other shapes that r13584 fails to read right crs, like
http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/CAOP20090_Shapes/Cont_AAd_CAOP20090.zip
http://www2.apambiente.pt/atlas/dl/regista_dl.jsp?zona=continente&grupo=&tema=c_redehidro

with the same two shapes I don't have problems with r13569 under ubuntu
9.04

Under windows .qpj files are written in c:\ with xp, and are not written
at all under Seven, probably because it does not allow to write in c:\



cheers

Hi Giovanni and others,
would You please test latest version of Google Layers plugin ?
You can get it here: http://gista.sk/home/ivo/dl/GoogleLayers-0.7.0b1.zip

Backup Your current installation and ?unpack it in to Your plugins directory.

I did complete code rewrite and tried to fix all known issues.

I've found the source of the problem and fixed it in r13602. For an
instant workaround, once the rendering is done, explicitly delete the
composerMap:

c.removeItem(composerMap)
del composerMap

That should the segfault.

This is my idea of bad bugs, even if not blocking are pretty evident
especially for new qgis users

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2339

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2688

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2740

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2711 (patch)

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/699 (patch)

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2528 (solved by one of the above
patches?)

Plus I would say that fixing the "value tool" plugin to work again with
GRASS rasters would be really good... GRASS analysis without this tool
become a pain.


cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Plugin Manager Enhancements
Message-ID: <4C035747.9070408@wildintellect.com>

A couple of suggestions (I'll attempt to poke at a patch after next week).

It would be great to allow multiple selections in the install/upgrade.
Should be possible to simple change the properties of the widget to
allow multi-select and then to do a loop for each selection using the
current code.

When upgrading a tool that will no longer make it work with the version
of QGIS installed, you should be notified and allowed to keep your
current version.
Example: GDALTools most recent version after selecting upgrade told me
that it now only works with 1.5(which isn't officially release yet), my
only option was to then uninstall. So know I no longer have GDALTools
unless I go find a previous version (not even sure where to look) and
install by hand.
- Possible solution, create a backup copy before install, and offer a
revert option on failed upgrade?
- Warn user before the install the the minimum version has changed and
allow them to cancel with no change.
- Not list the upgrade if the minimum version is above what's installed.
I believe this is how it filters for not yet installed plugins, should
also apply to upgrade listings.

Normally plugin upgrades are relatively safe as they simply fix things
or improve on stuff, to change the minimum required version out from
under people generally seems like a bad idea, especially when it forces
an upgrade to QGIS to a version that is only available via compiling.

Thanks,
Alex

Dear Milena,

Wroclaw sounds very nice - thanks a lot for your offer! If nobody votes
against it, we could make that fix - I think?

The only problem I see at the moment is the date. Begining of July or even
August (school vacations) is too close I think, because we need to
organize funding, holiday, flights etc. Then comes the FOSS4G, 6.-9.
September in Barcelona and most people are probably broke after that for a
while :). So I guess end october / beginning november as in Vienna is most
likely.

What do others think?

  Otto

+1 for Otto's vote. I also would prefer beginning of November due to the
reasons Otto mentioned.

Can You investigate more and let me know ? Can be the problem in different proj versions You are using for Your Qgis 
instalations ? (Some proj version is containing EPSG: 900913, some not.)

We need on-the-fly only in case, we want to overlay Google maps with layers in different projections. Do we understand 
each other ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new symbology terminology
Message-ID: <AANLkTimEwC3bEC8q8MEjEbsepQWU8RlyxoFGl2RCNPZU@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

It has just occurred to me that the renderer types may be mislabeled
in the new symbology dialog. It appears as though the Categorized
renderer is actually set up for a continuous range of values, and the
Graduated renderer is actually set up for classified ranges of values
(i.e. requires the specification of the number of classes etc.). In
fact, these two renderer types should be reversed. Obviously,
categorization implies that objects are grouped into categories (or
classes), whereas graduated symbology should really refer to a
continuous colour variation, where each (numeric) value should be
coloured according to its relationship with all other values in the
field.
Any thoughts by cartographers more experience than myself?

Carson

Yes, we are aware the date we proposed is close, and not our usual
hackfest time. We were trying to put it as far in time from Barcelona
as possible, also when the venue (and the nice grill place there) is
accessible.

@Pawe?: What other dates can we propose? (maybe 12-15 Nov, as 11th is
free in PL?)

Best,
Milena

Hi, today I found a way to resolve this issue.

All what you must do is to:

 1) download latest FWTools for windows;
 2) open it with 7z or another program;
 3) navigate through bin folder and extract NCS*.dll (four files);
 4) copy them onto bin folder of QGIS.exe and remove the _fw from filename;

try it. If it doesn't still work, please create a new qgis.bat, set the
windows PATH to point first to the qgis bin folder, like this:

   PATH  <qgis bin folder>;%PATH%
   qgis.exe

The patch for the ticket #699 should solve also the #2528

Message-ID: <201005312236.40938.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Hi Devs,
Due to never-ending problems with Polish CRSes and I need to add alternavtive 
definitions for epsg 2172-2180, 3120, 3328-3335 and 4179 to our srs.db (they 
are be hopefuly to removed after gdal 1.8 is released).

AFAIK, the 4xxxx codes aren't officialy reserved, so if nobody oposes, I'll 
use codes 40000 + epsg, so 42172-42180, 43120, 43328-43335 and 44179. 
Alternatively, I can use consecutive codes 40004-40023

Happy last minutes of new features creation ;)
