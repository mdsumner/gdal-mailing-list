I run into this error myself today. I didn't install any plugin recently
that might have changed this settings.

Thanks a lot for this, Nyall. It works a treat!



I did notice a curious behavior, though.? The stdout callback seems to only be called every so often, and there doesn't seem to be a control for that in the documentation for the relevant objects. Did I miss anything?



Cheers,

Pedro

Hello fellow QGIS'ers.

I have a (new to me) problem in my hands.

I am building an interface to run a large transportation simulation model (https://polaris.taps.anl.gov/polaris-studio/index.html) from a QGIS plugin, and I would like to update the interface as the simulation progresses.

The issue here is that this simulation is done inside a compiled C++ executable from which I cannot emit any QT signals, so I have to do it "manually" by processing the logfile generated by the application.

I currently don't see a way to do this, as the calling the simulation processes captures the GIL and I can't update the interface, but is there another way of doing this?



I am at a bit of a loss, so I appreciate any pointers.








I'd suggest following the approach used by the GDAL processing algorithms. See

Message-ID: <051f7625-c9d9-4ad8-af0f-9f2b671c2501@libero.it>

Hi all,
various user are reporting that the issue no longer occurs on Windows 
using  QGIS 3.34.6 and QGIS 3.36.3 from OSGeo4W.

Since the OSGeo4W installers of both such versions (3.34.6 and 3.36.3) 
ship a bunch of updated libraries [1] (with the Qt library among them), 
then it looks like the root cause of the issue may have been due to a 
library used by QGIS and not to QGIS itself.

Best regards.

It's definitely still an issue for curved labels.

The issue about curved RTL  labels has been reported about 10 years ago 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/21940 since QGIS 2 and confirmed by 
users at least until QGIS 3.28.8 and QGIS 3.32.0.

I can confirm such issue also occurs on my Windows 10 system (on which 
the https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54098 issue didn't occur) even 
using QGIS 3.34.7 and QGIS 3.36.3 from OSGeo4W.

So I think https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/54098 can now be closed 
as an upstream issue, while https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/21940 is 
still a valid QGIS issue.

Howdy,

I want to know which are the keys of each shape in the  setShapeProperties(
*self*, *properties: Dict[str, Any]*) method of
qgis.analysis.Qgis.Point3DShape.
It would help me choose a 3d model as a point symbol.
There is no mention of them in the PyQGIS docs (

Hi Abdelghani,

Reading the source code, we can deduce the properties.
I agree that the documentation is too light here.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/3d/symbols/qgspoint3dsymbol.cpp#L172

For a cylinder, the properties are "length", "radius" (default values 
are 10).
For a sphere: "radius" (default value is 10).
For a cone: "length" (default value is 10).
For a cube: "size"(default value is 10).
For a torus: "radius" (default value is 10), "minorRadius" (default 
value is 5).
For a plane: "size" (default value is 10).
For extruded text: "depth" (default value is 1).
For Model and Billboard: no property.

I only did a "translator" job here :-)?? and I don't know if the 3D 
shapes that are listed make sense for you.
Regards,

Jacky Volpes

Hello Jacky,

Thank you for your effort, it is much clearer now.
Since Model has no property, then the dictionary in the
.setShapeProperties() method should be empty?
But how do I input the model's directory into the QgsPoint3DSymbol() ?

Here is my attempt of doing so, for now it doesn't work :













*# get the layer named "arbre"layer =
QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName('arbre')[0]s = QgsPoint3DSymbol()#
set 3d model to the symbolmodel =
qgis.analysis.Qgis.Point3DShape(7)s.setShape(model)s.setShapeProperties({"Model"
: "C:/Users/atamort/Downloads/trees_low_poly.fbx"})renderer =
QgsVectorLayer3DRenderer(s)layer.setRenderer3D(renderer)*

Any help would be appreciated !

Best,
Abdelghani

Good Morning!

I had submitted a question about the usage of 3D functions through PYQGIS (Conversation forwarded below*).
I attempted the usage of the recommended drape function through PYQGIS and have not had much success. 
	(Mainly, how would I create the raster layer from a constant slope?)
I assume many of my issues has come from me not knowing much about PYQGIS as I am relatively new to the environment.
This being the case how would I create a 3D layer in which the z values are determined by a constant slope? 
	(How would I even determine the start/end of said slope?)

Any feedback on my current progress is greatly appreciated!

Many Thanks,
Jean Garcia

Sorry for the confusion my request might have created.
I am quite new to QGIS and have had to do a lot of online research with not much success. (mostly vaguely searching through QGIS Documentation)

The project I am working on is to generate a layer based on given parameters, one of said parameters being the slope of each layer's Z Values.
	(one said layer being stated as a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 ft) With said slope I wish to make the 2D layers I have already generated appear in a 3D view.

I did some research into the drape tool, and while I do believe it could work my issue is how would I create the raster layer with the Z values?
Since the Z values would depend entirely on the different parameters, it would not be set Z values. 
	(What even is the function to create the raster layer?)

My current thinking is to calculate the Z values based on the slope and starting height of each layer.
How do you think I should go around doing so?

Thanks,
Jean A. Garcia

What exactly are you trying to do? There's many ways this request could be interpreted.

(Maybe the "drape" tool from the processing toolbox does what you need?)

Hello,

Quick update, the right key to put was "model".

Message-ID: <995278320.1751083.1717675560240@webmail.mymagenta.at>

Dear QGIS Developers,
 
I need your help with my new QGIS Georeferencer Extension Plugin: https://github.com/cxcandid/GeorefExtension
 
Although many have already downloaded the plugin from the official Plugin Repository, I still have no feedback that it works on Linux and OSX.
I have labeled it as "Experimental" only for this reason, as I have been using it productively under Windows for several years without problems.
 
I would therefore like to ask you to test the plugin under Linux and OSX.
Please send me your feedback.
 
Best regards,
Christoph

Message-ID: <46404a1835c54c4e9059f25f66cc6f6b@erdc.dren.mil>

I don't program in C#, but our team is looking to create a custom front end Landing Page/Dashboard in C# where QGIS would be an application running within this front end would also launch other custom apps we have developed all inside a C# window/container.

So looking to compile QGIS into a DLL so that C# code can access the main application entry point and open it within a C# window.

Can this be done and is there is a step by step guide to compile QGIS and can it be compiled into a DLL and do what I am describing.

Hoping I am explaining it well enough that someone can understand what I am trying to do and point one of our team developers to any step by step instructions.

Appreciate any help,
Luke

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using setMapTool with native rotate feature method
 in Advanced Digitizing Toolbar
Message-ID: <874fd145e8624f61a9baa4e0feee54c0@erdc.dren.mil>

I use the statement:

facility_placement_tool = FacilityPlacementTool(iface.mapCanvas(), vlayer_crs)
iface.mapCanvas().setMapTool(facility_placement_tool)

to set a custom tool on the map canvas. It allows me to move a feature layer around the map canvas using the translateFeature method of the layer using the canvasMoveEvent of FacilityPlacementTool until I click on the left mouse button.  Once the user clicks the left mouse, I detect that event and I run a method, rotateFeature, below that allows me to use the native QGIS rotate method.  I can then rotate the feature.  Expecting this to happen, it then seems that the rotate tool takes over the map canvas events from my FacilityPlacementTool  so when I right click to end the rotate on the feature that's all that happens. But I want the right click to end editing which have in the canvasPressEvent method in FacilityPlacementTool.   Is there a way after the code below runs and the user ends the rotate tool by right clicking that right click even can then be passed onto the FacilityPlacementTool tool or I can just run some other method that closes out the edit session.
  Also wondering why I have to get to the rotate feature tool with the code below, but there is a iface.actionMoveFeature().trigger() statement I can call to move a feature  Why isn't there a iface.actionRotateFeature().trigger() method.

def rotateFeature(self):
        # Get all actions
        actions = iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QAction)

        # Check the action
        action = [x for x in actions if x.objectName()=='mActionRotateFeature'][0]

        # Run the action
        action.trigger()

It's still not clear what you're trying to achieve. This is probably
more appropriate for a gis.stackexchange post, along with sketches
illustrating what you're after.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] UX of Raster Legend in the QGIS Layers Panel
Message-ID: <456a7ea0-0adb-408e-9dcd-6598afe0014d@uni-marburg.de>

Dear QGIS Developers,

I am a long time user, first time subscriber to this list. I am active 
though for some years within the local
OSGeo Chapter of Germany FOSSGIS (and the QGIS user group), so some 
people on the list might be able
to put a face on this message.

I am always expressing my gratitude to the QGIS dev-community in 
personal, so let me start with a big thank you.
I have been using QGIS for the last 10 years and our community has come 
a long way.

Now to my issue: A few versions back QGIS has started to expand raster 
files with a legend, once they are
added to the layer-panel. We are working mostly with georeferenced 
historical maps, so for the most part
the maps are simple RGB files with transparency. And often we add dozens 
of maps which make up a city.
Leading to long lists of expanded legends informing about the fact that 
all maps are made up of RGB color bands.

Additionaly we are relying on the opacity slider, which can be added to 
the layer tree, allowing for a convenient
way to control the opacity of the added maps. However the slider is only 
visible when the map is expanded in the layer-panel.

I have posted a while back on mastodon and have added some images for 
illustrative purposes:

https://fedihum.org/@oshistory/111821429135997460

Perhaps the following alterations might be considered for an improved UX:

 ?- new raster layers are collapsed by default (users who need to 
inspect the legend can toggle it)
 ?- users can decided if they want the legend to? be displayed. This 
could for instance be set within the Legend
 ?? Tab of the Layer Properties panel. In fact, there already is an 
option to use a placeholder, maybe a simple boolean
 ?? checkbox could serve as a graphical control item
 ?- maybe the legend and other UI Elements (like the mentioned opacity 
slider) could be seperated.

Best Wishes,

Niklas Alt, Marburg, Germany

Hi Niklas,

thank you for your ideas, why don't you file an "enhancement" ticket on
github so that people can discuss it there?

Attaching a few mockups about your proposed changes would also be helpful.

Kind regards.

   Good morning,
   I am the maintainer of the qgis2web plugin and to update the metadata of the plugin I removed the previous maintainer "tomchadwin" putting myself "andreaordonselli" and at the same time I removed myself from the list of collaborators.
   Once this information was saved I was no longer able to have the necessary permissions to upload new releases and edit the plugin. In fact I no longer see qgis2web among the "my plugins" list.
   Lastly, I wanted to include "tomchadwin" as a collaborator, but I couldn't find his name in the list.
   I ask for help.
   Thank you.

Dear Andrea Ordonselli

According to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues/303 and https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/316, the new maintainer should also listed in the collaborators field. The state of the original author is preserved so she/he won?t be (and doesn?t need to be) listed in the collaborators list. Additionally, you could check the Display ?Created by? in the plugin details checkbox to show the original author user in the plugin details.
I?ve restored the qgis2web plugin Maintainer and Collaborators to its previous state. You should have access to the plugin now.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you need any more help.

Best regards,
Lova

Hi,

I am trying to compile QGIS 3.36 release code and during cmake
configuration I am getting the following error.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMake Error at C:/OSGeo4W/apps/gdal/lib/cmake/gdal/GDAL-targets.cmake:83
(message):
The imported target "GDAL::GDAL" references the file

"C:/OSGeo4W/apps/gdal/lib/gdal309.lib"

but this file does not exist. Possible reasons include:

* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

* The installation package was faulty and contained

"C:/OSGeo4W/apps/gdal/lib/cmake/gdal/GDAL-targets.cmake"

but not all the files it references.

Call Stack (most recent call first):

Is there any code error. There is not gdal309.lib at path

Message-ID: <8d2b2a7e9cca4cb8949589cbf7d2a042@erdc.dren.mil>

Is there a signal emitted that I can have code execute after a feature rotation is completed from the advanced digitizing toolbar?

I call the rotate tool via the code below and upon completing of the rotate with a mouse click, I want to close the edit session.

def rotateFeature(self):
        # Get all actions
        actions = iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QAction)

        # Check the action
        action = [x for x in actions if x.objectName()=='mActionRotateFeature'][0]

        # Run the action
        action.trigger()

As long as the plugin license is compatible with QGIS license, the source
code is available and you don't package any binaries with the plugin.
I don't see any issue with that.

Kind regards.

Hi Luke,

If you have the vector layer object (say vlayer), you can listen to the 
vlayer.editBuffer().geometryChanged() signal for example.
But it highly depends on the context.

Is there a difference in using:

vlayer.editBuffer().geometryChanged()  vs vlayer.geometryChanged()

They both work.

Is there a signal emitted that I can have code execute after a feature rotation is completed from the advanced digitizing toolbar?

I call the rotate tool via the code below and upon completing of the rotate with a mouse click, I want to close the edit session.

def rotateFeature(self):
        # Get all actions
        actions = iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QAction)

Would it be possible to add some metadata for plugins doing so,
like "in-app purchases" ?

Agreed.  This is not a license violation, but I do see it as a
significant anti-feature.  I would also see a plugin that only works if
you have a subscription as having an anti-feature.

I do think we should require descriptions for plugins that access
paywalled data (in-app purchase or not) to say that loudly, at least as
loudly as touting the benefits, so that nobody is mislead.  I don't mean
to discourage people that want to do this, more "This plugin exists to
support access paid data from X, making it easier for those with
subscriptions to get that data.  It further enables plugin users to buy
a subscription from within the plugin." rather than "This plugin lets
you access [description of wonderful data]."

Also from the F-Droid world is the antifeature of tracking.  I think we
should also be careful to not allow that, and I'd be inclined to just
not allow it, vs labeling it.  Obviously when a user asks to do
something that would make a reasonable person expect data to be sent
over the net, that's ok.  But it's a slippery slope, and I think it's
reasonable to have an expectation of data minimization.  One such
minimization might be not sending exact canvas coordinates, but no finer
granularity than 0.1 degree lat/lon, at least until it's clear what it's
doing.  For the actual fetching, I realize that is an issue with all
configured sources, so here I really mean for the signup part.

And, the plugin should not communicate off-host until the user asks it
do do so.  Phoning home isn't ok either.  (Again, not accusing this
not-written-yet plugin of doing that -- thinking in general.)

Separately from the ethical concerns, there's a security question that
comes up from in-plugin purchases which is handling of personal
information and presumably credit card/bank details.  I'm not saying
qgis is insecure -- but it has not really been thought of as handling
that kind of data (just sensitive geodata) before, and adding it brings
us in to new territory.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Get current QDockWidget in specific location
Message-ID: <adf4980b78664c118b317e8e77a114da@erdc.dren.mil>

How can I get the reference to a QDockWidget that is already docked.  I want to call tabifyDockWidget so I can add a new QDockWidget to the same location.  The first is already in place from exsiting code and I know I can probably create a getter method on the code that adds the first doc widget but I was hoping not add anything to that code and use some existing built in method that would allow be to specify a dock widget location and return a reference to what is currently docked at that location.

Thanks,
Luke

I don't really follow "not a new playstore or applestore".  The problem
with those places is that they are often the sole means, and enforce a
commission.  What we're talking about is totally different, following
f-droid's lead, which is just formalizing longstanding norms that Free
Software is expected to act in the user's interest, not the interest of
the people that distribute it.

The real issue here is that people are at least being seen as maybe
getting close to the line.  I'm suggesting being explicit to stay ahead
of that.

Hi Luke,


you can get a list of all QDockWidget objects in this way:

iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QDockWidget)

>From there you could get objectNames, whether the dock widget is visible or
not, its allowed areas and window title, among other properties.

The objectName is relevant, because you can pass it as the 3rd parameter to
addTabifiedDockWidget(), in this way:

iface.addTabifiedDockWidget(Qt.RightDockWidgetArea, my_own_dock_widget,
["ProcessingToolbox"])

In that way, your dock widget will be tabified taking the ProcessingToolbox
dock widget as a reference. If you want your dock widget on top, pass an
extra parameter raiseTab as True.

I hope this helps.


Regards,

Germ?n

BTW, note that you can omit the 3rd parameter in addTabifiedDockWidget()
and your dock widget will be tabified in that location, no matter which
dock widget is already placed there.

iface.addTabifiedDockWidget(Qt.RightDockWidgetArea, my_own_dock_widget)


On the other hand, if you really need to get existent dock widgets in a
given location, this function will do it:


def dockWidgetsInArea(area):
    dwa = []
    for dw in iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QDockWidget):
        if dw.isVisible() and iface.mainWindow().dockWidgetArea(dw) == area:
            dwa.append(dw)

    return dwa

Use it in this way:
dws = dockWidgetsInArea(Qt.RightDockWidgetArea)

Hi,

how can I set a GDB (geodatabase) layer as output in a processing algorithm with Python? The processing framework does not recognize the GDB correctly.
Currently, I try to use QgsProcessingOutputLayerDefinition('path-to-gdb|layername=xxx')

I also struggle to define the GDB in the processing dialog.

Hi everyone,

Here's my update for this week:

Overview:
This week, I focused on implementing a notification system for the monitoring website and working on the open issues on the QGIS Django and QGIS feed.

Completed Tasks:

  *   Set up notifications and alerts for QGIS?s new infrastructure monitoring and add documentation about it
  *   Add tags feature for the resource?s hub (Styles, Projects, Models?)<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/429>
  *   Allow the plugin?s approver to edit their feedback<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/430>
  *   Allow a feed approver to unpublish an entry<https://github.com/qgis/qgis-feed/pull/89>

Next steps:

  *   Review and deploy the latest changes on QGIS Django and QGIS Feed
  *   Fix some of the issues on QGIS Django and QGIS Feed

Questions/Feedback Needed:
I'm attempting to set up a watcher that will generate an alert if the QGIS API docs (https://api.qgis.org/api/) fails to build. I've looked into the GitHub workflows for the QGIS repo, but I'm not sure which event I should be listening for. It would be appreciated if anyone could provide a hint on this. Thanks in advance.

Have a nice weekend,
Best regards,

Lova

Hi QGIS Developers,

As many of you know, I developed 12 QGIS plugins. I will be retired by the
end of the month. NGA is supposed to take over maintenance of most of those
plugins, but at this point in time they don't have anyone who is really
qualified so I am not sure what will actually happen. If this does not
happen and someone finds a problem with any of them, let me know and I will
jump in and try to fix it, but I am going to let the process unfold to see
what happens.

If I can find a way to get paid for QGIS training or development then I am
interested in continuing to do some work, but I am also going to enjoy
retirement. Contact me if you need anything.

Message-ID: <CALarpe7jmH=UU+=TRAfi3tksnwaaT4_j0EgYxDjuLw6Ucrp=Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Below is a summary of my work for the past week, along with plans for the
upcoming week, and a couple of requests for assistance.

New Pull Requests:

   - SQL Results Window Clipboard
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/9137>
   - OGC API Source type for vector and raster
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/9133>

I am currently working on updating the documentation related to point cloud
data:

   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/7745
   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/7755
   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/9119

Plans for Next Week

Point Cloud documentation: I plan to finalize the updates for the point
cloud documentation.

Grammar and spelling checks for the QGIS Website: I will continue working
on editing the QGIS website content for grammar and spelling accuracy. I
have already begun this task and will focus on completing it.

*Requests for Assistance:*

Doctest Issue: The doctest in the documentation repository is failing. It
appears that this may be due to outdated Python versions. I'm not very
familiar with resolving this issue. If someone from the development team
could assist in updating the necessary versions or provide guidance, it
would be greatly appreciated.

PR Reviews: If anyone has time to review the open pull requests,
particularly the  SensorThings
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/9127> PR, it would be very
helpful.

Thanks in advance,
Have a nice weekend.
Selma

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFeewUk_pNU96QtcoDnTOgeDVVbKNezbKOe68Xn0e1Giiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Good news everyone - the detailed schedule is now available on the
conference website:
https://uc2024.qgis.sk/schedule/details/

We are expecting 50 talks and 15 workshops over the two days. For those
looking for a small escape from the conference buzz, there will be a large
"focus" / "quiet" room at the library right next to the conference rooms.
And after the first day of the conference, there will be a social event
with food and drinks.

A quick reminder: early bird tickets are available only until the end of
June - only two weeks left!

Those who plan to join the contributor meeting, please do not forget to add
your name to the list of participants on the wiki:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/27th%E2%80%90Contributor%E2%80%90Meeting%E2%80%90in%E2%80%90Bratislava

See you in Bratislava!

Regards
Martin (on behalf of the local organizing committee)

I am not sure what caused this. I have a suscipion that it might have 
been approved and then upon further investigation/testing then the 
plugin was unapproved. The plugin apparently containts external libs as 
reported in https://github.com/smandaric/bigquerylayers/issues/12. Maybe 
Paolo can shed more light on this.

This is quite difficult to manage. Apparently a user can submit a plugin 
for approval and before that version is approved they upload another one 
for approval. You end up with multiple version uploaded over a short 
period of time. When the approval happens you approve the latest version 
and you now end up with other versions which are not approved. It's up 
to the author to delete the other unapproved version or keep it as it 
currently happens leading to the confusion that the plugin is not approved.

Admire

Calvin,

Thanks for your contribution.  We use the Lat/Lon and MGRS Tools in our Joint Construction Management System (JCMS) Site Selection Plugin for QGIS that I am a lead developer on.

Here at ERDC-GRL and AGC in Alexandria, VA, we have always had a connection with NGA.  We hope NGA finds a developer who can continue maintaining the tools.

Hi All
This is very interesting and a real part of OS software management in
regards to maintainance once the creator wishes to retire (and rightly
so!). On top of that, if the ownership sits with an organisation. For
clarification, does NGA or do you, Calvin, own them?

I imagine if it is from one person to another, this is an informal
handover, but what happens when it is an organisation? Does an Assignment
of Ownership need to take place?

Cheers
Em

Hi All
Sorry - Correction here
Assignment of Ownership - is not a correct term nor instrument here. So
under the GPL license, this is overridden so an organsiation cannot have
ownership of the plugin.
What happens then - are they happy to give up?

This is a little complicated.  I have no knowledge of the details of
this situation but have dealt with open source licensing in the context
of US government contractors and US law.  Generally:

  When a person writes code, they hold copyright to it, except:

    If they have executed a copyright assignment, they don't.  This is
    typically either for contractors (either when the parties pretend it
    isn't employment or when it really isn't) or for individuals who
    assign to e.g. FSF.  Less happily, it can be some forms of CLA to
    some company.

    When an employed person writes code "within the scope of
    employment", then the employer holds copyright.  This is the "work
    for hire" doctrine.

    Works of the US government are not subject to copyright and are in
    the public domain.  (Different countries are different here,
    massively.)

  Code under an open source license does not need assignment for others
  to improve and distribute it, because the license grants those
  permissions.

  A plugin is arguably a derived work of qgis, and thus must be
  distributed under a compatible license.  (I think the project should
  express this as doctrine and decline to support or interact with
  (shun) plugins that don't have compatible licenses.)  So even if the
  US government does not hold copyright in their code, the resulting
  code is a derived work of qgis and can only be distributed under the
  GPL.

  Contributions to the plugin from others (e.g. if someone submitted a
  non-trivial change and it was merged) are copyrighted by them and thus
  a declared license leads to inbound=outbound terms, making it clear
  that the submitted change is licensed under the plugin's license.

  There are social issues about forks, separately from copyright, but
  Calvin's message is quite clear that someone who wants to maintain
  them (and have the updated/maintained code exist in the qgis world
  under the original names) would be good.

Thanks Greg
I have written up some ideas here
<https://qgis-australia.org/qgis/succession-planning/> that I hope goes
someway for future planners. It scares me as I was in an organisation that
went from totally support OS to trying to rid it with a vengeance.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Request for review before new release is cut
Message-ID: <ZnU4NhBzQ90NdXaL@c19>

It's packaging time today but I still have 5 pull requests
pending approval reviews: 

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls/strk

It is the well-known problem of the current review policy
blocking changeflow.

One of them was reviewed and approved by Benoit who was
the last one touching the file I'm refactoring to fix the
bug but he doesn't have "the powers" for his approval to
count. It still strike me that if it was him sending the PR,
instead of me (who am a "committer"), would have made it
possible to merge it immediately. Instead it still pending
after 1 month:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57514

Another one, which closes 3 bugs, has been reviewed by
Lauren?iu (GrayShade) who like me thinks being able to
run the tests locally is important. He even offered to
file the PR himself to allow me to approve and merge:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57606

This mail is to present two requests:

  1. To the release manager:
     Can to the release be postponed to give some
     time to reviewers to approve my pending PRs ?

  2. The the PSC:
     Can the policy be reviewed once again to find a
     better solution to this long-standing problem of
     growing PR queue (not being a bot that closes
     them after a while) ?

Thanks in advance.

As far as I can tell none of those are fixes for user facing bugs.

We release what's ready when it's time - unless something critical is spotted.
I'd say those could well be merged and backported after the release.

Was that ever really discussed?   AFAIK it was put in place and nobody really
objected, because it is generally a good thing.

But at least my contributions have gone down a lot by the introduction of these
hurdles (ie. mandatory PRs, delays by CI tests and reviews and even - or mainly? -
the improved stability of master, because stuff now breaks in PRs and doesn't
hit the nightlies of master, where I'd fix them) as it multiplies the effort
required for each of them (many mostly small ones).

Hi

I do think 1 of them is a user facing issue. It had a test added a couple
of minutes ago, so it's coming in hot. It's approved now.

2 of the pull requests are in draft, so not ready for review.
The other 2 are not user facing bugs but improving handling of local test
execution, which I don't expect to improve the quality of the release.
Out of these 4 pull requests, 3 have been opened in the last 2 days.

1. Given the above, and also for the reasons already outlined by our
release manager J?rgen, I don't think a change in the release schedule is
justified.

2. It would be great to have a shorter pull request queue. I am not sure
however that lowering the bar to bring code into the codebase with fewer
eyes looking over it is a good approach. I would prefer to try to onboard
new people into this process and give incentives to actively take part in
the review process. Let me take the opportunity to thank Benoit for his
review. As a very active contributor in the QGIS project for 2 years
already, I think we could also consider promoting him to a QGIS core
committer. That would reward him for his efforts, but at the same time also
give more review power to QGIS and maybe motivate others to follow his lead.

Kind regards
Matthias

Hi everyone,

Here's my update for this week:

Overview:
This week, I focused on implementing a notification system for the monitoring website and working on the open issues on the QGIS Django and QGIS feed.

Completed Tasks:

  *   Set up notifications and alerts for QGIS?s new infrastructure monitoring and add documentation about it
  *   Add tags feature for the resource?s hub (Styles, Projects, Models?)<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/429>
  *   Allow the plugin?s approver to edit their feedback<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/430>

4/5 actually are. One has been now merged by now, btw, so 3/4 are now.

Am I looking at a different PR queue? There's 4 open, 2 of which are
marked as draft and not ready for review (marked as draft by YOU), and
one of which is clearly just an improvement for running tests locally.

So there's 1 PR for a user-facing bug, which until 8 hours ago was
still being reviewed and had comments requiring action.

Can you PLEASE stop sharing misinformation here and inflaming a
situation which doesn't warrant it?

The draft are so becuase they are using the improvement one, which is
not only for running tests locally but it is for testing access to
PostgreSQL database as a user with restricted privileges.

I've updated its title to reflect what kind of improvements it has:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57802

I do see the problem with PRs changing titles, yes, but it's a
side-product of the slow review process, because I often find myself
with stumbling upon a dozen bugs and trying to find a good approach
to deal with the PR gate (should I file 12 PRs or a single one?).
Based on the assumption that a PR changing a lot of things would be
even harder to review, I usually aim at a smaller-focused PR, which
in the case at hand is "improve PostgreSQL test data bootstrap
script".

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Edit geometry of features with user differents
 from owner
Message-ID: <5aab028f-731e-3fa6-573a-81c673e5d532@ifremer.fr>

Hi everyone,

I have developed a plugin which can copy feature from shapefile to 
Oracle layer.

I used QgsVectorLayer.changeGeometry method for updating geometry.

It works when connected user is Oracle layer owner but it don't works 
with other user (which have editing grants on layer).

I found this issue without? apparent solution : 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37984

Can anynone update successfuly a geometry of layer with a user different 
from owner in recent version of QGIS (3.30) ?

Can anyone have an alternative solution ?

Otherwise, I can merge attributes source and target geometry in new 
entity for replacing existing entity but it's not elegant.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] commits revert policy
Message-ID: <ZnvyIlrgcSaWJdOV@c19>

I'd like to call core developers and PSC attention on commits
revert policy. 3 commits of mine were reverted with this PR:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57882

The PR was opened in my sleeptime and approved within 2 hours,
so I didn't have a chance to review the PR, which I think does
not help building a collaborative team around QGIS development.

I take responsibility on the contribution I provide and I think
that should be a requirement for being "a committer" (meaning of
which is yet to be defined since the switch to git).

Before switching to git being a "committer" meant taking a
committment to take care of the code, as opposed to send a patch
and disappear forever. I'd like to hold to my responsibilities
and thus partecipate in a fix of a problem I introduced.

This kind of responsibility is the one I see for example in
Benoit when he reviewed a PR that was reverting his commits here:

  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/57802

My reverting PR had the approval of the commit author, although
that one did not count as per the currently enforced rules (which
are inappropriate, IMHO, in this specific case).

Instead in the reverting of my commits I could not have a say,
and I don't think it's acceptable, especially when the revert is
said to be required to fix a segfault while no detail was given
about that. CI was green so did not trigger the segfault and
all the reverted commits did was avoiding hard-coded paths and
consistently honouring TMPDIR environemnt variable.

To me, if honouring TMPDIR triggers a segfault we clearly have a
bug in the testsuite, and I think an effort should be made (by all
developers) to help with fixing the testcase, not hiding the bug
under the carpet by disabling the test.

With this mail I propose the following policy:

  1. If a bug is found, an issue is filed with all the details
     about how to reproduce it

  2. If an envisioned solution involves reverting a commit,
     the commit author is given enough time to review it (1 week?)

  3. Core committers should be ready to take responsibility on
     the changes the propose, failing which should be considered
     for removing the "commit" privileges

In addition to the above, what it means to be a "committer" today
needs be defined on the governance page as it isn't clear by the
sole name, because currently I think what it means to be a
"committer" is simply to have the privilege of approving other
people PRs (but not your own). This should be also revistited, IMHO,
but it's better handled in a separate thread.

Hi Enzo and developers,
thanks for bringing the issue ( which has been already recently reported 
[1]) to the attention of the developer community.

Unfortunately, the possible mismatch between the current macOS version 
advertised to be downloaded on the Website and in QGIS Desktop for macOS 
users and the version actually downloaded from the Website is a 
longstanding issue not yet fixed [2].
The issue has occurred several times in recent years [3].

Regards.

Andrea

I forgot to mention that you can currently install QGIS 3.38.0 on macOS
using MacPorts:
