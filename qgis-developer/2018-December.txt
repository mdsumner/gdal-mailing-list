Cool, will do.

@Peter can you clarify what you meant by your reply regarding python? Are you suggesting I need to install the python.org package too? Do you have plans to bundle python into your QGIS.app?

Regards

Tim

Hi,

Python is already bundled in our package. The package is really standalone,
so you do not need to have anything else installed. The note about Python
is that, unfortunately, the python distribution we use ATM is not
compatible with MacOS 10.11 and 10.12. One way how to fix it is probably
use Python official distribution and not Homebrew distribution in the
process of creation of our package.

P.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] unable to build MacOS master (OpenCL)
Message-ID: <CA+T_MsKM_twfUZCciF+zJn0y34how1BppGMtr5WFB0LrwDPn=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am unable to build QGIS master after Friday's changes in opencl header.
Any idea if I can still use official MACOS CL headers or how to proceed?

Thanks.

Hi Peter,

the only change that come up to my mind is that we are now supporting also
opencl versions > 1.1,
can you please check what is the opencl version implemented on mac?

It might be necessary to add a ifdef for mac to set


#define CL_HPP_MINIMUM_OPENCL_VERSION 110
#define CL_HPP_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION 110
#define CL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION 110

as it was before the changes.

So, please try to #ifdef for mac and set

#define CL_HPP_MINIMUM_OPENCL_VERSION 120
#define CL_HPP_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION 120
#define CL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION 120

if that doesn't work, try with 110 instead of 120.

You can run an OpenCL smoke test by enabling it in the
options->acceleration and by using the hillshade renderer on a DEM raster
(also enable rendering debug log in options->rendering and you'll see in
the log is the hillshade is really using opencl).


Please let me know if this works for you.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Wrong line widths in legend when saving layout as

Message-ID: <1543840489665-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

In QGIS 3.4.2 I have problems when saving a layout as PDF: The line widths
are wrong in the PDF. When saving to all other formats the line widths are
right.

Saved as PDF:

Ah ok cool thanks for the clarification. I can confirm that the package I downloaded last night picks up the python interpreter inside the bundle nicely:

import sys
for p in sys.path:
	print(p)

What is the recommended way to install additional deps (e.g. via pip) into the bundled python environment? If we try to just directly  use the python interpreter (see below) it does not have the correct python path:

Maybe we need to bundle in pip and a tool from within QGIS to call pip (some examples were given on this mailing list in the past) from within QGIS so that the python interpreter has the correct context….this would probably be useful for windows users too?

I don't believe there's been any related changes here, unless it was

I wonder if you could download an earlier release of say 3.2.2 and
test with that to confirm?

you can get the photo used in the web page:

https://github.com/qgises/user_conf_2019_homepage/blob/master/assets/img/backgrounds/coruna.jpg

for sure the Municipality has a press release set of images, but here in
spain will be holidays for the rest of the week for the Constriturion
celebration... so I think will be hard to have feedback from them.

p.s. I'm waiting also a press release from municipality because thay asked
me and I send them a "almost" done press release.

cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Wrong line widths in legend when saving layout

Message-ID: <1543925390854-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Started by doing a very simple test project:  Test.zip
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t202356/Test.zip>  
and installed 3.2.2.

In this project I get wrong line width in pdf *both* in map and in legend
nomatter whether I use version 3.4.2, 3.2.2 or 2.18.26.

My original project still shows right line width in the map and wrong in the
legend in version 3.4.2 while it is wrong in both map and template in
version 2.18.26.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Confused by Point vs. PointZ and LineString v.
	LineStringZ
Message-ID: <CABPxTTryA4R70PS-zSCLs1XthzK3==3c417fKE+6J8XSiMraLA@mail.gmail.com>

I have been writing some code that maintains the Z dimension for vector
layers. When I create a layer from QGIS points whether it is a point or
line layer and I create the points with QgsPoint(x, y, altitude), I can do
this without using PointZ or LineStringZ layers and it maintains the Z axis.

What is the purpose of PointZ, LineStringZ, and PolygonZ? Is there a reason
I should be using them when Point, LineString, and Polygon seem to work the
same? Is there a reason I should not use the Z versions?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Question About QgsGeometry Static Functions
Message-ID: <CABPxTTq2qRueYXj=crfAW506fZ7KyjL1aDGjiRcddYoGn3uuMQ@mail.gmail.com>

QgsGeometry has the following static functions

QgsGeometry.fromPolylineXY( list of QgsPointXY)
QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolylineXY( list of QgsPointXY lists)

If I am working with QgsPoint rather than QgsPointXY there is

QgsGeometry.fromPolyline( list of QgsPoint)

However there is not a similar multi polyline function. Why not?

QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolyline( list of QgsPoint list)

What is the proper way to implement this?

Thanks!!!!

Thanks for your answers. I managed to connect with QGIS MSSQL native
provider under my Debian box with the following steps
https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/64f7733a3c4ecfe441f65d5529351a30

I have a weird behaviour. For some layers, QGIS Desktop cannot display the
features attributes : the attribute table is empty, and the identify tool
returns no feature. BUT I can see the points in my map, so QGIS can query
the geography field from the database. For some other layers, wich seems
identical (same structure for example), I can see the attributes (full
attribute table and identify OK)

Have anyone seen this behaviour before ?

Cheers
Michaël

Sounds like an issue with fetching by primary key/feature ID. Is there
any difference between the primary key setup on these tables vs the
ones which work?

Because there's been no demand for this, until now. But in general all
those fromPolylineXY etc methods should be avoided wherever possible.
They are very slow (lots of list allocations) and don't handle Z/M
dimensions.

You're better to work directly with the QGIS geometry subclasses like
QgsLineString, QgsMultiLineString instead.

This depends. I gather you mean that you can freely create geometries
with z or m dimension, regardless of whether the layer itself has
these dimensions? If so, it depends on the underlying layer type. Some
are more fussy then others, but some, (eg memory layers) will happily
accept any dimensionality without complaining.

This *can* cause issues when later converting these layers to other
formats though, so it's always best to correctly define the
dimensionality of your layer upfront.

Message-ID: <CAAJbAXvHppx8BnK4KdPznL5MsNZ7PCkjSnOYwKzt7YQ9BmU7Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list -



I've done some experiments with a dataset consisting of 440000 rows and
uploaded this to two database servers: Postgres and SQLServer. Both tables
has indexes on Primary key and the spatial column.



And then connected to both tables in QGIS. The SQL server is *3 times*
slower in retrieving the dataset than Postgres in QGIS!



And it's not SQL server's fault!! I've made the same experiment using
GeoServer as a client where Postgres is only slightly faster.



To make matters worse... In QGIS you can connect to the SQL server database
using the "Layer" > "Add Layer" > "Add Vector layer" - i.e. using the OGR
driver - to connect to the SQL Server table. This makes the retrieval of
SQL Server data nearly as fast as Postgres.



I have to conclude, that the native QGIS SQLServer driver is really, really
bad. What's the matter with this driver?



I recollect, doing the same experiment in QGIS 2.x, that a simple fetch of
SQL server data was nearly as fast as retrieving data from a comparable
Postgres database server (I’m not talking about complex spatial queries,
where Postgres blows SQL Server totally out of the water, but simple
retrieval of layer data using a MBR search)



Unfortunately, I can't just switch to the OGR driver since I have some
write issues with this driver.



What gives ???

It's probably the extra validity checks which were added. SQL Server
itself is broken by design when it comes to spatial data handling and
if it encounters an invalid geometry it will silently abort the
request and you'll be missing features from the layer. But there's *no
way* for QGIS to detect when this occurs! Accordingly QGIS takes the
"safer is better" approach and forces a validity check and make valid
step as part of the queries sent to SQL Server. This avoids the
potentially missing features, but comes at a large cost.

If you're 100% sure that your tables have no invalid geometries (and
never will have any!), you *can* switch this check off. But be
warned... if you ever introduce invalid geometries into your tables,
you'll get data loss. The setting is under the SQL Server connection's
properties -- "skip invalid geometry handling".

Let me know if this helps at all

Hi Nyall -



Thanks for taking your time answering me :-)



I've tried switching the validity check off as described. As far as I can
measure, there is no time difference with or without the validity check.
When does the validity check kick in? Writing or reading the features? Or
both?



And the validity check doesn't explain the obvious time difference between
the OGR driver and the native QGIS driver for SQL Server



However, I *will* use your explanation about SQL Server's behavior
regarding invalid geometries as an argument for my customers to switch to
Postgres instead of using SQLServer :-)

It's on read. Writing always uses a make valid call for SQL Server to
try to avoid triggering the issue.

Well, it would if OGR wasn't doing this check by default. What
platform are you connecting from? Windows or Linux?

There's also these points: https://www.pg-versus-ms.com/ (I think I
could write as much again on the spatial side of things alone.) If you
have a choice, Postgres is far superior in so many ways.

Hi Nyall -

I'm running QGIS 3.4.2 on Windows ver.10.



Have there been any other changes to the SQLServer driver besides the
validity check? (I remember vaguely something about the internal
representation of spatial objects in the driver)

I'm asking, because I've done this type of testing QGIS 2.x before where
the time difference between Postgres and SQL Server was relatively small
when doing simple MBR based searches - somewhere in the vicinity of 20%


I would happily ditch MS SQLServer forever for spatial work and mainly use
Postgres. However, my customers have a different opinion :-(

No, nothing that would explain this. Just minor bug fixing and the port to Qt 5.

I wonder if you could log the queries coming from QGIS and see if you
can identify any changes from 2.18?

Ok, I'll take a look and monitor the queries from QGIS 2 and 3 and report
back. It will take a couple of days

And thanks Nyall

Hi Nyall - Back again ..

The 3 different sql queries from QGIS.....

-- QGIS 3, native driver
SELECT [cell100_key],[geom_flade] FROM [dbo].[cells3] WHERE
[geom_flade].STIsValid() = 1 AND
[geom_flade].Filter([geometry]::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((823546.46544876880943775
6100000, 936453.53455123119056225 6100000, 936453.53455123119056225
6150000, 823546.46544876880943775 6150000, 823546.46544876880943775
6100000))',25832)) = 1

-- QGIS 3 OGR driver
select [cell100_key], [geom_flade] from [dbo].[cells3] where
[geom_flade].STIntersects(geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((823546.465448769
6100000,936453.534551231 6100000,936453.534551231 6150000,823546.465448769
6150000,823546.465448769 6100000))',25832)) = 1

-- QGIS 2, native driver
SELECT [cell100_key],[geom_flade] FROM [dbo].[cells3] where
[geom_flade].STIsValid() = 1 AND
[geom_flade].Filter([geometry]::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((826739.13043478259351104
6100000, 933260.86956521740648896 6100000, 933260.86956521740648896
6150000, 826739.13043478259351104 6150000, 826739.13043478259351104
6100000))',25832)) = 1

There is not much difference in the SQL Server execution times for the 3
queries (around 200 - 300  ms) , so that can't explain the time difference
in QGIS

QGIS 2 with native driver and QGIS 3 with ogr driver uses appr. the same
time showing the map.
QGIS 3 with native driver uses appr. twice the time to show the results on
the map.

Thanks Nyall. I think I had a misunderstanding in that the XY routines were
the preferred method to use unless you have Z/M dimensions. I will look at
changing my code.

Ok, thanks. In that case it appears as though this regression was
probably caused by the move to Qt5 or somewhere in the QGIS 3.0
refactoring (as opposed to a deliberate change)

Next things to try:

1. Download debugview
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview),
start it, and then open QGIS. Test your layer and see if there's any
relevant console output which may explain things

2. Run some little PyQGIS scripts to help narrow down where the issue
is. I.e. run these scripts on a large layer with the different
versions and time their execution:

# fetch attributes only, no geometry
req = QgsFeatureRequest().setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry)
for f in iface.activeLayer().getFeatures(req):
    pass

# fetch geometry only, no attributes
req = QgsFeatureRequest().setSubsetOfAttributes([])
for f in iface.activeLayer().getFeatures(req):
    pass

This will help determine whether the regression is in the geometry
parsing, attribute parsing, or somewhere else...

Hi Jurgen,

New packages have just landed on UbuntuGIS Unstable ppa.
Can you please rebuild your QGIS 3.4.x package that depends on that ppa?

Thanks!

Hello,

I put my request on the qgis-user list without success.
So I'm taking my chances on the developer list.

I can't find the possibility to make 'preconfigured algorithms' with 
QGIS 3.4?

Has this feature been removed?

how to do it?

Hi Alain, 

Are you refering to "processing models"? The models defined in the
processing model builder? 

I am not sure I correctly understand what "preconfigured algorithms"
mean? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Alain, 

Indeed - this feature seems to be missing in QGIS 3.x. 

Note that the whole processing tools had been completely rewritten in
QGIS 3.x and ported from Python to C++ Maybe that part hadn't been
ported over yet. 

I am cc'ing Nyall who did most of the work around the processing
refactoring. Maybe he knows more why this functionality is missing in
QGIS 3.x 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to deal with time delay in
	QgsProcessingAlgorithm?
Message-ID: <74eda2b8-87cf-8ed1-4f7c-6eb860e0e9f7@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to extend the openrouteservice API client plugin with a 
processing provider, but I run into problems implementing an error catch 
for 'Query limit exceeded' which is usually set to 40 requests/min. I 
want the plugin to be able to continue requesting when it hits that 
limit, after waiting the appropriate amount of time.

Currently I'm doing the following:

- The request is made in a 'client' module. That client module is called 
by the processing algorithms (e.g. isochrones) whose input feature 
source can have more than 40 features and likely exceed the minutely limit

- When the limit is exceeded, the 'client' module catches the HTTP error 
and invokes a time.sleep() for (60 - seconds_since_first_request) 
seconds, and then continues requesting

That freezes QGIS obviously, which is not what I want.

Any idea how to deal with this? I have no idea how to delay Python 
execution without freezing the main application..

Many thanks

Nils

By default algorithms are executed in a background thread, so I'm
surprised to hear that you're getting a freeze here. Did you change
your algorithm to prevent this background execution? How are you
launching the algorithm?

It'd take me a while to dig around and find the original
conversations, but if I recall correctly this was dropped in the lead
up to 3.0 as it was functionality which was seldom used and addressed
use cases also covered in a nicer way by the graphical modeler.

Hi Nyall,

Ok, I wasn't sure if they're being executed in another thread by default.

Then it is weird. I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary I guess. 
I'm calling the client from within the algo 
<https://github.com/nilsnolde/OSMtools/blob/345f9dce7893453baa80e22067fabdd17852e5ea/ORStools/proc/isochrones_proc.py#L164>'s 
processAlgorithm() and the client sleeps on exception here 
<https://github.com/nilsnolde/OSMtools/blob/345f9dce7893453baa80e22067fabdd17852e5ea/ORStools/core/client.py#L161>. 
But even when it's not sleeping and only requesting, it's freezing the app.

The algo from the branch in the links above works (not much else though 
atm), in case anyone wants to see it in action. There is an API key in 
that branch, so all ready to go. Will delete the key soon of course. If 
you try: best on a (single geometry) point layer with > 200 points.

Anyways, hope someone can clear up the mystery.

Thanks
Nils

Sorry, didn't really answer this. I'm launching it from the Processing 
Toolbox. Didn't try a Model or script yet.

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for your answer. I had already checked that the layers had integer
primary keys. I have discovered that the "wrong" layers had "nvarchar"
fields, instead of "varchar". We changed the types of the view fields from
nvarchar to varchar, and it solved the issue.

Cheers,
Michaël

Hi,

somehow it fixed itself.. Now, it's not freezing the app, I'm very 
pleased:) I didn't specify the output feature sink before, as I was 
still testing. So maybe that made a difference. Anyways, consider the 
question closed.

One other thing concerning styling output layers from processing 
algorithms, but I'll open another question for that. Actually I'll do it 
on Stack Exchange first.

Thanks!

Nils

Can you elaborate here? Was the issue "nvarchars" in general? Or
nvarchars used as primary keys?

Hi, 

For a presentation I want to list all existing web clients specializing
in collaboration with QGIS-Server. 

I know that there is: 

 	* QWC2: https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app
 	* Lizmap: https://www.lizmap.com/en/

but there are at least 2-3 more web clients that specialize in QGIS
server collaboration. 

There is one from eastern Europe built with Angular - I forgot the name.


And isn't there one from Italy as well? 

Can you help me fill the gaps? 

Thanks,
Andreas

The primary keys were integer only. So the issues was not caused by
nvarchar as Pkeys. The issue was with nvarchars in general. This behaviour
can be tested with ogr2ogr by converting a table into a geojson or CSV ->
you will see hieroglyphs for exported nvarchar fields.

Hi,
I have used 'requests'  library to access web resources in my plugin.
I am wondering if I should  migrate to  any QGIS core library instead ?
If yes would appreciate getting any  cheat sheet.

Hi Shiva,

there is no python core lib yet, but I often pull the
Boundles/Alessandro/Luigi's one from here:

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/lib-qgis-commons/blob/master/qgiscommons2/network/networkaccessmanager.py

For now I copy it in my plugins, but I'm very much in favour of adding
some python core/common libs to QGIS so everybody uses the same/right
way of doing http(s) stuff (meaning: using the proxy from settings etc)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.4 - QWebView: Problem loading a website
 with javascript files
Message-ID: <1544604735072-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

we have developed a Python-plugin for QGIS. This plugin loads a website and
from this site it can interacts with the QGIS map. 
Now we have the problem, since QGIS 3.4, that the website do not work,
because the javascript files in this website are not loaded (we can see this
in the developer console). This happens only on a few windows computers.
When we start QGIS 3.2, the loading is perfect, but since 3.4 the
scriptfiles aren't load.

With QGIS 3.4 the QT-Version change from 5.9.2 to 5.11 - may this be the
reason for our problem?
How can we fix this problem? Perhapse we need a new special parameter
setting for QWebView in Qt 5.11.2?

It is possible to use another browser widget in our plugin, e.g. QWebEngine? 

Any help is welcome,

Marcus

Hi 
Are there any plans on adding support for reading IFC data 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes) in QGIS? That
would help bridge the gap between the GIS/BIM/CAD worlds.

I originally posted this on the user list, but I realized that this list
might be a better match.

Hi,

IFC is the exchange format for BIMs. At this time, GDAL/OGR cannot read 
this format. Some may wonder about the need to read this format in a 
GIS, personally, I think it is an evolution of our tools for BIM/GIS 
convergence.
However, to answer the question, unless I am mistaken, it is not 
possible to read an IFC file in QGIS. However, one solution may be to 
use FreeCAD with its Arch module to open this file and export it in a 
format that can be read by QGIS, including Qgis 3D.

Is ifcopenshell.org any use in getting data into QGIS? May GDAL may use it
to convert to XML and than resort to the infrastructure used for GML (which
is unfortunately not so similar, looking to namespaces)?

Message-ID: <CAH=WbRBni4vHtW-4LV5HDub-4agVQTb=3DRcOMrRFfBv8RN2-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS users,

We have been working on a prototype for QGIS packages for macOS [1]. The
feedback we received was generally positive. Some users have reported a
number of issues. We have asked QGIS PSC and they have agreed to eventually
publish the signed packages as the official macOS packages on qgis.org.

There are a number of tickets and improvements which we'd like to do,
before incorporating it to the QGIS.org. For that, we are running a
crowd-funding campaign. More details can be found here:

https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/macos-qgis/

If you are a macOS user, please consider helping this campaign.

Regards
Saber

Hi list

I hope questions for 2.X are still OK as I am using 2.18...

If I want to get the geometry of a selected feature on the current
layer I can do:

iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry()

In a Python layer action (defined in Layer Properties dialog), is
there a similar way to get the geometry of the feature that the user
interacted with to trigger the action?  E.g. something like:

signalSourceFeature.geometry()

Thanks

I have realized it depends on what PDF-viewer I use for seeing the results.

In Adobe Reader the line widths are right, in Acroplot Matrix they are
wrong.....???

Have used Acroplt Matrix for a long time and never experienced this problem
before.

Maybe you changed the line weights option in AcroPlot Matrix. See https://www.cadzation.com/help/matrix_lineweightsnotshowing.htm

You saved my day :-)

I must accidently have hit CTRL+5 in Acroplot Matrix which I can read turns
line weights on/off.

I did not know of such an option and would never have found it!

Line widths are back :-)

Hi Marcus

I use QWebView a lot, and my JS is working fine in 3.4 on Windows. Is the
difference that mine is loading local JS files, but yours are remote? What
specific errors are you seeing in the dev tools - both the console and the
Network tab? Any errors in the QGIS log?

Tom

The plugins website https://plugins.qgis.org/ can't find the Bootstrap files (bootsrap.min.css, bootstrap-responsive.min.css, bootstrap.min.js).  It makes some parts of the webpage show up on wrong places. The same happens on all subpages.

Hello,

thanks for your support.

Yes, my website and the javascripfiles are on a remote server.
Unfortunately, I do not see any error message, no one in the dev tool and
nothing in the QGIS log.
What I see is that the script files are requested from the server, but not
loaded.

Could it be that the user agent has changed from WebView?

The only other thing I'd check (but this is not a change from 3.2 to 3.4) is
that you are using QgsNetworkAccessManager, to tolerate any upstream proxy
issues. Beyond that, you'd have to check the logs of the webserver which
holds the JS, to see what's happening there.

Tom

Message-ID: <CA+KsEp9S32dcLVpK4t2JS9ZK6dxS8T3W6=ieTW769PnUKTWh1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
i have a script which works well and changes the pre-defined symbol
QuarterCircle's color and angle :

vLayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, "myData" , "delimitedtext") #some vector layer

symbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(vLayer.geometryType())

simple_marker = QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2()
simple_marker.setShape(QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerBase.QuarterCircle )
simple_marker.setSize(6.0)

ddpAngle=QgsDataDefined( True, True, "Direction")
ddpColor= QgsDataDefined( True, True, "CASE WHEN DATA % 3 = 0 then
color_rgb( 255,0,0) WHEN DATA % 3 = 1 then  color_rgb( 0,255,0) WHEN
DATA % 3 = 2 then  color_rgb( 0,0,255) END" )
simple_marker .setDataDefinedProperty( "angle", ddpAngle)
simple_marker .setDataDefinedProperty( "color", ddpColor)

symbol.changeSymbolLayer(0,simple_marker)

vLayer.rendererV2().setSymbol(symbol)vLayer.triggerRepaint()


  Then i wanted to change the QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerBase.QuarterCircle
symbol to a user defined .svg format symbol.

symbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(vLayer.geometryType())
svg_marker = QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2( 'D:\\sample.svg' )
svg_marker.setSize(12.0)
svg_marker.setOutlineWidth(0.25)
ddpAngle=QgsDataDefined( True, True, "Direction")
ddpColor= QgsDataDefined( True, True, "CASE WHEN DATA % 3 = 0 then
color_rgb( 255,0,0) WHEN DATA % 3 = 1 then  color_rgb( 0,255,0) WHEN
DATA % 3 = 2 then  color_rgb( 0,0,255) END" )
svg_marker.setDataDefinedProperty( "angle", ddpAngle)
svg_marker.setDataDefinedProperty( "color", ddpColor)

symbol.changeSymbolLayer(0,svg_marker)

vLayer.rendererV2().setSymbol(symbol) vLayer.triggerRepaint()

for this one it changes the angle but the color part doesnt work and all
the colors are black. Can you please help me to find the problem? or  Can
you please give an example portion of code that imports an svg and modify
its color according to some data belongs to a vector layer(data defined
override)?

We had a similar issue and I first thought it's the same. However, since
you say it's remote content out solution probably does not apply to you.
I'll post it here anyway for other people following.

We had to provide paths (to local files) on windows with forward slashes
to get it to work again.

Before file://C:\some\path\index.html

After: file:///C:/some/path/index.html

Matthias

If you change this to expression to:

CASE WHEN "DATA" % 3 = 0 then  color_rgb( 255,0,0) WHEN "DATA" % 3 = 1
then  color_rgb( 0,255,0) WHEN "DATA" % 3 = 2 then  color_rgb(
0,0,255) END

does it help? (i.e. enclose the DATA column name in " )

Indeed, we are using the QNetworkAccessManager. But unfortunately we can not
find a note in the server logs. Is it possible that QT5.11 now has different
presets in the QWebSettings? 
I will continue my research ...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Sometimes qgz files opens just as a completely

Message-ID: <1544814460550-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have several times encountered that when I reopen a QGIS3 project
previously stored as a QGZ file it just shows a completely blank project
(and no kind of error messages).

I can then use 7zip to unzip the qgz file and extract a fully functional qgs
file showing my whole project as it should look  :-) 

An example of a qgz files showing a blank project is here:

Knudepunkter_ogt_påstigere_v3.qgz
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t202356/Knudepunkter_ogt_p%C3%A5stigere_v3.qgz>  

and when I unzip it with 7zip I get this fully functional qgs file:

Knudepunkter_ogt_påstigere_v3.qgs
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t202356/Knudepunkter_ogt_p%C3%A5stigere_v3.qgs>

Thank you for the suggestions. It sound like I should raise this issue at the
GDAL/OGR forum. I would like to avoid introducing the need for additional
software packages, such as FreeCAD, since that process is somewhat costly
and time consuming in our organization.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] rotating and resizing layout items (bug?)
Message-ID: <3eeb40ca-7e79-e3fc-2795-6b5ef7c08af4@terglobo.nl>

Hi!

I'm experiencing some strange behavior while working with rotated labels 
in a layout.

Put a label on my layout like this:

x: 100
y: 100
width: 30
height: 12
refPoint: center-left

When I rotate it 270 degrees, it rotates around the center, ending up at 
  x: 115, y: 115. I would expect it to rotate around the center-left 
reference point.


Now I want to display a longer text string, so I extent the label box 
length a bit (in this rotated state, I drag the top of my label a bit 
upwards). After releasing my mouse the entire label has been moved 
further left and downwards on my layout.

Exact same behaviour for picture items, so I guess it is a general 
QgsLayoutItem thing.

Not sure how this is meant to be, but this feels not very logical to me.

Should I file a bug?

Regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsSymbolButton/QgsFontButton no menu?
Message-ID: <1544870984632-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

i am currently working on fixing the inner paddings of the ToolButtons for
Symbols (QgsSymbolButton) and Fonts (QgsFontButton) on non-windows platforms
(the fontbutton for macOS has been fixed in 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8605
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8605>  ).

<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/t384296/toolbuttons_2.png> 

can somebody explain to me the rationale to have differing icon widths if
the button has no menu?

see 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/8a0a745677a8ff2c4631f451c9ed8fd7580ec220/src/gui/qgssymbolbutton.cpp#L468

i could imagine this would make sense if you could remove the arrow on the
right to make the icon wider then, but i actually found no way to do this in
c++ or python. but you can remove the menu without removing the arrow (eg
setting QgsFontButton.setMenu(None) in PyQGIS) which triggers the
alternative styling. it does not make sense but it makes the button look
weird and also ... blurry on all platforms ?!??

i would like to fix the padding and think that removing the check altogether
is fine, but i am reluctant to move on as i am new around here.

can somebody explain if there is a use case for the non-menu styling? Thanks

Jonas (iona5)

I don't think these are required, and are just remnants of code copied
originally from the color button. As you've rightly concluded, it's
not possible to use the font/symbol button widgets without the menus.

The file opens without issues on QGIS master (Linux).

Please try to rename the project using only ASCII characters and see if
that helps.

In any event, please file a ticket attaching the project files (after
checking for duplicate tickets).

Kind regards.

Tnx Paolo, but that is another bug. I'm talking about 
QgsLayoutItemLabels here, not the map labels. I mean the pieces of text 
you put on a layout, like a title.

BTW, the installPlugin()/uninstallPlugin() method works beautifully! All 
from within OSMtools (which I think is a cleaner solution, rather than 
uninstalling from ORStools).

Will be available in 2-3 weeks:)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Relations in layout reports
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+aVsYh9J2gU4n81VirMO0dhsttcL6cJHM0UCfiWFs3Ciw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to know if it is possible to draw tables for relations in a report.
Let's say you have a layer object O on which you have an atlas.
Object O can have several elements from layer E, which themselves can have
several inspection events from layer I.

Is there a native way of printing a table of inspections I for my current
object?


If not, a way would be to use javascript in an HTML frame. But can we use
QGIS expressions within javascript code? or is it within standard HTML only?

Cheers,
Denis

Me too - I have always found it strange but thought I have misunderstood
something?

I have also always wondered why the default line width is 0.26 mm and not
0.25.
I guess it is 1/10th of an inch, but since we are talking mm, why mess it up
with inches?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Any ways to avoid offsets being shown in printed
	map legend?
Message-ID: <1545073177375-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

When mapping things like bus routes it can be handy to offset routes if more
than one route uses the same road.

But I see no way to avoid the offsets also being shown in the legend off
"printed" maps (or created pdf's, png's etc).

I have just had a case, where my client says "you need to clean up those
miss-alignments in the map-legend".

I can get almost there if I hardcode the offset using "data defined
override", but this solution only corrects the Layers panel and the "Legend
panel" in print composer - It has no effect on the legend in the print
composer canvas and final printed map...

The usual (gross) approach here is to create a second, disabled copy
of the layer in the project, with symbology which you only want to
show in the legend. And then your legend uses the secondary version of
this layer.

An alternative (almost as gross) approach involves hacking around
using either a rule-based renderer or data defined symbol settings to
apply your offset ONLY when the @map_id variable is non null (and then
making sure your actual layout map items have an item id set). When
rendering occurs in the legend the @map_id will be null - so this hack
lets you detect if a item is being rendered in the legend, and you can
adjust the symbology accordingly.

Best solution: we need to implement an option to double click a legend
item and tweak the symbol used for it ONLY in that particular legend.
Aside from fixing your offsets issue, this would also allow users to
tweak the colors for symbols inside a legend (useful to get a better
visual match for how the symbol actually appears on the background map
layers), or tweaking dot/dash initial offsets to make for nicely
centered line pattern symbols inside the legend. I've scoped up this
feature previously for a client, but unfortunately the work did not
proceed... let me know if you're interested in sponsoring this feature
for a future QGIS version!

Good point -- this can't be changed till 4.0 though, as it would break
API. I've made a note of it at
https://github.com/qgis/qgis4.0_api/issues/89.

It's probably a historic thing -- maybe Gary Sherman set these
defaults back in the early days of QGIS and was using imperial sizes.

Does anyone have any good reason why we should leave this as default?
Is there something I'm missing?

Attribute tables have an option to show "Relation children" when an
atlas is set to use the parent layer from a relation. This will cause
the table to show all child related features for the current atlas
feature.

Haha - the line-width defaults. An old issue I recorded more than 5
years ago. https://issues.qgis.org/issues/7632 

But it was never painful enough in order to convince my employer to
invest in such small improvements ...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Vertex tool and cache invalidation
Message-ID: <25f0c1af-6683-8dc4-9cb9-927423526a45@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I am facing some issues with the vertex tool of 3.x.

In 2.18 the "node tool" was working by clicking first on a geometry to
select it or its vertices and then displace them. With the new "vertex
tool", there is no more first click involved and geometries are
"selected" when the mouse position is close enough.

This behaviour and ergonomic change (which I like !) implied an
implementation that needs, for descent performances, to build a cache of
geometries and maintain it.

Problems arise when a modification on a layer may trigger modifications
on others. For example when two layers have triggers in database (to
maintain a correct network topology in database for instance), or even
when the same layer is opened twice.

QGIS has no way to know that the modification of a layer can modify
another layer. So it easily leads to problems where "phantom" geometries
are still selectable but actual (modified by side effect) geometries are
not.

I introduced in a previous version a way to express "data dependencies"
between layers, with this issue in mind. For PostgreSQL databases, there
is probably also a way to circumvent this by using the LISTEN/NOTIFY
mechanism and some lines of Python.
However I find these solutions very obscure and unfriendly.

Open question: what about re-introducing the old "click first" behaviour
of the vertex tool (and probably other tools) in a next version ? Not as
a replacement, but as a possible alternative.

Hi Nyall,

I come back to the issue...

I don't see how to make a model as full as a preconfigured algorithm. 
For example, how to introduce an input layer without the end user having 
to enter it?

The case that was processed under QGIS 2.16 is a little more sophisticated.
this is an example of epizootic crisis management.

Attached an example with a project file (algo.qgs) to decompress 
directly under c:\
and an agorithm model to copy under .qgis2\processing|models and under 
\preconfigured for the algorithm.

The condition for executing the preconfigured algorithm is the selection 
of one or more points of the "avicole" layer

I don't see how to automate in the same way with the modeler?

Regards
Alain

Really fun stuff arises when you then use the arrows to increase width (in
steps of 0.2 *mm*)

Explaining somebody why you are using a linewidth of 0.46 mm, well eh....
you know:

1/10th of an inch + 0.2 mm isn't that a natural width to choose :-)

The used increments of 0.20 mm indicates by the way, that default width
should be 0.20 mm and not 0.25 mm to give nicer looking values when
incrementing like 1,0 mm and not 1.05 mm.

I would love to be able to sponsor the development, but I work in a large
company who is "engaged" with ESRI, so if I ask for funding I will just get
the answer: We already pay to Esri, so use ArcGIS :-(

And I have no knowledge on python.... 

While talking about legends in print composer I sometimes find it hard to
get it to update like if I have added a new category on a layer.

Ticking auto update will add all layers to the print composer and I almost
never show all layers in printed maps (I ususally exclude background maps
like google Maps etc.) . Normal workaround is to add the layer a second time
to the print composer legend and redoo any edits :-(

Sometimes also turning feature class count on and off does the trick

Hi,

I'm trying to compile master (QGIS server) on a fresh Debian Stretch
server box, while successfull earlier (when the box still had an
X-server), the fresh build now fails with:

In file included from ./qgis/src/core/qgsaction.cpp:24:0:
./qgis/src/core/qgsrunprocess.h:60:14: error: missing binary operator
before token "("
 #if QT_CONFIG(process)

Does this smell to a dependecy problem?
Or a make/gcc-version issues?

Thanks for any pointers.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

this looks like missing include qglobal.h .Try add "#include <QtGlobal>" at
the beginning of the file?

Cheers,
Peter

Thanks for the reply.

I tried, clean build, but same issue.

Some more info:

Debian Strech (9.6) on a server without X/Wayland (I think)

$ qmake --version
QMake version 3.0
Using Qt version 5.7.1 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

$ make --version
GNU Make 4.1
Built for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

$ gcc --version
gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516

Note that a fresh build here on my laptop (Debian Testing) just worked...

Nobody else sees this?

Regards,

Richard

Tried using make and ninja as build tools, no difference.

Found this:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21338385/what-does-the-compiler-error-missing-binary-operator-before-token-mean

But we do not have a "features.h" in our code...

This one

https://forum.qt.io/topic/27925/solved-qt_deprecated_since-gives-error-missing-binary-operator-before-token-in-qnamespace-h/5

is talking about a limits.h

which we also do not have...

Tried to remove the if else macro in qgsapplication.cpp

But then I get other build errors in other files on lines containing:

#if QT_CONFIG(process)

After reading

https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=269&t=128141

I thought that I could miss dependencies, so made sure to have installed
all stuff for stretch from INSTALL.txt

Still failing...

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

sorry for complications, I have added this macro to allow QGIS build on
iOS. I can try to compile later, but the error message suggest that the C
preprocessor macro "QT_CONFIG" is not defined. on my PC it is defined in
header qglobal.h, which should be part of QT core library. So I suspect A)
you do not have the header included (so best to include it directly) or B)
the header on the machine is old (but that would be strange that you can
compile full QGIS)

Hi Richard, Peter,

Apparently this macro has been added with Qt 5.8

We'll need to increase the minimum version Qt version for QGIS, or have
a backwards compatible solution in place.

Bests

Hi Peter,

No worries, no stress :-)
Thanks for your reply.

I do have qglobal.h, but there is no QT_CONFIG in it:

$ grep QT_CONFIG /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/QtCore/qglobal.h
$ <nothing>

Qt version too old?

Debian Strech (9.6) on a server without X/Wayland (I think)

$ qmake --version
QMake version 3.0
Using Qt version 5.7.1 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

$ make --version
GNU Make 4.1
Built for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

$ gcc --version
gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516

But it is strange, as our daily debian package builds for stretch seem
to be ok ? ...

Ah:
5.7
https://github.com/qt/qtbase/blob/5.7/src/corelib/global/qglobal.h

NO QT_CONFIG
5.8

yess

So what is the minimal Qt version we do?
Stretch should be possible to build yes?

(duh, that was some weeks ago, sorry for being late, and missing the
discussion [0])

Mmm, so meaning we cannot build master for Debian Stretch anymore (not
sure about other Debian derivatives like Ubuntu LTR's).

Unless people compile newer Qt's theirselves off course..

Isn't missing 5.7 a little too early to leave? I'm thinking on
qgisserver setups etc, not so much on Desktops, though there are a lot
of Ubuntu LTR users?

For myself I'll go back to 3.4 then....
Thanks for all replies!

Richard

Message-ID: <1FE47781-D8D4-453A-AF67-950156ADF5C3@ag99.de>

Hi,

leaving this here, because it happens just in Debug builds:

the assertion in qgsmaprenderercustompainterjob.cpp/line 73 fails on my non-retina Mac Book Air when i change the magnification by locking the scale and using the trackpad to zoom. changing magnification via the spinner-box is just fine.

the assertion check is only enabled in debug builds ( #ifndef QT_NO_DEBUG ) so i didn’t want to file a bug report, just FYI.

The rationale here is that Debian/Ubuntu LTR users should can use the
3.4 QGIS LTR release, which is arguably more suitable for those
platforms.

Dear QGIS Developers,

As a plugin developer, one may be curious to understand at what places
his/her plugin is being used/downloaded.

Does QGIS have any such tool or site where such information can be seen?
If not directly, how to access by using API (if available)?

I hope I made my requirement clear.

No, sorry but there's no such information.

There are of course raw server logs but they aren't public.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qtcreator debug issues
Message-ID: <4c599e49-11f4-c2ec-af54-d88c3813b1fd@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Currently I fail to be able to debug QGIS master in QtCreator as I did
some time ago on this same machine.

A fresh checkout compiles fine, and I can RUN it fine (both from withing
QtCreator OR just by running it from the output/bin folder).

But already several attempts to start a debug session fail during the
setup of the ui with a QtCreator dialog telling me:

The inferior stopped because it received a signal from the operating system.
Signal name: SIG33
Signal meangin: Real-time event 33

QtCreator at that time looks like:

http://duif.net/temp/crash1.png

QGIS at that time is showing the splash screen and showing "Setting up
the GUI"..

Anybody a clue?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Dear all, 

Korean QGIS users found that there is no CP949(Korean) encoding at [Export Project to DXF] menu from Ver3. That encoding was there at Ver2.x but silently disappeared from Ver3. Just curious about there was any reason around this missing. I opened a ticket about this here: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20838 If we can get the encoding back, that might be great holiday gift to Korean QGIS users. 

Have a nice and warm holiday season!

Hi Richard,

I had the same, I didn't completely dig into it, but I think an
underlying library (qca?) uses this signal for some kind of internal
communication.

I ignored it by going to Tools -> Options -> Debugger -> GDB and in
Additional Startup Commands I added

handle SIG33 pass nostop noprint

If someone has a clue why this is suddenly required, I'll be interested
in knowing.

Regards

Matthias

Thanks Matthias,

Works!

I also got a tip from Tudor that just clicking Ok, and resume debugging
(F5) untill it QGIS goes further (about 6-7 times) works....

I'll also be interested if anybody has a clue on the real issue :-)

Message-ID: <CAP=p+Yvxwb6EKuiQu0Pz32nn3fy3zgE3WewrrV43MyppKL7gRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
        I am about to release AequilibraE (the transportation modelling
plugin) for QGIS 3, but I would like to know what is the current policy on
compiled plugins.  While on QGIS 2, I was prompting the user to download
the binaries when they wanted to use the plugin, but that particular part
of the software proved to be a particular pain in the b***, and many users
reported being confused by the process.

Is the process still the same?  Is there any process I could go through to
allow that piece of software to be delivered already with its binaries?

Happy solstice and new year!!

AFAIK, nothing has changed regarding the policy of distributing compiled
libraries. The QGIS official repository can't distribute files that are not
open.

Some alternatives are:

- create your own repository to distribute the plugin including the
complide;

- add a routine to download and install the compiled libraries on the first
run of the plugin. With the consent of the user, ofc.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgqmbB2Vh4EtTM54seGzYZH4YEG4BxHKt663MB1EzCfOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

While updating the QGIS milestones on github today, I realised that
our final 2.18 release is fast approaching! This raised two questions:

1. Is it still the case that 2.18.28, to be released on 18th Jan, is
indeed the final ever 2.x release? (Or has there been discussion to
extend this?)

2. If so, I think we should do some publicity around this (e.g. a blog
post and social media push). I think it's a good time to promote a
message like "the final QGIS 2.x release is coming soon -- this is
your FINAL CHANCE to get fixes into the remaining official QGIS 2
release. blah blah blah talk to your QGIS support provider or engage
one of the commercial support providers listed on our website to
discuss your requirements... blah blah blah .... If you still have
QGIS 2.x scripts or plugins which need porting, you can also engage
one of the commercial support providers to assist with a port to the
new 3.4 LTR release. blah blah blah... The QGIS 2.18 LTR release saw
over 24 months of patch releases, with 100s of bug fixes. This was
made possible thanks to the QGIS project sponsors. Without these
organisations the LTR release would not be possible. If you rely on
QGIS in a commercial setting, we strongly encourage you to become a
QGIS project sponsor too so that we can continue to create quality LTR
releases which are supported for extended periods."

Thoughts?

thanks for raising this important point. IMHO we cannot really dismiss
2.18 until qgis server 3 is ready for production. I understand we are
very close, I'd urge server people to update us on the current situation
and needs. If this is feasible, I'd be in favour of doing a last effort
(through dedicated crowdfunding or with internal qgis resources, if
available) to get 3 ready and dismiss 2.18 as planned.

I'm not sure whether it will be acceptable for our users to release an
LTR with these regression, but this could be a way of putting pressure
on donors to help us fix them.
A big +1 for the blog post.

I confirm, only free and open source code can be distributed.
Have you evaluated the "clean" alternative, of rewriting your code in
Python, probably using Numpy/Scipy/networkx etc?
In the long run, this seems to me the more robust option.
All the best.

Yeah, a quick flick through revealed a very mixed lot -- many sound
familiar and likely have already been fixed, some I know are still
outstanding, and many waiting feedback for too long and should be just
closed.

I guess my question is (if we do delay the 2.x EOL as a result of
these) is how many regressions are "acceptable" before EOL? We'll
never get this to 0 -- there's been too many "by design" changes to
make a zero regression target feasible (See obligatory xkcd ref:
https://xkcd.com/1172/).

Big +1 to this. If I'm being blunt, I think if a bug is a blocker to
an organisation moving to 3.4, it's ultimately going to sit with them
to get it fixed (or to sponsor QGIS and support the funded bug hunts).
(Or, perhaps, in the case of regressions in features an organisation
originally funded -- it's their responsibility to put pressure on the
original developer they paid for the feature to fix it and protect it
with suitable unit tests -- but that's between them and their original
developer).

The other thing to keep in mind is that 2.18 being EOLed doesn't
equate to disabling it. Any existing setup will continue to work as it
has with 2.18.28 -- it just means there'll be no more officially
supported releases or bug fixes. But tagging it EOL and moving on
won't immediately break any existing installs overnight :)

I think a triaging would be useful here to have a more accurate picture.
Anyone willing to do it and report back?

Agreed. It's a matter of communicating properly to users. We have time
to write a blog post and circulating it well before EOL.

Jumping in the discussion to offer thoughts on the bigger picture here:
while we have a few dozen regressions filed against 3.4 LTR, it's also true
that 3.4 LTR has _countless_ fixes and refinements - not referring to new
features here - when compared to 2.18 which adds a big amount of positive
in the balance here.

Big +1 to using the near EOL of 2.X to advocate for some funding to address
the remaining regressions, and a huge -1 to the idea of extending the
lifespan of 2.18 LTR.

Beyond the feasibility issues of a zero regression target, IMHO we would
simply make ourselves and our users a disservice. Beyond the platform
improvements of (Qt5, Python3, etc.) and the above-mentioned fixes and
refinements 3.X, which users can safely embrace as of 3.4.3, the reality of
the 2.18.X branch is that the code is so divergent from master that it's
essentially "retired" code. Most of the fixes committed to master / 3.4 LTR
can't be straightforwardly backported to 2.18.X anymore. EOL for 2.18 is
simply mirroring a code reality as of the end of 2018.

Hi,

After QGIS 2.18 reaches EOL are there any plans to keep it available in a
repository or via flatpak/snap app? I have moved to QGIS 3 but I still have
to maintain QGIS 2.18 projects that are connected to Lizmap. Currently, I
switch back and forth between versions using the official repositories, but
once 2.18 reaches EOL, I'm guessing that will no longer be possible.

Cheers

I think this is a widespread issue, and a blocker for many. I think the
proper way to solve it is to get QGIS 3 sever ready for production.
How far are we from this?

I have checked them, and I see Nyall has also checked and possibly fixed
some. I agree the while several are real annoyances, possibly blocker
for some user cases, none can be seen as a release blocker.
Many need feedback, without which several can be closed.
All the best.

Hi,

sorry to be late. Can anyone point me to the issues of QGIS server
making you say it is not ready for production?

OGC tests are running every night and work fine. I see only one issue
with high priority affecting QGIS > 3.0 versions.

Cheers and happy new year!

Régis

In fact I see only 61 issues:
https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues?category_id=49
of which only 20 apply to 3.*. Régis, could you please have a look and
close the obsolete ones (there are even 6 pre 2.18)? Do you see any
blocker on the list?
So apparently it is in a good shape. The main issue therefore moves to
the clients: which ones are ready for QGIS 3? What is the expected
release time for a Q3-savy version? It would be great if at least the
most popular ones would be rady by the 2.18 EOL.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2019 OSGeo Community/Code Sprint in Minneapolis -
	May 14-17
Message-ID: <DM5PR0901MB231055E3C1F9B99C26739D7CDAB70@DM5PR0901MB2310.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all: Just a quick note to let folks know that planning is underway to host a community/code sprint in Minneapolis in May of 2019 - specifically from May 14th to the 17th. The location will be the Wilson Research Collaboration Studio on the campus of the University of Minnesota. More information can be found at:



   https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Sprint_2019



As with previous sprints this represents a great opportunity to get distributed project teams together, to collaborate across projects and to have a lot of fun. The event is still five months out and what we need now more than anything is an idea of how many sprinters we might expect. There's a spot on the wiki page to add yourself and note the likelihood of attending.



These events are not possible without the generous support of sponsors, and a number of organizations have already stepped up. We really appreciate their support of free and open source software and OSGeo in particular. They are:



  Gold Sponsor -  GeoCue (https://geocue.com/)



  Silver Sponsors - Hobu (https://hobu.co/), EOX (https://eox.at/) and TYDAC (https://www.tydac.ch/)



  Bronze Sponsors - Coordinate Solutions (http://www.coordinatesolutions.com/) and SharedGeo (https://www.sharedgeo.org/)



Interested in sponsoring? You can find more information at https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Community_Sprint_2019#Sponsoring.



See you in Minneapolis!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] osgeo4w setup automation script (and geopandas
	error)
Message-ID: <CAEDrt3-y7v1hXk95n4Ck7p5+tvWxAdBcF7sRMWgjw63GtOy8dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've made a script that automates osgeo4w setup:
https://github.com/talos-gis/osgeo4w_setup_script/blob/master/osgeo4w_setup_script.py

You may use it if you find it useful.

This script does the following:
    0. downloads the osgeo4w setup file.
    1. runs the setup with given packages list.
    2. makes an osgeo4w py3 batch file.
    3. installs additional python3 packages using pip.
    4. works for 32bit and/or 64bit setups

Some toughs from the process:
1. the --site parameter should be 'http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/' and
not 'http://download.osgeo.org' as appears on the GUI list.
2. if --site is not provided then '--quiet-mode --autoaccept' don't work
3. is there a difference between installing 'python3-pandas' osgeo4w
package and the standard 'pandas' package via pip? it looks like it
installs the same package.
4. I couldn't install 'geopandas' with pip (because fiona failedto
install), I attached the error log. anyone else could?

Hi Everybody, we have had very few answers on this extremely important
topic.

Please make it your new years vow to vote as soon as possible. I'll let
the Call for nominations link (below) open until January 9th 2019.

Meanwhile I wish everyone in the name of the whole PSC a happy new year
with a lot of contributions to QGIS :)

Ciao

Marco
