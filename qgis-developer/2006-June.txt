Has anyone managed to compile trunk qgis on Fedora core 5 yet? I'm getting
an include error. Configure went well and found gdal, qt4, grass, proj etc
fine. I've checked and ogr_api.h, ogr_spatialref.h, cpl_error.h are in the
expected place.

Its not finding your gdal/ogr headers. Do you have the gdal development
headers installed and is gdal-config in your path?

i followed the pages i found at Qgis Wiki about plugin design and got it
done. One issue i couldn't understand is no connections for OK and Cancel
button are not specified in NorthArrow plugin code plugingui.cpp/plugin.cpp.
Same i tried to do but i couldn't get desired output, connection for
pbnOK_clicked() was not formed with click button event. I. For my code i
have code that part myself. I couldn't understand this?  kindly guide me in
it.

Message-ID: <39f4276e0606042256k1173f2f4ma30dca95fa3b05c1@mail.gmail.com>

hello developers,
Currently i am trying to make use of Delimited text layer plugin on qgis
version0.7.9 installed on FC4.
As a sample file i have a file with simple text like

x,y
10,10
20,20
30,30
....

parsing is done with , and xfield and yfield gets settled.
Layer is added to lagend and extents etc. i can see  on canvas. But layer
points are no visible. Also While changing symbol or to unique legend it seg
faults with many outputs of " Warning: we support only tiny ".
As i was studying its code i found addVectorLayer() is passed "delimited" as
layer type. I couldn't find out where that "delimited to ogr" conversion is
taking place.

regards
nitin quick

Here is what remains on my private TODO for 0.8.
Hopefully someone else can do it because I'll become
home/computerless soon and I dont know when I'll be back.

Radim

========= GRASS ===========

+ missing raster maps in mapcalc GUI on Windows

+ use QgsLogger::debug/warning everywhere

+ add tr() everywhere (write a script which finds all strings without tr)

+ fix src/plugins/grass/Makefile.win (sometimes happens
   that .libs/grassplugin.dll is not compiled properly (small size)
   and recompilation does not work, necessary to remove
   .libs/grassplugin.dll and recompile)

+ add to 'Known problems' (somewhere):
    GRASS - db drivers : problems with pipe buffer on NT5.1, works on NT5.2

========= COMPOSER ========

+ feature labels scaling (PS)

+ font size - use only the sizes which corresponds to integers used in PS

+ improve map preview rendering (depends on specified resolution -> slow)

+ fix picture editing (wrong bounding box?)

+ PS output to file: rewrite page size only for non standard page sizes

I am getting the following error when trying to start a recent build  
of qgis on OS X. Does anyone recognize this:

barbaloot:~/src/qgis_stable_07/src/qgis.app/Contents/MacOS kwythers 
$ ./qgis
Qt: QApplication: Warning argv[0] == './qgis' is relative.
In order to dispatch events correctly Mac OS X may require  
applications to be run with the *full* path to the executable.
qgisapp.cpp:525: failed assertion `!myProjPixmap.isNull()'
Abort trap

Thanks for any tips.

Looks like the images for the projection icon are missing. Check to see
if the following are present in the images/themes/default/ directory:
mIconProjectionDisabled.png
mIconProjectionEnabled.png
mIconProjectionProblem.png

If not, copy them from the source directory to your install directory.

Thanks for the reply Gary.

It looks like the directory structure built a little differently. I  
have no images directory anywhere but in:

~/src/qgis_stable_07/src/images/

and themes/ is also in: ~/src/qgis_stable_07/src/, not in images/

Are you saying that I sould cp ~/src/qgis_stable_07/src/themes/ 
default to my build directory (~/src/qgis_stable_07/)?

The images should be in your installed directory - something like:

   qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/share/qgis/themes/default

Paolo,

I get the following:

Ticket #132. I get the warning messages, but they don't cause a crash, 
and have been thinking of them as harmless warnings.

Ticket #131. I have this problem, but do very little digitizing :)

Ticket #130. I have this problem, but see #131 :)

Regards

Gavin

GDAL must be compiled with GRASS support, try
gdalinfo --formats | grep GRASS

 Hi,
 
Thanks for answering. Isn't there an easy way to install gdal-grass without compiling manually? I am not used to that. I usually use the apt-get Debian command or the Synaptic utility. There seems to be some gdal utilities installed on my HD, but probably not Grass oriented. I tried r.out.gdal within Grass, but I got: "Grass plugin for gdal is missing".
 
Please help.
 
Thanks.
 
Paul

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac QCursor Problem
Message-ID: <44866E42.2070101@comcast.net>

Hello Mac users,

Does anyone who has built QGIS with Qt4 on a Mac see custom cursors for 
Identify, ZoomIn and ZoomOut? I see the default arrow cursor whenever 
QGIS tries to use a cursor based upon a XPM QPixmap.

I submitted a bug to Trolltech and they responded that it works for 
them. They sent me the example that works for them and it doesn't work 
for me.

The next step is to figure out if the bug is specific to my hardware 
configuration or is somehow related to how I build Qt. Thus, I'd like to 
know if anyone building QGIS on a Mac is seeing custom cursors where I 
am not. I do see the Pan hand but that is created as a QBitmap rather 
than a QPixmap.

Thanks for any info,
Tom

If gdal-grass deb is not in your apt repos yet, you would need to look
for it on the net. Maybe "Debian GIS"?

If it's not there too, build from source - really easy. See the README
shipped with latest gdal-grass version from http://www.gdal.org/dl/.

Hi Tom

I had to give my work PowerBook back when I left my last job and have  
just got a personal MacBook. I havent got my qgis build environment  
up and running yet - Ill get back to you on this as soon as I do.

Regards

Tim

running a find on QT comes up with nada. all other modules in the

Kirk,

This might have something to do with using (or not using) pkg-config, 
which was added earlier this year to help certain *nix distributions 
find Qt4.  Since this change, I have needed to add the following item to 
QGIS's configure:

--with-qtdir=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.3

Although pkg-config works on a Mac for *nix libraries, it doesn't 
understand frameworks and Qt is built as a framework rather than a 
traditional library by default. Consequently, pkg-config can't find it.

Also, when you get past this, you will need to edit 
$QTDIR/lib/libQtTest.la and remove or comment the line beginning

dependency_libs=

Tom

Thanks for the reply Tom. I added --with-qtdir=/usr/local/Trolltech/ 
Qt-4.1.3 to my configure script. Which now reads:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/Volumes/disk1/home1/kwythers/src/ 
qgis_stable_07 --with-\
qtdir=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.3 --with-projdir=/usr/local --with- 
sqlite3dir\
=/usr/local --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs

However, I'm still getting the same error:

./configure: line 19937: syntax error near unexpected token `QT,'
./configure: line 19937: `    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(QT, QtCore QtGui  
Qt3Support QtNetwork QtXml QtSvg QtTest >= $QT_MIN_VER)'

I checked my system and I don't seem to have pkg-config, or pkgconfig  
or pkg_config. When you say "added earlier this year", added to what?  
Should I add this to my machines? And if I do, do you think that is  
the problem, or should have the --with-qtdir to the config script  
taken care of it.

Thanks again,

Kirk

Kirk,

The use of pkg-config was added to files used by autogen to create the 
configure script around mid-March. Some discussion can be found in the 
qgis-developer archives.

I installed pkg-config 0.20 at that time and found that it didn't find 
Qt4/Mac. I didn't uninstall it afterwards so perhaps it is needed 
anyway. If so, I would consider this a bug since using the --with-qtdir 
option should eliminate the need for pkg-config.

Try installing pkg-config to see if that helps.

Tom

searchstringparser?

Thanks Tom for the tips about configure. Now that I'm past that I am  
pulling (what little) hair I have left over this one:

barbaloot:~/src/qgis_unstable kwythers$ make
make  all-recursive
Making all in src
Making all in core
bison -y  -d qgssearchstringparser.yy
qgssearchstringparser.yy:110: invalid input: ;
make[3]: *** [qgssearchstringparser.cc] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

I did the "comment out the $QTDIR/lib/libQtTest.la and remove or  
comment the line beginning dependency_libs=" step in /usr/local/ 
Trolltech/Qt-4.1.3/

The config script returned:

==========================================

GDAL/OGR      : yes (Version 1.3.0)
GEOS          : yes (Version 2.1.2)

The binary will be installed in /Users/kwythers/src/qgis_stable_07/

This may be a problem with the version of bison. I needed to upgrade to 
bison 2.1 at some point in the past year. I don't remember if it was 
before or after moving to QGIS 0.8.

With a little help from Tom, I just got 0.8 to compile on my  
powerbook this afternoon Gary. Here is what I did:

1. build and install Qt-mac-opensource-4.1.3
2. comment out the line beginning dependency_libs=  in $QTDIR/lib/ 
libQtTest.la
3. build and install pkg-config (0.2)
4. build and install a newer version of bison (2.3)
5. Build and install qgis_unstable

All I know for sure is that is starts. I'll test functionality tomorrow.

Hope this helps.

The fix for this is to remove or comment the line beginning with 
"dependency_libs=" in $QTDIR/lib/libQtTest.la.

On a Mac, the message "libtool: link: cannot find the library `' or 
unhandled argument" usually means that some unrecognized option, usually 
-F and/or -framework has been found in some .la file.

Because the flags propagate from one .la file to another, several qgis 
.la files must be deleted after fixing libQtTest.la. I believe there are 
three: libqgis_gui.la, libqgis_raster.la and I forget the third.

Also, I recommend Qt-4.1.3 as the Mac minimum since there are some 
Q3CanvasView refresh bugs and printing doesn't work at all in lower 
versions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] postgis load error on 0.8
Message-ID: <E11C2705-42A6-4AB0-9324-ADE4EFE1BE3E@umn.edu>

I am trying to load a postgis view in a a new build of 0.8 qgis. The  
error returned complains about now column being usable as a unique  
key. The error then goes on to list the columns and give discriptions  
(very useful feature by the way). However, there is a column in the  
view that is unique, and the error message declares that it is  
suitable. The column is 'gid' and is reported in the error message a  
suitable. Is this a bug?

Thanks,

Kirk


The view 'publicall_timber_data'has no column suitable for use as a  
unique key.

Qgis requires that the view has a column that can be used as a unique  
key. Such a column should be derived from a table column of type int4  
and be a primary key, have a unique constraint on it, or be a  
PostgreSQL oid column. To improve performance the column should also  
be indexed.

The view you selected has the following columns, none of which  
satisfy the above conditions:
'area' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.area' and is not suitable  
(type is numeric and does not have a suitable constraint)
'cords' derives from 'public.timber_volume.cords' and is not suitable  
(type is int4 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'county_name' derives from 'public.county.county_name' and is not  
suitable (type is varchar and does not have a suitable constraint)
'forty_name' derives from 'public.forties.forty_name' and is not  
suitable (type is varchar and does not have a suitable constraint)
'gid' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.gid' and is suitable.
'mbm' derives from 'public.timber_volume.mbm' and is not suitable  
(type is int4 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'perimeter' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.perimeter' and is not  
suitable (type is numeric and does not have a suitable constraint)
'poles' derives from 'public.timber_volume.poles' and is not suitable  
(type is int4 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'posts' derives from 'public.timber_volume.posts' and is not suitable  
(type is int4 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'range' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.range' and is not suitable  
(type is int2 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'rdir_name' derives from 'public.rdir.rdir_name' and is not suitable  
(type is varchar and does not have a suitable constraint)
'rdir_shortname' derives from 'public.rdir.rdir_shortname' and is not  
suitable (type is varchar and does not have a suitable constraint)
'section' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.section' and is not  
suitable (type is int2 and does not have a suitable constraint)
'the_geom' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.the_geom' and is not  
suitable (type is geometry and does not have a suitable constraint)
'township' derives from 'public.mn_pls_grid.township' and is not

I did not need pkg-config.

My bison version is 2.0.

Kirk,

That indeed looks like a bug. Can you submit a bug at svn.qgis.org/trac, 
and include the SQL definition of the view in question, as well as the 
public.mn_pls_grid table?

Assign the bug to g_j_m (me).

Thanks

Hi all.
I've just counted the bugs, and I could find (0.8+HEAD) 15 of them, plus 15 
defects (of course, a number more will come out, but I guess we're rather 
close). To squash them seems an approachable problem now. Unfortunately, 
activity in the SVN seems rather low at the moment. When do you imagine an 
RC1 could come out?
All the best.

Hi Paolo and qgis devs,

The qgis developer activity is usually low in (north) summer, probably even 
lower during soccer championship :-)  
Personally i would prefer to have a RC1 pretty soon. What about setting a date 
for RC1 (e.g. just before the summer holyday time in July) and make a release 
candidate even if there are some bugs left by this date? After all, the RC is 
not the release...

cheers,
Marco

Let me jump in here as well. Since Otto and me have made some sort of
improvements to the manual, we would like to encurage every dev looking
into the current SVN-manual (perhaps between 2 soccer matches ;-)

My intention is to make every dev to have a look at their
implemented part and check if the stuff described in the manual is
up-to-date.

I have worked on the GRASS-integration and added mostly all new
GRASS-related features.

What I recall now is that the new legend is not described at all. If
you could provide some details on usage I am happy to add
text/screeners to the manual.

Best regards

	Stephan

Hi Stephan,

I just updated my doc svn copy and when i run make, i got this:

! LaTeX Error: File `scrartcl.cls' not found.

and when i press return

! LaTeX Error: File `float.sty' not found.
Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name:
! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \floatstyle

l.17 \floatstyle
                {ruled}
?            

I have teTex from the ubuntu dapper repository. Do i need to install anything 
else?

Of course i will add the new legend stuff (probably next week since i will be 
away for a couple of days).

Thanks for your work anyway!

Marco

this is from the koma-package. On debian it is in 
tetex-extra: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/koma-script/scrartcl.cls

dpkg -S scrartcl.cls

again, tetex-extra is missing:
dpkg -S float.sty

Its wierd because core built ok which includes that file, and /sw/ 
include (where geos.h) is in the g++ line above. I installed geos  
from fink using apt-get.

Any ideas?

I would prefer to release RC when we get all known bugs fixed.
If we need to release something now, we should call it 'beta', I think.

Hi,

here are my notes to the docs (rev. 149):

- 3.6.3. Stopping Rendering: currently it's not possible to stop
rendering - this was disabled in qt4 port because of UI problems and
crashes

- 3.6.6. Updating the Map Display During Rendering: also not working -
AFAIK the same problem

(these problems probably could be IMO solved only by rendering in a
worker thread and that's quite a lot of work)

- 4.5.: Marco has been doing recently some work on editing support -
is the doc up-to-date?

- 6.2.: it would be good to mention that it's possible to select more
layers at once which will produce one QGIS layer with all selected
layers

- E.8.: instructions are still for Qt3

What could be added:

- some information about displaying and using attribute table for
vector layers (and the possibility to search features in table by
attributes using the SQL-like syntax)

- descibe measure tool a bit: now measures real distance on ellipsoid
(with possibility to select preferred ellipsoid in settings) and can
measure also areas


Greetings,
Martin

I'm puzzled by this as well. I would expect the -I/sw/include to be 
sufficient.

A difference between core/Makefile.am and projectionselector/Makefile.am 
is that libqgis_core_la_CXXFLAGS contains $(GEOS_CFLAGS) and 
libqgsprojectionselector_la_CXXFLAGS doesn't. An extra -I/sw/include 
from $(GEOS_CFLAGS) should be redundant but perhaps it's needed.

Another idea is to add -v which should echo the actual include path 
assembled from all the options. This may provide some insight to the 
failed search.

Although I first used fink, and later darwin-ports, when I wasn't very 
familiar with *nix, I did have to struggle with obscure path issues. 
After becoming more familiar with the *nix directory structure and build 
tools, I eventually found it simpler to directly install all additions 
or Apple-overrides into /usr/local.

I'm a die hard 'only install from source when you really have to '  
person, so its a pleasure being able to apt-get install stuff on mac  
too....

Do you know what needs to be done to make the application bundle  
'universal'? Anyway at least I should be able to make an intel  
version of QGIS for Mac available after this...

Thanks!

I think we should shoot for releasing something soon. I suggest we call it
a "Preview" similar to Radim's Windows releases or a "Prerelease". I know
we have issues on Mac and Windows platforms that are not present on Linux.
It would be good to get a "official" preview for all 3 platforms out for a
wider range of testing.

I don't care for the term "beta" anymore...

Hi Otto,

first I thought that creating a wiki page is not needed and that
mailing list is good enough for discussing this. But when looking
towards the next features (and releases), it might be good to have a
'Documentation TODO' page where developers (or users) could add some
brief notes about new features. This can enable documentation
maintainers to focus on the areas that need attention.

/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4-snapshot-20060612/bin/Designer.app/Contents/MacOS/Designer

Bus error

The first part of the crash report is:
Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x00000000

Thread 0 Crashed:

QMenuPrivate::QMacMenuPrivate::addAction(QMacMenuAction*,

and on it goes.

Am I the only one having problems with running Qt apps? (Note that I
tried 4.1.3 release first and then my last attempt was with the current
snapshot).

As Otto suggested earlier I like the idea of seting up a wiki-page
to keep track of your suggestions that we do not forget about it.

What about adding a new section 'Updates for 0.8' here[1]?

So I have added a section 'Documentation TODO for 0.8' here:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DocumentationWritersCorner#head-a9d4d2ff493caf61854143498d29a120b2d05f4d

Please feel free to improve the page so that the docs will get updated
soon for 'beta'-or-whatever-naming-release (which should definetly be
there before Septembers FOSS4G2006 conference in Lausanne :-)

Message-ID: <39f4276e0606152028y25084c38w4136e8d7cd0f2c53@mail.gmail.com>

hello everybody,
i currently working on a plugin which will dispaly points on current canvas
with points read from a fifo.Plugin implementation is done as external
plugin build tutorial. Plugin is also working. but i have problem of
flickering. As i understood the interface for plugin building, after reading
data i am calling for refresh of canvas using
mQGisIface->getMapCanvas()->refresh() . After this i receives a signal which
is renderComplete()  which is connected to render(QPainter *). It is very
similar to NorthArrow plugin functionality.reading from a fifo is done
through a thread which signal to gui thread after reading data every second.
i think i am refreshing to everydrawing refreshing is bound to happen. But
as no of elements on canvas increases it becomes very odd and ugly . I want
to avoid it. Any advices how i can improve on it a nd get rid of flickering.

thanks
quick nitin

Hi QGIS-devs (Radim),


Finally I mangaged to follow Radims Wiki-page for cross-compiling QGIS
for win under linux.
But currently I am stuck when QGIS tries to link its binaries.

Here is an error-message. Since I am not very familiar with
compiler/linker output I send it to you in order to get some usefull
help.

For me it seems that the linker is picking up the wrong libs...

Thanks for looking into this.

I configure QGIS like this

Hi

You could try bitblt ing your points onto the canvas? Which version  
of qgis is your plugin written for? 0.8 will use qcanvas as a basis  
for map canvas...

Regards

Tim

We are planning a preview release of QGIS 0.8 for this weekend. To
accomplish this, we need to tag SVN and base the release on the tagged
version. If you have outstanding commits you want included in the
preview release, please get them into SVN as soon as possible. We will
likely create the tag sometime Saturday.

We will have binaries for several Linux variants (Gavin/Tim) and Mac PPC
 (Tom). We need folks who can contribute binaries for this release for
Windows and other Linux/Unix variants. If you can help, email the list
with the platform(s) you can help with so we can coordinate to prevent
duplication of effort.

We don't have a release date but we are planning an "official" preview
release in the next few days. This marks the start of our progression
towards the final release.

This plugin hasn't been compiled for the preview version you have.

Yes, all current plugins will be included in the release.

JPGs should work, however they probably require a world file (.jpw) in
order to load properly.

QGIS has basic editing support for PostGIS and GRASS data. Shapefile
support is limited. For geoprocessing operations, you would need to use
GRASS since QGIS doesn't do many of the functions (clipping, projection,
etc) that you require. QGIS does support on-the-fly projection while
viewing data.

In our experience GRASS digitizing is fully functional, and I believe the 
easiest way to do topological digitizing.
All the best.

which other variants of debian they work with. Anyone who can test
please go ahead and send me your feed back.

Hi

I put a i386 mac  test build onto the server too:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis_0.8_testbuild_mac_i386_16062006.zip
(4.7mb to download).

I will build another copy after tagging and hopefully sorting out gdal
format support issues.

Regards

Message-ID: <20060616223217.83610.qmail@web60617.mail.yahoo.com>

Hey all,
   
  I've been playing with the 0.8 preview release and maybe I just missed it but there does not ssem to be support for rendering rasters with a user defined gradient and there also does not seem to be some sort of Grid that can be autmatically overlayed on the map, instead there just seems to be the graticule generator which is kind of tedious.
   
  Maybe I'm just missing something, if I am if somebody would let me know that would be great.  If not I'd be happy to implement these features.  Let me know!
   
  Thanks,

Hi Matthew,

python bindings are currently developed in Lib_Refactoring-Branch in
SVN, they will be probably included in QGIS 0.9 release. So far their
usage is experimental and only some classes are wrapped already -
although it's possible e.g. to load some layers and render them.

Some information can be found on this wiki page:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings

Currently wrapped classes are listed on page
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Splitting_Into_Libraries - those classes
with a checkmark. This page includes also other information about
progress happening in that branch.

So far no classes from GUI library have been wrapped. There's a small
problem that qt3 support classes are not included in PyQt4 and since
map canvas is derived from Q3CanvasView, it's not possible to wrap it.
We will need to wait until Qt4.2 comes out (probably Q3.2006) which
will bring QGraphicsView which will be native Qt4 replacement of
QCanvas.

Bye,
Martin

Hi William

Im tryng to build qgis on macbook using your graphicslibs and gislibs  
packages. However as best I can tell, one of the configure scripts is  
adding /usr/local/static/ to the lib search path. Do you have stuff  
built into /usr/local/static/ on your machine where you prepared the  
packages that perhaps hasnt made it into your packages?

Also Im curious about your xcode setup. Ive never used xcode aside  
from installing it to get my command line build environment set up.  
Is there an xcode project for qgis you could share? Does it have nice  
facilities for interactive debugging etc?

Many Thanks

Tim

I try to remember to remove that stuff from the various config  
scripts (like gdal-config).  It's certainly annoying that static  
libraries get added to those distributed config scripts.  I may have  
missed something.  Which version of my packages?  I just cleaned up a  
bunch of stuff for 3.1, including double-checking those scripts.   
Getting those online is on my list to do this morning.  Check back in  
a half hour.

Same here - just for the command line stuff.  I just call it Xcode,  
even tho I'm just using gcc and friends.  I've heard the debugging  
environment is nice, but I don't really do C programming myself, just  
porting.  I know enough to hack fixes and patches and get into  
trouble ^_^


PS. I tried building PROJ with a relative path to share/proj.  Proj  
commands, and probably other stuff like gdal, had no problem with  
that, but MapServer did.  Probably because the relative path is from  
whatever is using the library, ie bin/proj|gdal -> ../share/proj, but  
MapServer is is a completely different location (either CGI folder or  
PHP ext folder).

It could be made to work, but it would be a totally separate build.   
Better to use the PROJ_LIB var.  Does QGIS do this already?  Same for  
GDAL.

Hi

Great Ill download fresh copies of your libs and see if the problem  
is resolved. The versions referred to in the mail below are  
graphicslibs30 and gislibs30. If I recall there is a similar env var  
that can be set for gdal's search path for plugins.

Regards

Tim

I think you're right, and also for it's share/gdal stuff.  After  
poking around it seems GDAL can also deal with geotiff's share/ 
epsg_csv folder.

The key, tho (esp for Mac users), is for qgis to take care of this,  
rather than having the user set env vars somehow.  It already handles  
the GRASS etc folder - it's relative in a default GRASS build, which  
seems to work even tho the relative path based on the qgis would not  
find it (maybe that one is relative to the GRASS libraries?), but if  
it can't find it (happened to me initially) the qgis-grass plugin  
asks you for it.  So it shouldn't be to hard for qgis to handle other  
share locations.


Ooh, time to checkout the preview.

I have a Mac OS X Universal build available for 0.8 Preview 1.  As  
before, requires my Graphics Libs and GIS Libs packages.  Works on  
Tiger, possibly Panther.

http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/unixport/qgis


For those interested, here is what I do for a universal build:

- Assuming all dependencies have been built universal.  For Qt, a  
universal framework build option is built into Qt's configure.  Most  
libraries I use from my installer packages (all universal).  I just  
needed to add GSL (very similar to Qgis uni build).

- Make sure libQtTest.la has been edited to comment out the  
dependency_libs option (the framework options cause problems with  
libtool, I think).

- I have a note to add "-framework Carbon -framework QuickTime -lz - 
framework OpenGL -framework AGL" to QT_LDADD, but I don't remember  
why.  Possibly something to do with the above patch for libqttest.

- patch in the extra flags needed - can't be added to CXXFLAGS or  
LDFLAGS since they won't get added in the right place, and possibly  
duplicated.  I use BBEdit grep find-&-replace.  For all makefile.in's  
(before configure):

replace grep: --mode=compile (?s).+?\$\(C(XX)?FLAGS\)
     with: & $(CCCFLAGS)

replace grep: --mode=link (?s).+? \$\(LDFLAGS\)
     with: & $(CCCFLAGS)

replace grep: (= |if |\t)\$\(C(C|XX)\) (?s).+?\$\(C(XX)?FLAGS\)
     with: & $(CCFLAGS)

- configure.

If you use my Graphics Libs, this is needed to get my expat since  
there is no option for it in qgis configure, tho I suppose you could  
get expat from X11:

export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/baselibs/include
export CFLAGS="-O2 -I/usr/local/baselibs/include"
export CXXFLAGS="-O2 -I/usr/local/baselibs/include"
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/baselibs/lib

Use options you normally would, but the key in configure for a  
universal build is:

--disable-dependency-tracking

those extra -M_ options used for this don't work with multi-arch builds.

- setup the universal build:

export SDKROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
export CCFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -isysroot $SDKROOT"
export CCCFLAGS="-Xcompiler -arch -Xcompiler i386 -Xcompiler -arch - 
Xcompiler ppc -Xcompiler -isysroot -Xcompiler $SDKROOT"

also, some libraries in /usr/local may have linking problems with the  
Universal SDK, because the new sysroot doesn't see /usr/local.  Add a  
symlink in the SDK/usr to /usr/local.  Of course, this only works  
when those libraries are built universal.

ln -s /usr/local $SDKROOT/usr/

- Now, run make and all the universal flags will get added where  
needed.  If this could be built into the build system for Qgis  
somehow, that would be nice.


BTW, that's pretty much what I do will all my universal libraries.   
Some versions of libtool need -Xlinker instead of -Xcompiler, or both  
depending on if it's an app or library.  I have a standard set of  
these CxxxFLAGS in my bash_profile and use the appropriate ones in  
the find & replace step.  I also conditionalize any endian settings  
(ie WORDS_BIGENDIAN in config.h) on __BIG_ENDIAN__ or  
__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ (Mac OS X only macros defined by gcc).  Anything  
that uses ld directly (postgres) is trouble, and I'm stuck with a  
split build, then merge with lipo.

I hope to get some sort of detailed note about this on my site someday.


- finally, copy the Qt frameworks and libs, libpq (so you don't need  
to keep a full postgres install around) and libgsl and libgslcblas to  
the app package MacOS/lib folder.  Those are the basics if using my  
other packages, but you could copy all needed libraries into MacOS/lib.

I made this script to change all the embedded library paths to  
relative paths so the app package can be moved around.  This is just  
for everything -but- my graphics/gis libs, you'd have to add to it to  
change those.  You only need to change the paths and versions at the  
top of the script to match what you have installed.

Got this problem buidling current preview:

I have used the same configure line i used for every SVN snapshoot I 
downloaded:
./autogen.sh --with-qt-pkg-config --with-grass=/usr/local/grass-6.1.cvs/

Error from the configure process is this:

to me it seem that is looking for the grass_vect.so in /usr/grass60/

I have built the preview against latest GRASS CVS and didn't have this
problem. It must be picking up that path in configure based on something
else on your system.

I am trying hard to compile... but currently I cannot manage to link
the stuff correct.

This is my error:

I have my windows-mingw-binary-qt-installation sitting
in /home/user/win/qt4.1_win/lib (extracted from the
binary-windows-package using wine).

therefor I exort several vars before compiling:
export QT_CFLAGS="-DQT_SHARED -I/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/include
-I/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/include/QtCore
-I/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/include/QtGui

-I/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/include/QtSvg 
-I/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/include/QtSql"

export QT_LIBS="-L/home/user/win/qt4.1_win/lib -lQtNetwork -lQtSvg
-lQtXml -lQtGui -lQtSql -lQt3Support -lQtCore"

Perhaps anybody can give me a hint how to go on with this.

TIA

Yes, easy :-) 
The libs from the binary-qt-for-win are named e.g. libQtSql4.a, so in
order to make the linker find the lib-archives I created symlinks to
libQtSql.a and the linking is fine now with mingw.

Best

Ah, this must be why my GRASS raster GROUPs don't work (I was getting  
an email to the list ready to ask about it).

To properly display in GRASS, an RGB image GROUP must have a  
greyscale palette defined for each band in its COLR definition, even  
if they already are integers within 0..255, like 0:0 255:255.   
Without it you get psychadelic colors.

In Qgis they become paletted bands, like Jonathon's ERDAS bands.  All  
I get is a grey image.  Odd thing, without the COLR definitions in  
GRASS, the become Gray bands in Qgis, and it still doesn't work.

Bummer that it must wait until after 0.8.  I'll see what Jonathon  
does about a bug report and add a comment about GRASS GROUPs.

Hi Gary,

Sorry for not replying quicker, i have been away for a few days.
In my opinion the preview release is a very good idea. 
I commited some improvements for vertex editing rubberbanding after the 
tagging, but it's probably not that important that they are in the preview 
release.

cheers,
Marco

hello everybody,

I am currently using qgis0.7.9, Postgis1.1.2, GDAL1.3.1.
i have a small problem. I have a dgn file which i wanted to add to postgis.
i used the command
ogr2ogr -f "PostgreSQL" PG:dbname=mydb a.dgn to add it to database. No error
were reported.
When i tried to view this as  ADD a POSTGIS LAYER from menu , a messagebox
appears saying " Unknown Geometry Type. Column WKB_geometryin
"public"."elements" has a geometry type of GEOMETRY which qgis doesn't
support currently. Invalid Layer can't be loaded.
i will really appreaciate if someone could guide me out of this issue.

Try forcing the geometry to the appropriate type using the -nlt switch.
QGIS doesn't support the generic GEOMETRY feature type.

Notice that your INSERT statement is attempting to create a feature of
type LINESTRING.

Did you try using -nlt LINESTRING?

yes, i tried that also but it didn't worked until and  without adding option
-skipfailures.
Now command
ogr2ogr -nlt POINT -skipfailures  -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=mydb
/home/prince/mainfo_dgn/44g1
works.
but this way i can produce shape file and correspondent entry in Postgis for
element of type POINT only. For geometry type LINESTRING , POLYGOM,
MULTILINE, MULTIPOLYGON etc i have run this command separately which
resulted in several shape files and several table creation in databse for
same map.
Is this way i have to live with it. I also don't know whether dgn file i am
holding is of version 7 or 8. Also while using this qgis ( i havenot noiced
exact steps) a warning ,multiple times, occurs which results in seg fault
sometimes.
" Warning: This code (file qgsVectorLayer.cpp, line 1260) should never be
reached, problem may occur."

thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GUI Translation issues
Message-ID: <20060624112306.2448c03e@localhost>

Dear devs,

while updating the german translation of the QGIS GUI I encountered
some problems regarding to the Key-Bindungs.

an example:
Original text:
By default new la&yers added to the map should be displayed

Translates to:
Standardm??ig werden alle neuen Ebenen in der Karte angezeigt.

So there is no &y to bind the keys to, because the translated text does
not have a y in it.

What to do here?

Best

hello sir
For avoiding flickering i i reimplemented my class and inherited from
QgsMapCanvasItem.
i defined drawShape(QPainter &) in my code but it is never getting called
even after multiple call to updateCanvas().
I has studied Measure area maptool code. Where similar code is there and
same control flow do work. Can anybody advice on this issue while such thing
is happening?if there is need, i can post my code also.
regards
quick nitin

Hi,

do you call setVisible() (or show()) in your map canvas item? Because
canvas items are not shown by default.

Also you need to tell canvas the position and size of the item - this
can be done by setting mRect or by overriding updatePosition (where
you calculate the rectangle by yourself and call move() and setSize()
). Such rectangle is used by canvas to decide whether the item is
visible and should be drawn.

For more examples, here are all classes currently in QGIS code which
inherit from QgsMapCanvasItem.

QgsRubberBand - for drawing any kind of polyline or polygon
QgsVertexMarker - displays a simple icon on desired position
QgsGeorefDataPoint - marks a point and shows its coordinates (in
georeferencer plugin)
QgsGrassEditLayer - displays a pixmap (in grass plugin)

If you will still experience problems then post you code here, maybe
we could help you.

Hi Stephan,

I think the key bindings can (and should) be different in different 
translation languages.

OK, good to know. And qt4 is so smart to recognize the &-sign before the
letter and works like this then? If so, I need to correct the
keybindings in the german translation slighly.

Yes, qt uses the macro tr() to replace the translated strings so it should 
work. 
E.g. in qgisapp.cpp:
mActionFileNew= new QAction(QIcon(myIconPath+"/mActionFileNew.png"), tr("&New 
Project"), this);
mActionFileNew->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+N","New Project"));

Feel free to correct and add keybindings in the german translation as you 
think is necessary.

Greetings,
Marco

I have a few new bits of code lining up to be committed and would like
to know which branch you think they should be committed to:

1. In WMS, add the ability to set up a proxy server.

2. In the vector symbology dialog, add a tooltip to the "no fill" button
to more clearly indicate what that button does.

3. In Vertex editing, add the ability to turn snap-mode (snap the vertex
being edited to other verticies in the same layer) off.

4. In Vertex editing, when doing a mousedown to choose which geometry to
edit, the closest geometry will be selected (not just the first within
snapping range). - bugfix

5. In Vertex editing, when doing a mousedown to choose which geometry to
edit, the closest geometry will be selected (not just the first within
snapping range), then the closest vertex *on that geometry* will be
selected.  This disambiguates between the same vertex shared amongst
multiple geometries. - bugfix

6. In the PostGIS provider, restored the ability to save added and
changed geometries to pre-1.0 PostGIS servers.  This also now includes
the ability to sniff the PostGIS version.


Thanks,
Brendan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Create an "Edit" menu in QGIS menubar
Message-ID: <1151374197.2911.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi folks,

I wanted to promote an idea I've been working on in my working copy to
the subversion repository.

It's the addition of an "Edit" menu just to the right of "File" on the
menu bar.

The initial contents would be

=====================
Cut Features
Copy Features
Paste Features
---
Add Vertex
Move Vertex
Delete Vertex
---
[ ] Snap to Vertex       (checkbox)
=====================

I can think of two reasons for adding this:

1. Better familiarity for Windows users for cut/copy/paste
2. My pending addition of configurable Snap to Vertex maybe doesn't fit
anywhere else?

As usual, comments are appreciated if they are worthwhile.


Thanks
Brendan

Hi Brendan,

Nice to see you are back!
I have some comments about your recent commits:

First of all, thanks for the bugfixes in the snapping code and for making the 
postgresprovider editing code <1.0 compatible.

As far as i see, you changed the snapping code for moveVertex such that it 
uses snap to segment now instead of snap to point? In my opinion, this is a 
new feature and not a bugfix. It is pretty risky to make this in the current 
phase before the release. In this case, this new feature breaks rubber 
banding for moveVertex.
The reason for this is that snap to segment does not set the rubber band 
indexes. This was not necessary up to now, since snap to segment was only 
used for 'addVertex' and for this, the rubber band indexes are just 
vertexNumber-1 and vertexNumber+1. For 'moveVertex', rubber banding is more 
complicated, because the vertex to be moved could be the first vertex of a 
line or the first/last vertex of a polygon ring. Therefore, the indexes of 
the rubber band points are determined in QgsGeometry::closestVertex (but not 
(yet?) in QgsGeometry::closestSegmentWithContext).

> 3. In Vertex editing, add the ability to turn snap-mode (snap the vertex

At the moment, snap-mode can be turned off by setting the tolerance to 0. Ok, 
it may be not so convinient. If you plan to make a checkbox in the gui i 
suggest to do so after 0.8.

Greetings,
Marco

The new code (internally) snaps to the nearest segment first, then to
the nearest vertex on that segment.

Why?  My main hassle was in the situation where I'm modelling a street
intersection and I want to move one of the "streets" away from that
intersection, previous versions of QGIS would not allow me to choose
which street.  Fine, it would snap to the appropriate vertex
(representing the street intersection) but the street (linestring) that
that vertex belonged to was arbitrary.

I considered it a usability bug, so acted appropriately.  Perhaps I
should have lodged a bug in trac beforehand, so the bugfix-commit comes
as less of a surprise to people?

> banding for moveVertex.

My apologies.  Sometimes bugfixes cause other bugs.  Perhaps I can
attempt to restore the functionality?

I disagree that rubber banding should be handled in QgsGeometry.  I
believe it is a property of the QgsMapToolVertexEdit (seeing as it is
eye-candy to the Vertex Editing process), and really should have been
coded there.

I suggest the QgsGeometry closest segments tests should be more
generalised, without the overhead of calculating the fore- and
aft-vertex each time.

I agree though that rubberbanding does have its special cases.

Hmmm.  The problem it if you set the tolerance to 0, you can't actually
select a vertex to edit or a segment to add a vertex to any more!

Therefore there should be two settings - one to determine how far away
to search to find which segment or vertex to edit (which we already
have) and a second (new) setting to determine if we snap to existing
verticies when editing the target vertex.

I find it's a huge usability issue to not have the second setting
customisable.  Things keep snapping to nearby verticies, and (as a side
issue) each snap search causes the data provider to do a search back to
the source data (this gets expensive when it comes to say a PostGIS
provider, and certainly is not enterprise-friendly).


You'll notice I have a bit of a thing about usability (i.e. things
should "just work" with few surprises for the user), and consider
usability issues as bugs - I'm not sure if that developer body shares my
enthusiasm and therefore again invite comment.


Thanks,
Brendan

Hi Tim,

As per the theme of my previous message to this list, I see it as a
usability bug and therefore should be addressed ASAP.

The solution, in my opinion, is low-risk functionally, (though it would
destroy some screenshots in the manual).


Thanks,
Brendan

Hello Everybody,
I am currently trying to view DGN file in QGIS. On web i found dgn files
have styling information -how to color and represen the data-Color Index ,
style. These fileds i can see in QGIS also. But colors for map i am getting
randomly. Am i correct here that dgn files has color information also. Also
The same map has some text also with it which i couldn't view. That text i
can see when in legend i try to view properties and i ask it to paint
uniquely for each value.

Also i have mdb dfile for respective map. I couldn't figure out how i can
link it to the dgn map. Same with .dt2 file.

Right, this seems very usefull to me. Also, in the case of adjacent polygons 
it would be usefull to move the vertex of the polygon where the cursor is in.

> I considered it a usability bug, so acted appropriately. 

Ok, but a missing feature usually is a usability bug. Don't get me wrong, i 
appreciate the contributions very much. I just think that it is difficult for 
the release with bigger changes (e.g. snapping concept). Perhaps it would be 
good to have a release branch such that changes like this could be done in 
head (which leads us again to the 'subversion branching policy - debate' 
discussion...).

Yes, it would be much nicer to have the rubber banding just in 
QgsMapToolVertexEdit. I just don't see how to do this. I think that the 
information about the fore-and aft-vertex needs to come from QgsGeometry. 
BTW, calculating the fore- and aft-vertex is not so much overhead in the 
context of closest point/ closest segment calculation.

Ok, i agree that there is definitely a need for two settings. Again, i would 
vote for doing so not in the release version.

The question is what is for 0.8 and what is for >0.8. Maybe i'm to 
closed-minded with respect to 0.8 release?
It would be good if we could have some comments from other developers.

I'm in favour of fixing the exiting bugs in qgis and getting 0.8 done,
then moving on with what I'd call enhancements.

I think that we have a fairly large community of people who are waiting
for 0.8 to come out - shown by the regular number of people writing to the
mailing lists with queries and problems with the 0.7 series, and the
sooner we can get something for them to move to, the better.

Is it possible to obtain a position on the map ( well-known text (wkt) or

there a fonction in the Qgis API who does that??

Also, with a position in the wkt or wkb format, is it possible to zoom to

"zoomToPosition(position)" where the position is a wkt or wkb.

Thx a lot :)

Hi Mathieu,

yes this is possible in current development version (which will be
version 0.8). You can create a plugin with your custom class derived
from QgsMapCanvasTool which will handle clicks on map canvas and use
the position for any use you might want.

You can use function QgsMapCanvas::setExtent to change extent of the
map canvas. For conversion from/to wkt/wkb use class QgsGeometry.

Hi again,

sorry for the delayed answer.

I don't understand well what exactly is the problem with setting the
rectangle of the canvas item?

There are two possibilities for setting the rectangle:
- default handling - if your canvas item is a shape like polyline or
polygon (or a collection of them), you can just set mRect which will
cover the whole area they occupate. This rect is in map coordinates.
Default updatePosition() will calculate the rectangle in canvas
coordinates everytime it's needed and you don't have to care about
using move() and setSize() functions.

- custom handling - you can override updatePosition() with your own
function that will calculate position and size of the canvas item (in
canvas coordinates) manually and call move() and setSize() functions.
This is suitable for objects which don't change their position and
size with different scale (e.g. vertex markers).

It's important to have clear the difference between map (geographic)
coordinates and canvas coordinates and when are they used. Generally
map coordinates are always stored in classes like QgsPoint and
QgsRect, while canvas coordinates are stored in QPoint and QRect.

One more note on how does Qt canvas work: position and size of the
canvas item is AFAIK used only for determining whether to draw the
item. If so, drawShape is called which can draw to whole canvas and
not only the rectangle of the item. Thus coordinate [0,0] is top left
corner of the canvas, not the item.

Hi

Yes the documentation side was mainly what I was wondering  
about...Stephan how badly will it spoil your day if a new menu is  
added to the app before release?

Hooray! Can't wait to try it! Unfortunately I'm leaving to Peru
already on Sunday, therefore I have no time to give it a try.
Nevermind, after two months I'll be back and will try to port map
canvas to the new graphics view, hopefully official release of Qt4.2
will be out that time.

Also it's very likely that during the whole july and august I won't
read my mail so please don't expect replies from me during this period
:-)

Bye,
Martin

Well, not too badly. There are about 6 screenies which need to be
adjusted. I think this is doable, since 3 of them already needs to be
recreated.

So from my point of view it is OK to rebuild them.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with Windows DLLs
Message-ID: <44A55013.8040409@mrcc.com>

I've almost completed the windows build for the preview release, however
there is a recurring issue. The plugin DLLs are not linked properly and
aren't recognized as a valid qgis plugin. I had this happen once and
through an unknown combination of clean/configure/build I got back to
where they worked. Now they are broken again.

Any of you x-compiling wizards have a thought? I'm following the build
instructions on the wiki.

I know that it can happen sometimes, deleting
src/plugins/xxx/.libs/xxxplugin.dll + make -f Makefile.win install
should resolve it there must be a bug in makefiles but I dont know
where, it seems to be ok. The problem is that
src/plugins/xxx/.libs/xxxplugin.dll is created but it is corrupted.
We could simply delete that file always when make is called
but that is not clean solution.
