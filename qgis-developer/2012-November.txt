Hi Justin,

What you want to do is probably create a new renderer of different type
and replace the current renderer with the new one. You have to create it
yourself.

In the API [1] click on "Inheritance diagram" (just on the top of the
page) to see, what subclasses are available.
The you set the new renderer on the vector layer, I think that should do
the trick.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi

I have managed to change the layer renderer.
Thanks for your assistance.

In line with this, Is there any way to open a QGIS dialog (To edit layer
properties for example) from a PyQGis application?
Has anyone been able to do this?

Thanks
Justin

Hi all.
I have the impression (no benchmark data, sorry) that the command in
fTools is now (in master) much slower than some times ago: does anybody
confirm?
Thanks.

Try:
iface.showLayerProperties( mapLayer )

Sorry, I've never worked with standalone PyQGis. But I'm pretty sure
there is a way to get access to iface.

In a standalone PyQGIS application, qgis.utils.iface has no object assigned
(it is None). This makes sense because iface is an interface to a running
QGIS application and with standalone PyQGIS app there isn't one.

If you need to (e.g. to support python plugins in your application), you
can implement iface yourself (see QgisInterface class).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multilanguage plugin development
Message-ID: <50928F6D.7030304@carto.net>

Hi,

I need to make a german-only QGIS Python-Plugin dual language
(german/french). I have never done this before.

The GUI is partially defined with .ui-files, but also from within the
Python code.

My questions:

* are there existing multilanguage python plugins that I can use as a
good example?
* How can I detect from python which language the QGIS main interface is
using?
* I think for the .ui files the translation process is more or less
straightforward - but what is the best way to store multi-language ui
information if the ui is built from Python code?

Thank you for your help or examples to get started,
Andreas

you can use the tr function directly in your python code.
http://doc.qt.digia.com/stable/linguist-hellotr.html

after that, you can use Qt Linguist, if I remember well.

Hi Andreas,

I use Eric Python IDE for my plugins which takes care of my translations 
by scanning alle source files in the project for code that needs to be 
translated. You can start QtLinguist from the eric project.

I use <code>QtGui.QApplication.translate("yourContext", 
"yourTextToTranslate", None, QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8)</code> 
which is exacly what pyuic creates from QtDesigner's ui files (no idea 
if this is good but it works :)

My super old Metaedit plugin demonstrates how to do multi-lingual. I
believe we partially translated it into 2-3 languages.

As others said, changing all your Qt Strings to be wrapped with the .tr
then allows you to generate a file for Qt Linguist.

Enjoy,
Alex

Hi all.
Smart PDFs can incorporate a clickable legend, and more. See e.g.
http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Advanced_PDF_features
Any hope we could do the same for QGIS? Is this supported in Qt, or it
would need a lower leve implementation?
Thanks.

Hi

InaSAFE is also fully multilingual with an additional bit of work
because we support both nattive python (using gettext) and Qt
translations. http://inasafe.org for links to source etc.

Here is a little example of how you might implementing your own iface instance:

https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/blob/master/safe_qgis/qgis_interface.py

Though I suspect you are trying to reuse code from the QGIS
application (to show layer properties) which the above approach isnt
going to help you with.

I'd like to put an oar in from a user-end of things. If I may.

I'd love to see threading in 2.0. It seems to be something that crops up fairly frequently (e.g. "why does QGIS use only half the available CPU?" and similar). Admittedly this isn't asked as frequently as the "why isn't there a random in the New Symbology?" question but it is a question that is repeated. It certainly seems to be something that people are wanting, and if a window of opportunity exists at the moment, then perhaps it should be taken.

Secondly, when Martin's bits do get merged in would it be possible for all of us users to be reminded that 1.9/master is not stable and things will break? Mailing list and a few blogs?
I say this because I'm fairly sure there's a lot of us that use 1.9 as if it were stable (or at least as stable as the development versions that turned into 1.7 and 1.8 were) and more than normally this is about not to be the case.

The list above is really interesting and it's going to be a lot of fun working out these new bits and pieces.

-ramon.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPDh=BE9aa4xNj-=noDbQfw0ednp4KEt5_-JF8aL6gi-2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

there are several dialogs in QGIS where we have filters, for example
Expression builder, Style manager, Plugin manager etc. This is great
feature, but to remove a filter one has to erase text (select it with
mouse and press Del or using Backspace).

I think it is much better to provide small button to clear filter. So I've
implemented new widget QgsFilterLineEdit that provides lineedit with
builtin clear button. You can find screenshots here:
 - without text [0]
 - with text [1]

If there are no objections I can push code to master.

BTW, there is also similar ticket in SEXTANTE tracker [2]

Hey Alex,

No objections from me.  Was planning on doing something along those lines
in the future myself.

Sorry, too quick:it includes QGIS, but also proprietary sw, so not to be
included. Sorry for the noise.
All the best.

Somewhat related - I have some code to add simple filtering to the
browser dock.

This allows to select certain file names and/or extensions using a
simple wildcard pattern.
The filter box can be shown/hidden with a control so it doesn't
interfere with the browser dock size.

Is it worth including in master, using this new widget?

cheers
Etienne

Admittedly this isn't asked as frequently as the "why isn't there a random in the New Symbology?" question but it is a question that is repeated. It certainly seems to be something that people are wanting, and if a window of opportunity exists at the moment, then perhaps it should be taken.

How about we update the splash screen with a suitable 'this is going

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Duplicate Layer(s) - request for additional help
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_kANc5_QDCjUnSAt9-sZzgLOoLmy=A40rj+OiRMnJT-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Yesterday I added a new layer action 'Duplicate Layer(s),' based off
of some Python code from Giuseppe Sucameli [1]. It works well for
generic Vector and Raster layers. However, I have reached the edge of
my knowledge and experience with other layers from different data
providers. IMHO, while the action is useable enough to include in a
release, it currently throws an error when used on any layer it
doesn't currently support, but should support duplication of as many
layer/provider types as is reasonable.

I'm fairly busy on some other projects and am requesting that any devs
with knowledge on how to duplicate the following layer types please
add such features to the QgisApp::duplicateLayers() method [2] if you
have the inclination and time:

- Memory Layers
- Plugin Layers
- Other provider types not based off of a simple source URI and pasted
layer style

If you can help out, thanks,

Larry

Yep /me guilty too, I've been promoting using 1.9 also here in The 
Netherlands (actually to be able our national wmts services...)

Good idea! But isn't that 'too late' already? A user seeing that splash 
already installed the version breaking his eggs over his working 
version.... Or we should start showing it now already before the real 
api-breaks?

Maybe we do the warning in one of the first screens of the msi-installer 
also?

The osgeo4w does not have a possibility to warn users/upgraders is it? 
Maybe put the nightlies for osgeo4w on hold for a while?

And all qgis bloggers unite ;-) Let's all blog about this change...

Regards,

Richard

Sorry for OT.
But really I don't find any other solution in the qgis web site to resolve
my question.

I'm interesting to resolve the ticket
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6575

To do this I can fund this activity with 300 euro (payable using paypal).
I don't know if is sufficient to do this, but if someone is interesting and
think the fund is sufficient can contact me to aperi2007 at gmail.com

Regards.

Hi all.
A great success for QGIS here: almost all the presentations and lighting
talks have cited QGIS, in the first day. Apparently there is a large
number of users, both in the private and in the public sector, as well
as in the research sector, and the trend is rapidly increasing.
Tomorrow I'll try to convince them to link more closely with the
international community, I think this could be fruitful for the whole
QGIS ecosystem.
All the best.

My opinion: If you are able to disable the duplicate layer option
based on context I think it would be fine to include it in master
already.

Nice! Keep up with the feedback as it is interesting to hear - how
about making a google+ event so we can see pics etc.

I'm sure they already have something - anybody listening here?

I looked at disabling (greying) the action when an incompatible layer
was selected, but opted to allow the action to work on multiple layers
instead. I will add more helpful info to the 'unsupported layer'
dialog so users understand which layer was not duplicated and why,
until further layer support can be added.

I'll also add more checks, which won't produce a dialog, like when
only a group is selected. Also, I'll look at disabling when single
unsupported legend items are selected. It's already in master, along
with a sip binding via iface ( actionDuplicateLayer() ).

Regards,

Larry

Having just got Quantum Map going (thanks to Sourcepole/Marco), I've now been asked to collaborate with two US initiatives (GIS training & hydrological GIS) based around QGIS, & there is also the GEOSS QGIS plugin under development...

As a GIS enabling tool in non-GIS centric arenas, QGIS is having a massive global impact. 


Much kudos to Gary & all you guys for providing us such a package!! 

Thanks,

?? Brent Wood

Hi all

I have just pushed a few changes to the browser dock, some unrelated
to filtering

- changed buttons and use designer ui file
- populate items by using use canFetchMore() and fetchMore() instead
of rowCount(), this is more "standard" and less confusing code
- add directory properties right-click menu action (uses same widget
as in the browser app)

and this is related to new filter line edit

- implement wildcard + regex filter using this new widget
- add cleared() signal to QgsFilterLineEdit

A control is available to filter by unix-style wildcard (multiple
elements separated by |) or regex pattern.
The filter is hidden unless the "Filter Files" button is pressed, and
you must click enter or the filter button to activate the filter.
The new clear button can be used to clear the filter.

Please send any comments/complaints/bugs

cheers
Etienne

Great, thanks. Have you perhaps added to grass plugin modules list too?
It would be good, both for ease of use and for consistency.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange behavior with round function of the
	expression builder
Message-ID: <1351987595.47470.YahooMailNeo@web122303.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I found a strange behavior with round function of the expression builder.
When the round is done to integer, everything seems going well. However, by introducing one or more decimal places, the results begin to be strange and often appears the default value -21474836.48.
Here ([1], [2], [3]) is an example with rounding areas in labels. The problem happens starting from 2 decimal places. Doing the same with the perimeter, the problem happens starting from 5 decimal places.

The data I am using are the portuguese administrative boundaries [4], but I tested it with other data and also happens.

I'm using QGIS master (ubuntugis unstable) on Xubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Anyone confirm?

Hi all,

It would be great to tag the master branch whenever "this" comes out. This
way we will be able to compile the last "master" before the "change".

I don't think there is much merrit in this (tagging) - API is already
broken in master for quite a while and any plugins doing raster
related things are potentially affected.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Layer loading after analyses
Message-ID: <50978A83.3030007@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Preparing the way for a smooth 2.0 release, I think we should decide for
a consistent way of loading layers resulting from analyses.
Currently, different menus have at least 4 different methods:
1. popup after the analysis ("do you want to add to TOC?")
2. checkbox "Load after analysis", default No
3. checkbox "Load after analysis", default Yes
4. the dialog stays open, and a button "Load results" is activated.
I have no particular preference (perhaps a slight one towards #3), but
the current situation is confusing and annoying. Once decided, the fixes
should be quite straightforward (we [Faunalia] can do it at least for
GdalTools).
Opinions?
Thanks.

+1 for #3

It reduces the number of separate waiting times (click - wait for
analysis - click - wait for render) which I find especially annoying.

+1 for #3 from me, as that is the one that SEXTANTE uses (which
doesn't mean that it cannot be changed, of course...)

+ 1 for #3 as well. Popups are annoying to users so we should aim to always
reduce the number of those.

3. Seems also best to me. I can do it for terrain analysis and 
interpolation plugin.

Once we reach a general consensus I can scan all the menus, report
individual tickets, and start with GdalTools.
Any other opinion? I think the most troublesome would be fTools, right?
All the best.

If fTools is fully incorporated into SEXTANTE, does it make sense to
have it separated as well?. For other modules with more tailored
interfaces, I think it make sense, but not having duplicated things is
a good thing I guess, since it does not confuses users.

You may well be right. In this case, we should make sure (probably with
automatic testing, impossible to check every module by hand) they work
well in sextante before removing them from the menu.
All the best.

A first list is:

gdaltools (what is not removed)
ftools (what is not removed)
sextante (ok with solution #3)
interpolation plugin
terrain analysis plugin
heathmap plugin
grass (might be left as it is, as it has a rather different usage)
save (selection) as

check other plugins, core and not (for the non-core, we should give
guidelines or templates for this).
All the best.

And - what I already wanted to discuss at the HF in Essen - we need

Agreed, and most of these things should go in the Plugin Builder.
Could you please open a ticket on this (unsure where, however)?
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Non-analytical tools in SEXTANTE
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7y1X_NERKyOvg_=V7pGnKPWRNpoSOe2F2jnyhBAASck3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have started adding some tools in SEXTANTE that do not actually perform
analysis, but that are interesting to have there, especially to add them as
parts of a model to handle results.

The first group I am working on is tools for managing GeoServer (importing
a layer, styling a layer, telling GWC to seed it, etc) and PostGIS tools
(importing data, etc...), since at this moment they are rather useful for
me.

I would like to hear opinions about what else could be added. Putting
something in SEXTANTE does not, of course, mean removing it from where it
is now, but I guess that replicating some QGIS tools in SEXTANTE might make
them more useful, since they can be incorporated in models, scripts, run in
batch processes, etc.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Victor

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removing pymorph??
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7x6dsj+ws4R3zxstsVM6qMRZywX0djJqWc8UgjYLa34rA@mail.gmail.com>

How many people are using the pymorph algorithms in SEXTANTE? The
performance is terrible (it runs very slow also outside of SEXTANTE, with
the examples provided), and I am thinking about removing it, since I guess
not a lot of people are using it.

There is OTB for image processing stuff, and in case pymorph is
interesting, there is a library with parts c++ code, much faster in theory,
called mahotas, by the same author, which shouldn't be hard to incorporate.

If no one is against it, I will remove pymorph from SEXTANTE, since now it
is not very operative...but want to check a bit before doing it.

Regards

Victor

Hi!

+1 for #3 also.

Maybe little bit off topic. But in many cases it would be enough to save
the result as a memory layer.
I find it distracting to save all the results as a shape files when I know
that I don't need those after that phase.

These memory layers could be automatically added to toc and after that it
is also possible to save those to a disk.
I admit that with large data sets this doesn't make sense. Maybe plugins
could have an option to choose the output between memory or file.

At least it sould be possible to save also to other formats than shape.

Hi,
	I'm trying for a while now to access the Python API from a regular
python console and I'm pretty sure that the there is something wrong with
the instructions in the cookbook.

	It is said that  the pythonpath should include something like "
c:\qgispath\python", but the internal structure of QGIS changed, and there
is no such folder. I tried many folders, but python could not find
qgis.core.

	Any thoughts?


BTW, I'm working with QGIS 1.8 on Windows 7 pro 64 bits.


Thanks,
	Pedro

Lauri,

That option is the defualt in SEXTATNE, it all goes to a temp file unless
you set a filename explicitly.

Maybe, as it was suggested, that could be added to some template of
guidelines doc, so other plugins could reuse the SEXTANTE component
handling that, and behave similarly.

Regards

Victor

Hi Lauri,
              I tried that folder, as well as C:\Program Files
(x86)\QGIS\apps\qgis\python\qgis, and the answer was the same (no module
called qgis.core)...

             Any other ideas?  Could it be because I have too many things
(maybe 8 references) on my PYTHONPATH variable?

Thanks,

Hi Victor,
I'm pretty sure very few people are using it, but why removing it before
something else is available? I understand that if performances are
terrible it will not give a good impression, but it can still save some
corner case, and keep the attention on this kind of analyses, otherwise
maybe neglected.
All the best.

Hi Victor,
good to know about that. The only problem I see is with naming: finding
styling in an analytical toolbox would be unexpected, possibly confusing.
Maybe doing this in a different sextante submodule, clearly separated,
would suffice.
All the best.

-2147483648 is the min integer value, so probably
the way to round number fails somewhere.

I can see that each trailing '0' is removed, in addition
incrementing the number of decimal places the value
becomes negative:

"PM"  || '   ' || round( "PM", 6 ) || '   ' || round( "PM", 12 )

outputs

I think you meet the same question. early days i asked this question.
and finally i solved it. I
I wrote a python script to setup environment. now it can work under windows.
Can it be added to qgis installation to simple this work to others want use the qgis qpi.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial Operator in QgsExpression

Hi all,

As Martin asked me, I updated my code and implemented Spatial Operator 
in QgsExpression as NodeFunction.
You can review the code here :
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/tree/6535

I made 2 tests :
The first one with QGIS Server, I tested QgsExpression with OGC Filter 
Encoding in which there were spatial operators like BBOX, Intersects, 
Within, etc.
The second one with QGIS Desktop, I tested QgsExpression with the search 
request UI for point layer in which I wrote spatial operators like :
* bbox( $geometry, geomFromWKT( 'LINESTRING( 3.80871 43.5716, 3.93728 
43.6502)' ) )
* intersects( $geometry, geomFromWKT( 'POLYGON((3.80871 43.5716, 3.80871 
43.6502, 3.93728 43.6502, 3.80871 43.5716))' ) )
* within( $geometry, geomFromWKT( 'POLYGON((3.80871 43.5716, 3.80871 
43.6502, 3.93728 43.6502, 3.80871 43.5716))' ) )
* contains( geomFromWKT( 'POLYGON((3.80871 43.5716, 3.80871 43.6502, 
3.93728 43.6502, 3.80871 43.5716))', $geometry ) )

I only wrote some QgsExpression::NodeFunction, I made nothing in UI.

What do you think about this implementation ?

qgis is built using QT not gtkmm

have a look at any of the .ui files in src/ui using qt's designer

what exactly are you trying to do?  "adding a button" is a rather
vague statement.

Hi

The python binding for the new added QgsVectorLayer.setEditorLayout() method is missing. Without setting the editor layout it's not possible to set the edit form (it throws an error).

Hi all.
Started with phase #1: gathering information.
Notice: we currently have 28 companies listed.
Will keep you updated.
I'll leave item #5 to somebody else.
Still not found the best platform for #4 - suggestions most welcome.
All the best.

For this point, can we just add the text from:
http://www.osgeo.org/content/foundation/legal/trademark_guidelines.html
just /s/osgeo/qgis ?
In case, could those who manage the documentation add it?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all.
Is there some progress with the new, rst-based, website?
If we can put out even a very simple first page, it would be far easier
for me trying to convince somebody to help migrating the good content.
Thanks a lot.

Hi Paolo,

yesterday we have been trying to create a better template, but drowned a 
little in the (for us still) complex sphinx templating world.

The build you see here:
http://documentation.qgis.org
is current master template, but the one we want to get ready is the 
qgis2-theme branch.

Currently I think this should be the frontpage:
http://documentation.qgis.org/html/en/index.html
You can edit the text of it by editing:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/index.rst

I think english content can be edited by people already.

Translation can be done via the translation of the po files.

In my opinion mixing in the Pootle should take some love.

IF we create conflicts via the running of the pre_translate.sh script on 
the server in combi with using pootle, we have to find a solution for that.

So my conclusion:
- infrastructure is still in flux
- content can be added/changed if you want
- translation can be done (at least file-wise, via the loading of the po 
file into linguist or so)

Others, please correct me if I'm wrong

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

All the best.

I meant: QGIS website.
In this case (which I would find good), maybe better to put a stub page
(just copypasta from current home page) to show how it looks like. And
of course it would not make much sense to have a documentation subdomain.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial operators for style rules via QGIS
	Expression
Message-ID: <509A1EED.4000500@gmail.com>

Hi all,

As Martin Dobias asked me, I updated my code and implemented Spatial 
Operator in QgsExpression as NodeFunction.
You can review the code here :
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/tree/6535

This mean that it's possible to create expression for style rule with 
spatial operator. I wrote a blog post about it :
http://www.3liz.com/blog/rldhont/index.php?post/2012/11/06/Spatial-operators-in-QGIS-expression

I hope these capabilities will interesting QGIS users.

Hey Ren?-Luc,

Looks good to me. I'll leave Martin to review the code in more depth but it
is a welcome addition from me.

Hi Again,

A co-worker here works with QGIS 1.8 under Ubuntu 11.10 and I found out she
doesn't have this problem, whereas my Ubuntu 12.04 keeps having it. Does
that ring a bell to anyone?

Hi Rene,

thanks for the update, I will review your changes soon. In meanwhile please
add unit tests that involve the newly added geometry stuff and spatial
operators (tests/src/core/testqgsexpression.cpp).

Message-ID: <CAFcOn2-Bz+T=FL52bgUAcd_7x7rFk2CBpPRdceWqz9mQVyxOkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm using QGIS 1.9.90 on Windows 7 and I try to connect to a WMS
service using basic authentication served by an ArcGIS server.

When I connect to the same server using another desktop app (like
Gaia3) I have to fill out once username/pw in the connection dialog
and it works.

When I use QGIS and fill out username/pw in the WMS connection dialog,
the do a connect, I'm asked again to fill out username/pw.
Then it displays the GetCapabilities content.
Furthermore, when I continue and add this WMS to the Layer list, a
QGIS dialog asks me another time!
>From this time, I'm not asked anymore until the server get's timout
(say after 20 min.) - but again only in QGIS, not in other clients.

Is there a bug in the WMS connection which simply forgets my
credentials - even if they are displayed (and stored) in the WMS
connection dialog?

Stefan

The conclusion was that is was polyg4qgis and pLine4qgis plugins causing 
this error. Do you have either polyg4qgis or pLine4qgis installed ?

Oggetto: 	[osgeo4w-dev] gdal-MrSID and GEOS Packages updated

Folks,

I have updated the gdal-mrsid plugin package and the GEOS package today.

The gdal-mrsid update should fix the crash problem with gdal-1.9.2 that
related to changing compiler versions.  The same problem (presumably)
persists for ecw, oracle, and filegdb plugins which need to be rebuilt.

The GEOS update brings us to 3.3.5 from 3.2.something.

Best regards,

Hi all,

Please excuse if these are really dumb questions, but git and sphinx/ReST are things I have little experience with.

If I'm setting about updating the section of the user manual that I'd done in 1.7 for 1.8 I need to 
1. checkout the source with git from github.
 1a. Do I need to sign up to github?
2. make my changes.
 2a. (probably I should make a branch on my local copy, do my changes there, check it works then merge back to my local master)
3. and "push"? them back.

Is that roughly right?

-ramon.

In the current master version, the modeler folder should default to a
folder in the user folder. It seems that it is trying to create the folder
where the example models are. Probably you have a different setting for you
models folder? change it in the sextante_qgis.conf file in your sextante
folder (in your user dir), and see if it works.


sorry for all this problems with the models and scripts folders...

Hi

i was going to add the names of some people that have contributed patches
and code to SEXTANTE, but found out that the "About SEXTANTE" menu had been
removed. I think it is a good idea (Alex did it, and I completely agree
with that...) but I would like to give credit to the people creating
SEXTANTE...myself among them :-)

Where is the best place to put that? in the QGIS about box? in
"Developers"? in "contributors"?

Thanks!

Victor

Why not just edit it properly using designer on Linux - the chances of
making a mess when pasting snippets into a ui xml file are probably
100:1....

Hi Victor,

you already added to Developers tab in QGIS about dialog. Unfortunatelly I have
no idea where all other contributors should be listed. Maybe in Contributors tab
in same dialog

Hi

Core QGIS committers (those with write access to our master git repo)
should be added to doc/AUTHORS
Any other contributors should be added to doc/CONTRIBUTORS

If you do above, they will appear in the help->about dialog along

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin builder quantumgis
Message-ID: <CABH8U5kckEFpDdaUQ3SPbRHaiGgsReiyqertzg3kmFcX7pVUhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I'm writing because of a problem I'm facing regarding quantumgis plugin
builder.
First of all, I'm working on windows 7.
Followed the instruction on the link

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/plugins.html

More precisely on the bottom of the page:
Remark: Configuring Your IDE on Windows

Installed quantumgis using the OsGeo4w release, pyscripter and the plugin
buider.

After running the plugin builder, an image shows up telling us what to do.

The problem is that i don't even have a clue on what this means.

Compile the ui file using pyuic4
Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

Sorry for my ignorance but I'm trying to initiate my self on quantumgis
python development and I'm completely stuck here.

Thanks in advance

You need to install "Make for Windows",
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm.  Once "Make for Windows"
is installed, you will be able to use the make file by opening the command
line, navigate to your plugin folder and then issue the make command.  There
is a very good tutorial at
http://www.qgisworkshop.org/html/workshop/index.html, although the tutorial
is using a Linux virtual machine.  If you are considering developing GUI you
may also want to install PyQt at
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download.

Btw, I haven't been able to find sextante_qgis.conf anywhere on my system.

I have pushed a few changes, among them a fix to handle missing examples
folder.

However, all example folders should appear now, and the scripts examples
folder should in fact contain an example script (I plan to add more...)

Hope this helps...and that i have done it write with the CMake files this
time :-) I would be great if someone more experienced with CMake could
check that in case there are still problems related to that....

Thanks!

I like the look at http://www.bidforfix.com. Looks pretty simple from a
users point of view.  I think kickstarter and indeigogo are more for full
projects rather then just bug fixes/features.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS X - QGIS 1.8 and QGIS nightly builds -
 cursor keys not working in "Open Attribute Table Grid"
Message-ID: <CADs9uc8B+SfqEku-EZr7VpxEfB071QTTErEjSKkzFTUKnNQWUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have not been using QGIS lately, but 2 days ago, I started to use
again trying to do some thematic mapping from my Mixed Integer
Programming (MIP) model so the result can be viewed spatially.

I noticed that I can not use the cursor keys to move back and forth,
left to right of the Attribute Table Grid in QGIS 1.8.0. I also
download the latest QGIS nightly build and I also encountered the same
problem (i.e. cursor keys not working in the Grid). However, in
Properties -> Fields, the up and down cursor keys are working.

Anybody has the same experience with the cursor keys in "Attribute
Table Grid" in Mac OS X (10.8)?

I am using the Macbookpro retina (the classic model - entry level - i7 2.3 Ghz).

What is the difference between the 'Atttibute Table Grid" and the
"Field Grid" in Properties?

I think something wrong with the "Attribute Table Grid" codes or
component in Mac OS X, if there is no problem in Windows 7 and Linux.

(I am not using Windows 7 and Linux for QGIS 1.8.0 and above).

Thanks.

Noli

Message-ID: <1352540085054-5015319.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 

For the first time, I have a problem on Snow Leopard: the sextante plugin
does not work with a class factory error in 
"....
 File
"/Volumes/QGIS_Apps/QGIS_2.0-dev_SnoLeo.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/sextante/script/ScriptAlgorithmProvider.py",
line 74, in loadFromFolder
    for descriptionFile in os.listdir(folder):
   OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/Volumes/QGIS_Apps/QGIS_2.0-dev_SnoLeo.app  
/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/sextante/*script/scripts*'

If I try, in the Python console:
        >>> from sextante.SextantePlugin import SextantePlugin
the result is:

".......
File
"/Applications/QGIS_Apps/QGIS_2.0-dev_SnoLeo.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/sextante/admintools/geoserver/store.py",
line 1, in <module>
    import sextante.admintools.geoserver.workspace as ws
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'geoserver'"


If I look, I see that there is a folder
"/Applications/QGIS_Apps/QGIS_2.0-dev_SnoLeo.app/Contents/Resources/python/plugins/sextante/admintools"
not present in the 70fc8ca version

but the very strange thing is if I continue in the console :
        >>> import sextante.admintools.geoserver
        >>> import sextante.admintools.geoserver.workspace
no problem but
        >>> import sextante.admintools.geoserver.workspace as ws
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'geoserver'

Thanks

It appears broken because it asks for a module (qgswps) not present.
Anyone confirms?

Hi Devs,

I just compiled master here, and had a look at the new scintilla2 based 
python console.

Really really cool!!!

Thanks so much!

One little wish: I really like the help. But it is a fixed modal dialog, 
what about a floating non modal dialog for that?

Regards,

Danke Bernd.
Frankly I will not have the time to install yet another piece of the
already very complex QGIS infrastructure, but will not oppose if
somebody will, with some good reasons.

I would vote against having to setup and run our own system.  This kind of
stuff IMO is best left to people who know what they are doing and have the

+1 - we shouldn't invest time/resources in such stuff which are not
central to QGIS. Such services exist out there and we should use them.

Hi Salvatore,

maybe wait a little before serving me :-)

if I'm correct there will be some initiative to harmonize all the 
different types of help buttons/dialogs and methods to create and show 
them. So QGIS has a more consistent way of serving/giving help :-)

Eg. the choice for bootstrap for the documentation gives us the 
'responsive design' stuff, so the docs/help does easily fit into smaller 
dialogs or even sidebars.

Thanks for the console work!

Richard

Found it!  Although I had cleaned up previous qgis installations (both using 
make install as well packages isntalled using checkinstall), I did not clean 
up the ~/.qgis/python/plugins directory (installed under K-Ubuntu 12.04).

It works fine now after removing the "old" plugins directory, re-compiling and 
installing.

Thanks and apologies for the traffic,
Nikos

 Thank so much, tomorrow I will be training people on QGIS for 4 days so
probably I may be busy this week. I will download the file according to
your instructions and work on it. I have colleagues who would love to be
part of the team.****

Thanks again for your warm welcome. QGIS is the GIS program mostly used in
this side of the world.****

Thanks for the update. I went through the code and things look good. I have
only one concern: QgsGeometry instances stored in QVariant do not seem to
be released... When "$geometry" is used, then it's returning the instance
from the feature (which should not be deleted), but temporary geometries
constructed from wkt/gml must be deleted.

Maybe we should store directly QgsGeometry object instead of just a pointer
inside?

Regards
Martin

Thanks Ed.

had a few other problems such as an error that stated something like no
resources_rc module.
Tried out a few things and at the end changed the file resources.py to
resoruces_rc.py and everything seems to be running smoothly...
Is this normal? Am I doing something completely non sense?

Thanks,

Filipe

Hi all and sorry for crossposting,

starting from 15004f40f0 SEXTANTE stores its settings and user models/scripts
under sextante directory in ~/.qgis. If you want to keep your existing settings,
move your old settings directory (~/sextante by default) to new location.
Otherwise SEXTANTE will be started with default configuration.

Bear with me if this is a trivial request.
QgsRubberBand only supports lines and polygons, why don't we extend it to
support points/multipoints too?

Hi Martin,

I made the update. QgsGeometry object is directly stored.

I also updated the list of NodeFunction :
* buffer
* intersection
* distance
* exportToWKT
* and other geometruc method
I also add test.

Message-ID: <50A1495C.2000506@carto.net>

Hi QGIS Devs,

For a course for Geomatics apprentices in Zurich we are preparing a
summary of the QGIS history. Does anybody know when Python scripting was
added to QGIS (which version / which year).

Another question: who was the first major user of QGIS and when? I would
guess Kanton Solothurn - but what year? 2005? 2006?

What major QGIS users do we have?

Thank you for your help!

Andreas

as I can see from git logs, Python support was added in QGIS 0.9 ?Ganymede?

Let me clarify my request a bit more. I know QgsRubberBand can manage
points and paint them as square graphics.
What I mean is painting circles (drawEllipse).

Hi All,

The new WMT-S client function is great. However I've noticed that the quality of tiles rendered on the screen is not very good. I know it can never be as good as vector layers served up via WMS, but it should be much better.

Is bi-linear resampling occuring on the returned tiles before they are rendered to the screen?

Cheers
Jeremy

Hi All


We have been doing a bit of research for the trip to Latvia and it looks
like I wont be able to make it - the availability of airlines and flight
schedules  make the travel time around 2 days for me each way. While I am
not suggesting that the venue should be changed for me, I'm mentioning it
here so that others planning to attend can check now already to see if they
are able to make it and we can know well ahead of time if there is likely
to be a poor turnout due to travel complications.

Regards

Tim

No direct flight from here for me, but it's around 5 hours to Riga with one
stop (250?). Means almost spending one day to get there and another to come
back, but it's not bad. Not better than most places, I guess.

Not having Tim in the hackfest is bad news, though :-(

It depends from your starting point. Week ago I travelled to Madrid 
(Riga-Stocholm-Madrid-Bergamo-Riga), one stop with Ryanair (~9h in one 
direction).
I bought the tickets one week before and all together approx 210eur.
Probably at spring will be renewed direct flights Riga Madrid by 
airBaltic, but not guaranteed.

	the vector layer
Message-ID: <CAHpmJtJ1fniSYN21HWp688fbS12K1UZJuT3djt03Yuv4eV8Qxw@mail.gmail.com>

hello everyone;

i am using QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsPolygonItem, QGraphicsLineItem,
QGraphicsEllipseItem and QGraphicsTextItem
to draw my own customized symbols, polygons or circles on top of my vector
layer.
just have a look at the attached screen shot to have a complete idea for
what am doing;

i dont think i can add my graphic scene widget on top of my map canvas and
even if i was able to am trying to draw these symbols on top of a vector
layer
 to be able to adjust the symbols' location in case i triggered zoom in,
out or pan;
i dont want the symbols to be separated from my vector layer since ill be
drawing my symbols according to specific coordinates on my raster layer
which is my map;

so any idea how can i do that ?

Is there a reason you want to do custom drawing of symbols and not use
something like a line marker symbol with it set for each vertex?

There is also this
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#index-13but I would
advice to use the mark line symbol first.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removing SEXTANTE context help
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xHYY8td9K_T0EWXNAGOkX75xV=Ar-szR15UN-64GjVKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am thinking about removing the SEXTANTE help menu and the button on
top of the toolbox that takes you to the process provider
documentation (that is, how to configure external algorithms)

They both refer to html pages which are now in the manual, so,
although it is handy and I guess it helps users make correct use of
SEXTANTE, it doesn't make too much sense. Better to remove them and
encourage people to read the manual and learn how to use SEXTANTE.

I would like to hear your opinion on this.

Thanks in advance!

Victor

Hi there!

Anyone seen the new GRASS Webpage?
I really like the clean and intuitive style with lots of information
presented clearly on the top page ..
Probably we can adapt it to "our" new webpage?
It even looks good on mobile phones ..

Opinions on that?

kind regards
Werner

Hi

Yes I have seen it. With no disrespect to the GRASS folks I think it has
enough problems that I would not like to copy it on our site. My
(hopefully) constructive criticisms:

* its very busy
* it doesnt have good whitespace balance e.g. module of the day box with
screenshots box floating to the right
* I love jquery but jquery css is looking old already
* there are too many underlines [ ] >> > and other characters that distract
attention and make it look not so friendly
* the panels on the left (search, latest news, map) should have been put to
the right
* there is too much white space in the heading area
* the logo really needs a refresh
* the heavy green bars distract your eye away from the content
* there are too many different font sizes and font styles
* the drop down menus feel visually disconnected from the tabs the spring
from and menus from tabs just feels kinda wierd

In short it could really use a designer to introduce balance, correct
emphasis and remove distractions

As such I would not be supportive of using it for our site I suggest to
wait for the sphinx theme based on bootstrap to come out and then start
moving our web content into that. We will do some customisations for the
QGIS front page and Richard has been making awesome progress in getting a
well put together bootstrap based sphinx theme in place for us when we can
then skin using any bootstrap theme (e.g. checkout some of the themes at
http://bootswatch.com/).

So -1 from me

Regards

Tim

Sadly, I must agree with Tim.
Sadly because I know the effort made by the GRASS team to have the new site
out, but I cannot object Tim's points...

PS: @Tim, I wasn't aware of the ongoing work to switch to a boostrap based
sphinx theme. What are you using for it?

Given what the prior website looked like, it is a vast improvement. Nonetheless, I think Tim's points are spot on, especially regarding balancing white space, use of green, and the drop-down/tab disconnect (the tabs themselves look disconnected to me, and the grey shade for the active tab makes it look inactive from expected gui practices).

Nonetheless, I congratulate the GRASS team for greatly improving from what they had. I don't think QGIS should strive to replicate this look, though.

Cheers,
John

It is a hand rolled theme - at the moment it just uses the default
blueprint look. Richard Duivenvoode has been doing the heavy lifting on
this:

Once the major documentation overhaul is done I was going to table the idea
of dropping our current awkward context help system  (actually there are at
least three systems in place at the moment) in place of shippng the sphinx
docs with qgis and using a browser control to dive into the correct place
in the docs when help is requested. This will be another step further in
unifying docs so there is only one place they need to be managed /
translated etc.

However I doubt this will happen in 2.0....but when it does you will be in
a good position already since you can just point to your sphinx docs....

Tim

I like to see a preview on this theme (i.e. screenshot).

I think the new GRASS site is designed to be viewable in mobile
devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets).

Please note this is a work in progress - Richard runs a dev copy here:

http://www.duif.net/en/

It is planned to use a 'hero box' style front page which has not been built
yet.

Yes the new QGIS one too (a major reason for using bootstrap). In fact with
this theme the images scale as you resize the browser window (or try it on
your smarphone on a page with images). For example try this page

http://www.duif.net/en/gentle_gis_introduction/02_vector_data.html

and resize your browser window to make it narrow and watch how the images
resize and the content adjusts itself.

I like bootsrap too and jQuery. I hate  ExtJS.

Brian [1] has bootstrap for Leaflet for Leaflet Users.

http://users.leafletjs.com/

Of course, it needs to be resized if we decided to use it for QGIS
Users map. GeoDjango, I think works with Leaflet.

Greetings,

Speaking of website improvement, I've just dropped in a proposal for a
refined - and more importantly _vector-based_ - QGIS logo here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6688

I've tried to stick to the original logo as much as possible as clearly
many people are emotionally attached to the current logo. Hopefully, the
proposal also refines the logo with more subtle lightning.

Having QGIS' website use _one_ standard logo throughout (i.e. header logo,
download button logo, etc.) would already be a nice improvement.

Hope this can be of use to the project.

Cheers,

Math

I agree with this. As another alternative we can remove docs and
force buttons to open online docs.

Agreed, an important improvement IMHO.
If anybody had time to speed this up, please do it.
I can give a hand if someone takes the lead.
All the best.

Concerning the logo, could we have a definitive and community-based poll or 
contest on the 2.0 version logo ?

I know the current one has supporters, and it has been there for a long time, 
charged with emotion and all. I like it for that reason too, but it is 
definitly not professional neither modern-looking. 
I get this remark quite often during training session, and it is quite sad for 
the QGIS ?branding? as a professionnal and serious tool.

Vincent

I had plans on running a logo contest before we roll out 2.0.  Maybe now is
a good time. I have had a few people who have said they will put in some
money to aid in that kind of project.

I don't think we need a whole new logo, but a revamp would be good IMO.

Vincent,

Re modern-looking and professional, the above proposal tries to improve the
situation there. I believe it does so successfully, but then again it's my
subjective opinion :)

I think the "not professional" might be in big part due to the absence of
high resolution versions of the logo to be used for launcher icons and
documentation (see
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/doc/manual/qgis-1.7.0_user_guide_en.pdf).
The fact that the proposal is vector-based allows ppl to blow up the logo
to very large scales for training session posters, be used on t-shirts,
etc. I think that should help improve QGIS' branding / image.

Also, the proposal isn't one that pushes for a revolution, just an
incremental refinement so that there can be a easily reachable agreement on
using it to improve situation quickly (especially needed for better linux
integration, see screenshots attached to the issue). A completely new logo
might still be desirable down the road, that ain't for me to decide :)

I think it's reasonable to introduce such a thing. QgsRubberBand is used
for temporary highlighting / painting of features and I see no reason
why this should not be allowed for points. I would also have use for
that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remaining work to get rid of old labeling?
Message-ID: <50A36425.5020100@carto.net>

Hi Larry, Hi all,

At the Essen developer meeting we discussed that we want to get rid of
the double versions (labeling, symbology, diagrams - more?)

The new diagram are now in good shape thanks to the work of Matthias
Kuhn and Marco Hugentobler.

I now that Larry did a tremendous amount of work on the new label
engine, next to the work Marco H. and Martin Dobias did before.

I don't have the exact overview what features from the old engine are
not yet present in the new engine.

In Essen we proposed that we ask Larry to continue his work to get rid
of the old label engine - and we proposed that we would pay a certain
amount of our funds to Larry for this work.

Question to Larry and the PSC? What is the status of this work? Was
there any agreement so far between the PSC and Larry to fund his work?
Larry - would you have time to continue working on it so we can get rid
of the old labeling?

Thanks for an update on it.

Andreas

I'm not aware of any progress or decision on this.
I think we should have an update on all the blocking tasks, to have a
global picture.
All the best, and thanks for raising this up.

Hi

My 2c - I really like Mathieu's evolutionary proposal. At the same time
running a contest to see what other ideas we can shake out of the trees
seems like a good idea (just be sure to include Mathieu's proposal too!).
Now would definately be a good time to run such a contest.

Regards

Tim

Hi all,

There is a vector version of the current logo in our github repository:
https://raw.github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/master/images/icons/qgis_icon.svg

It is just not very well-known. And probably not widely used.

Btw: it sucks that github does not know about the SVG mime-type. How
long is SVG now around (since 2000 or so) - and they still don't know
the SVG mime-type?

So you have to download it and open it in any browser, Inkscape or other
graphic software.

--------------

In the whole discussion around the logo - people complain that the
current logo is not professionally looking. The question is:

* What exactly is not professionally looking about the current logo?
please be precise about it - no general complaints without concrete
proposals and criticism.

* Are other logos professionally looking? The ESRI logo as an example
looks like a 5 year old kid did it ..

* Who decides what professionally looking means and what are the criteria?

* How important is the brand recognition from the old logo?

Opinions?

Andreas

I agree that Mathieus' proposal is an improvement and doesn't radically
change things (keeps brand recognigion). It is better legible than the
previous version of the logo.

But the more important thing is that people should start using SVG icons
instead of PNG icons in their toolbars, GUI, etc. - for my own inhouse
Python plugins I tend to use SVG icons. The other benefit you'll get is
that at the same time you'll have editable versions in your repos,
without having to keep multiple separate files.

Think about all the new high-res displays. Rasterized versions will
never do the job, even with multires rasters. Use the SVG versions
instead and you can scale to any size.

QT supports SVG icons - so why not using them everywhere?

----------

BTW: the same applies to QGIS webclient - the other project I am working
on. When IE8 is not around anymore, I will start to replace all these
raster icons with SVG versions of the icons. IE 7 and 8 are the only
blockers here.

+1 from me it would be good to use them for our toolbars etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multicolumn legends in print composer
Message-ID: <50A36E51.1010806@carto.net>

Hi,

Thanks to Radim we now have multi-column legends in print composer. This
was one of my long-time feature requests - but it never got to the top
of my requests so that we could pay for the work.

Generally it works great, but I noticed two strange behaviors:

* when having only one column (default) - the background rectangle is
way too small, not covering the full bouding box of the legend
* when going beyong 4 columns, QGIS gets really slow, hangs or crashes.

Did other test the new multicolumn legends?

Thanks Radim for your work!

Andreas

Andreas,

Thanks for pointing out the SVG. It's however, and strangely : ), not the
vector version of the most wildly used iteration of the QGIS logo (that is
http://qgis.org/templates/qgis/images/blue/logo.png). The latter is used
for the application shortcut / launcher, the website header's logo, etc.

Allow me to try and answer - based on the concrete proposal referred to in
this thread - some of the questions you've raised, while recognizing that
ultimately, art is fundamentally subjective.

** What exactly is not professionally looking about the current logo?
please be precise about it - no general complaints without concrete
proposals and criticism.*
First, I think that the complaints surrounding lack of professionally
looking logo / brand for QGIS is due to two main factors:
i) the presence, in all aspects of the QGIS project, of several logos that
are all slightly different from each other (look at qgis.org's homepage,
two different logos within 10 cm of one another); and more importantly
ii) the absence of high resolution raster logos used throughout the QGIS
project (from user manual, to application shortcuts / launchers on OS X and
Linux, and to a lesser extend windows)

I believe fixing the above points, with whatever logo being used, would
already greatly help improve the situation. As for the currently most used
logo (http://qgis.org/templates/qgis/images/blue/logo.png) and the SVG
you've pointed out, I believe the main technical issue is the lack of
subtlety in its use of basic filters (namely outer glow and emboss), which
IMO leads to the "not professionally looking" argument. I did a quick
comparison based on the SVG you've referred to to illustrate this point,
see http://licadho-cambodia.org/qgis_proposal/point.png

* * Who decides what professionally looking means and what are the criteria?
*
Indeed, many aspects of art / design is in subjective, and I guess that's
at the essence of the passions surrounding discussing the logo :)

* * How important is the brand recognition from the old logo?*
I think your raising a good objective point here. Then again, if a majority
feels like a change would be a net benefit to the project, might be good to
look at it sooner than later. A major 2.0 milestone is a good excuse for
this too.

Hope that was a respectful reply.

I can confirm both issues raised by Andreas.

Beyond that, very useful feature.

Hi all, 
really nice again Radim ! (I'm glad we found some euros for it ;-))
I confirm first issue with rectangle.
I didn't encounter slow down or crashes with osgeo4w installer in WIN XP.
revision f210668. I will keep on testing.

To be fair, we should also thank Regis and the Agence de l'eau Adour

I'll try to implement it as soon as I find a slot of time.
I don't guarantee it because my C++ programming skills are not so high...

On the other hand, there is already QgsVertexMarker, which offers
similar possibilities.

Wow, great!
I alreay know the logics behind it. I have done many QgsMapCanvasItem
subclasses in my Python plugins to customize the marker graphics.
Having it incorporated in QgsRubberBand saves some boilerplate code ;)

Meanwhile the word on the osgeo-discuss mailing list is 'awesome!'. I
honestly looked at this new GRASS web site and thought I was still
looking at the old one (not that I go there much). Rounded corners,
wrong use of tabs, poor handling of narrow screens (the tabs wrap and
the content gets pushed down) - it was like 2004 all over again...

For Qgis, +1 for anything using Twitter Bootstrap, but an immediate -1
if it still looks like Twitter Bootstrap...

Hi!

Well there will always be lots of space for improvement and of course all
things pointed out by Tim are correct ..
Surely I did not mean to copy it bit by bit - but at least .. and that's
the major point .. the new page is nevertheless an improvement over the
last one.
And .. there is some movement ..
I am pretty sure that you cannot do it "right" for everyone .. but as long
as we agree that there has to be something done with our page  ..
But I see Richard is doing great and I also like the style of bootstrap
(have to test it on mobile devices too).
So as long as there is some movement here too .. I am not complaining. It
was just a glimpse to others to maybe bring some fresh ideas.

regards
werner

Hi all,

I would like to write small utility to manipulate metadata in a JSON
file (for QGIS Webclient), like this one:
http://webgis.uster.ch/qgis-web-client-dev/js/GISProjectListing.js

The tool should import the JSON file, change some values and write it back.

The idea would be to update, e.g. the time the data was last updated or
other values.

My questions:

* what library should I use? SimpleJSON? Others?

* Does someone have sample code around that does something similar?

Thanks,
Andreas

Python has a builtin JSON module
http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.htmlwhich reads JSON into a
Python dict

Why not use the default python library? It will probably give the least
dependency problems.

Matthias and Nathan is a true.
In fact there is not so much choices simplejson now is the same json for 
python 2.5 and 2.6 so it's now by default in python.

Thanks all for your hints.

Will have a look at the built-in json module.

Will have to find out how the dictionary looks like, that python is
generating and how to traverse it.

Thanks,
Andreas

Yeah well its a two step process - first make it use bootstrap....then make
it look like we don't use bootstrap :-) As a sampler I dropped in a theme
from http://bootswatch.com/ (Cyborg theme since I was feeling
intergalactic) and with 2 seconds work the docs render like this:

http://imgur.com/tNipi

Basically with all the infrastructure in place it will just come down to
having a nice css theme written for bootstrap and all the other boring bits
of building the site will be taken care of for us.

Tim

Hi all.
I see mapserver is using more or less our approach, right?
http://www.mapserver.org
It would be good not to be too different from all related projects.
All the best.

It would be nice to have some of these nice new features in QGIS server
also.
All the best.

Which features would you port to QGis server?
WFS-T maybe? As far as I remeber it has been already proposed in a ticket.
TinyOWS, AFAIK, works only with PG, and I think Qgis already has what is
needed to implement WFS-T.

Hi Ren?,
I missed the push from the wfs_server_transaction to trunk. Great.

If you are interested in using your own SVG marker in QGIS Server, we 
have to close the bug #2781
Relative paths to SvgMarker doesn't work in new symbology 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2781

A patch has been proposed. It contains the change of only one line. If 
someone who well knows the Symbology part of QGIS can review this patch, 
QGIS Server can have this new feature easily.

I have been using my own SVG markers setting them as a subfolder of the
general qgis icons folder.
This solves the problem of opening/saving a shared project between my PC
and the server...

shouldn't these use the Qgis symbology/labelling features?

Hi,

>

Why not integrating mapcache directly to mutualize effort on this part ?
Mapcache can be used standalone, and could read its parameters directly from a 
qgis configuration file. No need to reinvent the wheel here, or would there be a 
good reason to it ?

> - INSPIRE
INSPIRE compatibility is a large topic and is mainly linked to a strict 
implementation of OGC standards.

> - mask layers
That would be great to have in QGIS indeed. It would mean having for each 
layer an attached mask layer, which is not displayed but only used to define 
hidden places.

> - symbol placement
> - label offsets
That's for qgis symbology, not directly a qgis server issue. Label offset in 
mapserver definitly looks cool !

I think that a tile generator from the QGis Desktop side would suffice. Any
other TMS/WMS-T server could use the tile structure.

Hi all

Some ideas :

* templates for HTML popups (already done this in Lizmap, but why not
having it in Qgis)
* tile generator : I agree with Giovanni Allegri, beginning with a mbtiles
generator from a layer/a group in Qgis would be a first step, as Tim
suggested in Lyon hackfest. But why not having the powerfull mapcache being
able to read QGIS projects as well.
* WPS : we could also expose some QGIS method to provide WPS. In the
beginning, simple things as buffer, etc. (based on new QgsExpressions
capabilities : geometry and python/C defined functions), and later (more
manpower needed), it could be great to have Sextante internal methodes
totally decoupled from gui, so that QGIS Server can use Sextante for WPS

Good evening
Michael

You can use HTML for the maptips in QGIS trunk. With the expression
builder you can write any HTML you want from various different
attributes. It would have to be exposed in QGIS server as well.

no idea about that - I don't use tiles.

Would be cool - but not sure if I'd have too many applications for that.
Maybe our customers ... or maybe a future QGIS web client.

well always someone is ahead of the others.

Mapserver is catching up with the vector field renderer, SVG symbols and
labeling.

We have to catch up with other features.

It is good to have competition.

The one thing were UMN Mapserver is a much better is performance. This
is where we should really catch up.

Hi,

You mean accessing the templates through QGIS server ? Because html popups 
already are in QGIS :)

+1 for mbtiles generator, as extract feature
+1 for mapcache as dynamic cache management

Decoupling sextante from qgis gui is a must, to be able to run processes from 
the command line, or on a remote screenless server, and then for wps too.

We should have a look at PyWPS too, which could be an easy way to provide WPS 
services around QGIS API.

Yes or probably more accurate to say we are using their approach since they

I mean through Qgis Server (in respect to this thread title ;)
Just exposing methods for the server must do it, as Andreas proposed.

Yes, pyWPS could help provide this feature, but we still need a way so that
QGIS Server can use python plugins / processes, etc.. I remember discussion
about this during last hackfests, but I do not know if someone gave it a
try.

Anyway, +10000 for focusing on performance first, which is the key
"feature" for a Server.

I would put this to the higher position! I don't know where the effort
should be put, because I suppose it's something deep in the rendering
engine of QGis. Do you see bottlenecks at the server level?

I would also add a point to the whishlist: Qgis Server Python API ;)

Lets say that speed of QGIS Server is good enough for most of my projects. But it could be faster for more complex rendering and labeling.

UMN feels faster than QGIS Server - but I don't have time for double configurations for desktop and web. Plus - it is so much easier to configure QGIS projects compared to editing mapfiles.

As for performances, the software stack used by QGIS is much fatter than the 
one used by Mapserver for instance. 
Using the QT framework is great for desktop applications, but degenerates 
performances when used in another context. Compared to QGIS, mapserver uses 
custom C implementation with thinner memory and computing resources 
management. This is valid for TinyOWS, mapcache and mapnik too.

Ways to overcome this could be :
* multithreading (but the catch-up will only work for a one-process 
architecture, mapserver can be parallelized since it's stateless)
* using GPUs : that's a big task to implement

This does not mean QGIS will alway be 10 times slower than mapserver and can't 
be improved, but it would be really surprised to see it keeping up with 
mapserver or mapnik performances.

Actually, if performance is important a cache proxy should be used. I do it
with UMN Mapserver too.
With tile rendering, requested through MapProxy or similar WMS-T/TMS
server, we should provide metatiling and buffering. That would be needed by
the tile generator too, I suppose...

I am very interested in participating in this as it points out to be a
main topic in the EU and also targets performance dicussions.

Hi all

Performance is a complex topic, it essentially depends what you are 
testing ( few complex polygons, many small polygons, type of raster, 
lots of labels, ...).
I'm regularly profiling some of my important server projects (e.g. WMS 
of cadastral survey). One thing that takes up a lot of render time is 
the drawing of the labels (only the rendering, not the placement).
I think this is because they are rendered using QPainterPath and not 
with QPainter->drawText (but it might be difficult to render the buffer 
using drawText).

And don't forget that normally the transfer of the image over the 
internet takes more time than the WMS rendering itself. So don't forget 
to use jpg for rasters and the improved png8 for vectors. It can improve 
perceived performance by a factor of 3 or 4.

Regards,
Marco

There are two lists you can reference on the wiki (both of which I
updated, or reorganized a bit, this morning)[0][1]. Neither of the
lists speaks directly to what exactly needs done to remove the old
labeling.

There is at least one major issue remaining (that I know of):

Label text should be preserved as text in output (regression) - This
issue also possibly relates to the slower performance many users are
seeing between the old labeling and new. Dr. Marco H. mentioned he
thinks the older method using QPainter::drawText() might be faster
than the current QPainterPath::addText() method. However, I'm not sure
all new features can be done using the older method. Regardless, using
a different method where possible, one that outputs text as text,
would be very beneficial when using the resultant SVG or PDF output in
other applications. Users currently rely upon the old engine for that
purpose.

I am not sure if any other QGIS functionality still uses the old
labeling engine. Even so, at least updating the new engine's features
to the point of removing the old engine's gui should be a priority;
while removing the old labeling engine code could be done later.

Regarding any funding, beyond the noted issue above, you might want to
review list at [1] for candidates on what you would specifically like
to see in version 2.0. The new end-of-December feature freeze means I
have to start paring that list down.

Hi all.
I think we should also consider the open tickets.
IMHO, performances of new labelling are still bad on low end machines,
and this should be addressed. Many of our users do not have brand new
processors.
All the best.

Hi all.
Glad to see my note has solicited so much interest. Let me try to summarize:
- INSPIRE compliance is interesting, and boils down to thoroughly
implement OGC standards; I think we should make QGIS ISPIRE-ready out of
the box (BTW, this would also be a very good marketing tool in Europe)
- there is interest in improving performances; however, our strength is
in the speed of configuration, something more and more important for users
- integrating a mabtiles and mapcache, possibly without reinventing the
wheel, but having it out of the box, is also good
- WPS will be more and more important, as well as Python bindings and
capability of running sextante scripts
- mask layers is interesting
- symbol placement and label offset are cool, not only for server.
Better open tickets as feature requests, not to forget about these ideas?
All the best.

Tablib: Pythonic Tabular Datasets

http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/latest/


tablib.Dataset()
    A Dataset is a table of tabular data. It may or may not have a
header row. They can be build and manipulated as raw Python datatypes
(Lists of tuples|dictionaries). Datasets can be imported from JSON,
YAML, and CSV; they can be exported to XLSX, XLS, ODS, JSON, YAML,
CSV, TSV, and HTML.

tablib.Databook()
    A Databook is a set of Datasets. The most common form of a
Databook is an Excel file with multiple spreadsheets. Databooks can be
imported from JSON and YAML; they can be exported to XLSX, XLS, ODS,
JSON, and YAML.

Probably in other case yes, but for Andreas required things better is to 
use python built in functionality and escape from external dependencies.

Hi,

For 90% of my projects performance is really good. For the remaining
10%, rather complext projects, I would say it is good enough, but it
could be "snappier".

I am specifically talking about the "Leitungskataster" project, the
project displaying all supply lines and waste-water lines, containing
cadastral data, electricity, gaz, water, communication, waste-water and
heating.

These complex projects typically have:

* a lot of layers (around 70 layers)
* a lot of rules in the layer symbology
* automatically placed labels along lines
* dash patterns - almost all the lines are dashed
* SVG symbols

I will have to do my own homework. I will probably have to reduce the
number of layers by using views.

And to be honest, I haven't set up the same project on UMN mapserver to
compare whether it is really faster.

I don't know yet where the bottlenecks are (too many layers, too many
rules, too many rules, too many labels?).

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Noli,

Thanks for your hint, but as Peteris said, I am not dealing with flat
data structure (tabular data), but with nested data structure (more like
typical xml files). I think I will try with the builtin json module as
most people suggested.

Hi Andreas,

what you describe is where I use tiles. My city map is a QGIS project 
with around 25 layers, lots of labels (street names) and elements. I use 
mapcache (standalone) for that and of course it would be nice to have 
that integrated in QGIS server but it was not hard to configure it by 
itself. Creating the tiles is slower than direct rendering from QGIS 
server but accessing is a lot faster than QGIS server (and less CPU). 
eSo caching is an option if data changes do not need to be visible 
immediately. If mapcache could be integrated in QGIs Server we could 
benefit from faster service and have legend and feature info, too.
So +1 for that.
What I really miss in QGIS server compared to UNM mapserver is the 
possibility to keep a certain space around the edge of the generated 
output free of labels (UMN Mapserver has had that already in V 5.? or 
even earlier). This is a must-have if we want to integrate mapcache 
because otherwise there will be broken labels and tiles will not fit to 
each other labelwise.

just my 2 ct

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lizmap - new version released
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6+Jjysv8PZbR+V_U9FyUoESpMB8P8fZ9dAEz3HoxNiZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A new version of Lizmap Web Client and the related QGIS plugin has been
released yesterday, with these new features:

* responsive design : Lizmap fits well on tablets and new smart-phone
screens
* rich html pop-up with configurable templates. You can write different
pop-up templates with the plugin for each layers. You can select which
layers will have a popup.
* media management : you can use files stored in a media folder in the same
directory as the QGIS project, and use these files in pop-ups and in the
information link for each layer. For example, you can have a pop-up
displaying the content of a different HTML file for each feature, or
display images in the pop-up.

Full change log here :
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/lizmapwebclient/Changelog_en#Version-240-14-november-2012

We will follow QGIS Server evolutions (and help developing some features)
to use QGIS internal solutions (e.g. for popup templates), but in between
we are trying to bring some cool features in Lizmap, as a proof of concept.

Lizmap has already these features :
* automatic tile caching system, not OGC compliante, but very handy : no
configuration file, only one checkbox to activate with the plugin. And it
supports metatiling !
* responsive design and ability to change the interface easily with theming
(CSS + html templates)
* multi-project and multi repository (folders containing projects)
* groups, users and rights management which help controlling who can view
which maps or use your WMS services
* simple publication system from you computer to the server with the plugin
* external base layers : OpenStreetMap, Google (Sat, terrain, streets)
* Transform QGIS groups of layers into one single layer in the web map.

We have many more ideas to improve Lizmap, and are looking for some
financial support to help us developing the following features :
* layer data edition : geometry and attributes, using the new WFS-T feature
* printing
* search module, using WFS
* display the layer attribute table
etc.

Lizmap demo site :
http://demo.3liz.com/lizmap

I totally agree. As I said in an earlier reply, metatiling and buffering
are a must to serve tiled caches.

A very short answer here : have you checked the Lizmap ability to create
automatic tile cache ? It supports metatiling too.
As I know, it is the only open-source solution which can simply use a QGIS
project, build a map and dynamically create tile caching with metatile
support.

Sorry for this intervention about Lizmap. But as it is open-source, and
deeply dependant of QGIS, I think people won't mind. Tell me otherwise, I
will stop.

Cheers
Michael

Indeed, it is a pleasure to hear that. I was thinking of having tiling
embedded on the server, so it will be available for all clients, but
maybe your approach has more sense, unsure about that.
Thanks.

It's a good thing to have Lizmap metatiling and caching, and I congratulate
for your work.

Anyway, having tile caching and metatiling at the server level would
provide a larger benefit.
We will consider it fro founding...

Thanks for your answer Paolo.

I obviously already thought about developing caching in QGIS. But :
* it would be a big work, and if so, I think using an external powerful
library as Mapcache makes more sense
* it took us only one day to develop the caching system in Lizmap, because
PHP and the jelix framework provide all the stuff needed to achieve this
goal efficiently. This is why we did it (why not at this cost :)  )  We
could also use memcache, postgresql bdd to store the cache, etc.

It make me think about authentication. We could also think about developing
a kind of map proxy inside QGIs Server (to protect WMS services, etC.), but
I also think it is not the best place. Other tools have already all the
methods to do it simply (as Jelix we use for Lizmap). Think about ldap, or
other auth systems...  Not to mention that groups, users and rights must be
store in one database, so we would need to have a dedicated database for
QGIS which stores them and link to projects. And developp the user
interface to manage it.

I really think we should focus on performance improvement and spatial OGC
services (like WPS) in order to keep QGIS Server robust and easy to use.

I understand this. In your opinion, would it be difficult to add the
same also to qgis web browser (I know it's unfair to ask, since it's
actually a competitor ;) ).
All the best.

We have started working on a proxy app for qgis-web-client. It's in an
early phase, but authentication and custom searches are already there.
We're seeking a new project to continue the development ;)

Thinking on the points given by Michael, I agree with him. Caching should
be done by another software layer.
Metatiling should be at the server level only if we state that the server
support tile-mode (as in UMN Mapserver).
I think Edge labels buffering is something the server cannot delegate...

Qgis Web Client is more a friend than a competitor, as we all try to
enhance QGIS Server to improve each client :)

I think this is the big difference between Lizmap and Qgis Web Client (but
I can be wrong, as I have barely tested it) :
* Lizmap is buit with a php framework, so it do whatever is possible server
side : rights management, use database , use web caching, etc. Lizmap does
2 jobs : it create the web map interface AND it acts as a proxy between
QGIS Server and the web map.
* Qgis Web Client is built with geoext, which is only javascript. So you
cannot create web services with it. You must rely on other tools to
provides server side scripting.

Marco, please correct me if I am wrong.

You're right. Multiple solutions are always good for the market ;)
Qgis Web Client, by itself, provides only a couple of python cgi scripts
for text searches on structured PG tables.
That's why we've started developing the Django project to sit in between
Qgis Web Client and Qgis Server...

Hey again,

To come back to the first subject "server features", I think we need to
have a look at how the fast cgi detects the project changes. I often need
to reload the apache server to see some changes in the images generated by
QGIS Server. Marco told me there is a detection of the changes in the
project files, but I have seen all the changes are not always detected.

I should try to set up a list all the possible changes that are not taken
into account...

Message-ID: <CAMFSZzoR+OqFA0+ZJZZQQe5GerWykDtwOaNvb2Tg7s7sB3UACA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am attempting to create a custom form when the user click on a feature in
the layer of my plugin. I have managed to create the custom form, and it
loads automatically and binds to  the data correctly.
I just cannot seem to find the option to set the size of the dialog when it
opens. (It currently opens at a default size which has to be resized
manually everytime.

Any help appreciated

Hi All

I am trying to select all features in a layer where the value of a
particular attribute is something specific.
I would then like to iterate over each of these features and validate
certain other attributes and update other attributes based on whether that
validation passes or fails.

Any idea how I can do something like this in Python?

Hi,

I've corrected the PyQgsRectengle because it was my fault.

The others isn't mine :

	spatialite versions
Message-ID: <1352990256890-5016639.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
just a note to keep in mind for next Windows package (for 2.0). I couldn't
use 1.8 standalone package in my corp. since spatialite librairies are out
of date. Qspatialite can't work with it, and i had many trouble creating and
importing into spatialite (error with geometry_columns, cast_to_multi() and
so on.. ). Almost a blocker in fact...

Second minor problem, globe is embedded, but really troubleshoots on
Windows. IMHO, really experimental things should no be in official
standalone package. 
I had some extra days of work to test and deploy a home-made package of
co-workers.. 

If somedy has some free time, a new package could help.. but this is not
critical

All the best

That probably was also true for the osgeo4w qgis-dev version at that point.
People should test it before release - as that's nearly what's going to in the
stable release.

And the osgeo4w packages are also what is used to build the standalone
installer (see ms-windows/osgeo4w/creatensis.pl).   So what doesn't work in
osgeo4w won't work in the standalone installer, too.

I think Guiseppe fixed the spatialite problem and Pirmin wanted to update the
globe dependencies.

Are there other problems in osgeo4w?

If not, running creatensis.pl again shouldn't be a problem.

BTW ECW support was meanwhile dropped in osgeo4w (after the GDAL update to
1.9.2) and also will lack in the next package.  Neither Frank nor I were able
to mobilize enough energy to jump though all the hoops they've put in front of
their SDK download.  IIRC also the licensing is somewhat strange to as it
allows client, but forbids server use and the user has to acknowledge it - so
we would even have to add own hoops...

Hi,

I think "expected failure" is ok as long as it's not critical -
although perhaps a bug should be filed.

qgis_expressiontest also still fails - sorry to say this but it is
rather annoying as it's been failing intermittently for months.
Respectfully, someone should fix it or remove that test!

cheers
Etienne

that's true.. I missed it. It's now in my use cases ;-)
My post was just a reminder, and a way to share troubles encountered so that
other could find it googling. No need for me to upgrade standalone now.
Priority is on 2.0.

Do you mean that standard package for 2.0 won't embed ecw support?? I
recently made fresh installs with OSGEO4W and was pleased to have ecw
support out of the box again. 
Is there anything I can do (paying someone to spend a few days clarifying
ECW situation) or are we trapped by ERDAS??

Intergraph?

Anyway, that must have been before GDAL 1.9.2 - after that, the mrsid plugin,
if installed, even caused an instant crash.  But that package meanwhile rebuilt
for 1.9.2.

The current situation is no ECW support in OSGeo4W - and before we were also
only shipping the gdal ECW plugin, but not the ECW DLLs.

Building the 3.3 SDK from source with VC10 and doing a GDAL plugin based on
that also works, but the licensing/distribution issue for the ECW DLLs is
unclear to me - and therefore we didn't upload that plugin.  It's not usable
without VC10 builds of the 3.3 ECW DLLs and doubt that they are publically
available anywhere.

I really can't work out the failing qgis_expressiontest as it only happens
sometimes and I can never reproduce it.  I'll take more of a look at it
today.

Hi Pardhu, nice to hear your interest, your first step would be to
please consider asking google as well :)

Message-ID: <b258dfa1b63a03b544cf2b9541447837@carto.net>

 Hi all,

 Wouldn't it be good to offer 64bit Windows versions from QGIS version 
 2.0 on? Most new and many existing Windows PCs are 64bit Windows these 
 days.

 I don't expect someone to work for free on it, but if an estimate could 
 be done how many hours of work it would mean to put together a 64bit 
 OSGeo4W and standalone viewer, we could start collecting money to make 
 it happen. There should be enough Windows users out there with a strong 
 interest in the 64bit version.

 Question: is this more a one-time investment or would it mean a lot of 
 work further on, maintaining the two versions, 32bit and 64bit?

 Other opinions?

 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

thanks for the move. We would definitely be interested in a Win64 bit

Hi

It is not difficult to compile a 64bit windows version, since most of 
the dependencies are available from gisinternals( 
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/ ).
The difficulty is more in the detail:
- GRASS : I don't have experience with compilation for 64bit
- Formats like sid, ecw
- Interlis support (important here in Switzerland)

Therefore I think it would be best if osgeo4w could have a 64bit version.

Regards,
Marco

Does a succeeding "expected failure" trigger a testsuite run failure ?
Is this a stable failure ?
Unstable failures should be avoided because they reduce the usefulness
of the testsuite (unstable successes are fine because they are REAL bugs
when they hit).

I have brought it up a few times on the osgeo4w list, we might even have
a ticket for it.

Mostly a one time investment to get all the deps and extras built, or
figure out and document how to build them. Right now osgeo4w is
maintained by a very small team.

My approach is that we should create a parallel branch of osgeo4w for
the 64 bit versions, call it beta or whatever while we work on getting
everything added and make it so people can install both 32 and 64 on the
same computer without issue.

Thanks,
Alex

 Hi,

 Good - how can we proceed here?

 Who would have time and knowledge to do the work in OSGeo4W?

 Who would be able to fund?

 Can the QGIS PSC discuss whether some of the existing QGIS money could 
 be used for that purpose (I would say - only if we can't organize other 
 sources of funding).

 Unfortunately my own employer can't participate with funding this 
 effort, because we already paid too much for other improvements this 
 year and we already have projects for next year.

 Andreas

 Hi Larry,

 Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I think that 
 http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/New_Labeling_changes_and_roadmap is 
 a very good list to see the progress and what unimplemented ideas are in 
 the pipeline.

 I think the most important things are:

 * improve perfomance of the label drawing
 * make sure that text can stay as text (if possible with reasonable 
 effort)
 * and that the buffers can be drawn with reasonable speed
 * removal of old labeling GUI

 All the other stuff can be done after 2.0 - but the above things should 
 be fixed if possible.

 Do you have estimates how much dev time the above 4 points would need?
 Do you think that you can fix these 4 issues until feature freeze?

 Can the PSC please decide whether we can fund this work from the QGIS 
 account? As to my knowledge we have a reasonable amount of money in our 
 bank account that we should use to fix the most important issues for 
 QGIS 2.0.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hexagon(Intergraph(ERDAS(ER Mapper(ECW)))) - I think!

Ah. 

Bummer. 

I suppose that was coming. 

Having had today to think on this I can hopefully say something a (little) bit more intelligent than this morning.

I've discovered that the wretched ER Viewer thing still exists and can help me out if need be. But - I'd very much prefer ecw to be accessible through osgeo4w/qgis.

It's been in my mind this last couple of weeks to ask you and Frank if there was something I could do to help with the gdal-ecw package (since it seems usually to be me making noise). But if it's a licensing thing, I doubt there's much I can do.

My read on the licence is that the "free" desktop download is for desktop only (so not servers), is distributable, and the end product must display the magic notice. I suppose my questions would be:
a) in the osgeo4w situation, who's responsible for that notice? Is it the QGIS team, the OSGeo packagers, or the user that adds the dlls? 
If the dlls were travelling with the plugin, then I'd expect the former two. As the dlls aren't distributed that way it might be that the person who added the dlls has to display the notice. Might it be enough to add some form of disclaimer (that the person installing the plugin warrants that they're following the licence conditions of the EDRAS SDK)?

b) Because the linux and mac gdal installs use the 3.3 SDK source .ecw support will continue in the current manner on those platforms?

c) Does anyone have an set of 3.3 dlls lying around somewhere?

d) If ECW support is disappearing from the osgeo4w packages (and so also the 2.0 standalone when that happens) can it be made abundantly clear (in a visible to average user sort of way)?

Not meaning any criticism (it's not a particularly nice licence and I understand), just looking for a bit more clarity.

-ramon.
(Wondering if should I be signing up to one of the OSGeo lists and asking this there?)

 Hi,

 I am in the process of cleaning up some other project, reducing the nr 
 of necessary layers by changing to the rule based renderer.

 Am I missing something, or is it not possible to rotate symbols based 
 on a rotation attribute when using the rule based renderer? Maybe I 
 don't find it in the GUI? Or is this very important feature not yet 
 present?

 Thanks,

I am not sure I understand exactly what you want, there should be no 
link between the rule-based renderer and the rotation settings. What is 
working for a single that is not working with the rule-based renderer ?

I only have qgis Master here, but I can specify the rotation in the 
rules I create. The data-defined rotation only works for ellipse 
symbols, but this issue is not related to the rule-based renderer.

Which version are you using ?

Regards,

Leyan

 Hi Leyan,

 I am also using the current master.

 If am using the "categorized" or "simple" or "" renderer, there is a 
 "Advanced" button in the bottom right where one can choose a rotation or 
 scale attribute. This button and choice is not available with the 
 rule-based renderer.

 You are right - I can use the ellipse renderer with the rule based 
 renderer, but I would also need it for simple symbols and SVG symbols 
 and for those, we cannot have data-defined settings.

 So it seems that the symbology system is not yet consistent and 
 complete.

 Andreas

* improve performance of the label drawing

Not sure if you specifically mean the drawing of the label, or the
entire labeling process. I'm going to assume the latter. Beyond the
issue with text not being output as text (and how its fix may make
things faster), an analysis/profile and stress test of the PAL engine
would be in order to find it weaknesses under various labeling
scenarios. I would also have to again review Martin's GSoC reports and
consult with Martin and Dr. Marco on where they think PAL might be
able to be improved.

Recently, Sandro Santilli, while working on the topoviewer
integration, noticed PAL's algorithm for calculating label overlaps
for potential candidates taking much longer than the actual Qt
rendering of the label when working with a very large number of
features (> 20k). That's a place to start. Another possible future
solution might be if threading can be leveraged to help speed up PAL
calculations.

It is difficult to say how long a reasonably faster engine will take.
With respects to whether the new engine's labeling performance is a
regression from the old engine's and needs to be 'fixed', I think it's
a case of apples vs. oranges. The new engine offers complex collision
management, while the old one does not, which will always take up more
cpu cycles. While I don't think the new engine will ever be as fast as
a simpler one, a reasonable effort should be made to optimize it as
much as possible before adding cool new features, like leader-line
labels, that will again up the computational cost.

Obviously the new engine could be faster, but is its current
performance really a blocking issue for removing the old one?

* make sure that text can stay as text (if possible with reasonable effort)
* and that the buffers can be drawn with reasonable speed

These two are related. While keeping text as text will require a
different approach, the current use of QPainterPath::addText() works
well for buffers of reasonable size (especially with the use of a
'round' pen join). This means the solution for new text rendering
needs to properly register over the buffer method, if that's the
approach taken. With the current method, I don't think it's possible
to increase the speed at which buffers are drawn.

During the dev period of trying out a new label drawing method, I
think it should be available in parallel with the existing one. With
the new Python binding, a test can be crafted to generate identical
labeling scenarios under the two methods and do benchmarking as well
as graphical comparative analysis of the output. Also, a simple gui
switch will allow other devs/users to test the new method in
real-world scenarios with their own project files, while still having
the fallback of the old method.

* removal of old labeling GUI

This shouldn't take much time, unless some other function of the app
still uses that engine. Then that function might need ported to the
new engine or have some old engine labeling gui options be moved into
it's gui. There also might be plugins that still use the old engine's
binding, so removing the old engine's underlying code may break those
plugins.


> Do you think that you can fix these 4 issues until feature freeze?

I believe so. The steps I would take are:

1) make sure that text stays as text on output, with any appropriate buffers
2) review/fix outstanding issues related to removing old engine
3) find any function of app still using old engine and work with code
maintainer to port it to new one, or attempt to fix it myself
4) remove old gui
5) create method of auto-porting old engine labels to new
6) (if time) work on increasing performance of new engine

While increasing the performance of the new engine is very important,
I would prefer to have actually completed the removal of the old
engine first (at least from the user's perspective and functional
use). This also means that if any other dev wanted to start tweaking
PAL for performance, while I was working to remove the old engine,
there would be a low likelihood of redundant effort, code, or merge
conflicts.

About 5): Once the old engine's gui is gone, what about users who open
a project still using the old labeling? Should the app just prompt
them that there are affected layers and to re-label them using the new
engine, or should there be a function/dialog added that offers to
attempt to automatically port those layers over to the new engine?

The latter might not be too hard since the old engine basically just
labeled points; and, I believe, all of those old settings should port
over to the new Offset settings. The only similar placement missing is
how line layers were labeled in old engine is not present in new
engine. The 'Horizontal' placement in new engine for line labels does
not work the same, and does not support the quadrant/x/y offsets. I
can add the proposed 'Midpoint' placement (see previously noted [1]
list) which would essentially be identical to old engine, or better,
add such functionality to the existing Horizontal placement.

Then, auto-porting of old to new engine layers would be possible.
Whether the old-to-new labels will look identical and be placed the
same is another issue. Though, I don't think very much development
effort should be expended on making them look exactly the same.

Am I missing any other steps on the path to removing old engine?

Larry

Hi Larry, 
I share Andreas concerns, and am wondering how I can help funding some work
to help you. 
I really think speed improvement should be explored in depth.  
I'm also concerned in having curved label consolidated . Seeing actual
roadmap, I guess it now is a feature request for 2.1. or do we still have
some time to have somebody work on it? 
Please tell me
R?gis

Agreed. PAL is kinda complicated in some regards, but it would really
be worth it. I'm a bit curious about an apples vs. apples comparison
between old/new engines, where the new engine is set up, as much as
possible, to simulate the old engine. Then, do some benchmarking to
see the difference.

If that baseline benchmark is quite similar, I would suggest similar
settings be the new defaults (excepting collision avoidance, which
should be on by default), and recommend that current new engine
performance not be considered a blocking issue for removing the old
one. Though, maybe making it better/faster should be considered a
blocking issue for 2.0 release?

Not sure what you mean by 'consolidated.' ?? There is certainly a lack
of feature parity between curved and other line placements, as well as
several noticeable limitations, resulting in too few labels rendered.

However, since curved labels were not in the old engine, or have any
bearing on whether the old engine is removed or not, I think a
different discussion thread should be started about what people want
to specifically see in the 2.0 release, regarding labeling.

There are definitely other items (fixes and features) I would like to
see in the 2.0 release that are listed on that page, but focusing on
removing the old engine is a good user-centric initial goal. Beyond
that, a feature freeze at the end of January would provide much
appreciated 'breathing room' to accomplish more of the list, and to
achieve a better 'punctuated equilibrium' point for a release.

Example (of something that should be in a different discussion thread
;^) : I'd love to see an adaptation of your Easy Custom Labeling
plugin for auto-generating the appropriate data defined columns in the
current data provider for a layer, or in a new one. There's really no
reason for that functionality (even if initially in Python) not to be
part of the core labeling dialog. A separate class for that function
could be written/worked on at the same time as other labeling items,
without much interference between the two efforts (i.e. room for
several devs to work at once).

Thank you for your efforts to help out!

Regards,

Larry

There has been mumors of support for this topic from the OSGeo board and
Mark Lucas said he could potentially find some funds (no exact promises.

I think basically we just need to create the 64 bit folder under the
osgeo4w structure and start populating it with packages as they get built.

Some adjustments or a 64bit clone of the osgeo4w installer would need to
be made (I think the same installer with an option to choose would be good).

Hi all,

I would like to propose that maybe now that we have some extra cash thanks
to our gold sponsor that it might be good to spend at little bit on a main
website design.  I think $1000 would get a pretty nice home page and IMO it
is well worth the money.  Most designs on 99designes[0] are around $700 and
look quite good.

The main page page of a project makes all the difference when it comes to
the impression it leaves on users and this is one thing I think it is worth
spending a little money on to get a professional job done.

Thoughts.

In my experience yes: there are many old PC around, and many of our
users do not have the resources to upgrade. On a slow machine even a
couple of polygon layers, with a few hundreds of records, are enough to
make QGIS barely usable.
All the best.

Hi Nathan,

I agree that as a project it is great to have a nice website layout.

But my experience with a lot of designers like the ones from 99designes 
is that they can create a really nice looking frontpage, but often only 
from scratch, and only with their own tools and scripts.

While in my opinion we should have a relatively simple website design 
(looking at Google stuff) which we can reuse in all our web/html/html stuff.

So not only a nice looking frontpage, But also:
- created using the templating system of Sphinx (because we want to have 
this as a localisation framework)
- created with OR behaving like the bootstrap framework: responsive 
design (both on desktop and phone looking nice) (and we can use the 
relatively simple generated html also into QGIS itself (clicking help in 
a certain dialog just shows a part of the docs into a popup).
- simple simple simple flat structure, so you always now where you are 
in the simple simple hierarchy
- having a good index OR good search engine OR google searchable is in 
my opnion more important than a frontpage overloaded with links to all 
functional corners of website and docs

Concluding: it is fine to spent some money on someone who has clear 
ideas on usability and webdesign, but please let it be one who at least 
is able to use our framework and preferably can implement his/her ideas 
him/herself in our framework (because it think that is our main problem...)

Regards,

Richard

Hi J?rgen,

Would be great if you could work on it. You would be the natural
candidate to do this work.

I think next year would be fine. It would be cool if we could have it
ready with the QGIS 2.0 release.

If you can send us an estimate we can collect some money - don't do this
all in your leisure time. There is probably more exiting stuff to do for
leisure time work ;-)

hi Larry, 
labeling speed is not a blocker for 2.0... agreed.

curve labeling miss options, it's true. But it  also stops labeling too
easily if line is not smooth enough, or is too short for label.. Sounds more
like improvement than new features. 

I keep your idea of integrating easy custom labeling in core. ;-)  Still
there are two dependancies:
- integrate also memory layer saver plugin
- have API break concerning field and fetch stuff comitted. Maybe it's
already done? 

Last thing, Easy custom labeling as a 'generate arrows' function, that is
not satisfying to me. Integrate them into labeling layer directly and have
an option to show it would be better. (change feature type from point to
line and update it if label is moved. Let's keep it for 2.1. for now. 
All the best
R?gis

Please keep an eye also on the bugtracker: we currently have 41 tickets filed under
"Labelling".
Maybe we should mark some of them as blockers.

I marked some which I think ruin user experience but are reasonably fast to fix.

Splitting of layers into columns is not that easy as it seems to be.
It is a special sort of bin packing problem (NP-hard). Maybe it has
its own name? I have used brute force because:
 - I thought that the number of layer will never be too big
 - implementaion of heuristic algorithm for such a marginal feature
seemed to be overkill
 - suboptimal solution could look quite bad

You proved immediately that I was wrong. How many layers do you have?
70 I have read somewhere? My original idea was to calculate number of
possibilities first and decide if heuristic should be used. Now it
seems a necessity.

Maybe I am wrong and there is a simple solution? Well, I did not know
at the beginning that I am going to solve combinatorial exercises.

Regarding the crash, I was quite careful, using value() where there
was minimum suspicion that it could run out of range. Many
combinations should not mean allocation of a lot of memory, just more
computational time. Only one combination is always evaluated at time.
Does it seem to be a memory allocation problem or out of list bounds?
Could you send me backtrace off list?

I will add credits on issue closure as usual. I did not know that it
could get attention so quickly. Thanks to Regis for supporting various
bug fixes, namely 5768, 3737, 5960, 3402, 6237, 6233, 2816, 1841 and
1788.

Fixed.

The problem is most probably combination of many layers and many columns.

Hi all,

there is something really bad with hub.qgis.org and plugin sites last days.
Hub often is down, plugins site was simply unavailable and now it returns
Internal server error 500.

We are running our first Russian Open GIS! conference this days and
this is really
sad. We tried to promote QGIS here but this problems... this  makes
bad impression
about our infrastructure.  ?ne workshop was discarded today because of
this server
failures.

Any chance to fix at least plugins site?

Thanks

Hi

My opinion is that if we start using any project cash it should be to pay
e.g. young graduate or similar to do stuff like write tests, cleanup api
docs, beef up python cookbook. As far as the web site is concerned, I think
the greater need is for information management / organisation than for
design, and that is something that can come from within the project. We
just need someone to come up with a great bootstrap theme for us and it
seems like boottheme.com provides a simple avenue for this if we can get
e.g. Anita or someone with a good eye for visuals to spend a little time
coming up with good theme that is distinctive.

Regards

Tim

The new engine can work with collision detection removed, right ?
Would it be as fast as the old one in that case ?
Could that behavior be made the default, so that old users won't
notice any difference and new users won't be hit by performance 
issues until opting for a better placement ?

Of course it's still useful to improve the performance of collision
detection code but could be done with less pressure...

The server crashed - probably because some bot was indexing redmine again.

Alex Mandel tried to reboot the machine, but it was stuck in a password prompt
when trying to do the fsck and we couldn't get to the console - and therefore
needed help from osuosl.   Therefore the outage took about 5h (yesterday 19h-0h
CET).

Apparently the plugin site and planet didn't come up cleanly after that and
that went unnoticed - at least yours is the first complaint I've seen.

I added a module to munin that monitors the status and memory usage of redmine.  
And script that kills heavy redmine processes.  So hopefully redmine won't take
the server down again.

Done.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look that way. I ran some basic tests using
QTime, like had already been set up for QgsPalLabeling, and came up
with results pointing to a performance regression that probably needs
addressed before the old engine is removed.

Note: these manual tests were run against a point layer, which does
not generate extra calculations for dynamic placements, like for line
or polygon layers (i.e. these are the best case results for PAL, for
comparison to old engine, not a cross-section of average use).

Data: point layer with 10888 points (8 layers of 1361 features each,
in test groups)
CPU: Intel 64, i5

OLD Engine draw:  1012 ms
(this had nominal variance during testing)

PAL Engine settings (not default, trying for best case):
FALP, 1 cand. for point layers, show all labels

Offset placement:
PAL work:  1949 ms
PAL draw:  2045 ms

Around placement:
PAL work:  1337 ms
PAL draw:  1981 ms

Data defined and pinned:
PAL work:  1311 ms
PAL draw:  1989 ms

PAL Offset 3994 ms / OLD 1012 ms = 3.95x slower
PAL Around 3318 ms / OLD 1012 ms = 3.28x slower
PAL Data defined 3300 ms / OLD 1012 ms = 3.26x slower

Elapsed times for PAL got worse as zooming out caused labels to
overlap more. Final zoom out was reached when labels created a solid
black interior of overlap.

PAL Offset zoom out, full overlap:
PAL work:  5377 ms
PAL draw:  1981 ms

PAL Data defined zoom out, full overlap:
PAL work:  3752 ms
PAL draw:  1993 ms

PAL Offset with full extent, 50% overlap as individual layer (1/8):
PAL work:  48 ms (x8 = 384)
PAL draw:  280 ms (x8 = 2240 )

Extrapolated from 1 layer to 8:
PAL 2624 ms / OLD 1012 = 2.59x slower
(PAL work still gets slower on zoom out, though less overlap checking)

Back to using all 8 layers (10888 features) at once, with default
engine settings...

PAL Offset with collision management
PAL work:  10065 ms  !
PAL draw:  15 ms ... labels# 75 (10888 - collisions)

PAL Around with collision management
PAL work:  4100 ms
PAL draw:  24 ms ... labels# 114 (10888 - collisions)

PAL Data defined with collision management (Offset layer setting)
PAL work:  1375 ms
PAL draw:  14 ms ... labels# 77 (10888 - collisions)
(i.e. no significant difference in work, compared to 'show all labels'
set to on)

Some conclusions to draw from these preliminary results:

1) Qt drawing time stays rather consistent. QgsPalLabeling's method
(PAL lib doesn't actually draw) looks to be ~2x slower than old
engine. Making the change to text-as-text output may help with this.

2) Regardless of the 'show all' labels setting for the engine,
overlaps are still calculated even though it seems to make no sense
(labels should basically be outputted to screen like old engine,
yes?). This is even the case for x/y data defined labels. The overlap
issue should be addressed.

3) PAL Offset placement has worse performance than Around. Seems like
it should be closer to data defined results. It's code should be
reviewed for optimization.

4) At 'best' configuration for comparison to old engine, PAL can be
considered to be overall 2-4 times slower, depending upon overlap of
labels due to zoom level. I think this is enough to warrant serious
investigation into optimizations, before removing old engine.

Larry

Hi all.
In general, I think we should:

- list in detail our needs for a prompt and smooth release of 2.0; my blockers are:

  * SIP Bindings revision
  * Symbology overhaul
  * Labelling overhaul
  * New web site and docs
  * SEXTANTE integration
  * Interface cleanup and consistency
  * Plugins migration

Missing anything?

- see if there is any of these who is likely to cause a serious delay (too much work,
few resources)

- get an estimate to fix it

- start a bidforfix campaign about it (sorry, I'm late on this)

- if we can't get enough money from the campaign to cover all the needs, decide how
to best allocate our sponsors and donors resources.

Opinions?
All the best.

Hi all.
I understand the problem. I asked directly ERDAS a few years ago, so we had precise
guidelines. Now things have changed, so I'd suggest to:
- ask again the proprietary of the ECW software and patents about what we can and
what we can't do
- if they come out with reasonable requests, we can follow them
- if not, I guess the only option for corporate users is to prepare ad hoc packages
for redistribution within the company, as this might be allowed by the licence.
All the best.

Are we sure this redistribution is legal? AFAIK, it was not at least until a couple
of years ago, and I have no clue the situation has improved since.

It would ultimately become the theme for http://qgis.org too since we plan
to move all web content into the doc project and curate everything as one
content set. The overrriding goals are to:

* centralise translation
* centralise maintenance of *all* documentation
* ensure that the look and feel is consistent across *all* QGIS properties

indegogo takes 4% from donations, or 9% if we do not reach the goal (plus 3% from
donors). unclear to me what are the costs involved for bidforfix.

indegogo takes 4% from donations, or 9% if we do not reach the goal
(plus 3% from
donors). unclear to me what are the costs involved for bidforfix.

In fact, we had indiegogo already on the list, and discarded it for this reason, and
because it is not targeted towards software.
So I'm going for BfF, unless somebody objects very soon.
All the best.

Hi

No objection from me - I just thought it interesting that OL had chosen
something. I like the idea of having a massive funding drive like they do -
though their service offerings etc provided as incentive must complicate
the hell out of things...

Tim

Yes, it looks more like a million dollar campaign. I think we aim at the 10k range,
at least for a first test of the response.
All the best.

There is a slightly newer version here:

http://www.duif.net/qgis/doc/output/html/en/
(there we divided sources in a docs and a website part already, see

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master/source

Maybe good to know that we took the Sphinx basic layout, and merged it 
with this Bootstrap layout:

http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/fluid.html

Then in the qgis.css we sprinkled some rules to make the black menubar 
the color of the old qgis sites, and hold the qgis icon.
(theoretically we can do with only some very specific qgis site rules in 
qgis.css).

To build your own tree, please read:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/readme.rst


?? Maybe we should not even have a menubar in the topbar, but only have 
a left bar which holds a menu when it is usefull. Now when you resize 
your window to a phone size, sometimes you have a sort of two menu's

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

Thanks for all the info. No luck with Boottheme so far. I guess I
don't understand it yet and also it's unusable on my notebook screen.
Would need at least twice the screen estate to work with it.

Introducing Bootstrap should enable us to write a responsive site,
right? So Sphinx cannot do responsive sites?

How about using an existing Sphinx Bootstrap Theme? Have you looked into that?
http://loose-bits.com/2011/12/09/sphinx-twitter-bootstrap-theme.html

While I still love design, I'm not up-to-date with responsive design I'm afraid.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Larry

Thank you for these interesting results. You are right, we first need to 
understand where the time is spent.
Did you make sure the font settings are the same for new / old symbology 
in the comparison? I see that the buffer is enabled by default in the 
new labelling and disabled by default in the old one. Also, buffer unit 
is mm in new engine and point in the old one.

Regards,
Marco

That won't change.  From source nothing changes.   It's just that you need to
build the gdal ecw plugin to get ECW support and you need the SDK for that -
and that's the same as on Windows and Linux.

For debian for instance there's also no ecw binary - the available package that
has a script that builds the plugin for you, if you tell where you SDK is.

Those won't help as they are probably not build with VC10 and are therefore
incompatible with the GDAL build (interface ECW<=>GDAL is C++; so unlike C the
ABI is an issue).

In OSGeo4W the ecw package was already tagged obsolete.  For the standalone we
could add a big fat notice...

I double-checked, and there were no buffer settings turned on for
either engine. The font settings were also the same (default app/Qt
font, not styled, same point size).

I'm currently looking into setting up Valgrind and adding more
embedded QTime debugging output. Also, going to recompile 1.8 with
debug output so I can do a side-by-side comparison between master, to
see if any recent code introduced is causing a performance issue.


Anyone have an opinion about the following (previously posted)? ...

-------------------->8====
About 5): Once the old engine's gui is gone, what about users who open
a project still using the old labeling? Should the app just prompt
them that there are affected layers and to re-label them using the new
engine, or should there be a function/dialog added that offers to
attempt to automatically port those layers over to the new engine?

The latter might not be too hard since the old engine basically just
labeled points; and, I believe, all of those old settings should port
over to the new Offset settings. The only similar placement missing is
how line layers were labeled in old engine is not present in new
engine. The 'Horizontal' placement in new engine for line labels does
not work the same, and does not support the quadrant/x/y offsets. I
can add the proposed 'Midpoint' placement (see previously noted [1]
list) which would essentially be identical to old engine, or better,
add such functionality to the existing Horizontal placement.

Then, auto-porting of old to new engine layers would be possible.
Whether the old-to-new labels will look identical and be placed the
same is another issue. Though, I don't think very much development
effort should be expended on making them look exactly the same.

For the devs on Mac, setup XCode, and then use DTrace (Its under
Instruments?) to profile, there are ready made scripts to do the CPU
profiling...

I think auto-porting should be the aim here, so welcome any addition 
to the new labeling framework that makes this possible. Ideally with
as close as possible look & performance.

No. I have not tried doing this thing yet. I don't have a need for
FileGDB at the moment.

Is this possible?

I'd volunteer to send the letter, but it should probably come from higher up the food chain than me :)
However, I'd be willing to reframe the letter so that they were made aware that there were users that they'd miss out on if they didn't give you reasonable guidelines.

Yes, you just need to use the same compiler to build the SDK and the plugin -
ie. currently VC10.

It's currently there - but marked obsolete.

 Hi Paolo and others,

 The situation with GeoPDF is a bit similar to DXF - which basically 
 means that although ogr supports it it will be a LOT of work to support 
 it, because of the following:

 * QGIS needs to support OGR feature styling first - needs to 
 automatically convert QGIS symbology to OGR feature styling. The problem 
 here is, that QGIS has a richer symbology feature set than OGR and it 
 would only work for simpler symbology anyway.
 * QGIS needs to support the export of several QGIS layers into one OGR 
 document
 * SVG symbols need to be converted into symbols that OGR can digest - 
 or we have enhance OGR to support SVG to xx conversion.
 * while exporting you probably also want to take into account a certain 
 export map scale (e.g. exporting for scale of 1:1000) and QGIS would 
 have to read all symbology and label rules for that certain map scale to 
 apply them - even if GeoPDF and DXF are in real-world coordinates.

 All of these mean probably several hundred hours of work.

 The good news is that the first bullet point is already financed by the 
 City of Morges - with the purpose of exporting DXF files while keeping 
 the symbology as close as possible. Marco H. will work on it before the 
 end of the year.

 If you have additional funding it would help to speed up the process.

 Hi all,

 The W3C SVG working group is discussing the addition of label-points 
 (similar to a centroid, but guaranteed to be within the polygon) to the 
 SVG format.

 If anyone of you developers have any experience or input what 
 algorithms are recommended, please let the SVG WG know or join the 
 discussion at
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2012Nov/0009.html

 Thanks,

Hi.
Thanks Andreas for the detailed explanation. One point about styling:
wouldn't it be better to add SLD support to OGR, instead of supporting
(yet another) non-standard styling?
All the best.

I need to make some changes to the contents of the project file as soon as
it's written.
I can intercept the writeProject() signal, but there's no way to know when
the writing has finished.
Have you ever faced this need?
Do I have to watch, somehow, the low level filesystem signals?

Hi,

Please notice that my tutorial is about geospatial PDF, the name GeoPDF is a registered trade mark of TerraGO. GDAL can write also that variant of geospatial PDF if option -co GEO_ENCODING=OGC_BP is used, but even then it is not GeoPDF(tm).

About ORG feature styling, it is a mechanism for doing per feature styling which would be awfully complicated with SLD so I think that is has also the right for living.

I want to make my plugin automatically load a specified .qgs Project file

I'm sure that I must be missing something.
Any help appreciated

To load a project file call QgisInterface::actionOpenProject()

most app-related stuff that a plugin can do are in the QgisInterface class
	
On a related note:
If you want the plugin to do something when a project file is loaded,
you need to connect to the QGisInterface projectRead() signal

http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html#af740dfa32487613224a249c8f5c2111b

This will ensure that when a project is loaded your code will get called.

If you manage it, please report back. My workaround is clunky, but it works for me.  A usable, more elegant approach would be nice to have. If the simple method works for you or others, then I probably have something else wrong with my system that I would need to sort out.

Cheers,

Or programmatically open the project file like this:

        QgsProject.instance().setFileName(myProjectPath)
        QgsProject.instance().read()

It could be useful (for the future) to have also a writtenProject signal,
to be able to do post-saving processing. I will add a wish ticket...

Hi,

It seems to me that QgisInterface::actionOpenProject() (and
QgisApp::addProject()) do a lot more than QgsProject.instance().read()
- how much of that is important?

If it's just a question of FGDB support for GDAL (and QGIS), I've been sitting on a FGDB plugin for my GDAL framework.  2 problems have been holding me back: the license is unclear if the DLLs can be distributed with open source software (or any software at all), and even if that was allowed, all Esri software has an export limitation that I am not capable of enforcing in my downloads.

The only option I can think of is to have users download and install the FGDB API themselves and my plugin will use that (I did that long ago with the OCI plugin).  I could craft my installer to make that painless.  Other open source software does a similar thing with incompatible licenses.

The latter approach sounds like a good and acceptable means of making this available to all the framework users out there, which is probably 99% of all QGIS mac users. I think you have to create a free ESRI account to download the api, so you are most likely in safe territory having users that require FileGDB signing on and agreeing to ESRI's license on their own. Thanks for chiming in on this and proposing a good solution!

John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add Layer to overview
Message-ID: <1353412887988-5017616.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

i am writing a QGIS C++ plugin  for version 1.7.4 (it is the company
baseline at the moment) and i am very new to QGIS development.
This plugin  adds several layers to the current project on a user triggered
event.
Now i need to automatically display a couple of those layers in the overview
dock but i can't find how to do it.
Selecting the layer and triggering the addLayerToOverview action, as found
on the web, doesn't work (actually on my version of QGIS it doesn't even
work by triggering the action from the menu).
Triggering the addAllLayerToOverview action works but the result is not what
i want to achieve.
By inspecting the source code it looks like i have to use the QgsLegend and
QgsLegendItem classes but they are not available in my OpenSuse devel
package (it provides only QgsLegendInterface).
Is there any way i can achive the result ?

Regards.
Roberto.

Message-ID: <CANXr7vdDpC3heOO_5Uxo9Di6At6uA7H7zvwt-vNEcxrsYbOu0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have one global question about QGIS.
What is the situation with the development of Quantum GIS Engine?
I mean non-gui classes built on the top of Qt framework, which are
responsible for spatial data management and rendering.
Is there any active work on the significant improving of rendering
performance (http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Rendering_Performance) or
redesign of QGIS Engine object model (
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Redesign_of_QGIS_data_model)?
Are there any plans for development of Qt-independent GIS core (with AGG
rendering engine, maybe)?

Looking through developer mailing lists of last years (2010-2012), I
haven't found active discussion about the development of QGIS engine.
Is there another information about this topic?

Oleg.

Hi,

I am trying to run a single python test from its directory, and am
getting 2 problems:

1) it is not using my custom build (but system install in /usr/
2) getting segfault after execution

problem 2 is no big deal, but how can I run the tests using my build
(in /home/softdev or in  /data/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/build-debug)

I can get the python tests to run using "make test" from the build dir
- but that is very long as it does ALL tests

Thanks
Etienne

Try

ARGS="-R PyQgsVectorLayer" make test

I just discovered that "make test" calls ctest, and ARGS value is
passed to ctest.
To get verbose output (like debug messages and any print you do in the
tests), you need to add the -V option

i.e.  ARGS="-V -R PyQgsVectorLayer" make test

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvP+Y+Viv7ATWZLGVgovO-SCDCzbuSk1ztr3r=d4vpr8_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to add some tests for the addRasterLayer() and
addVectorLayer() members in QgisApp, and it seems I cannot have access
to them from the test environment.

I tried including qgisapp.h, but that needed an extra rule in
CMakeLists (to add src/app to INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES), but this generated
the following error when building

In file included from /data/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/src/app/qgisapp.h:91:0,
                 from
/data/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/tests/src/core/testqgsvectorlayer.cpp:34:
/data/src/qgis/qgis-etiennesky/src/app/qgssnappingdialog.h:22:38:
fatal error: ui_qgssnappingdialogbase.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.


I also tried using QgsInterface from a python test, but it doesn't
work because in tests/src/python/utilities.py
"QgisInterface is a stub implementation of the QGIS plugin interface"

How to get the "real" QgsAppInterface like when using a plugin?

thanks
Etienne

How to get the "real" QgsAppInterface like when using a plugin?
>

Hi Etienne

that's right, it's not possible to access QgisAppInterface outside of
running QGIS instance. This has a reason: the interface provides various
methods that make sense only when QGIS is running (e.g. access to map
canvas, main window, toolbars). For testing purposes you could create a
fake implmentation of QgisInterface, but that's most likely not what you
want.

IIRC addVectorLayer() and addRasterLayer() are just relatively simple
wrappers around this code:
layer = new Qgs[Vector / Raster]Layer( ... );
if (layer->isValid())
  QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(layer);

I'm wondering what exactly are you trying to test... is it the "core" layer
(and provider) loading or the connection with other QGIS components?

Regards
Martin

Hi

I understand that QgisAppInterface should only be available wen running the app.

I am working with sublayer handling, which is not handled my
QgsRasterLayer / QgsVectorLayer .  Have a closer look at the various
addRasterLayers and it's not as simple as you write (in part my fault
- I hacked around existing code to add zip support and also raster
sublayers).

- vectors datasets can have multiple layers
- rasters can have sublayers (subdatasets in GDAL)
- zip files can have multiple layers/subdatasets

Unfortunately the code that handles sublayer loading is in QgisApp,
and I would like to add some tests for this in case it gets broken in
the future. It broke a few months ago for rasters, and there ia a case
where it doesn't work for vectors.

Would you have a suggestion as to how we can improve this - i.e.
manage sublayers outside of QgisApp?

thanks
Etienne

Alternatively you can do:

The next main task is for Martin to merge his threading branch which
we hope will improve rendering performance somewhat. I also have some
ideas about using a compositing so that we can boost performance at
the possible expense of greater memory usage while rendering.

Not currently. By the way as far as I know the Arthur paint system in
Qt4 is based on AGG.

Not formally that I can think of. Rendering performance in my opinion
should be the major focus of the 2.x release series - we have rich
functionality now but we need to deliver that quickly to the display
device or the user gets frustrated.

If you are working on master we could probably just add a 'project

Afaik it is not based on AGG. The QImage rasterizer is based on the 
freetype scan-converter.
There is an article about it 
(http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2009/12/18/qt-graphics-and-performance-the-raster-engine/). 
The authors of Qt seem to have considered building it on top of AGG 
first, then decided that it is not a good idea (template based approach 
of AGG, too many conversions).

Regards,
Marco

I don't know if AGG would be faster than the Qt raster paint engine and 
how much. It would be very interesting to have the comparison AGG <-> Qt 
raster engine (and maybe libcairo as well).

With AGG / cairo, the approach would be to create a new Qt paint engine 
based on these libs (rather than changing the code in qgis core to be Qt 
free). If someone knows of an AGG paint engine implementation or likes 
to create one, that would be very interesting.

Marco

Hi,
that's what I've suggested with a ticket today.
Unfortunately I need to do the work for 1.8, unless 1.9 will be out before
the end of January...

I think the sublayer handling should be done at the provider level. What is
currently missing in QGIS is a notion of collection of layers. For example,
OGR has "data sources" (usually a directory, server connection etc) which
can be used for listing and accessing sublayers in a generic way - we need
something like this also for QGIS provider implementations. Some providers
already have some code going into this direction, but it's not exposed
under a common API (e.g. QgsVectorDataSource class) - there is
QgsPostgresConn or QgsSpatiaLiteConnection.

The support for data sources would be also very handy for generic
operations on layers (create, remove, rename).

Hi

I agree that it would be good to implement this idea.  However it
requires a few changes in the API.

Could this be done before 2.0, or after?  As it won't cause breakage
it probably would be ok to add afterwards. But I think that if it's
done after 2.0 not many plugins will use it.
However, this would probably be low in the priorities so it probably
won't make it.

I was perhaps thinking of a less complex way - a function which
returns a vector of QgsMapLayer given an uri, to replace
QgisApp::addMapLayers() but that is available outside of QgisApp.
Also the same for addVectorLayer() and addRasterLayer() (returning a
list of vector and raster layers, resp.)

Then this code could be migrated to proper QgsVectorDataSource /
QgsRasterDataSource when possible.

Which class could this go into?

Etienne

Message-ID: <50ACB60E.7000105@nordcomp.ru>

Hi, list!
QgsMapToolZoom::deactivate() deletes internal rubber band without call 
QgsMapTool::deactivate(). So, if you have button that associated with 
this tool, map canvas didnt uncheck it when another map tool set.
I think it should be something like:

virtual void QgsMapToolZoom::deactivate()
{
     delete mRubberBand;
     mRubberBand = 0;

     QgsMapTool::deactivate();
}

Correct me, if I`m wrong.

Both options are possible and I would be in favour of having it earlier
than later... maybe it will become apparent that some breakage would be
useful, so it would not need postponing until 3.0.

Anyway regarding usage of new APIs in plugins, I wouldn't be afraid that
plugin writers would not pick up new APIs. We have been introducing new
APIs in 1.x releases quite often and people could decide whether they will
prefer convenience of new APIs or compatibility with old versions.

Isn't such function just a step away from a simple data source class?
Because such function would be provider-specific anyway...

As a temporary solution you could just create a static method in
QgsOgrProvider class and create a unit test in c++ (as it would not be
available from python). But I would really like to encourage you to start
with data sources :-) The interface in the beginning could be as simple as:

class QgsDataSource
{
public:
  static QgsDataSource* open( QString baseUri, QString provider );

  QStringList layerNames() = 0;  // get list of sub-layers
  QString uriForLayer( QString layerName ) = 0; // return full provider URI
for a particular sub-layer
};

OGR provider would have its QgsDataSource implementation,
QgsDataSource::open(path, "ogr") would simply create an instance of OGR's
implmentation.

There is point of view (which I consider to be right) that implementation of
traditional
painting engine (like one in Qt, Cairo, GDI+) with one large Painter class
on the top of
AGG is totally inefficient because of the template architecture of this
library. Maybe much
more efficient approach will be implementation of light weighted wrapper of
AGG, which will
look like a system of classes for optimized rendering of spatial data.
However the absolute majority
of cases when you need really fast spatial data rendering is when you need
to display set of
large vector layers like rivers, lakes, elevation contours, coastline and so
on. Such kind of features
in cartography are expected to be displayed on the map by identical graphics 
symbols (lines of the same width and color, polygons withe same outline and
the same fill color and so on).
In such situation the most efficient approach is to minimize the number of
calls of rasterisation
algorithm (rasterize all identical graphics symbols at a time). This
definitely can be easily implemented
with the help of AGG. And what about Qt? I can mistake but it seems to me
that such classes 
as QPainter are often hardcoded things (Cairo's painter class is hardcoded).
So does Qt painting engine
have enough potential for optimized usage to be used for efficient spatial
data rendering?

However in my opinion (but I may mistake) rendering of spatial data is not
the main issue
in the terms of QGIS performance problem. It seems that main problem lies in
usage of GDAL/OGR,
which tendency to support great number of vector and raster data formats may
have negative influence
on its performance. Of course, it's possible to give users opportunity to
switch to another memory usage model (store all data in memory), furthermore
as I know QGIS Engine already has implementation of such technique for
vector data (QgsMemoryProvider). That will lead to significant improvement
of performance,
but in my opinion to make QGIS be competitive with proprietary GIS systems,
fast spatial data rendering system with efficient memory usage should be
implemented. So, are there any ideas about implementation of own QGIS
spatial data formats, or other possible ways to speed up process of reading
data from files?

I apologize in advance for my posts, because they may sound like criticism
of QGIS. Indeed I haven't used QGIS much. I work in commercial company,
which is planning to build its own GIS system only for internal work. The
key problem is that this system must be able to work fast with really large
raster and vector files. My boss doesn't want the system to be created from
scratch, he wants me to use some open source GIS platform. That's why I am
very interested in the real temps of QGIS Engine development, who and how
many developers really work on these problems? I also have investigated
situation around more fast gvSIG, but it is Java-based and unlike QGIS seems
not to have API for development of standalone GIS applications.

Also I would not pay attention for QGIS performance problems if I hadn't
keep in mind an example of one university experimental GIS development
project. It resulted in the development by one person of simple GIS
application with own vector data format and AGG based rendering, without
some complex systems of data caching or tricky techniques of reading data
from files, without thread support, built with old Borland ?++ compiler.
Some time ago I tested it and was really surprised to find that it worked a
bit slower the multithreaded gvSIG and much faster then QGIS.

I apologize for my post again, I have no aim to criticize QGIS. I believe it
to have great potential in improving of performance. I am only trying to
investigate the real situation. Are there real detailed 
plans for improvement of QGIS Engine? And what are the real opportunities of
QGIS community to implement these plans in program codes?

Tim and Marco, thank you for your replies.

Regards,
Oleg

Hi Victor,

I put a new patch for the bug #6545 Sextante doen't execute R command on 
Linux
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6545

If the solution is more robust, I think it will be interesting to apply 
the same changes to all the subprocess.Popen code.

But I saw that some changes like the join has been already done. I think 
the bug has to close.

Unfortunately, this does not seem to elicit much interest. I think we risk delaying
the 2.0 release if we do not deal with these issues effectively.
So, now:

- I have started our BfF account, we just have to add issues
- which of the blockers listed above should be added?
- for each, we need an estimate of the cost, and a person responsible for it.

Any taker?

All the best.

Is there any URL for this?

I would like to work on the website part, this would definitely help to
have the same look & feel in the plugins app.

no URL, I think we can do all in BfF, to avoid duplications.
I'll add tasks there as soon as I have the confirmation and estimate.

Thanks. This task should include also the migration of the content of current site to
the new structure, etc.
Help in writing the specs for each task is more than welcome.

All the best.

I can help with labeling, since I am already working on it. An
'overhaul' is a bit vague, but I assume you mean (at least) better
performance from the new engine. I can put together a concise listing
of what's needed to get current labeling changes/performance to a good
release-ready stage.

>>   * New web site and docs
>>   * SEXTANTE integration
>>   * Interface cleanup and consistency

I can help with the initial assessment and organization of what needs
cleaned up and made consistent (as I started here [0]). However, not
sure how much coding I can do, as I would prefer to focus on labeling
for this release.

>> Missing anything?

There was talk a while ago about funds for crowd-sourcing the design
of a new QGIS logo. While not a fix per se, maybe the process should
be started ASAP? Would be good to have a new logo for 2.0 release.

Similarly, it would be good to have only one icon set (Robert's GIS
theme?). If so, there will need to be some work done on achieving
that. A more complete/consistent icon look across the entire app would
be a nice addition to a major release like 2.0.

Regards,

Larry

Hi!
I'm also in favour of using the new GIS Theme!
Having Roberts Icons spread for the same functions across open source
GIS programs would help users to easily recognise functions again.

But to be honest I am not sure about letting the option to choose
another theme ..
Personaly I like the idea of having more options. But thats just my own
opinion.

kind regards
Werner

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xLAbWa-t6pCF7wxYutfOHPAsGUyFe581PNfQpiJ9RDRA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm not expert with the sip mechanism, so bear with me for the trivial
question.
I need QgsCredentials in my Python plugin, but the bindings are only
available in trunk.
Is it technically possible to add and use a sip binding -> python module,
that I would embed in my plugin deploy?

Message-ID: <1353596531591-5018190.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm testing --configpath option in master and 1.8. Behaviour is different
(Windows):
- 1.8: using -- configpath option moves only profile (.qgis. gdal param,
etc). Qsettings stay in system location (registry for Windows)
- 1.9: using -- configpath moves profile + registry. 

Is that normal behaviour? What is the real target ? 
I vote for 1.8 behaviour since using regedit tools to manage all users
parameters on different servers or PC is powerfull for admins. 

Do I open a ticket?

The current 1.9 master is the correct behavior. It is designed so that you
can have a portable self contained settings folder. This enables it to be
run from a USB without touching the users registry.

Thanks Nathan,
it helps me designing the right target. What about the two issues I
encounter (plugin install and QGIS_PLUGINPATH not used) ?

Correcting myself, QGIS_PLUGINPATH error was a false error due to the need
of restart to define environnement variable. Only first plugin install issue
remains

the revision you are compiling (2f3243d) is exactly before the commit
which broke compiling for me
can you please try it again with the latest master?

Hi,

I followed your suggestion and created a QgsDataSource class, which
has been sub-classed in ogr and gdal providers (with just a tad more
definitions).

I could use another piece of advise...

The app opens a dialog when there are sublayers, so the user can
choose which layer(s) are to be opened.

Ideally this should be called without too much effort, and the
following approaches could be used:

- add a gui class to get selected layers, takes as argument the QgsDataSource
- run this automatically from QgsDataSource (or the provider
subclasses) - but this would require a dependency on qgis_gui which is
not cool for core/provider. Also may not be advisable for simple
queries.

any thoughts?


Also one more point...

Data sources inside zip/tar files are supported in qgis through the
VSIFILE mechanism from gdal/ogr.
A zip file can contain a mixture or vector/raster files so I was
thinking of creating a (small and simple) provider for handling these
files, since they should not be handled by both (gdal and ogr)
providers for detecting valid datasets.
Returned sublayers list couls be a mixture of vector/raster datasets,
easily opened through full uri.

Also vsifile allows for many other "virtual" files such as remote
files (http/ftp) using /vsicurl/url_to_file syntax
Qgis could be extended eventually to support these other VSIFILE
types, hence the argument to make it a provider.

More information on VSIFILE:

ah ok I thought you meant having a container for various layers - but
you mean a wrapper for the layer URIs that are inside a given data
source.

I answer myself: it's impossible to wrap the QgsCredentials instance
outside of the Qgis application...

Hi all.
I'm ready to start the BidforFix. If anyone is interested in fixing one of the
issues, please provide me:
- a short description of the task (a few lines)
- an URL with more detailed explanation of the job to be done, and the expected
results for the project
- a target in $ (actually in ? it would be more appropriate, since most of our donors
are European, but apparently this is a limitation of BfF).
If nobody replies, this initiative will be stopped.
All the best.

Hmm... but we still have deprecated methods in API and didn't switch
to PyQt API v2. Or this task should go as separate?

Please try to be more specific about each point, otherwise there will be a
lot of confusion what should be the result of each point. Is
symbology/labeling overhaul just about removing old symbology/labeling?
Isn't sextante integrated already?

Also, I'm wondering about one thing: if the money is going to be donated to
the eveloper who volunteers for a particular project, wouldn't it be better
if the developer started the bidforfix for him/herself and QGIS project
would just promote the campaign on the web and among the users?

In my opinion this is the way how these crowdsourcing campaigns should
work: I am a developer motivated to implement particular project, so I will
create a campaign and hope that enough money will be raised. Other people
from QGIS community (if interested) will help to spread the word about this
campaign. If sufficient amount of money is raised, I will implement the
feature and I get the money. If I fail to deliver the project, it is my
failure.

Doing it other way round (QGIS project owns the campaigns) has some
disadvantages:
- there is a question who is eligible to get money from such campaign -
anyone or just a particular group of people?
- it is a responsibility of a developer to accomplish the project, so for a
failed project QGIS community may be blamed
- the philosophy of bidforfix is that users evaulate and then pay the
developer. If a campaign is driven by QGIS project, who decides when the
project is finished? When the money should be sent to developer? What about
the risk that some users change their mind and do not pay?

Martin

Hi Marin,
this mine was meant as a reminder: we have discussed about these points rather
extensively in Essen. I have my ideas on several of these points, but I think there
are people better suited than me to explain in detail what has to be done.

Yes, your approach also makes sense. I have been asked for feedback for that.
I have no special preferences, I just note a few issues with your approach:

- if the issues are subprojects of qgis, donors may feel more comfortable knowing
that it is the core team who acts as an umbrella
- if an unreliable dev jumps out and suggests weird things, this would make things
much more confused for potential donors
- in case users change their mind, and is proves impossible to find replacements, the
project could use some of its internal resources to keep the dev happy.

I think we can ask BfF people or some of other projects (e.g. OSMAnd) for advice.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I'm proud to annonce that you can test the QGIS-Server WFS capabilities 
on these demos :
http://demo.3liz.com/wfst/

The QGIS-Server install on our server is based on the master.
You can test the WFS service with this url :
http://demo.3liz.com/wfst/proxy.php
The data are stored in a spatialite database. I have saved the database 
and will replace it every night.

Any feedback are welcome.

Cheers,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Hi,

I mean filter in a first step but I will creating WFS-T demos.
You can already test WFS-T with QGIS or other GIS software.
We need feedback.

Hi,

I have worked on implementing this, please give me any comments.

https://github.com/etiennesky/Quantum-GIS/tree/browser_scanitems

There a few few things missing (like error messages) and a few rough
edges, but it works for opening vector, raster and zip datasets in
commandline, file open as well as file browser.
I have not tested for providers other than gdal and ogr.

Yes, I agree with this approach and it's how BidforFix is envisioned
to work. qgis should be an umbrella, guaranteeing the quality of the
work and declaring the issues fixed and released (or not).

The target should have substantial margin (25%) so that even if a
couple of people decide to withdraw their bids in the last moment, or
are unreachable the rest should keep the dev happy. In general, this
is new territory so the participants should be comfortable with some
degree of uncertainty.

However, our experience shows that the atmosphere around the campain
is quite positive and boths sides usually try to do their best.

Best regards,
Tibor

Hey R?gis,

Just wondering if you ever made any progress in this, or are still
interested.  I was thinking about this the other day and remembered you
brought it up a while ago.

I was thinking about having a look at what would be required to do
something like this.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Nathan,
well, I postponed fundings for this to 2013 because of all discussions about
2.0 and feature freeze in december. I was stuck with QGIS 1.8 deployment
with profile problems (--configpath KO with plugin install, and symbolic
links to cheat it in Windows Server.. really sucks!). I focused then on
urgencies like performances on shape (network only), crashes of composer... 

I'm still extremely interested, and this could allow us to go to very nice
interfaces for bivariate analysis (size + colour + choice of regression type
sqrt, ln, linear.. )

If your still interested, and if PSC member agree that it's OK working on
new features for 2.1.. I 'm ready to help for user specifications and maybe
fundings (better to discuss it on private mails). 
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Translations - using the online pootle interface
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6RBuhn_Mbtt==QNaEisWCtueaVU3M=k6KAwqaYiJvBBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have subscribed to the translate.qgis.org web application. I would like
to have a quick and easy access to correct some mistakes (mistranslations)
in the QGIS application.

I thought this website was meant to allow non developers to help us
translate the QGIS application. But it seems I am wrong. It appeared
translate.qgis.org "only" allow translation of the documentation. So I will
use git to contribute to QGIS translation instead of pootle.

Another thing : it seems only our italian friends are active in the pootle
application : this only files I could find are the italian part of QGIS
documentaiton :
http://translate.qgis.org/it/qgis/LC_MESSAGES/

Thanks for your help.

Michael

The GUI is still to be translated with qt-linguist. I don't know if it
will be possible sometime to integrate GUI translation also in pootle.
Last time I tried it the support for .ts files (which the GUI is using)
was not very good.

kind regards
Werner

Hi,

I also think the QtLinguist application is the best way to translate ts
files. I was more looking for a very easy and quick online way. Not for me,
but for example for people I met during courses willing to help to correct
some wrong translations in an easy way. At present the only thing I can
tell them is "Please send me an email with corrected sentences, and I will
integrate them asap"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Forum complaints idea
Message-ID: <50B23116.2030203@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all,
yesterday I landed on [0] where a yet another user complains that we
have no forum. Anita suggests him:
"You could point them [his coworkers] to the QGIS forum on Nabble
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Quantum-GIS-f4099105.html"

so I thought that we might as well link that page from our get help
page. we could even "hide" it behind an easier url. We'd get all people
on the mailing list (as wanted) but we'd show our "own" forum without
any overhead.

Just an idea.
ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Webclient now offers a theme switcher
Message-ID: <5df334d9b235fa38b0bfd022211d6196@carto.net>

 Hi,

 QGIS web client now offers a theme switcher. There is a new "map 
 themes" button on the top-left, above the layer tree. Users can filter 
 available maps by topic, title or keywords/tags. Projects are stored in 
 json-format in site/js/GISProjectListing.js - a template is provided. 
 You also need to create thumbnails for the theme topics.

 You can see the new theme switcher at http://gis.uster.ch/

 We updated the documentation to explain the data format of 
 GISProjectListing.js

 Please note that there are a number of new variables in 
 site/js/GlobalOptions.js - many of these variables are required - please 
 update from the template files.

 Please also note that the newest QGIS map client uses a new QGIS server 
 command called "GetProjectSettings" - which is an extension of the 
 "GetCapabilities" command. So please upgrade QGIS server along with QGIS 
 web client. If you can't upgrade QGIS server, there is now an option 
 where you can force QGIS web client to use "GetCapabilities" instead of 
 "GetProjectSettings". Over time this will disappear.

 -------------

 There are now also license headers in the js files and a more complete 
 license and contributors in the README.

 ------------

 Thanks to all contributors (esp. Mathias Walker and Bernhard Str?bl) 
 and translators.

 Andreas

Hey Andreas,

That looks really good.  I really like how it has the thumbnail images on
the side.

 ---------------

 Is there a way to compile without QwtPlot. I assume that QGIS server 
 doesn't need it? I haven't found the appropriate compile option for 
 suppressing the usage of QwtPlot.

 Alternatively I searched for all qwt-related ubuntu packages and they 
 are all installed, incl. QwtPlot.

 Strange ... if you have any hints how I get it to compile, please let 
 me know.

 Andreas

Hi!

I once had the problem that libqwt-dev and libqwt6 was installed..  but
there is only libqwt5-qt4-dev as a binding ..
for me it compiled without problems but segfaulted during usage ..
maybe you have a similar problem?

regards
Werner

Hi Andreas

It compiles on my 10.04 installation. I do remind that ccmake finds a wrong libqwt sometimes. Please check cmake:

QWT_INCLUDE_DIR: /usr/include/qwt-qt4
QWT_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libqwt-qt4.so

And NOT

QWT_LIBRARY:  /usr/lib/libqwt.so

Regards
Stefan

 Hi Stefan and Werner,

 Thanks a lot for your quick answers. Stefans hint about the QWT_LIBRARY 
 fixed my issue.

 All fine now.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Post processing task for GRASS algorithms
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xYvB8-N70Ffu0LEbsMyxV_66DhsHywkHF23c_A=3X_1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am considering adding some post processing for algorithms from
external apps, like GRASS ones. My idea is that if the algorithm needs
something extra thing to be done (for instance, parsing output text
and formatting it with the interesting values in case the process
prints valuable information to the console, or creating output objects
if it generates an undefined number of layers), an additional python
file with the name of the algorithm and the additional processing
method could be added.

I am probably writing down the base ideas for that, but it will then
need work to be done for each "special" algorithm. Is it realistic to
think that this work will be done sometime soon? do you think it is a
good idea to do this?

Thanks for your help!

Victor

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Get rid of Shapefiles ! Go GeoJSON !
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7gs3KTtWTF0QK1tj3himMnOqfu7EvF7Wg33n0VLJHhGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

The subject is a bit polemical, on purpose. I am used to playing with
Postgis, spatialite and GeoJson, which are all open-source ways to store
spatial data.

I am very frustrated by the limitations of the Shapefile format, and much
more by the quasi obligation to use it as the default vector format in
QGIS. I mean for non power users who do not use PostGIS or spatialite.

Correct me if I am wrong, but Shapefile is at present the only non database
format QGIS can edit, speaking of structure : columns addition and
deletion, etc.
But Shapefile is very limited in my point of view compared to database
storage : I cannot rename a column, my column name are truncated to keep
under 10 letters, etc.

I would love to see GeoJSON (and potentially topoJson [1] ) as the format
officially used by QGIS. I am always confused during courses when I spend
time learning people how to adapt to Shapefile limitations. And the users
can be a bit puzzled to use Shapefile coming from ESRI with an opensource
software. I know OCG reckon Shapefile as a standard format...but still...

Some work has to be done to be able to use GeoJSON in QGIS the way I want:
* GeoJson can have multiple geometry types in the same files / QGIS cannot
handle them  -> not a big deal, let use only one geometry type per geojson
file
* We must write down a specific driver which handle it --> doing so, we
would have a very powerful tool, and we could implement topoJson to improve
performance (and add the ability to create a spatial index too)

What I would like to be able to do
* open a GeoJSON, and edit it with QGIS
* Modify the structure with no limitations :
- long column names if I want to (I prefer to choose myself and can be wise
enough not to use something crazy)
- rename columns
- reorder columns
- change a column type from string to integer, float/integer, whatever if
the data is compatible, warn if not possible
- etc.

I would love to hear from you about this idea. Am I the only one frustrated
by the current situation ?

Cheers,
Michael

Hi Michael, 
some questions about geoJSON, I'm no specialist.. does GeoJson support
spatial indexes? Isn't it a bit more space consuming with all the xml tags
inside.. Does it support compression? 

A remark on the-fly, when MITAB will be modified to support edition, you
could have a file format that does what you want. I know some people are
willing to fund developpement to do it.. Not open source, but efficient
format.

 Why is spatialite seen as a "power user" option when ESRI users have
been using something similar for years? Its just a file, you connect
to it, you add spatial data to it.

 GeoJSON is always going to be pretty verbose unless you gzip it - I
wouldn't want to use it for anything too big.

Geojson is not a XML format, but you are right, the colums names are
repeated for each features :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON
http://www.geojson.org/

I have not yet search how we could build a spatial index from a GeoJSON,
but we surely could find a way.
It supports GZIP compression, as it is a simple text file,  and we could
use it as QGIS can now handle zipped files.

You are right, but I am looking for an open-source format. :)

Yes, but people are used to having one file (or set of files) per layers.
This is what I was meaning with the GeoJSON. You have only one file per
layer.

Why not zipping it ? We can use the new ability of QGIS to use zipped
files. I think the driver could unzip/write/zip anytime the user commit
changes.

Well, I have not said I had the ultimate solution :)  Just one big
frustration against shapefiles ...

Hello,

I agreed with all you said, I am sure Spatialite format is the future of 
Geo"file" format:
* easy to share (one file)
* easy to use, edit
* a lot of better capabities than Shapefile
* use same OGC Standard as PostGIS does

Hi Yves,

I totally agree with you and Bary on the superiority of spatialite VS
GeoJson considering performance, geoprocessing methods, capabilities, etc.
But I am still not sure beginner would be comfortable enough using Sqlite
to replace Shapefiles. I think they will be more comfortable with the idea
to keep the one layer / one file architecture. They can off course use one
sqlite file containing only one layer, so this question could be answered.

But still, I think users should be able to use the "Field" tab of the layer
properties dialog to easily edit the layer structure, not another dedicated
tool in another QGIS menu (or plugin)
We could probably find a way to use the tools of the Fields tab to modify
the structure of the related sqlite table. This would help a lot people to
use more the spatialite format, no ?

I need more thinking :)

Thanks all for your comments

Hi again

I am coming back after more thinking :). I changed the subject into Go
Spatialite !

List of modifications which would help to use spatialite instead of
Shapefile as the default format :

* Create a new vector layer : should allow to choose between shapefile and
Spatialite. Let the use choose an existing spatialite connection or easily
create a new spatialite file and connection, and create a new table there.
* Tab fields, if the layer provider is spatialite :
 - add the ability to delete columns : currently it is not possible
 - add the ability to rename a column with the appropriate SQL command
- add the ability to change the type of a column when it is possible

* Tab General
 - add the ability to create/remove a spatial index for spatialite tables,
as QSpatialite does

* FTools and another vector processing tools :
 - add the ability to choose between shapefile and spatialite to create the
processed layers.

I think it would be a big break for QGIS if we facilitate more the use of
spatialite. I know it is already possible to achieve many things with
DBManager or QSpatialite, but we could help the users by letting them edit
spatialite tables without a dedicated tool.

Cheers

Michael

I agree too, and it's being more and more used behind other software.

However, with all the formats that GDAL/OGR provides to QGIS, behind the scenes, wouldn't it make more sense to abstract editable data types and allow the user to set their default preferred format in QGIS?  OGR, for example, already provides this kind of abstraction for the QGIS db providers and elsewhere.  If other tools and plugins could build toward a similar approach, that would be useful, plus it would alleviate the "best format" argument ;)

Hi,
+1
This direction from my view is more correct course of action - make the 
use of spatialite more easy and ergonomic for users as it is now and in 
case of success it will be used more and more.

Hi Michael

+1 from my part.

To me Spatialie is "the shapefile of the future" since 2010 (see e.g. FOSS4G)

Hello all,

+1 for Spatialite

You can also have a look on Geopackages announcement at OGC e.g
http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/1710
It seems to be a future standard for geospatial data

It seems that now one has about the same functions on both the new

zipped files are only supported in read-only access - read/write is
supported for gzipped files only. This is a limitation of the VSIFILE
mechanism offered by gdal

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/ReadInZip

Unzipping/reading/writing/zipping would have to be implemented inside qgis.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis 1.8 Custom Feature Form
Message-ID: <CAMFSZzqa7xv75aetJ7VnzAB0ZTyaTN2kX+472KhOpO8_1cjpmA@mail.gmail.com>

I am developing a plugin, which uses a custom feature form with custom
logic.
The problem is that when I open the project (Automatic with the load of the
plugin) and I try to open the feature form I get an import error that the
module doesn't exist.

If I click the save project button, and then try to open the feature form
it works correctly.
I have tried to trigger this save in the plugin code. The save works
correctly, but unless I specifically click on the action, I get the same
error.

Am I missing something?

It would probably be helpful if you can provide enough sample code that
someone could replicate your problem, or at the least cut and past text of
error messages so we can get a better idea of what is going on.

I'm for abstraction too. It's pretty annoying to get prompted for
a shapefile filename everytime you ask qgis to make an operation.
It'd be much better to keep the layers in memory and ask the user
for the format on close (want to save ? which format ?).

Spatialite would make a good default.

OGR, for example, already provides this kind of abstraction for the QGIS db providers and elsewhere.  If other tools and plugins could build toward a similar approach, that would be useful, plus it would alleviate the "best format" argument ;)

Hi Tim

Thank you. Good idea. Here is a screenshot of the form init code,
[image: Inline image 1]
Here is also the code that executes just after loading the project. It is
in the plugin run method.
[image: Inline image 2]
If I zoom to a feature and click on it. and open the feature form, I get
the following error messages:
[image: Inline image 3]
[image: Inline image 4]
then the form loads, but obviously without executing the code in the init
function.
If I use the menu button to save the project / the shortcut key (Ctrl + S)

I hope that this makes sense.

Mmm it reminds me of an old discussion about memory layers and how to save
them along the project. three options where discussed:

1. first method implemented in Memory Layers Saver plugin: gml+xsd. verbose,
two files, and we encountered changes in GDAL behaviour about FID field (not
exposed and then exposed to conform to GML). This change broke all tools
that dealed with new labeling, which stores parameters based on field id's
and not their name (bad.. like Mapinfo, we should change that)

2. use a spatialite file along the qgs file storing all memory layers, or
even, a container (zip or spatialite) containing project and data. I must
say this is the good theorical target, but spatialite is moving fast..
Dealing with data type conversions, library version adds incompatibility
hazards, compared to an old and very stable format

3. use Qt serializing capacities with QDataStream. That's what is done in
Chris Crook new Memory Layer Saver. 

After some months after thoses discussions, this came up to me:
- QGIS 1.8 standalone is pretty broken with spatialite versions.. not yet
rock stable then.
- shp is not performing well when stored on a network.. rock stable but not
yet OK for most users. Limitations on character size is annoying and the
origin of many bugs
- shp is very loose on data types (text, integer, numeric + precision). This
is good for newbies, bad for advanced users . In the opposite spatialite is
more restrictive, so it can be more difficult to use for newcomers. 

Conclusions:
we have some work remaining to consolidate both shp and sqlite. Maybe we
should concentrate our efforts on the existing, thant on new things a bit.
I'm trying to fund someone to work on shp issues, and 
 I vote for sqlite as preferd format. Supporting correctly GeoJSON correctly
with all tools and alike)  will take some time(tools to handle structure,
performances, size for big datasets). Last thing... spatialite can produce
geojson very simply, while the opposite is not true. I always prefer more
versatile formats.

Thoughts?

SQlite (Spatialite) is a database with data types which are as loose
as they can get!
What do you mean by saying Spatialite is more restrictive (than
shp/dbase data types)?

I totally agree too.
Spatialite is growing rapidly. As you know it has also got the support for
Android right in these days.
I think a tighter integratio in QGis would easily find the financial
support for its development...

Well, I think it IS a "power user" option as long as things output only to shapefile, after which the user needs to perform an extra step to import to spatialite.  This discussion on abstraction is good to see.

Users won't perform the extra step unless they have a motivation to do so.  Personally I have only used spatialite a couple of times, when I needed to perform special queries.  And these queries are also very much for "power users" - the user isn't confronted by any documentation telling them about the cool stuff they can do (and how to do it), so people are most likely to do it only after googling to solve a particular problem.

If you don't need to run a special query or something, does spatialite have major benefits?  Do these need some publicity?
Things like the length of field names seem pretty minor to me...

And maybe this is a little off topic, but does anyone else have trouble with the implementation of spatialite in qgis?
In my experience it is very slow (takes 6 hours to save as or import a layer to spatialite, when ogr2ogr takes less than 5 minutes), and tends to be accompanied by a series of frightening error/warning messages.

Regards,
Alister

Giving my 2 cents as "user": Postgis is too complex/abstract to set up and  
use for noobs, shape files suck, spatialite seems to be the perfect mix  
(portability)(if there only would be understandable documentations and at  
least SOME examples how to use it in a workflow).

In my experience, spatialite is much faster and more reliable with bigger  
datasets. Had to classify 30.000 polygons via field calculator and did  
this in multiple steps. As a shape file, qgis crashed, froze, took ages,  
while in spatialite it just worked smoothly.

You just should not use Qspatialite to import shapes. I nearly gave up  
upon spatialite, when i figured out that i had to use the Spatialite GUI  
instead and this was fast as hell.
So at the moment, you have to work with Spatialite GUI to import shapes,  
then use Qspaltialite to push them into QGIS and repeat that shit on every  
major action (ftools e.g.). Not really convenient, so its no wonder that  
not many people seem to use it so far.
Would really love to see much more spatialite support in QGIS. And when i  
grow up, i will learn this sql- stuff and everything will be fine ;)

Why not using DB Manager?

I do not think users like to switch between different programs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding a project as a reference
Message-ID: <50B46D1E.5090902@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I don't know if this idea has been raised or not, a quick google search 
did not lead to anything.

I wonder if it would be feasible to introduce the option of adding a 
project as a reference, as you can do in autocad.
Basically, this would be a new type of layer, where you could specify 
the scale visibility for example. Layers do not need to be editable and 
they shouldn't.

The advantage is that you can insert a "base" project into many children 
project. The base layers will be regrouped into one.

Anybody ever thought about this?
Do you have any idea of the amount of work?

Thanks a lot

Denis

 Hi Denis,

 We have the embedded layers and groups. You can select another QGIS 
 project and pick the groups and layers you want. It is a live link. I 
 use this feature to integrate the cadastral data in pretty much any of 
 my other projects.

 It does not allow to change any settings on the layers (e.g. different 
 min/max scales) - but other than that it works great.

 Did you have a look at this feature?

 Andreas

Just a note on the difficulty of Spatialite rather then shapefiles.
I often work with commercial softwares, and most of thems let the user work
seamlessly with local geodatabases (many of them use the MDB format), and I
see it's not so strange for GIS users to use them rather then shapefiles to
organize and share their data.
The OS version of this kind of data management would naturally be
Spatialite.

You are right, I didn't check well enough. Data types are loose. One more
reason to go to spatialite. 
Thanks for correcting me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Complex symbology: multiple classifications for
 different graphical variables
Message-ID: <43944e5b6d81573e7764d40c4324888a@carto.net>

 Hi,

 In many of my projects I need to do several classifications for 
 different graphical variables, like fill-color, stroke-color, size, 
 orientation, etc.

 As an example I need to represesent manholes where the symbol shape 
 (SVG) is based on manhole type, the symbol stroke colors based on the 
 usage, and the size based on dimensions.

 I know that it is currently possible to reach this goal by either

 * using the rule based renderer - it would result in a lot of rules or 
 refined rules - a lot of work
 * or concatenating the three attribute values into one attribute and 
 using the unique value renderer - but this results in many, many 
 combinations. Too many classes to handle.

 So my question/suggestion:

 Can we introduce multiple parallel/simultaneous categorized 
 classifications where each attributes controls one visual variable?

 I don't know how one could display a legend then with such parallel 
 classifications ... but other than that it would be more convenient for 
 the user.

 There may also be technical issues making this impossible.

 Any thoughts on this?

 Andreas

 hm - I am not sure if loose data types are really an advantage. I like 
 the more stricter handling of PostgreSQL better where you can constraint 
 the data the user enters by stricter data types. In SQLite you can store 
 all sort of unexpected crap into the fields. I know, you could do check 
 constraints in SQLite, but it requires more work.

 So to me personally, looser data types are a disadvantage. There is a 
 reason why 90% of all databases have stricter data types.

Hi Andreas

You are completely right if you are using the database as a
(centralized) data management store.
But to me, when one is speaking about a "desktop storage and exchange
format" it's an advantage when it's not so strict.
At least SQlite/Spatialite (compared to shp) is a single file and
offers attribute names which are self-explanatory (meaning longer than
8 chars).

+1 I had this requirement too. But I can also imagine that this might
get very tricky to implement - at least GUI-wise. In my opinion it
would already help a lot if we could have data-defined styling.

So far, I've solved these problems by writing a script that creates
all combinations of rules but that's not an option for casual users.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for the reply.
I did not know this feature, which is basically what I asked ;) Great!

I am just facing a few problems. When adding a group, a box appears with 
std::bad_alloc and qgis crashes a few times (both 1.8 and master).
Also, not all the layers I select are loaded.

Any ideas on something wrong?

Thanks again,

Denis

Could you open a ticket in the bugtracker and add a small sample project?

Hi,
Not sure if its related and/or relevant for this issue, but Sextante has
also been affected by "std::bad_alloc error":

Best regards

Yes I agree this would be very handy and something I was thinking about how
to tackle today.  Larry has been working on some stuff for the data-defined
labels to make it easier to use from the UI and the code so I'm thinking we
can use the same code for that in the symbols.

I would also like to be able to bind controls together, things like fill
and outline so they always stay in sync.  I have a few ideas how this could
work so I'm going to try and have a go at some stage, or at least draft up
the idea more.

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xdpPq1+Aat6WHJe+yW-+86HBHjmMrhD+8+_3wZrr-mpQ@mail.gmail.com>

I need to replicate the theming of a vector layer to another one.
I thought that cloning the oringinal renderer (being it V2 or not) and
applying it to other layer would be enough, but id doesn't have effects.
The other layer is applied the default (random) styling.
Probably I've misunderstood the renderer mechanism. How should one procede
to obtain it?

I see what's going wrong.
Setting the renderer affects the subsequent renderings. If I pan/zoom I see
the new renderer is being used, though the legend is'n updated. I think the
legend should be kept synchronized with the renderer, doesn't it?

Well, i can't figure out for what i can use it in my workflow other than  
loading a layer into Qgis.

Indeed! I do not like it either, but this gives the best results so far  
(and the only results when i work with bigger datasets). Thats why  
improved spatialite support (in whatever way) would be really much  
appreciated.

Hi all,

One thing to add to our feature list is the ability to do the following :
* use the menu "Add a vector layer"
* choose a sqlite file
* a dialog with all tables contained in this file pops up and let the user
choose one
* load the layer (spatial or not) in QGIS


By the way, we in 3liz would love to spend some time implementing some of
these ideas to ease the use of Spatialite in QGIS. The main goal is the
ability to avoid the opening of the sqlite connection manager to do the
basics : open a layer, create a layer in a file (existing or not), saving a
layer, etc.
If someone can fund this work, I can write down a wiki page with some ideas
so that people can read/modify it.

Cheers,

Michael

As long as users have the choice, that's fine.
I'm working with organisations with a very significant Arc server based GIS infrastructure, & am encouraging QGIS as a client for staff desktop use. This is not an uncommon situation, & QGIS needs to be viable for such use, & at least Arc compatible, if not Arc friendly. SpatiaLite, despite all it's advantages, is inappropriate here.

Hi Brent

Your point is very common and I understand this situation.
But the ArcGIS SW suite doesn't really make interoperability easy and tends
to maintain a vendor lock-in.
My proposal is to break this deadlock by programming an free ArcGIS desktop
extension which reads/writes Spatialite.
Any volunteers?

Hi Stefan,
I think QGIS users are more likely to seek interoperability with other systems than ESRI users. So making ESRI work with QGIS via SpatialLite is probably not something that offers ESRI users much benefit, they'll probably be?using ESRI file geodatabases instead.
I believe QGIS will achieve more traction by working well with Arc,and seamlessly within an Arc environment, than the other way around.?So while I have no problem with enhanced support for SpatiaLite for QGIS (&?Arc), this should not be at the expense of shapefile support.
And for improved ESRI interoperability. given how ESRI provides (deliberately?) such poorly performing OGC web service support that ESRI users tend to?use the ESRI restful services instead, is QGIS/GDAL support for ESRI's native web services at all likely?

As long as users have the choice, that's fine.
I'm working with organisations with a very significant Arc server based GIS infrastructure, & am encouraging QGIS as a client for staff desktop use. This is not an uncommon situation, & QGIS needs to be viable for such use, & at least Arc compatible, if not Arc friendly. SpatiaLite, despite all it's advantages, is inappropriate here.

For what it's worth... I'm in a ESRI+QGIS environment. I feel QGIS should
obvioulsy improve spatialite usage. It should be intuitive and easy to
create, save, export spatialite layers.

For ESRI I can always convert to shapefile, like I have to do when going
from ESRI to QGIS. Hopefully as SL's adoption grows ESRI will pick it up. We
can't wait for them though...

Best,
Duarte

Hi,
Try-ing to supporto esri arcgis will introduce other and bigger problems.

We have many trouble due to the convention of esri for the hole that
are touching the boundary of a polygon.

The esri product will trasform this in a not OGC compatibile structure.
That on a OGC system is defined Invalid.
So when a dataset with hole is touched from a esri arcgis it could
became invalid for OGC.

This is so a problem for us that we fund a change to postgis to have a
ST_IsValid with a flag for compatibily with esri gemetries.

QGIS is absolutely unuseful try to follow Arcgis if QGIS himself also
don't support this different structure of polygons with hole on
boundaries.

Regards,

I just exposed QgisApp's mActionCopyStyle and mActionPasteStyle to
QgisInterface [0]. Is this what you are looking for (in Python)?

Usage:

  iface.setActiveLayer( someQgsMapLayer )
  iface.actionCopyLayerStyle().trigger()

  iface.setActiveLayer( someotherQgsMapLayer )
  iface.actionPasteLayerStyle().trigger()

Hi agin

Surely I did not mean to drop Shapefile support ! We must let the user
choose. But now, as ESRI Shapefile is the simplest/default way (yet
limited) to create/edit layers, we "force" the users to use it, which I
dislike for reasons written previously.
I think sqlite could be a great alternative. It has some limitations, but
improves as time passes. We "just" need to modify QGIS tools to deal with
sqlite file more smoothly as discussed before.

Regards
Michael

Hi Larry.
I've done it programmatically, passing the renderer clone (V2 or not) to
the other layer, updating the legendlayer and refreshing the canvas. I
suppose those actions will trigger a similar flow of things.
In my case it wouldn't be enough because I should avoid changing the
activeLayer. In my method I pass the layer reference...

thanks anyway, because it's a useful GUI tool ;)

It's hard to discuss AGG vs Qt rendering performance without benchmarks on
real data. As far as I know, Qt has fairly optimized rendering, see:

http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2009/12/18/qt-graphics-and-performance-the-raster-engine/
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/qpainter.html - Performance section

Qt has modular painting system, so you could try give it a try and
implement a paint engine based on AGG, but I do not believe that would make
a difference - there are other areas that need more attention.

Currently I see the greatest bottleneck in access to data. First of all, we
do not have in-memory caching, so the data are fetched from data source
everytime we render a map. Efficiency of GDAL/OGR could also be improved in
some cases, but it really depends on what data format you are going to use.
Apart from GDAL/OGR, QGIS has native data providers for PostGIS, SpatiaLite
and other sources which is supposed to give us more flexibility, faster
access and better control since there is one layer less.

I have been measuring the performance of vector layer rendering some time
ago and it varies greatly on three levels:
- data source type (shapefile / database layer / ...)
- layer type (geometry type, number of vertices per geometry, number of
attributes, ...)
- renderer type (using attributes? antialiasing? thick lines?)

Of course there are some areas worth improving also in QGIS to lower the
amount of time spent in QGIS libraries while rendering and to make life
easier to the rendering engine (e.g. simplify polygons with lots of
vertices before rendering them).

Building an own GIS system on top of QGIS is something that is perfectly
possible and may result in fruitful cooperation: your company can save
large amount of money that would be spent on initial development and may
focus just to specific areas important for your company.

We would be very happy to see any patches that would improve the
performance :-)

I'm currently working on getting some changes in libraries done in
preparation for version 2.0 which hopefully will bring also rendering in
threads (I have worked on that during GSoC 2010, but did not get it
merged). See my reports from GSoC:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/QGIS_on_steroids_GSoC_2010

Otherwise, there are no detailed plans for improvements of rendering speed
- I encourage you to give QGIS a try, evaluate where the speed is lacking
your needs and tell us your findings - you could even find some sponsors
willing to invest money into some performance improvements (or share the
development costs)!

Of course everyone is welcome to suggest improvements and provide patches,
so there are lots of opportunities. QGIS core team is receptive to patches
from other community members. When starting a greater development that
should be merged to QGIS source code, it is a good idea to let the team
know - we can help with design decisions and it also lowers the probability
that more people work independently on the same thing.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for the report, but I cannot confirm this either.

Can you maybe sent me the data you are using, or more information about 
the type of geometries you are using as the output layer?
Or maybe you have some special characters in filename or attributes or so?
You are not using Python 3 are you?

It's almost done (i.e. just read, not write Spatialtie).

AmigoCloud's GDAL/OGR Plugin for ArcGIS.

It reads from Spatialtie and other formats at the moment.

Hi

You probably need to manipulate your sys.path to ensure that your form is
visible to python at plugin start, or move your form into the same
directory as your project file.

Hi Marco, hi all,

Not sure there is that much info but I created this issue
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6765

Apparently, this comes from two specific layers in the project I try to 
embed.
And I get this error:

ERROR 10: Pointer 'hDS' is NULL in 'OGR_DS_Destroy'.

But QGIS is not crashing.

Do you have any idea where it could come from? Or what it means?

Thanks!

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG symbol loading problem in master
Message-ID: <46b870f4af7663708526d6876e73373b@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I am using master with code revision 
 (b9b943d5e1580bdc17435598dd5be41eb0c2a853) from yesterday.

 I noticed that SVG symbols do not load correctly anymore. One can 
 select the symbols correctly and save them - they are saved correctly, 
 but on the next project load it cannot find the symbol reference 
 anymore.

 Is this a side-effect of 
 https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/454c732a3ddd90f3eedba804f4cc07ac1af8113f

 where brushtyler worked on SVG symbol loading from URL?

 Thank you for having a look at this issue.

 Andreas

LS,

Forgive my lack of knowledge if this reaction does not cover the renderproblem.

Though I'm not a developer I have been wondering a long time why QGIS is so much slower than other GIS-applications like ArcGIS, DivaGIS and MapWindow.
I've posed the question before and got some workarounds like PostGis.

On the post mentioned below I have posted my test results

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6448

Somehow QGIS (on windows?) needs to upload the .dbf file to the client instead of opening it on the remote server.

I have asked several people (both GDAL and QGis) but I have not had any clear confirmation or denial that the above is the case and how and where this action is taken within the software.

Once the .dbf file is loaded rendering is swift as a bird.

Hope someone can tell me whether or not this QGIS behaviour is intended or not and / or if this behaviour can be redesigned to opening the .dbf file on the remote server.


Best regard,

Hans Windm?ller

It's hard to discuss AGG vs Qt rendering performance without benchmarks on
real data. As far as I know, Qt has fairly optimized rendering, see:

http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2009/12/18/qt-graphics-and-performance-the-raster-engine/
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/qpainter.html - Performance section

Qt has modular painting system, so you could try give it a try and
implement a paint engine based on AGG, but I do not believe that would make
a difference - there are other areas that need more attention.

Currently I see the greatest bottleneck in access to data. First of all, we
do not have in-memory caching, so the data are fetched from data source
everytime we render a map. Efficiency of GDAL/OGR could also be improved in
some cases, but it really depends on what data format you are going to use.
Apart from GDAL/OGR, QGIS has native data providers for PostGIS, SpatiaLite
and other sources which is supposed to give us more flexibility, faster
access and better control since there is one layer less.

I have been measuring the performance of vector layer rendering some time
ago and it varies greatly on three levels:
- data source type (shapefile / database layer / ...)
- layer type (geometry type, number of vertices per geometry, number of
attributes, ...)
- renderer type (using attributes? antialiasing? thick lines?)

Of course there are some areas worth improving also in QGIS to lower the
amount of time spent in QGIS libraries while rendering and to make life
easier to the rendering engine (e.g. simplify polygons with lots of
vertices before rendering them).

Building an own GIS system on top of QGIS is something that is perfectly
possible and may result in fruitful cooperation: your company can save
large amount of money that would be spent on initial development and may
focus just to specific areas important for your company.

We would be very happy to see any patches that would improve the
performance :-)

I'm currently working on getting some changes in libraries done in
preparation for version 2.0 which hopefully will bring also rendering in
threads (I have worked on that during GSoC 2010, but did not get it
merged). See my reports from GSoC:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/QGIS_on_steroids_GSoC_2010

Otherwise, there are no detailed plans for improvements of rendering speed
- I encourage you to give QGIS a try, evaluate where the speed is lacking
your needs and tell us your findings - you could even find some sponsors
willing to invest money into some performance improvements (or share the
development costs)!

Of course everyone is welcome to suggest improvements and provide patches,
so there are lots of opportunities. QGIS core team is receptive to patches
from other community members. When starting a greater development that
should be merged to QGIS source code, it is a good idea to let the team
know - we can help with design decisions and it also lowers the probability
that more people work independently on the same thing.

Martin

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for the report, but I cannot confirm this either.

Can you maybe sent me the data you are using, or more information about 
the type of geometries you are using as the output layer?
Or maybe you have some special characters in filename or attributes or so?
You are not using Python 3 are you?

Richard Duivenvoorde

It's almost done (i.e. just read, not write Spatialtie).

AmigoCloud's GDAL/OGR Plugin for ArcGIS.

It reads from Spatialtie and other formats at the moment.

Hi

You probably need to manipulate your sys.path to ensure that your form is
visible to python at plugin start, or move your form into the same
directory as your project file.

 Hi Nathan,

 Thank you for putting some thoughts into this problem.

 Should I open a feature request ticket?

Sure thing.  You can assign it to me if you would like and when I get time
I will update it with information on what I come up with.

Hey R?gis,

I'm not sure we will still be having a feature freeze in December there is
still a bit to do, and personally I can't see us hitting a release target
of the start of next year.

I'm quite keen to having something this in QGIS so I'm happy to work on for
2.0 if no one objects.

Thanks Giuseppe,
I didn't reply to myself again, but I already found that answer, and it was
right :)
I also need to do a mapCanvas refresh.

I think that a signal should be emitted when e renderer is assigned to a
layer, and the QgsLegend should listen to it to refresh itself
automatically. Don't you think?

very strange that rendering test doesn't fail...

BTW, could you help me in understanding how to
reproduce the problem?

If I load a project containing a polygonal layer with
a SVG fill it is loaded correctly on my Ubuntu 12.10.

Maybe is yours a point layer and SVG markers? I'm
trying it right now.

 Hi,

 I filed a bug report: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6777

 For me it is very easy to reproduce. Maybe the difference is that I 
 pick a symbol from a central, user-defined SVG symbol repository - not 
 one of the SVG symbols included in the QGIS distribution.

 btw: I am using relative paths in my project - forgot to mention it in 
 the bug report.

 Thank you for having a look at it.

 Andreas

Message-ID: <50B63606.4060005@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The Geocoder plugin asks to define explicitely a SRS for the project.
This does not seem necessary, as the SRS is now defined according to the
first layer loaded: is this a legacy effect that can be removed, or
there is a reason for it?
The effect is confusing for users.
Thanks.

Hi all.
The SVG symbols are now neatly classified on the Style manger (e.g.
Vector properties). They are still shown all together in the Print
composer. This is not nice to see, difficult to use on small screens,
and very slow to make a preview of all. Maybe this happens on other
places as well.
Could the same widget be used all over?

Hi,

in QGIS 1.8 you can (de)activate panels under Settings -> Panels. Under
settings Customization the panels are described as Docks. Would it be
possible to have only one name for it? Or is there a reason, why we have two
names for it?

 +1 for using the same widgets everywhere.

 But the slowness when displaying all SVG symbols is still the case with 
 the new widget. Somehow we need to manage a way that QGIS does not need 
 to scan all symbols, but only when the user is asking for them. My idea 
 would be to first list only the folders in the tree and the children 
 would only be shown after the user opens a folder.

 Probably still a lot of work that someone has to sponsor.

Message-ID: <50B645A7.1060804@faunalia.it>

Hi all.

Various issues with the OSM plugin.
===
If I load OSM layers twice (once with stying, once without), then I
remove the layers downloaded second, I get an error for the first two
(points and lines):


Errore durante l'esecuzione di codice Python:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    if self.layer != None and self.layer.getLayerID() == layerId:
RuntimeError: wrapped C/C++ object of %S has been deleted


Then it crashes when removing the third (polygons).
===

Editing a layer returns errors (difficult to replicate, probably an
experienced OSMer could spot it better) of the type:

Furthermore, when applying a custom styling, selections are no longer

quite strange, in my case this is the way it works for styles (and it is
much faster).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsLegendInterface binding updates,
	or QgsLegend overhaul?
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_cr04SM_4pK6xVOyMFQhzL__WgmSY+Qhs21ipatn78YQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I added to QgsLegendInterface today [0] and noticed how lacking the
Python binding is when working with the legend, compared to the number
of methods that could be exposed from QgsLegend. Looks like
QgsLegendInterface really hasn't been updated since QGIS 1.5.

Users/plugin devs have asked for better means of working with the
legend, so my questions are:

* Should there be an effort to bring many of the reasonable-to-expose
methods from QgsLegend to QgsLegendInterface for 2.0 release?

* OR, should QgsLegend be overhauled first (as there has been talk about)?

Regards,

Larry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Settings for easurements ellipsoid moved
Message-ID: <1354134893919-5019405.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have put up a pull request, see:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/343

If no ojections are raised, I'll merge it in a couple of days.

"Moving the settings for measurements ellipsoid from Options menu to Project
menu, and storing them in project settings instead.

Why?

The measurements are not only used for viewing anymore, but also for
calculating area and length in field calculator. As some
tickets have been submitted that pointed out that different lengths of the
same object in field calculator and
the GUI is confusing, work was done to rectify this. In the process valid
concerns were made regarding that the same project with
the same data would yield different calculated - and stored - results in
field calculator, if the local settings for measurements were not identical.

Moving the settings to Project will make it possible to always come to the
same result regardless of installation. It is as a bonus also easier to
set different ellipsoid depending on project, e.g. one project is depicting
Mars and another Earth.

This will fix issues 3296 and 4252"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsVectorLayer.commitChanges() and editing status
Message-ID: <71282882c4f0da5164eff7a75d4c0db1@carto.net>

 Hi,

 With a Python script I am detecting if there are uncommitted changes in 
 a vector layer by checking isModified(). It works fine. The uncommitted 
 changes are committed and the layer is stopped editing. The editing 
 pencil on the layer symbol is not shown anymore as expected.

 However, in the editing toolbar the still selected layer that was 
 edited before still shows as being edited, while in fact it isn't 
 editable anymore. Is this a bug?

 My other question - can I commit changes and not stop editing? - 
 leaving the concerned layer in editing mode?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Sounds like one.

No. But you can restart editing right after the commiting.  Thats what the
"save edits" tool does.

The C++ dependencies from OSGeo4W (Qt) won't work with VS10.

Hi,

maybe I'm wrong, but seems that QgsCredentialDialog Python bindings
don't allow to get username and password entered by user. It returns
only success flag.

So I modify .sip file a bit. Here is pull-request [0]. Can anyone
review it?

I find it amazing how many people send these generic emails without
even bothering to look up the docs - maybe the building docs are not

out of curiosity i copy pasted the exact email in google.
the first 10 results were all relevant. including on place 2 the build
howto and place 3 a discussion about vs10 build problems...

so i guess it is just pure lazyness

Subject: [Qgis-developer] more advanced editing tools
Message-ID: <50B75682.4000507@jena.de>

Dear list,

during a course I realized that my institution needs some more editing 
tools for advanced editing tasks e.g.
- prolong a line
- cut polygon with feature (line or polygon) from another layer
- save all layers being in editing mode in one go
- some more

A little background: when digitizing data we are not starting from 
scratch but are digitzing on existing data in many different layers 
(parcels, restricted areas ...). A new polygon normally needs to fit 
into these existing boundaries. Trying to digitize along existing 
boundaries of several layers and snapping to them is cumbersome and you 
are very likely missing snapping nodes (even when using trace digitize 
plugin).

Is any of you aware of similar functions in a plugin (I know cadTools)? 
Is anyone interested in joining me to create such tools as a Python 
plugin? Which functions would you like to have?

regards

Bernhard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Get list of dirty features and their attributes
Message-ID: <50B75FF5.1080004@gmail.com>

Hi,
sure you know this - when editing/adding multiple features to layer and
pressing 'save' button an error message appears because of some database
constraint violation or invalid data type in attribute table.
There is very hard to find out a problematic features when many of them
where changed or added.

We wrote a small Python console script to print all dirty features with
their attributes and WKT geometry:

# QGIS 1.7, 1.8, author: Marcel Dancak, Gista s.r.o.
layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
map = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
layer.select(map.fullExtent(), False)
fields = layer.dataProvider().fields()
features = layer.selectedFeatures()

# filter only new features
features = [f for f in features if f.id() < 0]
for f in features:
	attribs = dict([(unicode(fields[k].name().toUtf8()),
unicode(v.toString().toUtf8())) for k, v in f.attributeMap().iteritems()])
	print f.id(), attribs, f.geometry().type(), f.geometry().exportToWkt()


Do you know better way to solve this problem ? If not, is it worth to
put it in to plugin ?

Message-ID: <50B76950.60703@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Why is not more than one geometry column per layer supported? Would it 
be hard to support more than one geometry column (and set one as the 
default to be displayed)?
It would certainly make some tasks easier and maybe could be used for 
level of detail, related to the current zoom level.

There was recently a discussion on this list about spatialite as default 
layer type and spatialite would support this, as does postgres.

also around here many people feel the needs of more advanced tools.
This ones are often requested by people that spend a lot of time
digitizing:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4933 -> fill hole (and fill space)

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4996 -> remove overlapped areas

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4997 -> avoid intersection when
copying/pasting polygons

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5040 -> split lines with points

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5234 -> add ring + automatic "fill hole" tool

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5342 -> continue editing of already
existing line geometries

Hey,

Honestly I find that a pain in the neck, from a users point of view and
from a developer point of view.  From a users point of view you now have to
have a tools that supports styling points, regions, lines all at the same
time, it also makes processing harder because you have to check the
geometry type before doing certain operations.

>From a developer point of view I think it can make things hard because you
have to check feature by feature what kind geometry you are dealing with
before working on it, have you got a 0 length line or a point because
length of a point is 0?. At the moment we just open the layer, check the
type and select the correct methods.

MapInfo does this and I always found it caused more problems then it's
worth IMO.  Although postgres and spatialite support storing different
geometry types in the same table I have seen it as bad practice.  If you do
happen to have a layer with say regions and points for building footprints,
you can put the layer twice in the geometry_columns table with a different
geometry type and QGIS will pick it up as a different layer, then you can
just set the zoom levels on each layer.

They are my thoughts anyway.

Aren't you mixing up multiple geometry columns and type safety? I'm not 
talking about different geometry types in one column, but in different 
columns, so it should always be clear, from a certain combination 
layer/column, which tools/actions are available.

My problem now is, that I need to use different geometries for the same 
feature from a plugin. As the database is sometimes really slow, I'd 
prefer to fetch just one table with the geometries in several columns. 
This way, I also would not have to join the two or three tables again in 
a plugin (it's error prone and slower the database could handle this)

But how would you render that? Even if you have three geometry columns in
one table are you expecting QGIS to be able to render them all in one
QgsVectorLayer in the canvas.  Or do you want a different layer in QGIS for
each column but that all point to the same database table?

Hi,

> Why not using DB Manager?

to be used to import large amount of data, DB manager still lacks the
option to use > 1 shape as input and a progress bar (and a "cancel"
button). Also it seems much slower to import shapes into postgis/sl
than other tools, like spit/postgis manager or the cli tools.

I think rendering one at a time is enough (as in my first mail: one as 
the default to display), with time one could include fun stuff like LOD, 
subitems in the layer legend, or whatever somebody might come up with ( 
intersection etc).

More interesting for me is the possibility to access additional geometry 
columns from a plugin, and therefore having the dataProvider ready for this.

The idea of having multiple layers, pointing to the same table sounds 
interesting as well. This would probably mean separating the pretty 
strong linkage between layer (as representation) <=> table (as data), 
we've got now.

Regarding the workflow you described at the end, do you know about 
"avoiding intersection" ? 
http://darrencope.com/2011/10/19/qgis-topological-editing/
This is much easier to use than snapping points, and it works across 
different layers.

Regarding the more advanced digitization features, I think the best 
would be to improve CAD tools instead of creating yet another plugin 
that people will not find. I agree that these features are important. 
One I would like is to see the distance and angle directly during 
digitizing, while you enter a line.

Leyan

Right, I gave up on it.

It's the almost like trying to get people to stop top posting, stop troll
feeding, trim their replies, stop using HTML on lists, copy text instead of
taking screenshots of text messages and so on (and on and on...).

Ok, caught me - I didn't actually give up - still it's a lost cause ;)

Hi Leyan,

I know "avoid intersection" and it works ok but having several layers as 
digitizing base and creating a new polygon it is not very handy (open 
menu untick what is ticked, tick what you need now, digitize the 
polygon). It seems more straight-forward (especially from a user's point 
of view) to copy a polygon from a base layer (e.g. parcels) into your 
edit layer, select a polygon/line in another layer, activate your edit 
layer again and click on a "clip" button. More convenient would be 
Giovannis "fill space" option.
Regarding cadTools I would expect CAD-like functions in there, i.e. 
construction things, clipping, saving all layers etc. do IMHO not really 
fit to CAD.

Are there any other editTools around?

Bernhard

this was requested here, too. Fill hole seems (theoretically) quite
simple, the other one is harder:
1) which layers are defined to form the space to be filled. Any line or
polygon layer could do it. Maybe one would use the ones that are ticked
for avoid intersection.
2) what happens if these layers do not form a closed boundary around the
point where the user clicked? how would you detect this?

Filling a hole can also be achieved by ticking "avoid intersection" for
the layer with the polygon and then digitizing generously around the
hole. In this respect I would like to have the whole snapping business
more handy: You have to click the menu, scroll in the list, tick here
and there... (no idea though how it could be improved)

agreed, currently you would have to add a new line and merge it with the
existing one afterwards. Maybe this would be the way how to solve this
issue in a plugin.

Hi Bernhard,

Excellent timing, I was thinking about creating a new functionality that 
I need for a parcel digitization project.
One tool I have in mind is parallel moving of a side of a polygon in 
order to achieve a specific area for the polygon (and at the same time 
maintain topological integrity with near polygons.

Cheers,
Angelos

Angelos,

would you see this functionality rather in cadTools or in a new plugin?

Hi Bernhard,

I agree that some editing ideas are not strictly CAD but we have to 
think the end user and where the tools are expected to be found more 
easily. Also the number of new tools are important. For 2-5 new tools, 
extending cadTools would be more appropriate than a new plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS - How to create "Outline: Simple Line"
	layer?
Message-ID: <C9964B2183DB264DBBA2D457FEAD439916DF27D6@0461-its-exmb02.us.saic.com>

Hello All,

 

First off I'm quite the newbie when it comes to developing PyQGIS
plugins so hopefully this post makes sense...

 

I'm creating a vector layer using the memory provider.  Layer consists
of polygons and everything is working great.  

 

I'm now attempting to tailor the appearance of the symbols.  Following
the advice in this post
(http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2011-April/013772.html)
I successfully created just an outline (i.e. no fill):

 

        props = { 'color_border' : '255,0,0,255', 'style' : 'no',
'style_border' : 'solid' }

        s = QgsFillSymbolV2.createSimple(props)

        vl.setRendererV2( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2( s ) )

 

This is close to what I'd like but I notice that when selecting features
the selected features become filled which is not what I'd like.  

 

Manually adjusting the properties via the "Symbol properties" dialog I
discovered that by selecting "Outline: Simple line" from the "Symbol
layer type" pulldown provides the functionality I desire.  When
selecting features the color of the outline changes while remaining
un-filled.  Looking at the resulting entry in symbology-ng-style.xml
shows the following:

 

    <symbol outputUnit="MM" alpha="1" type="fill" name="Dash Foo">

      <layer pass="0" class="SimpleLine" locked="0">

        <prop k="capstyle" v="square"/>

        <prop k="color" v="0,85,0,255"/>

        <prop k="customdash" v="5;2"/>

        <prop k="joinstyle" v="bevel"/>

        <prop k="offset" v="0"/>

        <prop k="penstyle" v="dash"/>

        <prop k="use_custom_dash" v="0"/>

        <prop k="width" v="0.37"/>

      </layer>

    </symbol>

 

I haven't had any luck in figuring out how to get the proper combination
of type="fill" while using "SimpleLine".  I also noticed that if I
follow the example in the PyQGIS Cookbook to display the complete list
of types for a QgsSymbolV2.Fill none of the "Outline: <foo>" types from
the dialog pulldown are listed:

 

     myRegistry = QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry.instance()

     for item in myRegistry.symbolLayersForType(QgsSymbolV2.Fill):

     ... print item

 

     CentroidFill

     LinePatternFill

     PointPatternFill

     SVGFill

     SimpleFill

 

Any advice on how to replicate the "Outline: Simple line" symbology will
be greatly appreciated!

 

Thanks,

 

-- Dan

actually my suggestion wasn't that advanced:

* the tool should work on just one layer

* the tool should be able to fill all holes and/or spaces (with
polygons) in one go

or

* allow the user click on a specific hole/space, fill it (with a
polygon) and pop-up the dialog for attributes


there is a plugin (does not seem mantained) that works in a similar
way, so I guess that it implemets a detection code, anyway it just
fills holes (not spaces), one at the time, and does not ask to fill
attributes.



cheers!

The simplest snapping approach I've seen is a keyboard shortcut (S), and then watch as the programme tries to snap to anything in sight (not so good if you have many layers).

But, I wonder, would it be possible to pop the snapping menu out into a panel (or similar) so that when you're furiously digitising it was easily accessible? 
or 
Maybe if (S) wasn't used that could take you straight to the list.

I'm new to this and have missed the talk of a QgsLegend overhaul so I have no knowledge ofthe scope/reasons of the proposed changes.  To provide further context I am developing a python plugin for use in a corporate environment where I can only target stable releases (1.8/2.0).
Generally providing access to an appropriate API will reduce the need for hackish code.
The change you have made will negate the current need to query the QTreeView to determineif the active layer is the only selected layer.
I would also find value in gaining access to groupSelectedLayers.
In the long term I also feel that control of sub-groups is essential (part of the overhaul?).
In summary I support exposing further legend controls before 2.0

in that case the algorithm might be easier: just disoolve all polygons 
in the layer into one (spaces are thus converted into holes) and fill 
all the holes in it. Might take a while with layers with many or complex 
polygons, though.

that is similar but different from what I had in mind. I was thinking 
about the user clicking in a hole or space and just this one is filled. 
The algorithm however would be the same.

not neccessarily because you can define your snap layers and snapping 
should only occur with one of those (though if you choose to snap to 
segments there would be an abundance of potential snap points)

I think this would smoothen the workflow. We could file a ticket for 
this. I my case I have many line and point layers to which I can snap 
but I have to scroll a lot to get to a certain polygon layer that I want 
to tick for "avoid intersections". Maybe we could have another column in 
the snapping options dialog with the geometry type in it so we could

Hi Angelos,

I agree that some 2 to 5 tools should go into cadTools. What we have 
until now:
- parallel move of polygon side (IMHO CAD-like function)
- split feature with selected feature from another theme (general 
digitizing function)
- cut out from feature with selected polygon from another theme (general 
digitizing function)
- continue editing an exisitng line (general digitizing function)
- save all layers being in editing mode in one go (general digitizing 
function)
- fill hole(s) in polygon feature (general digitizing function)
- fill spaces between polygons (general digitizing function)
- avoid intersection when copying/pasting polygons (reported bug)
- split lines with points (IMHO fTools)
- prolong a line, i.e. move its endpoint in the direction of the last 
segment (CAD-like function)

from a users point of view it would be nice to have everything related 
to digitizing in one plugin on the other hand users probably do not 
expect the functions I marked as "general digitizing" in a plugin called 
cadTools.

Message-ID: <50B89BF1.8020505@gmail.com>

Hi all,

With the Faunalia'help, the QGIS Server WFS implementation is more 
interoperable. You can use QGIS-Server to publish vector data throw WFS 
and use it in QGIS, ArcGIS, gvSIG, and OpenLayers.

To demonstrate the ability to update Spatialite data stored on a server 
with QGIS-Server, I've created a demo :
http://demo.3liz.com/wfst/wfs-transaction-polygon.html
I will add demo for point and linestring :
http://demo.3liz.com/wfst/

Yan can also test the QGS-Server WFS-Transaction implementation with 
your favorite (or less) Desktop GIS.
Feedbacks are welcome.

Hi Otto

as far as I know, there's no reason for two names, it's the same thing... I
guess "panel" is a term that users are more familiar with.

a plugin that works this way (just for holes, not for spaces) already
exist, but it does not asks for attributes, so right now it is not
that useful.

anyway an option to fill in one go all the holes/spaces would be very
appreciated by many.

Hi Giovanni,
You're probably talking about Ringer plugin. This was one of my first plugin
and it was wrote for issue  #3187 <http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3187>  .
Some time ago I have short e-mail talk with Carson Farmer to include this
functionality into fTools. Because of that I don't move it to new
repository.

What do you mean about asking for attributes? To copy them from parent
polygon or popup form for each new polygon?

Regards,
Peter

Are you interested just in newly added features or any "dirty" features,
i.e. also changed features and removed features? Because the above would
work just for new features. Currently it's not possible to access
uncommitted changes... but in theory you could still iterate over vector
layer and then iterate through its data provider and compare the results to
detect all changes.

If you decide to create a plugin, you could listen to signals from
QgsVectorLayer (featureAdded, featureDeleted and others) to immediately
detect any changes.

In general, any tools that would lead to easier detection of problems would
be welcome.

Martin

Couldn't we just expose to the API the collection of changed features via
QgsVectorLayer?

So right now we have QgsFeature that contains ID, attributes and a
geometry. I think we should keep that as-is because this is what is usually
expected from a layer.

In order to support multiple geometries per feature, we could possibly
allow QgsGeometry class as another attribute type (next to int, double and
QString). So providers like postgis that support multiple geometry columns
could return additional geometries wrapped as attributes in QVariant. Would
that work for you?

I my case I have many line and point layers to which I can snap but I have to scroll a lot to get to a certain polygon layer that I want to tick for "avoid intersections". Maybe we could have another column in the snapping options dialog with the geometry type in it so we could sort on that to have all polygon layers together?

As usual with QGIS, I think wouldn't that be cool and lo, it's already there.

It appears that you can leave the snapping dialogue open, go do some editing and come back change your snapping. So it is effectively already a panel.

Well, I failed to guess that, although the apply button should have been a hint. Just as well I had a decent rummage in the issues db before filing! #5152 linking to #660 was a good hint :)

We could (and it's a right thing to do), but that wouldn't really help

Hi devs, hi all,

Alessandro Furieri has sent to me a patch to support the features
available from the newest SpatiaLite v4 into the provider, mostly
the intensive use of statistics to improve performaces.

@Alessandro: please, could you tell us what's new in
the provider? I know some details, but I'm sure devs would
like to know more.

The patch doesn't break API, but could break the provider
functionalities (worst). Alessandro and I have tested it and
everything seems to work fine.

Before merging it I've opened a pull request [1], further tests
are welcome.

Regards.

And the users would be forced to deal with yet another pretty strong API 
change besides the API changes you plan to commit.

This would work perfectly well. I'm wondering how much work it would 
mean to get this.

Giuseppe, thanks a lot for your precious collaboration.

surely yes:

a) spatialite v4 is now strictly conformant to the most recent
    OGC-SFS and ISO SQL/MM standard requirements.
    unhappily this necessarily implies few compatibility breakages.

b) any recent version of libspatialite starting since 4.0.0 has
    the capability to handle any DB created using any possible
    previous version of the library.
    this happens in a completely transparent way, and the user is
    not required to apply any special precaution at all.
    the full library support is available both on reading and writing,
    and obviously covers the Spatial Index capabilities as well.
    (see below for further details).

c) the opposite isn't true; it's absolutely impossible connecting
    any new DB created using the most recent libspatialite 4.0.0 if
    the underlying library is obsolete (any version < 4.0.0)
    the revised QGIS data-provider will emit an appropriate error
    message in this case (when linked against an obsolete library
    version and attempting to open a DB-file created by a recenter
    version).

d) a new CLI tool is make available in spatialite-tools-4.0.0:
    "spatialite_convert" makes possible safely converting any DB-file
    back and forward between v.2.3.x, v.3.0.x and v.4.0.x
    it doesn't requires a full DB conversions, simply the metadata
    tables are affected, so converting from a version to the the other
    is a really fast process just requiring few seconds even when the
    DB-file is a really huge and complex one.

e) the most recent DB layout supported by v.4.0.0 now supports a full
    set of statistic infos; this is specially useful for QGIS, because
    now the data provider can avoid at all to loose time by "sniffing"
    each layer before connecting.
    and this is obviously useful while connecting to some layer 
containing
    many million feature; the time required by any previous version of
    the QGIS data-provider could require several minutes in this case.
    now, when full v.4.0.0 support is available, just few seconds are
    enough to connect such "huge layers".

f) last but not least: libspatialite v.4.0.0 now supports several API
    methods taking full care to internally handle any metadata table
    (e.g. the ones supporting the internal statistics).
    such "abstract" methods are mainly intended to avoid any direct 
physical
    access from the data-provider itself.
    so the data-provider can now completely ignore any fine-grained 
detail
    about the version-dependent DB layout; these "abstract API methods" 
will
    always implement the most appropriate access strategy to the 
metadata
    tables for any possible DB layout.
    a strong commitment exist to fully preserve all these "abstract API
    methods": so any future major change affecting the DB layout will be
    completely transparent to the QGIS data-provider, and simply 
upgrading
    the underlaying libspatialite will be enough to keep anything 
correctly
    aligned.

g) just a final note: a further "abstract" API method will now support
    full deletion of any Geometry table, taking care to remove any 
possible
    metadata reference and any Spatial Index eventually defined.
    as a rule-of-the-thumb, the revised data-provider will continue to 
work
    exactly as before when linked against any libspatialite prior to 
4.0.0
    but will take full profit of the new "abstract" methods if linked to
    libspatialite v.4.0.0 (or any subsequent).

if you are interested to learn more about these topics, here you can

I have run my benchmarks with latest master: http://bench.qgis.cz
However it seems that we achieved significant slowdown over 100% there
may exist a different explanation in benchmarking itself. Running
benchmarks on all commits since April would help. I have free computer
I would like to dedicate to real time benchmarks I just need to find
time to configure it.

Hi all

As you might know, the SEXTANTE project started some time ago at the
University of Extremadura (Spain), where I was working. I started
creating the QGIS version at the beginning of this year, and now I do
not work for the University, but I am still mantaining it. The
University has some money that they would like to invest on improving
SEXTANTE for QGIS, as this is the version they (and I personally share
that) consider more relevant. I am not available for that task, as I
have another job, but I would help coordinate the development in my
spare time, as I do now.

There are some priorities, which involve developing certain new
analysis algorithms that are of interest, mostly for academic
purposes, and creating good documentation about how to develop new
SEXTANTE algorithms, so as to bring more developers in and ensure that
SEXTANTE will keep on growing. But apart from that, we would like to
hear from the community, to know what is better for SEXTANTE.

So, in short:

- The University has some money (not much...but some) and wants to
invest it wisely
- It is looking for ideas to define the work to do (apart from its
particular interest), in order to turn SEXTANTE into a really powerful
tool.
- We are looking for someone to do this work.

Let's start with the second point.... How do you think we should spend
this money on SEXTANTE?

Please, comment on this and help us push SEXTANTE forward.

Many thanks in advance.

Victor

Hi,

Yes it is a real dilemma.
I would like to hear more opinions on this...

I think first we should fix as much bugs as possible (now there are
76 tickets in bugtracker). Also important topics are:
 - i18n support (most strings are not translatable, some algorithms
   can't handle non-ASCII filenames etc)
 - moving some native algorithms (fTools, GDALTools) to SEXTANTE to
   avoid duplication and make them more powerful. Some work already
   done, but we need to finish it
 - maybe improving documentation (IMO SEXTANTE documentation is pretty
   good, both from user and developer point of view)
