Message-ID: <55444B86.5090508@gmail.com>

I did a "git pull" against the latest git repository and had it fail for 
the build.  I am running "14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)".


I hit the following error:

I previously had built the Makefile using "ccmake ..".  Shouldn't ccmake 
catch a version problem or missing library?

I got a running qgis by "make -i" and "make -i install" and it finished 
normally.  I didn't hit the missing modules while I used it today.

My current build from help->about is:

QGIS version    2.9.0-Master    QGIS code revision    e12601e
Compiled against Qt    4.8.6    Running against Qt    4.8.6

QWT Version    6.0.0-svn    PROJ.4 Version    480
QScintilla2 Version    2.8.3


Is it OK to do a build using "make -j 4" (or -j whatever) to utilize the 
multiple cpu cores during a make?  (I have but is there a hidden gotcha)?


Thanks for your time.

Message-ID: <A1B544DD-8006-473D-AEED-BE69A818067A@southweb.co.nz>

Am struggling a bit with this problem.  I want to render the active symbol for a layer as a QPixmap in a dialog.

I have got this far:

        s =  layer().rendererV2()
        key = s.rootRule().findRuleByKey(s.rootRule().ruleKey())

This tells me the active rule key to be rendered but how to get the image data?

Perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree here?

Thanks

Hi all.
The Identify tool works in a strange (to me) way for inverted polygons:
you have to click inside the polygon, but then the red (identified) area
is on the outside, giving an ugly effect, difficult to understand.
I'd say this is a bug: agreed? If so, I'll open a ticket.
All the best.

Hi,


I would like to test HiDPI issues on QT5 that seems to have a better
support for this kind of high resolution screens.

I set QT5 ON and I think I've installed all requirements (I'm on Ubuntu
14.04) but I get lot of errors while building.

Here is the output:

https://dpaste.de/dJNO

It seems like it still links to Qt4, any hint?

Hi Jurgen,
will the switch to Qt5 require adapting the Python bindings?

Hi Giovanni,

There are two possibilities

 * PyQt4 with Qt5
 * PyQt5 with Qt5

Neither of them are tested with QGIS. At the time I ported the code they
were not available for my distro and I didn't compile them myself.
I assume PyQt4/Qt5 should work pretty smooth but if a distro drops Qt5
support it will likely switch to PyQt5 as well. So this option will
probably only be used on isolated platforms for testing.
PyQt5 will require some changes (foremost let cmake find the lib) but
the real challenge will be to update plugins themselves.

There seem to be some leftovers that try to bring in bits of Qt4.

I have once written a short howto:

I hope that helps,

So far, I have been able to extract and convert the
projective and Helmert transformations.

However, the code for the affine transformation seems
incomplete.

Looking here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/trunk/src/plugins/georeferencer/qgsleastsquares.cpp

I find this method:

void QgsLeastSquares::affine()

It computes a 6x6 transformation matrix but stops there.
In analogy to "QgsLeastSquares::helmert()", I _think_
the next step should be to extract the rotation, scaling,
translation and shearing vectors using "gsl_vector_get()".

It seems to me that "QgsLeastSquares::affine()" has been
abandoned code for a while and that the affine transformation
is now delegated to gdal_warp(?).

Does anyone here still remember how to extract the affine
components from the 6x6 matrix? I have done some extensive
searching on the web but came up empty. Any pointers would
be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Ben

Hi dev,

I proposed a pull-request to save GDAL subdataset datasource with 
relative path.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2018
This pull-request updates only the file src/core/qgsmaplayer.cpp

I'd like to know, who do I assign this pull-request for reviewing it ?

Thanks Mathias,

it helped and I successfully built qgis with Qt5

the problem is that it segfaults at start.

(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/ale/apps-qt5/bin/qgis
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fffee35ddfc in ?? () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4


I noticed that there are still links to Qt4:

ldd /home/ale/apps-qt5/bin/qgis|grep Qt | grep -v Qt5

(0x00007fa850877000)


I disabled the bindings, grass plugin and qwt polar and make clean, what am
I doing wrong?

Have you compiled and linked QWT and QScintilla against Qt5 and made
sure that they are picked up by CMake when you build QGIS?

Hello Mathias,

QScintilla was ok but I forgot to change the links for QWT. Now I
downloaded and built QWT using Qt5 version of qmake, then set the right
path but still no luck... I cannot figure out why it is still linking to
libQtCore.so.4

Indeed, this is a bit strange.
You would prefer the red area to be inside the polygon ?

Hi Marcus

Congratulations to being accepted for GSoC 2015!

I am sure there are plenty of users hoping to see this functionality in
QGIS sooner or later :-) It will be great to be able to start processing
algorithms and keep working with QGIS, not having to wait until the
algorithm finishes.

Looking forward to read about your progress - don't forget to keep us
updated about the joys and struggles with your project. If you have any
questions, do not hesitate to ask on this mailing list. Lots of QGIS
wizards keep an eye on this list and may help you.

By the way, the code snippet on your blog looks like a good start :)

Cheers
Martin

I'd try the following:
grep -i qt4 CMakeCache.txt

and

ldd /usr/lib/libqt5scintilla2.so
ldd /usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib/libqwt.so

Maybe that points out something...

?I can confirm your observation that there seems to be no functionality in
place to avoid loading layers with very similar colors. Maybe we have to
keep track of the used colors and try to pick something different enough
for the next layer.

Best wishes,
Anita?

Hi Martin,

Thank you for seeing my blog! 

> I am sure there are plenty of users hoping to see this functionality in QGIS sooner or later :-) It will be great to be able to start processing algorithms and keep working with QGIS, not having to wait until the algorithm finishes.
Yes, I believe this is a good improvement on the QGIS Toolbox :)

I will be posting the news on my blog and ask here if I have doubts on the Processing (guess I don?t need to look outside the Processing).

I slotted some time to better analyze the Processing code, algorithms behavior and see the documentation before the QGIS Meeting.
I?m hopping to get some work done on the QGIS Developer meeting.

> By the way, the code snippet on your blog looks like a good start :)
Thank you! I was doing some examples to see if it?s worth to subclass the QObject instead of QThread. 
Seems to be a good approach to deal with thread management.

Cheers,
Marcus

Hi,

If I'm correct, the QgsLeastSquares::affine() method is used when creating
a worldfile, and it seems it does not account for rotation (at least the
generated worldfiles don't).

Not really sure of what you're trying to do, but just in case, here's my
implementation to compute worldfile parameters with rotation too (I had no
time to port to core yet) :

Best,

Olivier

Ok, that explains a lot.

I am trying to extract the transformation methods
to plain C. I find that they are nicely designed and
compact, with GNU Scientific Library (also a plain C
lib) being the only dependency. I am not aware of any
other simple C lib for such transformations and I would
like to make the excellent QGIS implementations of
Helmert and projective transformations available to
C and Java (via JNI bindings) programmers. Granted,
affine transformations are usually easier to find,
but for the sake of completeness...

Thanks! I will take a look. Maybe this already contains
all I am searching for.

Ben

I'm on a Debian testing machine and this version of QGIS was compiled

Weird is that with the compiled master I don't have any problem with the

Am I missing something?!

Message-ID: <938319403.1792951430841365085.JavaMail.httpd@webmail-16.iol.local>

Hi,
I have some doubts about QgsGeometryMap type.

I use layer from a PostgreSQL database and I use the 
committedGeometriesChanges() signal to check if a geometry was changed.
By the QGIS API documentation I can see that committedGeometriesChanges() 
return a QgsGeometryMap, that is so defined:

      typedef QMap<QgsFeatureId, QgsGeometry> QgsGeometryMap

Iterating over the QMap object I have discovered that the 'key' portion 
(QgsFeaureId) is ugual to the "id" attribute values (defined as table primary 
key) of the features, is that fortuitous or there is a reason?

Is there a method to read the attribute values starting by the QgsGeometryMap 
type?

Thanks.

Regards,

Enrico

 values in Android version of QGIS 2.0.1 (in apk file)?
Message-ID: <CAF0myXZavc3f595R4psep6Nzv93bBAsGpt9ajfyPJEs9reNydQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS developers,

Lithuanian regional parks are trying to use QGIS on tablet computers for
about one year.
The start  was pretty successful, but some problems appears because of QGIS
bugs on Android (like http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11164 http://hub.qgis
.org/issues/11813 ) and now one company with proprietary solution wants to
eliminate open source QGIS from Lithuanian environmental sector because of
these small problems.
I'm trying to solve these problems and want to know the fastest solution.

We can't use the latest QGIS 2.6 for Android because of QGIS bugs
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11164 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11813 , so we
are using QGIS 2.0.1 pretty successfully, but we must change default
IconSize and other default values in Android version of QGIS 2.0.1 - in apk
file, because QGIS2.conf can't be edited from other programs in Android
because of Android security policy (you can edit QGIS2.conf only with
'rooted' Android tablets).
I wanna repack qgis 2.0.1 apt file to add customized QGIS2.conf, but there
are no QGIS2.conf in qgis-nightly-20140416-armeabi-v7a.apk file, it seems
that QGIS2.conf file is created when QGIS application is started on Android
tablet.

I'm providing one value of QGIS2.conf file which we should change in apk
file:

[General]
IconSize=60

Please tell me how to change this and other default values in Android
version of QGIS 2.0.1 (in apk file).

Btw, QGIS for Android isn't updated for about 6 months, since 2.6 release
(Nov 20 2014), see https://github.com/qgis/qgis-android/tree/qt5 and
http://qgis.org/downloads/android/ (debug versions dated Feb 2015, but
really this is simply an old 2014 code)
Do you have some plans to "revive" QGIS for Android?
It would be nice to see at least development version of QGIS 2.8 for
Android.

Hello,

I'm using Mac OS X 10.7.5 and QGis 2.8.1.
I want to print a map with Print Composer. But the Buttons "Print" or
"Export as PDF" don't work for me. If I use these buttons, the window for
choosing a directory or printer appears but only for 1 sec. Afterwards
nothing happens. What I'am doing wrong?

If I want to save a QGis Project the window for choosing a directory appears
and I can choose the path. The issue is only by using Print Composer.

Thanks and Greets

Hello everyone,

I'm having problems with a specific error, which is pretty common from what
I can see but can't seem to find a solution.

When I try to import the qgis module the following error occurs:

and here's the settings for the .cmd, I'm assuming it has something to do
with this:

Hey,

This is what I use for everything that I have setup:

@ECHO OFF
REM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM Change %OSGEO4W_ROOT% in setenv.bat to change in the location of QGIS.
REM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


for %%x in (%cmdcmdline%) do if /i "%%~x"=="/c" set DOUBLECLICKED=1

REM Change OSGeo4W_ROOT to point to your install of QGIS.

SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W
SET QGISNAME=qgis
SET QGIS=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\%QGISNAME%
set QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=%QGIS%

CALL %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat

: Python Setup
set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%QGIS%\bin;%PATH%
SET PYTHONHOME=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\Python27
set PYTHONPATH=%QGIS%\python;%PYTHONPATH%

ECHO OSGeo path is: %OSGEO4W_ROOT%
ECHO Getting QGIS libs from: %QGIS%
ECHO Python loaded from: %PYTHONHOME%

Then you can add what you need at the end.  For a simple test just drop to
Python and try the import.

Hi all,

during the last hackfest we discussed about fully integrating ftools
into processing, so eventually we can have all those algorithms in
Processing in the same way as they are now in the ftools plugin, and
remove the latter to avoid redundancy.

Not much was done, but I would like to work on this during the Hackfest.

If anyone has ideas, or anyone that will attend the HF wants to
collaborate on this, please let me know.

Thanks!

Just discovered that QGIS built with QT5 runs fine from the build
directory  but segfaults from the install directory.

This runs fine from the build directory:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=output/lib/ output/bin/qgis

It seems like the install process (make install) removes the runtime path
from the .so and this causes the problem: running ldd in output/lib/
doesn't show any Qt 4 lib while running ldd on the installed libqgis_gui.so
shows libQtCore.so.4 libQtGui.so.4 etc.

Any idea how to fix this?

I should be able to work on this at the hackfest.

IMHO, removing ftools menu entries should be conditioned by the 
translation of groups and names of algorithms in the toolbox.
I rememer that alex started working on this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange modulus calculations in QGIS
Message-ID: <5666bdc8fb112b7930962189b3feab11@carto.net>

Hi,

I am using modules calculations to distinguish major from minor contour 
lines. However, the modulus calculations have two issue:

1. the results have rounding issue:
f.e. 467.9 % 0.2 results in 0.0999999999999513 - I know I could use a 
round function as a workaround - but it is annoying!

2. there are very strange results:
468.0 % 0.2 results in 0.1999999999999974 -> I would expect a result of 
"0"

Is there something we can do to fix these two issues?

Thanks,
Andreas

Yes, we should have the same functionality as in ftools, not just the
algorithms, but also the translations, etc. Everything so people do
not miss the ftools plugin if it's eventually removed

Thanks!

Hi, 
+ 1 for centralizing alg's in one place. From a UI point of view, what about
discussing some kind of shortcuts in menu, allowing to open directly
processing algorithms?  
Users do love the graphic icon in ftools that help understanding what
geometric operator will be triggered. Even more, an assistant would be
perfect, even if it's only a shortcut to processing tools.  
We have user here that use menu a lot, and that would have diffulties to
understand having a vector menu without geo processing entries. same for
raster. 
Cheers
R?gis

Hi

I think it would be nice to be able to access some tools from the Menu.
Maybe allow users to select which tools or groups of tools can be opened
from the Menu?

A few years ago ArcGIS moved all geoprocessing tools to the Toolbox and a
lot of users complained. They ended up creating a Menu called
"geoprocessing" that had the most commonly used algorithms: intersection,
clip etc.

Also, many ftools algorithms are terribly slow (e.g. dissolve),
particularly when compared to the equivalent tools based on ogr2ogr, that
Giovanni Manghi added to Processing a few months ago. It may worth
considering the possibility of deleting some ftools algorithm in favor of
the ogr2ogr based algorithms.

Cheers

what about this: having a tool in Processing that allows to select the
algorithms you use the most, and have them in menus and submenus
instead of the toolbox.

Similar to the ArcGIS solution, but more flexible. The code will be
easier to mantain (only one codebase for algorithms), but the users
will be able to easily customize where they want to find the
algorithms, in case they don't want to use the toolbox.

Looks like an interesting thing for the hackfest, and quite feasible
to implement

Thanks for your ideas!

hm, why would a libqgis_gui.so suddenly start to point at libQtCore.so when the
Qt5 version it's linked against is named libQt5Core.so?  Are you sure the
libqgis_gui.so is the shared library you installed and not a previous ony built
with Qt4?

Yes 100% sure, this was driving me mad, the library built in build tree
output directory is the same exact size and time as the installed one but
has different md5, this led me to inspect what "make install" does, and to
discover that it strips RPATH by default.

So, the library in output find the right libraries (Qt5) while the same
RPATH-stripped library in the install directory doesn't, or to be precise,
it finds Qt5 but also loads Qt4 (don't ask me why...).

Look at this (notice the Qt(4) libs in the installed version, missing from
the built output):

Running the installed one with LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the installed
libs segfaults immediately.
Running the build tree one with LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the build tree
output works.

Still investigating...

Thanks Mathias and Juergen,

that did the trick:

objdump -x output/lib/libqgis_gui.so.2.9.0|grep RPATH
 RPATH
/home/ale/dev/QGIS/build-local-qt5/src/core:/home/ale/dev/QGIS/build-local-qt5/src/gui:/home/ale/dev/QGIS/build-local-qt5/output/lib:/usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib:

the problem was /usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib that I built against Qt5 and
installed in /usr/local but the system installed Qt4 version was loaded
instead:
 ldd ../../../apps-qt5/lib/libqgis_gui.so.2.9.0|grep qwt
        libqwt.so.6 => /usr/lib/libqwt.so.6 (0x00007fd0d1da7000)

while:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib ldd
../../../apps-qt5/lib/libqgis_gui.so.2.9.0|grep qwt
        libqwt.so.6 => /usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib/libqwt.so.6
(0x00007f291095a000)


this now works:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qwt-6.1.2/lib:/home/ale/apps-qt5/lib/
/home/ale/apps-qt5/bin/qgis

I just hope this email thread can be useful to others.

Seems quite an interesting proposal. I agree with R?gis that icons do a
lot to help, especially newbies.

Hi all,

I  interested in this too and will be available to help.
Also maybe we should think about GDALTools? Seems
all algorithms already available in Processing, so we can
try to find solution to replace GDALTools too.

Right. What I miss is the echo of the gdal command line. Throwing it
away would be a pity IMHO.

Agreed, I find the command line very useful and I often use the GUI just to
build the command line that I use in the shell or in a script.

Message-ID: <554B0D38.8060603@fossgis.de>

Hi,

1. i try to run qgis' voronoipolygons algorithm from processing toolbox
in a python script (processing-script or standalone)

For testing I loaded a shape and a postgis layer to a
QgsMapLayerRegistry. I can sucessfully run
processing.runalg('qgis:voronoipolygons', <shape-layer>, 0, outShpVec)
but processing.runalg('qgis:voronoipolygons', <postgis-layer>, 0,
outShpVec) fails (with exit code 137 ). No message in debugging console
in my IDE (PyCharm).

Any idea or example why this does not work or how I can do further
investigation?

2. I'm in trouble using the qgis:importintopostgis via script as well.
It expects an Index of a registered postgis connection. How can I use
this alg by passing the connection params directly or do I have to
create an entry in QSettings() for that and how can I get the latest
registered connection than?

Thank you

Marco

Hi all,

Lots of methods in QGIS are now decorated with the C++11 "override"
keyword. Which is good.
But it is only enabled for gcc and Clang compilers (not under MSVC for
instance).

So ... what features of C++11 is allowed in QGIS source code ? Support
in GCC/CLang is excellent and the version of Visual Studio used for the
windows compilation (2010) has already support for some nice features.

I'm thinking about auto, unique_ptr and move semantics especially ...

I'd say all that don't break platforms we currently build for (ie.
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS).

I will try to add as many geoprocessing operations based on
ogr2ogr/sql as I can,
especialy the ones that are really slow in ftools. Anyway to be able
to add the operations
that involve more than 1 input layer it will be needed to add a method
in processing to
create (on the fly) virtual vectors (and in general this tool would
benefit from other improvements
like multi-attribute selection). I plan to discussa about this things
in Denmark.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2 additional options in the Spatial Query plugin
 need to be explained
Message-ID: <20150507124602.29c16129@gbd1>

Hello,

I am currently working on the QGIS user manual 2.8 and deal with two
options in the Spatial Query plugin we didn't explain so far:
- invalid source (source with geometry errors?)
- invalid reference

While 'Result feature IDs' when having run the plugin is easy to
understand we didn't manage to explain what the function of the other
two options is.

Can somebody help me?

Cheers, 
Larissa

Done. All GDAL and OGR algorithms have now a custom parameters dialog
which shows the console call in a text box as you modify parameter
values

Please take a look at it (it is master now) and let me know if you
have more ideas

Thanks for the clarification. But rules in the CMakeLists are a bit
different: it enables C++11 only for g++ >= 4.7 and for Clang (>= 4.1 on
mac and >= 3.2 elsewhere).

Does it mean we should always keep compatibility with non-c++11
compilers ? In this case, that means only features that have an
equivalent in C++03 are allowed ... which limits a lot the interest.

If we are ok to introduce c++11 features, it means we must state that a
c++11 compiler is needed (and not only optional). At least features
supported by the most limited one (MSVC 2010 in our case).

Thanks! Why not releasing a new version, for wider testing?
We already have several improvements pending.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with the MySQL/GDAL implementation in QGIS
Message-ID: <554B60D3.7020709@fu-berlin.de>

Hi,

I have a suspicion that the MySQL driver in QGIS is not working properly
when the MySQL database contains more than one table. I made tests with
pure command-line GDAL and this problem does not occur there. GDAL
queries all the tables, but only once, at the opening of the dataset.
QGIS however opens and quits the entire dataset for each row in a table
that is accessed. If there are 34 rows in a table and it is a single
table in the database, there will be 34 queries. If there are 80 tables
in the same MySQL database and I want to show those 34 rows of one
table/layer, then there will be suddenly 34x80 queries. Since this
happens each time a layer is zoomed in or zoomed out, edited, or an
attribute table needs to be opened, there are serious flaws in the
performance as a consequence - up to the point that QGIS becomes not
operational.

I described the problem in depth here:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/135865/why-are-mysql-connections-extremely-slow-in-qgis-2-0-2-8-when-compared-to-qgi

The logs can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1VM28puP8EPfmF2dGpjamVDWVZ6Vm1veHgtOElhY2lHb0ZTSlI1WXNuWWFvU3pRQmVLMTA&usp=sharing

I had a fruitful exchange on the gdal-dev mailinglist about this:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/gdal-dev-Problems-with-MySQL-queries-in-GDAL-td5204406.html

My current conclusions are:
1) the problem is likely in the implementation of MySQL/GDAL driver
since QGIS 2.0
2) The last version that worked fine was QGIS 1.8.
3) The connection string to mysql in GDAL can be limited to any
particular table. If this is implemented in QGIS, it would be a great
improvement for the performance.

I have big expectations from this list to finally understand why the
described problem occurs and how it can be resolved,

Best regards,
Pavol

This should rather read : "The problem is likely the implementation of OGR 
datasource management in QGIS since QGIS XXXX"

That would be at best a workaround. The real problem is the many 
opening&closing of OGR datasources which can be rather costly depending on the 
particular OGR driver

Looks nice, thanks. Main issue: text cannot be selected and copied.
Cosmetic issue: the box covers a good part of the dialog here.
Moreover, in GDALTools one can edit the call by hand, adding and editing
current parameters (not a crucial function, but I think it is useful).
I think the same approach should be extended to other backends where
appropriate (grass, saga, ...).
Thanks a lot! Now the main issue seems to be the icons (if you have a
look to Lecos subplugin of Processing, it is quite obvious they really
make it easier to approach the commands.
All the best, and again many thanks.

Any takers for this one? I'd like to render the active symbol for a layer as a QPixmap in a dialog.

I have got this far:

       s =  layer().rendererV2()
       key = s.rootRule().findRuleByKey(s.rootRule().ruleKey())

This tells me the active rule key to be rendered but how to get the image data?

Perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree here?

Hey Andrew,

This is how I did it with Roam to get all the legend items for the layer:

items = layer.rendererV2().legendSymbologyItems(ICON_SIZE)

That will give you a list of:Text - Icon pairs

if you are using the rule base renderer you get can the symbol for the rule
and paint that into a pixmap, however note that one feature can have many
symbols so you will have to use the method that returns a list for all the
symbols.

Depending on what you are doing  legendSymbologyItems might give you what
you need without extra work.

perhaps collapsed, within the dialog, rather than over it.
Moreover, the help is missing (better use the upstream, as we do for
grass), and this should be fixed before removing GDALTools.
Overall, we are pretty close, nice to get rid of even more redundancy!
Thanks.

Looks nice, thanks. Main issue: text cannot be selected and copied.
Cosmetic issue: the box covers a good part of the dialog here.
Moreover, in GDALTools one can edit the call by hand, adding and editing
current parameters (not a crucial function, but I think it is useful).
I think the same approach should be extended to other backends where
appropriate (grass, saga, ...).
Thanks a lot! Now the main issue seems to be the icons (if you have a
look to Lecos subplugin of Processing, it is quite obvious they really
make it easier to approach the commands.
All the best, and again many thanks.

Hello,

I need to save a PNG of QGIS canvas, but I need an empty background color
(like a glass window)

If I use :

mapCanvas.saveAsImage(input_file, None, "PNG")

I obtain a white background (like a piece of paper).


What is the correct settings to have a  break through   effect  in my image
?



Thank you for any info about this

Even is right again. I have made tests with QGIS 2.8.1 and PostGIS and
have experienced the same problem with opening and closing of OGR
datasources as with MySQL. And I need to add that it applies also to a
single table in a dabase.

Is there anybody on the list who is regularly using QGIS >2.0 with MySQL
or PostGIS spatial layers and who does not have this issue? (I just try
to understand, whether it is a general problem or whether it is specific
to my data or settings...)

Best,

PostgreSQL-Users probably don't use OGR to access the database - same for
SpatiaLite, Oracle or MSSQL users.

QGIS does multithreaded rendering and because OGR layers are not thread safe
the OGR provider always reopens the layer on every rendering run.  Apparently
that's not too expensive for file based data sources, which I think the OGR
provider is mostly used for.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Open hub tickets target versions
Message-ID: <20150508153706.GB15383@localhost>

As we're 2 days from the release of 2.8.2 I wanted to take a look
at the still open bugs candidated for backporting in the stable release.

I did this by querying all open tickets with Target Version = 2.8.2,
finding 32 of them, with many marked as blockers (should "blocker" be
used to block a release?).

Once 2.8.2 is out, should all those tickets be retargetted to 2.8.3 ?
This didn't happen when 2.8.1 was released as there are still 19 open
issues with TargetVersion=2.8.2 (including blockrs and crashers).

Jurgen was suggesting on IRC that pushing tickets forward on release
could be a waste of time and suggested only assigning a fixed target
version once the fix lands into the corresponding branch, using looser
targets for still-to-be-closed tickets (ie: 2.8 for the stable branch).

There's indeed a 2.8 target version in hub, which contains 33 tickets.

So, should all open ticket having target 2.8.x be moved to target "2.8" ?
It would be useful to have such tickets management policy written somewhere
and linked in the ticket edit form.

On further look, I realized there's no "2.8.0" version, so maybe the current
"2.8" sometimes refers to "2.8.0". If it has to be used as a placeholder
for "next release in the 2.8 branch" it should only have open tickets, but
it does have 130 closed tickets instead ...

My proposal: rename "2.8" to "2.8.0", open a "2.8.3" and move any still-open
ticket from "2.8.0", "2.8.1" and "2.8.2" to the newly created "2.8.3".

Blockers are just the highest priority for bugs.  But it doesn't actually mean
that they going to block a release.   The policy that every regression is
automatically a blocker no matter how minor it might be.  So minor things
could block a release.

master is released on a schedule and not an some targetted functional state
(which would require a level of control over our contributors that we don't
have).

I would prefer if we prioritize our bugs on their severity and not on whether
they are regressions or not.

I also think that the time used for deducing whether or not a bug existed in a
previous version could be used better, if that information is just used to
decide if the bug should be a so called blocker instead of contributing to
locating and fixing it.  Most of the time it's not necessary to know when a bug
was introduced to fix it - and once it's fixed, it's often easy to see where it
came from.

The "future version" target versions were introduced to avoid fake activity on
tickets, that are just moved from one version where they weren't fixed to the
next version where the probably won't be fixed either.

One should only assign a "real" target version, if the bug is going to be fixed
in that version - or maybe even better when it is actually fixed in that
version.

Oops, that doesn't make sense.  I meant to question that policy.  To me
regressions are not automatically more important than anything else.

So are you suggesting that only the "assigner" should set target ?
Only 1 issue over 19 targetted at 2.8.1 and still open have an assigner.

Whatever policy we end up defining, would there be a way for the software
to enforce it ? For example, a random ticket I looked at had TargetVersion
equal to AffectedVersion, which makes no sense (#12682)

The assignee - yes.  as there otherwise is a good chance the target won't be
met and we just end up moving it again...

I'd suggest installing VM Ware and running QGIS under Ubuntu.  You will have access to a console and better debugging facilities. You could even run the program under strace.   Ideally you want to see a stack trace so you can identify the pyqt commands that were executed prior to crashing.

Of course it could be operating system specific.  For windows, a quick google revealed this:

Triggered by this announcement, a recent bugreport about the Qt4WebKit
removal [1], and the discussion on this list, I've investigated
switching the qgis Debian package to Qt5.

In Debian there are at least two missing dependencies before the qgis
package can be switched to Qt5: python-qscintilla2 from the qscintilla2
source package, and libqwt-dev from the qwt source package.

qwt is currently at version 6.0.0, which is not intended for Qt5
according to upstream, for Qt5 Qwt >= 6.1 should be used. There is a
bugreport requesting an update to Qwt 6.1 from 2013 [2]. Fortunately
Ubuntu already has qwt 6.1.1 [3]. This packaging can be merged back into
Debian, Lisandro Dami?n Nicanor P?rez Meyer said he might take a look at
that.

qscintilla2 only provides Python 3 bindings for Qt5, there doesn't seem
to be a Qt5 equivalent for python-qscintilla2. So we may need to switch
QGIS to Python 3 too.

How feasible is switching to Python 3?

The Python maintainers in Debian strive to move away from Python 2 in
the next two development cycles (for stretch & buster) as announced [4]
earlier. The qgis package will need to switch in that time frame too.

2.8.1 don't work anymore.

1.? attempt:
I try to do a force version of gdal but i only have available the gdal
1.10.1 but even with this version i can't put qgis start to working.

2.? attempt:
Remove completely gdal and qgis but now when i try to install qgis, i have
this error:

Could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade

The following packages have unsolvable dependencies. Make sure that all
required repositories are added and enable in the preferences.

Every time a new version of gdal is uploaded, all its reverse
dependencies that rely on its C++ symbols need to be rebuilt.

See the discussion on the Ubuntu list:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/ubuntu/2015-May/001236.html

And the related discussion in the Debian gdal transition bugreport:

Hi Sebastiaan,

thanks for your quick answer. I read the links but how can i use this in
terms of terminal?

I read this part:

- add Provides: libgdal.so.1-${version} to libgdal1h (${version} being
  1.10.1 or 1.11.0)
- adjust libgdal1h.symbols.* to generate a dep on
  libgdal.so.1-${version} for all c++ symbols

Best Regards
Jo?o

I believe this would be a huge issue: most or all plugins will not work,
both the internal and the external ones, so our qgis will be badly lame.

You can't do much except rebuild the qgis package with the new gdal
1.11.2 package to fix the dependency issue.

The qgis rebuilds in the UbuntuGIS PPA failed [1] due an issue with the
grass << 7 dependency. Once that's resolved qgis should be installable
from the UbuntuGIS PPA again.

These changes where implemented in gdal (1.11.0+dfsg1-1~exp5), and for
subsequent upstream releases the virtual package dependency is bumped to
require the upstream same version. See for example:

http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-grass/gdal.git/commit/?h=experimental&id=eb297295aee168c6d8fb0ac741206541ec249cdf

I plan to restart the GDAL 1.11.2 transition in Debian unstable after
the PROJ 4.9.1 transition is complete and the rebuilt reverse
dependencies have migrated to testing.

Thanks to the great work by Johan Van de Wauw GDAL 1.11.2 is already
included in Ubuntu since vivid.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Right - there are no problems when connecting with the native QGIS
provider for PostgreSQL. What are the chances that MySQL also gets
native QGIS support that bypasses OGR?

The described OGR problem emerged with QGIS 2.0. Was that version
already influenced with multithreaded rendering? Anyway, it is not
only that the OGR provider reopens the layer on every rendering run.
It is instructed by QGIS to reopen SEPARATELY every record of that
layer and query it with all tables in the database on every rendering
run. So instead of simple "connect->select * from table...->quit" the
server will be flooded with literally thousands of reopenings that
cause QGIS to freeze for minutes (queries = number of records in the
table multiplied by number of tables in the database). I am not sure
what part of this behavior is intended in order to make the OGR
provider thread-safe and what is a bug? I can get rid of the
unnecessary querries of all tables with manually modifying the layer
connection settings in the .qgs file. But I do not know how to get rid
of reopenings for each record separately. Shall I file a ticket?

From my experience MySQL is rarely used for GIS - so the demand for a mysql
provider is very low.

No. MTR was introduced in 2.4.

That's odd.  QGIS just opens the OGR data source and the requested layer.  Does
536135a help?  It limits the data source opened for each layer to the table
it's going to request.

There will probably be no PyQt4/Qt5 package but only a PyQt5/Qt5 package?
If there's a PyQt4/Qt5 package the upgrade process should be rather
painless.
If there's none, all plugins will need an update anyway and IMO the two
changes PyQt5 and Python 3 should be grouped.
Sebastiaan, do you know anything about this package?

The other issue is that there's a rather big dependency on QtWebkit
currently. We are struggling already with that on Android.
Alternatives
* QtWebEngine is the future but only available starting from Qt 5.4. So
this is not an option now.
* QLabel/QML: Where it's only used for richtext, a QLabel can be used.
Where there's javascript involved it may be worth investigating the use

This change also affects composer in a big way, in that it's no longer
possible to have a HTML composer item. QtWebEngine has no support for
rendering using a QPainter, and without this ability we lose the
possibility of vector rendering of HTML content. Hopefully this is
addressed before QWebPage is removed from Qt5, but I honestly doubt it
will be.

I'm not sure what our alternatives are. We could fall back to using
QLabel and it's limited subset of HTML, or ..? In the meantime, I'd
suggest not relying too heavily on HTML content in compositions!

I'm not involved in the Python or PyQt packaging, so I have no
intimate knowledges of those packages.

Both the python-qt4 [1] and pyqt5 [2] packages in Debian have the same
people involved. They may be willing to provide a python-qt4 package
built with qt5.

The planned removal of the Qt4 WebKit component in Debian is the
primary reason to switch to Qt5. Sticking to the Qt5 Webkit until Qt
5.4 is widely available seems like the road of least resistance.

Seems a rather serious issue. Shouldn't we reconsider our roadmap accordingly?

That's a pretty serious drawback. If there's no way around this, we need to
make sure composer labels are improved (and hopefully plug in the canvas
label drawing engine to the composer labels).

The Debian Qt maintainers didn't give definitive dates in their
announcement [1], but they mention that Qt upstream is about to release
the last Qt4 point release (4.8.7), Qt upstream also recommends keeping
Qt4 until 2017 which translates to the end of the jessie stable release.

The next two years must be used to move away from Qt4 to Qt5. During
that time Qt4 components will be removed when they cannot be supported
anymore. The Qt4 Webkit component will be the first to go. Regarding its
removal the Qt maintainers said:

"
 Of course we still have a lot of KDE stuff using Qt4's webkit, so it
 won't disappear "soon", but it will at some point.
"

Switching to Qt5 and Python 3 for QGIS 3.0 sounds good.

Hi

What about considering alternative packaging methods? For example making an equivalent of the windows standalone package for Linux.  A long time ago I used to build QGIS and all its dependencies into a directory (e.g. /opt/qgis2.8)  and then use a launcher script to update the library paths to each in that dir with priority over the system libs. The result is something pretty portable and self contained. There are free NSIS like tools for Linux and we would no longer be reliant on which libraries are available on the host system. 

More recently we achieved similar results with Docker (e.g. https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kartoza/qgis-desktop/ <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kartoza/qgis-desktop/>) 

I appreciate that there are many good reasons to use shared libraries on an operating system, but there are also many good reasons not to:

* cross distribution binaries
* ability to install multiple concurrent versions of QGIS and know they will work (e.g. we recently had pain when software we wrote depended on QGIS 2.2 but was no longer installable from debian archives)
* we could provide all the extra goodies that give you a good experience and that are hard to get configured on each distort (grass, saga, OTB, goal with lots of drivers)

IIRC gdal used to follow this route in the past, and other non FOSS packages like Google Earth etc do too.

In our PSC thread referred to by Anita below, it became apparent that a lot of people will have a hard time if we jump to Qt5 & Python 3 as a requirement, so we should look for approaches (such, as but not necessarily,  the one above) that provide use some level of independence from the underlying OS and its provisioned packages.

Also much as I love debian, lets keep some perspective, it is probably a very small part of our established user base (the bulk being on Windows) and it does?t make sense to me to make the majority of users unhappy to keep the minority happy.

In our road map for migration from QGIS 2.x to 3.x we should definitely plan on supporting 2.x for an extended period in order to allow users and developers to migrate their work to the new platform. so any approach which implies a hard cut off of 2.x support would be suboptimal in my opinion.

Last thought: I wonder if debian plans on supporting the new snappy package format from Ubuntu which I believe will be used for desktop packages too from 15.10 (in addition to deb packages).

Regards

Tim

My apologies I missed the part about a 2 year transition period from Sebastiaan - which probably negates part of my message above.

Apparently a lot of people seem to miss that.   We might loose unstable support
at some point over the next two years.  But when that happens, we can adapt to
what's there then.  And I guess we'll have a much clearer picture of that will
require then.

If debian's timeframe was like ours, we would be in trouble - 2.8 can't be
maintained w/o Qt4, Python2 and PyQt4.   But when stretch is released, support
for 2.8 is long gone.

So I don't really see the urgency about this.   I would rather like to know
what it actually takes to support Python3 and PyQt5.  Did anyone try yet?

There is indeed no urgency yet. Since Debian has just released the
jessie stable release we're now at the point where we start working on
goals for stretch. These include moving away from Qt4 and Python 2.

The qgis package in the Debian testing/unstable (from which Ubuntu
syncs) will most likely stick to the LTRs from now on, and skip the
non-LTR releases in between.

Users in need of the latest non-LTR can still get it from QGIS repo.

Improving support for Python 3 and Qt5 are worthly goals for 3.0,
switching to those by default where supported seems ideal for the next
LTR or the one after.

Because of the wide variety of platforms supported by QGIS both Python
2/3 and Qt4/5 will need to be maintained alongside for some time.

Bas

My trials ended with missing dependencies.

The changes for Qt5 are in the Debian GIS git repository:

?Good, great that's settled!

I think we should start educating (plugin) devs and power users that a
switch to 3.0 will be necessary within a time frame of approx. 2 years
(Please correct me if I misunderstood) so they can take this information
into account when planning development.

If you agree, I can write a short blog post as a first step.

Best wishes,
Anita

The time frame for the switch from Qt4 to Qt5 is the next two years,
because in 2017 Qt upstream ends support.

The time frame for the switch from Python 2 to Python 3 in the next 4-5
years (two Debian release cycles). The next stable release (stretch)
will still have Python 2, the removal is planned for the release after
that (buster).

Kind Regards,

Bas

On mobile devices we are already locked in a situation without QtWebkit
(Partiallly due to vendor policies I believe). So I would very much
enjoy to see the usage of it being kept to as little as possible.

For those interested in the current state, that's what's required to
compile QGIS 2.8 without webkit:
https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS/commit/5a6168ea0f3f76c6a9809a5236943b3871096ec2

It's quite tedious to keep this patch up-to-date with master :-)

Best Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.8.2 'Wien'
Message-ID: <20150510201956.GA24726@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the point release of QGIS 2.8.2 'Wien'.
Wien is German for 'Vienna' - host city to our developer meet up in November
2009 and again in March 2014.

As point release it contains no new features, but 122 changes to fix bugs (see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_8_1...final-2_8_2 for a full
list).

Even when only fixes are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org/).  Please consult the
existing and closed issues there before filing any new ones.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page (http://qgis.org/).
More packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.

Thanks

We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many
folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).

From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate
time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please

Thanks Juergen. My aptitude is not finding the new version, is it still
uploading?

Thank you very much, J?rgen.

I see. Demand is evidently not high, but MySQL is improving steadily,
so it would be great to keep OGR functional in QGIS.

Yes, 536135a works. It eliminates all the queries that were not
related to the requested layer. This means a huge improvement for the
performance in cases where the database contains more tables.

The principal problem pointed out by Even however remains - the
repeated opening and closing of the OGR datasource for every record in
the table. I will try to figure out which nightly build between 1.8
and 2.0 release caused this change in behaviour. Since I cannot figure
it out in the code and need to try manually, this can take some time.
Unless someone else on the list can figure it out from the master code ...

It was most likely that one:

Not really.  That just causes it to be reopened for each layer in every
rendering job.   It doesn't explain why that should happen for each record,
does it?

Are there joins or relations in the project?

Hi,

No joins, no relations. The reopenings happen for every record even if
there is only a single table in a database.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Priority of Bug #12057 ?
Message-ID: <d0787246ab0747afb3ce8d8748a8afd7@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Dear devs,
With QGIS you delivered a really excellent product with tons of useful features and I am very fond of it. I am aware that you get lots of user requests and have to prioritize according to that. Yet, my humble feeling is that there is one topic which did/does not receive the attention it probably deserves.
Proper area and distance calculation is a central functionality of any GIS. It is used by probably 97.5% of the users and should work in any case and without the need for the user to define some (at least for beginners) non-obvious settings, which in addition can get changed back by QGIS without the user`s notice, e.g. when loading data in different CRS (including Open Layers). Unfortunately, this seems to be a long open issue in QGIS (see: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12057). If I may make one wish for the Hackfest next week, please make Bug #12057 (and related issues) a top priority of the event!
If such basic functionality gives wrong results, personally I would consider it as a risk for the good reputation of the QGIS project. Assume a user delivered project results to a customer, which are based on wrong area calculations (not unlikely that this happens), what do you think he or she feels about QGIS after that... And even if one discovers it beforehand. That does not exactly contribute to the user`s faith in the reliability of QGIS.
I dare say that this series of bugs is so severe, that if it gets fixed (hopefully one and for all), it would provide reason enough to justify a 2.8.3 release (BTW. Thanks for 2.8.2).
Probably also worth writing a test for this bug, given it`s (long) history?

Kind regards,
Stefan

Message-ID: <CALo1PHkofF48ZYP3aktQUWK+g-Hke-SO4Z=GrowqQNJ8eK6m1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am getting a rather strange message after using the make command, which
is preventing me from compiling my sources for a plugin. As a result, the
plugin doesn't show up in QGIS.

Message:

> ----------------------------------------
> Compiled translation files to .qm files.

> make: execvp: scripts/compile-strings.sh: Permission denied
> make: *** [transcompile] Error 127

Had an earlier issue but it was partly solved by installing PyQT4. I don't
really understand what's wrong.

I typed in prompt: *make test* and got:
>
> pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py  resources.qrc
> make: pyrcc4: Command not found
> make: *** [resources_rc.py] Error 127

Best wishes,

make: pyrcc4: Command not found

You have to install pyrcc4, if you're on Linux Ubuntu  or Debian it's in
the pyqt4-dev-tools package.

Thanks for the reply Alessandro,

Already done that. It still doesn't work yet, however I got the idea to
source it: source scripts/run-env-linux.sh /usr/bin/qgis-2.2/ and it worked
up, at least that command.

Unfortunately, when running make test command it get the same permission
error so at the moment I'm trying to set it using chmod but it doesn't seem
to be working.

Apparently, neither chmod +x scripts/compile-strings.sh nor chmod 001
scripts/compile-strings.sh work.
Whenever I use make test:

Hi Jo?o,

this happened to me, too. I also was frustrated that the upgraded gdal 
broke QGIS 2.8.1. I was not able to install it in any way, because of the 
broken dependency. Only yesterday was released a new version 2.8.2 of QGIS 
and it is installable gain.

Try to purge QGIS and other packages:

sudo apt-get remove --purge [write package name here, without brackets, of 
course :) ]

Then download the latest QGIS 2.8.2 from 
http://qgis.org/ubuntugis/pool/main/q/qgis/ and install package by package 
(choose the packages according to your distribution [precise/trusty] and 
architecture [amd64/i386] of your computer).

or

Maybe the qgis is already updated in the repositories. So first try 

sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass

Hope this helps. Best wishes,

Peter

Hi,

Make sure you are on a file system that support unix file execution
permission (no ntfs) and that it is mounted correctly.
Make also sure that the user running make is the same as the owner of
all files.

Thank you, Hugo!

That was a good tip, as I was checking the files I enabled the "allow
executing file as program". Whether that was the magic trick, I am unsure
but in any case now it's working. Same goes for the import qgis.core in the
Ubuntu terminal, no more import errors.

Hopefully, I can actually start to work on my plugin.

Best regards

Hi Stefan,

I agree this is an important area and deserves being addressed properly.
It is also one that would be perfect for a set of unit tests.

I noticed that you started to collect issues that have been filed
concerning this topic or related ones, I think this is a very good
initiative.

A good approach to deal with this topic would be to
 * create a list of variables that influence the calculation
 * create a set of combinations of these variables (or eventually a full
matrix) with expected results

Once this is formulated it should be straightforward to create unit
tests, see which calculations are wrong and then fix them while being
sure not to break others (because of the test suite).
Will you be present in Denmark?

Kind regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual layers for QGIS
Message-ID: <5550B87F.6040905@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I've been recently involved in the development of "virtual layers" for
QGIS. The topic has already been discussed previously. In a few words it
allows to craft SQL queries (with spatial support) on any vector
layer(s) that QGIS is able to load.

Now I have a plugin that is usuable and allows you to get familiar with
the concept and test it.

More details are given here (with links to some videos):
https://github.com/mhugo/qgis_vlayers

A binary version of the plugins for Windows 32bits is available here :
http://91.121.102.10/vlayers/qgis_28_vlayers_4_win32.zip

An integration of virtual layers in db manager is provided, but it is
better served with an improved version of db manager. A pull request
about this is being reviewed (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2025).
You can also directly find it here :
http://91.121.102.10/vlayers/db_manager_with_query_builder_and_vlayers.zip

Please do not hesitate to test this new functionality and report bugs or
requests (here or on the github page)

Now the next step would be to lead toward a proper integration into QGIS
core. I am already aware of some limitations that I have listed. I would
be happy to have any other feedback.

The hackfest next week could also be a good place to discuss it (I will
be presenting it during the conference)

Cheers.
Hugo

Hi R?gis,
Unfortunately, no. Having a clean 64bit build environment for Windows is
still on my todo list ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2.8.2: strange behaviour
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP165DAF29292995A522694F1A7DB0@phx.gbl>

hi devs,
here two strange situations:
- modifying the parameters included in a tool file, opening QGIS it 
still show the original version of the file;
- adding a tool in the LidarToolsAlgorithmProvider, QGIS still show the 
initial 13 ones (and not 14).
Any clue?

I'm working on some tools of the FUSION software in Processing and I 
just updated from 2.6.1 (where the same procedure worked perfectly).

Thank you in advance!

all the best,

Niccol?

Hei Matthias,

I am afraid I have to prioritize differently due to job obligations, even if Copenhagen is "just around the corner". I would have very much liked to join you. I hope to be able to attend next time...  However, if there is any means for me to contribute remotely (and if you consider it helpful), I will do my very best (I am no dev though and have only a very humble Python knowledge).

Cheers
Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Query performance in QGIS using psycopg2
Message-ID: <7CCEF44D1C42854999B19B1EB27281F64AF4D484@SR2ORBHQ2K803.angus.gov.uk>

Hello list

I have a question about how QGIS (specifically the pgRouting Layer plugin) uses psycopg2 and a connection to PostgreSQL to run a query and return a result.

I am using pgRouting with Ordnance Survey's Open Roads network for the UK.  It is a large network with over 3 million links and 2.6 million nodes.   Using the pgRouting Layer plugin in QGIS 2.6.1 and 2.8.2 to interact with the network.  It is really slow to solve routes ~ 1m20s per solution.  I am also using PgAdmin3 to run the same queries against the same network and they are also slow (~1m20s) but I can speed them up using a bounding box in the query (in some cases by 400x!).  In the pgRouting Layer plugin I have updated the djikstra.py file to use the query with a bounding box but the result is still returned in ~ 1m20s.  Running the same query in the SQL pane in DB Manager returns the result in ~ 100ms.

So, I guess the question is "Is psycopg2 (or python) the bottleneck in running queries in the pgRouting Layer plugin?" and maybe a secondary question is "how does DB Manager connect to the database and run the query so quickly?"

The queries

Without bounding box ~ 1m20s
SELECT seq, id1 AS node, id2 AS edge, cost FROM pgr_dijkstra('
                SELECT gid AS id,
                         source::integer,
                         target::integer,
                         cost_len::double precision AS cost,
                         rcost_len::double precision AS reverse_cost
                        FROM or_network',
               1190869, 586365, false, true);

With a bounding box ~ 200ms
SELECT seq, id1 AS node, id2 AS edge, cost FROM pgr_dijkstra('
                SELECT gid AS id,
                         source::integer,
                         target::integer,
                         cost_len::double precision AS cost,
                         rcost_len::double precision AS reverse_cost
                        FROM or_network
                        WHERE geometry && ST_Expand(
                        (SELECT ST_Collect(the_geom) FROM or_network_vertices_pgr WHERE id IN (1190869, 586365)),2000)',

Hi all.
Opening a project (Montpellier, from Lizmap demo) with QGIS 2.8.2
consistently crashes qgis. The same with 2.8.1 opens fine.
Anyone confirms?

Could it be an unclean build ?
Can you reproduce with commit a0017f9719e3a8d380b2ea3a555e2ef161a7ecda ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS freezes when wheelzooming own QGIS Server
	(https) WMS
Message-ID: <20150512155007.6a2c4519@linux-597c.site>

Dear List-members,

i have a Problem with a WMS from my own QGIS Server. Its on a
self-signed https Server. QGIS is able to load the wms and when I use
the ZoomIn/Out-Tool (magnifying glasses) everything works fine. As soon
as I zoom in with the Mousewheel more than two scale-levels at once,
however, QGIS freezes/crashes. I also tried a wms serving the
qgis-server-wms over my mapproxy instance. Same Result.

There is the QGIS Server example project called
natural_earth_110million.qgs. When I use this project locally and add my
mapproxy-wms to this project even wild wheel-zooming works, but only as
long as i dont delete the layers 'Claciated Area' (Vector) and 'Shaded
Relief' (Raster). This seems starnge to me.

Greetz,
Marc

Start by using Explain SELECT ...
And compare to see if the query planner is running the same way.

Using the pgRouting Layer plugin in QGIS 2.6.1 and 2.8.2 to interact with the network.  It is really slow to solve routes ~ 1m20s per solution.  I am also using PgAdmin3 to run the same queries against the same network and they are also slow (~1m20s) but I can speed them up using a bounding box in the query (in some cases by 400x!).  In the pgRouting Layer plugin I have updated the djikstra.py file to use the query with a bounding box but the result is still returned in ~ 1m20s.  Running the same query in the SQL pane in DB Manager returns the result in ~ 100ms.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Closing tickets not fixed in LTR
Message-ID: <5552477F.20009@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
usually we close tickets fixed in master, even when still present in the
stable version. While this seems a safe approach for normal releases,
I'm not so sure this applies well to LTR: leaving a ticket open, while
explaining that it has been fixed in master, will warn LTR users, will
help decide when moving to next non LTR version, and will prevent people
from opening the same issue again and again (quite likely over the
longer time span of the LTR release)
See hub.qgis.org/issues/3792 for an example.
Opinions welcome.
All the best.

Hi all.
Regarding the migration to Py3 and Qt5, would it be reasonable to have a
qgis-ng package, compiled with Py3 and Qt5, in order to help people
starting migrating their plugins and other application much in advance,
and smooth out the transition? New plugins can be tagged as min version
= 3, s not to interfere with normal work.
Of course this will make sense only if it does not require much work.
All the best.

in cases like the above does not make sense to me leave the ticket
open: the issue is fixed in master and for some reason it cannot be
backported.

+1. I think fixed in master should mean the ticket is closed.
Otherwise the bug tracker will become impossible to navigate and
filter by outstanding issues...

Can we have a tag or category or something for "possible backport" as
a better way of tracking these issues?

Hi,

I have a problem with javascript code in qgis-web-client to export the
shape files.

I try to follow the example of the file Customization-to-export.js to
export the layer that I capture with a bbox in qgis-web-client.

With firebug I have this error:


TypeError: QGIS.ExportProvider is not a constructor

ExportProvider = new QGIS.ExportProvider


Someone have any Idea?

I was building QGIS 2.6.1 from source and completed with no errors and
warnings.Then installed it.But running it caused errors all  of them
missing .dll files. How can I fix this.
I have tried to solve this and it came up with python binding errors that
it couldn't load the python library which is included correctly.

What about using "Target Version".
A bug fixed in master can be closed as long as it's "Target Version"
is master.
If someone thinks it should be also fixed in a stable branch, she could
change "Target Version" to the next stable release and re-open it.

(that's what I usually do)

Message-ID: <CAAE2-cmqoZ2AjoGADbiQqyEp2D68N5U+jcf-we=bL62TxsmiYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

my name is Filippo and I am new in this forum. For my thesis I am trying to
develop a QGIS plugin with Python. I have already read many stuff from the
web (Python cookbook, all the official web-pages and other blog) and then I
started to go through some plugin downloaded from the repository and
compare them (I do not know if I am allowed to write with which plugin I am
doing my comparisons). I have already used PluginBuilder to make the
starting files (py, ui, ...) and I have created the GUI from PyQt and
translated the ui file into the py file via Prompt MS DOS. But now I have
some problem to understand the "frame" behind a plugin.
Here some very general and basic questions (I need to stress that on the
web I haven?t found any source which goes in detail to the basics):

01 - In general, in my plugin I need to import a raster DEM and a vector
layer + some parameters. In my GUI (from PyQt) I created the places where
insert vector, DEM and variables. Each of this spaces has its own proper
name that should be (as I understood) entered in the main py file script (I
checked my "ui_<name>.py" file and as expected I found the name I entered
in PyQt). Now my question is: where (in which method in the main py file)
and how I recall my variables and parameters(within __init__ or in the
method which perform the analysis)? I ask because it is not clear where I
access my input data (in one plugin I compared I assume it was from
__init__, in another only in the method that perform the analysis... I
understand that maybe these differences are due to different needs, but I
wonder which is the easiest way, now I do not need something perfect from a
"script" point of view;


02 - It is unclear the relationship among all the methods within the main
py file (aka the class defined in the main py file), like __init__, initGUI
+ all the others. Some of them are default once the user create the files
with PlugIn Builder but I assume there is something more to know because
most of the plugin show the default and others, an other plugin only
__init__ and initGUI. In any case in my mind I figured out a method which
recall all the data from the GUI through the name defined in PyQt, then
another def method which takes them as input and perform the analysis and
finally another method to show/print the result, but still I do not get the
relationship among all those methods (I have already written some script
both with python and matlab and now in my mind the process in quite
straightforward but here in the plugin, involving a class and method I
hardly understand the frame);


03 - (more theoretical) I know that on OO paradigm I can define a class and
several method within that class. I have created some very simple classes
and in the __init__ method I set some arguments, e.g. two (I save the class
as a py file). Then I recall that py file in the IDLE I set something like
var = <class_name>(arg1, arg2). That?s clear BUT when I look into a QGIS
plugin, some times I read:

def __init__(self, iface):
        self.iface = iface
self.canvas = self.iface.mapCanvas()

"Canvas" is not listed in the arguments of __init__, why? I assume is a
sort of "property" of the self object.

[in detail here, what is "mapCanvas"? Is it a method of the object "iface"?
How the developer knew that "mapCanvas" had to be invoked? I ask because if
I go through the API classes of QGIS there are thousand of them and I do
not know where to start to look for]

04 - In the main py file of a plugin (usually the name of the plugin) I
always find a class definition. What I do not understand is when I recall
this class? As written above (question 03) when I create my class in a py
file, I can use it via IDLE. Can someone explain me which is the logic path
in recalling the classes (also in other file like "...dialog.py" a class is
defined BUT this class is imported finally in the main py file)

I hope to not be "out of topic".

Regards,

Filippo

Hi,

I have tested old qgis-dev masters from
http://download2.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/release/qgis/qgis-dev/.

1.9.0-174 is still working fine with OGR, the next available archive
file 1.9.0-368 has already the OGR-Problem. This means that the change
that triggered the problem occurred between 25th January 2013 and 27th
August 2013. I cannot specify it better unless someone points me to an
archive with more qgis-dev.

Best wishes,
Pavol

Dear QGIS developers and users,
I have applied in QGIS Conference in Copenhagen with talk about
GIS.lab project [1] which is using QGIS as the main GIS desktop
frontend and server. I wanted very much to explain the basic
principles of this system and the possible benefits of GIS.lab for
QGIS project. Also, I wanted to discuss possibilities of helping with
QGIS development and LTS releases.

Unfortunately, few days ago my wife become seriously ill with pneumonia
and she is now in hospital. I was left at home with three small
children. It is impossible for me to attend the conference and
developer's meeting.

If anybody interested, I will try to achieve these goals at FOSS4G
Europe in Como. It seems that Copenhagen will be fantastic event. Have
a nice time.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labels: Return displayed as square in Windows
Message-ID: <5554686B.5080207@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I noticed that in Windows adding a return inside a string in a text
label expression, like:
'This is
a field: ' || FIELDNAME
shows properly in my linux box, but an empty square is displayed in
Windows. I tried several fonts, both TrueType and not.
Is there an explanation for this?
As a side note, the return and the option to replace a character
(typically space) with return do not interact nicely, the return within
a string not being used.
Thanks for feedback.

Can't confirm your issue. the return in the text is well applied on 2.8.2
(osgeo), windows 8 32bits.

Indeed, there's an issue. Tested widely and these are my conclusions :
- if the return and the wrap character are in the same string, the return
is not taken into account, it becomes a simple space;
- if the wrap character appears before the return, even in a separate
string, the return is not taken into account, it becomes a simple space.
- Only returns written before a wrap character, in a separate string, are
applied.

Hoping that helps.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Request for a full translation of QGIS project
Message-ID: <CAECJsSpFd8+_OtLJGRf5w2rs3xkrVrAtfLLtahTRHkKjp0HT3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
One of the main arguments I use when I praise QGIS virtues with my
relations is its modularity. Indeed, through plugin system, you can have
access to many different tools to improve the Core software and almost do
whatever you want.
But unfortunately, In spite of the efforts of all, this system lugs some
gaps IMHO. At least for the non native english speaker I am (either from
user or contributor side).

1/ Suppose you are someone who is looking for a plugin to do something.
There is a search bar in QGIS Desktop "Manage and Install plugins...'
dialog. but you first need to find what's the corresponding terms in
english to do your research. How many times did I begin to write a search
text in french before realizing that it should be in english if I want to
have better (succesfull?) returns?

2/ I agree that it's up to plugin developpers to provide localized plugins.
Good practice recommend plugin to be written in english. You can then
translate but in the informations retrieved by "Manage and Install
plugins...' dialog, I don't think it's possible to show tag, description,
name... in any language other than English, unless you mixed the languages
in the same "row".
Once installed, you get localized informations when provided (tested with
Mask plugin in french). Wouldn't it be better to have those informations
(tag, about, description, changelog...) only in the localized language,
before I install the plugin?

3/ Another place to look for informations about plugins is
https://plugins.qgis.org/. But this website is only in English. I think it
also deserves to be translated as we've done with QGIS DeskTop,
documentation and main website. This page is the main place to have
informations about plugins (rules to create them, to publish them and also
to know them). There are many tags that can be translated to facilitate
searches.
 It's very important when you are a beginner or want to contribute...

In brief, I think that QGIS project should provide more capabilities to get
translated informations about plugins (either in the plugin's website and
in "Install plugins" dialog) :
- offer an user looking for a plugin informations in the more suitable
language wherever, and without having to install the plugin
- offer to plugin developper translatable and working (?) options: for
example, changelog[fr] in EasyCustomLabeling plugin metadata does exist and
shows nothing but about[fr] worked properly
- and maybe later, we'll talk about translating qgis building instructions (
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.html)
:) for testers?

I don't know how technically it can be done but think it'll be a good
improvement for the project.
Sorry for the length of the message and hoping to read u soon...

Hi,

I agree with you that this would be a nice feature!


At least for the official plugin repository we should continue to require
that english is always available but support for more translations in
plugin title, description and maybe tags would be a really useful
enhancement.

Support for plugin translations in the plugin installer (your point /1 and
/2)  needs that translation support is added to metadata parser and
validator, the plugin installer, the plugin website (your /3) and perhaps
also to the plugin builder (the plugin) and other plugin building tools.

Unfortunately, this requires quite a lot of work, is there anybody out
there willing to help or fund this development?

The machines here are old XPs, no idea if this could make a difference.
Anyone has the chance to test it mor eproperly? I do not have access to
the machines outside a course.

It does, going to open a ticket.

With the similar command from GDAL backend

processing.runalg("gdalogr:createpointsalonglines","/home/paolo/fiumi.shp","geometry",0.5,"",None)

I get:

GDAL execution console output
layer names ignored in combination with -sql.
Segmentation fault

Thanks.

this is a warning and can be ignored

this is not processing (or the specific tool) issue. Lately on Linux I
have seen many gdal tools seg fault (from the command line).

Hi Giovanni,
too bad. I have used 2.8 until now in production, and never seen it.
Could someone find a pattern? I did not see news about this on gdal-dev.
Thanks.

Hi Enzo,

Thank you for your translation work. Ideally, you could do a pull

Thanks,

Hi Zoltan,

You are right. The two formats are incompatible - and there is no 
documentation of ArcGIS file formats available.

If you know documentation about the ArcGIS Map package format (is this 
different from mxd?) there would be hope.

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
Drat!
Although I did think as much.

As a non-ESRI user that kind of makes life  more difficult creating 
deliverables.

Good old "monopoly at work" situation.
Would be kind of nice if this was viewed as anti-competitive :-)

Thanks for your 2c.
Regards,
Zoltan

Hi

"Map packages include a map document (.mxd) and the data referenced by
the map layers packaged into one portable file."
It's about sharing ArcGIS data with styling.

So, there are two parts: 1. a prorietary data format and 2. a
prorietary styling.

Actually, we've proposed a similar thing for QGIS called "QGIS
All-in-one Project" and began to implement a plugin [1].
It's well-defined and based on open formats.

So, how about paying a programmer to 1. enhance the QGIS All-in-one
Project plugin and 2. asking Esri if they could implement an import
for this :-)

Yours, Stefan

This looks like Debian Bug #785091 (https://bugs.debian.org/785091)

SpatiaLite 4.1.1 on Debian testing/unstable is now built with Proj 4.9.1
causing issues with the non-threadsafe spatialite_init() method.
spatialite_init_ex() should be used instead. See the related discussion
on the SpatiaLite Users list:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/spatialite-users/v-RCCrx5GoM/OruNkGnZG-IJ

To fix this in Debian we need to transition from GDAL 1.10.1 to 1.11.2
to get the spatialite_init_ex() support in GDAL, and we also need to
transition from SpatiaLite 4.1.1 to 4.2.1 but the final release is not
out yet. GDAL will use spatialite_init_ex() for SpatiaLite >= 4.1.2.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,

thanks for finding this!

This is a serious problem...

@devs: I can do without spatialite at this moment. Can I build QGIS
without that? Is see some options: WITH_QSPATIALITE (OFF by me) and
WITH_PYSPATIALITE (tried both ON and OFF)... But not a WITH_SPATIALITE?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks bas for the clarification. Looks a pretty serious thing, making
QGIS barely usable (I'm getting other crashes as well, apparently related).
Anything we can do to speed up a fix?

It may be possible to fix the underlying issue in libproj, but I'm not
sure what change between PROJ 4.8.0 and 4.9.1 causes the previous
spatialite_init() usage to become problematic now.

Helping SpatiaLite upstream to release 4.2.1 final soon is a way to
help. I'm waiting for that release before starting the spatialite
transition. The current 4.2.1-RC1 release has an issue with its library
versioning decrementing the SOVERSION from 7 to 6 whereas it should be
incremented to 8. See the discussion on pkg-grass-devel@:

http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-grass-devel/2014-December/025981.html

I'll patch this issue in the Debian package and forward it upstream, at
the same time inquire about the final 4.2.1 release.

I prefer to first transition from SpatiaLite 4.1.1 to 4.2.1 before
transitioning from GDAL 1.10.1 to 1.11.2 because the former has fewer
reverse dependencies to verify. There is also an outstanding issue how
to best transition GDAL, see the discussion with the Release Team:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=756867#45

If I remember correctly, pyspatialite failed to build with spatialite
4.2.x. That would need to be fixed before starting the spatialite
transition. QGIS is the reverse dependency of pyspatialite in Debian, so
it's not a package we can drop.

Since QGIS doesn't use spatialite_init_ex() at all, I think you should
focus on addressing that. I'll do my best to get the gdal & spatialite
transitions started in Debian soon.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Value map behaviour for data entry and display
Message-ID: <5558EA37.9030208@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
the current behaviour of the widget id:
* user defines a table of Values and Descriptions for a field
* then a dropdown list of Descriptions is displayed during data entry
*and* table display
* the Value is actually entered into the table, but the user is unaware
of it.
This is inconsistent with the behaviour of other tools (e.g. checkboxes,
where the value is displayed), and more seriously makes it virtually
impossible to filter and select record based on that field, since the
user never knows the real value.
Our suggestion is to insert *and* display the real value, perhaps
showing the description as a tooltip onMouseOver.
All the best.

Only if the use didn't setup the value map and is unaware of value maps.

Working with (nice) description which using (possibly unmemorizable) keys is
the point of the value maps.   Why use value maps in the first place if that's
not desired?

Which is quite likely, e.g. I can prepare a complex project with forms

Isn't that an edge case?  When using value map you usually don't have to care
about the key values at all.  And for edge cases you could also include
the key values in the description and have both.

I agree.  The current behavior is the correct one.  If you need to see the
values just add them to your description (maybe we can have that as a auto
option)

Hi Nyall and all,

Paolo told me that there is some work (by Nyall) on adding statistical
functions to QGIS core. Is it possible to get some details about this
work?

We are planning to merge DataExplorer and Statist plugins into single
one and such functionality will be really useful for us and hopefully allow
to avoid code duplication. Maybe we also can help with implementation.

Unfortunately I will not attend this hackfest in person, but I available via
IRC and, if necessary, Skype.

Thanks

Packaging" next steps, including 'creatensis.pl' in 'qgis / ms-windows / osgeo4w 'file can not be run with NSIS, behind "4.1.5 Packaging your own build of QGIS" and "4.1.6. Osgeo4w packaging" I can not understand this.         I want my compiled files are copied to other computers can run, I tried a lot of ways, but finally failed. For example, I put all the dynamic link libraries in the ?E: \ Build \ output \ bin \ RelWithDebInfo \ ?folder, and qgis.exe in the same directory, then the qgis-2.0.0 source code is also placed agree folders below, and then the entire Build folder to another computer, this still can not run.
         I would like to ask how step by step to solve my problem,How can I package my own build of Qgis,THANK YOU !

yes, but AFAICT not exactly: if the category matches the name of a menu
(e.g. Vector), the plugin will appear there; if not, it will go
somewhere, without people knowing it.
Thanks.

Hmm, yes, if author does not cares about adding plugin to the proper
menu (native QGIS or added by plugin itself), plugin will be added to
the Plugins menu by default.

Yes. Moreover, some plugins do not add a menu entry, but buttons (e.g.
for editing), and this is very difficult for users.
All the best.

Agreed; we are almost there, only about 2k? to go. It would be a pity to
miss the last step: the only full topological editing available!

It's not really clear what you actually did.  "'creatensis.pl' in 'qgis /
ms-windows / osgeo4w 'file can not be run with NSIS", sounds like you tried to
somehow run creatensis.pl with NSIS, although it's a perl script that itself
runs (make)NSIS.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSqX=pyy4g3wGcAmP4rVyHrtPx7yb5ZV-tGDFc0_DZNO4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm tring to build a graphical modeler within the menu Processing. In my
process, I need at a moment to select features from a csv table. But none
of the "select..." algorithms (select by attribute, select by
expression...) I can find in the algorithms list does accept table as input.
Is there a solution? Or is it a bug so that I report it?

Thanks

Having an option would be great!  In one of our forms, we have a soil
classification field.  The students that are entering borehole data relies
on the description while the Geologist rather look at the code.  An option
to show both would be code and descriptions would be great!

BTW, raster/vector import via browser is in master (pushed today), you can test.

Dual build (with GRASS 6 + 7) is also available. Big thanks to Jef for
porting dual build to Windows.
Currently there is unfortunately some problem in browser with GRASS 7
vectors (crash), but GRASS 7 vectors load correctly from project file
(e.g. project created in GRASS 6, vectors upgraded to GRASS 7 and
project reopened in QGIS with GRASS 7).

I'll do more detailed announcement after QGIS 2.10 freeze.

Hi all.
Following a suggestion from Juergen, I'm again here to suggest to use
for our bugs the Debian system:
https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities
To me it seems the most simple and reasonable system. Of course we will
need minor adaptation to definitions, but I think we'll easily agree on
that.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAKmunxAG_C74-s3RXknQn-YKb8+GZZXQntTGMJHcA0X+CqzodQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

   - I am having trouble configuring QWC to work as qwc.my_domain.com
   - I have qgis-server up and running as I can add it as a wms layer into
   my QGIS desktop with no problems
   - I'm running ubuntu 12.04 server with apache 2.2
   - I've ran the QGIS-web-client/install.sh
   - I can see the qgis-web-client.conf in my /etc/apache2-sites-enabled/
   - I've edited my /etc/hosts file to have 127.0.0.1
   qgis-web-client.localhost
   - my apache2 recognizes that localhost is its name
   - I would like to change the settings so that I have qwc.my_domain.com/
   <etc>
   - I attempted to change my qgis-web-client.conf ServerName and
   ServerAlias to point to qwc.my_domain.com
   - I changed /etc/hosts to 127.0.0.1 qwc.my_domain.com
   - whenever I try that link, I get "the server at qwc.my_domain.com can't
   be found, because the DNS lookup failed.
   - No errors are returned on /var/log/apache2/access.log, error.log or
   any of the two qgis-web logs concerning this issue
   - even in default configuration, i don't think QWC is working as I tried
   http://qgis-web-client.my_ip/<bla>

Thanks

confirmed, both vectors and rasters (all G6) work fine. vectors look
very fast.

I see a double antry, one with the usual folder icon showing the full
content, and one with grass logo showing only the layers: is this a
temporary solution, or is it made on purpose?
Thanks a lot.

Yes, I'd also prefer that scheme.  I also don't see regressions as extra
serious - if there is a regression it's severity should still be evaluated as
for all other bugs and it should not automatically get the highest available
severity.

confirmed, both vectors and rasters (all G6) work fine. vectors look
very fast.

I see a double entry, one with the usual folder icon showing the full
content, and one with grass logo showing only the layers: is this a
temporary solution, or is it made on purpose?
Thanks a lot.

Confirmed, it's the same issue Richard has reported, and Bas explained.
Strange that you have seen segfaults on other systems, it should be
Debian Sid specific.
Thanks.

It is intention, since the browser very beginning. The idea is that
the directories should not be hidden from users even if representing
specific provider data structure. For example, the user may want to
open a dbf table from GRASS location using OGR provider. Do you have
suggestions how represent GRASS locations better in the browser?

Hi all.
Does this imply we have to change the qgis provider for SL?

few technical details useful to understand better:

a) starting since November 2013 it become definitely clear
   that the older self-registration mechanism based on the
   spatialite_init() API was intrinsically thread unsafe
   and could potentially have very bad interactions with
   the more recent versions of both PROJ.4 and GEOS

b) consequently a public announcement [1] was duly released
   warning about the deprecation of spatialite_init()
   and soliciting developers and maintainers to start
   supporting the alternative thread safe mechanism based
   on spatialite_alloc_connection(), spatialite_init_ex()
   and spatialite_cleanup() APIs.

c) all recent versions of libspatialite, spatialite-tools
   and spatialite_gui are now expected to be fully thread
   safe: and AFAIK the same is for recent versions of GDAL.
   any obsolete version still based on the nowadays deprecated
   spatialite_init() API is potentially at risk when deployed
   in a multithread configuration.

I see: in fact the folders are displayed, which is confusing, but the
content is filtered (only readable files, like dbf), so the solution
seems the best one, in fact.
I noticed that one can add grass data from the browser, but to use the
toolbox one should open a location
Moreover:
* should the "add vector" and raster buttons be removed from the toolbox?
* testing a sample command, I get an empty dialo, and at the second
opening I get "Cannot find module r.compress"
* the man pages are no longer found:
?Cannot find man page /usr/lib/grass64/docs/html/r.compress.htmlPlease
ensure you have the GRASS documentation installed.
Sorry to report too many issues, perhaps too early.

Message-ID: <1507167991.6018411432039115947.JavaMail.httpd@webmail-16.iol.local>

Hi,
is there a pyqgis solution to fetch the features that are canceled with 
"delete selected features" tool?


I used this code in "Project Properties --> Macro":

layer = iface.activeLayer()
layer.committedFeaturesRemoved.connect(ConfirmTratDeleted)

def ConfirmTratDeleted(layer,fids):
        for fid in fids:
            iter = layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(fid))
            feat = iter.next()
            geometry = feat.geometry()

but it returned thi error:

    An error has occured while executing Python code:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "", line 234, in ConfirmTratDeleted
     StopIteration

I suppose because the features are committed and don't exist anymore.

Somebody can help me to understand how to get features that were deleted?

Thank you in advance

Enrico

committedFeaturesRemoved notifies you that the feature were actually removed -
so they don't exists anymore.  But you can use the featureDeleted signal
that provides a feature id of a (to be) deleted feature and use that
to fetch it from the provider (layer.dataProvider().getFeatures...)

If you actually need the features after the are actually deleted, you can
store them in the featureDeleted slot and use the saved copy to in your
committedFeaturesRemoved slot.

certainly yes: any C/C++ sw component directly linking libspatialite
is expected to urgently switch from the deprecated spatialite_init()
to the new thread safe approach based on spatialite_alloc_connection(),
spatialite_init_ex() and spatialite_cleanup()

a perfectly equivalent approach could be the one based on dynamically
loading the "mod_spatialite" extension module on the top of libsqlite
thus definitely removing any direct linkage between the application
and spatialite itself.

this second approach is universal and is absolutely language agnostic
(and is fully thread safe as well).
the calling app simply has to execute the following SQL query on behalf
of any SQLite connection requiring SpatiaLite support:

SELECT load_extension( 'mod_spatialite' );

this is the way usually adopted by Java/JDBC, Python, PHP, C# .NET
(and many others), and there are many pros in this approach:
- the external dynamic module will silently take care of any required
   initialization and finalization step.
- any external dependency from libspatialite headers and binaries
   will completely disappear, because this one simply is a pure SQL
   extension mechanism and is completely invisible at C/C++ level.
- the app and the module will be mutually independent; if you wish
   to upgrade SpatiaLite to a more recent version you simply have
   to replace mod_spatialite (and its related dependencies) and
   that's all.
- there is an obvious con: if for any reason the dynamic extension
   module will fail to load you'll probably experience an unexpected
   fatal failure directly at run time.
   and this explains why many C/C++ apps still continue to support
   the standard approach based on direct linking.

the classic C/C++ initialization method based on direct linkage
now works as follows:

Connection:
----------------------
c1. get a valid SQLite handle by calling sqlite3_open_v2()
c2. allocate a spatialite's internal opaque object by calling
     spatialite_alloc_connection()
     the handle pointing to this opaque object must be preserved
     during all the connection's lifetime.
c3. then you can initialize SpatiaLite on that connection by
     calling spatialite_init_ex(sqlite_handle, opaque_internal_handle)

Termination:
---------------------
t1. you should first invoke sqlite3_close() as usual.
t2. and immediately after you should finalize the internal opaque
     object by calling spatialite_cleanup()
     [you are obviously expected to pass to this API exactly the
     same pointer returned by the previous call to
     spatialite_alloc_connection() for the corresponding connection]

all this nicely fits into a typical C++ class supporting Open()
and Close() methods; and in this case the internal opaque pointer
will simply be a private class member.

from a quick glance at the QGIS sources I notice that there are
many calls to sqlite3_open(), sqlite3_close() and spatialite_init()
dispersed here and there within the code of both e.g.
qgsspatialiteconnection.cpp and qgsspatialiteprovider.cpp

a preliminary reordering work mainly focused on centralizing
all Open() and Close() operations in a single C++ class will
presumably made the transition to the new spatialite_init_ex()
model absolutely painless.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] About Packaging my own build of QGIS----Building
	on Windows
Message-ID: <tencent_6E4E42CA4193C27075CC4FD7@qq.com>

I made reference to the site https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc13, my computer installed the windows 7 system, using the Qgis 2.0.0 version of the source code,I completed the compilation of the source code and generates a qgis.exe, I'm having a lot of problems from the "4.1.4. Packaging" next steps, including 'creatensis.pl' in 'qgis / ms-windows / osgeo4w 'file can not be run with NSIS, behind "4.1.5 Packaging your own build of QGIS" and "4.1.6. Osgeo4w packaging" I can not understand this.         I want my compiled files are copied to other computers can run, I tried a lot of ways, but finally failed. For example, I put all the dynamic link libraries in the ?E: \ Build \ output \ bin \ RelWithDebInfo \ ?folder, and qgis.exe in the same directory, then the qgis-2.0.0 source code is also placed agree folders below, and then the entire Build folder to another computer, this still can not run.
         I would like to ask how step by step to solve my problem,How can I package my own build of Qgis,THANK YOU !

Yes. When a source is dragged to a GRASS mapset in the browser, the
target mapset is known. When modules are run in the toolbox, we must
get somehow info about location/mapset the module should be run
within. That is why a mapset must be open. Any idea how to do it
better?
Note also that the packages 1) and 2) which go to QGIS 2.10 do not
cover plugin tools, that is left for QGIS 2.12.

> Moreover:

I would like to remove them, but I am not sure if there is general
consensus on it. We have still "add layer" tool buttons for all other
providers.

It seems like if GISBASE was not pointing to the correct GRASS package
dir. Try to set GISBASE envar a path to the GRASS package before
starting  QGIS. Most probably the GISBASE is set to  /usr/lib/grass64/
but that dir does not contain the whole GRASS, just libs? It seem like
a packaging problem.

> Sorry to report too many issues, perhaps too early.

Yes, too early. First I have to get to the master everything what I
promised for 2.10, then we can play with fixes and cosmetics. Thanks
for testing however.

Would it be feasible to load automatically the mapset of the first layer
loaded? Of course, only layers from the same location would be available
for analyses.

IMHO we should get rid of them ASAP. Currently we cannot do it, because
we still have additional features not present in the browser, but the
sooner the better.
In case of GRASS, I do not see any advantage of having them there,
except if someone has the Browser closed (something we should discourage
nowadays.

Strange however, it worked fine without tweaking the install.
All the best.

Hey Alexander,

I'm happy to talk about this - I'll be on IRC off and on for the next
couple of days if you want to catch me.

I can't find any info on the DataExplorer plugin, is that in the repo?

Feasible yes, not sure if it is really desired. Generally, I don't
like if an action does more than it is expected.
What about "Open mapset" action on mapset item in the browser?

OK, I'll remove them.

It could be introduced by dual build:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/7d4eb8b
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/c0090d8

Or maybe you have gisbase in ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf ?

sounds good to me; I would suggest to remove the duplication on the menu
bar then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ftools to processing : geometry validity checker
Message-ID: <555D79A1.1070308@camptocamp.com>

Today at the hackfest.

I will port the ftool geometry validity checker to processing,
with small implementation differences:
     I will add method selector [QGIS|GEOS] as a parameter
     I will make two outputs:
         one for the valid ones
         one for the invalid ones with one supplementary field for the 
reason/comment of the invalid state

Comments are welcome

Arnaud

Merci Arnaud,
I'm available for early testing, just let me know when ready for it.
All the best, and thanks for this useful addition. As discussed, I think
it would be good to add it together with Make Valid from
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processinglwgeomprovider/
so users will be able to check the validity and fix it in the most
possible straightforward manner. This would require only the automatic
path configuration for lwgeom, and its addition to the standalone
installer. The code itself is quite solid and tested.
All the best.

AFAICT, it can only happen if you have GISRC set, but the file does
not exist or it is corrupted. Try to unset GISRC envar and it should
run.

It should not crash of course, the exception is now caught (8c8a123).

BTW: "qgsgrass.cpp: 483: (error_routine), [4ms]  error_routine (fatal
= 1): G_getenv(): Variable GISDBASE not set" says that the build is
rather old, the last qgsgrass.cpp commit with that row was 7091d3, May
18. Please use a fresh build if possible.

I think this is due to Processing, that sets temp grass variables.

sorry, I'm using packages now. will do more tests with a fresh version,
when you'll ask for it.

I see:
algs/grass/GrassUtils.py 250: os.putenv('GISRC', gisrc)

I think that Processing should not set GISRC globally, it should
rather start modules with that envar. QGIS may be started from GRASS
shell, in that case the plugin is using GISRC to setup active mapset
so it must not be changed. The plugin is also setting GISRC globally
when a mapset is opened, but that is correct, because it also locks
the mapset and in that case it works like a GRASS shell.

Victor, could you please remove
  os.putenv('GISRC', gisrc)
  os.putenv('GRASS_MESSAGE_FORMAT', 'gui')
  os.putenv('GRASS_BATCH_JOB'...
is not it enough to set them in createGrassScript()?

Hi,

After having tested builds based on particular commits of QGIS source
code I can confirm that Matthias is right. It must be the commit below
(or something related to it implemented on the same day) that
instructs OGR to open and close the dataset for every record and thus
causes substantial delays.

The build of 0b9d1dc (from 21st June 2013) results in a QGIS crash
with segfault. Yet the preceding commit for qgsogrprovider.cpp
(9bbc647 from 20th June 2013) still works perfectly, while the
successive commit (6876540 from 21st June 2013) has already the
described OGR excessive reopenings problem.

Is there a chance that someone corrects this particular code for the
next release?

Best wishes,
Pavol

P.S.: According to what I know the problem is reproducible with any
MySQL or PostGIS table connected via OGR. Should someone need a MySQL
testing environment for this purpose, contact me please off-list.

Hi there,

you're probably are already aware that the original date for the feature freeze
was tomorrow at 12:00.  As we're making good progress at the hackfest in N?debo
and have still some pending new stuff I'm extending the development period for
three days so it's now on Tuesday, May 26th 2015, 12:00 UTC.

Thanks to everyone and keep up the good work.

The python bindings don't work with Qt5 yet.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS CRS handling question
Message-ID: <20150522094232.62a10156@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

I would like to understand QGIS behavior a little better for CRS handling. 

I have a tif/tfw file (input.tif) and would like to create compressed geotiff
tiles from it (output.tif).

1) When I use

gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co TILED=YES \
 -a_srs EPSG:25833 input.tif output.tif

gdalinfo shows:

Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF
Files: output.tif
Size is 16100, 15300
Coordinate System is:
LOCAL_CS["ETRS89 / UTM zone 33N",
    GEOGCS["ETRS89",
        DATUM["unknown",
            SPHEROID["unretrievable - using WGS84",6378137,298.257223563],
            TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","25833"],
    UNIT["metre",1]]
[...]

loading this file in QGIS I am asked to provide the CRS for the layer,
although it should be written in the GeoTiff header. 

2) When I use 

gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co TILED=YES \
 -a_srs "+proj=utm +zone=33 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m \
 +no_defs" input.tif output.tif

gdalinfo shows:

Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF
Files: output.tif
Size is 16100, 15300
Coordinate System is:
PROJCS["UTM Zone 33, Northern Hemisphere",
    GEOGCS["GRS 1980(IUGG, 1980)",
        DATUM["unknown",
            SPHEROID["GRS80",6378137,298.257222101],
            TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
    PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",15],
    PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
    UNIT["metre",1,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]]]


loading this file in QGIS, I am *not* asked to provide the CRS for the
layer, but QGIS assigns the wrong CRS. In my case I want EPSG 25833 but get
EPSG 3006 (which has the same parameters as 25833, but is not what I want).

How can I make QGIS read the CRS correctly? Does anybody has a solution for
this?

Thanks a lot
Otto

without python bindings of course?
I am using Qt5.4.1

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Icons for Processing algs
Message-ID: <CALuHMPCKazikmPhPT3EGnJjFcbb+H-UOE1A0SOBA--KnnEkwmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we already agreed about replacing fTools (not sure about GDALTools) with
Processing algorithms. If I'm not wrong there is even some work in progress
in this direction.

Should we reuse icons from fTools/GDALTools for corresponding Processing
algs? IMO this will help users to find algorithms more quickly. Opinions?

Yes, that's what I proposed; reusing icons already available will
improve usability and consistency.
I'm available for help.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <9336548C77CBD148947AAD0B75A416FA32F6F83B@Mail.wareco.nl>

Dear QGIS users,

I am experiencing a problem using Qgis 2.6.1 (and several prior versions) via thin client systems. 

The machines are running Windows Server 2008 and Citrix Receiver. The problem is that edits to vector shapefiles are not always saved, while the 'save edits' button is pressed and the changes are visible in the attribute tables. After reopening the vector file later, it appears that sometimes (randomly) the changes are lost/were not saved to the file. We save our files to a network drive. This works fine with other software and on our desktop systems. This problem only occurs on our thin client systems. 

Did anyone experience this problem before and/or knows a possible solution or workaround?

Kind Regards,

Check current master.  The commit 7a629ad from Sandro Mani should cure the
problem.   I also should help with other performance problem introduced by the
reopening of the OGR data source on each layer feature iteration.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compile QGIS master with support for GRASS
Message-ID: <20150522124057.GA5291@tpx1c2g>

I am compiling qgis from master (git). Both GRASS and GRASS7 are set to
ON and the the corresponding GRASS_PREFIX, GRASS7_PREFIX are set to

/osgeo/grass64/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu and
/osgeo/grass70/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.

I launch QGIS without installing it, ie from inside the bin directory.
It runs fine.  However, I can't see anywhere in QGIS' interface any
reference to GRASS. Plus, many of the icons do not appear at all (ie
icons of the advanced digitizing bar).

What am I doing wrong?
Thanks, Nikos

Hi, we have the very same config here. No report of such troubles here until
now (not meaning that it does not happens).
2.6.1 encounters mainly troubles with corrupting some qgs on save. 

More generally with QGIS, we have troubles having a good screen reactivity
with thin clients WYSE, when receiver clients on PC work very smoothly. Any
feedback?

R?gis

Wisse -

You might have some kind of network problem that pops up up between you 
Citrix server and the network share used to store the shape files. Try 
to create a share locally on the Citrix server and  save the shape files 
to this share instead.

The problem could be some kind of file access conflict with several 
users reading the shape file at the same time as another user is trying 
to edit the same shape-file. Try to edit the shape-file at a time when 
you are sure no other user are accessing the file.

When you have a multi-user, perhaps multi-edit environment as yours my 
strong, general advise is to store the data in a database like 
postgresql/postgis. Any file based format like shape-files, tab-files or 
spatialite is not suitable for this kind of environment.

Otto -

The first question -

I you look at the information from "ogrinfo" in the first case it contains:

... DATUM["unknown", SPHEROID["unretrievable - using 
WGS84",6378137,298.257223563], ...

This is plainly wrong for EPSG:25833. It should be something with GRS80. 
You might have a bad installation of the GDAL utilities. And this error 
is probably triggering QGIS to ask for the projection.

For the next question: I haven't actually looked at the QGIS code for 
CRS lookups, but I'll make a guess:
QGIS do a search in the build-in projection database and find the 
epgs:3006 as the first candidate and doesn't look any further. You might 
have a look on this thread: 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2013-February/021233.html , 
which describes a somewhat similar situation

As a continuation of my first answer to question 2: You might simply 
delete the epgs:3006 definition from your QGIS srs.db database.
Its a sqlite database residing in directory ..\resources.
Open the database with a sqlite manager and in table "tbl_srs" delete 
the row with column "auth_id" = 3006. It's possible there exists other 
EPSG defintions with the same projection parameters as EPSG:25833, so 
you might have to repeat the deletion with another values for auth_id

(Actually, I don't know what will happen in QGIS afterwards, so be sure 
to make a copy of the file srs.db for security reasons beforehand ;-)

Hi,

I have two projects in qwc. When I try to swich one projects the bbox is

Hi

About regressions, I agree with the current guidelines. From the user's
perspective, regressions are extremely annoying. It is very frustrating to
be used to a tool that suddenly stops working in a new version. Depeding on
the severity of the regression, it can even discourage the adoption of a
new version.

Cheers

Of course, every bug is annoying, and discourage users. In an ideal
world we should fix them all before releasing, but we must realize that
we simply do not have the resources to do it, so we must find a
reasonable compromise.
IMHO if regressions affect only a minority of users, or there is a
reasonable workarou8nd, they should be mentioned in the release notes,
but should not block a release.
I think that shipping a new release with bugs we define as blockers is
not good.
All the best.

You need to add path to GRASS libs to LD_LIBRARY_PATH before you run
QGIS, for example

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/osgeo/grass64/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
qgis

obviously you can create an alias for QGIS + GRASS 6 and QGIS + GRASS 7 like:

alias qgis-grass6='LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/osgeo/grass64/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/your/path/to/qgis'
alias qgis-grass7='LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/osgeo/grass70/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/your/path/to/qgis'

Setting the path to GRASS 6 or 7 libs you select which version of the
provider/plugin will be loaded. Similarly there are two batch files in
OSGEO4W for QGIS + GRASS 6 and 7.

I'll send more detailed info about plugin upgrade progress after QGIS
2.9 freeze (tomorrow noon).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New geometry classes merged
Message-ID: <5562E121.7080909@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

Finally, the new geometry classes are merged to master branch (the new 
classes are under src/core/geometry). The changes contain only the core 
classes, not included are the changes in the rendering workflow and all 
the edit tools. They would be too risky for 2.10 and will be merged at a 
later time (most likely for 2.12).

At the moment, the compatibility class  QgsGeometry should hide the 
differences to the old geometry. In practice, there will be a number of 
unexpected problems after the merge. If you encounter one, fill a ticket 
in the tracker and assign it to me (or drop a note to the devel list). 
My apologies beforehand for the trouble caused.

There are a number of provider unit tests not passing at the moment 
(mostly because of wkt formating issues). I'll go through them in the 
next days.

Regards,
Marco

Imho we should strive to give our users a fair warning about all
regressions we are aware of. They should be listed* as prominently as the
new features in the visual change log*. To be able to do this, we need to
ensure that all regressions are marked accordingly in the bug tracker.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hello,

I've created a new processing algorithm to check geometry validity at 
the hackfest.
(It is a fTools feature which was missing in processing)

Here is the pull request: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2064

I'd like it to be merge before feature freeze.
I think everything is OK to merge, comments are welcome anyway.

I've just rebased it on last successfully tested commit from master to 
avoid conflicts.

Best regards.

Arnaud

What about setting this in  /etc/ld.so.conf.d/grass.conf  and running
ldconfig (as root)?  I have wrongly set there  /osgeo/grass64/lib
instead of  /osgeo/grass64/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib.

I can see the plugin for 64 now. However, trying to open a (new) Mapset,
returns  "The config file /osgeo/QGIS/grass/config/default.qgc) not
found.".  And the GRASS toolbar icons (as well as for other toolbars)
are (partially or completely) invisible.

So, it is wrong to provide both paths for 64 and 70 at the same
time in /etc/ld.so.conf[.d/somefile.conf].

That would disable the possibility to run with 6 or 7.

QGIS is installed in /osgeo/QGIS/ and
/osgeo/QGIS/grass/config/default.qgc exists?
The path is constructed as QgsApplication::pkgDataPath() +
"/grass/config/default.qgc".
For now, I think that you have to install QGIS to get it working (or
do some dirty trick like symlinks from /osgeo/QGIS/grass/).

Hi Arnoud,

if it's possibile, try to add the documentation of the algorithm
commiting in the QGIS-Documentation.

did you check that travisCI has failed compilation? check if it
related with geometry update by Marco or depends on your modification
(I don't think so)

regards
Luigi Pirelli

No worries, stick to your plan. I was just happy that the grass plugin
revealed itself now.

Eager to hear about all the hardwork you have been doing in your message
after the freeze and sorry for the spoiler ;-)

Some provider tests are temporarily broken after the geometry merge. 
Will be fixed in the next days.

Oops, I really was not aware of the upcoming news, though I do follow

FYI,

The pure C (+Java bindings) version of the transformation
methods in the QGIS georeferencer is now available here:

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/gvsigce/code/trunk/libraries/libCTL

I realize that this won't be of immediate interest for QGIS
folks, but I would nevertheless like to thank you all for
taking the time to answer my questions on this list.

If anyone here does find my C/Java conversion useful, then
I'd be thankful for any tests/comments.

Cheers,

Ben

Woohoo, thanks for the new toys Marco. Could you give me some high level notes that we can include in the visual change log? I got some key points from chatting to you but don?t want to leave out anything important.

Honestly, I am afraid to install.  I want to avoid hunting

I'll try to symlink.  Thank you, Nikos

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsServer refactoring update
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672iV=yATff1ZT3g17OchnQB18fweCOc_xcv3tC2u6pVQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

here is an update of my QGIS server refactoring and new python bindings.

The goals:

- complete python bindings for QGIS server, useful for standalone scripts
and for unit testing (writing tests in Python )
- server refactoring by wrapping all in a class

The work is not yet complete but we can now run the server from  python
with:

s = QgsServer()
response =
s.handleRequest('map=project.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&request=GetProjectSettings')

I've created a new class for the server:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/blob/qgisserver-func-wrapping/src/server/qgsserver.h
the main file is now just a couple of lines:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/blob/qgisserver-func-wrapping/src/server/qgis_map_serv.cpp
here is a first working test:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/blob/qgisserver-func-wrapping/tests/src/python/test_qgsserver.py


What is left:

- complete test building with/without python and with/without python
plugins (the two features are independent)
- I'm not satisfied by QgsServerContext, I'd probably drop it completely or
move some status-related vars to that class
- when compiling with python plugins, the server (obviously) segfaults when
(re)initialising python, I must add a flag to avoid python plugins
initialisation when the server is invoked from python

I don't know how much time it will take, there are not any big changes in
the pipeline and the whole new architecture seems fine to me, but testing
it all requires some time and I'm busy with other works these days, any
help or advice would be highly appreciated. I would also really like to run
valgrind and check for leaks and bottlenecks before merging.

I looked at the code and it's pretty simple. If some code are selected, 
the selection has run otherwise all the code has run.

Can others confirm?

Hi,

It seems like a recent master version
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b91e43a) crashes on exit. I installed through OSGEO4W.

Can others confirm?

Thanks,
Andreas

Do you know, was May 22 build still ok? And May 24 build broken?

If you are able to compile, can you test if reverting the following two
commits fixes it:
10239a0
dbdfe40

Hi,
I agree the changes are good,

I don't know if the double merge on PR 1999 could break something, but we
can just pick the right commit.

Hi Matthias,

Unfortunately I don't have a build environment on Windows.

My Linux system with the newest master build does not seem to be 
affected by this crash on exit.

I'll write these two commits in the bug report so the dev dealing with 
this could investigate whether these two patches are the cause.

See http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12822

Thanks,
Andreas

Oi oi , yes it crashes. (Done quite a long time already)
It was tried to solve last week without success. Tested in my laptop. It 
crashes even I start without plugins. And it crashes even if I don't 
open any project (start/close).

Cheers,
Kari

Why here and there? With CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX you install where you want.

Hi J?rgen,

I could not find the 7a629ad commit. Yet I have tried the current
master and I admit that after your previous commit 536135a it actually
works fine for most purposes.

The reopenings of every record of the dataset seems a minor issue for
the performance, since it only occurs when working with the Attribute
table. The performance is thus somewhat slower than it was by QGIS 1.8
but it is still OK to work with. Zooming and paning does not lead to
the reopenings of every record of every table (it only leads to each
table being opened and closed separately). Tables that were not
selected from the dataset are rightfully ignored now (thanks to your
commit).

I will rerun the tests on other platforms (I have tried only Windows),
yet I suppose that they will be identical and that we can live with this.

Many thanks,
Pavol

Sorry for the double merge. It comes after the work from Hugo.

This feature was on the changelog for 2.8, but the selected query couldn't
be loaded on the map canvas. We could only execute the selected part to see
the table in the sql window. That's why there is a backport.

Can you try with 95a7408 which was done today? It is an improved version
of the original fix which was reverted due to side-effects.

Because of past experiences with make uninstall not really doing what
it was supposed to do.

It works now though :-). Both installing and uninstalling.

> > I'll try to symlink.

Both, installing and symlinking work as far as doing away with the
reported error message and the GRASS(64) plugin is available (toolbar and
toolbox). Yet, most icons are invisible, the descriptions in the toolbox are
ok (I think, I didn't check all).


Re-exporting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for G7, however, does not do any magic.

But, I can wait for the upcoming announcments.

Thanks a million, Nikos

There is no GRASS 7 plugin yet, it is scheduled for QGIS 2.12. You
should find however GRASS 7 provider listed in Help > About >
Providers and you should see GRASS locations structure in the browser.

Has anyone set up TravisCI to test commits in a QGIS Python plugin Github
repo? Can anyone give me some help?

Hi Tom

For example InaSAFE uses Travis CI - the Travis config file from there may
be a good start:
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe

We use Travis CI for Crayfish plugin - though we test only crayfish
library, not the plugin itself, so QGIS libs are not required:
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-crayfish-plugin

There will be most likely various other plugins using it too...

Regards
Martin

Hi Matthias,

I have tried with the latest nightly build now, which includes the
commit you mentioned.

The attribute table is now opened immediately.

By zooming and paning I could not notice any difference in performance.
I have the impression that the same number of connections to the server
is opened, with the difference that there are not closed immediately,
but in exactly one minute.

Thanks Giuseppe for the merge.
In the third commit, I changed the new feature 'createView' from Hugo to
use the 'getSqlQuery'. But this commit hasn't been pushed. It would be nice
to use always this function, if someone wants to create a view with the
selected query.

Regards,
Etienne

Hi

I would like to thanks Lene and her team for the wonderful and perfect
organization (!!!impressive!!!)
For the next HF will be hard to do better :)
Thanks you also to the sponsors.

We already did personally there in Nodebo, but I feel that everyone
would know that this is the (or a) way to do collaborative meetings.

Many thanks to the QGIS staff and cooperators to produce so many
commits and quality control in so short time.

regards, Luigi Pirelli

Thanks very much, Martin. Looks like I have a lot to learn (unittest/nose, as
well as Travis itself).

121.               layer.dataProvider().changeAttributeValue(feature.id
(),nPosField,value)


There is some changed or can be a bug ?

Thank you
Marco

Hi all,
apparently the background map in the QGIS About is broken, and the zoom
not working, both on win and on deb, in 2.8 and in master.
Is this a known problem I missed?
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] editing in QGIS a WFST from QGIS server
Message-ID: <1432720772054-5207744.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I didn't find anything clear on the web. 
As anyone succeeded in editing WFST layer served by QGIS server? 
I configured a 2.10 Lizmap with qgis server 2.8, and Lizmap CAN do editing.
There are some caveats such as having a sequence in db's table as a primary
key. 
I couldn't edit the very same layer from QGIS desktop (2.8.2 and master). I
get a serviceExceptionReport error. 

Any idea, that would help us a lot here. 

Cheers
R?gis

Hi R?gis,

Lizmap does not use WFS-T because we do editing before WFS-T release.
I think that QGIS-Web-CLient can use it.

What is the serviceExceptionReport content ?

Hi,

No - QGIS Web Client does not support editing. There also currently no 
plans to support it any time soon. There are other things of higher 
priority.

I had to wait almost a minute to get the background map loaded. I think
their servers are being used heavily.

Hi,

At my system, the background map appears only after you click on a 
placemark. After clicking on any placemark, the background map appears 
immediately and navigation is working fine.

Maybe some sort of problem that Webkit does not correctly trigger parts 
of the script?

BTW: Matthias, I noticed in the map that you are still located at 
Winterthur ;-) ...

Hi Ren?-Luc, 
Then QGis client is probably buggy. Is there anyway to catch the exception
log from QGIS server? If not, I'll try to push a transaction in a browser. 
Cheers

Correction, most probably QGIS server is buggy because QGIS desktop has been
tested extensively on Geoserver and TinyOWS apparently. 
Cheers

Hi Marco

Are you sure that you are testing the same thing.
IIRC there are the following methods which can be easily mixed up:

layer.changeAttributeValue()

and

layer.provider().changeAttributeValues()

Best,
Matthias

Hi all,
I noticed that the measuring tool is not closed properly (it leaves the
polygon or line on the canvas) if done through the X (close window)
button, whereas it is when using the Close button.
This is annoying for the users: would you agree this is a (small) bug?
Thanks.

Hi all.

The project is funded! Thanks to everybody who contributed or promoted
the project.

The first two parts are implemented, you can follow the work progress here:

browser demo video:

Many thanks to Jef for the help with dual build port to Windows, which
saved me a lot of headache and for patient fixing of the bugs I
introduced on Windows.

You can now build QGIS with GRASS 6, 7 or both. For the GRASS 7, there
are three new cmake options: WITH_GRASS7, GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR7,
GRASS_PREFIX7. Libs and binaries for each version have GRASS major
version number appended to file names. You can choose the version of
provider/plugin on runtime setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the directory
where GRASS libs are installed. For example:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/apps/grass-6.4.4/lib /home/user/apps/bin/qgis

Similarly, there are bat files in OSGEO4W 32bit for each GRASS version
(GRASS 7 is not dependency and must be selected manually). There is no
GRASS 7 provider in OSGEO4W 64bit, because there is no GRASS 7 in
OSGEO4W 64bit yet.

Please test but be aware that there are still many issues, especially
on Windows which I hope to fix for QGIS 2.10 release.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Grouping insert/update when sending to PostGIS
Message-ID: <CAJvUf_uX-eF9ZnfQcOeD8cDbgp9AMNfjcoKqLvR6ivPxOgMFXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey dear list,

I recently stumbled upon a strange behaviour of QGIS.

With a simple point postgis layer.

When making several edit on the layer, then saving the edits.
All the edits are send one by one to the database (though in the same
transaction).

It would hold much benefits to group those insert/update per table before
sending it, and it may be easy to do.

A pure SQL solution :
instead of doing for instance :
---------------------
--adding stuff
INSERT INTO my_table (geom) VALUES ('POINT(1,2)');
INSERT INTO my_table (geom) VALUES ('POINT(3,4)');
--updating stuff
UPDATE my_table SET geom = 'POINT(5,6)' WHERE id = 1 ;
UPDATE my_table SET geom = 'POINT(7,8)' WHERE id = 2 ;
--deleting stuff
DELETE FROM my_table WHERE id = 3 ;
DELETE FROM my_table WHERE id = 4 ;
----------------------

We could do
----------------------
WITH inserting AS (
    INSERT INTO my_table (geom) VALUES ('POINT(1,2)')
)
,to_update AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, 'POINT(5,6)' AS geom
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 , 'POINT(7,8)'
)
, updating AS (
    UPDATE my_table SET geom = t_o.geom
    FROM update AS t_o
    WHERE my_table.id = t_o.id
    RETURNING 1
)
, deleting AS (
    DELETE FROM my_table
    WHERE id = ANY (ARRAY[3,4])
    RETURNING 1
)
SELECT 1
FROM deleting ;
--------------------


Speed may benefit from it, but much more important, all the action would be
in one statement, which would permit to use STATEMENT TRIGGER in postgis
database.

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Referencing QgsComposerAttributeTable from a Print
 Composer Template
Message-ID: <1432811306970-5207995.post@n6.nabble.com>

When referencing a QgsComposerAttributeTable from a Print Composer template
like this:

composerView = composerList[0]
composition = composerView.composition()
attrtable = composition.getComposerItemById('MyComposerAttributeTable') 

I get a <class 'qgis._core.QgsComposerFrame'> returned in attrtable object.
I would expect a QgsComposerAttributeTable?

Need to set a filter on the attribute table in the print composer. 

Since the composer is large with a lot of items, I have made the template in
the print composer and getting the items with
getComposerItemById('MyItemId'). If I build the composer from scratch in
Python, I can of course use the QgsComposerAttributeTable, but is not an
option here.

Call multiFrame() on the frame to get a reference to its parent
attribute table. Tables can be split over multiple frames, so each
item is it's own frame. The attribute table is the parent multiframe
which controls what is displayed in each individual frame.

Thanks for the documentation. It's working:

attrtable =
composition.getComposerItemById('MyComposerAttributeTable').multiFrame() 

returns a QgsComposerAttributeTable

Message-ID: <e361a1f62299463fb44dae25cf016d53@Exchange1.fugro.de>

Dear list,

QGIS crashes when discarding all changes, made in editing mode on a temporary vector layer. I'm writing a plugin to access and modify the attribute table while the layer is in editing mode. When starting the editing mode, I change the attribute values for each new feature with the coordinates from canvas and other given information. When the editing mode stops without saving anything, QGIS crashes giving me a hint with a dump file. The error message is attached (sorry, that it is in german).

Cheers

Hi Christian,

Can you give some details about which version of QGIS you are using and
possibly try to find a minimal python script to reproduce this behavior?

Thank you

That's because of the provider interface.  For vector data providers
addFeatures, deleteFeatures, changeAttributeValues and changeGeometryValues are
independant operations - which therefore are also done in separate
transactions.

Hey J?rgen,
this doesn't explain why each operations isn't grouped.


For instance all the addFeatures are grouped into one transaction, but not
into one statement.

In InaSAFE we actually use Jenkins with Github PR Builder plugin now for
our reference. We had some problems with Travis: There were some tests that
could take more than 10 mins and all the tests could take > 50 mins and
would hit job timeout in travis for public repo. Also sometimes the job
failed to start.

But thanks for mentioning InaSAFE, I think now I can make Travis work again
as we reworked some tests to just use dummy data and it only takes around
24mins now that I see its Travis page.

Hi,

The new icons for the Layers and Browser docks look good, but now the
sizing and spacing looks awkward when compared to the main toolbars (see 0,
1 screen snaps), especially on Mac. What's the likelihood that we can
switch those over from QToolButtons to a actions on a QToolBar instead for
the upcoming release? These docks would then look similar to the Console's
QToolBar (see either screen snap).

There's some discussion on the pull request regarding this, see:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2071#issuecomment-106283486

The plan is to drop the icon/button sizes down a level (should then match
the previous appearance).

Larry,

As Nyall mentioned, icon size of the dock tool button will go back to 16 x
16 by default. That'll make things look the same as before.

That said, the border on the buttons (no present on other OSes) aren't very
nice. It might be worth adding a style specifically for os x to remove
those.

Hi,

I also am involved with some work that can benefit from WPS integration of
Processing, and found Ren?-Luc's new plugin while searching today.

What would help further in my situation is to be able to export the
Processing model into a format that can be loaded as a backend process in
another WPS setup, e.g. GeoServer with WPS, but configured via QGIS.
Ren?-Luc, any thoughts on that?

Is there a standardized definition for WPS that describing input/outputs
that a Processing model can be exported into (assuming all dependencies
would be the same on the remote server executing the process)? I looked in
the spec and noticed the WPS Native Process Model [0]. Any experience with
that?

Hi Larry,

Maybe the WPS-GRASS-bridge:

could give some inspiration!?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-master: libpng warning & error,
	invisible icons
Message-ID: <20150529075933.GA29861@tpx1c2g>


Dear QGIS developers,

I am running the latest qgis-master, build from scratch under
Funtoo-Linux. I would like to have the stable version but I can't get it
built.  qgis-master compiles without errors so I am happy working with and
testing it.


Upon launching from the terminal, the following warning & error(s) appears
repeatedly:

    Running from build directory!
    - source directory: /osgeo/QGIS
    - output directory of the build: /osgeo/QGIS/build-master/output
    Warning: loading of qgis translation failed [/osgeo/QGIS/build-master/output/i18n/qgis_en_US]
    Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
    libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.17
    libpng warning: Application  is  running with png.c from libpng-1.2.50
    libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library
    ...


Perhaps there is some package using this older libpng version (?), otherwise, there
is no trace of this version installed.


GRASS64 support works too (plugin is present, toolbar and toolbox too). One
problem is the many icons are invisible (for the GRASS toolbar none of the
icons appears actually). In order to get the GRASS plugin working, I have the
following symbolic link 

/osgeo/QGIS/grass/config/default.qgc ->
/osgeo/QGIS/src/plugins/grass/modules/default.qgc

and launch qgis from /osgeo/QGIS/build-master/output/bin/qgis


Running from /usr/local/bin/qgis (after make install), doesn't reveal
the GRASS plugin.

Thanks for any hints in getting this clean, Nikos

Please consider HiDPI screens when planning icon sizes, at least they
should be configurable, there is still a settings option for icon sizes.

At the HF we discussed about the different options, one is to add options
like

very small
small
normal
big
huge

instead of the px size, this should scale nicely converting sizes to actual
pixels according to DPI.

I'd say the related changes committed within the last 72 hours helped a lot
in that regard. For one, the icon refresh moved away from 16 x 16 png icons
to SVG graphics. In addition, the icon size for dock tool buttons are now
taking into account the user preferred icon size.

Having more SVG icons helps a lot to make the interface look good
(despite the fact that some graphics designer may object that there's no
hinting)

For reference, this code is used in QField to calculate button sizes and
may as well be used to calculate the default icon size device independently:

Message-ID: <CAJvUf_twv1RLOQTssBKT5tVR8N_=Z080DkURPW7ENn1m_DicaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,
we have a problem with our plugin
<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/interactive_map_tracking-master>,
QGIS gives a wrong error message at first install.

Apparently this is due to the fact that our plugin is in a folder called
'interactive_map_tracking-master'
and the plugin name is 'interactive_map_tracking'

I tried to update the plugin by sending a new zip containing the correct
folder name, but it is blocked by the site
"Plugin name mismatch: the plugin main folder name in the compressed file
(interactive_map_tracking) is different from the original plugin package
name (interactive_map_tracking-master)."

I don't see any contact form on the plugin web site,
could somebody un-stuck us please?

Thanks,
R?mi-C

Hi,

The only option I see is to delete the plugin that was created with a wrong
package name and create a new one with the right package name.

Plugin name and folder name must match.

Hey, thanks for the super-quick answer.

Can't we just change the plugin database for this plugin?
Surely there is a way to do it manually !
Or simply change the folder name on the server?
Deleting the plugin make it loose all the history, which I find quit bad.

Also, if the consequences are so dire, wouldn't is be necessary to check at
import that plugin name and folder name match?

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Yes, but it's not trivial.

Sorry for the quick (and wrong) answer :)

I checked the exact constraint:  the package name (the name of the fist
folder in the zip file) is independent from the plugins name and cannot be
changed (while the plugin name, visible to the user, can change) the
package name is a unique key used internally to build the URLs and to
retrieve plugin packages and is kept unique to make sure that there are no
plugins with the same package name.

The problem here is that it cannot be easily changed without breaking a lot
of things.

You can just stick with the old package/folder name, it will be just
visible in the URLs.

I'm afraid I can't,
currently it creates a bug !
When installing from QGIS plugin repository,
it gives an error message.
This error message would be because the plugin name and folder name are
different.
So one way or another, the folder name has to be changed to match the
plugin name !

So you see we don't have much choice here...
Cheers,

Hi Matthias,

I'm not understanding that referenced calculation. The fixed number you
multiply the dpi against is platform-specific, yes?

I would be interested in a Qt4-based black box function to manage this
high-rez scaling.

For reference, though a bit dated:
http://blog.qt.io/blog/2013/04/25/retina-display-support-for-mac-os-ios-and-x11/

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Report 1 - Multithread support on QGIS Processing
	toolbox
Message-ID: <20E9AA9A-9058-4730-B265-79637A0D69BE@me.com>

What do I have completed this week?

New implementation of the AlgorithmExecutor subclassing QObject. 
Mechanism to deal with crashing Algorithms: when there is an exception during the algorithm execution, a signal is emitted in order to allow the main thread to make the other thread quit.
Use signal to connect the algorithm progress signal to the setPercentage slot in the ProgressBar
In the runAlgorithm method of the Processing class I changed the code associated with the runalg in order to support multithreading. Each time that an algorithm is running through the QGIS python console, a new thread and a new instance of the algorithm executor are created. The signals of the AlgorithmExecutor are connected to the thread signal in order to quit the thread and run the algorithm when the thread starts. While the algorithm is running, the main thread waits for the algorithm to finish and then proceed to show the output (first approach).

What am I going to achieve for the next week?

Create a non-blocking version of the processing in order to make the interface not wait for the algorithm to finish.
Solve the crash when starting the new thread.

Is there any blocking issue?

QGIS seems to crash randomly when starting the new thread and, when it doesn?t crash, the output of the algorithm is None, which may indicate that the algorithm is crashing in the new thread.

Inside the GDAL version I use, I have found the following README file:

--%<---
*** IMPORTANT ***
Updating libpng in GDAL tree should follow update of zlib library in
frmts/zlib.
*****************

libpng 1.2.50 is the official PNG reference library.
It supports almost all PNG features, is extensible,
and has been extensively tested for over 15 years.

GDAL changes (stored in libpng_gdal.patch)
--->%--

So, should I rather use the old libpng library for QGIS too?

Thanks, Nikos

Hi Larry,

Actually I haven't written these lines, they come from the GSoC 2012
work by Ram?n Carillo on QGIS for Android.

I think the fixed number there relates to the "/ 160" from the following
page which takes a 160 dpi screen as reference [1] while our code uses a
130 dpi screen as reference.

Anyway, multiplying a size with dp afterwards gives a number of pixels
which is larger on denser displays.

Thinking about it now, we should probably try to be compatible with the
value returned by the corresponding Qt5 method. [2]

Best,
Matthias

Can you test https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2095 and let me know if
that's better?

This pull request flips the browser dock over to a toolbar, so I'm
after feedback from anyone as to whether this change is an
improvement, and if so, I'll make it happen across all dock widgets.

Message-ID: <3178016.vuyiABkY0k@debian>

Strictly speaking, there are two separate problems:

One is the name mismatch, what makes QGIS thinking that the zip available in 
the repo ("interactive_map_tracking") and the installed plugin 
("interactive_map_tracking-master") are two separate plugins. As a result, 
QGIS won't inform the user about available updates.

Second problem is bigger: the directory is just a Python module, and it 
crashes Python, because module names can't contain dashes. It's a Python 
syntax restriction, not QGIS. And, as Alessandro said, this is the plugin key, 
not the zip file name (what is basically much less important) so changing it 
would be quite complicated.

Hopefully removing the plugin and creating again will be straightforward.

Best Regards,

Borys

Hi,

If you confirm, I can open a ticket:
QGIS crashes ungracefully when a python expression script contains an error.

I think there should be a warning but the crashes should be avoided.

Crash log from my OSGeo4W install is here:

Hi R?gis,

Did you directly test WFS-T in QGIS-Server ?

I tested WFS-T in QGIS-Server 2.8 with QGIS 2.8 and WFS-T in Lizmap with 
QGIS 2.8. They worked well.

But I firstly have some ServiceExceptionReport because my Spatialite 
database was in a not modified directory. After changed the owner and 
right of the directory I didn't have trouble.

Yes, I can confirm the crash on linux as well, so you can file a ticket, thanks.
I am going to issue a pull request for that.

Hi Anita,

It's not backwards compatible, but that's why you get a warning when saving
an old project in a newer version of QGIS. We don't support backwards
compatibility of projects.

?Hi Nyall,

I understand that we don't guaranty backwards compatibility. If it's
impossible to fix, that's fine with me. I was just wondering if the break
happened by accident or if it had to be done. I expect this issue will come
up when LTR users and non-LTR users try to exchange projects.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

HI, 
we are sponsoring Vincent Mora on that and I submitted the issue on Friday.
He should be able to work on that in the next few days.
