The README in the package is empty, and there's no license

In principle this is not a big issue: packages can be added to osgeo4w
(I assume you're talking about Windows, because in Linux installing it
should be straightforward). It's just a matter of resources: you could
either learn how to do it, or support the excellent work by Juergen.
This may benefit others.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding blending modes for labels,
	to have 'transparenting' labels?
Message-ID: <740c37c0-99f2-3365-7312-a129511b7b61@duif.net>

Hi All,

I've been contacted by a cartophil (no offence Jan ;-)), which sent me
the two attached images, and asked me if the labelbuffers you see there
could be done with QGIS...

To precize:

If you look in lblbuf1.png [0] (Dutch kadastral 1:10000 map) it looks
like the label 'Arnhemse Broek' is normally buffered on first side. But
better looking into it, it looks like it is ONLY ('transparently')
buffered the complement(?) color of the buffer.
So: text = black, so there is only a complement(?) of black == white
buffer, IF the buffer(!) is covering a pixel which has the same color as
the text (black in this case).
For example: looking at the top of the A in 'Arnhemse Broek' you see
that red is actually NOT having a buffer, but the little black casing of
the red, DOES have a buffer..

In lblbuf2.png (swiss topo map) if you look at the height-line/contour
labels, you see exactly the same: there is a buffer, but only if it is
over a line with the same color...

Tried some label settings in QGIS with lblbuf3.png as nearest result...
Taking blue as labeltext, yellow (complement) as buffer color, and
Addition as blending.

But as you see there the blending takes ALL colors into account, so you
have a slight buffering everywhere, and yellow artifacts in the red
pixels....

So diving into the code:

Blending mode is here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgspallabeling.cpp#L1009

Going to renderer:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgspainting.cpp#L6

Going to pretty low level qpainter behaviour:

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpainter.html#setCompositionMode

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpainter.html#CompositionMode-enum

It looks like there are even more modes then are available in the
Blending dropdown in QGIS.

I'm not so much into color theories, but is it possible that the use
case above is one of the composition modes which just is not in QGIS
blending mode dropdown yet?

And if so: which one do you think? I can try to add it myself.

OR is the usecase a custom blending mode (we are wondering then how the
dutch cadastre and the swiss topo are doing this... because it is NOT
part of esri apparently too....).

Thanks for any pointers.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

It's not a blending mode - it's a technique called "variable depth
buffers" or "smart halos".

- ArcGIS offers it, but requires precreation of a raster layer (see
https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2011/11/28/variable-depth-masking-contour-label-example/).
- It can be done in Mapnik - see http://mapnik.org/news/smart-halos

Hugo has been looking into this for QGIS - see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/63

Yep, that is exactly where we are talking about (looking at the
pictures)....

Though the Mapnik example is different: these have buffer/halo's on
every color.

I think the subtle difference is, is that it is NOT a clipping of the
whole 'buffer' because as you see in the examples: other colors then the
color of the label text are NOT clipped. To me this looks like some
special kind of blending using the text color over the background...

Mmm, I was hoping it was one of the QPainter tricks we were missing... :-(

Thanks for looking into this...

Regards,

Richard

mmm, it is working for me

this works fine

##layer=vector
##fields=multiple field layer

print fields


Notice that it is "multiple field", all in lower case. You example
says "multiple Field", which is wrong. Maybe is that?

Hi Victor,

again, thanks for the support.

I still have troubles.. always the same error (actually lower or
uppercase is the same)..

I'm talking of R scripts, not python ones.. are there differences?

Thanks again

ah, ok, that might be it

can you check the temporary R file that is created when running the
algorithm? that should tell you how the parameter is pased to R, since
that is an R script

You should find it in ~/.qgis2/processing

Matteo,

I did try it, but the plots do not display for me in the webview. From the
logs I was able to see where it was saving the file and was able to display
it in the web browser.

Paolo,

Sorry for a repeat but I forgot to do a reply all to include qgis-developer.

I have no problem installing plotly. For me it is straight forward. My
concern is will QGIS then be shipped with plotly or can plotly be combined
with the plugin itself. My concern is for the end user. For many installing
an extra package in order to run a plugin would simply mean it doesn't get
used. I like the work that Matteo and colleagues have done but because it
is based on plotly, then plotly needs to be a part of the QGIS distribution
or be distributed as a part of the plugin if we are going to take that
approach.

I would be interested in helping out their efforts because it matches some
of the analysis needs that I am trying to solve. Based on my concerns can
you tell me whether we can use plotly or do we need to use a different D3
library? Are their any licensing problems in using it? If there are no
problems with it then I will start digging into it and reading through the
DataPlot code.

What do you mean by the work of Juergen?

Thanks.

Calvin,

Did you consider that if the library is pure Python (no binaries) and there
are no licensing issues, it can be easily packaged and shipped within the
plugin?

This approach is currently used by many plugins (GeoServer explorer is one
of those).

Yes! It renders very quickly after I set the read-only flag in the file
explorer.
That goes a long way towards solving the problem for me because as I
mentioned, the team would like to use this format to store geodata, not to
edit it and certainly not to make edits by multiple concurrent users.
Thank you so much for your help!

Hello there
Is some "oficial procedure! how to treat nonrelational fields in some
formats (i mean tree structured, nested values like json, python dict, in
postgre hstore, or composite types and bson, or, for example data from
mongo, or XML, btw). Is another option, or is not any option that save it
as string?

Dear colleagues,


I have extended plugin qgis2web with capability to work with time axis. You can find sample output and plugin at http://gis.vsb.cz/ruzicka/time/<http://gisak.vsb.cz/ruzicka/time/>


I tried to publish it in plugin repository, but Paolo Cavallini suggested to merge it with original qgis2web plugin. I think that this is a good idea, but I have no experience with such process and I am not user if my code is nice enough to be added to qgis2web plugin.


It would be nice if you consider the plugin and in a case that you will find it useful, you will help me to add my contribution to qgis2web plugin.


Best regards


Jan Ruzicka

Hi Even, 

Thank you for sharing this finding! 

In that case I think that QGIS should offer a flag to open Geopackages
in read-only mode. 

Even - since you are "Mr. Geopackage" in the QGIS project anyway - can
you please make sure that this can be covered in the upcoming Geopackage
improvements? Would a "read-only" mode also be useful for other data
formats? I opened a ticket at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15652 and
assigned it to you. I have no idea how much effort this enhancement
would mean - can you please do an estimate and send me a quote for that?
Maybe we could still include it in the upcoming Geopackage improvements
financed by the Swiss QGIS user group. 

------------------- 

This also leads to a follow up question: many OGR data formats have
"open options". As far as I know, these options are not exposed to the
User in QGIS, other than the encoding - or did I miss something? Should
we introduce a "GUI" way in QGIS 3.x to expose these "open options" in
the "add vector layer" dialogue? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Jan

I think I saw this work when you linked to it from a PDF - a dissertation or
thesis. Nice!

Adding your work back into qgis2web could be terrific. Probably if you
contact me via Github (https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/) it would be
best.

The only thing I would say is that I am in the middle of implementing
Leaflet 1.0.0 in qgis2web, and there is also all the work for QGIS3 to do.
All I'm saying is, please be patient.

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQgsServerWFST disabled on Travis
Message-ID: <332c8cd8-16ed-33f4-c4a8-7279d877af97@opengis.ch>

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the PyQgsServerWFST has been disabled on the Travis builds.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

If you're interested in seeing these tests continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here are some examples of typical random failures these
tests encounter:

Calvin,

that's pretty strange.. Obviously it is super alpha version, but it
works for me..

which OS do you have? Did you install plotly package via pip?

Thanks for the feedbacks

Matteo

There's the "read only" setting (hidden away) under Project Properties
-> Identify Layers which this could potentially hook into.

Hi Matthias,

Is there any way to see the complete build logs for that particular build?

I'm trying with dash but the interesting part was apparently cut.

The rest of the test output was removed since it exceeds the threshold
of 307200 bytes.

If you make the very first output from the test a 'CTEST_FULL_OUTPUT'
line, then the truncation doesn't occur.

test_qgsserver_accesscontrol.py uses this, have a look how it's done there.

Hi Calvin,

I had some time to deepen in the list of D3 libraries you have listen:


>    1. *d3pie* (http://d3pie.org/) - This is a very attractive pie chart and
>    I like it, but it has only 7 contributors on GitHub and seems to be
>    stagnant.

if I understand it well, this allows just the pie plottin

>    2. *D3Plus* (http://d3plus.org/) - Has a number of reusable components -
>    19 contributors on GitHub.

seems very very good.. do you need to understand some external
component? I did not (but maybe I have them already installed) and I was
able to save a custom html interactive plot

>    3. *NVD3* (http://nvd3.org/) - Lots of reusable components - 200
>    contributors on GitHub.

I like it too..

>    4. *C3* (http://c3js.org/) - Also a number of components - 88
>    contributors, but there haven't been any updates for over a year.

seems less customizable than the others..


IMHO what I plot plugin like that one we are trying to understand how to
build should have some mandatory capabilities:

1. callback from plot to QGIS map canvas. So clicking on the
point/bar/boxplot should give a signal that can be used to
select/zooming/whatever in QGIS

2. plots should be callable from Processing

3. it could be really good to be able to embed plots in the print
composer too


I don't know if all these is possible, but maybe it is worth to try

Cheers

Matteo

<probably_ignore_this_and_skip_to_last_paragraph>
I'm not sure we need an explicit flag for read-only mode (in the GUI I mean). 
This could bring some complications: for example should that be saved with the 
layer in a project file? But if so, then you'd be stuck to read-only later if 
you want to edit a layer, etc.

Read-only mode could be the default mode for opening, and re-open in read-
write mode when this is needed. This is something I've done recently, but 
limited to MapInfo .tab, since opening .tab files in read-write mode prevented 
concurrent opening of the file in QGIS & MapInfo. I didn't want to mess with 
other formats, but fundamentally I don't see any reason why this couldn't be 
generalized to other formats (I'm not sure why QGIS has historically opened in 
read-write mode as first try. Probably because this was easier to implement)

For GPKG, there's just one subtelty though. I've fixed recently #15351 and to 
avoid deadlocks between readers&writers, the first to open a GPKG needs to turn 
on write ahead log (WAL) journalisation, so the workflow would be :

- open in read only
- check if journalisation is WAL
   - if so, done
   - if not, re-open in read-write, turn on WAL, re-open in read-only

And similar on closing to revert to the default DELETE journalisation mode.
</probably_ignore_this_and_skip_to_last_paragraph>

Hum, with further thinking, I don't undertstand why my suggestion in the 
discussion thread on the geopackage ML of changing the file permission to read-
only made things faster. Because, for feature iterators, QGIS uses a dedicated 
OGR connection in read-only mode and does not use the provider connection that 
might be in read-write mode. Unless the reporter still uses GDAL 1.11, which 
used to open in read-write mode regardless of what the user specified (was fixed 
in GDAL 2.0). That must be it. I'll check back with the reporter. So probably 
all the above is not needed after all...

Open options cannot be specified through QGIS currently indeed. There are not 
so many vector drivers that expose them, mostly those who are of the database 
type (with some redundancy with the way configuring the connection is already 
offered in the GUI). Some notable exceptions in the regular file category are 
CSV and GML.
One downside of open options is that they can be rather esoteric and hard to 
understand for the average user, so I guess they should be presented in a 
expandable tab.

GDAL offers the possibility to auto-discover which open options are available 
for a format, but that doesn't solve the issue with internationalization in 
QGIS. Although I think I discussed with someone about this and one possibility 
mentionned was to dump, at QGIS build time, the strings to translate from GDAL 
in a QGIS resource file. I didn't look how internationalization worked in QGIS.

Thanks! I will do it.

BTW, restarting the build https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/164559513,
the WFS-T test now passes but there is another one that fails:
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/164559513

PyQgsComposerPicture ....................***Timeout  60.00 sec

Should we disable that one too?

It's already disabled, the regex for blacklisting was broken and it was
executed by mistake.

Didn't know that one! I see this is done through the 
QgsVectorLayer::setReadOnly( bool readonly )" interface. So in case we would 
need that at the provider level (which is not so confirmed in this case) we 
could plug that there.

Side note: on a quick try there's some oddity in the GUI. If I just change a 
layer to Read-Only the "Toggle editing" button is still enabled. It becomes 
disabled only after I choose the "Select features by id" mode and clicked on a 
feature. And symetrically when changing back to Read-Write.

Hi,

unfortunately for now translation of strings which come from description
files is not supported. We still need to find a way how to do it. BTW this
affects not only SAGA, but also all other algs which generated from
description files e.g. GRASS, TauDEM, OTB

hi matteo,

1 and 2 are not hard to obtain
3 depend on what would be the canvas integration, a graph as html
annotation? would it be a canvas Item?

Hello,

Back to holidays and after the time needed to read all my waiting email :) I 
am here again.

I would like to thanks Otto also. He did a lot of good jobs on documentation 
and was a great help when I started to contribute. I remember that you tell me 
that I have the skills to contribute during my first QGIS hackfest. Even if I 
started from the most part of my contribution to work on the translation, I am 
now working on the documentation.

This is something I learned working with such a great community: help people 
to contribute, and wait. At one moment, they will contribute more and more. it 
can be sum up with "Plant a seed. Be patient.".

Thanks you Otto :) and the PSC!

Y.

A question has been asked relating to the use of gis.stackexchange.com as a

http://meta.gis.stackexchange.com/questions/4346/when-and-how-should-we-are-not-a-gis-software-support-site-be-invoked?cb=1

I think it might be worth a PSC member having a look and replying.

Thanks

​I​'ve seen the thread. I think the answer
http://meta.gis.stackexchange.com/a/4350/187 already sums it up quite
nicely.
​If the community thinks it's worthwhile and there is something
QGIS-specific to add, I can write another answer.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I cannot see any other reason for the random failures than the "sleep(x)"
that the test waited for the server to accept connections.

I've changed the check to a more robust wait-until-ready-or-timeout
function, this should eliminate those odd sparse failures.


Please let me know if you still have problems with these tests.

Hi Gino,

thanks for the answer..

> 1 and 2 are not hard to obtain

yep I'm aware that it is not hard (it is for me ;) but this is another
issue)

> 3 depend on what would be the canvas integration, a graph as html
> annotation? would it be a canvas Item?

I don't know I was just thinking about that.. I mean IMHO it is a pity
to have an engine in D3 that can create interactive plots and not be
able to use them in the map composer..
the way to do that, really don't know what can be the best way


Cheers

Matteo

I'm sure this has been mentioned before... When changing Symbol layer type to
"SVG marker", QGIS hangs for an excessive amount of time - around 34 seconds
when I tested just now. I presume a scan of directories for SVGs is taking
place, but the delay is really too long. What can be done?

do you also have symbol folder repetition in the list of the svg?

Message-ID: <CABgOYCe3XmwRXanxy7vDRMpzFhSAychH6iNZboJJALhxPXQ4pg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I encouter troubles compiling QGIS 2.14.7 branch on ubuntu xenial.

Master 2 and release 2.16 are just fine.

Here is the error at make stage :

-----------------------------------------
[ 78%] Generating* ui_frmReProject.py*
An unexpected error occurred.
Check that you are using the latest version of PyQt and send an error
report to

  * the UI file that caused this error
  * the debug output of pyuic4 (use the -d flag when calling pyuic4)

----------------------------------------------

I couldn't find python/plugins/fTools/tools/ui_frmReProject.py in source.

Is that normal? Is it related to ftools being suppressed in 2.16 branch
(bad commit).
I suppose I miss something since 2.14.7 is being compiled on osgeo4w..

Thanks for your lights.

Matteo means in:

Menu: 'Settings/Options'
Tab 'System'
Item 'SVG paths'

in my case too after some days my path's are proliferating there:

At this moment I have 25(!) times this:

/home/richard/apps/qgis/master/debug/share/qgis/svg/
/home/richard/.qgis2//svg/

Really not sure how I pick up those, even if I remove ALL after some
days I'm infected again :-)

Richard

I'm looking into this, going to try to get the loader to operate in a
background thread.

Sorry, you may not know that the main man behind the scene in OSGeo4W is
Juergen Fischer, who added many packages, including many Python
libaries, to it. Helping him to add (better: learning how to add it
yourself) what you need it would be the best way to go IMHO.
All the best.

This is on a windows 7 laptop using the OSGeo4W 64-bit network installer. I
currently am using the latest QGIS 2.16.3 64-bit. From the OSGeo4W Setup I
installed python-pip. From the shell I then did 'pip install plotly'.
During the install I got errors and doing a Google search it appears that I
needed to also do a pip install setuptools which I then installed.
Everything comes up but does not display the plot. By looking at the python
console it indicates where the temporary file was stored. If I launch it in
the web browser then the plot is displayed. I tried various version of QGIS
on windows all with the same results.

 I tried it using the VirtualBox OSGeoLive image using LUbuntu and
installed plotly there. In this case it worked so there is something wrong
with windows.

One other thing for windows in the file PlotDialog.ui where it has the
following:

 <customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsColorButtonV2</class>
   <extends>QToolButton</extends>
   <header>qgscolorbuttonv2.h</header>
   <container>1</container>
  </customwidget>
 . . .

Every time you see <header>...h</header> it needs to be changed to
<header>qgis.gui</header>

I don't know what is wrong with this running on windows. I am excited about
this plugin and it has great potential. Here are several observations that
I have.

1. It must work without having the user add extra libraries so it has to be
self contained.
2. I realize this is very preliminary work, but right now you have the
ability to add expressions and I tried using the $id to get the row number
and use it as the X axis and it does not work. It generates a python error.
It appears you have not implemented expressions.
3. Good date and time support is important.
4. It would be wonderful if you could get aggregate types of functions
working such as what I am doing with my circular heat map. I am not sure
what the complexity of that would be in the 2D formats. In my case I am
counting the number of incidents across two variables of date and time to
create a heatmap.
5. Do you have plans for this to do frequency plots?
6. You are displaying this in a QGIS windows, but it would also be nice to
allow the user to export it to a file for posting the interactive plot on
the Internet.
7. If it would ever work such that it could be rendered in the print
composer that would be awesome.
8. Some charts need different labels for the parameters for example I don't
know what it means for a pie chart to have x and y axis. For pie chars you
have a label and a value.

All the best!!!

Thanks as ever, Paulo. 

This version is my first attempt to move to Leaflet 1.0.0. If anyone can
spare some time to test, I'd be very grateful. Issues on Github. 

Thanks again

Hi Tom,

Great work. I had a quick test, and it works great. Only one general 
issue is that it always shows all fields in the popup, even those I mark 
as not visible. This affects both maps exported as leaflet and openlayer 
maps.

Cheers,

Paulo (another one :-)

yep.. we just tried it on 2 Ubuntu and Debian machines.. so no surprise
that on Windows it doesn't work.. more test needed :)

first time I hear of such an error.. UI have been created with Qt
Designer so they should be cross pltamform

agreed.. when I found that plotly went open source with python API I
just tried to build a plugin.. it worked and I kept going on.. Anyway I
also think that external libraries could be an obstacle..

that is.. we can make some code refactoring using on of the libraries
you listed in the previous email.. I liked http://d3plus.org/

in the first code trial expression were supported, so just a matter of
time ;)

mmm.. never deal with aggregates functions.. but I'm sure we will find a way

if you consider density plot a valid replacement for frequency ones, yes :)

this was also work in progress.. in the first version, when you created

that also should not be a problem.. Micheal designed the code in a easy
way so that when you change the plot the parameters will be updated
according to the plot needs..


Well.. I think the first thing we have to do is to choose the provider
for the code.. if plotly, d3plus or whatever.. else we will spend a lot
of effort writing code that maybe we won't consider suitable in the
future..


Thanks Calvin for the feedback ;)

	master 2
Message-ID: <ae51b9c020918accaa51900dd6e48883@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have a couple of questions around the new "Tileserver" layer support
in QGIS desktop to be released with 2.18. I think the main commit is
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f5b657db19eda7e72e6ed34eb7fe333c156acad0
- right? 

First, let me thank you a lot for this -  Martin and Lutra Consulting
for developing/sponsoring it! 

----------------- 

However, I wonder if the usability of the newly added tilserver is
already good enough? Or at least I think it is not really obvious how to
use it. 

1. How can add a new connection to a tile server? Is the browser the
only way? If yes, I hope that an additional entry to Layer --> Add Layer
menu could be added - all other layer types can be added this way. 

2. What is a correct URL? This is really hard to find out. F.e. I went
to http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers and tried to copy
some URLs and failed about finding the correct syntax. I added the layer
to the project --> nothing happened. No display, no error message. Maybe
because the projections do not match? - or would QGIS reproject on the
fly? 

3. Can we add some popular tile map server URLs by default - similar to
the QuickMapServices plugin? 

4. How can one edit an existing tile server connection - e.b. change
title or URL? Currently, one can only delete and re-add it. 

----------------- 

Thank you for your reply, 

Andreas

Hi Paolo

Try changing the unwanted fields' edit widgets to 'Hidden' in QGIS. Does
that work? 

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ZkNrbYe67GA+__8pKb4J3ybA0p+zwyS4jspc=uGybTKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have an issue with Python on Fedora.

After installing from a new clean clone and fresh build dir, if I do

 PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/qgis/python python -m qgis.PyQt.uic.pyuic

I get

/usr/bin/python: libqgis_core.so.2.17.0: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory

Although the lib is indeed in /usr/lib.

Also, if I run qgis from the build output and do
>From qgis.PyQt.uic import pyuic it crashes without any backtrace.

I don't know what to look for.
There are some issues on the hub, but I cannot find the connection with
this one.

If anyone has a hint, thanks a lot.

Denis

So I found out that http://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png seems
to work. 

However, if I add this OSM layer to my Swiss QGIS project (EPSG:21781) -
the swiss data seems to appear in the atlantic, west of "Guinea

Hi Andreas,

 

It works fine with my layers and the OTF on.

 

Including some default services would be great, but unfortunately there are some restrictions in using the service. 

 

See the original discussions here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3473

 

Cheers

Saber

So I found out that http://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png <http://tile.openstreetmap.org/%7bz%7d/%7bx%7d/%7by%7d.png>  seems to work.

However, if I add this OSM layer to my Swiss QGIS project (EPSG:21781) - the swiss data seems to appear in the atlantic, west of "Guinea Ecuatorial" ;-(

Hi,

I have a couple of questions around the new "Tileserver" layer support in QGIS desktop to be released with 2.18. I think the main commit is https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f5b657db19eda7e72e6ed34eb7fe333c156acad0 - right?

First, let me thank you a lot for this -  Martin and Lutra Consulting for developing/sponsoring it!

-----------------

However, I wonder if the usability of the newly added tilserver is already good enough? Or at least I think it is not really obvious how to use it.

1. How can add a new connection to a tile server? Is the browser the only way? If yes, I hope that an additional entry to Layer --> Add Layer menu could be added - all other layer types can be added this way.

2. What is a correct URL? This is really hard to find out. F.e. I went to http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers and tried to copy some URLs and failed about finding the correct syntax. I added the layer to the project --> nothing happened. No display, no error message. Maybe because the projections do not match? - or would QGIS reproject on the fly?

3. Can we add some popular tile map server URLs by default - similar to the QuickMapServices plugin?

4. How can one edit an existing tile server connection - e.b. change title or URL? Currently, one can only delete and re-add it.

-----------------

Thank you for your reply,

Andreas

Hi Tom,

Yes, that hides the fields in the qgis2web layers and groups panel, and 
the same fields do not appear in the webmap popup.

oh - SRP was indeed turned off. Silly me! 

Still I find that the "standard" methods of adding layers in QGIS should
also be provided for the tile servers, such as "Layer management
toolbar" and Menu "Layer --> AddLayer --> Add tile map server layer". I
personally normally don't use the QGIS browser panel and this means that
I can't add tile maps if this panel is not open. Or maybe the xyz tile
map servers could be integrated with the WMS/WMTS layer loading
dialogue? 

Thanks for your reply!

Hmm.. I'm actually of the other opinion and was wondering whether this way
of adding providers could help cut down on the toolbar bloat that QGIS
suffers from. I'll admit it's not immediately discoverable for users, but
maybe there's some way we could fix that...

Right :-)

I agree it could be more user friendly. I was mainly focused on
getting the engine right, so the GUI is very very simple.

Currently yes, only through the browser. If we want to be consistent
with other layer types, a dialog with list of connections could be
added. There are also few more options like min/max zoom level that
are supported by the implementation, but not exposed in the GUI yet.


> 2. What is a correct URL? This is really hard to find out. F.e. I went to

Basically, the XYZ provider does replacement of {x}, {y}, {z}
placeholders by the tile coordinates. Alternatively, for Bing maps, we
support {q} placeholder that contains XYZ coordinate encoded in a
slightly different way. Generally, the syntax of URLs is the same as
in QuickMapServices plugin...

Reprojection on the fly should just work, CRS of XYZ tile layers is
assumed to be always web mercator.


> 3. Can we add some popular tile map server URLs by default - similar to the
> QuickMapServices plugin?

I we could, but I do not feel easy adding some services by default.
Maybe we could have some predefined services with links to their
license agreements that users would need to confirm beforehand.

> or URL? Currently, one can only delete and re-add it.

Yeah, that's the only way for now.

Most of the GUI improvements are quite easy to implement, I am sure we
can keep working on them for the next releases (probably too late for
inclusion in 2.18).

Cheers
Martin

Hi Denis,

should you not also set LD_LIBRARY_PATH? It looks like something is not
picking up your fresh lib files?

I compile/install myself in a custom dir, and have to set this both for
running QGIS or to run pyqgis stuff

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/richard/apps/qgis/master/debug/lib/

I also have another 'set environment' script, that set's the

export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=/home/richard/apps/qgis/master/debug

maybe try that? Not sure what really is picked up to be honest.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Denis

If you are on 64bits Fedora, the libs are probably searched for in 
/usr/lib64.

You can run python through strace to check where it is looking for the 
libraries, i.e.

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/qgis/python strace python -m 
qgis.PyQt.uic.pyuic

and then just look at which open syscalls are trying to open 
libqgis_core and where.


Hope this helps
Sandro

Sure - that'd be great! The changes are merged to master (not
backported to master_2 yet, but I will), so if you're running a dev
build you should have access to them now.

Apologies, I missed this message. I only have four items listed, none of
which are duplicates. Various inconsistencies - forward slashes not
backslashes on Windows, a double slash, inconsistent trailing slash, and a
"/./". No idea how relevant the actual locations are:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsRubberBand and check for identical points in
	addPoint(...)
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C57C284E@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi,

I was trying to use python to add 3 identical points to a QgsRubberBand using .addPoint(point) and was wondering why I got a core dump when I was trying to move the third point to a new position. Looking into the code I found the following (line 172 in qgsrubberband.cpp):

  if ( mPoints.at<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlist.html#at>( geometryIndex ).size() == 2 &&
       mPoints.at<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlist.html#at>( geometryIndex ).at( 0 ) == mPoints.at<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlist.html#at>( geometryIndex ).at( 1 ) )
  {
       mPoints[geometryIndex].last<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlist.html#last>() = p;
  }
  else
  {
      mPoints[geometryIndex] << p;
  }

I was wondering why this special check is made?

I wanted to just add 3 points to the rubber band to initialize it with the points that I needed. It was easy to just copy the same "addPoint" line 2 times, but a workaround is simply adding 3 different dummy points and then later move them to where I want them. The .movePoint don't check for the above and doesn't care if the three points are identical.

My reason for asking is that this is not stated in the API [1] and a core dump is pretty difficult to debug if you're writing python plugins.


Regards, Casper

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Stepping back from the PSC
Message-ID: <5285e4f7-ce09-fb86-f404-cab7176c1964@sourcepole.ch>

Dear QGIS devs

After being 10 years in the QGIS PSC, I'd like to step back from my 
position as a technical advisor. I feel that I don't have the necessary 
time any more, so I would like to use the time I have for technical 
things rather than organizational aspects of the project. Of course I'm 
continuing to be a member of the developer team, so we'll stay in 
contact anyway.

As discussed with Tim and in yesterdays PSC meeting, the project 
organisation will be changed, possibly to move the former PSC roles over 
to technical workgroup leads. Therefore we are not going to renew 
outgoing PSC positions.

Finally I'd like to thank the other PSC members for the good 
collaboration and the amazing work during all that time.

Best regards,
Marco

Hi Andreas,

oh - SRP was indeed turned off. Silly me!

Still I find that the "standard" methods of adding layers in QGIS should also be provided for the tile servers, such as "Layer management toolbar" and Menu "Layer --> AddLayer --> Add tile map server layer". I personally normally don't use the QGIS browser panel and this means that I can't add tile maps if this panel is not open. Or maybe the xyz tile map servers could be integrated with the WMS/WMTS layer loading dialogue?

Thanks for your reply!

Hi Andreas,

 

It works fine with my layers and the OTF on.

 

Including some default services would be great, but unfortunately there are some restrictions in using the service. 

 

See the original discussions here:

So I found out that http://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png <http://tile.openstreetmap.org/%7bz%7d/%7bx%7d/%7by%7d.png>  seems to work.

However, if I add this OSM layer to my Swiss QGIS project (EPSG:21781) - the swiss data seems to appear in the atlantic, west of "Guinea Ecuatorial" ;-(

Hi,

I have a couple of questions around the new "Tileserver" layer support in QGIS desktop to be released with 2.18. I think the main commit is https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f5b657db19eda7e72e6ed34eb7fe333c156acad0 - right?

First, let me thank you a lot for this -  Martin and Lutra Consulting for developing/sponsoring it!

-----------------

However, I wonder if the usability of the newly added tilserver is already good enough? Or at least I think it is not really obvious how to use it.

1. How can add a new connection to a tile server? Is the browser the only way? If yes, I hope that an additional entry to Layer --> Add Layer menu could be added - all other layer types can be added this way.

2. What is a correct URL? This is really hard to find out. F.e. I went to http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers and tried to copy some URLs and failed about finding the correct syntax. I added the layer to the project --> nothing happened. No display, no error message. Maybe because the projections do not match? - or would QGIS reproject on the fly?

3. Can we add some popular tile map server URLs by default - similar to the QuickMapServices plugin?

4. How can one edit an existing tile server connection - e.b. change title or URL? Currently, one can only delete and re-add it.

-----------------

Thank you for your reply,

Andreas

Hi Saber, 

I totally agree. It is great to have it in core. We just need to bring
it "on par" with the usability of e.g. the QuickMapServices. Otherwise,
people will just continue to use this plugin instead of the core QGIS
functionality. 

BTW: the QuickMapServices plugin also supports transparency, brightness,
contrast, grayscale, blend modes, smoothing, etc. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

I personally normally don't use the QGIS browser panel and this means that I can't add tile maps if this panel is not open. Or maybe the xyz tile map servers could be integrated with the WMS/WMTS layer loading dialogue?

Thanks Marco for everything you have done for the project. And thanks
for staying with us as a core developer. 

You had been my very first contact regarding QGIS and helped me a lot to
establish QGIS at my previous work place in Uster. Without your support
I would have had a hard time introducing QGIS/FOSSGIS at this local
government. 

I also appreciated your commitment regarding QGIS Server in these past
years! 

Thanks a lot!

On behalf of the PSC I really want to 'thank you' for all that you have done to help with steering the project over the years. Many people probably don't realize how much behind the scenes stuff goes on within the PSC and what a big time commitment it can constitute. Needless to say that I can fully empathize with a desire to spend your available time focussed on technical work. I look forward to your continued input into the runnings of the project, even if you are not a PSC member any more. Please know that you (like anyone else) are always welcome to sit in on our PSC meetings should you have any special topics you wish to raise with the PSC.

As Marco mentioned above, we have discussed what will happen when Marco leaves and at this stage we are not going to replace his position on the PSC. We will soon be sharing the proposed updates to the QGIS Board Statutes, which includes in it provisions for more regular recruitment and replacement of PSC members via annual elections (similar to how OSGEO Board staffing is managed). Our intent is also to keep the PSC operating at this reduced size to make decision making more fluid. We plan to rely more heavily on technical working groups (with autonomy to make decisions in their field of influence). In Bonn we already set up the first two technical working groups with Yves Jacolin heading up the documentation team (Otto Dassau has also stepped down from the PSC) and Lene Fischer heading up the community events team (tasked with ensuring that regular QGIS community events happen). I expect that we will establish a 'Technical Team' with Marco's departure who will take care of the system architecture related decisions. Technical team leads will typically be by appointment from the PSC since the leaders will typically need to have special skills or experience and also be able to provide a fairly long term commitment to the task in order to keep things running smoothly. We hope that with this approach, the role of the PSC is more confined to financial management and governance for the project, and the important decisions you need to have made  within the community can be made by those most qualified to make them. I have been working on a diagram that explains the vision here (note it is a draft, open to comment):

https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178003/19094738/026c5a50-8a92-11e6-8e83-97dbc30fe6df.png

My very best regards to you Marco!

Tim

I'll add my sincere thanks to those already extended by the community!
I can't even begin to imagine how much behind the scenes work the PSC
put in keeping this project running smoothly. You guys are the true
heroes behind QGIS and without your tireless efforts (and infinite
patience!) QGIS (and the wider open source geospatial community)
wouldn't be anywhere as strong as it is today. I don't say it often
enough, but THANK YOU.

On a personal note - Marco my boundless gratitude to all the hard work
you've put in to QGIS over the years, and how your work has shaped the
project. I'm really glad to hear you'll still be involved with the
project, and am looking forward to seeing what future contributions
you have planned!

Hi all,
this is the first wide democracy exercise in the project - a very sound
choice IMHO, that speaks well for the future of the Association and of
the project as a whole.
Thanks to all.

I think this is probably the first time I don't agree with Nyall ;)
The flesh and bones of QGIS are really the developers[0], without whom
nothing would have been possible.
The PSC is just trying to maintain the side conditions for developers to
keep on enjoying their extraordinary work. And of course there are the
hundreds of translators, documenters, evangelists, sponsors, donors, etc.
So, thanks again Marco, both for your code and for the willingness to
deal with the less exciting parts of the project.
And seriously, Nyall, thanks, it is reassuring seeing people understand
also more obscure efforts :)
All the best.

Hi Marco,

Thank you very much for all the commitment and energy you have put into
this project. QGIS would be nowhere near where it is right now without
your efforts that have gone into making a solid project and community
from a very early point when nobody knew about the size it will
eventually grow to.

Respect!
Matthias

Hi all,

Thanks a lot to Tudor, Sandro and Richard for your input.

To solve the issue, I had to do
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

This seems a bit strange to me, shouldn't /usr/lib be automaticaly used?

Does this means that installation somehow fails to place the lib in the
proper place? /usr/lib64?

Cheers,

Denis

Maybe your $PATH is screwed by a previous install, and some leftovers
get picked up in the wrong order?

Hi Denis

You can adjust the lib install dir when configuring cmake by specifying

|-DQGIS_LIB_SUBDIR=lib64 And yes, on Fedora /usr/lib is for 32bit libs, 
/usr/lib64 for 64bit libs. Sandro |

Perfect, thanks a lot, it works!

Is there a way to integrate this automatically in cmake config? Like
detecting fedora?

Cheers,

Well in theory one could introduce some heuristics based on /usr/lib64 
existence and /etc/os-release parsing, but I don't think it's worth the 
fuss to cover all possible distro configurations honestly (and I've 
never seen a software package which does this).

	orthogonally, based on first point
Message-ID: <CABCLckBrzyR3NipVD=fqt4-gzGSK16HfC-jK+Sg=ehYLpc6ffg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have been working with CAD softwares for a long time, and I know a GIS
software will not focus only on tools for accurate digitizing.

Advanced Digitzing is a great tool that has been implemented in the newest
versions, but it still have a big problem. The last point will never be
accurated, unless you type its angle and distance. We need a tool to close
the last point based on the first alignment's perpendicular line.

Thank you

I have had several follow-up exchanges with Árni Geirsson and the conclusions 
I drew from his test results are :

- the apparent cause for performance degradation is that there exists a file 
handle opened in read/write mode on the GeoPackage. An existing file handle in 
read/write mode negatively impacts performance on read-only connections. And 
that is true when this R/W file handle is in the same process than the R/O file 
handle, or in other process (we tested ogr2ogr performance when reading a 
remote GPKG file, while QGIS opened on this GPKG)

Does such behaviour of files on network shares on Windows ring a bell to 
someone ? I tried (quickly) to find if this was a documented behaviour but 
didn't manage to find.
So my above suggested changes between 
<probably_ignore_this_and_skip_to_last_paragraph> would appear to be worth 
(except that I went a bit too fast in my explanations and you don't want to 
turn WAL on files on network shares, but this is something I had already 
implemented per #15351)

- VSI_CACHE in the GeoPackage case (when enabled with SQLITE_USE_OGR_VFS=YES) 
does not seem to bring any performance improvement. And I'd wondering if this 
wouldn't be the case now for shapefile since (contrary to what I said above), 
both shapefile and mapinfo are now opened by default in read-only mode. Or 
perhaps VSI_CACHE has still effect since in sqlite case access are made on a 
sqlite page granularity (1024 bytes) whereas for shapefile that might be just a 
few bytes. But clearly there's something happening at Windows OS level when a 
R/W connection exists.

==> It would be cool if someone could test, with QGIS 2.16.3, shapefile 
performance on network share, by removing/commenting the set VSI_CACHE=YES 
environment variable of qgis.bat.

Hi Even, well this rang with me:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/6448

it's an old discussion about reading shapefiles over a Windows network...

And it was also talking about VSI_CACHE, and I also (from the issue) had
a little chat with Frank W about it:

Thanks for the pointers. Helpful indeed.

The situation has changed since now QGIS
opens the shapefile handle of the QgsOgrProvider object in read-only mode by
default (used to be read-write before latest 1.16 and 1.14 point releases), hence
I'm wondering if the VSI_CACHE mechanism has still some effect on the read-only handles owned
by the QgsOgrFeatureIterator objects, which are the ones that matter for rendering operations.

Seeing https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365433%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
which is about opportunistic locks, I would think that a read-write file handle would defeat
opportunistic locks, hence the slowness seen. That would also what Radim suggested in a comment :
"OpLocks are broken for read only files, not for read write files if opened as read only, at least this was observed on Windows XP + Samba"

Message-ID: <3AD57812-B6C4-4C0B-AEB8-DE87080DFAA9@qgis.org>

Hi All

I have started preparing the changelog for 2.18:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.18.0/

The usual caveat applies: Please do not publicize this link until the changelog is completed and the release is ready.

If anyone has worked on newsworthy features for 2.18 please add your proposed entries there (I am still working back through the commit log adding any obvious ones I can see there, I will finish that tomorrow night). You should be able to sign in to the site and post new entries using your GitHub user credentials. If that presents any problem for you, please just email me directly with the text and ideally a screenshot, and I will add it for you. Also if you can improve text and graphics for existing entries, please feel free to submit your suggestions.

I will be adding a few notes at the top of the changelog description of the upcoming feature freeze breakage for 2.18.1 (to add DWG support) and 2.18.2 GeoPackage provider improvements. @Even could you provide a little detail about the planned GeoPackage improvements for 2.18.2? 

Thanks in advance!

Regards

Tim

Tim,

Hum, I'm not sure if this will go into 2.18. Was more intended to be for 
master and possibly backported in master_2 if feasible. But I guess if 
master_2 is doable, backport to 2.18.X could also be done (although there will 
be non trivial changes in DB manager to separate the spatialite code path and 
GPKG code path)

Anyway, here are the topics:
  *   Add, rename and remove columns, both in the "Fields tab" of QGIS, but 
also in the DB manager ( Note: this will require GDAL 2.2dev for rename and 
remove columns)
  *   Add capability to save an existing layer in the project with "Save As" 
into an already existing geopackage (rather than overwriting it)
  *   DB-Manager: rename existing tables in geopackage ( Note: this will 
require GDAL 2.2dev)
  *   DB-Manager: delete tables from the geopackage.
  *   DB-Manager: load non-geometry tables

There will be other improvements, but probably master only.

Is this one public yet? I'd love to have a look over.

I haven't started yet development of any of those items (in QGIS or in GDAL) 
for now. In the next days...

Pretty sure I'm not the only OCD member of the QGIS team who hates
inconsistency and is affected by these issues ;)

First issue: with doxygen comments, do we go:

1.

/**
 * my awesome function
 * does something cool
 */

or

2.

/** my awesome function
 * does something cool
 */

Second issue: do we

1. Write in full sentences, with initial caps + trailing "." eg "Does
something cool to QGIS."

or

2. Use fragments, with no caps or ".", eg "does something cool"

and does this apply to both the descriptions AND extra tags like
notes? Or do different rules apply?


Third issue:

Do we document parameters? I've been doing this because doxygen
requires an "all or nothing" approach, eg you can't only document the
tricky parameters and leave obvious ones out. This ends up in a lot of
obvious "@param fillColor new fill color" type docs, which seem
redundant. I generally do this so that the occasional trickier
parameter is easier to document (eg "@param symbol new symbol style
for fill, ownership is transferred to the renderer"). But I often
wonder if everyone is wondering what the heck I'm doing writing docs
like "@param width new width", so I'm curious to hear other
opinions...


That is all

Ok - was just wondering if you're planning on hooking into existing
methods like QgsVectorDataProvider::renameAttributes here or whether
it'll be something specific to this format.

That will of course use QgsOgrProvider::renameAttributes() which already 
exists and calls OGR_L_AlterFieldDefn(), so it is a matter of implementing the 
AlterFieldDefn API in the OGR GPKG driver.

I've been thinking about the same. And have some opinions.

My vote clearly goes to #2.

The reason is that it adds additional space between one method and the
comment of the next method (which are logically different parts).
This helps (me) to be able scroll through headers quicker and still spot
method names.

+1 to 2.

The advantage of full sentences is, that they always work and can be
used consistently. And a quick look at the Qt docs shows that they seem
to be doing the same.

+0 on 1.

I like self-explanatory names and I don't like stating the obvious.
Therefore I'm rather in the camp "if a parameter name is intuitive, I
don't want to spend some of my attention and screen space on parsing
useless documentation for it".

I don't have a problem with only including params where there is useful
additional info (also if 4 of these 5 parameters are not of this kind),
same for return. Documenting parameters for setters and return values
for getters is mostly redundant.

But I can totally understand if someone once to keep this consistent.

Do you mean #1 here?
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b642c3ff5ede2cae88d30f881f7ae7c99e1bfccc#diff-aaa596c71ada12dd18c410856a8f4f77R64
would lead me to think you prefer that style?

Agree - BUT doxygen doesn't allow this and will throw a warning. So
for any method with at least one parameter which needs useful docs it
requires all parameters to be documented. One solution could be to
just go:

/**
 *  My function.
 * @param color
 * @param size
 * @param p magic number. If p > 5 then qgis will run faster, if p = 5
then qgis 2.0 api will be used, if p< 5 then output will be scaled to
painter's dpi.
 */

Ie put the @param's for obvious parameters to keep doxygen happy but
leave them empty. That would help draw attention to important
parameters.

Ok cool. I've been thinking (based on the recent discussion re table
manager plugin) that this existing rename field ability is quite
hidden from users and could do with a better UI. Maybe it's time for

I agree that it would be useful to implement a better UI for the whole
fields/widget/form management. It has been on the table for the past 2-3
years, but was never on the top of the list. It could be one topic for
the 2017 QGIS grants proposals or for the QGIS-CH sponsoring projects.
So far, our (QGIS.ORG/QGIS-CH) financial resources for 2016 are
exhausted. Of course, if someone wants to work on this on his free time
or finds another sponsor, it would be very nice if this could make it
into QGIS 3.x rather sooner than later. 

However, I wonder if the management of the drag and drop designer,
couldn't be more WYSIWYG. Other GIS software (like Autocad
Topobase/Map3d Infrastructure suite (or whatever it is called these
days)) can also do this. Can't we embed a form preview and have a better
"live" preview of our configuration (e.g. of tabs, groups, widgets,
labels, etc. Currently it is a bit like "working in the dark". 

Greetings,
Andreas

Sorry to hijack this thread. Should we resurrect the discussion about
setting up targeted donations for specific projects?
All the best.

In GEOS, I've learnt to leave a blank space between the short
description and the long description, which each have a role
and can alternatively been marked with \brief and dunno which other
tage (in GEOS the Doxygen configuration accepts the blank line).

So, assuming the QGIS Doxygen configuration does the same,
it would be:

/**
 * My awesome function
 *
 * Does something cool
 * 
 */

No preferences here for me.

I tend to only document non-trivial params too, but if that makes
doxygen raise lots of warning it's worth reducing them.

Hi, 

I believe that a small thing that we could do and which would already
help is to maintain a list of current projects that need funding - and
add the contact information of the developer, who wants to work on it.
Maybe we could re-use the QEPs and publish a list of current QEPs and
add financial/contact information. And then delegate all the financials
to the dev. In addition, we could advertise these projects on social
media and amont the local QGIS user groups. The dev can then decide
whether he wants to deal with really small donations or whether he wants
to set a minimum amount to contributions. 

It would be a simple and effective way to make such projects more
visible to the public, while not adding a lot of bureaucracy. 

Also - if we would do all the financials through QGIS.ORG it would mean
a lot of work for me and we'd have to deal with tax issues, different
country laws, etc. - something I would like to avoid. And in general the
targetted donations would usually not meet the overall target, etc. It
is better if the dev who wants to work on an improvement would deal with
such issues.

Agreed fully, also my thought.

One more thing we have been discussing is to include a link to that info
directly in the QGIS interface, for an easier discovery by the hundreds
of thousands users that never visit our blogs, ML, etc.
Of course we should find the right balance between visibility and
unobtrusiveness.
All the best.

The first one has a nice symmetry, the second one is more compact... I
am fine with either.

+1 for this option.

I am very much in favor of not having the @param tags in the docs...
in most of the cases the meaning of parameters is very obvious, for
the less obvious ones I would mention them in the method documentation
and explain them in further detail... just like in Qt docs, which
seems to work pretty well. Python docs also do not come with a table
of parameters, they rather explain those in text.

Hi,

I posted this on the QGIS user list about a week ago but got no answers, maybe somebody here can point me in the right direction ? Thanks a lot!

When I try to open the SQL window in DB Manager, I get this error :
AttributeError: 'SqlEdit' object has no attribute 'setMarginVisible'
I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.

Here's the complete error message :
AttributeError: 'SqlEdit' object has no attribute 'setMarginVisible'
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/db_manager/db_manager.py", line

line 73, in __init__
      self.editSql.setMarginVisible(True)
AttributeError: 'SqlEdit' object has no attribute 'setMarginVisible'

Version de Python : 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 18:01:27) [GCC 4.8.2]
Version de QGIS : 2.14.7-Essen Essen, exported

Does anyone have the same problem ? Is it a known issue, or should I open one ?

Thanks !

Julie.

Hi Michaël,

 

Sorry, I missed your reply when it originally came through. Can you elaborate further on how to use the code snippet? I’m only very vaguely following what you’re saying to do so far.

 

Separately, would it be possible to add an image type to the symbol editor for shapefiles, etc. that can use the an equation to create the image name and then display the image from there?

 

Thanks,

 

JQ

​Hi, you could use this snippets :
https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/d66191ccfadd74cff3f0

Basically, it loads an image for each feature in a SVG, which can then be used as a symbol.

All,

 

I was wondering if anyone knows of a current method for displaying geotagged images (or maybe just a thumbnail) directly on the map canvas without having to click on one image a time? I saw this thread, but the solution seems to be deprecated now: http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Showing-thumbnails-of-geotagged-photos-td5008632.html 

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Abstract GUI base class
Message-ID: <a51ebbea-c965-2aa5-5bff-c4e3499ac076@gmail.com>

Hi

We are considering porting our abstract GUI class from KADAS Albireo to 
QGIS 3.0, basically what was done here [1][2]. Summary is that qgisapp 
contains all functionalities which are gui-logic independent and 
qgsclassicapp contains the logic tying functionalities to the gui 
implementation.

The advantages of this are, besides better code separation (which IMO 
qgisapp could benefit from since it's become a bit of a dumping ground), 
that it easier for people to write custom guis for QGIS (i.e. very 
application specific GUIs exposing only certain functionalities etc) 
while sharing the codebase with upstream.

QGIS 3.0 would be a good moment to perform such refactoring. So I'd like 
to hear a short feedback whether people would welcome such a change in 
principle before moving on to drafting a QEP.

Thanks
Sandro

Just speculating,  have you tried instead of using a custom qgs widget to promote a QWidget to one of the custom widget?  I used this in the past for using my own widgets in my plugins. An example here [1]

Hi Sandro,

This sounds interesting.
What I wonder mostly is how much of the design and concept should be
imposed on customized apps. This forces either

 * custom apps to adjust to api changes in the app libarary
 * the app library to guarantee api stability

Not having to care for api stability in the app library currently allows
for much flexibility and speed in development.

Something else is where the line between "custom" and "generic" is
drawn. QField (or roam which I don't know very well) are also custom
interfaces. I guess each one of these will draw their line at a
different level. For QField for example, anything that involves things
from the QtWidgets library is out of scope.

Another approach would be to reimplement the QgisInterface instead of
the app. This specifically documents to be meant for 3rd party apps to
be reimplemented.
https://github.com/sourcepole/kadas-albireo/blob/master/src/gui/qgisinterface.h#L58-L62

Could you potentially split this up into multiple levels of
abstractions? Telling plugin developers that they can only use
functionality from the QgisTinyInterface if they want to be compatible
with everyone or use the QgisFullBlastInterface if it should be
fine-tuned for the QGIS classic app?

If it helps to improve the channel from your developments back to
upstream, that will be much appreciated.

All the best
Matthias

I've commited in GDAL trunk and 2.1 branch a fix that revises the way repacking 
of shapefiles is done, so as to use in-place rewrite of the already opened file 
rather than trying to remove the temporary copies on top of them, which was 
prone to issues with files being locked elsewhere. From my tests this solve the 
issues I could reproduce in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15570 and 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15393 and I'm reasonably confident this is a robust 
fix for other similar cases. Anyway, testing by others to confirm would be 
appreciated.

I've tried your file 2.16.3 in a Win7 VM with 4GB and trying to reproduce your 
actions but didn't get a crash. I managed painfully to move a node of the 
coastline of western part of France. Note that I used a 64 bit build, and I 
noticed that the memory consumption goes up to 3 GB when you enable the Node 
tool (goes down to 300 MB once you finish all editing actions), so if you use a 
32 bit build, a crash is not surprising. 
All the actions are super slow, particularly making a node active and moving 
it. There are clearly issues, with algorithms, data structures and memory use, 
when dealing with huge polygons.
I also noticed that there's apparently always a core busy until you finish 
editing.

The issue here is that the node tool adds a new QGraphicsItem to the canvas
for every node - so in a complex polygon you can end up with 100k's of
items in the scene. Then these items are repainted for every mouse move
across the canvas.... Ouch!!

One good solution here would be to enable Qt's inbuilt caching for the map
canvas QGraphicsItems. I experimented with this with good results, but also
a bunch of bugs I didn't have a chance to fix at the time... (Could not
find anyway to force qt to invalidate the cache for every item in the scene
when the map scale/extent changed)

Even - thanks for all the hard work you've put into this fix. It's much
appreciated!

I'll give it some testing over the next week and will let you know if I hit
any issues.

Thats OK. Basically in Bonn we agreed that we would leave the door open for some small feature additions improvements in 2.18.1 (DWG provider) and 2.18.2 (GPKG enhancements if read) in order to avoid having a situation where these improvements languish in master for an unspecified time before the 3.0 release comes out. If you do not need to take advantage of this exception that is also fine.

Hope that makes sense! Thanks for the details below. I think I will just put something generic in the changelog mentioning that my comments above and some bullets from your outline below.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Visualisation of relations
Message-ID: <CAKOK4jjcyWim1brG3xaMg2=mxyQsZpPbG38i+wdUjH7RnALBfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm tasked with making QGIS a bit more usable with complex database schemas
having a lot of relations (up to hundreds of linked tables). The INSPIRE
people were a bit too inspired when creating their data schemas and now we
have to try to make QGIS able to cope with that.

My concerns with the current situation (as of QGIS master) are:

   - We can specify the relations between the layers at the project level
   (it's now easier with the auto-discover feature for PostGIS and
   Spatialite). But those are only showing in the QgsAttributeForm for the 1-N
   side (the side that doesn't have the foreign key). Why not on the N-1 side?
   - For showing the N-1 side in the QgsAttributeForm, one can define a
   Join in the layer's properties, but I don't see the point of having to
   define it here as well when we have already the relations info at the
   project level. I see a use for special joins, but for relations, I don't
   see why we have to define it twice. And the way it's displayed is not
   allowing to create joins or edit the joined fields.
   - I let you imagine the look of the feature attribute form when there
   are hundreds of directly and indirectly linked tabled. This is just not
   usable if we display all of them directly like that. Just look at the
   attached screen shot that shows what happens by default with only 3 tables.
   It's already a mess.

Now, what I propose is:

   - Not expand the relation widget (QgsCollapsibleGroupBox) by default and
   build it's content only when it is expanded the first time (think of what
   would happen when you have loops in the schema).
   - Show N-1 relations as well, in a collapsed by default
   QgsCollapsibleGroupBox, including a way to add a new linked entry, remove
   the link (put the FK to NULL) and delete it.
   - Add a button to open a related feature in a new window.

What do you guys think?

Thanks.

I vote for self explanatory var names and less time spent documenting
obvious stuffs.
Btw if a param description is necessary... to leave doxy quite, add
the description for all.
I don't remember many cases where vars names does not explain their meaning.
If a var has a polysemantic meaning, probably the api have to be redefined.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A different behavior in Qt5 beaks a lot of things.
Message-ID: <CAKOK4jiMk+SyFkX5sAa3t8hx6ZQs1Ts01Jsjht2pSL+6i5BaJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was investigating a new bug when editing a feature's attribute with the
current master.
For example, if you don't touch the configuration of a layer containing
integer fields, save the project, exit, re-open the project, when you edit
the attribute of this layer, all the integer fields are forced to 0.

The problem must come from a different behavior with Qt5. Before, the field
config for text was saved like that:
<widgetv2config AllowNull="0" labelOnTop="0" fieldEditable="1" notNull="0"/>

Now, it's saved like that:
<widgetv2config Style="" Min="" AllowNull="0" labelOnTop="0"
constraintDescription="" fieldEditable="1" notNull="0" Max="" Step=""
constraint=""/>

See? All the non-boolean fields that are not specified are now there with
an empty value.

My guess is that QDomElement::setAttribute was a no-op for QString::null
and now it adds an attribute with an empty string. I don't know. But it's a
mess now. Code in the QgsEditorWrapper will end up not using default values
when they do stuff like:
const QString displayFormat = config( "display_format",
QgsDateTimeEditConfig::defaultFormat( field().type() ) ).toString();

The config entry being always there, but empty when not specified, the
default will never be taken. It's then same for range widget's min and max
values then ends up being 0 (my original bug).

And I'm afraid the edit widgets are not the only ones suffering from those
problems.

Am I the only one seeing that? What do we do, now?

Thanks

hummm... in fact I start to think the problem is there from the start. I've
just made it more visible with my "better default widget" feature.
The operations to reproduce:

   - new project
   - add a postgis layer with integer attributes
   - open the attribute form and see that everything is OK
   - edit the layer properties
   - have a look at the fields
   - click OK (will make sure there are widgetv2config in the XML)
   - save the project somewhere
   - open the project
   - open the attribute form and see that all the integer fields are 0

OK, I'm working on a fix for the widgets that now appears by default.

Hi all,
strangely enough, today it does not crash. The connection yesterday was
unstable, so I suspect this could be the culprit.
All the best.

Message-ID: <61632617-7b32-76b1-ff29-f1770a8890d2@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
reprojecting a raster from 4326 to 3857 through Save as... menu works,
whereas the same through Processing does not:

gdalwarp -ot Float32 -t_srs EPSG:3857 -r near -of GTiff -te -20.0 40.0
20.0 90.0 -te_srs EPSG:4326 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=1 -co
ZLEVEL=6 -wo OPTIMIZE_SIZE=TRUE gt30w020n90.dem OUTPUT.tif
GDAL command output:
ERROR 1: tolerance condition error
ERROR 1: -te_srs ignored since coordinate transformation failed.

With GDALTools it works. The CL in this case is:

gdalwarp -overwrite -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:3857 -of GTiff
gt30w020n90.dem test_repro.tif

So apparently Processing introduces unnecessary, damaging, params.

All the best.

Hi Gents,

I cannot comment on the technical finesses of this discussion, but is it
related to: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13494#note-19 ?

Because I also bumped on some initialization problems during recent
pyqgis experiments. My feeling was that those are related to the
initialisation of the auth system (and QGIS in general)

So I would applaud any energy put into this, now we can :-)

Regards,

Richard

Hi,
LTR docs? Is there any new LTR already scheduled? afaics, 2.14 has its doc
released.

That said, yes, there were nice plans among the grant applications we
should keep and help realise.

Harrissou

I've encountered the same problem when i try to split some polygons.

I don't really understand what was the problem, just some hint:

- it occours only on windows. The same shapefile works fine on Linux.
- it also affects qgis 2.14
- is not connected with topology error. The problem remain also after using
v.clean.

I hope this could be useful

	GRASS Plugin and GRASS 7.0.5
Message-ID: <CAMCJChs4zDUGwCd_Ti5DpyP_pXXbqz+EBh6Rvrm78UVifeheaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

GRASS Plugin doesn't show up in QGIS 2.16.3, when using GRASS 7.0.5.
Downgrading GRASS to 7.0.3, it works ok. (Tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 64bits)

With QGIS master nightly build (git20161004), GRASS Plugin already works
with GRASS 7.0.5. (Tested on a Xubuntu 14.04 32 bits)

Will the fix be backported to QGIS 2.16.x?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

I assume that your input is

http://svn.simo-project.org/tools/trunk/txt2latlon/data/

A quick test from the cli would have shown you that the issue is in

"20.0 40.0 20.0 90.0"

for the "-te" parameter. If a smaller extent is defined the
tool/command works (in fact the exact extent of the raster is not that
one). Leaving the extent automatically defined/computed by Processing
does not seems to be an issue for the majority of inputs.

Regarding this tool my question is another: why the "te_srs" parameter
(and by consequence also "te") has been made mandatory?

If the parameter is not needed, it should be optional.

If anyone can confirm that, I will make it optional.

From the doc http://gdal.org/gdalwarp.html, the only required parameters are 
the input and output files :-)

Thanks. IMHO the interface for this module should be less intimidating,
moving optional params to an Advanced section.
As noted, it is possible that other similar modules share the same issue.
All the best.

Hi,

Sorry, my previous message was a bit "dry". Here are the steps:

* Open the vector layer properties dialog
* Go to the Style tab
* Use "Single symbol renderer"
* Choose "SVG Symbol"
* In the text input with the path to SVG, instead of using the "..." button
to choose a file, click instead of the button right next to it, to be able
to enter an expression. Choose "Edit"
* It opens a new dialog, with 2 tabs : Expression and Function  editor ->
Go to the latest "Function editor" tab.
* You can here create a "New file" via the button at the top
* Then choose a name, and then you can copy/paste the whole text you found
in the URL https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/d66191ccfadd74cff3f0
* Then you can go back to the first tab "Expression", and use an expression
such as

show_picture( "picture_path_fieldname" )

where "picture_path_filename" is the name of the field containing the path
to the image for each feature. (you can have absolute path, or better,
paths relative to the QGIS project)


This is a bit cumbersome, but should work :)

Michaël

really hard to decide about LTR PyQGIS... probably a community poll
can be useful with a (short term) discussion. My reason to explain why
it is hard to decide are:
1) I would invest and push developer to dev and port 3.0 plugins
2) pyqgis dev knowledge is almost covered also by StackExchange... I
agree that wouldn't be the way to document, but we are facing
transition to 3
3) LTR will will terminate afgter 3.0 release and it's documentation
will become strongly obsolete with 3.0 transition.
For this reason I wouldn't invest in ltr pyqgis doc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SSL connection does not update Cert Authorities.
	call for verification.
Message-ID: <CAFO80_pYYKfctp=88f2uYVSuuW0-aTTNV_=OUky-frzYyNvVZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I filed the following issue: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15687
Would be fine to have more confirmation on different Windows versions
or othere OSs.

thi sis the text of the issue:

***********************
I found a misalignement in SSL Root Certificate Authorities (CAs)
caching at least in WIN. This bug has been found developing a solution
to: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15617

ABSTRACT
A brief description of the bug(?) and after a detailed step procedure
to reproduce it:
Any SO has a SSL conf has a list of CAs. These are used to setup the
ssl communication to verify if peer cert can be trusted or not. If the
system CAs list change this would affect the subsequent connection.
I found that if I remove or add a CA, next connections "remember" the
previous CA list for a while (some minutes).

to reproduce the error I tryied to connect to
https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com that is signed by:
"AddTrust CA External CA Root"

By default AddTrust is not present in Windows CAs. But.
- if it is present it can be removed using "certmgr.msc"
- if not present y can be automatically added by OS just browsing in a
windows keystore capable browser (no Firefox) tghe following
link:https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml
The OS will check the URL CA and will check if it can be trusted, and
if so, it will be added in the keystore.

PREMISE:
To generate sslError I ued to connect to a erroneous OWS service, eg
WMS or WFS. The reason is to use only pure c++ code.

The steps to reproduce the errors are on WIN7 (but should be the same
on any win OS):
- remove AddTrust CA if present
- in QGIS trying to connect to
https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml using wms service
(=> only c++ code)
- => sslError dialog will be opened. !!! ABort it and not push the
Ignore button !!!
- load https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml in Explorer
and verify that "AddTrust" has been added in certmgr.msc
- executing the following python code in console
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildCaCertsCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildCertTrustCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildTrustedCaCertsCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildIgnoredSslErrorCache()
You can verify that new CA is updated in qgis in
settings->options->authentication->Manage Certificates->Authorities
- tryed to reconnect to
https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml using wms service
- !!!continuing!!! to have sslError dialog
- waiting a while (5'?) I'm able to receive a WMS error => no more sslError

The procedure to reproduce the bug can be also inverted:
- started qgis having the CA AddTrust installed (no sslerror)
- connect to wms service
https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml => wms error but not
sslError dialog
- removed AddTrust
- executed the following python code in console
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildCaCertsCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildCertTrustCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildTrustedCaCertsCache()
QgsAuthManager.instance().rebuildIgnoredSslErrorCache()
You can verify that CA is removed in qgis in
settings->options->authentication->Manage Certificates->Authorities
- connect to WMS => still wms error but not sslError dialog
- after a while the sslError come back connecting to WMS service

Subject: [Qgis-developer] memory-based layers and projects
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1Oe=q_RXZQOmphhi1ztfHHrFQM=-eBuz_yM=3wm89A2QJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have plugin which creates memory based layer and loads data into
this layer using its own reader.

"""
class MyLayer(QgsVectorLayer):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__('Point?crs=epsg:4326',
                                            name,
                                            'memory')

    def load(self, reader):
        for f in reader:
            self._process_row(f) # add features to the map layer
"""

The problem occures when user stores such layer in the project. Then
the project file contains only:

"""
     <datasource>memory?geometry=Point&amp;crs=EPSG:4326&amp;field=ader_microSvh:(0,0)...</datasource>
"""

So after loading the project, empty layer appears (with defined
attributes), but with no points loaded. Is there any way how to define
for such layer python code which would perform loading points using
plugin reader when opening a project?

Of course plugin could store (export) loaded data eg. into SQLite DB,
but this is not the way I would like to go.

Thanks in advance for any pointers, Martin

Hi Martin

One option you could use is to install the MemoryLayerSaver plugin.  That saves the data for all memory layers in a project into a file named after the project file.

Cheers
Chris

thanks. But this option is something what I would like to avoid (no
new files created, regardless format - SQLite Db or mldata). Ideally
to provide to QGIS information how to load data (python code for
running plugin reader) and from which file.

Anyway thanks for the feedback! Martin

Hi Matthias

Personally I think it's okay to force custom apps to adapt to the app 
library changes, the effort of doing so is way smaller than having to 
port the app abstraction from release to release.

As for where the line is drawn: this proposal would mean one can go as 
far as swap the main QMainWindow with a custom implementation. I don't 
know if it makes sense drawing the line at another level?

As for QQgisInterface re-implementation: I'm not sure I see how one 
could swap out the main window with that approach, besides hiding the 
"classic" app main window constructed in main.cpp and killing of any 
signals that may interact with it - am I missing something?

Best
Sandro

Hei Martin,

Do you think of something like a python macro to be run at project start?

Then maybe this helps:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

myDialog = None
notesField = None

def formOpen(dialog,layerid,featureid):
    global myDialog
    global notesField

    myDialog = dialog
    notesField = dialog.findChild(QPlainTextEdit,"Notes")
    buttonBox = dialog.findChild(QDialogButtonBox,"buttonBox")

    # Disconnect the signal that QGIS has wired up for the dialog to the
button box.
    buttonBox.accepted.disconnect(myDialog.accept)
    # Wire up our own signals.
    buttonBox.accepted.connect(validate)
    #buttonBox.rejected.connect(myDialog.reject)

def validate():
    if notesField.document().characterCount() > 1000:
        msgBox = QMessageBox()
        msgBox.setText("Notes field must be <1000 characters")
        msgBox.exec_()
    else:
        myDialog.accept()

What happens is that I get the message box with the error, but when I click
OK on the message box the form closes and saves anyway and I still lose
text in the multiline field if it exceeds the field length.  How do I keep
the form open to allow the user to fix the error(s)?

Thanks,

Andrew

 between Desktop and Server
Message-ID: <13e79420bc1fc27f0f6b1d3e2be4e44b@carto.net>

Hi, 

I noticed that $scale and @map_scale exist in parallel, but are not
consistently behaving between QGIS Desktop and QGIS server. 

$scale: works fine on both Desktop and Server, but expression preview in
QGIS Desktop fails. 

@map_scale: works fine on QGIS Desktop and also in expression preview,
but fails on QGIS Server. 

Context: expression to calculate letter spacing in a label for different
map scale. Tested on QGIS Master 2.x on Windows 7 64bit. 

Thank you, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Server doesn't have access to any of the map settings related variables,
like the scale, rotation, extent, etc. (This is why 25d ordering is messed
up in server).

Server needs to be ported away from the old map renderer before this can be
fixed.

Hi Nyall, 

Thank you - this explains it. I wasn't aware that QGIS server uses an
old map renderer. I did not even know that different map renderers
exist. But this has nothing to do with the old vs. the new symbology -
right? Because QGIS Server seems to work just fine with the new
symbology and labeling. 

So much work to do around QGIS 3.x / QGIS Server, etc. ...

Yes, it still uses the pre-multithreaded renderer. There's a work in
progress PR here fixing it:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsField::length semantic
Message-ID: <20161011084518.GA1691@localhost>

Chasing a regression bug upon importing shapefile to postgresql [1]
I've stumbled upon an unclear semantic of the "length" member of
QgsField class [2].

The Ogr provider, upon loading shapefiles, uses the DBF field width
_minus_one_, for reasons that are unknown to me. Upon writing a layer
to PostgreSQL, the missing _one_ results in values being too large
for the field size.

So the solution to this bug seems to be a clear definition of what
QgsField::length is supposed to be, beacuse either Ogr provider is
doing a mistake in reducing that field by 1 or PostgreSQL provider
is doing a mistake in NOT augmenting that field by 1.

Does anyone have an idea about how should QgsField::length be
interpreted ?

Isn't it related to the comma being counted in real fields?
All the best.

The bug ? Probably. QgsOgrProvider::convertField adds one byte
for the comma while QgsPostgresProvider::convertField does not

But what I'd like to know is whether or not QgsField::length
is supposed to count or not the comma (or what else is meant
to be expressing) for a QVariant::Double and for other types.

constrained numeric fields in PostgreSQL provider [1]

Arnaud: what was the reason for constraining that field ?
The semantic of QgsField's length and precision attributes
aren't fully defined and they seem not to match PostgreSQL
numeric relatives "precision" and "scale" [2]

Hm, I though that was following database semantics - at least that's what I
recall - maybe it was changed.

Not sure OGR has a general semantic of it's own, maybe it follows the data
source and those are inconsistent.

For what I know in shapes and postgres the semantics is different as the
decimal separator is considered part of the precision in one, but not the
other.

By "database semantics" you mean PostgreSQL "numeric" semantic ?
PostgreSQL numeric has "precision" and "scale", where "precision"
is total number of digits (excluding comma) and "scale" is max number
of decimal digits (right of the comma, truncated as needed).

> Not sure OGR has a general semantic of it's own, maybe it follows the data

OGR provider decrements the length by one if precision is non-zero, upon reading:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L885

And re-adds one upon writing (converting):
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L94

In both cases it does so by just looking at the presence of a non-zero
precision, regardless of datatype.

According to this:
http://devzone.advantagedatabase.com/dz/webhelp/advantage9.0/server1/dbf_field_types_and_specifications.htm

A DBF field with extended data type "double" does not affect the
precision of the stored data, and the length information is simply
ignored.

After all, a "Double" in a DBF is just 8 bytes anyway, so why bother
attempting to go beyond that ? Qgis is storing values in a Double too,
and the only reason I see to support "numeric" is storing arbitrary
precision values, which don't seem to be supported by OGR:

Hello All,

as in object, I released some day ago ( october 6 - 2016)  a new version
of  GEarthView plugin for QuantumGIS.

This 3.0.4  version  has some interesting new for many of the tens of
thousands of users who use it habitually.

The first new function permits to digitize in 3D taking measures in
GoogleEarth PRO.

The second function permits to display Extruded Buildings in GoogleEarth,
from QuantumGIS polygon elements.

The third function permits to hilite the polygon or extrusion elements
moving the cursor inside them in GoogleEarth.


Who wants test  this new version can download it from my github:

https://github.com/geodrinx/gearthview


Best Regards

Roberto

I had never seen such "double" type in use in .dbf, and it is certainly not 
handled by shapelib/OGR, and I have never seen reports that other shapefile 
producing software generate such field types. Might be a "Visual FoxPro" 
specific thing.

True, OGR ends up storing numeric fields as C double. The width/precision is 
mostly informative (and occasionnaly indeed an annoyance when backends start 
using it...)

Then I think the OGR provider should just avoid setting OFTReal fields
length/precision values, upon reading (but also upon writing, as long
as the QgsField length/precision for Double-typed fields would not be
defined).

Does it make sense ?

So what are those OFTReal types coming from ?
According to shapelib, the test shapefile field type is:

 Field shape_area is an FTDouble with width 19 and precision 11

Ok so my proposed fix for issue 15188 is simply to revert
the PR, which is the one making (mis)use of that information
while writing in the database.

From DBF 'N'umeric or 'F'loat fields :
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/shape/dbfopen.c#L1273

which are mapped to Shapelib FTDouble which is then mapped to OGR OFTReal

On reading, should be hopefully rather harmless.
On writing, looking quickly at the provider, I couldn't see where 
OGR_Fld_SetWidth()/Precision would be called with a non-zero value on a 
OFTReal field if QgsField length/precision is not set

Not if QgsField length/precision semantics have a defined meaning
of "not-to-be-used-for-Double-types". Harmless if the defined meaning
is "informative only, non-constraining". This is still an open
question.

There's a convertField function but indeed doesn't seem to be
affecting the writing to OGR output. So this bug is fully within
PostgreSQL provider making use of what should have only been
informative QgsField len/precision.

Hi devs,

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 and I can't build master:

I have no problem with master_2 and release-2_16 also build with ninja.
Any Idea ?

Hi all,
after a first bloom of interest around the improvement/rewrite of qgis
server, things seem stagnant nowadays. I suggest therefore to:
* select one or more suitable developers
* obtain an estimate
* start a crowdfunding.
Given the number of interested firms and individuals, I think it should
be easy to reach the goal.
Any objection to start soon?
All the best.

Hi,

You should start with an empty build directory. Going from an old build
directory on qt4 to qt5 doesn't seem to be possible.


I hope this helps.

Hi Paolo / Tudor, 

I agree that the QGIS server improvements should be started. But you
need a clear plan on what to do in what order. Requirements need to go
first, otherwise there is no point in selecting devs, getting
quotes/estimates and doing a crowd-funding. And probably, several devs
will be involved. 

I wonder if a QGIS server dev could provide some insight in what needs
to be done, exactly. Who has a good overview regarding open issues
around QGIS server? Probably Marco? 

As to my knowledge, the following items need to be done: 

1. The API changes/improvements need to be done first. There are two
work items pending: 

- Proposal 14 from the QGIS grants titled "Project / Map layer registry
refactoring" from Martin Dobias. Most likely, the german and swiss QGIS
user group will fund this jointly. 

- The GUI/core separation of the widgets, cleanly separate GUI and core
for form widgets. This would allow better access to display values in
QGIS expressions and better access for (Python) Developers and the QGIS
server code base. I have a quote from Matthias Kuhn for approx. 4k EUR.
If someone can fund this, please let me know. 

I am sure there are more desired API changes that are useful for QGIS
server 

2. Then there is the switch from old map renderer to the new one. See
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3129 

I don't know what other work items need to be done to get QGIS server in
good shape for QGIS 3.x? 

Lets spend some time first, to collect all the requirements before we do
any further actions. I think in this situation a QEP, describing what to
do in what order, makes a lot of sense. After that we can look into who
could do what. 

Andreas

Agreed fully. Would you like to start it?

Hi Andreas,
What you just wrote makes perfect sense.I was under the impression that gathering requirements also takes enough time that it may be hard to do it on personal time. So, I think that we should sponsor that so we can get going.
All the best!

Hi,

There a QEP about the refactoring of the server that already addresses some issues: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/74, could it fit as a starting point ?

Hi Patrick, 

Matthias Kuhn, the one who knows about this the best, is currently out
of office / on holidays. I think he is back next week. 

I would probably wait for his review. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

Hi, 

Yes - that seems a good place to do the discussions. 

Maybe the title of the QEP can be renamed to "QGIS server code
refactoring for QGIS 3.0" - or something similar. And the original
proposal about the "Server Services as plugins" could be included? 

Thanks and greetings,
Andreas

Thanks everybody for comments. I agree we should start moving ASAP, and
what we mainly need at this stage is someone taking the lead on this,
ensuring that nothing important will fall into the cracks. Andreas,
would you be available? Anybody else? If nobody, I can help.
All the best.

I think it needs a core dev familiar on the code base (specifically
server situation) to decide what needs to be done under the hood. 

I propose to ask Marco Hugentobler to take a technical lead on this,
since he started QGIS server and should be familiar with the issues.
Other devs can of course contribute. 

I can help coordinate finances or testing - but don't have enough inside
from a technical point of view.

Hi

I agree with Andreas that there is no need to hurry. It is much easier 
to plan once the Project / MapLayerRegistry redesign has been done.

The plans with server services as plugins are nice, and people can work 
at it while the Project / MapLayerRegistry refactoring is going on. It 
is however not absolutely necessary for a working QGIS Server, so no 
need to hurry here too.

Regards,
Marco

Hi guys,

with very small files (10 rows shape and 10 rows table) QGIS 2.16 crashes
randomly with both Windows (2.16.3) and Linux (2.16 compiled from source).

Someone else experienced the same problem?

Thanks

Cheers

Hi devs,

I have updated the QEP:
* the title made by David
* the list of qgis3.0_api issues
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/74

I have found 5 already opened qgis3.0_api issues link to QGIS server 
enhancement.
* QgsProject is a singleton #8
* Map Layers and QgsMapLayerRegistry #16
* QgsMapLayerRegistry is a singleton #23
* Singletons #42
* Remove QgsServerProjectParser #57

Work In Progress:
* https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3129

I'd like to know if the work on QgsProject / QgsMapLayerRegsitry has 
already started ?

And I'll investagate the QgsServerProjectParser to see which part could 
be done by QGIS core.

Regards,
René-Luc

Thanks René. Should we wait until all the pieces are defined, or should
a crowdfunding start piece by piece? I think having a general picture
first would be good, but on the other hand starting with consolidated
part of the work will possibly make the process smoother.
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi all,

I remember reading something about an expression to know if a feature is
selected or not, but can't recall where.

Is this already in master?

Can this be used for specific symbology of features in map composer?


Thanks

Hi Denis, 

It is in the "ExpressionsPlus" python plugin - for now. 

It was discussed if this could become a core feature - see thread
starting at
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-September/044855.html
 

See feature request: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15618 

Noone is assigned yet to work on it. We may probably fund Matthias to
work on it - but if you need this quicker, please go ahead and do or
fund it yourself.

Saga contains logic to translate the gui and modules, including german. See
the txt files here:
https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/code/ci/master/tree/saga-gis/src/saga_core/saga_gui/res/

Translation should not happen in QGIS but in SAGA. We could definitely look
at how the translated strings of SAGA can pop up in processing. Please
contact us at the mailing list:
https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/mailman/saga-gis-developer/ if you would
like to work on this.

Kind Regards,
Johan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server, my last improvements
Message-ID: <50f40eb3-2b51-9180-52a4-bf927f148d66@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I'm writting this email to inform you about my last QGIS Server 
improvements.

Firstly, when we fixed something in QgsMapLayerRegistry: [BUGFIX] Emit 
layerWillBeRemoved like layersWillBeRemoved (#3194) 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f6aad8bad6db72d0b1e573998ac7dcb2405dce55; 
we generated an issue in QGIS Server: Qgis Server doesnt' respect the 
styling from Desktop http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15522.

I investigated the issue 15522 and found that layersWillBeRemoved 
results in clearing vector layer join buffers. So layers in QGIS Server 
cache has empty join buffer. To fixed it, the only accessible method is 
QgsVectorLayer::readXML. But this method does not only reload joins, it 
also forces reload data and all other configuration stored in the qgis 
project. The uses of these method results it a memory leak. So the good 
solution is to add an accessor to the QgsVectorLayer::joinBuffer. 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3593

Following the advice of Nyall, I replace dynamic_cast by qobject_cast 
when it is usefull. I gained some performances with it.

I opened an other pull request about GetLegendGraphic and layer title, 
requested by a customer https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3595 And it 
needs some review
In this PR, I enhance the QGIS Server tests but a lot has to be done.

Regards,

Hi,
here in ubuntu xenial, qgis compiled from source, I can't save annotations
in QGIS in project file.

Testing that I also triggered a crash if there is an html annotation with
no file provided.

Anyone reproduces that before I fill a bug report?
Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Increasing delays when editing memory layer
	repetitively
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C57C4D93@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi,

I am working on a python plugin for QGIS where the user can interact with the data in a polygon memory layer.

When the user clicks on a position in the map, the plugin look up a feature at that position in the memory layer. If a feature was found it will be deleted and afterwards a new one will be created.

When the user repeat the click after the previous operation has finished the time it takes to perform the above delete/create part increases for each user click. Logging each step I found that the parts which takes longer are the layer.startEditing() and layer.commitChanges().

Below is the log information I collected and the relevant timings where created like this:

    log('Start editing.')
    layer.startEditing()
    log('Editing enabled.')

and

    log('Commit changes.')
    layer.commitChanges()
    log('Changes committed.')

so nothing happens before or after the two layer method calls in the above (just to clarify that it isn't some other python calls which takes up the time).

In the timings below notice that in the beginning no measurable time was used to enable and commit, but slowly it increases to seconds and then minutes (the memory layer is empty at first and then one item is added as seen in the log below):

This was done on the latest Windows 7 x64 nightly build from OSGeo4W, while the same plugin on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 doesn't show this increase in time consumption.

Can anyone give me a clue to what might be happening here?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Backport of master feature in QGIS 2.18
Message-ID: <201610131218.38249.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I'm currently working on improving geopackage support in QGIS and a first part 
of this is https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3597 (other part will be 
DBManager changes)
It has been raised that this would be worth backporting in QGIS 2.18.x, hence 
a few questions:
- this PR adds new strings to translate (the DBManager changes might also). 
Will translators do another round of translations for 2.18.x ? If not, this 
might not be material appropriate for 2.18.x
- as we are in 2.18.0 feature freeze, must I wait for 2.18.0 to be released 
before backporting (depending on previous question) ?

Message-ID: <CAGQnEC6t8J+X22otG5FwmtHpu+NmaVbLK40eKTNLz5Ombw0rbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on  a Qgis plugin that includes styles to apply on the layers
that it creates.
My problem is that I dont find the way to use plugin relative URLs on the
QML file.

I also tried another startegy using the resources.py and include the images
on the resources.py but it dont worked.

Anyone have a trick to fix this problem? There is any plugin that does this
to check how they do it?

Thank you
Xavier Barnada

Hi Xavier

This should give you the path to your plugin's installation folder:

os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

Hope this is what you need.

Message-ID: <CAJRykxPJ=P9vP4niG1Np89x+YfKEi8d8jeFD4HC+FrQKWp6Tcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Newbie qgis developer here. I would like to batch export a bunch of rasters
using the same code that's behind the "save as" option. I have found out
that it might be doable with QgsRasterFileWriter but unlike the "Save As"
GUI, this call doesn't have option to specify resolution.

Have I missed something obvious?

Thanks.

Thanks. gdal_translate doesn't have options to reproject, and for some
reasons I get more accurate results from "save as" reprojection than what I
get from gdalwarp, hence the query. I doing a 4326 to 27700 projection

Hi Sanjay

I imagine QGIS uses gdal_warp for its reprojection, and that is certainly
what I've done for rasters: gdal_warp and gdal_translate.

Thanks

Can I run only one unit test, instead of all 244?

Something like:

make test QgsSymbolLayerCreateSld

Tnx!

Something like this should work:

  ctest -R QgsSymbolLayerCreateSld

See tests/README.md, and please help improving it
(for example: can I run just a *single* test inside a test unit?)

I usually do something like this shortcircuiting ctest:

QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=output PYTHONPATH=output/python:$PYTHONPATH \
  python ../tests/src/python/test_qgsvectorfilewriter.py TestQgsVectorLayer.testOverwriteLayer

Good morning   :)


I am here to inform you that I just removed from the repository the latest
plugin version 3.0.4 of GEarthView, and also other my plugins.

I have taken this decision to draw your attention on the mechanism of the
plugin approval, which I think is totally insufficient and inadequate.

I recommend you review this procedure and pay more attention to whom is
dealing, which should be a technical, and not another.

I am sorry for the difficulties that my decision will cause to unsuspecting
users of my plugin, but they can continue to download my plugin from my
official repository on github.

I thank you for your attention


Best Regards

Roberto (geodrinx)

Hi,

Sorry y hadn't been enought specific. The problem was on the images URLs.

I fixed it with this function:

    def fix_qml_rel_urls(self, url):
        """
        Replaces the QML URLs with plugin relative URLs

        :return:
        """

        plugin_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
        with open(url, 'r') as fd:
            data = fd.read()
        f = etree.fromstring(data)
        for r in f.xpath('//qgis/renderer-v2/symbols/symbol/layer/prop[@k="
name"]'):
            val = r.get('v')
            parent = r.getparent()
            parent.remove(r)
            rel_url = os.path.join(plugin_dir, val)
            r.set('v', rel_url)
            parent.append(r)

        t = etree.tostring(f, pretty_print=True)

        tmp_url = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.qml', delete=False)

        tmp_url.write(t)
        tmp_url.close()
        return tmp_url.name

I'm sure that this don't work on all the types of symbols but perhaps is
useful for someone
After patch the style I loaded it.

Best reggards.

Hey,

Have you raised this as a issue with us. Can't really fix anything if it's
not raised.

What you suggest we do to make it better?

We all know that the mechanism is not perfect and the catalog of
plugins could be handled better, but I dont think that such a decision
on you side helps improving it.

A large (very large) part of user will never ever go to github and
install a plugin manually, which means that, for them, now QGIS has
less functionality than before. That's not a good thing.

As a plugin dev...which advantages do you have removing the plugin
form the plugin server? I can only see disadvantages.

In any case, it's good that you raised this issue, I think it's
important to improve the plugins catalog and how it's handled, so
hopefully this will start a fruitful discussion about it.

Cheers

It was already there. But there is *a lot* more on that page, making it 
hard to find.

It is in the very last bash block:

$ ctest -R appl -V

But this re-tests a failing test and gives you verbose output, isn't it?
While you received (I think) ways to deliberately test ONE test (failing
or not)?

as usual knowing the QGIS version used would have helped, anyway is
all fine on 2.16. On the other hand with 2.14 Processing won't load on
start, missing pyspatialite. So I installed it using pip, after that
Processing loads but there is indeed a crash when clicking on the tool
to download the scripts.

Sure:

if isinstance(layer.rendererV2(), QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2):
    symbol = layer.rendererV2().categories()[0].symbol()

It's here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/leafletRefactor/leafletScriptStrings.py#L376

To recreate:

1. Install the qgis2web leafletRefactor branch from Github

2. Open a point layer

3. Select a categorized renderer

4. Use an SVG marker instead of a simple marker

5. Start qgis2web

6. Click "Leaflet" to switch to Leaflet output

That triggers the error for me. Brief searching suggests something to do
with losing a reference to the canvas or ToC, or something. I'm on Win7 x64,
64-bit QGIS from OSGeo4W installer, 2.16.3 (also tried with an elderly
master2 - 0497e4a).

Any help gratefully received - I'm not experienced at debugging lower-level
issues than Python errors...

Thanks

Tom

OK, I didn't have the code which causes it quite right:

if isinstance(layer.rendererV2(), QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2): 
    symbol = layer.rendererV2().categories()[0].symbol() 
    print symbol.symbolLayerCount()

Outputs 1

However:

if isinstance(layer.rendererV2(), QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2): 
    symbol = layer.rendererV2().categories()[0].symbol() 
    print symbol.symbolLayers()

and:

if isinstance(layer.rendererV2(), QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2): 
    symbol = layer.rendererV2().categories()[0].symbol() 
    print symbol.symbolLayer(0)

both cause the RTTI error and QGIS to hang.

Well, good question.  I thank you for making me the question.

My opinion is :  There is no need to have an approval process.  What is it
for ?
Who judges the job, maybe months, another programmer, who is giving to the
community that has developed because of its usefulness ?
Maybe Richard Stallman ?   By chance Gary Sherman  ?
Probably would not do it even they.

I think right now the approval of the plugin is only a manifestation of
power.

It is nothing but this.

Imagine Wikipedia and prior approval.   It would be composed of only ten
pages.
Imagine OpenStreetMap. Only two roads.  Other than free map of the world !

Make free plugins. As long as you are on time.

There's an important difference. Neither contributing *data* to Wikipedia nor 
OpenStreetMap involves security risk for users of those databases. On the 
contrary contributing a plugin to QGIS is contributing *code* that will run 
with the privledges of the user running QGIS, so potentially thefting data / 
destroying data / installing malware / doing whatever nasty you can imagine.

Making a plugin available in the default repository is like accepting a code 
contribution to QGIS core. That involves some form of trust in the 
contributor.

Thanks Even.

Even is right. Security is the main reason that this is implemented this
way, there was loads of discussion around this when we put it in place.
Trusted authors have auto approved plugins but until that point it requires
moderation by one of the team for now until a author gets to that point.

There might be other things we can do to increase the level of security around
this but these will also increase the level of complexity to the system,
signed packages, etc. This all takes times, and effort.

I don't want to reduce the problem to a personal one, but I think that an
author, that is a programmer that reaches 171128 downloads, could be
considered trusted.

But the problem is, instead, another, and I have a curiosity:  what is the
real danger you think can happens from an open gis ?   You really have
discussed this ?    ;)
I don't think you are serious.

I have, instead a real problem you need to discuss:  You well know that
there is an important problem with SHP corruption.

True ?  I know this is true.  And also you know.

And, you know there is a "minidump" problem at exit, and randomically
during running.  And this problem is a memory problem.

True ?  You well know this is true.   Also I know that nobody knows from
what these bugs depend.

Well, I think the efforts and discussions must be used to discover these
problems, instead of plugin approvation, without any technical
preparation.  Not ?

Or, if you need a responsibility to give, let it be python and the
plugins.  But, you are out of road.  Look better in C++ source code,
expecially where memory pointers are not released, and used out of
functions.  Perhaps.

Good night

Roberto

Hi

Roberto I echo the comments from Victor and Nathan below - we are hosting executable code in the plugin repo and the approval process is only meant to protect our users and ourselves from people with malicious intent. The rationale is explained here:

http://blog.qgis.org/2016/08/26/what-are-trusted-plugins/

Note that the above article was heavily reviewed by myself and fellow members of the PSC before posting it. In my opinion we don't actually go far enough in the review process but unfortunately we don't have time and resources to do more. I think the review criteria are pretty minimal (contactable author, publicly hosted code, licensed under the GPL, not shipping binary blobs) etc. and should not prove to be a huge burden to any developer.

Could you share some specific ideas about how we could improve the process, whilst moving towards better security rather than away from it? Any reasonable and practical suggestions would be adopted without any issue I think...

Best Regards

Tim

Hi!

As a try to help QGIS project financially, I have created two designs
inspired in QGIS. You can turn those into T-shrts, hoodies, stickers, mugs,
etc... All profit from product sales will be for the QGIS project. I won't
keep any of it.

Please visit the site and, if you like it, grab some products.

www.redbubble.com/people/senhorneto/collections/567361-qgis?asc=u

I plan to add some more designs in the future.

Alexandre Neto

Hi

I meant to reference Even too in my previous comments (in terms of agreeing with his comments). See below for more inline replies:

Roberto you are well known in the community and I think we know and trust you by now :-)

I don't think it is good logic to say that we should ignore one known problem because another exists elsewhere. Rather we should address each problem as and when we can using the resources we have. Of course the things you mention above are worth fixing and the PSC makes donated funds to developers available exactly for the purpose of fixing these kind of issues. We also want to promote a plugin repository that contains code that won't remove all files from a user's hard drive or worse....

So my summary is : don't take this personally, I think the things we are asking for are not unreasonable (given that dozens of plugin developers have already complied without complaint) and generally move us towards the direction of a better experience for our users and not away from it. OK? If you are still not happy, please rather frame the discussion in terms of specific concrete actions we can take to improve the plugin approval process, and we can work towards implementing them if possible. Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi Patrick,

Making forms and relations more usable is always welcome.

What exactly are the problems you have with the current solution?
I see that you mentioned the lack of the N:1 side which is available
including add feature, add link, remove feature, remove link pretty much
the way you describe it. On [1] there is some explanation I wrote on the
first implementation.

I think you should have found that since it's shown on the screenshot
which is attached to your mail.

Also lazy loading (load when first visible) was introduced once for
performance reasons and the collapsed state of the group boxes
containing the QgsRelationEditor widget is remembered.

So I think that functionality-wise, most of it should be there already.
With a lot of air left for improvement on the usability side.

Cheers
Matthias

The -R flag takes a regex expression that you can use to filter down to one or a group of tests.

Just a note that as I recall, our plan was for 3.2 to be the next LTR (so 2.14 will probably have a 16month life as LTR).

Given how effective our post-download pop up is on the web site, I think that using our first open page to 'speak' to our users is definitely something to resurrect. It would be great to provide:

* a list of recent projects (as we have now)
* a list of recent blog articles from planet.qgis.org
* a list of current crowd funding projects and their funding progress
* a panel for us to directly send notifications to users e.g. 'QGIS 2.14.7 is out, please upgrade!'
* links for funding and sponsoring QGIS

I think it is also worth speaking to Nyall about his crowd funding experiences - last I chatted to him he had some doubts as to whether it is a really effective tool at the moment. Perhaps getting the publicity on the app opening view might fix that....

So RTTI is info about object data types at runtime? Is the print unable to
determine the symbollayer or symbollayerlist (or whatever the latter is)
type? Why? 

Obviously, my aim is not to print, but to use the data. However, the error
occurred before I used print to investigate the problem. 

Can anyone help?

This means I have my plugins auto-approvated ?   Tell me.

I think this is a crime, and it is punishable by law, so there would
be a problem
only for a simple plugin, but for any program, open source, free, and other.

So, unless we do not want to question again the world of programming, this
is a false problem, I thought was passed in open source minds.

I developed iPhone app, and one that I deeply loathed is the approval
mechanism of the app through the Apple Store. But in that case it was
justified (and history has shown this) because iPhone and smartphones in
general are becoming a kind of credit card, with all the necessary safety
precautions necessary.

But in the case of a gis, open or not, the maximum damage that a plugin can do
is produce the prints off the press sheet.
Rather, I would see the most important working upstream python environment,
and the plugin to work in a sand-safe box.

The plugin approval phase  is now only a sort of prior censorship, given
into the hand of a dark presenteeism that moves according to his personal
sympathies, with its time and its summary judgments.


That aside, let's describe what I think should happen:

1) In the upload page of the plugin should be included a clear warning that
explains what the rules (possibly in several languages).

2) Only after you have answered affirmatively to the request for acceptance
of the rules, and having filled a registry programmer, which assumes
its responsibilities
clear (thus taking away from the main program) the programmer can send the
plugin.

3) On dobrebbe servers exist an automatic procedure (antivirus, automatic
control sources to figure out harmful instructions, etc.) that warns the
existence of problems.

4) The plugin is immediately available to users, who can report in case of
malfunctions.

5) The GIS program has a python version controlled, which prevents damage to
the operating system and more.


This is what I think should be done, not to be left to the stone age.   :)


Best regards

Roberto

This is not the case at all.  You can run any code you want, there is no
limits as we have a fully functioning Python environment in order to run
plugins.
You can do damage with any programming language, ever heard of a fork bomb?

Sandboxing a Python environment is almost impossible in any good functional
way. It can be done yes, maybe, but would require a large amount of
effort to do well, a task which myself, nor any of the other team, have
time to embark on.

This is not the case at all, and please do not continue to frame it this
way. The process is there for a reason, and it is **not** for censorship.

Here are some things you might be asked for before approval:

- Do you have a good description?
- Do you have a link to the plugin source? (required under GPL although you
will get it anyway when you pull the plugin in QGIS)
- Do you fit into GPL - e.g you can't upload a plugin that uses a closed
source component**
- Yes you may be asked to review a licence files for included packages if
you bundle them
- If you plugin is a fork of another plugin would you considering merging
with original.  This is to reduce the number of plugins that do the same
thing.
- etc etc

This might feel like censorship to some however I can 100% assure you
again, this is never the intent nor reason.  This is simply a review
process, or
attempt at one to possibly flag issues up front.  A lot of us already deal
at this level when working on core code.

QGIS has a increasing user base every year, this comes with some risks and
processes that need to be in place.  QGIS isn't simply a small project
used by a few people with no one caring about user experience or pain.
Processes we put in place will not always be liked by everyone, but you
should
never assume there is evil intent behind it because there never is.

This is what I think should be done, not to be left to the stone age.   :


That is all fine however we all are generally pretty busy with other
development or day jobs. A lot of things you would like to see simply can
not be wished into existence.

This is not really true. A plugin can do anything that OS allows the
logged in user to do. So we are talking about executing arbitrary
shell commands, doing arbitrary communication at its will (sending
spam maybe - or just sending some private documents from home folder),
or even use some known exploits to gain admin rights (especially on
windows) and install some malware for spying or ransomware...

The fact that plugins go through some review process is making QGIS
plugins a less attractive platform for spreading some bad code.

Sandboxing python environment in a way where it would be safe to run
any code is very difficult task - and it would negatively impact all
plugins by greatly limiting what they actually can do. I do not think
we have enough resources and skills to undertake such implementation
challenge.

This was the first option we looked in to. Do you know of some good tools for detecting malicious code in python? It is a hard problem to solve and simple things like preventing shell calls are not productive or effective. In the end we decided to take a social approach to peer review (which is a completely different thing to censorship). By the way I am not averse to some limited censorship of plugins if they go against our code of conduct [1] and diversity statement [2] for example, I would support banning them. I think any reasonable community would expect that of us....

[2] https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/diversitystatement.html


A case in point might be a plugin aimed at belittling a particular ethnic group or gender identification or which otherwise promotes intolerance. Thankfully such a situation has never arisen. Our friendly non-combative community is something that makes the QGIS community a joy to participate in. Lets try to keep that in mind whilst having this discussion too and focus on practical, achievable solutions if you have concerns.

My best regards

I wondered about the same recently for GDAL since I've introduced the 
possibility to write pixel functions in Python in a VRT file ( 
http://gdal.org/gdal_vrttut.html#gdal_vrttut_derived_python ) and wanted to 
have a way to know if they were safe enough or not to be executed by default. 
Sean Gillies pointed to me the following :
"""I found http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html
to be a good intro to the risks of eval'ing untrusted Python code.
Mentioned in there is a notable attempt to make a secure subset of Python
called "pysandbox", but its developer has since declared it "broken by
design": https://lwn.net/Articles/574215/."""
So the conclusion is that sandboxing Python is not believed to be possible, at 
least with the traditionnal CPython interpreter. It appears that PyPy has some 
sandboxing mechanism ( http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/sandbox.html ) although 
that would probably very tricky to use in the QGIS context (not to mention the 
changes required to use PyPy!). You cannot even trust calls to the native C++ 
QGIS API to be safe in themselves. I'm pretty sure they could be abused to do 
evil things.

Another thing to remember is the recent attempts at spamming OSGeo Trac 
instances. Opening the plugin catalog without control would lead to all sort 
of abuses.

Well.  You convinced me.

I have a question. It is possible to deploy a QGIS plugin providing
only compiled
files through an external repository, which is added to the repository list? It
is absolutely not my case, but I know that someone is doing it.
It is normal or license is violated ?

Thank you for any info about this.

QGIS plugins must me lisenced as GPL, because the depend on QGIS and GPL is
viral.
Anyway distributing only .pyc is not advisible, because they assume the
same interpreter and the same execution environment that compiled the .pyc
bytecode.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Development Collaboration
Message-ID: <1476642809086-5290907.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

Over the past couple years I have been working solo on a groundwater
modeling Q-GIS add-on.

This toolset has had somewhat successful usage in a introductory university
course.  The next goal is to make it available to the greater Q-GIS and
Hydrogeologist communities.  

Full disclosure; I am a entry-level researcher with limited programming
background.  Therefore, before making this plugin publicly available I
strongly advocate improving the function and usability.  This motivates a
request to the Q-GIS developer community;

Does anyone have any advice on finding collaborator(s) to improve the coding
behind a sophisticated Q-GIS plugin/add-on?  

Thanks for considering,
-Joe M.K.

I'm not aware of QGIS plugins distributing only .pyc files. In any case I
can ask the plugin developer to provide the source code.
The same apply to QGIS itself: the binary distributions don't have the
source code bundled, but I can view and get it from the public repo.

Hi,

I'd like to add that it's during the discussions about the "trusted" plugin
system that I understood that there were some plugin authors that could
publish their own plugin without having it reviewed by someone (Paolo,
Ale....)
The (only) two times I tried to publish a plugin (before the trusted
system), once uploaded, I had to wait for some days before someone finds
time to review and publish it in the repository. And this didn't bother me.
I understood  the situation. And I'm sure I'm not the only one in that
case. I even think it's the process for most of us. So not all plugins
authors could directly publish their plugins.

What was probably unfair is the rules (or should I say, the lack of rules)
against which some authors could easily publish their own plugins, without
review process. why not me, would I say! Now, with the new system, there's
a kind of rules that explain why one could do it himself and why another
one may wait for review. You could not agree with the rules, it's open to
discussion and ideas for improvements are welcome. But at least, there are
rules!

And by experience (even a small one), you wouldn't have to wait too loooong
for your plugin being approved. Users are patient, why not devs? And
hopefully, having a period of reviewing will reduce some numerous releases
of the same plugin within a short period (more tests from the author before
upload).

Regards,
Harrissou

my suggestion would be to publish it as Experimental, so more people can
test it and give suggestion. If someone finds it useful, it will be
easier to ask for some help. Without releasing the code everything is
floating on air.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhuKTGb=eR9heP6K6MWE+Pi3bEFhvKOpc2UQPiBR7jBOXw@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,


somebody has experience with sandboxing ?

This is an urgence of our program.  An important competition for software
provision to public authority is ongoing, and a request is the sw
reliability.

So,  who of us knows how to armour python ?   The current approval mechanism
is not sufficient to support the specific stringent requests of that
contest.

anyone knows and have experimented how to use  pypy.org  and its sandboxing
?


Regards

Roberto

The original welcome page had that but it wasn't well received, so I
removed it again in

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/95c377a607757b4cc9d03a6e399b5516d0b44dcd

> * a list of current crowd funding projects and their funding progress

That's already in place. Information is read from
https://ubuntu.qgis.org/version.txt

It could be improved to fetch different files based on LTR/Non-LTR.

> * links for funding and sponsoring QGIS

In general I am in favor of adding all this to the welcome page. It can
be used to unobtrusively raise awareness and it's easy to disable if
some people don't like it.

I am referring to this:

Someone has experimented it with QGIS ?   In case, can we share our efforts
around it ?

Qgis uses CPython. You also have to sandbox Qt, so I suspect you are
running into a lot of dead ends.

As we have said before, this is a ton of effort and you will not gain what
you want from it.

Microsoft had to write a whole new .net framework just to handle this.

Hi Tom,

RTTI is some low-level C++ functionality to determine an objects type
(roughly equivalent to `type(myobject)` in python). It can be enabled
and disabled during compilation. Apparently it was disabled on your QGIS
build.

The bad news: QGIS uses this information to determine which type of
symbollayer is in use.

The good news: This can be fixed, I've just fixed it in master [1].
Please let me know if you need this backported and where to (so you can
test).

Matthias

Wouldn't that cause a ton of other errors though? It's used pretty
heavily all throughout QGIS, and there's many other sip classes
relying on it...

Thank you for the suggestion.  We will see who is moving in dead ends.   :)

I am the crow's nest of the ship and I am experiencing the arrival of the
iceberg.
And I hear the orchestra playing :)


Best regards and wishes for a safe journey.   ;)

I had the same thoughts. And no final explanation.

Maybe it's something related to how sip bindings are compiled that they
have no access to RTTI. Plus I think it should be enabled on most
systems so issues don't surface too often.

But I think removing RTTI dependency where issues surface cannot hurt
(apart from some performance impacts due to string comparison here but I
guess this code here shouldn't be used so heavily that this will ever
make something feel slow.)

Just my experience (since you mention Stallman): when I offered my SINS
videogame [1] to the GNU project, it was rejected because another similar
game existed already in the offering, so my project would have been
a duplicate.

SINS is still available, just not part of the GNU project.

It happens to me that QGIS desktop application also allows using
external repositories, so users can choose who to trust.

I won't comment about the rules for acceptance of plugins in the
"official" repo as I don't know them.

Or it's simply a bogus pointer that doesn't point at anything with RTTI

I am just working on it, without any QEP.   What it means "QEP" ?    ;)
It remembers me the sound of a cartoon...

But, if somebody wants to work serioulsly on this issue, it is sufficient
contact me.

True. The samples from Tom didn't look like this to me. Or is this some
variant of bug #777?

Honestly, this is getting tiresome.

If you don't like the approval processes that we have in place currently
you can create a new plugin repo, it's just an XML file exposed via
webserver, there are docs around for it.

You can give this URL to people and they can install your plugins via that.

If you don't want to do that, then you will have to go through the approval
process.  I'm sure there are reasons it took longer than normal, maybe
review those first.

If you want to follow the sandboxed Python route and see how far you get
fine, however again I suspect you are in for a long road given the complex
nature of that and you would still have to
be able to support what we can in core, etc.

I've always though RFC would have been better, but for some reason

I think a public live specification document is more inclusive than

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QRap plugin: Mouse Click not capture
Message-ID: <5804B03102000056004AAC52@gwise.up.ac.za>

Good day,

I am the sole developer left on the development of the QRap plugin (www.QRap.org.za / https://sourceforge.net/projects/qrap/ ). As this is not even my main focus, I tent not to update so often as only sync with LTR versions. 

Until QGis 2.8 the mouse clicked worked fine, but when I updated to 2.14 it no longer worked. Attached is the MouseEvent code I use. I originally had it inherit from QqsMapTool and then from QgsMapToolEmitPoint ... both works on QGis 2.8, but neither on 2.14.   I tried using QgsMapToolEmitPoint directly but it said 
QgsMapToolEmitPoint::canvasClicked(QgsPoint&,Qt::MouseButton) does not exist when I run it ... it does not both in 2.8 and 2.14. 

I can confirm that MapCanvas()->SetMapTool run sucessfully  (I caught the mapToolSet signal ... )

Does any of you with years of experience perhaps have a pointer that would help me resolve it. 

Kind Regards
Magdaleen Ballot

PS: Why is QRap not in the QGis repository ... because it is huge, and I still want to get rid of Poco (which is used for XML parsing and replace it with a Qt component)

For context from here: https://lwn.net/Articles/574215/

"I now agree that putting a sandbox in CPython is the wrong design. There
are too many ways to escape the untrusted namespace using the various
introspection features of the Python language. To guarantee the [safety] of
a security product, the code should be [carefully] audited and the code to
review must be as small as possible. Using pysandbox, the "code" is the
whole Python core which is a really huge code base. For example, the Python
and Objects directories of Python 3.4 contain more than 126,000 lines of C
code.

The security of pysandbox is the security of its weakest part. A single bug
is enough to escape the whole sandbox."

Sandro,

Have a read of the links that Even posted.  They don't really side in
favour with the idea of sandboxing Python, and that was just plain
python not including PyQt4, etc,

Brilliant - many thanks. I'd argue for a backport to LTR. I claim
compatibility back to 2.8, but I'm perfectly happy to drop that, and say the
plugin is only compatible with LTR+. But I'll also try the dev nightly
(although it occurs to me that I need to ask about dev nightlies now we have
master and master2).

That was my thought. I've certainly never come across the error before, and
since the plugin basically queries the hell out of symbol layers, I do find
it a little hard to believe that the cause could be such a widespread issue.

I'll have a dig around in the code, and see if I can find a counterexample.
I certainly use renderer.symbolLayer(n) elsewhere.

Indeed also PostgreSQL dropped the "trusted" version of plpython
as of version 7.4 because of lack of sandboxing support upstream:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/plpython.html
""
As of PostgreSQL 7.4, PL/Python is only available as an "untrusted"
language, meaning it does not offer any way of restricting what users
can do in it. It has therefore been renamed to plpythonu. The trusted
variant plpython might become available again in future, if a new
secure execution mechanism is developed in Python.
""

But I like to be supportive with whoever wants to change the world :)

Yes, I have made a few fixes lately, and they are in master_2. I have
to spend sometime now porting them to master and 2.14 if they apply

Don't worry, i will take care of that later today

Hi all,

I like the *idea* of sandboxing.

And we all know and agree it's a complex topic. Hard to impossible to
get right (let's admit also that security is always something gray and
not black and white - unless the network plug is removed and the room
isolated with tin foil). This on the other hand doesn't mean that there
are some approaches which are just wrong by design.

There is also the question about the level on which sandboxing should
happen. E.g. distributing the app with flatpak and relying on its portal
mechanism [1] might at one point in the future be a way to get sandboxing.

One can also run the app inside some other virtualized environment or
even separate physical machine already now for isolation.

Maybe Pypy is a way to get there as well from the python side. I don't
know. But Nathan is absolutely right that the API offered by Qt builds a
big attack surface for which someone has to first bring up a sensible
idea for how to lock attackers down without restricting possibilities
offered for plugins. Or how to safely decide if running code from
external shared libs like the processing lwgeom provider does [2] is
something safe to do or not.

If someone seriously wants to follow this route:

Be prepared to work with specialists in this area and do serious
research about possibilities and feasibility first.

Be prepared to maintain a separate distribution of QGIS with restricted
python access and reduced plugin functionality.

Be prepared to get a very big sponsor to back the effort.

Correct.  In fact I am talking about this other:

pypy.org  and its sandboxing, that is:
http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/sandbox.html?highlight=Sandboxing

that reports the interesting issues you can have with other solutions, as CPython, for example. 
Do you have read it ?  If not, good reading  :)

Ok, I will try to be more clear (compatibly with my bad English).

Look at this:  https://goo.gl/WR8LVF

In this project, since now, they (public administration) are using QGIS.
But, they have today BIG PROBLEMS with crashes.

In the next version of the system, the NEED to have a secure program (and
possibly open source).

QGIS now is NOT secure.     I explained enough  ?
Now you understand what's at stake?


I hope so.    Now somebody wants to see with me how to make sure QGIS decently
?

Thank you

Geo

Yes I have read it, however we don't run on PyPy, we use CPython.

I'll just throw this up here for reference:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mapinfo-l/ugLeZ9zgyJg/7Bu5-NFozxMJ

That's not even loading python code, just loading a TAB data file into
the program! ;)

Are you saying that since QGIS is not secure nobody should bother
checking contributed plugins for being non-malicious and provide
non-duplicated features ?

So for you,  there is no chance to implement a good python sandbox in QGIS,
at least in the short term ?

Okay, well good to know.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ogrLayerName in processing/tools/vector.py
Message-ID: <20161017112904.GA27422@localhost>

Victor,

following a recent comment on a fix to ogrLayerName [1] I'm wondering
what the exact semantic of ogrLayerName should be, as it's not
documented anywhere. Should it accept any kind of "uri" from any
layer provider or only those from the OGR provider ?

[1] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/6c5364186dd8d45ac51e5bd1a72c6a542f032cb1#commitcomment-19439676

My fix was assuming we were talking about an OGR provider URI, thus
extracting the name from a layer instance constructed via the OGR provider
using the given URI, but the user comment suggests it is not only used
in that way ?

My two cents:

Personally I see this whole sandbox thing as being more suitable for the
application as a whole and not specifically for the python plugins part. As
such, it seems to me that sandboxing would be a job better suited for the
OS that is running apps, and not for the apps themselves. This is what is
happening on mobile apps, and is also the direction new distribution
formats for linux such as snaps and flatpak are heading.

I'd be bummed if, as a plugin author, I'd be able to do less stuff with a
machine's resources than the core QGIS code. I mean the great thing about
QGIS' plugins is that you can use Python + QT + QGIS API in order to do
magical stuff. If all of a sudden plugins cannot access the filesystem, or
do web requests or access some sensor's output while core QGIS can still do
those things it would be less attractive to write plugins and to use QGIS
as a general GIS platform.

On a more practical note, sandboxing just for the Python side seems like a
ton of work in an area that is not related to the core QGIS mission and
that requires highly specialized talent.

There's a big team constantly working on making QGIS better and crash less.

Part of the effort comes from sponsoring the QGIS project, part from
sponsoring individual devs to fix on specific issues, part from
individuals getting time from their employer to work on issues and part
from volunteers spending their free time to improve QGIS.

I would recommend you sit down with these people, define the problems,
write specifications and work out how the individual items can be
addressed. If you want, there's a whole bunch of companies who will be
happy to support you [1]

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBiB4mEnCi00yNqZVDp-vK6nE+6SYXUn+Q7uZUmcL9NLrw@mail.gmail.com>

At present, this is not so simple due to recent changes in gdal, but also
to changes made to support duplicate layer-names only layerid is being used.

For QGIS compiled against gdal 1.*
using: |layerid=n|layername=somename

should be used and in most cases work correctly.

At the moment an attempt to to open with 'layername' will first be
attempted (without checks for duplicate names, thus the first will be
taken) and if that fails, to open with layerid.

When gdal 2.* is being used, retrieving with layerid will fail after the
first table that has more than 1 geometry.

The goal of the Grant Programme '9)​  Correction of QgsOgrProvider
implementaion of GDAL 2.0' was to resolve this problem.

My 2ct:

I still find it strange that we are allowed to try to retrieve
version.txt without notice, given some time ago when we had the idea to
do an anonymous ping-back to have a clue about users/downloads, and we
were heavily criticized for that idea...
Myself I already had some practical problems with the version.txt. In a
school/organisation which is not 'able' to upgrade, you every time see
the message: "You can upgrade!..." but they can't and shouldn't...
Another issue I saw when you start up a centrally installed QGIS as new
user you get an error because QGIS tries to retrieve version.txt but is
not able because there is not proxy defined yet...

To make myself even more clear: I'm in favor for both
- QGIS pinging back (and give us some anonymous info about OS,
installer, use, version, userhash etc)
- the use of news feeds like Mathias proposes (but please let it be rst
and easily translatable)

But ONLY after(!) a clear 'YES' by the user, in which he/she gives a
fiat for sending and receiving such info... I think the average QGIS
user is OK with it if we make it clear enough that for the project it is
important to have insight in such info.

I would favor opt-in and not opt-out.

Regards,

Richard

+1 for always opt-in, and also a good way to back to opt-out if you opt-in
by mistake.

Hi Mark,
maybe my question wasn't clear so I'll re-phrase it:

What syntax for the "uri" parameter passed to ogrLayerName
should be supported ? Is it correct to assume "any URI understood
by the OGR provider" ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building and debugging QGIS on Windows x64
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C57C53C8@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi

I'm trying to build QGIS on Windows 7 (x64) using the the steps provided in [1] with small adjustments from [2]. My objective is to be able to build a QGIS instance so that I can debug and understand the calls made to QGIS from my python plugins. In other words, I am not trying to build my own installer with a custom QGIS build - just debugging the standard QGIS application.

I have installed on my plain and clean Windows 7 x64 machine:

    VS2010 C++ Express
    Microsoft SDK (from ISO file)
    Cygwin64: Bison, Flex
    Osgeo4W64: A lot of packages
    CMAKE 3.0.2 x86

I am not sure if I need to build everything and if I need to build either "debug" or "RelWithDebInfo" in my case when I just need to debug calls made from Python to the QGIS application?

Currently I'm trying to just build "qgis" (1 of 334 projects listed in my Solution Explorer) using the "debug" setup. Do note that my knowledge in C++ is very limited.

I'm currently stuck in Visual Studio 2010 C++ Express with a lot of linking errors apparently related to spatialite and I would really like a hint or two on how to get by this obstacle:

Sorry, I misread the request.

In this case, if I have now understood correctly, you are opening the
source before retrieving the layer.

That would then be everything up to the first '|'.

For a file-base source the full-filename with path.

For a Database-System such as PostGis the Connection-String to connect to
the Database (with user/password-information).

---

After the connection has been made use GetName or GetLayer as needed from
the information supplied after the first '|' to retrieve the layer.

When the Layer-Name is unique, GetName should be used
- for drivers such as GML and KML, where the Layer-Name may not be unique,
Getlayer should be used

Hi All,


I've been studying ogrLayerName and GDAL/OGR algorithms in recent days. I
understand ogrLayerName expects a URI from QGIS layers.

One valid QGIS layer URI might be (talking about Spatialite layers):

'dbname=\'/tmp/test.sqlite\' table="test" (geometry) sql='

The PR you merged [1] made it impossible to run an OGR algorithm with a
Spatialite layer with such URI. Hence my comment to the corresponding
commit.

I'm working on another PR [2] at the moment that also deals with
ogrLayerName, so I've tested your version of ogrLayerName and adjusted it.
Now it can handle the aforementioned Spatialite layer. This is how
ogrLayerName looks right now in my local repo (that I'll be pushing into my
PR):

https://gist.github.com/gacarrillor/233567ca4b407bfd4e92ca66c0fe01df


Regards,

Germán

Hi,

Even, I think your message also question the strategy followed for
translation: one version at time and as soon as a version is released,
let's focus on the next one. I'm refering to Transifex, of course, which is
the default and most encouraged interface for translation.
This means that normally, once 2.18.0 is released, strings available in
Transifex wil focus on the next release (master_2? master?). Translators
are no longer able to translate QGIS 2.18 strings from Transifex web
interface. The only step I'm aware of and that could ensure a kind of
translation for new strings is that translators individually pull texts
from source, translate them and make PR against 2.18 branch. Something that
few people will likely do.

@devs after qgis 2.18 is released, will the master_2 branch kept? For a
2.20 version? If no master_2 and thus 2.20 is expected, maybe we could keep
Transifex focus on what would be the 2.18 branch and people will easily
continue translating. And maybe at some stage (when 3.0 release schedule is
more clear), we'll push master branch into Transifex and people begin
translating 3.0 release...

Unless there's a way to have two branches being translated at the same time?

That said, if compatible, I'd prefer to have a feature backported, even
with some parts in english (actually, there are 14 on 40 activated
languages that have more than 90% translated - people can still find web
translators if needed) rather than no feature.

my 2cts,
Harrissou

He René-Luc

does it help if you #include <math.h> in src/gui/qgsscalerangewidget.cpp?

Hi Matthias,

It does not help me if I add #include <math.h> in 
src/gui/qgsscalerangewidget.cpp

Hmmm...

What about replacing isinf with qIsInf? (and if required #include "qgis.h")?

Consult package-nightly.cmd or package-nightly.cmd.   There you'll find that is
set to spatialite_i.lib and not spatialite.lib

loaded up QGIS 2.14 ‘Essen’ got all psyched to dive in and do a plugin, and seem to be hitting a brick wall…

From what I understand, you must use PyQt4, unless you compile EVERYTHING from source with Qt5 …

soo… thought I would just use an older Qt version… WRONG !  the installer says it is incompatible with this version of OS X ..

so… thought I would compile the Qt4 sources from scratch … WRONG!  as per:

so…. um …. am I outta luck?

Transifex is already target for QGIS3 (as it sticked with master).  For
master_2, we talked about returning to the old scheme (ie.
scripts/update_ts_files.sh and committing language update individual).

When we decided on the time frame for 2.18 in Bonn, we also decided that you
can add your geopackage improvements into 2.18.1 and I can add DWG support once
it ready - regardless of the feature freeze that normally applies to releases.
IMHO it shouldn't be applied now before 2.18 is released.

Are you using my package or trying to compile from source?

My package has everything needed in the app - Qt4 & PyQt4.

QGIS 2 is not completely ready for Qt5, so yes you need to use Qt4.  Does the Qt4 installer refuse to install on your system, or just give a warning?  I've never heard of it refusing to install.  It should still work as long as you use a system SDK.  I compile QGIS on Yosemite, but using an old Mt Lion SDK.

Hi Casper

I have recently build QGIS on my Windows10 system with Visual Studio 2010
with partial success. I could run and debug QGIS, but Python support did not
work (yet).
This is my shortlist of fixes to get my build working:

add libs to qgis_core:
setupapi.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\lwgeom.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\libxml2.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\freexl_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\iconv.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\zlib.lib
legacy_stdio_definitions.lib

add libs to virtuallayerprovider:
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\lwgeom.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\libxml2.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\freexl_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\iconv.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\zlib.lib

qgis_core
Ignore specific default libraries: LIBCMT.lib

remainder not found: define in gmath.c
double remainder(double X, double Y) { return fmod(X, Y); }

compile with /bigobj:
python_module_qgis__gui.vcxproj
python_module_qgis__core.vcxproj

spatialite.lib does not include the 5 libs from OSGeo4W64, so I added them.
The DLL which gets included  with spatialite_i.lib has those libs onboard,
so Jürgen's advice is probably better.
The other changes will manifest themselves as the compiler and linker start
to complain!
Each time, you update the source from the remote master, the changes have to
be performed again!
BTW, are you building master_2? The master depends now on Qt5 and Python3
and the build instructions are not targeted for that. I am now in the
process of building the master with Visual Studio 2015, where I have to
build some libraries myself from source.

Let me know if I can help.

Frits

Thanks Matthias,

it works!

can I push this bugfix and backport it ? Or do I have to create a PR ?

Of *any* provider, right ? And there's no way to know the provider
name from the URI. I think such interface is too fragile and should
be changed ASAP, don't you think ?

I fixed that with a subsequent commit:

Please rebase your PR to take that into account.

What do you mean by "opening the source" and "retrieving the layer" ?
They sound like the same operation to me ?

 In the Python code you are using the OGR Interface

ds = ogr.Open(ogruri)

in c++ (as used in QgsOgrProvider) this corresponds to:

OGRDataSourceH hDS = OGROpen( pszPath, bUpdate, &hDriver );

it will only open the Datasource for use.

OGR will read the datasource and create the infastructure needed during
reading
- such as a list of layers
-- in gdal 1.* each geometry is 1 layer (with only 1 geometry-field)
-- in gdal 2.* each table is 1 layer that may contain more than 1
geometry-field

At this point you can decide what to do
- list the layers and the fields
- select a specific layer with a geometry-field

Either with the layer-id:
python:
ly = ds.GetLayer(layerid)

in c++ (as used in QgsOgrProvider) this corresponds to:
ogrLayer = OGR_DS_GetLayer( ogrDataSource, iLayerIndex );

or with the layer-name
ogrLayer = OGR_DS_GetLayerByName( ogrDataSource, TO8( sLayerName ) );

when all tasks are completed, the Datasource is closed.

Inside QgsOgrProvider all of this is done as needed, but when using the
OGR-API directly each step must be done manually.

This is done in multi-step already, is it not ?
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/dc5abfed892c0e8d8eac0e016dc5ee37e7725632/python/plugins/processing/tools/vector.py#L573-L579

The problem, as Germán found out, is that the URI passed as parameter
is not necessarely an OGR provider URI, but a generic QGIS uri, from
any provider, so it cannot always be opened via ogr.Open.

In ogrConnectionString there seem to be an attempt to fetch the actual
layer from the uri, but doesn't seem to work always.

I've pushed a further tweak to the ogrLayerName function so to have
it properly documented AND correctly handle PostgreSQL provider URIs

@Jürgen, are you sure about that?
Looking at the metadata of this new string in Transifex (
https://www.transifex.com/qgis/QGIS/translate/#fr/qgis-application/96618210
- sorry, it may not be visible to all), it appears that its source is
../src/ui/qgslabelingguibase.ui:4009

While https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master_2/src/ui/
qgslabelingguibase.ui#L4009 leads to the same strings,
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/ui/qgslabelingguibase.ui#L4009
doesn't.

As stated above, I don't know if this decision is effective but I'm not
sure translators were informed about it. Afaics, I didn't see such
information and believed that (if my previous assumptions are false) I was
translating the next release (2.18) in Transifex and not the one after. And
unfortunately I may not be alone.

Harrissou

Yes, ogr-sysntax must be used.



# -- Spatialite provider

# dbname='/tmp/x.sqlite' table="t" (geometry) sql='


would need to call 'GetLayerByName'

Here again there is a problem between gdal 1.* and gdal 2.*

Where there is a table with more than 1 geometry the syntax
 'tablename(fieldname)' can be used

In gdal 2.* that syntax can also be used with a table with only 1 geometry
- but not in gdal 1.*: there only the tablename can be used

sLayername="t(geometry)"; // ok for gdal 2.* or gdal 1.* with > 1 geometry
sLayername="t"; // ok for gdal 2.* or gdal 1.* with 1 geometry

ogrLayer = OGR_DS_GetLayerByName( ogrDataSource, TO8( sLayerName ) );

This should work for both PostgreSQL and spatialite based on your samples.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add scripts from file Processing
Message-ID: <7f18552e-928e-5beb-aa65-a74bb323c806@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm trying to duplicate the "Add script from file" in Processing also
for R algorithms.

I'm struggling with an error that happens both with "my" code but also
with the default "Add script from file" method.

When you click the "Add script from file" menu a dialog opens and you
can browse for the scripts. Here the problem, if you click both on OK
and Cancel the following error appears:



An error has occurred while executing Python code:

ValueError: need more than 0 values to unpack
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/matteo/.qgis2/python/plugins/processing/gui/ProcessingToolbox.py",
line 276, in executeAlgorithm
    action.execute()
  File
"/home/matteo/.qgis2/python/plugins/processing/script/AddScriptFromFileAction.py",
line 57, in execute
    self.tr('Script files (*.py *.PY)', 'AddScriptFromFileAction'))
ValueError: need more than 0 values to unpack




Obviously I get the same error for my code because I took that code as
template.

I cannot fix it, someone has an idea?


Thanks

Matteo

But the above is NOT an ogrDataSource
Please see with current master_2 branch if the test work for you
with both GDAL 1 and GDAL 2:

Running the automated test is done via:

  ctest -V -R ProcessingToolsTest

Manual tests imply importing layers to postgis (via processing).

They pass here with GDAL 2

Sandro,

Mark's point is for the particular case of layers with multiple geometry fields 
(as may be found in some spatialite DB for example). That's a different issue 
than the one you tackle.

yes, but you are using the OGR-API directly
- so you must use the OGR-Syntax

i.e. you must 'translate' the syntax used in QgsSpatiaLiteProvider to
something OGR will understand.

As someone who approved the migration of our public-sector organization from
proprietary desktop GIS to QGIS, I would draw a distinction between
*security* and *stability* - just because there is a crash does not mean you
necessarily have compromised security.

Plus, at the end of the day, my limited experience (mostly by proxy) of
proprietary GIS is that the big players also crash.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [processing] OGR imports full of "None" strings,
	lately
Message-ID: <20161018102905.GB28803@localhost>

I've noticed lots of "None" strings in the ogr2ogr call from master_2
branch onward and it looks like what you get from unicode(None) in
python.

The code checks for parameter values's length being > 0 before adding
params to ogr2ogr call but all the empty param are now real "None"
strings (due to unicode call).

This doesn't seem happen in 2.16 branch.

Victor: something to mass-clean ?

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7y2CmqL5V2dUmXY+brJQAPp53dvTx3UgFYBmJS8ufFNdQ@mail.gmail.com>

I made a fix to the check that verifies if a string parameter is left
blank or not. Before, it just checked that it was None, so empty
strings where considered valid values. However, an empty string should
be considered a null one (mainly, to raise an exception if that is
used for a parameter that is not optional). Before that, an empty
string was accepted even if the parameter was mandatory.

looks like ogr algorithms use unicode(getParameterValue()), and they
should instead get the param value and check whether is None or not.

Actually, there is no need to cast it to str or unicode, the value is
already a string. So it looks like ogr algorithms have to be modified
to adapat to this.

A simpler solution is that now, when a null value is passed (None,
empty string, anything that evaluates to false...), it sets the value
of the parameter as None. It could set it to an empty string, so no
need to do any change. Not such a clean solution, but it will work.

Any thoughts on that?

But I trust you if you say 2.18 is not being translated in Transifex.
Could be nice to announce the interim steps of 2.18 translation in the
translators/community(?) list.

It sounds like having getParamaterValue() always return a string
(possibly empty) would reduce regression probabilities.

Or do you think it's important to distinguish between empty string
and None ?

sounds safe to me. And it would be nicer to make that distinction, but
i think it is not so important. I cannot think of any major issue with

Note that I see more than Ogr algortihms using the unicode(getParam())
construct:

  git grep  'unicode(self.getParameterValue' python/plugins/

As long as unicode(None) returns u'None', all those calls are bound
to fail if getParametervalue can possibly return None.

I agree it would be cleaner to drop the unicode() wrapper while making
sure len(val) is avoided. Not sure about the testcase coverage that
would help with such a big change.

Sorry, but I often have problems with python ...

Are you supposed to configure something beforehand?
This is what I get:

Didn't you use "ctest" ?

I think ctest would do that automatically but  you have to tweak
PYTHONPATH to include ${BUILDDIR}/output/python/plugins.
Make sure to build the code, and that you're using latest tree
in release-2_16 branch.

Hi Paolo, 

hm - not sure. 

If you have a .pgpass file it may take credentials from the .pgpass
file. 

Not sure what you mean "from the system" - you mean the credentials from
the operating system? Yes - this is another fallback mechanism - but it
depends how you configured your PostgreSQL access controls. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Yes, the first list of errors was from that


> PYTHONPATH to include ${BUILDDIR}/output/python/plugins.

Have done that and now am building the latest branch


> using latest tree
> in release-2_16 branch

Before you wrote branch 'master_2'
- that is what I checked out after committing my 'master' (where the need
changes for gdal 2.* have been made - was a September version of release-2_16
branch) and am now building.

2 weeks ago I found:
test_provider_ogr_sqlite.py

where I was planning to add some tests.

Since the original version is now compiling against gdal 2.*, I will
attempt to write a test that when running against gdal 1.* should cause a
'symbol lookup error'.

Also to test the ogr autotest database 'spatialite_8_2' which contains more
than 1 geometry in the main table
- which for the present code should fail.

The 3rd test was to test if the kml file sent for bugreport 15168
(non-unique layer-name) can be read correctly.

Well, I tried and SURPRISE ! The parameter is actually *set*
to the "None" string. So I guess the bug is also on the *set* side,
not (just) *get* one.

Also, a quick review of the set side (setValue functions) reveal that
the value of parameters don't necessarely need to be strings ?

It looks like reverting 61a10df45283a47782bf49ac62f9c5e5f9b27b21
removes all those "None" literals.

Hi Andreas,
thanks for the feedback. The situation is:
* a qgs project pointing to PostgreSQL, without username and password
* if one inserts the credentials at project startup, these seem to be
remembered upon further opening of the project (unsure about other
projects), even after restarting QGIS.
It seems therefore impossible that QGIS takes it from .pgpass.
All the best.

Hi All,

what would be the way to deal with this?
It's currently preventing me from pushing my final commit to this PR [1],
which I hope can make it into QGIS v.2.18.

Regards,

Germán

German, I think the best way would be to:

 1) File a ticket, targetted at 2.18 and marked as Sever/Regression
 2) Make a PR containing an automated testcase showing the problem
 3) Add a revert of the offending commit in the PR, showing how
    it fixes the testcase.

Do you agree, Victor ?

Let me know if we need to do something else.

I still think a testcase would be very useful.
Besides, there seem to be tests checking for "None" (string)
being returned by setting None (type) in 

 python/plugins/processing/tests/ParametersTest.py

Should they be updated ?

Entered passwords are cached for the session - but not stored in the layers.

Thanks Jürgen for the clarification. You mean the OS session, not the
QGIS one, right? Is this documented in the manual?

Something else that is able to cache passwords persistently is the auth
system

Yes, but this has to be done explicitly, the base mechanism is
transparent (and may be surprising) to the user.

Ah, the Designer part is now a problem.

You could try using Pacifist to manually extract the needed parts from the Qt installer, 4.8 still uses Apple's installer packaging (Qt5 started using their own packaging mechanism, bleh), and either skip the /usr/* stuff or put it somewhere else.  I don't know if Designer uses them, all I see is direct links to the Qt frameworks, but it might also need the executables, which would be a problem.

Another thing that might be a problem, regardless on how/if you install Qt, is if Designer loads or needs any Qt plugins - QGIS (Mac) currently ignores its qt.conf and tries to load the /Developer plugins and crashes, so you'd have to do work in Designer, quit, rename the plugins folder so QGIS doesn't see it, run QGIS to test your plugin, quit, rename plugins back, ...

With SIP in El Capitan it may fail to install those bits (or they will install but will be blocked from running), which include all the executables that are needed during compilation of QGIS.  Worst case is that installing those bits will block your system from booting (not fatal or "damaging", but you'd have to boot in safe mode to delete them).

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks for the pointer, I really thought I had matched all the dependencies in package-nightly.cmd, but I guess that wasn't the case. spatialite_i.lib works much better :)

Consult package-nightly.cmd or package-nightly.cmd.   There you'll find that is
set to spatialite_i.lib and not spatialite.lib

Hi Frits

Thank you for your answer and your guidance. I used Jürgens advise and used the spatialite_i.lib instead and I got a bit further. I am now also able to run and debug a QGIS session, but I cannot use python either, which I really want to.

I am using master_2 and building QGIS using "RelWithDebInfo", since "debug" gives me a lot of errors. Are the difference between the two, that using "debug" I'll be able to debug dependencies and not just the QGIS project?

Right now when I build the solution I get a set of errors which all seems to have the same pattern (this one for the pyplugin-installer): 

263>------ Build started: Project: pyplugin-installer, Configuration: RelWithDebInfo x64 ------

263>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(151,5): error MSB6006: "cmd.exe" exited with code 1.

Has this got something to do with the double slash near pyuic-wrapper.py and in that case, where should I fix it? Or is this problem about something completely different?

Hi Casper

I have recently build QGIS on my Windows10 system with Visual Studio 2010 with partial success. I could run and debug QGIS, but Python support did not work (yet).
This is my shortlist of fixes to get my build working:

add libs to qgis_core:
setupapi.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\lwgeom.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\libxml2.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\freexl_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\iconv.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\zlib.lib
legacy_stdio_definitions.lib

add libs to virtuallayerprovider:
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\lwgeom.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\libxml2.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\freexl_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\iconv.lib
C:\OSGeo4W64\lib\zlib.lib

qgis_core
Ignore specific default libraries: LIBCMT.lib

remainder not found: define in gmath.c
double remainder(double X, double Y) { return fmod(X, Y); }

compile with /bigobj:
python_module_qgis__gui.vcxproj
python_module_qgis__core.vcxproj

spatialite.lib does not include the 5 libs from OSGeo4W64, so I added them.
The DLL which gets included  with spatialite_i.lib has those libs onboard, so Jürgen's advice is probably better.
The other changes will manifest themselves as the compiler and linker start to complain!
Each time, you update the source from the remote master, the changes have to be performed again!
BTW, are you building master_2? The master depends now on Qt5 and Python3 and the build instructions are not targeted for that. I am now in the process of building the master with Visual Studio 2015, where I have to build some libraries myself from source.

Let me know if I can help.

Frits

No, the QGIS session - since Feb 2010.  So nothing new.

No idea.

No, the "Debug" uses another set of runtime libraries that have debugging code
in them (mainly for memory management), that makes them incompatible with the
original set.  So you also have to build the dependencies with those and end up
with two sets of everything.

"RelWithDebInfo" just adds the debugging information (and skips some
optimization) and hence enables debugging, but doesn't require the other set of
libraries.

Probably.  I guess you're running the development environment without the PATH
setup (like in package-nightly.cmd at the point where cmake --build %BUILDDIR%
--config %BUILDCONF% is invoked).

Hi Casper

 

I don’t think the double slash is a problem.

I have a note regarding pyuic-wrapper. I changed pyuic-wrapper.bat and the ImportError goes away. This is probably not the optimal solution, but maybe it brings you a little further.

 

rem %PYTHON% %~dp0\pyuic-wrapper.py %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

%PYTHON% "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\pyuic.py" %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

Oh, if you want to debug some code, set compiler optimization (for that project) to disabled (-Od) or you won’t be able to inspect most variables.

Hi Jürgen

Thanks for the clarification regarding "debug"/"RelWithDebInfo", now I know that I can just continue debugging with "RelWithDebInfo".

With respect to "cmake --build %BUILDDIR% --config %BUILDCONF%", I am following the  steps of INSTALL and I use VS2010 Express to build. I guess my lack of experience with C++ is catching up again, because I have no idea what you mean about running the development without the PATH setup. I guess Visual Studio does all the cmake stuff except for the cmake-gui part, where I point at the source and build folder.

Regards, Casper

Are you starting VS from the batch file as proposed in INSTALL ("Now close
cmake-gui and continue on the command prompt by starting vcexpress.")?  I guess
you don't.

Hi Jürgen

I start Visual Studio from the same command prompt as I start cmake-gui so I will have the same environment variables for both programs.

The change to pyuic-wrapper.bat proposed by Frits does work for now, but I will have to perform the changes each time I update the source code from github, which seems like the wrong solution.

Are you starting VS from the batch file as proposed in INSTALL ("Now close cmake-gui and continue on the command prompt by starting vcexpress.")?  I guess you don't.

Hi Frits

I think I read about double slashes causing problems somewhere, but I can’t remember where and in which situation. Your solution works just fine, but as you wrote it solves the symptom and not the cause, so it would be great to know where something is missing for both of us.

Thanks for helping me along the way ☺

Hi Casper

I don’t think the double slash is a problem.
I have a note regarding pyuic-wrapper. I changed pyuic-wrapper.bat and the ImportError goes away. This is probably not the optimal solution, but maybe it brings you a little further.

rem %PYTHON% %~dp0\pyuic-wrapper.py %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
%PYTHON% "C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\pyuic.py" %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

No, the "Debug" uses another set of runtime libraries that have debugging code
in them (mainly for memory management), that makes them incompatible with the
original set.  So you also have to build the dependencies with those and end up
with two sets of everything.

"RelWithDebInfo" just adds the debugging information (and skips some
optimization) and hence enables debugging, but doesn't require the other set of
libraries.

Probably.  I guess you're running the development environment without the PATH
setup (like in package-nightly.cmd at the point where cmake --build %BUILDDIR%
--config %BUILDCONF% is invoked).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using aggregates functions to count intersected
	features from another layer
Message-ID: <CAECJsSpxovZkXpz6hDi=_Tgoxf==29dJmBzV_jG0S3EkY9uy0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a polygon layer and a point one.
I'd like to calculate for each polygon feature, the number of points that
it covers. I thought the aggregates functions could help me find an easier
and straight expression to perform this (without creating intermediate
layers) but I fail to find any correct syntax.

I tried aggregate ('mypoint', 'count', "id", intersects ($geometry,
geometry($currentfeature)))

 And many variants of the fourth option but It always return the total of
points or an error. Actually this option is a filter and I wonder if i'm
not missing a "group by" option in the aggregate function (which seems to
be the appropriate one in my case). Is it possible?

The work around I found is to populate an ad'hoc field in the point layer
with overlapping polygon id, thanks to the SpatialJoin plugin, then I
create a one-to-many relation in the project between the two layers in
other to use relation_aggregate function.
But I expected something more direct.

Any hint, please?

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi,
Is it possible to set qgis variables such as @click_x or @click_y using
python?

I used hotlink plugin that is an alternate way of triggering layer
actions.  All other ways will return thos variables with clikc location on
the canvas, when hotlink doesn't. How could we fix that?

Thanks for your lights

Message-ID: <CAGQnEC5v0JfcQq5F+K-QK5kKQYSoy9qdKgHgK5iCQvEwc6djUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a plugin in Python and I want to add a vector layer to a
layer group. I'm trying to do it using this:


import qgis
root = qgis.core.QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()
test_group = root.addGroup('Test')

uri = qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setConnection('172.26.0.106', '5432','gis', 'gis','gis')
uri.setDataSource('public', 'test_table', 'geom', '', 'name')
layer = qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), 'Test', 'postgres')
print layer.isValid()
test_group.addLayer(layer)


The layer is valid but it don't appear on the layer group

Does it need any extra action?

Best reggards

Yes, one needs to add the layer to the map layer registry before
adding it to the layer tree. Just insert this

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)

before the last line with addLayer() call.

As you said I solved it using addMapLayer with a False parameter to
indicate to not add on the legend

Hi Régis,

@[somthing] variables are taken from the QgsExpressionContext which
contains several QgsExpressionScopes. So you can just add a new
QgsExpressionScope to the QgsExpressionContext which is used to evaluate
the expression.

Not sure how hotlink works but if it evaluates expressions by itself it

After rebasing a few hours ago, I'm still having issues (None appearing in
ogr2ogr commands) with the same example described in this comment [1] (OGR
"Convert format" algorithm).

Am I doing something wrong? Should I fix/adjust/add something to OGR
algorithms?

Regards,

Germán

hmm, it's strange that you get None...If the value pased is empty or None,
it should set an empty string as value

see:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/d911671b0669d3654d85954b52e38a9f5e952d4a

I adapted the test to check that, and it is passing

see:

My bad, Victor. I was testing against an old build. Just re-built QGIS and
the None is gone.
Thanks for the fix.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plans after friday's release?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjzik-k3q5QaXNBsq1uUSOKTATe9VyxfTmsjGaXH4L3fQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm just wondering what the plans are following 2.18's release
tomorrow? Specifically:

- will master_2 become release-2_18 and master_2 cease to exist?
- is there another 2.16 point release planned for tomorrow? There's a
bunch of fixes in that branch, but now that I think about it I'm
guessing there's no more 2.16 releases in store...

I'm most excited about the possibility of one less branch to maintain
+ manage backports for!

At the moment master_2 Travis builds fail, so maybe we should
first make sure to be able to release tomorrow ?

I am in favor of shooting down any 2.20 plans and fully focus on 3.0 to
reduce the backporting overhead and improve dev-time and user-awareness
towards 3.0.

We could potentially also allow some non-intrusive features to land in
there (some plans regarding this already exist).

And looking at the failing test here, that shouldn't be something we
should worry about:

https://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=47814587&build=249133

Plus I'd prefer to keep this discussion separate.

Oh, now I see (I saw a different failure at the time of writing this).
Still, it's inevitable that a failure raises a warning flag, and we
should make sure it always does !

Do you know which commit introduced that failure, or how to tweak
the testsuite to turn it to a tolerated one ?

Sorry, started a new thread.

It'd be a pity not to release a new 2.16, given the amount of fixes
that went into it.

Maybe we should find a way to enforce end-of-life in branches, so
to avoid people wasting time in backporting. Something like refusing
any pushes ? Renaming the brances with an "-eol" suffix ?

There is no cache other that that expressed by Jürgen => cache is
removed after closing qgis session.
The only way to remember pws is to save in the project (old dangerous
way) or saving using qgis auth manager (crypted using master pwd)

so something is wrong in your tests.

Hi,

+1 

Looking at the visual changelog of QGIS 2.18 and comparing with the
activity in the 3.x master branch I think the awareness towards 3.0 is
already there - which is good. 

The number of new features in 2.18 is considerably lower than e.g. in
2.16 and more and more new feature are in the 3x master branch only. 

> We could potentially also allow some non-intrusive features to land in

+1 again. 

----------------------- 

I'd also like to revisit the discussion about ending 2.x with an LT
version. 

It just seems illogical to me, to not end 2.x with an LT version. It is
kind of a waste of resources if we continue to backport stuff to 2.14
only and loose out on the many useful new features that were introduced
in 2.16 and 2.18. Think about all the nice things, like multi-attribute
search, multi-attribute editing, forms/widget improvements, and many
more - that won't reach the masses, because they are not in an LT
release for at least another year! 

Let's be more flexible and allow ourself to break the strict rule that
an LT version can only appear once a year, every third release. Rules
are here to break where useful/necessary. 

Just my opinion.

It makes sense to me - let's see, if 2.18 will be a good, stable version
we can promote it to LTR.

All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,
same here, users would not understand not having 2.18 as LTR.

I also agree that having 2.18 as LTR would be advisable.
The switch to 3.x will be very delicate for many organizations, therefore
lot of people will stitch to 2.x LTR before doing the big jump. That will
mean that 2.14 will be mantained for a very long time if we won't have a
new LTR...

m2c,
giovanni

Some points to consider

 * 2.14 has been promoted as LTR since around end of June,
   so for about 3 months. I guess many organizations are only
   evaluating/planning its rollout.

 * Organizations switching over to 2.14 have done this with a year
   of upcoming patch releases in mind.

 * Nobody prevents anyone from using 2.18 at any point in time.

 * Allowing non-intrusive features to enter 2.18 and releasing it as
   LTR at the same time imposes orthogonal requirements.

Indeed this doesn't seem reasonable to tag LTR if new features jump in.
I would stick to 2.14 for LTR.
This does not prevent to still produce point releases of 2.18 for more
than 3 months.

Or make 2.20 the last LTR.

+1

Also considering the willingness to inject more features into
"2.18" (which should be freezed by now).

A 2.20 would also respect the normal cycle, right ?

Or just delete the branch as moving target altogether? Whatever has been
in there should be in the latest tag anyway.

On the other hand, I think it's mostly about awareness. The branching
strategy is just one way to achieve this. Another one could be an
announcement mail.

Hi Casper

 

I did some sleuthing on the problem of the not working pyuic-wrapper.bat.

The second parameter is wrong. It points to d:\QGIS\Master_2\Build\output\bin\ but should point to d:\QGIS\Master_2\Build\output\bin\RelWithDebInfo.

The problem originates in several vcxproj files and that’s because in PyQtMacros.cmake the variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is empty.

You can see in package-nightly.cmd that CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is set to RelWithDebInfo, so I did this also in CMakeLists.txt with the line SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "RelWithDebInfo").

Now the original pyuic-wrapper.bat can be used again.

One minor point: in the vcxproj files all calls to pyuic-wrapper.bat specify the RelWithDebInfo path. But then you only build the RelWithDebInfo anyway.

 

Another mystery solved ;-)

What's the advantage of this? 2.20 also wouldn't be on the normal LTR
schedule (2.22 would be) and the two requests for LTR and for adding
features are probably the destiny of every last-of-major-release.

Sorry, my bad. Realized that 2.20 would be in line.

But that would mean a triple branch strategy for another 4 months,
putting more load on devs. Especially when it's about releasing 3.2 and
2.20 as LTR at the same time. I can't actually imagine we've got enough
manpower to do both jobs well at the same time.

I think LTR clients just have to realize that it's fewer features they
trade fewer features for stability.

If it's about fixes, they can happily go into 2.14 LTR and 2.18.

	Travis
Message-ID: <CAL5Q670LePWXcM1hLgcKQ_B1hQbYfAOJhJ9e4YC6oULkAw+8Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking into adding some tests for the auth system, I've successfully
run some local tests with a properly configured postgres instance running
as unprivileged user.

The question is: given that the current travis config does not use sudo,
can we alter the system postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf to add hostssl
connection and certificates?

The alternative (that should work just fine) is to launch another postgres
process on an unprivileged port from the test itself, configure it to use
PKI , initdb on a temporary folder, run the test and shutdown the postgres.

Any hint?

Hi Casper

 

QGIS master_2 builds and runs pretty stable now including Python scripts!

How are you sailing?

I think you can't, with Travis/Docker (sudo:false).

This one should work.

Start using docker containers for build ?
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/

With docker based builds you could make the test-oriented system as you need
it (all deps in, multiple postgresql versions, other services, multiple
configs) and run the build and the tests in such custom system.

I think the main challenge for this is a persistent ccache strategy or
build times will be up to an hour again.

Yes, thanks I'm already using docker and Travis a lot on other projects:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-plugin/blob/master/.travis.yml#L3

Sorry if my question was not clear: I want to add those test in the QGIS
project master and master_2 (or whatever will it be tomorrow) branches.

The .travis file for QGIS does not allow sudo and does not use docker.
Of course I don't want to rewrite the travis for QGIS since it's quite
fragile and I don't want to break it.

So, my question is (and I'm afraid I know the answer is no) is it possible
to configure postgres to (also) use test PKI certs with the current travis
configuration?

The alternative is to run another pg instance on another port and configure
it to use ssl/PKI, and I know that this works because I've tested it
locally but there might be other implications/problems that I've not
considered.

I think your best chance is searching the travis issue queue
https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues and open an issue if you
don't find one.

I share the feeling that this is the most promising way forward with the
least effort. I cannot think of any bad side-effects right now (apart
from more manually managed components that are potential sources of
future failures).

This seems to have made caching available (untested):

I can't imagine any problem, other than eventual hard-coding of
connection parameters in tests (which should be fixed, if present)

Hi Frits

Great to hear that you have tracked the incorrect folder setting. I will try it.

For the sake of the two of us, we seem to be going okay now. But I would like to move on to a place where downloading the QGIS source code, downloading and installing a few software packages, and at last follow a simple guide, would make it possible for any one build and debug QGIS.

Tim Sutton made a blog post in 2014 (which seems to be gone now) which described how to use Qt Creator to setup a working debuggable build on Linux, and it was very close to a simple guide. There were some missing dependencies, and a few I couldn't find (looked for the wrong package name).

Hi Casper

QGIS master_2 builds and runs pretty stable now including Python scripts!
How are you sailing?

I'm afraid I'm not Docker-expert enough to quickly tell if this is what
it requires.

Some background that might help to tell:

 * Every travis job is started on a pristine vm/container.

 * Only ccache (and possibly apt) should be cached, nothing (or not
   much) else.

 * Some clever strategy for caching is required (take cache from target
   branch, if not existent, create a new one).

 * Currently we get all that for free. Zero cost, almost zero admin.

 * Travis currently uploads persistent caches to S3.

Is this currently done automatically by Travis, from just the "cache"
configuration snippet in .travis.yml ?

Is the cache tree specific for QGIS, can it be publically viewed ?

Not that I knew. But it can be cleared (probably depends on some

Hi Casper

 

>> But I would like to move on to a place where downloading the QGIS source
code, downloading and installing a few software packages, and at last follow
a simple guide, would make it possible for any one build and debug QGIS.

 

Well, the file INSTALL is a start, but should be enhanced with our
experiences. It depends on QSGeo4W to install packages and that works quite
well. However, OSGeo4W does not have packages for the QGIS master build
(QGIS 2.99), where Qt5 and Python3 are mandatory. So OSGeo4W should be
updated. Jürgen is the maintainer of both pkg-qgis, pkg-qt4-libs and
pkg-pyqt4, so he might be willing to do that.

I learned to be very careful where to set environment variables (the least
global as possible), specially now I have both versions of Qt and Python, so
that needs to be documented also.

It would save other developers a lot of effort, if such documentation would
be available.

 

Frits

Having another 2.x LTR very much reduces the impetus for orgs to make the big
jump to 3. 2.14 as LTR seems the best approach.

Hi again, 
I have no trouble saving annotations on windows. 
So this is a packaging or platform trouble. 

Anyone knows if annotations rely on a specific library I may not have
compiled with?

Message-ID: <1476974541249-5291726.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I was puzzled loosing my drag and drop forms in a qgs project until I
realize that switching from one l ayer style to another will also switch
form.
I'm on qgis 2.16.3. 

Is that made on purpose so that user can store many edit forms per layer? 
I'm not sure it is useful and it triggers caveats :
 - user thinks he looses it's form and that something is broken
 - designing an application with different styles or layer presets require
to copy-paste form definition in qgs file by hand to make it available on
all layer styles. 

Any opinion?  Someone is using that really or should we fix it?

Cheers
Régis

Hi Régis,

I think this is a side-effect of saving everything to QML.

In fact, the qml API should be improved so it's possible to selectively
save certain configuration options. Then other parts of the app - like
map themes (visibility presets) - can handle this better. And users
could even chose what to export / import from a style in the vector
layer properties GUI when saving/loading a qml file.

Thanks for your lights Matthias, 

I filled a feature request for the record here. 

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15733 <http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15733>   

BTW, should I reference that issue in QGIS 3 API refactor repository ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] default datum transformations
Message-ID: <c1a31710-4086-cbd9-02ae-b1c803c8da62@duif.net>

Devs,

here at a talk about crs and proj...

looking at the crs tab of the options dialog, I see options about
"Default datum transformations", see this screendump:

http://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/16/1020/h_1476984799_4613200_82151ac927.png

When I push the + and - button I see that rows are added in the table,
but I cannot see anything in it (all stays white as in screendump).

Somebody here who can tell me how this should work? Or what I'm doing
wrong that I do not see a dialog or so?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

So we're only a couple of hours from the release of 2.18, and I've got
to say - I'm disappointed.

A whole release with absolutely no easter eggs or stupid commit
messages caused by last minute bug fixing stress!

Personally I blame Travis. That guy's a jerk - always judging other
people's work but never actually volunteering to help out in turn.

Urf! That is absolutely terrible news - I really hope we can fix this some how. I propose a good place to start is to dedicate the entire next hackfest to building some world class easter eggs in QGIS. My vote would be for asteroids implemented as a map layer plugin where the polygons on your map turn in to asteroids....

And +1 for more quirky posts like this - sometimes we take ourselves too seriously and it is good to remember that a lot of us are here in the QGIS project because it is FUN!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issues with a Python test for Processing
Message-ID: <CANaz7mxqoTxF=GObMJa4n_GPC0qDB4Hht53JB-K7gGnNTADNrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,


I'm having troubles trying to run a custom test [1] for my PR [2].


I'm able to run it against my local build in this way:

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/apps/lib/
  $ QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=/apps
PYTHONPATH=/apps/share/qgis/python:/apps/share/qgis/python/plugins:$PYTHONPATH
python ../python/plugins/processing/tests/GdalAlgorithmsMemoryTest.py

It passes (prints OK) but I get a segmentation fault:

  ERROR 10: Pointer 'hDriver' is NULL in 'OGR_Dr_GetName'.
  *** Error in `python': double free or corruption (!prev):
0x0000000003a116b0 ***

When I push a commit to my PR, Travis says there are errors [3] with my
test, I guess related to file path configurations. Travis also gets the
segmentation fault.

Could someone please give me a clue on how to solve this issues?
Why tests pass against a local build but fail with Travis?


Regards,

Germán

Hi Richard

It is most convenient to let QGIS enter the content for the datum 
transformations for you. Clicking +/- in the option assumes you know the 
src/dest Ellipsoids and the numbers from the transformation table (it is 
mostly there to have a convenient way to delete the entries).

Instead, check the box 'Ask for datum transformation when no default is 
defined' in the option dialog. Then reproject a layer in the map window, 
a dialog shows up asking you to pick a datum transformation. In this 
dialog, check 'Remember selection'. You now have an entry in the option 
table and QGIS automatically uses the selected datum transformation for 
further transformation between these two CRSs.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <573f7c08-9edb-c124-2a16-7fec8cb67570@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I have a project with custom symbols stored in a path on a Windows
machine, in a location of the type E:\symbols\svg. I need to use these
for a server project. I added the conf on the Debian server:

mkdir -p /qgis_conf/QGIS
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/nameofthevirtualhost
SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/qgis_conf/"
chown www-data /qgis_conf
nano /qgis_conf/QGIS/QGIS2.ini
# add:
[svg]
searchPathsForSVG=/path/to/svg1|/path/to/svg2

but I do not know how to map the desktop path to the server one: any hint?
Thanks a lot.

Hi all,
when publishing a complex project in Lizmap, label collisions are
checked only within a layer or group, and not, as in QGIS Desktop,
across the project. This is a serious limitation for cartographic
projects. I cannot think of a solution to this: am I missing something?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi

I am looking at implementing undo functionality in my plugins but so far I have only found the option to use beginEditCommand for each layer.

If a user click a button in a plugin which introduce changes to several layers, is it then possible to do all the changes in one transaction so when the user undo's the click, all layers roll back the changes?

Hi Paolo,

It's not a qgis server issue!
It's just the way lizmap querying QGIS Server: One layer at a time! So 
impossible labelling checking under multiple layer.
If you want exactly the sae rendering has QGIS, lizmap has to implement 
a way to query all the layer in 1 request.

Regards,

What would be very nice would be a way to render labels client side.
Probably not so easy (and maybe only with support for a subset of
labeling options) but imagine the UX!

thanks for clarifying. I understand the issue - how hard would it be to
implement it? Any plans to do it in the foreseeable future?

Not sure if this would work for you Paolo, but IF all layers come from
the same service, the web-client could try to collect all layers from
that service in the right order and fire it as one WMS request.

BUT off course this makes it more difficult to implement a layertree in
which you want to be able to show/hide individual layers. You will have
to fire the layer collection EVERY time the visibility of one of the
layer changes. ( I once coded a java-applet doing this :-) )

IF it is a one service project, this seems a viable option to implement?

Hi Paolo,
this is a sample from the qgis.ini in ou qgis-server environment.

It map two paths for svg: the svg for our Geological DB and the path
for out DBTopographics 2K scale DB.


[svg]
searchPathsForSVG=/home/...path-to.../qgis-settings/svg/simbologie_continuum_geologia_regione_toscana|/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/svg/simboli_dbt10k_rt_svg|/home/...path-to.../qgis-settings/svg/simboli_rt_dbt2k_v0

every single path is separated using a | char

regards,
A.

Hi,
our webgis framework "Tolomeo" multilayer and multiwms is working like this.

It group all the layers in one only service GetMap request for every service.
But when the tree is filled with layer coming from different wms services.
It must split also for service and for layer.

So is quite impossible to have 1 only request , but often there are
3-4 request everyone with more than one layer instead of 20-30
requests.

Another question is if the user move the order of the layer up or down
in the tree.
The framework should recognize this and change the splitting of the
request to support the new order.

Another question is if the user request some client operation like put
a transparency on a layer.
This mean that that laywe should request separatly from the other to
allow after the change of transparency on the client side.

This to explain that the question can rapidly increase in complexity.

Regards,
A.

You got the point: we still need some different layers to be switched on
and off individually.
All the best.

In fact, my problem was that one style (named "simple") didn't have the drag
and drop form when others had it. 

Looking at qgs xml, it appeared that the closing     <map-layer-style
name="simple"/> was messed up among other map-layer-style names. 
Moving it back to close correctly its own style section without embedding
the others solved my issue in qgs project. 
Any idea why this can happen?

Hi devs,

I know that is a bit too late but I'd just fix an issue in processing 
Rscripts.

This fix is not in final-2_14_8 because I discussed about this fix with 
a customer and because the bugfix stop is way in 2.16 branch 11 days ago 
(not mine).

Hi Andrea,
aparently qgis does not see the environment I defined. How did you
define it? Did you follow:

 nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/nameofthevirtualhost
 SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/qgis_conf/"

?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <11968e66-62ba-cbc2-3d33-61b5631843d9@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

We (David Marteau and I) will start the QGIS Server refactoring.

The first step for us is to develop the *service register* like 
described in the QEP: QGIS server code refactoring for QGIS 3.0 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/74

To keep the developement open, we proposed to use a github repository to 
centralize *Pull Request* and development strictly on QGIS Server with a 
dedicated branch https://github.com/3liz/QGIS/tree/master_qgis_server
We proposed to do so to have the possibility to broke the code but we 
will continue to merge master in it during the dev.
We will open the right to other QGIS Server developers and be proud to 
review Pull Request.

Our goal is to keep the functionalities, simplify the code and add 
modularity; to have something more maintainable, robust and expendable.

Regards,
René-Luc D'Hont

Hi René-Luc, 

hm - I am not sure if this is good timing. 

Martin Dobias will refactor the layer tree extensively to allow a better
QGIS server code design. It is his proposal he submitted for the QGIS
grants. The swiss QGIS user group, potentially together with the german
QGIS user group will pay for his work, because it didn't make the grant
in the voting, but we still thought it is important work to be done. 

I guess it would make sense to wait until his work will be finished and
then start the QGIS server refactoring. However, it would be good to
collaborate with Martin to make sure his refactoring is useful for the
QGIS server refactoring. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi René-Luc,

great! Thank you for starting it. It should be possible to create a
dedicated branch in the QGIS official repo. Do you have the rights for it?
Or do we have to ask a QGIS Repo community member? It'll be easier for the
QGIS community at large to find and contribute to the ongoing work.

Best regards

Emmanuel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fill nodata gdal tool in gdal-plugin using
	Leveller as outputformat
Message-ID: <CADDWHj13YvsMJbNaTMdDY0pKN6GfmBRf7N5uT5Y00yR_SDLvaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to use the Fill nodata tool from the Raster menu (and so the
gdal-plugin) but it fails to use the default out format which seems to be
set to Leveller. Changing the code in the box to -of GTiff solves the
problem but I wonder why the Leveller format is not working.

I am running QGIS 2.14.7, with GDAL 1.11.3 in Ubuntu 16.

Is it related to the GDAL library version?

Cheers,
Eduardo

Hi Andreas,

We know that it will be premature to write code that dépends on the qgis core api and that we have to wait that things stabilize on this side and that no refactoring of the services can occurs without the refactoring of Martin. 

The part of the code we wand to start is the support machinery for dynamic loading and registering of services and eventually the supports for the plugins.
For this part, we do need to rely on anything from the qgis core functionalities and thus  Martin Dobias's refactoring can go at its own pace.

David

Hi all,
I think we al very much welcome any improvement in any section of QGIS,
including of course our beloved server.
I may be missing something, but IMHO develoiping on a separate branch
only increases the risk of misalignment: why not keeping everything in
one place? I understand you are more free to break everything, but risks
seem to overweight the advantages.
All the best.

The idea is to have an 'aviary' branch that can mess with the server while keeping it in sync with the master, then at some point that branch can 'land' to the master.

All,

our current Visual Changelog 2.18 still needs some love, before it is
pretty enough to bring into the website:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.18.0/

anybody can invest some time into it to add some images/text/items?

1st problem: ccmake .. found Qt5, I had both Qt4 and Qt5, is there 
anyway to choose Qt4 if Qt5 is unsupported?

2nd problem: build required GDAL 2.1 or failed, I previously only had 
GDAL 1.11.4 - was I doing something wrong?

3rd problem: ${HOME} in cmake_install.cmake was empty - had to use 
/home/gordon as it appears ${HOME} and $HOME don't pick up environment 
variables.  was I doing something wrong?

4th problem:

CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:75 (file):
   file failed to open for writing (Permission denied):

     /home/gordon/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master/install_manifest.txt


Makefile:93: recipe for target 'install' failed
make: *** [install] Error 1

what do I have to change to fix this?

5th problem: ~/apps/bin/qgis - crashes, is this not a valid way of 
starting the application?  Is there a way around this?

This step, I guess I didn't read the install instructions carefully 
enough.  The following sorted out the 5th problem:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${HOME}/apps/lib/

and ~/apps/bin/qgis came up no problem.

Not sure how many plugins work.  QOSM indicated no module named PyQt4.

I am asking:  why do not create a video that explains step by step how to do for recompiling ?   I think this should be appreciate.   Of course, only core developers can make the video, during their normal work, because only they have their pc with a working cmake with correct libraries, configurations etc.   
The "video-recompiling-of-QGIS" should be a "TopYouTube" view, and can drive many money to the project. 

What do you think about ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Retire dxf2shp for 3.0?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshD_+qOe=quMOQnQsz4TA6X2561v_tFsvM_2=Low5i4VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wondering - can we remove the dxf2shp convertor core c++ plugin
for 3.0? Here my rationale:

- dxf works without converting
- no one is maintaining it
- conversion can be done using OGR itself
- doesn't really belong in QGIS

Would anyone object if I remove it?

+1 to remove it.  We should try and reduce the number of places you can do
the same thing in QGIS 3.0

Jürgen is working on native DXF and DWG reading support. So one more reason to retire dxf2 shp.

Also set the web engine to retrieve the vars from environment.

Obviously removing

-INTERPOL 0

from

/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/SagaAlgorithm214.py

solves the issue, but a proper fix would involve supporting also 2.3.1
version. I know it has been a long and frustrating discussion. I'm
willing to add 2.31 support if noone objects.
All the best.

Please do add support for SAGA 2.3.x LTS, it's the ideal target to
support in QGIS.

Hi all,
currently, gdal merge, as it is used in Processing, converts no data in

Shouldn't these changes be detected by the test suite?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python: creating a QgsPolygonV2 from the result of
 exteriorRing() or interiorRing(n) [QgsCurveV2]
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBiSJjWQViQ+iWVrp8R-mes23F1Uoh-KHWgUhQb9JytAeA@mail.gmail.com>

For a python test script I would like to loop through a MultiPolygon,
calculation the areas of the single Polygons, exteriorRing and where they
exist the interiorRing and compare the results from another source
(spatialite).

Sample code:
  test_polygon = test_geom.geometryN(index)
  self.assertEqual(test_polygon.wkbType(), QgsWKBTypes.Polygon)
  count_rings=test_polygon.numInteriorRings()
  if (count_rings > 0):
   polygon_ring_area_sum+=polygon_area
   exterior_ring = test_polygon.exteriorRing()
   print('-I-> Polygon[%d] : exteriorRing[%s] isClosed[%d] isRing[%d] '%
(index,
exterior_ring.geometryType(),exterior_ring.isClosed(),exterior_ring.isRing()))
   i_rc=exterior_ring.convertTo(QgsWKBTypes.Polygon)
   exterior_ring_area=round(exterior_ring.area(),6)

-I-> Polygon[11] : exteriorRing[LineString] isClosed[1] isRing[1]
-I-> Polygon[11] : exteriorRing[LineString] exterior_ring_area[0.000000]
rc=0

To calculate the area, the geometry must be a Polygon but I have not found
a way to do this properly.

The convertTo() method seems to only change to a Z or M type
- the documentation is a bit vague 'Converts the geometry to a specified
type.'

the next attempt:
line = QgsGeometry.fromWkt(exterior_ring.asWkt())
exterior_ring_polygon = line.convertToType(QGis.Polygon, False)

also did not bring the desired result (fails when creating 'line').

Since the returned LineString is closed and a ring, there should be no
problem.

--
A second question:

How can the srid of a geometry retrieved from a QgsVectorLayer be
determined?

It would only get detected if there is a test for it.

Sure - where do I find which commands are covered by tests? Could
someone remind me of the current way of writing a test for Processing?
Thanks.

One more issue: in FlowAccumulation(*).txt params have changed:

CAREA > FLOW (I think)
ACCU_TOT > ACCU_TOTAL

However, replacing the params returns:
Separator expected after the option 'FLOW'.

All the best.

 Hi,

Given the introduction of the 2.18 release changelog [1] being written, it
seems that one of the questions asked here is already answered: 2.18 is the
last 2.x release. No 2.20 to be expected. which in imho makes sense due to
the small number of features (compared to previous releases)

"Would that become a LTR?" remains however.

Regards,
Harrissou

Having another 2.x LTR very much reduces the impetus for orgs to make the big
jump to 3. 2.14 as LTR seems the best approach.

looks like the formula (dtm*2) is correctly passed to GRASS, but it
complains that is wrong. Are there changes in GRASS itself??

I am no GRASS expert, but i see nothing wrong in the way Processing is
creating the command line calls to GRASS.

Hi Paolo and Victor,

The expression needs to be in the form:

output_name = input_name [operation] [constant or another input_name]

So, in your case:

dtm2 = dtm*2

But it still has problems, specially in Windows:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/6894

It would be great to have r.mapcal full operational in Processing.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

2.14 is still LTR and 3.20 will be the next one.

Hi all,
thanks for the clarification. Description improved in:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/66b66ed45020e54146e43a35a94e9d024467f7df
Please improve it further if unclear.
I agree thatwe do need a fully functional, easier to use `r.mapcalc`.
All the best.

mmm, but Paolo's call already contains dtm*2, not dtm2. That's why i
said that it looked correct to me.

Any chance to have an in-source-tree version of testcases writing
documentation ? Ideally reachable from README in the test directory...

Having easily accessible documntation would probably help
getting more tests coverage.

Thanks Matthias. IMHO implementing a comprehensive set of tests is of
high priority, as well as fixing some crucial issues.
All the best.

AFAICT the syntax is of the type
dtm2=dtm*2
which I tested, and works. New description should help users, but the
command is still very cumbersome to use, see
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/6894#note-19
All the best.

Hi all

Here is my proposal to disrupt the quiet waters of project and map
layer registry classes:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/76

I should have time to work on the implementation during December...

Hopefully this will provide a good building block for the rewrite of
QGIS server for 3.0...

Any feedback to the QEP would be very appreciated!

Cheers
Martin

Nice. Glad this is moving forward.

Will this facilitate an eventual (not part of your proposal/work)
multi-map-frame environment? Alvaro might have good considerations to offer
on that front.

Multiple projects and multiple map frames (within one project) are
pretty much independent topics - so my QEP does not change anything
related to multiple map canvases (which I believe more of a GUI issue
since there are already plugins like Dockable MirrorMap that enable
it).

Hi,


> Unknown option 'INTERPOL'

The problem is already know, this parameter (in the io_gdal module,
the one to import raster layers) has changed name in recent SAGA
releases. This must be addressed also in SagaAlgorithm***.py

Regarding all other changes/additions that could have been made too
SAGA modules:
some time ago Victor (or AlexB I don't remember) provided a script
that that compares two different versions os SAGA (see example
attached). I have used it a few times in the past to change/create the
descriptions files when a new SAGA version was published.

there are also other candidates I guess. Alex Bruy recently ported the
algorithms from the "Interpolation" plugin to Processing. What about
"evis" and "oracle spatial georaster"?

yes; in principle supporting saga 2.3 LTR should fix this for a while.

I have just tried (same platform, same qgis version) and can't
confirm. If in the output dialog you choose "tif" the gdal command is
properly change with -of Gtiff (and similarly for the other formats).
Check if have an old version of gdaltools in your plugin folder.

Hi,

The QGIS website displays the new release of QGIS 2.18 as available for download, but both the Windows x86 and the x64 files are not found. LTS versions seems available.

I couldn't see any notice on the list, so here is my notice :)

Also zonal stats: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3662

dxf2shp was the lowest hanging fruit. But I would like to see the list
of installed c++ plugins culled considerably (and the remainder moved
to python plugins ideally!)

Note that the processing interpolation algorithm doesn't 100%
reproduce what's available through the plugin yet, so that's not
suitable for removing at this stage. Evis I don't think should be
removed until there's a suitable replacement. I'm not sure about the
oracle raster one and whether that's still a useful feature or not.

Nyall

Thanks, I've linked that file from  tests/README.md
in commit 31cd7a81a3434e159920bd9ce40817ffcc40144a (master only).
Any other document for other testing frameworks in use ?

the script? weird, I'm pretty sure I got it from you.

About the diff files with parameters differences (and new tools)
between different SAGA versions: I don't have anything locally. In the
recent past when I had more free time I created such files and made
the proper PRs, an example:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f8ea9d926872fd36ad06890a48308b5a8eea8078

anyway now I downloaded the list of most recent SAGA versions cmd
tools/parameters from here

https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/SAGA%20Release%20Information/

and create such files, that I'm attaching here.

cheers

Hi,

The QGIS website displays the new release of QGIS 2.18 as available for download, but both the Windows x86 and the x64 files are not found. LTS versions seems available.

I couldn’t see any notice on the list, so here is my notice ☺

Now that 2.18 is out and its release-2_18 branch was created,
and given the decision for 2.18 to be the last release in
the 2.x series, should the "master_2" be removed ?

And maybe the roadmap table [1] should be updated to add
3.0 release ?

Hi all,
from the lack of responses, and of tests created, it appears evident
that either the interest is not high, or the fruit is hanging too high.
I'd be in favour of sponsoring the effort, either directly through QGIS
or indirectly through a crowdfunding effort. Opinions?
All the best.

Mmm, as part of making the banner public, this url is a little too early
published too. We are waiting on the final changelog and will publish
that soon/when ready.

+1. It's confusing since people are opening PRs against master_2 when as
far as I know this branch is a dead end.

It makes sense to me. Any reason not to close it immediately?
Also, I'd close commits for 2.16, and mark is as unmaintained. Keeping
2.14, 2.18, and master seems heavy enough for devs, and confusing enough
for users.
All the best.

Hi,
Thanks for raising this. I don't think we need a special URL.


1. First all plugins should have maxVersion set to 2.98 by default.
2. Then plugins with metedata having maxVersion >= 3.0 or minVersion >=
3.0 would be listed.

Can someone take care of point 1?

Denis

Hi,

On the official repository the default version for all plugins is x.99
where x is the major version of the qgisMinimumVersion metadata tag.

I guess this needs to be changed.

Or we let master request

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.0

which gives me currently just two plugins, on of them with wrong
metadata :-) ?

so only plugins devs which actually update there plugin to raise there
maximum version or set the minimum version >=3 will be shown?

is that enough to work for now?

Richard Duivenvoorde

I can only speak for IPyconsole and 3.0 it's on purpose since I've tested
it on master.

I fully agree with master requesting 3.0, this is the new API.

Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhvgwt2u4T+BxGaij=iD+6NFhpROR_ayvETk28R6=R46rA@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,


we have seen that the new QGIS 2.18  reports a warning when opens a  .qgs
project file,
reporting that it is an old version, and saving again, it could be
incompatible with old versions of QGIS.

We  are asking what is the reason for this.  Could you explain us ?

BTW, there is a function for saving the .qgs  file  in a previous version ?


Thank you

Geo

There's no backward compatibility in qgs files. If you upgrade them then
they won't necessarily be the same in earlier versions. Sometimes they
won't be openable at all in earlier versions. Hence the warning.

No, nothing like that exists.

Oh yes, it's true !    You are right.   I tested.     :(

So I am asking: what is the reason why we did this  ?

What you call "feature" is a problem for all those who need to share data
with users who have an older version of QGIS, for one reason or another.

I am wrong ?   What do you think ?

Geo

Nothing has been explicitly done to prevent it.

The "feature" is a warning which you can interpret as "It might or might
not work in your scenario. Before you rely on backporting projects in
production scenarios, test it carefully.".
Or test one version and stick to that within a project which is the
safest choice.

Changing this behavior would be a considerable additional amount of work
and slow down development of new features (and there would still be no
guarantee).

When it's ready there will be a link on that page.  In the meantime you can
click on the link in the 2.18 banner.

Hi,
Note that the link in the banner leads to a valid page only if you are
reading the english version of qgis.org. Otherwise it fails.

To state it perhaps more explicitly, this is not a 'feature'. It is a 
'consequence' of the development or improvements of features in QGIS. 
This is basically a choice that has between made to avoid spending too 
much time on making project (.qgs) files back-ward compatible, as 
explained by Matthias. This may indeed be a problem for users (it has 
been for me in the past). But QGIS does provide a clear warning that 
your project files may not be backward compatible, to help users to run 
into problems later. It would have been nice to have some form of 
backward compatibility, but I understand why this may not be feasible, 
and I am happy I am being warned in advance.

Hi,
is there a bug in bugtracker?
I think probably is my mistake.

This is my profile with 3 tickets

https://hub.qgis.org/users/1604

But I don't appear in authors list:

https://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues/report

Why? I wrong some procedure?

I know others users has the same problem.

Best regards.

Are you sure you can't open it in older versions? I mix project versions a
far bit and never seem to have any issues.  Some styling options etc might
not load right but it should still open at least.

Setting up PyQGIS Python interpreter.  Eclipse - Oxygen, how do you add 
hidden folders, when you cannot see them, using the Libraries tab - new 
folder button?

If you understand great - I am on page 94 of Python Programming Cookbook 
(2015) for those that don't follow.

 From the QGIS Python Console for QGIS 2.16:
import sys
sys.path
['/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing', 
'/home/gordon/.qgis2/python/plugins/GeoCoding/libs', 
'/usr/share/qgis/python', u'/home/gordon/.qgis2/python',

'/home/gordon/.qgis2/python/plugins', '.']
qgis
<module 'qgis' from 
'/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/__init__.pyc'>

I was planning to Library - add New Folder  
/home/gordon/.qgis/python/plugins but the tool does not allow selection 
of .qgis

If this isn't the best way, how should it be done?

Thanks for any tips.

Message-ID: <CAB28AshB11RHuTP=irnX6dbmLw8CvP9SCa4pKy9xLWd76toC4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to start the discussion around this early so that we can plan
ahead and not have to make a last-minute decision.

What are everyone's thoughts on extending the timeline for 3.0? In my
opinion things are currently going really well, we have Qt5/python3
builds which are stable enough for daily use and there's been a ton of
cleanups to the code.

There's a lot of changes still coming in, and I think there's SO much
room for making things better that I don't like the idea of the early
2017 deadline for the final release. I'd much rather extend this out
by another cycle and really getting the platform ready for the next
series of QGIS releases.

We could always put out a "preview" release in March, without frozen
API, if desired.

So, what's everyone's thoughts? Good idea? Bad idea?

Nyall

Hi, 

It would be fine for me to have a double dev cycle for 3.0. Devs should
have enough time to make proper decisions and work on the API. And
python devs probably also need more time to get their most important
plugins in shape for the new API, qt5 and Python 3. 

Perhaps it would be good to also have more than one month for testing
and bug fixing - extending this to two months. We could simply shift the
one month bug fixing/testing of the first cycle towards the end of the
second cycle. 

So this modified proposal would mean: 

Feature freeze at the end of May, release at the end of July. Right? 

Fine with me, if we still care about the 2.x branch where necessary -
preferably investing more in 2.18x than in 2.14x (my personal opinion).

Hi,

I agree with Nyall. As this is a major release this requires more time,
have a look at how long it took Python 3 to finally become used for an idea
on how people treat major breaks in API.

As we already have 2.14, 1.6 and 2.18 out the door as a really good base I
don't see a need to rush this out.

I have plans for 3.0 but don't have a Windows build setup yet.

Regards,
Nathan

What timeline is there to extend?  We didn't set a date - just had rough ideas.

I realise that - but March has been thrown around tentatively. I'd
hate to get to February and then have this blocked by responses like
"oh but we had already planned our corporate deployment schedule
around a March release!!11!!". Better to openly discuss this
possibility so everyone's on the same page.

Moreover, the order within menus is different from previous fTools, and
not always logical.
I'm going to open a ticket.
All the best.

Hi all,
when changing one of the options, Processing takes about a minute to
close the popup. I sort of remember one similar bug being closed. Are
there news on that?
Thanks.

Hi all,
I think removing support for GRASS6 makes sense at least for QGIS 3.
This will reduce confusion among users, and will remove some bugs.
Anything against it?
All the best.

is that on master?

I detected that and found out that the grass icon, being a SVG, was
causing that delay, since it was loaded hundreds of times. Replacing
how it got loaded seemed to fix the issue, but apparently not in all
machines, so there might be more than that....

Thanks for the explanation. We are on 2.18.
If there is a way to check and help, just let us know.
All the best.

As far as I can see on recent releases this is fixed. I remember it
clearly and now on clean installations seems ok.

Cheers!

please don't unless the GRASS7 r.mapcalc is fixed in Processing,
with GRASS 6 at least we can rely on r.mapcalculator, not available in GRASS 7.

Thanks Nyall for raising this. I think this is quite reasonable. The
main issue I see is with people sponsoring new features not being able
to use it before next summer. Probably they will put pressure for
releasing a new version, or for making an exception to the
no-new-feature rule.
How could we cope with that?
All the best.

If we are all on the

http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule

page - it estimates 8-12 months from the release of 2.16 - so that would be
March to July '17.

Hi all,

What about having an automatic backup saved before overwriting the file
with the newer version ? For example create a my-project.qgs.2.14 and only
after that override the project file with newer version.
This would be a safe way to let the user keep a copy of the project.

I can create an issue and propose a PR if needed.

Regards
Michaël

There is another SVG symbols issue in addition to Path, present in QGIS

There is another SVG symbols issue in addition to Path, present in
QGIS 2.16 also, and that is the home directory path is incorrect and has 
two // rather than one /,

eg.

/usr/share/qgis/svg/
/home/gordon/.qgis2//svg/
/usr/share/qgis/svg/
/home/gordon/.qgis2//svg/

Can you try with 2.18/2.14.8. This issue was fixed recently, but since 2.16
is end of lifed it didnt receive the fix.

Sounds like a good plan to me.
IIRC there was some trouble with rename vs. copy vs. create file
connected to access rights or owner or similar in certain situations
when implementing the current project file backup process.
Maybe you can find something in the devel mailing list history.

I can confirm tha the issue is still there in windows 2.14.8 OSGeo4W64:


http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15759

the path seems also wrong indeed:

C:/Users/user/.qgis2//svg/
C:/OSGEO4~1/apps/qgis-ltr/./svg/


sorry Paolo for hijaking the tread.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Combo boxes for raster bands
Message-ID: <e28ee02c-d6ac-2c4b-e007-2e4c4cd60990@eftas.com>

Hello,

in my plugin I successfully connected a QgsFieldComboBox with a 
QgsMapLayerComboBox to let my user select a field of an already selected 
vector layer.

Now I want to give my user the opportunity to select a band of an 
already selected raster layer. How to achieve this?

I guess it should be possible with the QGIS Combo Manager module by 
Denis Rouzaud which supports band combo boxes 
(http://3nids.github.io/qgiscombomanager/). But its README tells me that 
the module is deprecated now because its functionality has been merged 
into QGIS core. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a QgsBandComboBox (or 
something like this) class in the QGIS core API and QgsFieldComboBox 
doesn't work for me with raster layers.

Any idea for combo boxes for raster layer bands using the core API?

Best regards,
Fabian

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field mapper when pasting features
Message-ID: <581222C5.90901@camptocamp.com>

Hello QGIS devs,

I want to add a field mapper dialog when pasting features to layers.

For now when pasting features with attributes names that do not exists 
on the destination layer,
those attributes values are lost.

When clipboard fields and destination layer fields are not strictly the 
sames,
In QGIS 3.0, I want to popup a new dialog with fields mapper configurator.

Dialog UI could be similar to Refactor Fields Algorithm, showing a list 
of destination fields :

     source expression (expression widgets) => destination field

For example, I often use this workflow :
     Open a shapefile or autocad file.
     Use the refactor fields to get temporary layer with same fields as 
destination.
     Paste to postgis database layer.

I think having this dialog showing up when needed could really ease data 
manipulation from one layer to another.
And I want to give the possibility to use expressions.

Any remarks, do you think I need to open to open a QEP for that ?

Regards

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673=Y3ou5mQRD-+4kKEvue=OpBdBtiuDMpxP5Ut5sZN_dA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been looking to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14703 and I've got a path
to a fix ("save as" dialog for unsupported mime types).

This is the kind of thing that falls in the grey area: from a user
perspective it's certainly a bug but tecnically is a not-implemented
feature.

Do yo think I could safely backport it to 2.4 ?

Note that there aren't any API changed and it does not impact with other
parts of the application.

Hi Alessandro,

You probably mean 2.14 - right?

I think this can be regarded as a bug fix. If you fix this in 2.14, can 
you please also include it in 2.18? There are more 2.18 releases planned.

Thanks,

Andreas

Message-ID: <e506e32b8f5255859500dd0ac13ad446@carto.net>

Hi, 

There is a localization issue with the vector menu in QGIS 2.18x 

When I have english as my GUI language I have one vector menu (nice),
but when I switch to german I end up with two vector menus: "Vektor"
(contains plugins) and "Vector" (contains all the Processing stuff
(former fTools)). 

Probably the same in other languages when "Vector" is translated to
something else ... 

Is there something we can do about this situation? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Sure, the "standard backport" package will be in branches
﻿⁠⁠⁠⁠release-2_18﻿⁠⁠⁠⁠ and ﻿⁠⁠⁠⁠release-2_14﻿⁠⁠⁠⁠

The next LTR will be a 3.x.
2.14.x will be maintained until that is released.

Hi Andrew, 

see also
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule


you can see that while 2.18x is not officially an LT version, there are
a number of updates planned for 2.18x - so it's almost like an LT
version ... 

The next 2.18 release will, besides bug fixes, also contain some very
useful Geopackage updates, and some upcoming 2.18x will also receive CAD
reading support (DXF/DWG). Jürgen knows when ;-) 

For 3.x. there are no release dates yet. Probably somewhere around
summer 2017 - but no-one knows yet.

Hi Andreas,

We got the same problem with 2.16 in french.

The processing menu configuration do not support translations.
Once the first run have been made, the config menu entries are set in 
the current translation.

Note that when this will be corrected in transifex and released (Vect&or 
translation for the processing menu entries),
I've added a reset button in processing dialog next to menus node in 
master branch,
but this have not been backported to master_2.
Here is a backport pull request : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3686

I think that we should remove the "Vect&or/" prefix in processing config 
for menus.
Adding it dynamically when creating the menu entries would be better.

Hi,

Indeed, this is a 2.16 bug which has been fixed. On my french machine, I
have a single Vector/Vecteur/Vektor menu (corresponding to the language I
select) which contains both plugins and processing functions.

In 2.18, When I let everything in french, I still have an unique Vecteur
menu containing all functions.
But I have 2 menus 'Vector' (for plugins) and 'Vecteur' (for Processing)
when i override my locale with english. Pressing the ALT key reveals that
both menus do not have same shortcut.
I also get double menus (Vektor vs Vecteur) when I switch to Deutsch. But
ALT shortcut are identical (V)

This behavior is totally different from the one described by Andreas so I
wonder if it has not to do with translation rather than code.

Hi Arnaud, 

This sounds like a very useful feature to have. A big +1! 

Not sure if it requires a QEP - but it never hurts to do one. Perhaps
other people have more idea, once they see a description or mockup. 

Thanks in advance!

I want to add a calculator in processing that is based on QGIS
classes, so is a native one, like the current raster calculator, but
in processing. I hope that allows us to get rid of all the others,
since it is very confusing and error prone. A good calculator that can
do everything should be able to replace the collection of them we have
now

Hi Victor, 

Good. 

The QGIS raster calculator should get some love. It is quite confusing
to many of our users in its current state, and also a bit limited. 

It would be nice, if an improved raster calculator could use the power
of the QGIS expressions. 

Perhaps, this would be a good candidate for another round of a QGIS
grants project.

please don't unless the GRASS7 r.mapcalc is fixed in Processing,
with GRASS 6 at least we can rely on r.mapcalculator, not available in
GRASS 7.

cheers!

This is good news. I rarely managed to get raster calculation done inside  
QGIS. The syntax is not easy to understand nor to learn (sparse docu with  
few examples), so I switched to use R instead, where raster calculations  
are doable even for me (and incredibly flexible and fast)

Cheers

Yep, both good ideas :-)

One thing I think of: a 'mapper'-dialog could maybe also be used in the
some algorithms like an 'union between 2 layers' and other algorithms
which handle 2 or more feature types etc etc

exactly. There are more situations where attributes need to be
harmonized between two different schemas. 

It would be great if something generic could be developed that can be
re-used in other situations. 

With that in mind - perhaps a QEP makes sense.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Correction of QgsOgrProvider implementaion of GDAL
	2.0
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBiXYp9saY8-nH3tFne4nCvJLqsQwmJR=+GmMCcG5HZ-wg@mail.gmail.com>

This is a summery list of the intended changes to be made to
the QgsOgrProvider class which is based on the Proposal 9 of QGIS Grant
Applications - August 2016.

https://qgisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/qgisgrantapplicationssummary-september2016.pdf

Despite the fact that this Proposal did not receive the needed votes to be
accepted, the need still exist to correct, what I believe to be, critical
flaws in the present implementation.

For this reason I have continued working on this and have prepared a
workable solution of the known problems which can be viewed here:

https://github.com/mj10777/QGIS/tree/master_2_ogrprovider

(unfortunately I created this about 2 hours before 'master_2' died, so this
should be considered as a 'release-2_18' branch)

---
Main problems:

Problem 01:

The retrieval logic for Ogr-Layers changed between gdal 1.* and gdal 2.*.
This was reported on the 31.03.2015:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12479

Unfortunately the suggested changes were not implemented, so that at
present, when using gdal 2.*, will not return the same list as gdal 1.*
- this geometries contained in a table that has more than 1 geometry will
not turn up (mainly spatialite)

The table containing these geometries will show up, but cannot be loaded.

To make matter worse, corrections (30.06.2016) made to resolve:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15168

removed the 'layername' parameter from the sent uri, making it impossible
to use 'GetLayerByName', which MUST be used after the first table that
contains more than 1 geometry
- GetLayer (with id) can be used up to this point, but not afterwords

To retrieve a Layer, where there are duplicate names in the Datasource
(issue: 15168) (mainly in none database Datasources such as KML, GML)
- only GetLayer (with id) can be used to retrieve the layer correctly

So the need exists to determine how the Layer should be opened while
reading the whole Datasource in QgsOgrProvider::subLayers()
- if it a duplicate 'layername' : GetLayer (with id)
- otherwise GetLayerByName

--
Problem 02:

Since 2015, new code has been added implementing gdal 2.* specific
functions, which will only be included when compiled/built against gdal 2.*.

Thus, when QGIS is complied against gdal 2.*, symbols/functions are added
- that doe not exist in gdal 1.*.

Nothing was undertaken to check which gdal version is being used when QGIS
is running, causing an 'symbol lookup error' for:
- libqgis_core.so: OGR_F_GetFieldAsInteger64, OGR_F_SetFieldInteger64
and OGR_G_ExportToIsoWkb
- libogrprovider.so: OGR_GT_Flatten, OGR_GT_HasZ and OGR_GT_HasM

causing QGIS to crash.

--
Problem 03:

The maintaining of the code in QgsOgrProvider has become difficult.

The need exists to consolidate/isolate crucial functions (such a Open,
Sublayer) in a way that
- a backup solution is offered to reliably compleate the task
- build/runtime version specific code (including deprecated functions)

are done in 'Wrapper' functions that deal with these problems once and then
correctly.

Sample: the logic to determine the Geometry type is done in multiple places
- getOgrGeomType and in SubLayers (where with gdal 2.* an incorrect result
will be returned and 3 '#if defined(GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION)')

Such tasks should be consolidated in extra functions so that any maintainer
of QgsOgrProvider would simply use them without having to deal version
specific conditions.

These tasks should be added to the already existing class
'QgsOgrProviderUtils'.

--
Major changes:

QgsOgrProvider::open
- now uses QgsOgrProvider::OGRGetLayerWrapper to open the dataset,
replacing the logic of
-- either using GetLayerByName OR GetLayer (with id)

This is done 3 times, but also done in the same way
in QgsOgrProvider::repack() and QgsOgrFeatureIterator::QgsOgrFeatureIterator

Based on the sent Url, OGRGetLayerWrapper will attempt to open the
Datasource as declared in the Url.
- during subLayers() checking was done if GetLayerByName OR GetLayer (with
id) is needed
-- for this the ogr-specific sublayer string will send an extra parameter
'ogrgettype=0|1' with this information

If the given method fails, the other method will be attempted
- if that fails the DataSource will be read calling subLayers()

The sublayer string, that successfully opened the Layer will be stored in
the class member mSubLayerString.
- when QgsOgrFeatureIterator later runs it will retrieve this value from
its copy of QgsOgrProvider (mSource)
--> and load the layer without further checking
 ogrLayer = QgsOgrProviderUtils::OGRGetSubLayerStringWrapper( mConn->ds,
mSource-> mSubLayerString )

The ''ogrgettype=0|1" will be a part of the Uri that will be stored in a
QGIS project
- so that when loading a project, no further checking is needed

Since the parameters in the Uri are 'optional', older projects not
containing 'ogrgettype=0|1" will not fail
- when changes to the properties of a Project-Layer are made, the
'ogrgettype=0|1" will be appended to the Uri string

QgsSublayersDialog will not show the ogrgettype received
from subLayers() in the dialog.
- typedef struct LayerDefinition has been adapted to store the ogrgettype
value in ' int getType'

QgisApp::askUserForOGRSublayers
- has been adapted to build the uri with ogrgettype (as well as
geometrytype and featurescount)
- layername has also been (re-)added [was removed last June]


--
Status:

All of the above have been implemented.

There are areas where a policy decisions should be made before a pull
request should be made.

A python test script has been created
(tests/src/python/test_provider_ogr_general.py) to test the different
conditions
- together with test data - some of which are the original
gdal/ogr autotest databases

Altogether 6 tests
1) Spatialite SpatialView - write support
- a special gdal 2.2.0 version that supports writable SpatialViews runs
correctly
-- checks CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE TRIGGERs exist and run correctly
- other gdal versions report that  writable SpatialViews are not supported
2) Spatialite SpatialTable with more than 1 geometry
- created with gdal autotest/auto/ogr_sql_sqlite.py spatialite_8()
--> tests that the results returned  from gdal 1.* and 2.* are the same
3) Spatialite SpatialTables with XYZM values
- created with gdal autotest/auto/ogr_sql_sqlite.py spatialite_5()
--> checks that expected values fro different Z/M/ZM values are correctly
retrieved
---> reports that gdal 1.* does not support M/ZM tables
4) GML 2 MultiPolygon with InternalRings
- created from a historically correct complicated geometry from spatialite
Database
-- loops through Polygons, Exterior/InteriorRing calculating area
--> comparing the values with the original spatialite result
--> that the area sum of the Polygons is the same as that as the
MultiPolygon
--> that the area of the Polygon + the area of the InteriorRing are the
same as the ExteriorRing
5) Sample kmz file showing layers with unicode Chinese characters, some of
which a duplicate and some with a geometry field
- included in bug report 15168
-- testing Layers without a geometry definition will not be listed
-- testing that the retrieved layers with duplicate names
--> comparing the amount of points and that the first and last points are
different.
6) sqlite Integer64
- created [as 'sqlite_test.db'] and filled with gdal
autotest/ogr/ogr_sql_sqlite.py ogr_sqlite_1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16
-- checking/updating values in Table 'tpoly' which contains 2 fields with
BIGINT (Integer64)

Windows:
No test have been done with Windows to insure that no 'symbol lookup error'
occur.

Tested combinations (linux only):
- original 'release-2_18' (2016-10-25) built with gdal 2.2.0
-- running with gdal 2.2.0: brings expected problems with test for tables
that has more than 1 geometry
-- running with gdal 1.11.2: receives (as expected) 'symbol lookup error'

- branch 'master_2_ogrprovider'  built with gdal 2.2.0
-- running with gdal 2.2.0: all test run correctly
-- running with gdal 1.11.2: all test run correctly, reporting that M and
Integer64 values are not supported - without 'symbol lookup error'

- branch 'master_2_ogrprovider'  built with gdal 1.11.2
-- running with gdal 2.2.0: all test run correctly, but
--> Integer64 values are returned as a string
--> Z/N/ZM Geometries Types are shown and correct values retrieved
-- running with gdal 1.11.2: all test run correctly, reporting that M and
Integer64 values are not supported

Documentation:
The new and changed functions in 'QgsOgrProviderUtils' and 'QgsOgrProvider'
have been documented
- explaining 'the reason why' thing are being done in a certain way

--
Policy decisions:

With the exception of  'OGR_G_ExportToIsoWkb' (that contains M value
support)
- all other functions that cause a 'symbol lookup error' can be emulated

When using gdal 1.*, the result of the 'Integer64' fields are incorrect
- all values > MAX_INT32 will overflow
So when built with gdal 2.* and running with gdal 1.*
- the reading and writing of 'Integer64' fields should not be permitted to
avoid the falsification of data

The same is true for QgsGmlStreamingParser::endElement, where
'OGR_G_ExportToIsoWkb' is used.

For QGIS 2.*: the support for gdal 1.* and 2.* should continue as is.

For QGIS 3.0: gdal 1.* support should be removed.

Reasons:
As gdal evolves, it will become more difficult to 'emulate' OGR functions
that do not exist in gdal 1.*
- the inclusion of which would cause a 'symbol lookup error'
A proper support for M-Values will probably become more important in the
future than it is now.

(sorry if this is a bit long winded, but one has to start somewhere)

Mark,

I unfortunately don't have time right now to review in detail your message & 
proposed changes, but a few suggestions though.

I think you should target master only for your changes (and consider only GDAL 
>= 2 case). It is unlikely they are appropriate for backporting, or that 
should be considered in a later stage depending on the impact they have.

You should try to create PR for each individual issue, otherwise it is super 
hard to deal with.

I didn't dig up into that but the issue here is with tables with multiple 
geometry columns, right ? In that case, the OGR uri should likely have a 
geometry= parameter so that the right column is selected. Similarly to what 
the spatialite or postgresql providers do.

To me, this is a non issue, or rather an issue we shouldn't try solving. In 
normal user environements this will not happen. This is just an issue for us 
developers that might play with multiple versions.
What we might perhaps eventually want to ensure is that if QGIS is compiled 
with GDAL 2.X, it works reasonably well when running against GDAL 2.Y where Y 
>= X. And even that can be painful, because 2.Y can introduce for example new 
geometry types not handled in 2.X, so that would oblige to have runtime checks 
in addition to compile time checks. Binary distributions of QGIS are normally 
recompiled against a new major GDAL version if they will run against it.

>

This is probably reasonable. I guess that all target environments that will be 
able to run QGIS 3.0 will have at least GDAL 2.0.

Hi Qgis developers,

I'm searching if there is any software to create a private plugin server.
The most complete documentation that I seen is this
http://blog.vitu.ch/11222012-1728/build-your-own-qgis-plugin-repository
Does any one did it before? If anyone did it ,did you used any software or
you served static files with HTTP server like Nginx?

Hi,

you can use the same software that's used on the official repo:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django or a simpler solution like this:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-plugins-xml

You can also avoid any server-side scripting completely if you create a set
of static filtered XMLs for the different QGIS versions and you serve them
statically after some url rewriting (Apache or Nginx doesn't really matter).

Hope this helps.

Since on my older machine, getting master to run properly is problematic,

yes, layername contains the geometry column with the syntax needed

The runtime check are a part of this solution and the assumption is that
both runtime and compile checks will be needed in the future.

Once in place in release-2_18, it will be easy to port to master (QGIS 3.0)
and to remove everything within the runtime/compile checks < 2 that have
been isolated and checked.

An earlier thread

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-October/045538.html

ended on: current QGIS Master getting to request ?qgis=3.0 versions of
plugins

I had a look into it to create a pull request, but that is coded as the
true Qgis.QGIS_VERSION_INT

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py#L238

Would it be ok to change that (temporarily) to a hardcoded "3.0"?

So the master/nightly plugins installer actually requests only plugins
which are ready to be used in 3.0?

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.0

After we have a the actual 3.0 release this could go back to
v = str(Qgis.QGIS_VERSION_INT)

OK?

Richard

I'd say yes.  And it's what d9349e5 does for various other things.

First I thought about making it return m for (m-1).99 and m.x, but I guess it's
ok to do that manually for every major release.  And even changed some stuff
that was referring to Qgis::QGIS_VERSION_INT before.

There is another option that I'm currently using:

https://github.com/mstuyts/phpQGISrepository/

You just upload you plugin ZIP file into the downloads folder and you're
done.

If you have issues with it, make sure you have installed the dependencies.

Agreed, having different raster calcs, non of them really good, all with
different syntax and interface, is not ideal.
Thanks.

Hi,

The same applies probably for the GRASS-plugin.

Another related thing: a first GRASS GIS 7.2 release candidate will be tagged soon, which comes with a lot of new features. Once RC1 is available it might be worth looking at what should be changed / adopted in Processing and GRASS-plugin...

Kind regards,
Stefan

Hi all,
I think removing support for GRASS6 makes sense at least for QGIS 3.
This will reduce confusion among users, and will remove some bugs.
Anything against it?
All the best.

GRASS 7.2.0RC1 is already available, it just hasn't been announced yet.

Packages are available in Debian experimental & ubuntugis-experimental.

QGIS 2.14.8 has also been rebuilt with that for Debian experimental.

Kind Regards,

ok, done:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] open vector data using specific GDAL driver
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OdaOUGL91OhgauTN5sZBntWbWWLxWXTJXsSvZX4MYy44A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wonder whether it's possible to specify GDAL driver when creating
QgsVectorLayer instance. The constructor allows passing uri, layer
name and provider. Is there any way how to specify GDAL driver which
will be used for opening datasource (let's say that we are working
with datasource which can be open by two different GDAL drivers).

composedURI = str(dbPath) + "|layername=" + dbTable
layer = QgsVectorLayer(composedURI, layerName, 'ogr')

Something like:

sqliteDriver = ogr.GetDriverByName('SQLite')
sqliteDataSource = sqliteDriver.Open(str(dbPath))

Thanks, Martin

No, this is currently not possible this way

You could potentially achieve what you want by calling 

blacklisted_driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('driver_you_dont_want')
blacklisted_driver.Deregister()
layer = QgsVectorLayer(composedURI, layerName, 'ogr')
do all the stuff you need with the layer
blacklisted_driver.Register()

I guess there is no need to create the set of xmls. Just one static file with 
all the plugin versions is enough, as the QgisMinimumVersion and 
QgisMaximumVersion tags will do the job. I believe the reason you implemented 
the sever-side filtering was to limit the response size, what isn't any problem 
in a small repo.

Hi Borys,

you are absolutely right, this was the reason for the official repo, if you
don't have many plugins I think you can  safely use a static XML and let
the client do the version filtering.

Hey,

I made a tool called qgis2img that can report the renderer time of a
shapefile. Its a standalone Python script if you do a search there is notes
on the web for it.

Message-ID: <CAG4NReKAbr9-rgBoB5LH0uMF7U00uAeD5FdghX3+PRg+wueogQ@mail.gmail.com>

As far as I understand, "Raster/Projections/Assign Projection" is meant
to change a wrong projection information in a raster layer, because the
real reprojection is done with Raster/Projections/warp
Nevertheless, "Raster/Projections/Assign Projection" uses gdalwarp, which
would actually reproject the layer. To just edit the projection information
I understand that "Raster/Projections/Assign Projection" should be
using gdal_edit.py

Am I wrong or is this a bug?

hear hear - everywhere where we use different expression syntax creates user confusion (SQL Filter in layer properties is another example I think).

Hi,

There is an issue with bats installation on Mac OS X. So the current tool
you specified is not working on Mac OS X 10.11

Any other solution? or Does any python script work for computing this?



Thanks,
Manikant

Hi all,
during a recent course, we got what seemed random crashes in Geometry
chacker, difficult to replicate reliably. Is this a know issue? Can I
help tracking it down?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,
I've been thinking about this, and I think a two stages approach would
be more effective. The problems are essentially two:
* algs not producing an output with default params
* algs producing incorrect results, with various combination of parameters.
Problem #1 is far more frequent and important than #2, especially
because of changes in the backends, and far easier to spot.
How difficult would it be just to check whether an output (possibly of
the correct type: vector/raster/html) is produced?
This alone would make the environment far more reliable (someone may
have notices the string of tickets raised by our latest analysis course).
All the best.

Hi Matthias,

My screenshot shows only 1:N links. N:1 links are not supported. By N:1, I
mean the relations from the side that contains the foreign key. If I open
the form for the "appart" layer, it doesn't show the linked "maison".

Yes, the collapsed state is remembered, but the default should be
collapsed. If the default is to open everything, the GUI is going to
explode if we have hundreds of linked tables.

Thanks and CU.

Hi Patrick,

for the side that contains the foreign key, there is the "relation
reference" widget which has a configuration option "show embedded form"
(I haven't used it in years and a quick check on it didn't work, so
maybe it needs fixing).

Agreed, collapsed by default makes sense for huge models. For small ones
it's a bit strange though. Another approach would be to put them on
separate tabs by default, I think that could look quite nice also. What
do you think?

Regards
Matthias

Matthias,

Hummm... I don't know about the tabs. Initially I was thinking it would be
a good idea, then I tried to imagine how it would look like for linked
layers within linked layers. We would have two choices:

   - Have QTabWidget within QTabWidget: tabs within tabs is a UX nightmare
   - Switch to the current way of representing relations for sub-relations:
   that would lead to user confusion because we have two ways of representing
   relations.

What do you think? To me, tabs is not a good idea.

Thanks

Hi,

I'd like to resurrect this discussion, particularly about the PyCookbook
doc part.

It'd be nice if someone more aware of what's worth putting in the PyQGIS
doc can go through the issues reports in the doc repository and tag the
issues accordingly. Currently tickets are automatically created and not
labeled and the risk is that we document them in the user manual and
automatically close them ignoring they could/should be documented in the
cookbook.

So if any dev interested in the cookbook content can give it a look, it
will be a good step to the upcoming update of this doc (either for 2.18 or
3.x)

Thanks,
Harrissou

I think the (current) groupbox within groupbox approach suffers from the
same UX defficiencies. At least I get confused regularly.

Maybe

* toplevel tabs
* first sublevel groupbox
* second sublevel ...
  groupbox again?
  skip?
  button to open in separate window?

OK, I've created a PR for auto-detecting N-1 relations and pick the
RelationReference widget for the foreign key fields.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3699

For the deep relations UX problem, I really don't know. Do we have UX
experts among the QGIS devs?

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS setup with Qt 5 on mac
Message-ID: <7C6DBC36-3ECA-4E82-A16C-A431C1E91E9E@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

First of all, thank you very much for the great job, I have been a very happy user for years !

I would like to contribute now to the development, but I found myself stuck at the installation of dependencies.

According to the instructions of the INSTALL file provided with the source code, mac users should use Qt 4 and compile and install a bunch of dependencies for which binaries are not available (mainly Spatialindex, SIP, QScintilla2, PyQt, Qwt and bison) before being able to compile QGIS. I followed the instructions and got stuck at compiling QGIS as the master now requires Qt 5.

Now as I actually started by installing Qt 5 by mistake, I had the opportunity to see that it leads to a lot of problems to compile the dependencies. As far as I understand, Qt 5 requires C++11, which means one must use the new libc++ library instead of the old libstdc++ (at least on my configuration, with El Capitan and clang/llvm). Some modifications are such that mixing both is not possible, so everything must be compiled from start with C++11 and libc++. Unfortunately most of the dependencies I mention above do not compile without tweaking, and I stopped doing it when it started meaning not only modifying the Makefiles but the code itself...

I guess some of you work on mac, and have a far better understanding of all this than me. So my question is : how did you install those dependencies to compile the last version of QGIS with Qt 5 ? 

Did you have to compile again all of them or only a subset using Qt 5 and C++11 ? If so, how did you do it ? I got stuck at Qwt (6.1.3) which uses lots of functions deprecated in Qt 5.

I hope someone can give me pointers, as I would really like to contribute to QGIS (and hopefully fix a few bugs bugging me) !

Best regards,
Diane

Hi,

As far as I know there is no such thing planned.

The plugin should still be working with 2.x versions.

Otherwise, there might be a developer willing to provide this in 3.x ?

Best regards,

Denis

Hi

I will speak with my own experience using and compiling Qgis on Mac (El capitan and Maverick):

First I use Macport: MacPort use clang/libc++ by default (at least with XCode 5.3 on Maverick, 7.3 on El capitan) so this should solve one of your problems.
I have installed qt5 from MacPort without problems. 

The problems arise with some ports that do not fully support qt5 variants and you need to tweak some portfiles: qscintilla and py-qscintilla are one of them and are required by Qgis. 
If you are interested I can give you my diff files for portfiles.

I had to build qwt directly from sources because tweaking Macport portfiles was too painful, but I did not encounter any serious problems as far as I can remember.

No source code was needed to be patched, only compilation configurations. 

Once you get all dependencies you need to set the cmake options accordingly to the path of your installation:

Here is my defines:

»   »   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/Applications \
»   »   -DWITH_SERVER=ON \
»   »   -DWITH_PYSPATIALITE=ON \
»   »   -DPYTHON_CUSTOM_FRAMEWORK:PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework  \
»   »   -DEXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/opt/local/include \
»   »   -DEXPAT_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/lib/libexpat.dylib \
»   »   -DSQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/opt/local/include \
»   »   -DSQLITE3_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/lib/libsqlite3.dylib \
»   »   -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/bin/qmake \
»   »   -DQWT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/qwt-6.1.3/lib/qwt.framework/Versions/6/Headers \
»   »   -DQWT_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/qwt-6.1.3/lib/qwt.framework/Versions/6/qwt \
»   »   -DQCA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/opt/local/include/qca \
»   »   -DQCA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/lib/libqca.dylib \
»   »   -DQSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/include \
»   »   -DQSCINTILLA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/lib/libqscintilla2.dylib \
»   »   -DQT_LRELEASE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/opt/local/libexec/qt5/bin/lrelease \

I hope that full support for qt5 will be available from Macport soon, but for now I have managed to compile Qgis from the master branch without struggling too much. 

Best,
David

Hi Diane and welcome aboard,

I also didn't manage to compile master on osx yet.

Some more information can be found here also:

https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/pull/146#issuecomment-254011621

I think most of the dependencies should meanwhile be available on
homebrew (but not sure).

Regards
Matthias

As far as I understand, Qt 5 requires C++11, which means one must use the new libc++ library instead of the old libstdc++ (at least on my configuration, with El Capitan and clang/llvm). Some modifications are such that mixing both is not possible, so everything must be compiled from start with C++11 and libc++. Unfortunately most of the dependencies I mention above do not compile without tweaking, and I stopped doing it when it started meaning not only modifying the Makefiles but the code itself...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin for QGIS3 test
Message-ID: <e188bdd0-d195-ba63-4bdb-6dd2b6415751@duif.net>

Hi (plugin-) devs,

after upgrading my QGIS 2.18 plugin, I thought to try what I had to do
to make it a QGIS3 version.

- running scripts/2to3 on the plugin
- tweaking and fixing untill it worked :-)

it was more work then I hoped, but after setting

qgisMinimumVersion=2.99
qgisMaximumVersion=3.0

it 'just works' even without my PR [1] which make the list in the plugin
manager shorter:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.99
vs
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.0

I observe also that having two version of the same plugin works: the old
0.12 version is visible in 2.18
The new 3.0 version is visible in 3.0
And I could download/install both in both versions.

Anyway: I think good news to share :-)

NOTE: we should be aware that 3.0 api is still not fixed, so creating a
3.0 version is not guaranteed to work with the final 3.0 versions

and I do not think it is doable to make a plugin working for both 2.x
and 3.0. But feel free to find out yourself :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This is great news!

Given that you're probably the first to go through this process, I'm
very keen to hear any further feedback you have on the porting
process. What did you find hardest? Is the available api break
documentation useful? Could we make it better? Do you have any
suggestions on how we can make this process easier for plugin
developers?

I'd also like to echo your disclaimer that it's premature for general
plugin developers to start porting their plugins yet (unless they
enjoy redoing changes!). There's still many more changes planned
before 3.0 is finalised.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QEP #77 accepted - please use new style connect in
	master
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg6cgD33-0yzvGuYDsFtKk49Sd10cGg4P3ekUOjvM1-tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a heads-up that QEP #77 - "Require use of new style Qt
connections for newly added signals/slots" has been accepted.

This means that ALL newly introduced signals and slots MUST use the
new c++11/qt5 style connection syntax.

You can read more about this requirement at the QEP:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/77


Executive summary for non-devs:
QGIS will be even more stable and bug-free from now on.

How does one change 2.99 to 3.00 in the development version obtained 
from GitHub because obviously there is a big break between 2.xx and 
3.xx?

I believe the 3.00 version necessary for plugin development with Python 
3.5.2 and Qt5.7.  Or is that a mis-impression?  Something that only 
happens to people who have both version of Python 2.7.x and Python 3.5.x 
and Qt4 and Qt5?

I am still not sure if Qt5.7 has the code fixed for some kind of issue 
that isn't present in Qt4 and that maybe the reason for the delay in 
QGIS.  Is that another mis-impression?  Or has Qt5.7 got the fix 
necessary and there are still some other reasons?

Also, GDAL 2.0 is now required to build the development version, unless 
I am mistaken.  Something the install  documentation clearly didn't 
indicate.

The PyQt issue regarding API version (1 is Qt4 and 2 is Qt5), which 
popped up in debugging with Eclipse, seemed to be fixed by moving 'from 
qgis.core import *' before 'from PyQt4.QtCore *' and 'from PyQt4.QtGui 
import *'.  A fix fortunately documented by someone making more progress 
than me.
