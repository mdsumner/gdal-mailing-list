Hi again,

I just saw that also the module descriptions are missing.

Try putting the attached file into:
YOUR_QGIS_INSTALLATION\apps\qgis\python\plugins\processing\algs\grass7\description

Maybe you have to remove the line containing
ParameterSelection|return_filter in the txt to make it run properly, as I do not know if it accepts an empty string as input... I did not test it...

In order to define the map extent you will have to inspect your las-file in advance (e.g. using las-tools).

Good luck.

Stefan

Hei Jim,

Without knowing some relevant details of your system I would guess you are facing this
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/493
issue in liblas on Windows...

I know that the programs are installed with the GRASS 7.0.3 of QGIS 2.14 but they don't show up in the Processing Toolbox.

Hi,

Travis is currently not working because of a 3rd party repository being
unavailable at the moment.

You can check the status here:
http://llvm.org/apt/

Quote:
APT mirror was temporary switched off due to excess load. We are working
on bringing it back. Stay tuned!

I hope that the problems are resolved soon, if not we will look into
falling back to a compiler from a different location.

Thank you for your understanding

Would it be fair to say that non-Windows users are more likely to be able to
handle other ways around this issue? What I mean is that bundling in Windows
is probably worth looking at, as it is possibly the easiest solution for
Windows end users, and Windows users are probably more likely to be more
GIS, less dev </generalization ype="gross">. Speaking as a Windows user,
that's probably what I'd appreciate.  Apologies if I am missing any aspect
of this.

Thanks

Hi Even, 

Thank you for your time to analyze the problem. 

Unfortunately, while we can try to influence Geomedia Web Map server to
become more standard compliant (which we probably should do), it means
that we have to wait at minimum 1.5-2 years until these fixes would
become available to us - if they even accept our demand for the fixes. 

If you are willing to work on making QGIS "more tolerant" to read such
WFS, we would probably be interested in funding this work. Probably
cheaper and faster for us than trying to fix Geomedia Web Map server. On
the other hand there is an internal effort at our organization to
establish a parallel open source web map server (most likely QGIS
server) next to Geomedia or potentially replace it over time. 

I will discuss offlist with you and my colleagues to see what makes
sense in our case. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Short: It should be a dependency.

Long:
python-future is a wrapper library that allows maintaining a single
python codebase compatible with python2 and python3.
Having this available in 2.14 is important so during the transition
period to QGIS 3 plugin authors have the possibility to write plugins
that work on the last LTR and work with 3.0 without being required to
maintain two different codebases.

I am familiar with SAGA source code, and algorithms are independent
and self contained, very modular structure, so it should be easy to
use them. There is a lot of work in there, since the number of
algorithms is very large, but it can be a progressive thing. Having
the in the QGIS source code would be fantastic.

If we decide to go in this direction, we can maybe get rid of the SAGA
provider in core, and have it as a separate plugin (and maybe a ship
SAGA itself with the plugin??), for those wanting to run SAGA itself.
In core we would add native Processing algorithms that would use the
QGIS native functionality that we clone from SAGA. There is no need to
port everything, at first just the most common ones or those that have
no equivalent in other providers. Better a reduced set of robust and
commonly used algs than a large colelction of them that is not so
stable as it should.

Not sure how we can tackle this, but definitely it is an option to
consider. It would solve all issues with format conversions, etc... so
it's clearly worth a try.

My 2 cents

Cheerss

If we decide to go this way, I'd suggest to put SAGA algs
into QGIS analysis library, so we can add Python bindings
to them too. Also in this case everyone can access them
similarly to qgis.core and qgis.gui.

Hi, 

If you guys think about integrating SAGA closer into QGIS, could we also
fix the issue that SAGA is currently limited to reading Shapefiles for
vector input? Probably a lot of work - but would this be feasible? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

After last year's hackfest in Nodebo just out of curiosity I was
looking at the feasibility of replacing SAGA's native shapefile
support by OGR. IMHO it is feasible - not something for a rainy
afternoon, but maybe a project for 2-3 weeks of developer time. All
work with shapefiles is done by API calls to saga core, so it would be
a matter of reimplementing a part of the API. Similarly, raster access
could be adapted to use GDAL. We could even use directly QGIS API for
vector/raster access if we chose even tighter integration.

I think integrating SAGA tightly into QGIS would be very beneficial
for both projects:
- QGIS would finally have a native analysis engine, ending the long
time struggle with changing parameter names, data conversions, CRS
issues, algorithm naming (e.g. raster vs grid), duplication of
algorithms etc.
- SAGA source code would get more eyes of developers (increasing
quality and bringing in new algorithms) and users. SAGA devs could
focus more on algorithms as GUI side would be handled by QGIS.

This would be however best done with consent from SAGA developers, so
we do not end up with two competing projects.

Cheers
Martin

I totally agree on all the topics..

SAGA is as powerful as often not usable.. I think that seeing the SAGA 
engine ported in the QGIS one would be an extreme improvement..

Thanks for raising the topic

I think this is the most important point, maintaining a copy would
certainly not be on neither QGIS' nor on SAGA's christmas wish list!
Is there anyone with connections to the SAGA community?

Hi All,

what is the purpose of originalName() method in QgsMapLayer class?

Documentation states:
   Get the original name of the layer.
   Returns
           the original layer name

Which perhaps isn't clear enough.

Plugin developers reading the API would generally expect originalName to
preserve the name the layer was given when it was first loaded into QGIS.
And it might be so, except for this line (
http://qgis.org/api/2.14/qgsmaplayer_8cpp_source.html#l00117) that modifies
the originalName private variable.

Am I getting it wrong? Is id() supposed to fulfill such requirement?

Regards,

Germán

I think Johan van de Wauw is the person we should contact. Seems
responsive and offered to create a LTR for SAGA.

I was quite involved in the SAGA community long ago and I know the
devs personally, but haven't done much with the software itself (in
terms of development) since long ago. I think they will be in Bonn for
FOSS4G, so that might be a good moment to discuss all this. We can
start planning this if finally we decide to take this route.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] typo in blog post?
Message-ID: <574FCDA5.7080204@opengis.ch>

Hi Tim (cc list),

just reading the latest blog post, an important topic, really good to
cover this ground in a blog post like this. Thank you very much.

Just some thoughts about it:

Under the terms of this license, it is a requirement that all plugins
distributed via http://plugins.qgis.org <http://plugins.qgis.org/> (or
through other repositories that may be self-hosted) should comply with
the GPL version 2 or greater license.

 - Should that be "must comply"?
 - Why are the repositories mentioned as precondition here? I think the
current version can lead to think that distributing outside of a
repository system will void the need for a GPL license.

This license is provided with every copy of the QGIS and in the source
code and is available on our web site here.

 - Should that be "with every copy of QGIS"?

Best regards and have a nice day
Matthias

+1

if SAGA devs are not interested to merge in QGIS, I strongly suggest
to just fork a stable version shipped with qgis (as proposed in this
thread), but NOT to integrate the algs in qgis. I prefer to fix API
changes with fixed time frame (on demand) than maintaining a large
bunch of code.

cheers

SAGA already can use OGR instead of just shapefiles. By using the
module io_gdal you can load a file through OGR into memory, do your
analysis and save using the same module to any ogr file.
It does not have to be a shape file. In the gui, try dragging and
dropping an OGR supported file on saga or go through
geoprocessing>file>gdal/ogr import.

The same thing is true for raster files. There is not much error
handling if you try exotic formats, but when used correctly it works.

It will still load everything in memory again. Directly using the QGIS
api will be harder (especially when changes are made), but there are
not too many things you can do with vector/raster data. I guess most
of the required methods are probably implemented.

Best first step would be including saga-gis-developer list in this thread.

I notice a distinct lack of consideration for the SAGA LTR effort.

That removes the need to incorporate SAGA into QGIS, and provides a 
stable API for 3rd parties to work with.

I suggest to support the LTR effort by Johan van de Wauw, and only 
consider incorporating SAGA into QGIS if the LTR effort proves to not 
resolve the integration issues.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Off course I do not want to be to harsh for your users, but this is one
ot the troubles of closed source servers/software: it takes time to get
something fixed (well that is not new...) but also it is impossible to
fix/find stuff yourself too, making you totally dependent on the
company, selling you stuff.

And in name of the 'standards', I would not encourage a client (like
QGIS) to be too tolerant about the standards. Even less if it makes
our/QGIS code more complex to maintain because of all the ifs and
options to handle this.

The plan to ditch Geomedia Web Mapserver in favour of QGIS-server is off
course the preferred solution, I don't like the parallel plan too much
either. :-)

Regards,

Richard

I might be wrong but...how do you use that in the command line? We
already use io_gdal for converting formats (a step we would like to
avoid...), but the call to an actual module that does analysis can
only be made (correct me if I'm wrong) with a shapefile as input (in
the case of vector layers).

can you, for instance, call an algorithm passing a geojson file as input?

Thanks!

Hi All,

I realized that there are some Qt components in QGIS that their style are
not changed after changing the UI theme (in Settings), for example the grey
background QListWidget. Is there API to apply these default style to be
used in Python Plugin?

Cheers

All the best, and thanks to all for the interesting discussion.
Hopefully this will solve the iddue in a clean and stable way. IMHO this
would considerably improve the overall situation.

Agreed. Unfortunately most of the this thread has been about forking
SAGA, which I consider highly unproductive when the SAGA developers are
now trying to solve the integration issues with an LTR. That effort
should be applauded and supported. Forking should be the option of last
resort when the SAGA community proves unable to resolve the issue.

I personally look forward to having the SAGA LTR in Debian to help
resolve #807339 qgis: saga not available in processing toolbox.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I agree, forking is not the way to go. Fortunately the general opinion
seems to be to either have a stable API upstream (e.g. LTR) or a merge
of the two projects.

Message-ID: <8725df55-ef50-7c29-03cb-e36119d2531c@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

/me on Debian testing and finally QtWebKit is removed from Debian
testing repo's if I'm correct.

This brakes for me the (few) plugins which use QtWebKit.

Do we have a general upgrade plan for QtWebKit/Pyqt4 Debian users?

I thought that the plugin-manager (the showing of the plugin details)
would be affected too, but QGIS just works as it should do (
My own plugin I was able to fix by using a QTextBrowser widget, and some
small fixes to the html (and loading of it)...

I see processing is also fixed?

Any hints we could give python dev's?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

You are correct.

The WebKit support has been removed in python-qt4 (4.11.4+dfsg-2) which
migrated to testing on May 31st.

So I guess qgis2web's preview is broken?

Hi, i've searched in the docs and the web and cannot find
this info, just because i'd like to be sure:

Can the use of feature simplification (Option Rendering) affect
in any way my geoprocessing workflow (e.g. using clip, difference etc...)?
i ran some test and it seems it does not, i.e. geoprocessing results are
not affected by feature simplification option (as it should be I think)
Am I correct?

Thanks, Roy.

Hey Roy,

Simplification is only for display reasons. Editing will return the full
geometry or else that would be bad.

Hi, a few days ago a related pull was merged:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2900

As Nathan said, the simplification only runs in rendering tasks, but before this pull, the original geometry readed from a data source could be simplified when the "simplify" flag is defined in the QgsFeatureRequest used by a FeatureIterator.
Now the geometries never are simplified, the simplification runs using its WKB representation just before it is drawn.

Hi all,

after an  update/upgrade  of my debian stretch QGIS got uninstalled and
it is not any more possible to install it due to missing dependencies on
gdal-abi-2-0-2
gdal-abi-2-1-0 is virtual package provided by libgdal20

I am using the standard repo :
deb http://qgis.org/debian/ stretch main

Can you please change the dependencies or tell me what to do

Thanks

Thank you very mutch Nathan and Alvaro!
Now it's more clear to me, I think this
is very important:

If you have a postgis layer with $area expressions, you only can use 
local simplification

Thanks for reminding everyone Bas,

Perhaps some more info on our plans:
We plan to have a 2.3.0 release soon. This would be the first "LTR"
release, where we (I) will guarantee that no API changes will happen
in versions 2.3.x . This would be an ideal series for including in
QGis and Debian. I'll be maintaining it as long as QGis uses it.

We will also be moving to git as I believe this will help contributors
to send in patches (and helps maintaining a stable branch).

Anyway, this also means that now is the ideal time to tell us about
features you are missing as we can still have them in the LTR branch.
I've seen the question from Victor about using other filetypes from
the command line. That would be a great one to include.

As a final note: it looks like a lot of people care about SAGA. If you
do, join our list and discussions and perhaps try to contribute
somewhere (documentation, tests, bugreports). I'm convinced some
positive vibes from the QGis community will convince the core SAGA
devs that more collaboration is useful. Arrogantly saying that
something is not as you would like it does not help in that respect.

Kind Regards,
Johan

Hi all,

after an  update/upgrade  of my debian stretch QGIS got uninstalled and it
is not any more possible to install it due to missing dependencies on
gdal-abi-2-0-2
gdal-abi-2-1-0 is virtual package provided by libgdal20
<https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgdal20>

I am using the standard repo :
deb http://qgis.org/debian/ stretch main

Can you please change the dependencies or tell me what to do

Thanks

Yep, BUT: let's be honest,
Debian testing users who compile themselves ( though important ;-) ) are
few.

Nothing is broken on Windows, and I'm not even sure if the official
nightly for Testing is broken or maybe already fixed with some Juergen
magic.

So: no panic (I have other machines to use if I really need qgis2web :-) )!

Richard

The packages in the QGIS repository need to be rebuilt with the new GDAL
version in testing & unstable. These rebuilds are required every time a
new GDAL upstream release is included in Debian.

The QGIS release repositories don't generally don't get rebuilt often,
so currently your best bet is to use the nightly builds which do pick up
dependency changes.

Unfortunately due to the lack of WebKit support in Python Qt4 all QGIS
features which rely on it are broken currently. This affects both the
upstream QGIS packages as those in Debian which have been rebuilt for
the GDAL transition. There was talk of a branch with changes to deal
with the removal of WebKit from Python Qt4, but these changes have not
found their way into 2.14 LTR yet (nor have the osgEarth 2.7 changes).

Kind Regards,

Bas

This is not related to migration.

It's only Debian that decided to remove QtWebKit for Qt4 (on unstable if
I am not mistaken).
QtWebKit is available for Qt5. And on every other platform still for Qt4.

The time may eventually come when QWebEngine will be a full replacement
for QtWebKit. But as far as I know, it's not yet there.

So I'd not make any noise around the issue.

I have switched the travis builds to GCC so we are independent of the
availability of clang apt repositories for now.

I have also updated most of the missing bindings and API docs that are
currently causing the tests to fail, the missing ones should be fixed
soon and we will be back up and running with full speed towards a stable
2.16.

Have a nice weekend

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_chiBCgQ4NPd4vGqKBvd-+FtzQXT2DfyuFcHFN9MmKKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just a quick note... Continuing work I started at the hackfest in Girona, I
have successfully built and run QGIS on Mac off of Homebrew dependencies of
pyqt, sip, qwt, qwtpolar, qscintilla2 and qca specifically configured for
Qt 5 and Python 3.

http://drive.dakotacarto.com/qgis/qgis-qt5-pyqt5-py3.png
This means I am now capable of running installs of qgis2-ltr, qgis2 and
qgis3 (when branched) off of the *same* /usr/local install of Homebrew.
This also means, after some further work, we will be able to upgrade the
Mac Travis CI setup for testing both Qt4/PyQt4/Py2 and Qt5/PyQt5/Py3, as is
currently available for Linux.

While it is possible to do this using multiple isolated Homebrew installs,
that requires almost all dependencies in the non-/usr/local directory to be
compiled, instead of using the prebuilt binaries (aka 'bottles') available
from Homebrew.

Fully bundled test apps are at least a month away.

I have a PR and more Homebrew editing to do (will post more to this thread
later), but just wanted everyone to know it is at least compiling and
launching on Mac!

That's great news Larry - nice work!

I'm curious: how does the test suite look on these qt5 Mac builds? What's
failing?

See:

Not entirely sure I have the test environ set up correctly, but
  79% tests passed, 48 tests failed out of 231
isn't so bad as a starting point (I think...).

The following timed out:
PyQgsComposerHtml Failed  25m 30ms Completed (Timeout)

Most render test comparisons are close, excepting

qgis_composerlabeltest
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=41851057&build=231771
qgis_gradienttest
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=41851093&build=231771
qgis_composerpicturetest
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=41851065&build=231771

Also, about 50% of the Python test errors might be remedied with updating
to Py3 or some trivial module finding fixes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building QGIS 2.14.3 from source in Fedora 19,
 it breaks due toSegmentation fault when it runs?
Message-ID: <2b0f575267fb921-0005e.Richmail.00049426902456703897@139.com>



I try to build QGIS
2.14.3 from source in Fedora 19, but it breaks due to Segmentation
fault when it runs, so why it happens?.




The details are
as follows:  




First I run
yum-builddep qgis-2.14.3-1.fc24.src.rpm in Fedora 19, then it says
this:




PyQt4-devel




PyQwt-devel




bison




cmake




desktop-file-utils




expat-devel




fcgi-devel




flex




gdal-devel




geos-devel




grass-devel




gsl-devel




libspatialite-devel




postgresql-devel




proj-devel




python-devel




qca2-devel




qextserialport-devel




qscintilla-devel




qscintilla-python-devel




qt4-devel




qt4-webkit-devel




qwt-devel




qwtpolar-devel-1.0.1-2.fc19.1.i686




sip-devel




spatialindex-devel




sqlite-devel




 




Further I complete to install all build required
packages:

Futher more I creat a build directory and run cmake:




 




mkdir
build-master




cd build-master




cmake
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebIn ..




 




Then it says this:

I suspect you're building with deprecated code enabled. Can you change the
cmake option (I think it's "with_deprecated") and rebuild/retest?

Message-ID: <CAOnR-i++UFiy2KDXPYr0YRV0Fd+u8a0JLVGH2q4CWMjomD4TCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Here is the report for the 2nd week of GSoC

*What did you get done this week?*
This week I implemented the basic UI. I created a repository here (
https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing).  It's a QGIS
python plugin so you can clone it to your local python plugin directory to
try it. I made it similar to the Python Plugin Repositories as they both
have the same functionalities. Here is a screenshot of the UI
What it can do now is saving the repositories to the QSettings.

*What do you plan on doing next week?*
This week I will have 3 final exams and one in next monday. I will not
focus on GSoC this week. But I will start looking at fetching the metadata
file from the git repository. This metadata file contains collections
definition. After adding a connection and fetching the metadata, the tools
will save the collections defined there and save it to local db (thinking
of simple sqlite). Later this database will be used for browsing or
searching collections.

I am also going to set up Travis there (trying out the new QGIS testing
module as well).

*Are you blocked on anything?*
Not really, but I haven't figured out yet on how to fetch the metadata file
from the git repository using simple HTTP request without depending on the
host site. In Github or Bitbucket they provide a direct link to the raw
file. But I think I should look at more general approach without
manipulating the URL depending on the host. If you have some input, I would
be happy to assess it.

Cheers
​

Thanks Akbar,

I did some googling:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14405782/git-fetch-single-file-from-remote-repository-programatically
If you really want to keep it git, it looks like a shallow clone/copy is
the only way? That post also talks about some undocumented feature, but
I would not depend on that?

Personally I would be ok when both Github and Gitlab/Gog would work (as
both a closed source and open source member of the git-web-world)...

Or: a script running somewhere on our server, (shallow) cloning all
registred repositories periodically, and making just the metadata.txt
files available via http/webserver? (maybe giving us some time to check
the repo's on structure and (malicious?) content?

Or else: a django app for the metadata...

Regards,

Richard

yes, sorry for the noise, it is currently a problem for us as 'Debian
testing' users only, but the rest of the world is still ok..

@Matthias so part of the migration script/notes would be porting to
QWebEngineView/QtWebEngine from QWebview/QtWebKit

Hi,
As python-qt4 doesn't contain QtWebKit anymore, python support gets disabled when running qgis.
Only building pyqt4 from source with webkit worked. Hope this helps somebody!
I would have stayed to debian jessie but intel skylake users only have GPU support from kernel 4.3 (full support from 4.4) so I was forced to debian testing some months ago.
All the best!

No, that will not be part of the migration.

 * QtWebKit is still there and will still be there in the near future.
With Qt5 builds even on Debian testing.
 * As far as I know QtWebEngine is not yet on par with respect to features.

Hello,

Qwebengine is not in Debian yet and there is a risk that it will not be for some time: http://perezmeyer.blogspot.com/2016/05/do-you-want-qt5s-qwebengine-in-debian.html

Cheers...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has
 no attribute 'update'
Message-ID: <HE1PR1001MB0906FE41C0AEF511975BFD70A75B0@HE1PR1001MB0906.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi all,
adding a tool to the the graphical modeler I got the error “AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'update' ”. In other discussions on the web it seems due to an algorithm not properly working within the sequence.

I tried then:

-          to remove the last tool

-          To substitute the algoritms with similar ones,

-          removing one tool a time,
but still the error persists.

any idea?

Thank you in advance!
All the best,

Nic

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Sorting a Layer Selector
Message-ID: <CAFTGJ2Cpow5qFt6Mw_tdPuUuYTPp5PU=ct6LkUv8d-Eo9Y4NBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I had a feature request through for a python plugin to sort layer
drop-down lists alphabetically:

https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/QGIS_Centroid_Within/issues/3

This is a list of vector layers that are open, that are selected using
a QComboBox QT drop-down. I get the layers using:

layers = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values()

Before adding them to the QT dialog:

for layer in layers:
            if layer.type() == QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer:
                self.dlg.selectWithCombo.addItem( layer.name(), layer )
                self.dlg.selectFromCombo.addItem( layer.name(), layer )

I would like to sort these layers based on their name, so layer.name().

I got as far as sorting by name:
layers.sort(key=operator.methodcaller("name"), reverse=False)

However this is case sensitive, with upper case appearing first. Does
anyone know of a plugin that implements sorting? Or an easy way to do
it. If all else fails I can revert back to case sensitive sorting.

-Heikki

Why not use QgsMapLayerComboBox instead? This has sorting built in, and
will help your plugin match the standard QGIS layer selector behaviour.

Hi Nyall,

That seems like a great solution. I can get the combo boxes looking as
expected with ordering an layer type indicators.

Do you have an example of getting the selection results from that, or
a plugin that is currently using it?

With the QComboBox I use:

index1 = self.dlg.selectWithCombo.currentIndex()
selecting_layer = self.dlg.selectWithCombo.itemData(index1)
index2 = self.dlg.selectFromCombo.currentIndex()
select_from_layer = self.dlg.selectFromCombo.itemData(index2)

# Either select with all features or just selected ones
selected_test = self.dlg.selectedFeaturesCheckbox.isChecked()
if selected_test == 1:
       selecting_feats = selecting_layer.selectedFeatures()
   else:
       selecting_feats_iterator = selecting_layer.getFeatures()

Changing my boxes to QgsMapLayerComboBox results in:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/heikk/.qgis2/python/plugins\SelectWithin\select_within.py",
line 217, in run
    selecting_feats_iterator = selecting_layer.getFeatures()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getFeatures'

Another advantage is that the built in box automatically handles layer
removal and additions, without any extra code required :)

Use QgsMapLayerComboBox.currentLayer()

(see https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayerComboBox.html#ae2ca2dd3e8cbc81cf0e19244e63efe5a)

Hey Nyall,

That seems to have work perfectly.

My code is condensed to:
selecting_layer = self.dlg.selectWithCombo.currentLayer()
select_from_layer = self.dlg.selectFromCombo.currentLayer()

Making much of the former functions of.

Clearing:

self.dlg.selectWithCombo.clear()
self.dlg.selectFromCombo.clear()

And populating :
for layer in layers:
if layer.type() == QgsMapLayer.VectorLayer:
self.dlg.selectWithCombo.addItem( layer.name(), layer )
self.dlg.selectFromCombo.addItem( layer.name(), layer )

Redundant.

Thanks for the help!

-Heikki

Hi Akbar,

The most flexible installation tool that I know is probably python pip.

pip can install software from a zip file, from git and from other sources
too.

I'd suggest you to have a look to pip implementation of the install
functionality, maybe there is some interesting for you.

Hi Larry,

Nice work, thanks a lot!

There is also the option -DPORT_PLUGINS=ON which is required to get the
processing tests to pass (and make a lot of the plugin functionality
compatible).

Is there any chance one could test the qgis-qt5 formulae?

Matthias

It's a question of timing. I understand that testing is not a commonly used
environment. However, it indicates that QtWebkit's end is getting closer.
And with QWebEngine not yet here, it's just a bit of a concern as to when I
should start looking at replacing the former with the latter.

Right now is too early - it's not available for any platform with Qt4, so for 2.x it's out of reach. As long as someone wants to maintain a 2.x compatible version of his plugin, just stick to QtWebKit.

For plugins developed against only QGIS 3.x it will be an option if it suits the needs for the particular purpose. But we should neither recommend (let alone require) replacing QtWebKit with QtWebEngine for now.

Once we have collected enough knowledge about QtWebEngine and QtWebKit really starts to disappear from supported platforms we can start recommend porting code. I don't know when that will be but I don't expect this to happen in the next year.

Sorry to labour the point: so QtWebKit is present in Qt5, and hence will be
available in QGIS3?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lizmap-Web-Client - Release version 3.0.0
Message-ID: <57556BDF.5000100@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I'm proud to annouce the release of Lizmap Web Client version 3.0.0.

This release is a big step for Lizmap. We reviewed the core of Lizmap Web Client to enhance modularity. We updated the map UI and the edition tool.
We added WMTS to publish cached layers as WMTS layer with a seeding tool in cli. We enhanced the attribute table with relations management and export capabilities.

We also enhanced the way to manage Lizmap translation workflow with a transifex project. Now Lizmap is fully localized in: French, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and German and 2 new
languages has been added: Polish and Russian.

Take a look at Michaël presentation at the QGIS International Conference in Girona to review all the features:
http://mdouchin.github.io/lizmap-presentation/index_en.html

The release is available on github:
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/releases/tag/3.0.0

Thanks to all the lizmap contributors to help doing this release!

Hi,

I often experience rather long waiting times when opening the plugin
manager when it's waiting for the official plugin repository.
Just before the request timed out.

Also when opening it in a browser it takes several seconds:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.15

Is this a local issue or do others experience the same?

Matthias

Recently Ale and Richard made a patch to fix an issue that made the server
down. The patch includes changing the view to provide the XML to request
the file directly from cached XMLs. But the cached XMLs are only generated
for the even minor version (2.12, 2.14, etc). So, for the odd minor
version, it will generate the XMLs instead of using the cached ones.

Cheers

Hi Matthias,

We (mostly Alessandro) actually just implmented a caching feature for this:
- once every 10 minutes we ask for the plugins.xml of all release
versions, and cache those on disk. We made the descision to NOT cache
2.15 with the idea that for developers it was maybe better to just get
the live created xml...

BUT (and I agree with you) this makes the

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.15
(8secs)

pretty slow compared to:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.14
(1 to 3 secs)

(it is > 1Mb)

We can off course add the latest dev version to the list of cached xml's...

Ale? Opinion?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes, I think it's better to add it too.

There is still a way to retrieve the uncached version if one really needs
it.

Thanks a lot.

Did someone look into gzip as well? This reduces the download size from
1M to 100K, a noticeable performance improvement.

My qgis misses pyspatialite module when it runs in Fedora 19. But I can't find "pyspatialite" package in the URL http://rpm.pbone.net/, so what is the name for "pyspatialite" package in fedora 19?

pyspatialite is not packaged for Fedora (only libspatialite, 
spatialite-tools & spatialite-gui).

On Fedora you should use the embedded copy included in the QGIS source.

I meant: it is active on the server.

I don't know if it's used by the plugin manager.

Not necessarily if the web server is applying the the gzip the savings
is only in the transfer, after a delay on the server to compress. Also
note this may not be a good idea if we want to move to https due to a
known flaw in some web servers where gzip makes secret keys predictable.

When you made the cache, did you put the cached copy in RAM? Using
something like memcached here might make sense. The other easy fix when
available (might not be on this particular machine) is a to put the
cache on solid state disks.

I've also been thinking that at some point the plugins lookup and
downloads should be mirrored and load balanced for performance. Note
just the download aspect, I think running the website/upload out of one
place works fine. So just some sort of backend rsync cron could do.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi

I think it is enabled on both sides, at least that's what measurements
indicate. My previous assumptions that it's not enabled were based on
Richards statement about the size of 1MB.

@Alex, we are already using https by default, do you have any chance to
verify if we are affected by the mentioned security flaw?

Matthias

We might be ok because there's no authentication cookies in the plugin
lookup, at least for our Public repo. For those entities running private
authenticated repos this could be an issue.

Hello everybody,

I just compiled QGIS with QT5 and Pyhton 3 to run some tests.
Where should I report eventual problems? Can I use the standard bug
tracking system?

Thanks a lot
Ciao

Hi Luca,

Good to see that this gets some traction.

There are certainly issues and it is very good to have this tested. Most
appreciated will be pull requests but bugs on the official tracker will
be fine as well..

But be aware that at the moment the main focus is still on Qt4/Python2
stability for 2.16, so we can only push patches where we can be sure
that they play also well with this setup.

Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Layer Search Plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTq4WiiEnikkxA_hqBWwRepRrq5+ymObHhxFkWz+EwO1kQ@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if someone in this group would be interested in giving some
feedback on a plugin I have been writing. I have uploaded it to the QGIS
plugins directory, but it has not been approved yet.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/layersearch/

The intent with this plugin is to be able to search all contents of all
vector layers loaded into QGIS. It will search all layers and all table
columns. It has similar capabilities to the ArcGIS search. The existing
QGIS search plugins seem to have different focuses which is the reason I
wrote this, but should this capability be integrated into some other
plugin? The closest plugin I can find is "Quick Finder" but it seems to
have a different focus. I like that plugin for its
nominatim service which is excellent, but its layer searching does not work
like mine and would be a pain to use for the purpose I wrote this plugin.
MMQGIS also has a search, but not for all layers and columns.

I would personally prefer keeping it as a separate plugin, but what do you
think? Should it be integrated with another plugin?


Thanks,

C. Hamilton

do we want to make that url public?

or should we maybe make
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=master
or
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.99
work like that?

I did not realize that the plugin repository does not show it unless it is
public or you are the owner. You can look at it from github. Just download
it, rename the folder to layersearch and drop it into your QGIS plugins
folder.

Yep, but you can also wait for the approver(s) to find some time to have
a look into it and approve it (making it public), or else he/she will
contact the author to check for certain details (like info about author,
repo or issue tracker etc etc)

Approving is often not more then a couple of days (often faster)

Richard

Thank you very much! But would you please tell me how to use the embedded copy included in the QGIS 2.14.3 source. I can't figure it out by myself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pyspatialite is not packaged for Fedora (only libspatialite, 


spatialite-tools & spatialite-gui).





On Fedora you should use the embedded copy included in the QGIS source.

Have you tried the instructions from the INSTALL file, it documents the
build procedure for Fedora too?

 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL#L366

If you look through the CMake options, you'll find WITH_PYSPATIALITE
which you need to enable to have the embedded copy built along with the
rest of QGIS.

Kind Regards,

Bas

It seems like it has value over the other plugins. Another issue I’ve had is searching all layer fields and pushing the query filter down the provider (e.g PostGIS or WFS) to increase the performance and usability. Using the approach of iterating through all features client side with a large dataset can be a killer in terms of bandwidth, memory and time. Does your new plugin do that? If so then it would be really useful :)

The linked section about Fedora lists build instructions for Qt5 which
is still experimental and probably not what you want.

But the rest of the document contains a lot of useful information.

No, I wouldn't make it public.

I don't see many real use cases for that, you can easily serve your own
plugins.xml XML if you need to control the endpoint.

... or just look at the source code and guess what the uncached URL looks
like :)

Hi,

Is there someone who really needs these notifications?

I think nobody responded to the last request to speak up if someone is
actually using these.
And that some developers have put it already on their spam filter speaks
for itself.

Thank you for reevaluating the necessity of these

Hrmpf, my procmail rule only catches mails from plugins.qgis.org - not

Well, I don't mind if my otherwise unnoticed work is visible.
More seriously, I think it is good if developers have a chance not to miss new plugins. Surprisingly, some dev reimplemented existing plugins because they didn't know, so some extra noise could be useful.
All the best.

Hi all,

I think it is not really profitable to have multiple plugins. In my
opinion, efforts must be made to merge plugins when possible. In this case,
we have

* Quick Finder : Full Text Search is used here, which allows fuzzy search,
and is very efficient compared to scanning all features for a match. A
drawback, you must fill in the "FTS vectors" for each layer you want to be
able to search within. I think it is not so bad because the process is
fast. I also think there is nothing preventing to add more than one field
in the search ( it is possible with FTS in PostgreSQL, must also be the
case with sqlite)

* Layer search : Great to have a quick way to search among all the fields
of all loaded layers, with no configuration. Drawback : I think this can be
very slow for big datasets, and it is not "fuzzy", as regexp are used while
iterating on each feature. Another drawback : for external vector sources
like PostgreSQL, all features must been fetched !

IMHO, the way to go could be

* Add the FTS pregenerator of Quick Finder in Processing, as an alg
available for anyone to use
* Add the FTS search of Quick Finder as a Processing Alg
* Add the "layer search" worker as an Alg in Processing
* Have a combined plugin which let the user choose the search type : FTS
with pregeneration, or direct search with features iteration. This will
then run the corresponding alg

Cheers,
Michaël

Hi all,
I suspended approval because I' like to examine the possibility of
reducing the overlap with the functionally similar QuickFind plugin.
I hope that this discussion will bring us there soon.
QuickFind devs, anyone there?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all,

Sorry I'm a bit short on time to answer lately.
I definitely think we can merge the two and love Michael's ideas.

I will try to summarize a bit by tomorrow.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server performance deterioration
Message-ID: <5756D2FE.7020808@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

David Marteau, our colleague in 3Liz, has found some serious 
deteriorations of performance in QGIS Server.

The first one concerne QgsExpressionContext which is not clean up in 
QgsServer::handleRequest

Each call to QgsMapLayer::draw add items to QgsExpressionContext scope.
The scope is not cleaned between request and thus the scope list to grow 
indefinitely.

Having the list growing indefinitely deteriorate seriously performances 
in the long run. It also increase the memory footprint but in a less 
noticiable way.

This behavior has been checked by monitoring reponse time of several ten 
of thousand identical requests during server long runs.

This has been fixed in master and in LTR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/5c3aa51e80887de6ff76682a42814041bb32cd5b
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/50181eee00709e3f7e29b2b53282f28bdedfe265

Now we encounter an other issue with deteriorationof performance in QGIS 
Server.

This issue is due to the slot 'layerWasAdded' in QgsMapLayerRegistry. 
The duration of the emit layerWasAdded grows with the number of drawing. 
Do you know what it is done when 'layerWasAdded' is emitted ?

Regards,
René-Luc D'Hont

Thanks to all for this interesting discussion. I'll wait until a firm
conclusion is reached before publishing the new plugin - I apologize for
the delay, I think it is in the best interest of the project.
All the best.

Worse than this, project switching in QGIS 2.14.3 is broken; it
produces segmentation fault.

Hi Paolo,

Your work on plugin management is highly appreciated!
But at least I didn't find out that it's you doing this job by means of
these notifications but by handwritten emails of yours giving
interesting insights into the process and thoughts about it.

But at least I know now that there's a VetEpiGISstat plugin of which
I've got no idea what it does, nor who wrote it nor who reviewed it.

More seriously, having notifications in one place with targetted
subscriptions (an rss feed or a separate mailing list) and more
information about the plugin would be much more valuable. For this list
as well as for people interested in plugin releases but not in all the
other talk on qgis-devel.

All the best
Matthias

Hi Luca,

How did you measure it ?
Which part of QGIS Server is slower ?
Have you do some fixes ?

Thank you all for your comments. I confess this is the first QGIS plugin
that I have written, but did so at the request of a group of individuals
who need this capability and have it this easy to work with. I have already
received a pull request that has made what I did better.

This is the type of capability we need so if it makes more sense to merge
into the QuickFind plugin that is great. It has still achieved its purpose.
What is important to me is the ease of use and that I don't loose any of
this functionality. I am happy to help out in any way possible.

All the best.

Hi all,
could it be an idea to add somewhere on the “about plugins“ page:

1.       An advice to “check for improvements before creating new and get in contact with the author”,

2.       And/or an additional page (read-only for users) dealing with “proposed merges” where , the qgis developers who are testing more plugins similar to each other, can resume which features can be collected and from where.

Topic


-          Plugin 1


-          Feature 1

-          Feature 2


-          Plugin 2


-          Feature 1

-          Feature 2


In the latter case, after a while, it could be then useful to send a general email to the plugin devs to get in contact with each other according to the “clustered scheme” that dinamically will be created. Plugin developers will still be free to keep their own plugin but, at least, it can stimulate the more collaborative ones. A sort of coordination proposal about what the project “needs”.
In the worst  case, it may work as a general framework for future funded (?) projects.

All the best,

Nic

Message-ID: <CANVKczNmiK5mO6ZH5g+bsBdhiirYo+PAjTtNT1iApZt4tsxD9w@mail.gmail.com>

Ive just bought a Dell XPS13 which came with Ubuntu 14.04
pre-installed. The screen is 3200 pixels across. Getting applications
to scale properly is a nightmare.

QGIS (and I guess all Qt apps) seems to be the worst. The icons are
microscopic, and the text and other interface elements overlap. It is
unusable. Same for Gimp and Inkscape, but I mostly use QGIS.

I've tried a couple of things: "xrandr --scale" ends up with very slow
performance and poor graphics quality; the scaling slider in the
display settings seems only to work with gnome apps.

Any other suggestions? Can I get QGIS to use larger icons? Do I really
have to wait until QGIS adopts Qt 5.6 which, says the internet, has
proper support for high resolution displays? Or do I have to run my
screen at lower resolution?

Message-ID: <466F23B0-6F6E-4B5A-B43C-056DBDE76B43@qgis.org>

Hi All

2.16 is coming soon:

2.15 in feature freeze since 03 June 2016 at 14:00:00 SAST
Time until packaging 2016/07/08 12:00:00 UTC 30d 14h 54m   
Time until next pointrelease 2016/07/08 12:00:00 UTC 30d 14h 54m  

I have started a new changelog for 2.16. If you have written a cool new feature for 2.16 could you help me by writing up a little entry for it at: http://changelog.inasafe.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/

We recently overhauled the authentication system on the site so you should be able to log in / sign up - if you previously had trouble doing so, please try again.

If you have any problems submitting your entries, please file a ticket here and we will try to sort it out ASAP. Use this tracker for tickets: https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues 

If you don’t want to sign up to create your entries, feel free to send me an email and I will add it for you. Please use this string in your subject line so that I can easily filter those messages : [QGIS CHANGELOG]

Don’t worry if you are not a native english speaker, I will clean up whatever text you submit.

Please try to describe your feature well enough that we can actually replicate it here - we will make screenshots etc. of the feature but that is hard to do if you don’t supply needed sample data sets or instructions on how to use your new feature.

Don’t forget to add sponsor and developer names and links if you have them and want to give appropriate credits.

Also remember that you can do video embeds now so if you can make short clips of your features that would be good too.


Any other problems, queries etc. please feel free to contact me!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What transformation is QGIS using from NAD27 to
	WGS84?
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GHMDXuj0oOu2G7bvkQeHnabM_sAO07JBgtchoYEykkqA@mail.gmail.com>

We are having some problems loading a WMS layer pushed to Geoserver with
NAD27 (EPSG:4267), When it is opened in QGIS, it shows a shift of around 20
m. My doubt here is, what are the parameters QGIS is using to this
transformation?

Looking into qgis's srs.db, the prefered transformation is one with the 7
parameters of molodensky transformation, can I assume that that's what it's
being used if not asked to the user?

How about grids? In Osgeo4w installation seems to be a few grids available
in the shared folder including a "conus" file that could be useful for
transformation. Could we use it?

Thanks!

QGIS works pretty well (with some minor glitches) in KDE on 4K and retina
screens, see the tips and the links in this article
http://www.itopen.it/qgis-and-qt-getting-ready-for-hidpi-screens/

No, try setting:
- the dpi resolution in the display configuration of your OS (system
settings), that is usually a wrapper for xrandr
- for QT5, the env vars  QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO=2 and/or
QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS=2
- icon size in QGIS can be (at least in part, for the toolbar) configured
in the QGIS options dialog

Dear all,

Indeed, the layer search offers something Quickfinder doesn't: searching
on all layers without any configuration, and the use of operators.
Although I think choosing an operator in a global search is not very
required (why doing price < 1000 on all layers, there is a pretty good
chance you know what layer you're looking for).

From this, I think Michael's idea is pretty good.
Make QuickFinder just a search bar in the application toolbar. Then you
can register any search process to it, which would be a processing alg:
might be OSM, FTS or Layer search.

I would definitely be ok to do so for QuickFinder.
But the question is when... It would take me a bit of time to reorganize
the plugin, make FTS generation and search as processing algs (never
done that before). I won't be able to achieve this before August.

So...is this fair to ask someone to wait that long for a dev and then
ask to modify its code to fit in? I have no answer, it's a real question.


Best wishes,
Denis


PS: yes, QuickFinder FTS search handles multiple columns as it supports
expressions (you can concatenate the columns).

Maybe cooperating on the same code base will make things much quicker
and more robust?
All the best, and thanks.

Indeed asking to move the process to processing would a first step.
Integrating this in QuickFinder shouldn't be too hard.

I am available to discuss technical details, but I would need support
for the processing part.

Best wishes,

Denis

I'm not really sure I see what moving to processing gives us in this case?
Why even make the user make the index files?

If it's integrated into core you can just generate the index on project
open like i do in Roam.  I just spin up a thread and make the index.  Just
have some place the user can config the search options but that can right
in the search bar itself.

I just read pip code base. I think I can pick something from there for
downloading the resources. But the problem I have right now is to get only
the metadata file from the repository. Or are you suggesting that when
users add a repository connection, it also downloads the repository
directly?

If you are working on the git repos you can probably fetch just one file
without cloning the whole repo, I did not test it but here are probably
some pointers:

Yes, I have tried it. We can do it with sparse checkout, but, it requires
git on the client.

Wasn't that a requisite? If we are going to use git as a storage we need a
git client (pure python seems to exist, could be used as a fallback in case
git is not installed in the system) https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich .

BTW: if you do not want to deal with git in this first task, you could used
the zip endpoint, and assume that the metadata will be available at a known
location in the remote http repo and just wget it.

Ok. I was just trying to find solution that could work out well without
having git (as from the last discussion with Martin, it's better to avoid
using git for now). I will try pygit2 and dulwich and I'll report you back
what I thought using those two.

You mean
	http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/
I think?

Sorry about that, yes its the same thing, just different URL aliases. But yes it will be better to use the QGIS domain one in this context.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build issue on Ubuntu 16.04 xenial with
	release-2_14 : crssync target failed
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5H=K-DD-f6=dTTLzk7xKvd7ScP00+332_09xD3YwJA_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am trying to build QGIS release-2_14 in my Ubuntu 16.04. I have installed
dependencies listed in the INSTALL.md file, and tried it with a clean build
directory and ccache emptied

I use QGIS official repo
deb       http://qgis.org/debian xenial main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian xenial main


Here is my ccmake cl :

cd /home/mdouchin/src/qgis/build/2_14/
ccmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/mdouchin/src/qgis/build/2_14
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_TESTS=False
-DWITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR=True -DWITH_SERVER=True -DWITH_GRASS=False
-DWITH_GRASS7=False ../../source/QGIS/

Here are the errors during the build process

src/crssync/CMakeFiles/crssync.dir/build.make:112 : la recette pour la
cible « output/bin/crssync » a échouée

I have no really other helpfull erros here. Has anyone had problem with
crssync with last ubuntu ?


Thanks in advance
Michaël

I just tested if with one proc only, which helps to see the errors. Here
they are

Ok, I think I found the issue. I have a problem with GDAL

gdalinfo --formats

returns

gdalinfo: error while loading shared libraries: libnetcdf.so.7: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

Here are the command lines used to make gdalinfo happy (quite hackish ... )

ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgif.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgif.so.4
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnetcdf.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnetcdf.so.7
echo "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/qgis.conf
ldconfig

Now gdalinfo does not complain anymore, but the build does not succeed
either, see

Please don't ever create your own library symlinks, this is always 
wrong.

You need to rebuild your GDAL with the currently installed dependencies, 
as it looks like you upgraded the system packages but never rebuilt your 
custom GDAL after you upgraded your Ubuntu system to xenial.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,

Thanks for your answer.
It appears I built gdal on year ago to check GeoJson write capabilities in
QGIS.

Now, I have indeed just upgraded to last Ubuntu xenial, and I am trying to
get rid of old GDAL build and reinstall GDAL from repositories. So I
removed all symlinks made earlier today, I remove old Gdal build, remove
all lines concerning GDAL in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/. I ran ldconfig

Then uninstalled qgis and gdal-bin + libgdal and others, restarted my
computer

It still does not work.
mdouchin at mdouchin-Lenovo-U41-70:~$ ldd /usr/local/bin/gdalinfo | grep "not
found"
    libnetcdf.so.7 => not found
    libgif.so.4 => not found

I will do some more googling....

Yves, thanks for your answer

It appears I had 2 gdal installed :

one by qgis from qgis.org repository ( 1.11) which corresponds to
/usr/lib/libgdal.so
and one installed via apt-get install gdal-bin from repositories (2.1)
which corresponds to : /usr/local/lib/libgdal.so

So I changed GDAL lib directory and gdal-config path in ccmake, and run the
build again. It should do the trick

I will report back if this solves the issue I had

You got this the wrong way around, the package gdal is installed in 
/usr/lib, you custom build in /usr/local/lib.

The /usr/local hierarchy is reserverd for the local administrator, /usr 
for the system.

Hi all,

Setting the compilation variables via ccmake to point to libgdal 1.11.3
worked like a charm. QGIS 2.14 has successfully been built against gdal
1.11.3

Bas, you are right, I inverted them in my previous email. Here are the vars
used in ccmake to build QGIS successfully on my machine

GDAL_CONFIG                      /usr/bin/gdal-config
GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR                 /usr/include/gda
GDAL_LIBRARY                     /usr/lib/libgdal.so

Thanks again, both Bas and Yves, for you kind help

Cheers
Michaël

If you install Gdal from package, why do you have such path to your gdal: 
/usr/local/bin/gdalinfo 

How did you clean up gdal build? "make clean" don't remove gdal installation, 
you should remove the directory by hand.

With these discussions I want to make it clear what the LayerSearch plugin
use is intended for and what it is not.


What it is:

1. It provides the user the ability to search all layers and all fields
against a particular search string. It may be that the user already knows
the layer he is interested in, but that is not always the case. It is
possible that the user has a number of layers that contain similar data. I
really do intend for it to search multiple layers, but LayerSearch has the
ability to select a single layer and single column if desired.

2. It does not require any pre configuration other than the search feature
and whether you want an exact match, a match at the beginning of a data
field, or a match anywhere in the data.

3. The resulting matches display what layer and column the match was found
in and by clicking on the match QGIS will zoom to that feature.

4. While searching on a large data set you can click an explore the found
features even while it is still searching.



What it is not:

The fastest search engine in the world. It is not meant to be used to
search a reference data set like Quick Finder does. I would not want it to
do any pre indexing or pre configuration. That is not its purpose. I just
tried a geonames data set with 2.2 million records,  LayerSearch completed
the task in 45 seconds on my laptop. That is acceptable to me. In the mean
time I was able to look at the matches it was finding. Even though I say
this, I am interested in optimizing it to be as fast as possible, but I
don't what the user to have to index the data or do any pre configuration
first.



BTW when you talk about moving to "Processing" what are you talking about?
Are you talking about the Processing toolbox or something else? I am new to
the development side of QGIS.

All the best,

Calvin

Hi Devs,

I found which object is connected to QgsMapLayerRegistry through 
layerWasAdded slot in QGIS Server, and it's QgsEditorWidgetRegistry !

The method mapLayerAdded is apply to the layer added:
```
void QgsEditorWidgetRegistry::mapLayerAdded( QgsMapLayer* mapLayer )
{
   QgsVectorLayer* vl = qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( mapLayer );

   if ( vl )
   {
     connect( vl, SIGNAL( readCustomSymbology( const QDomElement&, 
QString& ) ), this, SLOT( readSymbology( const QDomElement&, QString& ) ) );
     connect( vl, SIGNAL( writeCustomSymbology( QDomElement&, 
QDomDocument&, QString& ) ), this, SLOT( writeSymbology( QDomElement&, 
QDomDocument&, QString& ) ) );
   }
}
```

Could a method call `mapLayerWillBeRemoved` be added ?

Maintaining such a page is quite time consuming, and I cannot afford it.
What I regularly do is to suggest, directly to the developer, a merge
before approving new plugins, any time I see a potential for it.
This has met some very nice success.

All the best.

Hi Devs,

I have created a PR: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3186

QgsEditorWidgetRegistry connects to appropriate signals from map layers 
to load and save style but never disconnects its. In the context of QGIS 
Server, layers are connecting to appropriate signals at each request.

Thanks to review it.

Regards,

Hmm I had more than minor glitches. The problem is that there were so
many possible things to tweak I could never be sure what was helping!

Since those are all Qt5 things they're no good with QGIS at the
moment, yes? Or is there a QGIS built against Qt5.6+ that I could be
using?

 I've got the icons scaled up now, but there's still some tiny UI
elements - the visibility toggles on layers, and the little plus signs
that expand trees are almost invisible...

thanks for the tips

(unfortunately) No suggestions for improvement except for setting that sentence as first and highlighting it as much as possible :)



The additional page was absolutely not meant to be on your shoulders but up to each developer with valid access, as a sort of “blackboard for notes”. When someone is testing more plugins dealing with a specific topic and finds similar functionalities, he can just add his notes as a reminder (open to the public). Pretty “informal”, let’s say, but useful to cluster plugins according to the effort of everyone who wants to contribute, instead of basing everything on your exclusive knowledge of each plugin.



Thanks for your time,



Niccolò

Hi Ale,

I just tried Dulwich. There are three ways that I see to checkout a single
file: git sparse checkout, git archive, or shallow clone (still cloning all
files though).

With git sparse checkout, Dulwich does not provide the porcelain-level API.
The author says that it's possible though (
https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich/issues/405#issuecomment-224579678). I am
not sure how much work to implement it dealing with the git object, tree,
and blob itself at the plumbing level.

With git archive, unfortunately Github doesn't allow us to do this (
https://twitter.com/GitHubHelp/status/322818593748303873). WIth shallow
clone left, I feel that I would over-engineer it forcing to use git just to
be able to do this. I think it's more simple if for now we use the raw
endpoint for each hosts that we know (Github, Bitbucket, etc), and we add
more supported hosts as users put the collection in other hosts as long as
we know the URL to the raw metadata file.

What do you think?

Cheers

Using the raw end point sounds fine to me for now. Easy to change later if
needed.

What it is:
1. It provides the user the ability to search all layers and all fields against a particular search string. It may be that the user already knows the layer he is interested in, but that is not always the case. It is possible that the user has a number of layers that contain similar data. I really do intend for it to search multiple layers, but LayerSearch has the ability to select a single layer and single column if desired.
2. It does not require any pre configuration other than the search feature and whether you want an exact match, a match at the beginning of a data field, or a match anywhere in the data.
3. The resulting matches display what layer and column the match was found in and by clicking on the match QGIS will zoom to that feature.
4. While searching on a large data set you can click an explore the found features even while it is still searching.




Not possible to consider pushing the query filter down the provider?

What it is not:
The fastest search engine in the world. It is not meant to be used to search a reference data set like Quick Finder does. I would not want it to do any pre indexing or pre configuration. That is not its purpose. I just tried a geonames data set with 2.2 million records,  LayerSearch completed the task in 45 seconds on my laptop. That is acceptable to me. In the mean time I was able to look at the matches it was finding. Even though I say this, I am interested in optimizing it to be as fast as possible, but I don't what the user to have to index the data or do any pre configuration first.



BTW when you talk about moving to "Processing" what are you talking about? Are you talking about the Processing toolbox or something else? I am new to the development side of QGIS.


Cheers
Jeremy

Hi Barry,

I also have the developer edition of the XPS 13. I've replaced ubuntu
14.04 with Fedora 23, but I think changing the following settings
should work for you too. Change the Style, Icon size, and Font sizes
in QGIS under Settings -> Options.

Changing the Style from GTK+ to Adwaita fixed some of the issues with
drop-downs, buttons, and cell sizes in the attribute table cutting off
the text. You may not have that problem though; I can't remember if
that issue came before or after the switch to Fedora/Gnome 3.

Changing the font size to 11 and the icon size to 48 works for me and
feels pretty 'standard'. Since making those changes QGIS is working
wonderfully on the XPS 13.

Hope that helps!
Eric

Thank you very much! I have solved this problem!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Have you tried the instructions from the INSTALL file, it documents the
build procedure for Fedora too?

 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL#L366

If you look through the CMake options, you'll find WITH_PYSPATIALITE
which you need to enable to have the embedded copy built along with the
rest of QGIS.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I see! Thanks a lot!---------------------------------------------------------------------The linked section about Fedora lists build instructions for Qt5 which
is still experimental and probably not what you want.

But the rest of the document contains a lot of useful information.

Message-ID: <9914339a-03eb-a5c7-1a7d-fc50d22442a8@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
over time, we have accumulate a number of plugins for geocoding. Some of
them are global some are limited to a particular country. See e.g.
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeoCoding/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeoCodingKorea/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/navidata/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pdokbaggeocoder/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ru_geocoder/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/geopunt4Qgis/
https://github.com/sookoll/qgis_plugin_inads_geocoder/
IMO it would be fare preferable to have a general mechanism, better in
core, and let people add their services there.
So the question:
* given the variety of geocoding services, si this feasible and would it
make sense?
* is any of the geocoding plugin developer willing to take this?
All the best, and thanks.

In my experience, these pages are nice to start with, but soon they
become full of cruft and difficult to maintain. Even worse, since they
may contain useful info, nobody is really willing to rase them, so we
are left with a number of obsolete info around. IMHO this will only work
if there is someone willing to maintain it.
All the best, and thanks.

What about implement GDAL geocoding capabilities in core?

It should probably be implemented as an expression function too...

http://www.gdal.org/ogr__geocoding_8h.html
See: http://www.itopen.it/geocoding-with-gdal/

I don't see any real opportunity to merge the plugins: some of them are
very specific to national geocoders, some other just ignore the TOS of the
webservices they use.

this seems a very good idea. do you have a rough estimate of how much
work is necessary for this?

yes, this is clear to me. even if not much code is shared, from the user
point of view having a single menu, with a coherent interface where to
find all the services, would certainly be good.
for instance, the qgis2web was born in this way, and I believe it is a
good success.

All the best, and thanks for your thoughts.

Any plugin which uses a single provider, and breaks its TOS should be
removed from the repo, I believe.

we do have some grey areas, solved in various ways by individual devs.
Please point us which are breaking rules, and we'll try to fix them.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature-request issues with
	cuases-crash-or-corruption ON
Message-ID: <20160609100056.GB5731@localhost>

Looking for the next bug to tackle I found 3 feature-request tickets
that have the "causes-crash-of-corruption" flag set to on:

 #13303
 #13336
 #14627

But there's no way to drop the "cuases crash or corruption" flag,
do you know how to fix ? Take this, for example:

 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13303

It was changed from a "Feature request" to a "Bug report"
while at the same time setting "Causes crash or corruption" to No,
then "Causes crash or corruption" was set to Yes and finally
was changed again to "Feature request", making it impossible
to change the flag.

I guess it takes changing the tracker back to "bug report", toggling
the flag again and changing back, but can't see a way to change the
tracker either.

Jurgen, how did you change the tracker 9-8 months ago ?

Thanks for bringing this up Paolo!

I can add my 'pdokserviceplugin' to te list too :-)
And MMQGIS plugin also has geocoder functionality

Part of my plugin's interface is a 'search-bar' with which you do a
quick geocode->zoomto action

It is modelled to the 'search'-bar of Firefox: just fill with an addres
and <enter>.

Bottom part of:
http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1465466009.png

What about something like that:
- we creating a gui-widget/toolbar for a geocoding search
- we create a python api for it (actually: implement a buttonless plugin
which registres the geocoder, and registres some slot/signals and does
(part of) implementation)
- by installing this plugin(s) you registre one or more geocoders, AND
the plugin author actually implements the calling/retrieving/parsing of
the results. We can maybe do some general standards in core (or via
gdal): like OGC-OpenLS interface, or OSM-based ones or so
- the core-geocoder gui then can look like the search bar in Firefox
Upper part of:
http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1465466009.png
a little dropdown in which you can select WHICH geocoder you run by default
- this core geocoder widget can then also implement a small 'multiple
result' list...

A side note:
- some of the geocoders plugins Paolo lists, are 'one shot' geocoders:
you sent one address and it returns one or two results. This is the
geocoder I'm talking about
- some of the geocoder plugins accept a csv/list, you have to select
some columnnames and you sent the list to a service and you get a list
back (with info about misses etcetc). This is much harder I think to
implement in a general way? Would be cool though...
pdokgeocoder and MMQGISplugin have these...

Is this doable?
Should we write a QEP for this?

Regards,

Richard

+1
Richard, would you mind writing to all geocoder developers to ask for
collaboration? I think several of them are not on this ML.
All the best.

Hi,

Some workshops have their training materials published on the webpage [1].
But some materials are missing.
Is-it possible to have some links about the missing workshops ? Maybe not
the data, but at least the PDF.

It could be nice if we can add a Girona folder to this repository :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-workshop. I can help for that.

Regards,
Etienne

Richard's idea makes perfect sense to me - some sort of search
functionality has been done by various plugins and it is probably time
to offer a common way to do it with QGIS API.

And I would not limit ourselves to just geocoding - there are other
uses for that, e.g.:
- gazetteers - for example Discovery plugin [1]
- search in attributes of loaded layer(s)

The API implementation could also take care of things like on the fly
completion while user is still typing and running the queries in the
background, so the GUI is not blocked. So a search plugin would only
take care of processing search/geocoding/gazetteer query and response,
all the rest would be handled by QGIS.

We can start a QEP - if we have someone who volunteers to design and
implement that (I think QEPs should not end up as feature requests).

Cheers
Martin

I quite like how the Locator bar in Qt Creator work by also allowing
prefixs for searching:

c - Class search
. - method search

Maybe we can reuse this idea, and even code from the Qt source code.

Hi all,

I would like to duplicate some of standard QGIS tools in my plugin. In
other words I have in my plugin an icon for selecting features. Is
there any way how to automatically activate, after choosing this tool
from my plugin, standard QGIS tool called 'Select Features by area or
single click' without code duplication?

Thanks a lot for any kind of hint in advance, Martin

Is this in a pyqgis plugin? You should be able to activate the select tool
with iface.actionSelect().trigger(). You can also use
actionSelectFreehand(), actionSelectPolygon(), actionSelectRadius(), or
actionSelectRectange().

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New latlontools plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTonE-as5WbOxiovNfdEpwSr-bZafWUP+D-L1rK4dqCHmw@mail.gmail.com>

I just uploaded my latlontools plugin to the QGIS plugin site. I know it is
going to need some explanation as it duplicates some existing
functionality, but it was born out of frustration with the existing
plugins. Let me clarify that I am not saying there is anything wrong with
how these plugins work. They may be perfectly suited for the needs of their
users, but my work flow was such that they did not satisfy my needs and
even the time I spent in writing the plugin was well worth the time I saved
later with my work flow. LatLonTools is designed to work in conjunction
with Google Maps and other on-line mapping.



The plugins that LatLonTools has the most similarity with are Coordinate
Capture, Copy_Coords, and ZoomToCoordinates, and Zoom to Point.



The reason I wrote LatLonTools was because I was looking at archaeological
sites in Lidar hill shade and was comparing what I was viewing in QGIS with
imagery in Google Map, Google Earth, and some other mapping tools. I was
also working with coordinates in Wikipedia. All of these represent
coordinates as geographic latitude and longitudes either in decimal or DMS
notation. They all specify latitude followed by longitude usually with a
comma separator. LatLonTools uses latitude and longitude coordinates no
matter what the CRS of the QGIS project is - hence the name LatLonTools. It
was also important to be able to copy the coordinates verbatim usually in
the format "latitude, longitude" with slight variations and paste them into
my plugin in one text field (not two) and zoom to that point. Conversely I
wanted a single click in QGIS to copy a coordinate that I could paste in
Google Maps or Google Earth and zoom to that point. For my use this is the
problem with the existing plugins:



Zoom to Point:

1. Does not support DMS coordinates.

2. Has separate text fields for entering coordinates.

3. Requires coordinates in the CRS of the QGIS project and this may not be
in degrees.



Zoom to Coordinates

1. Does not support DMS coordinates.

2. Has separate text fields for entering coordinates.

3. Requires coordinates in the CRS of the QGIS project and this may not be
in degrees.

4. Not dockable.



Coordinate Capture

Although I have listed this one, it really doesn't compare to LatLonTools
because LatLonTools only captures to the clipboard so I am going to rule it
out as a similar plugin.

1. Does not support DMS notation.

2. Can capture the coordinate to the clipboard but it is in the format
of  "Longitude,
Latitude, Native CRS X, Native CRS Y" and is not suitable to paste into
Google Earth.

3. Even if you could click on the Capture button to get the right
coordinate you still have an extra click. With LatLonTools you only need to
click on the map and the coordinate is captured to the clipboard in the
right format for Google Earth.



Copy_Coords

1. Copies the coordinate in the format of "Longitude, Latitude" or in the
native CRS of "X, Y". This is not suitable to paste into Google Earth.

2. Does not support DMS notation.

3. Does not give any indication to the user that the coordinate was
captured.

4. If the CRS is anything other than 4326 the output will not be in degrees.



The major difference with LatLonTools is that it assumes degrees as input
and output no matter what the project CRS is and it formats them in the
order of on-line maps. Here is what LatLonTools offers:



1. Has a single string input of "Latitude, Longitude". Actually, the
delimiter can be one or more comma, space, tab, semicolon, or colon. Note
that with a tab you can paste the coordinates into a spread sheet in
adjacent columns.

2. Supports DMS on input and output.

3. Single click coordinate capture in the proper format for on-line maps.

4. Displays the coordinate in the lower left as the mouse moves over the
map.

5. In settings you can configure the capture format as decimal degrees,
DMS, DDMMSS or even the Native CRS, but will be in the order Y,X or
Latitude, Longitude.

6. In settings you can specify the delimiter between the two coordinates as
a comma, tab, space or anything you want.

7. Two tools in one plugin.

8. I may add an additional capability to paste in a block of coordinates
that create a list to click on and view.

9. Input is in a dockable window which I prefer to a popup window.



For anyone who uses QGIS in conjunction with Google Earth, Google Maps or
the like are really going to appreciate LatLonTools.



My goal was not to duplicate the work flow of the similar plugins, but to
optimize my work flow, but there are several easy modifications that I
could make in the "Settings" so that it could operate in the same manner as
3 of the plugins. I would only do this if the community wanted it, because
I would never work with coordinates the way they do. LatLonTools will only
have a single string as input so if the other plugins want two input text
boxes then there is no overlap. In the "Settings" it would be easy to
support coordinates is in the order of "X, Y" like the other plugins for
those who need that ordering. And in the settings I could also provide an
option for Native CRS input if others were interested.



I know this has been an incredibly long e-mail, but wanted to lay out the
reasons for this plugin and am requesting that you consider adding it to
the plugin repository. The plugin will likely expand with a bulk zoom to
point feature.



Thanks,


Calvin

Well I had a long email explaining why I wrote it, but failed to point to
the repository. You can just download the zip file, unzip it, rename the
folder to latlontools and drop it into the .qgis2 plugins directory.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the plugin!
But it is you yourself who have to add it to the repo :-)

- create an osgeo account, and publish/upload it to plugins.qgis.org
- somebody will have a look, and if ok (or after some
discussion/changes) it will be approved
- then it will show up to the world in the plugin manager

no need to point to your github for people to install. We do need the a
repo-url and issue-url in the metadata though...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard,

I have published/uploaded it, but figured since it duplicated some
capabilities I needed to explain why. This is the plugin link.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/latlontools/

Pardon me if I don't quite know the correct procedures. I am new to QGIS
development and am just learning how to work with the community and what is
expected.

Thanks,

Calvin

Message-ID: <CANaz7mxC5c378RvAQwiuW86XohinQH4P7mvrh4doqswtR5i2wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to ask you whether you know any way of being notified when a
feature is being added to a vector layer without opening and closing an
edit session, e.g., by using:

myLayer.dataProvider().addFeatures( [feature] )

Which directly writes the new feature to the provider.

When working with an edit session I can use featureAdded SIGNAL, which
gives me the feature id, but still haven't found a way of using such SIGNAL
with no edit session involved.

Regards,

Germán

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIGNAL to know when a feature is added to

Hi Germán,

I don't think there's a signal to do that.

Is there a reason you have to write the the dataprovider directly rather
then using the layer's methods?
If you are in control of the code writing to the dataprovider and the
code that should react to this, you could also produce the signalling on
your side.

Hi Calvin (sorry I called you Chris :-( ),

No worries, you are actually doing great!

It's just that I could not find (even an unpublished) version of your 
plugin on plugins.qgis.org at the time of writing...

Thanks for explaining. You are actually very right to explain WHY you 
created the plugin, because with the proliferation of plugins with about 
the same functionality we try to be a little more picky on which plugins 
add something new. Or else we try to convince authors to share energy 
and merge or add stuff to an older plugin.

After approval (mostly done by Paolo) it will be picked up by the plugin 
manager (that is it will be available in the 
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.14 xml...

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks Calvin for the detailed explanation, and for sharing your work.
I am still convinced the various tools could be merged into a more
coplete one. I'm going to open tickets on the relevant bugtrackers, and
write the plugin authors, to stimulate cooperation around this.
All the best.

Hi Calvin,
you made a great comparing existing tools for coordinate handling. I was
annoyed too with that mess. Could you make a feature request in hub.qgis.org
asking for more rational in core QGIS ? I imagine that we could just have
some tweaking of current coordinate widget so that it can have different
formatting options, and have all addintional tools being merged to only
one, handling all use cases.  making one more plugin is the right short
term option to meet your actual need (plugins are great for that).
Toavoiding too much efforts in maitaining those plugins, and also avoid
plugin clutering, a feature request is the right thing to do :)
Cheers
Régis

Hi

Just to echo what Régis is saying Calvin, as the original author of the coordinate capture plugin shipped with QGIS, your changes would probably be quite simple to add to the core plugin. I am actually planning to merge the coordinate capture tool into the status bar coordinates widget in QGIS 3.0 so it would be good to get your suggestions so that we actually don’t need to have a bunch of different plugins for this.

Regards

Tim

Could you make a feature request in hub.qgis.org <http://hub.qgis.org/> asking for more rational in core QGIS ? I imagine that we could just have some tweaking of current coordinate widget so that it can have different formatting options, and have all addintional tools being merged to only one, handling all use cases.  making one more plugin is the right short term option to meet your actual need (plugins are great for that). Toavoiding too much efforts in maitaining those plugins, and also avoid plugin clutering, a feature request is the right thing to do :)

I know it is going to need some explanation as it duplicates some existing functionality, but it was born out of frustration with the existing plugins. Let me clarify that I am not saying there is anything wrong with how these plugins work. They may be perfectly suited for the needs of their users, but my work flow was such that they did not satisfy my needs and even the time I spent in writing the plugin was well worth the time I saved later with my work flow. LatLonTools is designed to work in conjunction with Google Maps and other on-line mapping.

> The reason I wrote LatLonTools was because I was looking at archaeological sites in Lidar hill shade and was comparing what I was viewing in QGIS with imagery in Google Map, Google Earth, and some other mapping tools. I was also working with coordinates in Wikipedia. All of these represent coordinates as geographic latitude and longitudes either in decimal or DMS notation. They all specify latitude followed by longitude usually with a comma separator. LatLonTools uses latitude and longitude coordinates no matter what the CRS of the QGIS project is - hence the name LatLonTools. It was also important to be able to copy the coordinates verbatim usually in the format "latitude, longitude" with slight variations and paste them into my plugin in one text field (not two) and zoom to that point. Conversely I wanted a single click in QGIS to copy a coordinate that I could paste in Google Maps or Google Earth and zoom to that point. For my use this is the problem with the existing plugins:

Great to see things are moving in the right direction.
Please keep us updated on the progresses, so I can deprecate plugins
when core development will make them useless.
All the best.

I don't think such a library should be specific to QGis. Plenty of use
cases  outside QGis. There already is a geocoder python project:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder

Maybe that is a starting point?

I just released (another) geocoding plugin for Estonian national geocoding
service. I belive it has reasonable need here for that and merging all
together will make geocoding more complicated.
I think that we should make some agreements, that we use separate
toolbar/menu for geocoding, so we hold all similar functionality in one
place for user.
Also, why not implement QGIS core plugin that cover big services like
google, nominatim, etc and all other small/country-based plugins will
remain separately?

My proposal to use GDAL geocoding in QGIS core goes in that direction (see
a few messages above in this thread).

Any hope to have it integrated into QGIS, so the user can add it as a

Message-ID: <b68ddcbf-2354-4192-77f7-f1b73b4a1280@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I doing some tests on print layout. Contrary to my expectations, the map
extent and scale in the print preview are not taken from the canvas. I
kind of remember it used to work as I expected. Of course the user can
always click to set the extent, but IMHO the correct behaviour is to
update it automatically when the layout is opened.
Am I wrong?
2.14.3 on Debian.

Hi Matthias,

thanks for the response.

I'm writing a plugin and would like to be notified when vector layers get
new features. As a SIGNAL from dataProvider.addFeatures doesn't exist, the
plugin won't be able to handled such case. I could just suggest people to
avoid writing directly to the provider if they want the plugin to work as
expected, but I think QGIS could notify on those situations.

Do you think a (future) Pull Request is worth for handling this or better
avoid dealing with the provider directly?

Regards,

Germán

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible QGIS D3 Data Analysis Plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqCCozxm-aSvx71==cR7K45+xwhRY=th8NRHic4y5YCyA@mail.gmail.com>

I am contemplating writing a visualization plugin that analyzes temporal
patterns in distributions of data in two dimensions similar to the ArcGIS
Data Clock.

http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/tracking-analyst/094-the-data-clock.htm

My first thought would be to have it create the graph as a D3 html page.
The pro to that would be that I would get to learn D3 but also it would
become an interactive graph that would be separate from QGIS. It could be
integrated into a web page. The other option would be to use a python
graphics library to display it within a QGIS window like the Environmental
Data Explorer.

Ultimately, I would envision all sorts of analysis and graphs. Is anyone
already working on a D3 plugin like this?

What are your thoughts? Would anyone be interested in a capability like
this? Would D3 be a good or bad way to implement this?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] Why 2.5D geometries are not clippable
	?
Message-ID: <575AD854.40505@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

An issue has been opened by a french user about the clip tool in processing.
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14929

Because it's not a developper, he does not easily understand why QGIS 
Processing 2.14 does not clip his 2.5D geometry. He does not have this 
issue with QGIS Processing 2.12.

So We test to clip 2.5D geometry with QGIS Processing 2.14 by commenting 
these lines:
```
         geomType = layerA.dataProvider().geometryType()
         if geomType in GEOM_25D:
             raise GeoAlgorithmExecutionException(
                 self.tr('Input layer has unsupported geometry type 
{}').format(geomType))
```
And it seems to work.

So why 2.5D geometries are not clippable in QGIS ?

Regards,
René-Luc

This may come in handy.

Message-ID: <CACPZzQ1r1cE5LsJ_eA1TycTJfG6GFS_oZ-4GH0zzo1TBLk60VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Trying in the Python QGIS Console the following:

from qgis.gui import QgsDial
dial = QgsDial()
dial.show()

it returns:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: qgis._gui.QgsDial cannot be instantiated or sub-classed

This is weird IMO because it's not an abstract class and the class has a
constructor according to the documentation e.g
http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsDial.html

Is it a choice, a Python binding issue, or something else?
Any feedback?


FYI, I've tried with QGIS master c578f3a and 2.14.3 on an Ubuntu 14.04 x64


Cheers

You mean the first time the print layout is opened (created). If so, yes
this is the way it used to work (and I think it still does): at the
creation the map extent is picked from the canvas.
But imo there's no reason to have the composer map item extent synced with
map canvas each time it's opened.

Hello,

It could also be very interesting to have one or more  Processing module(s) for geocoding (natives QGIS "algorithms"). We could then chain this with other algorithms (find all objects of a layer intersecting a 500m buffer from the positions of the adresses in a list for example). Of course this module would be easier to write if we would have a native QGIS API for this...

Yes, that's another good point for having it in the core.

I guess that the most reasonable implementation would be having the most
common geocoders (whole world coverage) available as core implementationn
and create an API to register local/national geocoders by plugins.

QEP: first try done:

writing to all geocoder dev's... see what comes from this first

I'm not sure this is what an user expects. IMHO the typical use case is: 
I zoom to the area and scale of interest, open a print layout, and go on 
printing the same area.
Am I the only one expecting this?
All the best.

​Maybe I'm just used to the current behavior, but for most of my usecases
the extent of the print map should stay same while I might be busy fixing
details in the main window (and thus zooming and panning around there).

That's why the current behavior works well for me.

(cc-ing the UX list for input)

Best wishes,
Anita​

+1 for what is currently there.  One of the main reasons I move from
MapInfo to QGIS was this, annoying when you are editing and return to print
and it's moved on you.

+100 to stick with current behaviour. My canvas extent very rarely reflects
desired extend and scale of my composer layouts

That said, for your use case, maybe you want to implement a [x] keep extend
and scale synchronised with canvas. Off by default :)

  very often composer layout scale have nothing to do with canvas 
workflow, it should be "static"
as the current behaviour,
thanks, Roy

The current behaviour is great, but having an option to use spatial bookmarks (to the best scale) within the composer will be ideal:

  very often composer layout scale have nothing to do with canvas workflow, it should be "static"

Agreed. What I found during training session is that the "zoom to map
extent" buttons are too hard to find for most users. Even some advanced
users where zooming maps with mouse scroll, not remembering those buttons
from courses.  Maybe some UI tweaking could help here. Why not a button in
toolbar?
Cheers

Good points, thanks for comments. Perhaps a more evident button, or a 
notice to the user (want to update the view?) would be enough.
I have an issue in distributing print layouts: in this case the first 
appearance will be completely off the real map, and this can be really 
confusing. Maybe better to zoom at first project opening, or what a 
layout is added, would be useful?
All the best.

Hi,
Thanks to Paolo and Rene-luc for pointing out..

Me and Michael are currently working on a plugin that plots D3 interactive
plots..

In a first release (hopefully we will release soon a first version) the
user will be able to draw some plot types and also have a "feedback"
between the plot and the map canvas..

Just have some more patience ;-)

Cheers

Matteo

I like the idea of a extent toolbar, with set extent to match map canvas
and the opposite. Also having bookmarks would be nice. Those buttons should
only work for a selected map item, because you may have several maps in the
same composer.

Sorry, just catching up on this thread. My opinions:

- 100% the composer extent should NOT be limited to the canvas extent, for
all the reasons already listed. This is IMO one of MapInfo's worst failings
(one of very many!)

- I think the best solution is a floating toolbar which appears over
selected map items, with options for zoom/pan/set to canvas/set to
bookmark/etc. This would help increase the exposure of these tools and make
it obvious that this is the correct way to set composer map extents. The
current "move item content" tool is very difficult for people to discover.
I'd love to implement this but just haven't had an opportunity yet.

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iJR9bR78YNgSiovwcDY84t_SfuYYx8Lq-A1-_LEKg_VFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Here is the report for the 3rd week of GSoC

*What did you get done this week?*
This week I didn't have much time to work on GSoC, but I managed to:

   - Try some python git libraries, but didn't really find one that could
   easily be used without some further efforts contributing on the libraries
   first. Using git to interact with the git repositories is really nice to
   have for example to clone only one collections from a repository (one
   repository could have many collections).
   - Implement some basic classes to deal with remote git repository (now
   it could fetch the metadata)
   - Configure testing: Travis and Coveralls. For testing I used Matthias'
   mocked QGIS module, not Ale's testing framework with QGIS on docker.

*What do you plan on doing next week?*
This week I am planning to:

   - Continue working on the modules to handle remote repository so that it
   can more neatly handle other cases (timeout, the repo isn't available, the
   metadata isn't available, etc)
   - Parsing the metadata file to a collections object
   - Update the add, edit, and delete repository slots to also update the
   collections object when those actions happened.

Finally I will have the last final exam tomorrow on Monday. After that, I
will work full-time on this (though I still need to do some administrations
for a few weeks here). I made a gitter chat room here:
https://gitter.im/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing so you can ping me
there for faster response. The repository is here
https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing. I would be happy to
get code review from any of you .

*Are you blocked on anything?*
For now, no.

Cheers

Hi,
Another tool I may find useful to add to such a toolbar is one that helps
you show in the map canvas the current content (layers with associated
style) of the composer map item
see feature request at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14901

Harrissou

Message-ID: <68bd638f-7b92-7e52-7dba-e6a99bc65846@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
if I create a layout template on Linux, Windows users miss system SVGs,
because the path stored in the template is OS-independent, therefore
points to a non existing path (/usr/share/qgis/svg/).
To me this seems a definite bug, agreed?
I had a look to the bugtracker, and could not find a ticket about
exactly this.
Thanks.

Hi,

If the folder /usr/share/qgis/svg/ itself is not accessible from Windows
computer, there's no way to get it in QGIS, so not sure we can consider
this as a QGIS bug. It's rather a matter of storage location.
I work with colleagues that use Windows or Mac computers and had problems
with that. What I finally do is to put the svg folder on the network so
that any computer can access these files and then configure QGIS to store
relative paths (works for svg but also for shapefiles...). Then no more OS
dependent problem to share projects .

HTH,
Harrissou

Don't agree with this: the same file is certainly available in a
different, OS-specific, directory. QGIS normally take into account this,
quite effectively.
What is wrong here IMHO is to store an absolute, OS independent, path,
instead of a variable, OS specific, one, that gets replaced as most
appropriate for each system.

Of course this work, but it’s a hack.

Thanks Harrissou for your opinion.

Hi Paolo,

The same thing seems to happen with project files. If you create a 
project with an SVG (e.g. a north arrow) in Linux and then open the 
project in Windows, the SVG doesn't display in the map composer because 
the path is wrong. The SVG path seems to be dependent on the OS.

Regards, Frank.

Akbar,

Thank you for the updates,

I've had a quick look at you code and it looks good to me!

I've added a couple of comments to the github commits page.

Looking forward to see you progress!

Thank you for the response. I will hold off trying to write my own plugin,
but if you happen to need additional help let me know. The one capability
that I am very interested in is a functionality similar to the ArcGIS Data
Clock.

http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/tracking-analyst/094-the-data-clock.htm

Are you planning on doing something like that?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What is the API for opening and displaying HDF5
	files through native python console in QGIS?
Message-ID: <420BA53B-B59A-468B-975D-35297D748141@gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to kindly ask for help opening a .h5 file, which is the extension for HDF5 file format, through the python console. Specifically I would like to open and display a dataset object (specific object type in HDF5) nested inside a group object (other specific object type in HDF5). I know that QGIS existing functionality allows HDF5 files to be opened and displayed through the GUI. When I use the Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster layer tool and open my desired HDF5 file, a window called “Select raster layers to add…” pops up listing all dataset objects inside my file that would ultimately open as raster files on QGIS. Selecting any of them effectively displays them in the map canvas. However, I would like to know the API for opening and displaying the HDF5 file dataset object through the native python console rather than the toolbar. I expect to be able to use the API to open and display any of the dataset objects within the HDF5 file and potentially provide proper CRS (Coordinate Reference System) for proper georeference. I am using QGIS 2.12.1 Lyon on Windows.

Thanks,

Hi Calvin

I did a plugin integrating a D3.js Sunburst Diagram in a plugin to
allow interactive editing of a distribution/configuration file

you can find tech references in the presentation I'll give next week
in the Portuguese QGIS User Conference... it's still in draft state,
btw some information you need are available there or linked in a
previous plugin.

http://slides.com/luigipirelli/qtraffic#/

generally speaking, regarding interfacing D3 in a QWebView the main
work is to undestanding how to organize data to be used by the D3
specific graphic visualization. QTraffic plugin is more complex
because there is also a 2way management of the the modification events
that are propagated from the webview to the python plugin and then to
the configuration file.... and viceversa. In case of "static"
visualization, that means dynamic but only in the webview, the
complexity is reduced to push data and organize them to a static html
template page.

regards
Luigi Pirelli

Message-ID: <F545874F-1321-4E3F-9AD2-B19C6E66419E@qgis.org>

Hi All

Just a note for those helping to add entries to the visual changelog (http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/): we now support uploading animated gif’s. See Matthias’s entry “New configuration options for attribute table” - I have added a small example there. It would be great if you could use your favourite gif tool to make little animations of new features. If you need any help getting logged in / entry creation permissions, please pop me a note.

Thanks

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Segmentation fault when using layersRemoved SIGNAL.
Message-ID: <CANaz7mweBzeKQpQ2m3jVKr83GQCmS=Mbdu28PkfgGKe+sscdAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

there seems to be an issue connecting the SIGNAL layersRemoved from
QgsMapLayerRegistry.

For example, if I save this script to a file, and run it from the Linux
terminal:

################################################
import unittest
from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsMapLayerRegistry

class SIGNALTest( unittest.TestCase ):

    def setUp( self ):
        app = QgsApplication([], True)
        QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)
        QgsApplication.initQgis()

        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().layersRemoved.connect(
self.myFunction )

    def myFunction( self, layerIds ):
        print "Called!"

    def test1( self ):
        self.assertEqual(1,1)

    def tearDown( self ):
        QgsApplication.exitQgis()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
################################################

I get the following result:

##########
Called!
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.119s

OK
Segmentation fault
###########

If, on the contrary, I comment out the line where the connection is set or
if I use other signals such as layerRemoved or layersAdded instead of
layersRemoved, I get:

###########
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.111s

OK
###########

I'm using QGIS 2.14.2 on a GNU/Linux machine.

Can you confirm such problem? Do you have any clue about it?


Regards,

Germán

Hi,

When using the plugin manager I no longer see any descriptions of 
plugins. I've deleted the .qgis directory but this doesn't solve the 
poroblem.

I'm using QGIS Master on Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit.

Anyone else experiencing this problem?

Hi all,
there are several plugins that are orphaned, e.g.
https://github.com/kalxas/improvedpolygoncapturing
https://github.com/kalxas/dimensioning
and possibly more. I would encourage interested developers in picking
them up, both for fixing long standing, probably trivial bugs, and in
view of porting them to QGIS 3.
I'm available for help.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

Some existing Processing algorithms could be faster by making use of a
spatial index, e.g. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15012

What's the recommended way to implement a spatial index in a processing
algorithm to ensure consistent behavior with other tools (e.g. concerning
using only selected features)?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS-devel on FreeBSD: layer's metadata not
	editable
Message-ID: <47596c54-7a98-65e8-7eb5-ec17a1fcace2@gwdg.de>

Dear devs,

I am the maintainer of the QGIS port for the FreeBSD OS.

For some time now I have problems, when running a more recent QGIS devel 
version on FreeBSD. QGIS devel does not show and/or let me edit layer's 
metadata.

For example, if I have a vector layer and go to
[Layer Properties] -> [Style] -> [Fill] -> [Simple fill]

all I get in the [Symbol layer type] area is
[This layer doesn't have any editable properties]

The corresponding debug messages seem to be the following:

[..snip..]


This is on FreeBSD 11.0-CURRENT with clang compiler 3.8.0 and cmake 
3.5.2. QGIS is on Git tag #1563526, so the patch for 'Simpler handling 
of DLL_EXPORT defines' #d3fd818 is already included.

The debug messages point into the directions of a casting problem.

I am not a programmer, but to me it seems, that there is a problem with 
the visibility of some layer properties code. Before #d3fd818, I was 
able to see the layer's metadata, if I built QGIS with commenting out 
the following line in all CMakeLists.txt files:

#SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "$${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fvisibility=hidden 
-fvisibility-inlines-hidden


Unfortunately, I have no idea, what to do next :(

I would really appreciate any help or hint in this context. Please let 
me know, if I should provide more information or test something.

Many thanks in advance,
Rainer Hurling

Hi all,

First I want to apologize if I stepped in anyone's toes with latlontools.
This was the first plugin I worked on and I wasn't even thinking about
submitting the plugin. I was trying to learn QGIS plugin development on
something that I would find useful and I had certain needs that the other
plugins did not meet. That being said, I think it will be useful to others
for the DMS support, its versatility with other applications, and to
hopefully bring all the capabilities together. It was essential to me to
more quickly copy and paste coordinates between QGIS, Google Maps, and
other online maps. Because it was saving me so much time I felt others
would find it useful which is why I submitted it.

I just update latlontools with a multi-point zoom to capability. I welcome
your input. It makes it possible to create a list of points that you can
click on to zoom to various locations.

Although I wrote this for myself, it is an accepted plugin so I need to
consider the needs of others. There are certain aspects of some of the
other plugins that I did not implement because I would never use the
features, but that doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like them so here are
some questions.

1. Does anyone use "Scale View by..." that is part of the "Zoom To
Coordinates" plugin?
2. The one change I made was to order coordinates as "latitude, longitude"
or "Y, X". The other plugins had the reverse order. I did this because that
is the order that Google uses and probably most of the other on-line maps.
Would "X,Y" ordering ever be important? If so, when and why?
3. I intended latlontools to work with geographic latitude and longitude
regardless of the CRS of the project, but I could easily have a setting
that would allow Native CRS coordinates be used as input. Should I?

All the best,

Calvin

Can we revisit this discussion again?

I'm very much in favour of:
1. Removing openlayers plugin from the repo asap. This plugin is broken and
unfortunately is harming the reputation of the project, as many users
cannot distinguish the difference between the plugin's issues and problems
with QGIS itself (eg see
https://twitter.com/thatkindofplace/status/742543174573260800?s=03 )

2. Rename QuickMapServices as "QuickMapServices (OpenLayers replacement)"
on the plugin repo, so users looking for openlayers are nicely directed to
the new plugin

Did you try out the stuff I and Matthias proposed at the user-list?

What was the conclusion for this?

Did you have other versions installed from libs or QGIS?
Did you add several repo's?

Makes sense to me. Going to deprecate it tomorrow if nobody objects.
Thanks Nyall.

+1 too, for removing openlayers and looking into putting efforts to come up
with a native TMS driver.

Suggestion: instead of just removing openlayers from the plugin repository,
could we work with the author (if he's reachable and willing) for him to
publish a new plugin update stating that a/ the plugin is discontinued, and
b/ users should migrate to quickservicemap?

Hi


+1 From me too, but I do think it would be good to communicate with Pirmin first before simply removing OpenLayers plugin (I am not sure if he has been following this thread).

Regards

Tim

It could be an issue with libraries.
The application is linked against one you built yourself and runtime
picks up a system library.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH might help in this situation.

Maybe first discuss with Author (in cc)?

As the maintainers used to put a lot of work into the plugin. In my view
it is not very polite to retract/depricate a plugin.

Best I think would be (if Pirmin and Matthias are ok with it), to
temporarily depricate it, AND show with a message in the description
that there is a working alternative.
This would give SP time to fix, without time pressure.

Unless off course the Plugin is being depricated by the authors too....
Then it could just be removed.

Maybe we should have a mechanisme in the plugins to do such messages?
For example: "This plugins is not working properly because.... (eg
Webkit/Debian)" or "This plugin is deprecated in favour of ..."?

Hi all,
there is an additional problem: IANAL, but AFAIK the OL plugin does not
break licence from service providers, wherear QMS plugin does. So, it is
not a simple drop-in replacement.
Integrating a native TMS driver in QGIS (generally the best option) may
make things worse.
All the best.

I would propose to rename it to "Basemaps (OpenLayers replacement)".  
QuickMapServices is one of the most unintuitive names for such a basic  
need ... a basemap ;)

Any provider can be abused - WFS,  SHP, whatever. For me, a native tile
server provider would be fabulous.

Agreed; this is true of many plugins, unfortunately.
I try to convince plugin developers to give informative names, but
changing the name of an existing plugin creates some confusion, and is
not straightforward.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What's the recommended way to implement a

i guess that the spatial index should be created as usual, but, as you
say, only including selected features if the Processing settings is
configured to use only those ones.

I dont see any specific thing about it being a Processing algorithm,
other than that. An even if you create it for the whole layer, it
should be fine (although less efficient)

Any particular problem that you are facing with this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Layer Search and Quick Finder Plugins Integration
Message-ID: <CABPxTTq-u3jJ0i8nnb9JDxPxKtB2GZHRF2QJPZYNBsQ2OQJqfg@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to see the Layer Search plugin capability available in QGIS
sometime relative soon and it was proposed to integrate it into Quick
Finder.

It is important to me for Layer Search to display the results of what was
found, the layer it was found in and the column it was found in. I would
also like it to be able to display a fairly large number of results.

This does not fit with the drop down methodology that Quick Finder uses. I
could do a pull request and add Layer Search as a separate search in the
Quick Finder menu. Would that be acceptable or are their any other ideas? I
am not necessarily sure the original request to merge capabilities means
this solution, but I also don't see the direct integration in the Quick
Finder drop down menu results.

Let me know if there is anything more I can do to either help integrate or
whether in the near term layer search should be approved as a plugin.

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Do QGIS and QGIS plugins fall under the same usage
 rights for scientific publication?
Message-ID: <CA+jvDrnFrQcK9K8gN=rPrJhoowpt8+Nrh-f=ZRpGJZGuoTPTNg@mail.gmail.com>

QGIS, with citation, can be used for research. Can QGIS plugins
(installable from the plugin list within QGIS Desktop), with citation, also
be used for research? In other words, if someone creates a plugin that's
added to the repository, does the plugin then fall under all the same usage
and copyright rules that QGIS does?

I realise it's splitting hairs and I'm sure it's alright to use the plugin
in research (citing both QGIS and the plugin creator separately), but I was
asked to look into plugin use for copyright reasons before creating more
figures and submitting a paper. I emailed the plugin developer to ask
permission to use the plugin for research purposes. Since I haven't heard
back, I thought I'd ask QGIS developers about usage of plugins found in the
repository.

This page referred me to the QGIS developer mailing list:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/QGIS_Citation_Repository

Clarification would be much appreciated. I'm quite happy to be using QGIS
for research now!

​Well, it would be less efficient to build the index and one would have to
check later on if the feature was selected. Otherwise, e.g. the hub
distance algorithm, would return wrong matches to unselected hubs ...

​No particular problem, just wondering what's the most elegant way and if
there is anything I should be aware of when implementing the index. It
would be good to have this as an example in the PyQGIS Cookbook imho. (Not
just building the index but also accessing the nearest features.)

Best wishes,
Anita​

Hi all,
in print layout, if I filter only visible element to be shown in the
legend, this works. Apparently however the names of empty groups are
shown anyway: am I wrong? Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

Hi all,

> Maybe first discuss with Author (in cc)?

Thanks Richard. Today was the 7th annual Swiss QGIS User meeting and therefore 
no time to answer to this second shit storm wave earlier.

First some history for QGIS newbies:
The OpenLayers plugin was presented at the first QGIS User meeting six years 
ago [1]. It was built to integrate Google Maps layers using the Google API via 
OpenLayers. At this time only the illegal (but well known) way using a GDAL 
VRT supported this functionality. In the meantime there have been at least 
three plugins reimplementing this illegal TMS access method, the latest (and 
best) is QuickMapServices. The OpenLayers plugin got the first major breakage 
with the QGIS 2.0 API change. The multithreaded rendering in QGIS 2.4 caused a 
complete rewrite of the plugin. Between and after that other QGIS or Google 
Maps changes have broken the OpenLayers plugin from time to time and it was a 
matter of course that we "fix" it to adapt these (usually paid) changes.

I personally don't think that the name of this or another plugin is the main 
reason for more than 700'000 downloads of the OpenLayers plugin. I know of 
quite a few users staying with old QGIS version (even 1.x) just to be able to 
display and print Google Maps base layers. For some of them the plugin was 
important enough, to pay a few hundred Swiss Francs for another "bug fix". 
Apart of this, OpenLayers was always done in my limited spare time at home or 
at hackfests (travelling sponsored by Sourcepole). Even when I pointed at a 
possible breakages of PluginLayers, like before merging the map rotation 
feature, it seemed never to have any priority to test a change with the OL 
plugin or even preventing to break it. This attitude and the destructive 
Trump-syle tone with the +1 frency in this community mailing list are 
definitely not the motivation I would need for another bug fix. And regarding 
the reputation of QGIS, I find promoting a plugin for doing  illegal things 
worse than not fixing printing problems.

Enough of getting my frustration out - I have also a constructive proposal: 
Please pass a customRenderFlag during composer rendering to give PluginLayers 
a chance to handle this case without adventurous workarounds (and besides make 
it possible to fix WMTS printing with more than 90dpi's). I would then at least 
turn off OL layers and display a message.

Regards
Pirmin

​Same here, would be nicer if the group would be hidden as well if empty.

Sourcepole's fork has a fix. I just wasn't sure if forward porting it was
safe. Do we *always* want to hide these? Is there any circumstance where
someone would want to show them?

I don't see when one would want to show an empty group.

Hey Fox,

QGIS plugins are always GPL no matter what (unless you don't share them).
So yes QGIS and QGIS plugins both have the same copyright (well copyleft
really) licence.

You are free to use a plugin for what ever purpose you see fit.

Regards,

I’m wondering what the first storm was? The OpenLayers Plugin is a great tool for QGIS and I agree we could have approached this discussion more sensitively - e.g. by first approaching you and Maxim and other devs building similar tools to look for a way to reduce duplication of effort and solve the issues that users experience with printing etc. So please do accept our apologies.

I do think it is worth discussing this though because we want to try to tidy up the plugin repository and make things clearer for users (for example by not having multiple plugins which ostensibly do the same thing). In the situation where we do have multiple plugins which do the same or similar things, then it would be nice to a) encourage the developers to work together on one version if possible and b) make it easier for the user to figure out which is the best one to install.

Specifically with reference to the legalities, is it really the case that OpenLayers plugin is on firm legal footing and the others are not?

I’m reading here:

https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#getting-started

and here:

https://developers.google.com/maps/terms

Things that may apply here:


• "No access to APIs or Content except through the Service. You will not access the Maps API(s) or the Content except through the Service. For example, you must not access map tiles or imagery through interfaces or channels (including undocumented Google interfaces) other than the Maps API(s)."

So my understanding for this is: OpenLayers Plugin uses the API so its fine, TMS wrappers in GDAL do not so it probably contravenes the license.

• "No use of Content with a non-Google map. You must not use the Content in a Maps API Implementation that contains a non-Google map."

This is a bit harder as it seems to impact all plugins using Google Maps - it pretty much excludes any typical use case a QGIS user might have - combining google maps as a backdrop layer with your own data? Or do I interpret this incorrectly?


But yes, I agree with you that having plugins which do illegal things in our repo is not good. Admittedly QuickMapServices does not ship with the potentially illegal services out of the box, but it does make it very easy to add them. @Paolo it would probably be good to add a clause to the plugin upload policy page indicating that plugins should not do illegal things (though this itself is subject to regional interpretation). 

We also have the case that we get many reports from people trying to print with OpenLayers plugins and having problems. In our context in South Africa, users with slow internet often get map prints with missing tiles when using OpenLayers plugin. That kind of leaves people with a choice between ‘be legal and don’t print’ and ‘be illegal and you can print’. That doesn’t seem to be an optimal set of choices either. I am not sure if your proposed solution above will address the ‘holes in print maps’ issue?

Again my apology for my participation in the ‘+1 frenzy’ but I do think it is good to try to find a way to remove duplication of effort, support only legal plugins and give users an experience where they can reliably print their map compositions. So I do think this is a discussion worth having but just approached in a more constructive way ...

Tim

Thanks a lot. Any hope to have it backported to 2.14?

I join Tim in apologizing. I'm pretty sure nobody had intention to
diminute Pirmin contribution to QGIS, and the plugin itself, just
motivated by the desire to improve the current situation for our users.

Done: http://plugins.qgis.org/
Please see if it can be improved.
Thanks for the suggestion.
All the best.

Hi Nathan,

I always thought that they are GPL even when you don't share them. The
important clauses just don't trigger.

That's true just didn't want to over complicate it, but yes it's always GPL

Subject: [Qgis-developer] The first column in the attribute table
Message-ID: <9246015ef2a9d87c492b065f7eda6db7@carto.net>

Hi, 

I'd like to discuss an issue in the attribute table. 

There is this very first column (not stored in the provider) which lists
the features as they appear in the provider (by default, if not
re-ordered by the user). What are these values? Some internal ID not
present in the data? Or some internal ID from the qt table widget? 

I am just wondering, because regarding this first column, QGIS behaves
different from Spreadsheets. 

When you reorder the table in QGIS, this very first column becomes "out
of order" - spreadsheets always display 1 to xxx - nicely ordered -
regardless of the sort order. Could QGIS be aligned to the behaviour of
spreadsheets or is there a particular reason not do so? I think, from a
users perspective, because these numbers are not present in the data,
that it would be more useful if they always stay ordered from 1 to xxx
or 0 to xxx, regardless of sorting. 

Thank you for your feedback. 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I always thought that they are the feature ID. But not even that, often
they are "feature id - 1", but that's not guaranteed at all.

We could make it match the feature id. Or the current index in the table
like you propose.

Hi Matthias, 

If there are no negative side effects - I'd like to see the same
behaviour like in spreadsheets - an always ascending list, starting from
1 - regardless of the order of the rows. 

Would this be a lot of work to change this?

The first wave started in December.
In the next days we have acceptance tests and training of our customized QGIS 
version demonstrated in Girona, before deploying it to 28'000 machines. So I 
appologize for not having the time for longer discussions now. I made a 
proposal for solving the technical problem in my answer.
And may I ask to continue the other disussions brought into this thread under 
a new subject. Just for the sake of Mathias', Luiz' and my mental health.

Hi Matthias, 

Column header numbers? Aren't we discussing row header numbers?

Are you working with an attribute table (or an attribute table model) there?

Message-ID: <6de427ed-a871-0cdd-eee4-f89423fc40d8@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
related to a previous thread: is I activate the filtering of the legend,
to refresh its content I have to:
* first refresh the map
* then click on the legend.
The second click seems unnecessary, and it may well be confusing for the
user. Is there a reason for it, or is this a bug?
All the best, and thanks.

Your build is a few hours old. That's ancient in QGIS timescales. Update!

You don't need a license to use stuff you did yourself.  The license defines
what others are allowed to do with your work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Status of 2.8?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg1_kTDozEUwxdTqqv7Ge5OHxWO8YOYaDEf3+nbQaa2dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all (specifically Jürgen),

I'm looking for clarification on the future of the 2.8 branch.... will
there be any more point releases for this branch, or given that when
2.16 is released 2.14 will replace the ltr, is 2.8 effectively
finished and just history now?

I'm just trying to work out if it's a waste of time backporting stuff
to the 2.8 branch now.

 Oracle spatial 11g via QGIS
Message-ID: <CADDWHj2PbhgrnfEe-dHfF=eBAYTjFPBAfD9H-jOhqX-Y3KcDaA@mail.gmail.com>

I am quite new to the developers list, and I am not sure does this question
belong here or should I post it to the users list. I thought this is quite
a technical issue so maybe here can be found someone that has been testing
the oracle driver functionality?

Testing QGIS with an Oracle Spatial 11g, where a user A owns a spatial
table and all objects and metadata related to the table. This user can edit
the geometries without problems via QGIS.

The problem is that a user B, with grants to a spatial table (no owner
though) cannot edit geometries although is able to create new ones or to
remove them from the table owned by A. In other environments (Microstation
and directly in Oracle) user B is actually able to edit features.

Anyone has any idea or hints on what the problem is here?

Regards,

Eduardo

Message-ID: <1de83414-328e-a96b-38d6-03c78928dc63@duif.net>

Hi Dev's,

Trying out some WMS-time based services in combi with TimeManager.

My question is if WMS-images (based on URL's) are cached or not.

While I see that there is a cache for the capabilities, and for tiles
for tile-based services. Looking at QGIS behaviour and searching in code
[0] I do not see a caching mechanisme for WMS images.

For timebased series this would be great to have: first time you
run/play a time-interval it is off course slow because of the network
requests, but replaying would be very fast.

So Question: am I doing something wrong here?
Or is it 'not implemented' yet?

To test read: http://planet.qgis.org/planet/tag/spatio-temporal%20data/
And use the following service to check Katrina:
http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/nexrad/n0r-t.cgi
and start/stop times:
2005-08-29T03:00:00Z
2005-08-30T03:00:00Z

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes. This code takes categorized 2.5d render roof colours, wall colours, and
heights, and adds them as fields into cleanedLayer, which is GeoJSON from
writeAsVectorFormat():
provider =
cleanedLayer.dataProvider()provider.addAttributes([QgsField("height",
QVariant.Double),    QgsField("wallColor", QVariant.String),   
QgsField("roofColor", QVariant.String)])cleanedLayer.updateFields()fields =
cleanedLayer.pendingFields()renderer = dirtyLayer.rendererV2()renderContext
= QgsRenderContext.fromMapSettings(        canvas.mapSettings())heightField
= fields.indexFromName("height")wallField =
fields.indexFromName("wallColor")roofField =
fields.indexFromName("roofColor")feats =
dirtyLayer.getFeatures()cleanedLayer.startEditing()for feat in feats:   
classAttribute = renderer.classAttribute()    attrValue =
feat.attribute(classAttribute)    catIndex =
renderer.categoryIndexForValue(attrValue)    categories =
renderer.categories()    symbol = categories[catIndex].symbol()    wallColor
= symbol.symbolLayer(1).subSymbol().color().name()    roofColor =
symbol.symbolLayer(2).subSymbol().color().name()   
cleanedLayer.changeAttributeValue(feat.id() + 1,                                     
heightField, height)    cleanedLayer.changeAttributeValue(feat.id() + 1,                                     
wallField, wallColor)    cleanedLayer.changeAttributeValue(feat.id() + 1,                                     
roofField, roofColor)cleanedLayer.commitChanges()
Before adding those three "+ 1"s from that commit, the colours and height
were applying to the wrong feature - the id (I think) off by one. Hence the
hacky fix, and my comment that this works, but I don't understand why I have
to do it.

Message-ID: <1466159753422-5272189.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi Pirmin and all

A quick note, just to say that I was aware you were at the Swiss QGIS user
conference. I wanted to post to the previous thread to make others aware of
this, and that therefore this was a terrible time to discuss this issue
publically, since you could not reply. However, I was myself at FOSS4GUK,
and failed to do so. I apologize for failing to find the time to write such
a short and important message.

I will tread very carefully here, but since I am not a core QGIS dev or PSC
member, by all means direct anger at me - we all know for sure that the core
devs/PSC had no intention to denigrate your work. Let your irritation be
with us individuals, and not with the QGIS project as a whole - I am sure
that is what you are doing anyway. Again, everyone on this list is surely
aware of how much you and Sourcepole have done for the project for so many
years.

At the risk of being compared to Trump again (wasn't expecting that...), is
your concern for your users of your fork? If so, can you follow the
Boundless (and others') approach of hosting your own plugins repo and adding
OpenLayers to that?

There remains an issue to solve for QGIS users, and while I understand your
anger at how this discussion has taken place, I don't want us to back away
from discussing it more professionally purely because we are intimidated by
your anger.

I hope you understand and accept this, probably not at all well expressed.

Kind regards to one and all. Except Trump.

Tom

Message-ID: <7CCEF44D1C42854999B19B1EB27281F6751D5977@SR2ORBHQ2K803.angus.gov.uk>

Hi List,

Hopefully this is the right place to ask about QGIS and the OSGeo4W installer.

I'm just back from FOSS4GUK and wanted to update my QGIS installed on my Windows 7 32bit machine.

I ran than OSGeo4W installer and selected all the updated packages and the process completed successfully.  However, when I want to run QGIS 2.14.3 I get an error message saying that C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis-bin.exe is unavailable.  Checking the folder shows that it is not there.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still the 2.14.3-2 exe does not get installed.  The nightly QGIS exe is available.  Oddly, QGIS Browser 2.14.3 is still installed.

Does the installation get logged somewhere?  Should I just delete my OSGeo4W folder and start again?

Thanks in advance

Ross

That's not involving QgsAttributeTableModel, so this seems to be a
different issue.

In your case, it's dangerous to use the feature ids from one layer and
assume that they match on another layer. You will have to find a common
attribute (primary key) or (I guess you create one of the two layers in
your script) copy the source feature id to the copied layer.

Hi Andreas,

as of today there's also the feature id shown in the tooltip of the
attribute table's column header. I think this will help one or another
developer once in a while.

One layer is a copy of the other, but point taken. Will have to generate
another unique column on which I can depend. 

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] raster to postgresql/postgis GUI plugin
Message-ID: <576470F4.7000703@ieee.org>

Hi,

I was unable to find a way to upload raster data to a PostGis DB from QGIS.

I was aware of the raster2pgsql tool, but for the user-cases in my
projects, it is not an acceptable alternative (users do not have cli or
programming skills).

So, to temporally workaround this shortcoming, I decided to implement a
QGIS plugin to act as a GUI to the raster2pgsql program.

I have a working prototype available at
https://bitbucket.org/danielluehr/rastertopgsql/overview

Please, note that it is the result of just a couple of days' work, and
it is my first attempt at writing a QGIS plugin. It is just a
quick&dirty implementation that is far from being complete or foolproof.

My goal was to call the raster2pgsql program and pipe the output to the
DB directly, but I still don't know what is the best approach to send
data to an established connection (or maybe open one at that moment).
So, currently, the plugin just calls raster2pgsql on a file (with user
specified options from the plugin GUI) and saves the results to a SQL
file to be "manually" injected on the database (using some DB-manager
GUI, for instance).

I think a good alternative would be to incorporate it as a sub-plugin in
the dbmanager plugin.

I have briefly tested the plugin only against QGIS 2.8.9 and
PostGIS/raster2pgsql 2.1.4 which is my target environment.

Any comments, suggestions, contributions are welcome.

I used plugin-builder and I think it has the minimal requirements to be
uploaded to the plugin repository (at least, as an experimental plugin),
but I would prefer to have some feedback before uploading it there.

Regards

Thanks for your plugin, much appreciate. I'm pretty sure it will be far
more useful if incorporated in Plugin Manager, so the behaviour would
mimic the one for vectors: could you please rework it as a patch of it?
Submitting a pull request through GitHub is quite easy.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSpy+d=POToHvKeE4k52Urf8ybQpFA=tnWv0=36cZMaMMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I may be wrong but I thought there was nightly build in osgeo4w for 2.14
version. Currently 2.14 build is at cf2ebb8
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/cf2ebb8> (from 20 of May, actually the
release of 2.14.3).
Are the daily fixes not available for testing until 2.14.4 release or am I
missing something?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,
I found GRASS GIS Plugin back on track on QGIS 2.15-dev and just tested 
to load and
delete some vector files, the layer is deleted with no leftover so 
everithing seems good now,

thank you, Roy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any plans for implementing vector tile generation
	on QGIS Server?
Message-ID: <9D93FDA1-D519-44F7-B7E8-2A0CA8E2B2D6@gmail.com>

I’d like to know if there are any plans for enabling serving vector tiles from QGIS Server, so they can be used in client libraries like Mapbox GL afterwards. Seems like GDAL (OGR really) MVT driver is stuck in development and there already are some stand-alone implementations, like utilery (https://github.com/tilery/utilery <https://github.com/tilery/utilery>) or Mapnik vector tile (https://github.com/mapbox/mapnik-vector-tile <https://github.com/mapbox/mapnik-vector-tile>), but nothing is integrated with QGIS server. Since Mapbox and ESRI adopted MVT, and most major web basemaps (like Google, Apple etc.) are already vector tile based, it seems like QGIS is running a bit behind in this field. So it would be great to start a discussion on utilising vector tile spec within QGIS.

Cheers

Hi Nikolai

Most vector tile generators can work with any WMS in the background. 
E.g. using MapCache with QGIS server should be perfectly possible.

Marco

 Hi Jürgen,
I think you misunderstood me. I know about the different means to get QGIS
installed and I use Osgeo4w advanced setup for a while.
What I was trying to say is that the QGIS Package  is stuck to 2.14.3 but I
was wrong given that I was not installing qgis-rel-dev but qgis only.

Thanks and sorry for the noise.
H.

Not really - I gave you the list of packages to figure that out.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem editing geometries with no-owner user

Hello,

you need to grant update,delete and insert for the other user on the 
tables .
I have a working QGIS application where all the tables are stored on a 
dedicated Oracle schema and users are connected with another account 
than the schema owner, so I think this is a right problem.

You probably want to add read/write rights to index tables too (MDRT_*).

PS: this is on Oracle 11g with QGIS 2.10 but I am nearly sure that any 
newer version of QGIS will work too !
Cheers !

Hi Paolo,

I will definitely try merging it with dbmanager at some point, but I 
think some testing as a standalone plugin will not hurt.

Also, I am just a basic git user and as dbmanager is part of QGIS, I 
don't know how to fork just the plugin code and not the whole QGIS 
repository, for developing, testing and then submitting the pull-resquest.

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any plans for implementing vector tile
	generation on QGIS Server?
Message-ID: <EF016CE1-547A-4215-B49C-A82D925C5F16@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

As far as I know vector tiles can’t be generated out of WMS services, because WMS spec is mostly used for getting raster images (GetMap request) or feature information (GetFeatureInfo request) and some others. 
I guess you meant WFS really, but I don’t know any caching server implementations that use WFS as a background and generate vector tiled PBFs (particularly in Mapbox Vector Tiles spec <https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec>). 
I didn’t use MapServer MapCache <http://www.mapserver.org/mapcache/>, but according to the docs it doesn’t support vector tiles, only raster ones. MapProxy and TileCache don’t support them either. TileStache can produce vector tiles out of OGR datasource, but in GeoJSON format, which is way heavier than PBF, even gzipped.
So the good way to go would be to use the OGR MVT driver, but unfortunately it’s not released and the status of it’s development is unknown. While web is moving fast towards in-browser rendering (OpenLayers3 and Mapbox GL already utilise WebGL for that) it’s becoming clear QGIS server should support vector tiles at some point. Should I start with a feature request maybe?

Regards,
Nick

Hi Nikolai

Most vector tile generators can work with any WMS in the background. 
E.g. using MapCache with QGIS server should be perfectly possible.

Marco

Hi,

Although it will not change the issue to support vector tiles in QGIS
Server, TileStache does support PBF. It's just that you need the forked
version from Mapzen e.g
https://github.com/mapzen/TileStache/blob/integration-1/TileStache/Goodies/VecTiles/mvt.py

Cheers

Hi guys

Im posting this in the users and dev forums in the hope that someone who
knows someone at Boundless reads this.

I can contact them, but its probably out of normal hours, so will probably
only get an answer tomorrow, and I need an answer quicker than that.

I have been struggling in vain to download the Boundless 2.14.1 Windows
QGIS since last night at around 2100 UTC.  Download stops at 79KB out of
770MB.

I need this specific version, in order to demonstrate to the bosses at work
the Windows and Mac versions in terms of functionality.

I hope anyone can help me, and sorry for posting this in these mailing
lists, but am being desperate lol.

Regards.

Pieter

Hi Nikolai

Oh sorry, was reading the mail in a rush and meant raster tiles.

I don't have much experience with vector tiles. Afaik, they come without 
symbolisation? If yes, is there a reason why the vector tile serving 
needs to be inside QGIS server?  Or could you just use another 
application that you point to the datasource?
E.g. there is an interesting new project called t-rex 
(https://github.com/pka/t-rex), afaik it supports PBF.

Regards,
Marco

No, it will not do, as I specifically need the Boundless version.

Thank you anyway

What are differences between the Boundless and the official version?
I thought they only made a plugin to integrate it within their suite of
services. I didn't know it was a fork!

It depends on what you mean with "fork", it is a fork in github sense and
it's here:  https://github.com/boundlessgeo/QGIS
Specifically:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/QGIS/tree/release-2_14-boundless

The only differences are in the installer and in the particular commits
that were included in the build, in other words the community version
2.14.3 might be slightly different from Boundless version because the
latter might include some specific commits from release-2_14 branch that
were not included in the community, release because of the different  point
in time the two builds were completed.

To make it even more clear: the code base is exactly the same and all fixes
and patches that possibly are in Boundless "fork" (and there aren't any
that I'm aware of at this time) will be eventually merged upstream and
backported when relevant.

Hope this helps.

Im not a huge fan of the "community version" terminology.

QGIS has an official version, found on qgis.org, and a number of flavors
such as boundless :)

Well, first of all, there is officially no such thing as a "community
version" (you can google qgis.org's main domain and documentation, you
won't find a single mention or use of that term).

There's also precedents in the open source world (MySQL comes to mind here)
where a legal entity does a free community version alongside a paid
full-support full-feature version. Many have come to associate "community
version" with that kind of arrangement, and in this case of QGIS it is just
not accurate :)

That said, coming up with flavored versions such as what Boundlessgeo does
is common practice and helps sustain development of QGIS as an open source
product.

Could we please stop top posting and trim what we don't respond to?

"Obviously" the question was about why the official version isn't sufficient
and not about why you don't like the "community" version terminology.

Same here - where "community version" is used it's often describes a crippled
version that is missing some functionality.

Ok, no problem with having "custom" versions. I wouldn't call "community
version" the official one for the same reasons exposed by others.
I'm only concerned for the rise of questions similar to this post, where
users ask for support on custom versions with the serious risk of great
confusion. Whoever decides to distribute its custom version should make
clear that it isn't the official version and should provide specific
support in case there are differences, e.g. distribution channels.

All the best,
Giovanni

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Report 4 - QGIS Symbology Sharing Tools
Message-ID: <CAOnR-i+-4f-8Cd5E-YOyKGhtPuynVP9b5F94-MCpkqH6OBm3zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I want to share the progress of QGIS Symbology Sharing Tool for the GSoC
project. This tool will allow you to share collections (symbol, svgs, etc)
in a repository, fetch it, and use it in QGIS.


What did you get done this week?
This week I worked on:

*Handler Classes*
Handler class is responsible to interact with the repository (fetch the
metadata and download the collections). I made some classes for this:

   - BaseHandler: it's a base class that we can inherit from if we want to
   make another repository handler. It's an abstract class (OK, I don't use
   Python's abc but let's agree that it's an abstract class :)) (
   https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing/blob/master/symbology_sharing/handler/base.py
   ).
   - RemoteGitHandler: It's a base class to deal with remote git handler.
   It's not a concrete class but it's disabled. I create this class so that we
   can easily make handler classes inherit from this (
   https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing/blob/master/symbology_sharing/handler/remote_git_handler.py
   )
   - Github Handler and Bitbucket Handler. It's a concrete class (see here
   https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing/blob/master/symbology_sharing/handler/bitbucket_handler.py).
   It only works for public repositories for now.

So if we want to implement handler for another git remote repository, we
can inherit from RemoteGitHandler and define some methods like in
GithubHandler class.

It wouldn't be hard too to add another handler like FIleSystem Handler
(inheriting from BaseHandler). The handler classes are autoregistered as
long as you inherit it from BaseHandler. If can_handle(url) method is
implemented correctly, the tool will pick the right handler depending on
the URL.

This is the screencast I made to see how handlers work:
https://youtu.be/DxE_PONFsjY

*Parsing Metadata*
After adding a repository, it will fetch the metadata and register
avaialable collections from that metadata (it will only register, not
download).

*Separation between Repository Manager and Collection Manager*
Repository manager is a class responsible for managing repository and
calling the collection manager. Collection manager is responsible for
registering/unregistering collections. Main class only needs to deal with
repository manager.


*What do you plan on doing next week?*
Next week I want to work on:

   - Right now every time users add/edit/delete repo, it will fetch all the
   repositories registered after these actions. I am going to save the
   collections in QSettings when user closes QGIS, and when user
   add/edit/delete repository, it will only update collections belong to that
   repo in the collections registry.
   - Make tests
   - Show the detail of the collections when user clicks a collection.
   - Filter the collections based on the QGIS version
   - Start thinking about upgrading collections mechanism (perhaps we
   should add the version of the collection in the metadata)
   - Start implementing download collection for github and bitbucket
   handler.

If you have some thoughts for me, please email me.

*Are you blocked on anything?*
No.

Hi,

I agree with Jürgen and Matthieu - "community version" has kind of a 
negative touch. Although the original replier (Alessandro) probably did 
not intend/imply this.

The official version from QGIS.ORG shouldn't be called "community 
version" - it is the "offical version".

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for these fixes - it is now more intuitive for me than before 
- and still shows the internatl feature ID - should one dev or admin 
need it.

Oh, gosh sorry, didn't know how to call them to distinguish clearly,
forgive me! And as Andreas said, my personal feeling is that something
"Community" has no less value than anything else, on the contrary I value
it more because it comes from a community instead of an individual or a
company.

Please tell me how should we name the QGIS offical/community/whatever to
avoid confusion when we have to name two different versions on the same
sentence.

"official" is better than "community" ?

What is the preferred way?

"Official" on the contrary sounds a lot like bureocracy to me.

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for the feedback.
Just a short note to avoid confusion: the number in old versions
(<=2.14) was not the feature id.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What is the API for opening and displaying
 HDF5 files through native python console in QGIS?

Hi,

Just use the following


from qgis.core import QgsRasterLayer

layer = QgsRasterLayer(u"/your/path/your_hdf5_file")
if (len(layer.subLayers()) > 1):
    sub_layer = QgsRasterLayer(layer.subLayers()[1], 'sub layer') # Choose
arbitrarily the 2nd sub layer
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(sub_layer)

You can see more code about HDF5 at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/tools/dataobjects.py#L393

Cheers

I think "just" QGIS. The other versions dhould be referred as boundless QGIS, xyz QGIS, etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sharing 1. symbology (styles) and 2. projects
 incl. data and styles (GSoC, relocator, QConsolidate)
Message-ID: <CAFcOn2_mD-ka-_d6Qqc2my==BHaQ4wU6-NBEfpdySudt05uHCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

These are thoughts on sharing 1. a whole QGIS symbology and 2. a whole
QGIS project including symbology and data.

There's a promising current GSoC project, where users ("designers,
cartographers") can << share QGIS style files >> incl. styles (.qml),
symbols (.xml) and SVG markers. End users can download and add styles,
symbols or SVG markers (set of?). See
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/QGIS_Sharing_Repository .

Use case A: What about sharing a symbology with dozens of layers still
without the data? So, this is about users ("style producers") who want
to << share a complete set QGIS styles >> which involves references to
several data layers. End users should be able to open a dataset (like
a vector/raster data from GeoPackage or a QGIS project), and then load
or exchange a "symbology set". This is often the case when data is
split into several regions or when end users capture data of same
schema.

I have no ideas yet to resolve this use case, except taking use case B
as a (rather unmaintainable, intermediate) solution.

Use case B: Users ("producers") want to easily << share a complete
QGIS project >> including data and symbology. Currently for producers,
it is necessary to: 1. Manually collect all required files into a
"project directory" including project file .qgs, data, svg markers,
color ramps (others?), 2. Edit QGIS project to adapt file paths, and
finally 3. zip the directory and send or publish it. End users would
unpack it and double click on the QGIS project file.

Possible approaches are the relocator and QConsolidate plugins
(possibly not maintained any more) and my "All-in-one Project"
(unfinished). And there's Pirmin's idea to put everything into a
GeoPackage file instead of a zip file.

=> Any comments or ideas?

:Stefan

P.S. For more issues on this like locally installed symbol fonts,
temporary/in-memory data layers, databases, secured web services, and
layer provider plugins) see my "All-in-one Project"
(http://giswiki.hsr.ch/All-in-one_Project_QGIS_Plugin).

HI Stefan,

I am the one doing that GSoC project. You remind me that I need to update
the project description in osgeo wiki. The concept has changed a lot since
then. We decided that we would go with sharing collections to a directory
based repository (For now I will implement it for Github and Bitbucket). If
you have some time, I would suggest you to read the current plan here (it
would be long to explain in this email)

Hi Stefan,

I just read your All-In-One Project Plugin documentation here (are you
about to develop it? or already developed it?). I think more or less the
goal would be the same with current GSoC project if we extend the
definition of 'collection' to also contain data itself. So one colleciton
is a self-sufficient QGIS resources (including its data) to create a
coherent map design.

Cheers

Just to add to the whole Qt5 webkit/webengine mess... it looks like
now QtWebKit is being revived:

http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2016-June/026156.html

and

http://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2016-June/026282.html

If this eventuates (and is reflected in the various distro qt5
builds), it's good news for us and for users who rely on composer HTML
items.

Distros have not adopted this yet, beware of premature celebration.

QGIS will remain broken in Debian testing/unstable for the time being.

Development has been suspended in 2015 (similar but independently to
relocator, QConsolidate) as documented here

I would appreciate if you can extend your project to adapt this use case.
But read carefully what I tried to describe (see especially the issues
mentioned in my wiki page)
And be cautious not to overload your project.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding SAGA algorithms in Processing
Message-ID: <576798F0.3090601@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to add some missing SAGA algorithm in Processing.

I saw that the addition is a simple txt file with some parameter:

* name of the SAGA alg (the extact name)
* name of the Processing group in which the alg will be added in Processing
* all the parameters divided by pipes

e.g. the aggregate algorithm is:

Aggregate
grid_tools
ParameterRaster|INPUT|Grid|False
ParameterNumber|SIZE|Aggregation Size|None|None|3
ParameterSelection|METHOD|Method|[0] Sum;[1] Min;[2] Max


there are many interesting SAGA algorithms that can be added but I 
encounter some difficulties with the parameter (names, type, 
default....) even with SAGA standalone opened so I can compare all of them.

I tried to add the SAGA Transpose Table like (and it works):

Transpose Table
table_tools
ParameterTable|INPUT|Input|False
OutputTable|OUTPUT|Output

for more complex algorithms I had a look in existing ones but still it 
is not straightforward.

I'm wondering if somewhere there is some existing documentation and/or 
if it is worth to add just some basic guidelines.

Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi guys. Sorry for the stir here. Was not my intention.

My request was due to the fact that I was tasked to investigate various
support options for both QGIS and PostgreSQL that might be used as part of
a future project.

My organization is a governmental one and it frowns a bit on the use of OS
software and require support contracts in order to manage the project
effectively.

The other factor is form fit and function of OS over Mac and Windows
platforms so that the user has one baseline application with same major and
minor version numbers. Thats why I was looking specifically at the
Boundless version of QGIS.

It was a long shot to assume anyone was in contact with the Boundless guys
but I was desperate for an answer.

Sorry again for the stirring...

Please accept my apology.

Regards.

Pieter

No problem Pieter, I don't think you have to apologize.
Your question was the occasion to discuss this point indeed ;)

Have you tried asking through their support channels?

Hi Stefan,

thank you for your inputs, with this GSOC we are trying to design a system
for sharing generic "resources", without any limitation on their type.

Of course the GSOC project has its own limited resources in terms of time
and goals, but if the design principles will be respected, it will
perfectly possible to add more resource types (like data) in the future.

The general architecture will have repository handlers (to manage different
type of remote/local repositories) and resource handlers to manage the
different type of resources, the resource handlers will have pre/post
processing filters to handle particular cases of resource manipulation in
case we need to alter the resources (think of the paths or the connection
strings) when we import them into the user's QGIS instance.

We discussed a lot about the issues and use cases, some of them need to be
addressed in the core of QGIS (the relative/absolute paths of sybols, the
fonts etc.) and they are far too difficult and time consuming for this
GSOC, but we are trying to keep in mind the whole big picture when working
on this new sharing system and we are trying  to avoid any hardcoded
blocker for future expansions.

Feel free to have a look to the code and participate directly to this
project if you feel like that and if you have time/resources for helping us.

Thanks!

In the grass folder of processing there is a file explaining the

can follow that doc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] many R plots output in Processing
Message-ID: <5767B1C7.500@gmail.com>

Hi all (again),

I'm writing some R scripts that produce some plots.
If I'm not wrong (else I am doing something wrong) it seems that it is 
not possible to display many outputs, that is the only the last plot is 
shown, overwriting the previous(es) ones

I tried the following:

##Vector processing=group
##showplots
##showplots


and

##Vector processing=group
##showplots
##showplots2


but always the same result..

Am I missing something?

Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

R scripts can produce only 1 plots with showplots parameter.
If you want many plots as output you have to draw all in 1.
There is an example here 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing/tree/master/rscripts made by 
JEANDENANS Laura.

René-Luc

No, WebKit support was only removed from the python-qt4 because Qt4 is 
EOL making security support for such a security issue prone component 
infeasible.

WebKit support may still be removed from Qt4, but the Qt maintainers 
have not made a final decision on that yet.

Kind Regards,

I think forking the entire repo is the simplest option, and it does not
hurt (disk space is cheap).
All thee best, and thanks.

The announcement cited above concerns only Qt5 and is mainly important
for the mid- to long-term strategy concerning embedded web views.

I'm glad to hear that we can assume that plugins using webkit code will
not have to be rewritten and we also don't have to update code in core
for a different backend.

Matthias

I am from the ESRI world and what Paolo is describing is how ArcMap works, so
when I first started using QGIS I wanted QGIS to work the same and therefore
I created the plugin. 

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/syncComposerWithMap/

There is lots of room for improvement in the plugin.  A signal and slot
could be added so that it will synchronize always.  It could deal with
multiple map views better.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No more image saving in Processing Result Viewer
Message-ID: <5768125D.7030600@gmail.com>

Hi all,

working a lot on R - Processing today.
I noticed 2 problems:

* output tables won't be created due to a missing ``)`` solved with the 
pull request [0]
* when the output is a plot it seems it is not possible to save the plot 
as image anymore. Right click on the plot and the old Menu with all the 
saving options is not there

Am I missing something?

BTW, the same issue also with the default QGIS plot algorithms.

Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi,

I have some code to build a vector tile based on qgsVectorLayer but I 
have not yet time to build a QGIS Server Plugin to use it. I'll be 
pleased to do it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add Layers to spatialite database
Message-ID: <5768191A.8030601@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I would like to add layers into a spatialite database. I have use the 
QgsVectorFileWriter method

parcDisSHP='/xxx/xxx/xxx/xxx/FILE.shp'
parcelasDis = QgsVectorLayer(parcDisSHP, 'Parcelas_Unicas', "ogr")

/QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(parcelasDis, 
"/xxx/xxx/xxx/xxx/database.sqlite", "utf-8", None, "SQLite", False, None 
,["SPATIALITE=YES"])

/But this method it seems good for create the database and insert just 
one layer. If I repeat the operation for other layers, this rewrite the 
Database again.

What should I do to add more layers to this DB?/

/Is there some others ways to do this operation?/
/

becase of you are running raster2postgres command via subprocess, do
you mind would be better to add it as Processing script/command?

remember that using an external command does not give you the help to
have credential stored in the QGIS Authnetication Manager...

another note, try to use subprocess.popen and not .call to avoid user
interface block for long operations.

Hi,

If I recall correctly, with GDAL2 in OSGeo4w, Windows users have now the
capabilities to edit Map Info files.

Is this available for other platforms, too? I often read "GDAL is in
Osgeo4w" and not "GDAL2 is in QGIS", reason why I'm asking....
I mean, if documenting map info files edit, should it be indicated that it
currently concerns only Windows users?

Thank you,
Harrissou

That depends on the distribution and repository used. For example, on Ubuntu 
16.04 if using ubuntugis-unstable PPA, you get QGIS 2.14.1 + GDAL 2.1.0.

Safest answer: people have to check in the About dialog: if it indicates GDAL 
2.0 or later, then they have .tab edition capabilities.

Thanks for your answers. Even, I will keep in mind your safest answer.
But before I claim that everybody can somehow easily have access to mapinfo
files editing capabilities, any idea about MAC users?

That's the same story. There's nothing OS specific here (the OGR regression 
tests for .tab edition work on the Travis MacOSX instance). It only depends on 
against which GDAL version QGIS has been built.

Maybe... I mean, for now, as it is a "standalone" plugin which does not
connect to the database, it probably is a good idea.
But, if added as a processing sub-plugin, will it be able to find the db
connection selected either in the "sources-browser" tree or in
db-manager? That functionality will be needed when the raster2pgsql
output is sent directly to the db connection.

Sure, I just grabbed the first option that appeared on the python
manual. It would also be nice to show the progress, but apparently
raster2pgsql doesn't output some kind of feedback which could be used in
that way.

Thanks

Hi all,

Does it happens with any data of yours? can you share a sample

I try to build QGIS 2.14.3 with QT 5.3.2 in fedora 21, now I need build python3-qt5-devel-5.3.2-6.fc21.rpm, I use python-qt5-5.3.2-6.fc21.src.rpm to build it. But when I run

rpmbuild -bb python-qt5.spec

it says " error: line 63: unknown symbol: %filter_provides_in /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages /usr/lib64/qt5/plugins"

it seems like the"%filter_provides_in" is not recognized, what should I do now?

Hi Giovanni,

thanks for the answer..

in attach the sample shape I used (really small)..

I tried several algorithms (.v.buffer, v.voronoi) and with all it fails 
with the same error.. same algorithms but different provider (QGIS, 
SAGA) work

Grass 6.4 on Debian stable

maybe I'm missing some grass library?

Thanks again

Matteo

Hei Matteo,

Any particular reason for using GRASS GIS 6.4 instead of the latest stable GRASS GIS 7?
GRASS 7 will give you more functionality and much better performance! And probably not the same issues?

Cheers

grass 6 is the one on the official Debian stable repository. grass 7

Users of the GRASS packages on Debian stable has not expressed a need 
for GRASS 7 backports, so no attempt has been made to provide backports 
for GRASS 7.

Please refer to the thread on the debian-gis list:

  https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis/2016/04/msg00049.html

If there is significant demand expressed for GRASS 7 packages on Debian 
stable, I'll reconsider providing a backport.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,


I'm just experiencing that compiling grass on debian stable is not that 
easy.. some trouble with wx-config and numpy.. it seems that there is a 
bug with wayland making not recognize it the right version of numpy 
installed

I don't know how much time it could takes for you to back port grass 7.. 
for sure having grass 7 also on debian stable would be great, but not if 
I'm the only user asking for it

Thanks Bas

Matteo

UbuntuGIS Stable ships GRASS 7 for Trusty.
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?field.series_filter=trusty

And even plain Ubuntu ships GRASS 7 for the not LTS versions:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=grass

Differences in performance and functionality between GRASS 6 and GRASS 7 are huge!

I can only recommend switching to GRASS 7...

the problem is the column "time" in your vector, that apparently G6
cannot handle,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] custom charts?
Message-ID: <576A8249.2060901@terglobo.nl>

Dear developers,

Can I somehow show custom images for each point feature on a map,
similar to the layer diagrams?

Having locations with a few sensor values, I'd like to generate a custom
image for every feature (for example svg or png) and have it displayed
on my feature.

I've come up with some ideas:

- Create many custom svg files in a directory linked to qgis, and
afterwards create a long rule-based style for every unique feature;

- Add a text field to my feature layer containig svg, and somehow make
qgis display that on my map;

- Add a text field to my feature layer containig a path to a png (or
svg), and somehow make qgis display that on my map.

None of those options seems to be possible. Does anybody know a solution?

Thanks!

Raymond

are maptips an option or do you need always on images?
in 2.16 you'll be able to have full html maptips which would solve your
issue.

An SVG marker with the file name defined as an expression ?

Message-ID: <CAJOp35nU_4s+EVfZ2LASEbqnmKBQM=dWDXyLY1--XEgHiFx2qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGis devs,

Saga has just released the first RC candidate for version 2.3.0 [1]. For
those missing the earlier discussions, our goal is to make 2.3.x a long
term stable branch, ideal for eg using in processing.

This also means that now is an ideal time to test saga and report any
problems back, so we can still fix them before the 2.3 release.

One issue which was mentioned on this list, that saga_cmd only worked with
shapefiles [2] has been resolved: you can now pass other files supported by
ogr [3]. This could be very interesting for processing.

Kind Regards,
Johan

Are you sure? This would mean that the value(!) of an attribute would
contain the actual svg (code, not filename).
Any example on how to use that with styling then?

Same here, while we managed to get for example colors dynamic, we could
not find a way (yet) to set the marker-svg once filename is retrieved
from an attribute...

Happy to get an example or pointers :-)

Hmmm exact, I don't think you can include the content (I tried to
include a data url but it does not work).

with an SVG-marker the filename can be "data-defined", so you can for
instance use an expression like '/xxx/mymarker_' || id || '.svg'

Thanks to open the issue.

We encountered the same behavoir on QGIS Server.

The crash is due to `QgsEditorWidgetRegistry::mapLayerWillBeRemoved` 
when the cast is done `QgsVectorLayer* vl = 
qobject_cast<QgsVectorLayer*>( mapLayer );` QGIS crashed.

Some one to fix it ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interpretation of a 3 point CircularString with p0
	== p2 (circle)
Message-ID: <201606231532.20990.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I just came into a difference how QGIS and GDAL interpret a CircularString made 
of a 3 points p0, p1, p2 where p0 == p2, which is a way of representing a full 
circle.

GDAL interprets p1 as the symetrical point of p0 with respect to the center
(https://github.com/osgeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrcircularstring.cpp#L640), 
that is p1 is on the perimeter of the circle, or said otherwise the center of 
the circle is the midpoint of [p0,p1].
Whereas QGIS interprets p1 as the center of the circle ( 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/geometry/qgsgeometryutils.cpp#L359 
)

I'd think GDAL interpretation is the right one, since according to 
http://jtc1sc32.org/doc/N1101-1150/32N1107-WD13249-3--spatial.pdf (ISO SQL MM 
Part 3), paragraph 4.1.6 :
(let's call this sentence S1)
""" In the case where the segment is a circle, then the center is located 
at the midpoint of the line connecting the start point with the intermediate 
point. """

But if you look a bit above in the paragraph, there's a sentence (call it S2) 
: """In the special case where a segment is a complete circle, that is, the 
start and end points are coincident, then the intermediate point shall be the 
midpoint of the segment. """, which looks confusing at first. I think this 
sentence must be interpreted considering distances along the curve, in which 
case the "midpoint of the segment" when doing a full walk along the circle 
from p0 back to p0 is the symetrical point of p0 with respect to the center.

I think this interpretation is also more logical since, even in that 
particular case, p0,p1,p2 are all on the arc, like in the general case.

I can also see that PostGIS (in https://github.com/postgis/postgis/blob/svn-
trunk/liblwgeom/lwalgorithm.c#L252 ) has the same interpretation as GDAL (*)

I'd be happy to read opinions regarding this.

Even

(*) Can also be shown with :

# SELECT 
ST_AsText(ST_Envelope(ST_CurveToLine(ST_GeomFromText('CIRCULARSTRING(-1 0,1 
0,-1 0)'))));
              st_astext               
--------------------------------------
 POLYGON((-1 -1,-1 1,1 1,1 -1,-1 -1))

And http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.2/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html says 
"The exception to this is for a closed circle, where the start and end points 
are the same. In this case the second point MUST be the center of the arc, ie 
the opposite side of the circle.", which is another way to rephrase S2.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interpretation of a 3 point CircularString
 with p0 == p2 (circle)

Hi Even,
this difference catched my eye too. I think SQL MM (and consequently GDAL
and PostGIS) interpration is more logical, and I would suggest QGIS should
follow it too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem definig snapping options programmatically
Message-ID: <7208D119001E804CA9A367B852EF63A0457FB357@POSEIDON.eftasgmbh.local>

Hi developers,

i'm facing a problem which i do not understand. In our plugin I created a function to set snapping options and bound it to a shortcut.
Using Qgis 2.14.3, source code see below.

The assigned shortcut works well, but for the snapping I have to do the following on every QGIS start:
Go to snapping options, mode = advanced, press ok (without changing anything). Then it works afterwards!
But when I print the options before I do this, I definitely get the right options (see below).

Does anyone know what I'm missing? Should I open an bug report? Is there a workaround do do: "Go to snapping options, mode = advanced, press ok" programmatically ?

Thanks for any help
Christian

Hi Christian,

Does it help if you call

    QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged()

Cheers
Matthias

Hi Even

I agree it will be good to follow the postgres / gdal interpretation. 
Reading S2, I somehow thought the segment midpoint would be the circle 
midpoint, but it's not the same.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Get size of SVG in Python
Message-ID: <1466690561132-5273032.post@n6.nabble.com>

I need to get the width and height of an SVG file used as an SVG marker
symbol layer. To be explicit, the dimensions I need are the width and height
attributes of the <svg> element. What's the best way to do that in PyQGIS?
Parse the XML (never done that in Python yet)? Or something in the QGIS API?
Some other technique?

Thanks

Tom

This works:

xml.etree.ElementTree.parse(sl.path()).getroot().attrib["width"]

Happy with that unless there is A Better Way.

Hi John

See Matthias's answer on this list just today to a more recent question.
Does that do the trick?

Tom

Sorry, should probably be

QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged.emit()

... I didn't verify that it works ...

Hi Raymond, 

Do you have an example how such a visualization could look like? Kind of
a mockup? 

In QGIS master, Matthieu Pellerin added additional simple markers now
(e.g. half/third/quarter circles, squares, triangles, etc.), e.g. to
create wingcharts. The combination of custom anchor points, offsets,
rotation and scaling on the symbol level allows for many interesting
visualizations - such as the "wing chart" showing commuters at train
stations by type (work, education, leisure, etc) at
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/commuters_by_type.png. With these
basic symbols you can also do other chart types as combinations of
scaled, rotated and offseted simple symbols to visualize sensor values. 

More such simple markers could be added, should there be the need for. 

Hope this helps, 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbology export in save as feature
Message-ID: <5496926.QdSdXQbAJe@tatras>

Hello,

Working in the "save as ..." feature documentation I wondering what "Symbology 
export" parameters mean. There are 3 possibilities: "No symbology", "Feature 
symbology" and "Symbol layer symbology".

Any idea what does it mean?

Thanks,

Y.

Hi all,

This is the same issue that I had a few months ago [1].  (Thanks Tom for flagging it up).

You can recreate in the console as follows as follows (QGIS 2.14.3, with one vector layer loaded):

```
vlayer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers().values()[0]
proj = QgsProject.instance()
proj.setSnapSettingsForLayer(vlayer.id(), True, QgsSnapper.SnapToVertex, QgsTolerance.LayerUnits, 5.0, False)
```

The settings are not applied.

"Settings > Snapping Options > Snapping Mode" remains at "Current Layer".  Changing this to to "Advanced" shows correct values have been set, but they are not activated until "Apply" is pressed.

Connecting a function to QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged() shows that the signal fires with no arguments when setSnapSettingsForLayer is called.  Emitting the signal manually does nothing.

Cheers
John

Hi Yves, 

This has mainly "historic" reasons. 

It was introduced specifically when saving QGIS layers to DXF through
OGR. I believe also the KML export is affected to some extent. 

Our first attempt to export QGIS layer to DXF went through OGR with OGR
feature  - however, this was too limited, and it was abandoned. 

"No symbology" means, simple black default lines 

"Feature symbology" means "Save with OGR Feature Styles" 

"Symbol Layer symbology" means "Save with OGR Feature Styles but export
the same geometry multiple times if there are multiple symbology symbol
layers used" 

Meanwhile the DXF export from QGIS goes through a native DXF writer -
without OGR, so the above approach was abandoned and hasn't been worked
on for some years now. 

------------------------- 

I hope this explains what it does, but as I said it is limited for
export to DXF/KML or potentially formats that support OGR feature styles
- formats that can handle styles. 

For QGIS 3.0 I see the following ways to get rid of this: 

1. keep it but improve it (unlikely) 

2. hide it for layers that don't support OGR feature styles (can be
combined with 1.) 

3. get rid of it completely (my preferred option if 1. does not happen) 

BTW: 2. could probably be done for QGIS 2.16 and 2.14 already, to have
fewer confused users ... 

Hope this explains it. 

What do others think?

Hi John,

sorry I think I don't understand your mail at the moment. As I understand it, this is exactly my problem or is here a solution in it? 
I tried QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged.emit() but it seems that it has no effect and like below fires with no argument.
Settings are set but are not applied.

The only "solution" which I see at the moment is:
"Settings > Snapping Options > Snapping Mode" remains at "Current Layer".  Changing this to to "Advanced" shows correct values have been
set, but they are not activated until "OK" is pressed.

Thanks for the help
Christian

Hi Christian,

Yes, my problem is exactly the same as yours, and so I have the same questions, too:

- is it a bug or a feature that the settings are not applied immediately by setSnapSettingsToLayer()?
- is there a way to change snapping settings to Advanced via Python?

Thanks,
John

Hi Hugo,

It works! Thanks a lot!!

This is exactly what i was looking for, but somehow could not find.

Here is a little example with some fake svg's:

Now I will script generating svg based on real data.

Pretty cool - so we can deliver script-generated SVG code instead of a
filename? Nice! 

Care to do a blog post with some example? This sounds quite exciting to
me.

Are you sure? This would mean that the value(!) of an attribute would
contain the actual svg (code, not filename).
Any example on how to use that with styling then? 
Hmmm exact, I don't think you can include the content (I tried to
include a data url but it does not work).

Same here, while we managed to get for example colors dynamic, we could
not find a way (yet) to set the marker-svg once filename is retrieved
from an attribute...

Happy to get an example or pointers :-) 
with an SVG-marker the filename can be "data-defined", so you can for
instance use an expression like '/xxx/mymarker_' || id || '.svg'

Raymond,

Code generated SVGs is a pretty cool idea.  Would be super keen to see that
once you have something!

It would be also cool to be able to directly use a string as image
content for a marker (rather than just for the filename).
That should be quite easy to do.

Have a look at my code for doing lots of snapping stuff like that,
feel free to borrow it under GPLv2+:

https://github.com/lparchaeology/libarkqgis/blob/master/snapping.py

Really must get around to releasing that plugin I wrote to configure
snapping using a single toolbar button...

Hugo,

That would be way cooler!

For now, I just write generated svg files to a temp directory and add
links to them to every feature.

Strings might get long though. Here is for example the code from my
dummy image (1.4kb):

Hi Raymond, 

Well - 90% is some default Inkscape/RDF junk. You can trim this down to
four lines - header, the path element and the closing SVG element. 

Also, some of the styling parameters are unncessary, as SVG has default
values - not necessary, to write fill-opacity:1;, because this already
the default. 

BTW: Inkscape can save to "Optimized SVG", which should also be much
smaller.

    Are you sure? This would mean that the value(!) of an attribute
    would
    contain the actual svg (code, not filename).
    Any example on how to use that with styling then? 
    Hmmm exact, I don't think you can include the content (I tried to
    include a data url but it does not work).

    Same here, while we managed to get for example colors dynamic,
    we could
    not find a way (yet) to set the marker-svg once filename is
    retrieved
    from an attribute...

    Happy to get an example or pointers :-) 
    with an SVG-marker the filename can be "data-defined", so you can
for
    instance use an expression like '/xxx/mymarker_' || id || '.svg'

Actually, we already have a "template" concept in SVG, if you look at
the SVG shipped with QGIS, they have things like fill="param(fill)"
allowing to have the filling color as a user parameter.

That could be easily extended to also support feature's attributes and
expressions.

That's a cool idea. It would be similar to the HTML element in print
composer, where one can also mix static and dynamic HTML code - with
Expressions. It would be very flexible. 

Maybe this could even be further extended to also allow Javascript
inside the SVG code (like a web-browser does). The HTML element in print
composer also has support for JSON onload-data based on relations. That
could also be useful for such custom SVG generators created with
Javascript. 

See
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/794ab065dc7ada524ee9b284f90ea70c8e4c75c8
 

Just brainstorming a bit ;-)

    Are you sure? This would mean that the value(!) of an attribute
    would
    contain the actual svg (code, not filename).
    Any example on how to use that with styling then? 
    Hmmm exact, I don't think you can include the content (I tried to
    include a data url but it does not work).

    Same here, while we managed to get for example colors dynamic,
    we could
    not find a way (yet) to set the marker-svg once filename is
    retrieved
    from an attribute...

    Happy to get an example or pointers :-) 
    with an SVG-marker the filename can be "data-defined", so you can
for
    instance use an expression like '/xxx/mymarker_' || id || '.svg'

Hi all,

Great idea indeed.
Here is another example of "dynamic" SVG, used here to render PNG as
symbols in QGIS. Not with expressions but with a Python method.
https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/d66191ccfadd74cff3f0

It is derived of the work of Nathan Woodrow:
http://nathanw.net/2016/02/04/live-svgs/

This could be adapted to create a SVG from a template via Python tools like
template:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#template-strings
or more advanced template engines


​Cheers,
Michaël​

Message-ID: <1466844535622-5273308.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Luca has written some new raster export code. It works on LTR and 2.14. It
works for him on Github master. It doesn't work on nightly for me or on
Travis. Discussion here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/pull/297#issuecomment-228524584

It seems that master has a more recent version of processing
gdalogr:warpreproject than dev nightlies. What can be causing this
difference?

Thanks

Tom

Hi,
Thank you Andreas, I can now stop expecting to create a shapefile with a
qml (or at least, keeping the original symbology) using this option.

About what to do, I fully agree with your suggestions: let's improve it if
doable (otherwise remove) and at least hide it from formats that are not
compatible to avoid users being confused.

Regards,
Harrissou

I always wondered what this was for..

What about hide it from the gui NOW, untill it is working for other formats.

As exporting a dxf layer is not encouraged anymore isn't it?
The 'new' way is to export the project, yes?

This would be great also for nautical charts to render light sectors from
S57 data.

Could existing code editor be used to construct the svg with some python
svg library?

There is this library to make it easier:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svgwrite/

And since it is python, you can use the standard code editor in QGIS (or
an external one if you prefer).

Hi Devs,

Two minor wms-provider fixes commited to current master I like to be
cherry picked to 2.14.

Is that ok?
Can somebody do that for me?

first:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3213/commits/5d80299938d31f1624826fb548e5328f87e5eda6

and then:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f7c1506973dbeee62f96ca65cb06201607877ea2

It's both about the wms legendimage not or wrong showing up in layermanager.

I tried this locally here, but was unsure if I needed to be new PR or
not. I'm also not confident enough doing it, or screwing up 2.14 branch...

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

I made a video of the progress so far:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ2Vh3a63U


*What did you get done this week?*

   - Saving the metadata of the collections to local as a cache (after some
   operations like adding/removing/deleting repository) so that when user
   doesn't have internet, (s)he will still be able to browse collection.
   - Filtering collections with custom QSortFilterProxyModel to allow
   filtering based on author, name, description, etc.
   - Fix unicode problem (The problem is when parsing the metadatafile.
   Using ConfigParser it was read as str. Changed it to SafeConfigParser with
   codecs module)
   - Implemented reload repositories. Also when fetching metadata, never
   use cache
   - Implemented Ale's suggestion to have a directory file in official
   repository and containing available repositories (and by default all those
   repositories will be registered in the plugin)
   - Still thinking to use git as it will be more efficient rather than
   using zip url and tried Dulwich (Python pure git implementation), but it's
   freezing the UI (see the video above)

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - My code is getting harder to read. Need to refactor some and make tests
   - Tried to load a repository that contains 1000 collections. Right now,
   I just saved the metadata's cache (dict) to the qsettings. The QGIS config
   file is getting too big. WIll move this to a separate pickled file.
   - Explored Dulwich more


Are you blocked on anything?
I have problem with Dulwich. It's freezing the UI. I want to show the
progress of cloning/pulling repository realtime but I haven't figured out a
way yet.

Hi Akbar,

thanks a lot for the update, I especially liked the video, this makes it
a lot easier for the audience (at least me :) ) to get an impression of
the status quo. Good job so far!

Concerning dulwich, did you checkout the #dulwich IRC channel and the
mailing list which are mentioned in the project's readme [1] ?

What exactly are the efficiency problems you are referring to? Maybe
it's also worth looking into downloading individual files over http
instead of the whole .zip file (raw.githubusercontent.com), that also
allows doing partial downloads if you don't need a complete repository
and you know which files you want.

Looking forward to hearing more of this project, keep up the good work!

Matthias

@Marcus: forwarding this to the Developers mailing list, as I think
there are more people there who maybe can help.
Good that you publish both data + problems! Even better maybe create
issues (with if possible more slimmed down dataset)...

@All: I think as a FOSS gis community we should really try get
GeoPackage flying as a well known defined, working(!) GIS package format.

So: let's all try to work with GeoPackage, and fix problems we
encounter. So we do not get stuck with a defacto (other 1 company)
standard...

*Background (a bit of the business case for non his users..ignore if
required ;-)*

Statistical Agencies traditionally publish statistical data related to
statistical areas separately from the statistical boundaries that
defines these areas. This creates a significant barrier to the use of
these data in general mapping applications and more specialised spatial
analysis systems.
To remove this barrier the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is
evaluating the use of GeoPackage as an output format for facilitating
the publication of both geospatial and statistical data. GeoPackage has
a number of advantages one of the most significant is the ability to
define database views. A database view is SQL statement that results in
the creation of a “virtual” table that can be  The use of *database
views* within the GeoPackage database container provides a efficient
mechanism to maintain the relationship (the relational join) between the
statistical boundaries (“geometries”) and the statistical (“attribute")
data.

By maintaining this relationship in a single published product this
reduces the barrier to their use in mapping applications, reduces the
probability of introduced error, increases the ease of use of
statistical data in the community.

*The Problem...*

QGIS is not seem to fully support database views in GeoPackage. In some
respects QGIS works as expected, but spatial and attribute selections
and the display of the attribute table produce incorrect results.

Example GeoPackage File:

SA1_BCP_B01_05.gpkg (134 MB)
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz44nz9iptC5NkF5WlpEZjBoSVk>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz44nz9iptC5NkF5WlpEZjBoSVk

Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011 Census Data
Product: Basic Community Profile. Statistical Tables B01 to B05

Images illustrating the issues
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz44nz9iptC5YjlrLV9vRFhmVE0>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz44nz9iptC5YjlrLV9vRFhmVE0

Things that work...

1. Views are identified as layers and can be loaded into the Layers Panel
2. Polygons are drawn as expected.
3. The Identify Feature tool can be used to highlight and individual
polygon and display the correct associated attribute data.
4. Styling and classification algorithms can be applied to compose
correct choropleth maps.

Things that do not work...

1. QGIS is not displaying the Attribute Table of a GeoPackage view
correctly. Attribute values are repeated for a single row.
2. Any Select operation that is applied either to the attributes or the
geometries results in the whole layer being selected.

In summary it looks like whilst the geometries of a GeoPackage view are
being interpreted correctly the link to the underlying attributes in a
view is not. Incidentally, neither the latest version of ArcGIS or
MapInfo Profession can interpret views in GeoPackage either and this has
been identified as a bug by both organisations.

Any help from some one who knows their way around how GeoPackage is
interpreting views would be gratefully received.

Marcus.

An issue report would certainly be good.

My first wild guess reading this is that there is some trouble with the
mapping the feature id to primary keys.

One additional observation (fresh master of today):

- I downloaded the dataset
- loaded the layer/view sa1_bo1_map_v into QGIS
- opened the attributetable and see all the same values in the cells

But
- Open DB Manager (Plugin?),
- Create a connection to it
- Select this sa1_bo1_map_v node
- I see the correct(?) cell values (and very fast, compared to QGIS itself?)

When I open with browser, I get the same wrong result...

Regards,

Richard

The issue is that the OGR GeoPackage driver cannot derive an integer primary 
key from the view, and affects 0 as the fid for all features. In the case of the 
views of this particular dataset, the OBJECTID field could be used as the FID 
(given some logic to be implemented in the driver to analyze the structure of 
the view, the underlying tables and the unicity constraints on the join fields)

I'm not aware of a way of doing it :

Here's a failed attempt :
sqlite> create unique index foo on sa1_b01_map_v ( OBJECTID );
Error: views may not be indexed

I'd be curious if other databases have a way of doing it, but my feeling is 
that I don't think it is possible for normal dynamic views. (Unless you are 
using a materialized view as in Postgres for example)

That would be a possibility, although that would still require an enhancement 
in the OGR side to accept the name of the PKID as an option.

Anyway as a fallback in the absence of a PKID a sequential numbering would 
probably be desirable (with the caveat that it wouldn't be stable when 
attribute or spatial filters are applied, which could cause some problems )

Ok... so, is this a driver challenge?

Or is it more an explicit problem, because the view is created without
explicit primary key?

Because, instead of putting 'some logic' into the driver trying to guess
a primary key, we can maybe create some kind of PK-constraint?

Like: a view (just like an Oracle table?) should have some kind of
primary key defined? If not: ask for it, so it is defined into the view
definition (uh... not sure IF that is possible at all in a view...).
Or QGIS asks for it: showing the attributes, and letting the user choose
the id('s) that the user (thinks) are unique and should be used as
primary key...

To be honest, instead of driven by (technological) knowledge, I'm more
driven by a desire to make GeoPackage a successfull format :-)

Regards and thanks for picking this up so swift.

Hi all,
using repo http://qgis.org/debian-nightly-release Processing is broken

I didn't check in the code, but likely rendering "just" iterates over features 
and doesn't care about their FID. And for identification, it is a spatial 
query, which ends up being an iteration over all features too (since, with 
views, spatial indexes are not - at least currently - used. Could probably be 
improved too since the Spatialite driver can use the underlying table spatial 
index for Spatialite views. But Spatialite has an explicit declaration of 
which pkid to use and the geometry column of the base table in its 
views_geometry_columns table).
On the contrary the attribute table works with a feature cache based on FID.

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately raw URL is only provided for a
single file, not a directory. As one repository could have many collections
(collection is a directory containing resources), with git protocol, there
are 2 ways downloading a single collection from a repository: git sparse
checkout and git archive. Sparse checkout is not supported in Dulwich nor
in Pygit2 (a Python wrapper using libgit2). And with the 2nd option, Github
doesn't allow git archive.

One other alternative (which I am exploring now) is to clone a repository
the first time user downloads a collection from that repository, and next
time user downloads other collections from that repository, we just need to
update and pull that repository. This is more efficient compared to
downloading the whole repository (using zip url) every time user wants to
download a collection.

We came to the decision that one repository could have many collections in
the first place as it doesn't make sense  (we thought) for users to create
one repository only for one collection.

Cheers

Couldn't all the files be downloaded individually?
This will result in a couple of additional requests, but I'm not sure
this is something to worry about.
The main question would then be, where the client could retrieve the
file list (paths relative). Generating this list could be part of the
upload script.

Is the plan to mainly have users create their own repositories (and then
manually enter the path to them in the style manager - or have a
repository of repositories :) )?
Or to have one main repository with many collections (like currently
with the plugins)?

If it's the first, I wouldn't care too much about the couple of extra
bytes downloaded.
If it's the second, that may result in some huge download and disk space
consumption caused by one or a few collections.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Copy/paste polygon to line shapefile
Message-ID: <CAECJsSo2qoRMKprrDeLmHo9w-7TvtkaR8=-or5-m4qMJ3TrVpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Testing some digitizing tools (2.14.3), I discovered a feature that I
wonder if it's a bug or a new capability.
Let's take two layers (polygon and line) - I use shapefile.
Select a polygon feature and copy/paste it in the line layer. If I'm not
wrong QGIS used to complain about geometry not matching but surprisingly,
it pastes the feature in the line layer.
It seems that it takes the edge of the polygon, generating what I suppose
to be a closed linestring.
The inverse is also possible (copying line to polygon closes that line into
a polygon feature).
Is it by design?
If it's not a bug, is it possible to make the behavior consistent and allow
copy to point layer (retrieving the vertices)?

Thanks,
Harrissou

Subject: [Qgis-developer] restore SAGA algorithm helps?
Message-ID: <57711C5B.3030406@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I don't remember since which version, but the Help Tab in Processing has 
been changed and reviewed.

Since then all the SAGA help files (ok the few there were documented) 
have disappeared.. I noticed that python/plugins/processing/algs/saga 
dir has not the help directory anymore..

I have a backup of the help files (not sure if all of them).. isn't it 
worth to restore them?

maybe some doc writer (me included) can find some time to improve them..

even if just a few algorithms are documented is better then nothing, IMHO

Thanks

Matteo

+1
if the system is in place, I'm positive we can find additional writers.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Number of arguments for processing

I am getting very confused. Is my understanding of all this correct:

1. Different versions of QGIS ship different versions of GDAL

2. Different versions of QGIS ship different versions of Processing

3. Different versions of Processing support different versions of GDAL (or
at least, support different functional subsets, down to the argument level)

How do I untangle all of this in order successfully to call warpreproject in
a QGIS plugin? Current situation:

I try: one warpreproject call with 18 arguments, and except: a call with 16

This works locally for me (Win7x64) on LTR, 2.14, and latest nightly. On
Travis, it works on LTR and 2.14, but fails on nightly.

Discussion here: https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/pull/297

Thanks

Tom

Unlike line-to-poly and poly-to-line, one could only go poly-to-point or
line-to-point, not point-to-line or point-to-poly, as you have no
information on the order of the points in the line or poly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geometry().geometry() not stable ?
Message-ID: <927602DAB9485D4B88E5938BFE4D74560A18AA17@LSWMBXP02.lausanne.ch>

Hello,
I'm working on a Python plugin with 3D features. But I have some issues with the available methods.

What I'm doing :

- layer->startEditing, to set the layer editable if it's not yet the case (asking the user to do it)
- feature->geometry->geometry, to have the 3D geometry for my feature
- then I manipulate the geometry
- layer->changeGeometry, to update the geometry of my feature
Until the, It works fine...
- I keep my layer editable, and try to do the same with another feature
- but : I can do feature->geometry, but feature->geometry->geometry give me "Access violation - no RTTI data!"
- and if I add updateExtents + commitChanges to save my layer, and try to do the same again, the feature->geometry->geometry leads to a mini dump

Anyone to explain to me what's going on ?

Thanks for the answer,

Christophe Gusthiot

A simpler question which derives from this: is there a matrix showing which
arguments are required for which versions of each Processing algorithm?

Hello everyone,

I try to build QGIS-master from source on my debian 8 system

with self compiled versions of:

qt 4.8.6
python 2.7

see here:

Compilation runs fine without any trouble,
but nearly all test fail,
and when I try to start :

christoph at excelsior:~/ qgis

why this ?

Hello everyone,

I try to build QGIS-master from source on my debian 8 system

with self compiled versions of:

gdal 2.2.0
liblas 1.8.0
grass 7.04.
proj 4.9.2
geos 3.5.0
spatiliteindex 1.8.4
libspatialite 4.3.0a
netcdf-4-4.0
wxWidges3.1.0
cmake 3.5.2
qwt-6.1
qwt-polar 1.1.1

debian:
qt 4.8.6
python 2.7

see here:

-- QGIS version: 2.15.0 Master (21500)
-- Could not find GRASS 6

Compilation runs fine without any trouble,
but nearly all test fail,
and when I try to start :

christoph at excelsior:~/ qgis
Speicherzugriffsfehler

why this ?

I may be late to the party, but I really do not get the point of using
git here for data retrieval.
And furthermore, I wouldn't want QGIS to have a hard dependency on git,
which is a developer tool users are not supposed to have installed by
default.

If you want to focus on the client part of the feature and not implement
a resource server, maybe a simpler approach would be better for a start.

Why not having a metadata file (JSON or XML) listing the resources
provided by the repository, and then the raw files at specified urls.
All of this served by a bare HTTP server, no more no less.
If some want to manage versioning of the resources and use github for
that, they can use the site generation tool (github pages) to do so.
Easy and lightweight. Or if we do not want to depend on a proprietary
platform, just generate the metadata+data files on any HTTP hosting
platform.
And we can later write a full resource server in our language of choice
to dynamically serve resources and metadata.

My 2 cents, sorry if this has been discussed before.

It would be best to file a ticket with all this information,
and ideally a script that can be run to reproduce the problem.

Hi Christophe,

forwarding to dev list...
(I see you did another post yourself too...)

But do I see:
libQt5Widgets.so.5 ??

Are you aware that you are using Qt5.
Because building that is still experimental (but could be ok if you know
what you are doing).

Better to remove all the Qt5 stuff, and be sure that all your paths
point to the Qt4 versions of the libraries!
I think you mixup Qt4 and Qt5 versions of libs...

FYI, on Debian I start ccmake .. with the following:

# master
ccmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/richard/apps/qgis/master/debug
-DWITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR=ON -DWITH_SERVER=TRUE -DBUILD_TESTING=FALSE ..

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Maybe you did a
sudo make
or
sudo make install
so those logfiles are root owned?

Hi Vincent,

There has been some (a lot of) discussion indeed already :-)

But the main idea of using git was to have lively updated
style/symbol/data repositories: by keeping users repo's as
personal/named style repo's they would get credit for their work. They
could 'just' do this by starting a repo on Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab. So
somebody could clone a repo, add one individual icon to it, and maybe
one updated style and do a pull request.
Using git then we would have an 'easy' way to update the users local
repo's with only those files that were updated.
If I'm correct we would not need a git install, there is also a native
python-git version which could be used as module.

But thinking about this more, your options is also valid: another
strategy would be split up the work in:
-1- serving static files (with a version number in the metadata?) to
serve out the stuff on a http server
-2- have the files in git repo's for the administration of it: add stuff
via pr's etc...

Off course a lot of possible solutions are ok :-(

Regards,

Richard

Hi,
I tend to think that git / github workflow could be too high technician for
most users that have not developer's culture. This is how I see it for
processing script sharing today.. but processing is mostly concerning devs
when styling is a lot wider.
Why not combine both? Gist or equivalent for static files and git for the
main repo where or and collaborative work is required?
Cheers Regis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fwd: [Qgis-user] QGIS problem with GeoPackage
	database views
Message-ID: <724D6F4F-7412-4EEA-A8BC-DC25F740AC15@gmail.com>

@Richard: thanks for redirecting this question in to the correct people…and apologises for the size of the file…lack of specification on my part to a over enthusiastic team member ;-). I’ll reduce the size and put in a issue report.

I’m in total agreement with you on the tremendous potential of GeoPackage to support the sharing of all types of data (statistical, geospatial, metadata, imagery…). Certainly the statistical community (the UNGGIM), is grappling with the issue of integrating statistical and geospatial data models and I think GeoPackage can provide one important part of the solution.

As well as a useful container for publishing 2016 Census data...One of my aspiration is to use GeoPackage to publish the full data model that the ABS uses to internally store our geographic classification with the aim of providing a point of truth for all users.

But to do both of these things well, views are very valuable and would prevent a lot of data duplication. 

@Even Thanks for the quick reply…and all your important support for GDAL.

One of my team (more knowledgable than I) thought that it was an ID issue and both ESRI and Pitney Bowes seem to use a pseudo PKID to get around this issue (Pitney Bowes uses a specific field name MI_IDX)…so it good to have that confirmed. But it doesn’t look like there is a straight forward solution. Happy help going forward. We have scheduled September for development and testing, but I sure we can find some time before then.

It interesting that, despite the lack of PKID, both the classification and symbolisation for a choropleth maps and the Identify Features Tool work as expected….thoughts?

cheers,

Marcus Blake

Hi Sandro

Click-click mode in the context of the node tool means that you click on 
a node to move and you release it with a second click (as opposed to 
dragging nodes).
The implementation of the c.-c. mode had issues and therefore was 
changed back to drag mode.

Just reverting this commit is not a good fix, as it also changes the 
behaviour of the node tool. Instead you should debug why things go wrong 
during snapping.

Regards,
Marco

The designed architecture of the resource sharing system is protocol
independent: handlers for different repository protocols can be easily
added.

The idea is to have at least:
- filesystem (symbol repository is on filesystem, for example a network
share), this is the simplest case: a copy command is all we need to fetch
resources and update them
- git

So, git is just one of the possible handlers for remote repositories and
the idea is that the average user will never know that git is used under
the hood, it should be completely transparent.

If the general design will be respected during the implementation, it will
be really easy to expand the system to handle different remotes and
different shared resources.

The idea comes from the flexibility of python pip: it can fetch and install
resources (python packages in this case) from many different URIs, git
included.

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Redmine -> Github tests
Message-ID: <b01a2e26-0f49-ffde-d72a-274539964ada@duif.net>

Hi Lists (cross posting to have both community, psc and developers),

Still busy ways to migrate from Redmine to Github possibilities, we play
with some options. Wanted to sent some ideas to the lists of current status:

Chatting to Matthias (who did a first import script based on Redmine
issue.xml imports [0][1]).

Chatting to Juergen (who did an import script based on table exports of
the Redmine database [2]).

Who both hit the Github-api-throtteling limit from Github [3] and
stopped there:
- max 60 api-search queries per minute
- max 5000 requests per hour for other api calls

We had a little chat to github support, we were pointed to a different
api [4]

Receiving python script from Juergen, and his plan to get as much
information from Redmine as possible by:
- creating a (sqlite) redmine.db with dumps of nessecary tables from
(mysql) redmine.db
- creating 'lookup'-tables for different mappings, eg map Redmine-users
toGithub-users. Have the Category-strings mapped to their id's AND
mapped to Github-labels etc etc.
- write a python script which queries the db and (via github api)
creates issues with exact the same issue-numbers as we have in Redmine
- add labels to a Github test repo as 'mapping to Redmine' things like:
status, prio, etc etc

My conclusion: if I/we invest enough time into this, I can do further
scripting and just import the issues in blocks, just enough to not hit
the limit.

I hand crafted 2 issues:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/temp/issues/17

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/temp/issues/18

based on http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10755

To show/see some possible options:

- one Redmine comment = one Github comment (as in #17)
- all Redmine comments in one Github comment (as in #18)

You can see all possible labels if you try to create a new issue in the
repo:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/temp/issues

I tried to minimize the number of Labels, but tried to mimic most of
Redmine's.
By adding a number in front of it I hope we can instruct issuers to add
for example at least number 1 to 5 labels. And they are ordered by that
number in the Github views, making it maybe easier to 'read' them in an
apparent order.

All imports will be done by a 'QGIS-redmine-import' user.
All attributions will be done based on (Redmine) Name and (if available)
Github userid (I thin we should leave email addresses away)
References to commits and pr's can be mapped.
Assignee's can be set on Github userid's
Attachment info can be copied (url's to original attachment) BUT(!) the
api does not provide a way to add those. This can only be done via
Webinterface...

The plan is to take a couple of complex issues and fine-tune a script
till everybody is satisfied with result.

To do this work I need:

1) full backup of community that this is the way to go
2) help / feedback on first tests or coding
3) some time/days? (after 2.16 packaging: 8th july?) to freeze Redmine
and dump tables again
4) some encouragement

Already done: taking the 4079 users of Redmine, and checked with Github
if they have a user with the same email OR userid... Only 321 matched...

So also needed (separate threads/emails?):
- everybody check this list and see if he/she can match him/herself and
sent me his/her right Github id together with the Redmine one
- input/comments about current Labels
- if we miss something if we do it like this


Not sure how to channel this, but thought to sent it like an email

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

HI,

Yes, I am trying to explore Dulwich now (which is a pure Python
implementation of GIT). There is no need to add git dependency added to
QGIS or that user needs to have git in their computer (if Dulwich works
nicely).

And as Ale said, we would like to have 2 designs implemented here:

   - Repository handler. This should be independent to the protocol of the
   repository. In the case of filesystem, it would be just to copy the
   repository to the plugin working directory and extract the collections
   inside. I made handlers classes quite general and will be refactoring time
   to time if it's needed (now I am still working on git protocol though).
   - Resources handler. This part of the system should handle how the
   resources in the collection being imported into QGIS.

The focus on this GSoC phase is to fetch and import the collections (not
the sharing part). With this goal, it would be easier for users if we
implement in a way that they don't need to make a list of the resources in
the collections. That's why I am still looking for a solution other than
listing all the resources and fetch them one by one using HTTP request to
the git host.

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Number of arguments for processing

I'm sorry to keep asking about this. I'm now getting this error on Travis,
against nightly (http://qgis.org/debian-nightly):

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/travis/build/tomchadwin/qgis2web/olwriter.py", line 58, in
writeOL
    optimize, usedFields, json)
  File "/home/travis/build/tomchadwin/qgis2web/utils.py", line 293, in
exportLayers
    processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject", warpArgs)
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/tools/general.py", line
75, in runalg
    alg = Processing.runAlgorithm(algOrName, None, *args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/core/Processing.py", line
304, in runAlgorithm
    ret = runalg(alg, progress)
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/gui/AlgorithmExecutor.py",
line 52, in runalg
    progress.error(e.msg)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'error'

It's called as follows:

warpArgs = {
    "INPUT": piped_file,
    "SOURCE_SRS": layer.crs().authid(),
    "DEST_SRS": "EPSG:3857",
    "NO_DATA": "",
    "TR": 0,
    "METHOD": 0,
    "RAST_EXT": extentRepNew,
    "RTYPE": 0,
    "COMPRESS": 4,
    "JPEGCOMPRESSION": 75,
    "ZLEVEL": 6,
    "PREDICTOR": 1,
    "TILED": False,
    "BIGTIFF": 0,
    "TFW": False,
    "EXTRA": "",
    "OUTPUT": piped_3857
}
processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject", warpArgs)

I've settled on that selection of arguments for warpreproject because when I
change it to a different selection (one that works in a different QGIS
version), that's the list of expected args which comes back in the error.

So, I think that is the "correct" list of arguments, but I can't work out
what the error is telling me.

Can anyone help?

Here is an example of a map with code generated svg images as symbols.
The quick and dirty script does:

- aggregate all features from input point layer with same geometry
- calculate min/max times and values for whole set
- create svg files for every feature with filename based on id
- create a layer in qgis

Manually i added the data defined filename based on the id:

'/tmp/img_measure_' || "imgid" || '.svg'

Et voila!

Thank you all for your suggestions!

Do you see something abnormal in the backtrace?

This is not my usual PC, so I'm not sure if it is a problem of my system.

I'm on a lubuntu 14.04.

Thanks!

It seems that the progress indicator is None. I guess you should be
passing one, or at least a SilentProgress

Thanks for the feedback. I think I'm closer to the problem being
a confusion between features having the same FID but being in
different layers.

I finally have a fix, as usual looking for an automated test...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] FOSS4G code sprint idea: improving SLD export and
	GeoServer compatibility
Message-ID: <CA+nxMTsA_vaP-MQP0TOwnf7LYYihuFPpqnzjEbmr4SG-ZEr8gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
at FOSS4G Bonn we'll have a bunch of QGis and GeoServer developers
participating at the code sprint, I would like to leverage the co-precence
and propose a "cross-project"
work idea, that is, to improve the chance that a style exported from QGis
can be
successfully imported and rendered in GeoServer.

On one side, I have had reports from GeoServer users showing documents that
were not valid XML (un-balanced tags)
or not schema compliant, like CSSProperty values containing a Filter
instead of an Expression... I don't know
if these issues are still present in the latest version of QGis, as you
imagine users tend to use a large variety of software versions,
some of which pretty old, but I see some open ticket in the QGis tracker
regarding the SLD export, so there might
be some work to do there.

On the other side, GeoServer has a preference for SLD 1.0, and SE 1.1
support definitely needs improvement,
at the same time and it could learn to use some of the QGis own extensions.
For example, the other day I've seen on stackexchange a export with a
"diamond" WellKnownName that is not part
of SE, but which would be trivial to add support for in GeoServer.

There are also other functionalities, like compositing, that are present in
both projects, but not in SE, having a way to export
them would also be good.

So I'd like to see if there is any QGis developer that would like to work
side by side
with me to bring the two projects a little bit closer in this respect.
I'll be at the code sprint after the conference, Saturday and Sunday.
Having someone contributing projects with some complex symbology to test
against would
also be a great way to keep the exercise interesting.

Anyone interested? :-)

Cheers
Andrea

Can I pass it as an extra item in the warpArgs dict?

from processing.core.SilentProgress import SilentProgress

progress = SilentProgress()
warpArgs = {

  "PROGRESS": progress

}

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgQ4jhXWdQVNwpMx6B_uB5RNHF7KvJS1PcUNF=5NT7Ccg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just wanted to test the new GRASS plugin and noticed that the vector data
in our Alaska sample cannot be opened and there is a note saying "topology
version 6" right next to the layer name in browser.

Is there a workaround? Can we update the QGIS sample data?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hei Anita,

The GRASS 7 plugin has the qgis.v.upgrade module for that purpose!

For recent GRASS sample data see:
https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/

For updating a grassdatabase from GRASS 6 to GRASS 7 see:
https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Convert_all_GRASS_6_vector_maps_to_GRASS_7

Probably also Luigi and others working on Geoserver-plugin will be
interested.

Though not a cpp dev, I'll do what I can, OR try to find people who can
help from our community...

Hi Richard and Andrea, I'm really interested, but unfortunately (or
fortunately... a new baby arriving) I'll not be present in Bonn, but
I'm interested to give support remotely :)

Hi, 

I am forwarding this interesting symbology / labeling problem to the
dev-list, perhaps someone has an idea with the existing symbology
options / geometry generators / expressions / some Python magic. 

See also
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2016-June/036842.html  

What I am personally also interested in, is getting access to the index
nr of a marker. If every marker knew  - I am the first, second, third,
etc. marker, we could use it in expressions and add dynamic marker
content and change properties based on the marker index. 

Or, we could have per feature counters/iterators that either allow to
calculate n marker or label positions on the fly. 

Something to consider for QGIS 3.0 ;-) 

Andreas

I want to label vectors (roads) with proposed addresses:

21  23  25  27  29
==================
  22  24  26  28

I suppose I will use the Qchainage plugin and then post-process the
output with a simple perl script to get the exact labels I want (20, 30,
40...).

I don't suppose I can make them on either side of the road so I suppose
I will have to put them along the centerline.

There are no houses here. Just guide points for government workers if
houses were ever to be built.

I can't use StackExchange to ask this because I don't have enough Karma
and never will.

I would be very interested but unfortunately I will not be in Bonn, I've
done some experiments a few months ago and I've used this small testing
utility, perhaps it cold be useful for your code sprint:

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-rendering-tests

it currently only test sldadapter.py from GeoServer Explorer QGIS plugin
but it could be expanded to test other conversion routines.

Have fun :)

Do you mean within a multipoint? or across all features?

Hi Nyall, 

For marker lines, with regularly spaced markers at a given interval, I'd
like to have an index number - 1 to n for each feature. 

Or - for multi-geometries, it would also be useful to have the index
number - the index nr of the nth ring or nth line in a multilinestring. 

I think, such an index/counter it should be per feature and not global. 

For linestring labeling it would also be interested to regularly place
labels, with a counter/iterator and place the labels perpendicular to
the tangent. 

We could collect some use cases for such indexes to get this into QGIS
3.x, if possible.

Ahh - I missed the marker line part. It's actually pretty trivial to
add as a new expression variable. Multi* geometries have
@geometry_part_num, so it'd be something pretty similar
(@marker_line_index?)

Hello,

Like Richard I am not a developper but this is something I am interesting on. 
I already made some test in the past with SLD export (MapServer, GeoServer and 
QGIS).

And like Victor, I will be at the hackfest before the conference.

Hi Yves and Victor,
I'll get in Bonn Sunday, probably late, and I'm packed with workshops
Monday all day and Tuesday afternoon, but I should have some time to show
up on Tuesday morning... let's try to make the most out of it, and then I
guess
I'll move along Sat/Sun with Luigi.

Cheers
Andrea

Yeah @marker_line_index would work fine, or just @marker_index. 

Would it be possible to do data-defined overrides of certain marker
properties of individual markers, based on this @marker_line_index? Say
each odd index would have different offset as each even index - or
change color or font-marker content based on this index?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Shape repack issue
Message-ID: <207f6b983983cea507a341b8008538ea@carto.net>

Hi, 

There is (hopefully was) this annoying ESRI Shape Repack issue - see
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11007 

I see that this bug was re-opened - Antoine SIG claims that it worked in
2.14.1 and 2.14.2 (Windows) but fails again in 2.14.3. Can someone
confirm? How can that happen? Can a test be added to ensure this doesn't
fail again? 

How about 2.16? Does it work there if it is built with GDAL 2.x? 

I can't reproduce, since I don't have another GIS besides QGIS to check.


Thanks, 

Andreas

Andreas,

I cannot confirm. But the bug has been reopened without specifying the 
operating system, the GDAL version and the exact procedure followed (possibly 
with the dataset in case it might make a difference), so it might hit some 
particular case.

So here's my setup :
- versions tried : up-to-date versions of QGIS master and 2.14 branch
- OS: Linux
- GDAL >= 2.1

Steps :
1) Download:
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/poly.shp
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/poly.shx
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/poly.dbf

2) Open the shapefile in QGIS

3) Turn on edition mode

4) Select the feature with EAS_ID = 165 (the one roughly at the middle)

5) Delete it

6) Turn off edition mode and confirm saving the changes

7) Quit QGIS and do "ogrinfo -al poly.shp". You'll see "Feature Count: 9" and 
9 features numeroted without hole from OGRFeature(poly):0 to 
OGRFeature(poly):8


Sure, a test could be added to simulate that (looking at 
test_provider_shapefile.py it doesn't seem there's one), but there's probably 
something we miss here w.r.t. the reporter setup.


On the reverse, to see the effect of *no* repacking, if you do :

http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/poly.shx
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/poly.dbf

2) ogrinfo poly.shp -sql "delete from poly where eas_id = 165" -dialect sqlite

3) ogrinfo -al poly.shp. You'll see "Feature Count: 10" and features numbered 
from  OGRFeature(poly):0 to OGRFeature(poly):9 with a hole (OGRFeature(poly):8 
missing) --> the shapefile hasn't been repacked (as "expected" from current OGR 
behaviour)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] setting QgsMapCanvas size, for testing map tools
Message-ID: <20160629143757.GB11793@localhost>

I'm writing a testcase for bug 13952 [1] and would need a
way to set the map canvas size so to be able to syntetize
clicks on pixels with predictable contents. How can it be
done ?

Beside, I've found an QgsMapCanvas::updateMapSize() method
which is declared in the header but never defined (git blame
says it's yours, Nathan).

I'm thinking there could be enough similar testcases to
justify a service class to simplify writing them. What
do you think ?

Hi Sandro,

I once was asked to define a mapcanvas with a certain size, and tried it
in python, see:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/simplesvg/blob/master/src/simplesvg/mapsizer/MapSizerDialog.py#L93

the hard part (I think) is that the exact size of the mapcanvas was
defined relative to other (parent) widgets, and for example depending on
the OS....

would be cool though to be able to just SET it, given that is the most
important widget in QGIS...

Regards,

Richard

Hi Even, 

Thank you for your thorough review of the situation and the explanation.


I asked the person who reopened this bug to provide more details - which
we hopefully get. Otherwise, I suggest we close this issue again.

I just figured my test canvas has no parent, but still ->resize()
doesn't make ->scale() return what I would expect...

I'm not sure if this is done in any other testcase, but I'm trying
to emulate user interaction, like:

 1. Select a layer in the registry
 2. Put layer in edit mode
 3. Activate node tool
 4. Click on a pixel coordinate

Do you know of an example test I should look at, if any ?

Should I fill a ticket?

Hi,
Yes, Tom, you're right. Sounds impossible to figure out what could be the
expected polygon or line.
However, could be nice to have polygon-to-point and line-to-point available
through a simple copy-paste.

I opened a PR: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15178

Thanks,

Hi all,

I just noticed that "Save as" for raster allows me to save rasters only
as GTiff and VRT. If I'm not wrong some time ago it was possible to
save rasters in any GDAL-supported format. What is the reason for
limiting this to GTiff now?

I am using Qt Designer to add a QgsColorButtonV2 to the ui of a QGIS
plugin. I am using uic.loadUiType to load my .ui file. Specifically here is
the line of code:

FORM_CLASS, _ = uic.loadUiType(os.path.join(

When I load the plugin in QGIS I get the error:

It appears that uic.loadUiType is the problem. How do I solve this?

Yeah, I feel your pain. It's a frustrating situation indeed.
We'd need an helper class for testcases, to make things like
setting the canvas size easy, and to simulate user events
like mouse moves and clicks, tools selection and the like.

Maybe I've missed something here, but doesn't the canvas resize method
set the canvas pixel size? This behaves as expected when run
standalone from a python prompt.

from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
app = QgsApplication([],True)
canvas = QgsMapCanvas()
canvas.show()
canvas.resize(1000,200)
canvas.resize(1000,1000)

Note the map canvas has no parent, so just appears on its own at the
specified size.

Or maybe I've missed a point....
