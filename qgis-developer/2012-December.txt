Hi all.
Thanks Victor for raising up this. I fully agree with Alex: the most important thing
is to get rid of the too many bugs, and have a more predictable release cycle, so
users can be confident of using a stable yet updated version. For this, having a full
test suite, that promptly warns us of broken modules, is crucial: currently we are
stretching a few passionate users patience, with somewhat unpredictable bugs
surfacing now and then (this is not a criticism: Victor, you're doing an admiarble
job of fixing them promptly whenever possible).
The help page should be available for all backends.
I also agree that we should start replacing native menus with sextante ones. Feasible
with fTools, we have to think about GRASS plugin, that cannot be replaced now, as it
has many more functions than just analyses; we should reduce duplication anyway.
New algorithms come much later in my priorities.
As for th i18 support, I understand Martin changes should help a lot?
We'll probably have time for more formal testing very soon, so let's coordinating for
best results.
All the best.

If you find something like that - just change it in the source code or
inform (me?) where to find that ..
I'll take care of it when i have some spare time

Can you specify better how slow it is, if it is constant or what it
depends on? For me it takes to render one layer full screen 1-2s and
it seems to be constant.

Each draw runs external executable which reads GRASS data and QGIS
reads the data from its stdout. That is the right way GRASSers
recommend/allow. It adds some overhead for starting the executable, I
am no sure how fast is passing data via stdout.

It could be probably improved using the same like identify is using,
i.e. keep the GRASS module running and send data requests to its
stdin.

It seems to be related to colours: grey scale rasters are much faster, especially in
zooming in.

GRASS raster layer with defined colors is loaded as single band
pseudocolor, right? How many colors do you have? What happens if you
reduce the number of colors?

that would be nice.

the ideal is to have both options.

even better would be to have the "add ring" tool in the digitizing
toolbox to allow immediately fill the carved hole with a new polygon
and ask for attributes or get the attributes from the surrounding
polygon.

cannot see much difference, but no formal benchmarking has been run. slowing is
particularly evident when zooming in.

Not that I know of - but in that case I would just make my own
guidelines for consistancy ..

HTML was HTML for me ever .. :) for example

I also noticed some Null Null NULL and NODATA NoData and nodata things
.. I'd rather write that all uppercase ..

This was added here [0], but only for layers that have unsaved edits.
Also, a red pencil legend layer icon was added to indicate when a
layer has unsaved edits. Let me know if you have any comments on or
suggestions for their implementation.

The 'Save All Edits' functionality will be added to the project close
notification, when layers are found to have unsaved edits (currently
just shows some red text that can be overlooked).

Hi all.
Is anybody working (or planning to) on a WPS server implementation for QGIS? Does
anybody have an estimate of how much work would be involved?
Ideally, it would be good to build it on top of sextante, so to have the full set of
algorithms and models immediately available.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

I'm starting some WPS implementation based on QgsExpression, and it's
working.

I'll publish my first code.

Any plan to expand it to use more functions? As said, using sextante would be the
real killer here.

Hi Paolo,

TauDEM provider now included in SEXTANTE core, so you can remove
separate plugin.

Regarding error, I'm not sure that it caused by this plugin. But I'll
at it ASAP.

Do we have a collection of spellings somewhere? It would be good for 
dev's to have a place to refer to.
E.g. a simple wiki page.

Hi Larry,

this is even better than what I had in mind! I like the red pencil 
indicating the dirty status of the layer. Many thanks for that. However 
I would change the tooltip to "Save edits in all layers" because as it 
is now we have "Save all edits" vs. "Save edits" which might puzzle 
users: Does the latter one not save all edits?

Hi Paolo,
Hi Luca,
Hi all,

I'll explain my idea about QGIS-Server and WPS implementation.

For the next QGIS release, 3Liz has decided to improve QGIS-Server WFS 
implementation. The main improvement is to cover the maximum of the 
1.0.0 standard, especially Transaction. For Transaction and GetFeature 
Request, I needed to extend the QGIS Expressions directly in the QGIS 
core. I added some spatial operators like Intersects, Contains, Disjoint 
but I also added spatial constructor like geomFromWKT, Intersection, 
buffer. The last point means that it's possible to construct a buffer 
with the QGIS Expression system.
I also discovered that in the Filter Encoding OGC  standard, it's 
possible to use Functions and the QGIS Expression system provides a 
reader for this way of describing expressions.
And Nathan Woordrow publishing 'User defined expression functions for 
QGIS' on his blog 
http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/user-defined-expression-functions-for-qgis/ 
. This point explaining how the new QGIS Expression system is 
extendable. And for me it was the start for testing a WPS 
implementation, because I needed WPS for validating geometry for the WFS 
Transaction Request.

I've worked on a WPS project which provides a way to create Process in a 
wide range of programming langage, the ZOO-Project. I've worked on the 
JavaScript Provider. In this project, you have to code to create new 
process.

With the QGIS Expression you just have to know how to write an 
expression to create a new Process. It's not coding.
For example the Buffer Process can be described like this :
buffer("geometry","distance")
You want to create a Process which retrun the buffer without the geometry :
difference(buffer("geometry","distance"),"geometry")
And we can define a Process which return the result of a QGIS Expression 
as the Process parameter.

My plan for WPS implementation is firstly to find fund, to :
* implement the standard (defining how to declare process, how to use 
the posting XML for Excute Request, how to use QGIS layer from project, etc)
* loading Python scripts for 'User defined expression functions'
* Using Sextante

Sextante is not my priority because it is more complexe, the QGIS-Server 
doesn't load python and python plugins, and we firstly need to provide a 
way to have simple Process and simple way to describe Process, after 
that it will be easy to use SEXTANTE.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Yes, I see the ambiguity now. Thanks for the feedback!

I swapped out the text and tips with "Save Edits for All Layers":
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/c85b952d1aa2834f9cc336c54e6443007e045dec

Another convenience set of actions would be "Revert Edits" and "Revert
Edits for All Layers" (or possibly "Rollback" ?). Currently a user has
to turn off editing to get the option to not save the edits (e.g.
revert or rollback), but then has to turn it right back on to start
over. I find a use for "Revert Edits for All Layers" when I am editing
a bunch of labels or features across multiple layers, but don't like
the results, and want to quickly start over without reopening the
project or toggling editing for every layer (which also means
dismissing every dialog then toggling it back on).

If adding the revert functions, it might be best to consolidate the
save and revert functions into one toolbar button with a popup menu.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Larry,

+1 for the "revert edits" button

One thought about the "save/revert all" buttons: they can damage the 
user's data. Because the undo history is gone then. With these buttons 
all changes are committed and there is no confirmation asked from the user.
How if a list of the layers in question pops up in which the user has to 
tick all layers that he really wants to save/revert. There would be a 
"tick all layers" button, so this would be only one more click but the 
user would be more aware of what he is about to do.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Startup error after successfully building QGIS
Message-ID: <CACoSEgfE8F_V=OQ8NyEGMJGnxkSQOE67vgJTiU1Vttcp-qna5A@mail.gmail.com>

After successfully building QGIS 1.8 "Lisboa" on Windows 7 in 32 bit mode
by following the instructions mentioned
here<http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc14> I
am able to start QGIS, however I get the following startup error message:

Couldn't load PyQt4. Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in ImportError: DLL
load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

Python version: 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 15:08:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit
(Intel)]

QGIS version: 1.8.0-Lisboa 'Lisboa', exported

After this message the Python console and other python related plugins are
not loaded.

I have installed the latest PyQt installer of PyQt4.9.5 from
riverbanks<http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download>

My system details

OS: windows 7 64 bit

Build tools:

   1. MS Visual Studio 2010
   2. C-Make 2.8.8
   3. Python2.7
   4. PyQt4.9.5 with SIP
   5. OSGeo4W with GRASS and all dependency libs

further investigation lead me to believe that there might be a mismatch of
PyQt 4.9.5 that I installed and the one downloaded by OSGeo4W (PyQt4.8).
However, I do not know how to make the cmake look for pyQt4.9.5 instead of
PyQt4.8

I would highly appreciate any pointers and detailed help in solving this
issue.

With regards

Sukesh

My personal priority list:
1. Reanimate Python code export
2. Support for database tables as input and output types
This would be the starting point for implementing import and export workflows 
with SEXTANTE.
3. Support for spatialite as an intermediate format
No more troubles with long layer names!
4. PostGIS algorithm collection
5. Merging history/log window with QGIS protocol windows

Dear all, 

I found that newest EPSG DB is not still reflected in QGIS SRS DB. 

Would you please update QGIS SRS DB to newest one?

This is especially essential for Korean QGIS users, who had to update new Korean SRS manually. 

Should I issue a ticket for this?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts about your implementation.

I would like to express my concerns that using QgsExpression may be a dead
end for a generic WPS servers. Expressions are meant to deal with
individual features of a vector layer. You're right that it's possible to
define your own functions and chain them to create processes, but this is
very limited. For example it's not possible for a process to return more
results and it's not possible to use one result more than once. Just like
raster calculator has its own expression engine, also the processing
service should use a way of describing algorithms that suits best its needs
- and in our case that's python+SEXTANTE.

Therefore I strongly recommend using SEXTANTE for the WPS server backend. I
believe that would be less work than trying to hack QgsExpression to use it
for processing. You would just need to parse WPS query, generate a Python
script that would run SEXTANTE analysis and then create WPS reply. It's
probably not desirable to run the processing directly within the server
process (thread), so this would be a better solution either way.

Regards
Martin

Hi Martin,

My idea was to have a simple WPS server based on QGIS-Server, very 
simple for simple vector case, and I thought it's a good idea. I only 
need to validate geometry, constructing simple buffer or intersection.

For big processing, I think SEXTANTE is better suitable, but for a WPS 
serveur, SEXTANTE didn't need QGIS. We can construct a WPS Server based 
on pySextante with pyWPS.

I don't really want to hack QgsExpression, just accesses to very simple 
processing, I'll just it. For SEXTANTE, It will be better to work on 
someting based on pyWPS.

Ren?-Luc

I don't think PyWPS would be a good choice for WPS server implementation.
>From a broader view, PyWPS does the same thing as SEXTANTE does: it allows
users to run processes and it allows developers to provide custom
processes. The main difference is that PyWPS processing is meant to be
triggered by WPS requests, while SEXTANTE processing may be triggered by
anything (currently mainly GUI). On the backend side, PyWPS supports GRASS,
while SEXTANTE offers much more by default. It's true that one could attach
SEXTANTE to PyWPS and let QGIS server call PyWPS all the time, but that
would bring just additional limitations.

In fact, the server-side WPS support could be implemented directly within
SEXTANTE, the only thing that would QGIS server do would be to pass WPS
request to SEXTANTE routine and send its response back to server.

So the bottom line from my point of view:
SEXTANTE +1
QgsExpression -1
PyWPS -1

Hi Victor, hi all,

> Let's start with the second point.... How do you think we should spend
> this money on SEXTANTE?

At Oslandia our priorities for Sextante are :
* PostGIS and spatialite support for sextante, as intermediary layers and 
parameterized queries as processes, with import/export processes too.
* add a bunch of postgis/spatialite classical processes (nearest neigbours, 
deduplication, spatial join, shortest path...)
* Making sextante totally independant of qgis GUI, to be able to run sextante 
processes in batch in command line mode

This will open the door to use Sextante as a real WPS processes generator, 
with features not unlike an ETL (or ELT).

We will try to spend some internally funded R&D time on the PostGIS support, 
probably early 2013.
Apart from the R&D time we'll spend, we'll have resources for paid work if 
these topics are of interest, or on related topics with sextante.

But meanwhile, the most important is probably what everybody underlined : 
consolidation. Bugfixing, qgis integration (in menus), documentation should be 
the top priorities.

That's all for my christmas list :)

I'm setting the URI of a PostGIS view layer in the following way:

but the resulting layer has something wrong, eg layer.isValid() returns
False, and I can't load it.
I can load the same view through the GUI, settings the Primary Key Column

What's wrong with the way I'm using setDataSource?

Hi,


Yesterday I reported that problem with /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/admintools/httplib2/__init__.py in dev mailinglist: 

http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Couldn-t-load-plugin-ogrprocessing-after-upgrading-Sextante-from-github-td5020192.html 


but the problem in starting QGIS is different and it just showed up today here, after upgrading to version 1.9.0+git20121201+80fa7aa~precise-ubuntugis1.

The error:

Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named qgis.core

Python version:
2.7.3 (default, Aug? 1 2012, 05:27:35) 
[GCC 4.6.3]

QGIS version:
1.9.0-Master 'Master', exported

Python path:
['/usr/share/qgis/python', '/home/pedro/.qgis//python', '/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins', '/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins', '/usr/lib/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gst-0.10', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0', '/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntu-sso-client', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode']



Will be a problem with some dependency?

Thanks,
Pedro

Ok I solved the problem..
During the updating thw first line of the file __init__.py (stored in /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/admintools/httplib2) "from __future__ import generators" moved to the 26th line of the same file. I really don't understand why, but after moving it back to the right place, it seems that python (and the plugins) works correctly. 

Cheers

I don't know really well PyWPS, but I think that you can use more that
GRASS for sure at least R.
Other WPS Server as ZOO or 52north and maybe also GeoServer permit to
the user to create services with a lot of libraries, I'm using ZOO and
I can use much more than Sextante ;-)

Hi Larry,

Would it be possible to tell us when you release a Mac OS X nightly
build that includes this update Spatialite provider (i.e. SPL 4.0.0).

Thanks.

Where can the osgeo4w files be downloaded for offline install, without using the

so I cannot use the exe (and wine is not working on amd64).

Hi Victor, hi all,

I think the first point is to fixed bugs, the second like Vincent 
Picavet is Making sextante totally independant of qgis GUI, to be able 
to run sextante
processes in batch in command line mode.

We, at 3Liz, could spend some time on SEXTANTE and find fund to improve 
SEXTANTE. Some of our clients, mainly labs, can be insteresting in 
improving SEXTANTE in QGIS, SEXTANTE has a command line or SEXTANTE as a 
WPS Server.

Hi Martin,

I think we need both :
* QgsExpression for simple Process on Geometry and simple parameters
* SEXTANTE for complexe Process on Raster, Vector Layer, multiple Layer, etc

After some tests on WFS-Transaction, I need a way to validate my 
geometry before updating or adding feature. In this case SEXTANTE will 
be too big, QgsExpression is exactly what I need no more no less. I do 
not need to Process layer.

For SEXTANTE, Vincent Picavet give the good solution :
/* Making sextante totally independant of qgis GUI, to be able to run 
sextante processes in batch in command line mode//
//This will open the door to use Sextante as a real WPS processes 
generator, //
//with features not unlike an ETL (or ELT)./

The nightly builds I have setup for Mac try to adhere to the same
requirements as a Kyngchaos.com stable install (so most users can
basically just download the nightly app and try it out). Notable
exception is support for Globe plugin (forthcoming). William's
spatialite libraries/headers are embedded in the
/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework install, and are not bundled
with the app, i.e. wouldn't be included in the nightly app, just
linked to local components.

This means if I do something custom for v. 4.0, users would also have
to compile and install spatialite themselves, too. I would prefer to
wait until William gives us an update on when he might be rolling a
new framework. If he won't be able to do that for a while, I will look
into a CMake setup, whereby a custom spatialite install is bundled
with the app (a la libfcgi, libspatialindex and libpq). That should
probably be done anyway.

Looks like William's current SQLite3.framework version is 3.7.14.1, so
that should handle the requirements for spatialite 4.0. Not sure if he
includes FreeXL though, to import data from Microsoft Excel format
(.xls suffix) files.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,


Yesterday I reported that problem with /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/admintools/httplib2/__init__.py in dev mailinglist: 

http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Couldn-t-load-plugin-ogrprocessing-after-upgrading-Sextante-from-github-td5020192.html 


but the problem in starting QGIS is different and it just showed up today here, after upgrading to version 1.9.0+git20121201+80fa7aa~precise-ubuntugis1.

The error:

Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named qgis.core

Python version:
2.7.3 (default, Aug? 1 2012, 05:27:35) 
[GCC 4.6.3]

QGIS version:
1.9.0-Master 'Master', exported

Python path:
['/usr/share/qgis/python', '/home/pedro/.qgis//python', '/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins', '/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins', '/usr/lib/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gst-0.10', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0', '/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntu-sso-client', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode']



Will be a problem with some dependency?

Thanks,
Pedro

From: Matteo Ghetta 

Ok I solved the problem..
During the updating thw first line of the file __init__.py (stored in /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/admintools/httplib2) "from __future__ import generators" moved to the 26th line of the same file. I really don't understand why, but after moving it back to the right place, it seems that python (and the plugins) works correctly. 

Cheers

Hi Guys,

 

In case you are interested, we've just released a plugin for viewing
time-varying results from FE/FV models (it does flood models but could do
others too) directly in QGIS which is based on QgsPluginLayer.

Hi all

This mail is to tell you about the great work ESA is doing with
SEXTANTE, They have contributed several important patches (thanks to
Radoslaw Guzinski for his fantastic work!) and they use it for some of
their projects, as it can be seen in this newsletter they recently
published[1]. I think this is a very good case study, and as such it
is of interest for the QGIS community.

It seems that SEXTANTE is growing up, which will for sure be good for
all of us and will help us have a robust and table version pretty
soon. Thanks to everyone for you collaboration!!

Great. Maybe they could send us a very short report for our case studies?

Hi all

Thanks a lot for your ideas, there are definitely very good ones in here.

I am going to try to put a detailed list of priorities and maybe some
time estimations, so we can then focus our work more efficiently.

As some of you mentioned that you have plans to work on these
ideas,since they are of interest for you company/work/etc, (this is a
great surprise!), I would just like to ask for some communication here
in the list, so as to avoid duplicate work. For instance, support for
databases as inputs and outputs was already on my priorities list. A
good roadmap will help us divide the work and advance faster.

I cannot thank you all enough for you help. It is really exciting to
see how people are using SEXTANTE and helping us to push it forward.

Thanks!

Many people mention documentation. As I said, we are interested in
documenting how to develop with SEXTANTE, which is a great priority in
order to keep the project alive.

However, I guess most people are talking about user documentation. Do
you mean algorithm documentation? Documentation about the SEXTANTE
framework itself?

GRASS algorithms are all fully documented, since we use the original
GRASS docs. SAGA ones are not... That is clearly a huge amount of
work, probably beyond what can be achieved in the short- or mid-term,
but suggestions about this topic are welcome. Other SEXTANTE documents
not related to analysis algorithms are more comprehensive and closer
to completion...

Thanks in advance

I haven't looked at it yet.  I'll see what I can do, probably a week or so (or less), depending on how simple the update is to work into my framework.  It will require a rebuild of GDAL also.

Bundling a spatialite might be troublesome - GDAL uses sqlite and spatialite also, so if you use my GDAL framework then you'll have multiple versions of spatialite available (from the sqlite framework and yours) in the QGIS compilation which might confuse the build.

Yes, I include freexl.

William, thanks for the update! I'll just wait for you to do your
framework magic, then use the results for the nightlies.

IMHO algorithm documentation.

I think we should work together with SAGA team to extract their documentation
automatically.

All the best.

Dear List,
I am an experienced GIS User, but fairly new to GIS Development and
Programming.
My assignment is the following:
Given a Point Cloud (either a file or a stream) that represents positions,
speed and direction of a vehicle fleet (TAXIs in my case), and a graph
(geometric network) that represents roads and intersections, I want to be
able to do the following:
	1. Track down the route of any single vehicle, as a succession of
points on the network.
	2. Calculate the total passes of vehicles through any given point or
segment of the network.
	3. (Not as urgent as the above) Find the nearest TAXI to a random
point on the network.
All of the above need to be FOSS-based solutions.
Although I am willing and ready to program plugins or algorithms to do the
above tasks, I am not really into re-inventing the wheel, so my questions
are the following:
	A) Are there any libraries or plugins that handle the above tasks?
Is there any FOSS work already done with them?
	B) Is QGIS ready (aka efficient enough) to handle those tasks, or
shall we try other tools/software?
Any opinions on my task would be greatly appreciated!

Thanx in advance!

Your problem will probably be best answered through PostGIS queries, which you 
can then visualize with QGIS, and/or a custom web-based application.

Let's say you have a table taxi_position like this, where position is a point 
geometry :

| gid | taxi_id | speed | pos_time | position |

> 	1. Track down the route of any single vehicle, as a succession of
> points on the network.

Group by taxi_id, order by pos_time and make a line with the resulting points.

> 	2. Calculate the total passes of vehicles through any given point or
> segment of the network.

Join your segment (or node) network with your taxi_position table, allowing a 
tolerance around the segment/node (st_dwithin will do the trick), then group 
by taxi if you want to consider each vehicle only once.

> 	3. (Not as urgent as the above) Find the nearest TAXI to a random

With PostGIS > 2.0, use KNN-search to do it fast as light. Otherwise, use 
st_dwithin with growing values for the search radius.

That would be a few SQL queries then.

Use QGIS as visualization tool, and PostGIS as a backend, and you're set for 
hundred of millions of positions without problem (well, do not visualize 
everything at once).

You're welcome

In my plugin, I am able to create features as per the cookbook. And when I
zoom to the layer extent I can see the points are there and they are
rendered as per my symbology.

However when I try to zoom / Pan to them, they disappear.
If I run QgsFeature.isValid() they all return true. I just cannot
understand it.

Wow,
a most prompt and to-the-point response!! I have absolutely no experience with PostGIS, but it was already in my priorities list, so I will get to it and post back with results and/or comments.
I have to say I disagree with some points of your answers, but I have to do some work first, before posting a formal reply.
Thank you again for your prompt and concise reply,

Which version of QGIS are you using? Are you using code exactly as in the cookbook (Using Vector Layers chapter?)?. If not, can you provide the code? Also how did you create the symbology?

Martin, thanks for Your comments. So we have two possibilities:
1. Check features for id < 0 and add changed features by comparing
current state to data provides which can be very expensive in case of
big layers.

2. To listen to signals of all existing layers in canvas which can be
very tricky in case of removing and adding layers.

Ivan

Message-ID: <1354751676.91453.YahooMailNeo@web122304.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I found a problem to assign transparency to a vector layer, using the new symbology -> Graduated style. When I do 'Change transparency', I get a segmentation fault (core dumped).

Anyone confirm? 

To replicate, simply add a vector layer, apply a Graduated symbology with the new symbology engine; then click with the right mouse button over the classes -> Change transparency.

I tried with spatialite and shapefiles, both with the same results (segmentation fault).

I am using QGIS master (ubuntugis) on Xubuntu 12.04.


Thanks.

there's already a ticket [1], but I've fixed it right now :)

Your problem will probably be best answered through PostGIS queries, which you 
can then visualize with QGIS, and/or a custom web-based application.

Let's say you have a table taxi_position like this, where position is a point 
geometry :

| gid | taxi_id | speed | pos_time | position |

Group by taxi_id, order by pos_time and make a line with the resulting points.

Join your segment (or node) network with your taxi_position table, allowing a 
tolerance around the segment/node (st_dwithin will do the trick), then group 
by taxi if you want to consider each vehicle only once.

Use QGIS as visualization tool, and PostGIS as a backend, and you're set for 
hundred of millions of positions without problem (well, do not visualize 
everything at once).

In my plugin, I am able to create features as per the cookbook. And when I
zoom to the layer extent I can see the points are there and they are
rendered as per my symbology.

However when I try to zoom / Pan to them, they disappear.
If I run QgsFeature.isValid() they all return true. I just cannot
understand it.

Wow,
a most prompt and to-the-point response!! I have absolutely no experience with PostGIS, but it was already in my priorities list, so I will get to it and post back with results and/or comments.
I have to say I disagree with some points of your answers, but I have to do some work first, before posting a formal reply.
Thank you again for your prompt and concise reply,

Justin

Which version of QGIS are you using? Are you using code exactly as in the cookbook (Using Vector Layers chapter?)?. If not, can you provide the code? Also how did you create the symbology?

Hi

I am using QGis 1.8.
The code I am using is identical to the code in the cookbook. I have also
tried doing this in the console. Same result.
When I create a new shapefile layer and add the points as described in the
code, they appear correctly.
However with this layer - Which is a Spatialite Layer I cannot see the
points at all.

With regards to the symbology, I have tried new and old symbology, and even
loading the layer in a blank project with no custom symbology at all. Same
result.
If I use the map tool to create a point with the mouse the point appears,
and works correctly. This is causing me to think that the error is in the
code. (Perhaps Spatialite requires something extra?)

Hi,

try to open your Spatialite db and add layer without plugin. If then 
also are missing some geometries can be problems with your Spatialite 
database indexes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsRunProcess: forwarding the finished() signal?
Message-ID: <CACH1WLCO0pLux6FSpP0sissOmkv0nMnyxHgXrVWC4Qscy5kxcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I think that it would be useful if QgsRunProcess::processExit() [1]
forwards the finished() signal [2] sent by QProcess, so a plugin that runs
an external process could detect when the process exits.

Should I file an enhancement request or there's already a method to achieve
this?

Hi.

When I load the layer outside of the plugin I get the same problem.
If there is a problem with the database indexes, how would I rectify this?

Hi,

simplest way is to reindex, if that does not work delete existing and 
create a new.
See in spatialite deocumentation 
http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-tutorial-2.3.1.html#t8 and 
here 
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/spatialite-cookbook/html/rtree.html

And check if the data at all are stored in database.

Regards,

unfortunately the problem is still there, I fixed it only
partially: when I haven't got the segfault opening the
transparency (and also color) dialog I thought it was fixed.

Oh, poking around while working on the spatialite 4 build - the upcoming GDAL 1.10 has updates for spatialite 4.  This means I should wait for the GDAL 1.10 release before updating my SQLite framework for spatialite 4.  This would also make the rebuild of everything else a lot simpler for me (everything that depends on GDAL) - 1 complete rebuild later is better than 2 rebuilds in relatively quick succession.

Nothing clear yet, but I think they're aiming for the end of the year.

Welcome Chingchai  

I  have recently reinstalled qgis 1.9.0 master without any problems. Which  options did you choose in advanced install? Did you unselect the GRASS  option? I think this is needed to run the qgis-dev.bat.

Regards

Ian

If you have time for QgsLegend overhaul, please go ahead! QgsLegend
has been stuck in application source code... but it is easy to see
that developers would really appreciate its availability in GUI
library. Once in GUI library, we could get rid of the
QgsLegendInterface class that is clumsy and very limited. Right now
there are two issues why QgsLegend is not inside GUI library:
1. it has some dependencies on QgisApp (e.g. open layer properties,
open attribute table) - those dependencies should relatively easy to
solve (by adding support for custom context menu actions)
2. it is implemented as a QTreeWidget + QTreeWidgetItem. This is
should be ideally replaced by model/view approach that separates the
data and view logic.

Actually all the "outline" symbol layers are regular line symbol
layers added to a fill symbol. This is a special case supported by
fill symbols because of the convenience of using existing line symbol
layers for drawing of polygon border.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal for organizing algorithms in SEXTANTE
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yJC1Fpxcsdu1+m4Vk1QspHDX=iODXL11YF+V=oMnO3pA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have been doing some work to have an alternative organization of
algorithms in the SEXTANTE toolbox, targeted at the non-advanced
users. I can be now be enabled in the SEXTANTE configuration. When
this is active, algorithms do not appear as belonging to a provider,
but just under a common branch simply called "algorithms". All
available algorithms are classified in categories, independently of
their origin. This gives a more homogeneous interface and should make
it easier for users to select the algorithm they need.

I think this is important to make it easier and more intuitive to use
SEXTANTE and the (very) large number or algorithms it currently
contains, and it is an area that we should work on.

This homogeneous interface requires some extra work to be done:

- Defining a set of categories, based on a criteria that is agreed as
the best one (or even define several of them, according to different
criteria, such as field of application, type of data it needs, etc).
- Define categories for each algorithm, and also alternative names,
since now they do not follow a similar pattern (GRASS ones, for
instance, are too verbose). This is stored independently of the
algorithms and their names, so it can be used as a decoration, and
different naming schemes can be used, or a different classification.

Since no classification has been defined yet, now all algorithms use
their "normal" undecorated name and group name, but the functionality
is already there, and ready to

A third task will round this up, but implies clearly a larger amount of work:

- Write help files for algorithms using a common template. A single
help file written in RestructuredText, that can be turned into HTML to
display basic ideas about each algorithm, like a description of the
process or an explanation about the meaning of each input and output.
Algorithms already documented (like GRASS ones), should be easily
adapted to this in some automated way. I plan to write some kind of
script to automate the creation of the basic files for all remaining
algorithms, including parameter names, etc.

All this tasks require quite a bit of work, but it is work that can be
somehow outsourced to the community by putting into a wiki or
easy-to-edit format. For instance, a Google spreadsheet might be a
good solution for editing alternative names for algorithms or
classifying them in groups.

What is your opinion about this?

As usual, thanks in advance for your help!

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8R5b7HBWWDFm7i54s2wXSWD-TiNh8mzLJCLy2grWWPLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

With recent commit:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/4dc84995ee4dec8fe4b927a650b900e7edddaad4

Build of FAKE_LIB_GRASS_GIS fails on Mac OS X with:
Linking CXX shared module ../../../PlugIns/qgis/libgrass_gis.6.4.2.so
clang: error: invalid argument '-compatibility_version 1.9.0' only
allowed with '-dynamiclib'
make[2]: *** [PlugIns/qgis/libgrass_gis.6.4.2.1.9.0.so] Error 1
make[1]: *** [src/providers/grass/CMakeFiles/grass_gis.6.4.2.dir/all] Error 2

In src/providers/grass/CMakeLists.txt it seems a MODULE, and not
SHARED library is generated (which I think is needed if a framework is
being built), but I do not know enough about this aspect of CMake, or
the build process, to fix it.

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,

Larry

I was wondering if that fake grass library stuff would break something on OS X...

I don't see it linked anywhere so it looks like the fake "library" is indeed a plugin type thing, and thus MODULE is correct.  That means all the Mac framework junk added to the target properties is bogus, and should be removed.

The  output should be standard shared library. I have probably copy-pasted
wrong (provider) block. I have no idea what is the difference on  OS X.

Sorry for the problems, i dont have access to source code at this moment,
could you try to change
CMakeLists.txt to  build simple shared library.

I don't know if could be useful but here [0] you can find a Python
script to obtain topics about GRASS commands and also a classification
of each modules. You can find the result here [1]

Hi

Could someone tell me if this [1] pull request will fix the bug #6638
'Cannot set custom form with python for vector layer' [2] (which I think is
a blocker btw)?
If so, when can we expect it to be merged in master?
(Alternatively, can someone guide me on how to find out if a particular
pull request is merged into master?)

kind regards
Josef

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange integer column value within SpatiaLite
	database
Message-ID: <1355103150.81938.YahooMailNeo@web122305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I found something strange with data in a table within a SpatiaLite database.

As you can see in this image [1], viewing the table in QSpatiaLite, the column GEO_COD (integer) appears well. The same column, when viewed in the QGIS attribute table, appears with values ?totally different.

Can anyone find an explanation?

I leave the database in question in order to test [2].

I'm using QGIS master on Xubuntu 12.04.


Best regards,

Hi all.
I see the command has been changed, but now I can't get a result (usual "cannot

Anyone confirms?

Did anyone come up with a workaround for this? I am still getting the error on my build attempts for trunk:

Hi John,

I have a new pull request in for fixing this on Mac, but am not
entirely sure I did it correctly (or what the new FAKE_LIB_GRASS_GIS
does or how to test it):
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/349

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/349.patch

Regards,

Larry

Hi Larry,

The commit that Radim just made looks like it gets past the build issue. I've not tested the application (or know what to test) to see if the updates are working.

Cheers,
John

Thanks Larry,
I have pushed that to the master. The library should make it possible
to run GRASS modules without mapset and data data import. You can try
to run a GRASS module in this mode  from GRASS Tools ( which is now
always enabled), if no mapset is open. Most probably it will need more
fixes on Mac and Win. It is work in progress, currently there are only
few modules and you can find problems.

I'll write more about in another thread soon.

Radim

Hi Radim,

I just tested one of the available modules on a local DEM file, and here is there error message that appeared when I ran it:

 Cannot start module r.slope.aspect
command: /usr/local/Cellar/grass/6.4.2/grass-6.4.2/bin/r.slope.aspect --interface-description

ERROR: GISRC - variable not set 

Note that I am running a version of grass installed locally, not from the application that William makes available.

Regards,
John

Subject: [Qgis-developer] commit logs verbosity
Message-ID: <20121210201437.GO2668@gnash>

Dear qgis committers, may I ask you to make your commit logs
more verbose than a bare ticket number reference ?

It is nice to be able to know what's going on by simply reading
the git log, without the need for a network connection and
a running and live bug tracker.

Also commands like `git log --grep=<some_keyword>` become nearly
useless if the commit log contains no description of what's changed.

Ideally the log would have 1 line with short description and a
longer description in a second paragraph. Note that this format
is also expected by `git format-patch` which turns the first line
into a mail subject and the subsequent paragraph to the body.
Also github pull requests use the same semantic for interpreting
the log.

Thanks everyone for your attention to source repository quality :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS Direct
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYoV4ZnHL8izi5xCSxDeDgehnsnGQcc=u+ux7LVOiHvaNw@mail.gmail.com>

The GRASS Direct is an environment developed within QGIS GRASS
plugin/provider which makes it possible to run GRASS raster modules
without GRASS mapset and without data conversion to GRASS format.
Basically it is a library implementing GRASS data read/write function
which is using QGIS providers to read/write data. In direct mode, the
GRASS modules are run with this library instead of  the standard GRASS
gis library.

The GRASS modules may be run in direct mode from GRASS Tools (which
are now always enabled) if no mapset is opened. The interface is
similar to the standard GRASS Tools apart that the region is selected
in combo box in top of options (to be discussed) and the output is a
GeoTIFF file. It is also possible to run GRASS modules in direct mode
from a shell if some environment variables are set. You can see those
variables printed in top of the output tab.

This is work in progress, so I was reluctant to announce that but
because it had caused some compilation problems, it was necessary to
explain a bit how it works. Currently there are only few modules
enabled and you can find various problems. Especially it was only
tested on Linux and most probably more fixes will be necessary on Mac
and Windows.

I believe that GRASS Direct could also be used in SEXTANTE with a
little work. It would be necessary however to distinguish modules
which may be run in direct mode from those which may not (mostly
vector modules).

Sorry for the problems I caused on Mac and Windows and many thanks to
J?rgen and Larry for fixes.

Hi Radim,

This is a great new addition to QGIS, so thank you for you work on it.

I wanted to bring my comment I made elsewhere on my Mac testing into this, more appropriate thread:

I just tested one of the available modules on a local DEM file, and here is there error message that appeared when I ran it:

Cannot start module r.slope.aspect
command: /usr/local/Cellar/grass/6.4.2/grass-6.4.2/bin/r.slope.aspect --interface-description

ERROR: GISRC - variable not set 

Note that I am running a version of grass installed locally, not from the application that William makes available.

Cheers,
John

Radim, awesome stuff! Thanks for the introduction on it. Looking
forward to using this inside of SEXTANTE.

Getting the same thing as John here, but with Kyngchaos.com GRASS.
When using the Kyngchaos.com GRASS, the app starts via an internal
shell script that configures most of those GRASS env variables [0].

John, again we Mac users are up against shell environment not being
transferred into QGIS. I really think having a spot in the app
preferences to allow manually added/augmented env variables (like
PATH, etc.) would be very handy indeed.

It could be kinda like setting up a build environment inside of
QtCreator [1]. The nice thing about having such an env variable editor
(besides setting up custom variables) is that it would allow both C++
and Python components to inherit the env settings. Example: thereby
giving SEXTANTE access to any custom external install location on the
filesystem.

Note how slim the default passed environment is for Mac GUI apps in
[1] (nothing like my .bash_profile, etc.).

I really think this needs addressed (especially for Mac users), and
could benefit all platforms with further start up environment
customization.

Regards,

Larry

I don't know if you have tested sextante grass tools, but I cannot get anything to work, likely because of the same environment problems that we are seeing with GRASS Direct. If we could cut through this problem with a solution as you propose, that would be great.

If you get such error it means that the fake library was not found
(standard grass_gis library is complaining about missing environment).
The problem was that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH was not set. Please try again
with master.

What is the 'app' in this context? GRASS, QGIS or a single GRASS
module? Which variables are set by the script?

As I wrote, there was missing DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac, please try
also with current master.

The 'app' for Larry is GRASS-6.4.2.app, as packaged by William. My version is installed by a package installer called homebrew. Although not an application bundle, it also runs from a shell script rather than from a binary directly, i.e., :

The GRASS-6.4.app, which is a bundled Mac app [0, Qt example] from
Kyngchaos.com. But the same holds for the bundled QGIS.app: the Mac
operating system, by default, does not pass in the full shell
environment, as per a user's terminal profile, to a double-clicked
bundled app. It only passes in a very basic env that does NOT even
include /usr/local, PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. There are tricks to
get around this, but my idea is to allow the user to set the env
inside of the QGIS preferences (much better).

The custom env setup in QGIS for Mac could offer a button to load in
common env setups, like for Kyngchaos.com frameworks, etc.

If a Mac user starts the bundled app's embedded binary (e.g.
QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/QGIS) from a terminal session, then the env is
passed in, but this is NOT normal Mac usage, certainly not for a
regular user.

The Mac GRASS-6.4.app gets around these issues by first running a
shell script to set up the env before launching the embedded binary
[1]. So, when the user double-clicks GRASS-6.4.app everything is
configured on launch. This could be the same with QGIS (for Mac
users), but in a custom way, allowing the user to configure their env
in the QGIS app preferences (would require QGIS restart after a
change). This could be similar to what's done in QtDesigner [2]. Then,
all components of QGIS would benefit from a custom inherited env
setup, at least for Mac users, and all done from within the GUI (user
friendly).

Getting compile errors. I think you need to use (works for me):

#elif defined(Q_OS_MAC)

instead of:

#elif Q_OS_MAC

I think because Q_OS_MAC is a macro. Again, since DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is
not passed to QGIS.app a launch from terminal session is needed to
test.

Sure, but not in the near future (see below).

I've no time in this moment to look at your patch, too much
things to do and very few time... but if you open a pull
request other devs can give their opinions on your patch and
if it sounds good they can merge it.

Message-ID: <1355183152307-5022061.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I need to use  GDAL  trunk 1.10dev (or Gdal SVN) via qgis 1.8.
What are the different ways to use GDAL trunk 1.10dev (or Gdal SVN) with
qgis 1.8?

1/ Is it possible to setup this installation via "osgeo4w setup" ?

2/Or am i obliged to compile the softwares in two steps ( compile gdal svn &
qgis targetting gdal svn) ?

3/ If i am obliged to compile the 2 softwares... when i should compile qgis
, it would be possible to target the gdal svn version?

In advance, thank you to throw light for me.

With kind regards.

+1 for me.

I'd also like to encourage everybody to be sensible when squashing 
commits (e.g. when merging a pull request). Apart from loosing 
information in the commit messages it makes it harder to revert parts of 
a pulled branch.

Matthias

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgHLEEw+PXtqA4zyrCJ=StKh-jrtMVXB-E6ccQM61Y0EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I created an altered version of ftools' DensifyGeometries.py called
DensifyGeometriesInterval.py and put it in the same folder

/home/agraser/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/ftools

What do I have to do to make it show up in the toolbox?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

You need to expose your algorithm is provider. Open file FToolsAlgorithmProvider.py, add import statement with your new alg
(use existing statements as example) and then in __init__ method
add your algorithm to algorithms list ? variable self.alglist.

Hope this helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend group API
Message-ID: <20121211075616.GB7164@gnash>

Hi all,
I've recently had troubles using the LegendGroup API from a python plugin
in that the addGroup method returns in integer which seems to be the input
for moveLayer, but it doesn't work as such.

More info I've added to this ticket http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6591

I've found that addGroup returns what QModelIndex.row() returns, but that
index doesn't seem to identify the group in any way..

Before 2.0 gets out it seems worth fixing that API, do you agree ?

One option would be to store an unique identifier in each LegendGroup object
and use that identifier for all lookups. There would be a counter within
each Legend incremented everytime a new group is added. Would this break
any existing usage ? Are there tests for this in place ?
The advantage of this is that the interface of addGroup and moveLayer would
not change.

Another option is the change addGroup to return and moveLayer to take
a full QModelIndex object, which would then need to be exposed to python
(if not already available) and could require upgrade of any plugin or core
code using those interfaces. Also I don't think a QModelIndex is persistent
so would not simplify identification of a group in any way.

Anita

If you algorithm is of general interest and you don't mind sharing it,
we can put it in the SEXTANTE code and distribute it along with the
other ftools algorithms.

If you do not want to have it in the ftools group, then you can also
create you own algorithm provider in its own plugin (the example
provider plugin will show you how to do it, or you can ask us here),
and that will work just copying to the plugins folder, in case you
want to install it in a different machine.

Hope this helps

Victor

It's a very simple modification. Instead of providing the algorithm
with a fixed number of points to insert into the geometry, I made it
calculate how many points it needs to put one at every interval step.

I'll test some more and send it to you later if you don't mind. Or
should I go the Github way?

Anita

Hi!

Would it make sense to integrate the "new" algorithm as a selectable option
into the "old" algorithm?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbology by attribute
Message-ID: <50C6F81A.7010403@jena.de>

Dear Devs,

I am wondering if this question has been raised before... Has there been 
any thoughts about symbolizing by attribute (similar to the new labeller 
where I have the option to set color, transparency, scale etc. by 
attribute)?
Background: I have a "map" drawn in CAD. All lines have colors and 
stroke-widths defined there, all cells (i.e. points) have one of some 
100 cells attached to it. I created svg files from the cells and would 
like to set the svg to each point from an attribute, too.

best wishes

Bernhard

Hi Werner!
Probably, but I don't know how to add optional fields - if there is
anything that needs to be considered.

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xRpcDQiXRybxnuGMSUd7OMJQ9vw2M5AHP=hTf67Mhyng@mail.gmail.com>

Until now I've mostly created vector layers on QGIS, delegating raster
creation to custom GDAL utilities.
Recently I looked into QgsGdalProvider and I saw that it exposes
the QgsRasterDataProvider::Create capability.
I wonder if it's possible to create a brand new raster (geotiff or what
else) using this provider and, in case, what is the right workflow to do
that. I haven't found examples of doing it...

 Hi Bernhard,

 Yes - this is definitely on our radar. We need this for our waste-water 
 application. It is called "data defined symbology" and used to work with 
 the old symbology.

 With the new symbology, data defined symbology is more complex to 
 implement as we have symbol levels.

 I'll contact you privately about financing the thing.

Seems this is not option, but another method. So if all parameters
remains the same I suggest to add an combobox where user can select
which method to use: classic or new one.

If parameter sets used by algorithms are different IMO it is better
to implement new algorithm separately.

To be honest, I don't see a use case for the original
DensifyGeometries. It's behavior is quite strange: You tell it to add
10 pts but it will add 20 pts if the linestring happens to consist of
3 nodes and 30 pts if 4 nodes ...

It is not necessary to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH before QGIS is started to
run GRASS modules because GRASS modules are executed as new processes
and it is enough to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH when the process is started.
I am not sure however where the GRASS libs are located. I see the
libraries in

  GRASS-6.4.pkg/Contents/GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS/lib

but the grass.sh [0] is setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to

  $HOME/Library/GRASS/Modules/lib:/Library/GRASS/6.4/Modules/lib

Where is pointing the cmake GRASS_PREFIX? To the
GRASS-6.4.app/Contents/MacOS? Can we get the path to GRASS libs as
${GRASS_PREFIX}/lib?

However, to get the QGIS GRASS plugin fully working (display and edit
GRASS maps, manage region), it is necessary to set the environment
before QGIS is started as you suggested.

I've a patch ready implementing a model similar to the above
(only difference is that the counter is a static within the group class)

Yes it is possible. You can use a provider directly

QgsRasterDataProvider * provider = ( QgsRasterDataProvider*
)QgsProviderRegistry::instance()->provider( "gdal", dataSource );
provider->write( data, band, width, height, xOffset, yOffset )

if you your algorithm implemented as QgsRasterInterface you can use
higher level QgsRasterFileWriter which will do the work splitting
raster into parts

QgsRasterPipe* pipe = new QgsRasterPipe();
pipe->set( inputProvider->clone() );
pipe->insert( 1, yourInterface );
QgsRasterFileWriter fileWriter( fileName );
fileWriter.writeRaster( pipe, width, height, extent, crs );

 Hi,

 I would like to see such an improved legend interface. Currently the 
 group and layer index even behaves differently between version 1.8 and 
 version 1.9. I have to check the version and decrease the index in case 
 it is version 1.9.

 I use this horrible code to find a group and attach a new layer:

 --------------------
 		#get the current group index of Sch?ler group
 		groups = []
 		for group in self.legend.groupLayerRelationship():
 			groups.append(group[0])
 		groupIndex = groups.index(groupName)
 		#move new layer to existing group
 		if QGis.QGIS_VERSION[0:3] >= "1.9":
 			groupIndex -= 1
 		self.legend.moveLayer(schoolDistrictLayer, groupIndex)
 -------------------

 Really horrible - this really should be a one-liner ... and not a 
 different behavior between QGIS versions for no good reason.

I think Martin has some ideas about how we can improve the legend
based stuff.  Might be best to see what he has in mind.

Thanks Radim, I wasn't aware of all these news in trunk!
The QgsRasterPipe is really powerful.

Is there some doc about it?
I've run through the code to understand the logic behind QgsRasterPipe
(QRP) and QgsRasterInterface (QRI).
I see that for a QRI must be set a an input QRI (setInput method). If I
understand it correctly a QRP can have various "branches" made by sequences
of QRI?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Edit 3D postgis layers don't work..
Message-ID: <1355226014679-5022199.post@n6.nabble.com>

Good morning to all
I know that qgis don't have the ability to edit and handle Z valuez for
vector layers.
Today I faced a problem with Postgis polygon layer.
I can delete a feature but not add vertices to features.
Qgis don't let me save the edit session if I add some vertices to a feature.

Is there some workaround to bypass this problem?
Thankyou
Pietro

Do you mean QgsRasterInterface with multiple inputs? This is not
currently supported. In theory you can write an interface with
multiple inputs, but for example QgsRasterFileWriter is using some
info from srcInput, i.e. the first interface (provider) in the pipe,
there is no support for multiple srcInput. Most probably it would
work, but there some problems may appear. You could also overwrite
srcInput in your  QgsRasterInterface subclass in which multiple
branches are connected.

Ok, but I wonder what is QgsRasterInterface.setInput [1] meant for? Is the
input supposed to be only a QgsRasterDataProvider? If I see that it
requires a QgsRasterInterface I think it can be whatever
else QgsRasterInterface...

Well... the whole idea is to get rid of that interface and replace it
by something saner. Maybe I have already posted that in a previous
discussion, in my view we should have something like:
- QgsLibraryItem - base item, basically a node of the legend tree
- various item specializations: QgsLibraryLayer, QgsLibraryGroup etc
with some additional methods
- an entry point in QgisInterface for getting root QgsLibraryItem
We already have those QgsLibraryXXX classes, but they are derived from
QTreeWidgetItem and that's not acceptable for API.

A second step would be to move library view to GUI library so that
also 3rd party applications can use the legend (instead of just
accessing the instance within QGIS).

Martin

Yes, you are right. Any class inheriting from QgsRasterInterface may
be plugged into the QgsRasterPipe but all interfaces will be in a
single line, no forks.

BTW, you should always test if QgsRasterPipe::insert() was successful,
because if connection of interfaces fails, the interface is not
inserted. Only compatible interfaces may be connected. For example, it
is not possible to connect QgsSingleBandGrayRenderer to an interface
of ARGB32 type, because it needs numerical data as input.
QgsRasterResampleFilter only works with ARGB32 as input etc.

Hi,

the same thing happens here. Using Sqliteman the value looks OK but when
using QGis Attribute table it turns into the strange value.

Is suspected it had to do with an int (32) conversion and so made a
small C test to confirm. If you run the C test in the linked ZIP you'll
get the following result when trying to pass 9100100101 as an integer:
(Sorry it's in Portuguese but it asks for an integer number and then
prints it)

Digite um n?mero: 9100100101
O int ? 510165509

I've also made another test in python to read the table, but python
automatically uses long when the value is unsuitable for int. That was
the result I got: the value looks OK but it's type is long, not integer.

In the link: the C test, the python test and the error print.

Cheers,
Rui.

 Sounds good to me.

 I'd also like to see enhancements on groups in the future. Groups can 
 be potentially more intelligent if they can hold properties. F.e. some 
 web services (like WMS) require metadata on groups (like title, 
 abstracts, responsible entities). One could also think about group 
 opacity - a useful concept from the SVG world - see 
 http://fog.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/groups.png - the difference is 
 that on the left the elements are first composited and then the 
 transparency was added on the composite image, whereas on the right each 
 element got opacity added and then composited.

 One could also think about clipping and masking on group level.

 I am sure others find additional interesting use cases for properties 
 on groups.

Ok, Radim, I'm sorry if I insist on this, it's just to understand it
correctly.
To add a QgsRasterInterface in a QgsRasterPipe I would
use QgsRasterPipe.insert(idx,QgsRasterInterface), but what is
the QgsRasterInterface.setInput(QgsRasterInterface ) for?
If I set a QgsRasterInterface, which will have its own input, as the input
for another QgsRasterInterface, I'm creating a chain
of QgsRasterInterfaces...
Help me to understand it...

+1. We also need improvement for legend groups in python API. 

BTW, if we go in the direction of having groups with properties, we are one
step closer to data blocks present in Arcgis. A data block is linked to a
composer map, and has a lot of properties (size, frames, geographical grids,
scr, extent, clip & mask... ). 
This could lead us to an elegant way of handling multimap composers, and
maybe also to be able to switch main mapcanvas into paper units, with a
frame indicating paper pages.. Really userfull when dealing with text
annotations that need to be calibrated for paper and not screen. 

R?gis


Is that a long term target for you? Should we try to plan it for 3.0?

Indeed. Well, oneliner it could become by simply exposing
a findGroupIndexByName kind of method, but I think the confusion
here is about the semantic associated with such "group index"
variable.

In my case I've had to do with addGroup returning a "groupIndex"
and moveLayer taking a "groupIndex" but those functions giving
a different meaning to the "groupIndex" concept.

It's more about documentation than anything else.

I think Martin ideas is sensible and I do see the code is going
in that direction. But even if the classes are decoupled from
the QT tree widget we'll need a way to identify groups, as much
as we do with layers (which do have an ID). I've no problem with
all elements (be them layers or groups or whatever) share the
same "id space" but each one should have an identifier which
remains valid for the whole lifetime of that object.

Could very well be a pointer, at the C++ level (altought there's
currently no moveLayer method taking a Group pointer), but keeping
an integer is also fine, if it helps keeping the API small and
stable.

The Mac grass.sh startup only customizes the startup for OS X.  The standard ${GRASS_PREFIX}/lib (and everything else) is set in init.sh, same as other platforms.

Or at QGIS startup from some configuration preference.

QgsRasterInterface.setInput(QgsRasterInterface ) is used to set input,
but you dont  have to call it if you are using QgsRasterPipe because
it is called by QgsRasterPipe.insert(idx,QgsRasterInterface).

Yes, QgsRasterPipe just helps you to manage such chain. It will
automatically connect the interfaces. QgsRasterPipe represents a chain
of interfaces.

Hi chingchai

Glad you got qgis master working. 

No, there shouldn't be any problem with GDAL if you install PostGIS 2.0. I believe both QGIS and PostGIS are compiled with their own versions of GDAL.

Ian

Please keep in mind that it is also necessary to be able to:
- move/put a layer into a sub group (not only a top level item as it was in
1.8)
- remove a sub group (not only a top level item as it was in 1.8)
- move a layer before or after another layer inside the same group
- walk thought the legend hierarchy even when there are sub groups and
multiple group with the same name (the groupLayerRelationship is unusable in
some circumstances)

I'm a fan of incremental refactoring, to minimize regressions.
In this case I don't think the current API, nor the 1.8 one allowed
for moving a layer before or after another one inside or outside a group,
but in all APIs the so-called "groupIndex" seems to be effectively used
as an identifier fo the group:

    //! Add a new group
    //! @note added parentIndex parameter in 1.7
    virtual int addGroup( QString name, bool expand, int parentIndex ) = 0;

    //! Remove group on index
    virtual void removeGroup( int groupIndex ) =0;

    //! Move a layer to a group
    virtual void moveLayer( QgsMapLayer * layer, int groupIndex ) =0;

There's even:

    //! Check if a group exists
    //! @note added in 1.5
    virtual bool groupExists( int groupIndex ) =0;

All these functions take an "int" but all assume it identifies a group,
not a location in a tree.

I'm happy with the interface extending to allow more fine-tuned access to
the tree, but it must also be possile to effectively use the above functions
the way they are documented to work, and adding the concept of a
"group identifier" (basically replacing "groupIndex" with "groupID")
keeps the same interface just making it unambiguos.

Methods dealing with the tree I think should not contain the "Layer" or
"Group" names, but only "Tree" and "Element"...

Hi Frank,

Yes it would be great if grid shifts are supported in proj.4 by default, but for more importantly for us within Qgis. Currently I see QGIS builds it's CRS database using crssync which relies on GDAL OSRExportToProj4 for creating proj.4 strings. Does that mean that the gdal CSV files also need to support the grid shift? Before I raise any tickets it would be good to know where to actually fix the problem.

nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is the transformation between NZGD1949 and NZGD2000, not WGS84 and NZGD2000. See more information here http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/software-downloads#distortiongrid. nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is created from the ASCII file which can be downloaded here http://www.linz.govt.nz/sites/default/files/geodetic/software-downloads/nzgd2kgrid9911.zip

Cheers,
Jeremy

Subject: Re: [gdal-dev] EPSG 8.0 Upgrade

Jeremy,

Unfortunately I do not automatically pickup references to grid shift files from the EPSG database.  To the extent these are supported it is accomplished by special hackery. In fact skimming the epsg file, I think the only datum for which grid shift files are used *by default* is NAD27.   Perhaps this would be a good time for me to review how to utilize at least the grid shift files we are distributing with PROJ.4 like ntf_r93.gsb and nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb.

Hmm, I am getting the impression that nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is actually the transformation between NZGD2000 and WGS84 and that we would actually need another file - possibly something like Nzgd49ToNzgd2K.gdc to support NZGD1949 - is that right?

I'd suggest you file a ticket in the PROJ.4 Trac on this issue with suggestions on how to proceed.

Best regards,
Frank

Folks,

At the request of Howard Butler, I have upgraded PROJ.4, libgeotiff, and
GDAL to use the EPSG 8.0 database in development "trunk".

This was accomplished, as usual based on the process described here:

   http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/geotiff/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/README

Amoung other things this will result in some datums having new preferred
datum shift solutions.  Upgrade with care.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compilation of Qgis 1.8 with gdal svn
	(Windows7_64bits)
Message-ID: <1355269492248-5022352.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I need to use qgis 1.8 with the last gdal svn 1.10.0 on my Windows 7 64 bits
station.I know that i'm obliged to compile in a 1st time gdal svn & in a 2nd
time qgis targetting the gdal svn version. Up to now, i succeed in compiling
gdal svn thanks to "TortoiseSvn" & Visual Studio. Now, i 'm trying to
compile Qgis1.8 thanks to this following "help install_api" :
 http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc13

I 'm following the 4th part of this webpage called "Building on windows". I
have chosen to use Visual C++ Express edition rather than MinGW. Up to now,
i installed :*Cmake/Flex/Bison/SVN/GIT/OSGeo4W. For information, i have not
installed  the "Microsoft Windows Server? 2003 R2 Platform SDK" (Core
SDK/Build environment(x86 32 bits).
Then, thanks to OSGeo4W(advanced_installation), i installed
:*expat/fcgi/gdal/grass/gsl-devel/iconv/pyqt4/qt4-devel/qwt5-devel-qt4/sip/spatialite/libspatialindex-devel/python-qscintilla.
For information, i chosen "Gdal_dev 1.8-Pre6"  even if i want the last
version of gdal dev called "1.10.0", unselectable via this OSGeo4W_setup.
Then, i pasted the file unistd.h from "GnuWin32\include" toward VC\include
directory of my Visual C++ installation.

Now, i'm at the step 4.1.3 called 'Setting up the Visual Studio project with
CMake'. I do not understand the instructions and how to create the batch
file.

1/ Do you think the method that I opted is adapted to my goal (use qgis with
the last version of gdal svn that i have already compiled) ? This method is
really the easiest and most viable?

2/Could you give me details in order i succeed  in creating the batch file.

3/How to ensure that  the building take into account the gdal svn that i
have already compiled?

In advance, thank you to throw light for me.
With kind regards.

On a sort of related topic, (another NZ projection :-)

EPSG:3994 supercedes EPSG:3752, as EPSG got the initial specification wrong. This is a projection used for the wider region around NZ, rather than the NZ mainland, and this projection is used primarily in ESRI to avoid 180 meridian issues.

I assume once QGIS picks up the new GDAL which picks up the current EPSG list, it will natively support 3994 instead of 3752.

I was also wondering if there is any reason that http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3994/ does not include a Postgis, Mapserver or Proj.4 definition, and if there is any way the map there could show the area covered by the coordinate system rather than the longitudes not covered?

Thanks,

? Brent Wood

Hi Frank,

Yes it would be great if grid shifts are supported in proj.4 by default, but for more importantly for us within Qgis. Currently I see QGIS builds it's CRS database using crssync which relies on GDAL OSRExportToProj4 for creating proj.4 strings. Does that mean that the gdal CSV files also need to support the grid shift? Before I raise any tickets it would be good to know where to actually fix the problem.

nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is the transformation between NZGD1949 and NZGD2000, not WGS84 and NZGD2000. See more information here http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/software-downloads#distortiongrid. nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is created from the ASCII file which can be downloaded here http://www.linz.govt.nz/sites/default/files/geodetic/software-downloads/nzgd2kgrid9911.zip

Cheers,
Jeremy

Jeremy,

Unfortunately I do not automatically pickup references to grid shift files from the EPSG database.? To the extent these are supported it is accomplished by special hackery. In fact skimming the epsg file, I think the only datum for which grid shift files are used *by default* is NAD27.???Perhaps this would be a good time for me to review how to utilize at least the grid shift files we are distributing with PROJ.4 like ntf_r93.gsb and nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb.

Hmm, I am getting the impression that nzgd2kgrid0005.grd is actually the transformation between NZGD2000 and WGS84 and that we would actually need another file - possibly something like Nzgd49ToNzgd2K.gdc to support NZGD1949 - is that right?

I'd suggest you file a ticket in the PROJ.4 Trac on this issue with suggestions on how to proceed.

Best regards,
Frank

Folks,

At the request of Howard Butler, I have upgraded PROJ.4, libgeotiff, and
GDAL to use the EPSG 8.0 database in development "trunk".

This was accomplished, as usual based on the process described here:

???http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/geotiff/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/README

Amoung other things this will result in some datums having new preferred
datum shift solutions.? Upgrade with care.

Brent, we've discussed some of those features for spatialreference.org
(at least a better map view). I need to double check with the authors if
the code for site is up somewhere to facilitate taking patches for new
features (It's written in django).

Thanks,
Alex

If it was you would not have needed to compile it.

What do you mean?  A batch file is just a plain text file ending on .cmd or .bat.
Open an editor, cut & paste and save the file.

Point GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR and GDAL_LIBRARY to your build of 1.10.

Hello all.

I agree with Massimo. We, users and python plugin developers, need a very small set of functions to work with the layer tree.

For example, we cannot find a way to add a subgroup to the top or middle of an existing group. They are always put at the bottom of the group:

-group 1
  - layer 1.1
  - layer 1.2
  - group 1.1

This way qgis is really very limited in automating complex cartography.

You should be able to do:

- group 1
  - layer 1.1
  - group 1.1
  - layer 1.2

Just quickly fixing the simple, obvious limitations on the api today would be the first step, that would allow a new revision fast. Later, you can revamp the whole thing with all the bells and whistles you want...

Regards,
Duarte

Please keep in mind that it is also necessary to be able to:
- move/put a layer into a sub group (not only a top level item as it was in
1.8)
- remove a sub group (not only a top level item as it was in 1.8)
- move a layer before or after another layer inside the same group
- walk thought the legend hierarchy even when there are sub groups and multiple group with the same name (the groupLayerRelationship is unusable in some circumstances)

So what are you proposing as a quick fix ?
Did you look at my pull request ?

No. My pull request is aimed at fixing a bug, not at introducing
a new feature.

> We could get by with a simple movelayer (or addlayer or addgroup) that works with groups too, not just layers, and inside whatever tree level. The embed layers menu option works fine using the C api, that just isn't exposed to python. I've attached images of an example.

Sure, I see no problem with adding a moveGroup to put a group under another.
But I guess such new feature should also be supported by project load/save,
whereas project must be able to store the full hierarchy
(is that already the case ?)

Are you willing to provide a patch to do that ?
Do we have a testing framework for project save/load roundtrip ?

I wish I knew enough to provide a patch, I really do.

I think this is not new functionality in qgis: we can do it by hand, save, load. No problem. We just cannot automate it using python in its current state.

We are working on a python plugin and as it gets ready we will publish it. Today, the limitation is we cannot add nested groups *unless* they are at the bottom of the parent group. Because python api cannot insert/move them to any other position than bottom of the parent.

The python api is just missing this small piece of functionality to have 100% of the basis of layer tree manipulation:
Support moving a group up and down inside a given parent... we could not find a way to do that.

Everything else is already there, with some quirks, but we've been able to work our way around those in 1.9...

So, my plea was just to ask those who know to make a few little fixes before going for a full blown remake of the legend api, since that subject was being discussed.

Thanks,
Duarte

No. My pull request is aimed at fixing a bug, not at introducing a new feature.

> We could get by with a simple movelayer (or addlayer or addgroup) that works with groups too, not just layers, and inside whatever tree level. The embed layers menu option works fine using the C api, that just isn't exposed to python. I've attached images of an example.

Sure, I see no problem with adding a moveGroup to put a group under another.
But I guess such new feature should also be supported by project load/save, whereas project must be able to store the full hierarchy (is that already the case ?)

Are you willing to provide a patch to do that ?
Do we have a testing framework for project save/load roundtrip ?

 Hi,

 I am trying to work with the wiki in hub.qgis.org - it is dead slow.

 Can we do something about it? Yet another bot paralyzing redmine?

this is impacting our public image - can we find a way to fix it. If necessary, we
can put some resources on it.
Thanks.

Hi,


If I understand the manual http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html in section 2.2, sqlite/spatialite will consider all INT, INTEGER, TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, UNSIGNED BIG INT, INT2 and INT8 types, simply as INTEGER. Hence, he considers the value 9100100101 correctly.

If the datasource supports datatypes with a length greater than the "normal" INT, then QGIS should show this fields correctly, right?

So, there is some way to "force" QGIS to properly handle with these INTEGERS from spatialite databases? 



Should I fill a ticket?

Thanks!
Pedro

Hi,

the same thing happens here. Using Sqliteman the value looks OK but when
using QGis Attribute table it turns into the strange value.

Is suspected it had to do with an int (32) conversion and so made a
small C test to confirm. If you run the C test in the linked ZIP you'll
get the following result when trying to pass 9100100101 as an integer:
(Sorry it's in Portuguese but it asks for an integer number and then
prints it)

Digite um n?mero: 9100100101
O int ? 510165509

I've also made another test in python to read the table, but python
automatically uses long when the value is unsuitable for int. That was
the result I got: the value looks OK but it's type is long, not integer.

In the link: the C test, the python test and the error print.

Tests: http://ubuntuone.com/4eQMOLf4KvlAbYHKxkqBIY

Cheers,
Rui.

 Hi,

 It would be really good to do something about it. I don't understand 
 the problem - is it a hardware problem (do we need more servers) or a 
 configuration problem or a maintenance problem?

 I agree with Paolo that the situation should be improved. Who could fix 
 the issue and do we need financial resources to fix it?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hi!

I don't know if I am right but personally I feel that we do have too many
services on ONE Server which is only a VM too.
I don't think that the traffic is the problem - but something that the
server does on a regulary base (indexing? building packages? redmine
restructuring?) is causing the high load which seems to also affect the web
based responsiveness.
I would think that all the things that does nothing have to do with web
based services (the only thing i can think of now is building some packages
.. or maybe also building documentation pages) should be moved to a
dedicated build server somewhere.
But I can also be wrong ..

regards
werner

 Hi,

 I think we could easily pay from the existing QGIS funds for a 
 dedicated build/test server. At 
 http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produktmatrix/rootserver-produktmatrix-ex 
 (where I also have my private server and the GIS server of the City of 
 Uster) you can get dedicated root servers with lots of memory and good 
 CPUs for about 70-90 Euros per month. It is a very reliable company and 
 runs on renewable energy. Adds up to 840 to 1080 Euros per year - in my 
 opinion a good investment if we can get better performance for our core 
 services.

Hi Andreas!

Good suggestion but why paying when somebody is offering to host it?
I mean - I can fully understand that you want to be independent but - In my
case the Server would be fully under my control and is directly connected
to the austrian VIX (Vienna Internet Exchange node) so it should be super
fast ..
Even more I can offer full root to other admins too .. I see it just to
reduce the build load from the main server which has to deal with users ..

but you are right .. ask the PSC .. :)

regards
Werner

 Hi Werner,

 I did not know about the free offer. In that case we should take this 
 offer.

I agree we need to fix this, and before 2.0 is out.  We can't be
telling users to put their new plugins in our plugin repo and then it
is down on and off.

If we need to pay for something then we should do it, if not take up
any free offers we can get.

I think having another VM would be a better choice than a dedicated
machine: it should be easier to scale when necessary and I suppose
also price may be lower (as it may share one physical machine with
other VMs).

whatever is the best solution. But should result in a more reliable
infrastructure.

The builds work fine and don't cause the issues (and nicing them didn't help a
bit) - the only problem with that, is that the diskspace runs out - something
was added lately that occupies space.

I think it's the documentation site. But Alex is about to organize more space.
So that's should be shortly solved.

But I'm just monitoring the stuff and try to find out what's wrong, although I
didn't setup any of the webservices.  So it's hard to tell what's necessary and
whats not and sometimes if something behaves normal or goes bezerk.

There's now a script in place that restarts apache, whenever is stops
responding - with a report of what was going on at the time.

It's currently about cron.daily time (or was when I started this) - there were
four planets jobs running feedjack_update.py and apparently stressing
postgresql with concurrent queries (SELECTs, INSERTs DELETEs & UPDATEs).   I
supposed these should be guarded to not run in parallel.  And there was also an
unniced backup of redmine running.

There are probably more cron jobs that have that problem.  Some cron jobs and
webservices also don't/didn't rotate their logs (and produces/d huge ever
growing logs - which apparently nobody looks at anyway).

BTW The nightly builds are niced and should only run if there's nothing else
wanting the CPU.  See the red stuff in
http://webextra.osgeo.osuosl.org/munin/osgeo.org/qgis.osgeo.org-cpu.html.

I for one don't want to move the build stuff to another server - I would even
have one (also from Hetzner ;), if I wanted to do that.  Please move everything
else ;)

BTW can we alternatively get more CPU on our VM?

Hi,

Are there any join tools (location and or attribute joins) for
Sextante? If not, I could probably give them a try.

Yes, I'm going to request +10GB and +1 Cores, hopefully this week.

As for the plugin repo, I think we should look at mirror/caching options
for the plugin repo files that are served up rather than a whole
separate server. Some sort of cdn service would make plugin install
quite quick for many people around the world and free up some resources
on our server. Of course we want to find a service that refreshes or is
easy for us to push updates quickly. Alternate to that, since several of
us have fast servers around with space, I could setup a mirrorbrain
which auto refers people to geographic closest copies of plugins (I ran
this for osgeo live for a while).

Thanks,
Alex

PS: I'm happy to host mirrors of content at my university too (West
Coast US)

In that case we would loose the download counter.

Are you sure that serving plugin packages is eating a significant
percentage of resources?

Well, yes and no, we could look for a way that lets us keep the download
counter (fyi mirrorbrain hits the main server before delegating so you
still get hit counts).

No, I was approaching the issue from the perspective of if the plugins
download is the most critical thing to not interrupt we should find a
way to increase it's level of service no matter what the other stuff is
doing.

Thanks,

You have "Add polygon attributes to points" and "Join attributes from
a table", both of them in SAGA. I do not know if that is what you
need.

If you start developing your own algorithm, feel free to ask me for
help if you need it!

Message-ID: <50CAC82E.5020807@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I noticed that QGIS throws an error when trying to connect to a plain (non PostGIS)
db. I think this limitation should be removed, because:
- QGIS can load non spatial tables, so also a non spatial db is somehow usable
- EXTENSION postgis can be created from within QGIS (e.g. through DB Manager), so an
user could connect to a non spatial PostgreSQL and make it spatial.
Any reason not to do so?
Thanks.

Hi Victor! I think there should be a way to do that without having to

Thanks for this. However, I think we should rather find a way to have SAGA installed
by default, or at least easily.
All the best.

I think this should be one of the priorities. SAGA works fine in Linux
and Windows (in windows it is portable, needs no install at all), but
I think Mac is a problem. In my experience, calling it is much more
stable than calling GRASS (there are less things to take care of, no
mapsets to create, etc...), it is really powerful, and it is just
around 10MB.

Having SAGA instaled transparently (with the alternative organization
of algorithms, SAGA algorithm can be shown as "native" ones, no need
to mention where they come from), will make SEXTANTE for QGIS a really
powerful option out-of the box. Considering that GRASS is already
installed with QGIS by default, those two apps will be probably more
than enough for most cases.

Anyway, a truly native join algorithm is clearly a good idea, and the
more native algorithms we have, the more examples that other people
can use to create their own ones, so many thanks for your proposal,
Anita!

Victor

Hi.
I didn't know of the OSX problems, too bad. I tried to convince SAGA
devs to add their package to osgeo4w, but have been unsuccessful so far.
If someone has better grip with them, please help. Victor, are you
implying that simply adding the binary to osgeo4w would be ok, without
the need to compile?
Thanks.

That would be fine for me too, but is it on anyone's todo list and for which OS?

I agree that SAGA is a good algorithms box, and it would good for many
users to have it by default, but I wouldn't stop implementing new toolboxes
because SAGA has one strong limitation, IMHO: it needs to read the data
source (as GRASS does) and LOAD it completely in memory. This can be ok in
many cases, but it makes many algorithms unusable if the data are quite
big.
I've tried to run the "clip contest" and I haven't been able to see the
end, because SAGA has reached the maximum RAM the OS could give it, and the
process was taking hours to finish...

In brief, SAGA is nice, but not so robust for many production scenarios.

there is a SAGA package for Windows that does not need installation at
all, just uncompress the package and you are good to go so I guess it
could be easily added to osgeo4w.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with rendering when units are millimeters
Message-ID: <20121214165123.1040a1b23df15dedce69256d@gmail.com>

Hi all,

playing with map rendering I found strange issue: if layer style used
"Millimeters" as unit type, this layers are displayed in QGIS but
don't rendered when performing rendering to image from plugin/console.

Here is minimal script to reproduce this. Add to canvas several
line, point and polygon layers, ensure that style units are
"Millimeters", zoom to some region. Then run script:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
extent = canvas.extent()
for l in canvas.layers():
  layers.append(l.id())
img = QImage(QSize(800, 600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
color = QColor(255, 255, 255)
img.fill(color.rgb())
p = QPainter()
p.begin(img)
render = QgsMapRenderer()
render.setLayerSet(layers)
render.setExtent(extent)
render.setOutputSize(img.size(), img.logicalDpiX())
render.render(p)
p.end()
img.save("/tmp/render_issue.png","png")

Output file will contain only polygonal layer(s), line and points are
not rendered. But when style units changed to "Map units" all works
fine. Same issue exists with labels.

Any ideas what is wrong? Maybe I miss something obvious?

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend group API fix
Message-ID: <20121214170107.GC5177@gnash>

FYI, as of 677095f7911cb0e2af91004cf37dfc988d75eded I changed
the approach by keeping the current (overcomplex IMHO) interpretation
of the integer version of "groupIndex" and simply bending the
return from addGroup to this interpretation (rather than to the
QModelIndex::row() as it's been doing now).

It worked effectively for my case:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6591
And doesn't change any API.

I was thinking that maybe for a next step we could be
using the qint64 "internalId" provided by QModelIndex class:
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/qmodelindex.html#internalId

It would break the ABI, but the API wouldn't be much different
(64bit integer vs. whatever integer you happen to have with "int").
Or, we could cast the qint64 to an int and hope we'll never have
a too large qmodelindex (could we reach that limit in just a legend?).

Anyway, looking forward for Martin refactoring

Hey David,

I think it's a great idea.  Anything that can help the movement of QGIS
into the government sector is a good thing.

I would find it hard to see that we wouldn't want to post it on the site if
it is completed.

Happy to be one of the devs to lead a hand if you need any questions
answered/reviewed.

I have added the qgis-developer list and qgis-psc to the topic as you will
get more people looking over it.

 PSC what are your thoughts?

Regards,
Nathan

Hi all.

Anyone confirms?
Moreover, one strange thing is that the indexes for all rasters are displayed in DB

Should we ask the SAGA developers for their permission then?

There is no need fo permission, but it's a good idea to tell them
about it. Olaf is quite bad at answering emails, and i haven't talked
to him in a while, but I will send him an email and tell him about
this. It might also be a good idea to use the SAGA mailing list...

if line or point layer has style with millimeters as units such
layers are not rendered.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CSV Layers cannot be picked as input in Sextante
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fh3kN9Uw=_oRcvkUDrHEKLFj__7zA5+h_xHaeZ0wCVFrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just finished my join script for Sextante but it isn't as useful as
I would like it to be because I cannot pick CSV files (loaded using
Add Vector Layer) as input.
Can I fix this using a different input definition? Script follows.

On a related note: It's possible to select CSVs loaded using Add
Delimited Text layer. But the join will have only one result. It seems
like provider.nextFeature(inFeat) doesn't work properly in this case.

Best wishes,
Anita

Anita,

You are not using the geometry of the second layer, so instead of a
vector layer, you could define it as a table.

You should replace "##input2=vector" with "#input2=table".

However, you are not going to be able to select vector layers in this
case, just independent csv and dbf files loaded into QGIS. I think I
can solve that by changing the behaviour of SEXTANTE, and allowing it
to consider any vector layer also as a table. There is no reason for
it to be like it is now. If I change that, I will tell you.

Cheers

Victor

Message-ID: <1355621791.65442.YahooMailClassic@web122006.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I'm interested in at least discussing this thread going a step further, with respect to a SpatialLite based file transfer tool for geodata. 

The OGC has mandated many open standards, including SFS, which most spatial databases are predicated on.

It is not that clear to me whether a spec for an Open File Geodatabase would be a fit within the OGC, but I suggest it is a possibility worth considering. 

The OGC has standards for spatial data management, delivery, etc, so one for spatial data file sharing seems well within the mandate.

This would perhaps be a slower & more involved process than simply building one for QGIS, but such a QGIS capability could be built as the reference application.


Such a process would perhaps be OSGEO driven rather than QGIS specific, but obviously could include appropriate QGIS team members.

Any support (or dissent) from those in the QGIS developer/user communities?

Hi Alexander

Seems to be a problem with the python bindings. In C++, the render 
method is:
void QgsMapRenderer::render( QPainter* painter, double* forceWidthScale 
= 0 );

Somehow sip does not like that and forceWidthScale has a funny value 
(also, I cannot call the method with two arguments from python). If I 
change the function in qgsmaprenderer.sip to QgsMapRenderer::render( 
QPainter* painter ), forceWidthScale is 0 and it works.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

thanks for help and clarification. I think we should fix bindings
as you suggest. Any objections?

Seems reasonable to me, committed. Maybe someone has a better fix. On 
the other hand, setting the forced width from python is probably not 
very important (in QGIS, the composer uses it for the preview).

Marco

Message-ID: <CABqTJk8hu8qKuG-6NUXFpbbxj+OPnjO7r9_cVTPxZipAhKBF0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I see some time ago was updated the driver for spatialite.

But as I try to use it I see that really qgis do't allow use the new
splite 4.0 format. :(

It Say-ing simply "obsolete libspatialite, use v4.0".
Surely this is better than before when qgis simply crash brutally.

But I guees perhaps should be better to be capable to use the new 4.0 format. :)

As some test I understand that it wait for a new version of "spatialite.dll".

I try to substitute it with the dll available on the spatialite site,
but it dont seem to be compatible.
Perhaps it use a different compiler.

However, I guess the right solution is to add this library
(spatialite.dll) to the osgeo4w-setup libraries.
Infact actuallly it is not contained in the list of libraries and I
dont know why, so it is impossible to understand what version is
actually hold in that container.

But before open ticket on osgeo4w for ask this update I like to know
if is this correctly the missing operation to be able to use the new
spatialite 4.0 format.

Thx,

Hi Andrea,

AFAIK OSGeo4W has spatialite 3.0.1 and QGIS compiled against this
version. As SL 4.0 databases are incompatible with older library
version you get this message.

Seems spatialite package in OSGeo4W should be updated

I'll give that a try. Thanks!

Is there any way to make Sextante accept CSVs with WKT geometry loaded
using OGR/Add Vector Layer? They currently don't show up in Layer
selectors.

Hi all,
i'm using sextante plugin to develop a new algorithm. I would like to create a 
field as percentage  value (between 5 to 100). 
I'm using this line of code:

self.addParameter(ParameterNumber(MCP.PERCENT, "Percent of fixes", 5, 100, 
95))

but i'm not able to force to limit from 5 to 100 the new inserted number.
Where am i wrong?

Hi,

we have big problems on the server:
 IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device
this is corrupting DB indexes and crashing the plugin site. It's the second
time this week.

I'm thinking about bringing it offline until the problem is resolved.

Hi all.
We should either ask osgeo for more space, or migrate the server.
Whom should be contacted?
All the best.

Hi all,

I've changed the documentation scripts to only generate
en de fr it nl and ru

Every language was about 70 mb, so deleting all those sites freed up 3 
Gb (at the moment I see there is 9.6 G available)

Hopefully this gives us enough space for now to keep the server running.
Sorry for any inconvenience

The above mentioned languages are the languages that I know of that have 
documentation/website translations.
If there are more, of people are serious about starting, let us know and 
we can add your language in the generating scripts (you can still start 
translating because all po files are in github!)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

wordpad. I edited a few things : i setted a path for python (set
PYTHONPATH=C:\OSGeo4W\bin), i put a # before variables regarding windows
server 2003. I put the 2 these following Gdal variables : set
GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Users\Laurent\Gdal_svn
                                           set

I send you by attachment this new text file. According to you, is it valid
or should i make changes before execute it? Should i add the extension .cmd
or .bat ?

Moreover, i opened my svn checkout application and i paste this following

I 'm sceptical because this operation seems very long...I am on the right

Please read the SS reprensenting svn checkout. Maybe I should have done the

Batch files are plain text - use notepad or the visual studio editor (or vim).
RTF won't work for batch files.

You don't need to modify anything.  You can change what you need in cmake-gui
(run from the cmd you started with the batchfile).

You could however add your GDAL include directory to INCLUDE (before
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include) and the directory with your gdal_i.lib to LIB (before
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\lib) and cmake-gui should find it automatically.

Right, that might take a while.

Hi all.
SAGA seems available for OSX also, so no tech problem in integrating it.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multiband grey in master?
Message-ID: <1355837014790-5023753.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
regarding to recent modifications in raster styling [0], I was wondering if
multiband grey is possible in QGIS. 

I usually have topo maps in RGB. It is very handy to switch them to
grayscale styling so that vector overlays are well highlighted. I currently
didn't find how to do this. I can only have grayscale for one band. The
result is not good since red , green or blue band signals are really not
supporting the right info. This is existing in Mapinfo and other softs
seamlessly.
Did I miss something?

Currently that is not possible, AFAIK. I am not sure where it should
go. It may be also useful for color data sources (WMS). In theory it
is possible to add a new filter implementing raster interface and plug
it into the pipe after renderer, but it seems to be overkill too me.
So probably just a new options for multiband color and color data
renderers should be implemented.

Thanks radim for your feedback
Why not 'multiband gray' just like multiband color? It makes sense to me. 
Or maybe some users would rather have a checkbox 'show in grayscale' in multiband color screen. Other opinions?

Just to avoid any confusion: I'm not going to refactor the legend -
though it would be great if someone did refactoring of it - I was just

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SAGA modules (version 2.1.0) through SEXTANTE on
	Mac OSX
Message-ID: <50D19208.1040903@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I managed to successfully get SAGA installed from source on Mac OSX 10.6.8

Since the instructions on the SAGA wiki 
(http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Mac%20OS%20X) 
did not seem to work well in my case, here is what I did:

on a system (in my case OSX 10.6.8) with Xcode 4.2, install:
- PROJ 4.7 (eg from here: http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive - if 
you had PROJ 4.8 installed together with Qgis before, you will need to 
reinstall PROJ 4.8 again after finishing the SAGA install, otherwise 
Qgis will not open anymore)
- GDAL 1.8 (http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive)
- JasPer 1.900.1 ( http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/)
- wxWidgets post-2.9.3 (not needed if SAGA is installed without gui, I 
guess, but I haven't tried)
- at least svn 1.7.x

$ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/saga-gis/code-0/trunk/saga-gis/ 
saga-gis
...
Checked out revision 1574.

$ cd ./saga-gis/
$ autoreconf -i

eg:
$ nano my-saga-config.sh

with this in it:
FEATURES="--enable-unicode --enable-debug --disable-gui"
CXX="/Developer/usr/bin/clang"
DEFINES="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DWXUSINGDLL -D__WXMAC__ -D__WXOSX__ 
-D__WXOSX_COCOA__"
GDAL_H="-I/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Headers"
PROJ_H="-I/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/Headers"
LIB_SRCH="-L/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/unix/lib"
LINK_MISC="-arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot 
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -lstdc++"
./configure $FEATURES CXX="$CXX" CPPFLAGS="$DEFINES $GDAL_H $PROJ_H" 
LDFLAGS="$LIB_SRCH $LINK_MISC"

$ chmod +x my-saga-config.sh
$ ./my-saga-config.sh

$ make

$ sudo make install

$ saga_cmd

Using saga_cmd from the command line on Mac OSX works!


Now the SEXTANTE in Qgis problem..

There is no option "SAGA folder" in the SEXTANTE configuration like you 
have when installing on Windows. I haven't checked on Linux, but I guess 
the Unixes don't need this, as long as saga_cmd is in the path, right?

Opening a SAGA module I get:
It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in your system. Please 
install it before running SAGA algorithms.

Is SAGA in SEXTANTE 1.0.8 maybe not yet compatible with the changes in 
SAGA 2.1.0 ?

Regards,
Olav

Right, Mac and Linux should work in the same way. Let me check,
because maybe in Mac it is performing the same check as in windows
(that is, checking that the SAGA folder is set...)

Looks like an easy to solve problem...i hope

Will keep you posted

Thanks again!

Hi,
?
i am new to the qgis api using?the code examples to get a better understanding.
?
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-code-examples?
?
unfortunately I get a "layer not valid" message for examples 1 and 2.
?
fortunately the TIFF in example 4 does get loaded.
?
so based on ex 4 i added the following lines to example 2:
?
? QString myFileName = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(this, tr("Open File"),
?????????????????????? QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath () ",
?????????????????????? tr("Shape (*.shp)"));
? QFileInfo myVectorFileInfo(myFileName);
? QgsVectorLayer * mypLayer = new QgsVectorLayer(myVectorFileInfo.filePath(), 
????? myVectorFileInfo.completeBaseName());
?
Selecting a shapefile goes well, however I still get the? "layer not valid" message 
?
?
?
In phyton loading a layer is also a problem using?the code in the phyton console of Qgis:

----
layer = QgsVectorLayer("/home/jellema/Documents/A.shp", "layer_name", "ogr")
if not layer.isValid():
print "Layer failed to load!" 
---


However it works fine using:

----
qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer("/home/jellema/Documents/A.shp", "layer_name", "ogr")
----

?
Can somebody give me some isight on what goes wrong?
?
Andre?

Hi all,

anyone works on API (both C++ and Python) cleanup? As I can see there
are about 90 deprecated methods available (for example, look at
QgsRasterLayer class), maybe we have even more, because not all
methods may be marked as deprecated.

Should we remove them? If yes which procedure is correct? 

Thanks

Hey Alex,

I think we should be removing them as I think that is a overall goal for
2.0.  I think we can just remove them.  We should be able to diff the API
docs once 2.0 is out to find out which methods have been added or removed.

That is my thinking anyway.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] error running qgis master - sextante depends on
 psycopg2 - but this dependency isn't well known
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMnMypEVEjrpMytNL88cgJ-JnkrBOjJ3_c3y9GeNW-ECg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I had this problem today with a fresh build (done manually) and
install on a new machine, using today's master.
I am running Linux Mint 14 (Nadia).

Couldn't load plugin 'sextante' from [...]

Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
ImportError: No module named psycopg2

Installing python-psycopg2 fixed the issue.

This should probably be added as a dependency to qgis build process,
or documented, or perhaps even tested in sextante so it doesn't throw
the error?

Regards,
Etienne

Sounds good to me.

I assumed that it would be installed, but it's a better idea to add it
explicitly

I will add a check to SEXTANTE, so in case it is not installed, it
leaves out the algorithms that use it

Thanks!

Ideally it could be a dependency to .deb files (or osgeo/whatever),
and the build notes could include that package.

In any case, perhaps a one-time error window with a QErrorMessage that
psycopg2 is needed for some algorithms.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Back compatibility to Symbols in version <=1.8
	with >=1.9
Message-ID: <CACbtZwQ1qaaRXcWt2bbx5cEurt5Q=SA8j9V8ug4A0zLPDE7DOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Recently the bug #6897 [1] was filed pointing to the incompatibility
between the symbols created before GSoC code and after GSoC code.

The primary matter being incorporating multiple levels of nesting the
symbols. Previous XML structure allowed only a single level of nesting.
This XML structure was modified and the multiple levels now work fine.

However wrt bug #6897, I have noticed, I haven't given a solution for cross
importing the symbols from previous versions to newer versions.

I haven't considered this because the structure conversion was done by the
script [2] that converted the style.xml into the style.db implicitly.

But there might be use cases where style import might happen from older to
newer systems, creating situations like #6897. For the solution I am
thinking of

A. writing a Python script to perform this conversion of XML structuring
alone. And then symbols can be imported using the built-in import function

B. Write a specialized function in C++ into QGIS which will import the old
styles too, making the user to select the type of import.

Which is more preferable?

Hi list

Ok for removing the deprecated methods, but we really need to have a
documented wiki page with a list of deprecated methods and the appropriate
replacement.

Classic use case : you have developed a plugin. After the api break, you
have several warning and error about "this method does not exists" -> hop,
you go to the dedicated web page and you can see which new method to use
instead.

in this moment that page contains only methods no longer
available in current master.
We must to add deprecated methods and their replacement to it
before removing them at all.

Message-ID: <CABqTJk9WPZvwWhv3Pj4V2Gd3Umx9PFtmdPgmQmmqONdusrRWWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

using qgis-server and try-ing this request:

http://web.regione.toscana.it/wmsraster/qgis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=rt_sedimi.qgs&TRANSPARENT=true&MINZOOMLEVEL=0&LAYERS=sedimi%20edilizi&STYLES=&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&SRS=EPSG%3A3003&RANDOM=0.896561631346348&BBOX=1601177.1023587,4780337.1292731,1797446.0200195,4856861.6684127&WIDTH=2316&HEIGHT=903

I'm having an exception because the size is too large.

<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0"><ServiceException code="Size
error">The requested map size is too
large</ServiceException></ServiceExceptionReport>

My question is:
how can an user to know the max allowed size of a map ?

Is this possible.

I guess it is not possible.
If this is true, perhaps the only solution could be to add this
information to this exception response
?

somethink like this:

<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0"><ServiceException code="Size
error">The requested map size is too
large.Max Allowed is 2048 x 1024</ServiceException></ServiceExceptionReport>

Some opinion ?

Message-ID: <CACfnYnRUn9QNVq8YBKeqyuvNHR=c-vZw1mGkS92f_ZhxfmOAPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

during training courses, mainly on Windows machines, many users do
have an issue:

when editing vectors, especially when manually fixing errors like
auto-intersections and duplicate nodes, a lot of leftovers (ie:
symbols representing a deleted node) do remain on the canvas.

Closing the project do not solve the issue, restarting qgis is the only option.

This seems to happen also with the lines that the measure tool creates
on the canvas.

This does not happen on my laptops with Intel graphic card, and maybe
this is related to specific graphic cards/drivers.

anyone noticed it?


cheers

I did notice it but couldn't figure out a way to consistently reproduce.
Could you ? If it has to do with qgis being busy it could be the same 
bug as http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6718

yes, I can replicate it easily on certain computers, and it doesn't
seems to be related to qgis being busy, in fact I can replicate it
just by editing very simple features.

Hi all,

I just pushed to my repo branch api_cleanup [0] where tried to remove
deprecated methods from API (both C++ and Python). Also I add this
methods to wiki page [1]. As I can see all test are passed with this
changes.

Feel free to check and comment. If there are no objections I'll merge
this into master in next few days.

This forum thread has information on build commands for those OSX users that are interested in testing Saga:
http://goo.gl/CIQkB

Unfortunately, Sextante is not working with Saga at the moment. I get this dialog upon trying to test a command:
 It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in your system.
Please install it before running SAGA algorithms.

For my system, 'which saga_cmd' shows '/usr/local/bin/saga_cmd'.

John

It looks like I'm a little late to the party on this. I confirm the same. I look forward to a solution on this for OS X. We can work on grass, perhaps, once that is resolved.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with pyspatialite
Message-ID: <1356040379.25059.YahooMailNeo@web122303.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I was using QGIS master from nightly repository and it had been working well.

Today I have been compiling the version from github and I have a problem with pyspatialite. It was installed before, but now it does not appear in the repositories (Xubuntu 12.04).

Here is the error that appears when installing the compiled version:

dpkg: problemas com depend?ncias impedem a configura??o de python-qgis:
?python-qgis depende de python-pyspatialite; no entanto:
? O pacote python-pyspatialite n?o est? instalado.
dpkg: erro ao processar python-qgis (--install):
?problemas com depend?ncias - a deixar por configurar
A instalar python-qgis-common (1.9.0) ...
(...)
ldconfig deferred processing now taking place
Foram encontrados erros enquanto processava:
?python-qgis


python-qgis appears as "Broken" on Synaptic.


When I start QGIS, some plugins complain about the lack of pyspatialite:

ImportError: No module named pyspatialite



I've also tried to install pyspatialite with pip and easy_install, but without success.

Yes, but only rarely.

This I can repeat fairly consistently. For me, it's much more likely if do something unexpected to the tool, e.g. close it while the measuring string is active.

The GPS Information tool (live tracking) used to leave it's position marker behind when you closed it in 1.7, but doesn't seem to do in 1.8 so maybe that provides some hints?

-ramon.

There is actually the following check in the case of mac and linux:

            command = ["saga_cmd"]
            proc = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True,
stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
stdin=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
universal_newlines=True).stdout
            for line in iter(proc.readline, ""):
                if "________" in line:
                    settings.setValue(SAGA_INSTALLED, True)
                    return
            return "It seems that SAGA is not correctly installed in
your system.\nPlease install it before running SAGA algorithms."

basically, it is a naive check to see if executing saga_cmd in a
console returns something that looks like the SAGA CMD header. It
works fin in linux, but it seems it is not working in Mac. Are you
sure saga is in your path? if so, what do you see when you execute
saga_cmd? maybe the header is different for some reason?

Thanks in advance!

*Regarding the batch file, i paste the text into notepad & i save it as
batch file (.bat)
 Then, i try to run this batch file. A command prompt appears with a message
saying : 'The specified path was not found'.

I send you by attachment the batch file and a SS representing the prompt
command when i execute the batch file.

*Moreover I received a mail from Florian Hillen. I paste it below : 
---------------
/I'm not quite sure if you installed the Microsoft Plaform SDK for Windows
Server 2003 ...
The name is confusing, but you have to install it anyway. See the tutorial
on my website
to find a download link to the SDK and my approach to compile QGIS under
Windows. The
tutorial might be slightly out of date though.
(http://www.florianhillen.de/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=56)
Another remark: GIT is not SVN and you have to download another client
(maybe
TortoiseGIT) to checkout the files.
/
---------------
What to you think about these informations? For information, i don't install 
Microsoft Plaform SDK for Windows Server 2003.

*On my side, i deleted my older svn chechout folder & i'm using this time
git bash for 'capture' the qgis source.  For information, i send you by
attachment also tu SS representing the git interface & the ouptut folder of
the Quantum-GIS.

In advance, thank you very much to throw light for me.

Regards.

Folks,

The QGIS VM should now be up and have more disk space.  Raise a voice
if there is breakage.

Best regards,
Frank

Hi,

I solved installing python-pyspatialite from

http://pkgs.org/debian-wheezy/debian-main-i386/python-pyspatialite_3.0.1-2_i386.deb/download/?


Thanks,
Pedro




----- Original Message -----
From: Pedro Ven?ncio 

Hi,

I was using QGIS master from nightly repository and it had been working well.

Today I have been compiling the version from github and I have a problem with pyspatialite. It was installed before, but now it does not appear in the repositories (Xubuntu 12.04).

Here is the error that appears when installing the compiled version:

dpkg: problemas com depend?ncias impedem a configura??o de python-qgis:
?python-qgis depende de python-pyspatialite; no entanto:
? O pacote python-pyspatialite n?o est? instalado.
dpkg: erro ao processar python-qgis (--install):
?problemas com depend?ncias - a deixar por configurar
A instalar python-qgis-common (1.9.0) ...
(...)
ldconfig deferred processing now taking place
Foram encontrados erros enquanto processava:
?python-qgis


python-qgis appears as "Broken" on Synaptic.


When I start QGIS, some plugins complain about the lack of pyspatialite:

ImportError: No module named pyspatialite



I've also tried to install pyspatialite with pip and easy_install, but without success.

Folks,

The OSU OSL folks are taking the QGIS VM down very soon
to 10-30 minutes to grow the disk partition.  This will affect
hub.qgis.org and possible some other services.

Hmm, skimming the QGIS notes at:

  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status#QGIS

It seems to me it would be helpful to flesh out that
description and/or point to more information including
who the primary contacts are responsible for administering
this VM.  For me Alex and Jurgen come to mind but I
don't know who else is involved or most appropriate as
a contact.

Best regards,

Your "just like" means a lot of work: new GUI widget, new renderer,
support for this new renderer in raster layer (save restor in/from
project), in renderers registry, in raster layer properties etc.
Technically the renderer would be still multiband color but with
additional grayscale mode flag, but still, it is enough work to do. On
the contrary, to add grayscale flag to multiband color renderer and
widget is easy, because it is only limited to those two classes.

Note also, that the values must first be converted to RGB and then to
grayscale, so all to options for stretching of individual bands must
be there.

In addition, for images which are not in RGB true colors, a user
should have a possibility to tune first bands selection and contrast
enhancement with colors and once the colors are tuned, switch to
grayscale.

It may also be be handy to switch to grayscale and back, according to
situation, without a necessity to change renderer. This could be
useful even for single band pseudocolor and paletted. So it seems
useful for all renderers apart single band gray.

Hi Radim, 
OK , I had no idea of underlying work. Flag option sounds good too, maybe
better in fact. 
Thanks for your feedback. I keep that in mind, tell me if any support is
required.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsGeometry.fromWkt fails if WKT contains SRID
Message-ID: <50D48A06.8070708@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I want to get a QgsGeometry from the following string, produced by PostGIS:

/SRID=21781;LINESTRING(749566.243 264032.415,749589.521 264042.261)//
/
/QgsGeometry.fromWkt/ returns NULL, because /GEOSWKTReader_read/ throws 
an exception
(ParseException: Unknown type: 'SRID=21781;POLYGON')

What is the proper way to handle this:
- Open an issue upstream to fix it at GEOS level?
- Strip the SRID part from the WKT before calling GEOSWKTReader_read?
- Anything else?

Regards,
Matthias

I mixed up the geometry and error message (Polygon and LineString). It 
failed with both.

Investigating the problem a bit reveals that including an SRID in the 
WKT is actually EWKT, a postgis format [0].

I think QgsGeometry does not support this so far (at least there is no 
occurence of EWKT in qgsgeometry.cpp)?

I see two solutions: change the postgres provider to read WKT instead of 
EWKT for subsequent geometry columns, or teach QgsGeometry to understand 
EWKT (preferred IMHO).

Any opinions on this?

Matthias

A quick and dirty circumvention of the check is to change line 373 in 
~/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante/saga/SagaAlgorithm.py
to:
if "" in line:
(restart Qgis)

this way the modules do open since the check is basically disabled.
The original code should also though. Maybe it's encoding related.
When I execute a Saga module, this happens during saving the output:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File 
"/Users/myaccount/.qgis//python/plugins/sextante/gui/OutputSelectionPanel.py", 
line 95, in saveToFile
     self.text.setText(str(filename))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xff' in 
position 2: ordinal not in range(128)

Should I have compiled with a different locale set?

We are nearly there :-)

are you using the latest sextante version ? From your traceback it seem not.
line 95 [1] has been changed !

Unfortunately, that's an annoying error that affects several tools (much
less now) in sextante when non-ascii chars are used !

Hi Salvatore,
I'm on version 1.0.8 installed through the Python Plugin Installer.
I guess these latest changes on github have not yet made into the 
packaged version...
I will try again with sextante from source... tomorrow ;-)

Or simply strip of the SRID, if you want to feed it into fromWkt.   The SRID
isn't kept in QgsGeometry anyway.

Message-ID: <1C511E5267397545A5DEB325F5FA8BBC0190BD26C5@exchpd01>

I have R installed in C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\bin and created R_PATH in
Window environment setting.  I have tested the setting by calling R in DOS
prompt and it work properly.  It is the i386 version.  I also changed the
configuration of R folder in SEXTANTE to C:\Program
Files\R\R-2.15.2\bin\i386.  When I run the Raster Histogram module of R
within SEXTANTE the output was blank.  Below is the History and Info log of
SEXTANTE:

There are two things which seem not correct.  First the R installs in my
computer is version 2.15.2 and not version 2.14.1 and I have very sure I
have rgdal install because I have tested the same script using R GUI
directly.

It would be very much appreciated if someone can advise me how to solve this
problem.

Thanks in advance.

You have 2.15 installed, but the one that is called from SEXTANTE is
2.14. Strange. You might have it installed somewhere else, and somehow
SEXTANTE is calling it.

I guess that path with blank spaces might be problematic. Maybe try to
install in a path with no blank spaces, and configure SEXTANTE to take
R from there...

That might also be causing the problem with the packages. Probably
they are installed where they should not be installed, and then the
library() command doesn't work. Maybe someone with better knowledge of
R can confirm this...

Victor

Hi Victor, many thanks for the prompt reply.

What do you mean by "I guess that path with blank spaces might be problematic."?  Please kindly enlighten me.

Message-ID: <c152be8d2826ce5a707fcacced86b58d@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I upgraded my server from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS. I recompiled 
 QGIS server with the new qt and JPEG?libraries and the compile and 
 install went fine. However, since the upgrade, QGIS server cannot read 
 and write JPEG files anymore. QGIS?server crashes whenever the source 
 (WMS) or the output involves a JPEG?read or write. This is regardless of 
 the input raster source (could be TIFF?or WMS). PNG and PNG8bit output 
 seems to work fine.

 I googled for qt and JPEG problems, but could not find much that 
 sounded similar to my problem.

 Using ldd I?saw that qgis_mapserv.fcgi is linked against libjpeg.so.8 - 
 is this a problem? Should it be linked against libjpeg.so.62?

 Thank you if you have any idea about my problem.

 Andreas

Hi Andreas

I'm using 12.04 as well and it works for me with qgis_mapserv.fcgi 
linked against libjpeg.so.8

Could you check, if you have Qt's jpeg plugin installed 
(/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so) ? It is 
contained in the package libqtgui4 and linked against libjpeg.so.8 too.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] The Xmas bug report
Message-ID: <CACfnYnRNDZOkjzZGh9SkiXbhbF6Xg-3XWRaBpMxCPm4Eb=F51Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There are 30 blockers (regressions)

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23

A few of them need confirmation and others do have a patch to be
committed, but the rest is confirmed,

In the next weeks/months of testing I would like to have the
permission to tag as blockers also the new features that are not
working as expected (so are not strictly regressions): I would like to
minimize the risk to ship new, broken, features.



There are 39 tickets tagged "causes crash or data corruption"

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=27

but 6 of them belong also to the "blockers" list.

As before, probably a few of them can be closed as already fixed or
invalid, but most of them are good.



There are 40 tickets with a patch attached

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=32

3 of them belong to the "blockers" list and 4 of them belongs to the
"causes crash or data corruption" list.

While a few patches in the bug tracker seem outdated, there are a lot
that are pretty recent and deserving a look from the devs as they
potentially fix many papercuts and also serious issues.


Regarding the switch from old labelling/symbology to the new engines,
there are still a few unresolved issues, as usual the (detailed)
resume of what is missing is here

 Hi Marco,

 Thank you for your reply.

 I checked that this file is present - and yes - it also links against 
 libjpeg.so.8.

 The webserver error log also has Xserver errors like:

 Xlib:  extension "XInputExtension" missing on display ":999".

 but I am not sure this is the cause for the crash. I am using vnc 
 server as a local X-Server. I also get thie Xlib error when the PNG 
 version displays successfully.

 I guess I would have to build a debug version and see where it crashes.

 Andreas

Hi all, 
I'm observing that education starts to be a really common use case for qgis.
See French government app  here 
http://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/edugeo-mini-sig-an-application-for-educational-purposes/
<http://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/edugeo-mini-sig-an-application-for-educational-purposes/>  

Maybe sharing experiences and code of all GIS educational apps and courses
could be a good idea. 

Cheers
R?gis

 Hi again,

 Here is what I got as output from gdb:

 Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
 0x00007ffff6393b7c in jpeg_CreateDecompress (cinfo=0xba4768, 
 version=80, structsize=656) at libjpeg/jdapimin.c:37
 37          ERREXIT2(cinfo, JERR_BAD_LIB_VERSION, JPEG_LIB_VERSION, 
 version);


 so it seems there is a bad JPEG library used by QGIS?server?


 Any ideas what is wrong with my system?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hi all and sorry for cross-posting,

we (NextGIS) are pleased to announce QTiles plugin for QGIS.

QTiles designed to generate raster tiles from QGIS projects according
to the Slippy Map specification [0] and supports two output types:
directory and ZIP-archive.

You can get plugin from official repo (don't forget to enable
experimental plugins). Comments and bugreports are welcome.

Merry Christmas and happy New Year!

 Hi,

 I could fix the problem.

 Somehow it had to do with my self-compiled gdal library. When i changed 
 from JPEG=internal to JPEG=external QGIS server suddenly worked again 
 with reading and writing JPEG data. Strange - but it helped. Maybe it 
 helps for someone who runs into similar problems ...

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Convert core plugins into core features
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-s3tnoMfULfcWXz8OWp5hp6ehsNtpgLFqV_5a1AAd4Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

What are peoples thoughts about making some of the core plugins into core
features of QGIS.  To me I think that most of the core plugins would be
great additions into the core feature set of QGIS.  Some of the advantages
for me would be:


   - Allow us to give some of the excellent features a C++ and Python API.
   - API could be used by standalone QGIS applications not just QGIS
   Desktop.  Currently if I build a standalone QGIS application using the
   Python libs I can't get access to the core plugins and the functions that
   they hold.
   - More visibility - some users don't even know about the offline plugin,
   or delimited text plugin
   - Always on features.  Things such as raster interpolation, delimited
   text support, topology, should be built in features not have a add on feel.
   - Python API can be used with Sextante

I think the plugin system makes a lot of sense for user contributed
plugins, and in fact this is quite an attractive feature of QGIS, however I
don't think core plugins make much sense. Unlike the user contributed
plugins core plugins are on the same build and release cycle as the main
core application so the user doesn't get them any faster or easier.
Things like the functions being built into the topology plugin [0] should
be core functions of QGIS itself.

I can see some merit in having core plugins for testing purpose, or for a
staging ground with possible new features during a release cycle, however I
don't see much use for them outside of that.

I would like to propose that we move, over time of course, most of the core
plugins into the core feature set itself and discourage core plugin
building.

Hey!

Many good points.
And fully agree .. "core plugins" sounds like a testbed for functions
that have to be tested before integrating them into core itself..
Plugins are Plugins and although we should test them too before
providing a plugin is always an extra work to be installed.
So beside the things you already pointed out I would also vote for
integrating cpp "plugins" that are "common" functions into core (well
basically they are already integrated - but called plugins ;) )
IMHO that leads into some GUI redesign (which is always on the move) but
we should think about where to put this things (SEXTANTE?) AND ..
personally I'd like to get rid of all the "space taking" icons that
appear whenever I download/activate a new plugin.
Would it make sense to ask the user if he wants an icon somewhere or
just have the function in the menu?

Furthermore that leads me to "user defined function bars" .. I'd like to
create a bar (is it called like that?) with my own defined
functions/icons that is the only bar that appears on the Desktop. Do you
think this is possible to do?

kind regards and merry christmas (I know I am late)

I agree that moving plugins (well not plugins, but their functions)
into core libraries will be good. This allows to access some
functions via API (Python/C++) and don't reimplement already
available algorithms.

This also allow us remove some icons from toolbars, because some
algorithms can be called then from SEXTANTE instead of creating
separate dialog.

	slots?
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-4k5iGWMaRQf0wwtVH3EVVRHw-RBqGHEHwn074zCO5FQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to move the following private slots in qgisapp.h [0] to
public slots:

    // older slots
    void toggleEditing();
    bool toggleEditing( QgsMapLayer *layer, bool allowCancel = true );
    void saveEdits( QgsMapLayer *layer, bool leaveEditable = true );

    // ones I recently added
    void cancelEdits( QgsMapLayer *layer, bool leaveEditable = true );
    void saveEdits();
    void saveAllEdits( bool verifyAction = true );
    void rollbackEdits();
    void rollbackAllEdits( bool verifyAction = true );
    void cancelEdits();
    void cancelAllEdits( bool verifyAction = true );

This would be to allow better access from other dialogs, not just from
the main window interface. This would also allow calling them directly
without requiring a signal/slot or QMetaObject setup. It will also
help fix a bug [1] (see two variations on fix here [2]).

Is there a reason these slots should stay private?

Also, why are so many slots in QgisApp private? (There may be other
slots that make sense to move to public.)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Vector API
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcb6hLDCh7ekN2j3Mw23OPviMJvoT+LiCt6dbvP+ZZGig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

it seems that now it is a good time to ask for a broader review of the
work I have been doing during recent months: essentially making QGIS
vector API more flexible and more ready for introduction of threading
for rendering. That resulted in a greater refactoring of some parts of
QgsVectorLayer class and QgsVectorDataProvider implementations.
Everything is in new_vector_api branch in QGIS repository on GitHub
[1].

There are few things that are not finished, but should not take too
much work to sort out:
- disabled providers - mssql, osm, sqlanywhere, wfs - not yet updated to new API
- disabled mapserver - there are few things to update

If no serious problems will be found, I would like to merge the branch
to master and continue working on that on master branch to avoid the
possibility to drift (again) too much from the quick development that
happens on master. In short term I plan to do some polishing and
fixing bugs, then eventually start looking at the threading again.

For more details about what happened in the branch, see the text below
(long read!). A great help from early testers would be to compile the
branch, try to do some "usual" stuff with vectors and see if things
break apart (crashes? data corruption?).

Looking forward to your comments!

Regards
Martin

[1] https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/tree/new_vector_api



QGIS VECTOR API CHANGES

1. QgsFeature (changes)

a) access to attributes by name. Vector data providers and vector
layer assign pointer to the fields in QgsFeature, so it is possible to
set/get attributes by their name. This is not as efficient as with
direct access by index, but often this convenience is useful for
users.

b) attributes are stored in a QVector container rather than a QMap.
The major advantage is simplification of logic related to handling of
attributes: it's not possible to have "holes" in the array of
fields/attributes. Currently it is possible that for example layer
with three fields returns indexes 0,1,3 - but it is not so common nor
obvious, so it's a common source of errors. After refactoring there
must not be any holes, so a layer with three fields always returns
indexes 0,1,2. When iterating over layer's features, QgsFeature always
contains a vector of all layer's attributes. In case the client has
not requested attributes to be fetched, the attributes contain invalid
values.


2. QgsFields (new class)

Just like attributes within a feature are stored in a vector instead
of map, also layer's fields are now stored in a vector. QgsFields is a
new class that mimics QVector API and adds two more pieces of
functionality:

a) fast lookup of field index from name. When QgsFields is populated
with fields, it creates a map of fields that facilitates fast lookups

b) detection of field origin. When working with a vector layer, it is
sometimes useful to find out origin of the field - whether it comes
from provider, from a join or whether it is a newly added field (not
committed). In the future we could add also expression-based fields,
creating a field calculator that calculates the values on the fly.


3. QgsFeatureRequest (new class)

Class that encapsulates requests for features to a vector layer or
vector data provider. Right now in master branch, the request is
defined by arguments to select() method. That's not very flexible nor
simple to use. Feature request class allows easier extensibility in
future (support generic expression filter, native provider's SQL
filter...).

Without any customization, the request will ask for all features with
geometries and attributes - somehow better default that the current
one that does not fetch attributes if their list is not explicitly
given.

(I'm not yet completely happy with the API of this class, so it may be
changed to some degree. Suggestions are welcome.)

Examples:
- fetch all features:
    QgsFeatureRequest()
- fetch all features, only one attribute
    QgsFeatureRequest().setSubsetOfAttributes(QStringList("myfield"),
provider->fields())
- fetch all features, without geometries
    QgsFeatureRequest().setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest::NoGeometry)
- fetch only features from particular extent
    QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(QgsRectangle(0,0,1,1))
- fetch only one feature
    QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(45)



4. QgsFeatureIterator (new class)

The iterator class allows iteration over features of a vector layer or
a provider. It contains the usual nextFeature() method that fills
given QgsFeature class with data.

Internally, this class is a wrapper around QgsAbstractFeatureIterator
interface that is implemented by each vector data provider and by
vector layer. In theory we could use directly
QgsAbstractFeatureIterator pointers, but this wrapper allows us to use
it as a local variable, so it gets destroyed automatically when it
gets out of scope, not requiring an explicit "delete" call that would
be necessary with a pointer (easy to forget, right?)


5. Access to features

Vector layer and providers implement one important method call:
getFeatures(). It takes single argument (QgsFeatureRequest) and
returns QgsFeatureIterator. This replaces select(), nextFeature(),
rewind() and featureAtId() methods.

This approach allows users to create multiple iterators over a vector
layer (or a vector data provider). But currently that's not supported
because this needs support in the providers. At some point, we could
add support for simultaneous iterators - something that old API does
not allow at all.

When QgsFeatureIterator instance of a particular layer is closed (by
calling close() or destructed), then a new getFeatures() call may be
issued.


6. QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer (new class)

All editing functionality of vector layer has been moved out of
QgsVectorLayer into a new class that stores everything related to
editing: added features, removed features, changed geometries, changed
attribute values, added attributes, removed attributes. This class is
accessible from QgsVectorLayer, but it exists only when the layer is
in editing mode - it is deleted once features are rolled back or
committed.

The undo/redo support has been completely rewritten and greatly
simplified: instead of one undo command that gathers changes within
the edit buffer, there is now one undo command implementation for each
action. The undo commands can be grouped together with QUndoStack
macros. The new implementation ensures that the undo stack does not
get out of sync, because all editing changes are stored onto undo
stack (unlike current implementation in master branch where
begin/end-UndoCommand() methods must be called before/after edit
operations to ensure correct behavior of undo).


7. QgsVectorLayerEditUtils (new class)

Advanced editing operations that operate on vector layers (e.g. add
part) that can be composed from one or more simple edit operations
have been moved out of QgsVectorLayer and its edit buffer, so that the
vector layer API is not polluted by methods that do not need access to
its private members.


8. QgsVectorLayerCache (new class)

To speed up geometry editing, QGIS keeps a cache of geometries
currently shown in map canvas. This cache has been decoupled from
editing operations and moved to a separate class to keep things tidy.
In the future we should be able to add more general caching scheme to
allow faster rendering of vectors. Also, this might be a good place to
store index of feature ID -> row number that is calculated every time
when attribute table is opened.


9. Python

Python API has been updated to support functionality from the points
above, that is access by attribute name and support for python
iterators, e.g.:

for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
  print feature["road_id"]

Hi Martin, 
all this looks great! I really had troubles with FieldMap and vector
handling in python plugin developpement. I really appriciate that step
towards more usability for basic plugin developpers.  Ready for testing and
correcting some plugins of course.
 Some classes were removed some days ago and many plugins are already
broken. From my point of view, it is a good timing for merging your branch,
before qe spend to much efforts on correcting them. (And I stick with
osgeo4w for testing, so it's hard to test your branch otherwirse ;-))

Hello,

As you know, gdal 1.10 will release as version stable 2012/12/31. Could you
tell me when gdal 1.10 will be available and selectable with qgis 1.8 (via
osgeo4w for instance) ?

Thank you to throw light for me.

With kind regards.

I haven't tested with SpatiaLite 4 yet. I've just committed a quick
fix that _may_ fix your problems, but there may be more of them -
please let me know in that case, I will try to compile QGIS with
SpatiaLite 4 to fix the remaining problems.

Hi Martin

Cool, great news! Can't wait to try out the new vector classes. I'm away from the computer until 4th of January. Probably other core devs are out of contact too, so please make the review period long enough.

Regards, Marco



Von Samsung Galaxy Note gesendetMartin Dobias <wonder.sk at gmail.com> hat geschrieben:Hi everyone,

it seems that now it is a good time to ask for a broader review of the
work I have been doing during recent months: essentially making QGIS
vector API more flexible and more ready for introduction of threading
for rendering. That resulted in a greater refactoring of some parts of
QgsVectorLayer class and QgsVectorDataProvider implementations.
Everything is in new_vector_api branch in QGIS repository on GitHub
[1].

There are few things that are not finished, but should not take too
much work to sort out:
- disabled providers - mssql, osm, sqlanywhere, wfs - not yet updated to new API
- disabled mapserver - there are few things to update

If no serious problems will be found, I would like to merge the branch
to master and continue working on that on master branch to avoid the
possibility to drift (again) too much from the quick development that
happens on master. In short term I plan to do some polishing and
fixing bugs, then eventually start looking at the threading again.

For more details about what happened in the branch, see the text below
(long read!). A great help from early testers would be to compile the
branch, try to do some "usual" stuff with vectors and see if things
break apart (crashes? data corruption?).

Looking forward to your comments!

Regards
Martin

QGIS VECTOR API CHANGES

1. QgsFeature (changes)

a) access to attributes by name. Vector data providers and vector
layer assign pointer to the fields in QgsFeature, so it is possible to
set/get attributes by their name. This is not as efficient as with
direct access by index, but often this convenience is useful for
users.

b) attributes are stored in a QVector container rather than a QMap.
The major advantage is simplification of logic related to handling of
attributes: it's not possible to have "holes" in the array of
fields/attributes. Currently it is possible that for example layer
with three fields returns indexes 0,1,3 - but it is not so common nor
obvious, so it's a common source of errors. After refactoring there
must not be any holes, so a layer with three fields always returns
indexes 0,1,2. When iterating over layer's features, QgsFeature always
contains a vector of all layer's attributes. In case the client has
not requested attributes to be fetched, the attributes contain invalid
values.


2. QgsFields (new class)

Just like attributes within a feature are stored in a vector instead
of map, also layer's fields are now stored in a vector. QgsFields is a
new class that mimics QVector API and adds two more pieces of
functionality:

a) fast lookup of field index from name. When QgsFields is populated
with fields, it creates a map of fields that facilitates fast lookups

b) detection of field origin. When working with a vector layer, it is
sometimes useful to find out origin of the field - whether it comes
from provider, from a join or whether it is a newly added field (not
committed). In the future we could add also expression-based fields,
creating a field calculator that calculates the values on the fly.


3. QgsFeatureRequest (new class)

Class that encapsulates requests for features to a vector layer or
vector data provider. Right now in master branch, the request is
defined by arguments to select() method. That's not very flexible nor
simple to use. Feature request class allows easier extensibility in
future (support generic expression filter, native provider's SQL
filter...).

Without any customization, the request will ask for all features with
geometries and attributes - somehow better default that the current
one that does not fetch attributes if their list is not explicitly
given.

(I'm not yet completely happy with the API of this class, so it may be
changed to some degree. Suggestions are welcome.)

Examples:
- fetch all features:
??? QgsFeatureRequest()
- fetch all features, only one attribute
??? QgsFeatureRequest().setSubsetOfAttributes(QStringList("myfield"),
provider->fields())
- fetch all features, without geometries
??? QgsFeatureRequest().setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest::NoGeometry)
- fetch only features from particular extent
??? QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect(QgsRectangle(0,0,1,1))
- fetch only one feature
??? QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(45)



4. QgsFeatureIterator (new class)

The iterator class allows iteration over features of a vector layer or
a provider. It contains the usual nextFeature() method that fills
given QgsFeature class with data.

Internally, this class is a wrapper around QgsAbstractFeatureIterator
interface that is implemented by each vector data provider and by
vector layer. In theory we could use directly
QgsAbstractFeatureIterator pointers, but this wrapper allows us to use
it as a local variable, so it gets destroyed automatically when it
gets out of scope, not requiring an explicit "delete" call that would
be necessary with a pointer (easy to forget, right?)


5. Access to features

Vector layer and providers implement one important method call:
getFeatures(). It takes single argument (QgsFeatureRequest) and
returns QgsFeatureIterator. This replaces select(), nextFeature(),
rewind() and featureAtId() methods.

This approach allows users to create multiple iterators over a vector
layer (or a vector data provider). But currently that's not supported
because this needs support in the providers. At some point, we could
add support for simultaneous iterators - something that old API does
not allow at all.

When QgsFeatureIterator instance of a particular layer is closed (by
calling close() or destructed), then a new getFeatures() call may be
issued.


6. QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer (new class)

All editing functionality of vector layer has been moved out of
QgsVectorLayer into a new class that stores everything related to
editing: added features, removed features, changed geometries, changed
attribute values, added attributes, removed attributes. This class is
accessible from QgsVectorLayer, but it exists only when the layer is
in editing mode - it is deleted once features are rolled back or
committed.

The undo/redo support has been completely rewritten and greatly
simplified: instead of one undo command that gathers changes within
the edit buffer, there is now one undo command implementation for each
action. The undo commands can be grouped together with QUndoStack
macros. The new implementation ensures that the undo stack does not
get out of sync, because all editing changes are stored onto undo
stack (unlike current implementation in master branch where
begin/end-UndoCommand() methods must be called before/after edit
operations to ensure correct behavior of undo).


7. QgsVectorLayerEditUtils (new class)

Advanced editing operations that operate on vector layers (e.g. add
part) that can be composed from one or more simple edit operations
have been moved out of QgsVectorLayer and its edit buffer, so that the
vector layer API is not polluted by methods that do not need access to
its private members.


8. QgsVectorLayerCache (new class)

To speed up geometry editing, QGIS keeps a cache of geometries
currently shown in map canvas. This cache has been decoupled from
editing operations and moved to a separate class to keep things tidy.
In the future we should be able to add more general caching scheme to
allow faster rendering of vectors. Also, this might be a good place to
store index of feature ID -> row number that is calculated every time
when attribute table is opened.


9. Python

Python API has been updated to support functionality from the points
above, that is access by attribute name and support for python
iterators, e.g.:

for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
? print feature["road_id"]

Subject: [Qgis-developer] HomeRange plugin: future development plans
Message-ID: <20121230122745.344da4eb@galadriel.localdomain>

Hello all and sorry for cross-posting,

This announcement is oriented to developers, but also to users who wish
to support HR plugin in the future.

many years have passed since first release of HomeRange plugin, and now
the code needs significant restructuring, as underlying libraries have
changed much since 2008.

A quite detailed plan for development is available here:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/HomeRange_plugin#Future-development-of-core-functions

It can be fitted in a Google Summer of Code project, that will take
place in May-September 2013, or any time from now by a developer
(please speak up if you wish to start a bid/pledge for it, so that
we avoid clashes).
As for myself, I am sadly not available to work on it in the near
future.

Note: there is an alternate plugin being developed as SEXTANTE module
here:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/sextante_animove/
Please test it and send feedback.

Many thanks for your support so far, and best wishes for a happy 2013!

Anne

This is probably the best gift given out this christmas : )

Alexander, quick question, does QTiles render the tiles in the CRS defined
by the project, or does it automatically switches to the Google Mercator?

Best,

Math

Alex, alright, should have looked at the source code before asking
something that could be answered quite easily. :)

Few comments and observations after playing with the plugin this morning:
- QTiles currently renders tiles without applying antialiasing, resulting
in jagged lines. IMO, disabling antialiasing should be optional, maybe
through a checkbox in the rendering option window. I've enabled
antialiasing by adding painter.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing) below
line 167 in titlingthread.py
- The tile background color is hardcoded to be white (line 165,
titlingthread.py); it might be better to take the background color from the
project's background color setting? The project I used to test out QTiles
has a gray background color set through the project settings, and the
QTiles white background got me going "huh?" for a minute :)
- As it stands, the labelling rendering is kind of a mess. I understand
this isn't something that can be fixed at the QTiles level. Might be worth
coordinating with Larry Shafter to see whether there are quick fixes that
could be applied to improve things.
- To take care of some of the label cut-off, would it be possible for you
to not only render the 256x256 tile, but instead do something like this:
render a 3 x 3 matrix of 256 x 256 tiles, and save only the central 256 x
256 region as the PNG tile. It wouldn't take care of all label issues, but
it'd help reduce it.
- One other thing that could be done at the QTiles level is to warn users
when it detects that polygon layer(s) are using "most problematic"
labelling settings (i.e. I'm thinking here of relying on centroid of
visible polygon centroid, which results in labels duplicated many, many
times for each tiles with big polygons, such as provincial / district
boundaries)

Other than that, I'm loving it more and more ;)

One more thing, it would be very useful to offer users the possibility of
having transparent background (i.e. no white or project setting background
filling color).

Hi everybody,
I have never setup the build evnironment to produce PDFs from Sphinx.
Before undertaking the long path to its setup, I wondered if there was
already a PDF built version of the Cookbook available for download.

besides the name, I think waiting until after the merge, and the subsequent fixes,
could delay a release for a long time.
all the best.

I believe a fix for this is to implement this suggested feature (see [0]):

"Add option to have boundaries of map canvas's current extent act as
obstacles to labels (suggested by Tim Sutton)"

Starting in January, I will be focusing on labeling fixes and features
for 2.0, and this is one of the items I think should make it into that
release, especially when it comes to the benefits for tiling. PAL
offers the ability to have features act as obstacles, which should
allow such a function to be implemented with extent-based temporary
features, with a user-defined buffer distance towards the interior of
the rendering.

Another approach is to shrink the extent rect that is used to clip the
temporary geometries sent to PAL. That may result in less labels (not
tested, though).

With the advent of QTiles, and assuming generators for other formats
(mbtiles? [1]) maybe be forthcoming, I will look at implementing this
as soon as possible.

Regards,

Larry
