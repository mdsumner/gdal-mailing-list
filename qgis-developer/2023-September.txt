Hi all,

 This week, Tim and I created new tasks for me to work on. We started with
the oldest open issues. You can check my project board
<http://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/projects/4#card-90159349>, and
if you think that something else should be there, please let me know.
Considering that those issues have been open for too long and some of them
are not quite clear to me at first sight, I spent most of my time this week
trying to figure out what needs to be done and I think I'm ready for next
week.

Anyways, here are PRs that are still open:

   - "Add GIS File" action (Metasearch plugin)
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8491>
   - Updated screenshots for Module 10. Online Resources (Training Manual)
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8483>
   - Policy choice added in the Layer Properties
   <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8447>

Pull requests that are merged this week:

   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8489
   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8462
   - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8441

Have a nice weekend,
Selma.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Mesh netcdf NaN visualisation in QGIS?
Message-ID: <d0c9e8656b46ab29b3d034e2a97fcdb5@duif.net>

Hi,

My colleague is creating netcdf as output of some other modelling 
software, and viewing/styling it in QGIS.

In some places the modelling software goes awry and produces NaN's in de 
netcdf.

Anybody an idea to create a visualisation (in QGIS) to find out WHICH 
part/cell's contain a NaN?

output of ncdump:
   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0, 0,?
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NaNf, NaNf, NaNf, 0, 
0,?
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0,?
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0,?
     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Found: 
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL/blob/master/mdal/frmts/mdal_netcdf.cpp#L100-L102

So apparently in MDAL this becomes 
"std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN"

But how to find these in QGIS?

Looking in Layer Styling I could use non-numbes (like None, NaN or 
whatever) in the inputs.
Same in Mesh calculator.

Any idea appreciated!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Are you also able to load data via the GDAL driver?
If so you could then try to show nodata using raster styling.

e.g.: make sure that Nodata is not set to transparent: go to the 
raster's layer properties -> transparency, untick nodata value.
Then style in symbology settings.

Best regards,
Aron

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Aggregate (GUI) - Load fields from layer
Message-ID: <5a602c5cc01076b8292d5e742fbbaecd@posteo.de>

Hi,

the processing tool "Aggregate"

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#aggregate

offers to "Load fields from layer" which according to the docs has the 
purpose "You can load fields from another layer and use them for the 
aggregation".

Is this supposed to use then also the values from another layer?

Asking because it currently only loads the field name/type but doesn't 
use the values.

Cheers,
Bj?rn

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MingW64 Windows 64bit Build action failing: a
 possible workaround
Message-ID: <04a8cfac-469a-4f4b-ab41-0dcbf3b919ef@libero.it>

Hi devs,
the MingW64 Windows 64bit Build action is continuously failing since a 
couple of days with the following error:

/usr/bin/mingw64-cmake: line 92: fg: no job control

The issue is caused by the %__cmake macro not correctly evaluated and 
misinterpreted.

A possible workaround, which I've tested and which makes the action no 
longer fail and the build succeed, would be to change line 79 of 
/ms-windows/mingw/build.sh from

   mingw$bits-cmake \

to

   rpm --eval "%{mingw64_cmake}" > mingw64-cmake.sh
   sed -i -e 's/%__cmake/cmake/' mingw64-cmake.sh
   chmod +x mingw64-cmake.sh
   ./mingw$bits-cmake.sh \


See 
https://gitlab.gnome.org/TinyTrebuchet/gtk/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml#L156-158

It's not clear to me what actually triggered the issue, so very likely 
there is a better fix.

Best regards.

Andrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] My own LayoutItem not getting rendered unless ...
Message-ID: <bac5bec2-0579-2d6c-e2c3-0c9990418c4a@terglobo.nl>

Hi,

For a plugin I made my own type of layoutItem which renders some kind of 
special graph. However, when the code adds the item to a layout, the 
rectangle is there but the content does not get rendered.

Now when I run this line in the console:

layout_manager = QgsProject.instance().layoutManager()

the layout item does get rendered, and also every next layout works 
properly. I put the line of code just above my layout item's class 
definition and it solves the problem. But I'd like to know if this is 
the right approach and why this line of code is needed. (Or if this is a 
bug?)

Thanks!

Raymond

 of QML file
Message-ID: <f17b1b76-5db8-4ad9-a67e-6b8b20dff781@mail.shortwave.com>

I am trying to load a style from a QML file into a vector layer.

When I use a memory layer, loading the style works fine with the following code:

layer = iface.activeLayer()
layer.loadNamedStyle(path_to_style)

If the layer is a postgreSQL layer with a default style, the above code will return:

('Loaded from provider', True)

and the style from the QML won't be loaded. The way to force it was add a True parameter in the end of the method call:

layer = iface.activeLayer()
layer.loadNamedStyle(path_to_style, True)

Not sure if this is the correct behavior, but it does not match with the documentation:

https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayer.html#a8b271b8bf3074e84808cff26f722b26f <https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayer.html#a8b271b8bf3074e84808cff26f722b26f>

Hi Alexandre,

When the layer is a PostgreSQL layer, it's the method from 
QgsVectorLayer which is called:

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.32/core/QgsVectorLayer.html#qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer.loadNamedStyle

https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html#a2bd3a21badac411179dbfbc724136a45


The documentation is somewhat incomplete, as "loadFromLocalDb" boolean 
set to true will in fact call QgsMapLayer::loadNamedStyle()

https://api.qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayer.html#a8b271b8bf3074e84808cff26f722b26f

which says: "[...] First an attempt will be made to see if this is a 
file and load that, if that fails the qgis.db styles table will be 
consulted to see if there is a style who's key matches the URI."

Regards,

Cool, yep that works on bookworm also! Well, libunwind-15-dev you get there.

Then I can compile/test/install pdal. Thanks!

One more question ;-)

After pdal install: if I try to compile QGIS 'WITH_PDAL', ccmake find the PDAL_BIN, PDAL_CPP_LIBRARY and PDAL_INCLUDE_DIR

But NOT the PDAL_UTIL_LIBRARY.

Any pointer to where that is supposed to point to?

Hello,

I'm working on a QGIS plugin to upload images to an instance (STAC) via 
a REST API.

I've found some examples 
(https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2022-January/064437.html) 
but they don't use the PyQGIS API, whereas I need support for 
authentication configurations and proxy settings.

Is this currently possible?

That was dropped and is included in libpdalcpp - so it's probably not needed
anymore and linking libpdalcpp is enough.

Mmm, installing in /usr/local/lib of pdal, results in linking errors (still pointing) to pdal_base and pdal_util...?

Do I have cached stuff? Cannot find pdal_base or pdal_util in my build dir??

Thanks for any pointers,

Richard

Hi

This should since be fixed in the latest mingw-filesystem. See [1].

Hi

You may need to put a line like this

QApplication.processEvents()

to ensure a refresh takes place of visual elements.

Hi

You can use QgsNetworkAccessManager::blockingPost that take an
authentication id and will use the proxy settings configured in QGIS.

If you want to make it non blocking, you can add it to a QgsTask and
execute it with QgsTaskManager.

Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] LTR version info in version.txt?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash2isW6b4RaoJaSM_naka9pCaeYCjg1F2rxdAyyABprYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Has something changed in the format of https://version.qgis.org/version.txt
recently? It used to be that this file included a string "current LTR
version of QGIS is xxxx", but that's no longer present and I can only see
the 3.32 release details now.

(on a related note... would it be tricky to make a "version.json"
equivalent of this file with content like
{
    'latest': {'major': 3, 'minor': 32, 'subversion': 3 },
    'ltr': {'major': 3, 'minor': 28, 'subversion': 10 }
} ? )

I think it is used for the about box. Juergen is handling this

Thanks Richard! I think I got confused because my local LTR build is
hitting up the https://version.qgis.org/version.txt instead of
https://version.qgis.org/version-ltr.txt
<https://version.qgis.org/version.txt> , and I can't see anywhere in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-3_28/src/app/qgsversioninfo.cpp
where the url is changed from version.txt to version-ltr.txt.

Is this a manual thing done during packaging?

There are version.txt and version-ltr.txt and requests from a LTR version
are taken to version-ltr.txt if they request version.txt.

On a new ltr release the redirect has to be updated (currently on www2.qgis.org):

RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} QGIS\/(2\.14\.|3\.4\.|3\.10\.|3\.16\.|310|316|322|328)
RewriteRule ^/version\.txt$ /version-ltr.txt [L]

Hi Sandro,
the new fixed version is now available used, so I will remove my workaround.

Anyway the MingW64 Windows 64bit Build is failing again for: "dnf5: 
command not found".
The command was changed from dnf to dnf5 1 month ago with 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/54152/commits/2a4a4b69475f9ae7d00880a6d3434f723a2a52c1 
because of "dnf: command not found".

Reverting back to dnf would fix the issue.

Do you know if it is a temporary issue with dnf5 or should we 
permanently use dnf?

Best regards.

Andrea

Hi Andrea

I'd revert back to dnf, dnf5 has been postponed for the time being.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Download troubles? Download in the background?
Message-ID: <CAB2Z92D73adhy=VLffqb4r0RNP4zJFWy1HD6T03Q9Zjnv3woRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Recently (past 1-4 months) I get a lot of emails at finance at qgis.org from
people who say that they donated but then could not download QGIS. I think
I got at least 40-50 such emails until now.

Sometimes they ask: how many times do I have to donate until I can download
QGIS?

I then explain them that donations are optional, often direct them to the
direct download page - and I tell them that downloads may take longer.

I believe that many users aren't aware that QGIS is downloading "in the
background". Because the QGIS downloads are rather large this can take
several minutes ...
Or may there be other problems with downloads? Does it require Javascript
to be enabled?

I wonder if we can display some hint that QGIS is downloaded "in the
background" and can take a while to download ....

I believe this is because many users don't know how their browsers work
with the downloads of large files ...

Is there anything we can do to inform users and enhance the download
experience - so that I don't get that many emails?

Thank you for your replies,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

ouch!

Javascript is not required for the download. If it is disabled, all OS 
options are expanded and the big green buttons directly point to the 
files anyways. The "donate" popup is only triggered in addition to the 
normal link click (if javascript is enabled).

If the users really just not realise that a download has started, maybe 
making the text that says that QGIS is being downloaded bold on the 
"donate" popup might help? The popup might just be too intrusive and 
distracting even.

Some sites use images to point their users towards the browser's 
download manager, maybe there is a freely available library that does 
this for all kinds of browsers and screens?

Downloads are often painfully slow though and might even time out in bad 
cases I guess. Having some more/faster download mirrors might help. The 
osgeo.org mirror is often unusable (I think it is that mirror that most 
often causes issues, norbit.de usually seems fine for me - from Germany 
though...). Here is one story of a user in South Korea: 
https://fosstodon.org/@ianthetechie/110943928875054838

Maybe users see super slow or failing downloads and think that it is a 
matter of donation.

I am aware of download.osgeo.org and norbit.de mirrors, are there more? 
It would probably be a good idea to have one in Asia and maybe one in 
Africa, depending on the routing. At least for Asia OVH has cheap offers 
that might just be good enough.

PS, if a CDN (probably overkill) would be considered: I am strongly 
against using Cloudflare as they are a global surveillance opportunity 
for the US and we would all be stupid not to assume that any traffic 
going through them is logged by three letter agencies. We should not 
participate in that kind of centralisation. There are alternatives like 
https://european-alternatives.eu/alternative-to/cloudflare . I would 
happily research a good choice.


Could you try to find out more details about why they get so confused?

Cheers, Hannes

Ironically, most of the ?European? CDN ?providers? use cloud servers of US-based services. Although the privacy agreement is negotiated with a European one, logging probably still takes place on the remote side.

Thanks for highlighting this Andreas.

If I might suggest a tweak to the popup layout:

Thank you!

Your freshly baked copy of QGIS is downloading. (Make this line bold and 
add a paragraph before the next bit)

QGIS is free of charge, and will always be free of charge if downloaded 
from QGIS.org. (and another break here)

If you can afford to support the project and people making this 
software, please consider making a small donation to support our 
efforts. Whether you choose to donate or not, we hope that you enjoy 
using our labour of love and encourage you to share and spread your 
downloaded copy far and wide so that others may enjoy it too. Our very 
best regards!

The QGIS Team

This might make it a bit more obvious. What do you think?

(I will leave those who are more technical than me to discuss download 
speed issues).

Best wishes,
Nick.

Message-ID: <73a9c4f3248d4ff69ec0c6a6d5718240@erdc.dren.mil>

Anyone out there working with QGIS 3D?

I am looking to get a new Dell laptop with i9 processor and 64GB memory and wondering what the minimum requirements for working with QGIS 3D is.  I had a coworker who could not run 3D on his laptop assume due to his lower end graphics card.  I don't offhand know what the spec's on his machine are.

I am looking at a Dell 7780 or 7680 with either NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada 16GB GDDR6 video card or the RTX 4000 Ada 12GB GDDR6 video card.

Wondering if the higher end card buys me much better performance and is worth the hit on battery life.

I think this looks good Nick, could we also put in a link to the QGIS hub
page and to where our links to the users groups are so that sorta provides
some 'support'.
Sorta off topic:
I recently got contacted by someone letting me know they donated so they
could get support - they thought I was the help desk for QGIS...Maybe this
is an indication of some UX/UI is required to send people to our support
pages???

Hi Luke,

The higher end card should indeed give you better performance.

However, there is a hard coded limit in QGIS 3D at the moment. A 3D 
scene cannot load more than 500 Mo of 3D objects even if you video card 
has a lot of available memory when the 3D scene is created.
The idea is to avoid out of memory crashes or GPU hangs. For example, a 
lot a 3D scenes could be loaded or other program may consume some gpu ram.

Beno?t de Mezzo and I have been trying to remove this limit but the code 
is not ready yet.

Cheers,

Jean

Hey Luke

Low end graphics cards should work fine as well. If your coworker could not
run 3D on his laptop, it could have been some other problem - it would be
good to have more details (hardware spec, operating system, in what way
things did not work) so that we can fix such issues. For example, my laptop
has 2GB of GPU memory and things work just fine. So both of the suggested
graphics cards should give you much more power for QGIS 3D than you would
normally need.

Cheers
Martin

To continue on the topic of donation and support, although I find it strange that someone doing a donation is expecting at the same time to receive special support (donation != license), maybe a precision should be made on the donation page (https://donate.qgis.org/) like:

"Please note that making a donation doesn't grant any additional support than what can be found at the support page (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html). For any specific need, you might contact one of the numerous companies offering commercial support (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/commercial_support.html#qgis-commercial-support)."

Maybe this same text could be add to the section "What is your benefit supporting the QGIS Development?" for the Sustaining Membership Program.

Thank you!

Your freshly baked copy of QGIS is downloading. (Make this line bold and add a paragraph before the next bit)

QGIS is free of charge, and will always be free of charge if downloaded from QGIS.org. (and another break here)

If you can afford to support the project and people making this software, please consider making a small donation to support our efforts. Whether you choose to donate or not, we hope that you enjoy using our labour of love and encourage you to share and spread your downloaded copy far and wide so that others may enjoy it too. Our very best regards!

This might make it a bit more obvious. What do you think?

(I will leave those who are more technical than me to discuss download speed issues).

Javascript is not required for the download. If it is disabled, all OS options are expanded and the big green buttons directly point to the files anyways. The "donate" popup is only triggered in addition to the normal link click (if javascript is enabled).

If the users really just not realise that a download has started, maybe making the text that says that QGIS is being downloaded bold on the "donate" popup might help? The popup might just be too intrusive and distracting even.

Some sites use images to point their users towards the browser's download manager, maybe there is a freely available library that does this for all kinds of browsers and screens?

Downloads are often painfully slow though and might even time out in bad cases I guess. Having some more/faster download mirrors might help. The osgeo.org<http://osgeo.org/> mirror is often unusable (I think it is that mirror that most often causes issues, norbit.de<http://norbit.de/> usually seems fine for me - from Germany though...). Here is one story of a user in South Korea: https://fosstodon.org/@ianthetechie/110943928875054838

Maybe users see super slow or failing downloads and think that it is a matter of donation.

I am aware of download.osgeo.org<http://download.osgeo.org/> and norbit.de<http://norbit.de/> mirrors, are there more? It would probably be a good idea to have one in Asia and maybe one in Africa, depending on the routing. At least for Asia OVH has cheap offers that might just be good enough.

PS, if a CDN (probably overkill) would be considered: I am strongly against using Cloudflare as they are a global surveillance opportunity for the US and we would all be stupid not to assume that any traffic going through them is logged by three letter agencies. We should not participate in that kind of centralisation. There are alternatives like https://european-alternatives.eu/alternative-to/cloudflare . I would happily research a good choice.



Could you try to find out more details about why they get so confused?

Cheers, Hannes

Hi all,

Recently (past 1-4 months) I get a lot of emails at finance at qgis.org<mailto:finance at qgis.org> from people who say that they donated but then could not download QGIS. I think I got at least 40-50 such emails until now.

Sometimes they ask: how many times do I have to donate until I can download QGIS?

I then explain them that donations are optional, often direct them to the direct download page - and I tell them that downloads may take longer.

I believe that many users aren't aware that QGIS is downloading "in the background". Because the QGIS downloads are rather large this can take several minutes ...
Or may there be other problems with downloads? Does it require Javascript to be enabled?

I wonder if we can display some hint that QGIS is downloaded "in the background" and can take a while to download ....

I believe this is because many users don't know how their browsers work with the downloads of large files ...

Is there anything we can do to inform users and enhance the download experience - so that I don't get that many emails?

Thank you for your replies,
Andreas

Hi,

At https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/1184, I made a pull request to
update the "Thank you" text based on Nick's suggestion (basically, put
download info in bold and split whole text in many paragraphs). I do not
feel really comfortable with mentioning support (companies) there, or do I
not find the right formulation...
Whoever feels interested in fixing that part of the issue, the source files
are accessible generally from the "fix me" URL at the bottom of the page or
under https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/tree/master/themes/qgis-theme.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,

I believe this reports from users are because of some problem with servers
or website lately.
I also encountered several times lately very very slow download rates even
though I have high bandwidth, optical internet connection (see my speedtest
result: Speedtest by Ookla - The Global Broadband Speed Test
<https://www.speedtest.net/result/15288350175>).

The solution for me was to start download again, but I can easily imagine
that users thought that they need to donate to get better download speeds.
>From my testing, I got best download speeds from Norbit server.

One other thing that I noticed lately is that main page (qgis.org) opens a
random language version of website. There is no translation to Croatian so
I expect to get English version, but I get randomly other languages - just
tested it this moment, and I got Italian version - "
https://qgis.org/it/site/", but lately I've often experienced Hungarian
version a lot, and once or twice, I got a Greek version, although I always
enter "qgis.org" in the address bar.

Maybe this weird redirection to another language is related to slow
download speeds.

I suspect that this is not particularly QGis related. Are you using a VPN? I get this often on various sites. It seems to be the browser that makes this decision, despite me setting everything to English.

As for the speed, well that is always variable. I use certain apps that sometimes require heavy downloads like Qt and X-Plane and I also have quite a fast internet connection. I usually end up either choosing a different VPN server or disabling it temporarily.

There is no translation to Croatian so I expect to get English version, but I get randomly other languages - just tested it this moment, and I got Italian version - "https://qgis.org/it/site/", but lately I've often experienced Hungarian version a lot, and once or twice, I got a Greek version, although I always enter "qgis.org" in the address bar.

Hi Colin,

no, I'm not using VPN. Language decision may be up to browser, I understand
that, but both problems started recently (maybe few months ago) and I get
this weird behavior only on QGIS.org, I do not notice this on any other
website.

Also I believe it's not connected to my internet provider, because this
problems also happen on my computer at work where we use different provider
(also optical, high bandwidth internet connection).
