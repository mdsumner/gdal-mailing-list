Hi everyone,
Here is my progress in the Google Summer of Code project:

   - Tasks done this week:
   - Reading the tessellation code used to generate triangles of building
      from polygons
      - Experimented with the Qt3DExtras::QDiffuseMapMaterial and explored
      some alternatives. Unfortunately some of the alternatives are
not available
      in the Qt version I use (Qt5.9).
      - Tried compiling QGIS with different Qt versions.
      - Added texture coordinates to the vertex buffer of
      QgsTessellatedPolygonGeometry.
      - Got the basic functionality of texturing buildings using 1 texture
      image working for some vector layer projects.
      You can see the texture rendering in action here: screenshot
      <https://imgur.com/aqJD8yV>
   - Tasks to be done:
   - Refine how the user chooses textures and include a default texture in
      case anything goes wrong with the texture image.
      - Define a generic class that handles material definition in a way
      that it can be extended for physics based rendering and other types
      of materials in the future.
      - Currently there are 4 types of vector layer data and some of them
      are not working properly so I will make the texturng work for
them as well.
      - Make a way to rotate texture coordinates using an angle specified
      by the user.
      - Discuss how we define separate roof textures from walls textures.

You can find the report here as well: wiki page
<https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Improving_qgis_3d>
I am open to any suggestions and feedback.
Best wishes,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] LTR 3.10: Fixing issues when content cache is used
	in blocking mode
Message-ID: <b92ada26-66dd-a8cc-9fdb-a802315dd16d@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I need your point of view about fixing issues when content cache is used 
in blocking mode.

A QGIS Server user has identified an issue when content cache is used in 
blocking mode. In some cases, the bug is timed out QGIS Server.
This issue is due to a loop to wait for content task cache begun. In 
some cases, the loop starts even if the task has already begun, and it 
is never stopped.
This issue has been fixed in master and version 3.12, by fixing the task 
manager waitforfinished (PR 32838 [1], a 6 mounths old PR) and removing 
the loop when content cache is used in blocking mode (part of PR 35158 [2]).
These pull requests has not been backported to LTR, the 3.10 release.

To fix, the issue in LTR, I have manually backported the 2 Pull Requests:
* Backport Fix Task manager waitforfinished, PR 36651 [3]
* Backport Fix issues when content cache is used in blocking mode, PR 
36624 [4]
And requested Nyall Danwson reviews.

After Nyall reviews, I have two options to fix the issue:
1. Fix Task manager waitforfinished (merge PR 36651 [3]) and removing 
the loop (removing commit c184270 [5] from PR 36624 [4] then merge it)
2. Keep and fix the loop (merge PR 36624 [4] and close PR 36651 [3])

So I need a collegial decision about the least bad way to fix the issue:
1. Merge a risky backport and remove the loop
2. Keep and fix the loop

Thanks for your feedbacks.

Hi Harissou,

Thanks for the pointer.
The PyQGIS were still pointing to the old disco build image of QGIS.
I just upgraded to focal. This should be fixed for master in a couple of
hours.

For 3.10 and 3.12, it will follow on the next point release.

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,

Like I said in the PR, I decided to not merge this fixes (there is other
fixes related to the task manager race condition issues) in LTR because
it was dangerous modifications which have an impact on the entire
application.

Even if no one has complained about those modifications in master
and 3.12, I will vote for solution 2 because of lesser impact.

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issues with CRS in QGIS master on Ubuntu 20.04
Message-ID: <CAMCJChvnJyjDohKKCj0fNb9eYTZZ5fdgh1Uyz8mB7saLhUiiJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm testing QGIS master on Ubuntu 20.04, but I'm getting some errors and
issues with CRSs.

Master was installed from nightly repo https://qgis.org/ubuntu-nightly

GDAL 3.0.4 and PROJ 6.3.1 are from Ubuntu repos.

I use EPSG:3763 as default CRS.

When I start QGIS, I get this error:

No transform available between EPSG:3763 and Unknown CRS

No transform is available between EPSG:3763 - ETRS89 / Portugal TM06 and
Unknown CRS: GEOGCRS["unknown",DATUM["unknown",ELLIPSOID["GRS 1….
proj_create_operations: cannot build geodeticCRS 4326: SQLite error on
SELECT name, ellipsoid_auth_name, ellipsoid_code, prime_meridian_auth_name,
prime_meridian_code, area_of_use_auth_name, area_of_use_code,
publication_date, deprecated FROM geodetic_datum WHERE auth_name = ? AND
code = ?: no such column: publication_date

Then I get several others, involving EPSG:4326, EPSG:3857 and Unknown CRS.

Another issue is that, apparently, QGIS does not recognize the prj file
from shapefiles, even if it was created by himself. For instance, this
sample shapefile
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1e7WxgPoSeTx7RiZHIaxdX0kvL8UuOk9Z

was created by QGIS, but when I load it, I get it as Unknown CRS:

And if I try to load a Google Layer from QuickMapServices plugin, I get:

Can this be related with https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/30569, or
seems more like a local problem?

Thank you very much.

You have definitely a mix of PROJ versions. Your PROJ library tries to access the proj.db of an 
older version.

Hi Even,

Your answer made the bells ring! It was OTB 7.1.0 that was configured in
environment variables, with older PROJ.

Everything fine now!

Thank you very much Even! And sorry for the noise!

Best regards,
Pedro

Did you succeed here? If not, I'd encourage you to keep pushing for
this. It's highly likely the minimum Qt version will be raised for
QGIS 3.16.

Happy to see your progress and the screenshot with textures :-)

As discussed on Slack, it would be nice if you could figure out why
the texture is upside down on some walls and fix it...

Sounds like a good idea!

> Define a generic class that handles material definition in a way that it can be extended for physics based rendering and other types of materials in the future.

I think we don't need to go that far. I would suggest that you just
update QgsPhongMaterialSettings to be able to keep information about
the texture image file, scaling (and anything else necessary).

> Currently there are 4 types of vector layer data and some of them are not working properly so I will make the texturng work for them as well.

It can be a bit more tricky to get other geometry types textured
properly - and different geometry types may need different
configuration. I would suggest that we stick to polygons for now and
have texturing disabled for lines and points.

> Make a way to rotate texture coordinates using an angle specified by the user.

That could be a nice feature - but maybe we can leave it as a "nice to
have" towards the end of the GSoC project - it is always good to go in
small steps, get the work reviewed and merged, and then continue with
some further improvements.

> Discuss how we define separate roof textures from walls textures.

For this we can use existing rule-based rendering - the user could
define one rule for features with roofs, the other rule for walls.
This would work out of the box for true 3D building geometries. For
vector layers that only contain 2D footprints of building which we
then extrude, we may need to add an extra choice for users: 1. only
create "roofs", 2. only create "walls", 3. create "roofs" and "walls"
(the default)

Cheers

Below some stacktraces.

QGIS start fine, but as soon as I try to open a layer (be it ogr or xyz)
QGIS crashes.

Any tips? I will try a super fresh configure compile too now.

Hi Sebastian,

Thank you for your reply. I'm developing a plugin to allow SSH Tunneling for a database connection (e.g. Postgres). Actually it works, but need some python dependencies.
It is not the first time I'm facing a third-party modules issue. The challenge is to:
- do not brake down native OSGeo4W python paths
- make plugin available to install for each qgis user, without root/admin permissions (put dependencies inside user's catalogue - e.g. inside plugin folder)
- make it uploadable to the Official QGIS Repository (shall not be to heavy, so can't include external libs in most cases)
- make it work on every OS

Recently I ended up with hosting all compiled dependencies for each OS and supporting Python version on my own server. Checking OS and Python during plugin startup, downloading appropriate archives and unpacking them inside the plugin folder, appending paths to sys.path. It has surprisingly worked, but it was horrible to develop if you have a long "dependency chain".

Does anyone have a better solution?

Hi Michał,

I was waiting for any of the QGIS developers to comment on this ... A collection of common, bad approaches can be found here [1]. Bottom line:
There is no clean way to do it. I recently wrote a summary of the situation and those approaches, see here [2]. I also released an official QGIS enhancement proposal which is currently being discussed.
It addresses this issue, among other stuff, see here [3]. I'd appreciate if you could describe your desired use-case and put it as a comment into the discussion. It would help to support the proposal.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi !

About WAL related issues :

I just tried to reproduce the original issue that lead to using WAL on
local files (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/23283) but could not
reproduce it (recent master, Windows 10). Does the issue still exist
on other platforms ? (this can be tested by changing the
QgsSetting qgis/walForSqlite3 to false and following the steps in the
issue).

If not, maybe we could consider switching back to journal_mode=DELETE, as
it seems it could solve some of the issues with gpkgs. If yes, would
sharing just one sqlite connection handle for all accesses to a sqlite file
be a sensible approach to avoid the deadlock without using WAL ? I' n

Cheers !

Olivier

Did you also try running the tests that were added per
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b6b8759efbeb833d0d3dbf6df008087701361ad3
with WAL disabled ?

To reproduce the issue, you might need a sufficiently large GeoPackage file so that redraw 
time is not too instant and/or possible move quickly your map just before validating an edit 
so that a redraw is in progress while changes are committed to the database.
I have unfortunately no memories of if/how I reproduced the issue. Perhaps I just came with 
the unit tests first.

Hi all,

there is a bit of a consensus building towards tomorrow, Wednesday, June
3rd, 14:00 CEST.

@Nyall: You also participated in the discussion on GitHub and I do not
want to exclude you. This should be 22:00 AEST on the same day. If you
want to join: Does this work for you?

I am going to try to send an open invitation via this mailing list.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Thanks for the consideration, it's much appreciated! I'll try to
attend, but don't delay starting the meeting if I not present (it'll
depend on family commitments which I can't confirm in advance,
sorry...)

I will try and join this as well if I can.   Haven't had a chance to finish
reading the QEP but will catch up on it before the meeting.

Hi all,

I am going to try a public Jitsi [1] server for this occasion:

URL: https://jitsi.hamburg.ccc.de/qgis_qep_179
Password: qep179

Jitsi works best with browsers based on webkit [2], i.e. you *might*
experience lag and connection losses with Firefox, I am afraid. If you
have any issues, please get in touch.

Talk to you in 2 hours.

Best regards,
Sebastian

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WFS layers and layer dependencies
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+Ys1cja8V6+tHUL-PPiaaxbETyUU3gAs-SmSaMjWmS9aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a small question regarding how layer dependencies work.

I have 2 WFS layers, one being edited, the other one read-only but is
actually a view based on the first layer.

How can we do that the second layer is refreshed when the first one is
edited?

I gave a shot at layer dependencies by making the view dependent of the
first layer, but when I add a feature, nothing changes on the view (I have
to re-open the project to see the changes).

Are the layer dependencies supposed to handle this kind of issue?
Am I missing something?

Note: the changes is actually happening in related layer (1:n relation),
but the related layer is also checked in the dependencies.

Cheers,
Denis

Hi all,

thanks for the participation today - it was an interesting and
productive conversation. I am going to update the QEP accordingly and
post a link to the corresponding change-log.

Unfortunately, not all could make it today. Because the QEP definitely
raises a number of questions which deserve being discussed (rather than
put into lengthy texts), I remain open for further conversations like
today. Please let me know if you're interested and what time-constraints
you have so we can find suitable arrangements.

Thanks & best regards,
Sebastian

Dear devs and fellow PSC members,

As part of yesterday's PSC meeting, we reviewed the grant proposals with
regards to this year's formal grant programme criteria. You can find the
results of this review in a new tab within the proposal spreadsheet at:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DICkD-aE7VlPPCrA44NlsHOkwfGO19UrGYHRKB_A648/edit?usp=sharing

12 out of 17 proposals meet the grant programme requirements and are
therefore eligible for funding. Out of these 12, there are two
documentation proposals that the PSC has decided to fund directly
through the (separate) documentation budget. The remaining 10 proposals
result in a total requested budget of EUR 45,400.

I'd like to stress that this eligibility check is by no means a
judgement of the quality of an idea. Therefore, I'd like to strongly
encourage to follow up on the related QEPs even if a proposal cannot be
funded by this year's grant programme.

The QEP discussion deadline for eligible proposals is Tuesday, June 9.
Afterwards we will move forward to the voting.

Regards,

Anita

Hi all,

Many thanks for handling this.
I have remove the labels from the concerned issues on the QEP repo.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AGrant-2020

I checked the list and it seems that 2 grants from René-Luc were not in the
evaluated list:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/188
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/187

I am not sure how you want to handle this, so I'll let you decide before
doing anything to the labeld.

Cheers,

Denis

Those two proposals were not submitted in the grant proposal form so we
did not discuss those. 
There was not much discussion in the QEP either, so maybe René-luc is
planing to submit those in the next grant round?

Since they were not submitted you can remove the label. If something
went wrong in the submission form René-Luc please get in touch.

Thank you for taking care of the labels!

Since no proposals for these two QEPs were submitted through the
submission form, they will not take part in this year's funding round.

Hi,

The file we have had problems with was a GeoPackage based on planning polygons so would you like me to look into see if I can create some sort of fake version for testing? Alternatively you may already have one that is suitable as our one is effectively just a table with ~1700 polygon entries.

We have switched that project over to using the database instead and it might be difficult to create an authentic fake version as I suspect the polygons need to be irregular to achieve the rendering delay you refer to.

I think our issues were always when someone was editing at the same time as someone else viewing the data.

Despite switching to the database we are still very interested to ensure the deadlocks issue is fixed because there will always be some datasets where you just want to share them read only and sometimes a network file is just more convenient; especially when it is only a few users.

Anyway; I'd be interested to know if it is fixed.

Thanks,

Paul Wittle

Hi all!

Because I better should not roll out QGIS with the afore mentioned premanent ballpark-warning in place, I investigatetd further and stumbled across an "allowFallback"-setting:

By placing a default datum transformation in the settings/options.../CRS you get new entries in your QGIS3.ini [find it on win at %APPDATA%\QGIS\QGIS3\], which are the operation parameters themselve and a setting to allow the approximate “ballpark” transformation [...] between a source and destination CRS pair, in the case that the preferred coordinate operation fails".

[Projections]
EPSG%3A31467\EPSG%3A25832_allowFallback=true
EPSG%3A31467\EPSG%3A25832_coordinateOp="+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=1 +x_0=3500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel +step +proj=hgridshift +grids=Minden.gsb +step +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80"

This is also writen to any project file containing layers with the crs', covered by the default datum transformation. It appears within in the tag <transformContext><srcDest [...] allowFallback="1"> and causes the warning to show up every time this project will be loaded, although the datum transformation is already working an no fallback seems necessary. 

If the _allowFallback=-setting in QGIS3.ini is (manually) edited to 'false', newly saved project files also contain <srcDest [...] allowFallback="0"> and the warning will not be displayed again on project load.

Reference to my quite hacky findings can be found in the QGIS Python API Doc, search for 'allowFallback': https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.10/search.html?q=allowFallback
Some of the allowFallback stuff is labeled "New in version 3.12", however I currently investigate on 3.10.5-LTR. Might this indicate a backporting issue? (Otherwise, the implementation of my datum transformation very well might still be incomplete, don't know.)

Just wanted to inform you about my (current) workaround, any further hints are certainly appreciated.
Greetings!
Thomas

I'm not super familiar with the QGIS details about the selection and preference settings of 
transformations. I now that Nyall made a lot of efforts to make this as smooth as possible 
(difficult challenge to have user friendliness and accurate behaviour in that field!).
Looking at your record for minden.gsb, it uses a very large area of use. Once integrated into 
EPSG, it will probably use a much smaller one fitted to the grid extent, and I'm not sure how 
QGIS will react when zooming out sufficiently so that the grid doesn't cover the displayed 
extent.
You could simulate that by creating a new record into the area table which uses the real 
extent of your grid

Very true!

Yes, I already thought of that, too. Can the extend be derrived from a gsb-file? Otherwise I have to estimate.

Command line with "gdalinfo Minden.gsb" and look at Corner 
Coordinates
Or just open the gsb file in QGIS as a raster and look at the 
properties.

Hi all,

After digging a bit more, it seems that the cache invalidation is not
working on the WFS layer.

If I call emitDataChanged on any of its layers dependencies, or call
emitDataChanged on this layer or even call triggerRepaint, the layer stays
the same.
Only, re-opening the project refreshes the layer.

I am not very familiar with WFS layers, anyone has an idea about this?

Cheers,
Denis

F5 seems to do the job for me. At least looking at the traces, it does discard
the on-disk spatialite cache to recreate a new one. I didn't test with changing
contents on the server to confirm.

The provider implements reloadProviderData():

Hi,

Not sure who created the Github-integration for QGIS-desktop on
Transifex (Juergen, Werner?)
Is it still working?

I try to connect another doc-test and doc-test2 tx-project to github but
get an error "Failed to contact Github" see screenshot.

It is not clear to me if this is a configuration error or something else.

So I would try to remove current link and the add it anew and try to
link desktop to desktop again and our pet project to documentation again...

Is that NOT ok for someone?
As said: I try to connect everything back later, but I may need some
help for the desktop thing...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

Got a phone call from an (to me at unknown) QGIS user who asked: "I
opened a shapefile but I cannot edit it.. the little pencil stays
disabled... I googled for half an hour but cannot get it working".

After some Q&A, it appeared that he had opened the shapefile from a ZIP...

So I was wondering: should we be more forgiving to new users, and for
example write messages to the messagebox when people click disabled buttons?
(I googled that a disabled button apparently still fires signals)

I know that for the average QGIS dev/user this is not so strange, but
QGIS is full with "silly things for un-experienced" users. Ask everybody
who runs 'QGIS for beginners"-courses!

As (Q)GIS is becoming more and more used by non GIS-experts, it would be
nice if we give usability a more prominent role.

I also understand that talk is cheap, and making complex things easy is
VERY VERY hard, but still... We do have a lot of clever people around,
which can do this!

Ubuntu Linux some years ago had a project 'papercut': fix as many
'little' usability issues as was possible. And ask 'users' to come up
with those.
I'm not goint to self-injure us here by asking people to tell us here :-)

But what about a 'usability' tag in the issue tracker?
And assign some of the 'bug fix' money to those?
(and encourage people to create 'usability' issues... /me hiding now)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

We already have "GUI/UX" tag which is used to tag usability issues as well.

Not addressing your general concern, but upgrading to GDAL 3.1.0 
will fix that particular point: update of .shp.zip is now supported. 
(performance will probably not be rocketting if the .shp.zip is too 
big)

Message-ID: <CAGiKOujMTeSY3gj98UUmWAv1__k2nThG=Ri4Mfq-g3=a2puSDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Here is my first week of the coding period report:

   - Tasks done this week:
      - Got the texturing support working with non planar roofs.
      - Made a pull request containing the texturing support implementation
      that you can see here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/36981
      - I had some issues debugging things related to the normals of
      surfaces not generated properly and then found out that was just
because of
      the point light position and there was no issues with the code. Then I
      decided to implement directional lights so I don't have similar issues in
      the future.
      - Made a pull request with the directional lights implementation that
      you can find here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37016
   - Tasks to be done:
   - Do the implementation of the separation between roofs and walls
      - Apply some of the community suggestions.
      - Discuss next features implementation and whether prioritizing some
      of them is better.

You can find the report here as well:
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Improving_qgis_3d
I am open to any suggestions and feedback.
Best wishes,

Hi,

I developped a plugin for the city of Lausanne on QGIS 2.18, and used 
qwt5 to implement an elevation graph, which works quite well.

Now that a want to migrate my plugin to QGIS3, and knowing that qwt5 is 
linked to PyQt4, I'm not able to find which module to use in my Python 
code, or even to know if qwt (6 or else) is still available in QGIS3. In 
OSGEO4W setup installation, it still seems to be available, but I don't 
know how to call it in my code.

Best regards,

Hi I've never used qwt5 together with QGIS, and after a quick google it
looks like the combi qwt/qgis3/python3 is pretty rare (or invisible to
me, but please prove me wrong :-) ).

Other options you could use (I can think of):
- have a look at the "Data Plotly" plugin in QGIS which has a ton of
options, and with which can create beautiful graphs
- instead of qwt5 (which has some dependency issues?) you could maybe
use 'pyqtgraph'? But only if you want simple graphs, I pulled it in one
of my private plugins.

If others know if it is possible to use qwt5 or 6 in pyqgis, please let
us know

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <6987c634-eb32-57a5-9d4f-455c2c49f463@lightpear.com>

Hi List,
Some of you may have seen my blog post on the OSGeo-Discuss list about 
which mapping servers are the most deployed. For those who haven't seen 
it, QGIS Server has about 60 public deployments (1% of all of them), and 
it serves 11,924 datasets (0.5% of all public geospatial 
WMS/WFS/WCS/WMTS datasets).

Potentially controversial here and I appreciate it's not a competition, 
but given the low uptake of QGIS Server compared to other Open Source 
offerings (GeoServer: 964 deployments, 963,603 datasets; MapServer: 544 
deployments, 389,709 datasets), is QGIS Server something the grant 
program should be funding? There are three Server proposals totalling 
€10,000, 22% of the fund.

Now, before you get the pitchforks out(!), please consider the following:

* Zero sum game - Any money spent on QGIS Server cannot be spent on QGIS 
Desktop. (The grants mostly aren't things that will improve the shared 
QGIS Core). (This reasoning also follows through to OSGeo funds).

* Multiple solutions - Open Source (and OSGeo) already has a very 
healthy ecosystem of mapping servers - does it need another one?

* Limited number of users benefited - I don't have stats for it, but 
QGIS Desktop is probably the most popular Open Source Desktop GIS, and 
is certainly going to have many orders of magnitude more users than QGIS 
Server.

* Playing to your strengths - QGIS' strength is it's Desktop and it's 
generally good practice to play to your strengths.


So given the above, and that QGIS is already "winning" as an Open Source 
Desktop (great job!), I'd like to suggest it's not a good idea to dilute 
the limited resources by spending them on QGIS Server. Instead it seems 
that far more people would benefit if that money was spent on Desktop, 
especially the bug fixing programme.

Or alternatively, given the "Unique Selling Point" of QGIS Server is its 
integration with QGIS Desktop, those resources could be used to further 
improve interoperability with GeoServer/MapServer/deegree/etc. Those are 
all successful mature OSGeo projects that excel at serving maps, have an 
architecture designed for it, and already have huge install bases.

TLDR: QGIS excels at being a Desktop, and I'd like to suggest it should 
play to its strengths and focus its limited funds there to benefit the 
most users.

I shall now retreat to my bunker. :-)

Cheers,
Jonathan

Note: The above only applies to the Grant program and funding; how 
developers wish to spend their time, and on which projects is of course 
their own prerogative.

(Disclosure: I have no horse in this race; I don't run or administer any 
mapping servers, but I have done GeoServer in the past.)

Hi


Nice, thoughtful message below, thanks Jonathon. I wonder what it will take to move the needle above 1%? And whether we should try to use our funds to make that happen. QGIS is surely the most expressive way to do cartography of any GIS out there (acknowledging total bias on my part) and seeing that cartography on the web would surely please many people. Clients like QWC, QWC2 or anything that requires you to hand edit a config file or log into a unix shell to publish map services are probably the main limitation (no offence to those tools). Also the lack of an built in tiling server (with proper metalling and meta buffering) must surely be the other.  Maybe a more useful approach to your discussion below would be to promote funding the elements that add resistance to deploying QGIS server……but then we would be in new feature space and circling back to the idea of not funding QGIS Server with grants…..

Regards

Tim

Something else to consider is whether technologies like WMS are
ultimately just "dead end" technologies now, and possibly we'd be
better off focusing on client side rendering of vector features from a
server (QGIS or other), and providing a library which can do
client-side rendering of vector tiles from QGIS symbology in as close
to 1:1 as possible...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WCS 2.0 access in QGIS
Message-ID: <CADsfgKON-oEQKAD2QHZ48A=Aq-yemr90OacFfap0rwf3YTh+nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to add a WCS layer from a server which supports WCS 2.0 , but it
failed.

Any idea / plugin which can help me.

I tried the experimental plugin QgsWcsClient2 but it also could not load
the layer.

For full blown nice reference maps or aerials  WM(T)S is still the way
to go. For simpler reference maps like Google, vector tiles will be...

Building a QGIS rendering engine in a browser, will always be behind (IF
it will ever reach the same amount of features).

In my view the unique selling point of QGIS Desktop/Server combi is (or
should be) the ease to create beautiful maps easily on a desktop and
then publish them (including metadata) to a server/service...
Just like our commercial brother does with it's services.

And mind you: while not perfect WMS/WFS are real standards understood
and used by a lot of servers and clients.

Vector tiles are great (or at least promising), but I've not seen any
client-side cartographic rendering of them yet.

Fully agreed with Richard here. 

OGC standards are important and even required by law. Other protocols
are ok though, if they are in addition. If they prove to better in the
future than OGC, then they might eventually replace the former. But
first, they would have to prove good interoperability and that they are
better. 

Regarding vector styles: 

I hadn't seen a complex, convincing vector style client-side rendering
yet. Mapbox and Maptiler come closest - but even these two are "mickey
mouse" maps compared to what national mapping agencies in our countries
established in quality over decades in their printed and raster map
product lines. 

In our country, Swisstopo (the national mapping provider) experimented
with vector tiles. The result: 

 	* it renders slower than the raster tile maps
 	* the CPU of the client is busier than with raster tiles
 	* the cartographic quality is disappointing. Many years away from the
original raster tile quality

The main advantage of vector tiles would be that the user could switch
colors - but did you ever have the need to switch colors in a we map?
Defacing a map where cartographers spent a lot of time figuring out the
correct color combos? 

Replicating QGIS rendering for vector tiles outside of QGIS in a totally
separate technology from qt rendering would be an interesting project,
but would always be different, lagging and would be a lot of effort. But
if someone finds a sponsor for that, it could be interesting.

I'm not a backend guy nor a qgis server expert, but because years ago
involved in finding solution to grow style incompatibility among geoserver
and qgis via sld (before in Boundless end to nothing because there were any
tech solution... or I'm too tech limiteated to imagine a solution) later
adding support for sld/raster in qgis, I could say:

1) qgis server is mainly used to respect styling and avoid headaches in
converting to other style languages... and secondarily as wps engine.
2) geoserver side never considered seriously to think at qgis server as
renderer delegate... or at least was my impression with geoserver guys in
Boundless
3) There is no way to represent rich map style in a interoperability way...
sadly I agree with you, qgis is creating (yet) another de facto
style language and I'm not proud of this, but far from me to judge, I'm not
a cartographer too!
3) Style rendering is heavily moving to client side

so having this open point, I can't say what would be better or not
financing a qgis server grant... For sure would be better facilitate qgis
project style rendering in other server platforms, but the solution does
not pass using SLD!

Hi Jonathan, 

You keep repeating yourself. You started the exact same discussion a
year ago. 

You have a valid point, of course, I don't argue that. But if you think
about small organizations  that do not have a lot of personal (or
financial) resources, it would be a lot of burden to invest twice the
time in styling: once for QGIS desktop and another time again for UMN
mapserver and Geoserver. Even if SLD output from QGIS improved (also
thanks to efforts of Andrea Aime and others), it still can't transport
everything. If it would, then I would better agree with your argument. 

For such smaller organization, speed (and I know that UMN and Geoserver
are a bit faster than QGIS server) is not the only important thing - it
is also their personal and financial resources and complexity of their
software landscape. 

And QGIS server has some other unique selling points: the proprietary
GetPrint command that doesn't have a match in Geoserver or UMN, the
ability to create Atlases from server, and who knows, in the future
perhaps QGIS server can run processing models. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

QGIS is surely the most expressive way to do cartography of any GIS out there (acknowledging total bias on my part) and seeing that cartography on the web would surely please many people. Clients like QWC, QWC2 or anything that requires you to hand edit a config file or log into a unix shell to publish map services are probably the main limitation (no offence to those tools). Also the lack of an built in tiling server (with proper metalling and meta buffering) must surely be the other.  Maybe a more useful approach to your discussion below would be to promote funding the elements that add resistance to deploying QGIS server……but then we would be in new feature space and circling back to the idea of not funding QGIS Server with grants…..

Thank you Jonathan for raising the discussion, I think this should be
a good opportunity to focus on how we can gain a bigger "market share"
and restart investing on the server with both time and funds.

Full disclaimer: I'm a QGIS server developer.

It would be probably useful to start a discussion about how we can
make QGIS Server better and what makes it lag behind "competitors",
both FOSS and proprietary.

- Is it missing features?
- performances/scalability?
- standard compliance?

I've personally found exceptionally productive the QGIS Server Meeting
we had in Lion a few years back (that ultimately led to a deep
refactoring of the server), I think we should organize a dedicated
(online) meeting with the interested parties to start a discussion and
share ideas.

XYZ/WMTS maps are certainly the way to go with raster products like aerials
or satellite data, which are for visualisation only. However, when it comes
to a national agency providing highly scalable vector map services, we have
concluded that using WMTS/WMS rasters has too many downsides. The key
benefits of vector tiles are:

* Faster generation of caches for serverless provision. Often you don't
need to generate vector tiles for each required client-side zoom
level/scale, and over-zooming is good enough. In some cases making raster
tiles with complex carto rules required massive computing resources and
timeframes. Even with cloud services, this is a key roadblock unless you
build very complex infrastructure architectures with auto-scaling. Even
then, it's costly to run and needs excellent expertise to set-up.
* Labels are nicely rendered client-side taking the device PPI into
account. For raster maps, generating maps for different DPIs becomes a
nightmare
* Being generally smaller which is essential for delivery to low bandwidth
devices
* Better user experience with seamless zooming and rotating of maps

I agree that raster maps can still produce nicer catro that vector tiles
(especially with combined raster/vector effects). However, raster web map
services have too many scalability issues, and in some cases, as mentioned
above, produce poor visual results or user experiences.  Of course, vector
WMS/WMTS still has it's a place for low volume websites.

In saying all of this, it would be great to get a seamless workflow from
data to published web maps. This needs to include having a style generator
(almost!) equivalent to QGIS desktop and a simple way to host and provide
maps at scale. I'm especially keen to see styling and export of vector
tiles in QGIS (it's almost there thanks to Martin and recent crowdfunding
initiative).

Cheers
Jeremy

Hi Alessandro, 

Good idea - I would be happy to join such a meeting. 

In our case (talking for my employer), it is mainly performance,
reliability, scalability and maintenance where we would like to see
improvements. A cache that can be shared between instances would be
great to have. And perhaps a management interface where one could get a
better insight to the state of QGIS server and it's cache: what projects
are cached, how much memory do they need, ability to reload certain
projects, etc. 

Of course, there might be other aspects as well, but the above mentioned
issues are our main pain points currently. 

We would also help with some funding and I can help to attract others.

I appreciate your viewpoint and assessment very much, Jonathan.

I trust the board heeds your advise and lead towards focused investment in
those things that matter to the majority users.

Thank you,

Hi Andreas, (& All),
A fair point, but I believe this is an important point and this year I 
do have data to back up my point; in fact the grant program is what 
motivated me to finally get around to doing this analysis.

It seems from the replies that while there are a few differentiators, 
the key one is indeed cartography and styling. (There's also an 
interesting conversation about vectors going on there too). Some thoughts:
* The vast majority of WMS/WMTS layers are not cartographically 
complicated, let alone beautiful. They're "here is a layer with small 
green points for trees", and "this polygon represents conservation 
areas". You can easily play around and see what's out there here: 
http://www.geoseer.net/api-demo/
* WFS/WCS can't be styled server side.
* It seems like overkill to create and maintain an entire server 
distribution that fundamentally only solves one (relatively simple 
compared to what QGIS Desktop can do) problem.
* Rendering is only one part the QGIS package (Analysis, digitisation, 
management, etc.).

If I'm honest, the "competition" on this point isn't really between QGIS 
and MapServer/GeoServer. It's really between QGIS and ArcGIS. Because 
ArcGIS does exactly what QGIS Server seeks to do: offer a single 
integrated solution for Desktop-> Server. And certainly ArcGIS Server 
does have a huge number of deployments (53%), however again, there 
really aren't many cartographically complicated outputs on there. And 
despite the huge number of deployments, most services and datasets are 
actually served by MapServer/GeoServer (about 60% of datasets between 
them!). Basically ArcGIS is deployed by local government and used for 
bitty-stuff ("here are our fire stations"), but if you want a real 
data-service then you go with GeoServer/MapServer/etc.

Most importantly though, I think I haven't conveyed my core point well: 
this really is a zero sum game!
Even allowing for the above, any funds spent on QGIS Server are not 
spent on QGIS Desktop. There are 60 public facing QGIS Server 
deployments. Even assuming that there's a ratio of 10:1 for 
private/public servers (made up ratio, feels too high), any funding on 
QGIS Server benefits only hundreds, or being very generous, maybe 
low-thousands number of users. Funding on QGIS Desktop however benefits 
as a *minimum* tens of thousands, potentially millions of users (no idea 
how many QGIS installs there are, I can't find the download-stats I 
remember seeing in the past).
Heck, even pretending for a second QGIS Server had 100% of the 
deployments (a 100 fold increase!), there would /still/ be orders of 
magnitude more people using the not-Server parts of QGIS Desktop by its 
very nature.

There are 3,102 open issues on the QGIS issue tracker. 95 are labelled 
regressions, 137 are "high priority", and 92 are "crash/data 
corruption". Just 49 are "Server". I'm not seeking to denigrate the 
project here; QGIS is a extremely complex tool that is an amazing 
accomplishment and by its nature it will have bugs. I raise these 
numbers to highlight that any money spent on Grants to Server (and yes 
new Desktop features) is money that isn't spent fixing these (I'm aware 
of the bug-fixing fund). Something I think the grant voters should be 
cognizant of.

Hope that clarifies,
I'll step back now. :-)
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan, 

Rest assured - the majority of QGIS funds is already (and has always
been going) into bug fixing. Again - both Desktop and server users
benefit from that bug fixing. 

We publish our financial reports here:
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/finance/index.html 

If you look into the 2019 report, you can see that around 50% of our
funds go into bug fixing and quality assurance (in some years even
more). Only about 10% of our funds went into the grants in 2019. And
from these grants, server received a small fraction. So, the absolute
amounts of investments that QGIS.ORG invests into QGIS sever is really
negligible. 

Most investments done in QGIS server go directly from clients to QGIS
development companies - and that has nothing to do with QGIS.ORG 

If you talk about the number of users of a server installation - I think
this is debateable: if you only count the admin of a server (regardless
of which server), then the numbers are low - no matter if we talk about
ArcGIS server, Geoserver, UMN, QGIS, etc. But every server easily has a
hundred or sometimes several thousand users who use these services -
don't you think. If I look at our small province - we have maybe 100
QGIS desktop users, but certainly several thousand users who use our
Web-GIS and OGC services - don't you agree? And our services integrate
with a lot of other applications that are vital to a province level
government. So in this perspective, (QGIS)-server installations need to
be multiplied with some factor to compare it with QGIS desktop user
numbers.

Hi,
I can't agree more with Andreas.

Just note that we have major companies betting on QGIS server for
production use and considering switching from Geoserver to QGIS server to
get rid of the double administration task burden.
They fund progressively what is missing and QGIS.org helps sometimes for
OGC certification testing and documentation but the majority of the fund
are not made by QGIS.org

So yes, we have open ecosystems, I don't get the point of trying to cut
(small) funds on a solution that is useful, supported by users and funders.

Best regards
Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GeoSeer ogc services data harvesting
Message-ID: <c369c8e81a858c3f2cc414f86c931253@carto.net>

Hi Jonathan, 

Can you share with us how you harvest your information on available
public OGC services? You probably have that information published
somewhere - so if you could point me towards this URL, it would help. 

I noticed that all of the services of our province (my employer) can't
be found, as an example. 

Here is the start point: 

https://so.ch/verwaltung/bau-und-justizdepartement/amt-fuer-geoinformation/geoportal/geodienste/wms-web-map-service/


and the GetCapabilities link: 

https://geo.so.ch/api/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=1.3.0


So I wonder how many other QGIS server installations may not be in your
database? Of course I know you don't claim full coverage, but it would
still be good to know how you harvest your data. 

Thanks for clarifying and greetings, 

Andreas

Re-reading my message, I think it comes across unintentionally
critical. I was actually just "pondering aloud"!

I definitely agree that there's a strong use case for a server
component which "just works" with QGIS, and I would hate to see this
efforts abandoned. Indeed, my personal opinion is that what osgeo is
really lacking is a unified solution to desktop/web/mobile. We have
all the raw building blocks, but there's just no direct equivalent of
ArcGIS portal where end users can easily publish datasets and maps.
Boundless was filling this gap with their offerings, but that's a
thing of the past now, and no-one has really stepped up to fill this
need. Possibly geonode + QGIS server backend is the closest we get,
but that's still needing significant investment before it's a really
compelling competitor.

I'd really love to hear what solutions others deploy when they're
asked by a client to replace an ArcGIS desktop + Portal environment.
Perhaps there's actually a need for **more** investment in QGIS server
to fund development of a Portal style geo-cms, tightly integrated with
QGIS desktop (and QField/Input)*.

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for clarifying - I am relieved by your further statements ;-) 

I don't know a good replacement of ArcGIS Server portal (or whatever
that product is called currently). I agree that it would be great if
there would be a good replacement for that - and that would need further
funding - and perhaps a good collaboration between more than one of the
OSGEO/QGIS developer companies. I fear that any of the available
OSGeo/QGIS companies on it's own is too small to cover that fully. It
probably needs something larger on top of it, with the smaller already
existing companies bringing in their individual expertise to that larger
entity. QGIS cloud from Sourepole was a good start some years ago, but
it would have to grow faster than it currently does, and that would
require a larger entity than Sourcepole (or most other similar
companies) are. And of course also more paying customers. 

The building blocks are mostly there, yes. 

Andreas

Just to clarify further -- I'm mostly talking about a
private/on-premises offering, rather than a SAAS type offering. Of
course, if someone wanted to take the components and offer as a paid
cloud service (as Sourcepole does/did), then that's great! But it
shouldn't be the initial goal...

Hi Andreas,
Sure, happy to share.
There's a little on the About page: https://www.geoseer.net/about.php 
and then scattered around blog posts (the ones with the "GeoSeer" tag 
are probably best for that: https://www.geoseer.net/blog/?t=GeoSeer ), 
but put simply - We scrape a lot of different sources and metadata 
catalogs and get the services from them. Then we request not only the 
GetCapabilities that was declared, but also make educated guesses as to 
what else might be on the box and request those too.

It's not perfect, but to the best of my knowledge it's by far the 
largest such index in the world, and more importantly, it's *current*. 
Everything in there responded with a valid GetCapabilities document with 
at least one meaningful named dataset when it was last scraped within 
the last few weeks.

Pertaining to your given services, GeoSeer has:
http://geoweb.so.ch/wms/sogis_natgef.wms? and a few others on that 
sub-domain, as well as some on the subdomain: 
http://www.sogis1.so.ch/cgi-bin/sogis/sogis_natgef.wms? - both are now 
defunct I see which is why they're not in the database.

Thanks for the URL, I've added it for scraping.

 > So I wonder how many other QGIS server installations may not be in 
your database?
Alas that's a "unknown unknown"; there's no way to know (I can't think 
of a way to find out anyway; suggestions welcome). However the vast 
majority of the time when I come across a new service manually (i.e. 
from following various mailing lists like this), it turns out it's 
already in the index, so I think it's reasonably comprehensive at this 
point.

While missing servers may change the absolute number of QGIS 
Installations, they're very unlikely to change the proportions. For a 
sample-size this large I'd expect the proportions to remain largely the 
same, certainly for deployments.

Hope that's of interest and answers the question,
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan, 

Thanks for sharing this information. I don't know anything better. 

While looking at some services that I know personally, I also found out
that others services are listed twice, because a machine might have a
DNS alias. That is also something to consider - perhaps sort out
machines that have identical GetCapabilities responses and just the DNS
name varies. 

I agree, the numbers probably wouldn't change significantly. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] webp for qgis server ?
Message-ID: <8c755a63-7306-f67a-bdb1-41c67b5b1933@opengis.ch>

Hi all,

At OPENGIS.ch we have recently looked into different raster formats. The 
results can be read here: 
https://www.opengis.ch/2020/06/09/offline-wms-benchmarking-raster-formats-for-qfield/

Not that surprising, but one of the interesting findings was that webp 
is very efficient. Low filesize, reasonable rendering performance, 
support for transparency. In short, it has all the potential for being 
used as default transport format for WM(T)S.

Looking at our server implementation, this format is not supported. Did 
someone ever think about or even look into that?

Regards

Hi Andreas,

Interesting.

Behind the scenes, GeoSeer one-way hashes the GetCapabilities documents 
and that hash is used as the document key. Identical GetCapabilities 
documents therefore get the same key and thus only appear once in the 
final index. But one single character different in the entire document 
and it's a completely different hash.

There's also de-duplication at the endpoint, service, and dataset levels 
using a similar mechanism. GeoSeer also de-duplicates across services. 
I.e. if something is served from the same place as both WMS and WFS, we 
glue them together.

The problem with using DNS is that you get organisations the size of 
NOAA/USGS and they have deployments across various subdomains that are 
doing different (but similar) things. You also get a kind of opposite - 
a single domain belonging to a geospatial "cloud" hosting provider that 
has lots of layers that have the same names and similar metadata because 
all their local-government customers are sharing their own 
fire-stations/roads etc.

There are all manner of ways in which server admins and data custodians 
make this more complicated than it seems. :-)

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi Marco, 

I agree. WebP would be interesting. It could potentially replace both
png and jpeg - if encoding and decoding is fast and if filesize can
compete. The good thing of WebP compared with JPEG is that it supports
transparency. According to your brief study, it seems to score well
regarding file size, but not so well performance wise - correct? The
performance that you measure - is this about time to create the files -
right? What about opening and rendering on the client? That's the other
side of the medal. 

Does qt support WebP? 

Regarding your blog post: can you perhaps better explain what PNG_JPEG
means? A PNG as a container with JPEG compression inside? Or what is it?


Regarding tif: could you share your creation parameters? In my
experience tiff performs much better than what you experience (both in
file size and speed) if you use proper compression and creation
parameters. E.g. you can use JPEG compression inside tiff and then you
should have more or less the same file size as with jpeg. tiff is just
the container, but there are thousand of combinations of creation
options that have a very, very significant impact on perfomance and file
size. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Yes - they are not 100% identical. E.g. the "OnlineResource" would be
different, but all the rest would be identical. I know exceptions here
and there ... difficult topic.

Encoding and decoding performance seems to be a bit worse. But this

Can you ask this question directly as a comment on the blog post? Lucie 
who is not in the office created the post and has all the parameters.

Thanks for the excellent questions Even

Lucie has done the analysis and has all the parameters. She is not in 
the office these days. Once she is back I hope she can share the 
parameters and potentially also add a couple of additional rows to the 
table with improved parameters.

Sorry that I can't help more right now.

Hi,

I submitted an update of a plugin last friday ([1364] UMEP) but it is still not approved. I dont see any other messages from you. What has happened?


best regards,

Matthias,

thanks for the analysis. There are however a few unexpected results.

1) I'd expect gpkg pyramid_JPEG and COG_JPEG to have very similar sizes, even COG_JPEG 
being potentially slightly smaller.
And I'd also expect COG_JPEG to be slighly faster (but with less confidence that my 
statement about size)

Has by chance the source raster an alpha band ? In which case gpkg_pyramid_JPEG would 
have dropped it, whereas COG_JPEG will encode it as DEFLATE compressed mask, but still 
the difference is surprising

Another explanation might be the block size. GPKG defaults to 256x256 tiles, whereas 
COG_JPEG to 512x512. Perhaps that affect compression efficiency. And performance? 
(depends if your bench maintains the GDAL raster opened between requests or not)

If you didn't specify quality settings, both COG_JPEG and GPKG JPEG should use the same 
quality of 75%

2) For the same compression type, block sizes and number of overviews, MBTiles (the report 
doesn't specify the compression scheme for it) and GeoPacakge should also have similar sizes 
and performance. They are really close brothers, with just a few systems tables different.

Hi,
I believe that a better deployment process for Server on Windows might 
be one way for little a bigger market share. I think that there are more 
people than me that uses Desktop today next to the Esri platform that 
would gladly start to switch over to Server as a wms provider if posible.

A dedicated online meeting is a really nice idea (where do I attend?) .

Hi Henrik,

Good idea. Now that Windows server has a Linux subsystem and docker, the 
easiest thing would be to use docker, I think. That way you would have 
the exact same setup like on Linux. No more strange Windows problems.

It might be one path to use to tackle the windows installation problem, 
but it wouldn't be the only one.

Alessandro: will you suggest dates for a meeting - perhaps by starting 
with a Doodle to see when most interested people would be available?

Andreas

Good day I think that being able to publish a project directly through QGIS
Server just by mounting the QGis project done on the desktop is just
fantastic if those tiny great details of QGIS Server were fixed would
definitely take off tremendously

Maybe integrating the lizmap plugin into the QGis core and giving the user
the possibility to choose their project to publish in an interface similar
to lizmap or perhaps with the qgis web client 2 project would make users
start looking seriously at QGIS Server and surely many would run to migrate
immediately because it would simplify many things in addition to giving a
lot of power to both qgis desktop and qgis server.

It is just an opinion that could be valued I only speak Spanish so I copied
the original text below in case something was not translated correctly with
google translate

Buen dia yo creo que el hecho de poder publicar un proyecto directamente a
traves de QGIS Server con solo montar el proyecto QGis hecho en el desktop

Quiza integrar el plugin de lizmap al core de QGis y darle al usuario la
posibilidad de elegir su proyecto a publicar en una interfaz similar a
lizmap o quiza con el proyecto qgis web client 2 haria que los usuarios
empezaran a mirar muy seriamenet a QGIS Server y seguramente muchos
correrian a migrar de inmediato porque se simplificaria muchas cosas ademas
de darle muchisima potencia tanto a qgis desktop como qgis server.

Message-ID: <85d10d1d-3d99-83bc-0372-c5500e098db7@duif.net>

Hi,

Using the Measuring tools now on a dual screen setup, the angle tool
pops up very much out of sight every time.
Either the position is not remembered (if I am correct the line
measuring tool pops up above my screen always).

But would it be an idea to make these dialogs dockable? Then a user can
put them wherever she wants, but also can detach it if needed?

Or is there some practical reason to have dialogs?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think this is desirable. I'm fairly certain there's an open ticket
for it, too.

Jonathan, I forgot to ask you: do you have any statistics/guesses
about the underlying operating system ?

It would also be interesting to know how much "cloud" technology is
used (AWS & C.).

Cheers

Another observation (I'm using the angle tool to check if the angle
between two lines in the field are 90 degrees, and have to switch  'snap
to lines' on/of in the middle of the readng (and 'snap to intersection'
enabled):

The dropdown to switch between 'Vertex/Segment/Area' is not very
mouse-friendly: (de)selecting one does not close it (because it is a
multiselect, I understand). But now you have to 'escape' to close it, in
the middle of a reading.

Wouldn't it be better to make these checkbox-buttons? The drawback
offcourse being the snaptool-toolbar being enlarged with 4 buttons...

But let me end with noting that I find the snapping/tracing tools a
breeze to work with in QGIS !!!

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS startup time, Loading of Processing
Message-ID: <b35dc727407f8923e15b81e49027a175@carto.net>

Hi, 

Given that the initialization of the Processing plugin takes around 2/3
of the QGIS startup time, I wonder if we can discuss how to improve the
situation? 

Can there be a "delayed" or "on demand" loading of processing if the
user needs it? 

Quite a lot of users use QGIS for viewing or editing, without any need
for analysis. I know that they could disable the processing plugin or
use a different user profile where the plugin is disabled, but ... 

Is there something that we could do as QGIS developers to speed up,
delay or on-demand load the processing plugin? 

Thanks for the discussion, 

Andreas

Yes, I think there's lots we could do. But I'd love to see a
screenshot of the new startup time profiler for one of your affected
slow-to-start machines.

Typically the culprit is the GRASS and SAGA providers, where they load
algorithms from 100s of text files. File access like this on Windows
is very slow, so I think the easiest thing to try first would be if we
concatenate all the definitions into a single master text file...

Hi Nyall, 

You are right. GRASS and SAGA take the longest time in initialization.
Perhaps we should disable those by default. I think both are for
advanced users. These users should know how to enable the SAGA and GRASS
providers, should they need them. 

Here is the screenshot from my QGIS on Linux (without SAGA) (I'll send
another one for Windows later): 

Seems like DataPlotly also takes substantial time to load. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

we also see more and more companies moving away from other solutions and
go to QGIS. The Desktop is often the driver, but more and more people
realize the huge advantage of having the same rendering on desktop,
server and specially mobile. At OPENGIS.ch we hope to contribute a
further big piece to the ecosystem with QFieldCloud.

A very very biased observation: in 6 years of running OPENGIS.ch, we
were asked maybe once ot twice to deploy a geoserver instance, we get
monthly requests to do the same for QGIS. Maybe it's Switzerland, Maybe
is us, but most certainly it is not because of the complexity of
installing QGIS...

To me, this integration is a _major_ USP for the QGIS ecosystem. I'd go
as far as saying that it is THE usp.

absolutely agreed, in fact if we had more fund I think we could invest
more in the server and make people more aware that QGIS is not only a
desktop tool.

That is also part of the qgis.org website refresh, where we have an
opportunity to really convey better the message of QGIS being all you
need to run your SDI.

As others said before, I don't see this as a Zero sum game, on the
contrary, I  think that QGIS here as a real chance to get at it's real
concurrence which is definetly not MapServer or GeoServer.

It will still take a bit of time, but with amazing pace that we all are
pushing, we'll get there in less than we think.

Cheers

Thanks! I'm going to add some more granularity to the GRASS startup
login shortly (but I'm 99% certain it will confirm that the issue is
the text file reading...)

Yes - unfortunately that's the 3rd party plotly imports themselves
which are slow. Possibly there's a way to defer these imports until
needed till. Could you file an issue on the DataPlotly tracker about
this?

Heck yes, Thanks Ray for the idea of a lighthearted historical deep dive

QGIS server [0], [1]
- 2011 -> Born, (QGIS 1.6 - 27.11.2010)

Geoserver [2]
- 2002 -> Born? (0.9)
- 2003 -> 1.0
- 2011 -> 2.1.3

Mapserver [3]
- 1994 -> Born
- 1997 -> 1.0
- 2011 -> 6.0

So we can be 9y behind Geoserver and 17y behind mapserver ;)

Cheers all and keep up the amazing work, and thanks Jonathan for
triggering the interesting discussion

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Typed Variables?
Message-ID: <e2e5cb6d1669ba9181d5143f3d608a2d@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have a question about the variables that can be defined on different
scopes. They are most of the times (or always?) strings, if I manually
define them - right? Some of the automatic variables might be of a
different type (like date, layer, etc.) 

Can I also manually define a "typed" variable? E.g. a boolean true
instead of 'true' as a string? 

That way I could directly use variables without having to add CASE WHEN
END statements ... 

My use case would be to have a boolean "debugging" variable. If it is
set to true, then certain parts of the form with internal IDs would be
visible, if set to false, they would be hidden. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

If required, the variable UI (and serialization to ini/project/...) 
could made typable.

But for this use case, add a variable with 0 (or 1) and use

CASE WHEN @debug THEN
   'We are debugging'
ELSE
   'No debug'
END

That should just work

Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Grids vs Grid-style Labeling?
Message-ID: <a1b5af40-bf26-f6d6-52e0-d82f28a6f271@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37028

@hrdrckx does a feature request for a button in view>decorations>grid to
set the color.

My idea first was to point @hrdrckx to the 'Create Grid' processing
function, but then I realized it is a hassle to setup 'grid-like labels
along the mapcanvas'... IF it is possible with our already VERY advanced
labeling functions

I also looked at the Layout map item grid tools

What do others think is most efficient:

- just add a color button in the decorations dialog (should be not too
difficult? Though next question will be: can I also make it bold :-) )

- create a labeling regime which places labels on the edge of the
mapcanvas (like the grid decoration)

The second option is (maybe) also useful for other cartographic
functions (???). And we could add a button to the processing dialog 'Add
grid labels' and maybe cleanup old grid/decorations code an let the menu
point to the processing then?

Or am I trying to efficient/cleaning...

Regards & Thanks for any input,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Heads up: Qt dropping support for Win 7 for Qt 6.
Message-ID: <CAB28Asid8XKf=Fzyd15=Wdzu6_ZtiTa0A69xW00VAdsL4KiBZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just a quick warning in advance: Qt upstream has decided to drop
support for Windows 7 with the next release of Qt [1]. It's the right
move, given that Windows 7 is EOL and no longer supported by
Microsoft, but it will affect QGIS users in the future.

It's unlikely to have a huge impact on our users, but it is something
to keep in mind if you're responsible for large government
organisation deployments, and they're still planning on sticking with
Win 7 for the foreseeable future!

If you manually define them, then yes -- they are always strings.

Correct. The underlying API allows for any variant type value (just
like expressions), so potentially a variable could be a int, date,
datetime, string, list, map, interval, feature, etc...

> Can I also manually define a "typed" variable? E.g. a boolean true instead of 'true' as a string?

Only via PyQGIS, not via the UI.

It's been requested in the past that we support expose an option for
these. And I'd like to see this happen, because then we could improve
the UI for entering variable values in the variable list widget. E.g.
if a variable has been defined on a project level as a "color" type
variable, it would be nice to make it so that when you override this
variable for a particular layout item you get a color picker widget.
And similarly, if you defined a variable to be of the type "font
name", then the tree widget could show a drop down list of available
fonts. It would certainly help make them more accessible.

It's actually somewhat of a dream of mine to expose variable editing
better in the QGIS UI to users. E.g. - via variables its completely
possible to make symbols which alter their appearance. So already have
this concept of "smart symbols", where you could have a marshland
symbol which alters its appearance based on variables like
"@height_of_vegetation" and "@density_of_vegetation" and
"@health_of_vegetation". That's possible today. But to modify these
variables you need to go into the raw variable editor for the layer
and tweak their. What would be great is if we did things like expose
them at the symbol selector dialog -- so that if a user picks your
"marshland" smart symbol from the library, they don't see all the
underlying symbol layers and those settings, but instead just see
widgets for tweaking these specific @height_of_vegetation/...
variables.  This is where "typed" variables would be a necessity!

Hi Nyall, 

Thank you very much for your detailed reply. Good to hear that there is
an interest in making this happen. Is this something that could be added
during QGIS 3.x life span or would this have to wait for QGIS 4.x? Would
this be something for a 2021 QGIS grant? 

About my specific scenario: 

I was looking for a to_boolean() conversion function - but it doesn't
exist. Would the alternative "eval(@debugging)" be the way here - are
there any downsides of using eval() in this context? @debugging would
hold a string 'true' or 'false'. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <88c34c75-0b36-1234-488d-61ad219bcc3d@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

maybe a silly question but it seems to me that the
QgsProcessingParameterMultipleLayers is not correctly exposed in the
Processing Modeler Input, but maybe I'm missing something.

If you create a new model and try to add a "Multiple Input" input in a
model that you want to use with the "Merge Vector Layers" algorithm, the
way to feed the algorithm is by using the "Value" mode while I was
expecting to use the "Model Input".

The model is running just fine, but not sure if this is the expected
behavior.

Before to open a ticket I just wanted to have some feedback :)

Cheers

Matteo

Hi all,
Here is my first week of the coding period report:

   - Tasks done this week:
      - Got the separation between walls and roof working as you can in
      this screenshot <https://imgur.com/OdlrvDo>.
      - Got the textures rotation working (Very useful for roofs texture to
      be aligned properly).
      - Finishing the implementation of directional lights (PR link : Github
      PR <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/37016>).
      - Refactoring the code in vector layer texturing PR according to
      suggestions (PR link : Github PR
      <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/36981>).
      - Fixing some bugs with the vector layer texturing implementation.
      - Tasks to be done:
   - Finish the implementation of vector layer texture support.
      - Document the feature implemented more and enhance the UI.
      - Get my pull requests approved.
      - Discuss next features implementation (mainly exporting scenes)
   - Blocking issues:
   I had some trouble organizing my time due to some school project this
   week but everything is going well I think.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issues with obsolete installation of QGIS 2.x in
	Osgeo4W installer
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+b322g6i_grgsV013AD6SYy0PowhxvQsQ8THh7PQx9vAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, hi Juergen,

I got contacted by someone facing a missing CRS in a fresh QGIS 2.18
installation from the Osgeo4W installer (which can be found in obsolete).

Using the standalone obviously fixes it.

I don't know if this can easily be fixed. I guess recent proj/gdal don't
play well with QGIS 2.18.
I would recommend dropping QGIS 2.18 from the installer.

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,

This plugin author requested on a Telegram group channel to be approved:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/opendata_loader/

I found the plugin but there was an error in the repo/issue metadata
(the author apparently renamed the repo), so created an issue now:

https://github.com/KaplanOpenSource/qgis-open-data/issues/2

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS what about creating an email group for 'plugin-approvers'? If
somebody sents me all mail addresses I can create one group (if others
agree)

Message-ID: <CAPnckXTdsSzJgMEiRbkwUzu-yx5nU_jwUqSY1g2PwPw+pfUMOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm aware about other issues dealing with PostgreSQL12, like this one:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32321

But my project that uses Qt class *QSqlTableModel* to fill QTableView is
not working.
I can execute this code:
model = QSqlTableModel()
model.setTable(table_name)
model.select()

But when I check if model is valid with:
model.lastError().isValid()

model.lastError().text() returns me this message:
Unable to find table 'tablename'

Developing with QGIS 3.12 in Ubuntu Bionic

Any hints how could I solve this issue? Will Qt version updated in next
releases?

Also there is a reported bug in Qt:
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-79033

Thanks

Just a general request to those request:

Would it be possible to "guide" plugin authors, when creating specific
plugins for specific countries, to maybe use their country code in the
repo name?
By this, it would maybe be much easier not to get confused, when one day
there are e.g. 180 open-data loaders around ;)

opendata_loader is a huge title for such a tiny potential audience (no
disrespect!)

opendata_loader_il vs. opendata_loader_us vs. opendata_loader_fr ...
would look much better to me than having dozens of differentiating
names, trying to describe the same function but with other words.

I do not mean this plugin specifically, cause it has at least "Israel"
in it's name on the plugin page. But with a lot others, you'll even have
to dig into the description to find out that it's of no use for you.
Or even add country code tags in the meta-data for filtering
country-specific plugin?

Just my two offtopic cents

That's up to Ubuntu to decide -- you're getting the Qt version pushed
out by Ubuntu, and the QGIS project doesn't influence this decision in
any way...

Hi Bernd,

First, thanks for your two cents (:

At the moment, the code is general, and the only thing that makes it
"Israeli" is the data we load to it and the interface language.

Regardless, your point is valid. I'll check if/how to change the page after
it gets accepted.

This is very premature! Looking at the changelog, it's basically just
direct copies of the pr messages. So it's full of bad things like:

"Continued work on vector tile layer implementation."

"This feature adds a few bug fixes and speed optimizations."

"It's about time our font marker gets a font style name setting"

"I was in need of such a feature for some work I'm doing, hope it'll
help others too."

:P

We definitely DON'T want this to be the final changelog. I think it
needs at least another week for people to fix these entries...

Too bad, I had not even looked into current version yet...

Was hoping to be able to line it up with the release, that is why I did a 'Last streak' message/call last week and planned to do it today..

Ok we will see... Give me a call... will create a place holder then :-(

I will try to do another pass over the weekend too…I think on the gatekeeper discussion, we need to push developers to make their PR’s ‘changelog ready’ so that we dont have to do lots of editing on the changelog.

Yeah, maybe a changelog-ready PR template would be helpful.

Hi Jürgen and all,

I can't see gdal 3.1 and Proj 7 in OSGeo4W.
I do see there gdal-dev 3.2 and proj-dev 7.1.
Does it mean that QGIS 3.14 is being packed with gdal 3.0 and Proj 6.3?

Kind regards,
Idan

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_HpD+orF0S_ofv_TjXXRLZ_UAPCg53B8aKZExfiMqYbAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

*TL;DR;*

Would it be ok to add a group key in the function help JSON files?
Something like this:

{
"name": "array_agg",
"type": "function", * "group": "Aggregates",*
"description": "Returns an array of aggregated values from a field or
expression.",
"arguments": [
{"arg": "expression", "description": "sub expression of field to
aggregate"},
{"arg": "group_by", "optional": true, "description": "optional expression
to use to group aggregate calculations"},
{"arg": "filter", "optional": true, "description": "optional expression to
use to filter features used to calculate aggregate"},
{"arg": "order_by", "optional": true, "description": "optional expression
to use to order features used to calculate aggregate"}
],
"examples": [
{ "expression": "array_agg(\"name\",group_by:=\"state\")", "returns":"list
of name values, grouped by state field"}
]
}

*WHY*

I am following Thomas Grattier effort to put all expression functions in a
single HTML page:

https://gist.githack.com/ThomasG77/0c6862fb2b6b3fc301ea994733688ea5/raw/99ecc5e6127e7238814da330a4d5d0b9fa2afe4e/qgis-3-12-expressions-single-page.html

This is how he did it:

https://gist.github.com/ThomasG77/0c6862fb2b6b3fc301ea994733688ea5

This made me think that would be great to have a complete list like this on
our documentation. But, unfortunately we can't use his approach which
generates HTML

My idea would be to use the JSON files in QGIS\QGIS to semi-automagically
populate the function list with Sphinx format files. Which would be much
easier to do, if there is a group key in each function.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/5747

Message-ID: <edb19aa9-0b00-96b0-612d-aa2069043d48@duif.net>

Hi PSC, Dev's,

I was not receiving list mails since last saturday, and thought to check the admin interface of the lists.
My account had the 'nomail[reason]' checkbox checked.
I do receive mail list mails sometimes telling me that mail was bounced and asking me to stay on the list or not, so I thought it was a personal problem

But then Raymond called and asked me if I also did not receive any mails.
And he was also had 'nomail[reason]' checked.
I checked some others and some had a checkbox (userlist: Regis, marco at qgis.org) etc..

So my question is: do others also miss mails (I know people missing mails will also not see this one).

Or did something change at the OsGeo site?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi

I guess the way to confirm if you are missing mails is to compare with the list archives and see there.

Personally I am not aware of any changes made - maybe a question for the SAC team?

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Create plain table (without geometry) in gpkg?
Message-ID: <a14cd5ee-dbeb-5d97-76da-0e305447e51d@terglobo.nl>

My python plugin should create a table without geometry in a gpkg to 
store some additional (meta) info about the layers. I could use python 
bindings for sqlite of course, but the plugin users might not have that 
installed.

What are the options from within qgis? Is python-sqlite available, or 
can I run sql queries in antother way? Or can I create a table similar 
to creating a new maplayer?

My (ugly) solution would be creating a point layer and use that 
attribute table and storing POINT(0 0) as geometries.
Or even worse, creating a .csv sidecar file for my gpkg.

Hope anyone here knows a better solution!

Regards,
Raymond

Raymond,

You should be able to just use the normal QGIS vector API for that. For example

May I draw some energy to:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37352

The Oracle connection dialog is broken in 3.14 to add any layers...

Loading a layer via browser still works

(pretty sure (mmm, be carefull) this worked recently because I use nightlies on our dev server there)

I think this is worth a 3.4.1 :-(

Which makes me think: anybody offering us some space in datacentres: is it maybe an idea to run an (free) Oracle db somewhere on a machine (which then can be connected to via an ssh tunnel or so)?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks Even, that is it. So easy!

And then you can create features without geometry and add them.

Here's my little test script for those who are looking for the same:

vl = QgsVectorLayer('NoGeometry', 'test', 'memory')
pr = vl.dataProvider()
pr.addAttributes([QgsField("txt", QVariant.String)])
pr.addAttributes([QgsField("num", QVariant.Int)])
vl.updateFields()
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vl)

feat = QgsFeature()
feat.setAttributes(['hi', 3])
pr.addFeatures([feat])


Regards,
Raymond

Message-ID: <4cd387274b4172c46a954cd9c5cbeb07@carto.net>

Hi all, esp. Peter, 

So I wonder what the new announcement of Apple switching everything from
Intel to arm architecture will mean for our project? According to Apple
they will switch all of their devices to arm over the next 2 years. 

Will it be a lot of work to adapt the build system to the new processor
architecture? It will probably mean that we will need an additional Mac
build server for arm architecture in our infrastructure and will have to
provide packages for both systems for many years to come ... 

Not so nice for us as a project - can we forward these costs to Apple
for that move? 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,
I'm also worried about this move.

But one way to forward the cost to Apple is now to stop buying macs.
Sorry to troll, but the vendor lockin' nightmare they are building is not
of the same nature as of the powerpc era.
I sold mine because they stopped to support it though it worked very well
on the hardware side. And switching to linux on Mac is made hard on
purpose.. > never again for me, even if they do really good stuff.
I found in LENOVO some durable hardware, easy to repair, hardware that
works nicely and avoid me to trash a working computer.

Hi,

As building on iOS already works (
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/input-sdk/tree/master/ios), I imagine it
would be possible to  run another architecture build for MacOS with a
similar approach. It is in Apple's interest to facilitate transition to
developers. To evaluate how hard it would be, that is more tricky at this
point. First of all, Qt has to support this new architecture, I haven't
found a statement from them yet if they plan it and when. So even Qt
supports it (hopefully from Qt5 releases and not Qt6), we have to build all
the deps with the new architecture, which takes some time to create
recipes. And of course find a hardware where it all can be built (probably
another machine , yes). Not saying that it is very frustrating to do
development of such a new package if you do not own such hardware
yourself...

P.

Hi Peter,

Thanks for this feedback.

I remember when Apple switched from PowerPC to Intel that they had kind 
of compatibility/abstraction layer that allowed old software to work on 
the new intel platform. Are there similar plans with the switch to arm?

Andreas

Surely the code ought to all build on arm64 (and earmv7, sparc, sparc64,
RISC-V, and many others).  If not it needs fixing anyway.

(No disagreement with your points about CI and build servers.)

I suspect there will be a lot of aarch64 and RISC-V hardare in the open
source world over the next few years.

Hi alls,

I was looking to create an empty GPKG layer and try the solution Even provide, but
it creates an invalid file.

fields=QgsFields()
fields.append(QgsField("note", QVariant.Double))
QgsVectorFileWriter.create("/tmp/test.gpkg", fields, QgsWkbTypes.MultiLineString, QgsProject.instance().crs(), QgsCoordinateTransformContext(), QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions())

I try also:
lyr = "mylayer"
QgsVectorFileWriter.create("/tmp/again.gpkg", fields, QgsWkbTypes.MultiLineString, QgsProject.instance().crs(), QgsCoordinateTransformContext(), QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions(), QgsFeatureSink.SinkFlags(), None, lyr)

It looks like there is no layer in the produced GPKG. Is it an issue, or am I misunderstanding the use of QgsVectorFileWriter?

Kind regards,
Julien

Hi Julien,

I believe you need to add at least one feature to trigger the layer
creation (through QgsVectorFileWriter/GDAL).

You may try QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection::createVectorTable
or QgsProviderRegistry::createEmptyLayer (they both use the same
provider's code)..

Hope it helps.

Yes they will support application bundles that ship both ARM and Intel architecture (“Universal Binary”) - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary

They will continue to support their Intel based machines for years to come (no specific end of life indicated yet that I have seen) but they expect all new hardware to be sold to be based on ARM within 2 years.

I wouldn’t bash Apple on this - Intel have been slow at rolling out small nanometer architectures and the whole world is moving towards ARM - Windows is already available for ARM though they kinda fluffed it. Plus they are a company who likes to periodically advance their platform with breaking changes - just like we did going from QGIS 2 to QGIS 3.

Apple are good at making their developer tools work nicely at compiling software for the hardware they support. Since long ago Marco Bernasocchi started making QGIS ARM friendly, hence QGIS for Android, QField and INPUT.

For me I welcome this - the ARM chips will use less power when under low loads (better green footprint) and the new platform promises being able to run iOS apps directly on macOS so e.g. we can run INPUT straight on the desktop if we want to use a lightweight QGIS (ok yes I know INPUT could already be compiled for macOS but not run using the same package as iOS built one).

Regards

Tim

Hi,

Well, Linux systems for ARM have existed for ages NOW.
Simply put, the energy consumption of ARM devices is far lower than intel’s crap.
That’s why Apple is doing it, they have announced that intention years ago.
Microsoft has started shipping tables for ARM, too, btw.
Though, MS is not quite there, yet, and they probably never will be, not within the next few years at least.

You can do cross-compile builds with CLANG/LLVM on a 250$ Chromebook using OSXcross.
https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross
Chromebooks are the easiest commercially obtainable ARM-computers nowadays.
Switch to developer mode, install Crouton with ARM-Ubuntu in a chroot, and there you go.
Or install Chrubuntu if you don’t want to use the kernel of the underlying ChromeOS.
Using Chrubuntu, you might have trouble with drivers, though.

That worked for me; mono (.NET) and Java work on ARM, too.

PS:
Why not simply ship a Linux-Docker-Image for ARM processors ?
It is my understanding Linux Docker images work on OSX.
Certainly would work for server components.
GUI might be a different chapter, but since OSX can do X11 ...
Not sure how Wayland would play into that, though.

The most intelligent way would be dropping the proprietary Desktop-GUIs anyway.
Switching to a web-based editor.
Then you can drop everything but Linux, and just ship docker containers.
Users connect via browser.
Saves a lot of work.
Also a lot more secure.

All you need to ship per platform then is an icon and a startup link/shell-script.

Betreff: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS for Apple: Intel vs. arm


Hi all, esp. Peter,

So I wonder what the new announcement of Apple switching everything from Intel to arm architecture will mean for our project? According to Apple they will switch all of their devices to arm over the next 2 years.

Will it be a lot of work to adapt the build system to the new processor architecture? It will probably mean that we will need an additional Mac build server for arm architecture in our infrastructure and will have to provide packages for both systems for many years to come ...

Not so nice for us as a project - can we forward these costs to Apple for that move?

Greetings,
Andreas

One point I've in mind with my GDAL hat on is that GDAL has a number of x86 specific speed 
optimizations using SIMD intrinsincs in warping/reprojection resampling, overview/rasterio 
resampling, statistics computation, hillshading, gdalgrid. Currently we have no accelaration 
for other architectures.

The issue is likely QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions() with no driverName set. There's 
no extension based guessing. Probably that the SaveVectorOptions inner class could have a 
"GPKG" default value for driverName, as it is the default driver name in other methods of 
qgsvectorfilewriter.h

There are some usage examples of QgsVectorFileWriter in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgsvectorfilewriter.py  
(not of create() though)

Hi,

Yes, I also heard about the better energy efficiency of the arm 
processor. That's probably the main reason why typical mobile devices 
almost never run on Intel processors. What effect the change to arm will 
have performance wise, esp. when libraries aren't yet optimized for that 
processor, is another matter.

Even already confirmed that some gdal algorithms are optimized for Intel 
only, so far.

And it will be significant work for some (Peter?) and will probably need 
additional funding to do this work.

I don't blame Apple on this. It's a good move if hardware will go 
greener because of this. But I expect QGIS to perform worse on MacOS arm 
because of this change initially, until more optimizations towards arm 
processors are in place.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS for Apple: Intel vs. arm

In addition to what Even mentioned, QGIS might also hit some performance
issues/bugs on the new platform. For example, the rule-based rendering with
expressions that contains LIKE will make QGIS project completely unusable
on iOS:
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/input/issues/433

This could be an inefficient way of how the expression engine handles LIKE
and has not shown up in other platforms. So in addition to making the
binaries available, we should be prepared for some strange new issues
propping up on the new platform!

Kind regards
Saber

Message-ID: <CAL5Q6701eNAT22+JPi0AOH_fd8MrX1OS4CO571pZs=7uexF4Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As a follow up of the recent discussion about QGIS Server market
share we have organized a kick start meeting to discuss QGIS Server Development.

Thursday 2 July 2020 - 14:00-16:00  (UTC+2) on
https://meet.jit.si/qgis-server-developer-meeting-2020

(but be ready to jump on Zoom kindly offered by Jorge Gustavo Rocha if
we have any connection issue)

The meeting scope is to define where we want to go with the server, in
other words define
our long term strategy and goals for server development.

A single meeting won't probably be enough, so (also depending on how
many people will join the works) we could split topics and create
smaller workgroups if needed, then collect the findings in future
meetings.

IMO this is a list of the main topics that we should address:

1. define the QGIS server project goals: what kind of product we want
to develop (we might well decide that what we currently have is all we
need)
2. discuss the "market share" and the "competitors" and what QGIS Server lacks

I started a shared online doc with a proposal for the agenda, feel
free to edit but please let's stay focused on the big picture for the
time being, we can discuss implementation details later:
https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/qgis-server-meeting-2020-agenda-9he7?lang=en

Kind regards.

PS: many thanks to Paul Blottiere for helping with setting this up!

This works fine for me:

md = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().providerMetadata('ogr')
conn = md.createConnection('/tmp/test_no_geometry.gpkg', {})
conn.createVectorTable('', 'my_table', QgsFields(),
QgsWkbTypes.NoGeometry, QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(), True, {})
layer = QgsVectorLayer('/tmp/test_no_geometry.gpkg', 'pg', 'ogr')
layer.isValid() --> True
layer.geometryType() --> 4 == NullGeometry

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server: parameters
 QGIS_SERVER_CACHE_DIRECTORY and QGIS_SERVER_CACHE_SIZE
Message-ID: <d71102578b9778c482323ef147189a5d@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am trying to find out under what circumstances QGIS server uses these
two parameters: 

QGIS_SERVER_CACHE_DIRECTORY and QGIS_SERVER_CACHE_SIZE 

as described in
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/config.html#qgis-server-cache-directory


Is this relevant when QGIS server also acts as a relay for another
network service, like loading tiles or data from another WMTS-server/WFS
server or from xyz tile sources? 

Perhaps it would be useful to add this information to the documentation?
I could do a PR if I know exactly what this cache directory is used for?


What happens in case multiple QGIS server instances would point to the
same cache directory? Would it work or be a cause for troubles? 

Thanks if you have any hints, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAJ0kcBMPTQWy0AeaUn3bbfuCOyfUhjzkmd=XB4_YNNDH73SX4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear developers,

I have developed a plugin for the Police of the Czech Republic for Search
and Rescue operations. It works quite well, but one important feature is
missing.

After the search event is finished the user should enter the result of the
search.

I was not able to find a way to catch an event when the user closes the
whole QGIS. I need similar functionality like when closing in the case of a
dirty project (no all changes were saved).

I have searched a lot and did not find any solution. I was able to catch
the unload event of the plugin, but I did not find a way to keep QGIS
opened.

Any help appreciated

Hi Alessandro,
Thanks a lot for setting this up. I'll be there !

Just a side note, jitsi often fails with peer <> peer strange connexions
issues. Zoom is more reliable, but we also start using Big Blue Button as
an open source alternative. It works nicely when hosted with enough
resources. This instance proves to be efficient enough for trainings:

Hi all,
For my third week I didn't have time to work on the QGIS 3D project because
of school projects. I had 3 of them in different subjects and had to send
them the same week.
Fortunately I finished my school work and will not have this issue again.
Here is the report that I should have done earlier:

   - Tasks done:
      - Got the directional lights implementation merged into the main QGIS
      repository.
      - Discussed the 3D export feature with mentors.
   - Tasks to be done:
      - Finish the other pull request and get it merged as soon as possible.
      - Start working on the 3D exporting feature and making classes for
      managing .obj files.
   - Blocking issues: this week I didn't have time to work on QGIS 3D
   because I had 3 school projects to deliver the same week all in different
   subjects. Fortunately I finished all my school work and will not have
   problems like that again.

You can find the report here as well:
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Improving_qgis_3d
I apologize again for not reporting my situation properly beforehand.
Best wishes,

I saw that there is a aboutToQuit signal emitted just before a QApplication
exists. The following works from QGIS Python Console.

def test():
    with open('/tmp/test.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('wrote while exiting')

qApp.aboutToQuit.connect(test)

Since the latest weekly OSGeo4W snapshots is still QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.11.0-8
25-Feb-2020, wouldn't it be appropriate to remove the information of the
weekly snapshot availability from the Website?

It is reported here:
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-windows-weekly
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blame/master/source/site/forusers/alldownloads.rst#L70-L73
"For users that cannot use OSGeo4W for some reason or just prefer it there
is also a weekly snapshot of qgis-dev from OSGeo4W as standalone installer
(taken on monday). In the feature freeze phase that also acts as release
candidate."

and here:

Thank you very much, the same is possible in the unload method of the
plugin, but the question is how to stop QGIS to exit.
I need to inform the user that he did not enter the result of the search
and keep QGIS open for the user to enter the result.

The possible workaround may be, to run the QGIS again, when it quits, but I
thought that there may be some better way.

Hi Régis,

Thank you for the proposal, I trust your experience: let's try BBB
instead of Jitsi.

I will create a "room" shortly before the meeting and send the link
via email in this thread, stay tuned!

The way to achieve this would be to override the closeEvent() method of the
main QGIs Window. I don't know how to do that. But you can do that on your
plugin widget - which will at least prevent that dialog to be closed if
certain conditions are not met.

    def closeEvent(self, event):
      if condition:
        event.accept()
      else:
        event.ignore()

Hi,

I saw this site:

I don't think it respects the QGIS trademark. who normally take care of
these situations?

Hi Alex,

I think PSC should take about such issues. We have an extra e-mail 
address for asking questions / reporting issues around trademark usage 
and violation: 
https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/trademark/index.html#if-in-doubt-find-out

It's the part of the PSC work that we hate the most ...

That website you quote looks very unfinished and there isn't even an 
address associated with it ...

Greetings,

Andreas

Hi,

I will try to contact the person that shared it on Facebook, and send him
that information.

Thanks,

Hi,

I was able to contact the page owner. He didn't realize that there was a
trademark. He promised to change the site name and domain.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [SoC] GSoC 2020 - Coding Period Week 4 Report
Message-ID: <CAGiKOuj6B9vgLmhGKm2N54PjUzxOR4cR6m9p5yg2u8AVzXJMOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
During the fourth week I started working on the scene exporting feature.
After discussing the feature with mentors, we decided to use wavefront .obj
files.
Here is my report for this week:

   - Tasks done:
      - Fixing some bugs in the vector layer texturing PR
      - Documenting about wavefront .obj files format.
      - Started implementing the scene exporter.
      - Made a branch in my github fork where I will be implementing the
      scene export feature that you can see at github
      <https://github.com/NEDJIMAbelgacem/QGIS/tree/export-scene-feature>
   - Tasks to be done:
      - Get the scene exporting feature working for the vector layer and
      specially QgsTessellatedPolygonGeometry class.
      - Try to do the 3D export feature using Qt3D's QEntity and QGeometry
      only.
      - Figure out how to save materials (associate .mtl files).
   - Blocking issues: Currently I'm trying to figure out how to get
   triangle position data out of Qt3DRender::QBuffer class using the
   Qt3DRender::QAttribute.

You can find the report here as well:
https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Improving_qgis_3d
If you have any suggestions or feedback please let me know.
Best wishes,

Just a warning that some functions are part of multiple different
groups, so the "group" value here would actually need to be a list.

But otherwise +1

Thank you. As you wrote, the problem is that this works only for the
Widged of the plugin. There is not a way to override the closeEvent()
method of the main QGIS Window from the plugin, since the plugin has only
an interface given by the QGIS.

I have decided to use the workaround for now, so when the QGIS is closed it
will start again. The solution is not so perfect, but at least it is a
solution.

Another way to do this is to rewrite C++ code. The code is not so
complicated and I can rewrite it, but then I have to build QGIS for all
police stations and keep it updated and it is not so simple for me.

Thank you again

Not sure how to intercept the quit action cleanly, but you can
intercept the "X" button click:

class NoClose(QObject):

    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)

    def ok_to_close(self):
        return False

    def eventFilter(self, object, event):
        if isinstance(event, QCloseEvent):
            if not self.ok_to_close():
                event.ignore()
                return True

        return super().eventFilter( object, event )

no_close = NoClose()
iface.mainWindow().installEventFilter(no_close)

Thank you very much. That works perfectly and I think that they will
usually use the X button.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS testing workflow with QgsMultiRenderChecker
	(on Windows and Travis)
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3VmDF=Cm6pJcv+8bCg7fx_zNGpCa1bmrnHOBCWV_BMdg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm struggling a little bit with tests using QgsMultiRenderChecker.

1/ Running the tests *on Windows*, I get some small rendering differences
with fonts that make tests fail. I'm getting the warnings below, both with
the font installed in my system or not. It seems to load the font with a
different size (20.1429 instead of 20) and as normal instead of bold, which
would explain why the test fail. Any idea why this happens, and how to fix
it ?

..\src\core\qgsfontutils.cpp(311) :
(QgsFontUtils::getStandardTestFont) [1372ms] Inexact font match -
consider installing the QGIS Vera Sans font.
..\src\core\qgsfontutils.cpp(312) :
(QgsFontUtils::getStandardTestFont) [0ms] Requested: QGIS Vera
Sans,20,-1,5,75,0,0,0,0,0,Bold
..\src\core\qgsfontutils.cpp(314) :
(QgsFontUtils::getStandardTestFont) [2ms] Replaced:  QGIS Vera
Sans,20.1429,47,5,75,0,0,0,0

2/ The QgsLayoutChecker tests outputs some HTML view of the failing tests,
allowing for a nice comparison of expected vs rendered images. When I run
the tests locally, I can redirect the output to a report.html file, then
see it in the browser (rather hacky, as all the test output goes in the
file, so it's not at all a proper html file, but it works).
Is it possible to somehow retrieve these results *from Travis *runs ? That
would be very helpful to workaround 1/.

Thanks !!

Olivier

	credibility
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_H67iVeMz4=gRAPax_3c9WGV0-DRAfnC=bmn-JtK=PQ2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been looking into the Portuguese translations of the GUI and the
Docs, and I got really scared. Many translations were done completely out
of context, making it very hard to read or understand what was
originally written in English, even if you are familiar with the
terminology.

I don't know how other languages are going, and if you face the same
problems. In Portugal, we have a very small community. Because of that,
translation efforts are not really coordinated or even reviewed in most
cases.

Now, the biggest problem is that I think this deeply affects QGIS
credibility. When you install QGIS, it defaults to the machine's locale,
and many users don't even know how to change it (seen it in several
courses). This means that many people will only know the badly translated
version of QGIS in their native language... and It looks bad.

In training, people sometimes make fun of the translations. I always
enforce the idea that the translation work is fully done by volunteers in
their spare time, but I am afraid if for some people it just looks like the
full application was done by volunteers and hobbyists.

So, I wanted to know if more of you face the same issues. If so, would it
be wiser to default the language always to English and let the user find
out how to change to his language if he wants to?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

What about a predefined allow list of "high quality translations"? And
we'd only default to using the local language IF it's part of this
predefined list...

As far as I know, the italian translation suffer the same problem, not
about quality, but about resources to give continuity to translation work.
Spanish community, instead, is more focused in translations (different
official languages) than in features or bugfixing.

That would be a nice idea if we can ensure that there are enough native
speakers available for doing the reviews and confirm that a certain
language is ok to go. It's a really hard job, and it's always on the move.
But, yes, maybe an overall appreciation could be enough to get the stamp of
quality.

Please notice that my worries are not the lack of translation of many
strings, that is kind of ok to me. The problem are the badly translated
ones.

The move to transifex made the translations available to many more
translators, and we got more strings translated, but... while the
QtLinguist translations had in some cases the GUI as context, transifex
doesn't.

Besides, at least in Portuguese, some people are more worried in quantity
than in quality. Unfortunately, Transifex don't make it easy to find all
the translation done by a bad translator... at least that I know of.

Hi!

While we've got a lot more languages and translations now I share your
concerns too.
After all (and you alreade mentioned it) it is all volunteer work.
There is still the option of reviews on transifex, but I am a bit
concerned that translations AND reviews would be too much for some
languages.
The idea of having english as default language and let the user decide
if he wants to switch to the native language (probably with a warning
that the translation is done by volunteers) is a good one, but what to
do with the people who do not (or only a little) speak english?

Having good translations is hard work.

regards
Werner

Dear All,

thanks,
if I may express that here:

for QGIS I am probably less concerned about an off comma and strange-funny
term
in the major EU languages (most of them are techno-anglicised anyways) .

I rather care for text software versions of QGIS in Suaheli, Arab
languages, Pidgin, Hindi, Mandarin and Esperanto.

I believe that's where much of the QGIS power really sits, and for
applications and 'markets'.

Please do not forget those,
instead a focus just on a few  upset vanity users in Germany etc.

Just my view and from experience.

With kind worldly open source regards

          Falk Huettmann

ciao to everyone, let me show you the Italian situation.

1) the use of QGIS in Italy, especially in the Public Administration,
continues to spread more and more.
When I say "Public Administration" I do not mean only the Ministries or
other big public organizations, but above all small Municipalities also
with a few hundred inhabitants, whose technicians begin to see the
possibility of using for many subjects no longer the CAD but (Q)GIS.
During the Central Italy 2016 Earthquake, we installed QGIS in more than
200 Municipalities, in order to manage the complex phase of post-earthquake
surveys of private buildings.
Well, I assure you that if QGIS had been only in English, the chances that
the technicians and volunteers would use QGIS, would have been very low.
The fact that the default language in QGIS is the local one is a
consolation and safety for the user.

2) matteo ghetta, paolo cavallini and I are the coordinators of the Italian
translation team. There are more than 60 people registered in Transifex,
but there are very few active ones.
The work flow is this: anyone can translate, but only one is the reviewer
(me). This helps to have a unique (or almost) translation style and allows
revisions and corrections on strings to spread immediately over all the
other similar ones in the various versions of QGIS available.
This is the reason why I don't like having strings of versions 3.4 and 3.8
in Transifex: I work on "All resources" and therefore when I make massive
corrections I have errors due to the presence of these strings that are no
longer editable.

3) In Italy the interest in the translation of QGIS (GUI, site and
documentation) is high; As part of summer webinars organized by the
GFOSS.it association, on July 9 I will hold a short webinar on tricks and
good practices for translating in Transifex and about twenty people have
already registered.

In conclusion, I believe that although there are sometimes obvious errors
in the translations that make the string incomprehensible, it is necessary
to persevere and continue to improve and push users to report errors or
omissions.
The choice of a single reviewer greatly limits the possibility of errors,
even if the various evolutions of the resources of QGIS in Transifex has
led to having thousands of strings that had already been revised to be
again unreviewed, frustrating the work of months.
But that's okay; Transifex is exceptional even if it is hateful not to have
the context in which the string is used.
And please don't make English the default language.

thank you and forgive my Italianglish: when I translate QGIS from English
to Italian I am more accurate :-D

Hi,

For my information, what is the downside of using spatialite instead of
geopackage apart from the weight of the file ? Are these issues an issue
with spatialite also?

yes -- it's coming from the underlying sqlite format which is used by
both spatialite/geopackage

Hi Olivier,

Maybe this helps. You can run build in debug mode in travis. I usually just
make a private repo with a minimum script to run that said tests. Then you
can ssh into the build.
But this doesn't work in windows type build.

One other workaround I can think of is to just send the output file
somewhere.
When you run your travis job from your own repo, you can set the
environment variable yourself. You can put secrets there in the environment
in your repo's Travis settings (not in the repo, because the repo is
public, I assume).
For example, in the past I have tried to put my docker credentials to push
the built image and have it sent to docker hub with all necessary build
output inside, so I can look it up later.
If you just need the output, maybe sending the files over ssh/rsync will do.

Regards,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Experience in QGIS as App-V installation?
Message-ID: <2a32a234c1a82110e0262152880fcc3c@carto.net>

Hi, 

Does someone on this lists (user and developer list) have experience
with installing QGIS in App-V mode? 

Are there any blockers or problems? Is this a recommended way to run
QGIS on Windows? 

Thanks for sharing any experiences you have with this technology. 

Andreas

Slightly more convenient is to use locally the Docker build method that is 
used by QGIS
See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker#building

Dear developers:

As a former translator of the Danish version of QGIS I have a few - very 
personal, perhaps a bit caustic - comments:

  * The transfer from using QT linqguist to Transifex was a mistake from
    my POW. Without the user interface context is sometimes impossible
    to translate correctly. My method (around ver. 2.12) was to use a
    simple editor like notepad++ on the raw xml translator files and get
    a significant part of the job done. And afterward using QT-Linguist
    to get the difficult translations. From that standpoint Transifex is
    simply a delaying factor.
  * The translation effort is very important. Even in Denmark , where
    the population generally is competent in English, the majority of
    "ordinary" users prefer using QGIS with the Danish translation. I
    assume, that the situation is the same or more pressing for most
    countries.
  * The translation is difficult and time consuming and you are not
    being compensated for your effort. Throw some money or prestige
    after it. Even a small token would help.
  * Treat the translation effort with respect. Don't ridicule people's
    earnest efforts. Think how you would react If you were a rookie
    developer and the first reaction from an old shark was ridicule of
    your programming efforts ?
  * Make the translation stage a significant step in the development cycle.
  * Create a group or list of highly technical GIS related terms that is
    *not* to be translated. There is a lot of GIS terms that is English
    in origin, but haven't a well defined local translation. (With some
    hilarious results if they are translated). Not all translators is
    well versed in every aspect of GIS.

Hi Even, Hi Rizky,

Thanks for your answers ! I just learned from Matthias about the existence
of cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org (for which there's a tinyurl link at the bottom
of each travis run) that actually has exactly what I needed (for example
https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=20613873&build=46050).

Cheers,

Olivier

Is this something that OSGEO can help to oversee and/or maintain as I
suspect that this list would be useful across many projects.

Hi Team ,

          I don't have much experience in coding. Earlier I have created
some simple QGis models in 2.14(.model) using graphic modeller. But now i
am using QGis 3.10. Now I have created some models.It is in *.model3* format.
I am unable to use my old models.

Earlier QGis Version :2.14.7
Current QGis version: 3.10
Problem: Unable to open old models in QGis3.0 version
Expectation:steps to convert .model to .model3 format

Expecting your reply

That is correct. Terms like "Hillshade", "Ruggedness index" and and a 
*lot* of other terms doesn't have a "proper" translation (at least in 
Danish). I assume that's the case for a lot of languages.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can't get "qgis_global_settings.ini" working with
	QGIS 3.10 LTR
Message-ID: <AEC992FF-55B9-4286-B82E-64BF4BA50038@kubler.org>

Hi,

(This message is mostly a copy of the GitHub issue I opened here yesterday : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37482)


I'm trying to deploy QGIS (3.10.7-A Coruña) and a few plugins in a corporate environment under macOS >= 10.14.

I'd like to put the plugins in their own directory (i.e. /Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/plugins/) so I can easily upgrade things independently.

My idea was to create a global config file with customEnvVars set to "append|QGIS_PLUGINPATH=/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/plugins/" and customEnvVarsUse set to true (+maybe some other stuff).

From what I've read here and there (and also from QGIS source code), putting a file named qgis_global_settings.ini in one of the StandardPaths should be enough for QGIS to pick it up.
(That’s what I see when looking at QGIS/src/app/main.cpp on line 908).

But for some reason, it just doesn’t work :-(


If I launch QGIS from the command line with the --globalsettingsfile option set to /Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/plugins/, it works as expected (but that's obviously not a solution for the end-users).

Also, I did some testings today and it seems to work as expected with QGIS 3.14.


Is there something special to do to get it working with the LTR version ?
Or is this related to something that’s been fixed after 3.10 ? In this case, are you planning to backport this ?

Thanks a lot for your hard and precious work,

Message-ID: <004e01d64efa$bb649510$322dbf30$@yahoo.com.br>

Hi devs,

 

I still can not get the triangular mesh from a Mesh Layer using Qgis version
3.14.0-Pi.

The triangularMesh() attribute is present in the API documentation

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMeshLayer.html#ae5d4ae367cfbd2abf6920d26701f014
3. 

But I get an Error:

AttributeError: 'QgsMeshLayer' object has no attribute 'triangularMesh'

 

 

Is it possible to return the triangular mesh? I would like to use the
triangular mesh for make an exact profile/cross section from the mesh using
a polyline. The others plugins, like Crayfish and Profile tools does this
profile using a defined interval offset, so it's accuracy depends on this
interval.

 

My code below returns

AttributeError: 'QgsMeshLayer' object has no attribute 'triangularMesh'

:

proj = QgsProject.instance()

mdtLyr = proj.mapLayersByName("RA04_Surface")[0]

mdtLyr.updateTriangularMesh()

triang = mdtLyr.triangularMesh()

 

Best regards,

 

Jorge Almerio

That probably depends on the topography and ruggedness in your country 
;-) in german language we have translations for these terms:

"Analytische Schattierung" or "Schummerung" and "Rauhigkeitsindex".

Forgive my not so "serious" response here.

Greetings,
Andreas

But we have 40 words for 'flat' Andreas! :P


Same problem for the Dutch language, some translations are too literally 
and usually really funny but not helpful at all if you want to 
understand QGIS.
I often tell people in my course to consider using English. It is not 
just more clear and accurate, but also easier when you need to google 
your way around in QGIS. Googling for 'uitdrukking voor mazen berekenen' 
will not give you many QGIS related results.

I like the idea of installing English by default, or better, let the 
user choose during or right after installation. This way it is a more 
conscious choice.

I also like the idea of having a .tr_ignore list with terminology that 
should not be translated. But it will indeed be different for every 
language. So maybe local dk_ignore, nl_ignore, de_ignore? Maintained by 
the local translation teams?

Recently I was translating Input on transifex and was pleased by the 
screen shots they added. They gave me a lot of context and I'm sure they 
made my translations more accurate. Could we use that in QGIS as well?

And a bout the laughing people during courses, just tell them they can 
fix it themselves and are very welcome to. Then they usually turn very 
quiet.

Raymond

Hi,

The triangular mesh of mesh layer is not accessible from the python API,
only from the C++ API.

So for now, not possible to access directly to the triangular mesh from
Python. It is possible to acces ro the native from  the provider, but it
will not be in the map coordinates if different from the data :
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsMeshDataSourceInterface.html#module-QgsMeshDataSourceInterface

I do the same.

That would definitely be the best option.

In the Portuguese team, what we are thinking to do is add some terminology
to transifex glossary with the english source as the final translation,
forcing translator not to change those.

I believe that's a paid functionality, not sure we can do it. But yes, that
would help a lot. Although, its still probably hard to maintain for QGIS
GUI, because it has so many dialogs.

Me too.

Maybe I am overreacting, my biggest worry is that some folks use the
"funny" translations as an excuse to say that QGIS is not a professional
software.

Hi to all,
I share the same concern of Alexandre. I did a lot a translation in the
past. I started in 2014 and give a boost of in the pt_pt translations. At
the time I was unemployed and did a lot of the pt_pt translations until I
start to work.

I reduce my participation in translations since 2015 but recently I realise
as well that translation for pt_PT start to have a lot of words out of the
context and things that not make sense, in Docs and GUI. What I started to
do was after I had the permission of Warner and Jurgen to be a reviewer and
coordinator I start to review and block strings to reduce the "noise" in
translation but is a gigantic work for volunteer.

Jurgen about pt_pt and pt_br translations don't disrespect the Brazilian
community and their work, we have different approaches about translations.
Most of the times we have things called English foreign words that are
adopted in pt_PT because there isn´t a correct translation (ex.: snapping,
threshold) and sometimes doesn't sound very good in pt_PT. In pt_BR most of
the words are translated, but when these terms are used in pt_PT
translations Portuguese users don't understand the terms and turn more
difficult to learn and they eventually give up or switch back to English in
GUI and Documentation.

About what Raymond said, I as well with the help of Nelson translate the
Input App and Qfield and in the case of Input, help a lot to have the
screenshots because give some context.

I like as well the idea of installing English by default, or let the user
choose during or right after installation.

One of the things that Qt Linguist have and sometimes I try to use when I
do the translation is to have QGIS source code and open Qt Linguist to see
how strings stay on the dialogue through preview dialogue.

The first thought I had specific for pt_pt was to communicate to pt_pt
translations that are registered in Transifex. Block temporarily pt_pt
translation, review all the translated strings and then invite again all
users. This can help the job of reviewers and reduce the problem of out of
context texts.

A word technical dictionary (Glossary of transifex don't work very well but
is my opinion) can help as well.
And use the comments tabs of transifex, to share knowledge and discuss
strings, I try to do this inside transifex to communicate with other users
because the comments are saved and can be seen in the cause of future
doubts.

I hope that my thoughts help for this discussion. Stay safe.

Cheers,
João (aka James)

That's correct -- it's a new feature in 3.14. See
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/35956

It looks relatively risk free to backport, but would need to wait till 3.10.9
