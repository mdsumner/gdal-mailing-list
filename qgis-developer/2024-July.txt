Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WKT from QgsGeometry incompatible with OGR
Message-ID: <57abd9f6-f4fa-4ff2-a3f1-31a50f5c71aa@gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

Could you please tell me why the QgsGeometry::asWkt method returns the 
names of geometry types with the Z coordinate without a space (PointZ 
instead of Point Z, etc.)? This value is not compatible with ogr.

A minimal example is below. Executing it will return an exception: 
"RuntimeError: OGR Error: Corrupt data"

from osgeo import ogr

qgis_geometyry = QgsGeometry().fromWkt("POINT Z (0 0 0)")
wkt = qgis_geometyry.asWkt() # 'PointZ (0 0 0)'
ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt(wkt)

Both formats are compliant with the WKT specifications. This should rather
be filed as a feature request for GDAL to support the forms without a space.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qgis task slows down main Qgis process
Message-ID: <AM9P190MB144482A1FC30993149E8C171C8DF2@AM9P190MB1444.EURP190.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,
I am currently developing a plugin with PyQGIS and have a question regarding QGIS Task. The documentation states that the run method is executed in parallel and is developed in C++. However, from my experience, I notice that whenever a large computation (with NumPy in my case) is being performed inside a QGIS task, the performance of the code running in the main QGIS thread is significantly slowed down.
I have no computation in the method that runs after the thread. Is this slowdown due to the Python GIL?
Sincerely,
Ali

Are they? I may have missed something in the Simple Features spec, but 
looking at https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=25355 , I can't see 
where it would allow the form {geometryTypeName}Z without a space 
between {geometryTypeName} and Z.

For example the BNF at page 56 shows:

<point z tagged text> ::= point z <point z text>

The examples at page 62 also show a space.

Hi,

I second Even argument and I would prefer to change QGIS implementation. 
It does not make sense to have QGIS WKT strings not compatible with 
other Python tools (based on GEOS/JTS, like shapely, for example) and ogr.

 >>> import shapely
 >>> shapely.to_wkt(shapely.Point(0, 0, 0))
'POINT Z (0 0 0)'
 >>> shapely.from_wkt('POINT Z (0 0 0)')
<POINT Z (0 0 0)>

Regards,

Jorge? Gustavo

Hi Nyall,

I would say that the focus (on the examples in 6.1.2.6.4) is the 
LocateAlong and LocateBetween methods and the examples used are less 
carefully written. Next to each other, examples on 6.1.2.6.3 and 
6.1.2.6.4 seem written by different contributors.

Page 52 says: "The Well-known Text Representation of Geometry is defined 
below using BNF". That's the WKT representation definition, even if we 
can find some examples failing this notation.

We could support both in QGIS. We can eventually read (parse) both 
notations to keep them consistent with previous WKT outputs, but we 
should write using the BNF notation.

Regards,

Jorge

Anyway, it looks like also "PointZ" and "PointM" (besides "POINT Z" and 
"POINT M") are recognised by shapely (2.0.3 with GEOS 3.12.2):

 >>> shapely.from_wkt('PointZ (0 0 0)')
<POINT Z (0 0 0)>
 >>> shapely.from_wkt('PointM (0 0 0)')
<POINT M (0 0 0)>

Moreover, ogr (OGR/GDAL 3.9.1) recognises "PointM" (but not "PointZ"):

 >>> ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt('PointM (0 0 0)').ExportToIsoWkt()
'POINT M (0 0 0)'

I've went ahead and added support for PointZ like WKT strings in OGR in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/10370, but it would be probably 
better that QGIS writes conformant WKT by default (I suspect that fixing 
this has the potential of breaking a number of tests though)

Hi Even,

I already saw your PR. It is really nice to all our tools talking 
smoothly to each other. Thanks for the improvement.

Seems like quite easy to change QGIS code. The major impact are these 15 
tests:

 ??????? 227 - test_core_geometry_circularstring (Failed)
 ??????? 228 - test_core_geometry_compoundcurve (Failed)
 ??????? 229 - test_core_geometry_curvepolygon (Failed)
 ??????? 231 - test_core_geometry_linestring (Failed)
 ??????? 232 - test_core_geometry_multicurve (Failed)
 ??????? 233 - test_core_geometry_multilinestring (Failed)
 ??????? 234 - test_core_geometry_multipoint (Failed)
 ??????? 235 - test_core_geometry_multipolygon (Failed)
 ??????? 236 - test_core_geometry_multisurface (Failed)
 ??????? 237 - test_core_geometry_point (Failed)
 ??????? 239 - test_core_geometry_polygon (Failed)
 ??????? 240 - test_core_geometry_quadrilateral (Failed)
 ??????? 243 - test_core_geometry_triangle (Failed)
 ??????? 244 - test_core_geometry (Failed)
 ??????? 245 - test_core_geometrycollection (Failed)

I'll take a look at them and provide more feedback.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Transition from QtWebKit to QtWebEngine in
 qgis2web (QGIS plugin)
Message-ID: <SGAZSI$30D172754494A36ADC025D0FF69D7794@opengis.it>


   Dear QGIS Developers,

   I am currently maintaining the qgis2web plugin and am in the process of phasing out QtWebKit due to its obsolescence and inability to handle modern code.

   qgis2web utilizes QtWebKit to display its export in a web preview window, which reads the exported project comprising HTML, JS, and CSS files. Without updating QtWebKit, I cannot update the third-party libraries used in the export (e.g., ol-geocoder, ol-layerswitcher, and many others).

   I've found numerous unresolved discussions about QtWebEngine online, but they haven't helped me achieve my goal.

   Here is my current setup:
     * Windows 10
     * Standard QGIS installation (not OSGeo4W), version: 3.36.3-Maidenhead
     * PyQt version: 5.15.10
     * Qt version: 5.15.13

   Progress so far:
    1. Using "Qt Designer," dragging the "QWebEngineView" element into the plugin design causes the program to freeze. This issue is resolved after installing the dependency in the next step.
    2. The standard installation via .msi lacks the QtWebEngine dependency, so I had to install it manually. This is a significant obstacle: I believe most QGIS users install the software on Windows using the .msi package, so I will need to provide a guide or come up with a solution for installation through the plugin itself. In any case, I installed the dependency by opening the "OSGeo4W Shell" and running the command:
       python -m pip install PyQtWebEngine
       Then, using
       pip list
       I confirmed the dependencies are now:
       PyQtWebEngine 5.15.6
       PyQtWebEngine-Qt5 5.15.2
    3. At this point, I was able to write the following Python code and receive a positive output
       try:
           from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEngineProfile, QWebEnginePage, QWebEngineSettings
           webengine_available = True
           print("QtWebEngine available")
       except ImportError as e:
           webengine_available = False
           print("QtWebEngine not available:", e)
    4. In "Qt Designer" I can now add the "QWebEngineView" element without issues, and if I set a website manually by configuring the URL in the "QWebEngineView" section, it displays perfectly.

   Where I am stuck:
    1. Writing from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets results in an error.
    2. Whether I add the "QWebEngineView" element manually in "Qt Designer" or via Python, the result is a completely blank plugin screen. The code I am testing for insertion is as follows:
       if webengine_available:
           print("WebEngine is available. Initializing QWebEngineView...")
           widget = QWebEngineView()
           self.preview = widget
           try:
               self.preview.setUrl(QUrl("https://opengis.it"))
               print("Loading opengis.it in QWebEngineView.")
           except Exception as e:
               print("Failed to set URL:", e)
       else:
           print("WebEngine is not available. Initializing QTextBrowser...")
           widget = QTextBrowser()
           widget.setText(self.tr('Preview is not available since QtWebEngine dependency is missing on your system'))
           print("QTextBrowser initialized with fallback message.")
       self.right_layout.insertWidget(0, widget)
       print("Widget inserted into right_layout.")

   Questions:
    1. Since QtWebKit was deprecated in Qt 5.6, why does it still work in version 5.15.13?
    2. Why isn't the QtWebEngine dependency included by default in the .msi installation?
    3. Why doesn't from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets work?
    4. Why is there a discrepancy between what I see and configure in "Qt Designer" and what appears when I run the plugin in QGIS (specifically, a completely blank screen)?

   Current Status:

   I have no errors in the QGIS Python console, only positive prints, but I cannot get past the blank plugin screen when launched in QGIS.

   Thank you all for your valuable work, which allows me to perform my beloved job.

   Best regards

Hi!

I have not got access to a system to actually try my answers so some of 
them are educated speculation, but hopefully they'll help you in the 
right direction anyway:

* Have you tried if the python3-pyqtwebengine package in the 
OSGeo4W-installer installs the required dependency?
* (question 1) It's still (while on Qt 5) possible to build QtWebKit 
from source, as the OSGeo4W-packagers seem to have done for you: 
https://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/v2/x86_64/release/qt5/qtwebkit/
* (question 2) QtWebEngine is essentially a repackaged and slightly 
adapted Chromium; the same engine that powers the Chrome browser. That 
means installing QtWebEngine pulls in almost as much code as installing 
another browser, the same happens for QtWebKit (which is a repackaging 
of the WebKit browser engine). So if both would be installed by default 
then users would essentially get two additional browsers taking up space 
on their system
* (question 3) qgis.PyQt does not export everything from PyQt{version}, 
but only what is specified by QGIS 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/final-3_36_3/python/PyQt/CMakeLists.txt). 
In 3.36 this does not include QtWebEngineWidgets, however in 3.38 it 
does (which makes me assume that installing QGIS 3.38 through OSGeo4W 
will also pull in QtWebEngine automatically as you've requested).

Regards,
Jan Dalheimer

Message-ID: <CAB28Asgp7p1FRerdx+Q7M4erD4ehfQ2qFVzBMK8XdcoGj__thg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list!

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/299
for a newly filed QGIS enhancement proposal regarding advanced labeling
rules.

Advanced rules are project-level settings, which define specific
constraints which must be satisfied during rendering of maps for that
project.

Examples of advanced rules include:

- "Labels from the XX layer must be at least YY millimetres distant from
the features from the ZZ layer"
- "Labels from the XX layer must be at most YY millimetres distant from the
features from the ZZ layer"
- "Labels from the XX layer must be at least YY millimetres distant from
the labels from the ZZ layer"

Users can configure any combination of rules as desired, including multiple
copies of the same rule with different properties (eg different target
layers or different distances)

This will allow a very flexible means for users to fine-tune the exact
label logic for their maps, and provide a framework for more custom
advanced labeling rules to be implemented in future.

Please keep discussion on the linked GitHub ticket.

Dear Developers,

I have been experimenting for a while with QWebEngineView which opens a lot of possibilities for plugin development and started to implement a new plugin to explore and share layers directly from QGIS by simply dragging and dropping them from the layer panel.

Here is a short screen recording to see how it works:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5k74faBJKo

As there are a few things remaining to do, the plugin not yet uploaded to the plugin repo but it is mostly functional. Initial feedback from interested testers would be very useful!

Here is the GitHub repository to try it out:
https://github.com/jbp35/layer-atlas-plugin/

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Best regards,

Jean-Baptiste Peter

Dear Andreas,

I have been playing with QWebEngineView for a while and managed to get it to work using the recently updated default libs of Osgeo4W and the following code:
https://github.com/jbp35/layer-atlas-plugin/blob/main/Layer_Atlas_dockwidget.py

>From my understanding, two things still have to be addressed in order to ensure that it works in all cases on windows (I am not able to test on other platforms) :
- The .msi installer for windows needs to be upgraded to include PyQtWebEngine module version >= 5.15.6 (older versions won't work)
- SIP binding needs to be added in order to be able to import QWebChannel class from python console (this class is used to establish a bridge between python and HTML/JavaScript)

Best,

   Dear QGIS Developers,

   I am currently maintaining the qgis2web plugin and am in the process of phasing out QtWebKit due to its obsolescence and inability to handle modern code.

   qgis2web utilizes QtWebKit to display its export in a web preview window, which reads the exported project comprising HTML, JS, and CSS files. Without updating QtWebKit, I cannot update the third-party libraries used in the export (e.g., ol-geocoder, ol-layerswitcher, and many others).

   I've found numerous unresolved discussions about QtWebEngine online, but they haven't helped me achieve my goal.

   Here is my current setup:
     * Windows 10
     * Standard QGIS installation (not OSGeo4W), version: 3.36.3-Maidenhead
     * PyQt version: 5.15.10
     * Qt version: 5.15.13

   Progress so far:
    1. Using "Qt Designer," dragging the "QWebEngineView" element into the plugin design causes the program to freeze. This issue is resolved after installing the dependency in the next step.
    2. The standard installation via .msi lacks the QtWebEngine dependency, so I had to install it manually. This is a significant obstacle: I believe most QGIS users install the software on Windows using the .msi package, so I will need to provide a guide or come up with a solution for installation through the plugin itself. In any case, I installed the dependency by opening the "OSGeo4W Shell" and running the command:
       python -m pip install PyQtWebEngine
       Then, using
       pip list
       I confirmed the dependencies are now:
       PyQtWebEngine 5.15.6
       PyQtWebEngine-Qt5 5.15.2
    3. At this point, I was able to write the following Python code and receive a positive output
       try:
           from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEngineProfile, QWebEnginePage, QWebEngineSettings
           webengine_available = True
           print("QtWebEngine available")
       except ImportError as e:
           webengine_available = False
           print("QtWebEngine not available:", e)
    4. In "Qt Designer" I can now add the "QWebEngineView" element without issues, and if I set a website manually by configuring the URL in the "QWebEngineView" section, it displays perfectly.

   Where I am stuck:
    1. Writing from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets results in an error.
    2. Whether I add the "QWebEngineView" element manually in "Qt Designer" or via Python, the result is a completely blank plugin screen. The code I am testing for insertion is as follows:
       if webengine_available:
           print("WebEngine is available. Initializing QWebEngineView...")
           widget = QWebEngineView()
           self.preview = widget
           try:
               self.preview.setUrl(QUrl("https://opengis.it"))
               print("Loading opengis.it in QWebEngineView.")
           except Exception as e:
               print("Failed to set URL:", e)
       else:
           print("WebEngine is not available. Initializing QTextBrowser...")
           widget = QTextBrowser()
           widget.setText(self.tr('Preview is not available since QtWebEngine dependency is missing on your system'))
           print("QTextBrowser initialized with fallback message.")
       self.right_layout.insertWidget(0, widget)
       print("Widget inserted into right_layout.")

   Questions:
    1. Since QtWebKit was deprecated in Qt 5.6, why does it still work in version 5.15.13?
    2. Why isn't the QtWebEngine dependency included by default in the .msi installation?
    3. Why doesn't from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets work?
    4. Why is there a discrepancy between what I see and configure in "Qt Designer" and what appears when I run the plugin in QGIS (specifically, a completely blank screen)?

   Current Status:

   I have no errors in the QGIS Python console, only positive prints, but I cannot get past the blank plugin screen when launched in QGIS.

   Thank you all for your valuable work, which allows me to perform my beloved job.

   Best regards

   Oggetto [QGIS-Developer] Request for Initial Feedback on Layer Atlas Plugin

   Dear Developers,


   I have been experimenting for a while with QWebEngineView which opens a lot of possibilities for plugin development and started to implement a new plugin to explore and share layers directly from QGIS by simply dragging and dropping them from the layer panel.


   Here is a short screen recording to see how it works:

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5k74faBJKo


   As there are a few things remaining to do, the plugin not yet uploaded to the plugin repo but it is mostly functional. Initial feedback from interested testers would be very useful!


   Here is the GitHub repository to try it out:

   https://github.com/jbp35/layer-atlas-plugin/


   Thank you for your time and assistance!

I don?t think this will work with qgis installed using .msi as the installer does not include PyQtWebEngine.

It should work out of the box using qgis osgeo4W installer which includes the latest version of PyQtWebEngine (5.15.6) which is required for the plugin to work. There should not be any other dependencies.

Best,

Jean-Baptiste Peter

Did you install PyQtWebEngine ?manually? using pip install? If that is the case, it will not be bundled with qgis and needs to be imported from Pyqt directly:

?from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?

needs to be replaced by :

?from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?


As of now, the only way to get this working out of the box is to install qgis with Osgeo4W installer.

   Since version 3.38.0 the QtWebEngine export has been added back to qgis.PyQt as you can see here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/final-3_38_0/python/PyQt/CMakeLists.txt

   So by installing the standard QGIS .msi just add the dependency via "pip install QtWebEngine" and then use "from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets"

   In any case I just installed QGIS in win10 from the OSGeo4W installer adding only the "python3-pyqtwebengine" dependency and your plugin doesn't work. Crashes QGIS startup.

   Maybe do some testing on new installations.

   As for me, since I believe that most users use qgis via the .msi installation, not via OSGeo4W, it is important for me to understand what to have users install and my goal, when I will at least be able to start my plugin, will be to try to automate these dependencies.

   Isn't it the same for you? How do you solve this "problem"?

   For now I noticed this:

   with qgis 3.38.0 .msi installation this dependency is missing:

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   with OSGeo4W setup these dependencies are required:

   python3-core (3.12.4-1)
   Python core interpreter and runtime
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, python3-pyqt5-sip
   python3-pyqt5 (5.15.10-1)
   Python bindings for the Qt cross platform application toolkit
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine
   python3-pyqt5-sip (12.13.0-1)
   The sip module support for PyQt5
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5
   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine
   qt5-libs (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 runtime libraries
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, qt5-devel, qtwebkit-libs

   Did you install PyQtWebEngine ?manually? using pip install? If that is the case, it will not be bundled with qgis and needs to be imported from Pyqt directly:


   ?from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?


   needs to be replaced by :


   ?from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?



   As of now, the only way to get this working out of the box is to install qgis with Osgeo4W installer.

   I don?t think this will work with qgis installed using .msi as the installer does not include PyQtWebEngine.


   It should work out of the box using qgis osgeo4W installer which includes the latest version of PyQtWebEngine (5.15.6) which is required for the plugin to work. There should not be any other dependencies.

   Oggetto [QGIS-Developer] Request for Initial Feedback on Layer Atlas Plugin


   Dear Developers,


   I have been experimenting for a while with QWebEngineView which opens a lot of possibilities for plugin development and started to implement a new plugin to explore and share layers directly from QGIS by simply dragging and dropping them from the layer panel.


   Here is a short screen recording to see how it works:

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5k74faBJKo


   As there are a few things remaining to do, the plugin not yet uploaded to the plugin repo but it is mostly functional. Initial feedback from interested testers would be very useful!


   Here is the GitHub repository to try it out:

   https://github.com/jbp35/layer-atlas-plugin/


   Thank you for your time and assistance!

   Thanks Jan Dalheimer

   Thanks Jean-Baptiste Peter

   From your answers I understood many things.

   I tried both to use QGIS 3.38.0 installed in win10 via .msi and the version via OSGeo4W setup; In the first case I added qtwebengine via "pip install qtwebengine", in the second case I installed the "python3-pyqtwebengine" package via OsGeo4w setup

   In both installations I get the same result: QtWebEngine it does not work well

   I also tried to create a new test plugin and I get the same result, I can't even view a web page. Is there an example of a basic plugin that I can see? Or can someone create it?

   The clue:

   If I use qt designer to insert a QtWebEngineView into the plugin graphics it works well, even when setting a static web page.
   But if I open QGIS that plugin won't work, why does this happen? I would therefore think that it is just a question of dependency .

   For now I noticed this:
   1) From QGIS version 3.38.0 I can use "from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets import *" instead of "from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import *"

   2) with qgis 3.38.0 .msi installation this dependency is missing:

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)

   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   3) with OSGeo4W setup these dependencies are required:

   python3-core (3.12.4-1)

   Python core interpreter and runtime

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, python3-pyqt5-sip

   python3-pyqt5 (5.15.10-1)

   Python bindings for the Qt cross platform application toolkit

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   python3-pyqt5-sip (12.13.0-1)

   The sip module support for PyQt5

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)

   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   qt5-libs (5.15.13-1)

This is head spinning! For OSGeo4W install with "python3-pyqtwebengine" selected, are you testing this in a VM? I wonder if the crash at startup may be caused by the fact that qwebengineview is using opengl which is not working with emulated graphics. This works on my desktop.

I am sure for the .msi installer and will have to do further research.

   Hi, your question unblocked me.

   I'm using my "qgis2web" plugin and your "layer atlas" plugin in a laptop with integrated (not dedicated) video card and that's why I get white screen when I use our plugins. Using them on a desktop PC with a dedicated video card both work.

   Taking inspiration from the "HERE Maps for QGIS" plugin which works well on my laptop and which uses QtWebEngine, I understood that to make our plugins work we need to add a setting.

   In Layer_Atlas_dockwidget.py file edit:

   from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEngineSettings

   and add WebGLEnabled settings:

   class CustomWebEngineView(QWebEngineView):

       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

           super(CustomWebEngineView, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

           

           settings = self.settings()

           settings.setAttribute(QWebEngineSettings.WebGLEnabled, True)

   Your plugin will work perfectly even on PCs without a dedicated video card.

   Now you should configure automatic installation of the dependency in case it is not there. This way all users, even those who install via .msi, will be able to use your plugin. Always take inspiration from the "Here" plugin, I still have to finish the code but I'm almost done.

   Congratulations for the plugin, it works great and I think it is very useful.

   For now I noticed this:

   with qgis 3.38.0 .msi installation this dependency is missing:

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine



   with OSGeo4W setup these dependencies are required:

   python3-core (3.12.4-1)
   Python core interpreter and runtime
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, python3-pyqt5-sip
   python3-pyqt5 (5.15.10-1)
   Python bindings for the Qt cross platform application toolkit
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine
   python3-pyqt5-sip (12.13.0-1)
   The sip module support for PyQt5
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5
   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)
   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine
   qt5-libs (5.15.13-1)
   Qt5 runtime libraries

   Did you install PyQtWebEngine ?manually? using pip install? If that is the case, it will not be bundled with qgis and needs to be imported from Pyqt directly:


   ?from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?


   needs to be replaced by :


   ?from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView?



   As of now, the only way to get this working out of the box is to install qgis with Osgeo4W installer.

   I don?t think this will work with qgis installed using .msi as the installer does not include PyQtWebEngine.


   It should work out of the box using qgis osgeo4W installer which includes the latest version of PyQtWebEngine (5.15.6) which is required for the plugin to work. There should not be any other dependencies.

   Oggetto [QGIS-Developer] Request for Initial Feedback on Layer Atlas Plugin


   Dear Developers,


   I have been experimenting for a while with QWebEngineView which opens a lot of possibilities for plugin development and started to implement a new plugin to explore and share layers directly from QGIS by simply dragging and dropping them from the layer panel.


   Here is a short screen recording to see how it works:

   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5k74faBJKo


   As there are a few things remaining to do, the plugin not yet uploaded to the plugin repo but it is mostly functional. Initial feedback from interested testers would be very useful!


   Here is the GitHub repository to try it out:

   https://github.com/jbp35/layer-atlas-plugin/


   Thank you for your time and assistance!


   Best regards,


   Jean-Baptiste Peter

Hi,

Interesting, according to QT doc WebGLEnabled should be enabled by default if available but I will add it anyway as you suggested.

Would you mind sharing the code to install missing dependencies once you are done with it? I have not looked into it yet and this would save me some time! Thank you,

Hi, your question unblocked me.
I'm using my "qgis2web" plugin and your "layer atlas" plugin in a laptop with integrated (not dedicated) video card and that's why I get white screen when I use our plugins. Using them on a desktop PC with a dedicated video card both work.

Taking inspiration from the "HERE Maps for QGIS" plugin which works well on my laptop and which uses QtWebEngine, I understood that to make our plugins work we need to add a setting.

In Layer_Atlas_dockwidget.py file edit:

from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView, QWebEngineSettings

and add WebGLEnabled settings:

class CustomWebEngineView(QWebEngineView):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomWebEngineView, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        settings = self.settings()
        settings.setAttribute(QWebEngineSettings.WebGLEnabled, True)

Your plugin will work perfectly even on PCs without a dedicated video card.

Now you should configure automatic installation of the dependency in case it is not there. This way all users, even those who install via .msi, will be able to use your plugin. Always take inspiration from the "Here" plugin, I still have to finish the code but I'm almost done.

Congratulations for the plugin, it works great and I think it is very useful.

This is head spinning! For OSGeo4W install with "python3-pyqtwebengine" selected, are you testing this in a VM? I wonder if the crash at startup may be caused by the fact that qwebengineview is using opengl which is not working with emulated graphics. This works on my desktop.

I am sure for the .msi installer and will have to do further research.

Best,

Since version 3.38.0 the QtWebEngine export has been added back to qgis.PyQt as you can see here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/final-3_38_0/python/PyQt/CMakeLists.txt

So by installing the standard QGIS .msi just add the dependency via "pip install QtWebEngine" and then use "from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets"

In any case I just installed QGIS in win10 from the OSGeo4W installer adding only the "python3-pyqtwebengine" dependency and your plugin doesn't work. Crashes QGIS startup.
Maybe do some testing on new installations.

As for me, since I believe that most users use qgis via the .msi installation, not via OSGeo4W, it is important for me to understand what to have users install and my goal, when I will at least be able to start my plugin, will be to try to automate these dependencies.

Hi all

? The new website is now online! Visit https://qgis.org to try it out. We
have spent a *lot* of time trying to QA things but undoubtedly there will
still be some *gremlins* in the works. Please file issues here
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo/issues> if you find things that are
*substantive* issues (i.e. a broken link, spelling error) and not 'reviews'
of our work please. If you have other comments or suggestions for
improvements, we much prefer that they be accompanied by *PR's* which
implement your proposed improvements to keep our workload down and the
issue queue short.

? *We would love to get some more representative images/screenshots for
the front and top level pages, so PR's addressing those will be treated
with priority.*

??Thank you so much to the Kontur team (Aliaksandra, Andrei, Nadzeya,
Tigran, Darafei and more!), the members of the website working group that
we formed, Anniina, Lova, Richard, J?rgen, Anita, Andreas. Amy, Thiasha,
Jeremy Prior, and the many others (apologies for not naming you
individually) who contributed ideas, work, and support in the process.

? Please note that your browser / ISP / DNS server and similar may be
caching qgis.org and the DNS entries related to it. Before reporting an
issue:

1. Try an anonymous browser to see if things work normally there
2. Try clearing your cache in your browser
3. Potentially you may need to wait a little for DNS propagation to complete

?? Please note that we made the decision NOT to translate the site into
languages other than english. If you are an official country user group, we
encourage you to:

1. Advise the PSC of your intention to host a localized copy of the site
2. Fork the web site repo https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Hugo
3. Translate the content pages on your fork
4. Host your fork on your country domain e.g. qgis.id
5. Advise us when your fork is online, we will cross link to your site from
QGIS.org

Thank you,

Regards

Tim

  So sadly our translations go to the trash can.
  Should we continue translating documentation, or that is also going

Hi Tim,
thank you for information and your work.

please can you explain how content consistency will be ensured between the
English original of qgis.org and the forks of local communities who want to
translate the content not only of the web pages but also of the
documentation etc.?

currently, thanks to transifex, new English contents are uploaded to
transifex and after translation operations would be flipped to qgis.org
translated pages e.g. qgis.org/it for Italian.

how do we do that now?

thank you very much

stefano

Hi list, PSC

Thanks to all for the efforts put in the new website. Nice work.

I didn't see any related discussion so I suppose there is no issue with 
that but could there be a reply whether the documentation or the Desktop 
would be concerned by the no-translation decision, please? Thanks.

It is still unclear to me why the decision to not translate the website, 
but I must admit that I'm aware of it for months so this is not the 
point today. I thought there would just be no translated site.

What is unclear to me in the "leaving user groups hold their translated 
QGIS.ORG website" is how technically user groups that would like to 
provide localized website would proceed. Is there any how-to? Are all 
the candidates able to maintain the required infrastructure and keep 
their website up to date? Being an enthusiast translator doesn't mean a 
"geek". And are we not over-complicating the system, splitting the 
resources we have while a centralized translation system at QGIS.ORG 
could benefit to everyone? How about the translation infrastructure is 
managed by QGIS.ORG linked to the qgis-hugo repo BUT qgis.org does not 
provide translated pages on the website. Translated strings are just 
pulled in the repo and then every user group willing to translate 
somehow plugs to the (forked?) repo and build the localized version they 
want and serve it on their own website? Is this possible?

Sorry if there have been discussions related to this I would have 
missed, but translators and non-English speaking users are getting 
confused or at least, have questions. And having a clear direction and 
information might help.

Kind regards,

Harrissou

This relates to the website only.

No  problem and as I said in the other thread, I think we can implement
transifex for the new site.  Give us some time to weigh up the options and
we will come back to this ok?

Hi Tomas

Documentation translation activities continue as normal.

Regardless of what happens with translation of the website (it is still
under discussion), the site is a complete overhaul and will likely require
a fresh start translation wise, if we continue with that approach.

Regards

Tim

  Visual changelog, case study pages are exactly the same, a lot of
other (larger) pages are (text-wise) almost the same.
  Translating just ONE changelog page took ~week of work. All of that
was thrown away. It is hard to guess the (unstated/un-communicated)
benefit/justification of losing all of that hard work of unpaid
volunteers. It will take a lot of time till I will want to translate
again :-(

Hello,

any chance, that future versions of QGIS could include the Qt Data 
Visualization and Qt Charts modules?

https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdatavisualization-index.html
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcharts-index.html

I'm currently using mainly PyQtGraph, Matplotlib and Plotly for building 
data visualization tools/plugins for QGIS. Also having the two Qt 
modules available would be great.

Regards
Andreas

Hi Tim, Anita, Kontur and all,

I recently did a presentation about "what's new in QGIS" at the Swiss user
group meeting and already mentioned this as one of the top
amazing achievements of the last year.
I'm happy that we have a good and professional looking website and I'm sure
that many newcomers will appreciate the cleaned up fresh style.

Thank you so much for all the work you have put into this!
Matthias

Hi all,

Thank you to all the people involved in the new website, IMHO it's way
clearer and look more professionnal than the previous one.

Keep up the good work!

Julien

Just to be clear: nothing has been thrown away - your work still exists in
github and if we do come up with an approach that involves manual
translation, we will certainly recycle your work. Our intention to build
the site as english only was declared in the original call for proposals
for the web site here:
https://blog.qgis.org/2023/10/03/call-for-proposals-qgis-website-overhaul-2023-2024/
.

Marco and I will soon share our rationale why we think translation of the
web site should not be done, and if those proponents of keeping the
translations in place can provide a stronger argument to the contrary we
will certainly integrate any prior work wherever we can.


Regards

Tim

I want to change the icons of the layers in the QGIS Layer Panel Tree.

I found a plugin called Layer Tree Icons that adds a context menu to the layers where you can change it there, but is there a way to do it in code without this plugin by getting access to the tree object in the layer panel?

If you take off 'QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.34.8-1.msi'
from current download url:
https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.34.8-1.msi
you'll find older versions at:
https://qgis.org/downloads/

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

(if you think this should be in the website somewhere, you can create an issue?)

Hi!
I was also curious if it is really missing and wanted to take a look.
And beside the trick from Richard.

I first (obviously) clicked on downloads.
Then I saw resources in the list on the left - clicked on it and saw
"Releases" in the opened menu ..
And there .. tadaaaa "QGIS.org hosted downloads" - and some other pages to
download releases.
So it's not that hard to find.

regards
Werner

Good morning,
I would like to make a few comments.
In the old site of QGIS.org it was possible to immediately display, in the
home, the current version and the version of the LTR.
In my opinion these are important indications because they help the new
user to navigate with the various versions.
Currently it is difficult to understand what is the current version and the
LTR version, that is, you must first browse the whole site to understand
that you need to go to the menu Resources | roadmap.

Congratulations on the new site in English.

Hi,


In addition to the roadmap, I think it's quite natural to go to the download page https://qgis.org/download/ for this info and it's very prominent there.

Anita

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qgis / ogr converts INT & DATE values from spatial
 view to STRING
Message-ID: <9d3dc05d-eab3-4d52-bed7-9f559b97513e@geo.hu-berlin.de>

Dear Developers,

I like to use a GPKG to store and visualize statistical information on 
files in a remote sensing data cube. The GPKG contains three layers:

1. ard_data - a table with all kinds of information but without geometries
2. ard_tiles - a table with polygon geometries.
3. ard_data_byTile - a spatial view that joins both table by a string 
attribute "tileid" and aggregates some rows, like the number of file per 
tile (COUNT(*)):

CREATE VIEW ard_data_byTile AS
SELECT
     T.fid AS OGC_FID,
     T.geom AS geom,
     T.tileid AS tileid,
     COUNT(*) as n,
     SUM(D.QAI) as n_qai,
     SUM(D.OVR) as n_ovr,
     DATE(MIN(D.date)) as obs_first,
     DATE(MAX(D.date)) as obs_last,
     DATE(MIN(D.created)) as created_first,
     DATE(MAX(D.created)) as created_last
FROM ard_data as D JOIN ard_tiles as T
ON D.tileid = T.tileid
GROUP BY D.tileid


The view is registered as spatial layer 
(https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gpkg.html) and its polygons can be 
visualized in QGIS well.

My problem is that the COUNT and SUM field values are cast to STRING. 
This happens in QGIS and GDAL - in the former presumably because of the 
latter:

ds: ogr.DataSource
lyr = ds.GetLayer('ard_daty_byTile')
lyrDefn: FeatureDefn = lyr.GetLayerDefn()
for i in range(lyrDefn.GetFieldCount()):
     fDefn: FieldDefn = lyrDefn.GetFieldDefn(i)
     print(f'{i}: {fDefn.GetName()} {fDefn.GetTypeName()}')

prints:
0: tileid String
1: n String
2: n_qai String
3: n_ovr String
4: obs_first String
5: obs_last String
6: created_first String
7: created_last String

Do you have any idea how I can ensure that QGIS reads integer values 
instead strings?

Explicit casts like "(CAST(SUM(D.QAI) as INTEGER) as n_qai" did not 
solve my problem.

Interestingly, the OGRDataSource::ExecuteSQL does returns correct 
integer value for COUNT and SUM results. DATE(...) results are returned 
as STRINGS as well.

with ds.ExecuteSQL('SELECT * FROM ard_data_byTile') as lyr:
     lyrDefn: FeatureDefn = lyr.GetLayerDefn()
     for i in range(lyrDefn.GetFieldCount()):
         fDefn: FieldDefn = lyrDefn.GetFieldDefn(i)
         print(f'{i}: {fDefn.GetName()} {fDefn.GetTypeName()}')

prints:
0: tileid String
1: n Integer
2: n_qai Integer
3: n_ovr Integer
4: obs_first String
5: obs_last String
6: created_first String
7: created_last String


I uploaded an example GPKG and a python script to:

Benjamin

Yeah, I recently came across a similar issue, and the finding is that it 
is related to the SQLite version. Such casts apparently work since 
SQLite 3.42. So if your QGIS build uses an older SQLite version, they 
won't be honored.

$ ogr2ogr poly.gpkg autotest/ogr/data/poly.shp
$ ogrinfo poly.gpkg -sql "create view v as select fid as ogc_fid, geom, 
cast(1 as int) as my_int, cast(1 as real) as my_real from poly"

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/even/install-sqlite-3.41.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
ogrinfo poly.gpkg -al -so | grep my_
my_int: String (0.0)
my_real: String (0.0)

vs

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/even/install-sqlite-3.42.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
ogrinfo poly.gpkg -al -so | grep my_
my_int: Integer64 (0.0)
my_real: Real (0.0)


This is really a SQLite3 issue as demonstrated by:

$ ~/install-sqlite-3.41.0/bin/sqlite3 poly.gpkg "pragma table_info(v)"
0|ogc_fid|INTEGER|0||0
1|geom|POLYGON|0||0
2|my_int|NUM|0||0
3|my_real|NUM|0||0

vs

$ ~/install-sqlite-3.42.0/bin/sqlite3 poly.gpkg "pragma table_info(v)"
0|ogc_fid|INTEGER|0||0
1|geom|POLYGON|0||0
2|my_int|INT|0||0
3|my_real|REAL|0||0

*However* this only works for TEXT, INTEGER and REAL. As there is no 
SQLite native DATETIME "affinity" (cf 
https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html), there's no way currently to 
force view columns to DATETIME

yes, that's because in that mode, the GPKG driver uses the value of the 
first row to infer the data type, but this isn't super bullet proof 
(particularly if the first row contains NULL values)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS API docs update & more
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+Zb7PR+kiAhi2wxXyLZm5wj92vJyz_ZYU+js1U3GkMjJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Here is a recap of the work I've recently done for the PyQGIS API docs.

After the removal of QGIS self built docker images, the way of triggering
the build of API docs needed to be reworked.
Now,* API docs are built once a week for all 3 current versions (master,
stable, ltr)*.

To address the growing size of the website (>10gb, hitting limits of Github
pages), now only the 3 current versions are browsable online. Older
versions are downloadable as archives from the corresponding releases on
PyQGIS repo (https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/releases). Direct links are
available from the main page of the docs:
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/#versions-of-the-api

Also, the repo has been renamed to emphasize the fact that it doesn't
actually hold the documentation and is a "simple build tool".

And to finish, a nice feature: *a direct link from the PyQGIS docs to the
source in cpp code to edit the docstring directly in the web browser* (see
in screencast in PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/58054)
You'd tell me, it's nice to edit the docs online, but what about sip files?
We have now a* sipify bot in PR* (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/58057),
you just need to comment with */sipify*, and it will automatically update
your branch (as long as you do not uncheck "Allow edits and access to
secrets by maintainers" in your PR).

See all this at: https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/

Kind regards,
Denis

Message-ID: <91c2889b9c4f48e6ab971ad5ee162074@erdc.dren.mil>

Is there support in QGIS for accessing web services (WFS, WMS, etc) requiring a gov't CAC?

I looked at managing certificates and I can export my cert as a .cer file, but do not see that QGIS can import .cer.  I see filters for .der and .pem.

Message-ID: <8c3d600a00d446768d74f269667b3847@erdc.dren.mil>

I am using the select by expression tool through python to select my features and then I trigger rotation through python I see both selected features rotating, but when I click to end the rotation, it only rotated one of the features and left the other one as is.  If I do this through the QGIS using the selection by expression in the selection toolbar and the rotate in the advanced digitizing tool bar rotating both features works fine.

Any Ideas?

Thanks.  Very limited in its current state. The site states compared to the native build of QGIS, there are various limitations:

  *   The API surface is very limited at the moment
  *   Network-based layers (e.g. WMS, WFS, WMTS, XYZ, COG, Vector Tiles) are not supported at the moment
  *   No Python (PyQGIS) available
  *   No Qt GUI provided
  *   Some providers that need to communicate with a server using sockets will probably never work without proxies (e.g. PostgreSQL)

No python or QT GUI is a show stopper.

You can probably convert from cer to pem using openssl.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why is data source both in layer-tree-layer and in
 maplayer?
Message-ID: <CAKKm1vGgXSc1v2oGo7H5uurcF84kB=0bTaKuhp9iHfjGsxc=pg@mail.gmail.com>

I created an empty qgis project, then chose New GeoPackage Layer, chose a
new file "foo.gpkg" and layername "mytable".

Everything seems fine. But if I save, and reopen the project it cant find
the source. So I inspect the qgz XML and find the source for the layer in
two places:

### Layer-Tree-Layer:

<layer-tree-layer
    id="mytable_d645cad7_6637_434d_9295_dc62a7ff198e"
    source="./foo.gpkg|layername=mytable"
    legend_split_behavior="0"
    name="mytable" expanded="1"
    checked="Qt::Checked"
    providerKey="ogr"
    legend_exp=""
    patch_size="-1,-1"
>

### MapLayer

<projectlayers>
    <maplayer (...) >
        <id>mytable_d645cad7_6637_434d_9295_dc62a7ff198e</id>

<datasource>../../OneDrive/Dokumenter/foo.gpkg|layername=mytable</datasource>
        (...)
        <layername>foo ? mytable</layername>
        (...)
    </maplayer>
</projectlayers>


The latter for some reason has a wrong value in datasource. I have no
projects or data files in that location, so I guess QGIS somehow defaulted
to my users document folder. This seems like some kind of bug.

But I wonder, why, in the first place, is datasource in two different
places in that file?

Running QGIS 3.36.3 on Windows 10.

Hi Thomas,

GIS stores project files and data files separately.
Did you create a temporary layer or a permanent one?
You can also change in Project settings type of stored Path
(absolute/relative) inside project file.

Translating this to internet standards terminology from US Government,
the question is

  Can one configure a WFS etc. in qgis, when the service has a
  requirement to authenticate using a PCKS11 smartcard?

On POSIX-like systems one would probably use https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/

I suspect this comes down to what library is used for web fetches and if
there is config support for pkcs11 in it.

Hi Greg,
first time I hear about PCKS11 here, maybe just because it is mostly used
and required in the US.
Doing a quick search, it seems the Qt QCA lib supports this protocol, cf.
[0]

My guess, and Alessandro knows more than I do on this front, is that this
needs to be implemented in QGIS, or maybe via a dedicated plugin. I think
that would mean also packaging the qt plugin qt-pkcs11 with your QGIS
install.

Is this a mandatory requirement or optional? If mandatory in your context,
you should probably get in touch with a developper and gather funds to have
this implemented. Maybe others have more informations than I do.

I don't think it is about the US so much but about large organizations
being serious about cyber security.  Normal people in the US who haven't
worked in those environments have not heard of PKCS11 either.  The main
developer of pcsc-lite is in France.

Individual people use eg. yubikeys with WebAuthn, but the big-org norm
has been X.509 on smartcards.  That may be changing, but I don't see
really-big-orgs changing any time soon.

Thanks :)

I do understand how data is not part of the qgis project file itself.

I chose to add a permanent gpkg layer, by creating a new gpkg file
"foo.gpkg" with one table/layer "mytable". I chose to create the gpkg  in
the same folder as the qgz file. And in fact the file is created in that
location.

But the next time I open the project, it looks in a different folder
(Documents) for foo.gpkg, and therefore cant find it.

Hi Luke,

If your plugin provides processing algorithms, you can take a look at 
https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps to publish your algorithms in a Web 
Processing Service or OGC API Processes.
Then you can use Lizmap as the web user interface or you can develop 
your own web interface.

Hi Luke,

You can try with G3W-SUITE (https://g3wsuite.it) and add the new plugin 
for processing: https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-admin-processing

With this plugin you can use the Processing Capabilities of QGIS desktop.

Have a nice day

   Good morning developers,

   I managed to get qtwebengine working in qgis2web.

   For some reason qtwebkit didn't need to set a window width while qtwebengine did, so with this code I solved it

   self.preview.setMinimumWidth(650)

   Request:
   What is the correct way to have users install the qtwebengine dependency?
   I wrote this code and it works fine but I only tested it on windows. Is this the correct way?

   try:

           if system == 'Windows':

               pip_exec = os.path.join(sysconfig.get_path("scripts"), "pip3")

               env = os.environ.copy()

               if full_proxy_url:

                   env['http_proxy'] = full_proxy_url

                   env['https_proxy'] = full_proxy_url

               subprocess.check_call([pip_exec, "install", "--upgrade", "PyQtWebEngine==5.15.6"], env=env)

           elif system == 'Linux':

               subprocess.check_call(["sudo", "apt-get", "install", "python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine"])

           elif system == 'Darwin':  # macOS

               subprocess.check_call(["brew", "install", "pyqt5"])

   Many thanks

   Oggetto Re: [QGIS-Developer] Transition from QtWebKit to QtWebEngine in qgis2web (QGIS plugin)
   Thanks Jan Dalheimer
   Thanks Jean-Baptiste Peter
   From your answers I understood many things.
   I tried both to use QGIS 3.38.0 installed in win10 via .msi and the version via OSGeo4W setup; In the first case I added qtwebengine via "pip install qtwebengine", in the second case I installed the "python3-pyqtwebengine" package via OsGeo4w setup
   In both installations I get the same result: QtWebEngine it does not work well
   I also tried to create a new test plugin and I get the same result, I can't even view a web page. Is there an example of a basic plugin that I can see? Or can someone create it?
   The clue:
   If I use qt designer to insert a QtWebEngineView into the plugin graphics it works well, even when setting a static web page.
   But if I open QGIS that plugin won't work, why does this happen? I would therefore think that it is just a question of dependency .
   For now I noticed this:
   1) From QGIS version 3.38.0 I can use "from qgis.PyQt.QtWebEngineWidgets import *" instead of "from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import *"

   2) with qgis 3.38.0 .msi installation this dependency is missing:

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)

   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   3) with OSGeo4W setup these dependencies are required:

   python3-core (3.12.4-1)

   Python core interpreter and runtime

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, python3-pyqt5-sip

   python3-pyqt5 (5.15.10-1)

   Python bindings for the Qt cross platform application toolkit

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   python3-pyqt5-sip (12.13.0-1)

   The sip module support for PyQt5

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5

   qt5-devel (5.15.13-1)

   Qt5 headers and libraries (Development)

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine

   qt5-libs (5.15.13-1)

   Qt5 runtime libraries

   Required by: python3-pyqtwebengine, python3-pyqt5, qt5-devel, qtwebkit-libs

   Thank you all

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS project maintainability, forms and styles,
 xml verbosity
Message-ID: <42a7b143-3474-4aca-85f7-fc2ab62d052f@gmail.com>

Hi devs,


I'm trying to maintain a QGIS project
I am hit by some issues that I was already aware of, but this time it is 
way more painful than I faced before.

In short, with the growing qgis features, but also datasets becoming 
larger (more columns) too, QGIS projects are becoming heavier and 
heavier, and require a lot of effort to maintain when trying to ship 
them as part of applications or with datasets.

My dataset has around a dozen of tables, and one has a lot of columns, 
around 200 columns.? I know this is an not optimal data normalization to 
have so many columns. But as datascience grows, shipping gpkg or 
geoParquet files with lots of columns tends to be more frequent.

My main layer has 6 styles and each style has the same form definition 
to make it easy to read those attributes, and offer some 1-n relation 
nested forms (buildings and postal addresses).

## First issue, forms are considered as being a part of each style.

This make the qgs xml replicate 6 times the same form, in my case. It 
makes it very hard to maintain a single source of truth for this form 
also. The idea of having on form per style could be elegant, but it is a 
path full of caveats and I suspect very few of us are using this as a 
feature.

## Second issue, verbosity of the xml

The properties of those forms have grown in time, with many new features 
(default values, data defined fonts etc.. ). This is cool.

However in average day use, most of those settings are left as default 
values, still QGIS will write every property for each column in the 
xml.? Ex: default value, hidden status, LabelonTop, etc.? This is highly 
denormalized and verbose, mostly for unset properties.? It is so much 
denormalized that a simple QGIS xml can weight 18MB and be zipped down 
to 977 KB.


## So I would like to open a debate here about how to handle this.

As for the form being replicated in each style, I would propose to plan 
moving form definition up in the layer definition, not in style 
definition. This will probably imply an API break and retrocompatibility 
issues, so my best guess is that the only time frame to make it happen 
is QGIS 4.


Regarding the xml verbosity, suppose we probably could find solutions:


 ?- don't write properties that are left untouched or default (which may 
lead to strange behavior when defaults change)
 ?- don't repeat unuseful informations. ie, layer tree block repeats 
provider and datasource even if it is not used. Confusion appears from 
time to time when user try to save or modify the xml file because of this
 ?- find a less verbose xml serialization if QT allows this. For 
instance, instead of on xml block per property, why not have on block 
per field. For instance :

```xml

 ??????? <editable>
 ??????????? [here dozen of fields]
 ??????????? <field editable="1" name="adedpe202006_l_ch_gen_princ"></field>
 ??????? </editable>
 ??????? <labelOnTop>
 ??????????? [here dozen of fields, again]
 ??????????? <field labelOnTop="0" 
name="adedpe202006_l_ch_gen_princ"></field>
 ??????? <labelOnTop>
```

could be

```xml
```
<form>
 ? ...
 ?? <fields>
 ??????????? <field name="adedpe202006_l_ch_gen_princ" labelOnTop="0" 
editable="1" ></field>
 ?? </fields>

<form>
```


To be fair, I have no funding at the moment, but I can try to make it 
happen, if we reach a technical consensus here. Any cofunding or grant 
proposal would obviously help here. I'm pretty sure companies editing 
desktop apps using QGIS could find an interest here.? This thread will 
probably raise the question of a new generation project file, but that 
is not my intent ;)

Let me know what you think

Cheers

R?gis

Thanks for raising this discussion -- I agree that it's an important issue,
and one we should address.

The idea of having on form per style could be elegant, but it is a path
full of caveats and I suspect very few of us are using this as a feature.

+1. I think that per-style form configuration would be very rarely used,
and should definitely be opt-in rather than something which happens by
default. It's an absolute PAIN to synchronize form configuration across
styles!

A solution could be to move the existing "Show form on ..." combo box from
the form tab into a new "form settings" group, and then add a new checkbox
in there for "Allow different form configuration for different styles"
(which would be off by default for all newly added layers).

I'm sure a lot of users would appreciate this!

Agreed.

I'd lean toward -0 for this, just because we do occasionally change the
default and the impact of a setting changing in a user's existing project
can be extreme. Rather I'd go with a "don't write properties for properties
which are unset" approach. Eg if a layer doesn't have a vertical CRS set
for, we don't write ANYTHING to the XML (as opposed to verticalCrs="" or
similar). It's a trivial change in code (i.e. checking for an empty string
before writing the attribute) but one which has to be explicitly made, so
we'd need to educate all our developers/reviewers that this is the desired
approach.

instead of on xml block per property, why not have on block per field. For
instance :

*snip*

This one is rather tricky, as it's completely independent pieces of code
which are creating these elements. We'd have to be very careful not to
muddy the QGIS API by tightly linking objects which should remain
independent. I think if we're looking at fixing this properly then a better
approach would be to remove our hard dependency on XML and the Qt DOM
classes, and swap out to some custom class which allows us to freely change
the background format entirely (JSON!). We could even do this without
breaking the API, by "cheating" and making a QgsObjectStorage (?) class
which exposes the same public API as QDomDocument/QDomElement and then
using this throughout our API. (There'd be no break for PyQGIS, because
these objects expose the same API! ?). And then we'd be free to make this
custom class write/read to/from XML, JSON, YML, .... whatever we want.

Even with no other changes in QGIS code a switch to a JSON format would
save a LOT of wasted characters, because we won't have any of those
"duplicate" end tags anymore. We could also avoid all these type="QString",
type="Map" strings because the type would be discernable without having to
explicitly write it out.
