Not really, as the problem is that the dialog cannot be made smaller. 
The smallest size is already too large for the eee PC display.
See sites.google.com/site/eospansite/myqgisproblems for an screenshot

Thanks!

Yes! This is useful, as the problem was that I could
not reach the bottom of the dialog.

Anyway (for devs), could not it be
possible making the windows so that could be resized to smaller
sizes in future releases?

 There's so much on some of these dialogs that it would be tricky to
shrink them without losing some of the usability.

 The Properties dialog at the moment seems to be constrained
vertically by the Labels tab for the General settings. It might be
possible to shrink this a bit by changing the placement radio buttons
to a combobox, and maybe shuffling a few things around a bit. I think
these dialogs all have .ui files in the Qgis source, so why not have a
play with Qt Designer and see if you can rearrange it all to fit on
your screen.

 You will probably need a big screen to use Qt Designer without pain though!

 Alternatively, there's some help on coping with big windows on small
screens on the eee here:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=893260

 - which seems to say there's a gconftool setting that needs tweaking,
and then you should be able to Alt-Mouse-1 Drag windows anywhere...

I agree that there is a usability problem for QGIS on small screens. But 
it is not an easy problem to solve. If you make smaller dialogues there 
is a lack of usability on big screens  (esp. when you have 
high-resolution dual-screens).

At some point it might be useful to have different UIs for QGIS:

* for normal PCs and high-resolution PCs
* For small notebooks and netbooks
* for PDAs

I don't think there is a single UI that fits all of these different 
devices. Also, Tablet PCs and PDAs with Touchscreens might require a 
different UI than devices that are controlled with a mouse.

Can you provide a patch against the current trunk so the provider can  
be reviewed?

Hi!

After around 30 installations of QGIS using osgeo4w
according to directions in:
http://sites.google.com/site/eospansite/qsig-for-windows
(please notify of any improvements that should be done)

I've found only 1 case with a major problem (Win XP machine)
and I would most appreciate your help.

At starting QGIS, the following message is displayed and the program
does not start:
"Error at starting the program because jpeg_osgeo.dll could not be
found. Reinstaling the program could solve the problem"
(this is my own translation of the original message in Spanis:
"Error al iniciar la aplicaci?n porque no se encontr? jpeg_osgeo.dll. La
reinstalaci?n de la aplicaci?n puede solucionar el problema")

(I was not present while the student made the actual installation, so
cannot guarantee that he followed the directions above strictly).

The problem is that we have tried to uninstall through osgeo4w-setup
but don't get to make a complete uninstall, there are always
remaining items. We've uninstalled as much as we could, and installed
again, but the problem remains.

Could you advice on how to proceed for a complete removal and subsequent
successful installation?

Thanks

Agus

Hi all.
I think we should backport fTools to the stable (1.0) branch, otherwise
one functionality will be missing with respect to previous versions.
Any objections?

Hi all,

I just svn-updated the trunk version, recompiled and installed. Now when I
am starting QGIS I get segmentation faults. I then removed
.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf to make sure that the settings/plugins aren't
disturbing.

I could then start QGIS, but it was still very unstable.

I then rolled back to release 10240 and it works fine again. (10240 was
just a random pick, I first tried to go back to 10250 and 10249 and it
still had the problems).

Any idea what could be wrong? Are others also experiencing startup and
stability problems with the current trunk?

Andreas

Had an immediate segfault after compiling and installing today's svn and 
starting qgis. However, running 'make uninstall' and after that deleting 
all qgis remains, and then running 'make install' again, apparently 
solved it (qgis starts OK and some quick testing doesn't show any 
instability). Deleting all qgis remains in my case meant: deleting 
/usr/local/share/qgis, /usr/local/include/qgis and /usr/local/lib/qgis. 
Ymmv.

Thanks, Vincent,

It seems to work now again for me after deleting the directories you
mentioned. I first tried without removing /usr/local/share/qgis (as I did
some modifications) in this directory). But it did not work. After
deleting /usr/local/share/qgis and running make install again it worked
fine.

Thanks again,
Andreas

Hi Paolo

Can't it be installed in 1.0.x branch with the Python Plugin installer?

Regards,

Hi all.
I think we should backport fTools to the stable (1.0) branch, otherwise
one functionality will be missing with respect to previous versions.
Any objections?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Set values of edit widget value map in a python
	PlugIn
Message-ID: <1236002178360-2409260.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi everybody,

I'm trying to set the following thing automatically in a python PlugIn:

In  Layer properties/attributes the values for the edit widget valuemap.

With the following code 

self.belStand.setEditType(3,QgsVectorLayer.ValueMap)

I set the editType to ValueMap.
So how can I set the values now?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Hi devs

The vector overlay branch (which adds support for diagrams on maps) is in a state where it can be tested. Check out the source from svn with 'svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/vector_overlay_branch'.

The new features from a user perspective are:
- a diagram Plugin. If it is selected, there is a new tab in the vector properties dialog where pie/bar/proportional symbol diagrams may be selected
- in the option dialog, there is a new tab 'overlay' where it is possible to select the placement algorithm of the diagrams. The central point method is the old one, the others use algorithms of the PAL library. They also consider diagram objects in different layers. It is planned to use these algorithms also for label placement

>From a developer perspective, the branch makes the following changes:
- It adds a new plugin type (overlay plugin) such that it is possible to have the diagrams in a plugin
- It adds the interface QgsVectorOverlay. Currently the diagram overlay is the only implementation, but we are looking forward for the labels...
- The diagram plugin is new
- The sources of the PAL library are in core
- The placement method of QgsVectorOverlay is called in the render loop in QgsMapRenderer

A known issue is that the PAL library placement methods currently only work for meter units, not for maps in degrees. There is work in progress to change this.

Regards and looking forward for your feedback,
Marco

Oh and the PAL classes require geos-3. What are the opinions, is it okay to define geos >= 3 as the minimum requirement for QGIS or do we still need to support geos 2?

Marco

Hi Massimo

Thank you for answer. I in my opinion what you do is interesting and fine. But 
i chose any way to integrate qgis and ossimplanet. I want to create a brunch 
of qgis it will be have a tab with 3d view and a toolbox with the qgis and 
ossimplanet legends.

Yes, of course, but the (correct, IMHO) objection from Markus Neteler is
that in this way an important functionality has been removed, which
shouldn't be. I think that backporting it is quite simple and respect
the principle of minimum surprise for the user.
All the best.

Plase consider also ratman as a replacement of ossimplanet:
http://ratman.sourceforge.net/
it is quite good, and compiles fine on both win a linux (I assume also
on osx). It is based on qt, and integration should not be too difficult.
In the future, libraries will have to be split, and qgis could use only
the pieces needed for 3d visualization.
All the best.

Hi Paolo

Thats something to decide for our release manager.
As far as I understood the 1.0.x branch was just meant to contain bug fixes and not new features.

Marco

Yes, of course, but the (correct, IMHO) objection from Markus Neteler is
that in this way an important functionality has been removed, which
shouldn't be. I think that backporting it is quite simple and respect
the principle of minimum surprise for the user.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding multiple layer
Message-ID: <1236068154265-2414005.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi guys,

I'm new to QGis and really hope to learn something from you guys. I had a
questions about Mr.Tim Sutton's Tutorial on QGis. Based on Tutorial 3:
Labelling map canvas features, 
1. can you guys guide me about how i can load multiple layer because from
that tutorial its just contain 1 layer only. I already tried to play around
with the code but it still load 1 layer only.
2. what is layerBasedName do because i try to put a different layer in
folder data and specify a different layer name on the code but it still can
display the layer inside the folder. 


Really aprreciate your help in this matter.

Thanks in advance,
bonar

Was it removed from 1.0?  I wasn't aware of that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] custom prj
Message-ID: <49AD0210.9020609@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Apparently newer versions of QGIS have problems reading custom
projection files (see attached).
In one of the IT regions, the administrations use a custom projection
system, with a False_Northing at -4000000 (I know it is stupid).
QGIS 0.9.2 can read it and reproject it, whereas 1.0 fails.
Probably the newer versions check whether the prj corresponds to a EPSG
projection, and in case it is not it refuses considering it, but IMHO it
should just warn the user ("non standard projection") and proceed.
Am I missing something?
All the best.

It may be caused by the depreciated Grid Maker (Graticule Creator) plugin. It's 
one file in the /usr/local/lib/qgis/ directory, named libgraticulecreator.so or 
similarly.

Try to remove it, because it's obsolete&incompatible and is no longer replaced 
by the make install.

Hi bonar,

*1.* I did this in Python: I create a layers variable in __init__ method:


     self.layers = []  # Layer list

In addLayer method I insert the loaded layer to the list:

     self.layers.insert(0, QgsMapCanvasLayer(layer))

And finally set the layer list to canvas:

     self.canvas.setLayerSet(self.layers)

Hope this helps.

I actually meant that *dividing the map canvas in 2* (1 part for the
refference and the other for the target map view, plus a toolbar for
georectification tools and options above them) would be IMO better
than the current 2 distinct windows (main QGIS window with refference
map and standard QGIS tools, the other window target map view plus
georectification tools and options).

Manuel's idea of live-linked reference and target views is great. I wish
I had both - linked views & better desktop utilisation by getting rid of
the extra window.

It compiled fine. I'll try to test and get some feedback soon.

Btw. An incompatible plugin shouldn't cause program crashes! After upgrading 
from the 1.0 to the 1.1 it will probably affect all users who have GridMaker 
enabled. Also external plugins can cause troubles after QGIS upgrade. 

Shouldn't we implement any test for plugin version? I'm not sure what is the 
right way. A revision number of QGIS the plugin was compiled against? Probably 
there is something much smarter.

I think we should add another function to C++ plugins, something like
"requiredQgisVersion" and this one would return the version of QGIS it
has been compiled with (from QGIS_VERSION macro). Then the first thing
when loading a plugin would be to resolve this function and compare
the actual qgis version and plugin's qgis version.

Otherwise we might be getting more complaints from users. This would
solve also a longer standing problem that if there are some plugins
for older version of qgis (and there are also libs for the older
version), QGIS tries to load them anyway and some incompatibility
causes python bindings not to be loaded (because QgsApplication
returns incorrect paths).

Hi Paolo,

in case it's an unknown projection, QGIS just fails to use it. To work
this around, add that projection to the custom projections with these
parameters:
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=500000 +y_0=-4000000
+ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs
Next time you load the layer, the reference system will be detected
correctly and you'll be able to project it.

I agree that this is not user-friendly. A solution might be to tell
the user that we have an unknown reference system and ask him whether
he would like to add it (otherwise it won't work).

Hi Martin.
Agreed, this would be a good solution. However, apparently earlier
versions (0.9.2 at least) could use the custom prj, which although not
completely sane it's far easier for users.
Would the modification be easy to do?
All the best.

Hi,

first of all I want to thank you for the BuildingQGIS-Tutorial. It helped
me much with creating a running development environment on my windows
machine.

Now I want to be sure, that the plugin I'm planning is not under way by
anyone else or already included in QGIS.
I want to write a plugin which transforms a rasterlayer to an new
coordinate system (content: choose raster -> choose new coordinate system
-> new rastername and rastertype -> save and add to canvas). I know that a
reprojection on-the-fly is already implemented for the whole project, but
I'm not sure if this works only on a specific layer too. And what if I
choose an other coordinate system for the project, can I save the
transformed rasterlayer?
If this still can be done with QGIS, please tell me.

Thanks and best regards,
Florian

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Postgis Geoprocessing Plugin
Message-ID: <1236234719.26937.11.camel@vatto01>

Hi developers,

I'm working in a new plugin and I'd like to hear what you guys think
about it's usability.

The idea for this plugin is to create an environment for new tools using
postgis. It basically sets a user interface for predefined queries that
the user set in his xml file. 

In other words: the user sets a query in the XML file that holds all
queries. When the plugin is loaded it reads the XML file, and generate
menu items for each tool. When the tool is called, the plugin read what
the user set as parameters for that tool and draw the user interface
asking for that parameters. When the user is done, press ok and the
query start to run on the database.

It started with the need to redo many queries like "discover which
cities touch the polygon stored in that table and return their names".
So I decided to make a plugin to store these queries in a xml file.

For the later development I aim to create a GUI to set the XML (Query
Designer) and the plugin should list available tables and connections in
comboboxes.

At the moment I just have the postgis connection using QtSql and the gui
automated building . I still need to read the XML and create the menu
entries so it's still a little far from a working copy. I attached the
auto gui python script in the mail so anyone interested could use it.
I've found myself looking for something that could create a gui from a
simple list of label/boxtype for a long time.

And thanks for the guy who wrote that plugin builder (I never remember
the name). It's REALLY usefull.

Well, I wrote to hear what you think about it.
Thanks for reading,
Maur?cio de Paulo

Hi Tim,

I think, that I was the one you mean with the gdal plugin idea (about a
month ago). I think that a whole gdal frontend is too extensive for my
bachelor thesis. So I just want to start with the coordinate system warp.
Probably, I will go on developing after I finished my bachelor, but I have
to concentrate on that small part first.
I will plan the plugin variable, so that I can add other gdal functions
after my bachlor thesis.

Thanks for your information.

Best regards,
Florian

Hi Florian.
Good news you're starting work on this. Even if a whole frontend to all
GDAL functions would be too much, please consider this opportunity and try
to write your plugin in a way it could be extended with other functions.
Also, it would be good if you could open the development to others,
perhaps via svn.
All the best, and thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Band order in "Identify Features"
Message-ID: <20090305140310.18601.qmail@s466.sureserver.com>

Hi there,

It looks like a bug to me but I could be wrong since I am not too familiar with QGIS, but the things is that if I load a 
raster dataset with more than 9 bands the "Identify Results" windows shows the pair {Band,Value} in the wrong 
order. I mean, it is in alphabetical order but it doesn't make sense for an usability point of view.

So, for example, a Geotiff with 320 bands will show:

Band1
Band10
Band100
Band101
Band102
Band103
Band104
Band105
Band106
Band107
Band108
Band109
Band11
Band111
Band112
Band113
Band114
Band115
Band116
Band117
Band118
Band119

Instead of Band numeric order:

Band1
Band2
Band3
Band4
Band5
Band6
Band7
Band8
Band9
Band10
Band11
Band12
Band13
Band14
Band15
Band16
Band17
Band18
Band19

it would be even better to present something else other then "BandN" since some datasets could have raster 
attribute table or GDAL band metadata. In that case we could be presenting something like:

{Band, Date, Average Temperature}
Band1  1982-01 22
Band1  1982-02 21
Band1  1982-03 32
Band1  1982-04 32
Band1  1982-05 32
Band1  1982-06 22
Band1  1982-07 22
Band1  1982-08 22
Band1  1982-09 22
Band1  1982-10 22
Band1  1982-11 22
Band1  1982-12 22
Band1  1983-01 22
Band1  1983-02 21
Band1  1983-03 32
Band1  1983-04 32
Band1  1983-05 32
Band1  1983-06 22
Band1  1983-07 22
Band1  1983-08 22
Band1  1983-09 22
Band1  1983-10 22
Band1  1983-11 22
Band1  1983-12 22

Another suggestion: It would be interesting to present this number in graph too.

My best regards,

Ivan

Hi all.
Apparently 1.0.1 does not read grass vector correclty: geometries are
ok, but attributes are missing (only the cat is shown).
This is on debian packages from debian.gfoss.it
If it is confirmed, it is a serious bug.
All the best.

Hi Gary,

I've completed the integration of my SpatiaLite
data provider in QGis 1.1 [SVN rev.10264]

I've done a quite extensive testing; anything seems
to be reasonably stable.

If you wish to review the patches I've applied you
can find all the sources at:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/QGisJanus/

[please note: the latest version for QGis 1.1 is at
the bottom of the page]

You'll find some useful explanation at:
http://www.gaia-gis.it/QGisJanus/SpatiaLite_QGis.pdf

--------

I noticed there is some annoying issue in the CMake
build system (at least, I wasn't able to find an
elegant and robust solution ...)

The question arises from libsqlite3.so and
related headers:

a) SpatiaLite absolutely needs a recent version
   supporting the R*Tree spatial index (v.3.6.0
   or later; current SQLite is v.3.6.11)

b) my Ubuntu 8.04.1 ships on /usr/lib and /usr/include
   an unbelievably obsolescent libsqlite3.so

c) QGis ships an internal sqlite3, but this too is
   too old to be useful.

I found some problem with PROJ.4 as well (SpatiaLite
uses the latest v.4.6.1), but this one doesn't seems
to be a critical issue, because the proj APIs are
stable.

Any suggestion about this will be strongly appreciate.
 
Best regards,
Sandro Furieri

I found it perfectly safe on Ubuntu to use the Jaunty sqlite3 packages
at least on Intrepid. Haven't tried on 8.04 but looking at the
dependencies it should work too.

We should probably up the internal version though also.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostGisTools Plugin
Message-ID: <1236307711.15892.0.camel@vatto01>

Ok, as reported yesterday I'm working on the plugin to create automated
gui for queries define by the users in a xml filme.
Today I've been able to do the first tests on this plugin. It's better
than I expected as it took 10 seconds to create a new "Run SQL Query"
plugin and another 10 seconds to create a "Count IF" plugin. 

Well, at the moment the tool to edit the xml isn't even started (well, I
have the gui designed) but I wish to focus on the bugfixing of this part
of the plugin as we can set the tools using text files and editing the
xml. So if anyone could be so kind to test it a little, it's uploaded in
the default contributed repository.

Actually, I'm not being able to upload it because for some reason the
pyqgis.org site isn't running properly here so I'm sending the plugin as
an attachment.

There is a bug in the plugin... unload function because I had to create
a list of actions and now I don't know why the removePluginMenu don't
work with actionlist[item] :/ Any sugestions?

I'm also sending screenshots of both tools and the gui for the builder
to people understand how it works.

Message-ID: <COL103-W32407D926775BB3DF95586B2A50@phx.gbl>


Hi developers:

 
I have been working in a patch for open vector layer dialog to improve it and extend it to support database,  protocol and directory connections in addition to the already implemented file support.
 
I have tested the patch with the following drivers:
 
Database drivers:
 
Mysql,Oracle,Postgres,ODBC,Esri Personal Geodatabase
 
Protocol drivers:
 
GeoJSON
 
Directory drivers:
 
UK. NTF.,US Census Tiger/Line,Arc Info Binary Coverage
 
File drivers:
 
Atlas BNA,Esri Personal Geodatabase,Esri Shapefile,GML,GPX,KML,Mapinfo File,Microstation DGN,S-57,X-PLANE,
 
The supported drivers are not limited to the ones in the list, I have coded the uri
translation for most drivers mentioned in gdal/ogr site.
 
The patch is available in https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/515

 

Any suggestions and comments are welcome.

 
Best regards

Godofredo Contreras

Hi Alessandro

Glad to hear you made good progress. The PSC decided to give you svn write access so Gary will give you the details (login/pw) soon (if not already done).

However, we should discuss the minimum version issues of sqlite3 and proj before you proceed with committing. Would it be an option to add a cmake test for the sqlite version that is available, create a cmake variable and build the sqlite provider if it is set? You would need to consider that in providers/CMakeLists.txt and probably in the opening dialog.

Regards,
Marco

Well, 0.9.2 is quite some time back and a lot of code has been changed
since then, so I'm not sure about this.
But you say that 0.9.2 is able to work with the projection although
it's not included in the custom projections?

Hi Mauricio,

I was wondering whether it wouldn't be more efficient to implement
this functionality to PostGIS Manager I've developed some time ago? It
features also SQL query window, so it could be relatively easy to add
this as "favourite sql queries" ?

Apparently yes (this has been reported by an Italian user). Francesco

Hi,

is it possible to include the QgsProjectionSelector in my plugin?
I define this class in Qt Designer, but if I make the project, I recieve
the following error:

In file included from
C:/dev/cpp/qgis/build/src/plugins/test/ui_gdalguibase.h:26
,
                 from C:\dev\cpp\qgis\src\plugins\test\/gdalgui.h:17,

So the header can't find the ui anymore. Can I fix that or isn't it
possible to use qgis-gui-parts in plugins?

Hi Alessandro.
What minimum Sqlite version does SpatiaLite needs? In Debian it is at
3.5.9, which is not really old (3.6.11 now). Is this too old for SpatiaLite?
Anyway, at least for the internal sqlite, what does prevent us from
shipping the latest version?
All the best.

	Hi Martin.
	I'm glad to hear it. It's actually pretty easy to insert it inside
Postgis Manager as the only difference would be eliminating the
__init__.py.
	Whenever you feel like it, I can add the code to the Manager. Have you
tested the plugin itself yet?
	I think that even though the interface should be inside postgis
manager, the access to the favourites should be from the plugin toolbox.
What do you think?

Hi boys & girls,

The qgis interface is missing removeDockWidget method. Do you (some of 
developers) think, it could be added? If yes, I've created a patch (against 
revision 10264), it's really just trivial few lines of code - it's 
attached... Only adds the method and python bindings for it...

3.5.9 works with Spatialite, but 3.6.x is required for some features to
work properly. As I mentioned before though on Ubuntu I used the package
for jaunty as a drop in replacement without a hitch.

Hello everyone,
I've found it hard to know what plugins are really getting attention
from the users so I've thought: Can the plugin installer tell me how
many times were they downloaded? And I think maybe we could add tags
like "downloads" and "digged" as in some filesharing tools. This way
people could see what plugins have been tested and see if people liked
it or not. So we developers could get a feedback and the users could
have a parameter to rely or not on the results of that plugin.
What do you think, Borys?

It is just an alphanumeric sorting. However since the band names are now 
created/labeled sequentially on load, they should come up in the right 
logical order in any list.  We chose to name the bands this way because 
the band names stored in the raster file were not always correct or even 
relevant causing confusion for newer users and for even more experienced 
users.

Please file a ticket for this.

Message-ID: <541095545.144541236553227173.JavaMail.root@mail.thehumanjourney.net>

Dear all,

I keep getting into situations where mapping 1:n and m:n relationships
in relational DBMS to GIS vector models becomes a problem.
The toughest restrictions of course are the 1:1 relation between map
features and attribute table records and the fact that GIS relates
data by spatial overlay, not foreign fields. I realize that some GIS
(like GRASS) are somewhat more flexible in that they can attach more
than one attribute table to a layer, but I am really looking for more
portable ways to deal with this.

- How do you deal with 1:n and m:n relations in GIS?

- What do you do if there are no spatial representations for the
records on the "n" side? Can that be handled at all?

Apparently, it would be possible to model some of this using overlapping
features in Shapefiles, but that would violate topology rules.

Any ideas are very welcome, indeed!

Thanks, everyone, 

Ben

Pete,

About the band order:

I filed a ticked about the sorting order: http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1567

About the band names:

I believe that ticked #1296 is about "class names associated with a cell in a thematic raster file". My suggestion was 
regarding the "band name" but I understand when you mention that it could be messy if the dataset does not 
provide a compressive annotation.

My best regards,

Ivan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with gdal path in python plugin
Message-ID: <1236613639906-2449727.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi list !

I'm actually porting an old python plugin to 1.0 on Windows

On 0.11 Metis, i used to use some "dirty" gdal command from python to
extract pixels values for a given extent generated by Region Tool python
script like this :

command = QString("gdal_translate -ot Float32 -projwin " +str(xmin) +" " +
str(ymax) +" " +  str(xmax) +" " + str(ymin) +" "+ infoString +"clip.tif")
klip=os.popen(str(command)).readlines() 

This worked fine if "C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS/"  was added to Windows
PATH

Now with OSGeo4W installer, gdal path seems not to be recognized, even if
"C:/OSGeo4W/apps/gdal-16/bin" is added to PATH (where the gdal exe are)

Any ideas to make gdal commands work properly ?

Thanks by advance

PikO

Thats odd since in qgssinglesymbolrenderer.h we have:

 26 class CORE_EXPORT QgsSingleSymbolRenderer: public QgsRenderer
 27 {
 28   public:
 29     QgsSingleSymbolRenderer( QGis::GeometryType type );

and from qgsvectorlayer.h we have:

163     /** Returns point, line or polygon */
164     QGis::GeometryType geometryType() const;

So your first attempt should have been correct and working. Are you sure
you have 1.0 final and no stray headers from older versions?

If I recall   vectorType was dropped in favour of geometryType in the

on Windows problems. It's going really well for Linux but sadly i still need to make a 
development under Windows because of some issuese. Based on your email, i already make 
a new QGis installations on Windows from source. I'm using QGis 1.0 + Qt4.4.3, but i still
have no luck, this time i get different error:

undefined reference to `_imp___ZN12QgsMapCanvas9setExtentERK12QgsRectangle'
undefined reference to `_imp___ZN23QgsSingleSymbolRendererC1EN4QGis12GeometryTypeE'
CMakeFiles\timtut1.dir\main.cpp.obj In function `main':
make: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/timtut1.dir/all] Error 2
make[2]: *** [timtut1.exe] Error 1

Really hope your help in this matters because i already out of ideas about this errors.

Another questions, sorry because asking different question on same topic but if you think 
i should make a new post for this question, i will do it as it should. Regarding my 
development on Linux Red Hat, how can i load PostGIS layer into my QGis application? 
This is my pieces of code about how i do it:

  QgsDataSourceURI * uri = new QgsDataSourceURI();
// set host name, port, database name, username and password
  uri->setConnection("localhost", "5432", "postgis", "postgres", "postgres");
// set database schema, table name, geometry column and optionaly subset (WHERE clause)
  uri->setDataSource("public", "klkv_poi2", "the_geom", "id=4");
  QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerPoi = new QgsVectorLayer(uri->uri(), myLayerBaseNamePoi, "postgres");

This code give me error:

Layer Not Valid

Hope you can give me an advice for this matters.


Thanks in advance,

bonar

Thats odd since in qgssinglesymbolrenderer.h we have:

 26 class CORE_EXPORT QgsSingleSymbolRenderer: public QgsRenderer
 27 {
 28   public:
 29     QgsSingleSymbolRenderer( QGis::GeometryType type );

and from qgsvectorlayer.h we have:

163     /** Returns point, line or polygon */
164     QGis::GeometryType geometryType() const;

So your first attempt should have been correct and working. Are you sure
you have 1.0 final and no stray headers from older versions?

thanks Marco, that's what I was looking for. It will take some time, before the

This is related to a specific shp, not very large (10 Mb). Removing
this, everything works well.
I can send it if someone wants to do more testing.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] controlling visibility
Message-ID: <49B689D8.8020802@gmail.com>

Hello devs,

I am very close to having a QgsTableProvider for loading, accessing, 
editing, and visualising non-spatial tables in QGIS. It is really quite 
simple, and essentially is an ogr provider for non-spatial data (i.e. 
can read dbf, csv, and probably postgres eventually as well). Currently, 
I can create a QgsVectorLayer with the 'table' provider, which is 
essentially just a normal QgsVectorLayer that has no spatial information 
(i.e. extent, geometries). You can do most things, including access the 
provider, and 'select', 'nextFeature', 'featureAtId', etc from there. 
The only problems that I have noticed so far are:

a) If Options > Rendering > 'By default new layers added to the map 
should be displayed' is checked, QGIS crashes when the table is loaded.
b) When added to the layer list, a polygon icon is displayed (I would 
like to change this to a attribute table icon).
c) Currently, when right clicking the table layer, all context menu 
items are visible (I would like to remove some of these options: remove 
everything except open attribute table, remove, toggle editing, and rename).

To address a), I would like to figure out how to automatically set the 
visibility of these 'table' layers to False, and keep it this way. I 
haven't really looked too much into b) and c), but if someone has a 
quick suggestion that would greatly help me out.

The reasons for attempting to implement a QgsTableProvider are several: 
1) It allows people to view non-spatial tables, edit them, and all sorts 
of useful things all from one place, and more importantly: 2) It will 
make joining and relating tables possible/much easier: OGR has the 
ability to join tables using SQL like queries, by I think this would 
make it possible to create non-permanent table joins in QGIS (an often 
requested feature).

My eventual goal would be to allow table joins, appending the additional 
tables to the Files list of a layer...

Anyway, any input/help is greatly appreciated, especially regarding the 
above items ;-)

Good news!
Do you plan to include spatialization of non-spatial tables as well,
taking x,y coor, as in the current text plugin?
Ready for testing as soon as an alpha version will be available.
All the best.

Message-ID: <e12429640903101042t229d1ba7y7c248000279b3602@mail.gmail.com>

I need to setup a Windows Vista pc with grass and qgis. I've installed
all the needed packages with osgeo4w setup tool.
QGis works very well but it crashed whenever I try to load grass datas
(both raster and vectors). Sometimes, some vectors are loaded, but I
get dbf.exe crashes when I open the properties dialog. Anyway I can't
reproduce it with a precise rule, so I simply says that, in general,
qgis-grass-plugin crashes...

In the non-osgeo4w native binary Qgis the grass tools were an
all-included feature. But now I see a qgis-grass-plugin in the osgeo4w
setup tool. Does it mean that, from now on, Qgis will rely on Grass
itself to make the grass toolbox work?

Message-ID: <200903110235.53762.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Good Morning List, 
The updated plugin installer is available for downloading.
I'll be glad to read any opinions about the new tab. 

CHANGELOG:
1) The list of URLs excluded from proxy is now respected.

2) Checking for updates on startup can be performed every several days now.
  
3) The new optional xml tag <experimental> is now supported. The value can be 
True or False. So now plugins can be either: official, contributed or 
experimental. The last one is designed for concepts and sandbox tools and it's 
at the author's / repo admin's discretion. See the third tab for more details.
I believe it's more reliable than a detailed tag: 
experimental/unstable/testing/stable/foo/blahblah/superstable 
what would be unclear and never up-to-date. Does everybody like this way? If yes 
I'll ask Gary for adding it to the central contributed repository. If no, we can 
discuss something more detailed.

4) Better support for the <qgis_minimum_version> and <qgis_maximum_version> 
tags. Note that the <qgis_minimum_version> is required while the 
<qgis_maximum_version> is optional and even not recommended. In most cases this 
tag is unnecessary and confusing, so please use it only if needed. This tag is 
only present in the repository xml, not in the plugin __init__.py file.  

A TIP: If you have written a plugin designed for BOTH QGISes 0.x and 1.x (like 
the installer itself), you need to set the both <qgis_minimum_version> and 
<qgis_maximum_version> tags. Otherwise the plugin is only visible in the QGIS 
line matching the <qgis_minimum_version> tag (it doesn't cross the 0.x/1.x api 
barrier).

5) Some small fixes: updated url of the repository of Faunalia, better trimmed 
xml tag values and user input strings etc.

Regards,
B.

After thinking a little about it I don't think it's a good idea to use
it as QgsVectorLayer. I think it's better to redefine a new
QgsTableLayer as done with QgsRasterLayer so to respect
QgsMapLayer::LayerType(). This way we would avoid problems with plugins
thinking it's a vector layer and geoprocessing empty geometries (now
mapcomposer and it's legend also comes to mind). Maybe it's a good idea
to create a tab in the layer legend to nonspatial tables.

I've thought about it some time ago and I always thought the interface
would be something like GvSIG and ArcGIS where the tables are all
(spatial and non-spatial) in a place where you can join/relate them
separate from the geometry representations.

I've put some thought about Join but with no good result. The only
useful thing I could think was that using ogr some providers are going
to be excluded from join features. I thought about inheriting
QgsVectorLayer as a QgsVectorLayerJoin where the data would be read
first from the second layer when rewind() and stored in a map so that we
could ask for each feature's joined record when nextFeature() was
called. But only works for 1*1 joins as we cannot change the number of
records on the first layer. Nevertheless, this would respect the usual
behavior of QgsVectorLayer and so would also work when a joined table
got inside plugins.

I'm really looking forward to this implementation.
Thanks, Carson

+1 from me. Carson, your current implementation sounds like a huge
hack, and hacking stuff like this into qgis core this way is probably
a bad idea! In an object-oriented context a table doesn't have the
qualities of a QgsMapLayer - srs, transparency, extent, etc - and so
shouldn't be a subclass of that.

  I'm not sure in what way a table is even a 'Layer'! You can't layer
one table on another... There may not be much common behaviour between
a data table and a map layer, so perhaps they should inherit from some
other class, or not at all. Maybe have a QgsData class and then
QgsMapLayer and QgsDataTable inherit from that. Then the legend
displays QgsData objects - perhaps grouped as maps and data tables.

 I'd then implement QgsDataTable to have a "provider" so you could
plug in different table types - CSV file, spreadsheet, RDBMS - or
maybe subclass them - QgsCSVDataTable, QgsXLSDataTable etc.

 I suspect you are leveraging off QgsVectorLayer so you can just
simply use the current attribute data table editor with no further
ado. The right thing would be to make that table editor available to
vector layers and data tables.

 Or possibly vector layers are a mix-in of a data table class and a
vector geometry class. But that would need some serious rewriting. But
it might mean that you could use attribute data from a vector layer in
the same way as a data table from a database...

 Just some thoughts over breakfast!

Hi,

As discussed yesterday on Qgis-User, I'm noticing a problem loading PostGIS layers using Qgis 1.0.1 and 1.1.0 (trunk build) on WinXP, installed using the OSGeo4W installer. This was discussed on IRC and we got a bit further looking for causes.

I have posted a debugview log of a typical session over here: http://wwwald.be/dl/qgis-postgis-dbgview.LOG

Startup looks normal, the postgresprovider.dll is loaded OK. But when actually loading the layer, there's this error message:

        (QgsVectorLayer::setDataProvider)  unable to get data provider

For now, that's the closest I am to finding the actual cause. Maybe someone with more development background in QGis can do a further suggestion? On IRC, "jef" already suggested to run DependencyWalker on postgresprovider.dll, but I'm not very familiar with doing this so any suggestions are welcome.


By the way: I also installed the "windows native" trunk build from http://www.norbit.de/67/. This build does load my PostGIS layers without problems...

Any ideas for further investigation are more than welcome! I hope I did the right thing sending this to QGis-Dev, my apologies if this is inappropriate...

Regards,
wwwald

List,

Based on several comments... I'm seriously thinking of abandoning this 
task to someone who actually knows how to program in C++. However, for 
the time being I'm going to keep plugging away at it ;-)

At this point, I am going to write a QgsDataTable (which will sort of be 
the non-spatial equivalent to QgsVectorLayer), and QgsOgrTableProvider. 
To start, you will not be able to view these tables directly in QGIS, 
but will essentially be able to modify them through code a la 
nextRecord, getRecordAtId, etc...

My hope is that eventually, this will lead to what Maur?cio de Paulo and 
Barry (see below) have suggested: separate tables from geometries. If we 
have a QgsDataTable, then QgsVectorLayer could have a function 
dataTable(), which would return a pointer to the vector layer's 
QgsDataTable. That way QgsVectorLayer could contain both the spatial 
information (QgsGeometryTable?), and the table information 
(QgsDataTable). This is similar to how a shapefile works, with geometry 
info in the .shp file, attribute info in the .dbf, and a .shx to tie it 
all together...

Obviously this is all a lot of work, but it might make things much 
simpler in the long run in terms of supporting different data sources, 
joining and relating tables, and accessing data quickly and efficiently...

Thoughts?

The first thing I noticed from reading some of your code is that you
still use pygresql. Mind to change it to QtSql? As we've talked before,
it already comes inside the regular qt windows pack. I didn't try
postgis manager on windows but on 1.0.0 preview it came with qtsql. Good
idea? Bad?

Hum... I didn't get any reply from testing the plugin so I decided to
upload it as a separate plugin for a while. For testing purposes as I
need feedback of it's usability and interest of the community in that I
keep on the work. Or else I can stop. :P Lie.

I still didn't take the time to write the Tools Editor, but I think you
can get the idea from the pic I sent last time. 

See ya.

Message-ID: <85bf19030903112141j7ab243c6g930c72ca0b570721@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I'm looking for a good Google Summer of Code project. Having used QGIS and
being a proficient Python/GIS programmer I think its the perfect fit. I did
some googling and saw that there is already some interest in a GDAL/OGR
front end, but I would really like to take this full on. The OGR-converter
plugin is not complete, as it can't do CRS transforms, and I hate to say I
don't find it very intuitive. Furthermore I think a lot of the GDAL/OGR
functionality should be able to be done "in-place" on layers, so one could
easily create a new layer from an existing one.

I think unifying CRS related options could also go a long way, using GDAL to
support more than just proj4 definitions and being able to create a custom
CRS from any place that you can select them.
Maybe its because my single biggest headache in learning GIS was dealing
with projections, and now that I understand them through the command line I
want to make it easier on others to deal with them. I think QGIS can be the
perfect tool for this because it is already great for visualization.

Please give me your feedback on this!
Thanks

Hi Ian,

I'm currently working on a GDAL frontend. In the first step it includes
only the warp / reproject part, but it is designed to be expanded
afterwards.

I think that the ogr plugin is very intuitive, but maybe that just my
opinion ;)

Best regards,
Florian

Hi Ian,

It would be very usefull to extend the existing ogr plugin with CRS support and "in-place" option as you suggest. If you do so, please keep us (and especially Mateusz, the author and maintainer of the ogr plugin) up to date about your progresses.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Godofredo,

do you mean translate a JPEG into a TIFF? Or what do you exactly mean?
The first function is only the reprojection between different crs, this
means: Select a rasterfile (e.g. epsg: 4326), choose new filename and crs
(e.g. epsg: 31467) and receive a new raster with the new crs.
All further function (gdal translate too) are also planed bit by bit ;)

Best regards,
Florian

Hi There,

Good discussion and I hope I am not intruding. 

Are you guys talking about a "Export Raster Data" dialog similar to what ArcMap has?

A UI where you can enter create-options, data-type, metadata and output-format? 

That would be nice but it doesn't look like a plugin but rather a internal implementation.

Just a thought.

Regards,

Ivan

Hi Mauricio!
I think this task is directed to the repository maintainers rather than to the 
Installer. A php script could catch every Installer's request for given .zip 
package and update the <download> tag in the repository xml. I hope it makes 
sense?

The installer can, of course, display the counter value if present in the xml 
file. In the future, as tags are getting more and more, we will have to change 
the layout of the Installer window and add a bigger html viewer. Then there will 
be place even for voting ;)

Regards,
B.

 I just did a quick grep and count from our web server logs, just for
the heck of it:

     20	autosave.zip
     51	clickfu.zip
     43	rasterlang.zip
     35	selectplus.zip
     27	spqr.zip
     84	topocolour.zip

 I reckon a lot of them might be robots though, since this is only
since Feb 24th and I've not had proportionally enough bug reports for
me to think this many people are using my code!

 There's been a debate on the R mailing list about assessing add-on
package quality from download counts. No definite conclusion was
reached!

Message-ID: <958D7475-A2D4-4243-BD96-283FDDD1E282@me.com>

Paolo,

Here is a link for the relevant qgm, image, and updated default.qgc  
files that return the ability to load layers from the map canvas  
directly into the current grass mapset using grass tools. Please test  
and commit if you are happy with them.

On OS X, the drop-down dialogs are partially cut-off, shown in the  
attached image. I don't know if there is a fix for this cosmetic  
concern.

With these applied, you can directly select qgis canvas layers without  
the need to look for the source file. I missed this functionality  
while doing some qgis/grass work the other day. Thanks to Juergen for  
pointing out the changeset that guided the vector edits.

Cheers,
John

It would be a big problem... Of course Installer could send a request for 
counting, but I'd prefer to avoid such complicating...

Sure. Note that usually "highest rated" and "most downloads" 
rankings firmly differ...

Message-ID: <e12429640903121617s3b6c5d9cj49d11b09b93f8fe8@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on Windows Vista, with the OSGeo4W stack.
Just to get in touch with the Windows environemnt, I've tried to run
the very first example (2_basic_main_window) from the tutorial from
Martin [1], last version.
I have:

 - corrected the QMapCanvas attribute from "useQImageToRender" to
"useImageToRender" (should the tutorial be updated?)
 - set the qgis_prefix to "C:\\OSGeo4W\\apps\\qgis-dev"
 - changed the hardcoded layer to one of mine

Running the script from the OSGeo4W shell I get a list of errors
referring to problems with various data providers:
http://www.geospatial.it/allegri/log.txt

The interface comes up, but nothing is rendered (obviously, having
seen the log!)
Is it something with the build of qgis_dev in the OSGeo4W package?
The same happens with QGis Kore.

Isn't it only a frontend to the existing google statistic? Probably counters on 
sites like kde-look etc would be more suitable. But probably it's a simple task 
for a PHP geek?:)

Sorry I was completely bogged down. I'm putting up the binary links
now. If anyone else has made binaries that you think I have missed
please let me know and I will get them onto download.qgis.org asap.

I will do 1.0.2 after FOSSGIS probably to include any fixes we make  
then too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] odd calls to classFactory for python plugins
Message-ID: <d8ad40b50903131043m3c0dc919o7894488088eb0241@mail.gmail.com>

I've been crashing Qgis a bit lately, and noticed it was producing the
R core dump error message. But none of my enabled plugins were using
R. Odd.

I ran strace and inferred that all my plugin classFactory methods were
being called, even for disabled plugins.

I wrote a simple plugin that printed a message on classFactory
__init__ call and classFactory initGui call.

When not enabled, I saw a message that the classFactory __init__ had
been called. The print didn't happen immediately, it seems to wait for
an event (menu item, canvas redraw).

On enabling the plugin from the manager and OK'ing, I get a
classFactory __init__ and a .initGui as expected.

 Some of us on #irc tracked down plugin loading to a few places, but
we got a bit lost and it's Friday evening... Anyone else want to
figure this out? We don't think classFactory should be called for
non-loaded plugins (even though in this case it must be failing for
some reason since otherwise the initGui method would run --
QgsPythonUtilsImpl::startPlugin runs them both in quick succession.

Message-ID: <79D5A046-4894-450A-AC2D-AB25248ED6F6@wildnevada.org>

Marco,

Is there a possibility to have the composer legend show vectors layers  
with the level of transparency in the map canvas. For instance, I have  
a land ownership layer that I drape over a hillshade. I set this layer  
to 50% transparency, but the map legend shows them at 100%. The colors  
can look quite different in the map and the legend as a consequence.

Hopefully this is doable. I think it would be a good improvement. I'll  
throw it in trac if you need, but will await your response first.

Cheers,
John

yes, I had a similar issue with some of my projects. But I don't know if 
it is very easy to solve? Potentially, there could be many layers with 
different transparency settings interacting with each other. Think of a 
transparent layer on a transparent layer on a transparent layer on a 
hillshade ... What should the legend do in this case?

It is definitely worth some thinking of course, since it is a real 
problem in the legend ... How do other GIS solve the problem?

        Hi Florian and Ivan:

Sorry for my late reply, I meant a raster dialog to wrap the funtionality
of gdal_translate. For example choose a raster file, select a new file, an
output format and the creation options to export from gtiff to ecw,
jpg2000 or any other format available in gdal. An example of such dialog
is the openev export tool.

The openev export tool is written in python and I tried to create a python
plugin borrowing the code but I couldn't make the progress callback of
gdalcreatecopy work. I always got a runtime error saying "object passed
is not a python function". Florian if you are working with python have you
faced this problem?

I can think in a class like QgsVectorFileWriter for rasters to enable a
"save as" option to export the currently selected raster layer in legend
to any gdal enabled format.

Also if you are doing something similar I would like to join efforts instead
of replicating work.

Regards
Godofredo Contreras

I saw some maps recently, presumably from ArcGIS, that had the vector  
transparency with a tiny sample of the underlying hillshade beneath.  
This would handle your concern for drapes, but would not account for  
multiple vector overlays. I think just having the vector transparency  
alone would be an improvement.

Hi all.
I think now SpatiaLite is now mature enough for its provider to be
included in qgis. This would be a major breakthrough, and a first for
qgis (see e.g.
http://moreati.org.uk/blog/2009/03/01/shapefile-20-manifesto/ ).
I have been discussing with Sandro about showing up the diffs only, but
apparently this is a bit complicated, because the provider requires
several new files, and modifications also to the building system.
I think Sandro is reliable enough to allow him to commit his code
straight into trunk (or in a separate branch, is absolutely necessary).
Please decide about this, and let's move towards new, higher targets!

Message-ID: <49BE5090.2050805@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
For the upcoming hackfest, I would like to point out a few important issues:
- first of all, the hackfest would be a good chance to close down
invalid/non reproducible/obsolete bugs, and fix easy bugs: a shorter
queue is the key for further work
- of course, solving the issue with label placement would be a major
success for the fest
- a few bugs that I find important to fix:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1079
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1181
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/377 and other issues about custom
projections

Infrastructure for python plugins:
Ideally this should:
- allow devs with privileges to upload their plugin
- do some consistency check (removing hidden, unnecessary files, .pyc
etc.) and pointing out missing elements (licence, minimum version, etc.)
- generate automatically the relevant entry in plugins.xml
- allow the maintainer to mark each plugin with the appropriate category
(sandbox, experimental, unstable, testing, stable), so users are warned
(but still allowed and encouraged to experiment).

I've applied the patch to trunk in r10286.

(in C++ it's fairly simple to remove a dock widget just by deleting
it, but in Python the widget is owned by main window, so it's more
tricky to get rid of it without removeDockWidget function).

Hello All,

I recently made some changes to the Grass Tools to allow drop-down  
menu selection of available canvas layers. On OS X, and apparently  
Debian Linux, the drop-down dialogs are partially cut-off as shown in  
the attachment. I don't know if this is a Qt-specific problem, but  
perhaps someone can suggest a fix for this.

I'm using Qt-4.5rc1 on my system.

Cheers,

Actually it's psycopg2, not pygresql. Currently I'm not a big fan of
rewriting it to support QtSql just because it might be a good idea.
There might be downsides:
- I'm using some psycopg extensions that might not be supported in qtsql
- I remember discussion on qgis-dev list regarding problems with
deployment on mac os x (no postgresql plugin in qt)
- new bugs due the rewrite
So for now I'll stick with psycopg until I'll have a reason to rewrite
it to qtsql.

When something isn't in a repository, people are too lazy to install
it manually :)

I'm going to update the examples to work with QGIS 1.0.

The errors are shown just with plugins (they're not providers). From
the log I see that providers loaded correctly.

You must first click on the upper left button to load and show the test layer.

AFAIK this loading on startup is done by plugin installer (after
downloading the list of plugins from repositories). Maybe Borys will
know more about it :)

Yes, the Installer loads them all in order to check them out. For example, if 
one of installed plugins has unfulfilled dependencies, the installer is that one 
responsible for an user-friendly explanation. Probably we should move this 
functionality to the core qgis (you know, add some explanation to the present 
error messages). 

I'll look at this issue. If it may be the reason of the instability, I can 
disable that functionality for now. I'm in a little hurry now, so I'll read this 
topic more carefully tomorrow (or on the HackFest;)

Hi Alex:

I think the MySQL Data Provider should be removed from the list of summer code
ideas. I already posted a patch in https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/515 to load 
all kind of database layers supported by ogr (mysql, oracle, postgres, sde, etc).

Done.
Thanks Godofredo.
Is there anything preventing us from applying the patch?
I also removed:
=== Interface Google mapping APIs with QGIS ===
AFAIK, there is a py plugin for this, but anyway such an usage will
break Google licence for data.

Quite right: that's why I'm always insisting to put as much as possible
in trunk or in main py plugin repo (even if I'm often unheard :) ).

 I don't think the cause of the crash is anything to do with the
plugin loading mechanism - or at least at the moment I don't have any
evidence for that. What confused me was that Qgis was showing an R
segfault error message even when I didn't have any R plugins enabled.

 I'll investigate what was causing my crashes later, I just got
sidetracked with this R message.

I was just waiting for feedback, but if there is no objection

I can apply it later today.

Hi Godofredo,

I'm not working with python. So I can't help you with your problem, sorry.

gdal translate would be a nice addition to the gdal plugin, but I'm coding
in c++. It would be great if we can merge our plugins in any way. Does
anybody has an idea for that?

Best regards,
Florian

Subject: [Qgis-developer] hackfest
Message-ID: <49BFC4B2.9010803@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
For the upcoming hackfest, I would like to point out a few important issues:

- first of all, the hackfest would be a good chance to close down
invalid/non reproducible/obsolete bugs, and fix easy bugs: a shorter
queue is the key for further work

- of course, solving the issue with label placement would be a major
success for the fest

- merging the diagram branch could lead to the release of 1.1, another
breakthrough

- some simple stuff:
  * add r.external (only available on grass64, so should be included
only if compiled against it): this is very powerful, as it allows GRASS
analyses on any raster, in their original format, without any need for
conversion (and apparently no major performance drawback)
  * smaller font and less space between modules in the grass tools
modules list
  * make it possible to copy and paste the info shown in the info popup

- a few bugs that I find important to fix:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1079
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1181
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/377 and other issues about custom
projections
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1387

- in several occasions (not always clear why, but especially with large
rasters and vectors) QGIS is now quite slow, occasionally unusable: this
could be addressed

- set up an infrastructure for python plugins:
Ideally this should:
  * allow devs with privileges to upload their plugin
  * do some consistency check (removing hidden, unnecessary files, .pyc
etc.) and pointing out missing elements (licence, minimum version, etc.)
  * generate automatically the relevant entry in plugins.xml
  * allow the maintainer to mark each plugin with the appropriate
category (sandbox, experimental, unstable, testing, stable), so users
are warned (but still allowed and encouraged to experiment).

If the hackfest will be reachable through IRC, I'm sure others
(including me) will join in and will be able to help.
All the best, and good luck.

Hi Paolo

We will discuss this topic (probably also at the QGIS booth at the 
conference). However, at the moment, many developers are busy advertising QGIS 
at the FOSSGIS conference, so have a little patience with us...

All the best,
Marco

Hi all

I had a look on Sandros patches this morning. As it only has very few changes 
in existing classes, I think it should go to trunk directly.

Gary, did you already give Sandro svn access (as decided by the PSC)?

Marco

Message-ID: <1691.131.173.65.74.1237369202.squirrel@webmail.rz.uni-osnabrueck.de>

Hi list,

I found a warp tutorial [1] for a simple reprojection yesterday, but it
doesn't work as it should.
The code creates a new GTiff with a new coordinate system, but the warp
seems to fail, because the coordinates are the same as in the origin. The
function GDALSuggestedWarpOutput already calculates the wrong output size,
so I think the error must be somewhere around the function
GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer. If I warp the image with console-based
gdalwarp (gdalwarp -s_srs epsg:31467 -t_srs epsg:4326 src dst) everything
works out fine.

I read somewhere in the web, that it might caused by a wrong path to the
gdal or proj libary, but I tried both dll paths (msys\bin and msys\lib).

Does anyone of you can support me in that?

Best regards,
Florian

Hi all.
I tried to update the page
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas
but I found that many ideas are really outdated (which means QGIS has
progressed a lot in one year - good!), and several items have already
been developed at some degree. As it stands, the page gives a misleading
impression about the project.
I do not know enough of current development status for several items, so
I would ask every dev to have a look to the page, and remove the items
they believe are so close to completion that they do not deserve a full
project.
I'm available for help, cleaning up etc., if necessary.
All the best.

Sorry: AFAICT svg are missing also from other places, notably all

Hi Godofredo:
I'm playing with your improvement, which I find quite useful. Most
layers (GRASS and PostGIS) could be loaded without fuss, but one
specific GRASS vector among those I tried causes QGIS to crash without
any warning on the command line. The same layer, opened from the grass
plugin, says:
No layers available in this map
So obviously the plugin is more robust than OGR access.
I'm attaching it here for further testing if you're interested.

Hi Godofredo
> Any suggestions and comments are welcome.
New add vector dialog looks great so far, just a few quick comments:

1) On my system, almost all of the drop-down menus in the initial dialog 
are not displaying at a reasonable height. This can be fixed by 
specifying a minimum height in Qt Designer.

2) I don't like that my password is displayed when a postGIS layer is 
loaded. I think there is a 'display-safe' way of returning a postGIS 
connection string, so you way want to have a look at that.

3) For postGIS connections, I don't suppose it would be possible to have 
the ability to specify a 'WHERE' clause similar to the current 'add 
postGIS' tool. Perhaps this could be done from the sub-layer dialog?

Anyway, just my two cents ;-)

Message-ID: <e12429640903180942n7738e4a0r74e83e5d4e1b0eab@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I'm going on with my battle to compile qgis+grass on windows vista...
very frustrating!
I've almost finished to compile grass under mingw, as AFAIK it's the only
way to do it. Am I wrong?
I've built its various dependencies (like GDAL, proj, libtiff, freetype,
etc.) under ingw too.
Now, what to do with QGIS? I know it should be compiled with MSVC, at least
it's the way choosen for OSGeo4W stack. So I should rebuild GDAL, and all
the rest of the stuff, with MSVC? And, at the end, how to build the
grass-qgis plugin? Isn't it a problem having compiled the various parts with
different systems?

Ok, I admit, I'm a bit confused working on Windos. Linux is more linear to
me! :)

 Hi Giovanny:

 

You can use the libs and includes bundled with osgeo4w to build qgis and

grass plugin.

 

Using osgeo4w do the following:

 

install grass from desktop category

install grass-devel-vc from libs (be sure is the same version that grass ) 

install gdal from libs

install geos from libs

install sqlite from libs

install proj from libs

install xpat from libs

install gsl from libs

 

create the environment variable LIB_DIR pointing to c:/osgeo4w and run

cmakesetup, after that set GRASS_PREFIX to the grass instalation directory

(something like c:/osgeo4w/apps/grass/gras-6.4.0R3)

 

And thats all, start compiling with visual studio or nmake

 

Hope this helps

 

Regards 

Godofredo Contreras

Hi Godofredo,
thanks for your hints. I'll tru it as soon as possible. In the meanwhile
could you help me to clarify some other related aspects?
 1 - how were the various libs you listed built? VS or MinGW. AFAIK they're
used both from Grass and QGIS, am I wrong? I thought that Grass couldn't use
libs built with VS...
 2 - this is the qgis ml but do you know how grass was built (osgeo4w
msys+mnigw would be ok?) and, related to the previous question, against
which libs?

Thanks very much for helping to dig in the Windows world :)

Hi Paolo.

Source svg for 'gis' theme is not available in src yet.
All icons from this theme are in one file including my sketch and I need time to
clean it up. Due to permanent lack of time - impossible for me in March.
I can send you this file ...

You can look into c:/osgeo4w/lib for files ending with .lib these are the import libraries for msvc. In the case of libmysql.lib, libpq.lib, and the grass import libraries (grass_arraystats.lib, grass_bitmap.lib) is almost sure that they are compiled with msys/mingw and later the import libraries were created with msvc implib tool. This can be done because msys/mingw and msvc compilers are compatible at c level (not compatibles at c++ level) also you can create an import library for msys/mingw from msvc dll using dlltool.


>2 - this is the qgis ml but do you know how grass was built (osgeo4w msys+mnigw would >be ok?) and, related to the previous question, against which libs?

The only way to build grass in windows is using msys/mingw and it should use the msys/mingw libraries. 

If you don't need to rebuild grass, the libs and dlls bundled with osgeo4w works correctly to build qgis with grass suport using msvc.

To know exactly what compiler was used for libs in osgeo4w you can try asking in osgeo4w-dev mailing list

 Hi Giovanny:

 

You can use the libs and includes bundled with osgeo4w to build qgis and

grass plugin.

 

Using osgeo4w do the following:

 

install grass from desktop category

install grass-devel-vc from libs (be sure is the same version that grass ) 

install gdal from libs

install geos from libs

install sqlite from libs

install proj from libs

install xpat from libs

install gsl from libs

 

create the environment variable LIB_DIR pointing to c:/osgeo4w and run

cmakesetup, after that set GRASS_PREFIX to the grass instalation directory

(something like c:/osgeo4w/apps/grass/gras-6.4.0R3)

 

And thats all, start compiling with visual studio or nmake

 

Hope this helps

 

Regards 

Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] build qgis-grass plugin on Windows

Hi. I'm going on with my battle to compile qgis+grass on windows vista... very frustrating!
I've almost finished to compile grass under mingw, as AFAIK it's the only way to do it. Am I wrong?

I've built its various dependencies (like GDAL, proj, libtiff, freetype, etc.) under ingw too.
Now, what to do with QGIS? I know it should be compiled with MSVC, at least it's the way choosen for OSGeo4W stack. So I should rebuild GDAL, and all the rest of the stuff, with MSVC? And, at the end, how to build the grass-qgis plugin? Isn't it a problem having compiled the various parts with different systems?


Ok, I admit, I'm a bit confused working on Windos. Linux is more linear to me! :)

Message-ID: <533634166.20090318203516@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

I'm not sure I've put this bug [1] in the right tracker, but it is quite
annoying as many people that I work with are trying to install QGIS
using OSGeo4W in the folder which is different from default
(c:/osgeo4w). This results in some problems, couple of which are:

1. To be able to run QGIS, qgis.bat should be edited to reflect
changes in the install folder

2.  QSQLITE  driver doesn't show up in the list of sources of QGIS and
subsequently SQLite drivers cannot be used.

If QGIS is installed with Express option to C:\OSGeo4W folder, everything works ok by default.

Am I missing something obvious or can we do something about it?

Hi All,

i'm having some problems to use Qgis on osx.
I'm building the actual trunk from the svn source,
using cmake the build ends without errors but
tring to load any vector data (like a simple .shp)
i've a qgis-freeze and i need to force quit qgis.app.

An other really strange "behavioure":
buildng qgis using Xcode the build ends without errors
and i've a working qgis (thanks to kingchaos!),
unluchy it cant load plug-in as :
the plug-in installer ans symbology-ng, giving me these error log :

crash/force-quit log (qgis cmake - build)

Thanks Robert.
In fact it seems that most svg are missing, not only yours. This is a
problem of missing the sources and having only the compiled form
(although reverse engineering is much easier with images than with code
:) ), so I guess the situation should be corrected.
In the meantime, if you can put the file in a public place, this might help.
All the best.

Message-ID: <40cd9ce40903190107r1c421eb2v12cdee453503e82e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I would like to know if there was some project to port Qgis on arm
smartphones like the Openmoko Freerunner. This would bring free smartphones
a great mobile gis tool.
I do not know if there is a lot of work to do or not.

There is already a port of Gvsig mobile (java based), with basic features
(load shapefiles, choose projection, load wms, connect to gps and
autocenter):
http://gvsigmobileonopenmoko.wordpress.com/
This tool is very promising, but for me it lacks the ability to be easily
extended as qgis is with python plugins (or using qgis core for one specific
application). And I am not a java fan :D

For those who do not know the Openmoko project , have a look here:

 But does it still segfault if you don't have any R plugins in your
plugin folders? By that I mean not just loaded but disabled, but not
even there at all? You need to delete any R plugin folders from your
plugin folder (or maybe make them unreadable).

 What I thought was weird was getting an R error message when I didnt
have any R plugins enabled. This was because the plugin installer was
loading all plugins (even disabled ones) to see if it could possibly
load them if asked. Hence any segfault caused an R segfault message,
because R was trapping segfaults.

 You might have just found a segfault problem in Qgis itself, no R involved!

Marco Hugentobler has already made a basic port of QGIS to openMoko.  
Its not released anywhere yet and has only basic functionality. In  
order to do a more complete port it would be needed to build up an  
entirely new UI suitable for the mobile platform.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Where to release a plugin
Message-ID: <49C3352D.90007@wildintellect.com>

So while not done, I'd like to start getting more people involved with
the Metadata editor plugin my colleagues and I started. We have a
sourceforge trac/svn instance and mailing for managing additional
contributors which we now openly welcome.

The question in this email though is where is the best place to put the
plugin so it can be installed via the python plugin manager. Sourceforge
isn't conducive to setting up a qgis style plugin repo, unless someone
can show me how to do this in trac and since it's a community project I
don't really want to stick it on my personal server.

Is this an appropriate thing to add to the Contributed plugins?

And yes it's only Alpha at this point, it's a metadata reader but it's a
good start.

Most of the libraries are build with MS Visual C++ Express 2008.   Some
are build with mingw if the only were necessary for GRASS and didn't
have some way to build them with VC already.

GRASS is build with MinGW.  There are a few binaries that I took from
the MinGW install (regex I think).

And about wxPython I lost track.  It think I started with precompiled
binaries, then built it with VC 2008 and later even switched to VS2003 -
which the python in OSGeo4W was built with.   But those would just
change the symtoms of the SWIG problem I have with wxnviz+wxvdigit, but
not cure them.

Hi,

I discovered that ZoomToLayer function doesn't work if the layer with
selected features is not "selected in the list of layers".
I do this:

                    mapCanvas=self.iface.mapCanvas()
                    mapCanvas.setExtent(lay.extent())
                    mapCanvas.zoomToSelected()
                    mapCanvas.refresh()

how can I select that layer?

Too early: I discovered the trick: use mapCanvas.setCurrentLayer (lay)

Thanks Jurgen, I thought that GRASS couldn't link to the most part of
VC++ built libraries, but it isn't true as I can see...
Sorry for the next question (I'm just starting to dig in the Windows
world): can, theretically, wxvdigit/wxnviz be built using
python+swig+wxwidgets precompiled and already installed (not from
osgeo4w) on the Windows machine?

Hi Qgis-Developers,

I would like to use QgsMapCanvas.setWheelAction but always get a
AtrributeError or not defined error.

Here is what I tried:
previewMap.setWheelAction(QgsMapCanvas.WheelZoomToMouseCursor,2)

where previewMap is of type QgsMapCanvas

I also tried
previewMap.setWheelAction(QgsMapCanvas.WheelAction.WheelZoomToMouseCursor,2)
or
previewMap.setWheelAction(WheelAction.WheelZoomToMouseCursor,2)

with no success.

Any idea what would be the correct syntax?

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

Message-ID: <32270.193.246.86.39.1237559391.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi QGIS-Developers!

It would be nice if we could have a status indicator when loading a
qgis-project. Some of my project have 20+ layers and when loading such a
project, QGIS seems to do nothing for a couple seconds (up to half a
minute).

Some of my users then think that the program hangs or crashed.

I think it would be great to have some sort of indication of what QGIS is
doing while loading a project, telling the user which dataset it is
currently loading, rendering or working on:

Some of the options:
* Write a messag in the statusbar to indicate which layer qgis is working on
* a dialogue displaying the progress
* a progress bar
* a list of layers to load and a status indicator to tell which layer is
already loaded and which layers are still pending

Thanks for discussing this issues among you developers,
Andreas

PS: if you want, I can open a feature request in trac.

Hi,

I am trying to enable antialiasing for my QgsMapCanvas with python.

I use
previewMap.enableAntiAliasing(True)

just after creating the QgsMapCanvas, just after creating it, setting the
CanvasColor and the units.

However, the map layers still draw without antialiasing.

I am using the latest trunk (from today) on Ubuntu 64bit.

Can you confirm that this works at your QGIS installations?

Thanks,
Andreas

I've just tried calling iface.mapCanvas().enableAntiAliasing() with
both true and false value from python console and it seems to work for
me.

Indeed, someone added functionality of WheelZoomToMouseCursor and
forgotten to add the python binding. Fixed in trunk in r10327.

This is the problem! I need to recompile qgis-grass plugin for a newer
version of grass... I wanted to try Marco Pasetti's way [1], but I'm
not sure how and if it's possible to be integrated in the osgeo4w qgis
cinfiguration.

Hi Paolo:

 

Thank you for the feedback, I will test it and try to fix the problem if it

is ogr provider specific or post a bug in gdal/ogr trac.

I will fix this the weekend and commit the changes.

Yes, I will modify the sublayers dialog to add the ability to specify an ogr sql

sentence, this way the user can filter the fields he or she wants to load and

also specify a where clause.

I have a Nokia N810, which has a lot of similarities to the Freerunner: GPS,
very high dpi touchscreen, Linux-based OS, etc.
I've been thinking for quite some time about running QGIS on it, because the
potential of a mobile GIS is amazing.  My concern is that full-blown QGIS
isn't going to run very nicely on either the Freerunner or the N810.  I
routinely work with several raster layers and large vector layers, which is
enough to humble my laptop.  With 128 MB of RAM and a 400MHz processor, I
expect QGIS to run unbearably slowly, even with smaller layers.  Maybe Marco
has evidence to the contrary; if so, that would be great!

I've been pondering an application designed from the ground up as a mobile
GIS.  As Tim pointed out, the UI has to be redesigned.  Some other shortcuts
would need to be taken to improve rendering speed.  My thinking has been
focused on field cartography for orienteering maps, but it could probably be
extended to handle general GIS work.  Right now, I'm just getting my feet
wet with mobile development, but I'll keep you all updated on my plans and
progress.

Hi Kimaidou and Steven

Yes, I'm using QGIS on my openmoko with qt-extended 4.4.2. But it is far from 
a productive state, it was more like a project for some evening during the 
christmas time and now I unfortunatelly don't have time to work on it anymore.

Still it is quite usefull for me as it displays the GPS coordinate and I can 
load a tiff file, zoom and pan and show a red circle at the current position. 
Some things are hardcoded at the moment (e.g. the transformation from wgs84 to 
the swiss coordinate system).
The application is not QGIS with all the dialogs. The application has its own 
small gui and just links to qgis_core. The speed is not very fast but still 
quite good for mobile use (ca. 2sec. delay for pans on a 25 mbyte tiff).

I'm uploading the cross-compiled libraries and (modified) qgis sources to the 
link below. The sources need to be modified because in qt extended, some 
classes don't exist (e.g. QCursor)

http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/openmoko/

Regards,
Marco

P.S: I heared two weeks ago that Nokia does not continue the development of 
qt-extended. So it probably would make sense to build upon another platform 
now.

i did 3 attempts, but none of them has worked.

1. directly installed to win xp professional service pack 3 and gives
following error:

qgis.exe - Unable To Locate Component
This application has failed to start because QtCore4.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

2. as virtual os with virtual box. guest: win xp sp3, host: win vista home
premium sp1

clean operation system. qgis not installed previously, but the same error.

3. directly in win vista home premium sp1

the same error.

i had some free time. :-)
i hope this will help.

Hi Marco,

Thanks for this information - all looks very interesting. I had
previously mentioned to this list about running QGIS on the Openmoko,
but didn't have the skills to make it happen myself. I look forward to
trying out your version.

You're right, Nokia have dropped QT Extended, but it seems to have
been kept afloat (for now) by the community as the snappily titled QT
Extended Improved:

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Qt_Extended_4.4.3

It would be interesting to see this running on the more mainstream
distributions, however.

Cheers, Joseph

Hi,
after copying a bunch of qt4 libraries to the windows system folder it
seems to works fine.

I cannot see the plugin installer, should be included in your package?

Do you plan to add Grass soon?


thanks

yes i forgot some qt4 .dll ...
I don't know what is a plugin installer...i always use linux qgis 
version, but i developing some c++ qgis plugins now and i need a mingw 
windows version too.
Simply I copy a .dll plugin in plugins/ directory.
Now compiling a qgis 1.0.1-2 and packaging with missing dlls.

I'm referring to the plugin "plugin installer", the plugin to allows you
to install 3rd party python plugins that do reside in plugin
repositories. If I'm not wrong the python-qgis library is necessary to
have this important feature of qgis.

Sorry for asking again,
what about grass?


thanks in advance

I have finally tested it, and it now seems in very good shape.
The speed increase is really amazing.
I still prefer the previous way of activating actions (zoom to selected
etc.), with a single click on a button, to the one implemented here
(click on action and selecting one of the items from the dropdown menu).
Any opinions?
All the best, and thanks a lot Martin!

I am pleased to see that you're having the hackfest?to improve QGIS. If want some data to test with QGIS, I have lots. I have a 2500 km sq?area of northern Manitoba having topographical mapping with 7 layers and 30 shape files of 234 Mb. This mapping was done with orthophotography?of .5m pixels and is quite detailed. You are welcome to use that dataset for testing QGIS,

I have found significant performance issues in QGIS?with this data the draws take at least 30 seconds for an area of 50 km X 34 km for the water layer. I could FTP it to you. I haven't even tried loading the ortho?photos which are .5m resolution and are 5 km X 5 km with a file size of 293Mb.

I can FTP this dataset to a site of your choosing if you want to use it.

Hi all

Thanks a lot for your replies. A few information, comment here:
* yes qtextended is not dead, since the community saved the baby.
* it would be great to port qgis on the other distributions, but for that,
we will need to find or compile the qt librairies. At this time, they are
available "easily" for debian based distributions, but not for SHR (the more
used community distribution).
* Since we wont use a mobile gis as a desktop one, there is no need to run
the whole thing on the openmoko. Getting GPS position, loading one or 2 ogr
vector files and one raster or one wms layer would be great.
* The difficulty is to think about a finger friendly gui (the openmoko
screen is small).

Anyway this could be a great adventure !
I will be on vacation the folling week, but will come back soon :D

Hi Bob,

The QGIS is now over, as far as I know, but your data might still be 
useful for performance testing of QGIS trunk.

I'd like the mention that the display of very large rasters is normally 
not a problem if you used gdaladdo to add pyramids to your data. You can 
use rasters with the hundreds of gigs of filesize without a bottleneck. 
You'd have to build the pyramids however. If you store your data in 
multiple files instead of just one, you should build a tileindex with 
gdaltindex. See http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html for more infos.

You should definitively give the display of rasters in qgis a try - they 
should perform well.

The display of big vector data is another issues. Did you build spatial 
indices? Are you directly loading from the shapefiles or from postgis? 
In realworld scenarios you should use various scale levels and reduce 
your vector data with SQL WHERE clauses (e.g. only display major rivers 
in a river network). If you display tenthousands/hundredthousands of 
vector features in one display, you probably have generalization and map 
reading problem anyway. There is no value in displaying all of your 
vector features, say on a state level when you totally clutter your map 
display and can't distinguish individual features anymore.

This doesn't mean that performance shouldn't be improved in QGIS. I just 
mean that there are ways for you to improve performance with the 
existing QGIS by improving the data structure of your existing data.

It also worked for me, even in vista, but if you can add python options, it
will be perfect.

in Linux, svn version of qgis is 1.1.0.

Hi there.

I am writing a C++ plugin to support Oracle Spatial GeoRaster on QGIS
and I would like to know how to proceed to contribute that code.

The plugin is just a UI that looks a lot like the PostGIS UI. It only 
requires GDAL to compile the plugin. But the UI will be useless if GDAL 
cannot find the driver plugin (gdal_GEOR.dll or gdal_GEOR.so).

My best regards,

Hi all.
Thanks for your efforts at the hackfest. I hope you enjoyed it a lot. We
already got some money from our donors programme, and I'm confident
we'll have enough to organize another fest not too far in the future (I
think twice a year would be good, do you agree?). I think it would be
very good if:
- one of you could write a press report on the successes of the fest: if
it is clear that such things help effectively, people will be happier
donating; I'll translate it in Italian and propagate to the IT community
and magazines
- a 1.0.2 could be released real soon, so to make it clear it is one of
the results of the fest; I do not think there should be any problem, as
I'm regularly using trunk, and I think it is even more stable than 1.0.1.
Thanks a lot.

Hi Godofredo.
I tried pushing the provider a bit further, asking it to open a
SpatiaLite file, but it fails to recognize spatial data (including
projections, and crashes when trying to open the attached table.
Nothing serious I guess, I know SpatiaLite support is still
experimental, but it might be interesting to know.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Request of statement about qgis libraries.
Message-ID: <20090323104710.GC4244@mithrandir>

Hi folks

On the basis of a brief discussion about Qgis 1.0.x libraries this is 
the current point of view by Debian packagers about the status of 
Qgis SONAMEs.

Currently 1.0.1 uses 

Core library:

  SONAME               libqgis_core.so.1.0

Non-core that depends on core:

  SONAME               libqgis_gui.so.1.0
  SONAME               libqgispython.so.1.0

Plugins that depends on core/non-core:

  SONAME               libcoordinatecaptureplugin.so
  SONAME               libcopyrightlabelplugin.so
  SONAME               libdelimitedtextplugin.so
  SONAME               libdelimitedtextprovider.so
  SONAME               libdxf2shpconverterplugin.so
  SONAME               libgeorefplugin.so
  SONAME               libgpsimporterplugin.so
  SONAME               libgpxprovider.so
  SONAME               libgridmakerplugin.so
  SONAME               libinterpolationplugin.so
  SONAME               libmemoryprovider.so
  SONAME               libnortharrowplugin.so
  SONAME               libogrconverterplugin.so
  SONAME               libogrprovider.so
  SONAME               libpostgresprovider.so
  SONAME               libquickprintplugin.so
  SONAME               libscalebarplugin.so
  SONAME               libspitplugin.so
  SONAME               libwfsplugin.so
  SONAME               libwfsprovider.so
  SONAME               libwmsprovider.so

Now, someone said that API for 1.x is frozen, but ABI could change at every
release, i.e. 1.1 would break 1.0 ABI compatibility (is that confirmed?). 

That justifies the use of a 1.0 versioning of SONAMEs, but implies that 
debian/control uses the wrong name for libqgis*, which should be libqgis1.0 
currently instead and libqgis1.1 for Qgis 1.1.x. 
It is due to avoid problems with selective upgrades and third-parties 
plugins (it is considered a serious bug FYI, because violates Debian Policy).

If ABI could change for each patchlevel, 1.x.y should be used in SONAMEs,
and package names should change as consequence. So what's definitively 
required is fixing a roadmap for API/ABI changes, and following it,
in order to allow distributors doing their work and avoid problems
to other developers and users.

Same considerations apply to Python interface per se, IF both 
API and/or ABI changes could be expected independently on the C++ interfaces
(e.g. if python interfaces changed more rapidly).
In that case python related packages should declare their interface level,
to avoid dangerous mixing with compiled objects. At least currently it is
NOT expected on the basis of current package style. But is this true?

Those are currently the major blockers to even _think_ of having Qgis in 
Debian again. A well-defined policy need to be stated and followed.

Hi,

I discovered that viewing any type of raster at 2:1 scale is VERY slow.

This is strange because, franlky, you see a scaled image of about 10x10
pixels.

Your best bet is to file this as a patch in trac:

Hi Andreas:
??????????????????? thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your suggestions for improving the performace?of my data with QGIS. I had not tried any of these improvements, except for building an index for my vector data, which didn't make any improvements in performance. I could do a little bit of generalization of the vector data but I am not displaying it at a small enough scale to vastly improve the performance for the amount of time required to do this.

If you have a FTP site where I could put this data then please let me know and I will make it available to you.

??? Bob

The QGIS?is now over, as far as I know, but your data might still be 
useful for performance testing of QGIS?trunk.

I'd like the mention that the display of very large rasters is normally 
not a problem if you used gdaladdo?to add pyramids to your data. You can 
use rasters with the hundreds of gigs of filesize?without a bottleneck. 
You'd have to build the pyramids however. If you store your data in 
multiple files instead of just one, you should build a tileindex?with 
gdaltindex. See http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html for more infos.

You should definitively give the display of rasters in qgis a try - they 
should perform well.

The display of big vector data is another issues. Did you build spatial 
indices? Are you directly loading from the shapefiles or from postgis? 
In realworld scenarios you should use various scale levels and reduce 
your vector data with SQL WHERE clauses (e.g. only display major rivers 
in a river network). If you display tenthousands/hundredthousands of 
vector features in one display, you probably have generalization and map 
reading problem anyway. There is no value in displaying all of your 
vector features, say on a state level when you totally clutter your map 
display and can't distinguish individual features anymore.

This doesn't mean that performance shouldn't be improved in QGIS. I just 
mean that there are ways for you to improve performance with the 
existing QGIS by improving the data structure of your existing data.

Andreas

This is somewhat unrelated to the original problem...
I suggest you to put it into Trac and someone will likely fix it :)

Hi.
Have you tried pyramidizing it?
What are the results?

Message-ID: <49C78E54.9040202@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
There is a problem in PROJ4: there are several datum for EPSG 3003 (and
others), but in PROJ4 the epsg file does not allow a relation 1:n with
present format (thanks Markus for clarifying this).
Currently, users need to define their special SRS, which is cumbersome
and scary for newbies. GRASS solved it recently:
http://grass.osgeo.org/screenshots/gui.php#wxpython
-> Location wizard (geodetic datum selection for EPSG 3003 - Italy mainland)
Would it be feasible to copy the approach and port it to QGIS?
All the best.

If you built your own grass then you can create your msvc import libraries:

 

Copy and save the following sed script to mkdef.sed in the directory

where your grass dlls are located.

 

/Dump of file / {

s/Dump of file \([^ ]*\)$/LIBRARY \1/p

a\

EXPORTS

}

/[ ]*ordinal hint/,/^[ ]*Summary/ {

/^[ ]\+[0-9]\+/ {

s/^[ ]\+[0-9]\+[ ]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ ]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ ]\+\([^ =]\+\).*$/ \1/p

}

}

 

Download and install sed utility from:

 

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm

 

Make sure sed directory is in the environment variable path

Open Visual Studio C++ command line.

change working directory to the directory where your grass dlls are located

 

Execute the following commands for every grass dll ({grassdll} must be changed to

grass dll name) :

 

dumpbin /exports {grassdll} | sed -nf mkdef.sed > {grassdll}.def

lib /def:{grassdll}.def /machine:x86

 

Those commands will create {grassdll}.lib that you can use with

visual studio.

Hi Paolo:

 

The ogr driver for sqlite is outdated and does not work with Spatialite. 

It uses diferent table structure that spatialite (for example in sqlite driver

the table spatial_ref_sys uses a column named SRTEXT while spatialite has

a column named proj4text).  I have been working in an ogr driver for spatialite

based in sqlite driver, solving the problems with tables structures and solving

the problems with constrains but it needs more work and more testing.

 

Regards

Wow Godofredo, thanks a lot. This sed script is something magic to me! :)
Does the QGis build chain permit to build only the grass-plugin?

So many questions, I'm sorry, but thi are my very first steps to
compile in the Microsoft env!

I confirm. Seems QGIS goes into some looong loop when trying to zoom to
extreme. You can't interrupt the rendering then and the memory usage
jumps rapidly. Memory leak?

1. Load a georeferenced raster.
2. Set-up your project CRS and units accordingly.
3. Try to set zoom level to 1:1 or finer (e.g. zoom in with mouse wheel
quick).
4. Wait for ages or run out of memory.

If bulding pyramids is not an option, at least convert your rasters to
stripped instead of tiled. From my experience they render ways faster in
QGIS. Also use some performance-oriented compression like LZW instead of
e.g. deflate, if needed at all.

Do they help for rendering performance in QGIS? I gues they improve
querying only (correct me please if that's wrong).

You might try to enable "Fix problems with..." in display options. That
enables hardware render accel (though crashes the whole GNOME for me in
case of some vector datasets!). BTW - please devs rename this option if
possible.

Note that this approach is good for display only. For digitizing or
sometimes for querying even it's not a feasible option.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Data for QGIS Hackfest
Message-ID: <ce98c48a4ebeb.49c7cbe6@shaw.ca>

Here is some more detail on this dataset:
 
I am currently displaying two layers, one a layer of polygons on the
water layer and one a layer of points of officially named features in our
province. Both are SHAPE files on disk, the water polygons have 4821
features while the geo names have 16210 features which extend far,
far beyond the limits of the water polygons. I am trying to attach the
names to water polygons and checking them so I am viewing them
together.
 
When I select a row from the table of the geo names and try to zoom
to it using the tool QGIS goes into limbo and never does get to the
location. This is awful performance. However when I select a row from
the water polygon table and zoom to it then it goes there without a
problem. I really didn't want to 'window out' the geo names for the
area that I am working in but out of desperation I will try that next.
 
Another interesting aspect of these layers is my background layer
for the water layer which is a layer of polygons of the spaces
between the map edges, water polygons and rivers. The display
of this layer causes a sudden performance drop in QGIS, a draw
goes from 3 seconds to 20 seconds.

I'm using postgresql 8.3.7 headers but I think I should use the

Hi.
Have you tried pyramidizing it?

The package is called libpq in OSGeo4W and includes the headers files.

Hi Maciej,

as a temporary fix, remove line 15 from DlgDbError.py file. It looks
like postgis manager is going to display an error message, but fails
before showing it :)

Having the boost from hackfest, I'd like to apply for SoC to finally
implement labeling with collision detections and rotation of labels
etc.
So it would be good if some of the devs were willing to mentor the
project (if it will be accepted).

I tried to fetch it from the above site but it says download max
reached. Can you send me privately a wgettable url that I can use to put
your binary on to download.qgis.org?

Also could you build a version 1.0.1? I know many users will be
extremely grateful for your efforts.

Regards

Yes we discussed this at the hackfest. We would like to hold our next on
in Prague in October 09. To do this we need to raise an average of USD
$500 per developer attending. Assuming 10 developers that means we will
need to raise $ USD 5000 to make this happen. We would like to also
encourage non developers to come because it was extremely useful having
them in Hannover and there are many hackfest activities they can
contribute with including documentation cleanups, translations, giving
inputs to user interface and user interaction ideas. It would also be
great to have a dedicated non-dev to do the blogging, media etc next
time. Someone with a bit of media skills and a good eye for presentation
would be great.

I did quite a lot of work blogging about the event, making interviews
with developers etc during the event. I wont have any more time to
create press releases etc since I need to work like a dog to catch up
the time missed for the hackfest now. :-( There is a whole heap of
material on the blog that anyone is welcome to use for the purpose
including a nice group shot (sorry Marco wasnt there for the photo :-( )

I still have not even officially announced version 1.0.1 since we are
waiting on a few packages. I think we can do 1.0.2 in a month or so.
Assuming I have got the shiny new mingw package online, I will announce
1.0.1 this weekend.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SpatiaLite data provider added to SVN trunk
Message-ID: <49C950EC.10408@lqt.it>

I've just added to "QGis SVN trunk" the support for the
SpatiaLite Data Provider

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis qgis_unstable
[rev.10414]

==========================================================
in CMake: WITH_SPATIALITE OFF
let anything in the "classic" state [no SpatiaLite support]

otherwise: WITH_SPATIALITE ON
will build the SpatiaLite data provider as well.

If you need some SpatiaLite's sample DB, you can found
them on:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/QGisJanus/

=========================================================
obviously you must build and install SpatiaLite before
attempting to build QGIS using WITH_SPATIALITE ON

You can found the latest SpatiaLite's sources at:

http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.3/

SpatiaLite requires the following dependencies:

- GEOS 3.0.x or GEOS 3.1.x
- PROJ 4.6.x
- SQLite 3.6.x

Sandro

The Institute for Environmental Planning in Hannover also asked, if we can write
something they can link to on their webpages. I will write a report from all the
material and put it on the QGIS website, soon.

I added a website with a hackfest report and updated the news banner on
qgis.org. Feel free to add more information or changes.

I'm working on adding this to the OSX Xcode project.  One problem I  
found is that qgsspatialiteprovider.h needs to include <stdio.h>  
before gaiageo.h, because gaiageo needs FILE.

Also (for the cmake build), if spatialite is compiled with PROJ and  
GEOS support, this needs to be detected somehow and include paths and  
link libraries added to the spatialiteprovider cmakelists.txt.  The  
spatialite code in the Qgis app target seems to be OK without GEOS.

a few days ago I have spoken with Martin Dobias about possibility to
organize QGIS/GRASS Hackfest in Prague. In October (17-18) we are
organizing the workshop [1] as every year at the CTU in Prague. It's
seems to me as a very good idea to join this two events! Our workshop
is a little friendly event. We can offer you a working room for 2-3
days before/after the workshop in the university campus with very good
connectivity.

Best regards, Martin

Spatialite added to the OSX Xcode project.  Assuming that the  
<stdio.h> include I mentioned is applied to qgsspatialiteprovider.h,  
it works. Cool.

As with most of the rest of the dependencies in the Xcode project (due  
to the lack of conditional targets and sources), Spatialite is a  
requirement.  This is easy with my SQLite framework, which has  
Spatialite built into it (make sure to update to today's 3.6.11-2  
release), and this is the default configuration.  Of course, a  
standard library build should also work (though I haven't tested it).

 Python or C++?

 Here's some python code from one of my plugins:

http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/trunk/topocolour/adjlayer.py

 The 'make' function creates a new vector layer called 'vl' using the
'memory' provider. The layer has 'LineString' features (line 8). Each
feature has three attributes (lines 11-13).

 Then a loop adds some features using information from the 'ig' object
passed in.
  * construct a QgsGeometry object from some QPoint() objects
(QgsgeometryFromPolyline)
  * set the geometry of the feature (fet.setGeometry) and add the
attributes (fet.setAttributes).
  * add the feature to the layer provider (pr.addFeatures).

 Once that's done you may want to add the layer to the Qgis map registry.

 Translating this to C++ should be fairly simple. Hope this helps.

Hi,

I was trying to compile with SpatiaLite support enabled, however, I am
running into an error:

I am compiling on Ubuntu 8.10, 64bit.

Is this a known issue? What can I do?

Thanks for any hints,

Hi William,
the problem you notice for #include <stdio.h>
arises because you are using the SpatiaLite 2.2
headers.

If you'll use the v.2.3 headers this will suddenly
disappear, because now 'gaiageo.h' includes <stdio.h>
by itself.

Please see:
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.3/

v.2.3 is still "unofficial" mainly because I've yet
to update the docs, but the code itself is really
mature and soundly solid.

bye, Sandro

Hi Andreas,
your problem is exactly the same noticed
by William Kyngesburye [using v.2.2 headers]

very quick fix: in 'qgsspatialiteprovider.h' add:
#include <stdio.h>
immediately before:
#include <spatialite/gaiageo.h>

even better: use the latest SpatiaLite v.2.3
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.3/

Ah, thanks for the info.  I held back on 2.3 because it was marked  
'devel'.

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly  
what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly  
disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely  
inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has  
already happened.

With 2.3 it compiles fine - thanks!

I still haven't tested it but with geodata, but will do tomorrow.

Are there any tools available to transfer Postgis to SpatiaLite tables? My
idea is to use Postgis as the main repository, but use SpatiaLite to
checkout data (e.g. for laptops).

It would be cool if QGIS would provide a tool to copy Postgis tables to
SpatiaLite and vice versa without having to go through a shapefile (with
its limitations, e.g. in column-name lengths)

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

I was already planning to do something like the one you are suggesting;
may be in the next few weeks ...

Does spatial lite provide all the same features of sqlite3 with spatial
extensions added? Is there an amalgamated (all sources in a single file)
version of spatial lite as there is for sqlite? If there is can I
suggest that we replace the amalgamated sqlite3 sources I put into QGIS
sources some time ago with the spatialite amalgamated sources and change
cmake to always use the internal copy of spatiallite?

Regards

QGIS doesnt (that I know of) work with tile indexes but you can create a
gdal .vrt virtual dataset from a bunch of files (using gdalbuildvrt.py).
You can also build pyramids on the virtual dataset and I have found
performance to be reasonable once zoomed in a little on a ~1TB test dataset.

this would be cool.

I have hopes that SpatiaLite will be a shapefile replacer, if it will be 
supported by more GIS projects/products. Other people want to see ESRI's 
file geodatabase as a replacement, but the Filegeodatabase is more 
complex to handle and corrupted with vendor-specific data.

So a good support for SpatiaLite has some potential to replace the 
ageing shapefile format ...

Yes that is correct. Our stable branch will undergo maintenance for at
least the next year with bug fix only releases producing 1.0.x versions.

The 1.x releases will be marked as unstable always and will not be
recommended for users wishing to emphasise stability consistency (e.g.
in enterprises where support needs to be offered).

The API of 1.x releases are expected to remain backwards compatible for
the foreseeable future but as we head towards version 2.0 we could
expect that API may undergo changes too.

I think it is safe to assume that in all cases we cannot guarantee ABI
compatibility since even a small bug fix that requires adding a new
class member or changing the static designation of a member variable
could break ABI compatibility.

Ok we can work to change this to use the 1.x.y versioning scheme - I
dont see any problem conceptually with that - others like Juergen could
probably offer better insight as to whether this presents us with any
technical issues.

Martin could probably comment better than I here but I would expect the
python libs to closely track the API of core an gui. That said bug fixes
could always break thinks. Having python libs link to an explicit
library could help to prevent issues like this:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1548 (other issues aside).

Thanks for the input - we will continue trying to get our project debian
compliant into the future.

Hi ????????,
  Some ideas you can find on QGIS Wiki page http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings (see "Geometry handling" section). Also earlier I posted some messages with Python code for adding features to the new vector layer (I tried to write a Python plugin for import geometries from special file).
  Sorry for my bad English.

So for the future I would expect something like

SONAME               libqgis_core.so.1.0.1

for all core libs. Note that, if people distributed svn-taken
pre-releases, at least at package level you should add 'Provides:
qgis-interface-1.0.1-N' to avoid breakages. All third-parties depending
packages should depend on that. I'm going to modify d-gis provided tree
in order to show that. The N level should be upgraded for each new
snapshot. This would allow for instance distributing a third parties
source and binary plugin depending on qgis-interface-1.0.1-0. I hope
this is clear enough.

You can rely on the (= ${binary:Version}) dependency for that in the
qgis package. What is needed is depending on qgis-interface-X.Y.Z
at release time for other packaged plugins (or -N in case
of snapshots). This is not currently the case, but it could be
possible in the future, that's the reason for the Provides: item.

YES: SpatiaLite simply extends the basic SQLite core, adding spatial features.
So, the basic and standard SQLite's capabilities are absolutely untouched and
fully preserved anyway.

Not yet: but this one really is a splendid suggestion. I love this idea.
I'll start exploring this ASAP, and I don't foresee any serious obstacle.

Splendid. This will definitively solve any build issue related to
SQLite/SpatiaLite. 
I find this solution is simple, effective and really smart.

Hi Gary,

here's what i'd like to do (just a brief summary):

- implement detection of collisions (supposedly by using PAL library)
- bend (rotate) labels when working with lines
- options whether to label every part of multi-part geometry
- tool for overriding default placement and settings of labels

any further ideas are welcome!

 A quick hack for people who want to do these things now (for polygons) is to:

 * load desired polygon layer. Turn labelling off.
 * Use fTools to create a point shapefile of centroids - you get one
point per feature
 * Load the point shapefile and set labelling on for it
 * Enable editing and use the edit tools to move the point to adjust
the label position
 * set the point layer appearance to 'no pen' and 'no brush' so the
points don't show, only the labels.
 * put the point and polygon layer in a group so it is easily turn off
and onable.
 * profit?!

I'm following the instructions for QGIS PPA here:
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/ppa

I'm excited to see that PPA is now using signing keys.  This means
adding the key to the keyring.  The instructions page above include a

(https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Adding%20a%20PPA%20to%20your%20Ubuntu%20repositories)
- with instructions that point to a screencast... too many links for
me! Besides, it's *really* simple...

The R install page has the following instructions for adding their key
to the keyring.  By changing the key ID, they work perfectly.  Maybe
this could be added to the instructions page?  If people want to know
more, they can follow the link to the detailed instructions, but i
think most people don't need this much info...

hope this helps,

Message-ID: <e12429640903271709n711bab89oe8fda3b16eef3eb6@mail.gmail.com>

I'm on the way to finish my build of qgis_unstable with osgeo4w, but
I'm blocked because of python bindings. Even if I set all the
requestes tags in cmakesetup (ie
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=C:/OSGeo4W/bin/python.exe), cmake says it
cannot build it. I premit that I've downloaded all the required deps
with osgeo4w setup.

Cmake can find Python if enable my registry keys about my system
Python25. I had disabled them because cmake detected them, and put the
paths (like C:\Python25) in the related makefiles. The consequence
were errors, because it tried to build the undetected core.pyd,
gui.pyd, in that path...

So the question is: why cmake shouldn't/couldn't use the paths I set
with cmakesetup?

Hi Giovanny:

Check that all paths are written with forward slashes instead of backward slashes.

C:/Python25

instead of

C:\Python25

> Hi all.
> I have been pointed out to an apparently serious problem in QGIS trying to

Further info: Luca Morandini is helping us, setting a couple of test server:

The WMS server is at: http://www.lucamorandini.it/geoserver/wms , while
the WFS one is at:http://www.lucamorandini.it/geoserver/wfs

As I see it. there are two issues when Quantum GIS and Geoserver interact:
1) QGIS does not retrieve all available styles when listing WMS layers
to be added, only the first one ("burg", in this case) is shown; if that
style is not applicable to the chosen WMS layer, the layer won't show.

2) QGIS does not prefix WFS requests with the proper namespace, for
instance it asks for:
GET
/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=DescribeFeatureType&TYPENAME=region

while TYPENAME should be psc:region instead.

One other thing to check is that you have run the osgeo shell
environment bat script before running cmakesetup.

I've added the following items to my wishlist
(http://sites.google.com/site/eospansite/myqgiswishlist)
I wait for feed-back before adding them as tickets:

  24. When opening a layer, add it to the position below the layer
      selected in the legend (not always to the top)
  25. When creating a group in the legend, add it to the position below
      the selected layer (not always to the bottom)
  26. RGB color composite from individual files.
  27. RGB color composite from layers within a group in the legend
  28. Color (or grey) key for vector and single-band raster layers
  29. Attribute table and tips for single-band raster layers (i.e., for
      land-cover raster layers)

Agus and all, I want to add one more wish:

* Ability to clone/duplicate an already opened layer by right click on a
layer. This is, in my humble opinion, more convenient to make quick
changes on the appearance (i.e. of a vector) and have different "looks"
of the same map than adding a layer again and re-applying whatever
symbology properties the user wants to.

Kind regards, Nikos
---

P.S. @Agus: since you have all these wishes in one place, you could add
the above as well, given of course that you see it as a required
feature.

-1 - when I add a layer I want to be able to see it, and if it's not
at the top I might not!

> ?25. When creating a group in the legend, add it to the position below
> ? ? the selected layer (not always to the bottom)

-1 - but unlike the current behaviour I'd like new groups to start at
the top (so that things added to them are visible!)

 Another idea would be to have an 'add layer here' option on the
context menu of the layer legend. Currently adding a new layer to a
group is a two-step thing - load the layer, then drag into the group.
This could be done in one with a 'add layer here' option. Obviously it
would then have to ask if you want a raster layer, vector layer,
postgis layer, wms layer etc etc...

> ?26. RGB color composite from individual files.

 Not sure I understand these two - you want to take three individual
rasters and create an RGB image raster from them?

> ?28. Color (or grey) key for vector and single-band raster layers

 On the Print Composer? Or in the layer legend?

 Are you talking about categorical rasters here? Where 1=water,
2=agriculture, 3=urban for example? What file formats support
alphanumeric labels for categories? Or would the user have to enter
them in Qgis themselves?

When this is happening in ArcGIS, polygonal layers are being added to the
bottom of the list, then lines, then points at the top. This is smart,
especially when you load 10+ layers at once. Last layer is then
selected, so you won't miss where it is now.

Don't understand your -1, at most should be a 0: these features would 
not prevent you or anybody else
to get the new layer opened at the top (just have the first layer 
selected ),
or the group created at the bottom (just have the last layer selected), 
which is the
current behavior. Instead you would let other users organize their set 
of layers (which often is long)
in a different way. Don't see any reason to impose any particular 
preference.

 From a user point of view, this would be very similar to what I'm 
suggesting, just
more complicated to develop. My suggestion is simpler: the layer goes to 
wherever
you have selected in the list of layers  (that we wrongly call legend)

Most satellite imagery comes with bands in independent files. Having the 
ability of
displaying them as color composites would be handy. I know this can be 
done through
a vrt file, but you have to go through the step of gdal_merge.py
May be 27 could obviate 26 (27 is very similar to the grass imagery group)

In both. Having a pseudocolor  layer displayed with no key for the 
colors is of very limited utility.

Don't know about formats, probably this should be a qgis feature. But 
displaying
a landcover map and seeing the actual alfanumeric categories as tips and 
in the
color key (ref. 28) would be most useful. Seeing "water" displayed as 
tip is much
more useful than seeing "1".

But if you have the first layer selected, the new layer will not be placed on top, but one layer down.

I'm with Barry, new layers should be placed on top.

If you mean on top of the currently selected layer, yes I agree, that's 
better.
What I do not like is having the new layer going to the top of the "legend"
as the only option.

Message-ID: <e12429640903300035j69f859f4l66da7fd5678c08cd@mail.gmail.com>

Just to know, is there ongoing work for raster analysis/filtering
features? I'm just trying to dig into C++ and QGis code to be able to
give a (litlle) hand with it. I know that Peter is particularly
involved with this. Can you update us with tha actual status?

Thanks,

Mauricio,

I've tested it and works fine, at least with tif files.

Few comments:

1. Add the ability to select the destination folder
2. Add a button to select/unselect display
3. Actually, better than the above, a similar plugin that would
just create the vrt file would be very useful. As the vrt file
might have many files (multispectral, hyperspectral, multi-temporal...), 
this plugin could just read the list of files from a text file.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!

Ok, I've solved this problem. I had to fix python manglings, between
my own installs and osgeo4w.

Now I can build almost everything but:

1 -  It misses the important part for me: grass! I've recompiled grass
from trunk and created the .lib files with dumplib, etc. Now they're
located under OSGeo4W/apps/grass/grass-6.5.svn/lib, but thet're named
with 'lib' prefix (i.e. libgrass_arraystats.dll), while the libs
provided with OSGeo4W don't have it (grass_arraystats.dll). Why? Is
this causing grass not to be compiled? The strange is that cmake
doesn't raise errors, but grass folder isn't there (under plugins dir)
as expected...

2 - nmake install exits with error because it can't locate
win_build/vcdeps files. I see thy're set in cmale_install.cmake...
What is that folder?! Where CMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT should have been
set?

Thanks for you great help!

Because I used to compile the GRASS with Visual C++ - before I fixed
some malloc()/free() problems that cause the original mingw build libs
to crash, when called from VC code.

The grass-vc package containing the "misnamed" libraries is not needed
anymore.  There's only the package grass-devel-vc left, that has the lib
files for VC.  But those reference the mingw built DLLs.  In your case
also unnecessary as you roll your own GRASS build.

That folder is meant to carry all external dependencies that need to be
installed with QGIS (like Qt, GDAL, PROJ, GRASS and so on).  If you have
everything in place there, you can build an NSIS installer using the
PACKAGE target out of the box (although the vcredist package still needs
to be installed).   If you don't you can just create an empty folder or
remove the reference to vcdeps from the CMakeLists.txt.

Thanks Jurgen. But FindGRASS.cmake has this:

FIND_LIBRARY(LIB_PATH grass_${LIB} PATHS ${G_PREFIX}/lib)

so it looks for not-with-lib-prefix libs. Right? I can change it
manually, but shouldn't it be changedas default too?

Do you mean that I should place all the needed manually to run PACKAGE
target (and build the NSIS)?

How did you name your grass libraries?   If the are called grass_foo.lib
cmake should be fine - if libgrass_foo.lib probably not.

I usually specify them manually (or edit CMakeCache.txt from a previous
build).

No.  If you want to build a NSIS installer, that's probably the easiest
way.  Otherwise you just create an empty folder or remove the reference
to vcdeps at all.

I left the grass build name them, and they result as libgrass_* . So I
will change the cmake, but the FindGRASS one, as CMakeCache.txt
doesn't contain such a variable (I only have grass_prefix and
grass_include_dir)

Yes, I meant to build an NSIS installer. At the moment I just want to
finish compiling simply as RELEASE. Then I will go for PACKAGE.

Anyway I have to solve another problem before: the sed script

/Dump of file / {
s/Dump of file \([^ ]*\)$/LIBRARY \1/p
a\
EXPORTS
}
/[ ]*ordinal hint/,/^[ ]*Summary/ {
/^[ ]\+[0-9]\+/ {
s/^[ ]\+[0-9]\+[ ]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ ]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ ]\+\([^ =]\+\).*$/ \1/p
}
}

doesn't work fine for me. I receive the error:

> sed: file makedef.sed line 2: Unknown option to 's'

So the def file i created wrongly...

Please don't.  CMake follows convensions.  It knows that libraries are
called name.lib for MSVC and libname.a for Unix (and MinGW).   If you
change FindGRASS you break it for other platforms.

Rename you libraries instead.

> Anyway I have to solve another problem before: the sed script

My incarnation of that script is on http://buten.norbit.de/~jef/mklibs.
That also takes care of the lib renaming and removes the version tag
from the libraries.

It seems to do the same as mine.
I've made it work... it was an error of extra characters inserted by
notepad. I had to remove them with an hex editor!

Now I receive a linking error, that says the grass_vect.lib is broken
as FATA ERROR 1127... What could cause this?

Hi,

I'm trying to make a portable osgeo4w qgis on a CD.

I've found two problems:

 - On one system that doesn't have the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
redistrutables, qgis doesn't start.

 - If I put ECW dlls in the OSGEO4W bin dir, QGIS doesn't load them.


How can I fix these problems?

Thanks for the ideas, Agustin, but I didn't understand topic 2. Could
you explain more? I've actually liked the VRT plugin idea. I'm going to
learn a little about gdal's VRT and see what I can do with it. As far as
I know, VRT is kind of tricky for me... Too many different sintaxes for
different things. But I'm going to try to sort it out.
Glad to see it worked. Are you a ubuntu user? If not, in what system did
you test?

Luca,

Yes, I'm afraid this is an inevitable result of our trying to do things
the "microsoft natural way".  You will either need to require the
redistributables to already be installed, or add a mechanism to try and
install them when first using the portable qgis.

>  - If I put ECW dlls in the OSGEO4W bin dir, QGIS doesn't load them.

I'm surprised.  How does this manifest?  A complaint from the OS
when qgis.exe is run that one of the dlls is not found?

Hi:

 

In the list in http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas is an idea to add

a data provider plugin for GeoRSS feeds. Looking at the gdal/ogr site I have found that

gdal 1.7 will have a driver for GeoRSS, in this case with just an update to ogr provider

and building the gdal used by qgis with GeoRSS support will do the job. Needs this idea

stay in the list?.

Ok, solved with your script. I had to fix something for my machine,
but the only difference seems to be the egre part...
Anyway the grassplugin gets compiled.
Now, the installed qgis.exe raises another error. Cannot find an entry
procedure in QtCore4.dll:

Solved this too :) it was looking into my system env var, not in the
osgeo4w one...
Everything is there, except grass! The grassplugin.dll is in the
plugins folder, but it doesn't appear in qgis!!!!!

Are you aware of the WKTRaster project [1] ?
It aims at in-db raster analisys (postgis-based).

Finally I've compiled my QGis from trunk, with self compiled grass
from trunk too, on Windows Vista.
qgis.exe seems to run fine, and I can load GRASS tools, the GRASS
shell (I've tried the famous g.proj -w and it runs perfectly). But
whenever I try to load a grass layer in QGis, this crashes with the
following warnings:

+ One more idea (noted by Dimitris Zachariadis):
A free-form selection tool (aka laso). It would be very useful to be
able to select nodes of interest, or lines for example which cannot be
selected with the rectangular selection tool.

I think something like the "split" tool but instead of splitting, it
should select whatever the user wants. The the user can delete, update
perhaps _at once_ an attribute (a column) and more.

Kind regards, Nikos

 This exists in my 'selectplus' plugin, along with selecting by circle
and polygon and inverting the selection.

 Note that it will probably fail on projected geometries since it only
works on the layers coordinate system and not the projected screen
coords. Or something like that. You'll find it here:

 If the problems with coordinates can be fixed it's definitely
something I'd like to see supported by the core group though!

I'm testing it, and it works great (apart for a minor bug I think will
be fixed soon), also for editing etc.
Thanks Sandro.

Very nice! Thank you Barry. There is something strange though: the
Select by radius appears twice on the menu.

 yes - and you'll notice that if you are using either of the circle
selectors and click once then you'll crash qgis! I've fixed this in
SVN and reported a bug in qgis, so an update to come soon will fix
this.

 I'm not sure why there are two - I think I was experimenting with
either click-drag to define the circle or click-click. Its also
possible I wanted to do one tool that selected by radius and another
that selected by diameter. I'll probably sort this out soonish too.

Also, Carson has sorted out the projection issues. If you want to try
the bugfixed projection-savvy version, get the code from:

http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/#svn/trunk/selectplus

I'll update my plugin repository with a new version later this week.

Yes. It crashes :-). Evolution (mail client) started crashing as
well... :-(    ...I am kidding.

Anybody can reproduce this? Tim, Jurgen?
Could it be the same memory management problem in grass?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Starting the tests with VRT plugin
Message-ID: <1238528676.3653.9.camel@vatto01>

Hi devs,
I'm starting my work on the VRT plugin. It could possibly be and answer
to those "raster on-the-fly projection questions". 
I'm designing the gui but I don't have much experience with VRT, so I'm
sending some screenshots so people can tell me if I missed any good
feature in it. I know I skipped some stuff from the wkt as I think it's
out of the use (raw rasters, for example). If someone use it and would
like to see it in the plugin, please tell me.
