Hi Alessandro, Hi Stéphane, 

I have created the issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13919 

I can't assign Stéphane - I don't find him on the list of devs at
hub.qgis.org 

But crashes are random and I don't know how to create a backtrace from
QGIS server, esp. if the crash is random. 

Performance regression can be reproduced with any larger QGIS server
project with layers from Postgis. Again - this is not so easy to share
... 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS SVGs won't work in OpenLayers3
Message-ID: <1448969571442-5239335.post@n6.nabble.com>

qgis2web supports SVG markers in OL3 output (though not in Leaflet output).
However, when using SVGs from QGIS (eg
C:/OSGEO4~1/apps/qgis/./svg/wind_roses/WindRose_01.svg), the SVG does not
render, and I've not been able to find any console error. Using eg
www.williambuck.com/portals/0/Skins/WilliamBuck2014/images/location-icon.svg
works. I've looked at the src of both SVGs, and tried to alter the QGIS one
(largely simplifying it) to see if I can get it to work, but with no joy. I
don't know much about SVG to figure out what causes one to work and the
other to fail. Does anyone have any ideas? Yes, I'll also ask OL3 users, but
thought it was appropriate to ask here as well.

Hi,
Given that there is already a long queue to deal with in Doc repo (with two
releases without documentation), it would be nice if the next QGIS release
number is automatically tagged on the issue. It'll prevent writers to add
documentation about 2.14 features while writing 2.12.

Hi,

I would like to know if it's possible to change field displayed when identify map tool return more than one object.
By default it seem to display first column, which is always pk in my case (postgis layer)
For end user pk doesn't mean anything


Thanks

Hi,

New PR update with addition of missing SIP bindings and use of ST_Simplify
with third parameter "True" to decrease the size of data to download by
QGIS.
Please help to test with various data and report.

Some quick results, with the same data and query as mentioned in the PR, to
show how the number of vertexes decreases. It would lead to best
performance also because the data will be downloaded from the PostGIS faster
query number of vertexes "geom" 3 763 284 st_snaptogrid( "geom", 407.618 )
1 220 892 st_removerepeatedpoints( "geom", 407.618 ) 689 300 st_simplify(
st_removerepeatedpoints( "geom", 407.618 ), 356.665, true ) 303 292

Of course, this is done when viewing the whole layer (zoom to layer
extent). For big scales, this PR will not improve so drastically the
situation compared to the previous use if ST_SnapToGrid

Should we not accept the PR so that many more users can try it with master
branch ?

Cheers
Michaël

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QField on android 5+
Message-ID: <565DBDEA.7060301@opengis.ch>

Hi all,
I just updated the QField version of QField in the playstore to version
0.4.1 - Dhaulagiri.

The major improvement is that we now support android 5.

As of today 4.0.3 (Ice cream sandwich API 15) is the required minimal
Android version to run QField and Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean API 18) is the
suggested minimal version.

Eventually we want to settle to 4.3 (JB) as minimum to allow us using
certain features and avoiding one known issue, but for now it would mean
cutting of another 25% of the users.


WHAT'S NEW
* Android 5+ support
* Reintroduced WMS support
* Removed ministro dependency. All libs are now bundled
* drastically reduced total download size from 300MB+ to 36MB
* updated libs to QGIS 2.13 (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/6b3eddd)

Help us by sponsoring the project or just by spreading the word so we
can keeping developing all we planed (digitizing is the next big feature)

Update: the QGIS SVGs work in Leaflet. Will have to investigate further. Any

Maybe it's the use of "params" in the QGIS SVGs - see
http://blog.sourcepole.ch/2011/06/30/svg-symbols-in-qgis-with-modifiable-colors/

That's the only thing that jumps to mind for me.

Message-ID: <CAFO80_rz9MWJF93tttDGDJaydx=AsBZc1v9-tKhgAHgErausjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi qgis devs

I just published the QTraffic plugin... It's a plugin developed for
the Coimbra university (Portugal) that I finished some months ago.

I had ethical problem publishing it, because it contain a windows
executable (the algorithm developed by the University team) that I'not
able to verify directly.
I worked to convince to publish the code since the beginning of the
project, but because it's a research project they are still in
experimental phase testing and calibrating it. So they don't want to
have a "official" release of the code before to have it deeply tested.
Deep testing depends of accessibility of the plugin, so I published it.
During Gran Canaria hackfest I asked to some core developer if it was
correct to publish it, and all give me the ok.
I'm still not sure of this decision, and at least I want to be
transparent about this.

I'm sincerely confident that the executable code (Fortran code) will
be sooner or later published, what I don't know is when and in what
form and with what license... but I'm confident that it will be a open
license.

please ask more info or do pressure to the official code

Hi Luigi,
thanks for explaining. I think this violates our policy:
http://plugins.qgis.org/
"does not contain architecture-dependant binaries"
and the plugin should be removed.
All the best.

Hi,

testing the plugin builder i found it offers three option for the
creation of a new plugin but i cannot find any information
about the "Processing provider"

what is it supposed to do and how can i activate a processing provider
plugin?

any help or link to docs or book that covers this topic?

thanks, Roy.

Hey,
A small complement, as I'm not able to add to the ticket.

Issue still present with 2.12.
It seems the whole proxy stuff is ot taken into account before a restart.

We would really need a small button in the proxy tab to test the connection
(for instance trying to reach qgis web site),
similarly to what exists when adding a postgres connection.

Cheers,
Rémi C

You can add your own plugin into the processing framework. It will add a
new entry in the "Advanced interface" of Processing.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any documentation, but you can have a look
to this example :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/exampleprovider
- ProcessingExampleProviderPlugin will add the plugin to Processing
- ExampleAlgorithmProvider will list every algorithms available in the
plugin
- ExampleAlgorithm is an algorithm

Some plugins provides their own algorithms in Processing (QuickOSM ...)

Very useful thanks !
 in the meantime i managed to activate a "blank" provider plugin
after restarting QGIS and activating the new provider in the processing options menu
it does not show up in the simplified interface indeed, maybe because i did not use an already
existing processing menu (raster, vector etc...)

Yes, I stripped those out as part of the simplification I mentioned above.
I'll try again and see if I have any more joy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do I specify multiple plugin authors?
Message-ID: <1449047033040-5239517.post@n6.nabble.com>

Plugins have a single field for author and author email. What is the correct
way to specify multiple authors? Comma separated in both fields (name and
email)? Since a mailto: link is generated on the plugin page in the repo, I
don't think that would work. Something else?

By the way, on
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html,
under "Plugin metadata" > "email", it says "will not be shown on the web
site". Is that still true? Is the email address on the site taken only from
the details filled in via the web form, and not from the metadata?

Yes, that field is visible only when logged in.

You can enter multiple author names in the string field "author", "email"
field can contain only one email.

The metadata.txt will be read when loading a new version and will overwrite
any value entered in the form.

Hope this helps.

Thanks - all sorted. However, I do think the text that emails will not be
displayed on the website is not correct if they will be when a user is
logged in.

You are right, feel free to make a PR on the doc page.

But keep in mind that there are many other differences in what a logged in
user can see/do in the plugin website, the information in the doc is about
the vast majority of users that access the plugin information by reading
the XML delivered from the plugin website through QGIS plugin manager.

The sentence could be: "Your email address will be visible only by other
plugin authors and plugin website administrators and will not be shown in
the QGIS plugin manager or in the website unless the user is a registered
user and is logged in"

For my part I have concerns both from licensing and from exposing our users to potential harm point of view.

* In the first case (which is probably not as well defined) I don’t think it is good to ship code from the official repo where the licensing is indeterminate, and which potentially conflicts with QGIS licensing itself.
* In the second case, shipping a binary from the official repo gives us no opportunity to inspect the code to ensure that it is not doing something potentially harmful to the users computer.

My suggestion would be to publish it under a third party repo and encourage users to test it from there.

Regards

Tim

Maybe another option is to publish the plugin without the binaries, and
leave the user the task of installing and configuring that separately. So
all the code of the plugin itself is available, but then it relies on a 3rd
party application that is not open, but that we are not shipping.

my 2 cents

I think we already have this kind of discussion once.
Victor's proposition arise and the point was that it only makes sense if 
the plugin doest not fully rely on the external binaries. If it's 
totally depending on it, then I believe the 3rd party repo is the most 
appropriate way.

my 2 cents too

Subject: [Qgis-developer] selective features unselection
Message-ID: <20151202102053.GA26754@localhost>

I had not found a way to selectively remove features from
the selection set via the GUI, does any such functionality exist ?

The "unselect features" tool drastically unselect _all_ features.

Ideally I'd like to be able to perform set-oriented operations
on the selection, adding or removing elements with the same selection
power (by rectangle, polygon, freehand or programmatically).

Is this available already or planned for any future release ?

I tried something and.. found ! 
Keeping CTRL pressed toggles inclusion of selected
features in the "selected" set.

Then I guess it's just an UX issue that needs be fixed.
How should UX feature requests be reported ?

Hi Strk,

It is indeed a bit problematic, esp. since other applications (Inkscape, 
LibreOffice) use the Shift key to do the same thing. It would be great 
if QGIS could align with that behavior that people already know from 
other software.

But maybe there is a technical reason to use the Ctrl-Key instead of the 
Shift-Key.

Andreas

Gimp uses Shift and Ctrl for different things.
IIRC Shift _adds_ while Ctrl _removes_ from selection.
Not sure the Gimp has a _toggle_ too..

Anyway, one issue I see is lack of visual feedback for
what a modifier key does, you can only try to figure out.
In Gimp the visual feedback is a minus sign for _remove_ (-)
and a plus sign for _add_ (+). I'm not sure how a _toggle_
sign would look like.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Status on Windows 64 bit versus 32 bit?
Message-ID: <1449052098023-5239542.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have been using Qgis 64 bit in Win7 for a long time (installed using
OsGeo4W) with no problems.

No I have experienced this (using Qgis 1.12.1):

* Opening a certain project in Qgis 64 bit version takes 1 minut
* Opening the same project on the same PC in Qgis 32 bit version takes only
14 seconds

So now I think: Shold I quit the 64 bit version?

The actual quite "heavy" project loads some Esri Geodatabases (.gdb) - can
there be special issues with that?


I am working on a Lenovo 64bit PC with a 7 core CPU and 16GB ram.

The print composer is aligned with GIMP functionality. And that's also
the one I am used to and normally expect from applications.

+1 for visual feedback.
Do we even need a toggle? I think that's just messy to handle anyway.

I now downloaded the 64 bit standalone installer and installed this 64 bit
version too.

It is just as quick as the above described 32 bit version (whích is also the
standalone version)

So it is apparently NOT a 32/64 bit question but a standalone/OsGeo4W
question?

Good question, I guess one might want to use it to invert selection.
Not sure it has to be selective rather than global.

I think "~" could be a good visual indication for "toggle":

 =  : Set the selection to whatever I select now
 +  : Add what I select now to selection
 -  : Remove what I select from selection
 ~  : Toggle inclusion in selection of what I select

Currently only "=" (no modifiers) and "~" (CTRL modifier) are implemented
as far as I can tell.

I agree all the comments done

Our first way to distribute the plugin was a custom repo

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QTrafficmodel/QTrafficPluginRepository/master/emsure.xml

and publishing in the official repo was a way to reach more users (not
used to configure custom repos)

other solution would be to download the .exe after local installation
(but need more but simple code... and wasn't planned because was
planned to have code and license available)

btw... I'll remove and I hope publishing it temporarily was a good way
to raise the problem.

thank you for your patient

cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyqgis load a memorylayer in plugin but not show
 it in layerlist/legend
Message-ID: <565EDFF1.7050609@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Is there a way to create a memory layer in a plugin, and load it in the
map (and put temporary features in it), but NOT show it in the
legend/layerlist?

Context: we generate sort of big pie-charts in a plugin, which are shown
to user (and user is able to change color), but after closing of the
plugin the layer is emptied (or published to a shp or server).
It seems not very usefull to let the user for exampel make the layer go
down or make invisible or so.

So: possible? If yes: how?

Regards & Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

The API seems to make that not too hard ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] <layer_coordinate_transform_info> not cleaned when
	layer is removed
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GsJk6B+cpsxEZA0dpd4t7mYrPsy-dS80QF3=NehmvzBg@mail.gmail.com>

I have discovered that QGIS saves the transformation information of the
opened layers in the project file.

So far so good.

But, when the layers are removed, that information remains in the qgs file.
Worst, if the a same layer is loaded again, another line with
transformation information is created.

Therefore, for very "dynamic" projects, the qgs file starts growing in
the <layer_coordinate_transform_info> tag.

Currently, the test qgs file in attachment only have one layer, yet it has
a bunch of lines in <layer_coordinate_transform_info>. Please notice that
only 3 different layers where added to the file.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <CAECJsSqxu8p+g7RP2h2=hqLu+oHXiqGNhGXa-cx3p58di1v6uQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm on QGIS 2.12 and right-clicking on the main canvas toolbars, there's an
"User Imput Panel" listed among panels that I'm unable to see what it does.
Clicking on it just open a dialog that vanishes right after. Notice that
this panel is not available via View menu -> Panel.
Is this a local issue (I'm on Windows7 64bits) or is it an artefact of an
unfinished implementation?
Should I open a ticket?

OK, good point. Setting as deprecated for now.
Perhaps we would need a tool to automatically spot executables in the
plugins, before allowing their publication.
All the best.

This is a panel used for user input and shown only when needed.
It is used for instance for the rotation map tool to enter the rotation 
angle.

Just did that instead of disabling the test.
Hope I got it right...

Looking at the code, SHIFT is also handled, but does none
of the above. Rather, it changes the way the user-draw
rubberband select features, either by full containment (with SHIFT)
or simple intersection (no SHIFT).

Is there a statusbar where such documentation could be printed ?

There is a statusbar but I would prefer to follow up on Andreas'
proposal and standardize the behavior.

One thing does not exclude the other.
I'd give priority to user feedback / documentation rather than behavioural
change, especially as the latter breaks compatibility and thus might
be better handled by making it an explicit choice to determine which
modifier does what.

There seem to be a dependency on QtSql package which I can

True, but communicating a non-widespread usage to the users will make it
harder to change the defaults.

I just realised that this won't help at all. See for example
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/94452707

The test hung again, but since Travis kills the build before the test
results are uploaded to dash we have no way of seeing the log for this test
anyway....

Nah, that was a bad star constellation here.
Often the test times out but travis doesn't (see my link in my original

Hi all,

Doing some out of the box experience UI clean up e.g what is the first
thing you get when you run from clean config.

Anyone stressed if I kill this button?

[image: Inline image 1]

I have never used it and the function seems pretty limited.

Not me. I can only find 1 or 2 controls which it actually applies to!
Better to remove it then have such an incomplete "feature".

Yep - kill it. It's only used a handful of times outside of the "evis"
plugin and "delimited text source" dialog, and there's not even any
way to display the what's this text for the delimited source dialog.

Sorry for the encripted message,

I do use this at least in plugins, and I think others do similar things.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving to Trusty for Travis tests
Message-ID: <1449140717493-5239822.post@n6.nabble.com>

Apologies if this is too off-topic, but with Travis releasing their new
Google Compute Engine infrastructure, I've done some work on my Travis
setup, including moving from Ubuntu Precise to Trusty. Briefly, the issues I
encountered under Trusty as opposed to Precise were:

- xvfb now has to be installed as it is no longer part of the environment

- most pip installs now have to be run with sudo, or you get permission
denied (don't know why this has changed)

- in my .travis.yml, I had to move from "language: python" to "language:
generic", as it seemed that there was confusion between system Python and
QGIS Python (resulting in fatal numpy Unicode errors)

- unit tests which open a webpage now pause Travis, indefinitely as far as I
can tell (the Travis output says "≪ ↑ ↓ Viewing <index.html>"). I don't know
how to get round this, so I've had to avoid any tests which open a webpage.
Any help in this gratefully received.

- nose-faulthandler fails to install ("faulthandler.c:7:20: fatal error:
Python.h: No such file or directory"). No idea why, again, any suggestions
welcome

The increased reliance on sudo is a shame, as this make transition to their
container-based infrastructure less possible.

I should also have mentioned that Travis are also migrating "Precise with
sudo" jobs over to Google Compute Engine (GCE) this week. This should lower
test times, but watch out for any resulting differences in behaviour. If you
want to stick with Precise, but force your tests onto GCE immediately, you
can do so in .travis.yml:

sudo: required 
dist: precise 
group: edge

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] error updating "Processing"
Message-ID: <1449142722408-5239827.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I have posted this on User list, but maybe is better to ask here...

i have some installation of qgis on my windows 8.
I installed via osgeo4w:
2.8.4-2 (LTR dev)
2.12.1-1 (Lyon)
2.13.0-21 (dev)

but there is a problem with the update processing.
In fact, if I upgrade it to 2.12.2 from 2.10.99, a directory called
"processing" is created in C:\ Users\ ... \. qgis2\python\ plugins folder
and this error comes out:

Couldn't load plugin 'processing'

ImportError: cannot import name spatialite_utils

Python version: 2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit
(Intel)]
QGIS version: 2.12.1-Lyon Lyon, 16760fd


As consequence of this installation in the property of plugin window i read:

Processing

Spatial data processing framework for QGIS

Spatial data processing framework for QGIS

77 rating vote(s), 196142 downloads

Category: Analysis
More info: homepage   tracker   code_repository

Author: Victor Olaya

Installed version: 2.12.2 (in
C:\Users\11186cs\.qgis2\python\plugins\processing)
Available version: 2.12.2 (in Repository plugin ufficiale QGIS)


Now, it no longer works neither processing nor any plugins associated
(processing_workflow, and so on).

The only solution is to delete the directory called "processing", but that
processing is outdated.

is this a bug?

thanks a lot 

stefano

Message-ID: <CAJy=Xte0vm+2fMSsZ0Z6fs=QLqhaBUYe=bMwhJ09a2i1yH6Tpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I noticed that QgsExpression class can't evaluate layers that are not
loaded in QgsMapLayerRegistry.
This is a bit annoying because expressions could be evaluated against a
temporary datasource or external data without necessary show it to the
user. (an alternative question could be: Is it possible to hide a legend
item?)
Should I submit a feature request for this?

Hi Stefano

as stated in a message in italian qgis community, the problem is that
you hare three qgis version using the same .qgis2/ where conf and user
plugin are installed

so you have a unique Processing but different version available
compatible with the three qgis version

you should start every qgis pointing to a different QGIS cofiguration
with --configpath option in every QGIS.bat used by different version.

when you do, please self answer to your message in qgis-user list to
notify the solution

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

Hi Nathan,

you can have a look to a the new version of changeDataSource plugin I was
releasing: https://github.com/enricofer/changeDataSource
Once installed, clicking on toolbutton [image: Immagine incorporata 3] is
possible to change the datasources of loaded layers
Expressions are used to massively replace datasources strings using a dummy
memory layer build up on the fly (called layerTable) that contains loaded
layers parameters.
This layer appears in legend when dialog is shown to allow expression
performing, because if layerTable layer is not charged in Registry its
fields are not listed in Expression Dialog under "Fields and Values"

[image: Immagine incorporata 4]

Expression is evaluated at row 541 in changeDataSource.py

Thanks.

Hi Tom,

Testing here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2532

Recently build times are horrible and we get a lot of false alarms due
to build timeouts. If this makes it any better we should switch.

Looking forward to trusty but had no success so far unfortunately.

If you have any further hints concerning this, please keep them coming!!

Sorry,
after a looooong time,
I destructed and recreated the plugin.
It is currently awaiting check, it has not changed since the last time,
expect the folder name is now the same as the plugin name.

Hi,

I'm thinking of writing my own processing provider.

Is the interface for processing providers considered stable - i.e. future releases of QGIS are unlikely to break existing providers?

Many thanks

Crispin

Apologies - my instructions for forcing GCE were correct only for
Precise-only Travis configs. The QGIS config is both Linux and OSX. See this
page for instructions to force GCE for multiple os: configs:

https://gist.github.com/meatballhat/d0c8aab9e3bd8a8bcacd#file-00-intro-md

I'm not familiar with the matrix: syntax they are using, so I don't feel I
can construct a PR for this. Hope it might help, though.

That said, the build you link to did run on GCE, so perhaps all is well with
the config, and we just aren't getting the performance boost one might have
hoped for from GCE.

Hi Tom,

I merged the pull request linked in the last mail since there were no
errors and no timeout.
I hope that this solves our issues.

The matrix notation should only be required if there are different
requirements for different platforms.
However, what I just DID realize while reading your link is that with a
build matrix we could use a different platform for Qt5 tests. Levaing
Qt4 tests on precise and run Qt5 tests on travis. I may explore this
road if I find time.

Cheers,
Matthias

... is enabled automatically when compiling against Qt5 but none of the
python tests will currently pass because there's a lot of work missing.
But enabling Qt5 builds even without python tests would have the benefit
of notifying about commits that break Qt5 builds as simple as [1].

OK. And the OSX build was unaffected by the top-level selection of Precise?
Seems not, but I have no experience of reading OSX test output.

Hi Matthias,

as mentioned in your announcement as of Nov 10 (same subject) I was trying
to build the newest git pull.

After a long compilation it finally ended in
...
import PyQt4.uic.pyuic
ImportError: No module named PyQt4.uic.pyuic
...

Other than that, I installed all requirement
for Ubuntu 15.10 (which I have) as described
in your PR 2430.

I would prefer a Python3 / PyQt5 ONLY version.
Is this possible at all or is there no way to
also install PyQt4?


And/or what about QGIS 3.0, is it better to wait
for it (having a pure Python3/Qt5 environment there)
But I guess this is not happening soon.


Thank you
Karl

Hi Karl,

Are you aware that python 3 support by no means is production ready. Not
even a single core plugin is compatible. It's just the C++ interface
that is ready to be compiled on a python 3 system. So if you need
something python related at all in QGIS you will not want to work with
this at the moment.
If you do not need any python dependent functionality of QGIS you should
be ready to try it. Or even better, if you are able to write and debug
python code, it would be very nice if somebody would start to port the
python code in QGIS to be compatible with python2 and python3.

Enough disclaimer:

Thanks for your report, I think that relates to a very recent commit
7bab2e50.
Can you try to revert it and see if it compiles better?

Best regards,
Matthias

Hi all,
I wonder what is the criterion to mark a plugin as featured. There is
even one featured plugin which is now deprecated.
Perhaps we should have clear criteria for inclusion, and keep the list
updated?
All the best.

The original idea was to mark the most important plugins as "featured",
kind of staff's pick or "recommended".

Any admin (including you) can set/clear the "featured" flag.

There is no criterion, you can decide which plugins are "featured".

Thanks. I can go throught them and set/unset the flag - can we decide
some guidelines?

IMHO it's up to you, the voting system and the "popular" index is
democratic, the featured flag is for your personal taste and feeling :)

With new users in mind, I wonder if the plugins page is really the  
resource for picking a plugin, or if they just search through the plugin  
manager for things they might need, cause it does provide the exact same  
informations as the website (minus those tags).

More important for me would be the question, which plugins are installed  
and enabled by default. And I ask the question again (I never got an  
answer on that before): Why e.g. is the Table Manager not installed and  
available by default? As ESRI shape is the major output format, a novice  
starting to use QGIS has no tool to alter the attribute table, which is  
IMHO an unnecessary obstacle.
I bet there are not few people fumbling around in the dbf before realizing  
that there is a plugin available.

Just my two cents
Bernd

As a recent new user, (and now a custom plugin writer), I did not 
remember that there was a plugin page. I look for plugins in the plugin 
manager as that is what come to mind first before I start googling.

I also lurk here for valuable info.  :)

I was just going to go through my plugins and add the "What' this?" text.

I guess I'll find something better to do.  Glad I check here regularly!

I was actually also thinking about the "What's this" as a
possible way to mention what clicking on a button would have
done (might become complex).

What's the recommended way to embed documentation ?

Agree with you, Bernd, that features like the ones provided by "Table
Manager" plugin should be in QGIS by default. However, installing (and
enabling) by default other dev's plugins mean that QGIS dev team should
somehow be responsible of its stability; there are already Core plugins
(Processing, DBManager...) and I'm not sure they should have to do this
with other plugins.
+1 to have "Table Manager" features in Core but not really in favour of
activating plugins unless they integrate the Core plugins schema.

But why?

Most of the table manager functions are already in Core. It is perfectly 
possible to add and remove columns without the table manager.

If some of the table manager functions are still missing in core, it is 
better to bring the missing functionality into core, rather than 
enabling Table manager by default.

I am not a fan of having many Python plugins enabled by default, because 
they slow down the loading of QGIS. Also, Python plugins are a major 
source of additional bugs ...

Yep, MOST is in. But for example not moving order or renaming columns. How  
stupid is that, to rename a columns by creating a new one, copying the  
data and then deleting the old one, just to find it then in the end of all  
columns without the possibility to change that?
And to newbies it is NOT obvious by any means that they have to install  
the Table Manager to be able to do so.

Sure there must be good reasons why those functions didn't make it into  
core so far (maybe also the long existence of the Table Manager plugin?)

Sorry, didn't want to high jack this thread for my personal favourite ;)

Over and out
Bernd

Table Manager helps renaming, reordering fields (not yet available) and
while removing/deleting/reordering fields, you can preview how your table
will look like.
I'm neither for enabling plugins by default but adding in Core such _basic_
features users look for will be an improvement

Agreed - there's also the issue of having important functionality
hidden away in a plugin's interface, when it should be integrated with
the rest of the table management UI.

Good cuestión

I should add also a standard way to download external executables or modules

Hi all,

Is there any need to keep this plugin. It's really old and there is a
growing number of other ways to do this process.

Having 10 different ways to do 1 thing is not good so I would like to
remove it from the code if we can and focus efforts in other areas to
improve those.

Objections?

Hi,
AFAICS, the add field/remove field tools are only available within the
attribute table dialog. They main gain more visibility (and quicker access
when you have huge table) being in Edit or Layer menu, I think.

Sorry for a little off-topic answer, but -1 for making Table Manager a core 
plugin. Please note we have much more advanced tool in the Processing tree: 
Refactor Fields (only available in the advanced mode I guess).

Table Manager was developed as a temporary workaround and despite all the 
effort we put in its safety I never felt comfortable with the responsibility 
for users' data ;) So since we have Refactor Field, I don't have any plans for 
further development and I strongly encourage everyone to use the Refactor 
Field instead.

Best regards,

Borys

Is there any way to make Refactor Field more prominent to the users?  I  
have to admit, I already tried it once and immediately forgot about again.

And the major drawback: There seems to be no way to change the current  
layer, but you have to produce a new one (temporary or new).
This is not very comfortable, compared to Table Manager.

Cheers
Bernd

You missed probably some messages of the list, but there was a processing
packaging problems days ago... And probably you are using an incompatible
version... Remove it fro plugin dir and update again. this should solve.
Let us know.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] No transparency with mbtiles raster and QGIS
	2.12.1 on Ubuntu 15.10
Message-ID: <5661C42A.4080202@gmail.com>

All,
   I'm testing displaying some mbtiles files I created and I'm noticing 
that alpha doesn't appear to be working correctly with them (large solid 
colored blocks displayed instead)

When the tiles are RGBA and compiled to mbtiles they look correct.

Once I use pngquant to compress them to paletted versions and then 
compile then the transparency isn't correct even though I can view the 
individual source tiles and see that the transparency is still there

I found a ticket related to gdal, mbtiles, and transparency 
(https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5439) but I'm not sure how related 
it may be.

Thoughts?

This fix my problem too.  I now have only two problems with "make test"

I just had update "apt-get install python-qt4-sql".  I didn't have to

2.9

	
	



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I used the following to build my current version and it was a virgin git 
pull and build without the DEBUG.  I use "make -j 6" for my builds.

git clone -b release-2_12 --single-branchhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git  QGIS_2_12
cd QGIS_2_12
mkdir qgis-2.12
cd qgis-2.12/
ccmake .. #There in the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE line I entered "Debug"
make

I make two changes for the "ccmake .." and they are ~/apps for the software location

and...

QWT_POLAR as internal.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Starting qgis from the command line gives:


and error box with a traceback with the following:

ImportError: No module named osgeo


and 2nd, the following in an error box:

Unable to load GdalTools plugin.

The required "osgeo [python-gdal]" module is missing.

Install it and try again.


and qgis starts normally with the following dumped to the command line:

Warning: loading of qgis translation failed [/home/jow/apps/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
Warning: QCss::Parser - Failed to load file  "/style.qss"
Warning: QVariantMap DBusMenuExporterDBus::getProperties(int, const QStringList&) const: Condition failed: action
Warning: QVariantMap DBusMenuExporterDBus::getProperties(int, const QStringList&) const: Condition failed: action
ERROR 4: `/initrd.img' not recognised as a supported file format.


The only problem I see is the ERROR 4:.  Why does qgis want to know about Linux boot disk image?  Which in my case is a "ln -s" to the real file in the /boot directory.

I haven't tried to chase the other two error box problems (so they might not be a problem).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


This is an FYI post to the list developers.

Thanks for your great work.

Hi all,

SPIT is now removed from core.  If there is anything missing in the current
stuff that was in SPIT please open a ticket so it can be address in DB
Manager.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgfiRCPHSZYNmmvKF_pzsgdOLDdSU3YHAuxhceZDd6m=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wondering, is there any purpose served by duplicating the doxygen
comments in the SIP bindings?

As far as I can tell, it's:

- not used for anything at all
- tends to be out of sync with the main header docs
- causes extra boring work having to copy changes from the headers to
the sip bindings

Would anyone miss it if these were removed?

Yes, scripts/sipdiff shows less differences.

Without them there will be lots of differences, where there are no actual
differences and the actual differences are buried in that noise.

And with vimdiff's do/dp it's easy to copy the main header docs.

Processing can be used to do bulk imports.

Seems like this change has made the Linux builds of QGIS on Travis
very unstable - the builds frequently take much longer than usual and
result in timing out before completion.

If your PR has reported a failure on Travis, and Travis is saying
"errored" rather than "failed", it's NOT your fault! Don't spend ages
trying to debug it - we'll just have to hope that Travis gets things
sorted quickly on their end.

About processing "Import into PostGIS":

It would be nice to have an option to select the schema
for all layers to be imported, maybe populating the schema
values of the "Run as batch process..." dialog using the
"Schema (schema name)" value in the main "Import into PostGIS" dialog;
otherwise you have to manually edit the schema value for every single
layer, not handy.

Set the schema on the first row and then double click on the column name.

Hi,

Thank you for your response. Could you indicate version of QGIS you use ?

This error recurs on Win and OSX platforms with QGIS > 2.8.3

Please find enclosed a screen shot of the error.


I used win 2.12.1 32bit but i had a layer loaded.

It seems to me that you do not have any layer loaded;
if i open a blank project the coordinates seems to stuck at 0 (zero),
afer "iface.mapCanvas().setDestinationCrs(crs)",
(maybe you ned to give some other option to set it properly ?)
do not know if this is a bug but it's weird indeed, it seems to happen
only with a blank project with no layers.

Message-ID: <1449568204238-5240377.post@n6.nabble.com>

When I recieve KML files from af public state bureau the point coordinates
are written like this in the kml file:

<Point>
<coordinates>8.43307284569448, 55.478226574306</coordinates>
</Point>

When opening it in Qgis all points get a y coordinate of zero. Removing the
blank between the "," and the y coordinate 55.478 solves the problem. Google
Earth can open the files without problems.

Shall I claim the producer for not writing proper KLM or is it an error in
Qgis (or OGR or whatever is used for reading KLM)?

Hi all,

anyone tried to run custom renderer examples from the PyQGIS CookBook [0]?
It seems that this examples does not work, Renderer name is registered, but
widget and renderer itself does not initialized,  looks like
createRenderer() and
createRendererWidget() methods does not called.
Also QgsRendererV2Registry().renderersList() does not list custom renderer.

Any ideas what can be wrong?

This is invalid KML. Depending on whether you use the "old" KML driver or the 
one based on libkml, this will respectively not work / work :
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5140

Yes, the producer should fix their KML.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS Server] Add short name to layers,
	groups and project
Message-ID: <5666BE30.7030302@gmail.com>

Hi Marco, Devs and QGIS server users,

I published a pull-request to 'Add short name to layers, groups and 
project' https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2549

A number of elements have both a <Name> and a <Title>. The Name is a 
text string used for machine-to-machine communication while the Title is 
for the benefit of humans. For example, a dataset might have the 
descriptive Title “Maximum Atmospheric Temperature” and be requested 
using the abbreviated Name “ATMAX”.

User can already set title for layers, groups and project. OWS name is 
based on the name used in layer tree. This name is more a label for 
humans than a name for machine-to-machine communication.

To add the capability to users to define Name as a text string for 
machine-to-machine communication, this pull-request adds:
* short name line edits to layers properties
* WMS data dialog to layer tree group
* short name line edits to project properties
* add a regexp validator "^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\._-]*" to short name line edit

If a short name has been set for layers, groups and project it is used 
by QGIS Sever as the OWS name.

Add a short name lets not need to create a specific project for web 
publishing. This will have an impact for QGIS Web Client and Lizmap. But 
will be usefull to publishing more normalize OGC Web Services (ISO and 
INSPIRE).

Marco, can you review the code ?
Test and feedback are welcomes.

Regards,
René-Luc

It's not an issue :-)

In QgsMapLayer there are originalName and name.
The method setLayerName sets originalName and name.
The attribute name is the capitalize originalName if the settings 
"/qgis/capitaliseLayerName" is set to True.

In the Layer properties the originalName and Name are displayed and the 
originalName is the editable attribute.

You can build qgis server using the same build system of QGIS desktop, just
enable the server component in cmake (and disable the desktop if you only
need the server).

Hi all,
I think the Versioning tool of DB Manager is less known and receives
less attention than it would deserve. More specifically, I think it
could be easily improved by:
* adding an option to add a $user column, and store there the author of
each modification
* currently the commit to the DB fails, because the original ID (which
is not NULLable) is not filled (it must be done by hand, which is not nice).
Anyone willing to fix this? Better opening tickets?
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Selection issue for large set of features
Message-ID: <56684265.5030409@videotron.ca>

Hi All,

I'm contributing to a QGIS python plugin.  Dev environment : 2.8.3 
(compiled) Ubuntu 14.04.

I have an issue getting a list of PK ids from selected features on a 
vector layer pointing to a PG view .  The short story is : I would like 
to use selectedFeaturesIds() but I can't rely on ids returned being the 
actual PK.  The longer story now.

I can use QGSFeature objects and get the field I want.  However, all 
variants that give a list of QGSFeature objects that I've tried fail 
given a large enough number of selected features :

# getting all features with attributes and geom; definitely overkill

layer_selected_features = layer.selectedFeatures()  # Then extract the 
attribute I want

# getting all features but only with the (predetermined) table_pk; 
layer_selected_features_ids was obtained by selectedFeaturesIds()

layer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFids(layer_selected_features_ids).setFlags( 
QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry ).setSubsetOfAttributes( 
[table_pk],layer.pendingFields() )))  # Then extract the attribute I want

A note on the previous line : I found out order of the filtering 
elements matters.

# Using a feature iterator

layerSelectedFeaturesIterator = layer.selectedFeaturesIterator()
layer_selected_features_ids = list(i[table_pk] for i in 
layerSelectedFeaturesIterator) # I get directly the list of items I want

When the feature selection gets large enough the code fails silently and 
no list is returned.

I was hoping I could use selectedFeaturesIds().  I tried it with my 
largest data sets and it works.  Only problem is : the id list it 
returns may or may not correspond with the actual table PK the view 
points to.  setKeyColumn() on the layer won't make selectedFeaturesIds() 
return a list of ids with the new keyColumn().  I was thinking maybe I 
could pass in the field name for the PK (that I know) to some 
constructor (datasource, layer ?) and then be satisfied the list of ids 
returned by selectedFeaturesIds() would be fine.

Pointers appreciated.

Cheers,

Yves

As far as I remember, the issue was that Processing didn't know the names
of the rasters user want to use in the calculation. r.mapcalculator was
working around this issue by separating the expression and raster names. -l
flag now tells the names to the caller without actually performing the
operation. There will be some special code needed in Processing (which
makes sense as r.mapcalc is special).

I don't really follow you here but it seems to me that the issue might be
that -l still requires the rasters to exist. If this is the case please,
continue the discussion in GRASS ticket #2592.

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/2592

> One question, why r.mapcalculator is not available in GRASS 7? I

I guess that simply nobody contributed a Python version of it. Bash scripts
are not guaranteed to work with G7 on MS Win, so the old script cannot be
used.

> haven't fiund any note about its removal in the changelog.

My impression is that it was never officially added in the first place, so
maybe that's the reason. Discussing this on the grass-dev mailing list or
in a ticket might be a good idea.

Best,
Vaclav

Forgive off-topic, but is the Travis website down at the mo? It's doing
builds and sending result email fine, but I can't browse to travis-ci.org.

Hi Paolo,

You mean like in the wiki page
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Hydrology_and_Hydraulic_modelling
;)

It would be nice to have all this things in one place - we try to at
least collect all related stuff at this wiki page .. got to enter the
rivergis too.
But coordinating plugins to avoid duplication could be a bit tricky -
plugins appear and are finished ..
I am still willing to collect all hydrology related stuff and probably
collect them within a special menu .. (but therefor I would have to
change the source code)

regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem in Displaying Myanmar Unicode Font in QGIS
Message-ID: <CAAQr1jbyr9=Vc=5DOMRfahwupK2+aXQ39VjQi5QJ-dTLxDNdqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

I'm one of the QGIS user and promoter from Myanmar.
In Myanmar, the official language are in Myanmar Unicode, version 3.0 or
later.
But when I try to use the Myanmar Unicode character and fonts in QGIS (all
versions), the Myanmar characters are not displaying in proper order both
in Map display and in attribute table.
For alternative option, I tried to use the non-unicode character and fonts
(ZawGyiOne), it does not appearing well and give the same problem.

I've attached the files and screenshot of problems. Attachments

I'm using the postGIS tables which can have more than 255 character in
attribute table.
For your convenient, I've attached the GIS file that I used in ESRI
shapefile, geojason and psql format.

Please download from the
http://gis.themimu.info/QGIS/Myanmar-Unicode-in-QGIS.zip  [2.8 MB] if the
attachment failed to send.

The Myanmar text that is use for entering into attribute is from the
following link.
http://www.rabbit-converter.org/Rabbit/

Can you please fix this problem in order support entering and displaying
Myanmar Character in QGIS.

I'm using Window7, Window 8.1 64 bit OS with QGIS version 2.10.

Thank you very much in advance for supporting QGIS users in Myanmar.

Have a nice day!

Yes, I had in mind this as a start point.

By coordinating I mean writing to plugins authors and try to convince
them to merge forces and avoid duplications. I do this regularly, and
the occasional successes have improved users life a lot (and ultimately
also developers').
I would like this work was done by someone deeper into hydro than
myself, as he can suggest specific cases for merging and splitting
functions, etc.
All the best.

Greetings,

Long story short, QGIS compiled against Qt4 (which is what the official
version does) doesn't support proper Burmese script ordering under linux.
This is due to Qt4 (not actively developed anymore) using an old library to
shape unicode scripts.

QGIS compiled against Qt5 fixes all rendering issues for Burmese language.

Therefore at the moment your options are to either
a/ run QGIS on windows 7 (within a virtual machine if you don't want to
permanently install the OS); or
b/ compile a QGIS build for yourself if you are able to do so, from which
you could create packages to distribute to other users.

I should have added that Qt4 doesn't have rendering issues because it
shapes text using the windows uniscribe library.

You don't say anything about the platform and/or version of QGIS.

With QGIS trunk version SAGA GIS 2.2.2 should be supported for some time 
now [1]. As far as I can see, this is not the case with newest release 
2.12.1.

Greetings,

Great to hear Math.

Where can I download QGIS  source code for 32 bit & 64 bit Windows and if
will make us easy if some reference document for building are also
available?
I'm happy to try it.

Many thanks & best regards

Hi all,

Is anyone else getting a crash when opening layer properties on
current master? This is under Ubuntu 15.10, 64 bit.

I'm trying to determine if this is something local or something which
has crept in recently.

I should have read your email more carefully, you quite clearly state that
the rendering is broken on windows too. Good to know, as it offers yet one
more argument to support the migration to Qt5.

Just in case this might actually be a font problem instead of a rendering
problem, have you tried to display the ZawGyiOne and unicode text using the
appropriate font (vs. the default system font which is used in the
attribute table shown in your screenshots)?

Instructions to build QGIS are here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL, however it doesn't cover
Qt5. Maybe Matthias Kuhn can help here.

I resolve the issue.

Infact seem the getcapabilites is stored in a cache 8available also in
the 2.6.1 version of qgis).

To empty the cache is this:

options -> network -> cache settings -> clear.

After this the connection to my wms server was able to show me the new
wms layers added.

Regards.

I think it occured only with Qt5, no?

I'm also on Ubuntu 15.10 64 bit using QGIS Master and I don't get a 
crash when opening layer properties. It all works fine.

Paolo, are you using the master version? SAGA 2.2.2 is harcoded as a
supported version, and all higher version should be supported

see:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/SagaAlgorithmProvider.py#L47

2.2.2 seems to be working fine here...

Not, 2.10.3; same with 2.6: on QGIS 2.8.4.

Message-ID: <1449763080578-5240750.post@n6.nabble.com>

Apologies for idiocy, but I somehow seem to have moved my Python console
slightly off the top of my screen meaning that its title bar is no longer
visible. I therefore cannot grab it to move it. Is there a QSetting or
something which I can change via the console to move it back down?

I've sometimes had my console open up that way.  The top was only a 
little bit up off the screen but enough that I could not click on it to 
move it.

I think what I did was resize the console window by grabbing the bottom 
and it moved the top bar down into the window.

It did not make sense but it worked.  More that once. :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem editing and exporting 3D Postgis layers
Message-ID: <CAMCJChsmo2uGN6XvwKj4h2YPedb3YBBtXPJf=_qqa3Cw09ngww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There is a problem when trying to export 3D layers from PostGIS to
shapefile, using "Save as..." of QGIS 2.12 and master. Tested with Pointz,
PolygonZ, MultiPolygonZ, ... Always appears the following error:

Export to vector file failed.
Error: Feature write errors:
Feature geometry not imported (OGR error: )
Only 0 of 1 features written.

Despite the error, it creates a shapefile, but only the structure, without
data, and a 2D shapefile.

The same operation (Save as...) with QGIS 2.8.4, works fine, but also
converts the shapefile to 2D.

Making the export with ogr2ogr, works well and keeps the shapefile in 3D.

Save as... from a 3d shapefile to another shapefile, also works well on all
QGIS versions, and keeps 3D geometry.


Another problem occurs when trying to edit those same 3D PostGIS layers.

With the layers in shapefile, everything works fine. Importing 3D shapes
for PostGIS, works well. Edit these layers/geometries in Postgis, including
moving geometries or vertex, editing attributes or the Z coordinate of the
vertex (with the Node Tool) also works well.

But when trying to add a new feature, it can no longer write to the
PostGIS, and this error show up:

Could not commit changes to layer point
Errors: ERROR: 1 feature(s) not added.
  Provider errors:
      PostGIS error while adding features: ERROR:  Column has Z dimension
but geometry does not


Are these bugs? Could they be related? I am sending a sample 3D shapefile
for tests ->
$ ogrinfo -al 3d_point.shp
INFO: Open of `3d_point.shp'
      using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.

I'd like to get this discussion moving again, since timing is critical.

What I see as the way forward:

- Get PSC to vote on and accept
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/29 . Needs
to be done ASAP so that we're all agreed that 2.14 is the last 2.0
series release.

- Decide on the timing for 3.0. Specifically, will the normal
scheduled release after 2.14 be skipped to allow for a longer
development cycle for 3.0. Regarding this, my opinion is that we NEED
the longer cycle to allow room for the (non Qt5/python 3.0) related
changes which we can ONLY make for an API breaking release. There's
already a long list at https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues, and
I suspect this is only scratching the surface. Without sufficient time
for devs to address these API related issues we'll be stuck with the
limitations of the current API for another 2-3 years.

Anyway, can we please lock in point 1 above so that we can move the
discussion on to timing?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using pgservice.conf doesn't work to save styles
	in DB
Message-ID: <CAGvsbY6yBG1tKovQw-3YfAdxiui3z7+sUafMrujVPuiVwwtDuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Today I saved styles for some layers from PostGIS, and few minutes before I
change how to connect to PostGIS, now I using pgservice.conf following this
link:
http://qgep.github.io/docs/installation-guide/system/workstation.html
(thanks to Barascu Tudor)

I can save styles in database, but I can't use this styles after in another
layer or in the same layer in another map...
when I used a normal connection to PostGIS I could use this option!
Is this a problem known?
Should I do a comit in github?

Thank in advance and best regards,

Hi Nyall,

Isn't that backwards?  I think we need to start with the work, see how it goes
and then decide when it's ready to be merged - and maybe make plans earlier if
something solid materializes.

I thought we already agreed on doing the work in a branch and eventually merge
it back - depending on whether Qt5/PyQt5/Python3 is feasible without major
breakages before 2.14 and if it's not later.  

But we didn't actually create a branch yet. I think we should start with that.

Hi Math,

Sure, I've used the appropriate fonts for each of them.
They both have issue.

I'll try building from source code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] min GDAL dependencies for use with QGIS
Message-ID: <1449807331718-5240839.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All, I have a custom build of GDAL with some features that require a
minimum of MS Visual Studio 2013 on Windows and GCC 4.9+ on Linux that I
would like to swap into QGIS. In order for QGIS to nominally function it
seems that it needs more than the base GDAL. Anyone aware of a deploy of
QGIS on windows where the GDAL is built against at least VS2013? If
not...Any ideas of the minimal set of plugins that need to be build into
GDAL in order for it to work with QGIS 2.10+? 1.11.x or 2.x?Cheers,Jerry

Tracked it down. It was the "qt-at-spi" package causing it. Removing
that package fixed the crash. Not sure how it had installed itself
through.

Not yet. I need to create individual SVG files for each Icon, and I will
need some help to set file extentions to use them. I have no idea where to
do that.

Cheers,

Alexandre

That will be up to individual packagers for the different operating systems
to implement.

In the git repository only the master & release-2_12 branches support
SAGA 2.2 looking at the history of python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/.

It would be great if this can be backported for QGIS 2.8.5. That would
enable us to close Debian Bug #807339 which also reports the lack of
support for SAGA 2.2 as found in Debian testing & unstable. Fortunately
the qgis backport is not affected because jessie ships with SAGA 2.1.2.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Core support to LAS files
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP190706F8BFFAF990B119841A7ED0@phx.gbl>

Hi devs,
I remember a discussion on LAS native support in QGIS (so 
VTerrain/Lastools/FUSION excluded), that was depending on a lack in 
OpenGL support or something similar (sorry, I'm clearly not a 
developer). Is there any update?
Recently, I found out THIS 
<http://www.dielmo.com/eng/descargas_dielmoopenlidar.php>material: it's 
old but open. Can it be interesting as a working basis for the rendering 
engine (with all necessary updates)?
hope it may help.

all the best,

Niccolò

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any python bindings for
	analysis/openstreetmap/qgsosm* ?
Message-ID: <D294909E.14A2%baginski3@llnl.gov>

I'd like to use some of the classes and functionality in the
src/analysis/openstreetmap/qgsosm* files from python, but there are not
any pyqgis bindings for this section of code.

Are there any plans to create python bindings for these classes?

I can probably create pure python code that querys the osmdatabase
structure for what I need. However I'm trying to figure out if it would be
easier to create or wait for python bindings before I proceed.

Thanks,

Tom

Hey Tom,

I see no reason there is no bindings.  If you are not in a rush I can add
them for the next release.

Adding bindings to the next release will be helpful in the long term.
Thanks.

In the short term I'll probably just query the sqlite tables directly from
my python code for the bit of functionality that I need now.

As far as I know/remember the get/creation of style use the same
connection, so, I found really strange this problem, and seems more a
server side configuration problem.

if you can replicate it, please feel free to file an issue

cheers

​Hi Victor,
Have you had chance yet to look into this? I can work with a work-around
for now but would be great to see this cleared up.

One (I if you like) can add g.mapsets with the s-flag as a module (I tested "g.mapsets -s" in the QGIS-GRASS-plugin and it starts the GRASS dialogue successfully), but it is probably better to have this option a bit more prominent (as it might come in handy with the new multiple map input option)?

I have added "Add/Remove mapset to/from search path" as new browser
actions in master. There are now also distinct icons for mapset, open

I think this change that i just added should help with that

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/08a8b6095f09ffc88b8bf034470b1c5a3cab3486

Now the default scripts folder will always be in the users folder, no
matter how Processing is used/called.

Hope this helps!

Try to uninstall QGIS and then add this as a repo:

deb http://qgis.org/debian wily main

Try to reinstall - I haven't installed Mint 17 so I might give that a 
shot to see if it works (currently running Ubuntu 15.10.

Hi

I faced again the compilation error on tests

the problem was already faced by Nyall. I proposed a pull request to
solve(workaround) the problem.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2587

but a better investigation would be necessary...

It's only me having this problem on this platform?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC - Add vector layer to GetPrint Request?
Message-ID: <20151216141607.795940fd@karibik.Speedport_W_724V_Typ_A_05011602_00_001>

First of all,
great to here that a "QWC II" is planned for the near future!  :)
Nevertheless, I have a question about the current QWC and the GetPrint
Request.

I'd like to append an openlayers vector layer, which I am creating in
the map, to the getprint Request. How can that be done?

I've looked through the source code and in the QGISExtensions.js I
found the possibility to append the 'highlightParams'. Unfortunately I
cant figure out how to adapt this method to work with my layer. 

So my question: Can anyone tell me a link to a doc or a thread, which
serves as a starting point for me? Or give me a clue about how to add a
vector layer to the GetPrint and thus to my printcomposer template?

Thank you
Marc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis2web 1.0.0-beta1 launched
Message-ID: <1450272767788-5241596.post@n6.nabble.com>

I've released a first beta of qgis2web version 1.0.0. I've made the jump to
v1 because all features are available for both OL3 and Leaflet exports.
Recent major additions include support for multiple projections in OL3,
along with geocode, geolocate, and measure. Leaflet now uses qgis2web
templates, which have also been simplified to make them much more useful.

I've not made this version experimental in the QGIS plugins repo, as I have
tested as well as I can, and hopefully there will not be a large number of
new bugs. It also means I stand a better chance of getting more bug reports
in.

As always, if anyone is able to contribute to the development of the plugin,
I'd be very grateful.

Probably not - but probably not too many people are on wily/amd64.  Other
platforms don't have that problem (not even wily/i386).   Seems to be related
to the toolchain there (maybe cmake, I don't know).  Someone able to reproduce
the problem should probably file a ubuntu ticket (not sure where - I use
Debian).

Sorry for the late reply

This looks like an issue when refreshing the layer after the new style
is set. The iface.mapCanvas().refresh() call doesn't seem to be
working. I will try to see if there's another way of doing this now. I
remember this was working fine at the time, but maybe there have been
changes in the rendering engine and that line has to be updated

Will let you know if this is fixed

It is a workaround because it does not solve the origin of the issue
as stated correctly by Jürgen. The problem seem related with something
in the wily packaging.
I'll try to find time to check where notify the problem to the Ubuntu packager.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python and OSGEO4W
Message-ID: <5672AA6C.5020001@gmail.com>

Hi devs,
I have some doubts related to plugin installation.
We are writing a plugin that requires some additional python package
(which can be installed trough pip). On Linux machine there aren't
difficulties, but on Windows machine all the process could be not so easy.

The main difficulty seems related in machines that have already a python
installed. In this cases it could be necessary to specify the python
path in the environmental variables of the machine.

So I have some questions:
* if QGIS is installed with OSGEO4W and not with the standalone package,
these problems are still present or OSGEO4W creates a kind of standalone
QGIS-python system?
* I'm quite sure there are not chances to auto-install python package
(via pip) once the plugin is downloaded in the main menu?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

AFAIK, QGIS for Windows platform (both standalone and OSGeo4W)
has "built-in" Python which does not interact/overlaps with other Python
intepreters.

If you need to install pure Python modules, you always can use pip. There
are lot of posts about using pip with OSGeo4W [0-3].

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Please repackage debian binary with new
	dependencies on libgsl2
Message-ID: <5672F46D.7050907@ens-lyon.fr>

Hello,

I am running QGIS on a debian stretch platform. After some transitional
time where libgsl0ldbl and libgsl2 did not exclude themselves, gnome and
other important packages upgraded their dependencies from libgsl0ldbl 
to libgsl2 and as a consequence libgsl0ldbl and qgis have been uninstalled.
It is not any more possible to reinstall QGIS because dependencies on
gnome require uninstalling gnome.... Which cannot be done of course !

I had successfully installed QGIS Lyon on stretch platform from this
repository :
deb     http://qgis.org/debian unstable  main

Would it be possible to compile and rebuild debian package with these
new dependencies, I have tried to compile myself but QGIS compilation is
rather tricky and requires advanced configurations for which I am
lacking time.

Thanks for tour work

Best regards

Message-ID: <5673D5F8.5020003@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I am receiving invalid "Content-Length" (always 108) in WFS response when
running QGIS Mapserver as fastcgi with Lighttpd, which means that client will
terminate connection before downloading whole response.

My request:

http://localhost:8090/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?
MAP=user%2Fnatural-earth%2Fcentral-europe.qgs
&outputFormat=GeoJSON
&service=WFS
&maxfeatures=10
&propertyname=*

&typename=Places
&startindex=50
&version=1.0.0

When running '/usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi' from command line with the
same request exported as QUERY_STRING, whole response is received.

Anybody with the same problem ? Should I submit bug report ?

Sorry for the encryption :) :

HI Gerard,
I had the same problem (I'm on a Debian testing machine).

I succesfully compiled QGIS master installing first libgsl-dev:

So I have libgsl2 and libgsl-dev instelled on my computer and the the
compilation works fine.

hope this help!

Cheers

Hi Ivan,

It has been probably fixed and backported :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13991

And tests has been added :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2583

Hi,

might be unrelated, but I'm experiencing segfaults with current master in
CGI mode, see
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14001

Are you testing with current master?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Undo command crashes QGIS when called from within
	plugin.
Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EAD03B4@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

I have code within a plugin that I am writing that is similar to:

```
def feature_added(self, fid):
    self.vlayer.beginEditCommand('Update attributes')
    self.vlayer.changeAttributeValue(fid, 2, 17)
    self.vlayer.endEditCommand()
```

It is called in response to a featureAdded signal from the layer.  The command runs and the attributes are updated and the canvas refreshes to show them.  However, when I check the undoStack for the layer, the command is not present.  When I press 'Undo', QGIS has a hard crash.

If I use the QGIS iPython console to access the layer directly through my plugin (e.g. via qgis.utils.plugins['MyPlugin']) and type the equivalent commands directly into the console, everything works as expected, but the changes are not visible until the canvas is manually refreshed.

Is there something else that should / shouldn't be called by the plugin to put the undo command onto the stack?

I'm on QGIS 2.12.0 on Linux Mint 17 (Ubuntu 14.04).

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAMDQVi7jGcpwyAaS7YBUrxO+qnjpzduEbYf0AxAUBBCwq7OvFw@mail.gmail.com>

This mail has also been sent to osgeo4w-dev initially

Hi guys

Don't know if this is the right place to ask.

Grass 7.1 dev was just made 64 bit, and can be installed via osgeo4w.  It
is available in QGIS processing, but not as a plugin unlike the QGIS Grass
7 plugin for 32 bit.

Anyone working on this?

Regards.

The grass plugin will be made with the release version of GRASS 7 (just like on
32bit) - as soon as Martin Landa makes it available.

currently you can test 64bit edition by installing `grass-daily`
package. The first GRASS version uploaded as 32bit and 64bit package
will be 7.0.3 which should be released in the middle of January [1].

Hi,

Using today's nightly from OSGeo4W (64bit Win8), QGIS crashes every time I
select a layer in the Topology Checker configuration dialog.

Can you confirm? Should I open a ticket?

Is something wrong or daily builds are not performed on 'daily' basis ?

* Builds are triggered every day/night.
* The build is skipped if, there is still one running
* The build goes into the release repository instead of the nightly
  one, when there is a new release (as the nightly would be the same commit).
* 2.8.5 and 2.12.2 were on friday, so the build does both releases and
  master.
* 2.8.5 initially failed and needed 7895e99, 2.12.2 failed on trusty ubuntugis
  and will be added manually.

So it just needs a bit of patience.

I did expect that daily would be skipped if the release is the same commit,
but unfortunately I didn't found it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feature fix #4273 and possibly #3756
	(qgsdecorationitem)
Message-ID: <5677F603.8020700@googlemail.com>

Hi,

I've been having a bit of a look around the code for this and think it 
would be a fairly small job to  implement and thought I'd let you know 
that I planned to have a go at it.

I think this is probably of interest to Médéric Ribreux, who posted an 
update recently, or Tim Sutton, who is the assignee of #3756.

I plan to start with qgsdecorationnortharrow but thought that the idea 
in #3756 for using page percentage seemed better than just adding some 
more defined locations, as suggested in #4273.

I hope this is ok. Let me know if you have any input.


Thanks,

Duncan

Hi all,
when D&D between different DBs, a SERIAL column is silently converted

table tool throws an error. To me this seems a bug, anyone disagrees?

Hi devs,

Because PyQgsDocCoverage failed on travis for my PR #2549, I activated 
it and tested it on my own computer.

On the master, I obtained 3857 instead of 3827 missing documentation.

I'd like to know ho to configured QGIS build to have this test passed ?

Hi René-Luc,

It depends on which modules are built (and probably on other
system-specific metrics). You can have a look into
ci/travis/linux/install.sh

With the same cmake options you should get at least close to what travis
checks, but there may still be a delta.

This test is not intended to pass locally and one should not care as
long as it passes on travis.

Bests,
Matthias

Note that this is just a temporary situation. When the threshold hits 0,
the test will work consistently both locally and on Travis.

Not disagreeing about the bug  - but:

A "serial" data type in PostgreSQL is syntatic sugar for "integer NOT NULL
DEFAULT nextval('some_sequence'::regclass)" combined with the implicit
creation of a sequence used in the DEFAULT clause.

So the D&D function *do* create the correct base type for the column, but
fails to create the corresponding sequence and default clause for the
column.

Hi

It seems that some CurvePolygons are not drawn in the map canvas. All
features are in the attribute table and you can even label them and the
label appears but some CurvePolygons are not visible. (Maybe the ones with
curves?)

Can anybody confirm this?

I have noticed this as well (based on a pg dataset).
Segmentizing them in the db or rendering the outline worked.

Hi all,
a new installation of qgis server is repeatedly crashing here[0]. The
same projects are working with a previous installation. I also tried
rebuilding a project from scratch, and it works with just one layer, as
I add more I get the crash.
Any hint? Seems a pretty serious issue.
Thanks.

Is it happening with master or 2.12 ?

I've also seen master crashing quite often recently, but the symptoms are
different, see: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/14001

I spent one day to identify the offending commit but I couldn't track it
down yet :(

Hi Paolo,

Do all the layers have the same provider ?
Do you have crashes with Shapefile ? PostGIS layers ? Raster layers ?

Hi Paolo,

I also have these crashes.

See http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13919

I am pretty sure it has to do with this "QGIS server security patch" 
from Stéphane. My troubles started after this got merged into master.

Can you check if the version before 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/422abbde5e5b76924d3b78eba42d61a4f4c18563 
is still ok?

Hi Andreas,

QGIS 2.8.5 does not integrate "QGIS server security patch". It cannont 
be the cause of Paolo issue.

Thanks a lot Andreas! So this crept into LTR?
Which LTR version is before the issue? 2.8.4?
All the best.

Yes, I know -

but with my projects it works fine before that commit and crashes 
reliably after that crash.

The other thing is that it got horribly slow after that commit.

Maybe there are two different overlapping issues, though.

Hi all,
in short, is ther a chance that downgrading to 2.8.4 would solve the issue?
Thanks.

2.8.4 reinstalled, I confirm the regression. IMHO this should be fixed
very soon, it does not speak well of our LTR.
Ticket here:

Thanks for helping me understanding this.

Message-ID: <567A5546.7070807@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
after the crash on the server, I'm getting strange behaviours from the
desktop: the program refuses to close, and I have to kill it manually.
This might be due to PostGIS connections, slow and possibly hanging.
Perhaps better to revert to 2.8.4 immediately, and fix these issues
before releasing a new version? LTR has been a big success, and well
received, it would be a pity to spoil its perception among corporate users.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Maybe it's easy enough to debug and release 2.8.6 immediately?
I would assume that some of the beneficiaries of this huge success would
be able to fund fixing this issue.

Even so, leaving a buggy supposed LTR around, even for a few days, does
not speak well about our QA, that's why I suggested to revert
immediately, and yes, seeking for funders of the bug (I understand
Andreas has potential donors already).
All the best.

Hi,

There is enough funding in the QGIS.ORG project funds to pay someone to 
work on fixing important issues.

But someone has to do it. And I guess there need to be proper bug reports.

Hi Paolo,

Did your issue is only on one platform : debian ? or all platforms ?
Some one lese can test QGIS 2.8.5 with PostGIS connection ?

Me and Jürgen are the only one to modify QGIS 2.8 between 2.8.4 and 2.8.5.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/release-2_8

Some update on debian packaging has been made. Probably the problem is here.

For the desktop, I'm trying to reproduce it reliably, more feedback

Hi all,
in a project of mine, a layer 50% transparent, with different colours,
is rendered very differently by the server (a more or less uniform
grey). In previous versions of the server it was OK. Is this a known
problem?
I can set up a sample project to show this, it that helps.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPC7bA7_m4DkbohiNwwbi_qVH-u7cNSWzVZEP-t=T09+Pw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed strange behavior of the QgsRasterNuller when saving paletted
singleband raster to GeoTiff format. If input raster has no NODATA value, then
output raster will have NODATA value set to 0, even if such values
are not defined in the QgsRasterNuller.

Not sure is this bug or maybe I'm doing something wrong. Tested with
landcover.img layer from QGIS test dataset [0]. Here is my code

from qgis.core import *

outPath = '/tmp/test.tif'
layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
provider = layer.dataProvider()

writer = QgsRasterFileWriter(outPath)
writer.setOutputFormat('GTiff')

pipe = QgsRasterPipe()
if not pipe.set(provider.clone()):
    print 'Cannot set pipe provider'

nuller = QgsRasterNuller()
for band in xrange(1, provider.bandCount() + 1):
    nuller.setNoData(band, [])
if not pipe.insert(1, nuller):
    print 'Cannot set pipe nuller'

projector = QgsRasterProjector()
projector.setCRS(layer.crs(), layer.crs())
if not pipe.insert(2, projector):
    print 'Cannot set pipe projector'

writer.writeRaster(pipe, layer.width(), layer.height(),
layer.extent(), layer.crs())

result = QgsRasterLayer(outPath, 'converted', 'gdal')
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(result)


Any ideas what is wrong?

I doubt it, if you look at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_8_4...final-2_8_5

you'll find that there are only minimal changes in the packaging (as most of
3907acd was reverted in deb34b8) - but the rest of the changes don't look
suspicious either.

Maybe something related to reprojection or a changed dependency?  Unfortunatly
the ticket doesn't give enough information to reproduce the problem.

Hi all,
as far as I can see, in 2.8.5 new saga is still not usable: any hope to
have it back? I think this is a major drawback for a LTR version.
All the best.

sorry I couldn't debug it more thoroughly. Deps are not a good
candidate, as I simply uninstalled 2.8.5 and reinstalled 2.8.4, the
other libs should be mostly the same.
as for the projection, those working were either unreprojected, or with
OTF on 4326. All others were OTF to 3857 , 32632 or 25832.
Hope this helps.
All the best, and thanks.

Got it, this happens when I use png8, not with png24. See a sample project:
http://www200test.regione.toscana.it/lizmap/index.php/view/map/?repository=geosisma&project=test_transparency
It is worth a ticket?
Thanks.

I think that changes in Processing to support newer SAGA versions have
not been backported to the 2.8.x series, which explains that.

However, with SAGA being the less predictable software ever having
tons of API breaks in each version...I dont think our LTR should move
the supported SAGA version. If 1.8 had support for SAGA 2.1, it should
stick to that for all 2.8.x, and actually the installers and bundles
should not advance the version and ship that same version of SAGA
always. And if not using a bundled version, the user should install
the supported version of SAGA, not a more recent one, since that will
probably compromise the stability.

My 2 cents

Hi Victor,
thanks for the response. Unfortunately, this holds true only for distros
where we have complete control over the stack (only Win, I believe). On
Debian, as in my case, packages get updated all the time, so we really
have no choice. I acknowledge the issues with saga changes; on the other
hand, supporting newer versions on more context will help us spotting
issues and fixing them earlier.
Of course, the alternative is to fork saga and keep and internal stable
version. I noticed, however, that currently there seems to be more
activity than in the past, so forking will be bad:
http://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/code-0/commit_browser
All the best.

Ok, then we can cherry pick the commits that improve SAGA support, to
backport them to the 2.8 branch. Makes sense

I don't think that png8 can have an alpha channel.

No transparencies are possible for that format.

That's what I expected, but the greying out effect is surprising, please
have a look to my example.
In fact, a warning on the Lizmap plugin could be useful.

Hi Paolo,

PNG 8bit, it's a degradation of the color palette to be stored in an 8 
bit table.
The greying effect is a result of this compression. PNG 8bit has to be 
used for a layer with no effect rendered with a grey palette or with a 
reduce number of color.

For the lizmap plugin, you can open an issue to add alert.

Regards,

Would it be possible/reasonable for QGIS repositories to provide the
supported versions of SAGA alongside QGIS? This issue comes up often and it
seems to consume a lot of the Processing developer's time (which seems to
be very limited at the moment).

This is a possibility, however we should probably fake saga version, as
the newer one in main repo would still be installed otherwise.
Thanks for thoughts.
All the best.

Is it not possible to have a copy of Saga local to the QGIS installation,
like the local Python install? Faking the main Saga version sounds like a
bad idea, breaking users' ability to upgrade it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Warning which failed travis build
Message-ID: <567BEC49.8000104@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

The last commit on master provides a failed on travis build. A warning 
provides it.
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/98617711
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS&filtercount=1&showfilters=1&field1=buildname/string&compare1=63&value1=8f29f28d5c5f3f24db40b5183152db0b5b425562&date=2015-12-24

src/providers/ogr/qgsogrexpressioncompiler.cpp:51:12: warning: 
enumeration values 'ntInOperator', 'ntLiteral', and 'ntColumnRef' not 
handled in switch [-Wswitch]

Can I added the line removed from 
src/providers/ogr/qgsogrexpressioncompiler.cpp

default:
       return QgsSqlExpressionCompiler::compileNode( node, result );

To fix it ?

I thought that the problem could be related to the libqextserialport1 
but it is correctly installed:

matteo at debian:~/lavori/QGIS/QGIS$ aptitude search qextserialport
p   libqextserialport-  - interface to serial ports for Qt-based 
applications, debug info
i   libqextserialport-dev  to serial ports for Qt-based applications
i A libqextserialport1 - interface to serial ports for Qt-based apps - 
development files


any ideas or am I missing something?!

Thanks!!

Matteo

How?  Like described in
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc11
?

Looks like you don't have libgeos-dev installed - which should make
dpkg-buildpackage fail, which it apparently doesn't.

that's weird.. it seems it is installed:


matteo at debian:~/lavori/QGIS/QGIS$ aptitude search libgeos
p   libgeos++-  - Geometry engine for GIS - C++ development files
i A libgeos-3.4.2 - engine for Geographic Information Systems - C++ Library
i A libgeos-c1 - engine for Geographic Information Systems - C Library
p   libgeos-dbg - symbols for the GEOS library
i   libgeos-dev - engine for GIS - Development files
p   libgeos-doc -  for the GEOS GIS geometry engine library
p   libgeos-ruby1.8  - Transitional package from libgeos-ruby1.8 to 
ruby-geos



can I give you some other useful information to find the error?

Thanks again!

Matteo

yes..
I tried to re-run:

but I get the same error

Thanks

sorry I was scared of this output:

matteo at debian:~/lavori/QGIS/QGIS$ dch -l ~jessie --force-distribution 
--distribution jessie "jessie build"
dch warning: Recognised distributions are: unstable, testing, stable,
oldstable, experimental, {testing-,stable-,oldstable-,}proposed-updates,
{testing,stable,oldstable}-security, wheezy-backports, jessie-backports 
and UNRELEASED.
Using your request anyway.



I'll give it a try now, thanks!

Thanks Jürgen it worked!
If you don't mind I can add something to the instruction file..

just one more small information..

is there a way to avoid the compilation of some packages before running

dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -j4

?

for example the API package is quite big and I didn't install it after 
the packaging.. so it would be quicker to don't include in the packaging..

Thanks again!

Hi all.
Currently, using only qgis repos, gis-plugin-grass is not installable
for 2.8.5, and 2.13 is also not installable because of an older version
of liblwgeom (2.1.8). Anything we can do?
All the best, and thanks.

Distribution?   BTW there are nightlies of the release branches too.

So if you're using a changing distribution (like unstable) dependencies might
have changed, which might break the packages for that distribution.  Switching
to the nightlies for that distribution should help (if there was a new commit
on that branch after the distribution change).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS server  ignoring on-the-fly reprojection
Message-ID: <568259ED.7030905@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear all,
we have recently discovered that WFS server is completely ignoring on-the-fly
reprojection of the project.

For example, I have layers in EPSG 4326 and on-the-fly reprojection is enabled
to Spherical Mercator EPSG 3857. The problem is that all WFS requests are
still returning features in 4326.

I know that WFS 1.0.0 doesn't support SRSNAME parameter, but I think, that if
 on-the-fly reprojection is enabled, WFS server should behave as all layers
would be in target coordinate system, which means that whole reprojection
should be internal feature of QGIS and would be completely hidden for WFS service.


The questions are:
* is my observation correct ?
* is anybody working on some fix ?
* if nobody is working on fix, would it be accepted ?

Thank you very much.

Hi Ivan,

I agree that it would be expected behavior that the WFS layers are 
delivered in the CRS of the project. Seems logical to me.

However, for performance reasons, OTF reprojection should not be 
recommended to new users - esp. in QGIS server context.

​Hi Stefan,

Maybe ask again on the bug tracker. Unfortunately, I cannot change to open
myself.

Yes, but in WMS server OTF reprojection is working correctly for some time.
I agree that OTF reprojection is performance penalty, but such inconsistency
when this feature is available for desktop and WMS and not available for WFS
is much more confusing.

Is anybody working on OTF implementation for WFS server or should we provide a
fix ?

Hi Ivan,

QGIS Server implements WFS version 1.0.0. In this version SRSNAME 
parameter does not exist. The WFS 1.0.0 is defined as a way to access 
and edit raw vector data. Because of this definition, I have implemented 
WFS as a way to access and edit data as it is and in the CRS of the layer.

If you think "Server Side Transformation" will be useful for clients, I 
think it will be preferable to implement WFS 1.1.0 with transactional 
capabilities than force transformation.

In my WFS WGIS Server Todo list, I have :
* Add tests before extending QGIS Server WFS capapbilties
* Implement WFS 2 or WFS 1.1.0

Tests will be my priority before adding features.

Regards,
René-Luc

Thanks for the reply. I'm aware of this, that's why I used nightly both
for LTR and 2.13, but had no luck. Currently nightly-ltr wants to
install 2.8.2.
All the best.

Hi René-Luc,
I understand your point of view, you are right with the "WFS 1.0.0"
definition. You are also right that in 1.0.0 there is no SRSNAME parameter.

But I don't agree with raw data definition. Raw data, in terms of QGIS WFS
server should be the same as raw data from QGIS Desktop point of view. In
Desktop, if OTF reprojection is enabled, you also see, browse and edit data in
target SRS. The same behavior is implemented in WMS and should be in WFS. Raw
data for all use cases should be project itself.

This means that we don't need to have SRSNAME parameter to have reprojected
data. We need just to update "raw data" definition and consistent implementation.

Thank you very much for your work.

I guess you are using a distribution that has GRASS 7.  2.8 doesn't support the
plugin with GRASS7.

Morning,

I've put the changes together for these features. This is my first 
contribution, so I wondered if I could check that I'm making the pull 
request properly. Hopefully make it a bit easier for whoever deals with it.

I ran the changes through prepare-commit.sh which fixed a few formatting 
issues. I plan to rebase the
branch onto the latest main and push up to my forked github repo and 
issue the pull request.

I've made a couple of amendments to the dialogs for the north arrow, 
scalebar and copyright decoration items. Should I check these with 
anyone before making the pull request?

There aren't any existing tests for these classes. Would you like me to 
put some together for them?


Many thanks,

Duncan

Sounds great - and much appreciated! My advice would be to open the
pull request whenever you're ready. Then we can look over whatever
you've got already and make suggestions from there. Sometimes if
you're unsure it's better to open a request early, just to get
feedback on whether you're taking the right approach before sinking
too much work into it.

I'm sure you'll find the QGIS community welcoming to new contributions
and always happy to help out new developers. I'm also willing to help
mentor/guide new contributors through changes if they relate to an
area of the code I'm confident in. Just ask if you get stuck.

No, just open when you're ready. The CI testing (Travis) will kick in
and run over you're changes to verify that there's no regressions or
code issues. With any luck you'll get a green light straight away, and
if not someone will let you know what's gone wrong.

New tests are always very welcome! Again, ping if you need any
guidance on our testing infrastructure.

Well, as long as old projects can still be opened with your
modifications and if the end user is not lost by the changes, I tend
to say that you can make your PR. After all, this is not a (in my
humble opinion) a critical feature of QGIS.

You can send a summary of your changes to the dev list if you want
(with a picture of the new dialog box).

Thanks for the info Nyall.

I'll get the pull request setup and see what comes back.

I've had a look at the test writing guidance on the site and have a rough idea of what to do, so I'll start getting them sorted while I wait for feedback on the pull request. If I get stuck I'll let you know.


Thanks again,

Duncan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cross heap contamination with OSGEO4W64
Message-ID: <CAGZJC2S7j=tEm4LV=zJct09Jp3O1NbXhCCCvvUMssEPD8Q-xQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am experiencing cross heap contamination with OSGEO4W64. The issue causes
apps using QgsApplication to crash unless the application is built with VS
2010 in Release configuration.
I have tried VS 2008, VS 2013, and VS 2010. Only Release mode in VS 2010
will run without crash.
Debug mode in VS 2010 will also crash, and the application cannot be
debugged.
In specific, I am experiencing the crash when destructing the QList
returned by QgsMapToolIdentify::identify, it crashes in
QList::node_destruct when the result goes off the stack.

I believe the issue stems from providing QT built with VS 2010, and also
not providing debug versions of qgis_core and QT.
I am not exactly sure why the issue occurs in release versions other than
those built with VS 2010, we can probably blame MS for that ;)

Anyway, I would like to resolve this issue so I can continue to use the
QGIS API for this project, but the only way out I see is to rebuild
everything in QGIS in VS 2013. Or hoping that someone on this list has a
simpler solution. OSGEO4W64 can not be used as many of the dependencies use
the C runtimes from VS 2010.

Has anyone else experienced this, and can provide insight?  Or am I the
only one using OSGEO4W64 and VS 2013?

Thanks,
-Stu

Message-ID: <CAJvo+1_mHfzE=RDw0+s2jgMO+5a1-0bDCt6LWkcKr=F=q++Uxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I add a virtual field to a layer with e.g. following expression

attribute(get_feature('pnf_pnf','t_id',afrom),'year')

This works really great. Then I'm using this new virtual field for
filtering the features in the rule based renderer. How does affect this the
rendering performance? It seems that it really slows down rendering even
with layers with only approx 600 features each.

If so, can the speed improved with e.g. some to develop caching mechanism?

regards
Stefan

Hi Médéric,

Sorry, I saw Nyall's reply and somehow missed yours.

The pull request is in...and passed the CI which is nice.

I've attached a screen shot of the UI changes.

I, like you, don't think this is exactly a critical feature, but nice to 
have. I don't think it breaks any old projects. Well none that I tried 
anyway.

The changes just include:
- Updates to the dialog as shown in attachment.
- A couple of new signal/slots to activate/deactivate the percentage 
placement inputs.
- Additional member variables in each class to hold values from 
checkbox, horizontal, and vertical inputs.
- A few lines of additional code in the render() function of the classes 
to locate the item.

I've started having a look at the tests and will issue a separate pull 
for them.


Thanks,

Duncan

Try with the current master version - this should be MUCH faster now. I'd
love to hear any feedback of how you find the changes improve (or don't
improve!) your situation.

Hi Nyall

I compared 2.12 with current master. But I don't see an improvement.
Opening the attribute table takes around 10 seconds for layers with approx.
2000 features with one virtual field (with the attribute(get_feature())
expression). Rendering is also really slow when using rule based renderer
on the virtual field.

regards
Stefan

Why not using joined fields ? Caching mechanism already exists there.

What's the data source for each layer? If it's in a database (eg
postgres), is there a suitable index on the joined field?

Thanks for the hint. This works perfect. But: the main idea was to avoid
creating "new" fields in the layer (virtual fields or joined ones) but only
using the expression for rendering.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future of OpenLayers plugin - time to deprecate?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashe3uN9Egi=1oGt8kb5Je_1sR25GLttC9e2Ah2f0GC_5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The email chain below is just one example of a user who has issues
with QGIS after installing the OpenLayers plugin. Stackexchange is
filled with similar examples (See
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qgis-openlayers-plugin).

I'm wondering if it's time we discussed the future of this plugin. Now
that we have a viable replacement (Quick Map Services) which doesn't
demonstrate these issues, should we deprecate the OpenLayers plugin
and remove it from the plugin repo?

Nyall

Sorry, previously posted response under wrong subject:

Thank you.   I have been doing some additional testing, it appears to
relate to having a few maps on the canvas that use the Open Street Map
underlay.  The behavior is pretty much as noted in the referenced issue.

Even with a single OSM underlay, while I do get an export, the
underlay is not complete, i.e. jagged edges where some tiles are missing in
the exported png, even though they do appear on the map.

I will try QuickMapServices.plugin.

Thanks.

Dick

Two postgres layers with an index on the fields.

Do I see some debug messages (when compiled with DEBUG)?

I think deprecation and removal would be good, but for a tangential reason:
the name conflicts with OpenLayers the web mapping library. A trivial reason
at best, but probably irritating to many, and potentially confusing to
users.

Use RelWithDebInfo in VS 2010 if you want to debug.

Yes, the C++ ABI of different VC compilers is incompatible.  So when using C++
APIs (like QGIS and Qt) you're tied to using the same compiler version.

If the plugin is deprecated, what is replacing it? I find the plugin to be very useful.

QuickMapServices. It's got numerous improvements over OpenLayers,
including reprojection support and not breaking the map composer.

As a non-developer if I can chip in my .02 cents worth - I think 
deprecating it might be a good thing. To me it was always a plugin that 
received a lot of applause - but the one that would cause the most 
questions ("why can't I use this imagery in map composer"). While I 
liked having access to google/bing imagery - it always made me more 
uncomfortable having it there because of the terms of service.

I didn't know that QuickMapServices was a plugin - and after looking at 
it I think most people will have a problem because there is no 
google/bing imagery in that one. In the US I have enough choices for 
imagery - and that might not be the case everywhere else. I'm unsure how 
up to date MapQuest Aerial is - but better than nothing.

Possibly add a pop-up/warning on the open layers plugin since it is 
popular - "We are in the process of deprecating this plugin".

Other than that - +1 for retirement.

Randy

I got caught on that one.
In QuickMapServices>Settings there is a "Contributed Services" tile.
Select "Get Contributed Services" and a whole lot of stuff, including
Bing and Google are provided.

To me QMS makes "Open layers" obsolete - but it needs a bit more
documentation on how to get Bing etc!!!

On principle I am against retirement, but am not aware of a strong
argument against it for Open Layers.  (Something I have used and valued
for quite some time..)

Deprecating it makes sense to me, unless authors plan to fix the long standing issues.
Thanks for raising this.
All the best.

For few features visible in the mapcanvas it is fast. But really slows down
when zooming out. I checked the "execute expression on server side option".
With this enabled I would assume that qgspostgresfeatureiterator.cpp would
fetch only 1 feature if there is only 1 feature visible in the mapcanvas
(according with the filter/expression)? But it alwas fetches all possible
features in the map canvas (two in my case).

As far as I understand: for every feature of the layer intersecting the map
canvas there is a openCursor and closeCursor command. Without the
expression you only have one openCursor and closeCursor command for the
layer. Don't know if this is necessary but it seems to slow it down.

+1 for deprecating.
I think the "popularity" of OpenLayers only derives from the fact that it  
was the only plugin available serving basemaps for a long time and that it  
is mentioned all around the web in tutorials etc.
Most of my collegues with less experience frequently step into the traps  
and digitize stuff only to find later that the result is shifted or the  
map is not printable.

I skipped it already a long time ago and tried to compensate it by finding  
other sources like WMS etc which is not so easy over here in Germany  
(especially since the built-in WMS Server Search results are completely  
outdated for a long time).

Since the QuickMapServices plugin is there, I always recommend that.
If this plugin would become the "successor" of OpenLayers, it would be  
nice to know why those most popular sources like Bing etc are "hidden" in  
the contributed services. Legal issues?

I already proposed to the developers to rename their plugin to "Basemaps",  
cause thats what it is actually about and which is a lot easier to  
understand and memorize.

Cheers
Bernd

+1, random thoughts:
1/ would be good to work with the openlayers dev to figure out a way to
inform current users that this better alternative is taking over
2/ the name of the plugin that would supersede openlayers isn't that great
(both in terms of indicating it is an alternative to openlayers, and more
generally to indicate what it does); if the authors are open to renaming,
it'd be great. BaseLayers? OpenLayersPlus? ;)

So I started playing with this even more and didn't realize some image 
services were hidden (thanks Bernd)....and I just made a map with a 
Google Satellite background and it's not shifted.

My only other contribution to the discussion would be to clear up why 
those services are hidden as you wouldn't want to replace one well known 
plugin with something that could cause people headaches. I'm completely 
lost on that side of life. I've never completely understood how 
openLayers could access Google imagery since everything seems to require 
some developer 'magic'. I always limited my use of it because I didn't 
understand legally why it worked.

I think Basemaps would be a good alternate name for this - since that's 
the entire plugin's 'reason for being' - providing basemaps.

Anyway,

Randy

p.s. Thank you developers for a great year with QGIS.
