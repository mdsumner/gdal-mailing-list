Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 0.9.1
Message-ID: <d368056f0801020351y769ae32amb1e8f52f8cacadb8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

QGIS 0.9.1 was tagged in the code base a little while ago and new
packages have been brewed:

http://gisalaska.com/qgis/downloads.rhtml

Ubuntu (gutsy) users can now enjoy automatic updates using the Gutsy
QGIS package repository.

This is primarily a bug fix release and includes the following key changes:

 - 70 Bugs closed
 - Added locale tab to options dialog so that locale can be overridden
 - Cleanups and additions to GRASS tools
 - Python Plugin Installer for installing plugins from the PyQGIS repository
 - Documentation updates
 - Improvements for building under MSVC

Many thanks to all those who have contributed in testing, reporting
bugs, coding, packaging etc. Best regards for the new year from the
QGIS team!

I tested the patch on Mac and Windows as well and it seems to work fine. I 
therefore commited the patch to trunk.

Developers, please test the incremental screen update too and report problems 
to the bugtrackers.

cheers,
Marco

Hi Martin,

I updated today the sip files qgsvectorlayer.sip, qgsgeometry.sip and 
qgsrubberband.sip, but I don't know if all the functions are python-correct.

Also, there are the new classes core/QgsSnapper and gui/QgsMapCanvasSnapper 
which do not have a python interface.

cheers,
Marco

Hi

Yes you have multiple copies of qgis installed.

1) Does explicitly running /usr/bin/qgis work correctly?

2) Please show me the result of:

dpkg -l | grep qgis

I think these issues should be dealt with in a more stable way.
Currently, our debian.gfoss.it repo is an effort of Niccolo from our
GFOSS.it community. A more stable solution could be to have a real repo,
or using the true debian infrastructure, setting up frequent
experimental packages.
It would thus be possible to have packages also for different branches,
from current svn, etc.
Of course the same would apply for grass and other packages. Any chance
of having osgeo involved in this?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Need a little help again with Python bindings
Message-ID: <4781A046.1010005@amnh.org>

Martin,

When you get a change can you take a look at the SIP files in the raster 
transparency branch? I have been trying to keep them up-to-date and 
adding new SIP files where necessary, but it seems I have run into a 
snag. All the SIP file that I have been modifying (qgsrasterlayer.sip) 
or adding correspond to file in /src/core/raster/

Everything compiles without error, but the bindings will not load when 
QGIS starts. I am sure it is something very simple, but I am a 
python/SIP idiot. The problem seems to be centered around the 
QgsRasterShader class. If I comment out the rastershader class in the 
core.sip file and a corresponding line in the qgsrasterlayer.sip file, 
everything compiles and at least loads. Uncomment it, and it compiles 
with out errors but fails to load at runtime.  I have even gone as far 
as to comment out all functions/methods in the qgsrastershader.sip file 
and it  compiles but still does not load. ldd does report many undefined 
symbols but most seems nonsensical, as they are common functions/methods 
in the core.

Again, I am sure it is something very simple. If you can commit to the 
branch, feel free to do so, otherwise send me a patch and I will apply 
the fixes.

Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Branch conflict
Message-ID: <4781D903.8070009@homann.se>

It seems there will be some serious conflict between branches 'renderer' 
and 'composer_redesign' when/if a merger to trunk is done.

The render branch is Tim and myself fixing the render GUI and adding 
rotation and scaling to the renderers. In the 'composer_redesign' branch 
Steven seems to also heaviliy modify the render component.

I'm a bit worried some of these changes will be lost when the branches 
are merged. How can this situation best be resolved?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis/Rpy Windows problem
Message-ID: <4781E8E0.7050609@lancaster.ac.uk>

Could anyone using Qgis with the R statistics package via Rpy on Windows 
XP give me some help here?

I've had this working before, but with my own compiled-from-source Qgis. 
Recently I decided I'd try and get it working from distributed binaries 
for simplicity's sake.

So, I'm using:

  Qgis 0.9.1
  Python 2.5
  R 2.6
  Rpy 1.01 for R 2.6
  Other Rpy dependencies: numpy, pywin32

all from .exe or .msi files obtained from the respective web sites.

  Rpy works fine from a python shell started from the Start Menu. But 
when I run it from a Qgis Python console then R gives errors on reading 
its RConsole config file (in RHOME/etc/RConsole).

  The errors are on any blank lines and four of the config options. 
Remove blank lines and those four options, and it all works.

  This is very odd. The code in R that reads RConsole and generates the 
error seems to be purely file ops and string ops. I first thought it was 
some environment setting like language or encoding but it all looks the 
same from a Windows python console and a QGIS python console.

  So, if anyone out there has this combination working on Windows could 
you please let me know what versions of the software you've got, and 
whether they were installed from binaries or compiled yourself. If 
anyone has any idea why this might happen then that would be even mroe 
helpful. Also if anyone with a Windows box wants to try and duplicate 
this bug that would be handy too. At the moment I've had it fail on my 
Windows box and a clean Windows XP install on a Virtual Box machine.

  I'm also discussing this with the Rpy guys and the R devs too...

  *sigh*

Hi Magnus, Tim, Steven,

A solution could be that you merge the two branches into one and work in the same branch then. Like this you detect code conflicts and/or possibilities for collaboration earlier. 
A disadvantage however could be that one new feature could be ready for merge with trunk before the second one is. In this case, the merge of feature one would be delayed.
In any case, you should keep each other up to date about your current work to avoid duplication of efforts. 
  
Best regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Branch conflict
 
It seems there will be some serious conflict between branches 'renderer' 
and 'composer_redesign' when/if a merger to trunk is done.

The render branch is Tim and myself fixing the render GUI and adding 
rotation and scaling to the renderers. In the 'composer_redesign' branch 
Steven seems to also heaviliy modify the render component.

I'm a bit worried some of these changes will be lost when the branches 
are merged. How can this situation best be resolved?

Hi

In regard to this we should also have a wiki page for each branch
explaining its purpose. I added an index page for branches to the wiki
and also a link to that on the front page in the developer section.

Hi Tim,

that is caused by the change I've made to allow creating universal
builds on mac os x. What version of SIP do you have? Now when looking
at the sources of SIP 4.5 I see there's no support for universal
builds, however in 4.7 there is - therefore upgrading to newer version
should help.

Regards
Martin

Hi Magnus,

sorry for delayed response...
Thanks for doing this, I'm the one to blame for those changes in
project files. I think so far we have the policy that project files
from older versions of QGIS are not necessarily supported, but since
we're heading to 1.0 it's good to have this mechanism.

Once I will have some more spare time again I'll look into it to see
whether there are any more parts which should be transformed.

Regards
Martin

Martin et al

  I submitted a trac bug report for what is probably the same issue.

  When the python code tries to unzip the files from the zip, it fails 
if the top-level folder isn't an item in the zip. At least on Windows 
anyway.

  See the trac bug for details. The fix is to check the paths for '/' 
and create directories that way. Not yet implemented...

I have the same problem in Windows also for Copyrigth plugin.

But I see an other problem about Python plugins in Windows.

If I load a plugin (for example "ghydraulic") from "Python plugin
manager", the plugin directory is saved in C:\Documents and
Settings\leo\.qgis\python\plugins.
If then I open th Plugin Manager, QGIS say:
Couldn't load plugin "ghydraulic"

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "", line 3, in
ImportError: No module named ghydraulic

and yhe plugin is not present in the plugin manager list.

If I copy or shift the ghydraulic plugin directory from C:\Documents and
Settings\leo\.qgis\python\plugins to
C:\Programmi\Quantum_GIS\python\plugins
all work rigth.

PS: Martin, this also for ARPAT plugin!

Leonardo

Hi

Sorry if I ever replied to your last email  - I lost track of where I
was in the conversation thread :-)

Ok so an oooolder deb on your system may explain it because the newer
ones all install to /usr not /usr/local.

Did you ever build yourself from source? Either way you will need to
clear out the qgis files from your /usr/local tree. I think if you do:

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/*qgis*
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/qgis
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/*qgis*
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/qgis

You should get it all removed. Please note the above commands perform
wildcard and recursive deletes on your system as root. Please check
carefully before you issue them and I dont take any responsibility if
something bad happens.

Regards

Tim

Hi Pete,

I've took a look at it, the problem was in missing body of destructor
for QgsRasterShader. It seems that gcc handles this situation
gracefully without any warnings, however binding was not able to
encounter symbol for the destructor. I've commited fix for it in
r7864.

Hi Shota

My apologies for the delayed response ... sometimes we get busy and
need a gentle poke :-) I've added a new section to the translators
corner page which will hopefully help you get started to create your
.ts file:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner#head-533b46f169d3327affab555052414fa1367491db

Please update your svn checkout before following those instructions
since I only added the create_new_ts script to svn today. Please
contact me if you have any further queries.

Regards

Tim

Barry,

I guess you mean this ticket:
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/890

I've tested Gary's recent fix for that and with it installs plugins correctly.

I've come across this problem now too. There's a small bug which is
causing this, I've fixed it now (r7867) so it will be fixed in 0.9.2.
But for 0.9.1 the only workaround is to copy the plugins to the
python/plugins directory inside QGIS.

I must have at one point though 7.4 is pretty old, which seems to be
the version of the old qgis (the dates were September of 2007 which
would have been 9.0 at the time).

This worked. The third command

had to be changed to

Hi Marco:

I was looking into your patch for postgis dialog and I noticed that in qgsdbsourceselectbase.ui 
the encoding combobox is missing. It wont be used anymore?

Hi qgis devs,

The 10th January and with it the feature freeze for 0.9.2 is approaching fast. If there are no objections I'm going to merge the advanced editing branch tomorrow (9.1.).
@Peter ok for you to merge the raster transparency branch before feature freeze, maybe on 10th of January? If you don't have time those days I may do the merge if you prefer.

Best regards,
Marco

Hi Godofredo,

Afaik the encoding combobox is not used for postgis layers in qgis anymore, only for ogr layers. The postgis provider sets client encoding to unicode:

(qgspostgresprovider.cpp, l. 260)
//set client encoding to unicode because QString uses UTF-8 anyway
  QgsDebugMsg("setting client encoding to UNICODE");

  int errcode=PQsetClientEncoding(pd, "UNICODE");

That's why I removed the gui element. But know that I'm thinking about it, you probably need the encoding combo box for loading database layers with ogr? If yes then I'm gonna add the combo box to the code in the patch.

Btw did other developers or users look at the patch too? You know, feature freeze on 10th of January, and it would be really cool to include the patch for 0.9.2...

Best regards,
Marco

Hi All

+1 for digitising branch merge.

And Magnus and I will be merging the renderer branch (which includes
qml support and symbol rotation and scaling support) if there are no
objections.

I have also written a quick print plugin - the idea is that it uses a
predefined template (and in the future a selection of predefined
templates) to quickly produce a pdf of the current map (with legend
and scale bar etc), Does anyone have any objections to me merging this
in to trunk? The plugin is not designed to overlap the more flexible
map composer work of Steven Bell, but rather provide a solution for
the 'click and print' crowd. Its probably not the most awe inspiring
example but you can get an idea here:

I will be working with your patch today and tomorrow to adapt it to ogr-branch. Here are some
problems I found when compiling in windows:

CORE_EXPORT macro is missing in qgsdbfilterproxymodel.h and
and in qgsdbtablemodel.h for being able to link in windows.

Regarding to encoding combobox I haven?t used it  with ogr but not
sure if it will be needed .

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Clipping symbols
Message-ID: <4783EEB4.6070206@homann.se>

In the rendering branch I'm trying to fix clipping of hard symbols 
(#705). Much of the confusion comes from the fact the pointSize does not 
determine a rectangular boundigbox, but instead specifies an area.

So, for a hard marker with pointSize=10, the area should be the same 
between circel, rectangle, diamond and triangle, with the circle as the 
determining symbol.

The interesting thing happens when you specifiy a diamond fitting into a 
10x10 box, and with the same areas as a circle with radius=5. Not so 
easy withou clipping!

And then there is the line width... :-)

Can we all agree that instead a symbol with pointSize=10 should render a 
circle with radius=5, a rectangel with side=10, a diamond with 
*diagonal*=10 and a triangle with base and height=10. They will then all 
have different areas.

The numbers above are including line width, so there will be no exact 
area scale.

(Hmm, I got a deja vu writing this. Tim, did we discuss this a couple of 
years back? Creepy...)

Hi

Sounds good to me. I think the important things are that:

a) the fixed symbols all appear simlar sized relative to each other
b) they apear similar in size relative to svg symbols of the same size

It will be great if you can fix those clipping issues!

have different areas.
I would vote for that.  When you specify a size in pixels, millimeters, or
map units, you expect the symbol to be that size, not some area-equivalent
size.  Note that an equilateral triangle (if that's what the symbol is meant
to be) will have a base of 10 and a height less than 10.  On a similar note,
some of the svg point symbols should be modified to fill the entire svg
canvas.

I don't have permission to merge into the trunk, so it will have to be 
someone else.

If it has not been done already, I would like the steering committee to 
review the branch just to make sure everything is on par with the coding 
standards and that everything expected as been completed. Looking over 
the wiki, I do see one thing that may influence the merge; all of the 
raster properties are not yet committed to the project file.

have time to address that by the 10th?

Tim,

As we spoke about on irc, if I stick with putting all of the properties 
code into the QgsRasterLayer, then I should be able to get that done on 
the 9th.  If the devs would rather see each class have their own 
read/writeXML function (which they eventually should), I will need 
another couple of days, but think I could have that done (properly) by 
the end of the weekend.

As for the merge, it should be quite easy as there are no other branches 
(that I know of) trying to adjust the various raster classes that I have 
been working on.

Hi Gavin,

I cannot find this mail in my mailbox or in the developer list archives. I 
somehow must have overlooked it in the tons of mails over new years days. 
Sorry for that, could you resend the mail?

Hi Tim,

+1 for merging the renderer branch. I already used the patch for qml support 
and it worked perfectly.

I'm looking forward for all the new features in 0.9.2 :-)

cheers,
Marco

Hi Folks

Here is the plugin for making quick prints (actually it makes pdfs)
that I would like to add to svn in time for the feature freeze.

Ill await general go-ahead before adding it to svn.

Hi All

In the absence of any objections, Ill be committing my quick print
plugins to trunk. The changes are all localised to the new plugins so
we can easily remove it again if anyone has substantial objections.
The plugin seeks to cater for users who want to print a map with no
hassle, and does not seek to replace the mapcomposer plugin which is
aimed at advanced users. Since I hate wasting paper / cutting down
trees, I have made the quick print plugin output to pdf for digital
redistribution or optionally printing from pdf.

Features;
 - fill in 3 fields, choose a pdf output file and get a pdf ready for printing
 - field values are remembered between uses so in most cases you
simply click the plugin icon then press OK
 - automatically scales label text and symbol sizes suitable for
printing and then scales them down again afterwards
 - at the moment all options (page size Letter, output pdf, layout)
are fixed as I prefer to keep it extremely simple in this iteration.
 - 300dpi output

Future options:

 - In the future it will be possible to refactor the plugin to support
simpled predefined layouts at different page sizes.
- autoincrementing filenames for when you want to produce a sequence of maps

Screenshots:

Hi Tim.
Very nice idea, looking forward to test it. One note: as you know, here
in Europe we use A[0-5] paper size: any chance of having it as a default
(or option)? Or do you think the printout can equally well fit into an A4?
All the best.

I thought I had sent this out earlier, but realized I hadn't...
I've committed my symbol rendering code changes into the composer_redesign
branch.  The major change is that point symbols are no longer drawn as
pixmaps on the canvas (which I think has been done in the renderer branch,
although probably in a different way).  This also happens to fix the
clipping issues.  I've added a new type of symbol size: "map units".  I have
not added paper units or map scale units yet, but those are basically
constant-scaled variations on the current two.
The new system only works with the point symbols and the single symbol
renderer.  It has quite a ways to go, but I figured I would get others'
thoughts and input sooner rather than later.  Let me know if I'm heading in
the right direction and if/when I should merge with the renderer branch.

Hi

Orignally I wrote it for A4 but certain USA folks complained that they
use Letter :-) Ive committed the plugin to trunk so if you could test
to see if it prints ok that would be great. Since it prints to pdf,
most pdf viewers have a 'fit to page' option you can use before
printing so hopefully it will not be a problem.

Regards

Tim

Steven,

How has this affected rendering speed for normal rendering. Are you 
still caching?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Open source API to convert raster to polygons?
Message-ID: <4784E4F8.70409@tdwg.org>

    Hi all,
   
    Does anyone know of any open source geoprocessing APIs that I can 
use to convert raster maps into polygons (as a shapefile or SQL for 
PostGIS)? Does QGIS do that?

    I know that GDAL (via gdal_contour utility) can turn a raster into 
lines, but that's not good enough for me. I need closed polygons that I 
later intend to import into PostGIS. Gdal_contour would give usable 
intermediate results (i.e, it produces lines that I think can be turned 
into closed polygons), if it wasn't for the open polygons that are 
created where the grid values touch NODATA values.

    I have considered using GRASS (r.poly) but I need to embed the 
geoprocessing library on an research application that I will deploy to 
Windows desktop computers. To be completely honest, I can't even 
install  GRASS on my Windows workstation, so I have no hopes of 
deploying it via a neat installer :(( . That's probably due to the lack 
of intelligence and patience, and is another story.

    Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

    Cheers,

Ricardo Pereira
Software Engineer and GIS Application Developer

No, there is no caching going on, so it is probably slower than the original
code.  However, I suspect it is somewhat faster than the current
implementation in the renderer branch, since it doesn't draw on an image,
and then draw that image onto the paint canvas.  The painter is passed
directly to the code that draws the symbol.
I'm curious how the speed of painting an image compares with the speed for
painting a circle, square, etc.  It seems to me that painting primitives
might be faster than painting an image, but that needs to be tested.
If someone can send me a large point set, I will try to test the speed of
these different implementations.
Steven


I don't have a large point dataset to test it with at the moment.

Hi Marco

Congratulations on being the first to get your branch merged in for
the feature freeze :-) I get the following when trying to build on mac
with python bindings:

sipguiQgsRubberBand.cpp: In function 'PyObject*

Peter Ersts reported similar issue on IRC (running Linux I think).

Hi Tim,

Is that after the latest merge commit?
For me, it compiles but python bindings don't load when starting qgis. I tried 
to use the python console to find out why (as described in 
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings), but didn't succeed. What is 
the PYTHONPATH I have to set? <qgisprefix>/python ?

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] extensions to postgis dialog
Message-ID: <20080110092709.AAR06957@msgsrv2.mail.isx.net.nz>

Marco,

It probably went only to your email address. Unfortunately I didn't keep a copy. 

>From memory my suggestions were that the new column for 'schema' was unnecessary as it always just contained the schema name (and which was also given in the node of each branch). I would suggest removing the schema column.

When there are just a few spatial tables, but in more than one schema, the current implementation has the tree un-expanded. Perhaps if there are less than, say, 20 tables, the tree should be automatically expanded.

I couldn't get the search facility to work - there is no 'do the search' button, and pressing enter just activated the 'close' button.

Otherwise I think it looks good and works well.

Regards

Gavin

If you comment out 248, you get an error that QgsSnappingResult is not 
defined, it will need a SIP file as well.

Don't know if that helps.

Hi all,

I've fixed the compilation problems in r7893. Later I'll take a look
wheter the bindings also behave correctly and whether they need some
additional SIP annotations.

Marco: you should set PYTHONPATH variable to the directory where are
the installed bindings, i.e. QGIS_PREFIX/share/qgis/python on
linux/mac.

Regards
Martin

Hi Gavin,

Thanks for looking into this and for the suggestions.

>When there are just a few spatial tables, but in more than one schema, the current implementation has the tree un-expanded. Perhaps if there >are less than, say, 20 tables, the tree should be automatically expanded.

I like this idea and plan to implement it tomorrow. Users with only a few tables will not like to click on the schema nodes each time they load a table.

>I couldn't get the search facility to work - there is no 'do the search' button, and pressing enter just activated the 'close' button.

Oh, that means the search facility did not work for you at all. The search should be performed each time a new character is typed into the line edit. So when a user types in a keyword, he gets a closer subset of tables that match the wildcard/regexp (similar to index -> search in qt assistant). Is this feature working for you?
And I plan to deactivate the enter button for this dialog. 

>From memory my suggestions were that the new column for 'schema' was unnecessary as it always just contained the schema name (and which was >also given in the node of each branch). I would suggest removing the schema column. 

Hm, but if someone has e.g. 100 tables in one schema and the schema branch is expanded, it may not be very convenient to scroll upwards just to look what the schema name was. Maybe when it is in trunk we get more opinions from users and if people don't like it, I will remove the schema column.   

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

It probably went only to your email address. Unfortunately I didn't keep a copy. 

>From memory my suggestions were that the new column for 'schema' was unnecessary as it always just contained the schema name (and which was also given in the node of each branch). I would suggest removing the schema column.

When there are just a few spatial tables, but in more than one schema, the current implementation has the tree un-expanded. Perhaps if there are less than, say, 20 tables, the tree should be automatically expanded.

I couldn't get the search facility to work - there is no 'do the search' button, and pressing enter just activated the 'close' button.

Otherwise I think it looks good and works well.

Regards

Gavin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Render speed
Message-ID: <478550A0.1040003@homann.se>

I did a VERY unscientific test, rendering a 200 x 200 and a 300 x 300
points shape file in trunk, renderer branch and composer_redesign
branch. The points were autogenerated from a C-program to a delimited
text file and then saved as shape file. All branches were compiled with
debugging off.

Using circles with size around 20, in renderer branch larger.

Result:

branch          layer    sec
----------------------------
trunk           200x200      4
trunk           300x300      8
render          200x200      7
render          300x300      13
composer        200x200      16
composer        300x300      32

The delimited text files (gzipped) for those interested are stored at 
links below. It would be good if anyone could confirm the discrepancies.

Marco,

I'll have a look at the search again tonight to see if it actually works for me.

Fair comment about the schema column - some more opinion on it would be good. For 95% of my uses, the column is not required (everything is in a couple of schema) and it just takes up extra column space that would be more useful in the SQL column.

Regards

Gavin

Hi

I cant remember who I was chatting to on IRC but I was going to
suggest that 0.9.3 we focus our attention on perfrmance only (kind of
like a performance triage!). Its definately an often mentioned
complaint and we should really be striving to get QGIS faster with
each release...particulary once we have all features implemented for
1.0.

Message-ID: <681d07c20801091841m575d8e3ao1a2155dbae26c0e7@mail.gmail.com>

Dear qgis devs,

I haven't been able to keep up with the list lately or build form
source - sorry if this has already been addressed.

Using the most recent ubuntu gutsy release of qgis (0.9.1), I get the
following replicable bug:

Adding postgis point and line layers works.  When I save the project
and reopen, everything reloads fine.

When I modify any display property of a postgis layer such as symbol
color or label, save the project, and reopen the project, then i get
the following error box with ok and cancel buttons.  Clicking either
button does not affect the outcome.

"Unable to open one or more project layers
Try to find missing layers?"

Once open, the modified layer is missing but all other layers load properly.

In the terminal, the only difference i can see between runs is:

bad run:
Warning: QPainter::end: Painter not active, aborted
row number 0 is out of range 0..-1
row number 0 is out of range 0..-1
row number 0 is out of range 0..-1

good run:

hope this helps!

My 'branch' handling reading older project files is ready for merging. 
Small branch, changes basivally limimted to core/qgsproject.cpp and adds
some files to that. After mergin, all developers that have made changes 
in project file layout can starta thinking of how to handle old project 
files.

If no objections, I will merge tonight (in about 12 hours). It should be 
easily reversible if need be.

Hi,

I couldn't agree more. Performance is a very critical aspect for any GIS and I 
like the idea of a performance triage for 0.9.3 very much.

Usually difficult is how to measure performance. Maybe we could publish some 
free benchmark datasets on the qgis website and put a timer into qgis code 
that outputs the rendering time on console. Then someone that does a 
performance improvement may communicate the rendering times for the benchmark 
datasets with/without improvement.

One point that is also important in the context of performance is to have a 
responsive application. A long program action is more likely to be tolerated 
by a user if there is feedback about the progress and if users have the 
possibility to cancel that operation.

So I can imagine quite some actions to improve performance/responsiveness 
(some of them located in feature dream land of course :-) )

- possibility to cancel long rendering operations (as described by Martin)
- a faster attribute table based on model/view (as described by Tim)
- caching of WMS tiles for fast panning actions by WMS provider
- parallel rendering of layers on multicore processors
- on-the-fly generalisation of complex geometries (only upon user request!)

I'm sure there are a lot more...

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <20080110211643.AAR49061@msgsrv2.mail.isx.net.nz>

Marco,

Yes, searching isn't working. I've had a look at the code and as far as I can see it's working fine. If I replace the line:

 return QSortFilterProxyModel::filterAcceptsRow(row, source_parent)

in QgsDbFilterProxyModel with 'return false', no tables show as expect, so it looks like the filters aren't getting used. I assume that typing 'a' in the filter box should just show rows that have an 'a' in them?

Anything that I could try to debug the problem?

I'm using Qt 4.2.3 under linux (suse 10.2).

Regards

Gavin

Good idea, I was thinking about using the test framework that we have
for running performance test. With the same computer system, the numbers
should be relevant before/after.

I propose Tim look into this after we got 0.9.2 out, start by
implementing tests that show the weakness *before* we do any changes.

Indeed, caching should be done for all backends, GML is very slow, and others 
could see a performance boost too, acording to previous discussions. Not 
volunteering right now, though ;)

Hi

Other things we could to the list (though they may be out there in
dreamland...):

 - prevent unneccessary rerendering of a scene by using composition
management (no idea if this is viable with QGraphicsScene though)
 - prerendering off screen areas in a background thread
 - composit each layer to screen as it is rendered
 - go trough all rendering loops and move as much if..then...foo logic
to outside of the loop - for exmple pre-create all brushes and pens
before the loop and then just select the appropriate one from the
brushes and pens collection during render loops.
 - get people like Frank Warmerdam to review main render loops to see
if are accessing data in most efficient way possible

and my final tougue in cheek option:

 - dont permit canvas size greater then 100x100px and issue each user
with a large magnifying glass

About three years ago a colleague and I would regularly test render
performance of QGIS by comparing rendering the same datasets (vector
and raster) against ArcView and ArcMap on the same (dual boot
machine). QGIS did pretty well then with the exception of being slower
at rendering large vector scenes when zoomed out. This is a useful
metric to use since these apps are the standards against which many
users will measure how fast QGIIS is. I no longer have access to Arc*
apps but Im sure there are obliging users out there who can help.

I will be more than happy to write some benchmarking unit tests too..

Regards

Tim

    Sorry Joaquim,

    You are right. I haven't been precise enough.

    What I really need is some API or software library (preferably in C 
or C++) that I could use to convert ESRI Arc/Info Grids (the binary 
kind) to a Shapefile of polygons. If a library isn't available, a 
command line utility that I can call from C/C++ would suffice.

    I hope this clarify things a bit.

    Cheers,

Ricardo

  There's some raster-to-vector conversion tools, but I don't know any 
that produce shapefiles. However, if the output is in a sensible enough 
format then it should be easy to convert from that to shapefile.

Try these:

  http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/

  http://delineate.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html

  and see if they can successfully trace your rasters.

  Mostly these tools will smooth out the jagged edges of raster areas - 
is this what you want, or do you want your shapefiles to strictly follow 
the raster cell boundaries? That's a different problem altogether, and 
probably more easy to do...

I suggested this earlier by Martin said it wouldn't be possible if we want to 
keep the renderer without any dependencies on QtGui, so it can be used 
without an X server. Or maybe another layer could be added...

Hi Gavin,

I made some more tests: the problem is only if the search is done with all columns, as soon as I choose e.g search in 'Table' column, it works. The search in all columns work for me with Qt 4.3.2, but not with 4.2.2 and also not with 4.3. I suppose it is a bug in those Qt versions related to the function QSortFilterProxyModel::setFilterKeyColumn(int). This function should filter in all columns with -1 as argument, but it seems it only does so with 4.3.2.

As a workaround, I set the search to the 'Table' column only per default (can be changed with the combo box of course).

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

Yes, searching isn't working. I've had a look at the code and as far as I can see it's working fine. If I replace the line:

 return QSortFilterProxyModel::filterAcceptsRow(row, source_parent)

in QgsDbFilterProxyModel with 'return false', no tables show as expect, so it looks like the filters aren't getting used. I assume that typing 'a' in the filter box should just show rows that have an 'a' in them?

Anything that I could try to debug the problem?

I'm using Qt 4.2.3 under linux (suse 10.2).

Regards

Gavin

Hi Marco and others

Marco really great work on the digitising updates - its a huge
improvement! I have some suggestions to offer:

 - I would like to revise the digitising icons - they are not all
consistent and in retrospect that blue background I put behind icons
reduces contrast and makes it hard to visually separate one from the
other. I've made a quick mockup in the GIMP (attached). If folks are
happy with those as concept Ill do them more neatly (in particularly
anti-aliased) as svgs and then export to pngs. Any objections?

- The slow point for me in digitising now is atrribute data capture.
In particular working with keyboard or mouse involves extra clicks to
move between fiellds - when you capture a lot of data these all add up
to a chunk of time lost. I propose as a short term fix to make the
field names row headings rather than cell values to eliminate needing
to tab through field headings when jumping from cell to cell. In the
longer term I would like to change the ui to dynamically generate a
form with suitable widgets based on the data type being entered. Ill
come back to that in a future release though.

- the vertex marker cross hairs  are in my opinion too long and take
on the pen style of the layer which can look a bit strange at times.
As a short term fix I would like to suggest shortening the length of
the marker arms and use a standard red, 2px pen for rendering them. In
the longer term it might be nice to use little circles.

- we should aim to use a single icon for capturing point line or
polygon with its image being changed in accordance to the context of
the layer type being edited.

Once again, Its really nice work you have done, and the above comments
are just 'icing' rather than any major issue.

Regards

Tim

All,
The raster_transparency, rev-up, and advanced editing branches have  
been merged into trunk in anticipation of the 0.9.2 release.
These branches add a lot of new features that will be detailed later,  
but include things like stored symbology (qml), enhanced raster  
functions, new editing tools, a quick print, new mapserver exporter,  
and bunch of others enhancements and fixes.

Tim will likely officially announce the feature freeze tomorrow. With  
all the merging we need feed back so feel free to check out the latest  
from trunk and compile and test:

    svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis qgis_0_9_2


Thanks,

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your help. I also think that the digitising tools would benefit 
from some polishing.

+1. The new icons look good and I think they are clearer. E.g. the difference 
move features / move Vertex is clearer visible and also the meaning of 'add 
ring' and 'add island' operation is easier to get.

I don't understand what you mean with the short time fix. Do you mean to 
enable the possibility to jump from the end of a column to the beginning of 
the next with tab key?

Yes, a circle or maybe a square with transparent fill would be nice. I'm going 
to take a look at udig and jump to see what they use.

Also in my opinion, the digitising toolbar takes too much space. I'd like to 
use a dropdown list for the tools. So there would be only a button for 
start/stop editing and a dropdown list for the tools.

Marco

With Python I want to get all avalilable map layers from my current

layerCollection = QgsMapLayerRegistry().instance().mapLayers()

It doesn't work. I took a look into qgsmaplayerregistry.sip and found

to wrap this method. Does exists a workareound to retrieve all project

A nit. The renderer branch is also merged, which provides the stored 
symbology features.

A lot of new features. A lot of bugs will have to be fixed. :-)

Hi,

this function isn't wrapped so far because mapLayers() uses std::map
container which should be replaced with QMap instead. It's not a lot
of work, I'll do it probably soon.
Please note that theoretically QgsMapLayerRegistry can contain also
layers which are not part of the project (e.g. when using
georeferencer plugin it adds temporarily a layer to the registry).

In fact there is currently no way how to directly access all project's
layers correctly, since map canvas doesn't keep list of all layers
(only those which are visible) and it's not possible to access legend
from the plugin as it's not part of QGIS libraries :-/

One workaround would be to save the project and then use legend's
nodes to parse the list of layers, which is, well, quite inconvenient.
We should definitely do something with this. I guess for now wrapping
mapLayers() would do it...

Regards
Martin

Martin,

Thank you very much for your response. I think for my purposes
mapLayers() would be a good solution. So I'll wait for the wrapped
method.

You can get all the layers in the current map canvas from the console thus:

# get the map canvas
mc=iface.getMapCanvas()

# how many layers are there?
nLayers=mc.layerCount()

# loopage:

for l in range(nLayers):
   layer = mc.getZpos(l)
   doSomethingWith(layer)

  - is that good enough?

Well, it doesn't include hidden layers....

Look at the before and after screenies Im attaching. Im suggesting as
a short term fix to use the field names and row headers so the table
effectively has one column. This should require minimal code changes
and substantially increase productivity when navigating with the
keyboard using tab. I realise you can use use down and up arrows to
move between fields, but many people instinctively use tab for this
purpose which requires 2 keypresses eaach time.

There is a qt demo that uses semi transparent circles to let you move
nodes on a spline. Something similar would be really nice.

I dont think making it a drop down is a good idea. When digitising
those tools are frequently accessed and by moving them into a drop
list, we save space yes but we break Fitz' Law. Think about a typical
workflow:

 - enable layer editing (1 click)
 - choose line capture icon (1 click)
 - capture line (n clicks)
 - enter attributes (+1 click for ok)
 - save layer editing (1 click)
 - resume layer editing (1 click)

Even in that simple scenario where other digitising tools arent being
used it becomes this with a drop down icon toolbox:


 - enable layer editing (2 click)
 - choose line capture icon (2 click)
 - capture line (n clicks)
 - enter attributes (+1 click for ok)
 - save layer editing (2 click)
 - resume layer editing (2 click)

Perhaps worse than the number of clicks is the break in workflow as
you need to do the icon selection process. I think we can be more
smart about combining tools into single icons where they are mutually
exclusive and win toolbar space back that way rather.

Ah yes, this makes sense. I thought you were talking about the attribute table, not the attribute dialog. Therefore my confusion.

My suggestion was to have the toggle editing button outside of the dropdown list. Therefore, in your example, there would only be one additional click with the dropdown list (choose line capture icon (2 click)). The capture line button stays selected when toggling editing on/off.

But ok, in other situations where users change tools very often (e.g. alternate capture / vertex modifications), there will be more clicks. For those situations, a floating window could be nice. 

>I think we can be more

This is a good solution for the capturing icons, but that saves only two positions. Or are there other icons that could be removed like this? And the number of editing tools may still grow in future.

I had a look how other GIS handle the editing icons:

Jump: floating window
udig: dropdown list
arc gis: dropdown list

Marco

Message-ID: <d368056f0801110958m2faee77ctc09d5d6474cd0a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

The final merges and patches are in for the feature freeze as of today.

The next stop on our journey towards QGIS 0.9.2 is a ui and string
freeze as of 20 January 2008. Soif you need to change any strings or
fix bugs that require text changes, please get your commits in before
that date.

You can keep up to date with the release plans by following the
release checklist on the wiki.

Many many thanks for all those who have helped merging over the last
few days - i think (despite some minor hiccups with the merge) that
the process of doing all new developments off in branches is working
very well.

Could I ask the authors of the various branches and new features to
submit a few lines each to me outlining the new features that will
appear in QGIS 0.9.2 so that I can update teh whats new , change log
etc?

Have a good weekend all

Regards

Just to clarify: QGIS core library depends on QtGui (since that module
contains all the stuff like QPainter, QImage etc.) but it is designed
that it can run without a running X server.

Composition manager can be implemented in QGIS gui library and could
use QGraphicsView facilities. We can do it by drawing each layer to
another graphics view item (instead of drawing them all to one item).

Message-ID: <A66043FE-7E2A-43E3-8B0B-60B452E45AC9@mrcc.com>

I would like to propose an exemption to the feature freeze for 0.9.2.  
I have implemented map tips in a branch (see http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BranchesDirectory)

A map tip is a little pop-up snippet of text that appears when you  
hover the mouse over a feature. The code this is based on has been in- 
place and tested for two or three months in a side project using the  
QGIS libs so it's not like adding brand new code.

I wanted to get this in prior to freeze but missed it by a day. The  
implementation is pretty simple---in the branch took only a short  
time. Any objections to merging it into trunk?

In r7949 I added a 2.5% margin on all sides when zooming to layer 
extent. In my opinion, this looks nicer. It also closes an enchancement 
request.

Is this something that would break any existing funtionality, or is it 
bad form from a GUI perspective. If so, we can remove it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fopen using binary mode
Message-ID: <478B5C5E.2090803@lancaster.ac.uk>

I've discovered where my problem with Qgis-Python-R is coming from.

In main.cpp, Qgis sets the default mode for fopen in Windows to binary. 
This is inherited down to R which calls fopen(file,"r") to read one of 
its config files, which has Windows CR-LF endings. It fails to expect 
this, and falls over while parsing it.

  I don't know why Qgis sets this, since it violates the principle of 
least surprise. Does anyone know why? It could surprise plugin authors too.

  I'm happy to go through the source and check every fopen call...

Barry

Hi Marco (and anyone else interested)

I've more or less finished redoing the digitising icons:

Disabled:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2191818025/
Enabled:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2192605678/

I since discovered that features dont need to be selected first to
delete and move them so I will probably redo them. I also wanted to
suggest improving the logical grouping of the icons to:

Start / Stop editing
Capture points
Capture lines
Capture polys
Capture ring
Capture island
Move feature
Delete feature
Split feature
Cut
Copy
Paste
Add vertex
Move Vertex
Delete vertex


The rearrangement basically groups all feature based operations
together and all vertex based operations together. If folks approve of
that I can make the appropriate ordering changes.

Lastly, I wondered if the snapping distance in options panel can be
specified as a float rather since if you work in lat/long wgs84 as I
tend to do  the smallest snap distance I can have is 1 degree (which
is not very small).

Regards

Tim

Can this be integrated with the Information tool? The number of icons

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python plugin - layer intersection ?
Message-ID: <478C6FA7.4090400@laposte.net>

Hi list
I am playing with the python bindings.... I would like to know if we can 
use python to develop a layer intersection plugin.
For example, I have 2 shp layers :
* mypoly = polygon layer (id_poly, name, area, valuea, valueb, etc.)
* mypoint = point layer (id_point, name, value1, value2, etc.)

Is it possible with python to test for each point if it intersects one 
of the polygons, and then give a point layer like this:
myresult(id_result, id_point, id_poly, valuea, value2)
In this case, I keep the id of each source layer, and choose to keep 
also one value of each layer. Each new point has the same geometry of 
the source point

For those who know postgis, it would be a query like this
SELECT p1.id_poly, p1.valuea, p2.id_point, p2.value2, p2.the_geom
FROM mypoly p1, mypoint p2
WHERE INTERSECTS (p1.the_geom, p2.the_geom)

Thanks in advance for answers.

PS: I can use the geometric algorytm like this instead, but it would be 
useless if Qgis core has intersection capabilities:
*****
  # is target point inside a 2D polygon?
  #   poly = 2 dimenson list with all the coords of each polygon,
  #   x (horizontal)=  X of the point to test
  #   y (vertical) = Y of the point to test
  def inpoly( poly, xt,  yt):
    inside = False #valeur que retournera la fonction
    npoints = len(poly)  #calcul du nombre de lignes du tableau = nombre 
de sommets du polygone
    if (npoints < 3): #si il y a moins que 3 sommets, ce n'est pas un 
polygone --> on arrete
      return(0)
    xold=poly[npoints-1][0]
    yold=poly[npoints-1][1]

    for i in range(0,npoints):
      xnew=poly[i][0]
      ynew=poly[i][1]
      if (xnew > xold) :
        x1=xold
        x2=xnew
        y1=yold
        y2=ynew
      else :

Hi Martin

I want to create python bindings for QuickPrint class. I copied work
you did for other classes (see attached patch) and it all compiles
fine. Bearing in mind that Im a complete python noob how do I:

 -  confirm my class is available in the pythond bindings? I tried in
the python console to do like  qp = QgsQuickPrint but it gave an error
 -  is there something like Doxygen API that I can read the api docs for python
 - I looked through all the examples I could find and none of the
python stuff I saw seemed to make use of qgis classes directly - they
all seem to pull objects out of the iface object. Where can I find
better examples?

the quick print class *should* work something like this:

qp = QgsQuickPrint
qp.setMapCanvas ( iface.getMapCanvas() )
qp.setOutputPdf ("/tmp/test;pdf")
qp.setTitle ("QGIS Rocks")
qp.print()

Regards

Tim

Hi Martin

A bit more on this - I discovered my patch actually wasnt  compiling properly:

I saw in som of your wrapped classes you mentioned problems wih
inheriting QObject in python wrapped code - did you find a work around
for that?

Hi all.

I'm trying to program a kind of raster layer component using PyQGIS either
as a plugin or as a standalone application.  Which classes of QGIS API do
you recommend me to use?  Do you suggest me to use QgsColorTable in
conjunction with QgsRasterLayer to obtain the symbology of the raster layer
and display it in a QgsLegend?  Are there any other classes do I have to
know about for this purpose?  Aditionally, if you can direct me to a good
documentation resource to learning how to use PyQGIS (very
beginner-oriented) I would be very thankful to you.

That would be a good idea, but is it possible to do?

I recommend not staring translation until string freeze.

I know, thanks. I just wanted to get an idea of the amount of strings

Hi,

QGIS has some support for testing for instersetion:
QgsGeometry::intersects(other) returns if the two geometries
intersect.
So you can go through all features of the layers and test the
intersections and save them to another layer (use e.g.
QgsVectorFileWriter).
One performance note - if your layers are big it would be wise to load
one of the layers to spatial index (QgsSpatialIndex) as using it can
reduce significantly the time needed to check the intersection.

Hi,
I don't get what you mean by "raster layer component"...

However for anything related to rasters start with QgsRasterLayer
class and friends (all the raster-related classes are in qgis sources
directory src/core/raster).

You can't do anything with QgsLegend since it's not a part of QGIS
libraries (it's quite tightly bound to QGIS application itself).

Where to start when trying PyQGIS:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopingPluginsWithPython

To resolve the compilation problems you must uncomment the base class
in .sip file and remove "public" keyword, so it will look like this:
class QgsQuickPrint : QObject

To create an instance use:
qp = QgsQuickPrint()    <- don't forget the parentheses

Do you mean doxygen for PyQGIS ? no, there isn't anything like that...
(but could be since PyQt also has class documentation).

What do you mean by direct usage? When you create the object by
yourself? If so, there are some examples on wiki:
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/PythonBindings
there you can find creation of points, geometries, spatial index,
measuring class, vector file writer etc.

Besides the parentheses missing in the first command as mentioned
before, there's a problem with the last statement qp.print() because
"print" is a python keyword. So it's not possible to call it directly
and you need to use following workaround to execute it:
getattr(qp, 'print')()


Finally, I don't really like the idea of keeping this class in gui
library. The reason is that its functionality is too basic, limited
and without possibilities for customization. Better would be to move
some backend parts of map composer to gui library and build quickprint
upon that so that we will not develop two things that do same thing.

Martin

I think that's the point---a simple way to print a map.

If you do that, please report any strange strings (containg more than a 
small amount of HTML mark-up) for instance, and I'll try to fix as mucha 
as possibel before string freeze.

I understand the point, but I think it would be much better to build
upon existing code of map composer than to do the same in different
way.

You have a point. Let's wait till map composer branch is merged, and see 
if we can work on that?

>Hi,
>I don't get what you mean by "raster layer component"...

Hi, Martin.  Thanks so much for your answer.  There's an error in my last
post.  I need to develop a raster LEGEND component, not a raster layer
component.  Excuse me for that mistake.  What I particularly need is to
display several Ascii Grid Rasters in the map canvas of QGIS, and, attached
to it a legend component showing the list of layers loaded and for each
layer the symbology indicating the colors corresponding to each pixel value
of the raster layer.  I mean, something similar to the vector layer legend,
where you can categorize the information and assign a color for each
category, and things like those.  It seems it's not possible to obtain such
a legend for an ascii grid raster layer with the current functionality
included in QGIS.  Because of that, I think the only way to do that is to
develop a plugin for producing the legend.  Am I right or there is something
more I should know about this topic?  Could you give me some guidance to
start developing such a component?

Thanks again and best regards.

Yes, that's what I would prefer... QGIS libraries should get support
for map compositions and printing. With some effort we could move map
composer backend to QGIS core library and composer frontend either
leave in app code or move it to gui library. Then I can imagine usage
like:

1. create a composition template or load it from a file
2. create composition, set template and map render class (has list of
layers, extent, coordinate transform)
3. do some action (print to pdf / svg / image / printer)

These all steps can take just 5 lines of code...
And there could be some simple ready to use templates for those who
don't like to prepare their own templates.

Martin

Hi

Yes I am happy to toss the quickprint code (or make it a thin wrapper
around composer code) when composer is ready. I would prefer to keep
the quickprint class even if it internally delegates to composer stuff
since it provides a simple and convenient way to produce a map
programmatically.

At the moment composer stuff is not in the libs at all (its part of
app) and I think some major refactoring would probably be needed to
separate it out into libqgis_gui. This leaves libqgis programmers
without anyway to easily produce a map - which is the gap quickprint
class is designed to fill.

Regards

Tim

Hi

QgsRasterLayer has a method rasterLayer->getPaletteAsPixmap() which
gets a pixmap with a pallette swatch on it. I dont know if this is
available from the python bindings (I'm guessing it is), or if it
meets your needs...

Sorry I can't give you more guidance since I'm not much an expert to
rasters. Maybe some of our raster experts could give you some hints...

Wouldn't it make more sense to rename it in the bindings? You don't want 
an API that ugly!

qp.Print() or printMap, or .....

in fact, you can't create a class with a "print" method in python, but 
maybe you can in C -- but it sure seems like a bad idea!

Hi

Yes I was thinking the same thing. In c++ 'print ' is not a reserved
word, just in python it seems. Ill just rename the c++ method
printMap() - and thus python bindings too.

I guess you're already using another solution, but starting from r7984
you can use mapLayers() also from Python.

Hi Tim,

The new icons look great, thanks a lot!

they don't need to be selected to move, but to delete.

+1, this rearrangement seems logic to me

Right. The (detailed) snapping distances in the project properties can be double, but the standard tolerances in the options panel not. I'm plan to change that in the next time.

Hi Marco (and anyone else interested)

I've more or less finished redoing the digitising icons:

Disabled:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2191818025/
Enabled:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/2192605678/

I since discovered that features dont need to be selected first to
delete and move them so I will probably redo them. I also wanted to
suggest improving the logical grouping of the icons to:

Start / Stop editing
Capture points
Capture lines
Capture polys
Capture ring
Capture island
Move feature
Delete feature
Split feature
Cut
Copy
Paste
Add vertex
Move Vertex
Delete vertex


The rearrangement basically groups all feature based operations
together and all vertex based operations together. If folks approve of
that I can make the appropriate ordering changes.

Lastly, I wondered if the snapping distance in options panel can be
specified as a float rather since if you work in lat/long wgs84 as I
tend to do  the smallest snap distance I can have is 1 degree (which
is not very small).

Message-ID: <FA8A693893F4CE4283B4473C79FA47D5025D96A2@FBCMST06V02.fbc.local>

Hello,

I want to build QGIS under windows; I started reading in the QGIS wiki about compilation (BuildingFromSource document)http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource

After reading introduction and building notes, I jumped to section

3. Building under windows using msys

in this section I read in 3.1 that I can use a pre-built MSYS enviroment with all dependencies, or create it by myself one following the instructions detailed in section 6; because i want to build a new GRASS module I decided for the last.

QUESTION: After completing instructions in section 6, I have to follow section 3, starting from 3.2. Is that right?

6. Creation of MSYS environment for compilation of Quantum GIS

6.1. Initial setup

I exactly followed instructions detailed in section 6.1; about that I would remark:

http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe <http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe>  link is dead!

I used instead: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe?download

http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe link is dead!

I used instead: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe?modtime=1168811236&big_mirror=1 <http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe?modtime=1168811236&big_mirror=1> 

6.2. Installing dependencies

6.2.1. Getting ready

I downloaded Paul Kelly's package of precompiled libraries for GRASS and unpacked in c:\msys\local

6.2.2. GDAL level one

I exactly followed all the instructions, except:

GDAL build procedure can be greatly simplified to use libtool with a libtool line patch: configure gdal as below: ./configure --with-ngpython --with-xerces=/local/ --with-jasper=/local/ --with-grass=/local/grass-6.3.cvs/ --with-pg=/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config.exe 

Then fix libtool with: mv libtool libtool.orig cat libtool.orig | sed 's/max_cmd_len=8192/max_cmd_len=32768/g' > libtool 

Because I didn't understand well those instructions.

QUESTION: What should I do?

6.2.3. GRASS

I followed all the instructions detailed in this section, using grass-6.3.0RC4 source. After compiling I have the following compilation log:

1. those errors are dued to not complete execution of instruction in 6.2.2, or should I recompile GRASS libraries by myself?

Hi list !
For a specific python plugin i need to export raster values to a tabular
x,y,z file
i've try to access r.out.ascii.exe by calling rxvt.exe (mingv shell on
windows) from python and giving command file as argument, but it's a bit
messy, and doesn't produce a tabular result.
Would it be possible to do it only with python ?? (without having to work
with grasstools ?)
Any ideas ?
thanks 4 answers.

Hi

What not call the grass commands from python using QProcess or pythons
built in system process facilities? This is in fact the way most grass
tools are called internally by QGIS too.

Thanks for your answer Tim.

I'm searching some concrete examples of QProcess used in Python. Anyone ?

Given that i setup a mapset in my python code and that i have a 'laymnt'
variable that sets the current raster layer to work with, how can i do that
in a proper way (doesn't work yet) :

self.start('r.out.ascii.exe', 'input=laymnt output=mnttxt')

Is it possible to pass grass comands directly in the string or must i use a
file with commands in it ?

my goal is too write x,y,z values of any loaded elevation raster in mnttx,
and then redirect this file to an other .exe that calculate atmospheric
dispersion according to local topography and  meteo input data.

Any ideas very appreciated.

For that matter, when you're looking at snapping distance for selection 
of a vertex, for example, the distance should really be in pixels, not 
in whatever the coordinate system your data is in. Is this possible now?

I installed r7994 and problem persisted, but after rebooting it works 
OK. I have no idea where the problem came from.

I build with cygwin and the old msys that timliunx suppplied. No hack 
necessary. Is there a reason for me to build in any other way?

Did you get an message box warning from opening project files from

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Translation changes
Message-ID: <4790A093.2060807@homann.se>

I have been changing and cleaning up the text strings, to make it easier 
to translate. For translators, see more info below.

FOR DEVELOPERS:
There are a couple of things that I would like to point out:

* Do not use HTML-tags in .ui files. At least, not more than necessary. 
Qt Designer likes to add lots of style information in the .ui file, 
making it very hard to translate (see more below in the changeset):

* Store all settings (except of course names and such) in the project 
file in english. Use 'Green' instead of 'Gr?n' for colors selected by 
the users.

* For large text plates, consider using the constructor to populate the 
text plate, making it much easier to translate one sentence at a time, 
and decoupling layout strings from text strings. This also minimize 
translation of same string twice (e.g. 'Description' below)

* Take some time looking through your old stuff, maybe you can help?

**************
   // Set text for pyramid info box
   QString pyramidFormat("<h2>%1</h2><p>%2 %3 %4</p><b><font 
color='red'><p>%5</p><p>%6</p>");
   QString pyramidHeader    = tr("Description");
   QString pyramidSentence1 = tr("Large resolution raster layers can 
slow navigation in QGIS.");
   QString pyramidSentence2 = tr("By creating lower resolution copies of 
the data (pyramids) performance can be considerably improved as QGIS 
selects the most suitable resolution to use depending on the level of 
zoom.");
   QString pyramidSentence3 = tr("You must have write access in the 
directory where the original data is stored to build pyramids.");
   QString pyramidSentence4 = tr("Please note that building pyramids may 
alter the original data file and once created they cannot be removed!");
   QString pyramidSentence5 = tr("Please note that building pyramids 
could corrupt your image - always make a backup of your data first!");

 
tePyramidDescription->setHtml(pyramidFormat.arg(pyramidHeader).arg(pyramidSentence1)
			.arg(pyramidSentence2).arg(pyramidSentence3)
			.arg(pyramidSentence4).arg(pyramidSentence5));
**************

See also https://svn.qgis.org/trac/changeset/7997

FOR TRANSLATORS:

Yes, this means that some strings have to bre re-translated. That's the 
downside. On the upside, new translationa re much easier to perform, and 
small changes in large texts easier to discover and update.

I have used linguist on WinXP, and it keeps the old translation 
available in the GUI. By copying and pasting from the obsolete, large, 
HTM-infested translation one sentence at a time this was quite qick. I 
also disovered som errors in my translation. :-) An alternative could be 
having QGIS up and runinng with the old translation installed, and copy 
from there.

If no objections arise, I will continue clean up strings, but it is 
quite time-consuming, so it might take a long time before QGIS is 
totally clean, certainly not at string freeze in a few days.

Too bad, because the revision information given there is valuable when 
reporting bugs in reading old project files. That's why I in the warning 
dialog said you should report that information. It also gave a link on 
where to report problems, and what should be included.

It makes it much easier fixing these kind of problems.

I suggest you turn it on, at least when there is problems.

OK, I turned it on. But note some of the projects giving problems were 
saved with trunk version, only a few revisions older.

Yes, if you use other version of QGIS then the releases, there is no 
guarantee that you get a clean upgrade. The default values should 
however be safe, so QGIS shouldn't crash.

In trunk, changes in project file format can appear at any time.

 Some Notes on Compiling Applications Against GEOS 3.0.0rc4

Submitted by dylan on Tue, 2007-12-11 19:52.

I recently upgraded to GEOS 3.0.0rc4 <http://geos.refractions.net/> in order
to take advantage of its more robust handling of invalid geometries (damn
shapefiles!). However, there are two mini-bugs in this release which need to
be sorted out when compiling against it (or at least for the two application
I was interested in: QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/> and
StarSpan<http://gforge.casil.ucdavis.edu/frs/?group_id=48>).
Note that the first issue presented here has been resolved in GEOS
3.0.0rc5<http://geos.refractions.net/geos-3.0.0rc5.tar.bz2>
.

   1.

   Several of the GEOS source files contain little notes about "warning
   *** FIXME: to be removed, temporarly set to allow a quick successful build"
   which cause compiler warning messages. While this is not a big problem, it
   makes some applications which use the compiler flags -Wall and
-Werrorbarf. This is the default mode for the latest versions of QGIS,
and
   therefore the "PEDANTIC" flag in its configuration should be set to *
   OFF*.
   2.

   A recent patch to 'source/inlines.cpp' (included in GEOS 3.0.0rc4)
   meant to deal with compiler problems on Windows causes problems for real
   operating systems. As documented
here<http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2007-February/001597.html>suggests
changing line 30 of 'source/inlines.cpp' from:

   #if defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(DLL_EXPORT)

   to

   #if !defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(DLL_EXPORT)


   After doing this, re-compile / re-install GEOS 3.0.0rc4 and
   applications built against it should not have any problems with functions
   not being defined. This has been submitted as ticket
#166<http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/166>on the GEOS Trac page. "


 *so, I build geos-3.0.0. and pedantic option is off in ccmake by default.
However following error is occurred;*


 In file included from /usr/local/include/geos.h:27,

from /home/vkepoglu/dev/cpp/qgis/src/core/qgsgeometry.h:26,

from /home/vkepoglu/dev/cpp/qgis/python/core/qgsgeometry.sip:21:

/usr/local/include/geos/geom.h:145:2: warning: #warning *** DEPRECATED: You
are using deprecated header geom.h. Please, update your sources according to
new layout of GEOS headers and namespaces


 *Do you have any idea? Is there anything that I should do something for
GEOS?*

Thanks alot. it worked. I build QGIS from source code.

I don't know previously why it doesn't work. it maybe difference between the
package installed with sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev whose version is
2.3.3-3 as stated in snaptic package manager and source code of geos-2.3.3.

I am getting the following error in idle 1.2.1 of python 2.5.1

>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import *
>>> from PyQt4.QtGui import *
>>> from qgis.core import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#2>", line 1, in <module>
    from qgis.core import *
ImportError: No module named qgis.core

I have tried to define the path as follows, in order to try all
possibilities.

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/include/qgis:/usr/local/lib/qgis:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/share/qgis
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/qgis/python

but nothing changed. the same error in python. module couldn't find.

I do not know which path to define. in ccmake I accepted all default paths.
what actually do these paths? is it required to define these paths for each
session, I mean when ? closed the terminal, path assignment is disappearing.

should ? define ld_library_path as the path of source code:
/home/vkepoglu/dev/cpp/qgis?

should I re-build by setting BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL variable in CMake to
TRUE?

maybe I should define in which path to install qgis, isn't it?
but do not know how to define
is CMAKE_BUILD_PREFIX (is it the path definition of installing qgis) the
equilavent of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, because in ccmake version 2.4 there is
no CMAKE_BUILD_PREFIX anymore?

Hi Tisham,
 
about what you said in the last mail: " I use GDAL CVS and Grass CVS 6.3RC3 tags "
 
1. About GDAL CVS:
 
I built gdal 1.4.1 and patched libtool; now I'll try to build 1.5.0 version (latest stable release) with the same patch instructions found in the wiki;
 
2. About GRASS CVS:
 
You suggested to use GRASS 6.3RC3 CVS source code, but I never used CVS system; is it the same if I use RC3 package found here:
http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass63/source/grass-6.3.0RC3.tar.gz <http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass63/source/grass-6.3.0RC3.tar.gz> ?
 
Thanks for your help. Regards,

Hi Tisham,
 
1. GDAL: I built gdal 1.5.0.... it's really a mess! I'll be back with 1.4.1
 
2. GRASS Source Code: now I'm rebuilding GDAL 1.4.1 (it takes a while)... later I'll build GRASS from RC03 source code, and then I'll try with RC04; it's the latest release candidate, so I guess it works good as RC03; I downloaded both from http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass63/source/

can you check that path /usr/local/share/qgis/python that there's
directory 'qgis' in which there are file core.so, gui.so and
__init__.py ?

if you've installed qgis to /usr/local prefix, you actually don't need
to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH since /usr/local/lib (where are the files
libqgis_core.so and libqgis_gui.so) is already in linker's search
path. Just make sure to call ldconfig after installing to update the
cache of system libraries.

when you do 'export' it will be working only in current shell. So you
have to do first export of PYTHONPATH variable and then in the same
console open python interpreter. Or you can do the same in Python -
before importing qgis modules you can add that path to python's
sys.path array.

no, it's not needed.

no, it's not necessary.

it's okay to install it to default path (/usr/local) - if you don't
have any special reasons for not doing it, use the default path.

Message-ID: <d368056f0801211724lec1e33t7ccf61718c7a8de1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (and especially translators)

As of today please note that we are entering string freeze for the run
up to the next release. If you are committing bug fixes please avoid
changing any strings. Translation .ts files have been updated in SVN
so please update your local svn checkouts. The period for translations
will close January 27 2008 (i.e. about one week from now) and then we
will be branching for release. Any translations submitted to us after
that time will only be included in the next release, so please submit
what you have by then even if it is not complete.

There was some discussion on the IRC channel today about the naming of
this release. I would like to proceed with the release as planned but
there are a great deal of new features incorporated from branches in
this release which inevitably means new bugs. So not wanting to
deviate from our release schedule, but at the same time wanting to
indicate the fact that there are a number of unresolved issues, we
will be going about the normal release process, but releasing as QGIS
0.9.2rc1 (rc signifying release candidate). It is our hope that by
building packages and making a rc release we can give early adopters
ready to use binaries to commence more detailed testing and bug
reporting. We will follow up 0.9.2rc1 with a bug triage release
focusing on stabilising new features and improving render performance.

As always you can track the release plans via the checklist at:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9.2

(I will update this page to indicate the rc1 status soon)

If you have any questions about the translation process, please see
the following page which I have recently updated with instructions on
how to generate a .ts file for a new locale.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner

Many thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do!

Hi,

Hi Marco, yes you need postgres installed. The fixlibtool fails because
configure failed.
Hi Magnus, I have never used Cygwin, but the hack line for libtool is
required with MSYS based libtool.

How does this sudden change of plans interact with revions upgrade 
functionality?

<rant>

When I implemented functionality to take project files from one release 
to another, I followed the releas plan that was on the Web. After 0.9.1, 
there would be 0.9.2, and then work continue with 0.9.3. Now, I have no 
idea how you want to note the difference in releases in the project 
files, if at all. What about changes between release candidates?

Personally, I think we should stick to the original plan. What's next, 
release 0.9.2.rc2a-VI-svn12345? It's just getting silly.

Hi

Sorry I thought we adressed this on IRC but maybe we didnt. The idea
is to follow rc1 release with a bug triage release - effectively
extending the feature freeze for another month or so. It should be
safe to call your rev up work 0.9.1-0.9.2 since there should be no
feature changes between 0.9.2rc1 and 0.9.2 final (new features should
be happening in branches, not in trunk anyway). That make sense post
coffee? :-)


Regards,

Tim

yes, these files exist in specified path.

my install is /usr/local, it is required to set every time to write "export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib" in terminal.
is there way to make this definition permanently?

when you do 'export' it will be working only in current shell. So you

How can I add "PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/qgis/python" to python's
sys.patharray.

To explain this a bit: normally dynamic linker uses its cache to find
needed shared objects (*.so files). There's usually a file called
/etc/ld.so.conf where is a list of directories. This config file is
used by 'ldconfig' tool which recreates the cache of libraries. It's
usual that /usr/local/lib directory is included, so you just need to
re-create the cache after installing new programs to /usr/local prefix
- so that dynamic linker can find it.
In case you would like to use some special directory to search for
libraries (in addition to the cache), use LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to
specify it.
So in your case you don't have to specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH everytime,
just reload the cache once after installing QGIS and that's it.

for example:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/local/share/qgis/python')

Hi Christoph,

I agree that it would be more convenient to have the snapping tolerance in 
pixels. 
One thing that I'm not sure about is if, in case of reprojected layers, the 
pixel_distance / layer_distance ratio is constant over the whole map view and 
in each direction. If it is not, then I think it will be problematic to 
specify the tolerance in pixels.

Regards,
Marco

I am using Ubuntu in Windows with emulator, VMware workstation 5.5.5
I am new baby in linux, sorry for this.

/usr/local/lib definition exits in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf

maybe the problem is related with python, ? do not know, or with emulator.
or maybe it is not a problem. my way is to use qgis bindings in python as

Ah, so why don't you use Windows release of QGIS?

Have you run ldconfig or not? (you need to run it as root)

Hi,
 
About error in imagery/i.class it seems to be generated by lack in MinGW of SIGSTP and SIGALRM signal definitions in mingw/include/signal.h
I added those signals to signal.h as follows
#define	SIGTSTP		18	/* Stop Request by Terminal */
#define	SIGALRM		13	/* Alarm Signal */
but recompiling it gives an error because of lack of alarm() function in mingw.
Building using CMAKE could be a solution to let it work? I'm googling about that...
Thanks. Regards,
Marco

1. /usr/local/lib path definition does not exist in ld.so.conf directly.
ld.so.conf refers to in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf which has that path
definition

? used following commands

sudo chown vkepoglu /etc/ld.so.conf  -> take permission to edit file. edit
and add path, run
sudo ldconfig

it worked.

2. for PYTHONPATH, edit bashrc and add path

nano /home/vkepoglu/.bashrc -> add the following lines
export PYTHONPATH='usr/local/share/qgis/python' -> save and exit, then from
a prompt, run
source /home/vkepoglu/.bashrc
log off and the result in terminal is

Ah, so why don't you use Windows release of QGIS?

Martin

I want to learn Linux, not crappy Windows anymore. I am not using QGIS at
work but sometimes have time to learn something at work. it depends on me.
As ? am also doing phd, trying to make thesis related works. The rules of IT
department forces me to use windows. Here, at work we are using ESRI's
products. I am using ArcGIS Desktop (ArcINFO licensed) from version 8.0 to
9.1, ArcSDE and ArcIMS as GIS user at work.

Thanks for everybody who contributed to do the development of qgis.

I'm writing a plugin/provider that's similar in functionality to the

the size, color and possibly the symbol itself when I add a point to the

Hi Ken

I'm not sure that it makes sense to set symbology in your provider
itself so Im hoping you are trying to do it from some kind of add
layer gui, but you havent provided much information for me to know
whats really going on. That said here is how you can set the symbol on
a new vector layer instance programmatically:

 1572           QgsSymbol *  mypSymbol = new
QgsSymbol(mypVectorLayer->vectorType());
 1573           QColor
myPresenceColor(mySettings.value("mapping/presenceColour",QColor(Qt::green).name()).toString());
 1574           mypSymbol->setFillColor(myPresenceColor);
 1575           mypSymbol->setColor(Qt::black); //outline
 1576           mypSymbol->setPointSize(mySymbolSize);
 1577           mypSymbol->setFillStyle(Qt::SolidPattern);
 1578           QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRenderer = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypVectorLayer->vectorType());
 1579           mypRenderer->addSymbol(mypSymbol);
 1580           mypVectorLayer->setRenderer(mypRenderer);

The above is a single symbol renderer take from one of my cpp
projects. The same project also implements a unigue value renderer -
see the original source at http://tinyurl.com/3xystm for more info.

I hope that helped!

Regards

Tim

Sorry if I wasn't too clear.  Let me try to present the problem just a 
bit differently.

Let's say I'm using the delimited text plugin and provider, as is, in 
the source code, but I want to modify it so that the points are 
displayed as triangles instead of squares and at size 20 instead of the 
default.  These choices would be built into the software, i.e., not user 
selectable.  How would I do that?

Hi

You would need to create a modified version of the delimited text
plugin (the gui not the provider). After the gui creates the
vectorlayer based on the delimited text provider, you would apply your
symbology using code similar to my last post, and then return control
to the user interface. Here is the logic trail:

http://svn.qgis.org/trac/browser/trunk/qgis/src/plugins/delimited_text/qgsdelimitedtextplugingui.cpp
107 	    emit drawVectorLayer(uri,txtLayerName->text(),"delimitedtext");

http://svn.qgis.org/trac/browser/trunk/qgis/src/plugins/delimited_text/qgsdelimitedtextplugin.cpp
131 	void QgsDelimitedTextPlugin::drawVectorLayer(QString thePathNameQString,
132 	    QString theBaseNameQString, QString theProviderQString)
133 	{
134 	  qGisInterface->addVectorLayer( thePathNameQString,
135 	      theBaseNameQString, theProviderQString);
136 	}

>From there things get a bit tricky because addVectorLayer returns bool
so you dont at that point have a handle for the actual layer. So next
you need to trawl the registry and find your layer from the layers
map:

QMap<QString, QgsMapLayer*> myMapLayers =
     QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->mapLayers();
QMap<QString, QgsMapLayer*>::const_iterator myIterator;
QgsMapLayer * mypLayer;
while (myIterator.hasNext())
{
  mypLayer = myIterator.value();
  if (mypLayer->source() == theFileNameYouUsedToLoadTheLayer)
 {
     //layer is found
     break;
  }
}

Now you can cast the layer to a vector layer:

QgsVectorLayer *mypVectorLayer  =
            dynamic_cast<QgsVectorLayer *> ( mypLayer );
    if ( mypVectorLayer )
    {
        const QgsRenderer* mypRenderer = mypVectorLayer->renderer();
        //now set symbology etc...
     }


Writing this makes me wonder if we shouldnt make addVectorLayer return
the registry layer id, but the above describes how you can achieve
your desired result.

Hope that helps!

Regards

Tim

Ah, that will be caused by the recent refactoring of the raster classes.

Today I've updated PythonBindings wiki page with some resources
(listed in top part in Using PyQGIS section). Basically it's good to
look at QGIS C++ API reference, QGIS blog, tutorials ported to Python
and QGIS plugins that have been done already. (all links listed there)

This was very helpful.  I noticed the layer map was actually a std::map 
instead of a QMap, so I had to change to code to adjust to that.  I can 
now display my custom symbol on the map, but I noticed the graphic for 
the symbol you see on the stack of layers on the left pane of QGIS 
doesn't show my new symbol.  How would I update that symbol also?

Hi

Yeah sorry the layer map has been changed to QMap in svn trunk so your
plugin will need a small update when 0.9.2rc1 comes out. Note that the
api will undergo changes until the 1.0 release at which point it will
be maintains in a backwards compatible state for the 1.x releases.

The second part of your question relates to the legend not refreshing.
You need to tell it to refresh after making changes to the symbology.
A good place to look how this is done is in

src/gui/qgsvectorlayerproperties.cpp/h

You will see it has a signal

     71   signals:     72
     73     /** emitted when changes to layer were saved to update legend */
     74     void refreshLegend(QString layerID, bool expandItem);

This is connected to the legend instance when the vector layer props
dialog is opened from the legend context menu:

legend/qgslegend.cpp:      connect(vlp,
SIGNAL(refreshLegend(QString,bool)), this,
SLOT(refreshLayerSymbology(QString,bool)));

In your case since you are not in the context of legend when opening
your dialog you will need to get teh legend instance from the qgis
application instance via the plugin interface, and connect your signal
that way.

Hope that helps!

Regards

Tim

Hi

Yes the raster API is changed. I dont know the python stuff so well
but in the case of C++  you would do something like this:

117 	   mpRasterLayer->setDrawingStyle(QgsRasterLayer::SINGLE_BAND_PSEUDO_COLOR);
118 	   mpRasterLayer->setColorShadingAlgorithm(QgsRasterLayer::PSEUDO_COLOR);
119 	   mpRasterLayer->setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(
120 	          QgsContrastEnhancement::STRETCH_TO_MINMAX, false);

You will need to translate that to python api but it should be quite
similar. Take a look at
http://svn.qgis.org/trac/browser/trunk/qgis/src/core/raster/qgsrasterlayer.h
for the different drawing styles and shading algorithms you can use.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WinGRASS Building Instructions And QGIS Compile
	Enviroment
Message-ID: <FBCMMO03yEuJcau8lmn000031af@FBCMMO03.fbc.local>

Hi,
 
in WinGRASS Current Status (from GRASS wiki) I read as follows:
 
After compiling [GRASS] you should copy libxdr.dll, libproj.dll, libpng.dll, libgdal-1.dll and libz.dll.1.2.3 into the GRASS lib directory and all the GDAL and PROJ .exe files in the bin directory into the GRASS bin directory, and then you have a more or less self-contained GRASS distribution.
 
is that necessary even if I want to use grass only with grass plug-in in QGIS?
 
Thanks
 
PS: I'm building qgis+grass by myself on windows, creating my own msys enviroment; I'm also in contact with grass-dev list, and I think that some instructions in http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource should be fixed. What should I do?
 
Thanks
 
Marco

Hi Tim,

thanks for the snippet. I've updated the examples accordingly, I've
also kept the older version for those interested.
http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/59

Beware - you need most recent SVN trunk since it now contains fixes to
bindings which got broken by the recent merges.

Is there any source of information how does the raster
rendering/handling work now? I was unable to find anything and some of
the terms are quite new to me...

Bye
Martin

Hi Martin

Pete and I will be adding more examples into the unit tests under
tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp.

I'll let you know when they are updated. Ill be updating my c++ tuts
in the near future too.

Regards

Tim

Martin,

QgsRasterLayer::setDrawingStyle()  [Same in 0.9.1]
QgsRasterLayer->setColorShadingAlgorithm() [was setColorRampingType in 0.91]
QgsRasterLayer->setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm() [was 
setColorScalingAlgorithm in 0.9.1]
***Each of these sets a corresponding get method. And these are the only 
three things that must be understood to draw a raster layer

in 0.9.2, the abstracted draw process per pixel is:
For gray scale or RGB images
Read data from band -> Check NoDataValue -> Get transparency level -> 
Stretch -> Invert (if necessary) -> Display
For paletted, pseudo color, for custom color maps
Read data from band -> Check NoDataValue -> Get transparency level -> 
Shade(color) -> Invert (if necessary) -> Display

There are now a couple of new classes:
QgsContrastEnhancement - This class is responsible for implementing the 
contrast enhancement. QgsRasterLayer calls 
QgsContrastEnhancement::stretch(pixel value) and is returned a stretched 
value(int). The actual stretching is done by what ever the current  
QgsContrastEnhancementFunction [virtual base class] does. This is a per 
pixel operation at the moment, because it is close to a direct port of 
what was previously being done in the draw loop in QgsRasterLayer. For 8 
and 16 bit data a lookup table is generated to speed things up, 32-bit 
data are computed each call to stretch().

QgsRasterShader - Is similar in idea to QgsContrastEnhancement, but no 
lookup table at the moment. QgsRasterShader::generateShadedValue(pixel 
value, &returnRed, &returnGreen, &returnBlue) computes a RGB value for 
the provided pixel value. The actual computation is done by a 
QgsRasterShaderFunction[virtual base class].

Programatically, you could create your own shader or contrast 
enhancement function by inheriting the base QgsRasterShaderFunction or 
QgsConstrastEnhancementFunction then calling,
QgsRasterLayer::setContrastEnhancementFunction(new 
MyContrastEnhancementFunction())
QgsRasterLater::setSetRasterShaderFunction(new MyRasterShaderFunction())

Hope that helps a little....

	Enviroment
Message-ID: <FBCMMO01eSQDslHtBa500010dfe@FBCMMO01.fbc.local>

Hi,
 
in WinGRASS Current Status (from GRASS wiki) I read as follows:
 
After compiling [GRASS] you should copy libxdr.dll, libproj.dll, libpng.dll, libgdal-1.dll and libz.dll.1.2.3 into the GRASS lib directory and all the GDAL and PROJ .exe files in the bin directory into the GRASS bin directory, and then you have a more or less self-contained GRASS distribution.
 
is that necessary even if I want to use grass only with grass plug-in in QGIS?
 
Thanks
 
PS: I'm building qgis+grass by myself on windows, creating my own msys enviroment; I'm also in contact with grass-dev list, and I think that some instructions in http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource should be fixed. What should I do?
 
Thanks
 
Marco

Hi Marco

Ideally changes to the building from source procedure should be
submitted as a patch to INSTALL.t2t which is the master document that
the INSTALL text docuemnt and BuildingFromSource wiki page get
generated from. You can fine INSTALL.t2t in the top level of the QGIS
svn checkout.

Hi

If you have a svn checkout of qgis (which I figure you will be doing
if you are planning to build from source) you will find it in the top
level checkout dir. Alternatively you can just cehck out that one file
like this:

mkdir qgis_tmp
cd qgis_tmp
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis/INSTALL.t2t

make your edits, then submit your changes to the qgis trac or to a
qgis dev using the procedure described here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersManual#head-fab2f4f09fd38b13648712795e4ce9a108677f71

Best regards

Tim

As I am new baby, I may be sauciness or wise guy or inexperience, but or I
am. I also do not know whether these adjectives are appropriate for me.
:-) But I wondered to ask... just commenting...

Backward compatibility is cared, isn't? I mean there is obvious reason to
add setColorShadingAlgorithm and setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm in 0.9.2.

Isn't it possible to keep setColorRampingType and setColorScalingAlgorithm
also in 0.9.2? They exist in 0.9.1 that is released. Version 0.9.1 and
0.9.2is so close.

I know the reason is that "Tradeoff between backward compatibility and
architectural quality." howver, the change of code is so fast. Is it normal
case for Linux? Or is QGIS fast growing and developing environment? Thanks
for your efforts.


With my best regard,
Volkan Kepoglu

Hi

Although the version numbers seem close there are many changes between
0.9.2 and 0.9.1. Until version 1.0 comes out we cannot guarantee API
compatibility since we are not yet feature complete and some features
require major changes to the API. We chose to name 0.9.2 rather than
'0.10.0' because people might confuse that with '1.0' and we will
probably be doing 0.9.3....0.9.9 on the way up to the 1.0 release. Al
this said in general we keep API changes to a minimum but Peter has
added many often requested  and very useful features to the raster API
and this required some re-plumbing of the internals.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis reading error since v0.9
Message-ID: <4799A8EE.80007@laposte.net>

Hi all,
I have a pbm loading data from postgis since the 0.9 version.
My postgis table :
CREATE TABLE import_parcelle
(
  wkb_geometry geometry,
  dat_loc character(10),
  heu_loc character(8),
  deb_dro numeric(5,2),
  deb_gau numeric(5,2),
  deb_tot numeric(5,2),
  vitesse numeric(5,2),
  altitude numeric(6,2),
  niv_cuv numeric(6,2),
  tempe numeric(5,2),
  humidite numeric(5,2),
  dir_ven numeric(5,2),
  for_ven numeric(5,2),
  evt_mac numeric(5,2),
  cod_pro1 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro1 numeric(7,2),
  cod_pro2 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro2 numeric(7,2),
  cod_pro3 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro3 numeric(7,2),
  cod_pro4 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro4 numeric(7,2),
  cod_pro5 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro5 numeric(7,2),
  cod_pro6 numeric(7,2),
  qte_pro6 numeric(7,2),
  operat1 numeric(7),
  operat2 numeric(7),
  operat3 numeric(7),
  operat4 numeric(7),
  "option" numeric(7),
  materiel numeric(7),
  code_uc character(3),
  serial serial NOT NULL,
  x numeric(15,2),
  y numeric(15,2),
  CONSTRAINT import_parcelle_pkey PRIMARY KEY (serial)
)

I can load the data, but the type and length of each column is wrong, as 
you can see here :
http://michaeldouchin.free.fr/error_qgis_postgis.jpg
And then it is also impossible to use the column for rendering.

This pbm didn't occur in the 0.8 version.
Is it a known bug ?

Hi

If you have a svn checkout of qgis (which I figure you will be doing
if you are planning to build from source) you will find it in the top
level checkout dir. Alternatively you can just cehck out that one file
like this:

mkdir qgis_tmp
cd qgis_tmp
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis/INSTALL.t2t

make your edits, then submit your changes to the qgis trac or to a
qgis dev using the procedure described here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersManual#head-fab2f4f09fd38b13648712795e4ce9a108677f71

Best regards

Tim

Hi

I forgot the qgisappinterface also has a

 virtual void refreshLegend(QgsMapLayer *l);

call that you could use which is probably than the original approach I
mentioned.

Doing svn log discovers that this has been added about 2 years ago by Radim:
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/changeset/4811

So I guess this had some impact on GRASS but since then windows port
of GRASS has come a long way so it should be safe to remove...

May I suggest doing the same changes for the legend icons?
See attached screenshot in which I have changed points icon, to get an 
idea of what I mean.

Thanks for the clarifications, Pete!
This helped a lot.
I'm wondering about the difference between raster shaders and contrast
enhancements... is the difference just semantic that shaders are used
for grayscale/RGB images and contrast enhancements for
palleted/pseudocolor images?

Message-ID: <d368056f0801271109g13bf6edfw18ed6e1abe425526@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I have made further updates to the icons to try to improve consistency
and clarity in the icons. Some of these changes were committed with
the digitising icons, a few more were committed with some changes
requested by Carlos. I have a final more high impact set of chages
that I would like to commit before we branch 0.9.2rc1. They are 'high
impact' in that they include the icons most used for add layer etc.
They also include updates to the GRASS icons (well I redid them all).
Are there any objections to me committing the remaining one? I'm
thining particularly of the doc folks since I realise that every
change to the main window requires retaing screenshots...but I guess
we will need to redo all screenshots once ui is finalised for 1.0.

Here is a preview:

http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2223076685&size=o

I would like to commit these UI changes tomorrow if there are no objections.

Regards

Those look good to me. Certainly improved, imo.

Hi Tim,

they look nice! (maybe we should 'pimp' the old skool zoom and pan 
layers, save and copy also :-) ).

My 5 cent:
I like the green plus, star and red cross. One thing I'm not sure off, 
is the 'forbidden/closed traffic sign'. A forbidden sign is more a 
'locked' or something (for me)? That's supposed to be a 'hide' isn't it?
One idea: make it an eye(ball) with slash/stripe through it??
The closed sign for the overview-toggle, that's some 'turn around' sign 
now. What's your idea there? Is the closed sign hidden when the layer is 
hidden in the overview?

To be clear: it's absolutely an improvement.

Regards,
Richard Duivenvoorde

Tim,

thanks a lot for that. It makes the UI so much more appealing
(and we all know how important that is in this world ;).

One thing I need to say, though: I have used QGIS for teaching
GIS newbies these past one or two years and the number one source
of confusion was always the visual similarity of the GRASS and
"regular" layer adding icons. People frequently "mis-clicked"
those.

I can see that you have already worked on that and made the two
more different, but believe me, with a lot of people out there having
rather poor vision and colour blindness, an even stronger contrast would
be preferable.

Any chance you could try and increase the difference even more? I am
a bit at a loss for smart ideas, but how about taking all of the green
from the non-GRASS layer icons and stamping a big, fat "G" on the
GRASS ones?

Cheers,

Benjamin

Hi Many thanks for the various feedback - its greatly appreciated. I
will commit these but in the course of today make some tweaks to try
to take your various suggestions into account:

 - the toggle overview 'stop sign' is a mistake - Ill fix that
 - try to make the grass ones higher contrast
 - switch the (-) mini icons to (x)


Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Branching for 0.9.2rc1 release
Message-ID: <d368056f0801280533v4507e52dm623f64ffd94ab94a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I will be branching for 0.9.2rc1 tonight (brazil time) - a day later
than scheduled. After that the freeze will be lifted off trunk. I will
send out a notice once I have completed the branch with more info.
Once branched, the only commits that go into the branch should be
packaging related.

If you have any outstanding bug fixes , translations etc, please get
them in to me or another developer with commit access today (or commit
them yourself if you have write access).

Thanks as always

Regards

Actually it is the just opposite! :) Contrast enhancement is for the 
gray/RBG and shaders are for the paletted/pseudocolor image.

But as far as the differences, one of the main difference is that the 
contrast enhancement process is done band by band and effectively 
returns one integer value between 0-255 per input pixel value while the 
shader returns three values or a "color". You could actually mimic a 
contrast enhancement for a gray scale image with a shader but not the 
other way around. In this first set of refactoring, the primary goal was 
to get the raster functionality operable and heading in a better 
direction. I had originally thought about making only one shader class 
that would do both color mapping as well as contrast enhancement;  that 
can still happen if there general consensus that it would make more sense.

Deeper down there are some other differences. There is only one shader 
per raster layer but each band has a contrast enhancement. One of the 
reasons for this is that before there were min max values being stored 
in the QgsRasterLayer for each the red, green, blue and gray band. This 
did not work well when you have images with a lot of bands or want to 
switch between gray scale and RGB as you would have to manually reset 
the min max values along the way. Now, you can explore a single band as 
gray scale set your min max values, which are kept with the band, and 
when you switch back to RGB the min max values persist. It is very 
likely that the shader functionality will be extended so that each band 
has a shader rather than there being only one for the whole layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Building Error
Message-ID: <000001c86209$9c6b6210$0201a8c0@notebookmarco>

Hi,

I reported erros building qgis (0.9.1). It reports:

undefined reference to `geos::io::WKTReader::~WKTReader()
undefined reference to `geos::geom::Coordinate::~Coordinate()

Attached the whole error list (txt).

I created my own MSYS enviroment using GEOS 3.0.0 source code; should I use
2.2.3 instead? In this case, can I only re-build GEOS using 2.2.3 source
code, or do I need to repeat all the instructions in the wiki after GEOS?

Thanks,

Marco

Does CMake (i.e. ccmake) find your geos install?  When you switch to
advanced mode in ccmake can you verify all "geos" related vars have sane
values?

mhh... Actually I don't know if they are "sane"; In advanced mode I have
about GEOS:

GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR = c:/msys/local/include
GEOS_LIBRARY = c:/msys/local/lib/libgeos.dll.a

Correct CMakesetup configuration is actually a great problem for me; I
posted about it some hours ago, and there are no instructions in the wiki
(excluding few and not very useful ones in
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_with_CMake#head-379089283e60811546c00

Marco,
Sorry I am not more help.  On win I use the pre-built msys environments that
others with more inspiration than I have built.  I know that the one I use
is built with the 2.X geos series.  I have confirmed that the settings for
GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR and GEOS_LIBRARY are the same as what I have on my system.
But again, the version of geos that those point to was built by someone
else. 

As far as the 3.x version of geos, I am using it quite successfully on my
linux based installs but have not tried on Win.  Maybe someone with more
windows knowledge will step in and shed some light.

Hi Marco,

I think you might have a problem which the definition of GEOS_INLINE. I do not have Windows or MSYS but I have seen this error.

This was a MinGW bug in GEOS 3.0.0rc3. It was fixed for MinGW in rc4 but broke other platforms including Mac which I use. I proposed a solution which fixed other platforms for rc5 and hopefully did not break MinGW again.

Look at the GEOS inline.cpp/h files. There are MinGW-specific conditionals there. Make sure that the same values are used both for building GEOS and QGIS.

It looks like the missing functions are not in the library because GEOS_INLINE was defined for the library but not in QGIS because GEOS_INLINE was not defined for QGIS.

Tom

Hi,

now I've tried building with geos 3.0.0 with MinGW and getting the
same problem with undefined references. When I try to link GEOS
statically I get errors about multiple definition of some symbols, I
guess because of being defined inline and non-inline too, e.g.:

c:\msys\local\lib\libgeos.a(inlines.o): In function
`ZNK4geos4geom30CoordinateArraySequenceFactory6createEPSt6vectorINS0_10CoordinateESaIS3_EE':

So I've tried configuring geos with --disable-inline flag but this
lead just to bunch of error when linking geos library (not qgis!)...

.libs/libgeos.la-2.o: In function `GLOBAL__D__ZN4geos2io9WKTWriterC2Ev':

C:/msys/local/src/geos-3.0.0/source/io/WKTWriter.cpp:421: undefined

[...]

Once I've put #define GEOS_INLINE to qgsgeometry.h it seems to compile
and link well (both with DLL and static link). But is this a solution?

Message-ID: <d368056f0801282028m68ce2644g8b5654b64faeb211@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

Tonight I have branched 0.9.2rc1. It would be great if you can assist
by making packages for your preferred platform. The branch can be
checked out at:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0.9.2rc1 qgis-0.9.2rc1

Please do not commit anything to the branch except packaging related tweaks.

The release checklist at :

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9.2rc1

Has a list of people who have previously made packages. If you make a
package for 0.9.1rc1 please be so kind as to add the url to that wiki
page in the section provided so that we can gather all the url
packages in a systematic way. If you are able to make packages for
unlisted platforms / distros please let me know so that we can avoid
duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement within the next week or
so, so it will be great to have all packages ready by then.


SVN Trunk is open again for general commits but please not that we are
aiming to do the 0.9.2 final release within a month or so (timetable
to be determined) and you should not make any major feature changes
without prior discussion with PSC and Dev list.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

Best regards

Hi,
 
thanks for replies. I'll try to put #define GEOS_INLINE to qgsgeometry.h
anyway, I could re-build only GEOS using 2.2.3 source code instead of 3.0.0 (that is not a release candidate, unfortunately, but a stable one!)
could be a better solution?
 
Thanks

No QT installed?

Have you set QTDIR?
Do you have %QTDIR%\bin in your path?

Just to make sure, have you put it before or after #include <geos.h> ?
Because putting it after this include won't help...

Yes. I'm going to...
If not I will try with 2.3.3 (wich should be stable)

So, can you try to compile it with geos 3.0.0rc4 ? Tom said that this
version should work with MinGW.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cmakesetup not found variables!
Message-ID: <FBCMMO01o3wO5blwHUp00019602@FBCMMO01.fbc.local>

Hi,
 
I don't know why, but I have some blank or not found variables after configure in cmakesetup
Everything is installed and configured (enviromental path variable also) as indicated in the wiki
 
by now I set:
 
POSTGRES_INCLUDE_DIR = c:\msys\local\pgsql\include
POSTGRES_LIBRARY = c:\msys\local\pgsql\lib\libpq.dll
 
PostgreSQL has been "installed" in MSYS, just unpacking postgresql-8.2.4-1-binaries-no-installer.zip in c:\msys\local, as suggested by the wiki
 
GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR = c:\msys\local\grass-6.3.0RC4\include
 
that is the folder where i make installed grass

GRASS_PREFIX = C:\Programmi\qgis0.9.1\grass
 
I intended GRASS_PREFIX as the folder where I want to install grass for qgis plug-in
 
Actually, things are not very clear for me! :-(
I built qgis, without reported errors, but I don't find qgis0.9.0/grass folder!
 
Please, someone could shed some light?
 
The blank or not found entries in cmakesetup list (after configure in advanced mode) are:
 
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL

I forgot in the previous mail,
 
the POSTGRES item of the wiki (6.2.9) is not very clear; it says:
copy contents of pgsql directory from the archive to c:\msys\local
while in other points in the same wiki I find refrences to c:\msys\local\pgsql folder!
What should be the correct way?
 
Thanks,
 
Marco

Hi,
 
I deleted pgsql folder in c:\msys\local\pgsql, unpacked again postgresql-8.2.4-1-binaries-no-installer.zip in a temp folder, and then copied temp\pgsql content (only) in c:\msys\local. After that cmakesetup configures automatically finds postgres paths, as follows:
 
POSTGRES_INCLUDE_DIR = c:\msys\local\include
POSTGRES_LIBRARY = c:\msys\local\lib\libpq.dll
 
however, I didn't solve yey the problem with grass vars; Now I try with:
 
GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR = c:\msys\local\grass-6.3.0RC4\include
GRASS_PREFIX = c:\msys\local\grass-6.3.0RC4
 
intending GRASS_PREFIX as the folder where I "made installed" grass from source;
 
anyway, I'm trying to understand FindGRASS.cmake in order to discover why cmake does not find grass.
 
Regards,
 
Marco

Right, postgres is being searched for in c:\msys\local\include - for
header file and c:\msys\local\lib - for library.

When searching for GRASS, it looks for some directories where it could
reside. The first attempt is to use user-specified GRASS_PREFIX,
second attempt is to use c:\msys\local prefix. You don't have to
specify GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR since it will be set automatically when
GRASS has been found.
During the search it looks for header file
(prefix)/include/grass/version.h and looks for several libraries in
(prefix)/lib - e.g. libgrass_gis.dll, libgrass_vect.dll and others.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update of release candidate 1 for project file
	upgrade
Message-ID: <479F6132.5000007@homann.se>

Hello,

Due to a misunderstanding, the version string for 0.9.2-rc1-Ganymede had 
a small error, making it impossible to do reliable revison upgrade of 
the project files.

The version string is written into project files, and it is compared to 
the running version of QGIS when reading projects. Depending on the 
version, some transformation takes place. The version string should have 
a format of "a.b.c-text", where only the integers a, b and c are 
involved in the revision comparisons.

The version string that I checked in one hour ago should work much 
better. I would appreciate if as many as possible could re-build 
packages, minimiznig problems in the future.

Thanks,
Magnus Homann

Message-ID: <479FA690.3070909@media.mit.edu>

Hi,

I'm not sure the best place to post this, so apologies if this isn't the
right forum.  I found and fixed a bug in QgsPostgresProvider.  The bug
occurs when you make two providers that access the same table, and then
try to iterate through the features in each provider in a nested loop.
The provider in the inner loop would never have any features because all
providers use the same cursor name so things would get messed up.

I fixed the bug by adding a providerId member to QgsPostgresProvider,
and appending the id to all cursor names.  The patch is attached,
against version 8091 of https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis.

I have written some notes on teh best way to submit patches:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersManual

Its worth having a general read through that document, and also
looking at section 2.6 in particular for details on the preferred
patch procedure.

Once again thanks for your patch and we will welcome any more!

Regards

Hi all,

After a deep research, I found the projetct CGAL, wich provides 
geometrical algorithm : voronoi diagram, convex hull, triangulation, etc.
http://www.cgal.org/
They provide python bindings too ( http://cgal-python.gforge.inria.fr/ )
Do you think this could be used in qgis ? Or do you think the grass 
tools a sufficent ?

Hi Micha?l,

Basically, QGIS plugins are free to link to any libraries they want (as far as 
there is no license problem). So no problem if you intend to create analysis 
plugins for QGIS that are linked to the CGAL library.

In my opinion, the advantage of these 'native' plugins over GRASS plugins 
would be that data does not need to be converted if it is not already in 
GRASS format. The disadvantage of course is that they need to be done before 
they can be used, while the GRASS plugin exists and provides a large number 
of excellent analysis methods.

But there is in principal no reason why GRASS plugins and other analysis 
plugins may exist at the same time.

Regards,
Marco

Hi

Wow! That lib looks really impressive. Once QGIS 1.0 is out the way we
can start to look more seriously at creating these types of functions
in the core of QGIS.

It does not look that these algorithms are implemented as
free software.

Impressive indeed
For example, try (under windows) the demo of alpha shape (which we can 
use to find concave hull of a set of points :
http://www.cgal.org/demo/alpha_shapes_2.zip)

I had the idea looking the pyrol tools plugin under OpenJump which 
provide delaunay triangulation, iso lines, terrain modeling, etc.
(see : http://openjump.org/wiki/show/Plugins)

I think native function under qgis will be a big step (for those who do 
not want to create grass vector layers from existing ones)
In the same direction, I "almost" finished a simple convex hull plugin 
for qgis (using the python bindings).

I also posted before to ask the list about intersection functionnality 
under qgis, and I think it is "simple" to develop a layer intersection 
plugin too. My pbm : too many ideas and few time  :-)

For the CGAL implementation under qgis, I think it is above my skill now 
(I tried to use the python binding in a console, import successfully the 
dll, but could not see how to use the functions :-(

Message-ID: <FBCMMO02R1n5fmpPqbr0000b716@FBCMMO02.fbc.local>

Hi,
 
thank you all for bearing me with my massive e-mailing in the last days...
 
As I told you in the previous mail, I built and installed qgis 0.9.1; because I don't know what files need to be copied into qgis install directory, I decided to test the build adding c:\msys\local\ bin + lib and ...\grass-6.3.0RC4\ bin + lib into my path environmental variable; I launched qgis.exe, but it reports the following error:
 
procedure entry point X509_STORE_set_flags could not be located in the dynamic link library libeay32.dll
 
I read somewhere googling that could be a problem of libeay32.dll version used in postgresql; so I updated my msys environment installing latest pgsql release (the wiki suggests 8.2.4-1, while I downloaded and copied 8.2.6-1)... but I've got the same error! then I looked for libeay32.dll in my system and I found a lot of! is it possible that, not having the dll in its root and looking for it in %path% values it uses the wrong one? which is the correct dll, the one included in ..\msys\local\... by postgresql or the one in windows\system32?
 
Thanks
 
Marco

Message-ID: <FBCMMO036EZvLohpyX70000f65a@FBCMMO03.fbc.local>

Hi all,
 
I'm really afraid to repropose you the same problem again, but I'm not able to solve it!
I built qgis 0.9.1 and installed in programs folder\qgis0.9.1 (as default in cmakesetup). The only thing I had to set was grass prefix, because it was blank by default. After that it automatically sets grass include path (previoulsy not found) and lib_path (previously blank). Then I set cmake_build_type=Release and pressed OK.
After make and make install I have (correctly) qgis0.9.1 in my programs folder, but a lot of files are missing!
I checked it out with a fresh install of qgis0.9.1, made by windows install package; in qgis0.9.1 built and installed dir I miss al lot of *.exe and *.dll, in grass folder I have only grass plug-in files, in python lots of files are missing...
Now I'm making a list of files in Quantum GIS folder (installed by package) and checking out which files miss in built version and if those files are somewhere in my msys environment (local\bin, local\lib, grass-6.3.0RC4\bin or lib...) or if I need to copy them from Quantum GIS folder.
 
Anyway. I made my own msys enviroment with some updates respect to the actual wiki instructions, particularly I built latest RC version of grass (6.3.0RC4). Could it be useful for you? if you want I can give you a detalied document of all the updates respect to the actual wiki and upload an archive of the whole msys environment.
 
Thanks for your support.
 
Marco

Hi All,

I want to write the plugin I requested at [1] myself. In spite of having read various howtos, guides and experimenting alot I'm still not progressing much (no Python nor QT experience before). I need a hand in my first steps. That would be very appreciated.

What I need to get started:

0. Reproduce, in Python, the interface that "Add PostGIS Table(s)" provides (qgsdbsourceselectbase.ui).

I've been unable to, so far. Is there anyone willing to do it? Even a part of it would be great - the connection selector, working "Connect" and "Edit" buttons. If I had these, I would figure out how to proceed with the rest of the interface and more, including:

1. In this dialog add buttons "New", "Delete", "Modify" next to "Add", for respectively, creating a new layer, deleting a selected layer, modyfing attributes of an existing one. All greyed out until a connection to a database is established and a schema, or a layer in the schema, is selected on the list.

2. On pressing the "New" button, a new dialog pops up. It would be based on the "New Vector Layer" (qgsgeomtypedialogbase.ui). A "SRID" selector would be added, at minimum like in the SPIT plugin (qgsspitbase.ui). It would be better though if the "SRID" dialog would be designed so that the user can select from QGIS database of projections (I'll try). The "geometry column name" would default to "wkb_geometry", and let the user enter another name if needed (alike SPIT).

3. Following geometry types would be possible: multipoint, multilinestring, multipolygon. Their "simple" versions (point, linestring, polygon) are not necessary I guess - multi* types can be used to represent any "simple" features too, while they have their added value (eg. you can't "Add Island" to a PostGIS polygon, only to multipolygon) - how do you think?. Is it worth including geometrycollections too?

4. Following attribute types would be available: boolean; Numeric: all; Character: varchar(n), text; Date: all without the time zone (ie. date, time, timestamp, interval). The menu would be based on qgsaddattrdialogbase.ui.

5. On pressing the "Delete", a confirmation dialog would pop up.

6. "Modify" button - TBD later.

The 0 point a show stopper.

Looking forward to your help. If I succeed the plugin is of course going to be published under GPL.

Hi all,

I'm a new here, so first a big thank to all qgis developers!

Now a small issue: I was happily using qgis compiled from svn one
month ago on gutsy 64bit when today I did the following:


cd /home/ale/dev/cpp/qgis/build
cd ..
svn up
cd build
make clean
make
sudo make install

The build went fine, but now I see this message in a popup at startup:

Couldn't load QGIS bindings.
Python support will be disabled.

>From a pyton console this works fine:

>>> from qgis import *


Please note that qgis python bindings were working fine with svn built
just before christmas.

Any hint?

Hi,

I would like to draw arrows on line strings, since they represent 
movement vectors and I want to show the direction of movement.  I 
couldn't find any way to do that in the gui or any obvious way in the 
programmatic API.  What's the best way to add this feature or is it 
there already somewhere?

Thanks,

Hi Stefanie

Its been requested a few times but thus far no one has had time to
implement it. To add it would require adding a bit of logic in
qgsvectorlayer to overdraw an arrow onto a line once it has been
renderered (Qt doesnt provide any flow style line styles). Magnus
Homann has just done similar work for point symbols. If you would like
to do this work yourself it would be most welcome and we can certainly
try to help as needed. Others may be interested to help so do let us
know if you plan to start such work - it will also help to prevent
duplication of effort.

Best regards

Tim

  Just clarify to us that you aren't trying to redo this from scratch?

You can generate python from a .ui file, and then you just need to add 
signal code and call it.

  You use the pyuic (or pyuic4) command to convert the .ui to a .py:

  % pyuic qgsdbsourceselectbase.ui > qgsdbsourceselectbase.py

  Then the following little snippet shows you how to use the .py in a 
dialog in python code:

from qgsdbsourceselectbase import Ui_QgsDbSourceSelectBase

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

class Dialog(QDialog, Ui_QgsDbSourceSelectBase):
     def __init__(self, iface):
         QDialog.__init__(self)
         self.iface=iface
         # Set up the user interface from Designer.
         self.setupUi(self)

app=QApplication([])

dialog=Dialog(app)
dialog.exec_()

  This dialog does nothing because no slots or signals are connected. If 
you look in the C code you'll see which signals and slots are connected.

  For example, there's a bunch of 'autoconnected' slots which are 
connected to GUI objects (buttons and so on) such as:

// Slot for adding a new connection
void QgsDbSourceSelect::on_btnNew_clicked()
{
   addNewConnection();
}

  - so that when the 'New' button is clicked it calls the 
addNewConnection method. In Python code this would be a method in the 
Dialog class above, like:

   def on_btnNew_clicked(self):
     self.addNewConnection()

  and then you have to write the addNewConnection method as well.

Now, I'm not sure if this autoconnected slot business works in Python...

  If you want to explicitly connect a signal to a slot then you need to 
set it up in the __init__ method of the Dialog class. When a user 
interacts with a dialog, signals are sent out, and those signals can be 
connected to 'slots' which are methods. For example this code calls the 
'changed()' method when the layerList object emits the 
'currentItemChanged' signal:

QObject.connect(self.layerList, 
SIGNAL("currentItemChanged(QListWidgetItem*, QListWidgetItem*)"), 
self.changed)

  - then in the changed() method I can do something whenever the user 
picks a new layer in a list of layers.

  I'm not sure how much of this wiring you need to do in the interface, 
it's normally a case of reacting to button presses.

  The C++ code of QGIS is pretty darn fine, and is a good way to learn 
about Qt's signals and slots, and its also quite easy to translate to 
python.

  I can't rattle on about this any longer! Hope this helps.

Hi,

since QGIS uses GEOS library, we'd like to use primarily facilities
that we have there - it includes probably all the basic geometry
operators - so you can test geometries for relations (contains,
intersects ...) and do some geoprocessing (convex hull, buffer, union,
difference ...). Later when we start implementing some more advanced
vector analysis in QGIS core library we can start thinking of what
library to use (or whether to implement the algorihms directly).

But in meanwhile it shouldn't be very hard to create a plugin that
would use some external library like CGAL.

To determine which files are needed for a particular .dll or .exe you
can use Dependency walker. In iterations you can g
http://www.dependencywalker.com/

Here's the list of additional dlls I have in my installation. But the
amount depends on which optional parts you've compiled (e.g.
postgresql support, grass support, ..) and also what all formats does
your GDAL installation support.

comerr32.dll
krb5_32.dll
libexpat-1.dll
libgdal.dll
libgeos-2.dll
libgrass_*.dll
libiconv-2.dll
libintl-2.dll
libpng.dll
libpq.dll
libproj.dll
libz.dll.1.2.3
libz.dll.1.2.3.dll
mingwm10.dll
Qt3Support4.dll
QtCore4.dll
QtGui4.dll
QtNetwork4.dll
QtSql4.dll
QtSvg4.dll
QtXml4.dll
sqlite3.dll

Moreover for grass: libgrass_*.dll

Yes, please! This is really welcome. The best way how to contribute is
to edit INSTALL.t2t file from SVN, create a patch and file a ticket
with it in Trac: https://svn.qgis.org/trac

I had a vague idea to redo the rendering logic to make it more 
pluggable, so that it would be easier to write your own renderers. I 
also had a an idea to write a vector renderer, which wouldn't be very 
hard at all. But right now, I think we should wait for the render 
mechanism to improve.

We also ahve to do some benchmarking and speed optimization on rendering.

Hi,

I don't understand this well... if QGIS says that it couldn't load
bindings, you can't open python console in it. Or are you referring to
python console run from shell?

Well, for me it works :)
Can you give some more details? like what installation path you use
for QGIS, what version of python (haven't you installed a newer
version recently?) etc.

Currently QGIS renderers work in a way that they just set some
properties for painting and let the vector layer to draw the polyline,
so it's not possible to create a renderer which would e.g. render
arrows in the direction of the flow. We should allow renderers to do
arbitrary drawing in future.

Now it will be more complicated to acquire this effect: you can
generate some points (e.g. in the middle of every line segment) and
determine the angle of direction. Such generated vector layer with
points you can load to map canvas and for rendering set a SVG symbol
with an arrow and set rotation field appropriately to the field you've
generated.

So I proceeded a bit. I have the following now:

1. __init__.py [1]

2. qgsdbsourceselectbase.py [2] (pyuic4 output)

3. resources.py [3] (pyrcc4 output)

4. qgispostgis.py [4] (my "code")

I put all the files into 
/usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins/qgis_postgis. The plugin 
loads/unloads fine, the icon, mouse hover and "what's this?" work. The 
self.action prints "Whatever." to the terminal as it should.

Now what do I do to make the qgsdbsourceselectbase.py GUI spawn instead 
of printing "Whatever."? I looked at other scripts but I'm still 
stucked. Please bear with me another email or two.

A question -
Why reimplement  the entire postgis dialog in Python? It would be  
easier to create a plugin that creates a new layer rather than  
duplicate functionality already in the application.

What is the spqr plugin and where did you get it?
