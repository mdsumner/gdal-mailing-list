Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Scale/Magnifier/Units per pixel
Message-ID: <CAEDrt3-9PHUBcXKYnUGM0Ov1DHcMaFX0KSCQt0yRcN94QvBpog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was examining the Scale/Magnifier widget in QGIS3.

I couldn't find any difference in the output picture between the following
combinations (example):
Scale 1:1,000 and magnifier 1000%
Scale 1:10,000 and magnifier 100%
Scale 1:100,000 and magnifier 10%
Is this by design ?

I was expecting a different results, for instance, if I load OSM, and I
change the magnifier while the scale is fixed I was expecting to see the
same rendered image, just smaller/larger (i.e. same map features, no new
labels/roads etc.)

Also, is there an option to set the resolution in Map Units per pixel, i.e.:
Meters Per Pixels (when the units are meters, as in UTM) or
Degrees/Seconds per pixel (when the units are Degrees, as in Geographic) ?

I guess it makes more sense for most people to use Scale, but when I want
to examine specific pixels of a raster usually it's easier for me to think
in Meters Per Pixels in respect to the Map Units, for instance, when I know
that my map is in 10 Meters per pixel, then if I set the Map canvas
resolution to the same value of 10 Meters per pixel I expect to see the
pixels in 1:1 as one pixel on the raster is one pixel on the map canvas.

Regards,
Idan.

Hi all,
now that 2.18 is LTR I guess that many have also updated their QGIS
Server installation to this release. Problem is that I see a few
issues in 2.18 and would like to have gsome feedback from others.

*) slower: it seems this version is slower compared to 2.14, at least
for some specific request like WFS GetFeatures. See for example:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18249#note-1

where in the same condition (same server, same postgis datasource of
around ~25000 polygons) 2.18 is about 30 seconds slower than 2.14.


*) At some point in 2.18 development -in the print composer,
properties of a legend- the "none" value for the "map" option was
removed. This option (together with "auto update" unchecked) allowed
to do GetPrint requests where a legend always shown the same fixed
entries regardless of the layers being requested. Moreover now the
layers legend (from a GetPrint) frequently shows "?" instead of the
correct legend. Not sure if the two things are related.


*) Crashes on GetPrint: adding some type of elements in print
composers (like html text boxes) caused QGIS Server to crash when
doing a GetPrint *if* the *headless* server didn't had a fake xserver
installed. Now in 2.18 this happens even if QGIS Server is installed
on a Desktop OS, unless installing the fake x server. Not sure is
related but this now affects also Windows machines where a GetPrint
requests (of a layout with one of this problematic elements) make
always QGIS Server crash. This was not the case for 2.14.


thanks in advance for the feedback

cheers

This issue is simply due to the transformation of the geometry from the 
layer CRS to the GeoJSON CRS standard: EPSG:4326

It will be great to have the possibility to allow nullptr in the map 
combobox.
Nyall, do you have an idea how to enhance QgsComposerItemComboBox 
introdiuced by 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/1b4bd47076103e931e642c9c2b6a363f14b20a45?
Issue already exists: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16899

The solution is probably to update the environment variable 
QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM to 'raster' has explain 
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15440 and in a lot of other project:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6168570/qgraphicsview-slow-scale-performance-under-linux
https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?t=90821

I'll test this solution.

Yes this expected. The idea of the magnifier is for having a "magnifier
glass" to do scale-dependent editing. In my scenario, that was useful for
fine-placement of labels.
But if you don't have scale-dependent rendering (mainly labels I guess) or
using map units instead of points for symology, it won't (shouldn't) change
anything.

well, if you magnify with a fixed scale that will change the extent, you
can't see as much features in the map.

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+aGE14LskFNHGUR0SEReWqCrjNU5iCkgN06uSQk9Jr4LA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

If I set a virtual field with the vertex count (i.e. num_points(  $geometry
) ), it does not consider changes in the edit buffer.
In other words, I have to commit the changes so the expression is correct.

Is this an expected behavior?
I would have expect to be updated directly.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Denis,

Thanks for your reply!
I think I was expecting the behaviour that you described.

As far as I understand, in OSM there are scale dependent features, for
instance smaller streets, more labels, that won't show up in larger scale
for the same extent. That's why I was expecting that when I use the
'magnifying glass'  there won't be any new features showing up at the same
extent, i.e. smaller streets or more labels. But there are, same as if I've
changed the scale.

Kind regards,
Idan

Message-ID: <CAKT=1=AoUQD1XrjXsrwkqgJmk2QYgZznYNg-YZd5qmHiOh5t_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to export a layout of 600x600mm at 600dpi (14173x14173 px) on a
Linux 64bits system with 4go of memory and 2go of swap, but I raise a
memory overflow error (bad allocation). The map contains lot of layers, svg
symbols, labels, custom functions... I'm curious of the origin of this
limitation, is it because the entire image must be contained into memory ?
(I thought the picture was written gradually by block) or this is
potentially something else? Is there any workaround hack to bypass this
limitation without just increase the memory capacity of my system? Anyone
else has already encountered this problem on 64bits system?

Thanks in advance for any information.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjE_jLce6wd_h4G2hhoAbWsZpbUJeuFRXdmP0fkrbj16Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

While investigating Anita's "most annoying issue",
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14752 I've tracked this down to certain
calls to geos functions crashing on Windows builds alone.

The situation is that the geos exception handler, throwGEOSException
is correctly called, which triggers a  "throw GEOSException" call. The
exception *should* be caught... indeed it's wrapped in suitable
try/catch blocks, and it works correctly on all other platforms. But
not on the msvc  Windows builds.

For some reason the msvc builds just ignore the catch and crash with
an unhandled exception. It's very odd, and I can't work out why it
works correctly for some GEOSExceptions yet not others. My searching
hasn't turned up any tricky issues with msvc exception handling
either...

It's reproducable using the qgis_expressiontest unit test -- when
running on Windows this will crash with a call to
QgsGeos::lineLocatePoint, where an exception thrown within
GEOSProject_r is not correctly caught.

Long story short - I'm out of ideas here, yet it's quite a serious
issue which has plagued QGIS since at least 2.14.

Do we have any msvc gurus with any idea what could be the cause of this?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

I know there are some issues when an exception is thrown from a DLL
compiled with a different runtime version (i.e. different compiler
version) than the DLL/EXE trying to catch it.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5107948/throwing-c-exceptions-across-dll-boundaries

Could it be the case between geos and qgis ?

Message-ID: <CAL5Q670aKKURbXwPq_gTU7+sMMym9XxxhgHq7Jf64kk=EaGg2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Please have a look to
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/114
for a new joint proposal (by myself and Nyall) covering proposed changes to
allow in-place geometries modifications from a processing algorithm.

This will allow for suitable processing algorithms to be executed on the
selected features of an editable layer and modify features in place without
the need to specify an input and output layer.

Comments and suggestions welcome!

Maybe.  Although the exception is thrown from the same DLL, there's stuff from
others on the stack.

The GEOS C-API should probably be changed to catch the exception within the C
wrappers and return errors instead to fix this.

too bad we break stuff in minor releases, but such is life. aren't our
test enough to spot these regressions? anything we can do to improve
them? maybe better to downgrade this version from the repo, while
waiting for a fix?
all the best, and thanks for pointing this out.

Nope.

We had a (private) discussion about it during latest hackfest, and Borys
(in bcc) hopes to be able to address this as part of the plugins install
overhaul.

As the discussion (2014?), you are pointing to, mentions pip and virtual
env's: just yesterday I stumbled upon pipenv [0][1]. Not sure if that
could be helpful, but apparently it is  a pip-virtualenv marriage...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ps, maybe good to start a QEP [2] to discuss this?

Nyall did some review and there was one last issue in one of the code
snippet (not included in this PR)
I had explained that also in github. and I think its ready to be merged.

I will sync this PR with master if someone is willing to merge.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Overlay Intersect of 2-Esri Shapfiles
Message-ID: <1520007745104-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I want to write a script in Python to perform an operation between two ESRI
shapefiles. 
1. One shapefile (*overlay*), Ownership, containing one or more polygons. 
2. 2nd shapefile (*Input*), may be Points, Lines, or Polygons 

The script would find all Input shapes that are "touching" (*wholly or
partially within*) any of the Ownership polygons (*overlay*).  All features
that are touching the input shape, would then be written out to a new a new
shape. 

I've been learning about the OGR/GDAL library, so I know about code like
this: 
        doesIntersect = ownershipPoly.Intersects(inputFeature) 

However, I am still fairly new to Python-based GIS work, so I'm still
learning about the various libraries that are available. Is the above
OGR/GDAL code the most efficient way to do it or is there something else
more appropriate? 

Jeff

Hi,

playing around for a new plugin release, I tested the pyqgis cookbook
rubber band example. I'd like to be able to access the drawn rubberbands
outside of the calling functions without passing around objects. So some
equivalent to mapCanvas().mapLayers() for rubber bands would be cool. Is
there some container in iface that I can query?

Thanks

But in this case the exception is raised by QGIS itself - not geos.
Geos is just calling the QGIS throwGEOSException function, which
throws the GEOSException.

Or am I missing something here?

I don't think I've said it enough, but for me the magnifier was a huge
boost in creating nice cartography with QGIS. It (together with the
style dock) has become one of those features which I use every day
when making maps.

So thank you Denis and Paul for implementing this lovely feature!

I'm not sure if it's an issue with my projecta account, but I can't
access the "pending entries" page for 3.2. I get a "changelog.qgis.org
redirected you too many times" error.

Is this a known issue?

Thanks Nyall.

There is a remaining issue though
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17695

I think the implementation was not perfect, and I guess should belong to
the map settings rather than the canvas.
I tried to fix it for 3.0 but failed.

Cheers,
Denis

No its not a know issue and its not raising anything on sentry for us either. I approved the pending entries, if it does it again please ping me and I will get one of my team to take a look.

By the way we are going to get rid of the the moderation thing - it causes more hassles than it is worth and we will just trust everyone who has been put into the ‘changelog managers’ group on our platform.

No, it did come up, maybe on chat? Someone investigated (Richard?), but I
can't remember what the outcome was.

Well, yes it is, all 'normal' users have this, Etienne is aware of it.
That is the reason I made Regis 'manager', as it is the only way to not
being redirected. Adding permissions to a normal user do not fix this.

I agree that the 'pending/moderation' stuff is causing more issues.

Richard

The new main version has finally addressed the needed upgrade of python
(2->3) and Qt (4->5) but also abandoned the idea of QGIS as a simple viewer
that acquires editing abilities by plugins. Plugins are not anymore needed
for several tasks and require sometimes a major upgrade, because of the
transition to python 3.
As the road map shows that the LTR version will rely on version 2 for a
fairly long time, what about letting it live in a separate namespace as to
let the two versions coexist, keeping the needed version 2 plugins for the
LTR?

Not sure if you would call it a 'namespace', but by using the right
values for
*qgisMinimumVersion*
and
*qgisMaximumVersion*
the plugins.qgis.org site can host both plugin versions at the same time.

Personally I host one of my plugins separate for the 2.x branch and 3.x
branch.

If you use
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
qgisMaximumVersion=3.99
your plugin will only be visible in 3.x

qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
qgisMaximumVersion=2.99
makes it only visible in 2.x

both versions can coexist on plugins.qgis.org

Richard Duivenvoorde

@Nathan: Yes, to be precise, I mean calling using a different name, say
qgis2 or qgis_ltr and using /usr/lib/libqgis2* instead
of /usr/lib/libqgis*, /usr/lib/qgis2 or /usr/lib/qgis-ltr,
/usr/share/qgis2, /usr/include/qgis2 instead of /usr/include/qgis,

@Richard: That's very good, I overlooked this feature. Anyway, I think the
casual user will never know and while working perfectly on the repository,
it needs two separate directory, say .qgis2 and .qgis3. Not difficult but
it should be easier for users to deal with these issues.

Anyway, thanks for considering this suggestion.

Hey Carlo,

Right I guess the first one is a package issue for unix type installs. On
Windows this is fine as we can run different versions all the time but is a
good point for Linux, etc.

Regarding .qgis2 and .qgis3 This is already isolated in QGIS 3 as the
settings and plugins are now all stored in the appdata folder for the user
along with a folder for each project.  Use Settings -> User Profile  to see
what I mean.  This means you can run QGIS 2 and 3 and they don't mess each
others settings etc up.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Richard, 

Let me clarify: Usually you should only set the qgisMinimumVersion. If it is set to 3.0, it is 
assumed the plugin is compatible with any QGIS 3, thus from *2.99* up to *3.98* (please 
note QGIS x.99 has API for the next version!)

By setting explicitly qgisMaximumVersion=3.99 you only bump up the upper range from 
3.98 to 3.99. This tag should only be used if the upper range is unusual, for example for 
plugins compatible with both QGIS 3 and 4: minimum=3.5 and maximium=4.98

Regards,
Borys

Was that ever a goal?  If so, I didn't know - but I have been around only for a
bit more than 10 years ;)

Yeah I think the idea of being a full fledged GIS rather than a simple viewer has been with us for many years already….glad to see it is really taking hold with 3.0 though :-) Great to have your inputs Carlo.

No pun intended, when you announced what you were going to do, I used
MapInfo as my main GIS and Thuban as a viewer and I hoped very much you
were starting something that was went further.
Since version 0.11 I was using QGIS as my "main" GIS. What I was saying is
that the continuous improvement made all users rely on a dependable QGIS.
Departing from a cautious approach to a very fast development pace means
users can keep an LTR for day to day working (no advanced needs) and an
"evolution" approach for the advanced features. I didn't think that saying
"viewer" I diminished the huge effort of these years. The "viewer" approach
is still a plus of QGIS and it's not something easy to accomplish if I see
the work on Processing and what has been done for GRASS. I think being a
"viewer" for GDAL means getting all of the benefits of an evolving project.
This has its drawbacks, some processing that is needed at the feature level
was available only on layers as a whole. I meant that, the last major
version is a further step that asks for more dependability.
My apologies for all the developers who felt injured by my words.

Hey Carlo,

I guess we are a bit confused at the moment because the goal of QGIS has
never really been that at all, at least not post v1.  We have always aimed
to make it the best it can be for a lot of different workflows.

I'm not sure I would consider anything in QGIS a step backwords at all,
There has been a crazy, and I mean crazy, amount of dev work to create a
better product for end users.

Not so much to pull, but more to discuss. Please add comments there.

Hi

I can't figure where the the "enable additional providers" option is located in Qgis 3 ? 

Or there is another way to enable providers from plugins ?

Guys,

Unfortunately all I can do now is to book the necessary time this autumn. First I have to 
address a few bugfixes in my badly limited time for QGIS.
If nobody makes the QEP before, I'll come back to it after the summer.

Regards,
Borys

I wouldn't do it this way -- it was the hidden nature of the original
support for setting no linked map which led to it being broken (also,
no unit tests -- the combination of a non-obvious reuse of an existing
widget + no unit tests is basically asking for something to break).

I'd suggest instead adding an explicit checkbox here for "always show
all layers for server requests" (but better wording!), under a new
"server settings" group. And a unit test ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing Help, what next?
Message-ID: <1c6f548a-8691-41fe-f80b-f45614f0c20a@faunalia.eu>

Hi all,

as you know, after big efforts from lots of people (both devs and doc
writers/reviewers) QGIS Processing algorithms have been well documented
on the website and they are available with the Help button of the dialog.

https://docs.qgis.org/3.0/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/index.html

IMHO we have to set up some points to not loose this work for all the
future development, next a list of ideas/wishes/..:

* [doc side] open an issue with the label "Processing Help" when
something changes for a Processing alg, or if a new algorithm is
created/removed
* [doc side] assign this issue to someone (I'm available to handle this)
* [doc side] I'm going to add a more specific section of the
Documentation Guidelines for Processing Docs
* with many people I've spoken, the current layout of the docs is
"ugly": lot of white space through the sections, changing some colors?..
some suggestions are more than welcome
* currently, clicking on the Help button points to the correct algorithm
because I've manually added the sphinx anchor = algorithm unique name.
So it is **mandatory** to have information (or better an automatic
mechanism?!) that writes the correct anchor in sphinx if the name changes
* other ideas?

Thanks to all the people that worked on that, I think that having a
documentation bucket is really a good news for users!

Cheers and thanks for any feedback

Hi Devs,

Starting with a QGIS3 plugin which needs to retrieve data from REST
server with a simple Basic Authentication scheme.

Looking into:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/authentication.html#term-authentication-method

But this is old code, eg: QgsAuthManager.instance() is not there anymore?

Anybody pointers to QGIS3 code to use QgsAuthManager, preferably with
use of QgsNetworkManager?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ah, thanks Ale, got that working; ... if I have a Authentication
Configuration in my config with given key.

Is there (still) a way to force users to give username/password, and
just use it for given session

Or should the user always go through QgsAuthConfigSelect().show() to
- first set a master keyword if not set yet on db
- create a Authentication config by pressing the plus-sign?

Isn't this dialog (see attached screenie) not to intimidating for
average user?

Thanks for given input.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

it's up to you, you can also create an authentication configuration
programmatically from python, i.e. create a simple username/password
dialog, check if the credentials are valid and then create an
authentication configuration and store it in the authentication DB.

Also, store the authcfg id (not the credentials!) into your plugin settings
and use that one for all subsequent calls.

There should be an example (for 2.x but the auth stuff has'n changed):
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/lib-qgis-commons/blob/master/qgiscommons2/network/oauth2.py#L89

In QGIS 3 all the auth GUI dialogs are wrapped in ptyhon so that you can
use them directly.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Discussing qgd files
Message-ID: <e0a295a41200b18bc6824b0291e7f2d9@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS 3 there is always a qgd file created alongside with QGIS
projects. I heard that they are used as auxilliary file to store project
specific labels - right? 

So far fine - but why are these files always created, even if the file
isn't used? Couldn't we create them on demand when they are really
needed? Currently, they are always created. I almost never use this
feature - yet these files are always created. 

I would assume that these extra files are a source of confusion to our
users - and if the project is renamed - most likely they don't know that
this file belongs to the same project and should be renamed as well -
almost as bad as with shapefiles ... 

Thanks for your thoughts on this matter, 

Andreas

Hi QGIS devs,

some time ago I took care about maintaining GRASS packages in
UbuntuGIS project (unstable and experimental PPAs - currently I am
working on new QGIS 2.18 packages, see ubuntugis-experimental). It
also includes related gdal-grass and qgis packages [1]. QGIS packages
are maintained transparently in git repo [2] (ubuntu/trusty + xenial)
branches. It would be nice to join forces. QGIS now offers its own PPA
with ubuntugis dependency [3]. I see two options:

* promote UbuntuGIS Unstable (which contains fresh versions)
* copy packages from UbuntuGIS unstable to your PPA (or in opposite direction).

The most important would be to maintain packages in same git repo [2].

What do you think? Best, Martin

No likely to happen. The upstream packaging is separate from the one in 
Debian and Ubuntu, and by extension in UbuntuGIS.

The oracle changes in the upstream package are not appropriate for 
UbuntuGIS for example.

I'd rather see UbuntuGIS disappear and have people working on 
maintaining proper backports in Ubuntu itself in collaboration with 
maintainers in Debian.

But due to the lack of manpower the status quo is most likely to remain.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I maintained qgis in ubuntugis until we started two release lines with the ltr.
We now maintain several repositories with ubuntugis packages: with the actual
release of the latest release and the ltr, nighties of the two releases
branches (previews of the next point release) and master.

Hi Andreas,
Good point indeed.
In fact, the first implementations where created the database only when
needed and were also spatialite. It was slowing down a lot the workflow,
but now you raise the point, I think this was more linked to the spatialite
db creation time. I'll ask Paul if creating the sqlite .qgd file can only
be done when first required.

Another point, we kept the qgz format optional, but I think that in the
end, we probably should discuss if this is not too complicated. We could
switch to qgz as default format, so that users see only one file, don't get
bothered with qgd or any associated file anymore.
Thoughts?

Hi Régis,

Thanks for asking Paul to see if the .qgd files can be created only "on 
demand" when necessary.

If there aren't any performance problems with .qgz in comparison with 
.qgs files, then I would be fine switching to the zipped version by default.

Andreas

Hi all,

Please see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/115

for a proposal regarding extending QgsProject to allow storage of
project-level metadata, and their use in layout exports and expression
functions.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] license requirements for QGIS plugin
Message-ID: <CAExk7p0C1xLwjk5x2VvufBmptsN3U=XeAnOo4+2713nS+OCU2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

We tried our best to convince some partners to base some of their work on
QGIS, but they are not ready for open-source yet.

Thus, I started looking into license requirements for QGIS plugins. But the
more I read, the more I get confused.

I found this blog post [1] which very clearly states plugins must comply to
GPL-2.
This is confirmed by the gpl faq [2] since I think a QGIS plugin and QGIS
have a fairly "intimate" relationship in terms of "exchanging complex data
structures back and forth" (sounds hot :-D ).

Then, I found this [3] saying it's possible to use closed external tools,
such as file based exchanges from/to external applications.

So if they build a GPL-licensed plugin calling a proprietary executable,
how external would that latter executable need to be to comply to GPL ?
- could it be shipped with the plugin, in the plugin repo ?
- if not, could it be dynamically downloaded by the plugin in the
background ?
- if not, could it be downloaded by the plugin with some kind of user
interaction (e.g. copy/paste a link) ?
- if not, could it be manually downloaded by the user and placed somewhere ?

And then, as far as I understand GPL-2, the requirements only apply when
you distribute the software, which means you can keep all the code for
yourself. When is it considered that the software is distributed ?
- if they distribute it only to users inside their organization ?
- if they distribute it only to users from partner organizations ?
- if it's not considered distributed when it's done only internally, can
they have internal agreements to prevent internal users from distributing
the software ?

Thank you very much in advance for these clarifications !

And sorry if this is not the best place to ask basic GPL questions... But
the topic is very complex, and it seems integrating GPL/propritery software
is always an edge case. Maybe we could add some vulgarized information
about this in the pyqgis cookbook ?

Kind regards,

Olivier

my advice would be to seek advice from a lawyer: these are corner cases,
and only a lawyer can tell you what is acceptable or not. However:
* does your customer have to distribute the plugin? As you know, GPL
does not require it. If it's for internal use. then you have no
licencing issues
* we generally accept this kind of things up to a point, but I do not
think anybody here is particularly excited nor positive about this - I
personally tend to see this as stretching the licence to its limits, for
personal convenience.
All the best.

Maybe out of scope but I'd like to see an abstraction on top of QgsProject
to be able to load the project from different sources, for instance a REST
API, or a gpkg.

Haha. I was going to start prototyping this idea next week.  I will start a
QEP at some stage this week to collect ideas.

Hi all,

Mint computer. Before the 3.0 stable release I had not trouble when
following Martin's guide, now I get this error:

Message-ID: <CALzmt=T-1RpJ=pEBbi=+TX4yRjS8Ji362A57VzV3oqgNEpjQRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to build QGIS 3.0 in openSUSE Leap 42.3. I went through all
requirements and as far as I understand I have all the requirements
properly installed.

I nevertheless get this error consistently:

Building CXX object
src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/layertree/qgslayertreelayer.cpp.o
/usr/local/src/qgis-3.0.0/src/core/layertree/qgslayertreelayer.cpp: In
member function ‘void QgsLayerTreeLayer::attachToLayer()’:
/usr/local/src/qgis-3.0.0/src/core/layertree/qgslayertreelayer.cpp:72:94:
error: no matching function for call to
‘QgsLayerTreeLayer::connect(QPointer<QgsMapLayer>&, void

(QgsLayerTreeLayer::*)())’
   connect( mRef.layer, &QgsMapLayer::nameChanged, this,
&QgsLayerTreeLayer::layerNameChanged );

What could possibly be the source of this? I will be grateful if someone
can help pinpoint the cause.

The code I am trying to build is the latest source package (2018-02-23).

Thanks in advance

H.

yes, it does not violate GPL calling external executable

No, for two reasons.
1) no executable blobs are allowed in the main qgis plugin repo
2) should match executable redistribution policy of the executable

btw you can setup you own repo to distribute you plugin with executable blobs.
Here for example a plugin repo with a single plugin with a executabel
blob inside:
https://github.com/QTrafficmodel/QTrafficPluginRepository

Yes. I suggest to do it explicitly asking user permission and ask for
license agreement.

Yes

yes

AFAIK GPL2 is always applied, not only for distribution. It's a
Copyright => it's an author right.

I leave these unanswered... because it's a complex argument.

My experience is that:
1) commtter of a work have the right to access source code
2) publication have to be negotiated with committer (btw because it's
a GPL would be "fair" to have it published by default)
3) Internal agreement are commonly (and sadly if related with GPL)
used to avoid distribution.

for sure the argument is much more complex than here exposed.

that code lines are unchanged since (at least) 1yr. Can you check if a

Hi all,
in QGIS3 is there a way to import a whole existing project into an already loaded QGIS-Project (aka add all the Groups and Layers of a Project into an existing Project) within a Python-Script or Plugin?


Thanks in advance

Hi Devs,
   I noticed that QGIS customization (QGIS 2.18) doesn’t work as expected. My plugin has a big toolbar so I want to hide some buttons.
Using the customization dialog I set some buttons of my toolbar as “hide” but when I restart qgis these settings are lost.
It works with “core” plugins but it doesn’t with external python plugins like mine.
How can I solve ?
Thanks

Hi

I think this is because the plugin loads after the customisation is applied to the application on start up.

Why not implement this logic directly in your plugin?

Regards

Tim

Patience is a good virtue.
Sharing is another one.

Hi,

You're using the system spatialite while you should use the brew one.

After is my cmake output.

Good luck!

Hi,
   my opinion is that QGIS doesn’t write the settings for external python plugins but only for m…ToolBar.
QGIS saves only the visibility for whole a toolbar not for the single buttons of toolbar.
I can implement this logic directly in my plugin but what settings can I read if QGIS don't save them at all ?
Do you mean I have to create my own dialog to set the button visibility ?
Regards

Hi

Yes this is as I have explained - it is better that your plugin manages this I think. Could I ask you to Kindly keep the discussion on teh mailing list so that others may benefit from your eventual solution too?

Hi Tim,
   thanks for your reply.
I work on windows. After setting customization in QGIS and exiting from QGIS if you see the qgis registry as below

<image002.png>

Qgis doesn’t write the setting for external python plugin but only for m…ToolBar.
Infact restarting QGIS, if you run customization dialog the settings for the toolbar of external plugin are lost.

Hi

I think this is because the plugin loads after the customisation is applied to the application on start up.

Why not implement this logic directly in your plugin?

Hi Devs,
   I noticed that QGIS customization (QGIS 2.18) doesn’t work as expected. My plugin has a big toolbar so I want to hide some buttons.
Using the customization dialog I set some buttons of my toolbar as “hide” but when I restart qgis these settings are lost.
It works with “core” plugins but it doesn’t with external python plugins like mine.
How can I solve ?
Thanks

Dennis thanks for the reply, that issue was resolved by doing as you
suggested.
I however am completely unable to specify my SIP directory. There doesn't
seem to be any *cmake* parameters that allow me to point my PyQt5 SIP
directory.

I get
sip: Unable to find file "QtXml/QtXmlmod.sip"
make[2]: *** [python/core/sip_corepart0.cpp] Error 1
make[2]: *** Deleting file `python/core/sip_corepart0.cpp'

When my Qt5Xml_DIR *ccmake* var is located in:
/usr/local/opt/qt/lib/cmake/Qt5Xml

And my actualy sip files are located in:
/usr/local/Cellar/pyqt/5.10/share/sip/Qt5

Running *FindPyQt5.py* gives me this output:

pyqt_bin_dir:/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.4_3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin

The thing to point out is that I don't have a directory called
*/usr/local/share/sip*, only a Qt4 one: */usr/local/share/sip-qt4*. Should
I be creating a symlink pointing to that directory?

I have also tried this solution to no avail:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16034

Any suggestions on how to properly point to my PyQt5 directory would be a
huge help.

Thanks,
Mikhail

Sorry for not checking myself.  Are the qgd only written on project save?

Just asking because there's check to avoid overwritting a project that
meanwhile was changed by someone.  Are qgd implicitly covered by that check
too?

Uhuh, excellent question! I'll check that with Paul. As this is a sqlite
database, I think that we also have to check the file locking policy (
https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html)

A disruptive "moreover approach" suggests some reflection about the file
<vs> database approach.

I see several places where handling metadata in the database could provide
a better but possibly conflicting solution.
This happens for instance with styles stored on the database that may
easily be overwritten by opening a modified project (if you work alone it's
wonderful, but cooperating is a nightmare), but may happen also with any
other "intelligent" provision that uses XML and/or persistent storage.

I think this should not prevent a good solution about metadata. A map is
not made of several layers overlaid with their styles only, it's something
more and it's not completely satisfactory to reduce this to a project file
that helps a single user to keep working on it or store the printing styles
(sorry, I simplify too much, I know). Maybe QGD files are a starting point
to design a better solution because we are embracing a three level storage
system: files, light database (SQLite/Spatialite), DBMS (mainly
PostgreSQL/PostGIS, but even others). This solution could lead us to a
careful choice or to more flexibility (complexity?).

Maybe this further flexibility is needed. I raise a very peculiar case: we
work with historical maps and sometimes I georeference maps without being
certain about my sources, sometimes the source itself is made of parts that
ask two set of conflicting reference points for the same file. I'm forced
to make a symlink on the filesystem to have the same file georeferenced in
two ways. Why the different point sets cannot be stored on database? The
reference points are points on earth and frequently I need to reuse them
(what about adjacent tables? Maybe snapping on them could help), why not
storing them in the database?

QGIS Server is an amazing tool, but why using monolithic and completely
proprietary XML file while several other applications could benefit from
more generic metadata stored in the database? That is already done for
styles which store SLD values besides the Qt ones, but it could be extended
to other areas.

It's reasonable to blame my "moreover approach", but take what you think
QGIS could benefit of.

Hi,

Having a geocoder plugins, in 2.18 (still proj4), I can geocode my home
address, and reproject the epsg:28992 coordinate fine to epsg:3857.

But since last week Debian has proj5, and the same plugin (in QGIS
master) now is off by 500 meter.

To reproduce: if you have a QGIS 2.18 with proj4, and the
'pdokservicesplugin' geocode the zip+number: '2022zj 23' in for example
the osm xyz layer.
Now do the same in QGIS master with proj5 and you'll see it is not going
to the right/same position.

Another observation: IN 2.18 I can 'reproject' the OSM layer to for
example epsg:4326, and still see (little distorted) map.
But in QGIS3/proj5 I do not see a map anymore.

Anybody else seeing this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This is a known issue of proj 5.0.0.
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/834

 Will be fixed in proj 5.0.1 supposedly released around April

Ouch... Ok, thanks for the quick answer.

As we have OSM xyz layer now, and I think a lot of people will use it as
a quick reference map, we should be carefull to include proj5 in
distributions/installs then I think?

Like: let's not put proj5 as default in Osgeo4w untill this is
fixed/released.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, 

I am forwarding this from the user list - if this is really the case
that multi-column primary keys are violating the unique constraints of
"individual" fields, than I need we need to properly deal with such
cases. 

Multi-column pkeys are quite common in some data models. 

Any ideas how to fix/address this issue? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

  Hi everybody, 

  I´m testing QGIS 3.0 in Windows 10. I think I have found an error in
the "Add record" form when you are editing a PostgreSQL table without
geometry and the table primary key (PK) is composed of two fields (or
more) from the table. 

  I suppose QGIS thinks a PK field has to be unique, and that´s true for
most of the cases, but when you have a PK composed of more than one
field, is the combination of these fields what it has to be unique, not
the fields individually. Now, in QGIS 3.0, if you write a value for one
of the PK fields that it is already in the table, it doesn't let you
insert that value, even if the combination of the values that compound
the PK is unique. 

  I attach two screenshot:  
    -"Add record" button 
    -"Add record" form not letting you insert a value 

  Thanks in advance 

  Rafa

When distributions don't adopt proj 5.0.0 it won't get much real world 
usage and hence won't uncover other regressions that should be fixed in 
the next release.

There were many release candidates, but only a handful of testers.

OSGeo projects should get more involved testing new core library release 
candidates to catch regressions like these earlier.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I mostly agree:

/me running Debian sid is supposed to hit this. I'm ok with it.

But given we know this is an issue now, we should not distribute this
further to Windows users/osgeo4w who are NOT running a testing setup.

More testing is always better. But for users/end-users it is pretty hard
to keep testing all functionality in all packages used. These bugs just
hit you when you use them.

Richard

Matteo,

Which OS are you using?

I have similar problems trying to build QGIS 3 in openSUSE Leap 42.3. I
posted a question a few days back about that. I got an answer from Luigi,
saying that the lines of code where the error happened had not changed in
over a year, a hint that QGIS is not the problem.

Puzzled about the repeating error, and having installed and reinstalled all
thinkable dependencies and changed all options, I saw that I could without
problems build QGIS 2.18.17. I then came to the conclusion that the most
likely trouble is caused by misunderstandings in the coexistence between
Python 3 and 2, and QT 4 and 5 in my own OS installation. I mean that I am
not clearly telling the build where to find the libraries, and that I
possibly have a mix of versions in my computer.

I have not yet worked around this, but I am pretty convinced this is a
problem because I have seen these kind of errors in previous versions, in
those cases when I wasn't careful enough to tell the compiler to not use
Python 3 or QT 5.

Hope this helps.

H.

Or, good thing with open source, don't wait for official release and 
apply the patch that fixes the issue :

Hi,

I made a small PR yesterday - and accidentally added another small fix 
to it today. The PR is at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6556

The first change in the PR is a fix to translation (a string is changed 
before it is sent to tr) and the second change fixes a missing default 
to gdaldem color-relief processing (I suspect many more fixes like this 
needed to other gdal processing tools, see my old PR 4220)

I'm not very familiar with PRs, especially in a large project like QGIS. 
It seems to me that I should specifically ask the original authors of 
those sources I'm fixing to review the PR? And should I assume they will 
merge the PRs? The travis CI build seems to have failed checking my PR - 
but most likely the reason is not my PR but something else - how to check?

Lastly, these changes are very small, is PR the correct way to submit them?

Best,

Ari

yes, you did it right.

You can politely ask a developer to review your PR in a comment in your PR
but there is no guarantee that the developer will have time to review it.

Most developers go through the PR queue from time to time, but not every
developer is expert in all areas of the code.

You can check the failures on travis:
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/350755583?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification

Keep in mind that sometimes Travis fails for obscure reasons that are not
related to the PR, if this is the case closing and re-opening the PR will
trigger Travis again and if it was a temporary problem the tests will
eventually pass.

Btw, thanks for contributing to QGIS with your patches!

Hi Richard,

You can read my report to the PROJ team while I was testing the release 
candidates: 
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2018-February/008082.html 
Sorry, it is a long thread.  I was trying to prevent (this here in QGIS, 
for example) from happening, before the release.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issues building from source on Mac - No module
	named PyQt5
Message-ID: <CANSqz6M9jNXxvqgDSFVzuEGVrgPYv6EM4ip82+2wC5gSDUZX_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am having trouble building the QGIS release-3_0 branch on my Mac. I
finally got it to cmake, however I am getting an error during the make
process in which it seems that spatialite is using the system's Python(@2)
executable to find PyQT5 when in reality it should be looking for it in the
Python at 3 executable that has been given during CMAKE. I am guessing this is
what is causing the issue.

Please find the error at the bottom of this email. If anyone knows what I
am doing wrong, would you please let me know?

Thank you very much!
Tim

I added a MESSAGE to output the version and more of PyQt5, and it seems to
be exactly where I expect it to be. However, during make it is being looked
for using Python2.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Spatialite plugins broken on Macs?
Message-ID: <2d4e4f8b-4186-519e-8af1-a82288e91859@wildintellect.com>

All,

Ran a workshop yesterday where we used the DB Manager to interact with
Spatialite. On all the Macs in the room (10ish), all spatial queries and
data imports failed, the errors are mostly silent.

Installing QSpatialite to test, that plugin fails to find the spatialite
version.

This led me to the possibility that the QGIS packages for Mac packages
on Kyngchaos may be missing something, or have a configuration issue
related to where the pyspatialite library is located or referenced.

This appears to have been reported before:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/220870/qspatialite-broken-after-update-to-qgis-2-18
The solution mentioned does not appear to be a fix for recent builds.

I don't have a Mac myself to test, can any Mac devs confirm this issue?
Also not sure if the problem is also in 3.x or not.

Note: loading of Spatialite data in the main QGIS works just fine since
that doesn't depend on pyspatialite to work.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] idea: show profile name in Window title?
Message-ID: <c6ba05c2-48bf-a7ef-5cff-45bcf9d0f7f7@duif.net>

Now that we have 'the little asterisk' in the Window title to indicate a
non-saved project.

I was wondering if it would be an idea to show the 'Profile' name also
in the title, like

*projecttitle - QGIS 3.0 [ default ]
or
projecttitle - QGIS 3.0 / default
or
projecttitle - QGIS 3.0 - proxied

Context: I have a profile for a client with a special proxy setting so I
normally work in default but sometimes use the 'proxied' one.

Upon normal startup I always have to check via menu which profile I have
opened now...

Anybody else see this as a good idea?
Or is it to much ui clutter?

About the little asterisk for new projects: other applications also use
the little asterisk to show a named project has changed, but they often
use 'untitled' for a project IF it does not have a name.
At this moment we show:

*QGIS 3.0

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

good ideas - also the "Untitled" for projects that haven't been saved yet.

Greetings,

I'm also +1 to both of these, but with the distinction that the
profile is only shown when the user has multiple profiles on their
install.

I'll try to implement today.

What about adding the profile name only if not default? This way we don't clutter the title 
for the 95% of users that only use the default profile :) Otherwise, I'd like to see a 'default 
profile' (translatable) string rather than the raw 'default' profile name.

Btw. shouldn't be the 'default' profile (and directory) name translatable as well?

Also big +1 for the "Untitled" label.

It's in the app library, so isn't exposed as public API (only core,
gui, analysis and server are public API).

You'd need to copy the class across to your app.

Do you have a public repo for your code?

All,

Just to follow up on this, since I am the one to blame for this error to show up.
Both by introducing it in the first place and by releasing 5.0.0 with this as a 
known bug. The bug was introduced to fix a range of other potential issues.
Unfortunately the architecture in the old API of PROJ makes it almost impossible
to both treat other transformations correct while also treating the Web Mercator
correctly. The problem is that the Web Mercator is, geodetically speaking, an
abomination of a transformation. It basically defies all logic. This has been known
for a long time of course. Unfortunately no tests were set up to catch this specific
transformation. I'll make sure to at least add Jeff's test case.

Regarding releasing the library with this bug included. The cause of the problem
was determined very close to the release time (which was announced a month
ahead). We did go through six release candidates. The vote for promotion of RC6
to final release was already started so I decided to release anyway since I did not
want to prolong the process even more. I am sure this bug would have been
discovered earlier if all of you QGIS developers would not have been super
busy with QGIS 3.0 and had had some spare time to test the PROJ release
candidates. I am not blaming anyone, it is just a case of bad timing. Not much
we can do about that really. Had I been in your shoes I would not have prioritized
testing other software either, that's for sure!

The problem has an easy fix. Remove the "+nadgrids=@null" from your epsg
init-file and the transformation should work as expected. A proper fix will
come in 5.0.1 around April 1st.  I hope you all will continue to use PROJ 5.0.0
in your development builds despite this problem so other bugs can see the
light of day and be fixed in time for 5.0.1.

I completely agree with not requiring 5.0.0 as a dependency for QGIS. Hopefully
5.0.1 is a little better so that can be the recommended PROJ version for QGIS.

I would like to encourage you to take a look at the release schedule [0] for the next
couple of years. We are going to change things in order to keep up with current
geodetic developments in countries such as Australia, USA and Iceland.  It will
affect QGIS sooner or later. I am of course happy to provide assistance where
needed.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to disable authentication disabled in
	messagebar
Message-ID: <20180309102742.GB47031@chisti.cm.net>

Hello,

How can I disable authentication from qgis during build or runtime?
Whe opening settings -> options -> authentication, I have below message

"Authentication system is DISABLED:
QCA's OpenSSL plugin (qca-openssl) is missing.
"
I also have an "critical" message in messagbar every time qgis is
started. It's a bit of annoying.
I don't have strong preference of setting authentication/security on
my qgis installation. So I would prefer to disable this feature in build.

"Messages[2] Authentication System : DISABLED. Resources authenticating via the system can not be accessed"

If one doesn't have qca-openssl or whatever is required to enable
authentication then is nice to have no such error messages. In this
case, qgis is trying to activate feature where user does not have
required dependencies. And user is well aware of it during configure
step

I get below message during cmake configure.:
"
-- QtCore/QCA include/lib variables missing or CMake is cross-compiling,
-- skipping QCA OpenSSL plugin C++ check
"

-- 
Take care,
Rashad

your are certainly not too blame at à personal level. this is the kind of this that happen inevitably given a certain amount of changes . i'm surprised that the GDAL autotest suite did not catch this but the cause is likely that the GDAL c++ class that wraps proj has an optimisation when transforming from 3857 to 4326. if you transform an array of points of the same northing they have the same latitude. this is a common case for gdalwarp internal mechanics. thus you need to do trigonometric computations just once! so proj is completely short circuited for that case. 

i'll add a test for the reverse transformation that uses proj (could receive a similar optimisation but isnt needed when warping unrectified imagery with RPC to WebMercator)

Sorry for rewinding the thread to where it started.
Provided that users can benefit from keeping the last stable release and an
LTR both installed, do you think that this is up to the specific platform
to handle this (OsGeo4W does it already) or a more general solution can be
provided?
The LTR will be on version 2 for several months, so I suggest the libraries
could use a different namespace. Is this an acceptable solution? Are there
alternatives.

Hi All,

I second that: not blaming anybody here. This happens in the real world.

My point was that I think as QGIS we can 'hide' this issue by not using
5.0.0 'yet' in the osgeo4w package.

I will happily use/test whatever is available in Debian sid  :-)

Also tried Kristian's fix.

For QGIS users: QGIS does not use the epsg file provided by your proj
install, but a srs.db:
 {QGISINSTALLDIR}/share/qgis/resources/srs.db

I edited (using DB browser) and removed the "+nadgrids=@null" clause
from the epsg:3857 line.
Checked by looking into the srs chooser of QGIS and seeing that it was
indeed not visible anymore.

But it does not seem a 100% hack with me. While more near the 'real'
place, it is still 150m off?

Regards and thanks for all the work on Proj: one of the corner stones of
QGIS!!

Hehe, proj is hiding itself, since 493 is still shown in "about" ;)

FWIW, proj (5.0.0-3~exp1) available in Debian experimental contains a
patch with the cherry-picked commit that fixes this issue. [0]

It also contains a patch with the changes from PR #845 [1], but that
introduces a regression causing the shapelib test-suite to fail [1].
I've fixed with another patch included in proj (5.0.0-3~exp2). [2]

Message-ID: <9def770b-3fa1-7d91-b449-84998eeb9b53@gmail.com>

Hi,

Two strings in python/plugins/processing/algs/gdal/buildvrt.py do not 
translate because pylupdate5 puts them into wrong context 
(ParameterVrtDestination should be in buildvrt).

That's because in buildvrt.py ParameterVrtDestination class is defined 
within buildvrt. Perhaps pylupdate5 simply does not support classes in 
classes

I suspect this kind of error may be also in other places.

Message-ID: <CAHOfOo2HW7rbkndxNkt-6MtWpu4QB9=H=sSSk-QDMasaAxKVhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

The docs state
   Qwt >= 5.0 & (< 6.1 with internal QwtPolar)
Can you be more explicit about exactly which version of Qwt (and QwtPolar)
to use?

Most versions of Qwt don't build with Qt-5.
QwtPolar doesn't seem to build at all.

Any advice regarding building Qwt?  Thanks!

Unless you really need it, you can build without QwtPolar:
-DWITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF

I'm on Debian sid, then there is
QWT Version 6.1.3
and I do build without QWT

Thanks Kristian.

This experience shows us how today in the world of mapping "services" 
(remote mapping engines like QGIS, MapServer, PostGIS, GRASS GIS,..) 
rely on this unfortunate projection (thanks Google ha), where end-users 
of the services really have no access to the remote server's PROJ 
settings.  It feels like I have been battling this projection for 15 
years now ha.  -jeff

No, that PR is not about this issue. I did not create a PR for this 
because I don't know how to fix this. I assume buildvrt.py (and others 
with same issue) should be modified so that the class within the class 
is removed -- or maybe fix pylupdate5 since it is doing a bad job.

seems reasonable to me, and if I can ask... would it be backportable
to 2.18? This change has broken a few web published projects and the
workaround is ugly (manually change the .qgs files or add in the
layout a legend as a png/jpg image).

thanks!

ok thanks, but one doubt: I guess that this change (compared to 2.14)
was to make qgis server more compliant and this also means that we
need to accept that for such requests will be always slower than it
was before? sorry for the dumb question as I'm not much into the ogc
internals.


cheers

Timur,

I am having similar issues in Linux openSUSE Leap 42.3. As far as I
understand there are issues and conflict between versions of PyQT and SIP.
It is not a QGIS problem. It would be nice to sort it out in any case.

/H.

My bad: going from datum=WGS84 to WebMercator wasn't actually affected by 
the bug. Only if you go from datum != WGS84 to WebMercator. And there wasn't 
indeed a test for that later case in GDAL autotest. Now added.

I don't think the removal of "+nadgrids=@null" is a "universal" workaround. It only works 
when the other SRS has no +towgs84 or +nadgrids clause itself, which isn't the case of EPSG:
28992. Basically if you transform between EPSG:28992 and WebMercator without 
+nadgrids=@null, then no datum shift at all is done, so you have just the tranform between 
the Bessel ellipsoid and the sphere of radius 6378137. The proper fix is to get the patched 
version of proj

Hello,
I suggest to remind that using Homebrew carries in another issue. The
maintainers decided to force everyone to use Qt5 as Qt4 is deprecated by Qt
developers. Everything that was called qt5-something should become
qt-something, so everyone who uses Qt4 had to make formulas called
qt4-something for every Qt4 dependency.
This was the case even for OsGeo4Mac (
https://github.com/OsGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/) and Larry Shaffer had to
recreate all the needed dependencies inside this tap. If you have old Qt
dependencies inside your Homebrew, it may happen that qt-something is still
qt4-something even if brew thinks it's qt5... Feeling bewildered? So am I.

Hello Carlo,

Would you advice building Qt5 from source then, rather than using brew?

Thanks

This discussion is going a bit off-topic, but I think the problem could be
in your Homebrew installation. If someone changes the reference to qt from
qt4 to qt5 may cause some issue (I call it a mess, but I am biased, I had a
very bad time with these issue – thanks to Larry did fix them). Maybe you
will have to uninstall all qt related formulas and reinstall qt 4 and 5.
I see Remi Desgrange made a formula for the released QGIS 3 here:
https://github.com/RemiDesgrange/homebrew-qgisrelease
Are you using it?

Hi Giovanni,
 GetFeatures  can output GML with a different format.
What is sure is that GeoJSON spec doesn't leave any choice, unless we go
for a proprietary output format allowing another SRS.
I'll keep that in mind when testing OGC compliancy for WFS. We are working
on that currently to evaluate how much work is needed to reach a
certification for WFS.
Regards
Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Simple QGIS KML/KMZ Import
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrR7x62z2U3VME2vMBr0-jWxvdbtvfLQkBcjc2+64s7BA@mail.gmail.com>

The challenge with KML imports is that its free form nature makes it
difficult to conform to a table. I have large KMLs with nested folder
structures. I find that these large KMLs crash QGIS if I try to import the
entire thing and then each point gets rendered as a separate layer.

It wouldn't be hard to write a script that just pulls out all the
placemarks and writes them to a point layer, lines to a line layer, and
polygons to a polygon layer. What I would loose is the folder structure and
styling, but I could easily process large KMLs. I could consider a field in
the layers that would be a string of the nested folders that each point,
line, polygon were in.

Would this be of interest as a plugin? Is anyone doing this already? There
doesn't appear to be anything in the plugin repository.

Thanks,

Calvin

Well, you might just be right since I could not get some of the packages
working off of brew (due to installation issues, or unavailability). Some
of them were build from source (e.g., SIP), which might be causing the
issue that you are talking about.

And no, I have not been using Remi's formula.

What I am trying to accomplish is to create a QGIS installer for Mac since
there seems to be demand for one, though I have little experience in doing
so.

Thank you for your help

Ok, ok :-)

Cloned proj.4, compiled master and working \o/

It's there after you run autogen.sh.

Hi

I encountered this same error trying to compile and package QGIS 3.0 within
the "conda-forge" community channel of the Anaconda Python distribution, but
only when using GCC 4.8 (4.8.5, specifically). Pretty sure I have to stick
with GCC 4.8 for now within this build environment, but I did not encounter
this issue when using GCC 7.2 or 7.3. I switched out to gcc 7.2, keeping all
the other dependencies/etc the same, and can compile and run QGIS without
issue.

I don't know my way around SUSE, but it looks like the "gcc" package for
openSUSE Leap 42.3 is version 4.8
(https://software.opensuse.org/package/gcc). Assuming Hernán is using the
"gcc" package (and not "gcc6" or "gcc7", and thus would be using gcc 4.8.x),
then this could narrow down the issue and help explain why it hasn't come up
elsewhere. I'm unfortunately clueless about the GCC history and not much of
a C++ person, so I'm not sure where to go from here, beyond eventually
upgrading gcc, but would be happy to test patches/compilation options/etc.

Here's a link to a Gist with the output from cmake and the failed make step,
either using Make and Ninja (Ninja shows

Make:
https://gist.github.com/ceholden/b6179d58e17f983ce6f29b32531bb4fa#file-qgis3-0_gcc4-8_make_fail
Ninja:

Best,
Chris

XML and JSON formats do not adhere to the simple feature model of GDAL/OGR
that is reminiscent of a flat file or a relational table. And GDAL is one
of the base pillars for QGIS.
These are more similar to other storage models, say hierarchical or graphs,
so they enable a complex data structure that requires a pre-flight and asks
for some decisions to correctly represent their structure as a simple
feature or exceed it, delivering a complex relational system (if you can
guess some) or something other.
Maybe that's the new frontier for GDAL more than an opportunity for a
plugin. The same challenge is available for other formats like GPX,
geo/topoJSON, etc.
QGIS may implement much thoroughly the relevant options, but I think this
is work for GDAL.

Kristian -- just to add my 2c here, there's absolutely NO-ONE who can
blame you for this mistake, please do not beat yourself up over this!
I'm sure there's not a single developer who hasn't been responsible
for at least one serious bug in release software. It's just the nature
of the job, and even more so when the software involved is such a
complex and esoteric area as that handled by proj.

(Heck... you could easily have bluffed your way around this with some
explanation about temporal datum shifts and the like and claimed that
the proj5 results are "real world accurate" or something, and no-one
would have been able to call you out ;)

Keep up the great work in this critical, yet underappreciated and
under-funded part of our ecosystem. It's very much appreciated and
valued by everyone who knows the work you do.

As far as I'm aware, all the release builds are made without QwtPolar
now. We wanted to strip out this dependency completely, but no-one was
interested in maintaining the part of code where it's used (the GPS
display widget) and doing this work. I don't think anyone's even
noticed yet that this widget isn't present in QGIS 3.0 ;)

Hello,


I am trying to port QGIS to Windows RT Desktop (Windows on ARM). I have everything set up and running, until I get to cmake. Cmake fails to build when it reaches spatialite. 


This is what the cmake error file shows: https://hastebin.com/woherijadi.tex


I have tried manually replacing the spatialite lib with the 4.3 version, but the same issue occurs. Any help is welcome and appreciated!


Thanks,
Qiangong2

interesting news - would you mind sharing your work? Probably others
would be inerested in installing QGIS in the same environment.
Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] UI: Showing OWS-layers as... ows in layermanager?
Message-ID: <834f31a5-4c8b-c3b1-974a-37a0af7626c9@duif.net>

Hi List,

Had to test transparency in gdal generated pyramids in a geotiff.

So in a QGIS project I had to show both:
- the original raster (geotiff)
- the wms-version of the raster server by Geoserver

Without renaming the actual layername in the WMS, it is from the
layermanager in QGIS not very obvious that (see screenshot) the upper
ones are online/WMS services, while the bottom one is an actual raster.

Wat about using the little 'globe'-icons (which we have in the browser
for a 'service') also for a OWS layer in the layer manager?

Do others agree (or am I the only one heavily using WMS/WFS etc?).

Would this be an easy fix or are these icons hidden far away?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps I understand that the globes are actually for 'services', but I'm ok
with reusing them for layers too in this case ...

Thanks for the pointer, Chris. Indeed:

gcc (SUSE Linux) 4.8.5

I will chack again in two months with the new version (openSUSE 15). For
now I will live with QGIS 2.18.17 just fine.

Best,

I found a site that contains the 32 bit Spatialite 4.3 version:

# 'nm' is a linux command to list the symbols in an object file

- also bring a result, nice to know it also works with windows binaries

So I would compare the date and size of the 2 files with yours and if not
the same download the archive from www.norbit.de and try that.

They are the same size.

I wonder if the issue is mainly due to the cmake error that is being thrown. I put the link in a previous mail, but here it is: https://hastebin.com/woherijadi.tex


It says that there are unresolved externals.
Here is the cmakeoutput.txt file: https://hastebin.com/zopepezabo.tex

yes, the first one says it cannot find gaiaStatisticsInvalidate.

But if the file size is the same it should be found in spatialite_i.lib,
then it looks as if the cmake routine 'CheckFunctionExists.c' is faulty.

Sorry, I don't have practical experience in windows, so I can't  what the
cause is.

That is very likely the cause.

I can't seem to figure out how to build for ARM. I have all the required libs installed, it's added to my path but it says it can't find zlib.h or uinstd.h. It seems that those aren't put on the disk? Anyone have ideas?


Thanks,

My previous post didn´t seem to render much interest and I am a bit curious.
Is this not of interest to anyone else? Was I too vague? Does the task
involve to much work at the moment? I still think that it would be a great
addition to QGIS, especially in corporate environments.

Message-ID: <A44347E5-5704-4A20-BAC4-8AD1C057CF28@kyngchaos.com>

Sorry for the long wait.  It's been a hectic year - personal life changes (marriage), but I'm finally getting back into gear.

My QGIS 3 package for OS X/macOS is ready.  Besides the big QGIS release, there are a couple other big changes in the packaging.

- Minimum OS X 10.10 Yosemite

- Requires Python 3.6 from python.org (note it must be this and not homebrew or other distribution).

- except for what I include in the GDAL Complete package, all extra necessary python modules are available from pypi with pip.  These are installed by the QGIS installer and need an internet connection at that time.

Make sure to install Python 3 first, otherwise the GDAL Complete python components will not be installed (these are also required by QGIS).

Currently the globe plugin is not included, but I'll get that out in an update soon.  The new QGIS 3D features are included.

GDAL format plugins will follow soon (ECW, MrSID, GRASS).

Hi

Very quick answer:
We (3liz team) are indeed developing a full server stack to be able to use
QGIS processing algorithms server side. It will be fully opensourced. No
real web admin panel in project, but we use Lizmap Web Client as a web
front end to published algs.

We will try to come back here asap with a full description and road map. If
you want to contact us directly, please use info at 3liz.com address.

Regads,
Michaël

Whee, William,

All good news! Congrats with all your life changes too :-)

Though not a Mac owner I've seen a lot of messages about it.

Thanks for this big step!

Is it an idea to put the .dmg file (together with the link to Python 3.6
on the QGIS Website, as 'offical mac installer'?
For the QGIS project it would be a good thing to have such an official
installer on the website.

Another big question (for Mac users), was if it is possible to provide a
'signed' installer. So question would be: IF we as OSGeo or QGIS could
arrange the key for you. Would it be a hassle to sign the installer? Or
are you in other ways reluctant to use this?

Again, thanks for this work.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I'm working on getting access to have the files on qgis.org.

There is a QGIS developer ID that I should be able to sign it with.  I just haven't had time to look into it.  One big change I have to make is the packaging software, I'm still using the old packagemaker app, and the current tools are terminal-only.

Now that I'm getting a chance to try some things out with QGIS 3 - one big problem I see is there is no path configuration for various external tools, like GDAL, SAGA and GRASS.

The processing error log says SAGA is not found, though looking at the python code it should automatically find the bundled SAGA in the Mac app.

When I try to run a GDAL tool, I get a command not found error.  I see no way to configure where to find the GDAL tools.  I do see in the python code for processing that it references a /GdalTools/gdalPath setting if it doesn't find it bundled.

It may be this issue? https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17555

There's some hints in that thread about the cause.

Champion! I'm sure you've made a lot of people very happy with this
announcement.

For those who know what you do, your work is very much valued! It's a
shame that packaging is somewhat underappreciated and under-supported
by the wider QGIS user community :(

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] only read name and group name of processing
	algorithms during startup
Message-ID: <20180313105603.GA18848@chisti.cm.net>

if a provier is enabled then qgis reads all algorithm's during
startup. This involves reading descriptor files and doing all parsing
required to make gui when user actually open algorithm (click on
treeitem).
So If I have like three provider enabled it takes more time to start qgis than
usual. Even though, I might open one or two later at some point. 

It is not necessary here to parse "all" data during startup.  name and
group name is only needed to fill provider-algorithm tree. This is
true for any provider which uses descriptor files (OTB, GRASS, SAGA etc..).

Issue is more about calling defineDescriptorFile() in Algorithm's
__init__ method. And ofcourse, one cannot avoid init when adding
algorithm and tree need to add an instance of algorithm. what can be
done?

There is canExecute() method in baseclass that providers can
override. so init method can read first two line or (single line?) to
fill algorithms tree. And canExecute() can do full parsing of
descriptor files.
I had tried this in OTB code and it seems to work!.

I don't know if there is a better way to implement this or it is
intentional to parse all descriptor files of all providers during
every startup.

I appreciate your comments and feedback on this improvement.

progress. Yes, please come back with a description and roadmap when
possible, perhaps I can provide some user input and suggestions.

Message-ID: <002001d3bacb$2c6c9f80$8545de80$@leemreijze.nl>

Hello,

 

This is the first time I ask a question via the mailing list. I'm not sure
if this is the right way. I hope this is the right.

 

I work for a local government in the Netherlands and have been exploring
QGis for our organization for a year now. I am currently using QGIS 2.18.11.
During the exploration of QGis I ran into the following problem. Much work
within our organization is being done with the program Bentley Microstation
V8i. We have thousands in the DGN v8 format and I have noticed that they can
not be loaded into QGis. I can only load the files if I first export them to
the DGN v7 format.

 

I went looking for a solution and according to this website
(http://www.gdal.org/drv_dgnv8.html) it should actually be possible to load
the file format DGN v8 in QGis 2.18 and 3.0. However, it still does not
work. Does anyone know a solution for this problem?

 

Yours,

 

Erik Leemreijze

"This driver requires to be built against the (non open source) Open Design
Alliance Teiga library."

And that library is proprietary and only available for a fee (see
https://www.opendesign.com/join).

We have been members of OpenDWG then Open Design Alliance for years. Teigha
is not open source, but we never paid any fee to use the converter/viewer,
I don't know if there is any limitation to use the (binary) libraries
included. I don't think so, but I may be wrong.
Licensing the source is unfortunately not free (as in free beer) and open
is "members only" which is a real pity.
Anyway, GDAL has a new driver based on the free (as in free speech as well
as in free beer) Libopencad (https://github.com/sandyre/libopencad), it's
called OpenCAD: http://www.gdal.org/drv_cad.html.
Unfortunately it does not cover DGN v8. I think Alexandr Borzykh could
extend his library to cover it as it is similar to DWG (it has no relation
to previous "true" DGN format).

I can't reproduce -- it works fine here (testing through the attribute table).

Actually it's a bit trickier here -- models make things more complex
as they self-validate on creation, and need full knowledge of the
dependent algorithm's parameters and outputs.

What I've been thinking/planning is to take advantage of task manager
here. So basically:

- on processing startup, there's no providers added
- when the qgis interface is fully loaded then we fire up a background
task which loads the providers, allowing them to fully build their
available algorithms and parameters without blocking the startup
- after the task completes, the tree is populated

I'd like to see more plugins take this approach, so that qgis can load
nice and quick and the slow stuff happens without annoying users...

Hi Devs,

Trying to implement the feature 'use ctrl-shift-tab' to hide ALL except
a map:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6580

I now have the issue, that IF I also remove the menu-bar, I cannot use
'ctrl-shift-back' anymore to go back to 'normal view'.

In an earlier attempt
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6523
it was noted that "That should be solvable by creating these shortcuts
outside of the actions too."

Anybody here could give me a pointer on how to do that?

Hi all,

in the last weeks I've pointed out some problems we can have we the
documentation, so, together with Richard, these are the conclusions:

* documentation repo will be branched together with QGIS release
* having these branches allows doc writers to update QGIS but,
especially, Processing Help files
* if you devs change something that is linked to Processing algorithm
(new algorithm OR changes to some parameter of existing algorithm) could
you please add the tag "ALGCHANGE" (other name suggestions are welcome)
in the commit message? This will open an issue in the doc repo with a
correct label (and hopefully assign this to me)


With this system we will have (at least) the chance to have Processing
Help updated and not loosing all the work done till now.

Feedbacks are more than welcome

Cheers and thanks to Richard for all the inputs!

Thanks Matteo and Richard,

This sounds like a very good path forward. Having up-to-date
documentation in this area is crucial and this approach with branching
and tagging sounds like a very good workflow to me.

This mainly depends now on developers to provide enough context and
proper tagging of the commit message.

I guess you'd expect it something like this as pull request text (which
will be merged and not rebased, so we have the triggers fire properly)


Add a new parameter for [x]

This allows to highly customize the behavior and control the awesomeness
of this algorithm fine-grained and precise.

Here follow pictures of results with [x] set to 100 and 1000.

[ALGCHANGE]


Thanks a lot for the good work, it is much appreciated

Matthias

Hi, 
Thanks Matteo and Richard for having brainstormed on this issue and for your outcome. And sorry to not have joined you.

Bear with me but i am less enthusiastic with some of the proposals for the reasons below

Does it mean that current testing becomes 3.0 and testing targets 3.2?
When will the doc branched? As soon as the application is released?
Because of the low level of man power in doc writing, we decided to have a LTR based release plan. Plan we struggle to follow. With the proposed system, we could end up with 3/4 branches (from 2.18/3.0 to 3.4) and i'm afraid that the only changes among them reside in some algs description. Because there are other areas in user manual (but also other docs in a branch - cookbook, training, guidelines), there will be an overhead on back/forward porting commits. Is syncing some alg description with the manual release name worth all this trouble (see below for more context explanation)?

Another point related to quick releases is the "overload" of the doc landing page https://docs.qgis.org already crowded with some repetitive docs (dev or writers guidelines, GIS introduction in html and pdf + translations). For these docs, we can just keep a single version otherwise sooner we will kill our servers. See http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Qgis-community-team-Management-of-release-independent-documents-td5318107.html for a discussion i fail to raise on this issue year ago.

> > * having these branches allows doc writers to update QGIS but,

Sorry. Even though i understand what you try to say, let me stress that there's currently room to update QGIS. There's already a lot to update in docs (336 issues in 3.0, 26 for 3.2). Master branch is desperately awaiting for writers to update QGIS. People should be aware of that.

As i said above, i'm really afraid that it will become only a Processing help files branch.
Let's analyze the current organisation:
* Users (should) know that the latest released doc is 2.18 and the testing doc targets 3.4, hence could contain features in development. 
* In the implemented help system, when you hit a help button in 3.0, 3.1 (up to 3.4) it will lead you to a page in the testing manual
  * if the alg does not change since 3.0, all is good
  * if it's a 3.1 documented alg, it's also good: user will find it from the application. And if a 3.0 user wonders why this documented alg is not available to him, refer to meaning of testing doc.
  * if a 3.0 alg is updated (new parameters or changed behavior), here could be the issue. Instead of branching the whole doc, maybe we could find a system of tag or something like that to help readers identify the appropriate description? I guess this kind of system might exist (also it should allow to easily find concerned algs so that we regularise the description once the LTR is released and "a new master branched").

Not sure it's either needed.
Many months i'm cleaning the doc repo, and if there are issues i can say are well tagged, it's the processing ones. 99% (to not say, ALL) of the issues related to Processing have [Processing] tag in the commit title. Devs already do that very well in QGIS repo so that i stopped applying the "Processing" label to the generated issue report. It was a needless repetitive task.
This to say that Processing issues are already easy to find in GitHub repo.

Now, do we need that someone points that the alg has changed (using an adhoc new tag) to figure it out? If the alg is already documented and there's a new issue report, then something has changed.

That said, it's not contradictory with a well described alg commit as suggested by Matthias. Thing we still miss because documenting alg help requires to check either the dialog or the code. 

Only the automatic assignment would not be handled by the current system unless we assign any processing-mentioned issue to you.

Something that annoys me (and to be honest frustrates me a lot) in the recent discussions i read is my feeling that docs status/quality/interest is all about Processing help update. Don't get me wrong: i'm glad we covered those descriptions and we deliver algs with full help. And we have to keep updating the description (to avoid situations of the Cookbook or Training manual)
But processing help is not all; the Processing system itself is outdated: what are the recent changes? What are the options of Processing? How do models work? How to understand alg help? How to use/write algs/models?... There are things to update to help users understand Processing and i see no mention of this nowhere. 
And the rest of the docs, i'll avoid mentioning it here again (already made many calls) ... 

> > Feedbacks are more than welcome

Sorry to not come with a +1 and not be that positive in my feedback (i hope it's at least constructive) but while i share (and like) your interest in Processing help, i think that solutions we come with should keep in mind the big picture of documentation and ease the workload. And i'm afraid it's not fully the case here. 

Thanks for raising the question and i really wish we find a way to ensure long-term and sustainable update of (at least) Processing help.

that is exactly the point: syncing only the Processing Help doc. As you
well know currently Processing docs are landed (for 3.0), but for the
current master some new algorithm is landed and some changes to existing
algorithms have been made.

This was also the initial idea, "detach" in some way the Processing Help
files from the whole folder, what comes in my mind, just thinking aloud:

* having a separate repo (BAD IDEA! for a tons of reasons)
* make separated branches (one for each release) where we now we will
only update Processing files and only build that documentation. This
should not overload the server. Redirecting all the other doc link of
that release to the testing branch. So we will have for example:

https://docs.qgis.org/3.2/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/cartography.htm
that will be build and really exists

https://docs.qgis.org/3.2/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html

that won't be build and that will be redirected to:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html


I think this solution needs a lot of redirecting work

ok, let's keep the existing [Processing] tag in the commit

you are perfectly right Harrissou and I can understand your frustration.
I also think that this Processing work has "resurrected" some interests
in the whole documentation (at least for me as you know ;) ).

Unfortunately we don't have man power to keep the doc updated with all
the code and I might be wrong, but I think this is also related with the
big 3.0 release. Main focus on the code and less to the doc.

I promise I'll do my best to help you out also for the general documentation

Hello all,

I have to agree with Harrissou. Going back to branch documentation at each
point release will not help, it will only create a bigger burden to a very
small team of interested people, with lots of commits needing to be ported
back or forward.

Although I have proposed to branch 3.0 documents from 2.18 before the
release in the past, I think that was a different situation, where 2.18
Docs were almost ready, and QGIS 3 release was yet undetermined.

I fail to see why Processing should be an exception regarding the rest of
the documentation. Everywhere, in the document there will be parts that
will be updated to 3.2 before the official release in QGIS 3.4 (hopefully).

Nevertheless, I am happy that someone is fully dedicated to it and I don't
want to frustrate Matteo in his demand to keep everything updated.

My suggestion is:

- Keep the branching as it is. That is, branch and release only for QGIS
3.4 LTR
- Keep updating the master branch for all 3.x features (if possible giving
priority to 3.0 features)
- Backport anything missing on 2.18, if applicable.
- For changes (in processing or not) specific to 3.2 or 3.4 add a note
saying "New in QGIS 3.2" (we could use a substitution for easy tracking).
That way, a QGIS 3.0 user using Testing Documentation understands that the
feature/parameter or whatever is not yet available for him. (This is how
Sphinx documentation does)
- Before the release of QGIS 3.4 Documentation, we clean up all those
messages.

IMHO, this methodology will keep the simplicity of the process, while
allows to document recent changes while they are still fresh.

About the ALGCHANGE, it's a +0 for me. I would prefer to keep it as simple
as possible and try not to have too many tags, The processing one would
with the risk that Developers.

Best regards,

Alex Neto

Hello everyone!

I have a short question concerning print composition, as I want to do that via PyQgis in QGIS3:
I stumbled across the QgsComposition class (http://kartoza.com/en/blog/how-to-create-a-qgis-pdf-report-with-a-few-lines-of-python)
I cannot find this class in the Qgis3 API. Usuallly, the Python console in QGIS will suggest me available classes as soon as I type the initials, but all Qgis shows me are some QgsCompound... classes
Since nothing is mentioned in the backwards incompatible changes (https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html) I wanted to ask here, maybe I have just overseen something or am searching for a wrong class (?)

Hi,

QgsComposition is gone in favor of the new layout classes: see
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsLayout.html

Have a look to the tests for some usage examples:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgslayout.py

Hope this helps

always thinking aloud (really thinking aloud).. what about branching the
docs but having a *dynamic* system based just on sphinx .. include:: ? I
mean, branching the 3.2 release and having the correct index set up with
just the Processing docs?

For information, I assigned all issues updating or creating an alg help to Matteo. Not all the Processing issues… yet ;)

Fail to see the system but i'm not used to this Sphinx role.

Yes. there are different cases like modeler, standard, batch, scripts.
I tried to utilize canExecute() in otb and seems to be working.
You already have a very flexible, strong API in qgis processing such
trickier feature like this one has become too easy!!.

I had to call alg.canExecute() in two places and that's it.
diff attached below. With this loading time will be hopefully improved for
OTB, SAGA, GRASS GIS.

I can add modification to SAGA and GRASS if you are okay to move this to PR.

this is still loading all algorithm with parsing but things will be in
background to not block ui for users. correct?
In that case, you could include above diff and then add loading in
background task. IMHO that will be best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unable to compile QGIS3 plugin
Message-ID: <CACJcZHtv3T7zuKNRMN+p01cDiWSuswa2uEezNUZJKQE6QO_yPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to make a QGIS3 plugin. I have created the template with the
'Plugin Builder', which creates the plugin folder in
C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins.
When I then open the OSGeo4WShell, navigate to the folder and enter 'make',
the following error occurs:

When running 'pyrcc5 -o resources.py resources.qrc' (which should do the
same) the following error occurs:


I thought it might have something to do with Python3 not properly installed
or connected to QGIS3 and reinstalled QGIS and Python with the OSGeo4W
installer without success. I am a little confused by the many pythons
installed somewhere from OSGeo4W and my local Python 2 and 3. I will try
reinstalling all parts to get a better feeling for what comes from where.

Any further idea on what I could try?

Thanks in advance,

Sophie

run 

call qt5_env.bat
call py3_env.bat

from the OSGeo4W shell before calling pyrcc5.

Thanks a lot William for this work! Very very appreciated!

BTW, I noticed you removed the QGIS 2 installer from the webpage:
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis
QGIS 2 is maintained until January 2019, can you put back at least the QGIS
2.18.15 so users can download it again? Thanks.

This would indeed be very valuable. I personally see it as a critical
risk for open source geo if we can't tighten our links to CAD (and
unfortunately, that means dealing with these proprietary formats).
Let's hope someone steps up and funds this development!

Hey Sophie!

There is one .bat file that does all the work of setting the Environment variables properly: /osgeo4w_root/bin/python-qgis-dev.bat
Call that file in the console and in the same console cd to the directory with the pyrcc.bat file (osgeo4w_root/apps/python36/scripts)

Here is the link to a gis.stackexchange question concerning that:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/260743/how-to-compile-qtdesigner-user-interface-ui-and-resource-qrc-files-with-qg/264377#264377

Good luck and compiling ;)

Following this discussion, the "Vector --> OpenStreetMap" feature has been
removed from QGIS3 [0].
Issue is that in the Training manual, it's the first tool used to help
users download data to work with [1] (and also used in other places). This
situation renders some exercises obsolete.
Question (to trainers?): what would then be the appropriate replacement
tool, here, in the *Training manual*?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unable to compile QGIS3 plugin
In-Reply-To: <23DC76E788B5AE46BF97C68F781B7C2522D3D3F9@OVEKBG.ove.at>

Hello Jürgen and Hannes,

thanks for your support. I tried both suggestions, with little success.

*Jürgen's suggestion:*

This creates the resources.py file (attached). However, when I open QGIS3
it crashes every time I reload the plugin (crash report attached).

*Hannes' suggestion:*

which results in the same as above. However, here I am not entirely sure if
I followed the suggestion correctly as I go back to the plugin folder for
compiling.
Also, I wonder, why the result of calling python-qgis-dev.bat lists win32,
while I have a win64 machine.


I also tried changing the python path as suggested in the stack exchange
question to Python36 in C:\OSGeo4W64\etc\ini\python-core without success


Best,

Sophie

Hey Sophie!

Exactly. You first call …/pyrcc.bat without any arguments, and the console tells you what arguments pyrcc.bat takes.
Then you change directory, away from the pyrcc.bat and try to call after having changed to the directory where your resource file is.

Remain in the folder where the pyrcc5.bat is (otherwise the console will not know the command) and give the absolute paths of your target files in quotation mark (in case you have whitespaces in your dirs.) like I did in the below screenshot.

You might encounter the same problem with the pyuic5.bat -> which you use, when you want to translate the .ui file to python code with the pyqt5 bindings. In that case, I built myself a .bat file with the following commands, making the same as Jürgen suggested, (just in case of further tampering attempts ;) )

REM take all .ui files and apply it to the pyuic5.bat to all of them and output them as .py files
REM when calling this batch file the first argument needs to be the path to /python36/script
pushd %~dp0
echo off
call c:
cd %1
cd ../../../bin/
call "o4w_env.bat"
call qt5_env.bat
call py3_env.bat

path %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH%
set QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT:\=/%/apps/qgis-dev
set GDAL_FILENAME_IS_UTF8=YES
rem Set VSI cache to be used as buffer, see #6448
set VSI_CACHE=TRUE
set VSI_CACHE_SIZE=1000000
set QT_PLUGIN_PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\qtplugins;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qt5\plugins
set PYTHONPATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\python;%PYTHONPATH%

echo off

popd
for %%i in (*.ui) do (
                call "%1\pyuic5.bat" -o "%%~ni.py" "%%~ni.ui"
)

I hope that helped

Cheers,
Hannes

Hello Jürgen and Hannes,
thanks for your support. I tried both suggestions, with little success.
Jürgen's suggestion:
[http://?ui=2&ik=ad514a8e24&view=att&th=1622e15a2bbbae15&attid=0.1&disp=safe&realattid=ii_jetq74350_1622e15a2bbbae15&zw]
This creates the resources.py file (attached). However, when I open QGIS3 it crashes every time I reload the plugin (crash report attached).
Hannes' suggestion:
[http://?ui=2&ik=ad514a8e24&view=att&th=1622e24472fdda7d&attid=0.2&disp=safe&realattid=ii_jetqrnzt1_1622e24472fdda7d&zw]
which results in the same as above. However, here I am not entirely sure if I followed the suggestion correctly as I go back to the plugin folder for compiling.
Also, I wonder, why the result of calling python-qgis-dev.bat lists win32, while I have a win64 machine.

I also tried changing the python path as suggested in the stack exchange question to Python36 in C:\OSGeo4W64\etc\ini\python-core without success

Hey Sophie!

There is one .bat file that does all the work of setting the Environment variables properly: /osgeo4w_root/bin/python-qgis-dev.bat
Call that file in the console and in the same console cd to the directory with the pyrcc.bat file (osgeo4w_root/apps/python36/scripts)

Here is the link to a gis.stackexchange question concerning that:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/260743/how-to-compile-qtdesigner-user-interface-ui-and-resource-qrc-files-with-qg/264377#264377

Good luck and compiling ;)

Sophie,

What happens if you add the full path before the pyrcc5 command when you’re in the plugin folder?

So  you go to the plugin folder and there you run:
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Scripts\pyrcc5 –o resources.py resources.qrc

Michel

Message-ID: <17cf88b7-9ec2-c9f5-21a6-73a238614960@duif.net>


See subject :-)

Should we 'freeze' current status of the visual changelog?

Or are there any items which should be a added/polished.

For earlier releases we always 'ported' the changelog to the website:
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog218/index.html
This made the changelog translatable in the website.

For 3.0 there is a temporary link to the changelog app now:
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.0.0/

But... do we still want to move it to the website?
Or is everybody happy with a link to the above changelog application?

I'm ok to move it to the website again, it's always some work because of
some styling issues... But that is ok.

But if nobody cares, I'll go and do something else, or sit in the sun ;-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Native XYZ layer, calling the OSM raster tiles? Alternatively,
QuickMapServices is now funded, and should be published soon.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Add "QGIS3 compatible" link to plugins repo on the
	web
Message-ID: <1521199294464-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

There are quite a lot of questions, comments, and opinions expressed online
about the availability of plugins in QGIS3. How easy would it be to add
another plugins filter link to the menu on http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/
(the one with My plugins, Featured, All, Stable, Fresh, Experimental, etc)
which only shows plugins with minversion <= 2.99 and maxversion >=2.99?

This would allow people to check plugin availability easily without
upgrading to QGIS3 on spec.

Thanks

Tom

My apologies. I missed the crucial word "vector" in Harrissou's message.
Sorry for the noise.

I got a few requests this week when the port to QGIS 3 will be done about
QuickOSM. I'm planning to do that next week.

Hi Tom,

good idea, we could (where now is 'All plugins') maybe add:
- '3.x' plugins
- '2.x' plugins

then pointing to https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/?qgis=3
and https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/?qgis=2

I reckon for a Django guru it should be not so difficult?
FYI: current plugin site is a django website:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django

Any takers?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

No, Non, Nee, Nein :)

My (honest) intention was truly to invite somebody else wanting to
invest some time in community work. And this looks line a nice
'incomer'-task?

Unless you're afraid that that will ruin all your work off course ;-)

Hi, 

Personally, I don't think that the visual changelog will be translated
(I might be wrong though). Given that we struggle to get enough
contributors for even the english master version chances are low, that
they will be translates. I kind of promised to continue to work on it,
but was too busy with other stuff so far. I will have more time soon,
though. 

Can we let it "as is" for now - let's say until the end of April (so
people can still contribute to it) and then copy it to our website at
the beginning of May o so? The nice thing about moving it to the website
is that we have an archive and no dependency on external services. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi,

I agree with what Andreas proposes, ie announce clearly a date to the end
of April, then make a copy to the website.

I still try to polish the changelog currently, some entries are hard to
understand or deserve animated gif's and some entries can be factorized in
one only for a shorter changelog. If the changelog is too long to be read,
that means it is too long :)

Another glitch linked to the validation workflow. When someone submit an
entry, the entry disappears until it is validated. So that leaded to
duplicates, probably because some thought they had an issue with the
website.

I would suggest that the validation workflow submits the new version to
moderators, and that a copy of the old version stays published. A message
to inform the author he needs some validation would be necessary too.

Cheers!

Régis

Hi Nyall,

Thanks for testing.

I tried again and still observe the issue.
I have found worst issues with setting this virtual fields with expression
"num_points( $geometry )"

- when adding a new feature and committing I get an error saying:
Feature has too many attributes (expecting 1, received 2)
although feature is correctly written to the provider

- the function seems to return actually 1 vertex more than there actually
is in the geometry

- I do need to commit to get the changes

I tested both with geopkg and shapefiles.
And I did not started alcohol yet today.

Cheers,
Denis

Hi Giovanni,

I have found the reason why QGIS Server 2.18 and probably 3 are slower 
than 2.14 in generating GeoJSON.
I'll fix it.

How does this work? I thought to document this tip in the User manual and
wanted to give it a try before but always fail:
I created an integer field which is recognized in the Attribute Forms
dialog as a range
I checked "unique" and "not null" constraints (and unchecked "allow null
values" from the range widget properties)
The first created feature had value =0
The second one also got 0 with the yellow cross on the side But changes
(with two 0 values) are saved in the layer.
Enforcing the constraints do not help, neither do setting the widget as
"Text Edit".

Did I miss something (btw i'm using a temporary layer but also failed with
shapefile) or is it broken.
Any help is welcome.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Set text of QgsLayoutItemLabel
Message-ID: <23DC76E788B5AE46BF97C68F781B7C2522D3E4AF@OVEKBG.ove.at>

Hello!

I am facing difficulties trying to set the text of a  QgsLayoutItemLabel.
I do something like the following to load a .qpt composer template and print this to a .png file (which works)

path = "C:\\QGIS3\\apps\\qgis\\composer_templates"
template_file = open(path+"\\ANSR_print_composer2.qpt")
template_content = template_file.read()
template_file.close()

document = QDomDocument()
document.setContent(template_content)
composition = QgsLayout(QgsProject.instance())
composition.loadFromTemplate(document, QgsReadWriteContext())

map_item = composition.itemById('map')
legend_item = composition.itemById('legend')
text_item = composition.itemById('textbox')
QgsLayoutExporter(composition).exportToImage( path+"\\report.png", QgsLayoutExporter.ImageExportSettings())

And now I'd like to modify only the text of the QgsLayoutItemLabel, which is the "textbox":


1)      I can move it around with setX(), setY(), but I don't know how to edit the text of the label. I thought of something like text_item.setText() or text_item.setLabelText(), but I think that text_item is just an instance of QgsLayoutItem, not QgsLayoutItemLabel. And there I get stuck.

2)      How would you manually add another text label, set the main property etc, such that, at the end of the day, my above code would export a .png containing this QgsLayoutItem?
I would have begun this way:
new = QgsLayoutItemLabel(composition)
new.setText("New label")
But it does not quite work that way!

Would be of great help, if you could give me some hints on that.

Thank you in advance! :)

Hannes

Régis, there is a ticket to remove the pending queue in projecta.
Please check and comment on https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues/806

Andreas, about translations of changelog, the 2.18 version has been fully
translated to French:
https://qgis.org/fr/site/forusers/visualchangelog218/index.html
We never know ;-)

I see no reason for us to not update any new feature imediately,
independently of the QGIS version it has landed. Testing documentation is
aiming for QGIS 3.4, until then, it's just that, testing documentation.

IMHO. After QGIS 3.4, if the documentation is too behind, we can think of
branching to allow keeping documenting new features arriving in master
(3.5+).

But as you well know we are too few to maintain all the dev work.. And I

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing algorithm plugin help
Message-ID: <CAK=gHb8a2F0MrMHvma3JK53u8GcFmq6YPRAnwMutLek2Upx6wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I developed a processing algorithm plugin using the Plugin Builder but I'm
having trouble setting up the Help panel which usually shows on the right
side of the windows, or at least the a help button pointing to a static
file.

I've tried creating the .py.help file with the same name as my algorithm
and provider files and placing them in both the
"~/.qgis2/processing/scripts" and "~/.qgis2/python/plugins/my_plugin"
folders, but without success.

Implementing the helpString() and helpUrl() methods in my GeoAlgorithm
class didn't work either.

Am I missing something? Sorry if it's a noob question.

André

I was already doing something quite similar but unfortunately it still
doesn't work. No help panel and no help button, just the parameters.
Is there anything else I should do on the defineCharacteristics() method
maybe?
As for the QGIS version, I'm still using 2.18. Could this be the problem?

Thanks for the input!

Although the right side panel still didn't show, I did get the "Help" tab
to work, and I also found a getParameterDescriptions() method in the source
code that might do the trick.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Submissions for FOSS4G Dar es Salaam
Message-ID: <ce9b4e4ce22a1127d4d242d887a05036@carto.net>

Hi, 

I just submitted two entries at the FOSS4G conference - note that the
CfP is open until March 21 (three more days). 

1. Presentation titled "Selective improvements in QGIS 3.x" 

2. Workshop "Unleashing the power of QGIS expressions" 

The reason I write here are two-fold: 

 	* avoid overlap with other submissions
 	* find a co-presenter co-workshop instructor

So if you intend to attend FOSS4G and would like to team up with me -
esp. for the workshop - please contact me. I could then provide more
details and you could still influence the submissions. 

If you already submitted a QGIS talk to FOSS4G, please also respond with
your submission title - so we can coordinate a bit and see what areas
are already covered. 

Thanks for your replies, 

Andreas

Nyall,

could we have defineCharacteristicsFromFile method in
QgsProcessingAlgorithm ?.
the diff with canExecute is more of a working draft.

Hi everyone

Here is a new proposal to add support for storage of QGIS projects
inside PostgreSQL (and possibly in other backends in the future):

Any comments would be highly appreciated!

I don’t think a long changelog is a limitation - in many cases this may be the only place where details of new features are available and enthusiastic users will happily pick through the details of the changelog to find things that are interesting for them.

As Etienne mentioned we will get rid of this soon - hopefully in time for 3.2.

Thanks for all your contributions!

Hi William

Sorry for not replying to your email earlier - I was totally off grid for a week (wheee!). Thank you so much for preparing the packages. I’ve tested here on my Mac and it works beautifully. I think Richard and Jürgen have already picked up the bits of info you were looking for - feel free to ping me here on the list or by direct if you still need anything.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Custom widgets and Qt Designer 4 and 5
Message-ID: <263edf4f-db27-11a7-d913-e62e59ac502c@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

sorry for raising this issue again. Some old and useful references at
the end of the page.

I'm getting a little bit confused with the usage of the custom widget
for the plugin. I have compiled qgis (while not installed, I'm running
it directly from source) and both Qt4 and Qt5 designer installed.

With Qt4 designer I see the custom widgets, even if I always have the
import error when loading the plugin (and I have to manually change the
ui file from <header>qgsmaplayercombobox.h</header> to
<header>qgis.gui</header>). Not a big deal but still...

With Qt5 designer I cannot see the widget in the interface at all. I
tried to copy
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so
to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer but Qt5 designer tells
me that something went wrong with the import.

Do you have some suggestions to use a correct workflow to use these
widgets in Qt x Designer?

Thanks for all the feedbacks

Cheers


Matteo

I had the same problem so I am still using the QGIS 2.x Qt Designer for my
QGIS 3.0 dialogs figuring that at some point someone would fix it.So far so
good.

Ok some steps forward.. By adding the repository of ubuntugis [0] I
could install libqgis-customwidgets version 3. BUT I cannot install it
because it depends on libgdal >= 2.2.0 (while I have 2.1.2 installed).

Should I also compile gdal to have the widgets available?

Thanks!

Cheers

Matteo

I can't answer your problem, but I'm using QGIS custom widgets by using the
"promoted widget" feature in QtDesigner. Less convenient I agree.
I never saw these widgets too and I think I'm lazy to check why because it
works with these promoted widgets.

My 2 cents ;-)

Hi Etienne,

yes I remember you showed me this *hack* in Nodebo ;) Anyway, I'm trying
to compile gdal 2.2 (in the /opt folder, I'm terrified that something
can break the existing installation of QGIS).

I'm now compiling another QGIS against gdal 2.2 and I have activated the
WITH CUSTOMWIDGET flag. Let's see....

Thanks for the suggestion

Matteo

Hi Michael,

can you share some details about this project?

Is it based on other existing stack like PyWPS?

Is it related with https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/wps4server/?

Thanks!

Success!!

Ok for those who can be interested, these are the steps I made:

* download and compile gdal 2.2.3 (compiled in the /opt folder)
* recompiled QGIS by changing the gdal paths and enable the flag WITH
CUSTOMWIDGET
* all went fine and QGIS is compiled against gdal 2.2.3
* in the output/lib directory there is the libqgis_customwidgets.so and
libqgis_customwidgets.so.3.1.0  files
* I copied this files to  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/

Q3 widgets are there. I still see they are saved with widget.h in the
ui, so I guess one has to change the path manually or promote the widget
like Etienne suggested

Cheers

Hi Allessandro,

I have made a submission to talk about this at the FOSS4G-FR and  FOSS4G in Dar-Es-Salam

This is a work based on a fork of PyWPS 4 - many thanks to them - (with a lot of changes and many additions!) and act as a standalone server - nothing to do with https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/wps4server/ <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/wps4server/>.

Actually we are stabilizing with Qgis 3.0 branch (the API change quickly, and we are catching changes as fast as possible), and at some point it is going to be published on github.
We are testing this on a real use case and we plan to have something in production ready very soon.

To be short: the server reuse processing algorithm  the same way they are used in the desktop - without modification. A marshalling is done between WPS parameter and Processing parameters.
Results can be stored in temporary projects and published as WMS service with Qgis server. 

The server is based on full asynchronous http server (Tornado) and makes an heavy use of asyncio and use Redis as storage backend for job status.

Hi matteo,

FYI, if you compile QGIS yourself anyway you don't need to compile it
against a custom GDAL version, you can also take the system one.

The error message you were seeing was only because the one you tried to
install (something ubuntugis I assume) was linked against a newer
version of gdal.

But you can of course also use the ones compiled against gdal 2.2.3, the
widgets won't look any newer though ;)

Cheers

Matthias

wait a second.. I'm a little bit confused now :)

* the Import error is not related to GDAL version (I mean qgswidgetecc.h
in the ui file instead of qgis.gui)
* not being able to see the QGS widgets in QT Designer 5 is related with
GDAL version, isn't it? If copying in the
/usr/...../pyqt5/plugin/designer the libqgiscustomwidget not compiled
against gdal >= 2.20 won't work

Is this right?


BTW the widget I see now in Qt Designer 5 are different from those of Qt
4. I noticed that I lost widgets in Qt4 now.... (what the hell..... :)


Thanks

Matteo

That's what I was talking about. It doesn't matter which gdal version
you link against.

a general comment on

“All references to files will be saved as absolute paths “


why does things have to be absolute path especially if you eventually 
will design for Geopackage that is suppose to simplify portability

can the Path not be divided into two separate names

1) one that is easily changed like a computer home directory which 
changes depending on computer used

2) project and all of its sub-directories that should not change

this is always a huge issue with us since we work a lot in areas with 
very poor or no internet connection thus projects have to be loaded on 
our personal computers or external hardrives.

also when you give a session to a client you always have to go into the 
project file and change the directory names.

QGIS is not the only program that has this issue and i never quite 
understood why it was done this way maybe there is a explanation besides 
its simpler for programers.

thanks

Syd

Hey Syd,

QGIS has the option (on by default) to save as everything as relative paths
which is better to make projects portable

The note about absolute paths applies only to projects stored inside
PostgreSQL database - in database one cannot really use relative paths
simply because in the database there is no concept of paths (project
has no path to turn other absolute paths to relative). Anyway it is
assumed that if users want to keep projects in PostgreSQL, their
layers would be most likely also coming from the database.

As for absolute vs relative paths in QGIS projects, more recent QGIS
versions use relative paths by default (configurable in project
properties dialog). So, if I store a project in
/home/martin/myproject.qgs which refers to layers from
/home/martin/data/mydata.gpkg, then the project file only keeps the
path as ./data/mydata.gpkg. If that is not the case for you then it
must be a bug.

Martin

ok so technically one I have the file libqgiscustomwidget.so and I've
copied it into the folder I can even clean the directory of QGIS
(compiled against gdal 2.20)?

Thanks for the patience ;)

Message-ID: <23DC76E788B5AE46BF97C68F781B7C2522D3E51C@OVEKBG.ove.at>

Hello again!

I do the following to add a QgsRasterLayer:
l = QgsRasterLayer("/path/file.dat", "Density")

Now I am struggling with a problem, that has somehow always the same suggested solution in all fora, namely to get rid of the prompt that appears
when adding a QgsRasterLayer, by using:
s = QSettings()
oldValidation = s.value( "/Projections/defaultBehaviour" )
s.setValue( "/Projections/defaultBehaviour", "useGlobal" ) # it doesn't matter what property to take, be it "useProject", "useGlobal" or "prompt" ...
... before adding the layer. But on my Linux environment, this does not work - and also not on my collegue's Windows system.
Has there something changed with the usage of QSettings w.r.t. to its usage in QGIS in the step from QGIS 2 to QGIS 3?

(Re)setting the layer CRS of course works normally and works as expected!

l.setCrs(QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(31287))
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(l)

Do you have any suggestions, how I could tackle the problem?

Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards,
Hannes

Nathan

interesting it is set to relative yet this is what i get

<layer-tree-layer source="file:///home/syd/SJV/Location/Stations/Grid.csv

i did load this project form a 2.18 project with relative names into qgis3.

I will have to look into this further. I am probably doing something 
wrong i am definitely not a power user.

thanks

That should still work.

Try using QgsSettings instead (but I don't think this should be necessary):

s = QgsSettings()

Hi Rashad,

Can you open a PR? I'm having trouble following the change as the
whitespace is messed up in the email.

Thanks!

Hi,

don't know if this is the right place to ask, but:

Last year we (satelligence.com) sponsored the 'discrete raster styling' 
work by Nyall (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4308) with €1500. I 
don't see a direct mention of that PR in the visual changelog, however, 
I do see a lot of company logo's :-) Would our contribution allow for a 
mention either as a sponsoring company at the top of the page, or could 
someone add a small section about the new feature and add us as a 
sponsor there?

Thanks!, and please let me know if you need any more information or 
action from our side.

Vincent.

Dear Vincent,

Thank you for letting us know about this.

There is a clear distinction between sponsors and donors on one hand 
(listed both at https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/sponsorship.html) who 
contribute their funds to the discretion of the QGIS.ORG project and 
other financial contributors who fund a developer or company directly to 
develop a specific feature. Such a contribution is often unknown to us 
at QGIS.ORG and the developer should take care about giving credits in 
the visual changelog.

For this particular improvement I can't find a corresponding entry in 
the QGIS 3 visual changelog at 
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog30/index.html. 
Perhaps it was forgotten to add this new improvement? Nyall - do you 
know more about this?

Vincent: we will definitely list you as a contributor in the visual 
changelog - but first we'll have to find the corresponding entry - we 
need the help from Nyall here.

Greetings,
Andreas
QGIS.ORG treasurer

Hey Nyall!

Unfortunately, it doesn't... would that really be the only way to do this?
Or what could someone do wrong for these three lines of code to fail their purpose?

Try using QgsSettings instead (but I don't think this should be necessary):

s = QgsSettings()

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] save styles in spatialite with pyqgis
Message-ID: <6b01776fa2a033d4ae605815a03f4b53@clermontmetropole.eu>

 

Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to save styles from my layers into
spatialite. It's very easy with gui but I can't find out how to do it
with python. 

I search in the qgis API (method of QgsVectorLayer) and
pyspatialite but can't able to do it. 

How the code behind the button
"save styles in database" work ?

Message-ID: <5871a284-0891-f179-b237-9bce43498cf6@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm testing the the Processing script editor with custom python syntax.
It works super nice, but, after the scripts is saved and I want to close
the window this error pops up:

NotImplementedError: QgsProcessingAlgorithm.name() is abstract and must
be overridden

the script is correctly saved in the folder but is not loaded in Processing.

Some hints?

Thanks to all

Matteo

Have you implemented a name() method for your algorithm? The API has changed
a fair deal in 3.

Hi Tom,

yep I have both:


    def name(self):
        return 'myscatters'

    def displayName(self):
        return self.tr('My scatter Plots')


actually when restarting QGIS I have bot errors (for name and
displayname) and now the scripts are in Processing in the scripts
provider but I have a blank group name and a blank algorithm name..

Thanks

Matteo

Hi all,

In the vector layer properties dialog, Attributes form tab, I fail to
understand/find what enables those two widgets, hence what they are
supposed to do and how they could work.

If someone has some information, thanks for sharing.

Message-ID: <27F9E6A4-ADCF-40D2-B369-F15D7497A5B3@kyngchaos.com>

The non-working GRASS in the Mac QGIS 3 should be fixed now.  It appears the GRASS internals still don't like spaces in the path to GRASS -- this came from my adding "3" to the QGIS app name with a space.  The app is now without a space, "QGIS3.app".

It looks like the missing SAGA is also fixed by the rebuild (don't know why, it just happened).

REMINDER: My QGIS 3 package requires the python.org Python 3.  Other distributions/installations of Python are not supported (ie Homebrew, Macports, Anaconda...).

Sure why not? As long as you share the source of the people you distribute the plugins to you should be fine. Why not just share it publicly though? Also you will not be able to post your plugin to the QGIS plugin repo unless the source code, tracker etc. are also public.

A _private_ repository to _share_ a plugin ?
This is counter-intuitive.
Are you thinking about controlling who you share with ?
Are you thinking about a private plugin repository rather
than git repository ?

Hi

And just to add to Andrea’s reply, for each changelog entry there is an option to add who sponsored the entry and a link to their site. Vincent if you would like to supply me some text and a screenshot, I will be happy to add an entry to the changelog for this feature.


Thanks for supporting QGIS Vincent!

Regards

Tim

I don't see a direct mention of that PR in the visual changelog, however, I do see a lot of company logo's :-) Would our contribution allow for a mention either as a sponsoring company at the top of the page, or could someone add a small section about the new feature and add us as a sponsor there?

Well, it seems that running any GRASS Processing coughs up this error.  Mystery to me, permissions are correct for the app, nothing should be writing to the app, and if it is trying that's wrong.

The error doesn't help me try to figure out what's going on.  Help would be appreciated.

I believe it's this bug:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17555

The permission errors is caused because it's actually trying to
execute /Applications/QGIS3.app/Contents/MacOS/grass/etc/colors/grass
instead of the correct grass binary.

The bug is caused by this function:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7Utils.py#L130

It's trying to automatically generate the grass executable path, but
it's incorrectly finding the colors/grass folder and deciding that
it's the grass executable. I think inserting a os.path.isfile check
somewhere around line 145 should fix this, but not having access to an
osx install I haven't been able to test this.

Hope that helps -- would be great to have this one sorted for 3.0.1 if
you can confirm a fix!

Thank you, Tim. I'm aware about this points you're remarking.

You made me think a lot about the bussines model to follow. I appreciate
that.

Yes, that looks like the source of the problem.  The os.walk() finds the color file named "grass" before it has a chance to find the real "grass72" file at the top level of the grasspath.  Though this is odd since it looks like os.walk by default should return a folder's info before it walks subfolders.

I don't think a file check will help, since it finds a file from the returned files list.  I do think the walking the whole grasspath tree is excessive.

I'm not sure what exactly you want to use os.path.isfile() for, but
etc/colors/grass is a file in GRASS GIS since 7.2, so os.path.isfile() will
return True. In unix, you can see if the file is executable with
os.access(name, os.X_OK) (not sure if instead or in addtion to
os.path.isfile()). On Windows, testing for .bat or some other extension
might be the right test.

Best,
Vaclav

I figured it out - the break in searchFolder() only breaks the cmd loop, leaving the walking to continue, eventually finding the last occurrence of the cmd.  I posted my fix to the bug report.

Ah sorry - I had the impression from somewhere that colors/grass is a folder.

Hi all,

I really don't know if I'm missing something basic, but even with this
super short script (that does not run anything):


from processing.algs.qgis.QgisAlgorithm import QgisAlgorithm


class myScript(QgisAlgorithm):

    INPUT = 'INPUT'
    OUTPUT = 'OUTPUT'


    def group(self):
        return 'My group'

    def name(self):
        return 'my algorithm'


from the editor I can run it (and the dialog pops up normally, even
without parameters), I can save it, but when I close it than the same
error appears:

NotImplementedError: QgsProcessingAlgorithm.name() is abstract and must
be overridden


Cheers and thanks for any hint

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing plugin questions
Message-ID: <CAK=gHb_pqhdJ6-nsi1Y1nHd1ckdQ9cnAoDs9LM575btZFC9HgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Two questions regarding Processing Plugin development for QGIS 2.18.17 :

   1. How should I go about customizing the default Processing Algorithm
   user interface? I need to make the help panel a little bit wider, but the
   GeoAlgorithm and AlgorithmProvider classes doesn't seem to provide any way
   to accomplish this.
   2. I'm also trying to have the
   *ProcessingConfig.USE_FILENAME_AS_LAYER_NAME* option set to True but for
   some reason it doesn't seem to to work. The Output layer keeps being loaded
   with the default parameter name from the algorithm. I'm using the following
   line of code:

ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue(ProcessingConfig.USE_FILENAME_AS_LAYER_NAME,
> True)
>

I tried setting a different option, like*
ProcessingConfig.KEEP_DIALOG_OPEN, *and it behaves as expected, which leads
me to believe my code isn't terribly wrong. Is there anything else I should
pay attention to?

Thanks in advance!
André

Sophie,

This means  there is a probably something in your resources.py that causes the crash. Could you share that file and your resources.qrc that you used to generate resources.py?

@ Michel: Does my answer make sense to you?
Does anyone have an additional idea that I could try to compile the resource file successfully?

Hi,
then again a resources.py file is created that makes QGIS3 crash.
Best,
Sophie

And if you first run:
call C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\py3_env.bat

and after that:
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Scripts\pyrcc5 –o resources.py resources.qrc

Hey,

My problem is solved.

I just created a new plugin with the QGIS Plug-In Builder and ran in the
OSGeo4W Shell:

cd
C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\myplugin
call qt5_env.bat
call py3_env.bat
pyrcc5 -o resources.py resources.qrc

This created the resources.py file and I could load the plugin without
crash in QGIS.

I am not sure what made QGIS crash when doing exactly this for the previous
plugin, on which I I tried your suggestions. I attached both the
resources.py and resources.qrc files of the previous plugin that caused the
QGIS crashes. I will now continue working with the newly created and
compiled one.

Thanks for your support,

Sophie

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem with symbology rule containing
	@atlas_featureid
Message-ID: <19edfbdf72a72cc7337e990d067bb008@carto.net>

Hi, 

I noticed a big problem in the rule based renderer when PostgreSQL
layers are involved and the rule contains @atlas_featureid. 

As an example, I use this rule: 

$id != @atlas_featureid 

When I click on the "Test" button I get "Filter returned xxxx features".
So far so good. But the bad thing: nothing is drawn on the canvas! 

Could it be that the expression compiler tries to forward this query,
but PostgreSQL knows nothing about @atlas_featurid ? 

Can someone confirm that this really is the case before I file an issues
report? 

Thanks a lot, 

Andreas

 Deep Learning model applied to Remote Sensing Data
Message-ID: <CAFAcyjXqEpj_fOkAu7DZtSAWoy3R7PJSJxEd3hs6pKC1+OvMag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there!

I'm a Computer Science Master's Degree student whose research if focused on
Deep Learning algorithms applied to Remote Sensing. Currently working at
the Laboratory of Image Processing and Geoprocessing
<https://github.com/lapig-ufg> settled at Federal University of Goiás -
Brazil. I'm also member of the High Performance Computing group of the same
university (more information here
<http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/7985061476854055>).

Below I present an idea to explain how I can contribute to OSGeo/QGIS
community and I'm seeking for mentors interested in assist my development.
Please, feel free to argue me any matter about the project idea.

I would also appreciate a lot if you guys indicate a potential interested
mentor to my project idea.

Hope there's some Interested ones out there!

Idea

The increasing number of sensors orbiting the earth is systematically
producing larger volumes of data, with better spatiotemporal resolutions.
To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as
Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable
Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation)
rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use
(LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels
observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g.
Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use
in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and
grasslands.

This potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a
specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time
dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g.
LSTM) to classify, for example, a Sentinel time-series, that will organize
and preprocess the input data set (e.g. labeled time-series), calibrate and
evaluate a RNN model, and finally classify an entire region (i.e. 2 or 3
scenes) to produce a map for one or more LCLU class. It will be great
evaluate the accuracy and the spatial consistent of a map produced with a
RNN approach.

The RNN model can then be shipped into a QGIS Plugin with a convenient
interface such that one could accomplish the following tasks:


   - Select the input data;
   - Adjust some model hyperparameters (if desirable);
   - Train the RNN;
   - Export the generated model for persistence;
   - Use the model to produce a LCLU map for the specified targets.

The idea is to start a new Plugin that use not only RNN models, but, in the
future, incorporate many other novel approaches to perform accurate LCLU
maps, like semantic segmentation using U-Nets and a combination of the two
approaches.

A simple example on classifying LCLU with two classes (pastureland and
non-pastureland):

Not everyone probably wants (or has the resources) to train the data. Why
not, for example, have a model zoo platform where users can share their
models for particular defined classifications? or will the training always
be lightweight and instant?

Hello Akbar,

This is an important remark. The Plugin could provide three scenarios at
all:

   1. Train the model from scratch (when there's sufficient computational
   resources);
   2. Use Transfer Learning, that is, use models with pre-trained weights;
   3. Like you suggest, fetch the desired model from a *zoo platform* suitable
   to his data.

An important caveat, although, is that the models can be very
region-specific, that is when the scenarios 1 and 2 are applicable. Also,
user can fetch well consolidated models from the *model zoo platform* as
basis and tune their models as of them.

I'm going to write my proposal right away, so that ideas are going to take
place. As soon as I have the first version of it I will share with you guys.

Thank your for you precious advices!

Cheers

Don't forget to also research some things (or maybe other developers who
know will comment on this thread right away), that:

   1. Even when users want to train a model themselves, the environment in
   Python Plugin wouldn't make it easy e.g. for running on GPU
   2. Designing a network is an art in itself. The goal of the plugin
   should be clear, to facilitate users who are familiar with DL or for
   general QGIS users? to create really good models or to apply the models? (I

   3. Transfer learning is not out of the box (I wrote my thesis about
   this). It depends on many things from the architecture itself to the data

   general QGIS users in my opinion.

It would also help if you make more detailed use cases so people would
understand about what this plugin will do.

Good luck!

I have a couple of new updates to my plugins that have been awaiting
approval since Monday:

Version 1.1:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Multi_Ring_Buffer/

Version 0.4:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SelectWithin/

The current versions live in the repo do not work with QGIS 3.0. There
were some minor changes to the API between 2.99 and 3.0 when the
plugins were converted.

So I have had a couple of bug reports:

https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/MultiRingBuffer/issues/6
https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/MultiRingBuffer/issues/8

Would be good to get these live soon.

Thanks

Evandro,

This is a research interest of mine. I would be happy to mentor or
otherwise be involved. I've been an SOC mentor a few times in the past.
This looks quite promising.

The Plugin will only ship the created (untrained) RNN, which in turn will
be trained with the user's data to generate a trained model.

It is truth that designing a model is an art itself and could take a lot of
time of my project. The ideas proposed in my previous e-mail could also lie
at the *future work *session of the project, but, at time, they act like
good motivations to start the development of a new plugin that makes use of
Deep Learning Algorithms.

Cheers

Hi Tim,

I'm very glad to know you are interested on my project! Now I'm going to
write the proposal and, as soon as its first version is done, I'll share it
with you.

Any issue about the project idea or the GSoC itself, please, feel free to
get in touch with me.

Thank you very much,

Evandro Carrijo Taquary
Federal University of Goiás

Does it help if you inherit from QgsProcessingAlgorithm instead?
There's no need to inherit from QgisAlgorithm here, you should use the
base class directly.

I suspect these are only available for list/map field types - which as
far as I'm aware are only available for the postgres provider.

Hi Matteo,

I encountered the same problem when starting processing script creation from
scratch for QGIS 3.0.0. However, the  Plugin Builder
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pluginbuilder/>   by  GeoApt LLC
<http://geoapt.net/>   can create a processing plugin template. It includes
also class that can be used directly as a processing script. I tried it in
the QGIS 3.0.0 and it worked.

Hope it helps,
Erno

Hi Nyall,

nope.. I already changed that so that now the class inherits from
QgsProcessingAlgorithm.

I also noticed that I have to put:

def createInstance(self):
  return type(self)()

else the algorithm will crash..


Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] "failed to load!" - loading vector files into
	pyQGIS (outside QGIS)
Message-ID: <BN6PR18MB1043BFC73CDCA2C992675F78E6AF0@BN6PR18MB1043.namprd18.prod.outlook.com>

Hello I am currently trying to learn PyQGIS. At almost the beginning I have encountered a problem loading a shapefile into pyqgis, using a standalone application (in this case, Pyscripter 3.2.2, 32 bit). I have tried both QGIS 3.0 (newest OSGeo4w version) and 2.18 standalone with OSGeo4w applications, with Python 3.6/2.7 respectively, all being 32 bit. The operating system is windows 10 home, 64 bit.

I have tried using several different shapefiles (.shp extensions). They can all be loaded into the different versions of QGIS. I have followed https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/loadlayer.html#vector-layers , and tried with small variations (changing the path from “/path/to/file.shp” to r”path\to\file.shp”) that GIS stack exchange have suggested.

The current python code is:

  1.  from qgis.core import *
  2.  import qgis.utils
  3.  import os
  4.
  5.  QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('C:/qgis218/apps/qgis-ltr', True)
  6.  qgs = QgsApplication([], True)  #has also tried with False
  7.
  8.  qgs.initQgis()
  9.
  10. data_source = r"C:\python_qgis\airport_tutorial\ne_10m_airports.shp"
  11. layer = QgsVectorLayer(data_source, "airports", "ogr")
  12.
  13. if not layer.isValid():
  14.     print ("Layer failed to load!")
  15. print "File Path points to a file: ", os.path.isfile(data_source)

(the prefix path is correct according to QGIS’ own python console, using print QgsApplication.showSettings() )

The code always returns “layer failed to load!” even though the file path is correct.
I would therefore like to ask what might be the problem here? If more information is needed, please say.
Thanks in advance!
Best regards,
Jonas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3 on Ubuntu 17.10 uninstallable?
Message-ID: <CAEDrt3_fsAuCOHbALJ8AO8gD6Y5vQi01-Z2qGBF=LKd3G+qwhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to install QGIS Release / Nightly-Release on Ubuntu 17.10.

I've added the repos:
deb http://qgis.org/debian artful main
deb-src http://qgis.org/debian artful main

but I get the following error while trying to apt-get it:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 qgis : Depends: python-qgis (= 1:3.0.1+27artful) but
1:3.1.0+git20180323+4c4e8ac+27artful is to be installed

        Recommends: qgis-plugin-grass but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

If I try the debian-nightly-release repo I get the following error:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:

Message-ID: <CAEDrt39aayy1pf13qfpsG53u4uxKPi2rT8Gxs24z1ypr7BBWew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been following the building guide on Ubuntu 17.10 and came across the
following issue while running "make install" without root, then I get the
error message:

CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:36 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot set permissions on "/apps//apps/man/man1/qgis.1"

If I run it with sudo it installs fine
should it work without root?

I suppose you intended it to work without root, because I needed to the
following commands without $HOME or ${HOME} after running "sudo make
install" in order to run QGIS:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${HOME}/apps/lib/
$HOME/apps/bin/qgis

Suppose I run make install, should I still be able to run QGIS from the
repos without any issues?

Kind Regards,
Idan

If you have previously had a development edition such as 2.99 or 3.1 
installed and you want to install the stable version you will need to 
uninstall more packages until these errors go away. There is not a 
direct upgrade path from a master to a stable.

The build instructions advise to put an apps dir in your home path e.g.

~/apps

If you choose to put apps in the root path i.e. /apps you must make sure 
you have given yourself permissions to that path.

These messages tell me this is an upgrade rather than a clean install. 
Packages already installed on your system are of versions that can only 
be upgraded to 3.1 (development release) because these existing packages 
are a development release like 2.99 or 3.1. They do not install because 
you have pointed apt at the stable repositories so they are not 
available in those repositories.

If you have only uninstalled some packages you need to remove the ones 
that are generating these error messages.

When you change repos the messages change because you are installing a 
different version of Qgis and it needs different packages and apt will 
still run into the same problem that the packages already in the system 
are development release and can only be upgrade to another development 
release and do not match the stable release.

Uninstall python-qgis, qgis-providers etc. Do an apt autoremove if there 
is a list of packages that are no longer needed because it will probably 
include a lot of qgis related packages.

Thanks for your reply!
I followed the instructions as is, including setting:
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to ${HOME}/apps as advised.
So why does it try (and fail) to set the file /apps//apps/man/man1/qgis.1 ?

Hi Idan,

what's important in the end is what's in the CMakeLists.txt in your
build folder, I'd suggest to have a look at the content of this file
first (and possibly re-run cmake or ccmake with different parameters
until you get the desired CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).

> Suppose I run make install, should I still be able to run QGIS from
the repos without any issues?

As long as it's installed to a different prefix: totally

Cheers
Matthias

Hi Erno,

thank for the input, with this template it is working. I don't know what
I was missing.

Thanks to all for the help

Hi all,

after this issue I had, I was thinking.. Why not implementing a kind of
template for scripts? Clicking on "create new script" the editor could
be filled with a template of functions (like @erno pointed out the
template of the Plugin Builder).

I can have a look at it, but I just want to hear some feedback on this
(if any is interested).

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

You may want to take a look to this blog post by Anita Graser:
https://anitagraser.com/2018/03/25/processing-script-template-for-qgis3/.
There is also her related twitter post:
https://twitter.com/underdarkGIS/status/977834578638405637. Based on the
comments there seems to be interest for such template to appear when one
clicks the "Create new script".

I take that back - I'd made a mistake. Can you open a ticket and share

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQgis,
	How to get the list of colors by pixel values
Message-ID: <10570421.fx7J9stiNo@thinkpadx1>

Hello everyone,

For example, if you have loaded a integer raster image, this raster showed in 
Qgis with colors by pixel values (automatic or modified by user). How to get, 
by pixel value the correspondent color as is drawed in Qgis? I need the list 
of colors for all pixel values for specific layer (raster with only integer or 
byte data type without color table).

Thanks!

Xavier Corredor Ll.

Can you please test https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6676 and confirm

Hi all,

Besides a custom python template, it would be also cool to have a small
set of functions.. in 2.18 there was a button in the UI with the chance
to load some functions.

What about resurrecting it?

I found this old topic started from Victor:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2015-November/040140.html

I don't know if this could be of interest (and actually where is the
correct place to put this functions being aware that this "box" could be
filled in a second moment)

Cheers

Matteo

Please bear with me while I dig through 3 months of email and posts to see

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iJbKVRCmYN2vNdpcOLWARKrDrPhUddK=R5PBCaAXysEoA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers,

I feel ashamed to write this, but for the betterment of the QGIS community,
I think this is for the best.

Nowadays I am working mostly on ML problems, I rarely get the chance to
work on QGIS (ok, I just checked the last checked out upstream QGIS and it
is almost 1 year ago - please don't throw something at me :)). Every once
in a while, I would get emails asking about some issues in the plugin -
which I always thought I would be able to spend some time to fix the
problem, but in reality it is not the case.

So, with this email, I am asking if there is someone willing to maintain it
with better care? I am happy to transfer it if it would be well taken care
of.

Regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pass a custom parameters at session level when
 connect to postgreSQL with QgsDataSourceURI
Message-ID: <c141b01f-57c5-c093-4a7a-ab6fb23a1421@orange.fr>

Hi every one,

I'm developping a QGIS 2.18 plugin that works with a multiuser 
postgreSQL database.

I need to create a connection with postgreSQL/Postgis and pass some 
custom parameters to the session (SET SESSION variable) to handle some 
row-level access (postgres 9.5 - Create policy). For that I try to use 
QgsDataSourceURI from 2.18 pyqgis API. But I can't figure out how to 
pass custom parameters at the session level with this tool. I need that 
to add layers to QGIS that would be automatically filtered by this 
custom parameters which works with my postgreSQL policy.

See for a more detailled explanation of the problem, I have this related 
question on GIS Stack Exchange:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/276292/loading-postgres-layer-with-session-parameter-set-using-pyqgis

Thank's in advance for answers!

Hi, 

I noticed that many of my computers currently show an error on the core
plugin "GdalTools" - it complains about metadata. 

Probably it just needs a small update in the metadata of the plugin? 

Do others have a similar issue? 

Thanks for your reply,

Hi, 

It seems to be a leftover old version. Nyall told me that the GdalTools
plugin is obsolete and its functionality included in Processing. So it
can be removed manually. 

However, for OSGeo4W I wonder if the OSGeo4W installer could handle this
removal - Jürgen - what do you think? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Seems a good idea because this kind of error can put the regular user think
that the module is broken.

Hi Jürgen, 

I had to manually remove the folder C:\Program
Files\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\python\plugins\GdalTools 

Seems like this plugin is obsolete in QGIS 3x, Processing took over. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi,

Not GDALTools only; fTools folder was also left by installation when moving
from 2.16 to 2.18.
This has recenly been mentioned in
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-Is-the-apps-qgis-folder-cleared-before-installing-a-new-QGIS-version-in-osgeo4w-td5355924.html
and has an older bug report at https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16318.
Manual cleanup seems to be required...

Regards,
Harrissou

Message-ID: <CA+8mANnwuXzcfdgYbEXzPV4wEUbrDCA8jEYdVtvACyD1E6ryqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am interested in making reproducible PDF figures in QGIS3, and therefore
want to work from the console/PyQGIS. Thanks to some previous helpful
advice here
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/274199/qgis-3-pdf-output-with-python>,
the problem is successfully reduced to setting up the QgsPrintLayout. I am
not sure how to do this, below is my best attempt so far:

#setup the background classes for managing the project
canvas =iface.mapCanvas()
manager = project.layoutManager()#new layout
layout = QgsPrintLayout(project)
layout.initializeDefaults()
layout.setName('console')
itemMap = QgsLayoutItemMap(layout)
itemMap.setExtent(canvas.extent())
layout.addLayoutItem(itemMap)#add the layout to the manager
manager.addLayout(layout)

The "console" layout is successfully added to QGIS 3 and I can open it to
see if the content is satisfactory. The map does not render and its extent
is nan,nan,nan,nan. How do I setup the extent and size of the map object in
the layout?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Build new plugin in QGIS 2 or QGIS 3?
Message-ID: <636B5AF2-1E85-4DEE-BAF1-AE0F7DBAE3D2@gmail.com>

Hi,

Should I build a new plugin in QGIS 2 or 3? 

I've been tasked with building a new plugin, but given that QGIS 3 just came out I’m not sure whether I should build it in QGIS 2 or 3. 

Basically, the plugin will:
1) clip/extract a raster layer by a vector/polygon layer
2) combine that clipped/extracted raster with some additional data (from a csv I think), resulting in an output of new raster dataset(s) and one large data table

A little more background:
	- I’m pretty much brand new to QGIS (if you haven’t noticed by now :)). I have downloaded both 2.18 and 3 and played around with them a bit, but I’m still pretty new to it all.
	- I do have some programming experience (including some, although not a ton, with Python).
	- I’ll be using a Mac
	- I'm hoping to have the plugin ready by sometime in July 
(also, in a related note, am I crazy to have signed on to do this?)

Thanks for any help you can provide,
Phil Ribbens

Start with an algorithm in the toolbox. Should be possible to write
something that works for either version, afaik.

Depending on your client and what they currently run, decide if you need
a plugin (custom GUI is really the only benefit here), and which version
they are comfortable with. I would target 3, and port back to 2.18 if
needed.

Timeframe seems reasonable.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Jürgen,

To be honest - I don't know anymore. I did not check before deletion.

But I believe it contained regular .py and .pycs - just like any other 
plugin.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS - how to handle primary keys in geopackage
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_F=And-9_uE2jFcHXq2n1wN7PrmS96e+wgX+A4LEQUEtg@mail.gmail.com>

My multipart split plugin (which I am porting to 3), It breaks multipart
features and transforms each part in individual features, copying the
attributes from the original feature.

In the process, I need to be careful with the autoincrement primary keys.
For PostGIS and Spatialite, asking for the providers pkattributesindex
works and I can do the following:

new_attributes = feature.attributes()

# When attribute is a Primary Key, replace by default value
### This is not working well with spatialite provider###
for j in provider.pkAttributeIndexes():
    if provider.defaultValue(j):
        new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)
    else:
        new_attributes[j] = QVariant()

But for geopackage the provider.pkAttributeIndexes() always returns an
empty list...

The above code was copied a long time ago from the split features tools in
core. Looking at the code now, there is no longer that part where the
provider's primary keys are searched, Nevertheless, the code works and the
split features tool leave the pkattributes NULL to be autogenerated. Wasn't
able to figure out where that is done now ...

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi all,

I discovered two more WFS related issues, one in QGIS Desktop the
other in the Server.

I setup a WFS service, with both QGIS Server 2.18 and Mapserver, with
a layer than contains 5.6million points.
The QGIS WFS client pulls this layer without issues, but there is a
big problem when identifying features with the option "auto open form"
enabled:
on the second identify operation QGIS freezes and it start to leak
memory until it eats it all. It does not happen if the "auto open
form" option is not enabled. This happens also on QGIS 3.

The second issue is about the same dataset published as WFS with QGIS
Server, when saving the layer using QGIS using "save as" (for example
to a geopackage) the result is missing several features/points.
I tried then to save the layer using ogr from th CLI, and at some
point the message "ERROR 1: XML parsing of GML file failed : unclosed
token at line 109413441, column 21" is shown. This is not happening
(and the result is complete) if server used is Mapserver.

I can provide the services URLs is someone wants to give it a try.


cheers!

The canonical/correct 3.0 way to do this is to use
QgsVectorLayerUtils.createFeature

That method should be used whenever you are creating a brand new
feature which is destined for a particular vector layer, and needs to
correctly respect constraints and default value clauses set on the
provider side.

I answered over on stackexchange too, but for completeness:

You need to set a size for the map item (usually you do this before
setting the extent):

itemMap.attemptResize(QgsLayoutSize(50, 60, QgsUnitTypes.LayoutMillimeters))
itemMap.attemptMove(QgsLayoutPoint(1,2,QgsUnitTypes.LayoutMillimeters))
itemMap.setExtent(...)

This is because the call to setExtent uses the item size for various
scale and aspect ratio calculations, and initially a new item is
created with an empty size.

Also, you may want to consider using zoomToExtent(...) instead -
setExtent can change the item's size to ensure that the map item
matches the aspect ratio of the extent, whereas zoomToExtent will
never resize the item and instead zooms out the extent until it fits
completely within the existing item size.

For future reference, this is fixed now. It was caused by the canvas
initially having the @atlas_featureid variable having a null value
(until an atlas is opened), so the expression was effectively $id !=
NULL (which is always false).

In contrast the Test button would set a @atlas_featureid to 0 if a
real feature id wasn't available - so it was reporting matching
features.

Now the canvas uses the same approach as the test button and defaults
@atlas_featureid to 0 if it's not yet set.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjXLyQxQmfL5L60awSEHwmw+v7qA3rkTipVkQfr8b1fjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all/Jürgen,

I'd like to raise a call for the version of Qt in osgeo4w and the QGIS
windows builds to be upgraded to 5.10.1 (or at least 5.9.4).

I've been watching the bug tracker following the release of 3.0 and
trying to fix crashes where I can, but there's a LOT of strange crash
reports coming from deep within Qt internals on the windows builds.

E.g.

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18566
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18528
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18498
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18483
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18570
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18569
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18260
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18548 (this is a duplicate of 18260)
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18470
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18460
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18306

I'm at a loss how to proceed with these, and I'd like to rule out
underlying issues in Qt as the cause. I've also personally seen many
crashes with the 3d functionality on windows (again, from deep within
Qt3d internals), which I believe are usually caused by graphics card
drivers... BUT... Qt3d is a relatively new component and I'm sure
we're missing many upstream fixes by not running on 5.10.1/5.9.4.

Would you be in favour of bumping the version?

Cheers,
Nyall

Thank you Nyall!

That solved the problem. I failed to see that in the C++ code for split
features tool, but it was there.

The only small annoyance that I had was the need to convert the result of
feature.attributes() into a dictionary.


Once again, thanks! It solved a long-standing issue in the plugin.

If I'm right you can change the 'maintainer' in the plugins website (and
eventually metadata.txt in your plugin).

Log in, go to your plugins, go to 'Manage' tab and Edit there.

If you do not see the Manage tab, let us know.

We are talking about your own plugins isn't it?
Or is it about transferring owner/maintainership from 'orphaned' plugins?

Hi giovanni,

I'd like to try the WFS QGIS Server service ?

I don't know whether it's of interest, but note that I also have
qgis-rel-dev and qgis-dev installed and in these "branches", there are
fTools and GDALTools folders but those are empty (except the "Tools" folder
also empty).
However for any QGIS version, these two plugins are listed in the Plugin
Manager.

Hi,

Thanks Nyall. Indeed, these are PG provider tools. I dug a bit and found
out that list is designed for array field type while key/value refers to
hstore field type.
Doc is updated (might be light but better than nothing imho).

You need to amend your PATH environment variable to point to the folder 
that has those DLLs in it (leave them in the folder they were originally in)

Message-ID: <fe340e6b-9bed-ff88-e7c1-a9171f3572d6@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

The issue #16462 QGIS Server lost the ability to cascade WMS layers 
published using HTTPS is a bit annoying for GetPrint. It also concernes 
XYZ layers with https.

I have found this message in logs : Download of capabilities failed: SSL 
handshake failed

Is it possible to explicitly ignore SSL errors in QGIS Server ?

Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS3 plugin migration issue
Message-ID: <CAK=gHb_hwjBeVk1mqx=pHd_PqtLgZ-8zak9SDBnZBEvvkfY2Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm porting an existing Geoprocessing Algorithm plugin to QGIS 3 and I'm
having some trouble customizing the default dialog.
On QGIS 2.x the following code worked:

class TestAlgorithm(GeoAlgorithm):
>     INPUT = 'INPUT'
>     OUTPUT = 'OUTPUT'
>

>
    def getCustomParametersDialog(self):
>         customDialog = AlgorithmDialog(self)
>         customDialog.textShortHelp.setFixedWidth(450)
>         return customDialog
>

On QGIS 3 however, the getCustomParametersDialog() method is gone. I
assumed it was replaced by the new createCustomParametersWidget(), but
unfortunately this method doesn't seem to get called by the parent class:

    def createCustomParametersWidget(self, parent):
>         customDialog = AlgorithmDialog(self)
>         customDialog.textShortHelp.setFixedWidth(450)
>         return customDialog
>

I also tried manually creating the dialog, but I get a message saying that
the *'AlgorithmDialog' object has no attribute 'textShortHelp'.*

alg =
> QgsApplication.processingRegistry().algorithmById('test:testAlgorithm')
> dlg = AlgorithmDialog(alg)
> dlg.textShortHelp.setFixedWidth(450)
> dlg.show()
>

Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance!
André

After some digging, I found that while the textShortHelp object is not
directly available in the AlgorithmDialog class anymore, i was able to
access it like this:

shortHelpObj = dlg.findChild(QTextBrowser, 'textShortHelp')

Is this the expected behavior?
