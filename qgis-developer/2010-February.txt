Hi devs,

I'd like to announce that Manuel Massing is the new maintainer of the 
georeferencer plugin. Manuel worked, together with Maxim and the gislab team, 
on an improved version of the original georef plugin and he will coordinate 
the further development of the plugin. 

Manuel, welcome to the team!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 'QgsColorRampShader' is not defined
Message-ID: <413273.72525.qm@smtp147.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

i'm trying to work on Raster Layer and the palette configuration.

My problem is that when i try to define a new QgsColorRampShader the 
system says that the name is not defined.
Here the example from Python Console:
 >>> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
 >>> myRasterLayer = mc.currentLayer()
 >>> myRasterLayer.setRasterShaderFunction(None)
 >>> myRasterShaderFunction = QgsColorRampShader()
exceptions.NameError: name 'QgsColorRampShader' is not defined
Do someone know why this happen?

Thank you Michele.

This class wasn't present in the PyQGIS. Fixed in svn trunk r12856.

thank you for taking me on board! :-)

To make sure the credits go to the right person I'd like to clarify that most 
of the recent georeferencer improvements are due to Maxim Dubinin
&team, I just did some work on the reprojection underpinnings.

I hope to update the georeferencer in qgis trunk soon, pending a go-ahead from
Maxim.

cheers,
	Manuel

These options could be easily added, but we tried to keep the plugin as simple 
as possible to demonstrate the usage of QgsPluginLayer. Maybe we will add 
these in a future version.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis and string replacement
Message-ID: <871587.76670.qm@smtp124.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I have another problem related to the string replacement in QGis.
I want to read a QGis Style file at runtime and write in another file 
some modifications.

If I try to execute the single command in Python Console everything 
is working and my line is changed, while if I execute it in my plugin 
nothing happen.

Do you know where i made a mistake?

This is a part of the file:
     ...
     <customColorRamp>
       <colorRampType>LINEAR</colorRampType>
       <colorRampEntry red="0" blue="143" value="1.000000" green="0" 
label="Color entry 1" />
       <colorRampEntry red="0" blue="159" value="2.000000" green="0" 
label="Color entry 2" />
       <colorRampEntry red="0" blue="175" value="3.000000" green="0" 
label="Color entry 3" />
     ...

This is what i exec in Python Console:
 >>> fIn = 
open("C:\\Users\\Michele\\.qgis\\python\\plugins\\KitICT\\style\\colormap64.qml","r")
...
 >>> szLine = fIn.readline()
 >>> delta = (54.0-42.0+1)/64.0
 >>> i=0
 >>> szToSearch = "value=\"" + str(i+1) + ".000000\""
 >>> szToReplace = "value=\"" + str(round(42.0 + i*delta,6)) + "\""
 >>> szLine.replace(szToSearch, szToReplace)
<colorRampEntry red="0" blue="143" value="42.0" green="0" 
label="Color entry 1" />

And this is my function:
     ...
     fIn  = open(szFileIn, "r")
     fOut = open(szFileOut, "w")

     i = 0
     delta = (nMax-nMin+1)/64

     szLine = fIn.readline()
     while len(szLine) > 0:
         if szLine.find("<colorRampEntry") > -1:
             szToSearch = "value=\"" + str(i+1) + ".000000\""
             szToReplace = "value=\"" + str(round(nMin + i*delta,6)) + "\""
             szLine = str(szLine)

             szLine.replace(szToSearch, szToReplace)
             fOut.write(szLine)
             i = i+1
         else:
             fOut.write(szLine)
         pass
         szLine = fIn.readline()
     pass

Where szFileIn and szFileOut are the path if the file to read/write 
and nMax/nMin are the minumun and maximum coming from bandStatistics.

I'm using QGis 1.0.2 Kore and I'm developing with Python.

Hi,

some notes about defining point symbol size in map composer legend:

finally I found a solution using a combination of "point symbol size",
activating checkbox "in map units" and using an attribute column for "area
scale".  

First I selected a point symbol size which looks ok in the legend then
I altered the attribute data column I used for the "area scale" by a factor
to make it draw to the correct size on the printed map. But here I realized
that what looks right in the map composer does not come out right in the pdf,
jpeg etc. (see attached image)

Is it possible to improve this behavior or procedure? I mean a) make it
easier to define point symbol size in a map composer legend and b) make 
the symbol size look the same in the map composer and in the pdf/jpg?

Should this go into the bugtacker as an enhancement proposal? 

I added an image where you can see the difference between the map composer
and an pdf export.

Regards,
 Otto

Message-ID: <26790998.1348321265204180071.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

 Hello,
I'm newbie with QGis and this is my first post.
I'm attempting to build the Qgis source that I've downloaded from https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_3_0
To do that I procedeed as described at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Installation_Guide.
I succeeded in downloading and installing all the dependencies and create the VS solution by using the Cmake command.
When I try to build the ALL_BUILD project as described in the Installation Guide, I get this error:

TemporaryFile.cc

..\..\..\src\core\spatialindex\tools\TemporaryFile.cc(34) : error C3861: 'open': identifier not found

..\..\..\src\core\spatialindex\tools\TemporaryFile.cc(52) : error C3861: 'close': identifier not found

..\..\..\src\core\spatialindex\tools\TemporaryFile.cc(92) : error C3861: 'close': identifier not found


It looks like the fstream library was not included but looking at source code of TemporaryFile.cc , you can see the Tools.h file is included and in this file is included fstream.

Now, my OS is Windows Vista Home Edition and I tried to build using Visual Studio 2005 SP1.

Someone can help me?
Thank you

Silvio

Hello

yesterday I downloaded the srs.db from Qgis SVN, I was looking 
for the new Italian srs added some days ago.

It seems to me that there are errors into the proj parameters:

*) For Italy Sardinia the "towgs84" is repeated twice.
*) Somewhere there are spaces after the decimal dot and after the 
   minus sign
*) For Sicily I have a different "towgs84" formula, which is:
   +towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08

Please can someone confirm that before I open a ticket?


Here it is what I read from the srs.db:

SELECT srs_id, description, parameters, epsg FROM tbl_srs WHERE 
srs_id >= 3640 AND srs_id <= 3643;

Hello, Niccolo.

I agree. The params you propose are the ones I have sometimes used successfully for Sicily. In any case, I prefer doing empirical tests to check that the result makes sense (for example comparing with Traspunto or using some geodetic benchmark.)

Also, I think Sicily is usually considered in zone 2, like Naples, Bari, etc, no? but in those parameters, the values for lon_0 and x_0 are the ones for zone 1, I think?

Regards,
Juan Lucas

Hi, the default plugin directory of QGIS are:

- the plugin directory inside QGIS install
- the plugin directory in your home directory

it would be nice to add another plugin directories, i.e. in a shared
folder, defined by an environment variable, i.e.

QGIS_ADDITIONAL_PLUGINDIR = ...........

any idea?

Thank you Martin.

Finally, I was unable to revert changes (some compilations) done on my
Ubuntu, so I had to install the last version (9.10).

Is good to see QGIS again!

Hi

first of all I would recommend you to try 1.4.0 release instead of
1.3. If that will fail with the same problem, you may want to upgrade
to MSVC 2008 (express edition is sufficient) - it's known to work.

Arpita,

Does your application produce a log file? If so, what is the content of this
file? This will help us a lot to know what is the reason of the trouble.

Maybe you should include the Microsoft C runtime libraries.
Do you set the qgis_prefix as '.' instead of the normal value?

Regards.

Germ?n

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Few improvements in PyQGIS
Message-ID: <e8e7199c1002041324u42500972sfe82ae66b3c9f987@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I hope this is a good news for developers using python. In svn trunk
(r12878) there are few additions that make QGIS API more pythonic.

QgsFeature allows direct access to attributes (get, set, delete attribute):
>>> f = QgsFeature()
>>> f[1] = QVariant("hello")
>>> print f[1].toString()
hello
>>> del f[1]
>>> print f.attributeMap()
{}

QgsVectorLayer and QgsVectorDataProvider support iterating (available
for those with sip >= 4.9).

layer.select([], QgsRectangle())
for f in layer:
  # do something with feature f

--- equals to ---

layer.select([], QgsRectangle())
f = QgsFeature()
while layer.nextFeature(f):
  # do something with feature f

That's it. The older idioms (using nextFeature) keep working too.

Inspired by a blog post from Sean Gillies:
http://sgillies.net/blog/952/iterators

Btw. fetching a list of values in an column gets this simple:
>>> lst = [ feat[1] for feat in layer ]
(just don't forget a select() call before iterating)

If you have any tips what other parts of QGIS API could be made more
pythonic, let me know.

Hi

Is there a preferred way of displaying help information from a Python plugin.

I'd like to display HTML help files located in the plugin directory.  I'm wondering if there is a class for displaying this in the same way as the main quantum help information?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions :-)

Message-ID: <340505ef1002041359g7189f405ve9ddbb1ca22ef803@mail.gmail.com>

I have submitted to trunk the new GRASS raster data provider.  It is
based on specialized GRASS modules compiled within QGIS, GDAL is not
used anymore.

GRASS functions are used to render colors, so it is always drawn
exactly like in GRASS. This was always required by users, but I think
that the possibility to change color table was useful. Unfortunately
current raster layer/provider architecture does not allow it for
raster providers.

GRASS groups of layers are not yet supported. Anybody using them?

This should fix
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1945
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2028

Please test, especially on Windows once it compiles (1am, MEST they say).

Hi Radim,
many thanks, really. I look forward to test this fixes on windows. Those
bugs are really show stoppers, especially during courses where most of
people uses windows (Vista/Seven).

I'll give feedback asap.

Hi Radim! Long time no write :).

Hi,
thanks for testing. It was caused by missing PACKAGE name for translations.
I have removed _() from those modules because QGIS is using a different system
of translations anyway.

Please try again.

Simply ......... marvellous.

Another nice feature would be, to fetch a value not only with integers, but
also by field name:

> Btw. fetching a list of values in an column gets this simple:
> >>> lst = [ feat[1] for feat in layer ]
> (just don't forget a select() call before iterating)

lst = [ feat["FIELDNAME"] for feat in layer ]

it would be a really nice feature!

Take a look at Potrace. Conveniently, gvSIG's Remote Sensing Extension
has integrated Potrace and contour line extraction support. It also
handles the grayscale conversion job quite nicely, all in one nifty
wizard interface and straight on your GIS raster layers.

If you don't want to go through all the trouble of downloading
gvSIG and the Remote Sensing Extension and installing them separately,
you can use our all-in-one installer package here:

Hi,

my (original) copy of Windows Vista stopped to work in the virtual
machine where I use to run it for tests. Can anyone with Vista/Seven
help check in qgis trunk (revision 12883, installable with the osgeo4w
installer) if bugs

 In the QDesktopServices class there's a openUrl method that should
use the user's preferred browser. You just have to construct a file:
URL to your documentation in a QUrl object. You can get the path to
your module's file from the __file__ member, but I did see recently
there's a python module that does that, but I can't remember what it's
called now...

 I think that's what Qgis help does, I'd have to look at the source to be sure!

 Ah, here's a snippet from a plugin wot I wrote. ArlatSettings is a
module in my plugin, and my help is all in the Documentation subdir:

import ArlatSettings

[more stuff]

  def runHelp(self):
      (arlatDir,fname) = os.path.split(ArlatSettings.__file__)
      docDir = os.path.join(arlatDir,"Documentation","index.html")
      # convert \ to / in urls even for windows
      docDir = docDir.replace("\\","/")
      QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl(docDir))

Hi

first of all I would recommend you to try 1.4.0 release instead of
1.3. If that will fail with the same problem, you may want to upgrade
to MSVC 2008 (express edition is sufficient) - it's known to work.

Martin

I tried release 1.4.0 compliled on another pc with MSVC2008 installed, but I got the same problem

Yes, the problem is that currently QgsFeature doesn't know how names
of the fields. It would need some more changes within QGIS core
library.

Hi,

I see an update in the postgis sql query editor plugin, but it says this plugin requires a missing resources_rc module. Any idea on how to overcome this invalid plugin warning. I do not see anything online from a quick search that would offer an obvious solution.

Hi Michael,

the code snippet misses

cd build/

before running cmake. cmake .. means that CMakeLists.txt will be
searched in the parent directory (correct me if wrong).

hope this helps and happy hacking :)

Then I guess that something will be wrong with your development
environment, just tried the compilation yesterday with MSVC 2008 and
worked fine... The functions that are missing should be found within
#include <unistd.h> - I think it should be picked up from OSGeo4W
include directory. I don't have much expertise with compilation of
QGIS on windows, maybe someone else will have a better idea...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Enhanced constraint violation error dialog while
	saving edits (feature request)
Message-ID: <25bc040b1002061712na18a8e3x3bc05b0cfdb636dd@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm referring to the thread "Visualizing topology errors and
supporting topology editing" and got a probably small feature request.

Look at following scenario:
Joe defines before hand some constraints in the database - say not
null, uniqueness, etc. - or even topology rules.
Then Joe captures and/or updates some features with their geometry and
attributes.
After having entered three objects he wants to check the validity and
hits a shortcut to do this (similar to change edit mode).
He then gets a list of two errors in a modal dialog. There, every line
indicates the feature id and the constraint violation text.
When clicking on such a line, the respective feature is highlighted.

Up to now, AFAIK, there's only the possibility to "change edit mode".
When clicking on it, a dialog entitled "Error while changing attribute
values" pops up and says "ERROR: null value in column "prov2name"
violates not-null constraint" - even when there are more than one
features affected.

So my proposal is:
1. Introduce a shortcut key to periodically "save/update edits"
without leaving edit mode.
2. Enhance current Error dialog as indicated above.

This would allow us to implement constraints and topology rules in the
database without any scripting involved on the QGIS side (unless you
want to set parameters interactively).

What do you think?

Regards, Stefan

well, i've something here :
/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/PyQt4/uic

and the file pyuic.py exist

but how i can make the link to that ?

the file /usr/bin/pyuic4 looks like that :
#!/usr/bin/env python
# there's no main function, so just import the module
import PyQt4.uic.pyuic


so what is wrong ?

Hi,
it seems to me, that files in the OSGeo4W qgis-dev package are updated
only if a source of target has changed, not if CMakeLists.txt has
changed. I.e. like if ccmake was not rerun. Is it possible, is it
correct?

Thanks
Radim

Hi,

try to build QGIS using this instructions
http://www.florianhillen.de/qgis-tutorial-en.html

All neccessary libraries are available from OSGeo4W installer.
I've build svn version with this manual and all works fine.

Well it's working ! thank you every one , and i'm so sorry !

the problem was that the defaut version of python is 2.4, the solution was
to change de defaut version of python to 2.6 and now it'w working,

but it is very weird because, in the ccmake i ask to take 2.6 ..........


well, thx everyone !

My build scripts just requests a review of the changes and doesn't build the
package, when CMakeLists.txt changes happen.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] embedded mapping component for Symbian Os devices
Message-ID: <74149.1100.qm@web59802.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am a java developer with basic GIS programming experience. I intend to start working on a mobile GIS solution (a simple GIS map viewer) I just started to take a look at Qt/C++. The language looks very promising especially for mobile or embedded systems development. I just went through the tutorial on the embedded mapping component.

I will like to ask if the code in that tutorial can be ported to a Symbian Os device ? How feasible will it be to develop a WMS map viewer using the QGIS embedded mapping component for Symbian OS devices ?

Is this feasible ? has anyone this before ? what are the challenges ??

Cheers,

Roman.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] bugfix and cheating
Message-ID: <4B70316C.4090806@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
As many of you know, our bug fixing initiative is very successful: with very limited
investments several users have been able to have their bugs fixed in a very short
time. Of course, the entire project is based on hard work, volunteering, goodwill,
and trust. This generally works very well.
Unfortunately I have to point out an unpleasant experience: one user (Greg Coats)
requested a bug fix, relative to a slow start up, and on date 21.1.2010 offered:
"I will provide $1,000.00 for a verifiably solution that yields start up times from
.qgs project files of no more than 30 seconds, delivered this month, and $500.00 for
a solution delivered next month."
The bug was promptly fixed the next day, thanks to Marco Hugentobler and others. The
Greg asked an OSX executable to check the solution. Next day, this was ready, thanks
to William Kyngesburye.
Now Greg is surprisingly refusing to donate the promised amount. I believe this is
unfair, and breaks the trust we are so rich of. In addition, he is complaining about
the project management, which is even harder to understand.
So, I'll have to be more careful with the next offers :(
BTW: I invite everybody to donate for our upcoming hackfest:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/3._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Pisa_2010
Even small amounts (buy your preferred dev a beer, a pizza, etc!) are useful, and
much appreciated.
All the best.

If all goes well, next release will probably be after the next hackfest, less that 2
months from now. However, is the release manager who has the last word on this.

You asked for osx executables, you got it, then started asking for Linux executables,
without specifying which flavour...

All the best.

Hi Greg

In my opinion, Paolo is right.

In your mail from 21.01., you write:

"This slow start up by Qgis 1.4.0 is the last remaining obstacle preventing 
me, and others, from adopting, and promoting Qgis. My small Qgis project can 
be downloaded from 
http://homepage.mac.com/gregcoats/jp2/images/dcua_reduce6_01.zip
I will provide $1,000.00 for a verifiably solution that yields start up times 
from .qgs project files of no more than 30 seconds, delivered this month, and 
$500.00 for a solution delivered next month."

So nothing about executables for all plattforms or making a release because of 
the bugfix (that would be real nonsense, btw).

My suggestion was to donate the money for the next hackfest in Pisa. I think 
this would be something really usefull for the community.

Regards,
Marco

 In my opinion, as soon as amounts of money starts being offered, you
get a contract written out and nailed down. Specify times (including
timezones - remember today is already yesterday for someone), places,
deliverables, verification procedures, arbitrators in the event of
dispute etc etc etc etc.

 If Qgis devs want to go bounty hunting then we need to see how the
open source community polices bounty hunting. Anyone got experience?

 So I think Greg can keep his money, we can all hiss and boo at him,
but it's a lesson learned.

 Oh, obligatory "I Am Not A Lawyer" (but I did date a girl who taught
law and read some of her Contract Law books. Crazy times!).

This is valuable lesson, but...

I guess it would be better for our community if you guys set arguing aside and reach
compromise (privately), may be somebody pay 50% and somebody may admit that was not
specific enough on deadlines. Just give some space for
misunderstanding and make peace.

As I see it, QGIS is making first steps in this direction and
experience may be sometimes frustrating. Treating QGIS as an org
providing bullet-proof warranties is a little premature.

I must say this is a very sad thread and sad story. I think it's
serious, as it shades bad lights on this community (and these are
words I'm collacting from collegues in these hours).
Anyway, as Barry, I think this can be a lesson that sponsorhip needs a
stronger legal ground, and the community should consider setting up a
common way to deal with these situations. Maybe a commonly defined
kind of contract? Maybe have a reference lawyer?
Words remain words, thay have poor legal effects, while they have
great effect on people and companies following this ml...

 I suspect ambiguity between his concept of 'a verifiable solution'
and 'delivered' and your concept. He (or Marco) fixed the bug in the
SVN version, gave you an OSX binary which you could run. That would
constitute (for Paolo) a 'verifiable solution' 'delivered' (to you).

 I'm not saying who (if anyone) is right here, and I probably
shouldn't try to second-guess anyone. SO....

 Greg and Paolo et al: how would you like to further define 'a
verifiable solution' and 'delivered'?

Turns out QDesktopServices.openUrl doesn't quite work on Windows with a file:// type url - at least in the version of Qt we are using.  But the good news is that it is already handled in Qgis.  The QgsInterface class has an openURL methods (note captilisation) that does the job.  It takes two parameters, a string (the url), and a boolean which if true causes it to look in the Qgis documentation folder.  So the code I ended up with (based on Barry's) is

import inspect
from os import path

...

    @staticmethod
    def help(iface):
        file = inspect.getsourcefile(pluginClass) 
        file = 'file://' + path.splitext(file)[0] + '.html'
        file = file.replace("\\","/")
        iface.openURL(file,False)      

Thanks for the pointers Barry

 In the QDesktopServices class there's a openUrl method that should
use the user's preferred browser. You just have to construct a file:
URL to your documentation in a QUrl object. You can get the path to
your module's file from the __file__ member, but I did see recently
there's a python module that does that, but I can't remember what it's
called now...

 I think that's what Qgis help does, I'd have to look at the source to be sure!

 Ah, here's a snippet from a plugin wot I wrote. ArlatSettings is a
module in my plugin, and my help is all in the Documentation subdir:

import ArlatSettings

[more stuff]

  def runHelp(self):
      (arlatDir,fname) = os.path.split(ArlatSettings.__file__)
      docDir = os.path.join(arlatDir,"Documentation","index.html")
      # convert \ to / in urls even for windows
      docDir = docDir.replace("\\","/")
      QDesktopServices.openUrl(QUrl(docDir))

under linux there was no problem, even with qgis 1.4, as your project
always opened in a matter of few seconds. If there was an issue under
windows I remember you that trough the osgeo4w installer you can have
every day(with a few mouse clicks) qgis running the latest code
available.

You asked for a package for OsX including the bug fix and you had it. If
I'm not wrong the OsX packager (William Kyngesburye) told that was
available to make, from time to time, dev qgis builds.

Am I missing something?

 The utility of the solution to you was not explicitly part of the
contract (from the original mailing posted by paolo). What does
'delivered' mean? The entirety of the contract (that I've seen) is:

"I will provide $1,000.00 for a verifiably solution that yields start
up times from
.qgs project files of no more than 30 seconds, delivered this month,
and $500.00 for
a solution delivered next month."

 For a $1000 contract I'd want a lot more information and
clarification. A unilateral contract like this becomes binding as soon
as someone completes the condition, so we are arguing here about
whether paolo (or anyone else) completed the condition. Hence
agreement over the terms of the condition are crucial. Putting the
solution into the latest Qgis SVN? Person A says that's "delivered".
Having the solution in the latest release on all platforms? That's
person B's idea.

 Perhaps Paolo was too trusting and I don't think he should have
accused you in public (and on the internet, in perpetuity) of
'cheating'. This is a private matter between individuals and probably
shouldn't have bled over onto the mailing lists.

 So in future, devs, keep your patches to yourself until you know
exactly what they want.

 Ah, the Qgis devs worked round that problem in qgisapp.cpp:

#elif defined(WIN32)
  if ( url.startsWith( "file://", Qt::CaseInsensitive ) )
    ShellExecute( 0, 0, url.mid( 7 ).toLocal8Bit().constData(), 0, 0,
SW_SHOWNORMAL );
  else
    QDesktopServices::openUrl( url );
#else

What does your Qt version do with file:// in Windows? The docs for Qt 4.5 say:

"If the URL is a reference to a local file (i.e., the URL scheme is
"file") then it will be opened with a suitable application instead of
a Web browser."

so unless you have .html set to open with something else (an editor?)
then it should work. ShellExecute just opens it with whatever
application is registered as well, note that they lop the 'file://'
bit off first.

Just for the records: this is obviously not true. I do not know whether Greg
genuinely does not understand, or if he just is looking for excuses.
However, this discussion seems boring enough, let's try and make the best out of it,
learning lessons for the future.
Regarding the legal coverage, this is simply not feasible with our budget. Most
donors put a few hundreds euros/dollars, sometimes much less, to fix each bug, so it
is imperative to keep the admin overhead as low as possible.
In general, the system is working very well, I do not see special reasons to change
it, unless much more substantial funding comes out.
We just hit the wrong individual, but that's a normal thing since now and then, and
it does not hurt the project too much IMHO.
Peace... ;)

This is not the way to solve the problems and make QGIS grow as software
project.

If Pablo has a problem with his data he may want to give us more details
(platform , qgis version, post a sample of the data that is giving
problems, etc.) to try understand where the issue may come from.

Exactly has you done, and -again- if I'm not wrong your problem was
solved.

I have heard that also gvSIG will adopt them. It would be a major strength
of freeGIS to have the same look and feel. And AFAIK Robert [1] is available

(indeed, I thought with QGIS 1.4 the new icons would already be the

I confirm - I'm ready to follow working on GIS icon them.
Just at the moment mostly concentrated on university duties and FOSS4G 
intensive promotion activities in Poland ;)
I remember Paolo your icon request  - hope to complete it this week..

Activities concentrate now on OSGeo Graphics [1] to get more people 
involved. Please open new tickets at trac if needed.

Hi

Updating the default icon theme is easy...but updating all qgis resources screenies, manuals etc to use the gis theme will take quite some work.

Personally I have grown used to and like Roberts theme (barring some small issues) but users who I speak to in most cases seem to prefer the current default. This may just be a case of accustomisation which will evaporate over time.

All that aside, the plan is to make the gis theme (with some tweaks) the default for QGIS 2.0 so we will indeed make the switch at some point after 1.5 is released and we start doing 1.9.x dev builds.

What happened with the Qt openUrl functio a file:// url was that nothing happened! There was a pause when it looked as if something should have happened - but then the application carried on and no browser window appeared.  Presumably this is the reason for the workaround in the source code.  The work-around does work - that is ShellExecute fires up the browser as expected.  I'm not sure what Qt is trying to do.  Anyway, I found QgsInterface function when I was looking through the source code for the Qt openUrl function - so your pointer was invaluable!

Thanks
Chris

 Ah, the Qgis devs worked round that problem in qgisapp.cpp:

#elif defined(WIN32)
  if ( url.startsWith( "file://", Qt::CaseInsensitive ) )
    ShellExecute( 0, 0, url.mid( 7 ).toLocal8Bit().constData(), 0, 0, SW_SHOWNORMAL );
  else
    QDesktopServices::openUrl( url );
#else

What does your Qt version do with file:// in Windows? The docs for Qt 4.5 say:

"If the URL is a reference to a local file (i.e., the URL scheme is
"file") then it will be opened with a suitable application instead of a Web browser."

so unless you have .html set to open with something else (an editor?) then it should work. ShellExecute just opens it with whatever application is registered as well, note that they lop the 'file://'
bit off first.

Hi,

in my python plugins I always use a simple procedure to search features by
value. I get every single feature in a loop, get the n-th field value, I
compare it with a number or a substring.
The problem is that the performance is poor (with shapefiles / postgis
layers with over 10.000 features).
But I don't know if there is another way to improve the performance. And,
sadly, it doesn't use the power of Postgres query to search features with
given in a boost of time.

Any idea?

I thought about it. But, in my humble opinion, the main disavantage is that
this method is used to view only those features on canvas, while I want to
search attributes to get some values. I.e. search for a road, etc.

Hi all.
I would suggest to move gdal tools to the main svn of QGIS: I think it is rather
mature, and allows users to easily accomplish common useful tasks. It introduces a
new dependency (on gdal utilities), but this shgould not be a problem on any platform
(gdal libs are needed anyway).
We at Faunalia are committed to maintain the plugin.
All the best.

Hi Roman,

having QGIS map canvas running on Symbian platform *should* be
possible. However I'm not aware of any effort done so far to make this
happen. If you're going to give it a try, you'll need to:
- get dependencies working on symbian: Proj4, GDAL, GEOS and Sqlite.
Some of them look easy [1], others feasible [2]. Generally all the
dependencies are projects with portable code, probably they'll need
some minor tweaks for the compiler
- get QGIS core and gui libraries working on symbian: this will also
probably need some small changes in build system

You've written you'd like to embed QGIS map canvas into your
application, so I guess you could skip the rest (e.g. QGIS
application, plugins, python support). How much time it would take
depends on your experience with build systems and porting to Symbian.
Of course you can always ask here on qgis-dev mailing list when trying
to sort out any compilation problems.

Probably you're running an older SVN trunk version. The third
parameter used to be a QString, now it's QIcon. Updating and
rebuilding QGIS should help.

Can you give a code sample of such search?
What is the average time it takes and what time do you need?

I believe any simpler searches could be implemented in c++ e.g. by
creating a new static method:
QList<QgsFeature>
QgsSearchString::findMatchingFeatures(QgsVectorLayer* layer, QString
searchString);

So, given a vector layer and a condition ("ROAD_TYPE = 3 OR ROAD_TYPE
= 5") it will return a list of features that match. Since the whole
search would be done within c++ code, that would avoid performance
penalty of python code with lots of iterations.

In case you need really fast searching, you could create an index -
especially if the queries are for the same field (or same set of
fields). Another choice would be to cache the whole features if there
aren't millions of them.

Hi to everyone.
I'm back on QGis, after an year, to compile it with VS Express 2008 on
Windows XP. I'm using the osgeo4w libs and devs files, plus Flex and
Bison from GNUWin32. CMake version 2.6.4
I've been able to generate the VS solution, and cmake seems being able
to find all the necessary, SIP and Python stuff included. Yet in VS
2008 I find 4 solutions related to python:

 - qgispython
     - qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp
     - qgispython.cpp
 - python_module_qgis_analysis
     - sipanalysisepart0.cpp
     - sipanalysispart1.cpp
     - sipanalysispart2.cpp
     - sipanalysispart3.cpp
 - python_module_qgis_core
     - sipcorepart0.cpp
     - sipcorepart1.cpp
     - sipcorepart2.cpp
     - sipcorepart3.cpp
 - python_module_qgis_gui
     - sipguipart0.cpp
     - sipguipart1.cpp
     - sipguipart2.cpp
     - sipguipart3.cpp


The sip*.cpp files are all empty, and (obviously) when I run qgis I
receive the error set at line 82 of qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp[1].
So, it's not clear to me where/when the empty source files are created
and why they've remained empty...
Any help?

Thanks very much,
giovanni

Looking better I suppose that "where" is the SIPMacros.cmake files.

Hey all,

I was wondering why do my panels and toolbars reset everytime I reopen
QGIS? Is it something I might've accidently set in the settings?

I'm using windows xp, qgis 1.50/r12859.

I forward to qgis devel and Marco Hugentobler.
I really cannot understand, Qgis uses gdal for writing and reading geotif files
as far as I know.
I think the point is that QGIS reports the origin in the NW corner and then uses
negative resolution for Y. But do not understand the discrepancy in
the absolute values
of the pixel size that you report.

I'm going to check if this is just for this plugin or for any raster
written by QGIS
as geotiff.

Message-ID: <25bc040b1002101135v55d710adpca5e5d66776c7000@mail.gmail.com>

I'm currently working on a geodatabase benchmark proposal (look for
"HSR Texas Database Benchmark") and consequently dealing with large
datasets.
When displaying these large datasets in QGIS I often get trapped in
thinking, the process would never end because there's "just" a wait
cursor.
As a feature request I would suggest that there could be a continuous
feature display (as in uDig :->) or at least a progress bar (if
datasource makes this info available).
Just my 5 cents. -Stefan

Hi Stefan,

Continuous feature drawing is already possible, but is disabled by
default, as in the overall, it slows down rendering.

If you want to enable it:

Settings --> Options --> Rendering & SVG --> Rendering behavior -->
"Number of Features to draw before updating the display" --> set it to > 0
(e.g. 10000).

Hi Martin

Since you asked, one suggestion for pythonisation(??)   It would be good to have an layers() iterator over map canvas layers something like

for l in iface.mapCanvas().layers():

Hi all

I hope this is a good news for developers using python. In svn trunk
(r12878) there are few additions that make QGIS API more pythonic.

QgsFeature allows direct access to attributes (get, set, delete attribute):
>>> f = QgsFeature()
>>> f[1] = QVariant("hello")
>>> print f[1].toString()
hello
>>> del f[1]
>>> print f.attributeMap()

QgsVectorLayer and QgsVectorDataProvider support iterating (available for those with sip >= 4.9).

layer.select([], QgsRectangle())
for f in layer:
  # do something with feature f

--- equals to ---

layer.select([], QgsRectangle())
f = QgsFeature()
while layer.nextFeature(f):
  # do something with feature f

That's it. The older idioms (using nextFeature) keep working too.

Inspired by a blog post from Sean Gillies:
http://sgillies.net/blog/952/iterators

Btw. fetching a list of values in an column gets this simple:
>>> lst = [ feat[1] for feat in layer ]
(just don't forget a select() call before iterating)

If you have any tips what other parts of QGIS API could be made more pythonic, let me know.

Hi

I have a scenario in a plugin where a change to a (python plugin) renderer on one layer may cause a change to other layers rendered with the same renderer.  Logically this should emit a signal (directly or indirectly) to request request the other layers to be refreshed.

I can sort of do this at the moment because layer change triggers a map refresh, and which in turn calls the startRender event in the renderer of the affected layers, which can then update themselves as necessary.  (Another probably better way to do it would be to raise a signal when the renderer changes which a handler uses to update all the affected layers.)

However I'm worried that this won't work if the render cache is in use.  I'm guessing this caches rendered layers and only refreshes the changed layers, rather than the entire map?

If so, then I need to be able to do signal to a layer that it needs refreshing.  At the moment I can only see how to refresh the entire map canvas.  Have I missed something in the API?

Thanks
Chris

Hi GDALTools devs and all interested,

I'm in need of a subsetting tool to work on images one-by-one, but
there it is a question how to implement it organizationally.

Right now, Clipper works with the rasters from the layers list and aims at
a) merging and b) clipping using user's extent. It would also be nice
we'd have an option to subset a single raster _while_ having multiple rasters
in layers list. I.e., I have 100 rasters of slightly different extents
loaded and I want to subset them all one by one.

Do you think we better create a new tool, like Subset or we can add a
new mode "Use a single raster" to Clipper?

Maxim

If you want clipping a single layer while you have to see
all layers on canvas, then IMHO is better adding the
feature to Clipper.

If the aim is clipping each layer using the same user's extent,
then I think also is better adding this feature to Clipper (it
could be as a batch mode).

Otherwise, I don't understand what is the problem.
Only active/visible raster layers are clipped, then you resolve
this by hiding all layers and showing only one.

Cheers.

Thanks Andreas - mea culpa - did'nt realize this. To me following
suggestion remains:

1. Why is'nt this Rendering Behavior ("Number of Features to draw
before updating the display") the default?

In addition, I recognized the following:

2. The Rendering behavior is void when option flag "Use display cache
if possible to speed up display" is on. I think, the options dialog
should reflect this relationship and disable "Rendering behavior".

3. When in main window and switching "Layer visibility" off, another
redraw is issued - only for making objects disappear right after
completing the drawing - and this (useless) redrawing might take a
long time.

Just my 5 cents. -Stefan

Hi Stefan,

I believe that the progressive rendering and the render cache don't work
well together. Tim could probably comment on that since he worked on the
rendering cache.

You are right that with the rendering cache set to off there are sometimes
"useless" redraws.

So somehow the combination of progressive rendering and rendering cache
would have to be fixed.

Andreas

Stefan,

your suggestions make sense. I would recommend you to file tickets for
them in Trac [1] otherwise the feature requests will be easily lost.

The first request for saving without exiting editing mode looks
simple. I'm not sure about the second one: the error reporting IMHO
varies among providers - some might be able to give a complete and
detailed list of errors, others might be less verbose.

Please could you provide more details about your setup? Are you trying
to use one renderer instance for more layers? Or do you need some
means of communication among renderers of various layers?

In any case you can set layer's cached image to None (NULL in C++) to
force the redraw.

QGIS libraries have also some dependencies: namely GEOS, GDAL, Proj,
Sqlite3 and Qt4. If you intend to distribute your application without
QGIS installation, make sure to include all the necessary DLLs in your
package. You can use dependency walker [1] tool to find out what DLL
files are missing.

Hi all,

the new georeferencer from gis-lab SVN is now commited
to qgis trunk (the upcoming qgis 1.5.0).

If you encounter any issues, bug reports and feedback are 
welcome (please report bugs and feature requests using trac 
at https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ )

Regards,

	Manuel

Manuel, thanks for committing georef to trunk! It is really exiting.

I have an important feature in mind, which we were not able to
implement, but we need for one of our projects.

It would be nice to have ability to set output pixel size after
transformation is selected (i.e. GCPs are collected) in the transformation settings.

Maxim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New symbology rendering loop question
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0648D9AD30@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm using the V2 symbology and finding that it doesn't allow me to break out of the rendering loop once it has started.  When I open a large layer (several million polygons), and they are all within the current extents, this means it can take a long time to render, and I cannot do anything about it till it finishes :-(

I see in the old symbology rendering loop (qgsvectorlayer.cpp, about 976) there is the following code

        if ( rendererContext.renderingStopped() )
        {
          break;
        }

#ifndef Q_WS_MAC //MH: disable this on Mac for now to avoid problems with resizing
        if ( mUpdateThreshold > 0 && 0 == featureCount % mUpdateThreshold )
        {
          emit screenUpdateRequested();
          emit drawingProgress( featureCount, totalFeatures );
          qApp->processEvents();
        }
        else if ( featureCount % 1000 == 0 )
        {
          emit drawingProgress( featureCount, totalFeatures );
          qApp->processEvents();
        }
#else
        Q_UNUSED( totalFeatures );
#endif //Q_WS_MAC

But looking in the new symbology rendering loop (about line 721), there is no equivalent code.

I'm just wondering if there is any reason why this was left out?  (And as an obvious corollary, could it be put in!)

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Vector Layer Symbology Registry
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0648D9AFE6@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I'm planning on creating a tool for the centralised storage and retrieval of QGIS vector layer styling. What I would like to do is whenever PostGIS/Shape file layers are loaded into any project, the associated QGIS styling information stored in a database is automatically set for that layer. This would be particularly useful for accessing consistent styling for data sources in multiple user environments.

My initial thought is to create a python plug-in that does two things:

1)     Stores QML styling information and a layer identifier into a database for any selected vector layer. This database could be a PostgreSQL instance or the QGIS Sqlite DB.
2)     On the load of a layer its identifier is matched in the database and will automatically have its styling set.

A small enhancement would be to apply a stored style to any given vector layer. I'm also planning on storing and retrieving styling information for v1 and v2 renderers.

At this point, I have three questions:

1)     What is the best layer identifier to use for storage in the database? I currently have a set PostGIS layers are not unique across the whole database (i.e. some tables with same name in difference schemas), so this could be an issue when using the layer name. I thought about using the datasource URI, but that does not look very useful for PostGIS layers as the table schema is only populated when not in the PostgreSQL user's schema search path.
2)     Is the best way to set the layer styling information on load by subscribing to the QgsMapLayerRegistry layerWasAdded signal? Does this event occur before the layer is first rendered?
3)     I guess I'm going to have issues with the QML styling XML changing between QGIS versions. What is the best way to deal with this?

Thanks
Jeremy

Manuel,

I'll probably will not see it until the next release of a binary,
do you have a web page where the new georeferencer is described?
Thanks

why? AFAIK, you can get fresh binaries for win and osx; compiling under
some flavours of linux is usually easy.

That woul be nice in fact.
All the best.

Hi,
I'm trying to use the "dissolve" operation (vector -> geoprocessing tools ->
dissolve) on different vectors (tested also the one in the qgis sample
dataset), but QGIS always crashes. Tested with both 1.4 and trunk under
Ubuntu 9.10.

Hi Chris,

that code is missing there just because I haven't put it there yet :-)
There's actually already a ticket #2409 that will be fixed by adding
this part of code to new symbology rendering. I'm nowadays quite busy
with other stuff, anyway if you have some c++ experience you can try
to fix that and provide the patch (e.g. attach it to the mentioned
ticket). If the patch is fine, it will be applied soon either by
myself or some other developer.

A good news is that you don't have to deal with the QML contents by
yourself - QgsMapLayer::loadNamedStyle() triggers all the hard work
for you.

I believe the layer should be identified by a triple (schema, table,
geometry_column) - as used by PostGIS in geometry_columns table.

Using that signal might work, though I'm not 100% sure.
I have another suggestion: during creation, every map layer first
tries to load it's default QML style (calling
QgsMapLayer::loadDefaultStyle). For layers in files it tries to use
the same file base name with .qml extension, if that fails, it tries
to load the style from sqlite database ~/.qgis/qgis.qmldb. So, what
you could do is to synchronize the local qgis.qmldb file from the
PostGIS database (e.g. on every load, once a day or only when it's
requested).


> 3)???? I guess I?m going to have issues with the QML styling XML changing

As stated above, you don't have to care about this. The styling is
done by QGIS code, you'll just call it.

Btw. I've just committed a small fix for python wrappers in r12949 to
make calling the styling functions better.

Hi to alls,

I've somes problems to make running my pyarchinit plugin under windows.

Pyarchinit use sqlalchemy and under mac os x and Linux, all run properly.

It's possible make using the python installed under windows and not the
embedded into Qgis, or put sqlalchemy as psycopg2 into the distribution?

Let me know! 8 )

Bye bye and thank you!

Great. I'm gathering that using the loadNamedStyle method is only applicable if I decide to sync the style information into the qgis.qmldb database.

Yes I agree, but what is the best way to determine the schema, table and geometry_column for a layer that is loaded in QGIS? The provider URI does not seem sufficient to me, given my previous comments about the schema search path.

The only problem I see with this approach is I'm only storing the schema, table, and geometry_column fields for PostGIS layers in the centralised style database. Looking at the qgis.qmldb tbl_styles table it stores the qml data by provider URI, which in the case of the PostgreSQL provider includes other such data such as the host, post, SSL etc. If I were to populate the local tbl_styles table I would need that information, and even then it would only be specific to that PostgreSQL host.

Hi,

I am able to build Qgis 1.3.0 with Visual Studio 2005 under windows 7
without any error,
but when i try to launch the executable i have the following error (in a
dialog box):

Runtime Error!

R6034
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library
incorrectly...etc

I have installed all the dependencies from the OSGeo4W installer.

Any ideas to solve it ?


Thanks

I don't want to ask the obvious, but is there a specific reason you are not trying to build the current release, 1.4.0?

odd, it works fine also under windows (osgeo4w) and under ubuntu 9.04
with qgis trunk compiled from source or qgis 1.4 installed with the
ubuntugis repositories. So until now I can only confirm the problem on
ubuntu 9.10 and qgis 1.4 installed with the ubuntugis packages.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS / OSGeo System Services
Message-ID: <4B7C090F.9020005@pobox.com>

Folks,

The OSGeo System Administration Committee (SAC) is working on migrating
some of our services to OSL, to a virtual machine based environment.

At this point it becomes practical to offer projects that need substantial
services beyond those normally provided by OSGeo/SAC with a virtual machine
they can manage themselves within their project - if there is a need.

My question is whether there is a need for this for the QGIS project.

Currently I am aware of QGIS hosting a joomla instance - currently on
osgeo2 which uses mysql.  Skimming the web site I also see a web site,
php forum, blog - are these part of joomla?  Hosted elsewhere?  Also,
I think there is some sort of plugin repository - how is this hosted?

Note that the "standard" OSGeo system services would continue to be
hosted and managed by SAC in other VMs/systems (Trac, SVN, download).

Does the QGIS project have additional custom system services hosted at
telascience or elsewhere that you would be interested in hosting in a
project managed VM?  Are there service you would like to deploy but have
held back for lack of somewhere stable and self-managed to put them?

Best regards,

Everything but the website and wiki are hosted by me on my server(s).
I am certainly amenable to moving some or all of that infrastructure
to a VM.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Openlayers plugin issue
Message-ID: <71D73B5E-68CE-47AE-B1E6-61E0C692F8E1@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was testing the new openlayers pre-release plugin. One issue I have is a scaling mismatch with my vector layers and the openlayers rendered output. I have a county layer in utm zone 11 (epsg 26911) that is not lining up with the openlayers map. I tried physical and roads layers from Google Maps. I did select the 100006 CRS and enabled OTF transformations for vector layers.

For testing purposes, the same vector layer can be downloaded from the link below. I happen to store my layer in a postgis database, but that should not matter.

http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/nv/gis/shp_files.Par.31109.File.dat/nv_county.zip

This is an exciting plugin addition that will be very useful. Thanks for the work and inclusion in a public repository. I don't know if the plugin will support rendering for map composer output, but a quick test did not render the openmap layer to either pdf or a png image output file. The openmap layer did render in the composer itself when I refreshed the cache.

Cheers,
John

I tested your vector data both as shapefile and from postgis and the borders 
lined up nicely with Google Maps on my QGIS build.

The custom SRS should have the following Proj4 config:
+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +units=m 
+no_defs

Usage note: The data is only aligned for integer values on the zoom level 
slider.

Could you send me a screenshot of your QGIS map?

The map composer is not supported at the moment. There are still a lot of open 
questions regarding fixed zoom levels combined with resolution scaling and user 
defined viewports.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis plugin and MySql support
Message-ID: <24313353.30961266505443286.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

 Hello everybody,
I'm trying to develop a plugin, written in C++ language, that, amongst other things, should connect with a Database to retrieve non-spatial data from it.
I'm using Qt libraries and the Database is MySql. The problem is that I get just 4 drivers types available:

 QPSQL7 (PostgreSQL Driver)
 QPSQL
 QODBC3 (ODBC Driver (includes Microsoft SQL Server))
 QODBC

It seems MySql driver is not available. 
Doing the same thing in a new Project outside Qgis context, I get this drivers available:
 
 QSQLITE
 QMYSQL3
 QMYSQL
 QODBC3
 QODBC
 QPSQL7
 QPSQL (MySql Driver)

Does it means that Qgis does'n support MySql Db? There are, between Qgis Api, other classes to manage Db connection and Sql Query?
I found QgsDataSourceURI but it seems works only with PostgreSql.

I get this crash on ubuntu 9.10 too (qgis trunk). From what I've found
out, the crash happens within the python bindings code generated by
SIP, so I believe this is a bug in SIP shipped in ubuntu 9.10 as other
systems doesn't seem to be affected.

You might try to upgrade SIP and PyQt4 (either by self-compiling them
or using ubuntu backports), then recompile QGIS to see whether it
helps.

This is the SRS setting I have been using.

I tried adjusting zoom levels to whole integers to no avail.

I've attached two screenshots (not on list) at different zoom levels. You can see the mismatch where the vector is larger than the actual county boundary, but scales differently at different zoom levels.

FWIW, I'm using qgis built from trunk. I also have qt-4.6.1 installed. This is an OS X platform as well.

Good to know. Thanks,

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0648DEAFFF@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi,

I've been setting up my QGIS build environment on WinXP using VS2008 Team Edition. I'm getting a couple of issues relating to the generation of VS projects for the python libraries which rely on SIP.

After I run the cmake setup in the qgis/build directory (cmake setup ..), the following dummy files get created:

qgis\build\python\core\sipcorepart0.cpp
qgis\build\python\core\sipcorepart1.cpp
qgis\build\python\core\sipcorepart2.cpp
qgis\build\python\core\sipcorepart3.cpp

qgis\build\python\analysis\sipanalysispart0.cpp
qgis\build\python\analysis\sipanalysispart1.cpp
qgis\build\python\analysis\sipanalysispart2.cpp
qgis\build\python\analysis\sipanalysispart3.cpp

qgis\build\python\gui\sipguipart0.cpp
qgis\build\python\gui\sipguipart1.cpp
qgis\build\python\gui\sipguipart2.cpp
qgis\build\python\gui\sipguipart3.cpp

Because these files get a file date newer that the source file dependencies listed in the project rule (sipxxx.cpp.rule), the proper files never get created using SIP the command. This problem can be overcome either by deleting the dummy files or rebuilding the project. But the cmake rules should probably be updated so the project works correctly by just using 'build'.

Another issue I'm getting is in the python_module_qgis_analysis project. The project includes a reference to 4 cpp files (sipanalysispart[0-3].cpp), but the sip command only generates 3 files (sipanalysispart[0-2].cpp). Because 1 file is missing at the end of SIP processing, Visual Studio throws a project build error. The SIP command generated by cmake for generating the cpp files is:

C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\sip -x VendorID -t WS_WIN -x PyQt_OpenSSL -x PyQt_NoPrintRangeBug -t Qt_4_5_0 -x Py_v3 -g -j 4 -c C:/Dev/qgis/build/python/analysis -I C:/OSGeo4W/apps/Python25/sip/PyQt4 -I C:/Dev/qgis/python C:/Dev/qgis/python/analysis/analysis.sip

In my environment I'm using:

Visual Studio Team System 2008 SP1 (v9.0.30729)
cmake 2.8.0
Latest OGeo4W dependencies
WinXP SP2

Thanks
Jeremy

Message-ID: <1fef7d9b1002190217q6e891a9dw7a66b88cc7c2025c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a large shapefile of contours and wish to clip them to my area
of interest, but both Clip and Intersect do not write a file. I use
EPSG:4326 for all layers and my clip layer is a simple rectangular
polygon. I have performed a successful clip before using these layers
and so I don't think there is a problem with the data. I also have
write permissions in my home directory.

Software versions:
fTools tried 0.5.10 and 0.5.9
QGIS r12821 (self compiled)
Python 2.6.2
Ubuntu 9.04

Any ideas on what has broken? Ps I have upgraded QGIS, SIP and PyQt
since my last successful encounter with these tools.

Regards,

Craig

Michele,

a) See the signals in Mapcanvas API

layersChanged ()


b) May be you need the theses SIGNALS:
layerWillBeRemoved(QString)
layerWasAdded(QgsMapLayer *)
See in http://doc.qgis.org/head/classQgsMapLayerRegistry.html


Example in tools (plugin downloads):
a) C:\Documents and

self.connect(self.canvas, SIGNAL("layersChanged()"), 
self.fillInputLayerCombo)


b) C:\Documents and

QtCore.QObject.connect(core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance(),

If I select a contour and try to save the selection I receive an
error: "Creation of an attribute failed". All attributes seem to
display properly in the table. I then delete all columns except the
heights and now clipping works. I was able to sub-sample the original
shapefile using ogr2ogr without problems, so I wonder why QGIS
stumbles with the data?

Can anyone confirm that SpatiaLite works with QGIS trunk? I'm unable
to open a database (previous or newly created). A newly created
database returns an error that "not a SpatiaLite one". A previous
database I had opens and shows a layer list but I can't load anything.

Is there a version mismatch between SpatiaLite in the QGIS source tree?

Hi Martin
thanks for the feedback. I'll not be able to try upgrade SIP and PyQT4
in the next few days. Maybe the ubuntugis guys are available to backport
these packages into the ubuntugis ppa karmic repository?

thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin installer causes crash (ubuntu 9.04)
Message-ID: <1266776381.6420.30.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I stumbled in a Ubuntu 9.04 machine (a almost fresh install) that had
qgis 1.0.x installed with the "old" official repository. I made an
upgrade to qgis 1.4 using the ubuntugis-unstable ppa repository and went
all fine, except for the fact that when clicking on the plugin installer
qgis crashes. I removed everything, tried install everything again but
the result is the same. The terminal shows the following message

Python support ENABLED :-) 
Loaded : fTools (package: fTools)
Loaded : Plugin Installer (package: plugin_installer)
Warning: QObject::connect: Incompatible sender/receiver arguments
        QgsProject::writeProject(QDomDocument&) -->
QgisApp::projectChanged(QDomDocument)
Segmentation fault


any idea?

Thanks in advance

Strange thing. Just for clearness: the plugin installer has nothing to do with 
the project xml.

I saw the same message when launching qgis 1.4 from terminal in my
ubuntu 9.10 installation, so it probably have nothing to do with this
crash.

Hi all,

I believe I found a very annoying bug in qgis 1.4/trunk, see

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2457

it is replicable using the data in the qgis sample dataset plus a small
shapefile I attached to the ticket. I suggest also to include this
shapefile (is also of the Alaska region) to the qgis sample dataset to
give the users something to try reprojection.

My problem is to catch the signal when the user change the selection 
of a layer in the legend.
The signal you suggest are only for adding/removing layer.

At moment i'm using the Kore version (1.0.2) of QGis.

Michele,

The legend in QGIS will  change for make the QgsLegendInterface.
In the moment, we can't catch signal easily.
See this thread, where i needed work with legend:

Hi all,

I am able to build QGIS 1.3.0 in windows7 using VS2005.

Using exactly the same settings and configuration
if I try to build Qgis 1.4.0 Cmake give me the following error when tries to
generate the Solution:

CMake Error at cmake/FindSIP.cmake:52 (MESSAGE):
  Could not find SIP
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:351 (FIND_PACKAGE)


Any suggestion ?

All the best,
Luca

Hi John

Thank you for the screenshots.

I tested the OpenLayers plugin on Windows and there is the same scaling 
mismatch. I supppose this is due to different screen dpi settings on Linux, OS 
X and Windows, so this should be taken into account when calculating the 
scales for the zoom levels. At the moment, the scale factor is adjusted to 90 
dpi on Linux.

Best regards
Mathias Walker

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new georeferencer with custom projection
Message-ID: <4B83AB3F.7050605@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I tested the new georeferencer, much improved - thanks a lot!
We spotted a problem though: if we select a custom projection as a target SRS, the
georef does not take it into account, thus leaving EPSG:0
Looks an easy fix, and it seems important for many users.
All the best.

Thanks for reporting, the bug is recorded as ticket #2464. I'll be working on
this and a few other outstanding georef issues in the next days.

Very nice plugin, thanks. A couple of things:
- it would be nice if the user could know when the tiles are being loaded, with a
progress bar or at least a moving cursor
- the overview map does not take into account correctly the map canvas extent
All the best, and many thanks.

One more thing: when zooming in, I get a blank canvas, but as soon as I pan, I get
the correct image.
Hope this helps improving it.

Arpita,

Sorry for the response sent previously.

I comment about source Identify, but this tools is made specific for the 
pluggin (Image catalog from INPE - View and order to download), this not 
went projected to work alone.

The idea is to read the source, and make adjustments for yours usage.


Sorry for the inconvenience.

Luiz

What is the epsg id of this srs? I'd like to include it to srs.db to have it 
available by default.

Very nice plugin!

OpenLayers calls the Spherical Mercator projection EPSG:900913. It should be 
equivalent to the deprecated EPSG:3785 (http://www.epsg-
registry.org/export.htm?gml=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3785) which became EPSG:3875 
(http://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?gml=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3857), but 
in fact they are not exactly the same.


OpenLayers EPSG:900913 (http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/SphericalMercator):
+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 
+units=m +nadgrids=@null +no_defs

When setting up a QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem with this definition it returns 
the following Proj4 definition (which is used by the plugin):
+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +units=m 
+no_defs


EPSG:3785 is already available in QGIS as:
+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 
+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs

When using EPSG:3785 as project SRS there is a huge offset to the south of the 
reprojected data relative to the Google map.
It is confusing why EPSG:900913 and EPSG:3785 are not the same, although it is 
very often claimed they are identical.


To include it in the srs.db, it's probably best to use the inofficial EPSG id 
900913 for the Spherical Mercator projection. This would be at least 
consistent with the OpenLayers definition.

Mathias Walker

Hi, everybody

I've got a problem debugging QGis Python Plugins with Eclipse+Pydev. I wrote
a previous post about that, but with a different software configuration.
First of all, I will describe the new software that I've installed in my XP
machine:

1. OSGeo4W. I selected to install only the following packages:
- Desktop: qgis-unstable (because of this selection many other packages are
selected to be installed apart from qgis-unstable)
- Libs: libs selected by qgis-unstable + gdal16-ecw + gdal16-mrsid +
gdal16-python + libtiff-bin + owslib + pdflib + shapelib + qt4-devel
- Commandline_Utilities: gpsbabel + setup + shell

2. Eclipse Classic 3.5.1
3. Pydev 1.5.4

After that, I've configured PyDev in Eclipse (Window > Preferences > Pydev >
Interpreter-Python) with the python interpreter from OSGeo4W
(C\OSGeo4W\bin\python.exe) and the following environment:

a. PYTHONPATH:
	C:\OSGeo4W\bin
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\DLLs
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\Lib
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\Lib\site-packages
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\sip
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable\python
	C:\eclipse\dropins\plugins\org.python.pydev.debug_1.5.4.2010011921\pysrc

b. Forced Builtins:
	PyQt4
	qgis

c. Environment variables:

- PATH:
	C:\OSGeo4W\bin;
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable\bin;
	%PATH%

- PYTHONHOME:
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25

- QT_PLUGIN_PATH:
	C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qt4\plugins

Once again, I tested the fTools Plugin as en example to debug. Also, in the
properties of the project, in PyDev-PYTHONPATH, I've added fTools and
fTools/tools folders as Source Folders.

The problem now is that every class, method,... related to PyQt4.QtCore are
not recognized. For other libraries, like PyQt4.QtGui, qgis.core,...,
everything is well recognized. One symptom is that, in Eclipse, for the
lines: "from PyQt4.QtCore import *" there is no "Unused in wild import"
warning, while it is present in every similar imports ("from <library>
import *").

Nevertheless, everything works fine when I try to debug with the
instructions given in Mauricio de Paulo's blog
(http://mauriciodepaulo.blogspot.com/2009/12/pydev-e-qgis.html).

More information: if I execute a Python shell (C\OSGeo4W\bin\python.exe)
with the same environment variables defined previously, there is no problem
with PyQt4.QtCore, every class or variables are well recognized.

So, finally, I can debug, but for PyQt4.QtCore I can?t check the code and I
don't have code completion.

May be I forgot some folder in the PATH variable or a Pydev bug?

If somebody can help me, I'd be very grateful. Regards.
      Santiago.

Mathias and Marco,

This is fantastic, great summary of the issue and thanks for adding  
the projection. This has been on my mind too, in the sense that 3875  
will not work due to the exact problems Mathias identifies and it  
would be great if datasources opening in QGIS in 900913 could be auto- 
recognized.

One additional thought: I tend to always add a +over to my 900913 proj  
string, which was recently highlighted by Frank:

http://fwarmerdam.blogspot.com/2010/02/world-mapping.html

Does the QGIS machinery of idenfying srs "matches" and whether to  
transform coordinates ever need to operate on the exact proj4 literal,  
or should I not worry that subtle differences like this would matter  
to QGIS? Here I'm thinking about tables in postgis that might be  
registered in 900913 but use this slightly different proj4 literal, or  
in the case where I (via a plugin) have assigned that proj4 literal to  
the map Canvas.

Dane

Hi Maxim.
Where do I find some documentation for the plugin?
Would you agree with Tim's suggestion of integrating it into the Raster (AKA
GdalTools) menu?
All the best.

Hi,

the small doc for RasterCalc is here:
http://gis-lab.info/qa/rastercalc-eng.html

In general I'm ok with integrating, but I suggest we will wait with it
for a couple of months. RasterCalc is tied in organizationally in a
project that we are working on right now (where it is supposed to be a separate extention).

Hope this is not a big complication.

Maxim

Thanks for your reply. I do not understand the syntax: why is
[sfumo100m]@1*[toscana100k]@1
wrong (In expression must be layers from one group)?
All the best.

yes, layers should be from one group. Groups denote differing extents
or resolutions.

Currently, RasterCalc works only with completely (extent, resolution)
matching rasters.

To make life easier in this regard, we've added "use intersected extent" in Merge tool of
GDALTools. Using this mode, you can quickly create a layerstacked
raster where layers are matched the way for RasterCalc to recognize
easily.

Hope this helps.

Hi all,

here is a new small python plugin Photo2Shape. The plugin ?reate a point
shapefile from a set of geotagged images.
It is based on Tim's ImagesToShape plugin but don't have such dependencies
as exiv2 and pyexiv2 and available for Windows and Linux. You can get it
through our repo (GIS-Lab, http://gis-lab.info/programs/qgis/qgis-repo.xml)

Don't forget to turn on experimental plugins in your plugin installer.
Have fun.

Nice tool - thank you and Tim.
I have tested it on 3 images and in result I always get only two 
locations. First image gets coordinates from second one - they overlap.

Good idea. Could Spatialite layers be included as well?

I think I got it: when in the bunch of georef photos one or more are not geotagged,
the error occurs. One extra problem: once I get the error, the cursor start rotating,
and it does not stop until I restart qgis.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin installer & repos down
Message-ID: <1267104414.6461.17.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I noticed the following:

if I open qgis (configured to check for plugins updates every time it
starts) and a repository is down, the message "looking for new
plugings..." remains in the lower bar as long as it tries to contact the
repository. Then if I close qgis the following python error shows

--------------------
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/plugin_installer/installer_data.py",
line 171, in stateChanged
    self.emit(SIGNAL("anythingChanged(QString, int, int)"), self.key,
state, 0)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
-------------------

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python QgsVectorLayer question
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0648B0A491@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm working on a plugin which creates vector layers

   layer = QgsVectorLayer(...)

These are based upon information in other layers, so I want to set the same crs as the source layer.  This seems easy enough

   layer.setCrs(sourceLayer.crs(),False)

However the problem I have is that if the Qgis settings for new layers is to prompt for the CRS (Settings|Options|CRS|Prompt for CRS), then the CRS selection dialog appears as soon as the new layer is created.  Obviously I don't want this, since I'm going to reset the CRS regardless of what the user chooses.

Is there a good way to avoid this.  At the moment I'm using a rather kludgy approach,  

        settings = QSettings()
        prjSetting = settings.value("/Projections/defaultBehaviour").toString()
        try:
           settings.setValue("/Projections/defaultBehaviour","")
          ... do my stuff ...
        finally:
           if prjSetting:
               settings.setValue("/Projections/defaultBehaviour",prjSetting)

But this doesn't seem ideal..

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Fedroa 12 and new version of qt
Message-ID: <4B87B92E.9020908@arava.co.il>

After a routine yum update on Fedora 12 I got these new versions of qt, etc:

PyQt4-4.7-1.fc12.i686
PyQt4-devel-4.7-1.fc12.i686
qt-4.6.2-1.fc12.i686
qt-devel-4.6.2-1.fc12.i686
qt-sqlite-4.6.2-1.fc12.i686
qt-x11-4.6.2-1.fc12.i686
sip-4.10-1.fc12.i686
sip-devel-4.10-1.fc12.i686


And Now qgis segfaults. This is a self compiled 1.4.0 installation. When 
I try to recompile the error is:


   [  7%] Building CXX object 
src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/moc_qgsapplication.cxx.o

How can I recompile with these newer qt libs? Should I grab a newer qgis?

Thanks

Did you try that from a fresh build directory?   Looks like you didn't - or you
are still using an the 4.5.3 moc, but new 4.6.2 libraries (check with moc -v).

Yes, you're right. I now tried a fresh directory and I get:

The sip.h is indeed in /usr/include/python2.6
What am I missing for getting python included?

Perfect! That was it.
So I guess the version check was only for the first digit, i.e. 4.10 was 
seen as 4.1 ??

Hi developers:

I have an idea that I want ask you if it could be of interest for google summer of code 2010.

The idea is the following:

A raster translator gui based on gdal to translate between raster formats, with support for custom options per format.
Ability to transform just one file or many of them at once.
Some core classes to support exporting current view of raster in a qgis project  to any gdal supported format.

If you think is a good idea, I'll be glad to work as a mentor in this project.

Regards
Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] set plugin enabled by default
Message-ID: <4B881765.3070809@web.de>

Hi there,
does someone knows if there is a way to set a plugin enabled by default.
My trouble is: when the Plugin gets installed it should be visible to 
the user after startup of Qgis. The user should not be forced to open 
the plugs menu and search for the plugin and activate it.
Is there any way to perform this, probably by modifying the default 
plugins (ftools or plugin_installer). It must work for standard Qgis 
installations, without changing the source code (modifying the python 
code is also not what I really need, but could be a workaround).
Maybe there is a possibility to get the installed plugins and activate 
the one needed?

I have mentored projects in the past and Anne G. has volunteered to do
so this year as well. We need to get the GSOC ideas page on the wiki up
and start adding ideas to it.

 Is there any interest in having a go at integrating the Sextante
toolkit? There's a thread on the mailing list from 2008 that died out
once it was pointed out that it was written in Java and obviously Qgis
aint got no Java devs.

 But I had a play with it last year and it has a standalone toolbox
system that just reads/writes gdal data sets, so a thin python wrapper
might work. It would give Qgis access to a huge number of algorithms
without having to worry about Grass and mapsets and all that:

http://forge.osor.eu/plugins/wiki/index.php?The%20algorithms&id=13&type=g

 The biggest hurdle I had was getting the toolbox to work at all. But
someone with java skills and plenty of time could probably do it.
Might be a GSoC project. I could mentor the python side (and probably
learn the java side)...

sextante seems a wrapper aorung saga gis, so we might ahev better chances using saga
directly:
http://www.saga-gis.org/
BTW, saga is in C++, and is being debianized these days.
Also, more work on GdalTools plugin would be good.

Hi all.

I just read a ticket about "Select by location", number 2476.

We are finalizing the Spatial Query Plugin, it is C++ plugin for make 
the selected features by topological relations.

At the moment, we are make procedure on source code to be evaluate by you..

I found pertinet anticipate the release of the Plugin.

If anyone wants to try, can download in

http://www.sendspace.com/file/gkmrkg  - Name: spatialqueryplugin.zip 
The file is a DLL (Windows plugins), for users of other systems can watch the video:

Message-ID: <4B88CC16.9020303@ioda-net.ch>

Hi All.

I would like to get feedback about something I found strange.
When I run a qgis project in SRS using meters as base unit, and use the measure tool ( distance, surface etc...)
I get the right number but units are always in degree.

Having a rectangle surface saying : 120.20 degree^2 hurts me a bit...

Is this a bug ? And I should fill a new one ?

Hi,

only have a qgis 1.4 open, but you probably have to define the layer units
and measurement units here:

a) settings => project properties => general => layer units
b) settings => options => map tools => measure tools

Regards,
 Otto

Hi all,

I wanted to check in with the dev community to see where a few key areas of development are, and if there is a need for outside support through a GSoC project or not.

Composer: Marco, I know you have pretty much owned this portion of the qgis project and you do a great job. Would it be useful for someone to assist on some composer advances or not? I'm sure you could generate some project ideas pretty quickly if it would be worth pursuing.

Labels and Symbols: Martin, you have similarly been point on this portion of the codebase and also do an excellent job. Again, perhaps a GSoC project would be good, especially for getting the composer and new symbology in sync (i.e., new symbology in composer legend).

I am sure others may have similar questions or requests based on additional desires for qgis development and advances.

Regards,
John

Yes, we will go send source to QGIS project.

At the moment, we are make procedure on source code to be evaluate  for

After making the change Jurgen suggested I was able to compile qgis on 
Fedora 12, but I'm still getting a segfault. I re-compiled with 
debugging enabled, i.e.:
cmake -L -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

Then, after installing, I tried to run qgis under gdb. Here's the result:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interest announcement for QGIS meeting
Message-ID: <ceb0de271002281014m18350f1dt2f7b79c0841ee078@mail.gmail.com>

[Forgive the cross-posting]

As you may know, the QGIS project has had several developer meetings
thus far, with one coming up in March[1].

The purpose of this email is to gauge interest in a meeting of
developers (Python and C++), users, and all other interested parties
to take place in June or July. In order to facilitate organization and
planning, I would like to hold the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska.

Agenda items for the meeting might include:
 * Presentation of projects using or leveraging QGIS
 * New things you are working on
 * Roadmap discussion for version 1.9/2.0
 * Hacking on core or plugins
 * Training

The meeting would be held for two or three days mid-week.

I realize that Alaska is far away for most/many of you, however unique
opportunities are available to combine the meeting with some excellent
tourist activities.

If you are interested in such a meeting please let me know (privately
or to the list). If sufficient interest is expressed we will look into
finding sponsors and begin working on details for a time and venue.

Thanks,

-gary

Hi,

as far as I can see since qgis 1.4 python plugins are immediately
activated after installation.

BTW: the post-installation message should be modified then

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom composer items?
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0648ECFCA2@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm wanting to add scale information for symbols to composer.  These are arrow symbols representing vector fields, so I want to be able to show in the composer generated page what the scale of the arrows is (ie how long an arrow represents a 5cm offset at a point, or whatever).

Logically this would be a custom composer item, but I cannot see any way to create a custom item, either in C++ or in Python (my preference!), without modifying the base composer classe(s).  Can anyone confirm this?

A slightly less desirable approach would be to draw the scale information onto the map item in composer.  This would constrain the placement - it would be nicer to be able to place it arbitrarily as other widget items.

In the main Qgis window I draw this scale information onto the map canvas in response to the renderComplete signal, in the same way as the scale bar or north arrow, but I don't think there is an equivalent event when the composer map item is drawn?  So I can't use that approach to draw onto the canvas...

I think I may be able to draw the scale information by adding a custom map layer.

Can anyone suggest better approaches, or point me to something obvious I've missed?

Many thanks

Chris

Isn't it modified in your installation? The installer 1.0.8 should just confirm 
succesfull installation. If you have an older version, Qgis 1.4 should warn 
about an obsolete installer.
