Hi devs and PSC,

I just got this mail from our macedonian translator.
If anyone wants to step into macedonia this would be the right time to
make the officials there aware of the existence of QGIS.

Probably any of the supporting companies will step in here an make an
offer to macedonia?

Just for your information!

regards
Werner

 Hello

 I am writing you, this time for something that is not connected with
translation but somehow it may be  connected with  QGIS.
 Here in Macedonia, I am working as a surveyor in private company but, i
have contacts in the Agency for real estate cadastre and i heard that
Agency is searching for new GIS software. They already have one small
software but it's terrible, and it bring them a lot of problems and
because of that they are now searching for new GIS software which will
be used as official not just of that agency but of all contributors
whose are working with agency on some way including the big number of
geodetic companies.
The number of people who will use it, is nearly 4000 for now.
It can be opportunity to increase popularity of Qgis in the Balkan also
because, soon cadastre agencies of few countries are starting new
project together and may be it will  Impose to the people who will work
on that project.
 However, there is a lot of things connected with this, but i don't know
if  it's interesting for you as organisation.
 If it is somehow interesting for you, please notify me and i will write
you more informations and some small conditions that should be met.
 Also, if there is someone who is appointed for this area , i would
contact him and tell everything about this.

Kind regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to write tests for Processing scripts?
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgOUGCyKxsodT9QqPffy8ufNrC+7UfVspgAfyD8-Dnafg@mail.gmail.com>

?Hi,

I'm trying to write tests for Processing scripts but  I'm stuck because
runalg() throws "Error: Algorithm not found".  Alglist() also seems unable
to find algorithms from my user script while it manages to find SAGA, GRASS
and co.

Am I missing something or is this a bug?

Code so far is:


import os, sys, glob
import unittest
import numpy as np

# Prepare the environment
from qgis.core import * # qgis.core must be imported before PyQt4.QtGui!!!
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
app = QApplication([])
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("C:\\OSGeo4W64\\apps\\qgis",True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()

# Prepare processing framework
sys.path.append( "C:\\OSGeo4W64\\apps\\qgis\\python\\plugins" )
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
from processing import runalg, alglist

class TestMorans(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_morans(self):
        Processing.initialize()
        np.random.seed(12345)
        alglist('moran')
        result =
runalg("script:morans","C:/Users/anita_000/Documents/GitHub/QGIS-Processing-tools/test/data/stl_hom.shp","HR8893","rook")
        i = result['i']
        self.assertEqual(i,0.24365582621771659)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I still have not found the solution ...

Do you think it's a bug QGIS or a mistake in my code?

Thank you again

Message-ID: <CALuHMPBoDnGgOBqRbUm=ZaVwW_uqnN8_jb5ujboou6aovrBZ8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

just found that identify tool reports wrong feature IDs for WFS layers.
For example, if I look in raw server response feature has id = 4, but
QGIS identify tool for the same feature show another id = 1.

After looking in sources I found that WFS provider (maybe others too?)
maintains mapping between "real" IDs and "internal" IDs, so identify tool
show "internal" ID, while in all edit operations used "real" ID.

Are there any reasons to not report "real" feature ID?

copy-paste, as you noted, is fragile, and I would not particularly encourage its use. Save as... however should work.

AFAIK it's a GDAL issue - perhaps you could check if ogr2ogr works for you, and open the ticket where appropriate? (gdal or qgis)

This is a long standing problem. I'm gradually trying to convince new plugin authors to add a code repo and a bugtracker; for older plugins, we have to ask. Perhaps a direct email to the author could help.

All the best, and thanks for raising the issue.

Hi.
I am using:
                 - Ubuntu 12.04
                 - Qgis 2.6.1
                 - Windows Server 2008 with SQL Server 2008

Now I am trying to use SQL Server from Ubuntu with qgis.
I install freetds and unixodbc and I can connect to the SQL Server and
I can list tables, but when I try to add layer from SQL Server, QGIS
get a crash.
It's say:
** glibc detected *** /usr/bin/qgis.bin: malloc(): memory corruption:

This is my connections parameter:

I think the last word in this case is with J?rgen as Release manager.
If he considers the changes as reliable and stable enough..

Imho, it would be best if J?rgen could make a statement on whether this
exemption will be provided.

Message-ID: <CAHCoeJZ9baQSvWVxZVdtDHK3UoV9cqbF83WXpbJfe3Y4F=p88g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello;

I am trying to develop an application using QGis API. First I tried to
create a raster layer and add a raster image on it. However "isValid"
function of QgsRasterLayer always returned false.
Then I tried to use "isValidRasterName" static method in various ways but
it always returned false either.
After that I pasted the code of isValidRasterName function from QGIS source
code.

    isvalidrasterfilename_t *pValid = ( isvalidrasterfilename_t * )
cast_to_fptr( QgsProviderRegistry::instance()->function( "gdal",
 "isValidRasterFileName" ) );


The pvalid fuction pointer is null. It seems it cannot resolve gdal. But I
installed gdal and libgdal1-dev

QGIS application itself works just fine.

Can anyone show me a way to handle this problem?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] dbManager: Store queries in QGIS profile?
Message-ID: <503d9da36aa74e0799cd2720ae129a18@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Dear devs,

QGIS is an excellent frontend to PostGIS with lots of functionality.
One thing I was wondering is, why does dbManager store queries in the project file and not in e.g. the QGIS user profile (.qgis2) or the registry? Is that on purpose?

I was planning to deploy some default queries which might be used in several different projects or by different people via a batch file I already use for import of QGIS settings on new installations (along with PostGIS connections and so on).

I see that I can add my queries to project templates, but that would mean I have to maintain them at (at least) at three different places (in each project). For me it would be more convenient to have them separated from the projects. Could that be an option for the future? BTW. The Combo-box could be a bit longer, so that names for the queries are more readable...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi !

Technically it's easy to store the queries globally (I did the
implementation of the store queries feature some time ago, and guess it is
around 1 hour work)

But I think we have to leave the possibility to store them in the project
file as well, as some queries are really project-specific (actually all of
them in my use cases).
Probably the best would be to allow both. There would be two store buttons,
and the two categories could be listed in the same drop down box with a
line separator.

Bests,

Olivier

Let's just do that.

I added a 2.8.0 version, please add items to it.

The normal 'plan' is to do it there, and after release I download it as
rst an put it in the website so it will be possible to translate it.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Oliver and Paolo,

Thanks for your feedback.
I see your point of project specific queries. That is probably the most common situation.
The use cases I had in mind were, that

a)      some queries go (with minor modifications) through several projects (like e.g. point-sampling layers with environmental information or overlay statistics with land cover data and so on), and

b)      such frequently used types of queries could also be useful to be shared among users of one institution.
For such queries e.g. the QGIS profile could be a nice place to store them. However the parallel solution (project and probably QGIS profile in future) you sketched, Oliver, sounds perfect. That way modifications of ?template queries? for a specific project can be stored separately?

I shall open a ticket for that asap (at the moment redmine says it is under heavy load and I should try again later?).

Cheers
Stefan

Technically it's easy to store the queries globally (I did the implementation of the store queries feature some time ago, and guess it is around 1 hour work)

But I think we have to leave the possibility to store them in the project file as well, as some queries are really project-specific (actually all of them in my use cases).
Probably the best would be to allow both. There would be two store buttons, and the two categories could be listed in the same drop down box with a line separator.

Dear devs,

QGIS is an excellent frontend to PostGIS with lots of functionality.
One thing I was wondering is, why does dbManager store queries in the project file and not in e.g. the QGIS user profile (.qgis2) or the registry? Is that on purpose?

I was planning to deploy some default queries which might be used in several different projects or by different people via a batch file I already use for import of QGIS settings on new installations (along with PostGIS connections and so on).

I see that I can add my queries to project templates, but that would mean I have to maintain them at (at least) at three different places (in each project). For me it would be more convenient to have them separated from the projects. Could that be an option for the future? BTW. The Combo-box could be a bit longer, so that names for the queries are more readable?

Cheers
Stefan

Solved it.
It seems we have to initialize QgsProviderRegistry with valid plugin
directory path.

    QString myPluginsDir        = "/usr/lib/qgis/plugins";
    QgsProviderRegistry::instance(myPluginsDir);

Still can't see the raster but at least I passed the "isValid" problem.

Hi,

Many of the QGIS users or developers support the QGIS project 
financially. We are very grateful for your sponsorings and donations.

To make the governance of the QGIS project more transparent we would 
like to share our financial report with you - to show you how we spend 
your donations and sponsoring money: 
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/finance/index.html

Note, that I took over responsibility of the finances starting on July 
1, 2014 - so the report only contains half a year. The 2015 report will 
be the first report covering a full year.

Thank you again for supporting our project financially,

Andreas Neumann

Hi,

we are currently trying to write a raster data plugin using the GDALibrary to display rendered image data from our mapping application inside QGIS.
We successfully loaded our data as a rasterlayer in QGIS, but could not find a way to display overviews, i.e. lower resolution/downscaled images yet.

GDAL provides an (terribly documented) overview API that we thought to have implemented correctly by now, but we have not found out yet how and when QGIS makes use of this functionality.
Has anyone experience with GDAL Raster drivers and QGIS and may point us in the right direction?

Thank you!

A question raised on IRC:

But if you run the code in a terminal, it segfaults?!

Anybody a clue?
Trying to attach gdb to the so libs, but failing.

It segfaults at the getFeatures() call, as if something wrong with the
iterator..

Looks like QApplication instance was not created, so all places where
events are needed will fail (e.g. for postgres there is a connection pool
which releases connections after some time). Something like this should be
added to the top:

import sys
app = QApplication(sys.argv)

Also, at the end of a script it is wise to call QgsApplication.exitQgis()
to clean up qgis libraries properly (to avoid crashes on exit). There is a
small help for pythonistas from Nathan - a context manager that hides these
pieces of code. It can be seen in Tim's post:

Hi Martin,

Thanks for your answer.

the actual script I was testing was this one (which has this stuff):

http://pastebin.com/MWdMzmTW

I now managed to create a stacktrace myself via

gdb --args /usr/bin/python test2.py

you can see the full output here (on the bottom the bt)

In that script I still can't see creation of QApplication that I mentioned
above. Please note that there are two different things here:
- QApplication - object that initializes Qt library
- QgsApplication - has static methods to initialize qgis libraries

Ah, thanks! That did the trick.

We have to find a place in the pycookbook to put up this kind of details...

Hi,
I am trying to install QGIS Server on UBUNTU from UBUNTU-GIS unstable repository.
On:
sudo apt-get install qgis-mapserver
I get the following error message:
"The following packages have unmet dependencies:
qgis-mapserver : Depends: qgis-providers (= 2.4.0-0trusty3) but 2.6.1-1trusty1 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages."

Adding the QGIS repository (http://qgis.org/debian) does not help...

Any ideas how to fix it?

Thanks for helping,

The package is called qgis-server.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Poor performance with large projects
Message-ID: <CAFAMN=PhzbonMYjwR4wMXND8RH+36SJrH2eUBWmfsDPPLhqwqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I have been suffering from *very* poor performance on a number of projects,
which only seems to become noticeable on large, complex projects. I have
filed a bug with regards to this, see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12125.
Giovanni suggested I cross-post on the developer and user lists to see if
others are experiencing the problem/have any ideas on what's going on.

The issue I am experiencing manifests in two ways:
a) Very slow project loading times (>30mins at times). Someone on the bug
tracker suggested that this may in part be related to the retrieval of
extent and geometry from postgis layers. I've had a look at the debugging
logs (from the master build) and this seems to be the case, for what I
estimate as about half the loading time.
b) Very slow addition and removal of layers after the first save event.
>From a quick look at the debug output, it seems that after the first save,
the entire project is being reloaded on each layer addition/removal, which
takes a very long time. Before the first save event, performance is very
good, addition and removal of layers is virtually instantaneous.

Obviously long project times are annoying but manageable, so long as I only
have to load the project infrequently. The second issue, however, makes
Qgis pretty much unworkable and leads to very long times between saves (and
the inevitable quit & reload to restore performance) which is poor practice.

To give you an idea of the difference between pre and post-save behaviour,
Qgis emits about 850 lines of debugging output pre-save, rising to over
430,000 lines post-save when adding a layer to one of my projects.

Am happy to share debugging output with a developer off-list if that would
help nail down what is happening and could lead to a fix.

Cheers;
Sam Ingarfield.

Hi all,
I'm not able to compile QGIS. It seems related with QWTPOLAR_INCLUDE_DIR.
This is the error when configuring with ccmake:

 CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they
are set to NOTFOUND.
 Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the

I tried also to set them as "OFF" but then I got an error with make:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange behaviour in feature ids when editing
	PostGIS layer
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yyGUmjBz-7vUp5V1=A+dMETMcwBy+ZWYEWpqq5oXT1pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am seeing a behaviour that surprised me when editing a PostGIS
layer. HEre's a detailed explanation

Let's say I have a layer with 3 features with ids 1,2 and 3. In a
layer such as a shapefile, if you move the feature with the id 1, the
geometryChanged signal is fired, with the feature id and the new
geometry as parameters. When the editingStopped signal is emitted
after editing is finished, you can query the layer to get the feature
with that id 1, and it will be there, with the modified geometry.

In the case of a PostGIS layer, when the editingStopped signal is
emitted, the query will return no features. The feature with id 1 is
no longer there, and instead there will be a feature with id equal to
4. So basically it seems that a modification of a feature is really a
removal and then an addition, and the added feature has a different id
than the removed one,

I am sure there must be an explanation for that, based on how PostGIS
works, or how the corresponding provider handles the transactions and
the id, but this seems to me rather confusing.

In this situation (and in case this is not a bug that can't be fixed),
how would you implement a mechanism for, whenever a layer is modified,
do something later with the modified features?. Storing the ids of the
modified features and then using them on the method that is connected
to edittingStopped() won't work in this case.

Thanks in advance.

I can confirm this issue. I've the same problem when work with my complex
projects.
I'm not a developer so I can't propose a solution but I'm available for
testing.

 Does you table have a primary key? What is the table definition?

If the postgres provider can't find a primary key, it will try to use ctid
as the ID. Then I think what you say can happen - when updating a row,
postgres removes the old row and appends a new one and the ctid will change.

Hello,


I need to scale a polygon from python code.

An extract of source code is the following :

           for feat in iter:
              geom = feat.geometry()
              rect = geom.boundingBox()

              x1 = rect.xMinimum()
              y1 = rect.yMinimum()

              x2 = rect.xMaximum()
              y2 = rect.yMinimum()

              xc = (x2 + x1) / 2.0
              yc = (y2 + y1) / 2.0

                elem = geom.asPolygon()

                fat = float(scale) / 100.

                for i in range(geom.exportToWkt().count(',')):

                            vertex = geom.vertexAt(i)

                            x,y = vertex.x(),
vertex.y()

                            xR, yR = x-xc , y-yc
                            xS, yS = xR*fat, yR*fat

                             xT, yT = xS + xc, yS + yc

                             geom.moveVertex(xT, yT, i)


Because the polygon do not change, sure I miss something, to save the
modified element, also if the layer is in editing.

Someone could help me to understand what I wrong ?


Thank you

Roberto

Correct, no PK in my table. What you say sounds feasible. I will try
with another table that has a PK, and see if I can reproduce the error
or not.

I cannot expect to have a PK in the user's table, but this is at least
a clue :-)

Thanks!

Hi

>From QGIS 2.8 there is QgsGeometry.transform() method that works with
QTransform. The following code will scale the sample line segment:

from PyQt4.QtGui import QTransform
g = QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([QgsPoint(-1,0),QgsPoint(1,0)])
g.transform( QTransform().scale(2,2) )
print g.asPolyline()

The code will print [(-2,0), (2,0)]

Cheers
Martin

At the moment QGIS for Windows is built against Qt 4.7.
Qt 4.8 has solved various minor issues, like with SVG rendering inside a
QWebPage, which still affects QGIS 2.6.
Will QGIS 2.8 be built with Qt 4.8?

Hi All

Once of our tests in InaSAFE fails against master (see below). Can someone
tell me where runalg went, and more broadly which parts of the processing
framework can be relied of as API compatible between releases? I guess more
and more people will start relying on its API and we should make it clear
what the best practice is.

Thanks!

I've just meet the same problem

it comes from this commit : 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/956c155e8f45cb1a0fc4c5d6204f607f80edc6b0#diff-111
some imports where removes from processing.__init__.py in context of a 
pep8 check
this is the source of the regression

the core methods should not change...and definitely not the runalg method,
which is likely to be the most important one.

This is clearly a blocker and has to be reverted.

Only 32bit was still built against 4.7.  OSGeo4W 32bit was meanwhile updated to
Qt 4.8.  Just the 2.6.1 standalone installer wasn't updated after that.  The
weekly snapshot of master already uses 4.8.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsComposition itemRemoved signal in Python passes
	a QObject parameter
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=y+6Lnqc=vgW6SFrwN1RxN2kGBeHBZHVkpzDqbv_9aGWA@mail.gmail.com>

I haven't enough experience with SIP to spot the problem.
Connecting to QgsCompisition itemRemoved signal I obtain a QObject
parameter intead of QgsComposerItem.
E.g.

def <something>(self):
      self.composition.itemRemoved.connect(self.itemRemovedFromComposer)

def itemRemovedFromComposer(self,*item*):
      pass

the item parameter is a QObject, while the signal signature is void
itemRemoved( QgsComposerItem* )

Any help?
Thanks,
giovanni

PS: QObject.connect(self.composition, SIGNAL("( QgsComposerItem*
)"),self.itemRemovedFromComposer) doesn't work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Improved Random Point request (for dot density
	maps)
In-Reply-To: <mailman.69.1423253044.4175.qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>
References: <mailman.69.1423253044.4175.qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>
Message-ID: <67CE6951-F745-4A74-BE99-52FB816DA6DE@hbaspecto.com>

For the Vector -> Research Tools -> Random Point -> Stratified sampling design, can we have:

Add "Proportional Value From Input Field" selection, where the user can select a floating point field, and then they could enter either:
1) Number of points on map, or
2) Value of each point.

If the user selects number of points, the algorithm would sum the positive numbers in all the polygons, and sum the absolute value of the negative numbers, and divide the max of these two sums by the number of points specified, to get the value-per-point.  (E.g. if the user specified 1000 points, it would yield no more than 1000 points representing positive values, and no more than 1000 points representing negative values.)

Then the algorithm would iterate through the polygons and for each polygon would divide the absolute value of the user specified field by the value-per-point, round it to the nearest integer, and place that many random points in the polygon.  Each point would be labeled by the value of the field divided by the number of points.

Advantages over current Random Point -> Use value from Input Field:

1) Don't have to generate a new field representing the number of points, if you have a field representing something big and continuous, like Gross Domestic Product per state.
2) Don't have to figure out the value of each point in advance, can specify that you want 1000 points (for positive values) and get 1000 points generated.
3) Generates negative values as well as positive values (I often use blue dots for increases and red dots for decreases in dot-density maps.)
4) Random points are assigned a quantity such that the original value can be retrieved with a sum (i.e. although the number of dots is necessarily rounded to an integer, the
attribute on the dot values can vary between the different polygons.)  (Unless zero points are generated in the polygon.)
5) (related) works on floating point fields.


PS I have this working well in PostGIS and have used it for years.  Function attached.  It's just annoying to use if the data aren't in PostGIS already, and I'd like to rest of the QGIS community to have this cool functionality.  I always thought I'd implement this myself in QGIS code, but I'm starting to realize that I'm neck-deep in too many coding projects right now.  However I would buy beer or pay someone to implement this, if it helps speed it along.

Hi Matteo,

What is the status of
WITH_QWTPOLAR
and
WITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR

on Ubuntu you will probably have to set them both to TRUE or set
WITH_QWTPOLAR to FALSE (in which case, if you still experience troubles
you may have to delete the variables QWTPOLAR_INCLUDE_DIR and
QWTPOLAR_LIBRARY. Deleting these is not the same as setting them to OFF.)

added shell entries to the visual changelog for noteworthy changes.
(My apologies if I accidentally skipped anything!)

Like for 2.6, these are just rough copy+paste notes from the git
commit messages, so I'm now asking for people to go in and flesh out
these entries to make them suitable for the final version, add
screenshots, etc.

Cheers,

Nyall

That should be fixed in master now - try an updated build.

Hi,

I've started adding some screenshots but the system keeps me confused. I
can only see all entries in the version thumbnail view (
http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.8/thumbs/). The version as
list view (http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.8/) is empty and
the version entries list (
http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/2.8/entry/list/) shows only a hand full
of entries.

Is it just me?

Best wishes,
Anita

Roberto,

There's currently a DWG driver in GDAL/OGR that depends on a non-free library 
(Open Design Alliance Teiga). See  http://gdal.org/ogr/drv_dwg.html

There have been projects on developing an alternative driver based on 
LibDWG/LibreDWG : http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SummerOfCode

There's a GRASS import module relying on LibreDWG
https://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass-
addons/grass6/vector/v.in.redwg/v.in.redwg.html

Not sure if anyone else has noticed this.
QGIS 2.6.x on Ubuntu 14.04

If you click the Browser tab as your 1st click inside a fresh run of
QGIS it crashes. Click anything else and then Browser and it's fine.

I've gotten it to work on several machines.

I'm not sure it's in master, but someone should probably check.

Hi Alex,
confirmed, I had this issue several times, but I never took the time to
investivate if fully, as I believed it was a local issue.
Thanks for raising it.
All the best.

Hi,
Where exactly should it crash? I've tried clicking on the tab and inside
the dock but no crashes ...
QGIS 2.6.1 (ubuntugis-unstable) on Ubuntu 14.04

Hi,
I confirm the problem.
You have to be very fast and click on the browser tab after launching qgis.
If you wait a while it works without crashing.

Cheers

Matteo

Hi

I am unable to reproduce with 2.6.1 / master on ubuntu 14.04...

Where exactly do you click? (tree view or header? a particular item in tree
view?)
Is it necessary that the splash screen is still shown?
What do you mean with the "tab" - is it necessary that the browser dock
widget occupies the same are with another dock widget (e.g. Layers), thus
creating two tabs?

Any chance to get a backtrace from the crash?

Maybe a screenshot would help showing where do you click.

Cheers
Martin

the tab is the "Browser Panel label space" where you can read "Browser"
yes i can reproduce in that situation, also ubuntu  generates a crash

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multiple labeling layers ?
Message-ID: <54D8C638.2010708@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

We have a request to refine the way layers can be cached and especially
regarding the handling of labels.

The goal is to be able to optimize what is redrawn during the rendering
when features of only some of the vector layers are moving (a script
somewhere makes them move), and the other vector layers stay the same
(same data, same extent)

I would like to allow labels to be manipulated in a new kind of
"labeling" layers, which could be organised as any other layer in the
legend : on top / above other layers, with blending modes, etc.

The (advanced) user could then choose whether or not to use caching on
some labeling layers (assuming there is a way to cache labels). Of
course, it means labels from a layer could conflict with labels from
another layer, but this may be a tradeoff the user is ready to accept.

By default, the current labeling mechanism will take place: every labels
in the same "layer" on top of every other layers.

I think it could allow new interesting use cases, like when one wants to
use the "inverted polygon" renderer to mask features and want to display
labels only on visible parts.

Are there other interests or on the contrary reluctances for this new
feature ?

Message-ID: <DUB125-W7909B78BE754B112C933EAAE270@phx.gbl>

Hi
I'm working with QGIS 2.2.0 Valmiera, LAStools and Windows 7.
My problem is when I want import the library processing, I don't see anythin problem. But when I use "processing.runalg("lidarlastools:lasground",...)" (for example) i can see the next error: "Error: Algorithm not found".
My paths are:
PYTHONHOME=C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\Python27\
PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python
PATH=C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\bin;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\bin;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\msys\bin;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\Python27\Scripts;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins\processing\core;C:\Program Files\QGIS Valmiera\apps\qgis\python\plugins\processing\lidar\lasground.py;C:\Users\itmati\.qgis2\processing
In the image, it can see that when I invoke lasground nothing appears, indicating that the library is not loaded correctly.
              

Someone had this same problem and knows how to fix it?
thanks RegardsIv?n

Hi PSC/devs,

strk came up with an idea on IRC for a GSOC student.

EvenR pointed to this:

IF we want to mentor, we should very soon make plans.

I made a preliminary wiki page (a copy ...):

please add your ideas.

anybody volunteering to pull this, this year?

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjX3SAF4GYfuJN=zAG9rBO8GAZY7ONuOSbzERH=EaOSwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

If you've been following recent git commits, you'll have noticed a lot
of "Coverity" related commits, and may be wondering what these are all
about.

Coverity Scan ( https://scan.coverity.com/ ) is a powerful automated
static code analyser which is able to detect a large number of code
errors, such as memory leaks and potential crashes, and even things
like accidental copy/paste errors. It's a well respected service and
fortunately offers free testing of open source projects (it's quite
expensive for commercial software).

When we first ran Coverity over the QGIS codebase about 2 weeks ago it
picked up just over 1000 potential issues, with a defect density of
about 1 error per 1000 lines of code. Apparently the standard for
"good" software is a defect density of 1. For comparison, python sits
at 0.08, and the Linux kernel at 0.53. Libreoffice's latest release
hit 0.02, and they used this as a big highlight of their press release
[1].

Thanks to J?rgen and Martin's assistance we're now down to a defect
density of 0.26. I'm hoping that with a bit more work we can smash
this down even further and possibly even reach the coveted "Coverity
Clean" status [2] for 2.8. In any case this is a great demonstration
that we are serious about code quality and stable releases, and is a
good selling point for our first LTS release (alongside the expanding
test suite and Travis CI testing).

Unfortunately we can't automate submission to Coverity via Travis
builds due to the compilation time required to build QGIS using
Coverity exceeding Travis' limits, so I'm currently manually
submitting builds to Coverity on a semi-regular schedule.

The full Coverity defect reports are available by invitation only. If
you're a developer and want to view them, let me know and I'll add you
to the group.

And yours of course. This is some great stabilization to the product.

Yes, thanks Nyall !!

Also for communicating this to us.

What about (/me not pushing, I'm a very slow writer myself...) writing a
small article on your blog (with a score screenie), so the 'general
public' knows about it too?

Another option (not talking to Nyall anymore now ;-) ) would be to write
up about our other 'quality'-thingies we do (tests, automatic testing
etc etc) somewhere on our website.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Congratulations to everyone.

Code quality is something that matters on the long run. Since QGIS only
gets better, I envision a big marathon :P.

Anyone who develops software and understands what these metrics mean know
they are significant, so congratulations again.

That's a great thing Nyall.
It proves QGIS is an industry level product from the side of code quality!
Thanks from me and Gis3W.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with resources_rc
Message-ID: <DUB123-W21B447DF36F8B0FC83B358E2250@phx.gbl>

Hello,
I am newbie developing on python for QGIS.
I am trying to load an image in a label in a form of a plugin that I am developing for QGIS.
I can choose the image from file or from resources. When I choose from "resources" I choose my resources.qrc file of my plugin and then I choose the image I want and  I can see the image in the form from QT4 designer.
Next step is compile and test the plugin opening QGIS 2.6.1 and while opening I receive an error as follows :
No

I already have resources_rc file in the path of
my plugin and it is already compiled so I don't understand what is the problem because I don't find
any other way to load images different than this.
Thanks for all.

Hi,

These are great news, thanks !

I am curious about Coverity. AFAIK, the static analyzer is not open
source, right ? So this works as long as they offer if freely for open
source projects.

What would be very good is to call static analyzers during the build
/testing process (as an option). Has somebody experiences with such
things ? CLang static analyzer ? Valgrind (not static) ? It would be
nice to have these run before each pull request.

What would be also interesting after this coverity pass, is to have a
"QGIS developer guideline" that show frequent mistakes to avoid (beware
of classes with states, use smart pointers, enforce constness, etc.)

Right.  It's propietary.  And IMHO it's also a heavy depencency (IIRC the
download of the tool needed to collect the build logs was 150MB).

We have used cppcheck - but not integrated into the build process.
There are also some good options for gcc (eg. -Weffc++).

I didn't know clang's scan-build[1] before Even Rouault mentioned it on #qgis.
Maybe we could use that with travis.  But it's not packaged in ubuntu and
apparently you have to build clang to get it.

Not sure I find that to be much of a issue. Use what ever works, it seems
to be free for us at the moment and is improving our code a lot, if there
is a open version that works as well that is fine but it's definitely not
something that I personally worry about.  I also wouldn't really call it a
dependency when we are not forced or forcing anyone else to use it.

Sure, on the short term, this is not an issue. It really valuable. And
this is not really a "dependency" since we are not forcing anyone. I agree.

But the day the service stops to be free, we should still deliver code
with a high quality :) Either because we have a free alternative to
static checkers or if every devs know how to avoid code with potential
problems (or if we decide to pay for the service).

Good to know. A CMake option with such compilation flags can be a first
pass.
Using another compiler (Clang) may also help to exhibit different
wwarning messages.

It's shipped with the clang-3.4 package on ubuntu (14.04 here).

I will not be there tomorrow, and I just wanted to remind the points raised 
last June which were important to me.

* The Certification Authority should be an independant, non-profit org, either 
OSGeo, or QGIS association
* The certification platform should be under the CA responsibility but its 
operation be contracted to a private org after an open tender bid. The 
platform operator should not be allowed to give training.
* The exam content should be under the responsibility of the CA, but it could 
be initially contracted to a private org after an open tender bid [1]
* There should be an open process to apply as a "certified trainer", allowing 
to advertise "certification training" and invigilate exams
* Certification should have either a fixed cost, or a cost relative to the 
GNP/mean salary of the country of origin of the trainee [2]

[1] I would rather have an open collective process to build the exams, but 
could be harder to setup.
[2] I would prefer the second option

Questions :
- do we want "certified trainers" or "certified training companies" ?

That's mainly the points on my side, and I would be happy to see all of this 
take place.

Vincent

Hi Tim,

I will try to participate too.
BTW, here is old wiki page about QGIS certification
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Certification

I think it still contains some important topics to discuss.

?Ok thanks for these points Vincent.

In terms of focus for the meeting, I think we need to follow the QGIS PSC
principle of sub/task groups self organizing and try to create a CA group
with a mandate to see the CA come to being and focus the meeting more on
the formation of a group with allocated responsibilities and less on the
the details of how we do it.

So my suggestion is that ?we get say 5 core member to volunteer (and try to
include folks from education institutions in the mix since I think their
outlook is quite different). And then get regular meetings in place to make
sure things progress...say once every two weeks where we can then focus on
the details of things that you have described above.

Regards

Tim

Sure, also MSVC has shown other warnings.  Yes, another proprietary tool we are
currently free to use.

Oh, nice.  I just apt-cache searched for scan-build.  Didn't check if I already
have it. :)

I just tried a scan-build over master and nothing was flagged. I'll
try with a more recent clang release just in case, but anyway, it's
good to have more tools in the arsenal!

I also don't see the non-open source nature of this tool as an issue.
I think with things like this the more analysers we can throw at the
code the better. So cppcheck, scan-build etc should all be used in
parallel to Coverity.

Coverity has the positive that it's seen as a highly respected,
industry-leading tool. So being able to show that it reports our code
as clean (or nearly clean) is a strong argument to QGIS' code quality.

One thing I forgot to mention initially: if anyone's working on
addressing/checking issues on Coverity, please make sure to use the
triage status tools and flag issues as Fix Submitted/False Positive so
that we don't duplicate effort.

Sidenote: this app has been behaving like this earlier, but we've
managed to get the list before. I created/updated items last version
too, and had problems finding them back later or seem not to be published.

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u0FApc0dt72rr9+aJZctZ8-JK-vwk36OpDWhBCf8s5gMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm running QGIS dev (fresh compiled) and I have SAGA 2.1.2 installed in my
computer (both are working).
The problem is that Processing doesn't see SAGA: in the Processing option
dialog the checkbox for SAGA is activated but I cannot run any of its
algorithms.

Am I missing something?

Thanks!

Sounds good. Do I understand correctly you want to avoid having to register
features on every map rendering?

What exactly would be cached - features / label candidates? for one view /
for the whole map?


I would like to allow labels to be manipulated in a new kind of

Recently there was a ticket filed for that:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12131
By reordering do you mean that the labeling could get "under" some other
layers - i.e. wouldn't be drawn always on top?

Or do you mean that a "labeling" layer would actually _draw_ extra labeling
instead of _providing_ features? This could be indeed an interesting piece
of functionality.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] hub.qgis under heavy load?
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcTd8n85W_3ruzmxdzSsq+GXgGCyXUbZeLqUc=_8iw=nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

It seems to me that recently our Redmine instance on hub.qgis.org has often
issues - the page load time can be quite long or the response is just:

> This website is under heavy load
>
> We're sorry, too many people are accessing this website at the same time.
We're working on this problem. Please try again later.

It is displeasing to see such response after sending a longer reply to an
issue.

Does anyone know how to fix that? Is the server really under too much load
or is it just a matter of improving to configuration?


I am starting to be more and more keen on switching to a more stable issue
tracking system - e.g. the one on GitHub where we already keep the main
repository. Compared to Redmine I think there would be just few issues with
it:
- different logins
- support for attachments
- migration
With logins I don't think there is an issue (github is nowadays widely
used). With attachments Redmine supports only small attachments anyway, so
we could just recommend an external service for extra data. Finally, the
migration could bring some headache - numbering of issues would get wrong...

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS LTR and documentation (LTR ?)
Message-ID: <1648072.GPna3lfJ9P@tatras>

Hello,

QGIS 2.8 should be the first LTR. For this release, fix would be backported for 
one year. 

What about the documentation? Can we think a similar support to have the time 
to translate it and correct typo? 

Could this managed in transifex or is just too complex to managed 2 releases 
in the same time?

Thanks,

Y.

I don't really know.  I suspect that it's more the host than our VM - but I've
never used redmine anywhere else so I can't tell if it might be a redmine issue
after all (or maybe mysql - no idea if postgres would perform better - I'd
prefer postgres).

The host had a raid failure and might be still rebuilding - although I don't
really know why that has such a strong effect (maybe because it's running RAID6
- instead of something simple like RAID1 or 10), but even when it's running
normal we often have those issues.  Those might come from bots visiting the
site - but I wonder if that shouldn't be a load that the setup should be
prepared to cope with.

Another thing nice to know would be if those issues would go away if we move
redmine to our server (but we might not be able to see the issues in a test
setup without doing a full switch).

But I haven't worked with github tracking either.  My guess is that redmine is
more sophisticated.  Keeping it in our hand is/could looks like a plus to me -
and also would avoid migration.

IIRC for the documentation, I think that the idea rose that LTR would be 
the only ones documented.

For translations, it would make sense to keep the application 
translatable during its whole life cycle, but I can't say.

I may add, on the other hand, that search in Redmine is currently rather
ugly.
BTW, do we really need all these sophisticated features?
All the best.

Not sure.  I guess that documentation is done for released stuff anyway, so
there's no need to update the documentation while development is still going
on.

I think what we discussed was that transifex is used for master and the release

Agreed, documentation should be updated with each release of QGIS. This way we 
can add documentation for new feature for each new release but have a greater 
look to the next LTR to get the best documentation.

I agree that Github is easier and faster to use than our current Redmine.
I find the approach in Redmine over-engineered.
Searching/filtering is indeed the worst.

What feature in Redmine would we loose (which could not be replaced by 
tags) in Github?

If I do an unstructured text query in the Seach texbox on top right, I
cannot exclude closed tickets, etc., so I usually get many irrelevant
results; I believe this is an important cause for the many duplications
that plague us. I know this is the feeling of many users.

personally probably nothing, that's why I'm asking.

all the best.

Attachments is really all you would loose, but that isn't a big thing.  You
can also just setup sub-tags for different things, eg. platform\windows,
platform\osx, etc.

Personally I think it would be a good move.

If I am correct, during labeling the most demanding task is the global
optimization to compute label positions. So these label positions could
be cached for one set of labels (in a labeling layer), provided the
underlying vector layers are also cached.

Yes the idea would be to separate the vector layers that provide
features and layers that actually draw labels. So yes, labels that could
be drawn not always on top. Or labels from a set of layers drawn
independently from labels of some other set of labels (with possible
overlaps in this case).

Exactly. Each labelling layer would refer to a set of vector layers
which provide features. The PAL optimization would be run on each
labeling layer and labels rendered in their own layer.

I am also investigating another optimization idea: the good old global
labeling on top of every other layers, but with a way to "partially"
solve the placement problem. Could it be possible to inject precomputed
label positions in PAL ? So that a part of the label positions would be
already known from a previous frame and some other labels would have to
be recomputed ? The 'obstacle' feature of PAL is interesting, but
probably not "strong" enough to really avoid overlapping ...

Actually not - the global optimization is quite fast (after all that was
the intent of the PAL library), usually it is extraction of label
candidates and calculation of their costs (for polygons) that make up most
of the time.

In some cases finding of the solution can still be a bottleneck - e.g.
zoomed out map with huge amount of overlapping labels.

I have done measuring of the labeling performance quite a long time ago, so
it may be a good idea to check again where the speed issues are. Various
placement options have their own issues.

Yes, this is already being done with data-defined positions of labels.

It is hard to guess what would help the most. Probably the best would be to
first measure the times of few scenarios and decide what/where/how to cache
based on the hard data.

I see. I thought this part was also done by PAL. I understand that
computing position of candidate bounding boxes (evaluating expressions,
include font metrics, centroids, etc.) may be the hardest part.

Yes. So caching results from registering and PAL may be a good option.

Ah good to know.
I guess it is the fixedPos and fixedAngle parameters of
pal::Layer::registerFeature ?

We more or less agreed on doing some research on it:

-1- Tim already asked if someone could try to find a way/script to move
current issues to a dummy repo to try out.

-2- We have to think about an easy upload service though: data attached
to a issue should stay on that service long enough for an long
outstanding issue....
Maybe a simple Django upload app?

So anybody available to dive into this?
And come up with some results?

ps as said by Juergen: maybe it's just the fault disk that is playing us
up...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] refresh postgis layer
Message-ID: <CAJvUf_uvKtOWOwZC2YwzYQEq-0rODpMukp=9RDksmWZMqoHUzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello dear list,

in  the process of developing a plugin (python 2.7, QGIS 2.6),

from pyqgis ,
we would like to refresh a Postgis layer.
When using the vectorLayer.refresh(), it does nothing.

We used a trick that works but seems like a bad idea :
(we slightly change the zoom to force rendering)
DEFAULT_SEGMENT_EPSILON = 1E-8
mapCanvas().zoomByFactor(1.0 + DEFAULT_SEGMENT_EPSILON, mapRect.center())

Somebody knows how to do it properly?
Thanks,
R?mi-C

Try vectorLayer.triggerRepaint()

Calling refresh() of the canvas will not work because even though the
canvas will get refreshed, it will use previously cached map images. With
triggerRepaint() the cached map image of your layer will get cleared and
also refresh() will be called for any canvas that displays such layer.

Message-ID: <CAJvUf_u_RKsRth=CdLz3k8W2n-7Tsqbk+Bg0ffk6d=VhYTaZOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again dear list,

Our goal is to save (commitchanges) any modification of a vector layer when
it happens.


We encountered another problem when trying to exploit the
layer.geometryChanged event.

Upon activation of this event, we tried to use the layer.commitChanges() to
save changes in geometry of the layer (postgis layer, maybe not related),

But it hard-crashes QGIS.
A quick gdb look seems to indicate a rollback issue??

The workaround we found was to use thread with short timers, but is is ill
suited for this.

Python 2.7, QGIS 2.6, Linux 64.

Somebody know how to fix this issue ?

Many thanks,
R?mi-C

It is not a good idea to try to commit changes in a slot connected to a
signal about layer modification - crashes due to corrupted undo stack can
be expected (the undo stack is not in final state yet at the time of the
signal being emitted). Also often the changes are done in batches (e.g.
field calculator) and if you committed changes after each single change,
this may lead to poor performance due to separate transactions.

I think for your use case you could watch changes to the undo stack and
commit whenever you detect a new undo command is added (e.g.
canUndoChanged() or indexChanged() signal) you could commit the changes.

Martin

Hey Martin,
thanks for the answer (again !)

Apparently it still doesn't refresh anything.
When I do it manually I use the "Refresh" button, and this works.
(The zoom trick also works)

Could it be because the layer needing refresh are not only the active layer
but all the others?

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Tags are an oversimplification, as you have to use them for area or
subareas topic as well as severity and status.

Can you search Github's issues for tags on topic rendering, of severity
blocker, against milestone 2.8, that are open?

There's an API right? Maybe we build a custom search tool to github issues?


No idea if Redmine is the issue, I have never run a Redmine with this
much load. It was running well last year after a Ruby upgrade but not
sure if anyone has upgraded Redmine itself.


As for the hardware story, OSGeo is now looking at buying a new machine
to replace the one QGIS Hub is currently on. QGIS' input on this buy
would be useful, and we could even beef it up if QGIS wants to help out
financially. The likely setup will be software raid5 and docker,
learning from previous issues.
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Transition_Plan_2014#Hardware

Also there's discussion of implementing GitLab on the new hardware,
which is very similar to Github but would allow OSGeo Logins and Github
logins.

PS: there are a couple of pure Django Issue trackers out there. No VCS
integrated but that doesn't matter if the code is on Github.

Thanks,
Alex

I think following crayfish tags:
 - hydraulics
 - hydraulic modelling
 - flood
are universal and I will happily adopt them to have a proper grouping.
Maybe we could consider: 'flow', 'river' and 'channel 'as another tags
common to our plugins?

Thanks for the link. I would have liked to be involved but couldn't be
there today.

I know this was discussed briefly before but I'm still unsure of the
answer. Is the main push to test tool competency or is underlying knowledge
of spatial problems and processes part of the purpose?  I have materials
from my GIS intro course I teach for the University of Calgary that is more
focused on understanding that uses QGIS. I am willing to share these but
the how to sections are older and would need to be updated (I teach this
course every 18 months).

I realize that this will be QGIS focused and to provide something similar
to commercial certification the focus needs to mostly focus on tool
specific competency. I would however suggest that having a solid coverage
of basic GIS knowledge would be a step up over commercial certification
programs where it is not uncommon to see people with credentials on paper
who understand very little.

If someone can fill me in where we are at that level of specifics I would
appreciate it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compression in libpq?
Message-ID: <54DDC343.70808@carto.net>

Hi,

Just came across this:

http://michael.otacoo.com/postgresql-2/postgres-9-5-feature-highlight-pglz-compression-libpqcommon/

This read is very technical.

Question: does this mean that a future libpq will support compression? I 
think this would be very interesting for us, esp. if you work with 
PostgreSQL connections through slower network connections. I always 
found remote Postgis connections that are not on the same LAN quite slow.

Any comments?

Andreas

Andreas, did you you try to setup these connection over ssh ? ssh -C 
uses gzip

Hi Jean-Roc,

Thanks about this hint. I am vaguely aware about this option with pg 
connections through ssh with gzip. But I did not try it. Do you have any 
pointers how to set this up?

Anyway - having this built in to our existing software without having to 
set up ssh connections would be a big plus.

Thanks,
Andreas

The connections are made through KiTTY which create a ssh tunnel, all 
the applications then connect to the distant postgresql server like a 
local one with the bonus of encryption, compression and no application 
specific setup (even if I would love having an unblocked 5432 port).

Hi Trevor,
We never really discussed that during the meeting, though it?s a good question. The meeting more went in an ?assigning tasks? kind of direction, touching a few questions here and there. I think one of the potential tasks was going to be about covering that sort of question. It?s also something I?ll try and work into the questionnaire I?m formulating.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Thanks for the link. I would have liked to be involved but couldn't be there today.

I know this was discussed briefly before but I'm still unsure of the answer. Is the main push to test tool competency or is underlying knowledge of spatial problems and processes part of the purpose?  I have materials from my GIS intro course I teach for the University of Calgary that is more focused on understanding that uses QGIS. I am willing to share these but the how to sections are older and would need to be updated (I teach this course every 18 months).

I realize that this will be QGIS focused and to provide something similar to commercial certification the focus needs to mostly focus on tool specific competency. I would however suggest that having a solid coverage of basic GIS knowledge would be a step up over commercial certification programs where it is not uncommon to see people with credentials on paper who understand very little.

If someone can fill me in where we are at that level of specifics I would appreciate it.

Hi,

Another option is to use SSL, which since version 0.9.8 uses compression by 
default. In this case you do not need any specific software neither tunnels.

SSH tunnels are a good solution too though. 
Setting up a VPN with compression activated is another option.

Just be aware that compressing compressed data is useless, so better choose a 
single option and stick to it.

Vincent

I think the issue is that only a small number of entries show up in
the "pending entries" list. It looks like it's hard coded to only show
10 or so, and there's no pagination controls to navigate through the
entries.

Does that sound correct?

Hi !

I work with Remi-C on this project/plugin QGIS.

What we do now:
- Connect on the signal : 'currentLayerChanged(QgsMapLayer*)' on QgisInterface to track the current layer and the switching layer event
- On the current layer : we use the signal 'layerModified()' to detect modification on current layer -> we try to commitChanges this layer

The result is ... good but we have a problem when we use multiple selection (nodes) with 'Node Tool'. (single selection work fine)

A hard-crash QGIS appear.
GDB indicate a problem with NodeTools and the method 'deselectAllVertexes'
Here a short view of gdb stack:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

We use QGIS 2.6 (try with 2.7) Python 2.7, on Linux Ubuntu x64 & Windows 7 x64.
The data provider for the Vector Layer is memory.

Hi,

I would like to ask for your feedback to improve the documentation
of QgsProject.clearProperties (
http://qgis.org/api//classQgsProject.html#ae23318aec80be782d330ce36097b2e5d).
I'm afraid the current wording is dangerously confusing. Only one of the
last lines gets to the point that it "removes all project properties".

Imho, that should be the first line. And add a fat exclamation mark too.
Currently it reads like the function is totally harmless and only clears
some plugin properties:

syntactic sugar for property lists

extra properties, typically added by plug-ins

This allows for extra properties to be associated with projects. Think of
it as a registry bound to a project.

Properties are arbitrary values keyed by a name and associated with a
scope. The scope would presumably refer to your plug-in. E.g.,
"openmodeller".
... It somehow reads like these lines don't actually belong to this method
but are ment to describe something else.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

That is actually the only part meant to document the method.  There
rest was commented out stuff.

Message-ID: <d5ca601ffa2fca360ccf7150f54c7beb@carto.net>

Hi,

I am trying to get correct NULL values in the GetFeatureInfo response of 
QGIS server.

Just recently this was fixed by J?rgen - see 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12114

So I recompiled and tried to configure the NULL setting in a QGIS.ini 
file. However, I seem to have troubles with my configuration. Strings 
still appear as "" instead of NULL and missing values for numbers as 0.

Here is what I tried:

specified variable QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH in 
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/env.conf:

SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/etc"

I placed a file at /etc/QGIS/QGIS.ini (also tried QGIS2.ini) - neither 
worked.

Content of the file:

-------------------
[Qgis]
nullValue=NULL
-------------------

Do you have any idea what I did wrong that NULL values still don't work 
in QGIS Server GetFeatureInfo?

Thanks,
Andreas

The ini file should be in the path that QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH points to.

That's the default anyway.  So it doesn't matter whether or not the file is
found.   Which format are you requesting GetFeatureInfo in?  Did you try with
QGIS Desktop?  Because that's what I did.

Hi J?rgen,

I am sorry - my fault. I compiled and then forgot "make install" - so it 
was still using the old version. NULL values are working fine now - 
thanks!

I have three more questions regarding the ini file:

1.
should it be QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH or QGIS_OPTION_PATH? I see both 
variations out there.

2.
So if, my ini-file is in /etc/QGIS/QGIS.ini I need to point 
QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH to

/etc/QGIS ?

3.
should it be QGIS.ini or QGIS2.ini ?

--------------------

I found documentation at 
http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/uk/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_server_support.html#environment-variables
----------------


     QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH: The variable specifies path to directory with 
settings. It works the same ways as QGIS application ?optionspath 
option. It is looking for settings file in 
<QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH>/QGIS/QGIS2.ini. For exaple, to set QGIS server on 
Apache to use /path/to/config/QGIS/QGIS2.ini settings file, add to 
Apache config:

     SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/path/to/config/"

----------------

Is this information wrong then?

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server GetFeatureInfo and quoting of strings
Message-ID: <f673ffa90f1b6f4a61261d6b5c2c12c0@carto.net>

Hi all, Hi J?rgen,

Your recent modification also changed quoting of text strings in 
GetFeatureInfo. Before, strings were not quoted, after your 
modification, they are.

I would suggest that the quotation is only done in case of format 
text/plain, and not in text/html or text/xml. Because now I need to 
modify QGIS Web-Client to remove all these quotes ... QGIS web client 
uses text/xml by default.

What to people think about this suggestion?

Thanks,
Andreas

$ git grep -n QGIS_OPTIONS
ChangeLog:9620:    mapserver QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH support, fixes #10327
src/server/qgis_map_serv.cpp:253:  QString optionsPath = getenv( "QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH" );

So it's QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH.

With QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH set to /etc/qgis it looks in (from strace -f -p $PIDOFAPACHESLAVE -e open):

[pid  6047] open("/etc/qgis/QGIS/QGIS2.ini", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  6047] open("/etc/qgis/QGIS.ini", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  6047] open("/etc/xdg/QGIS/QGIS2.ini", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  6047] open("/etc/xdg/QGIS.ini", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

> 3. should it be QGIS.ini or QGIS2.ini ?

Apparently both work and QGIS2.ini in the QGIS subdirectory takes precedence.

No, but it describes just the first option.

Only strings were quoted - but not only in plain/text.  Before all values in
plain/text where quoted leading to 'NULL' for null values.

On second thought - that 'NULL' is actually the string representation of the
null value the quoting was ok.  I restored the old behaviour (and now numeric
values are also quoted again).

Hi J?rgen,

Thank you for the clarifications. Are the file paths/names case 
sensitive? On Unix I would assume yes?

Hi,

tried to install the wktraster-plugin but with no luck. 

error in german: *Metadatendatei fehlt*
which means:  meta datafile is missing.

Any other solution to display rasters from PostGIS in Qgis?

Regards
walter

Database manager should do it, but i get errors too:

GDAL provider: Konnte GDAL-Rasterkanal nicht bestimmen: 
Raster layer: Datenlieferant ist ung?ltig (Lieferant: gdal, URI: PG:
dbname=nepal host=localhost user=osm port=5432 mode=2 schema=public
column=rast table=nepal)


which means: 

GDAL provider: Could not find/use/get? GDAL rasterchannel
Raster layer: Datasource is illegal (Source ...)

the info in braces is ok to me.

the raster has been loaded with raster2pgsql and when i do an export with
PHP, everything is fine.

regards
walter

after adding  -C  to the raster2pgsql command now  i can display the raster

Ok, it's black but the dimensions are fine.

Walter,

wktraster doesn't seem supported anymore and haven't been upgraded for QGIS 
2.0.

You should be able to display raster via DB-manager and add them into QGIS. I 
remember testing a little bit this way a while.

Hey,

postgis raster without bug and/or excessive slowness.

I confirm, DB Mahager shows PGrasters, except for -R ones (ticket opened).
All the best.

This happens regardless of where the binary is placed. Using ctrl-open

Message-ID: <CAM_TN3-O=0npYFo2q3ZPcXZwq-xMK8iCxeiVi4EhEabwe_SE3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
excuse me for the very very newby question.

I want to add a button in my custom form in order to toogle the editing
status of a layer. I try to navigate the qgis api but I can't understand
the way to stop editing and save/reject modify. I try to insert a code like
this [0] (obviously the else part doesn't fit my request, it's just a
pleaceholder to try my code).

[0]
def toggleEdit():
        aLayer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('layer')[0]
        if not aLayer.isEditable():
                aLayer.startEditing()
        else:
                aLayer.rollBack(True)

any hint ?
thanks in advance

Luca

Hello !

We have found a solution/workaround for our problem.

Instead of using directly the signal 'LayerModified', we use the signal 'renderComplete' from QgsMapCanvas.
At this step, we are sure to have a 'clean' state with the others tools/plugins (like Node Tool).
We connect the signal 'layerModified' after the reception of the signal 'renderComplete'.

We don't know if it's the perfect/good solution, but it seems to work ^^

Hi !

I work with Remi-C on this project/plugin QGIS.

What we do now:
- Connect on the signal : 'currentLayerChanged(QgsMapLayer*)' on QgisInterface to track the current layer and the switching layer event
- On the current layer : we use the signal 'layerModified()' to detect modification on current layer -> we try to commitChanges this layer

The result is ... good but we have a problem when we use multiple selection (nodes) with 'Node Tool'. (single selection work fine)

A hard-crash QGIS appear.
GDB indicate a problem with NodeTools and the method 'deselectAllVertexes'
Here a short view of gdb stack:

Hello,

It seems that the problem come from joins layer that are not well suported in 
the qgis server side.

Any idea why joins layers are not well supported in QGIS server?

Hi there,
reactivating this thread and also pushing it to the dev list to maybe  
receive a statement:

Is it somehow planned to include the BETA2007.gsb and the resulting  
changes into QGIS for 2.8 by default?

I received already some questions, cause now even german bureaucracy is  
waking up and tell users to switch to ETRS and transform the data from  
Gauss-Krueger.
But for the majority of QGIS users, this will be rocket science if they  
even learn THAT they have to create custom CRS, change srs.db entries and  
do other wizardry.

So far, googling "QGIS" and "BETA2007" yields no results on any moves into  
this direction.
But without, QGIS users in Germany will likely produce tons of trash data  
in the near future or already do so without knowing (me included till  
today).

Also see https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11347

... or is is not that critical as I believe it is?

Cheers
Bernd

exactly because ntv2 transformations should not be rocket sciemce for
the users, we (Portuguese qgis user group, with the initial help of
Alexander Bruy) created this plugin

http://www.qgis.pt/plugins/plugins.xml

Given that you can redistribute the gsb files (and for Portugal this
is possible) then the ntv2 transformations become trivial.

I had already had a thought of expanding this plugin and adding the
transfomations for countries that have available gsb grids and allow
them to redistribute.

If someone is interested or need it just let me know.

Cheers

Hello,

When I try to install my plugin, QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin, with the 
"Manage and Install Plugins..." dialog, the message "This plugin is 
broken, invalid syntax" is displayed.

I think that the reason is I uploaded my plugin as 
"QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin-master.zip" file containing a 
"QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin-master" folder and python does not like the 
'-'. Am I right ? How to solve the problem ?

Hi Giovanni,

thanx for your answer.

Just contacted the organization which might be in charge to answer the  
question about the circumstances to redistribute that file.

I hope we are talking of the same stuff: I mean this one  
http://crs.bkg.bund.de/crseu/crs/descrtrans/BeTA/BETA2007.gsb or  
http://crs.bkg.bund.de/crseu/crs/descrtrans/BeTA/BETA2007.gsa

Sorry, this topic is quite new for me, so I do not really know what I am  
talking about ;)

But do I see it correctly, that the "normal" way to reproject a layer with  
"Save as ..." will produce quite inaccurate results, and that the users  
have to be aware that they could/should use a plugin?
So there will be two ways to reproject the data,the default one (not so  
accurat) and a plugin version (more accurate)?

Cheers
Bernd

Hi Bernd,

Here [0] we have an explanation of how the coordinate systems works in
general, and in particular in QGIS. You also find solutions to use the NTv2
grids with QGIS. Unfortunately, the text is in portuguese, but perhaps
Google Translate can help [1].

This is a way that each user must do individually. To make life easier for
portuguese users, as we also have a lot of information that needs to be
transformed to ETRS89, portuguese QGIS User Group developed the plugin that
Giovanni told you [2], which greatly simplifies things, because it is
integrated into Processing Toolbox and already provides the NTv2 grids.

As Giovanni said, if there is interest from other countries and if we can
freely redistribute the NTv2 grids, we can expand the plugin.


Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Hi Tim (and all),
Per the IRC meeting, I've come up with a possible questionnaire that we can spam. Currently it's all text, but it can be converted easily enough. What platform should we stick it on for the question/answers? I can do a free surveymonkey unless someone has something better to suggest.

Suggestions as to questions/answers welcome from all. It is a first draft.

Cheers,
Jonathan

QGIS 1.8 Lisboa is the oldest version I have running, and that had 
already Python 2.7. I guess you would not like to work with versions 
older than that.

To be honest, gooogle translate is of limited help for people who use 
English only as a second language. I think it would help more if you set 
up a special English page, as the Dutch QGIS community does for issues 
with worldwide interest.

And http://planet.qgis.org/planet/ would be a good platform to promote 
those topics.

There are lots of ntv2 grids available for free, and telling the user : 
"Put your local ntv2 grid in here" is affordable. That works for 
non-free grids too.

This looks good. I do have one suggestion. For the second last question of
"What do you think would be a good way of measuring suitability for a
certificate", I think it is more complex. For example, for a developer
certification, I would assume most people would think that community
participation would be important. However for the other certifications,
exams might be more suitable. I can even see cases for trainers where we
might want to institute a train the trainer type of course that would be
mandatory (even if an online course) to ensure that people who want to be
trainers can benefit from the knowledge and experience of experienced
teachers / trainers.

Because of this complexity you might want to separate this out into
questions like:

For a QGIS User certification, what do you think would be a good way of
measuring suitability for a certificate...
For a QGIS Professional certification, what do you think would be a good
way of measuring suitability for a certificate...
For a QGIS Developer certification, what do you think would be a good way
of measuring suitability for a certificate...
For a QGIS Trainer certification, what do you think would be a good way of
measuring suitability for a certificate...

Message-ID: <0FE8C5AD-B459-47AC-A3ED-27F795EB9891@me.com>

Hi all, 

I?m interested on developing the multithreading support on Processing in order to allow the user to continue to use the program even when if it is processing some data. I?m new to QGIS but I?m want to develop this idea and learn more about QGIS in order to plan how to implement it. Can you give some clues on where to look at?  

I already saw the AlgorithmExecutor and Unthreaded AlgorithmExecutor code:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_0/python/plugins/processing/gui/UnthreadedAlgorithmExecutor.py <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_0/python/plugins/processing/gui/UnthreadedAlgorithmExecutor.py>

Do you think this is enough for the GSoC? If so, can you help me to create some ?project description? to put on the GSoC page?

Best regards,
Marcus Santos

Thanks a lot for the response.

This is very strange because I saw on a mac a QGIS 2.0 with python 2.6 
in the QGIS console. Maybe it depends on which version of python is 
installed during the installation ?

Greetings,

Marc

QGIS on Mac does not contain it's own python. It uses the system default
python. Only on Windows do we include python as the OS provides none.

That said, is the real question, at which version did we move to only
Python 2.7+ working?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Trevor,
            Good suggestion and something I?d thought of myself (though yours has more detail). However to simplify this version I decided to skip that. Further, if it does get published via a free SurveyMonkey, I think you only get 10 questions, so will have to think carefully about exactly which ones to use.

Cheers,
Jonathan

According to this ticket: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/219
Osgeo4w moved from Python 2.5 to 2.7 three years ago.

https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/RequiresPython mentiones QGIS 1.7.3 
as stable and 1.8.0 as dev version at that time.

That does not mean it won't compile against 2.6 though. The question is
when was the Python API modified in a way that 2.6 no longer works.
Finding out the last release for a Mac OS that had 2.6 is probably the
best indicator.

http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/archive

Makes me think OS X 10.6 (I think 10.7 had python 2.7), so any version
of QGIS for 10.6 probably still worked with python 2.6.

Or a dev who knows the Python api can tell us when and if python 2.6
compatibility was broken.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,

I think the grids of the major countries should be included in QGIS 
core. E.g. the german gsb file is only 87 kb. This could easily be 
distributed with QGIS core.

It is the duty of the local QGIS user groups to come up with a solution 
for their users - either by bundling it in QGIS core or through a plugin 
or good tutorial.

It would make the life much easier for the average user.

Redistributable files should IMHO be shipped with PROJ.4.

http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ lists a bunch of third party grids - including the
BETA2007 - but it's not clear if the files are redistributable.

BTW the BETA2007 grid is already supported in QGIS' datum transforms.  It will
offer a transformation using the grid if it's available.

obviously the best choice, thanks Juergen.
re: the Portuguese plugin: why not publishing in the officail repo, as a
first step?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi

today I found a new plugin

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/VerticalHorizon/

set as experimental, but without code repo and bugtrack

It is assumed that for published but experimental plugin this data
could not be set?

in my opinion, at least bugtrack would be set. If a plugin creates
malfunctions we need a way to trace and notify these errors to the
author.

Hi Gino,

There has been a lot of dicussions about what fields are mandatory.

The decision was to leave tracker and repository "recommended" but not
mandatory, the plugin owner and staff will see this warning:

Some important informations are missing from the plugin metadata
(homepage, tracker or repository). Please consider creating a project
on hub.qgis.org and filling the missing metadata.

Agreed, that's the way I manage it.
In fact, I opened a ticket on the plugin creator, to make these fields
recommended instead of optional.
Thanks for noticing, I'd be in favour of unpublishing it.
All the best.

Hi Luigi,

While a bugtracker and a code repository are definitely a good thing to
have I do not think that it should be mandatory from the beginning.

It should be required that a way to contact the developer (mail), the
source code and license are there.

At the beginning (experimental) state of a plugin the dev may be worried
about other things than the bugtracker and telling him by mail about
possible defects is fine (it's him who has to deal with this).

Plugins need to be open source, but the way they handle project
management and community should be up to the plugin author. So the best
thing we can do is send him a notice with "what has been tested by and
proven helpful for others in the past".

Putting too many requirements in place may scare people off.

I think being minimal with regard to requirements is important for
experimental plugins and IMHO I would treat it the same way for stable
plugins but there is a bit more space to discuss requirements I think.

How do others feel?

Best regards,
Matthias

The problem was the name of the folder "QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin-master" 
(python does not like the '-'). The solution was to remove the plugin 
and re-submit it with a folder name without '-'.

As I understand it, the problem was the name, as in the error message:

the plugin main folder name in the compressed file
(QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin) is different from the original plugin package name

All the best.

Hi,

the problem is not Python not liking the "-" but that the name of the
folder inside the zip package did not match the plugin name.

The error message that appears when you upload such a plugin should be
clear enough, if it isn't please suggest a better error message and I
will change it:

" Plugin name mismatch: the plugin main folder name in the compressed
file (QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin) is different from the original plugin
package name (QgisGeoJSONExportPlugin-master)."

Let me recapitulate my experience, after several months of managing the
publication process:

* most developers add repo and bugtracker anyway
* most use github for the code, so thie is really a non-issue for them
* when gently asked if they can fill the metadata, almost all adhere,
and usually show gratitude for the attention
* if I remember correctly, nobody ever found adding a repo and a
bugtracker a stumbling block (occasionally they need help for this, but
I can do that), nor scaring
* having the fields as optional in the plugin builder does not encourage
them to fill the fields
* before publishing a plugin I check it; not having a bugtracker makes
things more difficult and far less reliable to keep track of the process
(I send a mail, the I have to remember, check the thread etc.)

So in short I think making them mandatory will make the process more
reliable, with a minimal overhead for authors; alternatively, making
them recommended would be a step in the good direction.

Of course I will not start a flame about this, I can keep on managing
like this.

All the best.

Thank you for these insights Paolo,

Nice to hear that most plugin developers add bugtracker and repository
anyway.

Switching the fields to recommended instead of optional sounds like a
good step into the right direction. Maybe there could even be a pointer
to github to make it easier for unexperienced developers.

All the best,
Matthias

Hi Mathias,

I don't understand the difference between "optional" and
"recommended", I mean the fields are already "optional" (not
mandatory) and "recommended" because the developer (and staff members)
every time they browse the plugin page see the following message:

Some important informations are missing from the plugin metadata
(homepage, tracker or repository). Please consider creating a project
on hub.qgis.org and filling the missing metadata.

This is what I mean with "recommended", and you?

Of course we can print a better message, suggestions welcome!

Making the field mandatory would prevent all plugins without those
fields from being uploaded in the first place.

The difference mentioned by Paolo. As I understand it concerns the
plugin builder but Paolo and you probably know this scope a lot better
than I.

That's what I prefer not to happen. But it is no strong opinion.

Kind regards,

Thanks, it's clear now.

I was just talking about the plugins repository (plugins.qgis.org),
the validation rules do not require for tracker & C. but only issue a
warning if they are empty and provide hints to the author about how to
solve the problem.

Of course, the plugin builder should do the same, but the plugin
builder could be used for local in-house plugins and in that case
enforcing tracker & C, is pointless.

I agree with you, I think that we should only recommend and not force.
On a case by case basis, plugin approvers (staff members) could
enforce this rule.

The reason is that IMHO for smaller/simple/first-time-users plugins
the tracker & C might not always be necessary.

I also do not have a strong opinion, if we decide to make them
mandatory it's perfectly fine, just be prepared to have lot of fakes
in the homepage field: only a few plugins have a real home page, most
of the times a github repo is all what they have (but it can count as
home and tracker).

Instead of re-discussing this topic twice a year, we should maybe ask
the PSC to take a decision or (better) ask the dev community to vote.

Message-ID: <CACfnYnRvz0gCcq1Qm6PZLEaWsvJy3eB3xzXs2g2=RxyPVdLgFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


> obviously the best choice, thanks Juergen.


of course this is the best choice, but especially in case of grids not
available as part of proj (maybe because the institution that does
create the grid has no interest or idea about proj) the use from a
user point of view is a pain in the a**, as already commented.

the plugin as it was created solves a common, difficult, problem for
the users in the most simple and transparent way: as every grid is
about a specific A <-> B transformation, then the involved coordinate
reference systems are hardcoded with the correct and best definition
for that specific grid/transformation. This way the user does not have
to worry about anything, it just need to know in what CRS are the
input layers. Of course the plugin is not for on the fly
transformations, but rather to create copies of layers in new CRSs,
with the best possible precision.

> re: the Portuguese plugin: why not publishing in the officail repo, as a
> first step?

we choose a safe approach: let the local users test it extensively.
And then our feedback was that most of them wanted a localized plugin.
At that time localization in processing was not yet available, so we
kept the plugin in a separate repo. This could change, because now
processing supports localization (right?) and maybe because others are
intersted in expading it to support grids/transformations for other
countries.

IMHO a GH page would do as HP for simple plugin; many of these have
reasonable explanations on this (and if not, an user can always send a
pull req).
I think discussing this twice a year is not bad: we are a fast evolving
project, and needs change quickly.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Creating script (conflict with python/Grass +
	wrong folders)
Message-ID: <54E5F325.2030806@alice.it>

Hello everybody,
it's my first mail and I hope you can help me.

In the past year I create (with other people) 3 scripts connecting QGIS 
with Hec-RAS.
The problems started when to check to behaviour of the original program, 
I installed ArcGis in the same pc. From that moment, I started to have a 
lot of problems (freeze first of all in GRASS and in QGIS, than problems 
in deleting files in GRASS) and i saw that not all the programs worked 
in the right way.

So I worked all this period in a Virtual Machine with only QGIS/Grass 
inside it. I created the script in QGIS 2.0 and everything worked ok 
with following versions. But always inside the Virtual Machine.

On the main machine, I saw that the great problem is that in the output 
file (a .sdf which is like a txt) there is a "start new paragraph" for 
some lines. I've done the same path with python in GRASS and everything 
works fine.

Can you confirm that there're conflict between pythons installed with 
different programs?
(I've got a lot of troubles to uninstall Arcgis and to uninstall and 
reinstall Qgis because there are a lot of pieces around the pc.. many of 
them I deleted in the regedit too but I'm not sure to have done all the 
work).

Is is right to put the python file inside the QGIS\bin folder meanwhile 
the txt file (the algorithm) inside the 
...\QGIS\apps\qgis\python\plugins\processing\(algs\)grass\description 
folder?

Thanks for the help

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Better tags for plugins
Message-ID: <54E618CD.1020308@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
As many of you may have noticed, the current situation with plugin tags
is far from ideal: lots of tags, some pretty useless, lack of
convergence towards the most representative ones.
Now Gary came out with a list of suggestions for plugin builder:
https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/blob/master/taglist.txt
I believe this may greatly increase consistency, so it would be
important to have a general consent about the most useful tags (not too
many, not too few).
Therefore, your comments and pull requests will be useful.
All the best, and thanks Gary for taking this.

Agreed, but this is the (free) nature of tag based classification vs
category based classification, if we want a defined set of tags, we
should turn them into categories (multiple choice, of course).

Hi Jonathan


PS might be nicer to discuss / cross post this to the QGIS community list -
I have been trying to marshall QGIS certification discussions there and a
number of edut folks are subscribed to it I think.

So I think this sounds fine. I noted Trevor's comments below, but I think
it will be fine to go ahead with these Questions and see what kind of
feedback we get.

Thanks for working on this!

I took a look through the list and if you wany to make a consistent set of
tags to use then the list will need to be short and obvious.In this light I
would make the following suggestions:

1. The is comprised of items that could be used to make components of
larger items. If there is a desire to make the list standard but not be a
prescriptive as categories individual tags could be used to describe more
complex tasks. For example right now there is:
attribute
attribute edit
attribute table
These could be replaced by attribute, edit, and table and combined with
other things to keep the list short

2. There isn't a consistent time tense in the terms, for example geocoding
and print. Using geocode and print would be more consistent

3. bing and google are listed, perhaps a use of wms would be sufficient

4.Some items are plural and other singular. Again it would be more
consistent for all tags to be singular if possible

There may be other was the list can be shortened even further but those are
my thoughts for now.

Thanks for the suggestions, most of us are not mothertongue english
speakers and your help is precious.

Would you mind writing a short sentence that summarize the rules for
an ideal tag?
I could add them into http://plugins.qgis.org website and maybe they
can also be added to the plugin builder.

For Bing and Google, technically speaking they aren't WMS, more like TMS.

Hey,

I did some refactoring to two conversion helpers in QgsGdalProviderBase class.
Goal is to improve const and type correctness and shorten the files by removing duplicate statements, thus improving code quality.

This should not change behaviour in any way.

Attached patch file was created against git master branch from today.
Please review.

Thanks,

Hi David

would be better pull request your patch in the github qgis code. In
this way it's simple to test your patch, add comments and trace the
its life cycle.

here a brief guide how to proceed
http://spatialgalaxy.net/2010/12/27/contributing-to-qgis-using-git/

a similar guide is available inside the qgis code:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CODING

Yes, the About is often neglected. I invite plugin authors to add a
reasonable description, but I cannot enforce this.
A very good idea would be for the user to write a short note and add it
to a feature request, through the plugin bugtracker; even better, this
could be added as a Pull Request on the plugin repository.
All the best, and thanks.

This would be a very good enhancement.
Please do it if you can.

Hi! I am using qgis web client, and I need to set QGIS server searching.
Is there any way LIKE in query, to change filerOp from '=' to like?

Sorry, i18n/qgis_zh-Hans.ts wasn't added.  I removed the tar ball.

Making this a pull request would also have feeded the patch into travis-ci and
revealed that this doesn't build as there are now ints passed to the methods
where enums are now expected.

For code quality I'd also keep the last return and remove the default case
instead.  That way the compiler can warn about missing cases (eg. if we missed
one or when new enum values are added to GDAL).  Commited that way as de8a002.


Now back into release packaging mode...

I have done this:

And always have an invalid layer.


And then, how I have to filter by different geomtry types?

Luigi already pointed that out, makes sense.
Will do next time.

Thanks for the review. 
I see your point, but I suggest this should rather be handled by a unit test, a linter or -Wswitch-enum for recent compilers.
I consider switch w/o default bad practice, especially if the enum provides kind of a default value.

Good luck and have nice weekend!

Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4010E5FF49801@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hi,

I've same behaviour with different case :
I want to filter a layer (Oracle/Postgis) after performing join with tabular data (Excel, MSSQL tested).
First Filtering by Layer properties Ui is disabled (greyed button)
Filtering possible by Menu "Layer"-"Filter"
Joined fields appears, and Sample values do so.
But when I want to test filter I got an error message box: (sorry in French)

"Une erreur a ?t? rencontr?e lors de l'ex?cution de la requ?te.
Le prestataire de donn? a dit :
ORA-00904: "V_SIG_SITE_Site_Nature" : identificateur non valide
Impossible d'ex?cuter cette d?claration ?

Message a bit different with Postgis layer :

"Une erreur a ?t? rencontr?e lors de l'ex?cution de la requ?te.

Le prestataire de donn? a dit :

ERROR: column "maires_ZPENS_ville" does not exist

LINE 1: SELECT * FROM "riv"."bdca_commune" WHERE "maires_ZPENS_ville...

^
"
Is It possible that a simple action like that is missing?

Thanks

Sylvain

The filtering of a layer is done at the provider level, where nothing is
known about the joined fields (they only exist QGIS side).

I've submitted a patch (1) to fix the UI issues: we will be able to
filter on layers with joined fields, but only on fields of the primary
table.
If you need to filter on joined fields, I am working on a "virtual
layer" provider where you could use any SQL joins. A small function
would allow to convert a layer with joins to a virtual layer and apply
filtering on it.
More on this next week, hopefully ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis 2.6 python API - remove legend row from a
	subgroup
Message-ID: <54E76478.6030500@openocean.fr>

Hello,

(QGis version 2.6)
I am trying to delete some legend rows with the python API. I works fine 
for the Subgroups but I can't remove the rows inside a Subgroup (the 
Symbols).

This is the legend in the generated .png file, I want to remove the row 
"Less than 50.0".


In my python script (I only have 1 column so the column index is always 0):
/legend = qgs.core.QgsComposerLegend(composer)/
/subgroup = legend.modelV2().index(0, 0) # Grabs my first subgroup in 
the legend, "Bathymetry [m]"//
//legend.modelV2().removeRow(0) # Removes the first subgroup, returns 
True (works)/

Now, I want to remove the first symbol of my second subgroup, 
"Population density [people/km?]" - the first symbol label is "Less than 
50.0"
First, I grab the QModelIndex of the row I want to delete, to verify 
it's the good one.
This time, I didn't remove the "Bathymetry [m]" subgroup from the 
legend, so I access the "Population density" subgroup with the row index 1.
/subgroup = legend.modelV2().index(1, 0)//
//print subgroup.data() # "Population density [people/km?]"//
//symbol = subgroup.child(0, 0)//
//print symbol.data() # "Less than 50.0" => this is the one I want to 
delete/

I tried several methods to remove it, none worked...
/legend.modelV2().removeRow(0, symbol.parent()) # Returns False (doesn't 
work//)
//legend.modelV2().removeRow(0, subgroup) # Returns False (doesn't work/)
Same with /removeRows(0, 1, symbol.parent())/...
I also tried to remove other rows from this subgroup, and it never worked.

Am I doing something wrong ? Do you have a hint on how I should proceed 
to remove this ?

Thank you,

This works for me with both a fresh 2.8.0 via OSGeo4W with MetaSearch
0.3.2 default (i.e. not fetched from plugins.qgis.org) as well as a
fresh 2.8.0 via OSGeo4W with fetching the plugin from
plugins.qgis.org.  I'm able to work with the UNEP server at
http://metadata.grid.unep.ch:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw as well as
http://services.grid.unep.ch:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw , tested via
English and Italian locale.  Are these the servers you are working
with?

How would gcc (we usually build with -Wall) or any lint (we use cppcheck and
coverity) catch that there is a new input enum values to handle if there is a
default case?

In the current code the compiler would warn about it, while in the proposed
version it wouldn't have and new enum values that might need handling might be
introduced unnoticed.  In what way would the latter generally be "better
practice"?

I also wonder how a unit test to cover this could look like.

Looking at current status I would say some items could have some love.
Writers and Screendumpers please go wild and help us to have a good
changelog for 2.8 :-)

http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.8/

(which is actually)

http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.8/

When the most items look nice (or when somebody starts yelling 'ready'),
I'll migrate them to the website.

So please add and refine items.

Regards,

Richard

Hi all

We have finished our edits to the visual changelog, the working copy is
here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.8/

Please note that you should not blog / tweet / link to this URL yet,
Richard will move it onto the main QGIS.org web site from where it can be
translated and where it is statically rendered.

Before I give Richard the green light to do that, I would like to mention
that at a recent PSC meeting we agreed to allow feature funders and
developers to be included in an acknowledgement in the changelog. Thus I
would request anyone who funded or developed a feature listed in the change
log to please submit to me a change request by email (tim at kartoza.com) with
the following specific format:

For funders:

**This features was funded by:** [name of your organisation](
http://website/of/your/organisation)

For developers:

**This feature was developed by:** John Doe, Polly Gone, Sim Boll


Finally, if there is a key feature that you think should be on the list, at
the above web site, please let me know and I will endeavour to add it over
the weekend. Please provide clear details about what the new feature does
etc.

Many thanks

Tim

The  "Map rotation in canvas" item mentions you need to explicitly
enable it, but I think Jurgen made it enabled by default, is that
not the case anymore ?

?OK rereading it, the current text is fine - it makes it clear that the
feature will not be enabled if you do not check the feature in settings and
does not relate to whether it is enabled by default or not.

Tim?

 a blocker / reason for immediate patch and 2.8.1.

Hi Luca

aLayer.rollBack() stops the editing and rejects the changes. There is also
aLayer.commitChanges() that stops the editing and saves all changes -
that's probably what you were looking for.

Cheers
Martin

Message-ID: <CAJNPY8NEVLS2c3azwp3k9Ac1O3VM_=Rdzj6vW4xsSY_iYe9qRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I am newbie with qgis web client.I installed it on Ubuntu.
I am trying to enable php serach. This is steps what I do:
*****************************************************************************
1. In GlobalOptions.js I put this:

var project_map = *Ext.urlDecode(window.location.search.substring(1)).map;
  var searchBoxQueryURL = '../php/search.php?map=' + project_map;
  var searchBoxGetGeomURL = '../php/search_geom.php?map=' + project_map;*


2. In /php/config.php file I put this:

  *#define('MAP_PATH_REWRITE', '/var/www/webclient/projects/ProjectParcel');
  // Append .qgs to the map name
  #define('MAP_PATH_APPEND_QGS', true);*



*  $searchlayers_config = array(
         'Parcel' => array(              'search_column' => 'number'
      )
  );*
  *  define('DEFAULT_SEARCH_LAYERS', 'Parcel');
  define('SEARCH_LIMIT', 100);*


*****************************************************

Now when I try to search I get the following in browser inspect:

xt-all-debug-w-comments.js:39775 GET
http://localhost/parcels/webclient/php/search.php?map=/var/www/webclient/projects/ProjectParcel.qgs&searchtables=&query=75&cb=stcCallback1001


Where I am made mistake?

Hi,

I had problems installing QGIS 2.8 in a clean Lubuntu 14.04 installation,
following
http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#via-ubuntugis
instructions.

Message-ID: <DUB130-W31687F3FF4443389B9AC3FB5280@phx.gbl>

Hello everybody,

I'm just starting to learn pyQGIS and I'm looking for some suggestions about this branch of code:

https://github.com/ander2712/xander/blob/master/UploadInDB

I think there must be one or more errors, because it doesn't work... 

Is anybody able to help me, somehow?

Thank you in any case.

Bye

Hi,
Has a decision been made on this subject? Will 2.8 be released with this
bug? Or will skip to 2.8.1 with this bug fixed?

Filipe,

2.8 has been realeased already.

+1 to 2.8.1. But maybe it is better to wait a few more days to see if any
more serious errors appears, and then release 2.8.1.


Best regards,
Pedro

In that case:

+1 to 2.8.1 . Too bad no one noticed it before release. I made a bunch of
maps a few days ago and missed it...

Unfortunately the problem was introduced very close to the release. At this
moment it is already fixed in the code of both 2.8 and master, so if you
compile with the current code, you will have everything ok.

It is indeed a very serious.

I know that packaging takes a lot of time and effort, but I wonder if it
wouldn't be better to "cancel" 2.8 and jump to 2.8.1. since the bug was
already fixed.

This was obviously very unfortunate, but I fear that many people will be
extremely annoyed to find this problem in a new release.

If 2.8.1 is not feasible right away, I would suggest a big warning about
this.

Cheers

Just to fill everyone in, here's how this bug snuck in to release
(I've been offline and am just catching up with developments):

A couple of days before 2.8 release I merged a pull request which
fixed a number of instances were dialog parents were not correctly set
for print composer windows. If you're not aware of how Qt works,
setting the parent window for a dialog allows Qt to correctly position
the dialog in front of the parent window, preventing issues were a
dialog may appear on the wrong monitor for multi-screen setups. It's
the correct thing to do, so it looked like a very harmless and
beneficial PR to merge pre-release. Quick testing showed that the
change did fix issues with dialog window placement, but unfortunately
I didn't test that the dialog behaviour was altered by the change...

... however... making this change meant we got hit with a Qt bug [1]
which causes font dialogs with a parent window set to effectively
discard their results. Arghh! The worst part is that J?rgen had
actually fixed this issue 3 years ago - I should have checked the git
history on the effected files to see if there was an explicit reason
the parent wasn't correctly set for these dialogs.

So, my apologies for the hassle this has caused, and for the extra
work it's made for all involved (sorry J?rgen!)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS and GRASS 7.0.0
Message-ID: <CAMCJChtnphaBRncNkuxSOaoZWGjDc0Vs3ry_uGoP==n3c3Etig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

GRASS 7.0.0 stable has just been announced by GRASS team [0], and now
arises a question.

QGIS GRASS plugin (qgis-plugin-grass) still depends on the 6.4.4, so it
will no longer be available for those who upgrade to GRASS 7.0.0.

GRASS 6.4 in Processing has 168 algorithms, GRASS 7 has 153, are a few
less, but it will be easier to solve.

So how can the issue of GRASS plugin be overcome with the GRASS 7?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Ola Pedro,
this will require a reasonable amount of work. I have raised the issue
several times; sadly it seems nobody is willing to invest the necessary
resources on this.
BTW, would you mind giving us a list of the missing modules in
Processing? AFAIK these should be only obsolete and useless ones, but if
there is some genuinely missing we should be able to fix this rather easily.
Thanks.

Hi Tom,
checked again, on a fresh install (2.8 on Debian Sid).
I think I found the problem: editing the connection shows that the URL
is empty. Adding the address you mention fixes it.
Unclear why the default server URL it is empty, however.
All the best, and thanks.

This seems to be a perpetually unresolved bug. Had this same issue
upgrading to 2.6 on ubuntu systems. I'm not sure what needs to change in
the Debian control file to do this right.

Checking git is one thing (I'm not blaming you for not doing this for
every change...), but maybe also add a comment about this above the line
of code, as more and more people are hacking or trying to clean up in
QGIS, and this knowledge should be IN the code instead of heads and githubs?

I'd like to update the QGIS server documentation (tolerance parameters 
for GetFeatureInfo). What is the right place to do so? In the 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation repo, I can't find anything 
related to the server.

Thanks,

Hi Marco,

I also wanted to add some Python Plugin related stuff.

I kindly as the documentation people to create the skeleton to hold
server docs in the main QGIS documentation.

Hi all,

not sure if this is correct place, but there is a section in QGIS User
Guide about QGIS Server [0]. For developer-related stuff maybe it
is better to create chapter in PyQGIS CookBook.

Hi Paulo,
Surely this can be "enforced" by having requirements for acceptance on the official plugin repository. If a plugin doesn't fulfil all the requirements, it doesn't get included.

Possible requirements (to give an idea):
- Brief description of plugin,
- Detailed explanation of plugin.
- "How to use" documentation.
- Useful, consistent tags.
- Homepage/tracker/repository links (that work and go somewhere relevant).
- Author
- Changelog
- Date of last plugin release
- Supported QGIS Versions

This may (will) mean fewer plugins, however the plugins that don't get included would be ones with poor user documentation. Most plugins fail quite badly at making it clear what they do, let alone how to use them. That lot wouldn't take much more than half an hour to do for any given plugin (with only a few very-complex exceptions) and would make plugins much more useable.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Yes, the About is often neglected. I invite plugin authors to add a reasonable description, but I cannot enforce this.
A very good idea would be for the user to write a short note and add it to a feature request, through the plugin bugtracker; even better, this could be added as a Pull Request on the plugin repository.
All the best, and thanks.

Solved. It must be called on QgsCompomerHtml instead of (a child)
QgsComposerFrame.

Hi Paolo: I was able to reproduce this.  In loading the default CSW
connections, if a CSW server name contains '/', this causes issue in the
saved settings/registry values.  I've since fixed this in master, 2.6
and 2.8 branch.

Having said this, we should add a check to prevent users adding new CSW
connection names containing a '/'.  Filed in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12239

I upgraded ubuntu 14.04 to qgis 2.8 yesterday from 2.6. I ended up with 
the python-qgis at 2.8 - but (i have no clue if this is right or wrong) 
I have several other libraries still at 2.6 like libqgispython and a few 
others.

Thank's Hugo

Will the patch be include in next release (2.8.1)? And what about the "small function" to convert layer to virtual layer?

By the way, I've found a workaround:
1 begin first by filtering the "wanna be" joined table
2 perform join
3 Display only needed features by setting NoSymbol to other features in a rule-rendering style...

The filtering of a layer is done at the provider level, where nothing is known about the joined fields (they only exist QGIS side).

I've submitted a patch (1) to fix the UI issues: we will be able to filter on layers with joined fields, but only on fields of the primary table.
If you need to filter on joined fields, I am working on a "virtual layer" provider where you could use any SQL joins. A small function would allow to convert a layer with joins to a virtual layer and apply filtering on it.
More on this next week, hopefully ...

Thanks Tom. Will this be included in 2.8.1?
All the best.

In my experience Paulo has been doing  good job of encouraging developers
to do just that.

If we want to formalize it further it might be a good idea to set the
requirements lower for experimental plugins as it happens to be a helpful
means of facilitating testing plugins on different platforms.

Hi,

speaking as the Plugin's repository developer, I would say that
implementing different validation rules for experimental/stable
plugins would require some not trivial refactoring.

But if is there anybody out there willing to help, why not?

The code is here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/tree/master/qgis-app/plugins

and the validator:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/validator.py#L19

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyqgis add postgres table
Message-ID: <CAKse614tFygwpNr_KK5MVXWuWmHKarbru+JtLh+aZ9+gpJxzLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I can't add non geometry tables from postgres with pyqgis, this is my code

    uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
    uri.setConnection(bd_host, bd_port, bd_db, bd_user, bd_pass)
    uri.setDataSource('public', 'persones', '', '', 'id')
    taula = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), 'persones', 'postgres')
    print taula.isValid()


What is the problem?


Thanks

I think the patch could be included in the next release without harm. It
is not strictly speaking a (critical) bug fix, however.
So, if a core commiter reads this: what's your opinion ?

The virtual layer and conversion function are still under development as
a separate plugin and are still to be discussed in order to be integrated.

> My two cents...I understand the validation requirements. But I think the fundamental problem is those plugin authors who submit a plugin for X and then describe it thusly: "This is a plugin for X" where X is the same name as the plugin. The problem is that this one word or very brief phrase isn't very clear. X may be called Y in another field. There may be several methods to do X (or Y) so the user doesn't really know what's being computed and how. X may do something in one field but may also be an undiscovered solution to a problem in another field so just saying "This is a plugin for X" just doesn't say much useful stuff.

"Description" is already a required metadata field, of course we have
not an AI in place to determine the meaningfulness of the description.

This is the list of required metadata fields:

'name', 'description', 'version', 'qgisMinimumVersion', 'author', 'email'


Note: I'm always speaking about the official plugins repository.

the grass 7 command list in qgis processing should be uptodate.

Ol? Paolo,

Despite the great advantages of GRASS commands in Processing, I think that
the GRASS plugin still plays an important role and is an excellent
interface for GRASS. For those who still like to use the paradigm of
locations, mapsets and the GRASS topological model, GRASS plugin is very
important, because then it allows to use all QGIS tools, for example, to
create layouts using the Composer, etc.

If no one is interested in making the port of the plugin for GRASS 7, we
could try through a crowdfounding initiative. Who was behind the initial
creation of GRASS plugin?

I've been checking the differences and they are indeed few. Please see the
spreadsheet attached.

Some commands seem that were adaptations of other algorithms, made for
Processing, as they are not in the 6 manual, or in the 7:
r.cost.full.raster, r.drain.coordinate, r.terraflow.short,
v.surf.rst.cvdev.line, v.surf.rst.line, v.transform.pointsfile.

Others seem that have been removed from GRASS 7 (r.average, r.bilinear,
r.bitpattern, r.surf.idw2), as they are not in the GRASS 7 manual.

There are five that seem important to me, which are in GRASS 7, in
Processing GRASS 6, but not in Processing GRASS 7: r.out.xyz, r.ros,
r.spread, r.univar, v.kernel.

Finally, there are two commands that are on GRASS 7 and were not in 6:
r.viewshed (which replace r.los) and r.relief (which replace
r.shaded.relief).


Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Agreed. Moreover, the overhead of importing/exporting data for each step
of a complex analysis puts GRASS algs to a disadvantage for Processing
users.
BTW, I'm unsure about the G7 support in the Browser: could someone check
thoroughly?

Yes, I have been talking about that. Radim did most of the work on the
plugin. If he (or eventually others) are available, a crowdfounding
initiative could be appropriate.

Yes, these are adaptations of the original commands, in order to make
them more usable from QGIS.

Overall, I think these are minor issues. If someone really miss them,
they can ask, and we can add them.

All the best, and thanks again.

Hi GRASS plugin users ;-)

+1 Pedro

GRASS plugin is definitely the most convenient way to access GRASS functionalities?
With plugin you have GRASS embedded in QGIS, you get the best of both worlds

Ol? Paolo,

this will require a reasonable amount of work. I have raised the issue
several times; sadly it seems nobody is willing to invest the necessary
resources on this.

Despite the great advantages of GRASS commands in Processing, I think that the GRASS plugin still plays an important role and is an excellent interface for GRASS. For those who still like to use the paradigm of locations, mapsets and the GRASS topological model, GRASS plugin is very important, because then it allows to use all QGIS tools, for example, to create layouts using the Composer, etc.

If no one is interested in making the port of the plugin for GRASS 7, we could try through a crowdfounding initiative. Who was behind the initial creation of GRASS plugin?



BTW, would you mind giving us a list of the missing modules in
Processing? AFAIK these should be only obsolete and useless ones, but if
there is some genuinely missing we should be able to fix this rather easily.


I've been checking the differences and they are indeed few. Please see the spreadsheet attached.

Some commands seem that were adaptations of other algorithms, made for Processing, as they are not in the 6 manual, or in the 7: r.cost.full.raster, r.drain.coordinate, r.terraflow.short, v.surf.rst.cvdev.line, v.surf.rst.line, v.transform.pointsfile.

Others seem that have been removed from GRASS 7 (r.average, r.bilinear, r.bitpattern, r.surf.idw2), as they are not in the GRASS 7 manual.

There are five that seem important to me, which are in GRASS 7, in Processing GRASS 6, but not in Processing GRASS 7: r.out.xyz, r.ros, r.spread, r.univar, v.kernel.

Finally, there are two commands that are on GRASS 7 and were not in 6: r.viewshed (which replace r.los) and r.relief (which replace r.shaded.relief).

Thanks!
Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Merci Pierre. Unfortunately, +1 is not enough here: we need someone to
either coding, or sponsoring a developer.

All the best.

Ol? todos,

I'am already preparing crowdfunding campaign for GRASS plugin upgrade.
It will include:

- qgisgrasslib upgrade to GRASS 7
- single build with both GRASS 6 and 7 (GRASS version chosen by
environmental variables on start up)
- move plugin browser functionality to standard QGIS browser (meta
info widget, delete and rename action)
- implement raster and vector import via browser drag and drop
(including reprojection)
- new/open/close location tools upgrade to GRASS 7
- region editor upgrade to GRASS 7
- upgrade GRASS shell to the last qtermwidget
- modules GUI - my idea is to throw away the qgm and qgc definitions
and auto generate GUI for modules with all options based on
--interface-description only, also the list of modules would be auto
generated for all modules. The reason is my impression that there are
no volunteers willing to maintain qgm and qgc. If there are volunteers
to do that (no programming, xml editing only) let me know and I'll
include keeping of current system in the proposal.
- vector editing overall upgrade and enhancement more integrated with
standard QGIS tools
    - standard editing tools (e.g. node tool)
    - snapping to other layers
    - undo/redo
    - attribute forms
    - possibility to change topological symbology  via standard style dialog
    - standard rendering of not edited layers based on edited map
(i.e. draw filled polygons on background during editing)

I am currently coding proof of concept for vector editing to be sure
that it is feasible at all. I hope to launch the campaign in about 2-3
weeks.

IMHO having the possibility of making simplified modules is a bi plus,
and would better not be missed.

Thanks again.

Dear all,
I'm describing the new simply feature tool in the user manual 2.8.
Martin Dobias mentioned the possibility to save the simplify settings
in settings. I know that there are severel possibilities to save QGIS
settings in files. For the readers of the user manual I think it's
sufficient to describe that the settings are stored in the *.qgs-file.
Am I barking up the wrong tree with this?

Thanks!

Kind regards,

The overhead is not necessarily needed in case of raster maps:

#### Workflow example:
# register GeoTIFF file in GRASS GIS database (no import but direct link):
r.external input=tempmap1.tif output=modis_celsius

# define output directory for files resulting from GRASS calculation:
# i.e. GRASS GIS writes directly a GeoTIFF file here, no GRASS DB storage
r.external.out directory=$HOME/gisoutput/ format="GTiff"

# perform calculation (here: extract pixels > 20 deg C) and
# write output directly as GeoTIFF:
r.mapcalc "warm.tif = if(modis_celsius > 20.0, modis_celsius, null() )"

# cease GDAL output connection and turn back to write GRASS raster files:
r.external.out -r

# use the result elsewhere
qgis $HOME/gisoutput/warm.tif
#### END Workflow example:

This approach could be used in "Processing" as well. Or in a WPS context
etc.

Yes, it would be great to get the plugin updated as well.

Update to GRASS GIS 7 should not be a lot of work, see below.

>> Others seem that have been removed from GRASS 7 (r.average, r.bilinear,
>> r.bitpattern, r.surf.idw2), as they are not in the GRASS 7 manual.

It is all documented in the release notes:

http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Grass7/NewFeatures#Replacedandremovedmodules
[...]
raster:
- r.average: merged into G7:r.statistics, G7:r.stats.zonal,
G7:r.stats.quantile
- r.bilinear: merged into G7:r.resamp.interp
- r.bitpattern: G7:r.mapcalc (&&& and | | | operators) + G7:i.modis.qa
offer the same and more functionality
[...]
- r.surf.idw2: moved to Addons (install with G7:g.extension)
- r.terraflow.short (merged into FP version G7:r.terraflow is sufficient)
[...]

I updated "Processing" accordingly, so you can see the needed changes
from the changelog.

Message-ID: <54EC63B4.2050402@globalclimateforum.org>

Hi,

I guess this is not a bug but some problem with external libraries. In 
my qgis (using Ubuntu 14.10) and have the problem since a few weeks. I 
don't know when it started exactly,but I guess it was some update.

Whenever I look at the attribute table or at the attribute dialog for a 
shape, the attribute names are shown as _1,_2,_3, ... In the attributes, 
Strings are generally displayed as "NULL". Numbers are fine.

Since the Problem occurs, I have reinstalled qgis several times and also 
tried out several versions (2.2,2.6,2.8) but nothing changed.

In the message window, I found one warning by python:

warning:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/uiparser.py:890:

Hi all.
I'm finding several annoying issue with the new measurement dialog
(Debian Sig, Gnome 3, QGIS 2.8):
* the tool is always in the foreground, covering all others (also from

* when clicking on Help, the help window stays in the background
* more seriously, the tool fails to detect the measure unit and all

Any suggestion?

The window for the creation of new memory layers appears wrong: ic can

Should I open a ticket?
Also, when adding an element the attribute popup appears, but since
field cannot be added during creation, the window is useless and

Other ticket?

can somebody help me with load  a dxf file  as a vector layer?

Is QgsDataSourceURI an option? I tried with this code, but I haven't been
lucky.

fitxer="/tmp/prova.dxf"
uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setDatabase(fitxer)
uri.setDataSource('', 'entities', None, "OGR_GEOMETRY='POINT'",

I wouldn't consider that one a bug. The default is for contextual
WMS legend to be off (it's not a standard call). Eventually you
might want a per-server default configuration, but would be
an enhancement.

sorry, I do not see your point: if an user chooses to display the legend
for a server, it is more than likely that he will expect further
connections to that server will remember his choice.
but OK, it can be an enhancement.

I would even argue that such option should not exist. Most users will
probably not understand its meaning. If necessary, such option should be in
WMS server configuration dialog, not in the main WMS dialog. Anyway I think
QGIS should try to figure it out itself whether the server supports
contextual legend.

Contextual legend is a non-standard feature, not sure how QGIS could
rely on capability info to figure out. Moreover the user might want
it enabled only for some of the layers. The per-layer option was explicitly
requested by the funding party (Regione Toscana).

So I would see a per-server option to determine a per-layer default
(overridable) and eventually an "autodetect" choice for that option in
case there's a likely-to-work way to do that.

Hi,

see also GRASS GIS (+QGIS?) GSoC 2015 idea for further discussion on that
topic:

Hi Radim,

it would be good if you can include GRASS Addons, too. There is a lot of
requests for installing/running GRASS Addons from QGIS, e.g. at
gis.stackexchange.com.

Also, there are some files in GRASS GIS which might be quite useful [1].
toolboxes.xml [2] contains GRASS GIS modules sorted into different
tooboxes. They are currently not part of the official API but it is just a
matter of declaring them as part of API I guess [3]. GRASS wxGUI is using
these files to create a menu and module tree in Search module tab. It is
also a way to customize wxGUI [4] but that's not related to QGIS use case.

Loading Addons dynamically to menu or module tree including their
descriptions seems to be a bit challenging but if nothing else wxGUI can
always run a module installed using g.extension (or custom user script) if
it can run and give --interface-description.

Best,
Vaclav

Nyall, could be this fix backported to release_2_8 branch ?

I am trying to build release_2_8 on Ubuntu 14.04 and I am failing with
exactly same symptoms. What is the ID of commit where this problem was
fixed ?

Randal,

The SRID represents the srs_id field in srs.db database, not the
AuthorityID.

For example, if you query in srs.db

select * from tbl_srs
where srs_id = 222

you will see that this is your EPSG: 2240

"srs_id", "description", "projection_acronym", "ellipsoid_acronym",
"parameters", "srid", "auth_name", "auth_id", "is_geo", "deprecated",
"noupdate"
"222", "NAD83 / Georgia West (ftUS)", "tmerc", "GRS80", "+proj=tmerc
+lat_0=30 +lon_0=-84.16666666666667 +k=0.9999 +x_0=699999.9998983998 +y_0=0
+ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs", "2240", "EPSG",
"2240", "0", "0", "0"


So, I think this is a bug and the problem is the exchange of yMin by xMax.

Pedro Ven?ncio

Hi Nyall,

Which spin boxes are you testing with?

I was trying directly in the attribute table cells. I got the idea that it
worked directly in the cells, when I saw the changelog on the other day. At
this time it is not active to confirm:
http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.8/

But am I wrong?


Thanks Nyall!

I'm not sure - I've never tried it in the attribute table. Try in a
symbology dialog or in a composer item properties panel and see if it works
OK...

Hi,

I compiled 2.8 last Sunday, on Xubuntu 12.04, and I came across the same
problem.

I solved with this tip.

I have completely missed option WITH_QWTPOLAR, so I have tried to set
it to OFF and will see what it happens.

I think I set both (WITH_QWTPOLAR and WITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR) to ON, but
I'm not sure.

Thanks all for your help. When setting WITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF build went fine.

Hi,
strk, and Paolo.

I can confirm our goal was to have a per-layer option.
Because not all the layers in a wms service are good to have a
contextual legend.

Actually the more layer don't need a contextual legend.
Only few layer with really many layer are this need.

Of course the proebl of a per-layer configuration is to have a web
client capable to do a non standard call.
Meanwhile a per-server configuration will work with every client.
This is why we fund also the capability of qgis to set the wms
provider to do a contextual-client call.

With a per-server configuration this will not need.

But another question about why we prefer a per-client configuration is
that this is the same configuration used by mapserver in it contextual
legend.
nfact we originally use the contextual legend in mapserver and after
see how good it was on some layer we decided to fund to have the same
contextual legend call in qgis-server.

This is a good question fo interoperability to have the same request
in more then one wms server.
This kind of request is surely not standard for ogc but is the same
for mapserver and for qgis-server.
This mean that a wms provider client that can call the contextual
legend on mapserver can call also on qgis-server.

Instead If qgis-server was working with a different kind of request
for contextual legend, it will be incompatibile and this mean that
every client that support the mapserver contextual call don't
conseguentially support the qgis-server contextual call.


The theird question is that a per-client configuration will allow t
have the full legend and also the contextual legend.
Instead aper-server configuration will allow to have always only one
of both legends.

This mean a lesser useful usage. Because not always is useful to have
the contextual legend (also on a lyar with many domains).

Regards,

Andrea.

I just fixed both the issues.
The first one was due to the lack of some translation string and the
second one I mistakenly swapped xmax with ymin of the bookmark extent
(as reported by Pedro, thanks).

also this has been fixed.

I see what's happening here - I suspect that your field is set to use
a "text edit" edit widget rather than a "range" widget (check the
layer properties->fields tab). QGIS only uses spin boxes for the edit
widget if it's set to a range widget, otherwise they are just standard
text boxes which don't accept expressions (yet -- I'll try and tackle
that at some stage).

You are right Nyall, with the range widget, operations work both in the
attribute table cells and in forms fields!

See some discussion in https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10775 . However, I
think the form *should* be suppressed in this case, which
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1925 implements.

Thoughts?

I confirm this on Xubuntu 12.04 (Xfce desktop environment) and Lubuntu
14.04 (LXDE desktop environment), but not on Windows (OSGeo4W).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MetaSearch 0.3.3 released
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.11.1502241935120.12183@www.localdomain>


The MetaSearch team announces the release of MetaSearch 0.3.3.

This is the initial release of MetaSearch directly from the
QGIS codebase and as a result is considerably smaller in size given
dependencies and internationalization are leveraged from QGIS and no
longer bundled with the plugin.  The result is a leaner and more stable
plugin and user experience.

The plugin can be found on the QGIS Plugins Repository at
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MetaSearch

MetaSearch is a QGIS plugin to interact with metadata catalogue services (CSW).

Version 0.3.3 (2015-02-24)
--------------------------

- safeguard CSW connection names with '/'
- fix help link URL opening
- general fixes to support releasing from QGIS core

Testers and developers are welcome.

The MetaSearch team.

The toolboxes.xml looks interesting, fortunately we have already

Message-ID: <CAJvUf_uwbNG_i+Hn_d_BLeU-_SE7Hr0Qdqeib6wg6kc1sYtPig@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Dear list,
I opened a ticket a while ago (https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12010) about a
bug in editing 3D postGIS layer with QGIS.

Strangely enough editing is fine (Z is put to 0, which is OK),
but trying to create a geometry raise an error  "Column has Z dimension but
geometry does not"

The only workaround I found was to create a trigger on the vector table
that forces the input to 3D
(ST_Force3D(geom)).
It is however ugly and not good performance wise.

Somebody has a better idea?

Cheers,
R?mi-C

If I'm coming from 2.6 and take _no_ action (don't go to settings at all),
do I get map rotation enabled or not ? I think I do.

If I do (enabled by default) then also the NEWS file should be updated
as it currently says:

  - Rotation of map canvas (disabled by default, activate in settings) is now supported.

Dear list,

I didn't find a report on this bug so I'd like to post it here:

Using QGIS 2.8 on Ubuntu from the ubuntugis-unstable repository zooming 
out using the magnifying glass doesen't work. This is only like this 
when drawing a box, not when issuing a single click.

Since I found the problem on all machines I was using I guess it's a bug.

Cheers, Falko

?Correct. I added "(it wil be enabled by default)" as below - to make it
more obvious.


 "This release includes preliminary support for rotation in the map canvas.
You need to explicitly enable this in Settings --> Options --> General -->
Experimental canvase rotation support(it will be enabled by default). Note
that you need to restart QGIS before this feature is enabled. We also
recommend that you start a new project for cases where you wish to rotate
the map canvas. Rotation support has been extended into the map composer
too so that it correctly handles labelling and symbology, etc."?
??

?I still think we should just remove the option from settings - how many
users to yo?u think will actually go and disable it and on what basis will
they make the decisions to do so? If you dont want rotation simply leave it
on zero in the status bar? Anyway sorry I don't mean to make it sound like
I am on some kind of crusade :-P If you want different wording to the
above, just supply me what you prefer and I will update it ok?

Why not just trimming out the whole Settings explanation ?

 This release includes preliminary support for rotation in the map canvas.
 Rotation support has been extended into the map composer too so that
 it correctly handles labelling and symbology, etc.

I've also removed the "start new project" as I don't understand why
you would recommend that.

?I updated so it now reads like this:

# <http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.8/#231> Feature: Map
rotation in canvas, improved rotation in composer

This release includes preliminary support for rotation in the map canvas.
You can rotate the canvas using the new rotation widget in the status bar.
Rotation support has been extended into the map composer too so that it
correctly handles labelling and symbology, etc.

This feature was funded by: Georepublic Japan <http://georepublic.co.jp/>
This feature was developed by: Faunalia <http://www.faunalia.eu/>

?I based that on your recommendation on IRC when I mentioned my labels were
not showing when rotating an existing project (created with an older
version of QGIS).

Hello everybody,

I've already ask some help with "Creating script (conflict with 
python/Grass + wrong folders)" but noone was able to help me, so I try 
again with a simplier question:

When I launch my python script in Grass (in the Virtual Machine 
everything works fine) this happens:
C:\PROGRA~1\QGISBR~1\bin\python.exe: can't open file
....: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

All the problems started when I upgrade my QGIS to 2.6 (with Grass 6.4.4 
even if I can see only Grass 6.4.3...).

Thanks for the help

That was not a recommendation for a user, but for a bug hunter :)

I'd consider it a bad bug if that's something that happens with any
pre-existing project, one that should be fixed by 2.8.1.
Can you reproduce ?
If so, could you please file a ticket, tagged with "rotation" ?

For basic list you can just use `g.extension -a` [1]. wxGUI is using more
complex approach implemented in UpdateGRASSAddOnCommands function [2]. One
reason for higher complexity is handling calls of Python scripts on MS
Windows (which would use some code review).

Sandro,

Don't stress. These things can happen now and then.  There where other
things that happened that needed to be fixed for a 2.8.1 release anyway so
it wasn't just your fix.

Hi Paolo,

seems it can not create memory raster and as result
can not assign projection to invalid datasource.

Maybe input vector layer with zones contains some
invalid polygons or some polygons are really small
(less than one raster pixel).

But anyway all these cases should be handled by
algorithm. Can you can provide sample dataset?

Hi Paolo,

as I can see this is not a but, rather feature. Output of this
algorithm is a directory not single layer. And while this
specific algorithm creates directory with shapefiles other
may create directory with text files which can not be loaded
in QGIS.

Maybe we should improve OutputDirectory by adding new
flag, something like "canLoad" and load directory contents
if this flag set.

BTW, same algorithm from fTools also does not load results.

Hi,

I have spent some time on the globe plugin about a year ago. I managed
to compile against osgEarth 2.5 at that time and even could use some of
the features (vertical exaggeration to name an interesting one). I never
got around to merge this back.
You may give this branch a try.

Cheers

But I can login with psql and using pgadmin3. 

CREATE ROLE testuser LOGIN

If I create another user as SUPERUSER I can login without problems. What
could be the reason for this?

Otto,

Some tips:

Check testuser can access to the public schema and geometry_column, 
geography_column.

Something like:
GRANT ALL TO SCHEMA public to public;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO public;

public role is a specific role which contains all user.

Y.

Message-ID: <1760452695.7865761425050430566.JavaMail.httpd@webmail-46.iol.local>

Hi all,
I'm writing a plugin and i would like to get the first (starting point) vertex of a line vector feature  during editing.
The steps are:
1) enable a line vector to be editable
2)click on add feature button
3)When i click on mapcanvas to draw my first point, i would like to get the point and convert it into mapcoordinate

The scope of it is to add a feature (point feature - starting point) to a test point layer so i can 'Autosnap' my drawing feature to the starting point.
Anyone can help me?

Thanks

Francesco

Victor, I've been thinking of this problem overnight and thought
that maybe it could be fixed by having QGIS use UPDATE..RETURNING
to update the associated key.

Actually, the same approach could be used for keys that are
subject to change due to triggers.

If you file a ticket for the problem it will be easier to deal with
it, or did you already ?

And return it where?   In the current vector provider interface only
::addFeatures gets QgsFeature (and already updates their id), but
changeAttributeValues and changeGeometryValues only get attributes or geometry
along with the original feature id.

Sorry, I hadn't looked at the actual code, was just an idea.
Didn't know there was support for auto-updating IDs already (great!).

In any case the reported behavior does sound like a bug to me, so
I still think it should get a ticket, don't you ?

ciao,
i heve just updated to 2.8.1 but it seems that problem still exists.

it seems it is not possible to change the style of fonts (bold, italics) in
the column header of tables inserted into composer.

is this only a problem of mine?

s.

I confirm here, also in master.

This only occurs in "Table heading" font. With "Table contents" everything
seems ok.

I will reopen the ticket.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible regression with QGIS v2.8.1 with rasters
	rotated/skew via worldfile
Message-ID: <CA+XueT1biPDdZhBmRJ6oxm1RAQ20q=x84Au3vbiLwgFA4BjD3A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm seeing a potential regression with QGIS v2.8.1 on under Xubuntu v14.10

I'm loading some .PNGs that have .wld files associated with them.  Ones
that have rotation/skew values other than 0 are no longer displaying where
they had been working fine under v2.6.1.  Rasters that have 0 rotation/skew
values show up fine and are georeferenced properly

I tried toggling off the experimental canvas rotation option but that
didn't help

I can send the raster and world files if it will help any troubleshooting.

Thanks,
  Jesse

You likely hit http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12264 / 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f106a2ef999224f1f1b7f214d08b039749d6111b

Has been fixed in master, but not backported yet in 2.8 branch AFAICS

Possible workaround if you're stuck. Use output of "gdalwarp your.png out.tif" 
or "gdalwarp your.png out.vrt -of VRT"

Well, ctid is not a reliable key.   The ctid will also change if something else
modifies the row.   Maybe postgis layers without any key should be readonly.
That would also help with Victor's problem, but probably not in a desired way
;)

derivate or use directly an instance of:

http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapToolEmitPoint.html

every mapTool has methods to convert pixel coordinates in map (OTF) or
layer coordinates.

or

if you want to piggyback qgis editing, attach the editing signal of
the QgsVectorLayer or that of the QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer.

avoid using editing with dataProvider otherwise no event will be emitted.

I got contacted by a student yesterday asking whether 2.8 was out. He knew

Would be good to update website ASAP.

Mathieu,

2.8.0 had been available for some hours, but had flaws/bugs.
2.8.1 is (almost) packaged, but we miss some changelog parts which we
want to have in place for the official launch

All (except visual changelog) in website is ready to be switched.

When it is ready the Release Manager (J?rgen) will tell us (do NOT
listen to the eager bloggers which tell you otherwise), and we will
rebuild the website immediately.

plz bear with us..

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

we have shutdown hub.qgis.org because the server which it is served from
get's a new disk (raid) and hopefully less IO will speed up the build of
that disk.

As soon as the disk is rebuild we will bring back hub too.

Hi, 
well pgadmin sets table view in readonly mode if no Primary Key is defined..
That is more than a good practice from a DBA point of view, I wouldn't be
against such a constraint for tables. We should raise some user warning when
connecting to PG, so that users don't get confuzed 
Another point, what about views that do not have PK (but may be editable) ? 
Cheers
R?gis

Dear all,
I would like to know if there is a tutorial or text that explains how to
write a plugin for the processing toolbox. The QGis documentation explains
how to write a plugin but I didn't find anything about the processing
toolbox... So I would like to know the structure and the code necessary to
add some script to the toolbox.
 All the best

?Hi Sergio,

If you just want to add a simple script to the Processing toolbox, you
don't need a plugin at all. All you need to do is go to Scripts | Tools |
Create new script in the toolbox. You can find many examples of how these
scripts have to look like in the following repository:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing/tree/master/scripts

Best wishes
Anita

Thank you Victor and Anita,
maybe my message was not so clear. Yes I know how to write a simple script,
but I would like to transform it in a plugin.
The simple script, for that I know, does not allow to insert a combobox
while in some plugin like LECOS there is one.
It is difficult for me reading the plugin code and understand which part is
for a normal plugin and which one for the processing toolbox, if you have
any suggestion please let me know.

Best

Sergio

Message-ID: <BLU437-SMTP5377E24A25137E071719BBA7120@phx.gbl>

Hi Giovanni and all devs,
sorry for bothering again but, within the last 2weeks, I'm still 
experiencing minidumps.
As suggested months ago (with 2.6--> solved), I tried to uninstall 
plugins in a progressive way but, this time, it's not simple to 
understand what can cause the crash due to the fact that it appears just 
sometimes in different situations (mainly quick zoom in&out, or while 
loading sth). I don't know if it can be related to the multiple 
processor rendering.
The project has: around 20 shapefile, Bing OpenLayer (mostly switched 
off) and around 50 tiff maps (mostly switched off).
Probably similar to THIS ISSUE <https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12077>.
Am I the only one?

I'm working on W8.1 64bit and QGIS 2.6.1 from Osgeo 64bit.

Thank you all!

all the best,

Niccol?

you can add a combo box in a script, using "selection" as data type,
followed by the possible values separated by semicolons

For instance

method=selection First method;Another method;The last method

Hope this helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mixing GPL-2 & GPL-3 code in QGIS (official Debian
 package rejected by FTP master)
Message-ID: <54F20723.7040806@xs4all.nl>

Hi all,

After 4 releases and a significant update of the debian/copyright file,
the Debian FTP masters have reviewed the qgis package and unfortunately
rejected it due to incompatibly licensed code.

I've included the FTP master response below, and it's also available in
the list archive:

http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-grass-devel/2015-February/027884.html

The dxf2shp_converter plugin contains code under GPL-2 (v2 only), GPL-2+
(v2 or later), MIT, LGPL-2+ and commercial licenses. This is documented
in the debian/copyright file as follows:


Files: src/plugins/dxf2shp_converter/builder.cpp
 src/plugins/dxf2shp_converter/builder.h
Copyright: 1999, Frank Warmerdam <warmerda at pobox.com>
Comment: The code is heavily based on Christopher Michaelis' DXF to
 Shapefile Converter (http://www.wanderingidea.com/content/view/12/25/),
 released under GPL License
 .
 This code is based on two other products:
    DXFLIB (http://www.ribbonsoft.com/dxflib.html)
 This is a library for reading DXF files, also GPL.
    SHAPELIB (http://shapelib.maptools.org/)
 Used for the Shapefile functionality.

The GPL-2 (v2 only) files are problematic because their license prevents
the upgrade to the GPL-3+ license used for libpal:


Files: src/core/pal/*

The use of the GPL instead of LGPL by libpal is unfortunate, because the
GPL doesn't have the link exceptions. The use libpal in QGIS makes the
combination fall under the GPL-3+ which GPL-2+ license for QGIS allows,
but the GPL-2 licensed work do not.

See the GPL license compatibility matrix for an overview of the effects
of combining works under various GPL licenses:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility

To keep the combined work shipped in QGIS releases under the GPL-2+
license of GPL-3+ works needs to be changed. This requires all copyright
holders of the work to consent with the GPL-2+ license for their
contributions.


libpam is not the only problematic GPL-3+ work included in QGIS, a
couple of resources are too:


Files: resources/cpt-city-qgis-min/ds9/*
Copyright: 2010, William Joye
License: GPL-3+

Files: resources/cpt-city-qgis-min/grass/*
Copyright: 2009, GRASS Development Team
License: GPL-3+


Removing the dxf2shp_converter plugin from QGIS would get rid of the
problematic GPL-2 licensed works, but the inclusion of GPL-3+ works
still upgrades the GPL-2+ license for QGIS to GPL-3+.

Excluding the GPL-3+ resources doesn't look very problematic at first
glance, but I expect the removal of libpal to cause more breakage.


Besides the GPL-2/GPL-3 issue, one of the resources also has problematic
license terms:


Files: resources/cpt-city-qgis-min/es/*
Copyright: 2008, ElvenSword (http://elvensword.deviantart.com/)
Comment: Credit requested for use, required for distribution
License: ElvenSword
 For use:
 .
 * Using for commercial works, prints:
 Yes. There is no need ask permission first, or after.
 My resources are free for personal or commercial arts works. Credit is
 enough if possible, if there is a description. Note link to me not
 necessary. But it is good, I can not see them otherwise, feel free
 about it.
 .
 * Using in only DA:
 I submit them only DA yes, but you may use out of DA.
 .
 For distribute:
 .
 * I like sharing. So okay distributing my resources with credit,
 for good, for free. But,
 .
 * Do not distribute my resource files without original preview.
 ('cause previews including credit. Credit is important point on
 this situation.)
 .
 * Do not remove my name on it (preview). I saw some Turkish and
 Russian forum sites delete artists names though, and they puting
 their own cursed crappy logos on the previews. It is not sharing.
 It is ...
 .
 * Do not create collection with new preview, claiming open or close
 they're your own creations.
 .
 * Do not Rip/Merge with other artists work. Example: All in one
 gradients by Merger/Ripper Nickname) for download/sell
 .
 * Thanks


The "Do not Rip/Merge" clause may prevent inclusion in QGIS if the
cpt-city collection is considered an "All in one gradients ... for
download".

Since the README.txt included in cpt-city clearly states that copyright
is held by the respective authors, the clause does not seem to apply.
The gradients collection is not claimed to be by a different author.

If the FTP masters cannot be persuaded of this view, excluding the es
gradient doesn't look very problematic either.

What does the QGIS development community think about the issues raised
by the Debian FTP masters and ways to resolve them?

Kind Regards,

Bas

I didn't know the selection data type, this is cool, thanks Victor!

and thanks Alexander, the example provider is really useful

?It would be great if the selection input type could be documented in
http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing/console.html#creating-scripts-and-running-them-from-the-toolbox

for the 2.8 documentation?.

Thanks and best wishes,

The GPL-2 code in dxf2shp can be removed.  And the dxf2shp lib can be upgraded
to 3.7.5 that is licensed under GPL-2+.   The getInsertions code is trivial and
AFAICT the handling is wrong anyway - the content of a block is only inserted
once at the location of the first insert instead of repeatedly on every
location of the inserts.   It's probably better to handle inserts similar to
the texts.

After that there's not GPL-2 only code in QGIS, right?

Would that be a problem?  In that case Debian is free to redistribute.

That would kill labeling.

Looks like there are more with non-free license and also stuff
that is GPL-2 only.  I suppose we can remove all of those too.

That's right, the dxf2shp converter plugin is the only one with GPL-2
licensed files.

I've updated the Debian packaging to exclude the dxf2shp converter
plugin from the upstream tarball, and patched the build to not install
the library. That should address this issue on the Debian side for the
time being.

Upgrading the library to the current version in which the license
issue is resolved sounds much better on the longer term.

It's not a problem with the DFSG, but it may not be the intention or
desire of the QGIS developers.

Enough reason to keep it, or search for a GPL-2+ replacement if the
upgrade to GPL-3+ is considered problematic.

The only other issue I found with the resources is that it seems
resources/cpt-city-qgis-min/nd/COPYING.xml does not correspond to the
CC-BY-SA-3.0 license stated on the DeviantArt page (and d/copyright).

Kind Regards,

The only dependency pulling in the python-qgis package is the Recommends
by the qgis package. Because there is no version requirement the package
is not forced to update when a new version is available in the archive,
although this is usually what happens. Recommends is not as strict a
dependency as Depends is, it allows to keep a package at the version as
installed if it allows the upgrade of other packages explicitly depended
upon.

It probably makes sense to move the python-qgis Recommends to Depends
and add a strict version requirement on the same binary version as is
done for qgis-providers too. See the attached patch for example.

Kind Regards,

Bas
