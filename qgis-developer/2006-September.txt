I know this may not be proper place to ask this question but i am stuck here
with this run time error.

qgis: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/qgis/libqgis_plugin_va.so: undefined
symbol: _ZN12vARubberBandC1EP12QgsMapCanvas

This code belong to a plugin whch i have written. Here  vARubberBand (
similar to of QgsRubberBand)  inherits from QgsMapCanvasItem, and main
plugin class vA do it from QgsMaptool. vA class has a objct of type
vARubberBand.

Also similar error appeared when i ported my wel working code from one
machine to other machine.
I have tried a few methods like declaring vARubberBand in a namespace to
avoid redeclaration but no fruit.
please guide me out of here.

i had figured out because of what error is thee but i dont know the answer.
It slike that i am declaring a new class and proving implementation of it
separate file. Whenever i want to create object of this type i am getting
this error. If i comment out object creation everything falls in place. I
think i have to mention somewhere this file , maybe in some config file or
makefile but i am unable to find out.
I am looking for guidance here. Above statement is an observation through
trail and error method.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lines are invisible in GRASS plugin
Message-ID: <20060901165221.GA28352@rigacci.org>

I'm investigating a strange problem, the same QGIS-GRASS plugin 
behave differently on three different machines.

On two machines no problems (just some crashes), on the third 
machine:

I add a GRASS vector layer (lines), the layer is correctly 
displayed.

When I start the Edit GRASS vector layer, the window pops-up, but 
the lines disappear. Also the nodes are invisible.

The plugin is functional: I can add a line and I see the gray 
line untill I close it, then it becomes invisible. When I close 
the Edit plugin, the GRASS layer become visible again and 
contains the new line too.

One more thing: if the GRASS layer is above another layer (say a 
GPX), when I start the Edit plugin, the lines appears just where 
they intersect objects in the under layer.

I include two snapshots (Grass layer is red, GPX is gray):

- Normal:  http://paros.rigacci.org/tmp/qgis-no-edit.jpg
- Editing: http://paros.rigacci.org/tmp/qgis-grass-edit.jpg
 

In what direction can I investigate? QT? X-Window? ...?

- I start QGIS standalone, not within the GRASS shell.
- All the machines are Debian Testing lined up at the same day.
- The QGIS is a build from SVN, made on 2006-08-31.
- If I open the GRASS mapset inside GRASS 6.2beta1 (the one used to 
  compile my QGIS) the v.digit works as expected.
- I tried to increase the line width and change the color into
  the plugin: nope. The rendering of lines is broken.

Can you see the lines if you have a polygon from another layer on the
background?
Depends somehow on colors?
Strange in any case.

Message-ID: <200609021717.51519.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis developers,

In the last days, I did commit a wfs provider/ plugin to svn and I saw in the 
logs that this has lead to some confusion.

For the university project I'm working on, I had to write a minimal wfs client 
capable of doing getCapabilities and getFeature. It is written as pure 
plugin/provider and should not disturb the rest of qgis (besides the build 
process, sorry Gavin). That's the reason I commited it to svn instead of 
making another branch. I thought that I would get more feedback and 
bugreports from other developers/ power users like this. Of course wfs client 
should not be part of 0.8 as it is too unstable.

The current situation is that wfs plugin/provider are in svn but do not get 
built without hacking plugins/Makefile.am and providers/Makefile.am. What do 
other developers think about this? Should wfs be out of svn tree? It would 
also be possible for me to store the sources of wfs plugin/provider on a 
university svn server until after release.

Thanks for your feedback,
Marco

A poligon layer below does not help. The plugin starts, the 
screen is redrawn and the GRASS layer disappears!

I tried all the possible colors combination, nope!

> Strange in any case.

Yes. Fortunatelly it seems to affects only my home workstation. I 
installed my qgis package on several Debian Testing boxes: all 
worked well.

I will try a new fresh Debian install, then a diff -r ...

Hi,
nice to here this. We will also need WFS support for our project.

Yes, it must not be in 0.8.

I think that it can be left in HEAD and 0.8.0 source code if it does
not compile by default.

Hi

I agree its fine (good even!) to keep it in svn if building it is
disabled for the release.

Dear qgis developers,

As you probably know, I'm having a QGIS plugin writer workshop on the FOSS4GEO 
conference next week (hoping that a lot of people will write cool plugins for 
qgis after the conference :-) ).

Now that I prepare this workshop I would like to know if there is a 
possibility to store project specific information of plugins (in the project 
file) and are there already existing plugins using such a mechanism?


Thanks,
Marco

Yes, GRASS plugin stores current GISDBASE, LOCATION
and MAPSET and it is reopened with project.

BTW, I am writing a new plugin and I have 2 problems:
1) How to change it to standalone plugin with its own configure and
    make system.
2) How to make a distribution package for Windows and how to
    automaticaly update the plugin when it is installed.

They can ask you the same.

Radim,

I haven't looked at the dataset in question, but there was a bug at one point
in the IDRISI driver related to missing nodata values.  Perhaps Ivan will
try the dataset, and indicate if there is still a problem.

QGIS should be able to call GetNoDataValue() safely without any sort of
pre-test.   If it causes a crash in GDAL then it is a bug that should
be fixed in GDAL.

Best regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ms_export.py : some modifications and questions

Hello QGIS folks,

  [ I sent this to the old qgis-dev list as well so apologies if you
receive a duplicate... ]

  This weekend, I began looking at the ms_export.py script for
converting .qgs projects to mapserver map files. I would love to see
an almost 1:1 conversion of qgis constructs into a mapfile so I started
to make a few modifications/hacks to the script:

- support for postgis, raster and wms layers
- some additional mapfile metadata for automatically creating wms servers
- very basic support for labelling
- support for graduated symbol classification
- a few other minor tweaks.

I've attached the ms_export.py script along with some screenshots
showing the qgis project then the mapserver rendered version without
any manual tweaking to the mapfile. There's still alot of room for
improvement ... if folks find this line of work helpful, i'm more than
willing to continue working on this.

Please give it a shot and let me know how it works for you.

On to the questions....  I'm a bit confused as to how the ms_export.py
script is meant to interact with qgis.   It appears as if svn build as
of last week still uses the c++ version of the mapfile exporter and
there are calls to the python script as well as the c++ methods in
qgsmapserverexport.cpp. Is this still in transition or is ms_export.py
only meant to be a standalone tool?

Thanks,

After a fresh Debian install, I isolated the problem: there is 
something wrong in the "nv" Xorg driver.

If I cange in /etc/X11/xorg.conf the line 
  Driver "nv"
with
  Driver "vesa"
then QGIS works as expected.

I'm using the free Xorg Nvidia driver, I'm not interested in the 
closed one.

Unfortunately my knowledge stops here, no workaround as far I 
know.

  xserver-xorg             7.0.22
  xserver-xorg-video-nv    1.0.1.5-2
  xserver-xorg-video-vesa  1.0.1.3-2

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac QCursor Not Working
Message-ID: <44FCE9EE.3080605@comcast.net>

Hello Mac users,

Does anyone who has built QGIS with Qt4 on a Mac see custom cursors for 
Identify, ZoomIn and ZoomOut? I see the default arrow cursor whenever 
QGIS tries to use a cursor based upon a XPM QPixmap.

I submitted a bug to Trolltech and they responded that it works for 
them. They sent me the example that works for them and it doesn't work 
for me.

The next step is to figure out if the bug is specific to my hardware 
configuration or is somehow related to how I build Qt. Thus, I'd like to 
know if anyone building QGIS on a Mac is seeing custom cursors where I 
am not. I do see the Pan hand but that is created as a QBitmap rather 
than a QPixmap.

Thanks for any info,
Tom

The Identify and Zoom in/out cursors work for me with Qt-4.1.4

I haven't rebuilt qgis in a while (I was thinking about it this  
weekend).  SVN 7/29 + Qt 4.1.4 - my cursors are all OK (including ID  
and Zoom in/out), both on PPC and Intel Mac 10.4.7.

I have Qt config'd with -release -universal -system-zlib -qt-sql- 
sqlite -qt-sql-psql -qt-sql-mysql -qt-gif, if that helps.

I downloaded QGIS-0.8-CVS060729.dmg from kyngchaos.com and the default 
arrow cursor still appears for me instead of the XPM cursors such as 
Identify, ZoomIn and ZoomOut.

Perhaps it has something to do with using an older Mac - I have a 
Sawtooth/AGP G4. The custom cursors work with Qt3, stopped working in 
4.0 and still don't work in 4.2.

Does my qgis-0.8.0pre1.dmg from qgis.org display custom cursors for others?

Since this bug isn't affecting everyone, it's probably not something to 
address next. However I was concerned that no one was seeing QGIS custom 
cursors on a Mac.

Good post on your blog! I think it will really help people who are
looking into qgis for the first time.

Also, I have a comment. If one wants to use qgis libraries after
having installed qgis, I would rather suggest beginning the
application with:

  QgsApplication app(argc, argv, TRUE);

Rather than:

  QApplication app(argc, argv);

Because QgsApplication, once instanciated, gives you access to the
plugin path. So instead of doing this:

  QString myPluginsDir = "/home/timlinux/apps/lib/qgis";
  QgsProviderRegistry::instance(myPluginsDir);

You can actually do it more simply like this:

  QgsProviderRegistry::instance(QgsApplication::pluginPath());


Anyway, good job!

Another fix is to disable hardware acceleration in Xorg:

I have the cursors with your build.

I don't know about that old Mac - it should support OSX just like any  
other G4.  Maybe there is a graphics card issue (slow/features)?  Or  
maybe it's the OS - are you running Panther or Tiger on it?  If Qt is  
tapping into the system for some graphic formats, Panther might not  
support XPM images correctly.  Quicktime?


PS. this isn't your main Mac is it?  I had to drop back to an 867 MHz  
PB (I already passed my faster PB on to someone else at work) while  
my MacBook is in the shop, and running heavy-duty stuff like graphics  
apps and Xcode builds is painful.  I'm spoiled. ^_^

All with GDAL 1.3.2.

Hi

Ah well spotted! That will probably make the 'cant find srs.db

Thanks

Hi devs,
Should we think about releasing a release candidate this weekend? I  
know there are still some bug but its been a while since the last  
preview. Might be nice for Marco to mention it as he travels the  
conference.

I'm looking for opinions from both developers and PSC members.

Thanks,

Definitely good idea to have RC1 for FOSS4G.
Can you make binary for Windows + GRASS?

Just a question,
why did you choose GPL when you started the project, then ?

Yes gets my vote too - would be very good to have something up to date
for FOSS4G

Hi

This is just my guess (since I wasnt there at the beginning) but....
QGIS has morphed a lot since the beginning. The first version was a
simple postgis browser with no plugins, no ideas to sepate into
libraries that could be used to build other apps etc. In the scenario
where your application is self contained the GPL probably makes more
sense. When plugins and library reuse starts to come into play LGPL
probably makes more sense.

One thing I dont understand though: Isnt the Linux kernel releases
under GPL? If so how do NVidia etc get away with making proprietry
kernel modules?

Regards

Tim

I'm also in favour of releasing RC to show that current version of
QGIS is now nearly ready for the final release.

Good point. It's all very muddy. This article suggests that binary
kernel modules are tolerated, but perhaps not explicitly allowed by
the GPL.

I support licensing QGIS under the LGPL. Hopefully it's not too late
to make a change.

Its not too late as long as we can get all the code contributors to agree.
Are we sure that LGPL covers everything or should we consider another
license as long as we are talking about change?

Hi,

I'm an infrequent contributor to QGIS but I hope you don't mind
I'll donate this brainstorm with my 5 cents.

I'm not a lawyer, though I belive that if there are any questions
and doubts about coexistence of GPL licensed QGIS with external
commercial / proprietary / closed source additional components
like QGIS plugins, then it's definitely worth to take it under
consideration as soon as possible.

The first question I'd ask is what does the QGIS business model is
supposed to look like? Is this only about providing possibility to
develop and load proprietary / closed source plugins or may be something
more.

This is only a question I see as important and interesting to ask at
the beginning of licensing discussion, but I'm even not going to
aspire to answer it.

There are many Open Source licensing models friendly to proprietary
components. For example, Frank Warmerdam explains [1] MIT/X license as a
"business friendly" license. I also know LGPL (see Shapelib or SQLite
projects) as another one.

[1]
<http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=44>

In my opinion, there is yet another interesting licensing model that was
developed with respect to requirements of
open source / closed source /commercial / proprietary [2]
software development, and which does not forbid such any of these usage
cases.

[2] this is a list of "possible combinations", have I mentioned
I'm not a lawyer? :-)

The license I have in mind is Boost Software License.
I believe it may be interesting, at least to read about it and
its history.

General info and history of Boost Software License:

http://www.boost.org/more/license_info.html

The most interesting parts for our discussion is small
comparative analysis of Boost Software License with GPL and LGPL:

Here the Boost license is shortly compared with GPL
(see question "How is the Boost license different from the GNU
General Public License (GPL)?"):

http://www.boost.org/more/license_info.html#FAQ

Here, Boost license is compared to LGPL:

http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?Boost_License/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License_-_LGPL

Here is a wiki page with great list of comparisons of Boost license
with other Open Source licenses:

http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?Boost_License

It's a really great job and IMHO it greatly helps to clarify all this
lawyers tongue to something more plain.

Shortly, Boost license seems to me as an interesting and premeditated
license. Also, it seems to be modern and respective to new conditions,
for example:

"the Boost license is not "viral": if you distribute your own code along
with some Boost code, the Boost license applies only to the Boost code
(and modified versions thereof);"


Yet another of my thoughts is that it may be helpful to take some
consultion (see http://www.boost.org/more/license_info.html#History and
Bekerman Center). May be OSGeo could help QGIS with this consultancy
support, lawyers etc.
Just an idea.

Cheers

I believe that it is important to allow distribution of proprietary
extensions (plugins)
for any desktop GIS. I am not sure if realy everything should be LGPL/MIT,
probably not. The best IMO whould be to allow only proprietary plugins and
data providers. That way we can be sure we get all the improvement for
the base application back in free version.

But, I don't believe it is possible! Qt free edition is GPL and if you use
the free edition of Qt you must release your application as GPL. You cannot use
a library developped with Qt free edition in a proprietary application
built with Qt commercial edition!
It is the Qt licence for commercial version which does not allow to use
QGIS libs in proprietary applications, not the license of QGIS.

While searching on the net about this issue, i found a guys that explain me 
this issue with Qt. This is the answer:

"you'll need to grant an exception in your license to allow proprietary 
plugins and the developers of the proprietary plugins will need to purchase a 
license from Trolltech to link against the Qt libraries; you should also 
specify that closed source plugins developed for your application will 
require a license from trolltech"

> Qt free edition is GPL and if you use, the free edition of Qt you must 
release your application as GPL.

It seem that you need to use GPL compatibility license, and according to this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_licenses#GPL_2_compatible

Hope this help

This is exactly what is not allowed, I think. They simply forget
to look at the Qt licence for commercial edition.

Trolltech: "Please note that it is necessary to choose either the Open
Source or Commercial license at the outset of development. Trolltech's
commercial license
terms do not allow you to start developing proprietary software using the
Open Source edition."

Regardless it was Trolltech's intention or not, if somebody takes QGIS library
which was developed with Qt OS edition and builds a proprietary application
using commercial edition it is violation of the commercial lincense.

Again, it has nothing to do with the license of QGIS, important is that
QGIS was developed using OS edition.

Hi devs,

these days I'm back in QGIS development and I'd like to get
Lib_Refactoring-branch back to sync with SVN head so after releasing
0.8 it could be merged immediately as it has many improvements in
architecture and now it's hard to maintain it separately.

Some time ago I've read about CMake build system and that KDE
developers have switched from autotools to it for KDE4. I've tried it
a bit and it looks very promising. This is a good reading for those
who don't know anything about it:
[1] http://lwn.net/Articles/188693/
[2] http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6700

On page [1] you can find pros and cons of this system and advantages
that developers of Scribus project see in it. It should suit our needs
well as it has good support for different platforms and also it's
really easy to use in comparison with autotools. I've already managed
to compile with it QGIS core library on linux.

What are your opinions about such switch for the next version of QGIS?
I could try to prepare the build system in the refactoring branch to
see if it works well.

Martin

Hi Martin,

I submitted a few minor fixes to thie branch some weeks ago.

I started to like cmake, it's easier to write makefiles
and Visual C++/KDevelop workspaces generation sounds promising.
However, I still does not have any idea how to achieve something
like dynamic configuration similar to ./configure scripts.
IMHO, cmake is still under development and I'm not sure if it's
very mature.

I'd also like to hear more cmake pros and cons.

BTW, recently one of GEOS user posted cmake for GEOS.
I tunned it a bit and, as I said, I started to like cmake ;-)
http://geos.refractions.net/pipermail/geos-devel/2006-September/thread.html

Also, we (SOCI library dev team) are going to add cmake building
support to SOCI library, so after that I hope I'll be able to tell
more about cmake in practice (near the middle of October).

Cheers

Hi Mateusz,

I've seen them, thanks!

The best pros are that CMake's files are much easy to read and write
than those autoconf macros, configuration takes much less time,
generated makefiles are smaller, has graphical  configuration (resp.
curses for unixes), Qt4 is supported out of the box. Also the choice
to use it for next KDE means that it's quite mature and will be well
supported in future.

I see cons just in the need of learning a new language and that so far
not many people are used to it.

Indeed, simplicity is one of cmake's advantage.
I'd add one more, that in comparison to autotools builds,
cmake makes it extremely simple to keep all build configuration,
build files out of the source tree.
For example

project/src - includes poor .h and .cpp files
project/build - includes CMakeLists.txt + all generated stuff
like Makefiles etc.

I like clean source trees and cmake help to keep them as such :-)

Another advantage is that creating new macros, m4 and autoconf
equivalents, is very simple.

Right.

It should be, see "How to write a FindFoo.cmake module"

Hi

Personally I dont see why we cant have multiple make systems in svn  
assuming they dont conflict with each other....

If people feel strongly about having CMake (or in my case Id prefer  
qmake) whats the harm? We should have a standard make system that we  
use for official build instructions etc and in my mind thats where  
the real debate lies. Even then we could provide multiple  
instructions. If one make system begins to stand out from the others  
perhaps it will become default just from user uptake.....




Regards

Tim

Yes, it should work.

I don't see any harm.

Right.
Regarding QGIS, IMHO the most important advantage of cmake is
native workspaces support.
On Unix cmake generates Makefile files or KDevelop project.
On Windows cmake generates Visual C++ solution and project files.
So, I see the latter is cmake's advantage over autotools/automake.

Can you try to compile with MinGW crosscompiler? Windows is the most important
platform for us (see downloads).

Yes, but we cannot ask developers to learn and make always changes
and _test_ all the make systems. That means those secondary
make systems will permanently fail to compile as people modify
the primary one.

Looks like there is a consensus that we should get a release  
candidate out before the conference. I'll work on the windows build  
with the latest Qt (unless someone else wants to do it).

We won't tag the release until we're sure it's going to work on the 3  
major platforms...

I agree -- Radim points out the reality of multiple build systems  
unless there is a champion for each that keeps it up to date with  
potentially each commit.

I'm not opposed to cmake, assuming we are sure it meets our needs.  
The fact that KDE 4 is using it probably means something.

I'll add this topic to our "post-0.8" TODO for the PSC.

Radim,

cmake generates Visual C++ 2005 solution and project files for all
subprojects (modules/libraries/etc.) of the project.
It uses Visual C++ 2005 to build programs on Windows.
In other words, QGIS may be compiled with cmake using Visual C++ 2005
Express Edition, free of charge.

I'm not sure if cmake supports cross compilation.
Here is one of latest post about this subject:

Hi,

I think it's good to get a Windows release out; there are a few bugs
(about 3) in the tracker that could be closed if we could prove they're
now OK in Windows.

I wouldn't necessarily call it a Release Candidate though, perhaps a
preview 2?

I saved a project with a GRASS layer, but I cannot find these elements in the 
project file. Do I need to use the GRASS plugin in a different way that these 
elements are saved? The project file is attached below.

I don't see the problem here. You need to check for the qgis libraries 
(libqgis_gui, libqgis_core, ....), the qgis headers, the libraries qgis 
depends on and for the location of the plugins. Otherwise a normal autotool 
system.

Unfortunately I don't know much about windows (I don't even use it). Maybe one 
of the windows gurus may answer?

cheers,
Marco

The external plugins have their own svn tree http://svn.qgis.org/trac/ 
browser/trunk/external_plugins and the plugin builder script there  
was (up to qgi 0.7.4) able to generate a standalone plugin. However I  
have not maintained it since I was having double the work to maintain  
very similar code both in qgis/src/plugins and in external_plugins. I  
decided it will be much timpler to add some options to the  
plugin_builder script in the main qgis trunk to allow the user to  
select whether to make the plugin part of the main qgis build system  
or a standalone build job. I have yet to do the latter....


2) How to make a distribution package for Windows and how to
    automaticaly update the plugin when it is installed.

Most likely we could modify the main qgis nsis script to set an env  
variable on the host system like QGIS_HOME or something. Then when  
you NSIS  write the installer script for your own plugin you can  
install it into the QGIS_HOME/lib/qgis or what have you...

You must open a mapset first.

But how do you get all the dependencies of QGIS libs,
for example postgres, geos, proj?

Cross-compilation is not supported for now, but you can always compile
it directly in windows. Recently I've tried to make it compile there,
however most of the time I fight with linking problems with
dependencies when using both MinGW and MSVC++ 2005 compilers (I lack
some experience at this). I would prefer to compile it with MSVC++ as
it's more 'natural' for win32 and you can also use its IDE for some
programming.

Hi

I posted another article this time on using maptools with  
qgsmapcanvas. It includes a qmake based project you can get from svn  
and build. Maybe it would be a good basis for one of the foss4g  
workshops?

http://blog.qgis.org/?q=node/14

Marco et all is there any other ways we can help?

Isn't it possible to get them the same way as autotools do for QGIS? Not very 
convenient for plugin writers though.

Thanks a lot Tim. The preparations for the workshops are already done. I will 
mention the maptools example in the presentation about the QGIS WMS server, 
because the approach of creating a new application with the QGIS libraries 
has some similarities.

In general, the program of the foss4g conference is very interesting. I will 
post a summary of what happened and workshop/ presentation feedback to the 
qgis-developer and -user list for those who are not able to attend the 
conference. 


cheers,
Marco

We should probably add --dep-libs option to qgis-config?

Hi All

Gary is a bit tied up at the moment and asked me to play cat herder  
for Preview 2 Release. So I'd like (unless there are strong  
objections) to tag the release tomorrow (tuesday 12 september) at  
24h00 GMT. Once I have tagged SVN I will be looking for volunteers to  
create binaries for the release preview.

I will try to get ubuntu dapper debs built.


Tom are you available to make the mac universal binaries?

Steve is the debian stuff in a state where you could generate debian  
packages?

Gary will create another win binary using the chroot.

If anyone else can create packages for their preferred os / distro  
that would be great.

I will make the source tarball available tomorrow after tagging. I  
will send out a follow up email once svn is tagged along with  
checkout instructions.

Many thanks

Regards

Yes. Once the release tarball is available I'll create .debs and
upload to the debian-gis repo.

Hi to all!
I'am going to prepare an ebuild for Gentoo.. Is the option
--with-qt-pkg-config still available in autoconfig script?

Thanks

Yes it's still there but it's commented out so you will need to patch
acinclude.in to make it work.

Thanks Martin, patching acinclude.m4 worked fine...
Just waiting for the official sourcecode.

If Tom can't get to the Mac build, I could take care of it.  Though  
they would have my frameworks external for dependencies (GDAL,  
PROJ, ...), instead of internal libraries.  I think Tom was  
considering or interested in using the frameworks, and they're in a  
stable state now.

unstable. stable isn't possible because last I checked there are no
qt4 packages for it.

Hi

Just to let everyone know that 0.8 preview 2 has been tagged in svn.  
(Sorry Gavin your r5821 just missed the cutoff - is that a problem?).

You can check out the tagged version using the following command:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/tags/Release-0_8-preview-2  
qgis-0.8prev2

I am busy uploading the source tarball now.

If you prepare a binary package please drop me a note with a url  
where I can retrieve it from and Ill put them all together on our  
server.

Id like to prepare some stats to go with the preview release  
announcement (number of bugs fixed etc) and any major snafus that  
have been repaired, so if you have anything salient I should mention  
please let me know.

Many thanks,

Regards

Great - I havent heard from Tom yet - if we dont hear from him in the  
next day or two, I would say go ahead. Will it be possible to bundle  
just the frameworks actually required to run qgis to minimise the  
download size (even if it is two downloads - 1 for the application  
bundle and one form the frameworks installer package)?

Considering that the needed frameworks for QGIS are 85MB out of 92  
(for all the frameworks I have so far), there isn't much space  
savings.  (these are uncompressed sizes)  So, the extras used by  
GRASS (often used with QGIS) and MapServer are pretty small.

I'll build QGIS with my frameworks, I probably would anyways, to make  
sure my frameworks are tuned up.  So you can grab it from my site if  
you need it.

Hi

I have uploaded a svn export tarball for the tagged preview branch to:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/qgis_Release-0_8-preview-2.tar.gz

I will make an announcement on the site tomorrow and update it as

Note if you are building binaries, please check your version of  
configure.in has the extra version set to 2 - I committed this after

You want to build the oldest possible version of qgis? Im sorry I  
dont really understand what you are trying to do. Have a look on the  
download page of http://qgis.org for details on checking out the  
stable release (which uses qt3) or the development branch (which uses  
qt4),

I hope that helps!

PS Please write via the qgis-devel mailing list since I cannot

Debian Testing (Etch) package qgis_0.8prev2-20060913_i386.deb is 
available.

I set up an apt-gettable repostitory with Qgis, Grass, Gdal and 
all the required dependencies at:

   http://debian.gfoss.it/

Please note: I'm not a skilled Debian mantainer, so take it just 
as a quick and dirty hack, waiting for official packages to go 
through Unstable and then Testing.

It works for me :-)

Any feedback will be apreciated.

You get debug messages when you configure it with option --enable-debug
e.g. ./configure --prefix=/your/path --enable-debug

Hi

Many many thanks for this. Do you have the bandwidth for us just tell
people to add your repo to their sources list?

Can you provide the full entry for sources list needed to use your repository?

Any other special instructions we should give?

Do you have a way to track download numbers?

Best regards

Tim

- No problem with bandwidth

- I collect stats, will publish as needed.

- Put this in /etc/apt/sources.list:

A bit of a problem - I see a new target added to make  
"qgssvnversion.h", which needs the 'svnversion' command.  I don't  
have subversion installed, and noone should need it for downloading  
tarballs of source (either premade, like the preview 2, or generating  
one from the svn web interface).  The last svn tarball I downloaded  
from the web interface, 2006-7-29 (after preview 1) doesn't have this  
qgssvnversion.h target.

Am I stuck without installing subversion?  Can I disable it (and  
remove it from the 2 source files I found it in)?  Or can I get a  
premade qgssvnversion.h?

Willam & Pascal,

Now there's a problem with svnversion that I didn't think about when I 
added it in! Yes, of course, we should setup the tarball so that it 
doesn't require the svnversion program. For the moment, make up a 
svnversion.h file with contents of:

#define QGSSVNVERSION "anything_here"

and also comment out the lines from ".PHONY : qgssvnversion.h" and below 
in the Makefile.am (all in the top qgis directory), and things should 
work fine. Someone (maybe me) will alter the Makefile.am so that it will 
cope without svnversion for future tarballs.

Regards

Gavin

Actually, "qgssvnversion.h".  And I decided to go ahead and do that  
already (or something with the same effect - removed qgssvnversion.h  
from BUILT_SOURCES), build is moving along nicely.  I put the date of  
the snapshot there.

thanks

One more - svnversion is used in the Mac Contents/makefile.  Just to  
make sure you remember and fix that one also.

My Mac OS X Universal QGIS is online.  Tested on Tiger PPC (MacBook  
is in for the RSS problem).  It should work on Panther, I can test  
that Friday at work.

Message-ID: <45096489.6040207@o2.pl>

Hi,

I've been receiving a following error when I quit qgis:

X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  75322
  Current serial number in output stream:  75368

Still present in current SVN head.

Is it OK or should it exit cleanly?

Hi Steve

I think someone else mentioned running into the same issue and now its
affecting me too:

install -o root -g root -m 644

dh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp
cp: cannot stat `debian/tmp//usr/bin/gridmaker': No such file or directory
dh_install: command returned error code 256
make: *** [binary-arch] Error 1

Did you encounter this problem? Do you have any ideas what is causing
it? I get it bith when using an unmodified checkout of the debian dir
(building on ubuntu edgy) and when building with my modified debian
dir for ubuntu dapper.

Thanks

Hi All

We are pleased to announce the second preview release of QGIS 0.8 is
now available. The subversion repository has been tagged and packagers
are busy creating binaries for various platforms. For those who like
to build from source, a source package is also available. Click the
following link for further details.

http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=128&Itemid=99

Packages for Windows and Ubuntu are in preparation and will be
available in the next couple of days.

Many thanks to all the people that have contributed to QGIS!

Best Regards

Having both is useful. The framework build is good for people using 
GRASS or MapServer because it minimizes disk space by using a shared set 
of libraries. My original package is good for someone who has no GIS 
apps installed and would like to try QGIS alone. There is only one item 
to copy or it can even be run directly from the disk image.

A new standalone image is at:
http:://www.compassowl.com/qgis-0.8.0pre2.dmg.gz
It has not been tested on an Intel Mac.

This shouldn't be happening, but isn't a big problem either. 
Nevertheless, are you able to pin down the error message to having 
opening a particular dialog box or something like that in qgis?

Tim,

I had this problem too when making the rpms. It is caused by the lines:

if MINGW_FALSE
bin_PROGRAMS = gridmaker
endif

 in the Makefile.am for the gridmaker and spit plugins. The if statement 
is evaluating to false in all cases, not just with mingw. The end result 
for me was that the gridmaker and spit standalong executables weren't 
installed in the bin directory, but the rpm builder was expecting them 
to be.

I commented out the if and endif lines as a temporary fix.

If I just start qgis from terminal and exit without doing anything in
qgis, then this message pops up. But if, for example, I load a
shapefile and exit then, no error is printed.

Message-ID: <ba40726a0609141507i4207b021w8d79cfebc96b16db@mail.gmail.com>

I have successfully built:

qt 4.2
gdal 1.3.2
geos 2.2.3
libproj 4.4.9

I have downloaded binairies for:

sqlite 3.3.7
postgresql 8.1.4

I have downloaded tarball of Release 0.8 Preview 2.

I have tried the procedure at
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingOnWindows without success (it
seems outdated).

How do I build?

Wich compiler do I use?

Is there a .pro file for Windows (i tried many, none works) ?

Is there a Makefile for Windows (none of these work either) ?

What are the required environnement variables?

Hi Francis

Currently the only supported build method for windows is to cross  
compile using mingw on linux. There is a chroot environment you can  
use for this purpose at:

http://download.qgis.org/mingw_chroot.tar.bz2

Yes I agree having both options is useful! Many thanks for this. I  
have uploaded it to the server and added it to the download page.

I'm also downloading it to my macbook to test it and Ill let you know  
if there are any problems.

Hi

I tested you package and it worked great...Ill test Williams next.....

Incidentally Gary and I noticed some polygon drawing issues on our  
hand compile qgis mac builds...but they seem to be resolved for me  
with your build....great stuff!....though I do wonder whats been  
causing it on our machines...

I have one concern that just occurred to me - the PROJ you include in  
your QGIS binary may have a problem as a universal binary.  The NAD  
files are processed at build time from the text NAD data to binary,  
in the endian of the build architecture.  Then when read on the other  
architecture, you will get bad NAD data.  I patched my PROJ framework  
to always assume little endian NAD data files, so it does byte- 
swapping on a PPC Mac.

If you like, I can give you the details (I need to put that patch  
info on my site one of these days).  I only have a patch for the  
reading part, not the build side, since I build on Intel (normally).


A few other things after looking at your Mac binary.

- Does QGIS need QtOpenGL?  I just dumped all the Qt frameworks in my  
binary.

- What about the Qt plugins?  How does the whole mess know where to  
find them?  I noticed you put imageformats folder (and just that)  
directly alongside bin/lib/share, while I dropped the whole Qt  
plugins folder in the QGIS app, to mirror how it is in the Qt  
installation.  Are any of the other Qt plugins needed (accessible,  
designer, sqldrivers)?

- I missed the mapserver export tool.  Looks like it needs Python  
support, and I didn't do that either.  That was something new and I  
wasn't ready to mess around trying it.  I'll take a look at it later  
(probably after I get my MacBook back, and I may just rebuild the  
whole thing on my MacBook as a test).

The same problem for me building Debian Testing packages.

I just removed the install statement from debian/qgis.install, so 
I have only the plugin version of gridmaker (which is working), 
not the standalone program.

May be I will compile again...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] all tools active - IMHO wrong
Message-ID: <450A8C78.2010507@o2.pl>

Hi,

In Qgis (any version) all the tools on the toolbar are active even when
no layer is selected. Actually they are active even if no layer is loaded.

These tools include all the digitize, identify, select, zoom, and
measure tools as well as the "Remove layer", "In overview", "Add/Remove
all to overwiev" and "Hide/Show all layers".

I think they should be all disabled (greyed out and not runable or
yielding "Select a layer" or so) when no appropriate layer is selected.

For fun I tried playing with some of them with no layer loaded and eg.
the Move vertex tool made qgis crash, which I reported to trac
https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/271

Currently no, but I think it would be good to assume that in the
future qt plugins (esp sqlite driver) will be used. Also if 3rd party
qgis plugin writers use qt plugins and want to slip them into your
package it would be good to have them available.

There is an outstanding issue with the mac version of the mapserver
export tool on mac. The export tool is a standalone app ass well and
is placed into the qgis.app as another .app bundle. When it searches
for the plugin script path it is searching inside the msexport bundle
instead of the qgis bundle. It just needs some tweaking to the
makefile to set the PKGDATAPATH or py install path correctly....but Im
no auto guru and I got a bit stumped at this point....

What about the location of the Qt plugins?


I didn't notice, but is there an external QGIS plugins folder, like  
in /Library/Application Support?  This (and a user's home/Library) is  
where any 3rd party qgis plugins should go - bad form to alter an  
installed application.

Message-ID: <450AD6A0.9010000@o2.pl>

Hi,

I noticed that changing the layer name via [Properties -> General ->
Display name] affects both the layer name displayed in the layer *and*
the layer in [Map composer] legend, while changing the layer name via
[Rename] changes the name only in the layer tree - the [Display name]
in [Properties -> General] remains unchanged and so does the layer name
[Map composer] lagend.

If this is a fetaure I think it's bad. Could this be fixed, so that any
way makes the layer name changed everywhere?

You can add search paths for qt plugns at runtime so they could be
placed into the bundle.

Ah good point. Bear in mind I am a mac neophyte :-) It should not be
hard to add some mac specific code telling it to search in the
/Library/Application Support/QGIS/ dir or whathave you.

Does the Mac QGIS do this now for the Qt plugins?  If the Qt plugins  
are included in the app package, they should be automatically  
included in the Qt plugin search path, so the user doesn't have to  
mess around with that.

That should be done at some time before a final release.  And  
probably use a subfolder in the QGIS folder, to keep things organized  
- the App Supp could also potentially be used for user addons, like  
themes, SVG graphics, etc.

Theere would be at least 2 folders to add to the QGIS plugins and  
other extras:

/Library/Application Support/QGIS
$HOME/Library/Application Support/QGIS

Another not-so-common one is a network Library folder (can't recall  
the exact path).  The user Library should be searched before the  
global Library, or, the user overrides the global.

Subfolders in both could be (mirroring what's in the QGIS app):

images/north_arrows
plugins
qt_plugins (for possible added Qt plugins needed by a 3rd party qgis  
plugin)
svg
themes

And these would have to be added to appropriate search paths  
automatically on startup.


I added a similar thing to my GDAL framework - replaced and added  
extra search paths for GDAL plugins, instead of the default  
$GDAL_PREFIX/lib/gdalplugins.  Now it looks in the framework and the  
local and user Library App Support.

Let me know the details. I built everything on a PPC Mac and don't know 
whether projections are working on an Intel processor.

The default search looks first in plugins/ within the install dir, then 
directly in the executable path and finally in $QT_PLUGIN_PATH. 
(http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qcoreapplication.html#libraryPaths)

A crash was occurring if the bundle contained Qt and then loaded plugins 
from a different version in the install dir. Since only one Qt plugin 
was needed, I replaced the full list with just the second item in 
main.cpp:374. A better solution would be to replace plugins/ in the 
install dir with plugins/ in the executable path rather than drop it.

However, I just noticed (http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qt-conf.html) that 
the built-in paths can be altered by creating Contents/Resources/qt.conf

To redirect all Qt directories, the contents should be

[Paths]
Prefix = MacOS

but this doesn't work. Instead, each directory needs to be specified:

[Paths]
Plugins = MacOS/plugins

An empty qt.conf also works if Qt is in Contents.

Should I fix the plugin path in main.cpp or remove it and use qt.conf 
instead?

To build it, just add --with-python to the configure command. The 
Makefile will use the Mac OS X python framework.

In qgshelpviewer.cpp, we're doing:

// remove bin/qgis_help.app/Contents/MacOS to get to share/qgis
qApp->applicationDirPath() + "/../../../../share/qgis" +

It's not clear from that doc how it handles the plugins subfolders  
(accessible, designer, imageformats, sqldrivers).  Are those  
predefined subfolders?  So those plugins subfolders should be  
directly in the lib search path folder, like you have it, instead of  
inside 'plugins'?  I should fix my QGIS package then.

Hm, how about this on that qt.conf doc page:

"On Mac OS X, the Prefix is relative to the Contents in the  
application bundle. For example, application.app/Contents/plugins/ is  
the default location for loading Qt plugins."

So, in main.cpp, *don't* clear the lib search path, because it's  
already defaulting to the app bundle, and in a meaningful location  
(but where neither of us put them ^_^).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Impressions from the FOSS4G2006 conference in
	Lausanne
Message-ID: <200609170813.13541.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis developers,

From 12th - 15th September, there has been the FOSS4G conference (see 
http://www.foss4g2006.org). For those of us who couldn't go there, I'd 
like to write down some of my impressions.

It was a very good conference with lots of interesting workshops and talks. 
The location at the university of Lausanne was close to the lake and with a 
beautifull view to the mountains. There have been a lot of interesting people 
to talk with from the mapserver, GRASS, PostGIS, JAVA-GIS and last but not 
least QGIS communities. Speaking to those people, I was pleased to see how 
widely known, accepted and even used QGIS is in the whole open source GIS 
community. I also heared the wish of many users that 0.8 release happens in 
not too far future.

From QGIS side, there where two workshops: a 'QGIS beginers workshop' where 
the main program features have been showed and a 'QGIS plugin writer 
workshop' where a plugin has been written in four small steps. Tim, is there 
a place on the website where I may place the material of this workshop 
(slides, code for the four steps)? The plugin itself might even be usefull, 
it takes the features of the current vectorlayer and converts them into a 
delimited text file such that every vertex becomes a point feature.

It was further impressive for me to visit the presentation about the 'udig' 
project and to see that "competitors do not sleep" (like we use to say in 
german). They seem to have most features that we have in QGIS and 
additionally a very good support for OGC services. It seemed that they also 
have a lot of human ressources for future development.

There was also information about the OSGeo foundation, what it does and how a 
project may become a member. This so-called 'incubation process' is mainly a 
project review. When reading the criterias for projects 
(https://incubator.osgeo.org/), I had the impression, that the QGIS project 
would fullfill most or even all of them.

Ok, that was it from my side. Did anyone of the QGIS folks make digital 
pictures of the conference? It would be great to see them.

Mateusz: thank you very much for the nice QGIS t-shirt!

Greetings,
Marco

Hi Marco

Thanks for the feedback - and for flying the flag for QGIS! If you
email me (or put on a ftp site somewhere) your materials I can put
them online. Alternatively you could add them to the new
http://blog.qgis.org site (just ask Gary to make you an account). The
blog site supports uploading pictures etc.

Regards

Message-ID: <20060918161849.2a497f12@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear document-writers, translators, devs,

reviewing the current SVN-Status of the QGIS-user/installation manual I
am quite impressed about the completness. Thanks for all contributions
of you!

Is there any pending documentation-work which is not in SVN yet? 
Last Commit was done by morb_au commenting ongoing processes[1]:
Rev:	184
Author:	morb_au
Last modification:	Rev 184 - 2006-07-29 07:06:35 +0100 (Sat, 29
Jul 2006) Log message:	General tidyups of 0.8 documentation -
ongoing 

Since the Preview-2 is out now I like to get the manuals off the ground
to involve the translators to idealy get a readily-translated manual for
the next stable release 0.8.0 soon!

Does any of the native-english-speaking people volunteer for
proof-reading the current english texts? I think this is needed since
(at least me) is not good in writing understandable and grammatically
correct english.

Are we ready for getting the translating maschinery to work soon or
are there any objections?

Best regards

	Stephan

Hi All

A windows package for QGIS 0.8preview2 is now available (thanks
Stephan Holl!) and I have updated the ubuntu dapper packages so they
should not give the gdal error previously reported when installing the
grass plugin.

Downloads are available from :

The QGis 0.8 Preview 2 Windows binaries compiled for Qt 4.1 libraries
also seem to work with Qt 4.2 libraries.

I replaced the 4.1 Qt*.dll with the latest 4.2 Qt*.dll and it worked
fine, although I only tested PostGIS layers.

Hi

I have made a new version of the source tarball that includes the  
svnversion header. Please try that and let me know if it works ok.

For the wms issue please log it in the bug tracker!

Thanks for the feedback

Hi

Most likely this should be possible - but as far as I know the  
headers that get included are determined by no_dist clauses in the  
Makefile.am's so if you wanted all the dev headers we'd need Steve's  
expertise.

For those interested in making ubuntu packages for yourself Ive  
forked the debian dir and you can check out a dapper friendly version  
(doesnt require debiangis repos etc) like this:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/ubuntu_dapper debian

Tim

There is a new poll up on the QGIS website that asks: "Should QGIS  
join OSGEO?". Please take a minute and give us your opinion. If you  
aren't sure what OSGEO is all about, visit the OSGEO website (http:// 
osgeo.org) and the wiki (http://wiki.osgeo.org) to learn more.

I'm sure about it.
If I may share my opinion, the OSGeo foundation is on the right way to
play a very important role(s) in the Open Source GIS and QGIS should
join it as representing user-friendly desktop GIS.
At the moment, as I see, most of OSGeo projects are dev tools and web
mapping projects.
So, QGIS would definitely find its niche there :-)

I have some, but not yet published.

There is also a big gallery on the FOSS4G webist:

You're welcome! I hope it will fit you or some other QGIS geek well :-)

ask you for committing of qgis_cs_CZ.ts [1] to SVN?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS and RGBA Geotiffs
Message-ID: <20060921192421.2312AC26B9@localhost.localdomain>


I have a utility that trims the collars of Geotiffs by translating the
indexed colormap Geotiff into an RGBA Geotiff with the Collar made
transparent via the alpha channel in the tiff.

The GIMP and other image viewers honor the alpha channel and the Geotiffs
made with this utility do in fact have transparent collars.

I'm running QGIS 0.7.4 under Ubuntu Dapper and it very nicely will load
raster Geotiffs and place them correctly based on the Geotiff coordinates --
BUT -- the collars on the Geotiffs overlay adjoining maps so the image
isn't very useful -- AND -- unfortunately, if I do the same thing
except use the RGBA transparent collar Geotiffs, QGIS doesn't honor the
alpha channel in the RGBA Geotiff so the collars still overlay the adjacent
maps.

Other image viewers seem to honor tiff RGBA alpha channels.  Is there
any hope we will see this in QGIS????

If so, the fact that QGIS overlays raster layers positioned correctly
based on Geotiff coordinates doesn't help.  If QGIS honored the RGBA
alpha channel, then one could easily join adjacent Geotiffs with QGIS
and the transparent collar utility.

Message-ID: <ba40726a0609211347t50186b44m552d5e6f1c1e0466@mail.gmail.com>

As requested, here is how I compiled Windows binaries with the mingw chroot.

See attached .txt
-------------- next part --------------
1 - Download and extract the chroot.
	
	wget mingw_chroot.tar.bz2
	tar -xjf mingw_chroot.tar.bz2

2 - Download QGis source in /home/user/win/source/qgis_head
	
	wget qgis-0.8.0-Preview-2-src.tar.gz
	tar -xjf qgis-0.8.0-Preview-2-src.tar.gz ./mingw_chroot/home/user/win/source/qgis_head
	
	You may need to remove reference to svnversion in the source code
		
		Makefile: remove svnversion something
		src/qgis.cpp remove ???svnversion.h and add #define ??SVNVERSION "something"
		src/main.cpp remove ???svnversion.h and add #define ??SVNVERSION "something"

3 - chroot
	
	sudo chroot mingw_chroot
	
2 - Create a replacement for pg_config.exe
	
	cd tmp
	vim pg_config.cpp
		
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
			if(argc > 1) {
				if(strcmp(argv[1],"--version") == 0) {
					cout << "PostgreSQL 8.1.3" << endl;
				} else if(strcmp(argv[1],"--libdir") == 0) {
					cout << "/home/user/win/source/pgsql/lib" << endl;
				} else if(strcmp(argv[1],"--includedir") == 0) {
					cout << "/home/user/win/source/pgsql/include" << endl;
				}
			} else {

	./autogen.sh --prefix=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc --target=$TARGET --host=$TARGET --build=i386-linux --with-qtdir=$WIN/qt4.1_win --with-projdir=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc --with-gdal=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc/bin/gdal-config  --with-geos=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc/bin/geos-config --with-sqlite3=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc --with-grass=$WIN/i586-mingw32msvc/grass-6.1.cvs --with-postgresql=$WIN/source/pgsql/bin
	
	/home/user/bin/winmake -f Makefile.win
	
	If some compilation error happen, you may have to manually build some sub-directories
		
		example, missing providers for a plugin:
			cd src/providers/
			/home/user/bin/winmake -f Makefile
	
	/home/user/bin/winmake -f Makefile install
	
5 - Distribute
	
	cd /home/user/win/i586-mingw32msvc/
	tar -cjf ../qgis.tar.gz *.dll *.exe grass/ lib/qgis/*.dll share/qgis/
	
	mv /home/user/win/qgis.tar.gz /some/destination

Thanks Francis,

To others on this list, I'd made the request to Frank on IRC; the intent
is to update the wiki with this fresh info over the next few days
(unless someone else gets to it first ?!)

Hi

Excellent! - we should just add the pg_config script into the chroot  
on the download page - Gary? Its really good to have the process  
documented.

Hi

We will make sure this is supported in the final 1.0 release - please  
check if its in the bug queue and if not make a note there for us so  
we dont forget about it.

Many thanks

Message-ID: <4513FAF5.8020503@o2.pl>

Hi,

I've just had a strange experience with Trac.

Reporting a bug

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/287

I set:

Milestone: 0.8

	it got 0.9

Assigned to: rblazek

	it got: gsherman

Component: grass

	it got: Build/Install

Platform: Linux

	it got: Debian

Version: HEAD

	it got: none



This is one problem. The other is that I can can see no Ubuntu slot
under Platform: though many other are there.

An yet the very last one - my fault: I forgot to put my email there -
could someone please do that for me?

Message-ID: <864A604E-AF06-4395-BEB4-B94C0DADE5CC@kyngchaos.com>

In the Mac qgis.app, is the MacOS/bin folder in the app package added  
to the shell PATH on startup?  I'm thinking of adding miscellaneous  
helper executables that a user might not have installed and want to  
make sure that they would be automatically found by QGIS.  ie:  
gpsbabel for the GPS plugin.

Or maybe plugins, or QGIS as a whole, need an option in the GUI to  
add to the executable PATH.  Being a GUI app, many users won't want  
to or know how to mess around with shell env variables.

Much worse is that a vector open in QGIS cannot be deleted.
Open file on Windows cannot be deleted nor moved.
That is very bad because it is very common to run a module
again and again and watch results on display.
I don't have any idea what could be done.

Output vector is now frozen when a module is started in GRASS tools
and thawn if finished with success. It is not perfect, does not
work from shell.

Oh - I don't need any special rights to modify a ticket. Done. Only I
can't modify the 'reported by' field. Could you do that for me?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgs->apl (ArcPad)
Message-ID: <4517D552.8010601@o2.pl>

Hi,

Does anybody know if there exists a tool for converting the shapefile
layer settings contained in a QGIS project file into an ArcPad apm file?

I'm asking this because one can't setup symbology for a shapefile layer
in the ArcPad itself. In order to do it one needs to buy another
expensive ESRI software.

But both are XML based formats and I "only" need the colors used for
lines, points and for filling polygons converted. I might try doing it
myself, but I'm not sure if it will be that easy as I might think.

I'm CCing you Mateusz because I found your note about planning for such
a tool on the QGIS WIKI:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/MateuszLoskot

Any suggestions?

Hi,

Arghh! It's still on my todo list.
Unfortunately, since 7 months I have no access to PDA + ArcPad to start
some work.

For one of my client, I created similar tool, but it's closed source :-(
So, for QGIS I'd need to create new tool.

Yes, that's right.
Or you can buy a software from one of companies I worked for ,-)
but that's not a case here.

Yes, it's preatty easy task - dump layer properties to ArcGIS XML-based
format (XML dialect).

Yes, exactly.
I have an idea of a plugin to export/import ArcGIS XML files from
ArcPad (apm/apl).

Is this something you need very fast?
The fastest option is to create a script converting QGIS project file
into ArcPad XML file. More user-friendly but more complex option is to
write QGIS plugin.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to develop any plugins in next 2-3 weeks.

Cheers

I was thinking of the of a simple bash (+awk if needed) script. I can't
do anything more than that.

I don't have the PDA at hand now to try anything either, and the darn
ArcPad evaluation won't work in wine (it installs but crashes). Maybe I
could try installing QGIS on Windows and writing the script there,
using msys to emulate bash+unix tools. Does that make any sense to you?

It should be feasible.

You can write script on Linux, then copy it on Windows machine.
Also GnuWin32 [1] tools should work.

Cool!
This could be a prototype of QGSI XML <-> ArcGIS XML processing.
If you'll have any technical problems/questions, drop me a line and I'll
try to help you.

I'm sure also a tool (either external or plugin) to convert
ArcView/ArcGIS project files (.apr) into QGIS files would be of general
interest, as it would greatly ease the migration from AV to QGIS (a soft
spot in professional settings).
All the best.

Right now it's not possible, but the matter it's not with Qgis, but with GDAL/OGR.
If you build QGis with Gdal/Ogr 1.3.2, you can delete items.

Dear Byambaa and Luca,

It is possible to edit vertices with Shapefile and PostGIS layers. With 
shapefiles, it is only possible in the newest svn developer version (not in 
preview2).

cheers,
Marco

Message-ID: <787520ee0609270722r22af2a3eof789427e8bc6dc9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

It seem that the projections parameters for the french lcc projection are wrong.
Today, all the epsg's 275xx have the following parameter :
+lon_0=-2.33722917

With the current parameters, when I import some gps points(lat-lon)
and reproj them to french's Lambert zone II, the points are shifted by
hundreds of kilometers to the east.

Maybe the param should be :
+lon_0=2.33722917
or maybe :
+lon_0=0, because +pm=paris
Well, I don't know exactly.

Here are my grass PROJ_INFO file (which is working) :
name: Lambert Conformal Conic
proj: lcc
ellps: clark80IGN
a: 6378249.2000000002
es: 0.0068034876
f: 293.4660212940
lat_0: 46.8000000000
lat_1: 45.8989188889
lat_2: 47.6960144444
lon_0: 2.3372291667
x_0: 600000.0000000000
y_0: 2200000.0000000000

Maybe is it a proj.4 problem. Here is the epsg file from proj 4.4.9 :
<27572> +proj=lcc +lat_1=46.8 +lat_0=46.8 +lon_0=-2.33722917
+k_0=0.99987742 +x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +a=6378249.2 +b=6356515
+towgs84=-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0 +pm=paris +units=m +no_defs  <>

The epsg file from proj 4.5.0b2 :
<27572> +proj=lcc +lat_1=46.8 +lat_0=46.8 +lon_0=0 +k_0=0.99987742
+x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +a=6378249.2 +b=6356515
+towgs84=-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0 +pm=paris +units=m +no_defs  <>

The proj esri file :
<27572> +proj=lcc +lat_1=46.8 +lat_0=46.8 +lon_0=2.33722917
+k_0=0.99987742 +x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +a=6378249.2 +b=6356515
+towgs84=-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0 +pm=paris +units=m +no_defs  no_defs <>

I'm not a gis guru, and I don't know exactly what to think. It could
be great if some French users could give a clue.

Thanks,

Laurent

Hi

I believe this is possible in qgis 0.8. For me these features dont  
seem to be working on my mac. I will test on linux tomorrow. I tried  
moving vertices of both point and line features without success.  
Marco or Brenden any ideas?

Tim

Hi Tim,

You need the newest SVN to change shapefile geometries.
If it does not work for you, it would be interesting to know which gdal 
version you are using. I tested with 1.2.6 and 1.3.2. It would also be good 
to know if the capability test we are using in the OgrProvider works for 
older gdal versions so that at least the add/move/delete vertex buttons are 
greyed out in these cases.

cheers,
Marco

Dear friends,

Vertices editing functionality is working with Shapefile on latest QGIS SVN

that vertices editing functionality is working on PostGIS layer too. I was
testing it on Ubuntu Dapper. Now I compiling latest QGIS source for Windows
using mingw_chroot jail. (Thanks for Tim for mingw chroot jail).

Thanks a lot for Marco, Luca and Tim for great help and advices.

Hi

Magnus Homann just raised a similar issue for Swedish projections.  
When we created the srs.db the idea was we should not change  
projections with official EPSG/PGIS ID's. The idea being that we  
would update the database before a release with any upstream  
corrections  (coming from spatial_ref_sys table in postgis unless  
there is a more official source). So this means three things:

1) we need to decide what will be the cananical source for SRS  
descriptions (Im leaning towoards postgis / spatial ref sys table
2) we find a way to get suggested changes into the upstream srs  
source if they originate from our users
3) we need to come up with a manageable way to synchronise the srs.db  
that is distributed with qgis with the canonical srs source.

If anyone is interested to take on some or all of these aspects  it  
would be great. It doesnt require any coding knowledge as such and  
would be a very useful contribution to QGIS. In the mean time the  
best way to  introduce changes to the distributed srs.db is in the  
form of a simple sql update command patch that will update the  
records in the sqlite database correctly (but running the risk of  
later undoing if these changes have not made it to the upstream  
source of srs defs too.

Hi Marco

I tested using the Mac 0.8preview2 bundle prepared by Tom.

Perhaps Tom is not using the most uptodate gdal in his bundle...

You need a qgis version >= r5849 to change shape geometries. I think Preview2 
is not new enough.

Hello,

Thanks for your answer.
After some tests, the correct +Lon_0 value for NTF seems to be 0.
So proj-4.5.0 ship with the right values.

I don't understand SQL, so I can't send a command patch. I can send my
modified srs.db though.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Oracle-importer plugin
Message-ID: <20060928161206.62010e60@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear list,

now that Martin has made QGIS able to read (or better ignore z-values)
from 25d geometries, I like to announce my first QGIS-plugin, which
loads oracle-layers through OGRs OCI connection.

I am new to C++ and QT so this is my first project I 'learned' QT with
C++... It is a proof-of-concept implementation and currently only
compiles when you adopt the paths in qgsoracleplugin.pro to your needs.
The Makefile.am does not work yet.

The code can be found here [1].

Anyway, it needs the latest SVN (after r5879).

Many thanks to Marco Hugentobler who gave me the basis to develop this
plugin (its based on the Plugin-writers workshop code from
FOSS4G2006 [2]) and who answered *some* questions...

Perhaps the plugin is useful for someone.

I like to hear your opinion

	Stephan

Message-ID: <17691.64167.767546.200984@viola.nmsu.edu>

Thanks, Tim, for the note on qgis-user regarding bug reports.  It was
very timely, as I am trying to get qgis packages built for pkgsrc
(www.pkgsrc.org) prior to the v0.8 release and would very much like
help getting at least some of the patches into the code base.

I have just submitted ticket #313 with some patches that are necessary
(not sufficient) for building qgis (v0.7.4 and v0.8/preview2) on a
NetBSD platform.  Some of the patches have to do with errors caught by
gcc v4, which is stricter about standards enforcement than gcc v3.
Thus, these probably represent general improvements to the code that
are broader in scope than just NetBSD support.

In addition to the patches submited with ticket #313, there are a few
others that I would appreciate help on resolving.  These all have to
do with configuration.  One recurrent issue is that it is important to
add various -Wl,-rpath,<path_to_shared_lib_directory> options to some
of the compiler flags, e.g., to find the grass libraries and other
dependencies correctly.  How should the configuration system be
modified to accomplish this in the best way?

Thanks for your help.  I hope that this support can be folded into the
current qgis code base prior to the release of the next version.

Cheers,
Brook

OK. Attached is the mega-preliminary qgs->apl "converter". It is
limited. But it does what I wanted it to, ie:

- converts a qgs containing a *single*, unique-value classified layer
- polygon/line color and line width are preserved
- line and polygon dashing are not (I didn't need that and didn't know
how to do it)

Requires Awk and Bash.

Usage: load a polygon vector into QGIS, assign symbology using the
unique value, save the project, use the script like 'qgs2apl.sh -i
input.qgs -o output.apl'. Name the output after your shapefile (eg.
your shapefile is 'vector.shp', then specify 'vector.apl' for -o). Put
your apl file in the same dir where the shapefile is stored. When you
load the shapefile into ArcPad, the features should be preserved as
described above.

Tested on QGIS current SVN and ArcPad 7, with a few layers.

I hope it will be of any use for someone.

Best,
Maciek

P.S.
Why are the colors stored in RBG order instead of RGB in the qgs?

Hi Brook

Thanks for the patches - I will review them over the weekend and  
commit them assuming they are all good to go. With regards to your  
configuration questions, Ill defer them to the dev list in general  
for now since I am not much good with auto*

Ok - I thought Postigs contained a superset of EPSG + other SRS defs.  
But its been  while since I was working on projection stuff so its  
not so fresh in my brain anymore.

This would be great. Ideally if we could come up with a way to  
automate updating the srs defs when we do a release - or build in a  
plugin to qgis to allow the users to update the srs database.

Hi

I maintain the Ubuntu Build Notes[1] for QGIS. Since I've just
reformatted my hard drive, I took the opportunity to finalise the
documentation for building QGIS 0.8 from source. I've split the old
monolithic document into separate parts. The aforementioned link takes
you to an index page which will grow over time as new versions of QGIS
are created. Anyway I hope these  updated build notes for 0.8 [2] will
help some of my fellow Ubunti-ites out there...

Hi Nilton

I think those warnings can be safely ignored for now.

Could you send me a copy of "map.tif" ?

I suggest you install a copy of QGIS
(http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=65&Itemid=87)
and use it to view the images. The latest version of libopenmodeller
writes floating point images which many image viewers do not support.
The reason for this is that it allows us to preserve the actual
probabilities rather than rescaling them.

When you open QGIS, use the menu like this:

Layer -> Add a raster layer

Then select your tiff file. It should display nicely in QGIS.

Do you mind if we discuss this on the openmodeller-devel mailing list
as the information may be useful to others in future searching the
archives?

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

just a small note to the instructions - regarding to build.sh script,
you need to use "debug" not "xdebug" as a parameter as the if command
in the script is:
if [ x$2 = xdebug ]
That 'x' in front of $2 is there because if $2 is empty, test command
doesn't have left operand and fails with an error. Prepending the
parameter with 'x' or something similar is common practise to preserve
compatibility with old shells, I guess that nowadays it's quite safe
to use 'newer' idiom:
if [ "$2" = debug ]

Looking further at build.sh, test for static builds is incorrect:
if [ x$2 = "static" ]

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qmake not found if qt is in default Troltech's dir
Message-ID: <451D99F7.90908@o2.pl>

Hi,

Trying to build current SVN with qt 4.1.4 built from source and
installed in it's defualt /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4, I get an error
around the end of QGIS compilation:

./create_qm_files.sh: line 12: qmake: command not found
Creating qm files
./create_qm_files.sh: line 14: lrelease: command not found
Removing qmake project file
rm: nie mo?na usun?? `qgis_qm.pro': No such file or directory


qmake and lrelease are there in the /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4/bin
and I specified --with-qtdir=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4 for the
autogen.sh. Propably it fails to find the executables because it's
using some hardcoded path instead of the /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4/bin.

I had to work it around by creating symlinks in /usr/local/bin.

Please correct this if possible.

Thanks.

Maciek

The Qt utilities need to be in your PATH. You should add $QTDIR/bin  
to your path prior to compiling. There is no hardcoded path and
specifying --with-qtdir doesn't add it to your path during configure.

Actually, the create_qm_files.sh relies on that the environment variable 
QTDIR is set. It calls "$QTDIR/bin/qmake", instead of just "qmake". I 
had to "export QTDIR=/usr", and then it ran.

I propose we change this and just use "qmake" instead?

Hi all.
During our lessons on XP, we got random crashes when loading GRASS
vectors (same data, on one machine it loads correctly, on the next one
it crashes). I could not investigated further during the lessons, so I
cannot add much, and therefore I do not reopen:
http://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/110
but the problem is still there. If someone has access to a win machine,
plese do further testing.

Dear developers,

in qgswmsprovider.cpp:1954, there are the following lines of code. I have gcc 
version 4.0.3 and this version needs 'std::isfinite' to compile. I wonder 
from what version on it needs 'isfinite' without 'std::' . Please post your 
compiler versions and if you need 'std::isfinite' or 'isfinite' for it.

cheers,
Marco

Ah, someone else with a compiler requiring std::isfinite.
What compiler version are you using?
As a temporary fix, just insert

#if __GNUC__ >= 5

instead of

#if __GNUC__ >= 4

in qgswmsprovider.cpp:1954. For the longer term, we need to make the version 
query more precise.

Hi,

I'll sort out a check for isfinite/std::isfinite in configure and do this
properly...

Hi,

SVN r5890 has a speculative fix for this compilation problem. I'm
interested in whether it works for everyone...

Marco,

It's very strange libstdc++ puts isfinite to std namespace.
isinfinite is *not* in C++ standard, as well as not in C98.
This macro (as well as isnormal,isnan,isinf, etc.) is defined in C99
standard. C++ standard does not define them (is based on C98).

As I see in libstdc++ sources, this macro is wrapped by free function.
In libstdc++ 3.x, it's in global namespace, but in libstdc++ 4.x, it's
defined in std::, but it's *marked* in sources as an extension.

So, isfinite or std::isfinite is *not* portable function,
it's an extension.

Isn't it better to use std::numeric_limits<T> [1] to check
numeric ranges?
Less code and better portability:

if (extent.yMax() <= std::numeric_limits<double>::max()) {}

There is also test for infinity support for given type possible:

if (std::numeric_limits<double>::has_infinity
{
    if (some_value == std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity())
   {
      // some_value is infinite
   }
}

Thats fine -- that approach also requires that the Qt bin directory  
is in the PATH.

Marco,

Good point about using numeric_limits instead of the C99 isfinite. I'll
change the offending code to use numeric_limits (and move it to QgsRect
where it better belongs)

Thanks

Gavin

+1

By the way, here I asked on the libstdc++ list why non-standard
stuff is pushed into std:: namespaces in libstdc++, so may be you'll
find there something interesting too.

I also believe it's good to know about the future, so here is a few
words what standards compatibility may be expected in C++0x, next
release of C++.
