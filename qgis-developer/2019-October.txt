Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is qgis_sip_uptodate test giving false negative ?
Message-ID: <20191001102839.GC27175@liz>

Looking at Travis output, the qgis_sip_uptodate test passes:

  https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/591915632#L958

BUT a test I've added to check if repository files changed
shows that the `python/server/server_auto.sip` file in the
git repository was changed during tests:

  https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/591915632#L941-L944

Are the two facts contraddictory ?

Reading scripts/sipify.pl it looks like the `-p` switch is
not supported, while the `-s` switch is used for two different
switches (a typo?):

    GetOptions ("debug" => \$debug, "sip_output=s" => \$sip_output,
							  "python_output=s" => \$python_output) && @ARGV == 1;

I mention this because tests/code_layout/test_sipfiles_uptodate.sh
uses the -p switch instead:

		./scripts/sipify.pl -p python/${module}/auto_additions/${pyfile}.temp $header |
				diff python/$sipfile.in -

So, I suspect sipify.pl is _overriding_ the source file and NEVER producing
a .temp file, resulting in:

  1) A false OK message from Travis (no difference!)
	2) A modification of source tree during test

Denis, you seem to have introduced both the new switch (with the
typo) and the corresponding call with commit
6301f9b6f3ba1c9b39ffe55698365ab98aa059a1 on May 2018.

I'm not sure how this could have gone unnoticed till now,
maybe the sipify.pl sript should noisily fail when passed
unknown switches ?

Ok sorry for the noise, the OptName=s syntax is to specify that
the option takes an argument, doesn't give an indication of a
corresponding short-version option. I'm still trying to understand
why the server_auto.sip file is modified by travis...

Hi Calvin and list,

Have you looked at the GRASS GIS v.generalize tool? 
https://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/v.generalize.html

The Douglas-Peucker algorithm is implemented there and I have used that 
with (topologic)success recently on many touching polygons. Should work 
for polylines too!

Best regards,
Aron

Dear Tim and Dear QGIS devs,
I am sorry that the information came out so early cause I had hectic weeks planned after this year's FOSS4G with no time to answer this email which is very important to me.

Anyway, I would like to announce my interest in pushing this idea of integrating the ZOO-Project ahead and, would like to participate in a call for discussing this further.

I noticed that you listed all the available options that we have discussed during the FOSS4G event and, clearly shown the advantages of using the ZOO-Project by the addition of multiple available services. Still, I would like to add that the ZOO-Project is also able now to run remotely OrfeoToolBox applications on HPC. Hence, we can also imagine that this support (or any future support for remote execution like this one) can also be available from QGIS itself after the integration work has been done. In addition to existing services, we can also mention that developers will be able to implement their new services or integrate their existing algorithms in every supported programming languages. 

On the other hand, in case we have the 3 points implemented, I would like to insist on the fact that it would mean that any time you implement a service to be run from within your local QGIS it will then be available with no modification on your QGIS Server too. In my opinion, this is the key point of the integration idea.

I was aware of the QGIS Server WPS implementation and, I would be very happy to collaborate with 3LIZ and, other people working on it when handling this work.

I hope to hear back from you and, we can have the call setup despite my latency in answering this email.

Best regards,

I am guessing this is working on Cartesian coordinates and not geodesic
which is fine if you have a local projection. I think I will go ahead and
implement some similar geodesic algorithms. Thank you for the GRASS link.
It will help.

Thanks,

Calvin

despite its name, that has been always confusing, that option in DB Manager
never transformed geometries to SINGLE from MULTI along the import process).

What the option means (meant?) is that if I have a layer that is declared
as MULTI but actually has no multipart geometries in it, then it can be
imported as a non-MULTI table.

In past QGIS releases if you had a layer with a multi-geometry and checked
that option then DB manager returned an error like

Error 7

Feature write errors:

Creation error for features from #0 to #0. Provider errors was:

Geometry type MultiLineString not compatible with provider type LineString.

PostGIS error while adding features: ERROR: Geometry type (MultiLineString)
does not match column type (LineString)

now it does not and imports to MULTI anyway and silently. And it does also
if you don't have any multi-geometry, which of course are both bugs and
regressions.


Error 7

Feature write errors:

Message-ID: <42D6146F-B504-4CFB-B43F-058BA1AD4E71@gmail.com>

Hi Tomas,

Thank you for your suggestions but in the meantime i fixed the issue that was due to different versions of the libpng library on my system.

I changed the compilation of GDAL to build against the external (system) libpng library instead of the internal one provided with the GDAL source.

Issue was mentioned and fixed before in
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/gdal-dev-compile-gdal-using-the-libpng-1-6-26-td5342371.html

Best regards,

Tom

Hi Raymond,
Sorry for my late reply.

QGIS says that after unpacking zip file named e.g. "myMagicPlugin.zip" or 
"myMagicPlugin.an-optional-suffix.zip" it can't find Python package named 
exactly like the zip file base name (myMagicPlugin).

Again it looks like a name mismatch. You know it's your plugin, but QGIS 
didn't recognize it thus didn't activated.

Cheers,

Hi Tom,

Thanks for the feedback. Good to know that you found the problem.

I'll add the ldd qgis_mapserv.fcgi to my list of things to check, if
something is wrong with QGIS Server.

Best regards,

Jorge

agreed. do you know whether there is a ticket for this?
in some cases this is really a blocker.

Hi all,

It this is of any help, I have realized that naming the file plugin.zip or
plugin-x.y.z.zip is failing while plugin.x.y.z.zip actually works.

Hi,

was this thread the more recent discussion/decision about what to backport
in LTS?

If I understand correctly, the judgment is left to the individual core
developer who by chance happens to approve the backport PR.

I'm asking because I feel that we developers do not always agree about what
to backport and what not, IMO if the backport
1. is a bugfix
2. it has a low risk [1] of side effects
I don't see a valid reason for not doing the backport while I see a few
advantages for the LTS users if the bugfix landed into LTS.

In other word, and more importantly: do we have a strict policy that states
that "ONLY PATCHES THAT FIX CRASHES OR DATA LOSS ARE ADMISSIBLE FOR
BACKPORTING TO LTS"?

If this is the case, I would recommend that we write it down in the
developers docs and we start to label/close the LTS issues with "WON'T FIX"

Final note: I really don't have a strong opinion here, but I thinks it's a
shame if we waste developer's time on backports that are not admissible and
I think we should have a clear(er) policy (unless it's just for me that
it's not clear).

Thank you for your opinions!

[1] Yes, I know it's fuzzy but you get the point, examples are: good test
coverage, UI only insulated change etc.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS aborted when opened (randomly)
Message-ID: <f0f055a4-69f0-653e-796c-164d4f9695bc@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm facing a very very very strange situation. I have 2 QGIS installed
(3.4 from package and master compiled on debian sid).

When I switch on my computer (I did not update nothing, no QGIS, no
recompiled QGIS no update on debian in the last 2 weeks), when I try to
open both QGIS I SOMETIMES get this error (calling qgis from package,
same error for master). And QGIS died.

If I try and retry, SOMETIMES I can open it. No other software are
opened. Any clue?

Thanks

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS unavailable at QGIS startup time on OSGeo4W
Message-ID: <20191002113224.244e1078@hookipa.localdomain>

Hi QGIS devs!

I need to use a PyQGIS startup script (set via the PYQGIS_STARTUP
envvar). And I want to do "import qgis" from that startup script!

It works on Linux, because PyQGIS is installed in the system-wide
Python environment. So no problem here.

But it doesn't work with OSGeo4W. OSGeo4W installs PyQGIS in
C:/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis/python, and that path isn't in sys.path when my
startup script is executed.

The C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-bin.env file indeed does not set PYTHONPATH.
Likewise, the C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\py3_env.bat file, which
C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis.bat includes, has "SET PYTHONPATH=" (PYTHONPATH
set to nothing).

What do you think? Shouldn't OSGeo4W set PYTHONPATH to
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\python;%PYTHONPATH%" in py3_env.bat and
qgis-bin.env for startup scripts to be able to import and use the qgis
module?

Thanks!

No..... BUT.... recently I've been pushing this view hard. I'm of the
firm belief that EVERY backport, regardless how trivial it appears,
brings with it risk. And at this stage in the life of the LTR I just
don't see the risks of regressions outweighing anything but
crash/corruption fixes.

To use an example, take https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/32068
"Disappearing Null representation in Range Widget on
QgsDoubleSpinBox". Tests aside, it's a one line, trival fix. But at
the same time, given the age of 3.4, users are well and truely used to
the current behavior (even if it's not ideal) and have learnt to live
with it. And if that 1 line change causes an unintended regression in
say... entering values in a spin box on non-english locales on
macos... the the consequence is disastrous.

So it's not a matter of just looking at the fix in isolation. It's a
risk management game of weighing up the (ever present) risk of
regression vs the severity of the original bug.

> If this is the case, I would recommend that we write it down in the developers docs and we start to label/close the LTS issues with "WON'T FIX"

Possibly, but it's very different early in the life of the LTR
release. It's only when we close in on the final rounds of patches for
a mature LTR release that I think the pace of chances should slow to a
trickle.

"Stage" is the keyword here. Number of software vendors have generally several 
stages during the lifetime of the product they support, generally a first one 
which is the polishing of the release where they can even add new features, 
another one where they only backport (critical) bug fixes, and a final one 
where they only backport security related bug fixes.

So, maybe we could have a 2 phase process:
- First 6 months: backport of bug fixes with the same criteria as we do 
currently
- Last 6 months: only critical bug fixes (crashes, data loss)

(or 9 months / 3 months, whatever...)

But if we're really in that mode, that should not only apply to QGIS but to 
its dependent libraries as well. Basically this would mean that for OSGeo4W, 
you should have 2 distinct sets for the dependencies: one frozen (or with very 
controlled changes) for the LTR, and a living one for the new versions.

No. py3_env.bat belongs to osgeo4w's python and just switches to python3.  It
shouldn't know about qgis.  It's used with everything that use python3 (eg.
several qgis versions).

Not sure why PYQGIS_STARTUP is used that early.  The python path is added
shortly after it was referenced:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp#L98

So other platforms should have the same issue.

Yes, that makes sense too.

Hi, all


Recently I found out about this plugin
https://github.com/qgist/toolbargenerator, which was presented in the
FOSS4G 2019 Bucharest. What surprised me is that this plugin has EXACTLY
the same functionality as mine, implemented for QGIS 3
https://github.com/All4Gis/CustomToolBar , which I developed without any
funding.

Not only it does the same but also it has the same limitations as mine
(like i18n problems).


The main difference lies on the fact that it stores the tools depending on
the user profile (which in my plugin implies modifying 2 -and only 2-
lines).


I don’t mind if the code is better written or not, but the original idea is
mine (moreover, it is completely functional in QGIS3) and I developed it
four years ago.


Four years ago I experienced the same situation with “QGIS themes”, which I
developed and then, a core developer (Nathan) implemented a plugin and
integrated it in the QGIS core. I wrote to him and he changed his entry
indicating that this idea already existed (
https://nathanw.net/2015/08/13/qgis-ui-themes-plugin/). I found it
satisfactory, because this functionality had been already developed by
another developer.


I think that who had the original idea should be taken into account. We are
in an Open Source world, where I sometimes have the impression that
“anything goes”. However, if an idea already exists, the original author
should be taken into account or at least, the original author should be
cited in a visible place.


Here you can find my discussion with the other author:
https://github.com/qgist/toolbargenerator/issues/7


I think that these situations discourage people to collaborate in QGIS and
in the open source, in general, if the original idea and the developer work
are not valued.

Yep saw that. And I was wondering too.

Except that there's no probleme on Linux, because PyQGIS is installed
globally in the main Python environment.

So Jürgen, would you suggest to change the QGIS code?

Hey,

Ideas are a tricky one.  There is no need to give someone else credit for
an idea if you don't want to, even if you feel you had it first. It's a
nice thing to do but not required by any means.  You can copyright your
code but that doesn't stop someone reimplementing your idea in a different
way, it's why we have 100 different browsers these days.  This is just how
the software world works generally.   We take ideas from others and
evolve them and you can draw inspiration from many places.  If you want to
keep an idea for you own you need a patent but good luck :)

For an example, I added and worked on the style dock (also for free ;) )
along with others for a very long time, one of my largest QGIS projects in
core, however at the time I wasn't aware the same thing was in ArcGIS Pro
before me, I simply didn't know.  I took inspiration from other tools like
CartoDB and Mapbox at the time. Same with ideas I have had while using
Excel etc (although I did give credit to them in my post about that feature)

>> but the original idea is mine

I would be careful going down this route IMO.   Mainly because I did it
back in 1.6 or so but never open-sourced it because my code sucked back
then. Customizing the QGIS UI has always been on my, and others, minds on
the project, and we work together to make it better.  Sure some people have
ideas and we get to take credit they are ours but in the end, we don't work
in a vacuum and we contribute to each other and the project in different
ways.   Just because someone writes the code doesn't mean they own the idea
and no one else can do it. I have let many other devs, mainly Nyall when I
bug him enough, implement ideas I have had and don't ask for credit, most
of the time he does other times not.   I'm not in this for fame.

So yes generally you should credit if you can because it's nice thing to do
but just be careful of cashing the "I did this for free and this idea was
mine first how dare you"  because, in the end, it will end in frustration.
A lot of us work for free on QGIS, many many hours, many many late nights.
The best thing you can do is reach out and try and join forces if you can,
which it seems they are keen on.

For context: I made Roam a tablet version of QGIS for Windows (the first
from what I know), and now there is QField, and Input both using the same
kind of ideas (using the QGIS libs in a standalone project).  Making a
tablet version of QGIS wasn't my idea I was just the first to make a
installable standalone version and pushed it out.  Like a lot of things in
life, it's about the advertisement around the things you make if you want
people to see you as the main go for the idea.

Completely in agreement with you.

Maybe it's my way of seeing things, I always like to put the source, the
idea, or code that I have taken from other sites. For example the styles in
the Load Qss plugin is the reference to FreeCad and for example in other
projects the classes or code taken from others is in the header a
reference. I always leave a reference to the "original" or so I think.
https://github.com/All4Gis/QGISFMV/blob/master/code/geo/mgrs.py

It is clear that we all take ideas from some place or if something occurs
to us then we implement it and say that we have been the "first".

>> but the original idea is mine

About this I mean that it was the first "public" option, sure that many
people had already done it and had it, but not public. The idea is not
mine, is QT if it has to be someone's.

That's free software, but it's annoying when you spend time (without
charging as many people and passion for free software and QGIS) or you come
up with something new and someone later does the same thing and not even
mention you, if I think out of respect for your work. It's frustrating.

I guess it's just things that happen and it's not the first time it's
happened or the last time.

Message-ID: <631b194cacde473eae54eba023671b8e@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Hi all,

I am working on a standalone pyqgis application, and I'm completely stuck on the attribute dialog when adding a feature to a layer.

The dialog opens but shows a red error message 'failed to create widget with type ...' (see image attachment).
Any clue ?

Thanks a lot,
Good day :)

The plugin.zip should work (and it works for me), as the suffix is optional. 
For the latter, it seems to be confusing you can only use dot, not a dash. So 
maybe it's a high time to fix it:

How old is your master build? This looks a little like something which
may have been fixed by Martin ~ 3-4 weeks ago.

Hi Calvin,

I think there's a strong use case for adding this to the c++ API.
Would you be willing to put together a proof of concept in Python code
and I'll port it to c++ for you?

Hi list,

I'd like to re-raise the idea of adding a "needs sponsorship" label
for use on selected github tickets. E.g.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32098

I know this has been discussed in the past and the response was
unfavourable, but I'd like to see if opinions have changed on this at
all...

Hi, 

Something for our newsfeed that will be introduced in  version 3.10?
Ideally we would have "accumulated" issues in a feed, not many small for
individual ones. 

The idea to raise funds for fixing issues or new development was one of
the main drivers behind integrating the newsfeed in the start page of
QGIS 3.10. 

But I would be fine with the label in Github as well.

it WAS some weeks old, but even after I recompiled it continues to
happen (but just SOMETIMES). Strange enough is that I have the same
error on the release installed by package.

Hi Nyall,

What would be exactly the meaning of that label?

If a developer adds that label, does that mean the she would be interested
in implementing the feature if she get paid for it?

What if another developer is willing to implement it for free? She just
removes the label and starts working on it?

I'm not sure we want to expose this kind of things in the issue tracker, I
mean we should probably use other channels and perhaps add some other label
that clearly indicates that there is a fundraising campaign running for
that particular issue/feature.

If there is a running campaign I think it's totally fine to put a link to
the campaign (and a label) in the issue.

Btw, thanks for raising the topic, in general I like very much the idea to
give more visibility to fund-raising campaigns (which includes crowdfunding
of course).

in principle I'd be in favour of this, to make it clear to users that
they can make the difference and add more responsibility upon their
shoulders. However, I agree with Ale: what is the criteria? Every ticket
needs resources to be fixed, so which  one would earn the label?
If we find a reasonable (not requiring too admin work) and transparent
(no ambiguity) way of managing this, our newsfeed in the startup window
will be a powerful tool to implement it, as Andreas pointed out.
Cheers.

Hi
I quite agree with Paolo. What about reversing the logic and add a label
"Funded by QGIS.org" when we tackle a bug or a feature with QGIS.org
ressources ?

This would also help in identifying the issues tackled by our fundings in
the long run, and help in coordinating a bit.

Regards
Régis

Hi,

I think that's at least as difficult, because QGIS gives pretty much 
"free choice" on the bugfixing campaigns and individual devs choose, 
where they are most efficient in spending their time.

Maybe it's best to keep the labels in the tracker free from any funding 
related things and just use it to assign people who are actively working 
on things which have been sold. If once in a while someone rolls the 
drums for an ongoing crowdfunding campaign in a comment, that's 
acceptable for me OTOH.

Bests

Matthias

thanks for pointing this out. I understand your frustration, but I think
these things are more or less unavoidable, and in the long term are not
a serious issue - time will select the best solutions.
from a different point of view, we would really like not to have
duplication in our plugin list, as th; I regularly ask in this case to
seriously evaluate the opportunity for a merge. Could this apply also here?
Cheers, and thanks for sharing.

Hi all,

I thought that only new plugins need to be approved. Recently I
published new version of Gisquick plugin (2.0.1) and it's still not
available. This means that also new versions of already approved
plugin need to be approved. It's putting extra work on moderator's
shoulders. BTW, what is procedure for approval, which steps are
performed?

Thanks for clarification, Martin

checks as described in the plugin site page.
please be patient: this is volunteer work, that relies on two people
only, so we cannot always be very fast.

I perfectly understand this point since I am doing volunteering work
for the most of my professional life. This raises two
questions/suggestions:

* does need to be every new version really approved?
* the procedure could be probably somehow (semi)-automated in order to
decrease volunteering work and speed up approval?

Best regards, Martin

I'd love this - we have studied the possibility, and believed it was not
worth the effort, but you are most welcome to help us finding a better
solution.

It sounds like a segfault on exit

Hi All

I am trying to configure a renderer with a marker line in python.  Currently it is killing QGIS with seg fault.  Running recent dev build or 3.8.4 on ubuntu 18.04.

Below is the code I am running in python console which crashes QGIS.  Any ideas as to what I am doing wrong?

Thanks in advance
Chris

def tryit():
    basePointSymbol = QgsMarkerSymbol.createSimple({})
    basePointLine = QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer()
    basePointLine.setPlacement(QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer.FirstVertex)
    basePointLine.setSubSymbol(basePointSymbol)
    symbol=QgsLineSymbol([basePointLine])
    renderer = QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(symbol)
    layer=iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
    layer.setRenderer(renderer)
    layer.triggerRepaint()

tryit()

Ok, these are all valid concerns.

My original thinking was that we would use this tag for tickets which
require extensive development (e.g. weeks of development), and
accordingly are extremely unlikely to happen on a solely volunteer
basis.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New plugin: Review / Procedure
Message-ID: <CAANKLwiZ5YZLUZQH9VULDDERGHQn67AcaHvxinxte9xuxfhMjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm currently working on my first plugin and intend to eventually
submit it to the official repository.

It would be good to have some people review it - testing and/or
looking at the code before it gets a wider audience.

Should I simply submit as say, v0.1, mark it experimental, and perhaps
add some notes considering its early state.  Or should I put it on
Github (where it will also probably end up anyway) and announce it
here?  Or an alternative?

The plugin is called OSMImporter and is intended to import layer(s) of
features types from OpenStreetMap data. The original use case was to
import a single Administration Boundary level (e.g. US counties) into
a multipolygon layer; but there are also options for railways, water;
buildings. Roads, POIs, and Land-Use are still to be implemented - and
more can be easily added.

Yes I know someone with moderate GIS experience would not have any
difficulty importing and separating this kind of data in QGIS, however
a significant number of my previous MapPoint customers would
definitely have trouble doing this.  This is the first step in a
larger plan to create plugin(s) to emulate some MapPoint functionality
in QGIS - and potentially opening up a new market of low budget
business map users. The easy import of admin boundary shapes is an
initial step before starting on a Territory Manager. MapPoint's
Territory Manager was a potentially good idea but had some serious
flaws.
If anyone is interested in such a project or would find a use for one,
then let me know. I'm sure we could work together!


Thanks,

Richard Marsden

this makes sense. Perhaps better advertizing one of these tickets as
soon as one dev is interested and available to fix it?

what do you think are the limitation of the current OSM Downloader
plugin? In general I would advise towards improving the existing rather
than duplicating the functionality.

Message-ID: <CAGSmR=-dx94PNO6ZSDnrOVk8D9uNYz5A6tu+fpSaA0r65uxEDg@mail.gmail.com>

*Hi QGIS users & developers !!!*

In layout, you can insert many maps (Add map), but only can be regular
polygons (square or rectangular), but when you want to create a special
presentation like a Tetris, you can't do it. The figures circle,
triangular, add polygon,... can't show maps inside them.
Someone know how can show maps inside irregular polygons in layouts?
Would be nice that QGIS has this options in layouts...

I think there is still a missing link from an issue to how to proceed if 
one wants to have it resolved.

For an average visitor it might appear as "It has been registered in the 
tracker, it will eventually be resolved", presumably by pure magic ;)

What would be good is instructions on the possibilities to get things 
done well visible there. Something like a "Help us fix this issue" 
button just next to the issue discussion.

Hi,

I really like gis.stackexchange bounty mechanism [1]. Issues could have
a "start a bounty" button, exactly like the gis.stackechange. Users
could allocate any amount between 50 and 500 bounty points, in 50-point
increments. Any user (other than the one reporting the issue) can ass
bounty points.

How they get bounty-points? Donations to QGIS (managed by PSC) awards
bounty-points to that user/company/community. An 1.000,00 € donation
would award 1000 bounty-points. They can invest the bounty points to
solve issues.

Developer(s)/ able to solve the issue would be refunded (in real money)
according to the number of bounty point.

This wouldn't be difficult to implement, I think. The mechanism is
really transparent, for users and for developers.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why the QGIS docs team is struggling
Message-ID: <7fb644c2-3878-8242-eaf2-2063f296fa2d@gmail.com>

Hi qgis-developer folks,

With the support of the qgis docs team, I've done a deep dive into the 
state of QGIS docs. I'm keen to receive a wider review and suggestions 
on how to approach resourcing the roles I suggest are required.

Comments are welcomed, either in this thread, or in the doc. Please 
restrain from using track-changes (as it makes the doc difficult to read).

Full paper here: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11N5d1aBgkdQ80I7RKBlt_jx9Uk1RGsvOTeq_TSFeljA/ 
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/11N5d1aBgkdQ80I7RKBlt_jx9Uk1RGsvOTeq_TSFeljA/edit#>

**


    *Summary*

*

Many have tried to help QGIS docs, with limited success. I’ve collated 
insightful quotes from a bunch of their stories and then postulate 
solutions. Surprisingly, the biggest problem isn’t a lack of tech 
writers or our complicated tools (although they are factors).

Problems people have identified centre around:

  *

    Poorly capturing community good-will and offers of assistance;

  *

    A lack of direction;

  *

    Struggling to keep up with a rapidly evolving software baseline;

  *

    Documentation and training being generated outside of the core project.

  *

    Insufficient writing expertise;

This leads to a case for:

  *

    Engaging a community evangelist / coordinator;

  *

    Defining a vision and roadmap;

  *

    Implementing an information architecture review;

  *

    Engaging a trained technical writer; and

  *

    Attracting external docs back into the core.

While acknowledging the great work done to date, I feel the QGIS docs 
team has insufficient capacity, and availability of the skill sets 
required to drive this agenda. Targeted and sustained investment should 
be applied to bring the quality of QGIS docs up to the quality of the 
QGIS software.

*

Harrissou & Paolo,

I wasn't aware of the OSM Downloader - which I've just tried. In
common with OGR2OGR  (and native QGIS import), it imports features
according to geometry type - eg. a layer of points, a layer of
multi-polygons, etc.

I was aware of QuickOSM. It didn't work for me when I tried a few
weeks ago. I've since re-tried. From files, it has the same issues as
OSM Downloader / OGR2OGR. The Overpass interface (which is where it
seems to be really targeted) is much more powerful and flexible. Even
then I had to do things like adjust the timeout for what was a simple
query. I think Overpass Queries will be too much for the customers I'm
thinking of - even manually entering key queries is probably too much.
I'll contact the author as suggested - perhaps a third "set of
pre-programmed options" might work rather than my plugin.

Thanks

Richard

Glad suggestions helped.
As this demonstrates, having many plugins is confusing for users and developers alike, hence the need to avoid duplication.
Cheers.

Hi,
we attempted a similar system several years ago, and we found that the
amount of management work was quite relevant, out of our capabilities at
that time. Unsure things have changes over time. A fully automatic
system would be good.
Cheers.

Paulo,

Working out a budget is something I'd like to postpone until after I've 
heard what the core QGIS community has to say about these ideas. So far 
I've described job descriptions. You could use back-of-the-envelope 
calculations to convert these to costs.

I'm sitting on the fringes of the QGIS community, suggesting large 
changes and don't have a clear indication as to whether these ideas are 
considered valuable and realistic, or impractical and unwelcomed. Are 
people paying lip service to wanting docs? Is the core team prepared to 
divert some sponsorship from code to docs? I don't have insights into 
how QGIS funding is sourced or distributed, or who potential sponsors 
might be and what influences them, or even the sentiment of the community.

If I'm to be of further value, I'm going to need help from decision 
makers within the core QGIS team.

Maybe start by answering some of these questions:

How much budget is currently allocated to docs? How much is unallocated?
What is docs budget currently spent on?
Is there potential to expand the docs budget?
Do you think companies would pay for docs, or to get training into the 
core docs?
Are there companies who would hire/contribute an in-kind technical writer?
How would we approach these companies?
Do you think crowd funding would work?
Do you have an opinion on whether once off contracting or sustained 
funding should be applied?
Should a part time retainer be offered?
Is a full time role justified? Are there sufficient funds for a full 
time role?
Can you refer to relevant examples which could justify an approach?
Are there likely candidates in the community for the roles described - 
in particular for the QGIS Docs Community Coordinator?

No, there's no way to achieve this properly using current
functionality. To do it properly we need to ensure that the map
rendering respects the actual shape of the layout map, and doesn't try
to place labels or other symbology effects outside of the actual
visible area.

Please fill tickets in the GitHub repository, I will help you there.

Same as above, let me know what you think about "issues" as you mentionned.
The "OSM File" panel will open the OSM file and will split the HStore field.

I have a TODO list on QuickOSM, some of them are on the GitHub issue
tracker.
Such as:
* download a "Map preset" with several predefined layers in it: hiking map,
cadastral map, biking map, with QGIS styles
* Add JOSM presets (the F3 keyboard shortcut). So people without knowledge
of OSM key/value can write "bakery" in their own language.
* For non Overpass queries, I want to improve the "OSM File" panel by
setting a local OSM/PBF file and then applying filter. So I think it's what
you want too, right?

I will answer to your email you sent me in private too.

We probably wouldn't if we would install multiple versions…

4c1b95ba9ee0d5f0e4c9664bd293003ef280ba31 suggests that it's intentionally that
way - so that should probably stay as is.

Ideas cannot be copyrighted and that's just fine - ideas are a dime a 
dozen; everyone has them all the time. But few people ever implement them.

Which brings us to the crux of the issue - these were implemented so 
ideally should not have been duplicated? And not once but twice for a 
single author. This isn't something you want at the best of times, let 
alone on a resource constrained project like QGIS.

I guess there may be many reasons, and I won't second guess the authors 
here, but it seems that the first thing that should be done before any 
new component/plugin is worked on is to see if there's already one out 
there, and if there is, even if it's dated, try and contact the author. 
Maybe it can be built on, maybe it's a flaky pile of junk, but it only 
takes 10 minutes and may save days/weeks of duplicating work. Maybe it's 
also worth asking on the dev list if anyone has done something to this 
effect previously (I see such posts fairly often here already...).

(Full disclosure - I've recreated the wheel a few times for my own 
projects accidentally).

Just my 2p,

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hello QGis devs,

I purposed two weeks ago this PR <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31942>which
is today marked as "stale".
This PR aims to make the very convenient QgsRasterLayerProperties class
independent from the QgisApp instance. To make this independence stable, I
had followed the Nyall's advice and move the QgsRasterLayerProperties to
the GUI library. I don't know if everything has been made in the rules of
art, but it seems to work.

I want to make this QgsRasterLayerProperties class independent from the
QGisApp to return in the state before the 3.8 version, where the dependency
was created.

I don't think crowd is concerned in this PR  and it not  a big step for
QGIS. I understand QGis devs don't see the advantage of this change.

But, as I am developing stand-alone applications based on the QGis API, I
need to keep the independency from the QGisApp class. Because I don't need
this enormous class and I don't want to have to manage it. On the other
hand, the QgsRasterLayerProperties class is not complicated to use and is
very convenient for displaying the raster layers. Today, I don't imagine
stopping using it!

The purposed PR permits to use this class through the GUI library. This is
cleaner and less tricky than using it from the App library. I think it is a
good thing for stand-alone applications devs.

I don't know if there is a lot of devs who are developing stand-alone
applications. So maybe there is no advantage to accept my PR, and I will
understand it could not be accepted.

But, today,  I need to know if I can count on this PR will be accepted, or
if I have to think about another solution to continue to use the
QgsRasterLayerProperties.

If someone has an idea about this?

Thanks.

For the record it seems that the seg fault is coming from the line

    symbol=QgsLineSymbol([basePointLine])

It works perfectly using:


    symbol=QgsLineSymbol()
    symbol.changeSymbolLayer(0,basePointLine)

Hi All

I am trying to configure a renderer with a marker line in python.  Currently it is killing QGIS with seg fault.  Running recent dev build or 3.8.4 on ubuntu 18.04.

Below is the code I am running in python console which crashes QGIS.  Any ideas as to what I am doing wrong?

Thanks in advance
Chris

#!/usr/bin/python3
from qgis.core import *
from PyQt5.QtCore import *
from PyQt5.QtGui import *

def tryit():
    basePointSymbol = QgsMarkerSymbol.createSimple({})
    basePointLine = QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer()
    basePointLine.setPlacement(QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayer.FirstVertex)
    basePointLine.setSubSymbol(basePointSymbol)
    symbol=QgsLineSymbol([basePointLine])
    renderer = QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(symbol)
    layer=iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
    layer.setRenderer(renderer)
    layer.triggerRepaint()

tryit()

this seems reasonable to me, as generally keeping the GUI separated is a
good practice.
Anyone sees a problem here?

Hi Vincent,

we are now in the feature freeze period, so I am not sure if this change
would not fall to QGIS 3.12 life cycle beginning at the end of October. We
are kind of busy at the moment doing bugfixes and pre-release changes.
Hopefully after the release is sorted there would be more drive for review
and merge of such infrastructure changes.

Cheers,
Peter

Also I believe PR’s are automatically marked as old after two weeks by a little helper bot - so it is not a personal thing. I think you can keep it from going stale by popping in and updating it regularly so devs know you still care about it, then as Peter suggests wait for post-freeze.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I am trying to compile QGIS in Ubuntu 18.04 and I am installing the build
dependencies following the instructions on the INSTALL file.

It seems that python3-autopep8 is not available.

Any suggestions?

Olá Jorge,

I think it worked.

Should we change the INSTALL file?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geodesic Line Simplification

I have currently implemented a geodesic decimation processing routine, but
I have a question for the community. I am thinking about making 3
algorithms to simplify the process rather than one algorithm with more
options where some options would not be applicable to points and other not
applicable to lines so would you agree with my reasoning or not? If I break
it into 3, these would be the algorithms.

1. Geodesic distance and time decimation for point layer.
This would calculate the distance between consecutive points and if they
don't meet the minimum distance then a point would be removed.
Additionally, if a time field is selected it would also calculate the
difference in time between two points and if it is less then the minimum
time then the point would be removed. When both distance and time are
selected and either condition is below the minimum, then the point would be
removed. This algorithm would include an order field and group by field.
There would be the option of preserving the last point despite the fact it
might not meet the criteria.

2. Geodesic distance decimation for lines and perhaps polygons.
Time would not be a part of the algorithm because the individual vertices
don't have time associated with them. This would calculate the distance
between consecutive vertices and if they don't meet the minimum geodesic
distance then the vertex would be removed. There would be an option of
preserving the final vertex despite it might not meet the criteria.

3. Geodesic Simply Algorithm for lines and polygons.
This would implement geodesic versions of algorithms such the
Douglas-Peucker algorithm for lines and polygons. Instead of using
Cartesian math it would use geodesic math.

I have #2 implemented and #1 without time. I think it is probably better to
have a separate algorithm for points and another for lines and polygons.
Would you agree?

Thanks,

Calvin

Thanks for this information.

No problem if this PR is merged (or not) after october, I will wait.

Good luck for this freeze period!

Hi Guys,

First time on this list after attending foss4g (:

I was looking for this PR by Hugo Mercier to get merged:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30747

But it looks like things fell a bit between the chairs, as the feedback was
OK (after a few rounds of comments). Can anyone help to shed some light on
this?

Thanks,

Kaplan

Hi Alex,

It is not easy to have the INSTALL file always updated, for so many
different platforms.

If you really want to provide the detailed build instructions for Ubuntu
18.04, it is better to look at .docker folder in QGIS repository. In
particular, .docker/qgis3-build-deps.dockerfile will have all updated
dependencies and how to install them. This runs every time someone
submit a PR or adds a commit to an open PR. These files are always
updated. It not, our continuous integration fails.

I think the best option is to add a pointer in the INSTALL file to this
information. Something like:

"Please check .docker/qgis3-build-deps.dockerfile for updated
dependencies and .docker/qgis.dockerfile for detailed build instructions
for Ubuntu."

What do you think?

Best regards,

Jorge

Better look at the debian/ folder.  That is what used for the nightly builds on
debian/ubuntu - bionic included - that's also what the dependency list in
INSTALL is generated from using scripts/scandeps.pl - but scandeps.pl has some
extra "convinience" dependencies included that are not actually needed for
building - python3-autopep8 was one of them.    Unfortunatly that was
apparently introduced in buster/cosmic - so not available as package earlier.

Message-ID: <93280973-9430-5b43-ccc5-498be6541537@gmail.com>

Hi all,

during a training I faced some issues on different OSX machines:
basically with the new installer, after QGIS has been correctly
installed it won't open. Clicking on the created icon results in nothing.

For these machines I installed QGIS via Kyngchaos. QGIS was correctly
installed and usable but some troubles with some GDAL algorithm, e.g.
gdal_translte not found (clipping a raster with extent or mask layer).

Does somebody experienced similar issues? Should I open specific tickets?

Cheers and thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Not saving new color scale
Message-ID: <bae1e4ec-b5fb-ccb7-6a9e-b687f88d69bf@gmail.com>

Hi all again,

with QGIS 3.8 and also 3.9 (compiled some days ago) it seems not
possible to get a saved color scale in the list.

Example:

* create new color scale
* creating a default one or also taking one of the cpt-city catalog
* QGIS takes the desired color scale to make the symbology
* the new color scale is not listed in the list of the color scales

I think this could be a bug, but not sure if this is the default
behavior or if something is changed in the default behavior.

If confirmed I can open a ticket

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

That's strange, what icon do you talk about? I don't believe it's added to
the task bar by default.
Have your tried command+space and typing QGIS to start it.
Otherwise, simply going into /Applications and look for it?

Hi Kaplan,

Thanks for your feedback.

This Pull Request has been frozen due to the dedicated current feature
freeze period. It will be merged after the feature freeze period is
over, i.e. when new features are accepted back for inclusion.

I think the last code state is ok to be merged. There are still very
valuable design suggestions raised by Martin in the last comments, but I
won't be able to take them into account soon. I prefer to take some
extra time to fix bugs that should arise when this new feature will be
merged.

Hugo

Good question. Geodesic math will take more time to compute. If you are
using a local projection and the area of interest is small then it will be
faster using euclidean math, but if your projection is using degrees
(WGS84) or you are covering a large area then geodesic is a better choice.

Best wishes,

Calvin

Hi,

I just found the canUninstallPlugin() function in utils.py, which checks for a canBeUninstalled() method in the plugin, and executes it if found.

Despite the method added to my plugin, it's never called.
Did I forget something ?

Thanks,

	Approval)
Message-ID: <59F3DFAA-BAB7-4B3A-86A6-5EADDF64E914@getmailspring.com>

Hello everyone!

First of all I am not sure if this is the right place to talk about this so excuse me in that case.
I am a civil engineering student from a Brazilian university (UFV) and I've been working on a scholarship project of developing a Qgis plugin geometric road design, which will be also my graduation thesis. I am actually just in charge of continuing this project and trying to finish it since it started in qgis 2.x times. The project resides here: https://github.com/matheusfillipe/Topografia (https://link.getmailspring.com/link/59F3DFAA-BAB7-4B3A-86A6-5EADDF64E914 at getmailspring.com/0?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmatheusfillipe%2FTopografia&recipient=cWdpcy1kZXZlbG9wZXJAbGlzdHMub3NnZW8ub3Jn)

It is basically a tool to segment line layers, convert them to tables, creating circular and spiral curves over those layers, computing elevations over those points, defining cross sections and then computing volumes. I thought it would be nice to have it on a easier to install way for the students on my university that's why I wanted it on the repo. Maybe I am wrong about that and that's not the focus of the main qgis plugin repo, I would be open to suggested alternatives if that's the case.
The problem was that I used two libraries, PIL (Pillow, which is used as a fallback) and my own slightly modified fork of Pyqtgraph, which seems to be an issue for plugin approval: https://github.com/matheusfillipe/Topografia/issues/3 (https://link.getmailspring.com/link/59F3DFAA-BAB7-4B3A-86A6-5EADDF64E914 at getmailspring.com/1?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmatheusfillipe%2FTopografia%2Fissues%2F3&recipient=cWdpcy1kZXZlbG9wZXJAbGlzdHMub3NnZW8ub3Jn) I could still remove PIllow but I wont have enough time for working in a way to use the standard PyQtGraph since my scholarship is over and that part of the project is finished. As I said in the issue report I didn't see nothing against using libraries in the plugins page of Qgis if that's allowed by their respective license and PyQtGraph is MIT.
Anyway, my goal with this message is just to clarify if having this plugin on the standard qgis repository is possible and what is it lacking.
Thanks in advance!

Hi all,

 

I've noticed that the Multiple Layer Selection plugin
(http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MultipleLayerSelection/) is not available
for QGIS 3. I was beginning to work on converting it over from QGIS 2 to
QGIS 3, but thought I would reach out to the development community on how
best to do this. I'm not sure if the author/maintainer(s) are around anymore
and I've noticed that the plugin's repository
(http://hub.qgis.org/projects/multilayerselect) no longer exists. So, I
wasn't sure how to proceed with forking/updating/maintaining/etc. Some
guidance would be helpful. Thanks.

IMHO can be approved, there is no binary inside and all is pure python (no
binary at all)! I would only suggest to add pythonpath to use that
library only when necessary to avoid to interfere with distributed pillow
of pyqtchart (if will be available)

I can't see reasons to avoid merge, there are already many library packaged
in plugins to manage dependency. Usually including official weels instead
of replicating all the libs, but I can't see problem to customise (for any
reason) a third party library.

Just did a quick search on github to see if the plugin had migrated there and it looks like it has: https://github.com/felferrari/MultipleLayerSelection

 

Looks like it just hasn’t made it’s way to the QGIS repository yet.

Hi all,

 

I’ve noticed that the Multiple Layer Selection plugin (http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MultipleLayerSelection/) is not available for QGIS 3. I was beginning to work on converting it over from QGIS 2 to QGIS 3, but thought I would reach out to the development community on how best to do this. I’m not sure if the author/maintainer(s) are around anymore and I’ve noticed that the plugin’s repository (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/multilayerselect) no longer exists. So, I wasn’t sure how to proceed with forking/updating/maintaining/etc. Some guidance would be helpful. Thanks.

Thanks James. Could you please contact the author (cc:me) and see what
are the issues on adding the ew version to the repo?
Together we can probably solve them easily.
Cheers.

Message-ID: <12f84afdfa304437a9b18430e3d263a5@C119S212VM042.msvyvi.vaha.local>

Hi,

Have a look at this question https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/338478/reading-geopackage-with-large-features-is-very-slow

I guess that quite few QGIS users know that such GeoPackages could be made to open much faster. Perhaps QGIS could give a warning and suggest to update the database to use narrow geometry type in gpkg_geometry_columns if geometry_type_name is GEOMETRY but table contains only points, linestrings/multilinestrings, or polygons/multipolygons.

How to update is another question. I noticed that gpkg_geometry_columns table does not have contraints to prevent harmful updates like changing geometry_type_name from POINT into POLYGON. Making a new database as demonstrated in gis.stackexchange would be safe but slow.

I have submitted an issue to the github repo asking about submitting the plugin to the QGIS plugin repository since I was unable to find an email address to contact the author/maintainer directly.

Sorry for the late reply.

Various OSX versions actually. Seems like QGIS is "frozen" when trying
to open it.

Will try to catch up more comments and write them here

Now that we're in hard freeze for the 3.10.0 release, should we be
branching off the release-3_10 branch now and unfreezing master for 3.12?

Hi all,

I had a PR tagged as frozen this morning.
I guess this is related to the concept of hard freeze. Can someone give
more information on soft vs hard freeze? Any what is accepted to be merged?

Cheers,
Denis

Denis,

My understanding is that the hard freeze is basically a "hands off"
for 3.10.0. We could consider 3.10.0 as being tagged for release as of
the freeze, and it's now just in a pending state while we put out
calls for testing.

I haven't seen any fixed guidelines on what we'd allow in during this
time, but my 2c is that we should only let in absolutely mission
critical, life-threatening stuff. Everything else needs to wait till
3.10.1.

On this note, for the hard freeze period I've set the github master
branch to use the same branch restrictions as we apply to our LTR
branch (no direct pushes, PRs require all passing tests + 1
non-submitter review).*

Hi,

I am wondering if it would be good idea to branch of the 3.10 when it is
already in the hard freeze mode, so we are able to merge PRs to master for
3.12 release?
That way the HF fixes would me merged directly to 3.10 branch and also the
tagging/release could be done on the branch before release?

-1 as branching is part of the release process.

Hi all,

I don't have a strong opinion, but it would be good to have pros and cons
to decide.

Jürgen, since you are the release manager, are you saying it's not a good
idea (why?) or rather that you have to modify the procedure (meaning more
work)?

If this situation is going to happen again, it would be nice to discuss
before voting and take a wise decision.


Cheers,
Denis

Hi,
Since the hard freeze tag, I realize that many dev's didn't expect
this to happen this way. The hard freeze concept doesn't seem so
clear.
We currently have some frozen PR that we need (really) to land into
the future LTR.
We did start long time ago for each of them, it is not about late
work. But we must recognize some of those were hard work (like the
parallelized snapping cache builidng thing)
We also have features for the server waiting.
And we must recognized we need more persons for the review process to
speed up the process.

I don't think we can branch now, as it is the first time we play the
hard freeze process for real for a LTR, we have to discuss some
pending PR's.

Cheers
Régis

You said your code is not working and/or not called. So without seing it,

Seems weird to change every plugin you are going to install for them by
adding this flag.
So you are using a network share for all installed plugins?
Why not a read only directory?

just put your plugin dir on a readonly file system.

The only gain I see is that we can just continue working on master earlier.

Branching off also means that we have to put the new version number on that
branch prior to the actual release.   The nightly build scripts will not expect
to see a new branch and handle it like it as if it was a new release.   When to
merge and how to update translations in the meantime is also unclear (transifex
is tied to the branches we current have).

"Two weeks before the release a hard freeze is initiated, after which only 
fixes to severe problems and regressions introduced after the feature freeze 
are allowed in." - I found it accidentally in [1] this weekend and postponed 
my PR for 3.10.1, apparently opening a Pandora's box...

Now after Régis' email I see there is a number of much more important fixes 
waiting for a merge. That rule also stated "The release manager announces this 
on feature freeze", what wasn't fulfilled. I'm not sure if all those PRs can 
be merged into 3.10.1, or should be rather considered new features? In the 
former case I wouldn't postpone all the release schedule, but if the latter, 
that unexpected freeze should be IMHO thoroughly reconsidered.

Regards,
Borys

I'm also -0 to branch off early, as I think it's a missed opportunity to
get core devs to stick to soon-to-be-released 3.10 for as long as possible
(and therefore oh-so slightly increase the chance of core devs stumbling on
a bug he/she can fix prior to release :) ) .

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Customize QGIS interface
Message-ID: <1571049202035-0.post@n6.nabble.com>


I'm writing here to ask some questions for a thesis project. My ideas are
confused, but I'll try to be clear.

I have a GIS project that represents some historical goods in a region. Each
good has some attributes that describes the entity (like a date, a role,
etc.). My task is to create a list of queries (for example: select and
represents all goods that have a defined role in a defined time) and create
an interface, using QGIS, that allows to represent:

   1. A menu to choose the query,
   2. A form to input informations,
   3. A way to customize the presentations of results both into the map and
into a table.

I know that my question is too broad, but to be more clear I need:

   1. To know which tools allow to customize QGIS's interface (icons, fonts,
colors, all that is possible),

   2. Examples of QGIS projects where these two features are present: 1)
customized interface, 2) possibility to query.

To help I'll attach a sketch of how the interface should be.

Hi devs,

I remove my +1 for branching version 3.10 before release, but we have an 
issue in QGIS managing stale tag for frozen branch.

Some Pull Requests with frozen tag has been tagged stale by the github 
probot-stale.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [PyQGIS] adding a layer with an auth config ID
	leaks into the project
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ZvyKLACq0=kTb==sFeMBrVu9m9eScGfmkEXdn6VJ7ZAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I add a layer using an authentification config ID using PyQGIS:

uri = QgsDataSourceUri()
uri.setConnection(HOST, PORT, DB, None, None, QgsDataSourceUri.SslPrefer,
pg_auth_id)

In the project, the credentials are written in clear text in the project
file:

<datasource>dbname='pub' host=geodb.rootso.org port=5432 user='xxxxxx'
password='xxxxxx'

Is it possible to avoid this? How?

Cheers,
Denis

Hi Denis,

I use:
uri = QgsDataSourceUri()
uri.setDataSource(schemaName, tableName, geomColumn)
uri.setConnection(thisHostName,
     str(thisPort), thisDatabaseName,
     "", "", QgsDataSourceUri.SslRequire, thisAuthCfgId)
vLayerUri = uri.uri(False)
vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(vLayerUri, displayName, "postgres",
     layerOptions)

this works as expected storing the authcfg=auth_id using QGIS 3.4

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrxavJ3fPYwZx3=vQjMYXG1ch0R+4sQOa86g0j96zS+4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

For years now, the main page of QGIS website (https://qgis.org) claims:
Create, edit, visualise, analyse and publish geospatial information on
Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD (Android coming soon)
coming soon....
And looking at the download page (
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html), there's an Android
section that brings to a version of QGIS in the play store. Unsurprisingly,
that version is old and not functional. And unfortunately, there are people
trying to download it. Which is not good for the project imho.

So is QGIS really on Android?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

that is a very old version indeed, but not non functional, it just
supports only "old" androids, if you have a newer android the playstore
will tell you that your device is not supported (still has over 10K
downloads).
We have not updated much that version because QField is the much better
android solution for QGIS. In fact QField is QGIS core behind an highly
optimized UI and was responsible for a lot of improvements in QGIS
itself. We always make whatever possible/sensible in QGIS and reuse it
in QField then.

QField has a very large use base with over 100K downloads and and
average rating of over 4.5 (out of 1100 feedback), but I guess as you
say still not everybody is aware of it. QField also pretty much mimics
the QGIS structure where we welcome external PR, issues and fixes (so
far QField has had contributions by around 15 developers IIRC and is
translated in 13 languages more than 75%).

Obviously QField is GPL and you can use it as you see fit by simply
synchronizing or copying your data to and from your device.

So yes, I guess we should change that link, I'll discuss that tonight in
the PSC meeting.

Cheers

Marco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error 32 (File is in Use): Trying to delete a
 layer file after it's been used by qgis
Message-ID: <4DE5931E-4D01-429E-B07A-612395DDECA7@getmailspring.com>

Hello!

I am working on a plugin that uses a temporary folder to load layer filers on that can end up having the same name so it is needed to have qgis closing the files to allow deleting them. I tested this on qgis 3.8.3 and for linux it worked fine but on windows still gives "error 32 , cannot remove because the file is in use".

process(l)
l.commitChanges()
l.endEditCommand()
QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(l.id())
path=l.dataProvider().dataSourceUri().split("|layername=")[0]
Path(path).unlink() #remove file returns file being used error on this line

To be honest, I think most people forgot about this. I did too, until
your comment prompted my memory!

If they are bug fixes, then they should definitely be merged for
inclusion in 3.10.1 as soon as the 3.10 release is branched. (Just
like we'd normally do with bug fixes and point releases)

Well, it's not unexpected. We're just all forgetful people :D

I still think the original idea has many merits, and don't think we
should discard it because of initial teething problems. The situation
as I see it:

1. we've got one set of serious known regressions, due to the snapping
threading changes. There's an open PR which may resolve these
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31648), which still needs
reviewing, merging and widespread user testing before final release.
Or we can play it safe for 3.10.0 and revert the earlier threading
work, pushing it back for inclusion in 3.10.1. (playing it safe would
be my vote)

2. we've a bunch of open PRs for less critical issues, which, if we
are respecting the hard freeze as intended, should definitely be
delayed until 3.10.1

3. we should be pushing out a widespread call for user testing of the
"release candidate" (i.e. the nightly snapshot which happened after
hard freeze landed)

4. we need some policy about when a bug is considered critical enough
to break the hard freeze. (I'm pretty sure everyone considers their
own personal bugs as "critical", but again, if we are respecting the
hard freeze as original designed then it's only "oh my gosh we CANNOT
possibly push out a release with THIS in it!!!11!!" level bugs which
would be applicable)

1 & 3 need to be resolved ASAP, 4 can be discussed in a nice logical
manner during lead of up final release and after ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Locator search results - double click vs. single
	click
Message-ID: <77699486e8e05a444974dd81a4fa0da0@carto.net>

Hi, 

We just had a Locator plugin developed for our organization. During beta
testing it, my users asked why they have to "double-click" instead of
"single-click" on a search result in order to get the chosen search
result. 

For now I said them that QGIS core does it like this and that Plugins
cannot or should not change this behaviour. 

But why is QGIS core using double click instead of single click? I guess
there might be a reason ... Could you please fill me in about the
reason? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

The locator widget result is a tree view. Results are triggered when the
item is activated.
>From Qt doc [0], activation depends on the platform (single vs double
click).

We could change this to use clicked (actually clicked+entered) instead.

I don't know why it was built like this at first, let's wait for Nyall's
input.

Hi,

There is also Input (https://inputapp.io and
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/input) which is based on QGIS and it is
GPL. The app is also available on iOS (TestFlight) too.

Roam has been also revived by Nathan. So, I suggest to have a section on
the website for "QGIS on mobile/tablet" with all the QGIS based app on
various app stores. There is no one app addressing all the needs of users
(see also proprietary GIS software vendors and multiple mobile apps).

Regards
Saber

I guess we share the same (or almost the same) point of view: everything than 
can wait for 3.10.1 should be postponed and merged 4 rather than 2 weeks 
before release (btw. it's not clearly stated, but I assume the hard freeze 
also applies to point releases - otherwise it won't make much sense)

It was more a question from my side if there are ready-to-merge PRs that can't 
be assumed point release fixes. In that case we'd have a problem to resolve 
and the lack of announcement was a partial reason.

It seems nobody complains, so it's not the case ;)

It was my main concern, and feel the same.

Exactly.

+1. I'll do it here in Poland today. We always have problems with encouraging 
people to be early testers, so let's try harder.

No strong opinion here. If we apply the strict rule to every point release, we 
have two weeks for bugfixes and two weeks for testing whether they didn't 
break anything. I'm afraid that time may be lost, as who uses LTR nightlies? 
;)

Ok, let's go!

Message-ID: <24ca7e15c6d548318325b137cece789c@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Hi,
Is it possible to get the output of QgsLogger from a pyqgis standalone app ?

I would like to have the warnings and everything sent by QgsLogger in my console while running the app, but when I set the environment variable QGIS_DEBUG to 1, 2, or 3 nothing is printed on the console, although I'm sure that a message should be printed (a layer form not found).

If I instanciate a QgsLogger in my pyqgis app it works, but I want to see messages from QgisApplication logger (C++).

Thanks,
BR

Subject: [QGIS-Developer]  QgsPythonRunner in standalone app
Message-ID: <7093a4f2d31349299064e8c934077101@SCPEX2K13-1.scp.fr>

Hi (again) !

I figured out (after 2 days of research !) that in a standalone app, to be able to open a custom layer form when identifying a feature, I have to implement a specific QgsPythonRunner child class (code below).
And then I have to set the QgsPythonRunner.

The problem is that I can't get evalCommand() to work because the variable result is a C++ reference, and python can't deal with it, can it ?

Maybe there is a workaround I didn't think through, or there is a need to pass result as a return value ?


Thanks !
BR


class PythonRunnerStandalone(QgsPythonRunner):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def runCommand(self, command, messageOnError):
        try:
            exec(command, globals())
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            if messageOnError == "":
                print("Error with command:\n")
            else:
                print(messageOnError + "\n")
            print(command)
            print("Catched exception:\n", e)
            return False

    def evalCommand(self, command, result):
        try:
            result = eval(command)  # problem here
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error with command:\n")
            print(command)
            print("Catched exception:\n", e)
            return False

qgis.core.QgsPythonRunner.setInstance(PythonRunnerStandalone())


In QGIS source code qgis-latest/qgis-3.8.2/src/gui/qgsattributeform.cpp lines 1610-1625:

    QString numArgs;

    // Check for eval result
    if ( QgsPythonRunner::eval( QStringLiteral( "len(inspect.getargspec(%1)[0])" ).arg( initFunction ), numArgs ) )  // Here numArgs is passed as reference to my python implementation

[...]

      if ( numArgs == QLatin1String( "3" ) )   // always fails here

Hello,

I need to connect the GPS (G-STAR IV) model BU-353S4 to (QGIS 3.6.0) to see in real time (Waypoints, Tracks & Routes).

How to proceed to recover in real time the data (Waypoints, Tracks & Routes) to (QGIS 3.6.0).

Thank you in advance.

I don't think there was any particular motivation behind the
double-click interaction. I was mostly trying to reproduce exactly how
Qt creator's locator worked, so that's likely what drove that
decision.

That said, we'd need to ensure we don't break keyboard only
interaction by a move away from the double-click activation.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Locator search results - double click vs.
 single click

Hi Nyall, 

Is there no technical reason for the double click? If not, then I would
suggest, single click would be better (if it is feasible to switch at
all). Most online tools (like Google search, or Web-GIS) have a single
click for the search results. I don't think that QGIS users care about
Qt creator's locator. >99% wouldn't even know that Qt creator exists. 

Personally, I don't have a strong opinion on it, but colleagues at my
employer asked my "why double click?" and I promised them to find out
why it is that way. They said: wouldn't it be nice, if QGIS would behave
like most other applications when it comes to search ... 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAB28AshH3j07dShf0SRQjZkK6XMiVhU4ky7HOTeLUUQKv52ufg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Once again a release has rolled around with our changelog in complete
disarray. :(

I w̶a̶s̶t̶e̶d̶ invested some time today copying entries from the git
log across to the changelog, but honestly, we were all TERRIBLE this
cycle and the git commits for features consistently had next to no
documentation. Everyone was at fault here*.

As a result, the changelog still looks... rather... crap. So devs--
please fix and expand on your entries!*

As a reminder from last cycle, we've adapted certain language
guidelines to make the changelog consistent and easier to read:

- Don't use passive tense "A feature was added which allows use
of...", instead replace it with the more personal "WE added a
feature... this allows YOU to...".

- Talk up features! Make them sound innovative, exciting and "fun",
instead of dry and technical.

- Give lots of credit to sponsors, e.g.  "In previous QGIS versions
you had to ... . Now, thanks to sponsorship from ###, you can now
directly import..."

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for the reminder and your work! 

While we are really late, there are still some days left until October
25. So please devs (or sponsors), fill in your entries and add
screenshots. 

While we are struggling with documentation, we should at least try to
get the Visual Changelog done. It is much easier than the documentation
- and it helps the documentation as well! 

Thanks all for a concerted effort!

Fair enough, if this work can land in 3.10.1, I will revert the initial
commit and push it back for 3.10.1 inclusion.

I think I misunderstand the frozen label, I thought it was to delay
merging in 3.12, not in 3.10.1 ?

It's used that way for features -- but otherwise it just means "don't merge!" :)

Hi all,

just a quick notification about new QEP for mesh layer & MDAL

It would allow us to support some other interesting formats in QGIS.

Kind regards,

Hi,

I've just added an enhancement proposal (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/159) for some work I would like to be involved with. I hope that is the right place to put it for discussion but I'm assuming there may also be some chat about it on here so I thought I'd start a thread.

I have a young family so my intention to get developing in my spare time has been hampered by my lack of spare time but I think this is an area I would like to get involved with and I believe my current employer is supportive of the proposal as well so hopefully if I can kick something off then this might be a good starting point for me to get involved as a developer.

I'd be keen to hear others thoughts and opinions and please accept my apologies if I've missed a similar discussion somewhere else and it turns out to be duplicate feature proposal.

Many thanks,
Paul

René-Luc, the only exempt label for the bot is "Merge after thaw":
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.github/stale.yml#L7

It should be applied when a PR is approved and waiting for the branch to be
unfrozen.

Hi all,

I am really confused about the hard freeze period, probably because I
am not able to explain it to anyone. Some questions:

- is there any place where the hard freeze is documented for coders and users?

- What is the expected benefit if we don't get real life testers
focused on testing?

- Isn't it a Release Candidate version we-cant'-say-its-name ? Why so?

- It seems to bring a lot of confusion between. It can cascade delays
for backports to previous LTR, if we postpone fixes, then we miss a
point release time frame, that sounds really strange to me.

- I didn't see any public announcement, so I doubt we get more tester
now than before the hard freeze tag. Did I miss something?


At this point, it doesn't look like a 'teething' problem to me.
I really start thinking we are trying to invent something that does
not exists somewhere else. We do that to try to consolidate our fixes,
which is a very valid reason.
While the attempt is nice,  I think the real issue is that we lack
beta testers. Shouldn't we rediscuss of  beta / RC releases with
installers, together with public annoucement. It is more packaging and
communication work, but I thinks this is where the most efficient
efforts rely.

I really miss a clear vision to be able to advertise it to our
funders. We are ni hard time already just explaining the roadmap and
the need for them to get in sync with it. The more complicated system
we build, the more they tend to fall back to just "wait" other test
the future LTR versions for them.
I am really concerned because I in my whole country, I identify at max
2 GIS administrators involved in testing developpement versions.

I'd appreciate any effort of explaining the rationales and how-to-use
of this hard freeze thing.

Regards
Régis

Hi Paul
For my information, what is the rationale of having it 100% in QGIS? I
tend to prefer the approach of relying on dedicated lib or tools. We
already have pgrouting, GRASS, python libs, various projects around.
I'm currently worried of the move we have of trying to do everything
inside QGIS always, which starts to be a BIG project. Adding features
should be done together by gathering maintainers, bug triagers all the
time in mind.

Régis

I couldn't agree more on this.

What we really have is a lack of communication prior to .0 releases.

Is someone else motivated to sit together and work on a plan regarding 
future release communication and beta releases?

Best regards

Thanks for the guidelines, I didn't know it before. I have added the
description for the features that I did for the GSoC, following the
guidelines.

Best regards.

Hi,

Thanks for your reply.

So the rationale here is fairly simple really; we already have tools in QGIS but I'm not convinced they provide adequate results without turn restrictions and/or z-levels. The travelling sales is a completely different point to which I think your comments apply more directly.

The tools provided as default are basic but I do think there is a distinction between entry level basic and simply providing a wrong answer. At present there is no way to stop it routing off bridges (as far as I can tell) so I'd like to try and fix it.

The ability to do basic routing appears to be a big selling point to my organisation and hence my priority on it. I accept that may not be the case for others.

The problem with pgrouting is that it relies on Postgres and we currently have Microsoft SQLserver and Oracle. My goal is to encourage our users to use QGIS but the decision about database choices is made at a high level and so ideally I'd like to be able to achieve something sensible without having to change database provider.

I think it is also important to note that the existing tools appear to be pretty close to being able to do what I need anyway. I'm really trying to improve the accuracy with turn restrictions and improve the usability a small amount by allowing routing via waypoints. Routing via waypoints is basically just a slightly customisable batch function of what already exists and I've already achieved that using my scripts.

As I said earlier, I accept that travelling sales may be a step too far but it seemed a logical target to me as I've spent a chunk of my career working as a transport planner and I see TSP routing as the entry point to network analysis really.

I may have missed some other options as I'm not aware of routing I can use from GRASS etc?

I completely agree with your final points and the purpose of this email / the proposal was to start to gather opinions on what might or might not work / be sensible and to gather a list of people that are interested really.

Thanks again for your feedback as it is helpful for me to work out where my views sit in comparison to other QGIS users 😊
Paul

Hi Paul
For my information, what is the rationale of having it 100% in QGIS? I tend to prefer the approach of relying on dedicated lib or tools. We already have pgrouting, GRASS, python libs, various projects around.
I'm currently worried of the move we have of trying to do everything inside QGIS always, which starts to be a BIG project. Adding features should be done together by gathering maintainers, bug triagers all the time in mind.

Hi,
I guess that is kind of why I’m raising this today really (now as a feature request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32295). We are looking at what we can do to help QGIS in this area but unfortunately it might end up more as my time on it than money.

Time will tell if that is better or worse 😉

Do we have to remove this feature from the Changelog? because it won't be
available in 3.10.0, but will be in 3.10.1?

Well in the future I think we will be able to use the in application feed to appeal to our existing users to please test the upcoming release. Perhaps Jürgen could add some magic to his release scripts to push out something to the feed when the freeze hits….?

I think this will be one piece in the puzzle.

Next to this I'd like to see other measures, like a release being 
labelled /"QGIS LTR 3.12 Beta 1"/ on the splash screen and possibly 
other communicative measures by mail, blog, application news feed etc, 
like Qt does for example https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-5.14.0-beta1-released .

I think it would be best to have a small group to discuss possibilities 
and required efforts and come forward with a proposal.

Message-ID: <50483764-8c01-d93c-2b8e-c17ce69cd9a0@salzburgresearch.at>

Hi,

I want to add a QgsPropertyOverrideButton to define a expression to 
filter features in a python plugin. Specifically, I want to filter the 
features using the @altas_feature variable. However, all variables are 
missing in the expression dialog.

Can anyone tell me how I can add the variables to the expression dialog?

Regards,
Simon

Hi Simon,

This is all controlled via expression contexts. There's a few parts to
the puzzle:

1. Crafting an appropriate expression context using the individual
"scope" creation functions available through
QgsExpressionContextUtils. You generally start with a global, project
and layer scope, and then add additional scopes on top depending on
the "context" in which the expression will be evaluated.

So something like:

context = QgsExpressionContext()
context.appendScope( QgsExpressionContextUtils.globalScope() )
context.appendScope( QgsExpressionContextUtils.projectScope(
QgsProject.instance() ) )
context.appendScope( QgsExpressionContextUtils.atlasScope( None ) )
context.appendScope( QgsExpressionContextUtils.mapSettingsScope(
iface.mapCanvas() ) )

OR -- depending on the context -- you can get a pre-made context given
straight to you. E.g. if the expression evaluation is occurring inside
a layout item, then you must use

context = item.createExpressionContext()

instead of making your own.

So this part is very dependant on the "context" in which the
expression will be evaluated.

2. Make your dialog or widget which contains the button implement the
QgsExpressionContextGenerator interface.

3. Register your dialog/widget as the context generator for the button
by calling something like

button.registerExpressionContextGenerator( dialog )

Hi Paul,

I'd be happy to provide some mentoring/guidance in this work if you're
looking for advise on how to get started and what approach to take.

(The first step is getting a stable local build environment up and running ;)

Message-ID: <72c03b54-27d4-0f39-ab83-a4546fd8738b@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I found quite "difficult" to had OTB working within Processing. In Linux
I had to install (OTB of course) and another package (otb-qgis) and then
it appears in the Processing providers and seems now working.

Are there any specific instructions to have it installed, also in
Windows environments?

If yes, could it be a good idea to add these instructions in the
documentation?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hello Devs,

I would like to get a detailed error messages when processing.run fails.
For: e.g. in code like ths

try:
  buffered_layer = processing.run(..., context, feedback)['OUTPUT']
except QgsProcessingException as e:
   print (e)  // 'There were errors executing the algorithm.'

The exception message is very generic. The processing log window does show a more detailed message like: "GEOS processing error: intersection failed".

Could the detailed message also be made available in the exception?

Regards,
Tej

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS WFS3 Server temporal intervals
Message-ID: <CAL5Q670ivGbOso8z4onaYiOMGsWkHX7-RvvgpvgJXUxvKbinKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was thinking about how to better implement this feature for QGIS server
(but it does not need to be restricted to the server).

The WFS3 specs covers pretty much all use cases: you can have features with
a single date/datetime temporal property and a set of date/datetime
properties, the latter case can (not "must"!)  be used to define one (or
many) date/datetime intervals.

Now, the specs say that it's up to the server to decide if only a single
property has to be considered when querying or if multiple properties have
to be combined together to create one (or many) intervals. But since we
code the server it means that it's up to us to decide how to handle it.

Note that the conditions need to be AND(ed) and unless properties values
are equal this does make sense only when multiple properties are combined
to form intervals.

So, the question is how to model this in QGIS?

Since this information may spread over multiple fields, I think it should
go into the QgsVectorLayer class (or some separate temporal settings
companion class/struct).


We can also think to handle "open" intervals, where only one of the
lower/upper values are defined.

I was thinking at a new struct to hold a pair of field names and their role
within the interval and store them as QgsVectorLayer property

To represent a single point-in-time value we could still use an interval
where begin and end are the same field.

Any idea or comment?

(or maybe we do need a QEP?)

Hello all,

Sorry for the cross-posting. The last QGIS survey pointed to some users
having problems in finding the right documentation pages, and that we

I would like to start looking into that.

Do we have analytics on our documentation pages? how have access to it?

Hi guys,

I found quite "difficult" to had OTB working within Processing. In Linux
I had to install (OTB of course) and another package (otb-qgis) and then
it appears in the Processing providers and seems now working.

This maybe a bug.

Otb-qgis package provides tools to generate descriptor files for otb alogirthms. 
OTB processing provider uses this tool only if it cannot find a descriptor file which should be in package by default. 

Good news is if there is otb-qgis package installed, it is able to create them on the fly and everything works.

A simple fix would be to add otb-qgis as a dependency to "otb" package. This must be done in debian package control!


> Are there any specific instructions to have it installed, also in Windows environments?

OTB  installation on windows is Download  and extract zip file from orfeo-toolbox.org/packages/

6.6.1 is latest https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/packages/OTB-6.6.1-Win64.zip

You  can simply change location of OTB-X.Y.Z-Linux64 shown in README.md[1]  with  your OTB windows archive.

Idea:
Add download and extract of OTB into qgis windows installer?. Can be optional like GRASS. So windows users won't have to go through any stuff.


> If yes, could it be a good idea to add these instructions in the documentation?

Do you mean in qgis documentation ?

Configuration instructions are detailed in README.md[1]. Maybe this could show as help dialog in qgis ?

Not just for OTB, other providers can benefit from it.

Hi Alessandro,

Are you thinking to scenarios like a layer would have an "eventStart" and 
"eventEnd" timestamps and you would want them to be considered together when 
an incoming request with a datetime=request_begin/request_end interval 
arrives, so as to only select features whose eventStart <= request_end and 
eventEnd >= requestbegin ?

Your above proposal makes sense, but involves complication. I think it might 
be wise to wait a bit before designing this, beause filtering is going to be 
the main topic of the next OAPIF Hackathon in November (
https://www.opengeospatial.org/events/191105apisprint ), so an extension with 
more complex/complete filtering (probably similar to what FES offers) is 
likely to be created. So I can imagine that it would offer the possibility to 
explicitly filter on multiple datetime properties. Yet that wouldn't solve the 
issue with the datetime filtering capability of OAPIF core, but perhaps for 
core, we could adopt a simple solution, like use the first datetime field of 
the layer by default, unless the user (QGIS server admin) selects another one. 
And if more complex behaviour is desired, then OAPIF clients would use the 
filter extension to be able to combine filters on several fields.

Yes, but not limited to a single pair of  eventStart/eventEnd: we might
have
more intervals and since the specs talk about "overlap" operator I can
imagine that it would
make sense and work to search simultaneously on several intervals.


> Your above proposal makes sense, but involves complication.


Yes:  plenty of complications :)

That makes perfectly sense to me, I'll take this route for now and take the
first date/datetime field for filtering
**and** allow the user to configure explicitly one (or more) filtering
fields from the GUI.

What I will NOT implement for now, is interval search on the target
features (which is the most complicated part).


And thank you for your feedback!

That's not appropriate, though. otb doesn't require otb-qgis to function
correctly. More appropriate would be for python3-qgis-common to suggest
otb-qgis like it does saga.

Thank you for your help!

I try to implement a data defined button to select a feature subset for 
the DataPlotly plugin. You can see my code here:

https://github.com/SGroe/DataPlotly/blob/master/DataPlotly/gui/layout_item_gui.py

Unfortunately, when I click on the data defined button, it freezes a 
minute until QGIS crashes with the following error:

QList::QList qlist.h:809
QgsExpressionContext::variableNames qgsexpressioncontext.cpp:408
QgsPropertyOverrideButton::aboutToShowMenu qgspropertyoverridebutton.cpp:475
QMetaObject::activate :
QMenu::popup :
QMenu::exec :
QToolButton::paintEvent :
QToolButton::showMenu :
QToolButton::~QToolButton :

...

Do you have an idea why this happens?

Hey Richard,

Good to "see" you. Can those apache logs be used to see which pages are
more visited?

Do you know if it's possible to create some google analytics for our sites?

I wanted to know what is visited, and what is not.

Can you forward me one of those emails?

Thanks!

Hi Richard and Alexandre,

if we do not have this kind of SEO such as Google Search Console, this can
be a good thing with Google Analytics. Google Search Console is a good
thing to have because is possible to improve research on browsers and rank
pages to first pages when we search for words that are related to qgis or
documentation itself. Will help us because this kind of SEO gives hints ad
tips to optimize de websites.

Another aspect, if we have Google Analytics in the documentation, this will
allow to have reports about geographic IP based distribution of users, type
of access, OS, type of device and what pages and click do the users in the
sites. This will allow us to see and give us feedback which pages are not
visited, pages that have a lot of access and create strategies to improve
pages and so on.

Google Search and Google Analytics don't have cost and we can integrate. We
don't need to create a google account for this they accept foreign emails.

Please let me know if you have any questions that I can try to help, I
recently needed to see this "kind of tricks" to improve a web platform that
I helped to develop.



Regards,
João

That's not appropriate, though. otb doesn't require otb-qgis to function
correctly. More appropriate would be for python3-qgis-common to suggest
otb-qgis like it does saga.

That's great. Saga and otb are in same bucket as far as qgis is concerned. 

I agree +1

Hi all,
we have customers raising an interesting feedback. Windows
notifications are now enable since 3.4 by this PR [0]

In particular, the feature count notification is raising really often
and overcrowding the notification popup. See image [1]

Would that be an issue to remove those feature count notifications?
Or should we provide notification settings to distinguish different
notifications options as we have now?

Hi Régis,

Interesting! Just today, I told myself that I should probably open an issue
report to ask to "silent" these notifications that pop up too often.

Well, yes, they are regular Apache logfile (on qgis2).
You need some analyzing scripts/software I'd think.

Not something I would add :-) but if it is really needed, just add it to
the site/page template. Probably:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/themes/qgis-theme/page.html

I forwarded some to you now.

I see they are sent to me personally (as in richard at qgis.org), not sure
why that is because in the Google-site-console where we have all our
domain stuff I tried to NOT make things personal, but sent this kind of
stuff to admin or psc or so...

Do others with @qgis.org account these also?

Ah, I just logged in to the Google Search Console (never did...), and
the users I can see there are: Gary, Juergen and me.

I added all PSC members now, I think we can add you too, but want the
PSC to do that.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

if possible.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Features & doc issues
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWAN+XcSq45wkh0fvk+JHc2+ec368WNhhZ5ODYoF-k+yNw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

I wanted to raise an idea for exchange.

Considering the fact that documentation and other doc related things seem
to be an issue and since the Documentation repo has hooks into the QGIS
repo I thought that it might be possible to improve the situation a bit.

A good minor step might be to have the doc also add the name of the
contributor in the generated issue, to help the creator remember to write
some documentation.

But I think that a better way would be to build upon the existing sections
of the PR template.

Something like a Documentation and Short description section. The short
description would be used in the logs and the Documentation section would
be used in the docs, or at least as a base.

I assume that this was the initial intent of the description section but I
feel like the description section should be more used for technical
details to explain the PR to other devs and reviewers.

Alex

Thanks Rashad and Bas for your suggestions.

Should I open some upstream ticket/feature request so we won't forget this?

I agree: giving due credits to authors (both of features and of
documentation) could be a good incentive. The main complication here is
to give credits in case of multiauthors (e.g. an entire documentation
chapter can have the name of the author, more difficult is to give
attribution to the precious work of reviewers, updaters etc.).
Cheers.

Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9323140C30F@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I want to calculate the rendered size of a marker symbol for a given feature, when the symbol includes data defined properties.

I'm having trouble navigating the API to determine the steps I need to achieve this!

I think I need to determine the render context for the symbol including the , in terms of the map canvas and the feature being rendered, and then call the symbol size(QgsRenderContext) function with that.  But I haven't figured out how to put together the render context to use in this call.   It looks like part of this is creating a QgsSymbolRendererContext and using .setFeature to create the context for the feature.  But I'm still missing some bits.

Can anyone help with this please?

Or do you know of some documentation describing how the render contexts and expression contexts all fit together?

Thanks.
Chris

I am in a similar situation with https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/32252

>From the website [1]:

"Two weeks before the release a hard freeze is initiated, after which
only fixes to severe problems and regressions **introduced after the
feature freeze** are allowed in."

So my understanding is if it fixes a regression and that regression has
been introduced during the feature freeze, then it is ok to merge it
during the hard freeze. Otherwise, you will have to wait after the hard
freeze.

I am ok with that. But what about backporting to 3.4 ? Do we have to
wait after the hard freeze as well (and then skip a point release), or
is it ok to have bugfixes in 3.4 that are not yet in 3.10 due to hard
freeze ?

Hello Matteo,

Yes you can file a request on otb bug tracker. I think maybe there is a fix required in OTB. 

If the fix is to be done in packaging. I think someone in otb team can forward to debain gis.

The Debian GIS team doesn't maintain the upstream QGIS packaging.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Oracle tests in CI
Message-ID: <87mudtnnvu.fsf@juc-laptop>


Hi all,

I propose a PR [0] to fix Oracle provider and its tests, and I would
like to enable running these tests in travis CI like it's done for
PostGis.

I succeed to build a Oracle 18c Express edition Docker image using Oracle
specific instructions [1]. I would like to push this image in a Docker
Hub (QGIS one?, an another one?) so it could be use from CI.

According to this license agreement [2], it looks like this is legally OK:
"We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use the
programs for: (a) purposes of developing, prototyping and running your
applications for your own internal data processing operations;"

Do I have a good understanding of the license agreement? Do you see any
reason to not enable Oracle tests in our CI?

To be complete, it would be probably necessary to copy QGIS Oracle
database files somewhere (like it's done for ccache) to be used at run
time in order to skip Oracle database initialisation. It's quite long (around 5
minutes) and would slow down the CI.

I'd be in favor to keep the Dockerfile under the git repo so there is no
diversion from the different branches we have the tests running on Travis.
Otherwise, you'd have to push the Dockerfile per branch (similarly than
what we do for qgis3-buill-deps)

The ccache files are kepts in Travis cache.
I guess you can fire up your Oracle database when tests are started (or
even before QGIS is built) and there would be enough time for it to init.

Thanks for looking into this.

Just a warning - you'll also need to look into the license for the OCI
client and whether there's any issues in enabling this on Travis.

I'm not a lawyer but I don't see anything in instant client license
agreement
(https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/instant-client-lic.html)
about limitations on using OCI on server.

They just protect themselves from GPL contamination. Anyway, we already
deliver the oracle provider in OSGeo4W installer, so I would say we are
fine.

I didn't mean to keep Dockerfile to build Oracle image in QGIS git
repo. I mean to push the built image in DockerHub so we don't have to
build it when running tests. Like it's done for PostGIs if IRRC.

Message-ID: <CADsfgKMxvGYMTC7AiY=2hzYxJ5ztQedhZdyUq9ECbq9V-GgoWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Recently I have uploaded the experimental version of my Plugin, While
stable version is visible, *experimental version* is not visible in *'manage
and install plugins*'. I have enabled support for experimental version.
Below is the details:

Plugin name: QRealTime
Stable Plugin version : 3.8
Experimental Plugin version: 3.9
QGIS version:3.8.3
OS tried: Ubuntu 18.04

Is this a bug or I am doing some mistake?
If it is a bug I would be happy to raise issue and contribute in fixing.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Method selectedFeatures() works too slow in QGIS 3
	Python console
Message-ID: <1571904201613-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I loaded spatial table(about 100 millions rows) from PostgreSQL(PostGIS)
in QGIS3 and use method *selectedFeatures()* in *QGIS 3* *Python console*.
For such big tables it work very slow (it takes up to 10 minutes). 
I tried to use * getSelectedFeatures()* which works more faster but returns
only iterator (not a copy of selected features as previous method). Further
work with iterator take too much time too(it takes up to 10 minutes).
In QGIS 2 these methods work much more faster(several seconds).

How can I solve this problem? I want to get copy of selected data for
several seconds.
Is this a bug or I am doing some wrong?

POSTGIS="2.5.1 r17027"
PostgreSQL 11.1 (Ubuntu 11.1-1.pgdg18.04+1)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error trying to import linear_model from sklearn
	in Qgis
Message-ID: <CAG5PEm9=gRLWM_-7-zDKZtTfW3sZvyaairRj-tWtn9E1Ag9CaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I don't know if this is a bug in Qgis or it happens only to me.

The linear_model from sklearn works perfectly outside Qgis, but when I try
to import that library inside python shell in Qgis it's not possible:

To reproduce the error is just when you import the library like this:
from sklearn import linear_model

The error:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

Does anyone have the same problem? any ideas?

(using Qgis 3.8.3, sklearn 0.21.3, python 3.7.4 and Archlinux)

Even though it works fine on my local (QGIS 3.8.3, Mac, Python 3.7, sklearn
0.21.3), I often encountered that error, most of the time related to floats
operation (e.g np.float32 not JSON serializable)

Python Console

Message-ID: <DB7PR05MB57869F0F18B1CD491843C22BE5650@DB7PR05MB5786.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

I realised that in the QGIS 3.9.0-Master 94fa3c44e0<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/94fa3c44e0> compiled version the grass plugin is not existing.
So that I cannot inport vector or raster stored in my grassdatabase (mapsets),
moreover some others grass features seems to be missing.

In the configuration stage I set:


  *   GRASS_INCLUDE_DIR7   /usr/lib/grass76/include
  *   GRASS_PREFIX7               /usr/lib/grass76

Please consider I'm in Ubuntu 19.04 and the installed grass is at version 7.6.0 (from .deb).
Any hints?

Thanks,

Eugenio

+1 on not using Google Analytics to spy on users. You can analyse the 
Apache logs using various tools pretty easily to discover things like 
how people got to the web-pages, and which pages are most commonly 
accessed, and even see where in the world folks are.

I can run the logs through one of the tools if you want.

Hi all,
I just compiled a fresh 3.10, and I cannot find the new News panel at
startup. What is its current status?
Thanks.

Same for me in 3.10 and it seems also gone in qgis-master. In the 
settings the "show qgis newsfeed" option is checked.

Maybe there is no news??

Hi Raymond,

You can confirm it by yourself. Just open https://feed.qgis.org/ and you
will see the entire news feed.

Best regards,

Jorge

Thank you Etienne.  I did just what you suggested. But did not het
anywhere.  I still get the same error message.

My question did not get resolved and only for lack of information i can't
move forward with the upgrade.
What i think has happened is that QGIS leadership has chosen to control the
access gates to "ousiders" who want to program in C++ and related
functiions in producing plugins by controlling how plugins are registered.

It is a pity that I can't upgrade this plugin for lack of information.

In the past i have donated money and willing to donate time and money.
Whay is there so much secrecy on the basic C++ plugin initialization and
registry?  It does not make for a good and inclusive  policy.

Thank for your help anyway.

There's no conspiracy here -- rather, c++ plugins have always been
horrible to build, deploy and debug (especially on Windows). Over time
the core project recognised this, realised it was a bad situation for
developers like yourself, and started encouraging people to completely
avoid using c++ plugins and move to Python wherever possible.

I strongly suspect that the reason no-one has answered your question
is just because no-one **knows** the answer! (I certainly don't -- I
saw your earlier thread, and the only advice I was able to offer at
the time was what Etienne had already suggested).

Nyall ,  Thank you for your response.
 I heard that argument before and replied  by saying that i had tried
Python and the program was too slow for the application i was working on
(data structures and storage) and that was my main reason to use C++.  But
i was told that i need to learn more Python and be a better programmer etc
...

 I felt i was completely ignored. At that time  i was able to do it on my
own becuase there was a lot more private activity.  I think now QGIS has
almost become corporate and there is some hesitation to share information
(not knowledge) unless a transaction happens.

  In my opinion this has become a barrier to innovate.

Thank you again,

.

Sorry.  That's nonsense.  There shouldn't be any information missing.  You have
the full QGIS code and you even know C++.  UTSL.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] help needed for QgsMapToolEmitPoint
Message-ID: <ff9f744e-b989-c370-37f3-b15beb2a39ba@gmx.de>

Hello!

I try to develop some Python modules for construction in landsurveying 
projects. Therefore these tools must be able to snap to existiing 
vertices in a map. I found a class,which snaps to existing vertices, 
settings are taken from qgis, which uses QgsMapToolEmitPoint

class ShowOnMapTool(QgsMapToolEmitPoint):

     def __init__(self, iface, *PointXY*):
         QgsMapToolEmitPoint.__init__(self, iface.mapCanvas())
         self.iface = iface
         self.canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
         self.marker = None
         self.vertex = None
*self.rtnPoint = PointXY*

...

     def canvasPressEvent(self, event):
         '''Capture the coordinate when the mouse button has been released,
         format it, and copy it to the clipboard.'''
         self.*rtnPoint* = self.snappoint(event.originalPixelPoint())
         self.removeVertexMarker()

         if self.marker is None:
             self.marker = QgsVertexMarker(self.canvas)
             self.marker.setIconSize(18)
             self.marker.setPenWidth(2)
             self.marker.setIconType(QgsVertexMarker.ICON_CROSS)
         self.marker.setCenter(*self.rtnPoint*)

...

In my form I want to use the snapped coordinates in textboxes. Therefore 
I added the rtnPoint in the init-procedere and in the 
canvasPressEvent-Function listed above.

In my own class I did this:

class InputMeasurepoints:
     def __init__(self, iface):
         self.iface = iface
         self.plugin_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
         locale = QSettings().value('locale/userLocale')[0:2]
         locale_path = os.path.join(
             self.plugin_dir,
             'i18n',
             'InputMeasurepoints_{}.qm'.format(locale))

         if os.path.exists(locale_path):
             self.translator = QTranslator()
             self.translator.load(locale_path)
QCoreApplication.installTranslator(self.translator)

         self.actions = []
         self.menu = self.tr(u'&SurveyingTools')
         self.first_start = None
         self.canvas = iface.mapCanvas()
*        self.Point=QgsPointXY() **
**        self.ShowMapTool = ShowOnMapTool(self.iface,self.Point)*

         self.marker = None
         self.vertex = None

...

     def onMouseClick(self,button):
         self.dlg.ledt_Rechts.setText(format("%.3f" 
%*self.ShowMapTool.rtnPoint.x()*))
         self.dlg.ledt_Hoch.setText(format("%.3f" 
%*self.ShowMapTool.rtnPoint.y()*))

     def getPoint(self):
         self.canvas.setMapTool(self.ShowMapTool)
self.ShowMapTool.canvasClicked.connect(self.onMouseClick)

     def run(self):
         if self.first_start == True:
             self.first_start = False
             self.dlg = InputMeasurepointsDialog()
             self.dlg.btnPickXY.clicked.connect(self.getPoint)

Nothing happens, the Programm does not reach the onMouseClick-Function, 
and the ShowMapTool does not stop. How can I get the rtnPoint of the 
ShowOnMapTool-Class, what is wrong? I found no example Code in the web, 
I do not understand how QgsMapToolEmitPoint and the Mouse events work 
together. Is there any document with simple examples?

Thank you for investing your time in a stupid beginner like me!

In complete honesty, you're totally misreading the situation. There's
nothing malicious or hidden going on here at all. It's entirely the
fact that c++ plugins, especially on windows, are a PITA to develop
and a totally lottery as to whether they'll work. The only assistance
the project is **able** to provide has already been provided -- "avoid
c++ plugins"!

My personal thoughts: I would LOVE nothing more than to be able to
help people like yourself with problems like this, and donate 3-4
hours of my time to helping you fix your local Windows build and get
things working for you. (There's absolutely no sarcasm here, I really
mean that). I wish society was structured in such a way as to make
this possible. But the world just doesn't work that way, and there's
**nothing** that the QGIS project or the people involved with it can
do to change that. So your only options here are:
1. ask for help, which you've already done, and unfortunately no-one
has an answer for you. Maybe you could "widen the net" and try asking
on other channels outside of this mailing list and stackexchange, and
hopefully find someone who has previously solved this problem.
2. (as Jürgen stated) push through and find the solution for yourself
-- the source is all available and obviously have some development
skills to help here.
3. follow the (unfortunate? unfair?) process society has evolved to
get others to do work for you, and pay someone to find a solution to
your build issue.

I think we should publish a short "welcome to QGIS 3.10" article
(ideally when the change log is ready), so that we've got something to
show on first load?

I suspect something has changed in how your tables are indexed or in
how QGIS is detecting and using this index. If you've got access to
the database logs it would be useful to compare the queries sent by
QGIS 3 vs 2.

Tjank you Nyall, i have already been able to build C++ QGIS , the only
thing i can't do right now is get a new plugin to be registered within the
UI.  It has become a secret art like magic to do this.

I am bemoaning the lack of user guidance here.  I will write one once i get
through this. I plan to put at least  one example  code on how to generate
a stub plugin.
I cleaned all the compile errors, and there an obscure message on some
fumction that i don't  even have in my plugin that is coming up during
compile.  I am compiling only my plugin separately.
  I used a simple UI (i am not new to UI's in C++ as i have done several
more complex ones before.

Thank you for your kindness though.  And i will touch base more.

Blessings and Happy All Hallows Eve.

rest assured QGIS is and will be as open as ever.
Do you have evidence supporting your statement (I must say, a pretty
harsh one)? Please avoid spreading FUD over one of the most open and
democratic projects available.
All best wishes.

Message-ID: <CAMCJChvzne0su8rv8oKLrJ2tC1yf=sh2mZXi6f4ubtmSS-wLVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

After updating to QGIS 3.10 with OSGeo4W 64bits (Windows 10), after the
start I get these red warnings:

Qt: QFont::setPointSize: Point size

Qt: Qt WebEngine seems to be initialized from a plugin. Please set
Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts using QCoreApplication::setAttribute before
constructing QGuiApplication.

Qt: libpng warning: iCCP: cHRM chunk does not match sRGB

My environment:

Message-ID: <f7e08c11-cdef-4458-6715-a622d990f3f4@faunalia.it>

[apologizes for cross posting]
Hi all,
QGIS.ORG is looking for an Editor ensuring timely and complete changelog
for every new version of QGIS.
What we ask:
* for each version, at the onset of the code freeze period, go through
the [FEATURE] commits in the code repository since last version
* copy paste the short description from the commit, adding some text and
if appropriate a screenshot to have an entry understandable by users;
this will be done in coordination with the original author of the
feature, and with his help where and when necessary.
What you get:
* full recognition of your work: the Changelog will have a line "edited by".
Ideally the appointment would be for one year or more. This is a
volunteer position.
Please send your candidature, ask details etc., directly to my address.
Thanks in advance.

Hi Tim,

I have restarted my QGIS 3.10 several times, but I still couldn't see the
Welcome Message or the news panel. I have enabled "Show QGIS news feed on
welcome page" and set the Welcome Page on the project launch.

I only see the "recent project" and "project template" panel in the
beginning.

Thanks!

Best regards.

Hm - I seem to have the same issue. Once the "News feed" is disabled I
can't seem to get it back. Regardless of the setting in the "Options"
--> "General" --> "Show QGIS news feed on welcome pate" dialogue. 

That part of the start screen never comes back. 

There is something odd with the news feed section on the start screen.

Hi

I just did a fresh install of QGIS 3.10 and it works for me. I will tried toggling the feed off, closing QGIS, opening it, toggling, on, restarting. All worked fine for me (on macOS). Maybe it is a Linux specific issue?

Andreas maybe you can try manually editing settings in your profile to see if it comes back when you remove the flag there?


Regards

Tim

Hi, 

Hm - maybe there is a difference on "how you turn the news panel off". I
tried with a new empty profile and it is the same behaviour like on my
default profile. Once I press the little "x" icon on the top right of
the news panel, there is no way to turn it back on. 

On the other hand, if you go to "Settings" --> "Options" --> "General"
and use that option to toggle visibility of the News Panel, then I can
really turn it on and off as expected. 

So, the culprit seems to be the littel "x" Icon on the top right of the
News Panel. Once, you use, that, the news panel is gone for good. No
easy way to get it back.

fully agreed. Tim already prepared something, probably good to start
from that?

Hi

Oh but that little X is for the news item itself. It means ‘I’ve read this, don’t show it to me again’ if I understand Alessandro’s design intent correctly….

Oh - perhaps the news panel is not opening if there is no news that
wasn't read yet? That would be a bit strange, UI wise. 

I think we would have to rethink how the client part of the news panel
works. The current behavior that there is no way ever to go back to that
news item once you close it through the "X" of that individual news
item, is a bit strange. Apparently, I am not the only one who got
"trapped" by this behavior.

fully agreed. Tim already prepared something, probably good to start
from that?

Yes it only shows if there is news to read

I think this behaviour is consistent with how other apps do it. I remember visual studio used to have (still has?) a feature like this and ones you dispatched news items, they never came back. That’s not to say we couldn’t add a toggle that lets you reset your feed history somewhere I guess..

Ok, 

Maybe, we just have to get used to this behavior, if this is, how other
apps do it ... Still strange though to me. 

One issue though: what happens, if we revise the content of the news
entry, just like we just did? Then the user has no chance in reading
that revised version.

The current behavior that there is no way ever to go back to that news item once you close it through the "X" of that individual news item, is a bit strange. Apparently, I am not the only one who got "trapped" by this behavior.

I understand the logic now, but still I'm with Andreas: better to force
news back when the panel is switched on.

Message-ID: <041A60C3-9FB8-4440-8CD9-36A2C445879E@kartoza.com>

Hi Folks

I have been working my way through the changelog entries for 3.10, trying to add suitable images. Great work everyone involved in adding all those nice new features! I do have a couple of queries though:

—————————————————


http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.10/#scale_value-variable

Feature: @scale_value variable
  
Add @scale_value expression variable for use when evaluating data defined text format properties while rendering scale bar text. Allows for per-label customisation of the text format inside scale bars

@Nyall I can’t seem to find options for this in layout window, nor do I see the variable in the expression editor.


—————————————————

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.10/#improved-svg-layered-exports

Improved SVG layered exports - any more hints on this & how we can show it visually (if at all)?


———————————


Feature: Improved PostGIS raster support
  
Now available via the browser and the Data Source Manager dialog.

This feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti


@Ale - do you have any more info on this? I am wondering how it compares to the features offered in Jorge’s plugin here: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/raster2postgis/ and if it makes the latter unnecessary now?

Thanks Tim! For taking care of this.

Let me know whey you think we are 'done', then I will do the rst export,
put it in the site, and make it translatable by pushing it to Transifex.

I now put the placeholder site in qgis.org [0])

So plz ping me when "ready". Is this weekend feasible?

Hi Tim,

A few weeks ago I accidentally hit this one (I think). Before, the 
layers in an exported svg file were called "layer 1", "layer 2", etc and 
now they contain the name of a layer.

This is making a customer of mine very happy, cause she uses the export 
in Illustrator.

Regards,
Raymond

I don't follow this completely. How is a user supposed to know that he 
will need to re-enable an item because it has been revised?

If we don't get things right on first public release, I think we have to 
live with the fact that some people will have never read this revised 
version.


I have no objections against having the possibility to reenable read 
items, but I think we overestimate the importance because we tend to 
look at it from a publisher/debugging and not an average user perspective.


All the best, Matthias

Hi,

I will still add the bug-fix list from our Google Spreadsheet. It will 
be done until tomorrow evening.

Sorry, I've no idea about what that plugin does, what I did was exposing
existing PG rasters from the  PG provider source select dialog and browser
data items, GDAL is used to do the real loading of the rasters.

the plugin allows uploading local rasters to a remote db. We are still
revising implementation details.

Message-ID: <737d1046-92c9-7960-f009-51062525b4b1@duif.net>

Hi,

Having a data set (gpkg) with 'seconds since epoch/1970' column, I
thought it would be easy to create a DateTime column from that using the
Field Calculator.

Am I right to conclude that that is missing (that you can only use
'QDatetime.fromString'-string expressions)?
Because if so I will try to add it :-)

Any other ideas?

Else I will just use sql in the geopackage to create a iso-time string
from it, and will then use the Field calculator ...

Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks Richard….I am contemplating whether to make screens for all this processing ALGS….I think I will do that then will be done from my side (and I will add the description for the SVG exporter that Raymond kindly supplied). I will pop you a note when I have done that.

Regards

Tim

Cool - can we drag & drop images into PG using the browser too?

Yes I think you are right - we (==me :-) ) just need to be careful when publishing news items, or unpublish and publish a new item if we want to make corrections….

Hi list -

During a university lecture about QGIS and licensing (GPL) I got a 
question about QGIS projects.

Can a project be copyrighted or licensed differently from QGIS ? We are 
not talking about plugins - they are always under the same license af 
QGIS, namely GPL.

But what about the QGIS projects ? Same license or copyrigt af QGIS 
itself. Or what ??

Hi Bo, 

Please don't tell me that your students or you have the idea/impression
that the license of QGIS (as a software) propagates to the data you edit
with this software? This is a comlete nonsense and I don't know who
started with this rumor. 

For some strange reasons I have heard this idea before and I wonder if
some trolls from proprietary software companies who dislike OpenSource
distribute this FUD? If this discussion were about elections I would say
that this idea originates from Putins troll factory. 

If this would be the case, then Adobe or Microsoft would own copyright
to all documents their users edit. 

The copyright of the QGIS project files or any data you edit with QGIS
is totally independent from the license itself and it is the sole
decision of the author of the data. Of course, if you get the data you
work with from someone else, their license terms apply as well. 

Please help to get rid of this strange idea! 

Andreas

The GPL license mostly sets constraints about redistribution, not use. So 
whatever your produce with QGIS, data, projects, styles, etc you can decide 
freely what you do with it: public domain, open data, or whatever license you 
see fit (*)

This is covered by the official GPL FAQ:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLOutput
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatCaseIsOutputGPL

Even

(*) if your projects deals with other people data, then the constraints of 
that data might have consequence on your project, but that doesn't come from 
QGIS itself.

Hi Bo Victor,

I would say a QGIS project (file) is *content* you create with QGIS and 
not code. And therefore not GPL licensed.

You can also write a top secret letter using LibreOffice, right?

Just my thoughts, didn't look this up in the license text.

Raymond

Thanks Even for this clear explanation. 

We've been at this discussion before. Suddenly some journal publishers
started to refuse submissions when parts of the content (e.g. images,
maps, etc.) was created/generated from QGIS. I don't know who came up
with this strange idea that the license from the software propagates to
the content produced with the software.

Thanks to Raymond, Evan and Andreas for the fast answers..

  * A QGIS project is*content *and not code, therefore it is not under
    the GPL regime and can be copyrighted/licensed differently from GPL.

  * As an open source developer and  a user of PostgreSQL/PostGIS for
    many years, I'm 100% aware how GPL works regarding content and code:
    created content using a GPL program is *not* under GPL, derivative
    works of code is. (So Andreas, don't worry, be happy ;-).

It was simply how to regard QGIS projects: It is content or is it code ?

A very small nibble: What about python code embedded in the project ?

Hi Dev List,
I'm facing to QWebView issues after upgrading to QGIS 3.10 under Windows
(Linux seems not affected) that prevent some plugins from regular execution
(go2streetview, go2mapillary, Qgis2Threejs). I already submitted to issue
track: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32507 , have issue reports from
other users and personally checked on my machine but  @minorua does not
confirm: https://github.com/minorua/Qgis2threejs/issues/191
so I ask if anyone could verify or suggest a fix
Thanks.
Enrico.

Good - I am happy and relieved now ;-)

Definitely content

That is a good question where I don't know the answer. It might be
subject to the GPL license - but not sure. I would be interested to hear
other people's opinion on this particular case.

Huh, that becomes involved... In all logic, conveying code through a .py file 
or a .qgz doesn't change the fact that it is code, so I'd expect licensing 
rules to also apply to it. So if that Python code uses QGIS API, it is 
probably to be under the GPL (but that only affects those code snippets, not 
the rest of the project).

Right, but, by distributing a project .QGS I'm basically distributing the
sources, and that satisfies one of the most important obligations of the
GPL (even if it is zipped in a .QGZ, the sources are just one
click/shell-command away).

Even if I wanted to distribute my project with another license, I would be
still distributing the source code with it.

The same applies to python code snippets embedded in a project.

Another good example of where QGIS.org being able to add a one-liner addendum to our license permitting projects (including the Python code they contain) to be distributed under any license you like would be extremely useful.

To carry on the previous analogy, this is equivalent to having a LibreOffice document with macros in it that you want to sell as part of your secret plan to become a millionaire….I don’t think anyone will come and wave a GPL license at you if you do this….

Here's a dumb screencast showing how to access it: https://imgur.com/a/NAVYwQ5

You need to go into the scale bar font settings, and set a
data-defined value somewhere

I think the text is all ready to go now. (Is this the quickest we've

Sorry, delayed response here.

Yes, Tim is correct -- the X dismisses individual news items only.
Then intention here is that users can dismiss items as they read them,
or leave them to later to read. If a news item expires (it has an
expiry date set on the server side) it will automatically self-dismiss
after this time (e.g. no point in leaving an entry for an event which
has occurred, even if the user hasn't dismissed this item themselves).

The panel will **only** show if there's something to show. Otherwise,
the project templates panel gets the space. I don't see value in
showing an empty section, and:

1. showing an empty news feed section will make us appear a
"ghost"/"dying" project
2. showing the panel only when there's news means that users get a
immediate "oh something is different here" moment on launching qgis,
and are more likely to read the news item (vs a panel which is always
shown, usually empty, and which sometimes has content) (that's my gut
feeling at least, I'm not a UX expert!)

I can't remember if it was a public discussion, but I did at least
discuss this with Alessandro somewhere :P

The thoughts were:

1. If a minor fix is made (e.g. spelling or formatting correction),
then we don't want to re-show that news item for any user who has
already read and dismissed it. On the backend this means you just edit
the existing item without publishing a new one.
2. if it's a big retraction (e.g. wrong date for a conference), then
we should publish an explicit retraction/errata notice, so that users
who have previously read the news item will be explicitly informed
that they've been mis-informed!

Message-ID: <1572509613213-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

In trying to use v.net.centrality I get the error "Sorry, <points> is not a
valid parameter"

I have tried several settings when running but keep on getting this error -
cannot figure out from where the word <points> origins - it must be
something internal in the script as I am not using this word.

Data sample is here:  Poi.zip

I have no idea what this function does, but when trying with your data
on 3.10 on Linux without any default parameter changes, it first
complains about a wrong output type, because in the advanced parameters,
there is no output type selected by default. Switching this to auto
gives a resulting point layer.

Cheers,
Bernd

Great thanks - I had already conjured up a shot after knowing what to look for. I updated the text to include a link to your blog article.

Hmm anything special I need to do? I have a test db with pgraster supported:



When I try to drop a geotiff into I I get:

Failed to import some layers!

Yes you need to chose an output type yourself, but nomatter what I choose I
get the same error message.

I am running on windows and no matter what Grass procedure I run I get this

Do not know what it means or whether it is relevant in this case?

According to https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/309445 this warning is
raised by default it seems.

I have made v.net.centrality run in QGIS 2.18 without any problems - even
though the setup is a little different in 2.18 as you do not need to provide
a point layer and you unfortunately cannot add costs on the network.

Hi all,
apparently our server does not expose the metadata stored in the project
and layer properties:
* is this true?
* is there any reason for this, besides the usual lack of resources to
implement it?
* anyone has estimates or plans to implement it?
Moreover, I wonder how users are managing their metadata from QGIS, now
that several plugins that helped compiling them are not available for
current versions. Any feedback will be appreciated.
Cheers.

There is a metadata section in the server configuration (Service
Capabilities) of the project properties, modeled on WMS/WFS metadata, they
are exposed. The sad thing is that when the new metadata framework was
developed it was not connected with the existing server metadata, so we
currently have two separate APIs for metadata, the old very limited one for
the server and the new one. On the other hand, the old existing API is
exactly what was required by WMS/WFS.

Not that I'm aware of.

I though about it for WFS3 but I couldn't find the time/resources to do
anything (mainly because of missing API in the server), for now I've just
implemented what was available in the server's WFS code.

Thanks Ale for the explanation. Indeed, a suboptimal situation.
Perhaps worth an ad hoc crowdfunding.
Cheers.

For Python it's entirely feasible to put pycsw atop the metadata, and
was discussed as
as approach as part of the QGIS metadata strategy / planning.

Thanks Tom,

but I think Paolo was referring to expose QGIS metadata in a
GetCapabilities response, this is (and must be) handled directly by QGIS
server without any other software stack.

IMO what is missing here is a bridge between the new metadata API in QGIS
core and the "old" QGIS server metadata API.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 3.10 Changelog good to go (well very nearly)
Message-ID: <5899DAA7-C406-4BBE-93EE-E041F4D3F378@kartoza.com>

Hi All

I’ve taken a last pass through the changelog, added one or two more images, and I think we are good to go after Andreas adds the sponsored bug fix summary (I can do this too if needed Andreas if you are short on time).

And for those who were annoyed by the Disqus spammy ads at the bottom of the changelog site, our beloved Projecta code maintainer, Anita Hapsari, has now disabled the Disqus integration. That means no more spammy article links, but also (for now) no facility to chat about the changelog on the web site.

Regards

Tim

It was always a deliberate choice to keep these two separate. The
thinking was that the metadata you use for your local projects and
layers isn't necessarily going to match what you want to publish and
advertise to external users. You might have sensitive information in
there, or just "internal only" details which you don't want/need to
publish.

I think all that's missing here is a button to auto-populate server
metadata by copying it from the project or layer metadata. It'd give a
quick way to initial populate the published metadata, which you could
then tweak as needed...
