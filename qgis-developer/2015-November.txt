Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add multiple frames to a composer attribute table
	using PyQGIS
Message-ID: <CAAfMyG19SX1ma5ehao5edG7yqTc8DRBo94n2KTCAeC-pRmMjjg@mail.gmail.com>

I have an attribute table that is around two hundred rows of data (but only
two columns wide). I would like to add an attribute table to a composer
with this data, and to do this I need to add multiple frames so I can add
the whole attribute table to one page. Doing this manually in the composer
I just add 5 frames side by side to one composer page, and I manage to get
all my data on one page.

I cannot figure out how to add an attribute table with multiple frames to a
composer using PyQGIS. I am problably missing something really obvious, but
I am stuck here.

When I try to define a QgsComposerFrame, I am told that I must specify the
QgsComposerMultiFrame it belongs to:

QgsComposerFrame
<http://qgis.org/api/classQgsComposerFrame.html#ab645cf6db9a1285a6983e05541f2d28f>
 (QgsComposition <http://qgis.org/api/classQgsComposition.html> *c,
QgsComposerMultiFrame
<http://qgis.org/api/classQgsComposerMultiFrame.html> *mf,
qreal x <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qgraphicsitem.html#x>, qreal y
<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qgraphicsitem.html#y>, qreal width, qreal height)

How do I create the QgsComposerMultiFrame. It is an abstract class, I am
told that it is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated. If I try

multiFrame = QgsComposerMultiFrame(myCompositionTable, False)

I get the following error when I run my code.

qgis._core.QgsComposerMultiFrame represents a C++ abstract class and cannot
be instantiated

I cant find any documentation or examples on how to do this. So if someone
could shed some light on this it would be most appreciated. I am happy to
write up a bit of documentation once I have managed to do this.

Many thanks,

James

You create a QgsComposerAttributeTableV2 instead, which derives from
QgsComposerMultiFrame. Here's some c++ code which does this, which
should be pretty straightforward to translate to Python:


mComposerAttributeTable = new QgsComposerAttributeTableV2(
mComposition, false );
mComposition->addMultiFrame( mComposerAttributeTable );

mFrame1 = new QgsComposerFrame( mComposition, mComposerAttributeTable,
5, 5, 100, 30 );
mFrame2 = new QgsComposerFrame( mComposition, mComposerAttributeTable,
5, 40, 100, 30 );

mComposerAttributeTable->addFrame( mFrame1 );
mComposerAttributeTable->addFrame( mFrame2 );

mComposition->addComposerTableFrame( mComposerAttributeTable, mFrame1 );
mComposition->addComposerTableFrame( mComposerAttributeTable, mFrame2 );

mComposerAttributeTable->setVectorLayer( mVectorLayer );
mComposerAttributeTable->setDisplayOnlyVisibleFeatures( false );
mComposerAttributeTable->setMaximumNumberOfFeatures( 10 );
mComposerAttributeTable->setContentFont( QgsFontUtils::getStandardTestFont() );
mComposerAttributeTable->setHeaderFont( QgsFontUtils::getStandardTestFont() );
mComposerAttributeTable->setBackgroundColor( Qt::yellow );

When in doubt for something like this and you can't find any examples
online, a good last resort to check is in the QGIS unit tests:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/tests/src
(or in this case
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/core/testqgscomposertablev2.cpp)

They are filled with minimal test cases such as this which are useful
for seeing how various classes are intended to be used.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Finishing multithreading support in QGIS Processing
Message-ID: <1667c7cdf9a573c5334da7ed566358cf@carto.net>

 

Hi processing developers, 

I wonder what is necessary to finish and integrate the work that has
been done regarding multi-threading support in QGIS processing? I mean
the GSOC project. 

I think it is important to finish this soon. We had similar situations
in the past - and if we don't finish this soon we may loose our chance
to integrate this in master - or it will be much harder. 

Who would like to continue working on this? 

I am pretty sure we could fund this through QGIS.ORG. If we have a
proposal/estimate how much work it takes to finish it, we can discuss
this on the QGIS.ORG board and make a decision. 

So - if you as a developer - are interested in finishing this, please
inform us and provide us an estimate. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Agreed. As mentioned by Victor, better do it when we have a good testing suite in place.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A common set of functions for QGIS plugins
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7x-Y9em0cwwkKz1z=HbdXtPDk=uC6FUqqdqGHgN0=EfrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We have discussed sometimes in here about the need of having some
common functions for plugin developers, to avoid all plugins having to
reimplement those functions, sometimes not in the most correct way. It
will also bring some homogeneity to plugins, which I think it is a
good thing.

With the changes that will be coming to QGIS soon, I think this is a
good idea to work on, and I have started a small project here to
create a set of Python modules with those common functions.

https://github.com/volaya/qgiscommons

Not much yet, but I plan to work on that and make it grow during this
week. With the Hackfest coming, I think it is a good time to ask other
devs to contribute...

May plan of action is as follows:

- Work on implementing a comprehensive set of functions and classes,
hopefully with the help of other devs

- Adapt Processing to use it and replace the current set of utilities
that Processing (like many plugins) has.

- Create a QEP to elevate this set of functions and classes to the
qgis.utils module, so it has more visibility and it becomes a part of
QGIS core.

Following this, I believe the next steps that we could take could be:

- Documenting this clearly in the PyCookbook, so all devs are aware of this.

- Enforcing the use of common functions and classes, and even request
it before a plugin is accepted for publishing


Since we will be transitioning to Qt5/Python3, this set of common
functions sounds also like a good place to add all kinds of utilities
that might help this migration for existing plugins.

Let me know your thoughts

Even if you cannot contribute the code of a function to the repo, feel
free to open an issue recommending functions that you consider should
be in there. I will be working on this and will implement all those
ideas if they sound interesting and useful for other people


Thanks in advance

Yes, and also the other way round, the cookbook may already contain many
useful snippets for common patterns that could go into utils functions.

I see this a bit more complicated, unless we don't want to review the code
of each plugin by hand, I cannot think of a way to catch the pieces of code
that DO NOT use the common utils.

Thank you for bringing this project to the attention of the list.

We have a similar library for our internal company plugins (some soon to be
made public) that we include as a git submodule to save code duplication.
Lots of simple stuff, but also some obvious missing API and functions, like
map tools that snap (am I ever glad to see that as public api in 2.12!).
See https://github.com/lparchaeology/libarkqgis.

I'm in two minds as to whether it would be a good thing to have an
'official' one. While I can see the use, surely if these things are useful
then they should be included in the mainline API with proper API
guarantees? I'm not sure I'd want to rely on a library that doesn't have an
API guarantee, and if you're making the guarantee then why not in core? If
they are *required* for a plugin to be accepted, then they must be in core
and have an API guarantee.

John.

My ideas is definitely to put this into core (that's what I wrote in
my email when i detailed the plans that i have for this), but I have
started it as a separate repo to make it easier to collaborate and to
start moving ASAP.

I could write a QEP with this idea, get it approved, throw a bunch of
empty py modules in qgis.utils and then start working, but I like to
first do some work, get people into it, and then do the bureucracy to
pass this to core (I am sure no one will say no to this once a nice
collection of functions is ready)

I will wait for other people to voice their opinion, and if most
people agree on going taht other way, I have nothing against it

Hey Victor,

Working on the same kind of thing over here:
https://github.com/NathanW2/parfait

IMO I would rather see a new module and not put it in qgis.utils.
Something like qgis.py or qgis.wrappers or something like that that.

Hey Nathan

I knew about your project...but forgot about it :-) Sorry for that.

What would you suggest doing? merging them maybe? I like that idea. In
the end, the plan is just to have a sandbox to add those functions and
eventually move them to core (btw, qgis.py sounds good to me...)

I can make a PR to your repo if you think it is a good idea, and we
keep on working there.

Let me know also if you have ideas about what to add to fill those
modules with useful stuff

Cheers!

Hey Victor,

Just added you with write access to my project if you want.  I don't really
mind if you wanted to work on the same one together.  My motivations were
the same as you in the end.  Mainly just flesh something out in a sandbox
and then we can add it to core once we have it nutted out.

Regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Any processing folks interested in pairing with a
	new QGIS developer?
Message-ID: <2F93AE09-A20C-479C-AAFA-575DDB54A688@gmail.com>

Hello!

I’m dipping my toes into the code behind the processing toolkit. In particular, I’m interested in improving the Vector tools in the processing toolkit.

I am an experienced developer, but have spent most of the last decade writing web software. I’m making some progress, but not feeling very productive so far. When getting involved with new client projects, I find it really productive to pair with a developer who’s more familiar with the project. I’ve never tried this with an OSS project before, but are there any QGIS developers working on the processing module who are willing to mentor me by letting me remotely sit in with them on a programming session? I can be flexible so as to accommodate your schedule and programming style.

I feel that a couple of hours of your time would save me many days of orientation, while not costing you much. In fact, I’ve found a pair programmer improves my productivity even when the person I’m working with is completely unfamiliar with the project. Think of me as a sentient linter ;)

I typically use mostly shell tools (vim+tmux) for remote terminal and google hangouts for voice/video and occasional desktop sharing, but will use whatever you prefer.

Thanks for any support!

regards,
Michael Kirk

Hi Michael,

If you haven't yet, you might be able to get an overview of the whole
framework by reading Victor Olaya's and my paper on Processing:
http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/4/2219

Best wishes

Hey Michael

I will be happy to help on that. To start with, I would propose a
quick hangout to discuss the Processing architecture (reading the
paper Anita mentioned beforehand will help). What time zone are you
in? I am on Paris one (GMT + 1)

Hello Victor,

A definite +1 on this.
Also maybe a parent QGISPlugin class all plugins would inherit from ?

As a side note on plugin, but important, Hugo intends at the hackfest to
propose and discuss having plugins be Python modules, so that we can use
PIP to deal with module and plugins dependencies.
This would solve this problem and let us use common Python tools, be it
on the plugin side, or the module management side, and ease packaging
also for the distributions.

Hi Nyall,

Thanks very much for the advice. It is working now.

That was an excellent tip about checking the unit tests.

This is a good idea, and it would be easy to modify the Plugin Builder
plugin to generate plugin skeletons using that class

Sounds good as well. In case you do a small meeting for discussing
that (and also with other meetings that might happen), could it be
possibel to participate via skype/google hangout?

Hello Victor,

A definite +1 on this.
Also maybe a parent QGISPlugin class all plugins would inherit from ?

As a side note on plugin, but important, Hugo intends at the hackfest to
propose and discuss having plugins be Python modules, so that we can use
PIP to deal with module and plugins dependencies.
This would solve this problem and let us use common Python tools, be it
on the plugin side, or the module management side, and ease packaging
also for the distributions.

Hello all,


probably you just know, but I found that "PluginBuilder"  plugin for QGIS
writes at line 26  of the main  .py  file the following code:


import resources


I think this is wrong,  because in run it returns a python error.


The correct code is:


import resources_rc


I hope this helps to create new and useful plugins .


Thank you in advance for attention

Roberto

​Hi Roberto,
Afaik, the plugin builder code is not wrong. You just have to adjust the
name of the output file when compiling the resources.
Best wishes,

Hi Roberto,

I've had this issue also some time ago, but according to Gary it should
be fixed:

https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/issues/34

Note off course that plugins build with an older version of the builder
still will have the problem.
If you still have this problem with a current plugin, please report back
at the issuelist at Github

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I have the following qwt packages installed: 

libqwt-headers

libqwt-qt5-6

libqwt5-qt4

libqwt5-qt4-dev

libqwtplot3d-qt4-0v5

libqwtplot3d-qt4-dev

python-qwt5-qt4

My ccmake settings are:

 WITH_QWTPOLAR                    OFF   

---------------------- 

Anyone knows what I need to do, to be able to compile again? Do I really
have to install qwt6 manually? 

Note that I am not interested in GPS, histograms, etc. 

Could I just turn off all that qwt stuff? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi all.

I notice that QgsBrowserDockWidget class is not included in python bindings.
It would be great to have access to browser panel items from plugins.
Is it intentional or an issue?

Regards.

Hello Victor,

A definite +1 on this.
Also maybe a parent QGISPlugin class all plugins would inherit from ?

As a side note on plugin, but important, Hugo intends at the hackfest to
propose and discuss having plugins be Python modules, so that we can use
PIP to deal with module and plugins dependencies.
This would solve this problem and let us use common Python tools, be it
on the plugin side, or the module management side, and ease packaging
also for the distributions.

using PyString_check instead of PyUnicode_check solve on Ubuntu 15.15
and Python 2.7.10.

my solution is in src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp:381

  /* And it should be a string all ready to go - duplicate it. */
  if ( !PyUnicode_CheckExact( obResult ) )
      if ( !PyString_Check( obResult ) )
        TRACEBACK_FETCH_ERROR( "getvalue() did not return a string" );

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PluginBuilder writes a wrong import inside .py
In-Reply-To: <56389491.2020709@duif.net>

Message-ID: <5638CAF5.3080608@mindspring.com>

This is not fixed.

Some background info:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/139625/qgis-plugin-problems-importing-resources-resources-rc-file-plugin-doasnt-l/155599#155599

This is a problem with  "uic.loadUiType".

I have have determined that if you save your "ui" file in QT designer 
with the resources open after you have added a resource, you get this error.

This is because  QT designer adds

    <resources>
       <include location="resources.qrc"/>
    </resources>

at the end of the file and this causes uic.loadUiType to look for a 
"resources_rc" as "_rc" is a default suffix.

I think closing the resource browser before saving the "ui" file in QT 
Designer will keep this added resources lines from being added to the 
end of the "ui" file.

Hi Enrico,

I found other base classes in app that can be simply ported to library
without or with not so much code rewrite (e.g the identify widget).
I don't know about this class (seems there is only a qgisapp reference
using it's singleton), but usually is due the fact that it is a work
and developer would have time to do this.

in my opinion, feel free to do pull request... and hopefully adding test ;)

regards

Luigi Pirelli

Hi Luigi, 
Contributing to core development is for now far from my skills. I was looking for a convenient way to browse available datasouces without to deal with qt gui engineering that is sometimes makes feel like reinventing the wheel. Thanks anyway.

Hi Paolo,

The impact of this project is much bigger than this, 2.5D rendering is
just the showcase for

 * on-the-fly transformation of geometries while rendering (or with some
small additions also to create geometries based on attributes)
 * being able to specify the rendering order
 * styling the parts of multi-geometries individually
 * enhancements to the expression engine
 * style variables

Finally, in contrast to qgis2threejs it is all built around core
components of QGIS, so it will also be available e.g. on QGIS server.

In short: sponsoring this project is a long-term investment into QGIS
capabilities.

All the best,
Matthias

Hi, this is quite inline with QEP 46 {0]  about handling geometries to draw
label paths. Storing geometries in data or having on-the fly smoothing
expressions for geometries seems to have the same prerequisites for 2.5 D
and that QEP. Hugo  any opinion on that ?

Hi,

Exact. The concepts seem very close. Except that in one case it is
before painting and in another case, before drawing labels.

Matthias, is this possible with your proposition to have different parts
of the buildings coming from different geometry columns ?

Currently for a PostGIS table with two geometry columns (or Spatialite I
guess), the second is extracted as a WKT string. I am not sure yet of
what changes would be needed to have them extracted as QgsGeometry. That
would ease (and speed up) such functionalities (2.5D or label paths)

Theoretically, yes. It's just the result of an expression that is going
to be painted. So the expression can be based on several columns. But
the symbology will always be configured for the main geometry type of
the layer (making it configurable will be an easy followup).

But as you noted, it will be required to have access to the additional
columns as geometry (instead of WKT). One task will probably be to make
the CRS of the additional columns available (IIRC that's not possible
yet). And the other task to conver WKT to a geometry (already possible?)
or even better, never ever handle them as WKT.

QWT_POLAR is enabled by default and WITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR too if a system
QwtPolar is not available.  That's how the packages are built.

Apparently WITH_QWTPOLAR doesn't disable everything that is using Qwt
(anymore?).

Message-ID: <CAG26uNtLRQsxvFdumfDoFbMKDTi8GyWO+jLBJ322+uONPsYghQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm creating a standalone application (=viewer) in pyqgis with some
essentials tools like zoom, plot rasters and vectors, wms displaying and
map renderer.
When I want to create a map renderer with the componer and save it as a
.png, all the layers with the legend are visible but not the legend of the
wms layer.. And I really don't know why.
I've got another problem: I want to set the font of the composer legend
into transparency but the command doesn't work at all:
legend.setFontColor(QColor(255,255,255,0)). May be I miss something..
Is anybody has a solution, it would helps me a lot.
Thanks,
Diane

this is the snippet of my code which do the componer:

 def actionComp(self):
        #create composition with composer map
        mapRenderer = iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
        myMap = QgsMapSettings()
        mapRectangle = myMap.fullExtent()
        myMap.setExtent(mapRectangle)
        myMap.setOutputSize(QSize(1600,1200))
        myComposition = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
        myComposition.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)
        x,y = 0,0
        w,h = myComposition.paperWidth(), myComposition.paperHeight()
        composerMap = QgsComposerMap(myComposition,x,y,w,h)
        composerMap.gridEnabled()
        myComposition.addComposerMap(composerMap)
        composerMap.setLayerSet(myMap.layers()
        myComposition.addItem(composerMap)
        #legend
        legend = QgsComposerLegend(myComposition)
        myComposition.addItem(legend)
        legend.setItemPosition (0,10)
        #legend.setFontColor(QColor(255,255,255,0))
        legend.setScale(.3)
        legend.model().setLayerSet(mapRenderer.layerSet())
        # Scale bar
        item = QgsComposerScaleBar(myComposition)
        myComposition.addComposerScaleBar(item)
        item.setStyle('Numeric')
        item.setItemPosition(0,100)
        item.update()
        item.setComposerMap(composerMap)
        myComposition.addItem(item)
        output_png = "/Users/test.png"
        myImage = myComposition.printPageAsRaster(0)
        myImage.save(output_png)
        composerLabel.setItemPosition(20, 10)
        composerLabel.setItemPosition(100, 10, 100, 30)
        dpi = myComposition.printResolution()
        dpmm = dpi /600
        width = int(dpmm * myComposition.paperWidth())
        height = int(dpmm * myComposition.paperHeight())
        myComposition.setPaperSize(width, height)
        myComposition.setPrintResolution(dpi)
        # create output image and initialize it
        image = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
        image.setDotsPerMeterX(dpmm * 1000)
        image.setDotsPerMeterY(dpmm * 1000)
        image.fill(0)
        #render the composition
        imagePainter = QPainter(image)
        sourceArea = QRectF(0, 0, myComposition.paperWidth(),
myComposition.paperHeight())
        targetArea = QRectF(0, 0, width, height)
        myComposition.render(imagePainter, targetArea, sourceArea)

Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhv5nL365s13cJgwJ8nfzBWpF7euEMmim2AJrCUa4dEYdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


an user tells me that he had an error installing QGIS 2.12 64 bit on
Windows 7.

This is the capture screeen during error:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By5p_WoL_LoFRlUzVDNtcWEwTlk/view?usp=sharing


He has oracle client installed.  Perhaps, it cannot rewrite the oracle dll ?

Somebody other had and solved this error ?   And in case how ?

That because after the error, the install terminates unsuccesfully  :(


Thank you in advance for any info about this


A presto

Roberto

Well, so what do you advise me to do, for not having the message that

Hi,

I wrote a few wrappers for the PyQGIS Programmer's guide that you might 
take a look at: http://locatepress.com/ppg/data_code

Includes a generic add layer function that takes determines whether it 
is a vector or raster and calls the appropriate supporting function.

Nothing earth-shattering; was meant as an example to get folks thinking 
in that direction.

I'm definitely interested in this project...

We have discussed this in the past (I’ll try to find a reference in the mailing list archives) but note that using setup tools / pip has a couple of issues:

1) Expecting a compiler for cpython module compilation is unrealistic. Even if the compiler is there expecting the needed dev libs to be available is unrealistic. The simple approach to this is to bundle cpython using the approach described by Victor and use the dependency mechanism for pure python modules only. 
2) What happens when plugin A tries to install Raven==4.0 and plugin B wants to install Raven==5.0? Plugins will end up trampling over each other dependencies and breaking each other. The solution for that is to use a virtualenv per plugin and expose the QGIS libs into the virtual env. But then we have a problem (maybe its ok?) that plugins cannot depend on each other and import each other’s packages.

I must say I like the idea of having stuff installed into virtualenvs. I’m not so sure about uploading the plugins themselves to pip - I can see the attraction of that but it also adds another layer of overhead for people starting out with plugin development.

Tim

Thanks Gary!

I had a similar function to that one (actually coming from the
Processing code...), so it's good to see that we had the same idea.
That means other people out there might have something like that as
well, so the library definitely makes sense

I am seeing also that the problem might not be in the lack of such
code itself, but in the lack of documentation. For instance, I
recently found out about the QgsMapLayerComboBox and QgsFieldComboBox
widgets. I am pretty sure most people ignore those widgets and dont
use them in plugins. I myself wrote classes to do exactly that in this
library...before I discovered that they existed already in the core of
QGIS.

Improving the documentation will clearly help to avoid this redundancies.

Cheers!

Hey Victor and Gray,

I have added you both to my project, however if you want maybe we can start
an official QGIS repo for it and give it a new name. Keep it away from core
but still part of the main project.

Thoughts?

Nathan, that sounds like a great idea.

Having it under the QGIS organzation in github will avoid people
thinking it is an unofficial and probably unreliable project (as
someone mentioned before), and will help giving it more visibility,
even if we dont put it into core yet

Anyone with permission to do it (Gary, Tim?) can create that repo?
Which name do we use for it?

why exactly do you want to keep it out of core?
All the best, and thanks.

Mainly just for more rapid dev and so that it doesn't have to be stable API
yet or fit in with release plans.

Just for now. Consider it a sandbox until stable

Maybe to have more freedom to experiment in there...? I also think
that it will be easier to get people to collaborate in it, seeing it
as a smaller project, instead of having to do PRs agains the whole
QGIS project, which can feel more intimidating for a casual plugin
developer.

Perhaps we can have it separate first - try it out - improve things and
then integrate it in core? 

If it is in core, it has to be stabilized - which I understand may not
be the case in the beginning.

I agree with Tim, unless we come up with a very simple way, this will
not solve the problem: "non tech savvy users cannot setup their python
environment for some complex plugi".

The different module versions problem I do not see as a practical
problem, most times python can work with higher versions. Let's keep it
the responsibility of the plugin builders to keep up with versions of
their modules.
I still think just copy the modules into the plugin is easiest (although
redundant).
And if you cannot package the lib with your plugin because of OS
problems: documentation is the answer...

Somebody with this insights, maybe can write a chapter about python path
magics and how QGIS works with that?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Devs/Users,

we just started the Las Palmas Hackfest on Canary Islands \o/

during the hackfest it is good I think if we concentrate communications
in one channel.

I propose to use Gitter for that now, as (I think) it is easier for not
IRC users to set up:

Go to:

https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS

and login via your Github (or other?) account.

There is also a gitter/IRC bridge:
https://github.com/gitterHQ/irc-bridge
not working 2-way though

Regards and see you (virtually) there,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps for smaller groups you can off course setup whatever tech you like better

I know I'm cursing in FOSS-church here :-)

But during the hackfest I have an extra laptop with me, running an
Oracle database, with a nice big dataset on it. Happy to give everybody
here connect details to fix some stuff which is currently not working
very well, OR just test if your stuff is working with the oracle
provider too.

It is a temp database, so load whatever you want on it.

Some things that need fixing:
- QGIS browser + oracle
- layertree + oracle
- connection/layer dialog + oracle

You are right, but this should be taken the other way round : how do we
add sugar onto a powerful system, to make it accessible for
non-that-tech people.
This is clearly doable and would be an ideal solution.
The proposals from Victor and all to create a set of functions to help
writing plugins is already a good start in that direction for the code part.
We should be able to do the same for the development environment part.

I think there are much more end-users which are annoyed by dependency
problems than new plugin writers not willing to setup en environment.
Dependency problems are hard whatever we do, and we should definitely
rely on the experience of others for this.

Yes the plugin versions dependencies should be left to the plugin
writer. Dealing with one application using various versions of a module
for various plugins will just lead to "DLL Hell", multiple duplication
of modules and behaviour inconsistencies for the end user.

I think we should build on top of well-defined and bullet-proof tools
the Python world has to offer, and focus on adding simple ways for a
newcomer to start with development. It is not a question of overhead, it
is a question of interface.

Message-ID: <CAHCHdbKCmJVwwYdrTjcTKPjR71A-J4YeN0AFwQ3otAH4Td+DFg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm creating a Processing plugin for which one of the inputs for one of the
tools is a CRS. I'd like to use the CRS from the map canvas as the default
for this parameter but I can't figure out whether this is possible.

My main problem seems to be that the ParameterCrs object is created when
the plugin is first loaded (when QGIS is initialized), so if I parse the
authid() of the map canvas when the plugin loads, it automatically sets to
4326. I can't figure out whether there's a way to re-initialize this
parameter with a different CRS when I actually click on the tool.

Is this technically impossible within the current framework? How can I
accomplish this?

Thanks,
Spencer

Correct.
A first step where the additional geometry columns are considered to be
expressed in the same CRS as the main geometry column would already be
interesting.
And yes, that would be better if additional geometries could be accessed
directly as QgsGeometry, and converted to WKT only when needed
(attribute table ?). It's probably only modifications provider-side.

The conversion provider side are probably straightforward (just use the
code that is used to create the main geometry of the feature).
But I don't know if it can be considered an API break. If you have a
plugin that currently makes use of the WKT format, that may be broken by
this change. Maybe implementing QgsGeometry.__str__() is already fine?

Yes good point. And __str__() is a good idea.

I've got a partial implementation of this I tried a while back. I'll dig it
up and see if it's of any use.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Estimate volunteer work
Message-ID: <563C89C3.30705@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
during a very interesting and stimulating discussion about QGIS project
quality, we decided it is necessary to get an idea of how much volunteer
time is spent by everyone of us.
We could set up a poll, but I think it is a bit overkill here.
If you could send me an estimate of the average time you spend per week
working for QGIS project, not directly paid, subdivided in main tasks, I
can summarise this. I think of something like:
* Chuck Norris:
  * average 240 h per week checking binary code
  * 480 h per week rewriting website in loops.
>From this we'll be able to understand where we have more need for
support to assure the long term sustainability of the project, and where
are our weakest points.
Thanks.

I created two feature requests, to see if including pip in the windows

Hello,

Some additional informations :-)

Plugin to create a static pypi index:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/magnum-pi

Plgins to create a full pypi service:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CheesePrism/ (actually don't support wheel)

Some package that we usually have issue And I think that should be include
on QGIS windows install:
psycopg2
Shapely
Pillow

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Project quality discussion
Message-ID: <563CA971.1010702@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

We had a discussion here in Las Palmas about the overall quality of the
project.

The main concerns / questions (I had) were:

- big organizations are starting to fund QGIS. This is great but it is
still a bit hard for a company to sell the development of a new feature,
because it is hard to guarantee it will be integrated.

- we still rely too much on volunteer work. And the situation becomes
complicated when a paid development depends on volunteer work.

These are my main conclusions.
For people who attended, don't hesitate to complete if necessary. For
the others, you are welcome to react of course.

- every new feature introduced by a core developer should be sent as a
Pull Request first. With a given "quarantine" delay after which the PR
will be merged, even if no reaction. It will allow to share information
and react in case of problems (and encourage people for good work as well :)
-> should I create a QEP for that ?

- if a company with no core developer wants to ensure a new feature is
accepted, it should pay another core developer for the reviewing part.
Ideally the money should go to the project and the project would decide
what core developer(s) to pay.
The details of this process are not very clear. It still has to be
discussed. But the goal is to make clear for everyone that if you want
guarantee: you have to pay for it and there is a clear process to handle
that.

- writing a QEP before adding a new feature is a good way to increase
its acceptance. But some people have to review it. We may come to the
same process to pay for QEP reviews.

- at which point we rely on volunteer work is not yet clear. But the
current guess is: still too much. Having a better idea of the ratio
between free work and paid work would be profitable for the project: it
would allow to make clear what the reality of an open source project
like QGIS is and that too much free work is not sustainable. Paolo's
mail is about that. The goal is to (begin to) separate clearly what is
the part of free work and the part of paid work in the project.

- see on the PSC side if it is possible to pay some people to handle
global maintenance : PR triage, reviews, small bug fixes and so on. It
does not have to be only one developer.

Thanks for participating in this discussion.

Hugo,

This is mainly focus on development of new features but we can add 
documentation and translation in the same way :)

Does new feature shold imply documentation?

The original plan was to talk about that, but we did not.

I would be in favor of that ideally. A new feature = code + tests +
documentation.
But one step at the time. We could start by inviting developers of new
features to include documentation as well. And if it does not work, try
to enforce it somehow.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins discussion
Message-ID: <563CC146.9000403@oslandia.com>

A summary about our other discussion of the morning on Python plugin
dependencies and the opportunity to now use pip rather than our custom
system.

For plugins with external dependencies, we can :
- add fields in metadata.txt to declare the dependencies (a pip install
string)
- for Windows and Mac users, ask package managers to include pip in them.

This way, we will have a simple way to gently warn the user a dependency
is missing. And the missing dependencies will be easily installable from
osgeo4w (or the mac equivalent).

This is the very first step and solves an important issue.

Alessandro is working on the metadata update. And two issues have been
added for the installers:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13775
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13777

About using setuptools for Python plugins and/or the pypi infrastructure
for our plugins, no decision yet.

We did not talk about the common framework of python functions. But I
think things are already going well on this side.

Hi folks,


*preface: I wrote this on the fly so I didn't really review grammar or
structure. I am very passionate about GIS as I've been using it since 2007
and I'm also extremely passionate about traffic/transportation issues and
Continuous improvement culture within organizations.*


Back in June, I had started a small analysis projects on bugs in QGIS that
its results might be helpful to answer Paolo’s questions on time spent
through my experience in continuous improvement and lean six sigma best
practices. Six Sigma is all about involving and invoking the team to find
areas of "waste" from money, time, morale, to redundancies. How can we make
things better for the business, end users, and volunteer contributors?


These are some of the questions that matter to me when looking at the
question at hand:


   1. ·         How much time are contributors spending on a bug
   (understanding the problem, designing a solution, developing, testing, and
   deployment?
   2. ·         How much time are contributors spending on exciting
   value-added projects vs. “this should’ve been done right the first time”
   projects
   3. ·         What is the motivation or objective of the contributor to
   work on a certain matter? (Subject matter expert in the area, making things
   more efficient, Computer-bug-phobia, etc.)
   4. ·         Is the process of adding a new feature or closing a bug
   “predictable” and “controllable”? I.e. if a new bug comes in the system,
   can we successfully predict the time and effort it will take to solve or
   close it?
   5.       What is the current waste in operations? are we spending too
   much time discussing something instead of "doing"? are there too many
   people approving the same thing? is there a bottlekneck in the process? Are
   we catering to what the volunteers and core developers want to do? Do we
   find ourselves spinning our wheels? How long is the end user waiting for
   their product to be patched / fixed?
   6. ·         What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost to the
   end user if no contributors fix a bug on time or work on a feature.
   Conversely, what’ the cost to the end user and QGIS community if users
   don’t submit bugs. What’s the cost to QGIS if you have contributors working
   on mundane (to the individual contributor) vs. exciting issues, i.e. how to
   keep the positive momentum going in a predictive and creative way in an
   environment where the core are volunteers doing this for fun?

*Some of the analysis that I’ve done looking at bug data up to May, 2015:*

Between 2014 and 2015, bugs came in relatively steady and predictive manner
of around 40 a month.

[image: Inline image 1]






The bugs closed, rejected, or revised varied between 15 and 45. I assume
the “spike” is due to an anticipated release or freeze. However, one can
notice that in April and May, the process was not predictable and a large
number of bugs were fixed in two months. It’ll be interesting to see if the
trend continued between June and November.

[image: Inline image 2]





Similarly, in the graph below showing how many bugs are open per month, it
seems that there is some correlation between the number of bugs opened and
closed per month. (graph looks different as I did it in R instead of Excel)

[image: Inline image 3]




·         75% of the bugs were closed in less than 31 days with 50% closed
between 15 and 31 days. Conversely 75% of the bugs have been for not more
than 22 days.

dd

[image: Inline image 4]

*When it comes to the Lean Six Sigma stuff, it is important to:*


   1. ·         Define and the problem, understand the process and see
   where the “waste” is generated. Another way of looking at this is “Do we
   have a problem, and is our process predictable and capable?”
   2. ·         We then Analyze the data for trends and analysis such as
   ANOVA, cause and effect diagrams and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
   (FEMA)
   3. ·         Finally, a recommendation is made by saying, this is what
   is working right now, this is where it’s failing, and here’s the effect on
   the end user and volunteer contributor.
   4.

If you folks are interested in I’ll be willing to lead a project for QGIS
as my contribution to the project

Hi folks,


*preface: I wrote this on the fly so I didn't really review the grammar or
structure. I am very passionate about QGIS as I've been using it since 2007
and I'm also extremely passionate about traffic/transportation issues and
Continuous improvement culture within organizations.*


Back in June, I had started a small analysis project on bugs in QGIS. The
question I was interested in was "Are we fixing bugs in a controlled and
predictable manner; while keeping the end user and volunteer developers
happy?" I didn't go far beyond my personal analysis as It was primary a fun
project.


Some of the results and thoughts might be helpful to answer Paolo’s
questions on time spent based on my experience in continuous improvement
and lean six sigma best practices. Six Sigma is all about involving and
invoking the team to find areas of "waste" from money, time, morale, to
redundancies. How can we make things better for the business, end users,
and volunteer contributors?


Some of the thoughts and concerns that matter to me when looking at the
question at hand:


   1. How much time are contributors spending on a bug (understanding the
   problem, designing a solution, developing, testing, and deployment?
   2. How much time are contributors spending on exciting value-added
   projects vs. “this should’ve been done right the first time” projects
   3. What is the motivation or objective of the contributor to work on a
   certain matter? (Subject matter expert in the area, making things more
   efficient, Computer-bug-phobia, etc.)
   4. Is the process of adding a new feature or closing a bug “predictable”
   and “controllable”? I.e. if a new bug comes in the system, can we
   successfully predict the time and effort it will take to solve or close it?
   5. What is the current waste in operations? are we spending too much
   time discussing something instead of "doing"? are there too many people
   approving the same thing? is there a bottlekneck in the process? Are we
   catering to what the volunteers and core developers want to do? Do we find
   ourselves spinning our wheels? How long is the end user waiting for their
   product to be patched / fixed?
   6. What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost to the end user
   if no contributors fix a bug on time or work on a feature. Conversely,
   what’ the cost to the end user and QGIS community if users don’t submit
   bugs. What’s the cost to QGIS if you have contributors working on mundane
   (to the individual contributor) vs. exciting issues, i.e. how to keep the
   positive momentum going in a predictive and creative way in an environment
   where the core are volunteers doing this for fun?

*Some of the analysis that I’ve done looking at bug data up to May, 2015:*

Between 2014 and 2015, bugs came in relatively steady and predictive manner
of ~40 a month. Bugs Created Chart <http://imgur.com/kYnqnQ0.jpeg>


The bugs closed, rejected, or revised varied between 15 and 45 per month. I
assume the “spike” is due to an anticipated release or freeze. However, one
can notice that in April and May, the process was not predictable and a
large number of bugs were fixed in two months. It’ll be interesting to see
if the trend continued between June and November. Closed Bugs Chart
<http://i.imgur.com/iwT5zmG.jpeg>


Similarly, in the graph below showing how many bugs are still open per
month, it seems that there is some correlation between the number of bugs
opened and closed per month. (graph looks different as I did it in R
instead of Excel). Bugs Open Chart <http://i.imgur.com/4wIuS57.jpeg>


75% of the bugs were closed in less than 31 days with 50% closed between 15
and 31 days. Conversely 75% of the bugs have been open for not more than 22
days. Boxplot Charts <http://i.imgur.com/iXISWr4.jpeg>

Overall, great results so far! but this was just based on a dump from the
issues db.

*When it comes to the Lean Six Sigma stuff, it is important to:*


   1. Define and the problem, understand the process and see where the
   “waste” is generated. Another way of looking at this is “Do we have a
   problem, and is our process predictable and capable?”
   2. We then Analyze the data for trends and analysis such as ANOVA, cause
   and effect diagrams and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FEMA)
   3. Finally, a recommendation is made by saying, this is what is working
   right now, this is where it’s failing, and here’s the effect on the end
   user and volunteer contributor.

If you folks are interested in I’ll be willing to lead a project for QGIS
as my contribution to the project

Why don’t we set up a little online form to capture this - it will be easier to manage the results?

Hi,

I've just uploaded a few modifications to the plugins website:

1. server plugins are now supported, the new "server=True" optional
metadata is now correctly parsed from metadata.txt and a new filtered view
and menu were added to ease server plugin filtering
2. a new optional, experimental and not yet documented "external_deps"
metadata has been added to allow experiments with PIP installing as
discussed this morning
3. both server and  external_deps are now available in the XML

I'll wait a while before documenting "external_deps" because it's still
unsupported by the plugin installer and effectively ignored.

The new server plugins are available here:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/server/

Don't be shy and upload your server plugins there!

not sure it is worht the while, especially considering that we do not
have clear cathegories in ming. I would prefer to get raw data and
aggregate them post hoc.
Of course, if you prefer to set the form up, I'll not complain.
All the best.

Hi Ahmed, 

Well - there is an easy explanation of the spikes on bug fixing: prior
to each release (in the feature freeze month) we pay 2-3 devs to work
one week each on bug fixing. There is not a sudden increase of
volunteers - it is simply the paid work. And there is increased testing
in this period - and thus also more bugs reported. 

You'll find similar patterns for donations. After each release there is
a spike of donations (currently, there is one such peak). Maybe we
should increase our release interval and release every month --> would
probably result in more donations ;-) just kidding.

If a company wants something that makes it into Core, it should be
pre-approved via a QEP. The fallback should be a plugin.

I caution the use of $ to directly influence the QEP review and Pull
Request reviews. Some sort of bounty pool, allowing core devs to get a
stipend for clearing big reviews might be an option. So companies can
contribute to QGIS and that money can go to expedite all QEP and Code
reviews, but not a specific one. I'm mostly concerned with paid funding
driving the direction of the project into strange niches and increasing
the core code maintenance tasks. Plugins seem a much easier way to pay
for exactly what you need.

Free work vs volunteer work is tricky to draw a line between in a
project like this. I think you'd have to survey the devs about what %
they think comes from each in order to account for time spent at
salaried job helping QGIS, time spent improving QGIS to help you sell
services (consultants), time spent being directly paid to do X with
QGIS. There are tons of ways that time is not exactly volunteer.

Thanks for bringing up good things for discussion.

I didn't think it was so simple.
You take a QTreeView For example from QDesigner then you assign QgsTreeModel as view model, you add some trivial interaction logic and you get Your personal qgis browser.
That's all. Great Qgis!

Oggetto: Re: [Qgis-developer] QgsBrowserDockWidget

Hi Enrico,

I found other base classes in app that can be simply ported to library
without or with not so much code rewrite (e.g the identify widget).
I don't know about this class (seems there is only a qgisapp reference
using it's singleton), but usually is due the fact that it is a work
and developer would have time to do this.

in my opinion, feel free to do pull request... and hopefully adding test ;)

regards

Luigi Pirelli

Hi Paolo,

interesting initiative.  :)

Only, I am asking:  what is the scope of this ?  A simple census of the real developers (and experts) of QGIS, in any way ?  
Or, do we need to valuate the... value of "Quantum" ( in ancient "latin") that is: "how is" the value of QGIS, in term of human resource value ( Time Bank, Experience Bank, Resouce Force Bank, etcetera ). 

Perhaps, we are measuring our "military peace" force ?

:)

Good work ( and sorry to not be there )

A presto

Roberto

We want to understand how much of our infrastructure is critically
relying on voluntary work, in order to strengthen it and make it
sustainable over the long term.
All the best.

Plugins are not always doable or desirable.
But I share your concerns about paid funding that drive the direction of
the project. This is why we thought it should be "validated" somehow by
the project which will act as a neutral intermediary. And this is why I
think a core dev should publish its intents by issuing a PR for each new
feature.

Yes. Count at least the time you are sure is fully voluntary :) (it
could be close to 0 ... this is my case)

In general I like the way this discussion is going. But I disagree strongly
with this point. It effectively kills off any contributions from
organisations/individuals who want to contribute via code but can't
contribute financially (eg universities, etc). We don't want to lose that.

It also means the entire project becomes 100% dependant on financing. At
the moment a huge chunk (probably the majority) of QGIS work is volunteer
or via non-funded contributions.

Couldn't this just be worked out by sponsored devs/companies on a case by
case basis? Eg if timing is critical then line up a reviewer for speedy
review prior to quoting for work and factor into their original quote the
cost for this.

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjCNmtvW5E+Gk8BD93Mctaisb6i2RkNfiYyNT8ykRTYQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Time Manager plugin registers a function to provide access to its
animation time in the main application. It seems like changes to how QGIS
handles the registering/unregistering of these functions have caused Time
Manager updates to make QGIS crash again (
https://github.com/anitagraser/TimeManager/issues/95#issuecomment-154594229
).

Is there any way to make QGIS more resilient to these issues? A segfault
seems like an overreaction ;-)

Should I open a ticket?

Best wishes,
Anita

It does not. The idea is to pay if you want a guarantee. It does not
change anything for people who contribute via code without money: they
will wait that someone review / merge their contribution.

The goal is to improve the sustainability of the project.
What if our free workers get sick, retired or just want to do something
else ?

Exactly and this was part of the discussion. It will probably be done by
direct hiring in a first step if needed.
But ideally something should be done to ensure each contribution is not
tied to a specific need (from the funder) but improve the common good of
the project. This is why a "neutral" point of view from the project
should be needed.

It is already more or less the case since core dev can get paid to
implement whatever a customer wants.

The goal is to:
- be aware that relying too much on free work does not scale
- then find a way to turn some amount of free work into paid work
- and make sure the money does not decrease the common good

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Snapping rounding errors with on-the-fly
	reprojection (#13745)
Message-ID: <CAGZtxQyg=Av7j+BkHyT+FR_TW58Niv2i8rFZJiBsEnf9+wJpag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Last week I made a bug report (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13745) and
got redirected to this mailing list.

To summarize, the issue here is as follows. When digitising, QGis
keeps a rubber band in map coordinates and a capture list in layer
coordinates. However, vertices of the capture list are added in a way
where they are first converted from on-screen pixel coordinates to map
coordinates, then snapped, and then transformed to layer coordinates.
This leads to floating point inaccuracies, so that the resulting layer
data are in fact not exactly snapped.

To test if this is really the problem, I have made some changes, so
that the capture list coordinates are directly snapped to the layer
coordinates. With these changes, snapping seems to work correctly,
without such floating point inaccuracies. I've put these changes here:
https://github.com/dgoedkoop/QGIS/tree/digitise_snap_crs

I think they are not (yet?) suitable for a pull request. There are
(still) some problems, such as:
- Snapping tolerance might not be converted between map / layer units
and might thus be completely wrong
- The snapping index is created and destroyed twice in every mapcanvas
mouse event. This is unacceptably slow. At least two snapping caches
are necessary, one for the map CRS and one for the current layer CRS.
- Might crash when digitising without any active layer
- I haven't looked at unit tests yet (only checked that the existing
ones compile at all.)

This is my first try for a little bit bigger contribution to an open
source project. And also the first time to write some C++ code. And
also the first time to use github forks. So I'd appreciate any
feedback!

Kind regards,
Daan Goedkoop

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin migratin -> mailing list?
Message-ID: <563E34FD.8080807@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I would be in favour of creating a readonly mailing list for plugin
authors and maintainers, in order to contact them all easily when
needed. I think this will be especially important for the upcoming
Python migration, so we can send crucial announcements, suggestions, etc.
We can obtain the list of authors and maintainers easily from the
plugins django app, and ffed it into Mailman as a mass subscription.
What is more tricky is to synchronize the two. For this we would need a
little script, listing members of the ML (list_members nameofthelist)
diffing, patching, and adding the missing addresses.
So my questions are:
* anybody opposes the creation of the list?
* any better solutions to contact authors?
* anyone willing to write the script?
Thanks.

Hello,

To get all the qgis plugin hosted on pypi we should be able to use a
keywords.

An to get the list of plugin that have some keywords:

from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy
pypi = ServerProxy("http://pypi.python.org/pypi", allow_none=True)
sp.search({"keywords": ["gdal", "dap"]})

returns:
[{'_pypi_ordering': False,
  'name': 'dap.plugins.gdal',
  'summary': 'GDAL plugin for pydap server',
  'version': '0.1.1'}]

Thanks Alessandro.
Just for the record: we have now 299 plugin maintainer emails, an
average of 1.8 plugins each.
All the best.

Forgot the instructions:

from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy
ServerProxy('

)

only administrators can access.

Is this a list I might want to be on?  I have no official plugins but am 
creating some custom plugins specific to my users.

I am absolutely countrary to diffuse any list of authors.
Certainly in Italy there are rules governing privacy:

http://www.garanteprivacy.it/home_en

we developers have not given any written agreement that allows anyone to
keep a list that concerns us.

then you can consider this a warning email to NOT use my personal data for
any use.

As discussed before, can we not just have a plugins list like this one?
Voluntary to join, so potentially compliant with data protection
legislation.

I'm not a lawyer but isn't that list already public: authors/contacts are
of course listed on the plugin repo website. Afaik, we are just talking
about using the provided contact information to contact devs concerning
necessary steps towards QGIS 3.0

I can only speak about UK legislation. That only allows the use of collected
personal data for purposes explicitly stated at the time of collection. I
don't believe such permission is sought when plugins are submitted. Are
there any terms and conditions which bind plugin authors?

I would think that listing yourself in the metadata as the author for a
plugin is rather explicitly agreeing to be contacted regarding that plugin,
why else would someone put their email there? I would expect to hear from
the admins on that address, and even from users, and so set an appropriate
address for that purpose.

Personally, I would like to see a proper mailing list for plugin devs, as
neither the users nor developers lists seem quite the right place to be
asking questions or receiving advice on plugin development. Do an initial
mail-out to all the contact addresses telling about the list, but don't
auto-subscribe, that will act as a natural filter on those plugins no
longer actively developed. Then when important milestones arrive in the 3.x
release use the full author list for announcement emails only pointing to
the plugin list or wiki for further details.

John.

let us speak frankly.

I think that the intentions (or temptations) of lists of plugin developers
and the time dedicated to each development can also serve to assess the
total value of the resources that are used in QuantumGIS.

If I'm wrong, correct me.

True or False ?

A presto

Geo DrinX,

the whole purpose of this list is to be helpfull, Paolo writes: "I would
be in favour of creating a readonly mailing list for plugin authors and
maintainers, in order to contact them all easily when needed."

We (the plugin admins) want to reach out to all plugins devs to give (in
this case) instructions to migrate the plugins when we migrate to
Python3. If you do NOT want to be reached in anyway by the psc or plugin
admins, you should not give an email address when you uploaded the plugin.

There is no place for anonymous plugins in our community repo.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

In fact, I have an eMail, and I am reachable.

I am certainly available to correct the errors of my plugins and so on.

But in so there is no estimate the value of what I write to raise funds.
This is clear.

I think you're mixing two different topics here.

 1) setup a mean to talk with the maintainers of all
    the plugins registered in the qgis plugin database

 2) estimation of volunteers work

Or I fail to understand your question.

+1, I second this approach.

Additionally, I'd add a note on the bottom of the announcement mails
documenting how to stop receiving them (removing the plugin from the
database or updating its "maintainer" contact, I guess).

I think we should all respect a view held by someone who has voluntarily
created a plugin. My opinion, as a UK data protection officer, is that this
view is in line with data protection legislation. When I submitted a plugin,
I was not told that my email address would be used for bulk mailing. 

We can change the terms and conditions to make this the case in the future,
though I would not recommend it. But we cannot use that data for a purpose
for which we did not seek permission.

I think you're still mixing topics here.  This thread is about setting up a
means to notify plugin developers on changes in QGIS that they will have to
adapt their plugins too (if the want them to work with QGIS 3).

The estimate about how much we depend on volunteer work is a different topic
which doesn't include the plugins at all (except for the effort necessary to
maintain the infrastructure to host the plugins, the plugin installer, core
plugins etc.).

Let us not exaggerate this please.

All plugin developers provide an email address to be contacted in case 
of problems/questions. These are publicly available on our website and 
in our Plugin Manager application.

Now, because of large changes in our system that will affect all 
plugins, the QGIS team wants to send some messages to all plugin 
developers. This could be done by hand (adding up all addresses as BCC 
in an email program) but it would take up a lot of time. Luckily there 
is automation, and we can do this automatically by sending a (bcc!) 
message to all plugin developers.

What is wrong about saving time this way? I just do not get it.

Hi all,
Raymond, I'm not sure plugins authors mail are **publicly** available,
neither on plugins.qgis.org nor in the Plugins Manager. User do not need my
email to reach me about an issue; just report it to a bug tracker (which
everybody should provide). The only persons who have access to name and
mails are QGIS Plugins team admins.
That said, most of us write in this ML with clear emails :)

What might be unclear in Paolo's mail is about a creation of a list. You
already have the mails, what is needed to be created then? Do you need our
acceptance to compile in a database the list of plugins authors and
adresses if this list is only available for the team and not for the
public? I assume this is just to join people easily about their plugins
(evolution).
I'm for a plugin ML and as already stated by some of us, no automatic
adhesion. People should be invited to voluntarily join it thus a list of
mails (at least for the first invitation)

If you open this plugin info page:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/FieldEvaluator/

you will find my email-address in the details tab. Same for all other 
plugins.

Indeed it is not shown in the Plugin Manager, I wasn't aware of that. 
But it is in the metadata.txt file which is downloaded by all users 
together with the plugin. Quite publicly.

Problem with asking plugin developers to subscribe on a plugin ML is 
that a part of them will not read/do it and therefore won't know the 
impact of near future QGIS changes, which is bad for QGIS and many users.

For now, let's ask Paolo in what way he is intended to use this.

Hello Raymond,

Instead of sending bulk eMails, taken from plugin Db ( that the current rule forbids ) you can have two possible strategies:

1) to ask again to all plugin developers sign a new mail-list, where is explicitely indicate the scope of 

2) simply, to insert in the qgis.org web site a clear alert to plugin developers what they need to do to update their work

It'all.

Hi all,

I'm surprised of all this discussion. I think the situation is quite clear:
* we have a problem: major changes in QGIS will break most or all plugins
* we do not want to leave authors alone in dealing with this
* the best solution we thought of is to write announcements and tips to
help them
* we can send a message to 299 addresses, but it is easier and safer if
we use software designed for it, and our good old Mailman seems the
natural solution
* this allows the list of addresses to be kept secret, and to let people
unsubscribe (and eventually subscribe) if they wish.
I frankly do not do not see the issue, sorry.
All the best.

My 2c:

I think we should revisit the idea of tiered plugins:

* "wild west plugins" - no approval process beyond the basics of it it can pass validation (our current store). It would be accompanied by a cautionary note: ‘Do not enable this unless you are happy with the the fact that QGIS asserts absolutely no confidence in the quality of these plugins.'
* QGIS approved plugins - maintainers *must* to be contactable and willing to receive regular correspondence from QGIS as relates to the management of their plugin. It would be accompanied by a cautionary note: ‘This plugin does not adhere to the coding and style guidelines of QGIS.ORG. Whilst QGIS.ORG provides no guarantee that this plugin is safe to use and fit-for-purpose, it has been developed by a community member who is generally trusted and has made a commitment to maintain the plugin.'
* QGIS recommended plugins - same requirements as in ‘approved plugins’ above, plus the plugins must be compliant with coding standards, HIG (human interface guideline) standards (so they integrate nicely with QGIS look and feel etc.) and the developers are trusted to not insert the odd "rm -rf /“ shell call into their scripts. They would be accompanied by a cautionary note like: ‘This plugin adheres to the coding and style guidelines of QGIS.ORG. Whilst QGIS.ORG provides no guarantee that this plugin is safe to use and fit-for-purpose, it has been developed by a community member who is generally trusted and has made a commitment to maintain the plugin.'

These classifications would be in addition to the experimental / not experimental classification we have (which can apply to any plugin tier above).

Plugin authors should understand that we are placing inherent trust in them and taking an inherent risk by distributing their work and making it available on the computers of hundreds of thousands of users and they absolutely *must* be willing to receive and respond to regular correspondence from us as part of that equation. If we have slipped up on making that clear up till now, we need fix that. To start with we should put all publishers of existing plugins into the ‘wild west’ and they would not be subject to any email distribution so that we keep the status quo. Any author of approved and recommended category plugins absolutely *must* agree to participate in a broadcast email programme intended to inform and advise plugin writers of changes in the QGIS project as pertains to plugin writing and management.

In the "I am not a layer" category, it strikes me that it doesn't matter
what the law is in your or my jurisdiction, whether that is the UK or Italy
or the US, what matters is the law in the jurisdiction of the collecting
party at the point(s) of collection and storage? Which for QGIS plugins
would be?

Nice GIS faux pas :-)

QGIS.ORG <http://qgis.org/> as of a week or so from now will be registered in Switzerland so I guess Swiss rules will apply. That notwithstanding I think the fact that we never had any clear guidance as to how we intended to use email addresses added to metadata should make us err on the side of caution: maintain the ’non communication’ status quo for existing plugins and mandate that any new uploads agree to explicit terms when they upload any new version of their plugins.

Agreed -We need salaried QGIS.ORG staff that can review these things independently of who it comes from or if / how they have financed QGIS.

Many consider submodules a PITA e.g.

No even really that.  Just mainly because like we said it's not considered
stable at the moment and we don't want to be linked to the release cycle.
It will be good to mainly just test ideas first and then merge it later.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Behaviour when SpatiaLite tables change
Message-ID: <CANVKczONw7g-EST6pYrrEYWtUiy6Vgkj-5uwwgN36iuN+rtT5g@mail.gmail.com>

What should QGIS do when a SpatiaLite table changes from outside QGIS?
Here's what I'm doing...

I have a SpatiaLite spatial data table of ten points with an id and
name column. It loads into QGIS and I can access the "name" attribute
as expected to style the points and label them.

Then I open the DB in the SpatiaLite command line and do something
like "update pts set name='X' where id<5" to change some of the names.

If I now open the Attribute table in QGIS I see the data in the column
has changed. The labels also change as soon as I pan or zoom the
canvas.

But if I open the Style dialog and classify the points as
"Categorized" based on the "name" attribute it still sees the old set
of values. If I change it to an expression base on "name", such as
"concat(name)" I get the *new* values!

It looks like the renderer has cached the attribute values and isn't
clearing them, despite me switching renderers, clearing categories,
and clicking just about everything in the style dialog.

So is this a bug, or expected behaviour, or just undefined behaviour?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions about  labels and animation in QGIS
Message-ID: <tencent_6B5F81F8487669247755A2A2@qq.com>

Hi,
I'm new to QGIS, and I want to use QGIS to develop a software to show and editing flight tracks. My development environment is as follow:
1 Windows 7
2 Qt4.8.6
3 QGIS2.4(Build from sourcecode).
I have displayed vector and raster in a canvas(QgsMapCanvas) successfully, but I don't know how to show labels in QGIS and how to animate them.
I used to do the same job in MapX. In MapX, a user drawing layer is provided to decrease CPU usage when some elements must be refreshed frequently. However, it seems like that QGIS doesn't provide such layer, so how to animate a moving track without refreshing the whole map? 
A colleage use a QWidget window to draw the labels and the QWidget window overlays on the canvas(QgsMapCanvas). By this method, he can draw anything he want in the QWidget window and refresh the elements. But I feel that this is not the recommended way in QGIS. Is there any better way to achieve the requirements?


Can anyone tell me how or provide development documents to refer to? Thanks.

I generally agree, but I would prefer if the salaried QGIS.ORG staff would
only act as a coordinator in managing the review queue coming from not-core
devs to guarantee scheduled times (since the core-devs go into the
quarantine queue with automatic approval if no one raise exceptions) and
should delegate/outsource the code review job to the core devs (or
externally if no one is available) and only if/when needed (i.e. because of
lacking volunteers).

We are not moving from a volunteer based project, do we?

I also wish to thank Hugo for starting this topic, it's not easy to talk
about this, since it crosses personal choices, philosophical believes,
economical interests etc...

Hi,

I can suggest to start modifying my plugin "DronePlanner" for Quant'unGIS, that created a file for MikroKopter drones. 
Now, it is obsolete, but I think it could be interesting for you. 

Let's install it, test it and please report me what do you think about it.  I am happy if you need some help to code. 

A presto

Roberto

Why not a more recent version ?

If I understand correctly your needs: you need to animate a layer with
labels and you don't want all the layers to be refreshed at each frame ?
For performance reasons ?
How many layers have labels ?

As far as I know this statement is totally wrong. The vast majority of
QGIS work is done via paid people during work hours. This is definitly
not volunteering, neither non-funded.
Some work may not be _directly_ funded, but it it still paid work :
researchers, consultant, people who develop plugins to help their jobs
may not be paid directly to do specific QGIS improvement. But all the
work they do on it is part of their global job.

They are indeed students, week-end programmers and other fully
benevolent volunteers who do a great job in QGIS, but it is IMHO very
far from being a majority.
And paying them to work on QGIS also is a way to value their work and
improve quality, not make the project $$$-dependant.

Who would be paying them?

The way I read this is that THEY would have to pay for their
contribution to be reviewed.

Only if nobody volunteers to review that for free.

The problems we are addressing are two:

1. I'm a not-core-dev and I get a contract for a new feature, I want to be
sure that it will be accepted and included in the core in a certain time
2. I'm a core-dev and there is a 70-core-files-changed PR waiting for me to
review it for free, I cannot simply afford to work on it because my partner
will divorce, my boss will fire me and my children will starve

So, to address 1, we will ask for a QEP before the PR is even submitted, If
the QEP is approved, the not-core-dev will be reasonably sure that the
feature will be included in the core(when ready and if properly coded) and
can sign the contract with his customer. He also know that a certain amount
of money will be required to pay for the code review and that the code
review will be done in a certain time.

To address 2, the QGIS.ORG will ask if somebody is volunteering to review
the code in a certain time (and keep the money for the project in that
case) an hire a core dev to do the code review in case no one is available
(still keeping part of the money for the internal expenses).

This is not killing voluntary work, provides some additional funds for
QGIS.ORG, reward core devs (and feeds their children) and moreover
guarantee certain times and a clear and transparent path for new features
approval process to not-core devs.

Yes. Or to put it differently: only if THEY want a guarantee on
acceptability / decision delay

I agree. But I am pretty sure if it is known there is money for a
review, nobody would like to review it for free (and it would make
sense). So I am not sure about the first part of your "if" :)

I also think it could generalize to QEP reviews as well.

On a layer you can call layer.triggerRepaint() and it will force a
repaint of this layer.
Usually it will refresh only this layer, except if there are labels. In
which case all layers with labels will be redrawn.

Hello,

I have developed my PyQGIS application using OSGeo4W 2.12 and python 2.7
bindings for win64.

I want to crate an interface for loading shapefiles and generating a
map with legend.

any help please.

Hi,

As some of you have probably noticed, a few months went by without our
meeting minutes being posted. I have fixed this now and you can find them
again on the wiki at:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/PSC_Meeting_November_2015 and
back in time from there.

As you know, we are also publishing our annual financial docs at:
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/finance/index.html
The 2015 report will be published as soon as it is ready.

If you stumble on any docs that you think should be open, please let us
know. It's probably just an oversight concerning the sharing settings when
creating the document.

Thanks everyone for taking part in the dev meeting on-site or remotely!

Best wishes,
Anita

The main problem I see in having a formal pay to review/merge model, no
matter the scale, is that it is a pay to win model no matter how to goes.
If you have the money you can pay someone to push it though quicker which
doesn't give others the same ability if they don't have the cash.

Personally the only way I can see this model working is if we have a full
time dev for the project that can review most PRs, or the QGIS.ORG board
can allocate funds to a core dev to review a set of PRs. This way the
project is in control and not "Hey X, I have a stack of cash here. Be a
buddy and merge my stuff for me will ya"

I am streamlining the QEP process so that the whole think is quicker and
faster to do.

Yes, that would be ideal.

But do we have enough money for that ?
And is it a full time job ?

Or to put it another way: what is the budget we can assign for this task ?

As stated at the HF, I am much more in favor of 2 to 4 part time devs
than 1 full time (as seen in the PSC minutes).

It might be a bit less efficient in terms of productivity:
* it is more neutral (several opinions/people around)
* it is more fair regarding which company is involved (it can be shared
on several companies involved in QGIS)
* it is less risky (it does not rely on a single person: what happens
when he leaves, is on holidays, etc)

My 2c, for what it's worth.

The only concern I have with QGIS.ORG hiring a full/part-time dev is that
could be hard to find a single developer that can review all parts of the
code.

I'd prefer if QGIS.ORG does the coordination part with internally financed
resources and delegates/outsource the code review to a pool of core-devs.

It depends on the individual PR, if it's the amazing cool new feature that
everybody was waiting for, I suspect that some volunteers code reviewer
will show up anyway.

What we need to avoid is that somebody pays for a feature and that it's
included no matter how it is. But the quarantine for the core-devs and the
QEP+code review for all others should work in that case.

The advantages in having the PR queue managed by QGIS.ORG is that it's more
neutral if compared with just hiring a core-dev to bypass the whole process.

So I have been thinking about the QEP process, because yes the current
process is not good and way to slow for how we work.  To streamline I have
talked to a few people and this is the notes so far.

- Open for at least one week
- QEP process should be fast and evolve into a PR but also not cut back on
details.
- PR can also be opened at the same time - however not recommend if
something is still in planning stage and changing, or chance of rejection
e.g don't update all the code headers with MIT and then open a QEP because
it wouldn't happen.
- Code based QEPs require at least 2 +1's
- Requires +1 from maintainer of that area of code e.g Nyall for composer
work, Martin for rendering thread
- Project QEPs require majority PSC vote
- May be extended upon request (eg, i'm on holidays but have feedback)
- May be extended if required
- Others can assign themselves as interested e.g I might be interested in
Processing but can't comment on the code.  Mainly just to provide feedback.
- If no maintainer for a area of code, requires at least 2 +1s from core
devs

The tl;dr version:

- Project QEP: PSC vote
- Code QEP: min +2 (+1 from maintainer plus +1 from other)
- Keep it semi formal but quick.

The code maintainer for the different areas will need to be updated however
I'm sure we can handle that.

How does that sound to everyone?

I would like to make it fast but also give us time to review changes that
will affect the project.

I sent this to Alessandro only instead of the whole list by accident!

>From the discussion so far, it seems that there is no common and well
understood "standard operating procedure" or "policies" for such issues.
QGIS, QGIS Core group, clients, paid and unpaid developers by clearly
outlining each person's role and responsibility and minimizing friction
could benefit everyone.

For this issue, two tools come to mind:
----------------------------------------------------
1. A project selection matrix based on the "triple bottom line" (TBL)
principles as they relate to QGIS's project and executive vision. For a
hypothetical example, the main variables could be "Increase in usage of
QGIS by different users", "Reduce errors and inconsistencies",
"addin/plugin helps solve an environmental problem and therefore can
contribute to GHG emissions reductions", "plugin could generate outside
revenue through consulting, hiring of staff, etc", "add in / plugin could
help QGIS be implemented at the corporate level", "add in / plugin lines up
with QGIS corporate and open source goals".
With this tool a group of technical experts an QGIS board would form a a
committee and meet to discuss potential projects, let's say once a month.
In that two hour online meeting, they would score each projects based on
all the variables at hand.
These scores would be combined into a matrix such as the following
http://bestbusinessprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Matrix.jpg .

2. When projects are scored through the TBL and plotted in the quadrant
chart, QGIS committee can then take them through a project selection flow
chart that would determine whether this will be done for free, money,
expected timelines,what are the benefit to cost ratio, etc.. For example,
if a project is a "quick-win", the core committee might decide to take
someone off an existing project and assign them to that; On the other hand,
if the project / add in is considered a "fill-in" as in a low priority for
the client, QGIS, community, and vision, then the prospective client can
pay to get the plug-in developed.

I think there is an opportunity here to develop some "Standard Operating
Procedures" in QGIS to make the process capable and predictable, as in if
at any point in time, someone submits a new idea, the path to development,
for hire, or rejection is clearly understood and replicable.

These are my two cents.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python 3 / PyQt 5
Message-ID: <564285EC.3080100@opengis.ch>

Dear all,

We have been working on bringing QGIS to the latest and greatest of the
very core components QGIS is built around. There is a pull request open
to integrate Python 3 and PyQt5 support.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2430

This pull request is pretty safe to merge and should not affect PyQt4
and Python 2 builds which are shipped to users.
On the other hand, it is the first step towards the next version of QGIS
and allows us (the developers) to effectively start gathering
experiences with these libraries.



A plan of action could look like this:

Develop tools that help with the transition.
For python there are already tools like 2to3 or python-modernize that
can upgrade and even produce code that is (supposed to be) compatible
with both versions. For PyQt there are some scripts available online,
but I had no success with them so far (but feel free to try as well, I
did not investigate in detail). There is also a scratch implementation
for a compatibility library which makes it possible to write code that
works with PyQt4 and PyQt5. It would be awesome to have an extension for
python-modernize, that also fixes PyQt imports and other quirks. This
way plugin developers are not forced to provide two separate versions of
their plugins.
We can already start now with this.

CI
We did not integrate this into travis yet, mainly because of missing
dependencies. Having parallel CI for PyQt4 and PyQt5 will make our life
much, much easier!

Upgrade python tests
It will be best to migrate the tests first. These do not affect
production code and give a good feedback where things can break.

Upgrade core python code
This should be done in a separate branch and only bullet-proof code
should be merged to master before 2.14 (I think the console would be a
good candidate to port already now but keep the rest separated).
Not sure how much worth it is to already start porting this in a
separate branch while development continues in master. It will be a
nightmare to solve the conflicts later.

Provide information to plugin devs
Once we have collected some knowledge about the required steps we can
inform plugin devs with information what kind of tools they can use and
which manual changes are required.

QGIS3
Define what exactly we will want to be in there. This is the part which
I think is really, really important. It's a once-in-a-couple-of-years
chance to change the API. And this is what makes QGIS 3 deserve a major
new version number, Python and PyQt changes are just goodies delivered
at the same time. I assume it would be good if core devs all just wrote
some // TODO QGIS3 comments into the code so we can easily grep to get a
todo list.

Remove the deprecated API
That will be straightforward at the appropriate time. We could even
already hide this API for PyQt5 builds now so early-adopters can point
out issues where we do not provide an equivalent for removed APIs.

OSX
IIRC we have some issues with Qt4 on newer OSX versions. It should be
possible to ship QGIS with Qt5 and PyQt4 for these systems if somebody
is willing to work on it. This should be fully compatible with existing
plugins.

Old platforms
What do we do with platforms with missing pyqt5 (I guess python3
shouldn't be a real problem anywhere). Do we just not ship QGIS 3 there
(Why not...)?

Things like this is why you can tell all your friends it's worth
sponsoring QGIS developer meetings. We work most efficiently on islands
with beaches.

Best regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] About WKT plugins ... :)
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhs-Cq6gFn7w2PpBcgVVQBAgN6coowE8=CmMGmyM5JahBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,


I noticed that appeared between QGIS plugins a new one, named
"WKTBulkLoader", that loads .wkt file as QGIS layers.

I am asking:  for what reason my plugin "WktExport" was unapproved (for
some reason) and this other (for the same reason) is accepted ?

Is WKT interesting or not, for QGIS ?

Oh, well as we tell here in Italy:  "Due pesi e due misure" that means (for
GoogleTranslate "two weights and two measures" )


I miei più cordiali saluti

Roberto

Plugin published. If anyone has suggestions about similar/duplicated
plugins, please help me tracking them, and convince authors to merge
their work.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi, 

Just a note on WKT loading: if you load from CSV, you can also include
WKT geometry. Is there really a need for such plugins? What does the
plugin do that the CSV loader can't?

Hi Matteo, 

There is now a statistics panel in QGIS core. Maybe time to retire that
plugin? Or is there something in the statist plugin that the statistics
panel does not provide/offer?

Hi Andreas,
I'm aware of teh new Panel..
What Statist provides are the plots of the fields..

With the Statistic Panel I think that the 2 functions:

#. Unique fields
#. Basic Statistics

under the menu Vector -> Analysis Tools are now obsolete..

Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EACDF48@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

When QGIS starts, it calls the __init__.py and the __init__ method of my plugin, but not the initGui method.  Once QGIS has started, the plugin appears in qgis.utils.available_plugins but not in qgis.utils.active_plugins.  If I call qgis.utils.startPlugin, then __init__.py, Plugin.__init__ and Plugin.initGui are all called and the plugin becomes active.

When is initGui / startPlugin called method during QGIS loading?  Is there something that my initGui should contain (or that my __init__ should not contain) so that the initGui gets called on QGIS startup?

I’m using QGIS 2.12.0 on Mint 17 Mate (ubuntu 14.04).

Thanks,
John

Hi Tom,

It is one that I am writing myself.   I've looked at others e.g. openlayers, plugin reloader and they all have their initGui methods called, so I am trying to understand why mine is not.

Thanks

Hi John,

Sorry for a probably a stupid question, but did you activate the plugin
in the plugin manager?

Hi Matthias,

A very good question.

No, I had not.  I had just copied the module directory into my plugins directory.  Now that it is activated, the initGui and unload methods are begin called on QGIS start up and close down.

Thank you!

John

Hi Matteo, 

The plots are indeed a reason to keep the plugin! 

On the other hand, it would be very nice to have diagram/chart support
in QGIS - so we could place them in the print composer and include them
in Atlas/reports - as well as (the simpler ones) also in the main map.

Right - perhaps worth a QEP?

How would you go about this? Would you write a QEP and then look for a
developer to implement it? Would the developer edit the QEP before
implementing it or tied to the original version? And at what point would
the voting on it take place?

All the best

before the Nodebo HF I wrote I QEP for that:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/34

I think QGIS misses that the ability of making plots (scatter plot,
boxplot, ecc...) with the attribute table fields and values.

python matplotlib is full of features, but I think D3 (http://d3js.org/)
is the most powerful way to display data..
Don't know how difficult would it be to implement all these kind of
features..

Hi, 

If we want something good in core, it should be something native in C++,
in my opinion, without heavy reliance on other libraries/external
software/other programming languages. 

Or we run in a lot of troubles. 

I also love d3.js - but I don't think it is the right technology if we
consider integration in maps, print, reports. d3.js was made to be
interactive and deployed on the web. 

Maybe concepts/ideas/some code from d3 or matplotlib could be re-used.

I might be wrong but since QT decided to abandon QWebView and QWebWidget, I
would simply (and sadly) say bye to all web-related technologies in QGIS.

Does that mean I've got a real problem with the preview window in qgis2web
when QGIS goes to Qt5?

The successor will be QtWebEngine. Last time I checked it was not
complete but meanwhile QWebView is still there also on Qt5 for the
majority of platforms (the only one I know is missing it is Android and
I assume the other restrictive mobile OS's enforce the same). No reason
to panic.

It'd still be good to know why you want the recent project disabled on
startup.

Trade Secret.
:(

No, seriously: I wrote a book and I had to change the pages and images.

;)

Roberto

PS: I could turn the question around: why you entered a useless page of old
projects, and instead open the last directly, as does MapWindow? I've seen
it: you can do that too. However, I prefer a blank page instead of
showing others
(my wife)  what I was doing   ;)

 Privacy? Would you like your web browser to show your browser history
on startup?

 That's an extreme analogy, but there may be people working on
projects for client A that don't want client B to see they are working
on.

A discrete File->OpenRecent would have done :)

Ok point. But in my experience 99% of users love it. It's a great feature
and deserves to be on by default.

Why? It's on otherwise unused screen space...

I prefer the new "recent projects" screen as opposed to a blank screen
or opening my "last project".

As I bounce between a couple of projects from day to day, the list is
quite helpfule.

Ranked by frequency, I'd estimate my use cases as:

70% I'm opening the last project I worked on.
20% I'm opening a project I've recently worked on.
5% I'm starting a new project.
5% I'm opening a project I worked on a long time ago.

Even though I'm usually opening my most recent project, I still prefer
the list of my last few recent projects because I do use them somewhat
regularly, while getting my "most recent" is only one click away. 

So the pain of clicking once to get my most recent project 70% of the
time outweighs the risk of entering a file dialog 20% of the time.

And considering that in previous releases I had to enter a file dialog
100% of the time, this is a great improvement =)

I think you are a lone voice on the desert on that one - everyone I encounter loves this feature. (OK that was tempting fate - no doubt someone else will write in now saying they don’t like it too :-P ).

We have that already.

Just for the record.

I am completely with Anita.. There might be some small points against
this but after all it is a huge improvement (which can be switched off
anyway if you dont like it).

So please keep the "Recent Projects" screen..

(But I would also like to be able to delete some of the "moved"
projects which cannot be loaded anymore)

regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass process don't work in 2.13.0  8803cb4
Message-ID: <DUB123-W21E12B30E737E23641B66E5120@phx.gbl>

Dear all,

I just compiled and installed QGIS 2.13.0 code revision on my ubuntu 15.10.
Everything are fine, but I got problems on grass tools from processing toolbox.
I have:



Missing dependency. This algorithm cannot be run :-( 
This algorithm requires GRASS to be run. Unfortunately, it seems that GRASS is not installed in your system, or it is not correctly configured to be used from QGIS
Click here to know more about how to install and configure GRASS to be used with QGIS
if I click on grass group of tools, and quite similar message


Missing dependency. This algorithm cannot be run :-( 
It seems that GRASS GIS 7 is not correctly installed and configured in your system. Please install it before running GRASS GIS 7 algorithms.
on click on a tool from grass7 group.
Then I tested my stand-alone grass7 (installed from ubuntu package) and the one compiled (grass_trunk, i.e. grass71) and they work fine.So I think some links are missing from my qgis installation and grass engine.
Can you help me?
best
Eugenio

I have a suggestion for the "open last project" at startup option choice. 
In other programs where this usually happens ( iMovie, and other Apple programs, for example )  they save on exit also the memory status of the program ( i.e.  the "display file" on gis or cad or 3d graphics) in way to have an immediate re-start of last saved project. 
Instead, simply re-open again the old project (like perform an "Open project..." macro without menus, results too slow to be effettively useful, expecially with very big projects. 

Do you think I wrong ?

A presto

Roberto

Can't this already be done with the recent projects screen now?  The top
one is the most recent.

- Open QGIS
- Double click top item

Done.

I know this. 
Sorry that my English is incomprehensible :(

I was trying to explain that I think the "open the last project" makes sense only if it is quick to do so (and I tried to explain how to do this the other programs).

Sorry, nothing.  

I can explain it only in Italian.  :(


A presto

Are you sure that other programs save additional information just for
the one last recent session (or even a memory dump)?

I think it would be good in general to speed up project loading, I'm
pretty sure there is room for improvement in performance there. But the
bottleneck there will need to be properly analyzed before making
decisions about how to fix it.

Hi,

R for example does save the “workspace” for a session on request, but I am not sure if this is so relevant for QGIS at all. Actually, IMHO much better to start an empty project by default than a (probably heavy) recent project one does not want to continue with.

Something that might improve the situation in a simple way (though I have no problems with the current situation) could be to mark (e.g. grey out) projects that were moved (cannot be found at the specified location) or those could be put to the end of the list or something like that…

Cheers
Stefan

As mentioned before I think the new opening screen with recent projects is
a great feature. However, an improvement would be to automatically remove
the projects that cannot be found (greyed out ones) as suggested by Stefan.
Or the option to manually remove them from the list?

Moving them to the bottom is another option, but what would be the reason
to keep them to start with? I could see a point if one can click on it and
search for the new location, but as it is now, it only shows in the list.

Hi,
Yes it would be nice to be able to remove them when no more useful or just
to hide them from people (as some stated) but don't make it automatic.
Sometimes, you may open QGIS without having access to the network where
projects are available. Having them cleared just because you didn't check
access before would not be convenient. Rather grey them (and add a cross on
each project for removal).

Yes, I hadn't thought about projects on network, good point. Adding a cross
to easily remove them is a good idea.

Hello,

I agree that manual removing is a better choice. 

What if you moved the project file? You can choose to remove it from your 
"recent projects" or maybe change the path when double clicking on it, a 
windows dialog ask you to define the correct path, in the same way we can do it 
for layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] rendering tests, what's the latest approach ?
Message-ID: <20151112153712.GA19202@localhost>

I've found a bug in rendering line-offsetted marker line symbols [1]
and wondering what's the currently recommended way to add a testcase.

[1] http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13811 or
    https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2442

Looking around I see many test files using the QgsRenderChecker
class in tests/src/core but the rationale is not clear to me.

Here's the list:

   regression992.cpp
   testqgsblendmodes.cpp
   testqgscomposerobject.cpp
   testqgscomposerutils.cpp
   testqgsdiagram.cpp
   testqgsgeometry.cpp
   testqgsgradients.cpp
   testqgsimageoperation.cpp
   testqgsinvertedpolygonrenderer.cpp
   testqgslabelingenginev2.cpp
   testqgslegendrenderer.cpp
   testqgslinefillsymbol.cpp
   testqgsmaprenderer.cpp
   testqgsmaprotation.cpp
   testqgspainteffect.cpp
   testqgspointpatternfillsymbol.cpp
   testqgsrasterfill.cpp
   testqgsrasterlayer.cpp
 * testqgsrenderers.cpp
   testqgsshapeburst.cpp

Then other files use the QgsMultiRenderChecker class instead:

   qgscompositionchecker.cpp
   testqgsblendmodes.cpp
   testqgsdiagram.cpp
   testqgsinvertedpolygonrenderer.cpp
   testqgspainteffect.cpp
   testqgsrasterfill.cpp
   testqgsrenderers.cpp
   testqgsshapeburst.cpp
 * testqgsstylev2.cpp
 * testqgssymbolv2.cpp

What's the difference between the two classes ?  Which one should I use ?
Should I put the new case in any existing file ?
(I've tagged the possible candidates with a star)

Simple answer: don't use rendering tests and find other means to check
it ;-)

If you still need, use the MultiRenderChecker, it is based on the
RenderChecker but adds more possibilities for anomalies. At least that's
the latest state of rendering tests I'm aware of...

How could I check that an arror is not flipped and does not move
to the other side of the line ?

To be honest, I like the idea of rendering tests. I know they are
fragile in their current incarnation, but being a graphical
application having tests actually check what the user would see
is a good way to catch many issues.

Ok, great. How about the distinction between these two files ?

  * testqgsstylev2.cpp
  * testqgssymbolv2.cpp

Actually, the second one is _not_ in the 2.8 branch (which I'm
targetting). Should it be back-ported ?

No idea, didn't check ;)

They won't go away. And there are good reasons for them sometimes. They
just have been used as roundhousekick tests for everything in the past.
But if every developer shortly asks himself if
 * there is no other possibility to test a particular thing
 * tries to reduce the noise in the picture as much as possible
it's fine to have some of them.

Backporting tests should always be fine. They don't break the
application but guarantee quality for subsequent point releases.

Hello i use this function to  take a shapefile, label it based on the
specified attribute name, and render an image. but i get a white image.
i use Qgis 2.12 .



def quick_export(self):
    file = QgsVectorLayer("path to shapefile", "BMAS", "ogr")
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(file)


#Adjust layer Settings
#Code sample from

     print "File is valid."


    mapRenderer = QgsMapRenderer()

    rect = file.extent()
    mapRenderer.setExtent(rect)
    mapRenderer.setLabelingEngine(QgsPalLabeling())

    lst = [file.id()]
    mapRenderer.setLayerSet(lst)

    mapRenderer.setLayerSet( lst )
    c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
    c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)
    x, y = 0, 0
    w, h = c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()
    composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, x,y,w,h)
    c.addItem(composerMap)
    composerLabel = QgsComposerLabel(c)

    composerLabel.adjustSizeToText()
    c.addItem(composerLabel)
    composerLabel.setItemPosition(20,10)
    composerLabel.setItemPosition(20,10, 100, 30)

    legend = QgsComposerLegend(c)
    legend.model().setLayerSet(mapRenderer.layerSet())
    c.addItem(legend)

#set image sizing
    dpi = c.printResolution()
    dpmm = dpi / 25.4
    width = int(dpmm * c.paperWidth())
    height = int(dpmm * c.paperHeight())
    img = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
    img.setDotsPerMeterX(dpmm * 1000)

I was actually thinking it would be nice to make producing such
tests easier, by allowing to just drop a .qgs project file in a
dir and have that trigger rendering on a small output image to
compare against a reference image.

Right now it takes sooo much time to write such tests

Message-ID: <000701d11d90$48d108d0$da731a70$@gispla.net>

Dear QGIS developers,

 

Let me introduce myself as I am new to the list. I'm a planetary geologist
and GIS specialist from the Netherlands. I'm involved in a PhD project on
the one hand and I'm a freelancer on the other hand. For my PhD I mainly use
ArcGIS+python, for my freelance work QGIS+python. My website is
www.gispla.net/en/ 

 

After reading the post about LANDSAT8 by Frank Warmerdam (1) I made a simple
QGIS processing script (2) which generates a polygon shapefile with
footprints out of http://landsat-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/scene_list.gz. I'm
used to reading and writing shapefiles using OGR (3) and with this script I
learned to do the same using PyQGIS.

 

I would like to request for this script to be added to
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing. Any comments are welcome.

 

Kind regards,

 

Jelmer Oosthoek

Hi all,
an interesting XSLT script to transform XML metadata in HTML:
https://github.com/aperi2007/xslt-mtd2html
all client side, without the need to load the metadata to a proper CSW
server, etc.
It can work one by one, or in batch.
Perhaps worth adding it to QGIS?
All the best.

Hi developers,

With OSX, QGIS 2.8.3 and higher, I found an error  what appears to be a 
regression (perhaps).
And with QGIS 2.12, the problem persists.

So, if you want to try to reproduce the error, open python console and try 
(with any active layer on editing mode):

>>> layer = iface.activeLayer()
>>> def listener(s, l):
>>>      print s, l

Then,

>>> layer.committedFeaturesRemoved.connect(listener)

Or

>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject
>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import SIGNAL
>>> QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL(r"committedFeaturesRemoved(QString, 
>>> QgsFeatureIds )"), listener)

It returns this error: “TypeError: C++ type 'QgsFeatureIds' is not supported 
as a signal argument type”

My English is so bad that nobody wants to answer me?

Hmm... for something like this (testing rendering of a line style), I
think a rendering test is perfectly acceptable! It's only when
rendering tests are used for things like checking geometry operations
that it's an issue IMO.

I personally think we've reached a good level of stability with the
rendering tests. They now perform consistently across all platforms
(passing when they should and failing when they shouldn't). So I'm
keen to hear any thoughts on why you think these are still fragile?

Hi,

Sometimes there is quiet a lot of traffic on this list and some
questions get forgotten. Or simply nobody knows the answer. Don't take
it personal :-)

I don't know if that's the reason, but you should use new-style signals.

iface.activeLayer().committedFeaturesRemoved.connect(listener)

Maybe it helps.

Best,
Matthias

It may have already been resolved by Jürgen in:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b5794b2f2ddc2eae746ad67eac8e899c44963d7c

Any chance you could test with the latest master version and confirm?

CDash shows many failures here (check 2.8.3-* builds):
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

All of them are rendering-based tests.

I'm sure the recent introduction of masks helps with that, but
it is evidently not easy enough to use.

Hi all,

If I use the "Set style for raster layer" tool in [Processing Toolbox > 
Advanced interface > QGIS algorithms > Raster general tools] the style 
is loaded but isn't applied. To apply the style I have to go to Layer 
Properties > Style and then click the Apply button. Is this a feature or 
a bug?

I will assume from the lack of response from this email that most are happy

If not let me know soon or else I will continue with it as planned above.

Hi Radim,
sorry, but I found some time only now for testing your suggestions..

Briefly: I didn't compiled GRASS, so it is in the folder /usr/bin/grass70

then I tried to add in the bash script the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for GRASS as
follows:

export
GRASS_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS/QGIS-Master/buildM/src/plugins/grass/7"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GRASS_INSTALL_PREFIX

but I'm always getting the same error when trying to create a new mapset:

Impossibile aprire il mapset. Blocco dei mapset fallito (exitStatus=0,
exitCode=127, errorCode=5, error=Unknown error stdout=,
stderr=/usr/lib/grass70/etc/lock: error while loading shared libraries:
libgrass_gis.7.0.1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory
)


Don't know how to handle this error and how to configure your GRASS
plugin..

Sorry for the noise..

Thanks

Matteo

Dear QGIS Users (with apologies for cross posting)

As you may be aware, we are in transition to the creation of a non profit organisation. If you would like to know more about this, please see my recent blog post on the QGIS blog : http://blog.qgis.org/2015/11/03/introducing-the-qgis-board/ <http://blog.qgis.org/2015/11/03/introducing-the-qgis-board/>

As part of the board formation process we will be allocating one voting member to each country QGIS user group around the world. We have set up a simple form to create a registry of all QGIS user groups and I would like to ask you to register your *group* here http://goo.gl/forms/1UCzt6Otyn

Please note this form is **not intended for individual members** - only the representative of each group should fill it in. Also please note that we will be posting the details provided on on this form on our website and may disseminate it in other ways. We will also be  sending regular emails to the country representatives.

Recognised country representatives will be entitled to vote on issues raised during out annual general meeting (we expect the first of which to be held in May 2016) such as annual budget plans and so on.


If you have any questions or concerns about this process, please do not hesitate to contact me - either on or off list.


With thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unable to Disable Panels at Startup from Custom
	Config Location
Message-ID: <255150579-14364@kmail.b3partners.nl>

Hi,


I originally posted this question on the QGIS Stackexchange but haven't got any answers yet. Maybe someone here can help me out?


***

I'm trying to start QGIS 2.8 with the minimal GUI possible so I can reskin QGIS for a custom plugin. Unfortunately I'm not able to get rid of the Layers and Overview panels when saving the configuration into a custom location when starting QGIS with the options --configpath --optionspath. Everything else is customizable, I'm able to hide all the menus, but even though all the panels are marked as false in the QGISCUSTOMIZATION2.ini they still show up as displayed in the picture http://i.stack.imgur.com/31hMT.png.
The funny thing is that if I let the application store the values in the windows registry, all the panels are disabled fine, but because this has to be shipped to approximately 40 - 50 clients I'd rather accomplish this with the QGISCUSTOMIZATION2.ini and the QGIS2.ini files rather than using the registry.
Any ideas?
***
Thanks,


-Tariq Al-Sadoon

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with using QGIS custom widgets in plugin
Message-ID: <CALuHMPBqE7zL73QCghZwng+WiCGoKgUiqgBejK-Jj6gQkPqn7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I use QGIS custom widgets in my plugin, namely QgsMaplayerComboBox.
When I run QGIS under Linux all works fine, but under Windows I got Python
error on startup related to missed enum entries:

   File "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python27\lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\__init__.py",
line 210, in loadUiType
    winfo = compiler.UICompiler().compileUi(uifile, code_string,
from_imports, resource_suffix)

I use QGIS LTR installed via OSGeo4W installer. Same problem also exists
with dev and release versions. Any ideas what is wrong and how to fix this?

I got a similar issue using QgsFieldExpressionWidget.
After compiling ui with pyuic4 I found that the import statement at the end
of the compiled .py was wrong. So I manually changed it to:
from qgis.gui import QgsFieldExpressionWidget

Ah. There's an easy answer for that - all the rendering test related
improvements landed in QGIS 2.10, and have not been backported to 2.8.
I started to do this at one stage, but in the end it's a considerable
amount of work which I couldn't find time to complete.

Great!
I use mac version from Kyngchaos website. I never compiled QGIS on OSX... nor 
Debian indeed...
When is the next release which integrate this commit?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crash calling OpenFeatureForm from python
Message-ID: <1447672559689-5236589.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
we have a sytematic crash with QGIS here (all tested versions). 

We open custom UI forms with python associated so that user do not have to
manually enable and close editing on the layers (form with qgis relation
widget on another layer). 
Crash occurs when opening simultaneously twos forms fo the same feature.
Saving any edit crashes. 
Using native form opening action from identify window does not crash. 

We saw references [1] [2] and qgis API warning about OpenFeatureForm and
preloadForm workaround [3]. Please find python scripts associated to layer
here [4] 

We couldn't have this workaround change anything. Especially, I have no clue
that preloadForm(myuifile.ui) works well. When loading a wring file path, I
have no error. 

Any idea?
Cheers
Régis

Hi,

I am having problems creating a multilayer line symbol with this code :

         symbol = QgsLineSymbolV2.createSimple({})
         symbol.deleteSymbolLayer(0)

         symbolLine = QgsSimpleLineSymbolLayerV2()
         symbol.appendSymbolLayer(symbolLine)

         symbolArrow = QgsMarkerSymbolV2.createSimple({})
         symbolArrow.deleteSymbolLayer(0)

         symbolArrowLayer = QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2()
         symbolArrow.appendSymbolLayer(symbolArrowLayer)

         symbolLineArrow = QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2()
         symbolLineArrow.setSubSymbol(symbolArrow) # Causes crash !!!

         symbol.appendSymbolLayer(symbolLineArrow)

Is there something wrong in this code ?
Has anybody already had this issue ?

Thank for helping,

This was discussed earlier on the list
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Compiling-ui-files-with-custom-widgets-creates-wrong-imports-td5218684.html
Here's the bug report http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13428

This happens because PyQt is not aware of qgis_customwidgets.py located in
qgis\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins folder.

Hi Régis,

The same issue was previously seen when using global variables in the
python logic attached to the form. Global variables are global, so
there's only one of them and when you open two forms they interfere.

Best,
Matthias

aaahh yes, we'll check that tomorrow!

In fact, we had two crashes in the same event, really rare thing. 

First one is a GEOS crash with a centroid fill with "force point in polygon"
option checked. A fix has been ported in 2.8 by Martin, but apparently,
crashes remain, even with simplify renderering disabled. I cheated that with
a postgis stPointonSurface view.. 

We were trying to avoid the OpenFeatureForm bug by preventing opening twice
the same form.. pretty awful piece of code. Hope your suggestion helps. 

Thanks again Matthias
Cheers

Régis

Hello Nikhil,

there are many ways to contribute, if you feel like coding, you could start
from http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues and pick up one or
more of the issues and try to fix them.

Here are our some useful links:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Developers_Corner (old)
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL

Hi!

I notice a dysfunction when I change the destination CRS by activating On The 
Fly function from the python console.
Coordinates which are displayed in the overview box (at the bottom), are 
wrong, not metric, no decimals...

Please try:
>>> iface.mapCanvas().setCrsTransformEnabled(True)
>>> crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(3857, 
>>> QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId)
>>> iface.mapCanvas().setDestinationCrs(crs)

Then, take a look at coordinates which are displayed.

Thank you for your help!

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673YDdhLodX8a_H3BfSMzxh83pMPqpYjBPL-Od4SJFU1Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

it seems that the widget's expression context does not have access to the
currently edited record.

Maybe I've just not found a way to do that but it's impossible to filter
relations with an expression built upon the the values of the "main" record
(the one currently edited in the form) because $currentfeature refers to
the relation layer,

A possible solution would be to add a $currentformfeature to the expression
and add the edited feature to the expression context.

Would it be a possible solution?
Any hint?

Without looking into it in detail, adding this to the expression context
sounds like a good idea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Segmentation Faults using Qgis 2.12
 (QgsPalLayerSettings & QgsComposition)
Message-ID: <564B3218.3040005@openocean.fr>

Hello,

I am running Qgis 2.12.0-Lyon with python2.7. I developed my program 
under Qgis 2.8 and then 2.10. Now I encounter segmentation faults when I 
create instances of :

  * qgis.core.QgsPalLayerSettings: pallay = qgis.core.QgsPalLayerSettings()
      o In my program, this is called after loading a QgsVectorLayer.
      o Loading named styles from QML doesn't cause any problem
        (loadNamedStyle method of QgsVectorLayer instance)
      o But manually creating my own style in this way is not possible
        since the upgrade.
  * qgis.core.QgsComposition: composition =
    qgis.core.QgsComposition(canvas.mapSettings())
      o this instance is created after loading all the layers into the
        canvas and setting the renderer for each of them
      o I seems canvas.mapRenderer() is deprecated, so I tried to init
        this with canvas.mapSettings() ; it crashes anyway

Are these bugs reported ? I could not find anything similar in the 
reported Issues of QGis 2.12.

Thank you,

I can't find the original discussion this relates too... What's the issue

Hi,

when using QgsValueRelationWidget I would like to be able to filter the
related items on the value from another column in the currently edited
feature.

I need an expression in the related layer which is based on a value in the
current feature, but in the context of the related layer $currentfeature is
not the feature currently being edited but the related feature.

So, we need to pass the feature or the feature ID to the widget or (better)
to the context, which is currently non possible since the call to
QgsValueRelationWidgetFactory::createCache populates the combo on widget
init and cannot be changed.

A possible solution is to add the currently edited feature informations to
the context (currentFeatureContext or something similar) and then retrieve
the feature information with $currentformfeature or the like.


Suggestions welcome!

Hi,

I also noticed a crash with a python code for a feature form.
Once I deleted the pyc file, it went well.
I supposed this was due to upgrading the QGIS version.
Is this expected behavior due to different libs?

Thanks,

Denis

Missing is the path to GRASS libs, try

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/bin/grass70/lib/

check also if /usr/bin/grass70/lib/libgrass_gis.7.0.1.so exists.

My plugin Travis test output consistently gives the following
errors/warnings:

- Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":99"

- ERROR:sandbox_linux.cc(308)] InitializeSandbox() called with multiple
threads in process gpu-process

- ERROR:gpu_process_transport_factory.cc(402)] Failed to establish GPU
channel

See, for example, https://travis-ci.org/tomchadwin/qgis2web/builds/91798616.

I'm making the uninformed assumption that these are harmless. However, they
make the test output hard to read. Does anyone know how to get rid of any of
them? I've tried upgrading Firefox to 42.0 and passing "-extension RANDR" in
xvfb-run server-args. No effect. Any ideas?

By the way, this is an example of why a plugins mailing list would be
extremely useful, as per recent discussions. My question is about Travis,
not QGIS, so some might think it off-topic here. It would be very much
relevant on a plugins list.

So, I'm aware that my question might not be regarded as relevant to this
list, but if anyone does have any thoughts anyway, I'd be very grateful.

finally it seems working now.. the problem was (beside my ignorance.. :)
) that executable of grass are here:

/usr/bin/grass70

while hte libraries are here:

/usr/lib/grass70/lib

adding

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/grass70/lib/

solves the problem!

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Matching canvas dimensions on workstation to

Message-ID: <1447866300830-5237237.post@n6.nabble.com>

What is the default canvas size when QGIS is invoked in Travis - in other
words, when QGIS is run for the first time after installation on Ubuntu? I
have tests for qgis2web, but if I do:

mapCanvas().setExtent(layer.extent())

I get different values for the bounds of the canvas extent in the Travis
test compared to my workstation. The test is invoked with the following
screen size:

xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0, 1024x768x24"

So, how can I match my desktop environment to get the same canvas bounds
that Travis gets?

Good question !
The script run by travis is: ci/travis/linux/script.sh
There's no specification of server-args there.
I think it would be great if "make check" could do a predictable
thing on all systems. Or at least start doing some more, as per
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12172

Alternatively, how can I alter the size of the xvfb test QGIS instance
window/GUI to a given size? Either approach would allow me to match test
output from Travis to known good sample output from my workstation.

Message-ID: <CAP=p+Yu7iVPm9+2nzxLVjE_mMffBNRqk+62963q67chVLO7jDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, I hope this is the right list to send my question to.

      I am currently developing a QGIS plugin (Python + Cython) for
transportation planning/modeling that has a LOT of stuff built-in.

      Let me explain my current problem with an example.

      To perform traffic assignment on a network, I have two steps:

1 - Convert the link layer into a graph
2 - Perform traffic assignment

   For a number of technical reasons pertinent to the transportation
modeling practice, these steps NEED to be independent.

   What i want is to be able to run the first step (with its own GUI) and,
when running the 2nd step (a different GUI), accessing directly the results
of the first step in memory.

   My question is: Is there a way to do this?  Can I run a Python plugin
and leave something in memory for a different procedure to pick it up and
use it?

 My current approach is pickling the object that contains the graph and
dumping to disk, but it seems not really elegant.

Thanks,

Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Addressing a discrepancy between substr and strpos
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=rFMwM72ys=p09RGFtkSRQi_TTusSf-uSfmFuH6jNvg0A@mail.gmail.com>

QGIS' expression engine has two string functions – substr() and strpos() –
using two distinct character count standards. The substr() character count
begins with 1, as per the equivalent postgresql string function. The
strpos() character count however begins with 0, as per Qt / python's
equivalent string function.

This is a pretty ugly state of affairs as one expects those two functions
to rely on the same character count method.

For .e.g, here's a practical example: the expression
substr('1234;1234',0,strpos('1234;1234',';')) would – in QGIS – return
'123' because of the character count discrepancy between the two functions.
That's very, very ugly and counter-intuitive.

IMHO, substr()'s adherence to postgresql is the right way to go in the
context of QGIS expressions, which means addressing this issue would mean
fixing strpos() so its count starts at 1.

Now, the question is, should – and if so how – we address this yuckiness.
Should we leave things as it is, and add a note in the documentation about
the discrepancy? Or should we fix strpos() acknowledging the longer we wait
the harder it'll be, and make sure the changelog has a big bright note for
users to know a fix has been applied?

Awaiting opinions.

Sorry, the expression should have been
substr('1234;1234',*1*,strpos('1234;1234',';')),
which in QGIS returns '123'.

Applied to which object? iface.size? If so, I don't know if that will work in
a Travis test, into which a dummy iface has to be injected.

I'd consider this a (fixed) bug.

I can't get this to work. I tried adding a canvas resize in the test script,
and also doing the same from my workstation Python console, but it didn't
change the test result bounds - they are still different to the bounds of my
local instance.

I then noticed that the dummy iface script (taken from InaSAFE) already
explicitly resizes the canvas. I still can't get it to work, though. Nothing
I do to the test seems to change the result of canvas.extent().

Another approach (depending on your requirements) might be looking into
the QgsMultiRenderChecker
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsMultiRenderChecker.html which has been
developped for comparing rendering results in unit tests.
Look into the QGIS test suite for dozens of examples.

No, I'm not looking to compare images, but output code (HTML, JS, CSS). On
my simplest test, the test output matches my reference output generated
manually from my desktop QGIS install, other than the bounds coordinates.
After resizing the canvas to 400x400, my desktop gives:

[46.467810665,6.365579615],[55.021370435,14.919139385]

The test gives:

[47.6981716,-0.605956623077],[53.7910095,21.8906756231]

By the way, this *should* all be EPSG:4326, but since I'm not really a GIS
person, I start to get twitchy when dealing with CRSes and projections.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server - use PGSYSCONFDIR in a server with no
	postgresql installed
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5aBFg3QeTZq7S_9gWu5m2Hq-xPP7WGsi7=DJsOGPoD_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have installed QGIS Server in one server (called "map") and PostGreSQL on
another (called "pg" ), both on Ubuntu Server 14.04
I would like to access to database only with PostGreSQL services, so in the
map server, I did the following steps:

* Create a folder /etc/postgresql
* Create a file /etc/postgresql/pg_service.conf  with some credentials
* Install postgresql-client to be able to use psql
* Add a environment variable PGSYSCONFDIR  and export it (plus add it in
/etc/environment ). Variable : PGSYSCONFDIR=/etc/postgresq'l
* Test via psql "service=myservice"  -> I can connect to the database and
get data

When I ask QGIS Server for the GetCapabilities, the layers configured with
this service cannot be added. I get the error : "Service myservice not
found"

So I added the following line in the fcgid.conf file to explicitely tell
Apache (and QGIS Server) to use this value.
FcgidInitialEnv PGSYSCONFDIR "/etc/postgresql"

But nothing works. I even tried to chmod and chown the service file and
folder to let Apache user www-data to read it. I also tried with a quick
and dirty chmod 777 , with no luck.

Has anyone some experience in setting up a Server with no postgresql
installed locally, and use the pg_service.conf file with QGIS Server ?

Thanks a lot for any clue
Michaël

Hi Michaël, 

This works for me. 

My pg_service.conf file is at /etc/pg_service.conf

And in the Apache configuration it is specified in two files: 

/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/env.conf :

SetEnv PGSYSCONFDIR "/etc"

and in  

/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf 

FcgidInitialEnv PGSYSCONFDIR "/etc"

I am not sure which one is really used or has precedence - I suspect it
is the fcgid.conf file. 

Hope you get this working, 

Andreas

Thanks Andreas for your help.

I also think fcgid.conf is the "winner", but I will try your configuration
( move pg_service.conf to /etc/ and add the setenv in Apache env.conf ).
Could you please give me the result of

ls -lh /etc/pg_service.conf

command, so that I completely mimic your configuration ?

Cheers,
Michaël

Hi Andreas,

It worked like a charm with your exact configuration.

I will remove the env.conf file to see if it still works without this conf.
If so, this would mean the pg_service.conf file situated in
/etc/postgresql/ could not be read. Probably wrong permissions on the
folder /etc/postgresql.

Thanks again for your help

I add a todo to remember adding this in QGIS Server documentation.

Regards
Michaël

I just tested, and the file /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/env.conf  with
SetEnv PGSYSCONFDIR "/etc"

is indeed important. Commenting this line would lead to no connection
possible by QGIS Server, even if the env variable is correctly set in
fcgid.conf.

This is the first time I see this behaviour (fcgid.conf not setting
properly an env variable)

yes - Apache confs are sometimes a mystery ...

Hi all,
we are having this error when trying to load a particular table. I
suppose there is a wrong value in the table, however QGIS should handle
it mor egracefully, I believe.
Is this worth a ticket?
Thanks.

Short summary, after brief discussion about if there was a plugin to
pull SRTM (DEM) data for the canvas (which we never found), we turned to
discussing the possibility of build a framework for public data
downloading by canvas extent.

We want to avoid duplication of the same common core functionality, and
make it easy to plug new data in, and for users to be able to find what
they're looking for.

Ideally to me this is just an improvement to CSW, WCS and WFS. However
many such data sets don't exist under services, and are just file based
downloads.

This email is to gauge interest in co-developing such an option in QGIS.

Ideas welcome and encouraged.

Thanks,
Alex

A framework for the common parts would be nice, or an easily clone-able
basic plugin that just needs a specialized function to each service.

Of course, this is kind of the point of CSW, WCS and WFS standards. And
we really should encourage the use of standards.

This idea is similar to the getData function of the Raster package in R:
http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/functions/getData

Which does include the 90m SRTM already processed (CGIAR version
http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/)

I'd be interested in moving this discussion to the developer list and
participating. I'm involved with the management of the data for the
above mentioned R function.

Thanks,
Alex

Apparently removing the character ° in one of the records avoids the issue.
All the best.

One option is to have metadata records which clearly articulate direct
/ actionable download links and make these metadata available via CSW.

Then, using MetaSearch, one can query a given CSW, get the metadata
back, display the links and download the data.

There's an existing ticket open in MetaSearch discussing this functionality [1].

I would recommend this as a standards-based option.  Assuming data
links are documented properly in metadata available via CSW, the rest
just works.  MetaSearch would need to be extended to action a download
link to download to disk, load, and son on.

Hi,

This is a great idea.
We could use this framework to add layers based on web services. For
example a web service returning a GeoJSON based on some parameters + canvas
extent. The idea would be to have an option to download only once, or to
download for each canvas refresh (zoom out, pan, etc.) ? I would love to
have the latter (with the possibility to cache features already downloaded
once)

Regards
Michaël

Hi Tim, Victor[1], John [2], Nathan [3] and Gary [4]

Good initiative which I also would keep in a sandbox so long.
I'd like to check my plugins against (and probably contribute to) this
common set of functions for QGIS Python plugins.

[1] seems to be the unifid place and this has been changed since 21 days.
Is this the common set for now?

I'm admitting defeat on this one for the moment. I'll have to test only
output which does not set numeric bounds. Ah well. If someone figures this
out, do let us know.

Thanks Jürgen.

I realized too late my expression example was wrong, but glad the bigger
point raised was understood :)

Hi all,
Glad the idea is gaining followers. I believe relevant plugin writers
(FAO, NASA, etc. downloaders) could be embarked, as they wil be the
first profiting from an easier integration.
I'm available for some help on this side.
All the best.

We opened this repo to work in there

https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis_wrappers

Nathan moved his code there already. I haven't had much time, but will move
mine and keep working in there

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsVectorLayer
Message-ID: <002201d1237d$96cc4a70$c464df50$@gispla.net>

Dear all,

 

On the standalone 64-bit QGIS Wien version on Win7 I was able to run the
following code using Python in the OSGeo4W Shell:

 

import os

from PyQt4.QtCore import *

from PyQt4.QtGui import *

from qgis.core import *

from qgis.gui import *

 

qgis_prefix = os.getenv("QGIS_PREFIX_PATH")

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(qgis_prefix, True)

QgsApplication.initQgis()

 

inshpfile = "test.shp"

layer = QgsVectorLayer(inshpfile, "shapefile", "ogr")

# do stuff with layer

 

As a prerequisite I had to add the following three yellow lines to
OSGeo4W.bat first before running the shell (with Lyon here of course Wien):

 

@echo off

rem Root OSGEO4W home dir to the same directory this script exists in

call "%~dp0\bin\o4w_env.bat"

 

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\QGIS Lyon\apps\qgis\python

set PATH=C:\Program Files\QGIS Lyon\apps\qgis\bin;%PATH%

set QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Program Files\QGIS Lyon\apps\qgis

 

rem List available o4w programs

rem but only if osgeo4w called without parameters

@echo on

@if [%1]==[] (cmd.exe /k o-help) else (cmd /c "%*")

 

But since I installed QGIS Pisa and then Lyon, Python crashes at the layer =
QgsVectorLayer(.) line, whether or not I have an actual test.shp available.
The module which causes the crash is QtCore4.dll.

Can someone maybe reproduce the crash? And if so, any idea what might be the
cause?

 

Kind regards,

 

Jelmer Oosthoek

 

Ps. Attached are test.py and test.shp.

If I go to http://qgis.org/api/2.12/classQgsBlendModeComboBox.html
I see that the class has been classified in
http://qgis.org/api/2.12/group__gui.html

If I go to http://qgis.org/api/2.12/classQgsMapLayerComboBox.html, the
class does not have any group whereas I would expect this class to be in
the same gui group.

Why? Both are in the same src/gui directory and in Python QGIS API, doing
the following

print [c for c in dir(qgis.gui) if 'QgsMapLayerComboBox' in c] # return the
QgsMapLayerComboBox class but it's Python not C++...

Any idea if it's normal? How can I help to improve this part if it's not
normal?

FYI, I didn't find an obvious keyword in *.h and *.c files for both classes
explaining why one is included in the doc and the other not. I also looked
at the doxy file template (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/cmake_templates/Doxyfile.in
without success.

Cheers and regards

The difference is that QgsBlendModeComboBox has the documentation group
set, but not QgsMapLayerComboBox. See:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsblendmodecombobox.h#L25

Vs

QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsmaplayercombobox.h#L26

This should be fixed in QgsMapLayerComboBox.h . I suspect there's lots of
missing groups... Perhaps I should also add this to the documentation unit
test to prevent it in future.

Hi Alessandro,

I found this inside your report from Las Palmas:

"We didn’t miss the occasion to talk about the ugly bug that affects
fTools, not something I’m going to dig into in this post though."

Could you please suggest me some link and info about that bug, I can study ?


Thank you

I tend to forget to specify the group. I wonder if doxygen couldn't
extract this information from the directory structure instead of having
to explicitly state it in the source file.
Having to specify this information manually seems just a bit tedious for
not much added value.

Message-ID: <CAAfMyG0G5CKhca4gogkUMGSJ2uUJ6g271yDHh05CtzjBzhT9OA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a QgsComposerMap that I want to zoom to the extent of a feature in a
vector layer.

geomBBRect = geometry.boundingBox()
myComposerMap.zoomToExtent(geomBBRect)

I am trying to use zoomToExtent to make the map show the correct area.
However, I get a blank map when I run my code. If I check what the current
scale is, its returned as 'nan'.

I tried using setNewExtent() before, but this alters the size of my
QgsComposerMap. I want to keep the same map size each time.

After doing a little bit of checking, it seems that:

myComposerMap.currentMapExtent().xMinimum()))
myComposerMap.currentMapExtent().xMaximum()))

both return 'nan' but yMinimum and yMaximum return coordinates.

I can not figure out why. Can anyone help shed any light on the problem? I
can provide more code if needed.

James

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tool to pick up linear referencing measure from
	mouse
Message-ID: <1448298050288-5238110.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm having a classical use case here. Before starting a new plugin, and
since it is a very common task in GIS, I would like to know if anyone has
made something alike:

- I have a postgis db with LINESTRINGM routes (watercourses already
calibrated with measures).

- I have a non geometric table registering events with start and end
measures + identifier of my routes (watercours ID). 

- I create my event in the attribute table, with one ID and two manually
typed measures, then a view cast it to spatial view using
locate_beetween_measure function. 

I would like to create a form with two tools dedicated to "pick up" my route
and the measure. i've done it in Arcview 3.2 once in the old past.. 
What could be the current better and simpler approach in QGIS? 

LRS plugin does not have that feature, and requires to recalibrate layers
from scratch.

Could we dream for the future of a new generic form widget with custom
expressions to get attributes or geometric information from a layer (with
snapping options )?  

Cheers

Régis

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgYvYzu+eDGjiA90UtfkryMUHjs_dd9_soS4osRp2m5Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

If you are following the psc list, you've probably seen the thread
discussing current shortcomings of ftools (
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2015-November/003623.html)

In short, the key issues are:
1. When ftools encounter issues with certain features, warning messages get
written to the log but this is largely hidden from users since they would
actively have to actively monitor the log. The problematic features are
then missing from the results but this is not always obvious.
2. The above issue is more common now (since 2.10) since underlying
libraries more often (and correctly so) produce geometry collections as
outputs. These geometry collections are not handled well by the current
ftools code which is much older.

To address these issues, the following suggestions have been made so far:
ad issue 1: update fTools to warn users when some features cause problems
ad issue 2: quick fix fTools to convert geometry collections to single
geometry types

For the warnings, there's already a first PR draft
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2432 which needs to be fleshed out.

These fixes/updates would be made available as fTools updates via the
plugin installer asap.

If you have ideas how to handle this efficiently or have already
implemented code that addresses similar issues, let us know.

It would be good to have a quick discussion in order to be able to provide
improvements fast.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I didn't find much on coding guidelines and I'm not sure about what to do,
it seems that this is treated differently in different parts of the code.

An example:

in the vector layer configuration dialog, the user can enter ad UI file for
the custom form, if the specified file does not exist it is simply ignored
(no errors or warnings are shown to the user).

Being in a GUI context, I think that warning the user about a not-critical
misconfiguration would be the right thing to do.

Do we have any convention or best practice to follow in this case?

Hi Regis,

I dont know if it's exactly what you are looking for but I had a same question.
It was not for a plugin but for a standalone app. Form looks like screenshot joined
I can send you ui and  class behind the form. Lots of things are hard-coded (standalone app)

It's a mash-up from first LRS plugin (Martin Dobias), others, and at least  personal stuff ;-)
PS: I have same for point event

A function that takes a geometry type and extracts the longest line / 
the largest polygon / the first point from the geometry collection 
should be straightforward to do.

plugin installer asap

If the fix does not take too long, we probably don't need a warning at all.

Marco

Expressions can be inserted in "custom actions" of a layer. Could it help ?

Hi Marco

Good to have your feedback, you probably know the problem best.

Is there no requirement for multi types?
Based on what indicator should be chosen what to extract? Try polygons
first, if there are none try lines, if there are none take points?

How much effort (in time) do you think is required to implement this fix?

Hi,

I've had a quick look to this issue in Las Palmas, the multi-geom issue
doesn't seem particularly hard to fix,  a possible solution is to keep only
geometry types of the same (simple or multi) type of the original layer,
transforming the multi to simple and feeding the original fTools with
simple geometries.

My  quick and dirty estimation is 4-5 days, Python tests included (the
tests are really not a an option in this case I guess).

Hi Alessandro, Matthias

 >Is there no requirement for multi types?

Afaik, the problem for f-tools are not the multi types, but only the 
geometry collections (containing geometries with different shape type). 
In my experience, if geos returns a geometry collection, it usually 
contains one 'expected' geometry and the others are slivers (@strk, 
please correct me if wrong).

 >Based on what indicator should be chosen what to extract? Try polygons 
first, if there are none try lines, if there are none take points?

One possibility would be to pass the expected shapetype (Point / Line / 
Polygon) to the function and take the best candidate (e.g. longest line, 
largest polygon area).

 >How much effort (in time) do you think is required to implement this fix?

Difficult to estimate. It seems straightforward to implement the 
extraction function. Then it needs to be called by the f-tools 
internally and be tested with a few examples. If unit tests are required 
(as mentioned by Alessandro), this seems to be the most time consuming 
task to me.

Regards,
Marco

Hi everybody,

maybe I am misstaken but I doubt it is that easy: If you intersect a 
line and a polygon layer you would expect a line layer as output, If you 
intersect two polygon layers the output could be polygons or lines 
(partially identical boundary) or points (only one identical boundary 
vertex) but you would expect polygons, wouldn't you?
So maybe the rule is: If both input layers are of the same type the 
output layer should be of this type, if both are of different type, 
output should be the lowest input type (low -> high = point -> line -> 
polygon).

There *could* be another problem, too [1]: 2.5D geometries, although I 
did not investigate this it should be checked because users cannot see 
the difference between them and regular 2D geometries.

I was mostly thinking about collections that contain a multitype with
several parts which are not considered slivers. This seems to be a very
valid scenario.

Before the geometry changes, the algorithms were able to provide the
results without this additional information. How was that done?

Unit Tests for processing are on my todo list anyway (I think as a psc
member you should have voted for that ;) )

It is, but it was also not handled by f-tools <= 2.8.

Not sure. Maybe the logic in the geos -> QgsGeometry conversion handled 
the collections differently.

I think that now (>=2.8), when QGIS geometry supports M (measure), the
measure calculated for the nearest point on the identified line
could/should be added to derived attributes in standard identify
results.

Similarly Locate, Create events and Calculate measures tools in the
LRS plugin should be extended  to support existing layers with
measure.

Hi all

I had a detailed look with the debugger at what happens in the different 
versions. It turned out fTools does indeed handle geometry collections, 
but assumed a geometry collection has wkb type 'unknown' (which was true 
<= 2.8, but now geometry collections are not unknown anymore). Commit 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/594fafe73b80d91d94b962c2e51aea0b0168a08a 
should solve the issue and bring back the old behaviour.

Regards,
Marco

It is, but it was also not handled by f-tools <= 2.8.

Not sure. Maybe the logic in the geos -> QgsGeometry conversion handled
the collections differently.

Thank you Marco,

Are you confident that these are the only places that need changes, so
does this mean that there is no more reason for a warning and we just
need a quick point release?
I applied the same to processing and did some changes to your fix to
make it work also for union and clip.

Regards
Matthias

Hi Alessandro,
I'd suggest that failing silently is probably the worst situation for 
the user, and the code-guidelines should be updated.
The user thinks they're getting what they want and instead their request 
is being ignored. These sorts of things usually lead to users wasting 
lots of time trying to figure out what's wrong when all that needs to 
happen is to tell them (we've all had it happen to us I'm sure).

Just my 2p.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS docs
Message-ID: <2B12DCF7-D572-4AB2-8997-C97F19A89974@gmail.com>

Hi,

I’m trying to wrap my head around the state of documentation in QGIS.

There is:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation
and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website

It seems like qgis/QGIS-Documentation corresponds to http://docs.qgis.org
Whereas qgis/QGIS-Website corresponds to http://qgis.org

That makes sense.

However, then things get weird for me:

This page http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html links to 2.8 docs (see https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13212 <https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13212> about getting 2.10/2.12 up)

But when I look at the source:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/docs/index.rst <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/docs/index.rst>

The latest version referenced is QGIS 2.2

Can anyone link me to the source for this page that’s actually building the site? 

Also, can you shed some light on how the site *actually* get built/published operationally? Is there just someone with the keys to the web server that builds it and uploads the HTML when they get time? Is anyone currently responsible for this?

Thanks for any help! Excited to help contribute to the QGIS Docs and eager to make other folks more productive that I was when I first came to QGIS.

M

Well, thanks Nyall, Radim and Pierre for your lights !

I suppose that means that in 2.14, I'll be able to make my own tool calling
identify classes to get vertex measure. So good! 

Radim, do you have plans to extend LRS in 2016? If you have sponsors looking
for co-funders, I would be interested in having it work with existing
M-geometries, and have tools to generate events by picking locations on the
map.  

Last question now :) 

I need to make an edit form, with inline with some attributes (measure, or x
/ y) that user shall use to go picking those data from the canvas. Behind
the button, I need to code some behaviour, like target layer, snapping
options, fields or geometry information to catch, and of course destination
field. 
Is this possible with a python init script, without any plugin?

If so, that allows me to distribute project + ui file + .py and have it work
with no plugin install or additional configuration. 
Any snippet to point me in the right direction?  (When done, I will submit
it to pyqgis cookbook, this would be great to share). 
All the best
Régis

alessandro Pasotti has a pull request that probably is what you are looking
for

Figured it out, the body the template was not being used as there is a special layout for the documentation page.

I’ve removed the confusing code and added an explanatory comment here:

Currently not. I'll keep it in mind and let you know if something
comes up, but currently there are no plans.

Message-ID: <CAKse6173xjs4rixMRq8fq3CU54Wkvk+sjbSdTX-r0hE5MbHwXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and qgis-server_2.12.0. The wms service is
working correctly but wfs no, I can't get data.
For testing I install qgis-mapserver, the default package from  ubuntu
14.04 and wfs returns data.

Any idea?

Thanks.

Hi,

Did you enable the WFS layers in the OWS tab? Note that if a WMS is 
enabled, it doesn't mean that your layers are automatically published as 
WFS - you have to opt in for that.

If they are enabled, it probably sounds like a bug, at least in your 
package.

Hi,

I updated the release schedule to include dates for the point release[0].  I
think it's easier to have fixes dates there too - instead of a "some-period of
silence" rule.

The next point release for 2.8.x and 2.12.x will be on Friday.

Any objections?   Nyall and I finished our backports from 2.12 to 2.8 and
apparently the ftools issue is fixed too.

Hi!

According to my tests with Intersect and Union the ftools problem is
fixed now .. so this only "leaves" 2.10 without a fix -  which we
apperently don't need (people using 2.10 should upgrade to 2.12
anyway)..

Well done!

thanks

What a relief, thanks Marco, Werner, Juergen, and all!
Probably we should advertise this, and suggest everybody to upgrade
immediately.
We should put tests in place ASAP to avoid having these problems in the
future.
All the best.

Message-ID: <6d93110c5cee4b8eba3c1a97d1ad567b@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Hi,

I am trying to build a custom QGIS installer using creatensis.pl on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Unfortunately I am getting errors during unpacking:

"tar: A lone zero block at 380
tar: apps/Qt4: Cannot mkdir: Permission denied"

And apps/Qt4 indeed has unknown permissions: "d????????? ? ? ? ?"

After that I need sudo to remove unpacked-x86...

It happens rather randomly. Even packages which worked fine the first run throw errors on the next. However, it happens on every try both with master and release branch, and on both Ubuntu 14.04 LTS boxes I tried...

Any help would be very much appreciated...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi,

That's a good idea - to have fixed dates for point releases.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass module don't appear
Message-ID: <DUB123-W2EE2844EFB1E2B17EE77CE5050@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I'm working on qgis 2.13.0-master 77526bd compiled on ubuntu 15.04.
Today I discovered that some important grass7 module are not present in the processing toolbox.
Just to be clear, I compiled qgis only with grass7 (I not put the path for grass on ccmake configuration).

Firtly I needed r.null, which was absent. Following the guide grass7.txt file present in 
/usr/share/qgis/python/processing/algs/grass7/
I create a txt file for r.null and I put it on the /description
Then I restarted qgis, but the new module was not present.
I checked my grass7 installation and r.null is present and it works.

Then I searched for r.mapcalculator, which was present in the old processing toolbox. I didn't find it
in the grass7 processing modules list. Although the grass7 stand alone has r.mapcalc (not r.mapcalculator),
in the grass7 processing toolbox neither r.mapcalculator nor r.mapcalc are present.

I wonder if is it possible to add grass7 module thus I can insert r.null, then I would like to know if
I can put in r.mapcalculator or r.mapcalc at least.

Thank you

Eugenio

+1 for the point release. And one release a month as scheduled seems
reasonable to me. But since every user can not download and install each
release, it'll be worth listing the bugs that are fixed. So the user can
clearly evaluate if it's worth updating QGIS according to his needs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Intensive work with print composer become hard due
	to some bugs. Any help?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSr6x-jG3VwkcGyTQYaghkYnhwBdHGCEPnB+97wu6hE7cQ@mail.gmail.com>

Looking at the quick way FTools bugs have been fixed, I realized once again
how FOSS community can be reactive. And this is just amazing, impressive.
Big up to u!
So, since there are some bugs in print composer that make it hard to use
for daily and intensive compositions, can I ask for your help to fix these
ones:

- layer style in composer doesn't follow the style of the layer in canvas
when using preset (see [0] simplier expressed again here [1])
- adding a legend adds all the layers in the project and there's no quick
way to have just needed items (see [2] or [3])
- there are another bugs or ways of improvement but it would be nice if one
of the upcoming releases can fix the two listed above.

Thanks to you

Hi,
I'm trying to write QGIS 2.12 documentation and encounter some issues about
icon substitutions. Copy features actions seems to have different icons:
- mActionEditCopy [0] (in identify results panel, Configure shortcuts
dialog, Edit menus and toolbar, ... [1] ) with a white background
- mActionCopySelected [2] (in attribute table, Custom projection, Raster
save as ...[3]) with a yellow background.

Is there a reason to keep two different icons?
If it's a bug, which one should be kept? I can then fill a PR in QGIS code.

In Processing GRASS r.mapcalc can't be added, unless doing some work, see

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6894

on the other hand in GRASS 7 r.mapcalculator is not available, so it
is not also in Processing.

Hi all,
For the WSGI Search capabilities on QGIS Web Client, is it possible to establish search capabilities using multiple databases (i.e., tables within multiple databases)?
I have QGIS projects which utilize different PostGIS databases and would like to be able to list all the various databases in my qwc_connect.py Python file but realize that the DB_CONN_STRING only allows for the connection to a single database.
Has anyone employed or developed a workaround for this?
Regards,-Tony

Write unit tests for critical stuff like this? Don't accept a
replacement for ftools which isn't accompanied by extensive unit
testing? ;)

I'm honestly not sure there is any other solution to avoid this in
future. The bugs were present for a number of releases, so had already
been exposed to extensive USER testing. User testing alone obviously
wasn't enough in this case.

A good regression test suite could have flagged these regressions when
the breaking commits landed. The motivation would then have been on
the developer who broke the tests to fix the regressions or suffer the
wrath of Travis ;)

(BTW, just so we're clear... ftools is old and predated QGIS' current
CI testing infrastructure. I'm not blaming anyone for not having unit
tests for ftools or for breaking the crufty old code in that plugin. I
just think that moving forward any replacement for ftools MUST have a
extensive unit test suite, that's all).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS georeferencer / vector georeferencer
Message-ID: <5656B7A1.2090903@carto.net>

Hi,

Is there a reason why the QGIS georeferencer is still a plugin and not 
part of QGIS core?

Do you think that the existing QGIS raster georeferencer could be 
enhanced/extended to also allow the georeferencing of one or more vector 
layers?

I know that there is a Python plugin to do vector georeferencing - but I 
really think that both raster and vector georeferencing is an integral 
part of any GIS and shouldn't be optional or a second class citizen. And 
it is also rather suboptimal that the raster and vector georeferencers 
have two different interfaces ...

Thanks for your thoughts,
Andreas

Message-ID: <5656C7DC.70700@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I just disabled grass 7 Tests because of Travis failures [1]. This was
not introdced by malicious code but by disappearing packages from a ppa.
I think it was in grass-stable which is now empty and says that grass
gis packages are maintained in ubuntugis-unstable [2]. It looks to me as
if the packages from ubuntugis can no longer be installed side-by-side
(6 and 7).
If anybody has more information regarding this please let us know

All the best

Hi all,

thanks for your hints, I understand r.mapcalculator is not present in grass7, at least for now, so it cannot appear on processing toolbox.
Only solution to install in some way grass64.
However r.mapcalc is present in grass7 as well as r.null, I thought if would have added r.null.text and r.mapcalc in 
/usr/share/qgis/plugin/processing/algs/grass7/description

those modules should have been present in the processing toolbox, isn't it?

Can somebody listed the operations to add a grass module to a processing toolbox?
I'm thinking I'm missing a stage....

Regards

E.

no, they can't be added right now:

from http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6894

"r.mapcalc takes the name of raster layers to use...which is a
problem, since those names are temporary names, because layers have to
be imported into the mapset. This could be changed, but will
definitely take time."

anyway we were just pointed that there is a feature request in grass 7
to add a new flag that would solve the problem and allow to use
r.mapcalc in processing without needing any changes (in processing).

r.null can't be added because processing works in a way that a new
output is always created from a input, so grass modules that *modify*
inputs instead of creating new outputs are not supported at the
moment, see

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6893

cheers

Thank you Giovanni,
my only solution is to install grass64, which is not simple on ubuntu 15.04 because the different libraries version and dependencies.

We hope r.mapcalc will be added in the toolbox, soon.
r.null is a minor problem since I can finde a different way to change the null values to a certain integer.

Thanks again

Or use foreign data wrappers (fdw) - which is I believe - the more 
modern version of dblink.

You can register a table from another database and it will act as it 
would be local.

a) the interface of the raster version is more complete and allow
perfectly the user actions on the vector version also;

b) we have two solutions available for the math engine: an in-house
(raw & rough) solution and one that reuse the grass module v.rectify,
but I think that the raster version has a suitable engine, probably
more advanced than ours;

c) our plugin performs only linear transformation, should be improved
to align with the raster version, but we have reached the limits of our
mathematical background;

of course we are available for any necessary contribution (within the
limits of our capabilities :-)

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FhXb=6q=OuAe9ZBrJtfMXZAfG7KNymG3kvCRMcvTZXouw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to run Processing scripts in a stand-alone Python script. The
examples available online for calling default, e.g. QGIS algorithms, work
fine but when I try to access a script instead, it cannot be found, i.e.
getAlgorithm() returns None.

Am I missing something or is this a bug?

# Prepare the environment
import sys
from qgis.core import QgsApplication
from PyQt4.QtGui import QApplication
app = QApplication([])
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()

# Prepare processing framework
sys.path.append('/home/agraser/.qgis2/python/plugins')
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
Processing.initialize()

print Processing.getAlgorithm("qgis:creategrid") # works
print Processing.getAlgorithm("script:helloworld") # doesn't work

# Exit applications
QgsApplication.exitQgis()
QApplication.exit()


Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

As someone who has written custom georeferencers for both raster and vector
data in a QGIS plugin [1], I would greatly appreciate if the core
georeferencing functions are moved into core or processing to save me
duplicating it, with the gui being left as a plugin. At the moment I have
to execute GDAL on the command line working directly on the raster files,
and have copied/modified the vector bending code to achieve what I need.
Separating the two would also allow people to experiment with different gui
ideas without duplicating the core code, because to be honest the current
gui options are not as easy to use as they could be.

John.

[1] If you're wondering, the plugin is for digitizing archaeological plans
drawn on grid paper to a fixed 5m by 5m local grid, we semi-automatically
georeference the rasters for a grid-square to the known grid points (only 5
clicks required versus the 42 clicks needed in the standard georeferencer).
The vector bender code is used to initially create the local grid and then
to covert survey data between the local and national co-ords. I hope to
release a preview some time soon.

Thanks, Bernard and Andreas.

Yes, I did exactly as your kind recommendations shortly after sending out my initial email inquiry and realized such workaround would work equally as well. 

In essence, I created a new PostgreSQL database called "search_wsgi", extended the DB for PostGIS and DBLink, and then created new "search" tables in this new DB based on other PostGIS databases and simply established a DB_CONN_STRING "connection" to the new "search_wsgi" database. Once I "reloaded" or "restarted" the Apache server, I am now able to search for geometries on my Qgis web client based on the various search tables I generated in the "search_wsgi" DB. 

Note, I have always used DBLink and never FDW so I will have to try FDW's in the future when requiring data outside my connected PostgreSQL DB. 

Cheers,
-Tony

does Processing.getAlgorithm("script:helloworld") work in a normal
QGIS Python console?

Just in case, the name of the script is the name of the file (without
the extension)

Maybe you can try Processing.alghelp("script") to get the name of
available algorithms from the script provider

Hope this helps

​Is alghelp() really correct? Even in the Python console, I only get errors

processing.alghelp("scripts")
Algorithm not found
Processing.alghelp("script")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: class Processing has no attribute 'alghelp'​

​Best wishes,
Anita​

​FYI

scripts = Processing.getProviderFromName('scripts')
print scripts.algs​

returns an empty list if run in the stand-alone script

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS georeferencer / vector georeferencer
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBhadyws0eXkFQTMKQzUpCDCDZ4+4DzUWbU9ZeKu3s-K1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Making changes to the present georeferencer would be a great improvement.

I have used this georeferencer for many years, but it has a major drawback
- when loading a *.points file > 200-300 points
-- it becomes very slow

A *.points file of 1000 points can take up to an hour to load
- to add/move/delete a point 20-60 seconds
-- often after 2-3 attempts

---

When Spatialite offered the GrassGis based GCP_* functions
- I attempted to adapt the georeferencer code to use a Spatialite Database
instead of the *.points file
-- importing an existing *.points file when found

In QgsGeorefPluginGui::loadGCPs, if a Database was found this would be
loaded as a QgsVectorLayer for both QgsMapCanvasLayers
- otherwise use the *.points file

Loading and moving with > 1000 points poses no problems at all.

Using the GrassGis based GCP_* functions has the advantage that:
- after defining about 10-20 points (both pixel and position)
-- the GCP_Compute function can be called to calculate an average
(Polynomial coefficients)

At the moment I then manual attach a Database and load a set (300-500) well
known points
- and the pixel values are calculated and stored

Reloading this in QGIS-georeferencer, the estimated points can then be
corrected
- using QgsVectorLayer which deals with the updating of the changed values

--
What is missing is adding, deleting of points
- when a position is added, GCP_Compute could be called to create the pixel
point on the Raster
-- after witch that point only needs to be corrected

Not being firm on the gui portions
- all needed interactions, that is not delt with by QgsMapCanvasLayers, are
needed

A existing QgsGeorefPluginGui::createGCPDb function
- creates the Spatialite-Database with everything that is needed
-- including views to create a .point file or a GDAL GCP list
- checks if Spatialite has been compiled with GCP support [HasGCP()]
-- due to the different licence of GrassGis where the GCP_* logic comes from

All of this speeds up the development of a new Map greatly
- since most of the needed (well known) point are added automaticly

The created final gdal GCP list is then placed into a script configuration
file
- that then calls gdal to create the final image

---

I would be glad to offer this existing QGIS code to any one interested in
implementing this
- I am not that firm on the QT-gui logic

My problem is that I use a QGIS version base on the commit of 2014_02_22
- the last version that, when refreshing, does not blank the screen before
repainting
-- which is too hard on my eyes to work with
--- 2.8.x Wien also has this effect

Also I have not been able to compile that last master version for some while
- due to new dependencies that have been added

Otherwise I would be willing to cooperate with anybody that could get this
working as a part of QGIS.

As far as I know, nobody is working on that now. But it is certainly a
topic open for contributions.

Very excited to find the answer to this. It's exactly where I had to stop when trying to write some tests for processing. :)

Correct. The UbuntuGIS packages use the Debian GIS packaging, which is
not co-installable.

The upstream grass packages for Ubuntu will now be maintained by the
GRASS developers in UbuntuGIS instead of their own PPA.

The Ubuntu packages may regain the ability to co-install, I'm not sure
what Martin's plans are about that. That's still something we need to
discuss.

It was briefly discussed on grass-dev, see:

Hi all,

Just a thought I had - could the new hook which creates a documentation
issue when the message contains "feature" be amended so that it detects an
additional "needs docs" tag too?

My thoughts are that sometimes a change should be accompanied by
documentation updates but isn't a new feature - eg, a GUI control being
renamed or moved. It would be nice to be able to automatically flag these
as something which needs addressing in the docs.

processing.alglist('script') to retrieve the list of commands with
"script" string inside it's name or description

e.g.
processing.alglist('ogr')

returns a lot of elements... if we get one of them

OGR default------------------------------------------>quickosm:ogrdefault

I've the command name "quickosm:ogrdefault" then

processing.alghelp("quickosm:ogrdefault")

if the list is is empty => no commands/scripts found with "script"

cheers

​Thanks Luigi, but I'm not sure how this helps​.

​scripts = Processing.getProviderFromName('scripts')
print scripts.algs​

returns a NON-empty list when run in the Python console but an empty list
when run in a stand-alone script.

Some part of the initialization of the scripts provider seems to fail.

Best wishes,
Anita​

Hi,
BTW, it's not against Documentation repo but could this also be used to
fetch bug fixes so that a list of bug fixes can be generated to accompany
qgis releases?

Nyall, that would be useful. And GUI changes as well. In Docs we have tags
for identify the need to create new screenshots for users manual.

I think this must be related to the configuration of the plugins folder.

The script provider reads scripts in the scripts folder, which is
configured as an option. Maybe that setting is not available in your
stand-alone script...since it is stored using QSettings. You can check
it calling ScriptUtils.scriptsFolder()

I have added an option to add a folder manually to the scripts
provider. So you can get the instance of the provider (as you do when
listing its content), and call the addAlgorithmsFromFolder method to
add your folder.

See the commit in here,

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/0a21d91be5ad788db3b58a568a2beed0d797e045

Let me know if you have questions

Cheers!

Currently the hook seems broken, I'll try to fix it this afternoon/evening.

Happy to do add the 'needs docs' tag too. Is this already a tag? Just
sent me the exact tag text, and the type of issue that you want me to
make for it in Documentation issue-list.

Matthias had also a feature request:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Sysadmin/issues/3

Tim had another one.. which I forgot :-(
Or is it: https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues/146

Have to see if I should put it in one script, or split it up. The one we
use now is:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Sysadmin/tree/master/webhooks

Hello,

Some request, question:

1) A new request (or not): what if the code is reverted? Is it possible to add 
a comment in the document ticket?

2) About the new tag "Need docs": do we really want a new tag instead of just 
changing the tag to [Documentation] which could just mean "We need to document 
this for our user". 

Do we need to know the difference in the documentation ticket?

3) (no question here) **Thanks** to all for creating this hook! This is really 
nice now I can  try to work on some ticket each week.

Y.

Hi,

I think you can try calling ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue() to set the
script dir before initializing. Here is how I did it with R scripts in
R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER:

from processing.core.ProcessingConfig import ProcessingConfig
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue('ACTIVATE_R', True)
ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue('R_FOLDER', os.environ['RPATH'])
ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue('R_LIBS_USER', os.environ['RLIBS'])
ProcessingConfig.setSettingValue('R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER', os.environ['RSCRIPTS'])
Processing.initialize()
from processing.tools import *

outputs = general.runalg('r:myscript')

Cheers,

SN

Hi all,

I updated my PR.
I made some quick tests, and it seems this PR can improve speed for PostGIS
layers ( with PostGIS 2.2 )
More details in the last comment [1]

Please help to test it with a variety of data types and complexity.

​from processing.script.ScriptUtils import *
print ScriptUtils.scriptsFolder()

if run in stand-alone, returns a wrong folder:
​/home/agraser/temp/standaloneprocessing/processing/scripts
(/home/agraser/temp/standaloneprocessing is the location of my stand-alone
script)

​instead of the correct folder in the QGIS console:
u'/home/agraser/.qgis2/processing/scripts'.

Seems like we are getting closer to where the real issue is hiding. Imho it
makes little sense that the paths appear relative to the stand-alone
script's location.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New set of Icons for QGIS Files
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G3ro05Tbs8VRnVEYy-nh5UsXp7LsKB9H0HdF3R8cdLJg@mail.gmail.com>

I have been working on a set of Icons for QGIS File formats. Until now,
this is what I got:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/18je40eidwz75yr/Icons_p_QGIS.png?dl=0

Opinions?

If there's no one against it, I would like to make a pull request to add
them to QGIS code, but I don't know what else is needed to do so that QGIS
installer associates those icons to the corresponding files for each
Operating System.

Also, I would like to create smaller versions of the Icons to improve their
readability when shown in small size. But I'm not sure how to do it.
For windows I can make an ICO file with all resolutions inside. But for
Linux, I believe the several sizes must be in different folders in
the /usr/share/icons/hicolor folder. No Idea how Mac works.

Can someone help?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hello Everyone. 
I'm a newbie in open source programming, so i hope i'm in the right section. 
I'm trying to create a pop-up window in Qgis using Qt Designer Software. 
This windows should be activable by a new botton in the Qgis toolbar, and
should contain a drop-down menu. 
I have the following issue: Qt Designer has a .ui file as output file, and I
don't know how I can integrate it in Qgis. 
Could somebody help me? Thanks in advantage.

I think this should help:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html

and also take a look at the "Plugin builder" Qgis plugin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing QGIS point releases 2.8.4 and 2.12.1
Message-ID: <20151129234134.GA3131@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the point releases of QGIS 2.8.4 'Wien' and
QGIS 2.12.1 'Lyon'.  Wien is German for 'Vienna' - host city to our developer
meet up in November 2009 and again in March 2014.  Lyon was the host city to
our developer meet up in April 2012.

These are the first point releases that - like our other releases - follow a
fixed schedule (see
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#release-schedule
).

As point releases both don't contain new features:

QGIS 2.8.4 contains 81 changes to fix bugs (see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_8_3...final-2_8_4 for a full
list).

QGIS 2.12.1 contains 66 changes to fix bugs (see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_12_0...final-2_12_1 for a full
list).

Even when only fixes are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org/).  Please consult the
existing and closed issues there before filing any new ones.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page (http://qgis.org/).
More packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


Thanks

Finally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable
financial support they provide to this project:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS pyqt Dockwidget plugin with pushButton
Message-ID: <DB3PR08MB025284D4752D048865ABB63EA7000@DB3PR08MB0252.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

i'm trying to setup a dock widget python plugin,

using the plugin builder i managed to setup the plugin
and now i need to execute a query:


def execute_query:
      connection_parameres = connpar
      defineQuery = "SELECT attribute FROM mytable"
      cursor.execute(defineQuery)
      ...etc

now i need to execute the method when a pushButton is clicked
this below works with a "regular" Dialog plugin but not with a 
dockwidget plugin:

(queryPush is a QT pushButton)

self.dlg.queryPush.clicked.connect(self.execute_query)

some help or link to code example ?

thanks, Roy.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Embed layers and groups: possible bug
Message-ID: <565C43DB.9040205@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
if I include layers and groups from two different projects, and the
layers and groups have the same name, the second project is ignored, and
the first layers are loaded twice instead.
To me this seems clearly a bug (we have the same issue about duplicate
names also elsewhere). I remember someone (Marco?) planned working on
this. Any news?
All the best.

Hi all,
names of items in Print layout (e.g. Map0, Map1, etc.) can be changed,
but menus use the original names, not the user aliases. I think this is
confusing, and makes aliases of little use.
Is this the result of a work in progress? It is useful if I open a ticket?
Thanks.

Hi Paolo, 

No - layer names have to be unique! WMS clients also need unique layer
names. After all, they need to provide a list with visible layers in the
correct order. How would the client address the layers individually, if
the names are the same? 

I believe you can switch to layer id's instead of layer names - but than
you have the same issue that they need to be unique. 

The issue you are referring to is probably the one that in the past
layer ids in the global layer cache had to be unique. Now they have to
be unique within the project, but not globally. This was fixed several
months ago.

It aims [0] at displaying or hide map annotation, so perhaps a rewording

IS this really happening with same names?
Or did you duplicate the project (hence layers have the same layer IDs)?

Paolo - sorry. I mixed things up. I thought about QGIS server context -
but you talk about QGIS desktop. 

Sorry. 

But I would avoid the same layer names anyway. They may lead to troubles
with QGIS server and some plugins that use layer names instead of layer
ids.

Hi, 

The commit
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/422abbde5e5b76924d3b78eba42d61a4f4c18563
with the pull request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2056 introduces
some serious regressions - both from a stability point of view, but also
performance wise. 

I get random crashes and several of my projects are 2-3 times slower
than before this commit. I first wasn't sure what caused the troubles,
but with the help of Nyall, we could identify the culprit commit. 

Thank you for having a look at it/reviewing it again.

Hi Andreas,
sorry I was unclear. I see many cases where layer names could be
legitimately duplicated (e.g. same names in different groups). *If* this
should really not be allowed, the user should be warned, which is not
the case currently.
Denis: yes, two different projects, containing different layers with the
same names.
Thanks for helping me clarifying, I'm going to open a ticket.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
I wasn't aware of the possibility to rename the item. Thanks for pointing
this out.
Another thing with this option is that duplicating a renamed item keep the
same name for both in Items tab (while, e.g, in map legend duplicating a
layer adds *_copy* to its name). Would be worth keeping consistencies.

​+1 for renaming "Draw map canvas items" in Print composer.

The docs say "Draw map canvas items lets you show annotations that may be
placed on the map canvas in the main QGIS window."

So maybe it should just be "Show annotations"?

An easy fix, unless the same option shows also other types of objects
(in which case the manual should be improved).

​If I move the stand-alone script into ​
​
/home/agraser/.qgis2/, I can execute it and it finds my custom Processing
script.

In any other location the script fails because Processing uses the wrong
scripts folder.

I'd rather not hard-code the scripts folder. Do you have an idea how to
make Processing use its "default" scripts folder rather than something in
the stand-alone script's location?

Thanks and best wishes,

Message-ID: <565C6169.5000902@opengis.ch>

Hi,

The PyQgsDelimitedTextProvider is flaky for as long as I remember.
It runs into a timeout every once in a while (e.g. here
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/93937729#L1285
http://tinyurl.com/pcepj9t)
I guess it runs into a deadlock given that normally it finishes in ~12s
and a timeout requires 600s to trigger.
Does anybody have a guess what could be the source of the problem?

Does somebody have a suspicion what could be going on? If yes, please
try to find a way to add debug output to verify your guesses.
I will probably disable the test the next time I witness false alarms, I
hope somebody jumps in before :)

Matthias

The issue is that the "default" folder is based on the location of the
parent app (if I am not wrong). I can probably move it to somewhere in
.qgis2  instead. But if there is a manually entered path, then it will
not use the default one, that's only used if no custom configuration
has been done.

Let me check and will see how to fix this.

Hi All

Thanks for alert to this message Matthias.. you recall correctly that I am author of these tests.

There is one test which I might have expected to be flaky, which is the test for the file watcher (test 29) - and in retrospect I'm not sure of the value of that feature in any case.  In order to make that test work it needs to sleep for a bit and to call  QCoreApplication.instance().processEvents().  However from the log file it appears to have successfully passed that test.

After that the tests are all very routine I would have thought - the last test for which there is output, which is test31, is filtering using a spatial index.  On the face of it this sounds very straightforward code to me, and not likely to result in a timeout.  OTOH this code was built before multithreaded rendering so there is a possibility of some sort of thread insecurity I suppose ... if multithreading in used in the test at all.

In summary I don't have any immediate thoughts as to why it could be ... thoughts anyone?

Cheers
Chris

Hi,

The PyQgsDelimitedTextProvider is flaky for as long as I remember.
It runs into a timeout every once in a while (e.g. here https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/93937729#L1285 http://tinyurl.com/pcepj9t)
I guess it runs into a deadlock given that normally it finishes in ~12s and a timeout requires 600s to trigger.
Does anybody have a guess what could be the source of the problem?

Does somebody have a suspicion what could be going on? If yes, please try to find a way to add debug output to verify your guesses.
I will probably disable the test the next time I witness false alarms, I hope somebody jumps in before :)

Matthias

No, but I have also observed this issue.

I think the first thing would be to print "CTEST_FULL_OUTPUT"
before anything else in the test so that the log isn't truncated. (Eg see
how the documentation test also does this).

That would at least help identify the hanging test.

Hi everyone,

Today I've got this error on clean compiling qgis master

My system: Debian sid


.......

  * your version of PyQt (4.11.4)
  * the UI file that caused this error
  * the debug output of pyuic4 (use the -d flag when calling pyuic4)

and compiled fine.

ok, built so libs seems to be empty:

nm /usr/local/share/qgis/python/qgis/_core.so | grep Qgs -c

Hi Martin

Can you `touch python/core/core.sip` or start with a clean build dir?

Sometimes an error happens when building the python bindings and when
compiling again the build system spuriously assumes that python bindings
have been built correctly and skips rebuilding them despite them not
actually being built.

Message-ID: <CAB28Asgj0yqydpxgKMeY9us+wONo73MypDXwVaeUufNx53qJTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A new Github issue tracker has been created (thanks Paolo!) to track
discussion relating to potential API changes in QGIS 3.0:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues

I'd encourage you to post your thoughts there so that we can start to
get a feel for the amount of work desired for the API break. This can
then be used to help gauge the timing required for the 3.0 release.

Note that this is for API related discussion only, not general feature
requests for QGIS 3.0!

Hello Andreas,


I would recommend you to file a ticket, attaching a minimal project to
reproduce the issue and a stack trace of the crash.

If you have any additional clues (like you said, from Nyall) please attach
them too.

Please assign the ticket to Stephan Brunner (in CC).
