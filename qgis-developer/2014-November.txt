Hm, which version of QScintilla2 are you using?   Something earlier than v2.5
from 29th March 2011?  Because that's where replaceSelectedText() was added to
QsciScintilla.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.6 'Brighton'
Message-ID: <20141101173800.GA31879@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.6 'Brighton'.

The new release contains a lot of new features, tweaks and enhancements. More
over this time there are more complete translations than ever before.

This is third release following our four month release schedule that is meant
to make new features and bugfixes available quicker and the development and new
releases more predictable.   Again the testing phase was fruitful and was
therefore extended by a week.  Thanks to all the tester for their time and good
reports.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.

Message-ID: <DUB122-W755AEFB142807BC67DE1AA7980@phx.gbl>





Hi all,
just few things I'm
experiencing with 2.6:





Attribute Table: modifying the content of a cell, it needs to save and reopen the table to
	see it updated...normal behaviour?
	
Crash:
	different types. Usually closing the project, QGIS ends up with a
	minidump or the MS error window "The software stopped to work
	etc etc". This happens closing .qgs from 2.2 with or without
	saving to 2.6 version. Sometimes also while working. Attached you
	can find the .dmp (shall I upload them? I don't know how to deal
	with). Actually it's a quite annoying issue...

	
Corrupt layers: the table appears but double-clicking the source it
	doesn't open the explorer as in 2.2; it only allows to modify the folder
	destination as text. Is that the new behavior?
Translation (ITA):
	just few oversights:
	
color selection
		panel: "incolla collore"
		
modify widget
		properties: "il widget di modica pu?..."
	
	




Is there anyone with the
same issues? I'm working with W8.1 64bit and QGIS standalone. 





As always: thank you all for
your work!




All the best,




Nic

Hi!

Regarding translation it is now easier than ever before to contribute
and change the things yourself.
Just get an account on transifex [0] and apply for the italian
language - search for the typos and change them by yourself. That way
you make sure the correct string will find it's way into the next
release.

kind regards
Werner

Hi,
About corrupted layers, yes this is the new behaviour. You can now directly write the good path. But there is also a browser button at the bottom of the dialog. Select the layer in the list and click on this button will open the explorer, as old double-click behaved.

Niccola,

With regards to point 1 & 2, you would increase the chance of those issues
being fixed (and help QGIS) by filing tickets at hub.qgis.org . Be as
descriptive as you can, provide steps to reproduce what affects you; that
should be enough to get a developer to look into it. Sample data source &
project file leading to issue a bonus.

Nic,
I upgraded to 2.6.0 x64 using the stand-alone installer for Windows (I have two machines: OS 8 and 7 SP1). I am not experiencing the attribute table editing issue that you describe. I experienced a couple of crash dump error windows on exit, but these were mostly while saving older QGIS documents to the new format that also had pathing problems to some layers. Once saved as a 2.6 doc, I have not had any crash dump errors on exit. Also, with respect to the Browse option for unhandled layers, it was greyed out for me when the referenced MSSQL spatial DB had already been deleted. Obviously, these layers were inconsequential, but it would have been easy to manually enter the new instance path had I needed to.
 
Love the new features and improvements with 2.6...
 
All the best,
James

Hi again,

Thanks again for you work Werner.

Last translation commit is quite large again, due to the Spanish file, 
although from a quick look it just seems to be new translations...

Anyway, I'd like to raise again the idea of using git submodule for 
translation files.

As written before, I think they are quite useless in the main repo. Even 
if we can limit drastically the growth of the files, I think they would 
be better suited in a distinct repo and have a small advantage regarding 
growth of the main repo.

I found a project [0] which is using github / transifex with git 
submodule for translation files [1].

I believe no changes to current translation scripts would be required 
thanks to git submodules.
It would just be a question of initialising the submodule and changing 
the url wherever needed.

Does this need a QEP ? ;)

Best wishes,

Denis

Would this also help us fine tune commit permissions on both repos? I'd
imagine that there's a lot of non developers who could potentially benefit
from commit rights for translations?

> As written before, I think they are quite useless in the main repo. Even
if we can limit drastically the growth of the files, I think they would be
better suited in a distinct repo and have a small advantage regarding
growth of the main repo.

Hi Denis!

Yeah - unfortunately I missed spanish from transifex (sorry to carlos for that).
But that should now be a "normal commit" for a language update.

As I said already.. I tend to only update english source from master
to transifex and only frequently port translations back like once in a
month and before releases every 3 days or so for 2 weeks.
We should give translators the chance to see in testing how the
translation looks like.

Using a git submodule would also be good to me .. that would probably
make the above more easier ..

Personally I never used submodules and I don't want to break anything
.. So if anyone with experience can do it .. step ahead ..
If noone will do it I will try to implement it myself (hopefully
without breaking anything).

I don't know if this a QEP case as it is nothing technical with GIS
itself but rather administrative ..

Ask the PSC?

kind regards
Werner

Hi Nyall!

Commit rights for translations are solved by using transifex (which is
a better, webbased, intuitive was for doing translations anyway)
If you insist on using linguist you can even download and upload the
*.ts files directly in transifex. No need to deal with git.

kind regards
Werner

I have seen the crash on exit on several machines, it is usually a
plugon problem, try disable/remove your plugins, at some point you
will probably find the one is causing the crash.

I cannot find the first issue you pointed out (maybe it has already been 
fixed for the master release) but I fixed the second one.

Hi all,
great visual changelog for the new release, well done!
I just have a suggestion, are there any online model collections links 
that we can add to the section

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog260/index.html#feature-on-line-collection-of-models-and-scripts

?

Cheers

Well, the point here is that we could have daily pull (or so) of the 
translations and do not care that much.
Also, if line numbers are helpful for translating we could think if 
putting them back.

It shouldn't be very hard.

1. Create a new repo on github, let's say QGIS-i18n

2. In i18n folder, do
     2.1. git init
     2.2. git remote add origin git at github.com:QGIS/QGIS-i18n.git
     2.3. git add *
     2.4. git commit -m "first"
     2.5. git push -u origin master

3. On top directory, remove i18n folder: git rm -rf i18n

4. Add the submodule: git submodule add 
git at github.com:QGIS/qgis-i18n.git i18n

After this, you should have exactly the same folder structure, except 
that i18n is now an external repo.
pulling/pushing in this folder will be performed on the submodule repo 
and won't affect the main repo.

For the transifex config, I am not an expert, but as far as I understand 
it, pushing/pull translation is done from the project, so I wonder if 
even a change is requested.

I noticed that too.
In previous API docs you could explore the code where a method, constant,
etc is defined.

Look at QgsLabel.renderLabel():

API master:
http://qgis.org/api/classQgsLabel.html#a023a9722f96e7afd0a90788e0860a62d
API 2.2:

To complete the picture, the main repo references a specific commit
of the submodule, so in order to "update" translations such reference
would need to be updated in the main repo.

The the reason above it may be advisible to have transifex pull from
the submodule, or it would see no changes until the submodule reference
is updated (assuming transifex puller would be able to follow submodules).

Thanks Jurger.
Did you do it to keep the API docs cleaner?
Anyway I was just explaining what I suppose Luigi meant.

ok giovanni, once I understand which plugin is causing the crash, what shall I do? report it?
btw: crashes appeared also while working, even on already-saved-2.6-version projects.

thank you all for the support!


PS
suggestions for the next step? trying to install from osgeo or better to go back to 2.2? further installation of 2.6 didn't help with crashes.

Matthieu
actually, the project file got broken after a minidump...I don't know if it still turns useful.
sample data: which kind? the project is quite "thick"...

btw, in the meanwhile I'll try to open a ticket on it.

thank you very much!

Niccola,
With regards to point 1 & 2, you would increase the chance of those issues being fixed (and help QGIS) by filing tickets at hub.qgis.org . Be as descriptive as you can, provide steps to reproduce what affects you; that should be enough to get a developer to look into it. Sample data source & project file leading to issue a bonus.

Hi all,
just few things I'm
experiencing with 2.6:





Attribute Table: modifying the content of a cell, it needs to save and reopen the table to

Crash:
	different types. Usually closing the project, QGIS ends up with a
	minidump or the MS error window "The software stopped to work
	etc etc". This happens closing .qgs from 2.2 with or without
	saving to 2.6 version. Sometimes also while working. Attached you
	can find the .dmp (shall I upload them? I don't know how to deal

Corrupt layers: the table appears but double-clicking the source it
	doesn't open the explorer as in 2.2; it only allows to modify the folder
	destination as text. Is that the new behavior?
Translation (ITA):
	just few oversights:
	
color selection
		panel: "incolla collore"
		
modify widget
		properties: "il widget di modica pu?..."
	
	




Is there anyone with the
same issues? I'm working with W8.1 64bit and QGIS standalone. 





As always: thank you all for
your work!




All the best,




Nic

Hi,About corrupted layers, yes this is the new behaviour. You can now directly write the good path. But there is also a browser button at the bottom of the dialog. Select the layer in the list and click on this button will open the explorer, as old double-click behaved.

Hi!

Regarding translation it is now easier than ever before to contribute
and change the things yourself.
Just get an account on transifex [0] and apply for the italian
language - search for the typos and change them by yourself. That way
you make sure the correct string will find it's way into the next
release.

kind regards
Werner

added a comment to the commit:

I prefer old style documentation that help me to enter directly in the
code to understand how it works.

ok, I can create my own documentation, but I generally I find it more
useful having it online

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raise minimum CMake version to 2.8.6
Message-ID: <54575D94.9060607@gmx.ch>

Hi,

As we are out of feature freeze I was thinking of merging the
possibilities to compile against Qt5. One of the difficulties was to
have the possibility to compile the test suite. It is possible to have
the test suite compile against both versions - Qt4 and Qt5 - by using
automoc. Automoc is only available starting from CMake 2.8.6. Is there
any objection against raising the minimum version of CMake?

To avoid possible confusion: This will not break any compatibility with
Qt4 and Qt4 will remain the main target for the moment. Qt5 support will
have to be manually enabled with a CMake option.

Matthias

Not from me.  Even Ubuntu precise is at 2.8.7.

Debian stable (7.4 aka "wheezy") ships 2.8.9, so no objection from me :)

The rationale was that users of the documentation should not need to
read the code of individual functions. If they do, then the
documentation is simply not good enough. Many other projects we use
(like Qt, GDAL, GEOS) do not include that either. Those links simply
make the documentation more bloated. Another reason is that if someone
needs to browse the code, any IDE with c++ support is 10x more
efficient for that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to avoid message: "CRS was undefined" ?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_rje7PFRVfEYUfSNuRT9ej_MfdPE+etT-JdT=CBZEBi+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've a third party plugin with a gdal virtual layer that is shown in QGIS.
The virtual layer is build with gdalbuildvrt and all images belong to
the same CRS

I know the CRS of the current project and the CRS of the images
composing the virtual layer... that are wms tiles, saved as png and
loosing CRS information.

when importing the layer appear the message:

CRS was undefined: defaulting to project.. and so on

this because during instanciacion of QgsRasterLayer(vrtpath,
"myraster), somewere is emitted the customCrsValidate(..) event that
try to check custom CRS.

I need to set CRS to avoid this messages. I've two way:
1) set gdalbuildvrt the parameter -a_srs to force srs, but it is
available only with gdal >= 1.10, and I'm loking for a generic vay to
solve
2) instanciate rl=QgsRasterLayer() and then set crs... but I can't
find a way to set path. neither setting QgsDataSourceURI

there's a solution that I'm missing?

Hi,

There's difference between 2.2 and 2.6 release when scanning an Oracle database:
With 2.2 table's SRID are well identified, not with 2.6 and DB is the same.

What should be the reason of these different behaviour? (and the solution ;-)?

Thanks

Hi all.
Currently the user is presented with the full list of projections, even when

millions), e.g. for guessing unknown. It would be much easier if only those
compatible with the current canvas extent would be available. Apparently the info is

Hi martin

I almost agree, but qgis is not only a lib but kind of framework. It's
use is different tespect the use i van do with qt or gdal.

Not always I've the code available to investigate... but I generally
have connection.

In my point of view, api doc wasn't clutter

Message-ID: <CAALdH9UBXznA=BO710tk4CEd_+4FE5cLZb43m9r_TC+FOiYB0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have a persistent issue with a Python plugin of mine, qgSurf.
There is no (observed) problem when using this plugin in Linux (Mint) 64
bit with QGIS 2.4 or 2.6, or for QGIS 2.4 in Win 32 bit (I don't know for
QGIS 2.6 Win32).
However, when using it in a Win64 versions, be it 2.4 or 2.6 from
standalone installers, at the QGIS closing a minidump is always created.
I've tracked the single offending command: it's the use of the GDAL
function ReadAsArray, for reading the content of a raster band.

I don't know if this is a known issue of GDAL in QGIS Win64, and if it
could be solved in one of the next releases of QGIS 64 bit for Windows.

Thanks,
Mauro

after *3 days of hard work* i can see the queries, qgis is sending to the
database server.

Nobody told me to 

- compile qqis in debug mode
- add 2 environment variables 

and inspect the resulting log file 

Remember: I'm not a qgis developer, just a simple user having big problems.

I try to describe the real problem:

I'm doing a spatial query to fetch all country borders out of the
openstreetmap table planet_osm_polygon on my local database server. This is
a really big table with about 152 millons geometries (polygons and
multipolygons mixed) and i only need about 220 of them.

Filter in Qgis: /boundary='administrative' and osm_id<0 and admin_level =
'2'/
/boundary/ , /osm_id/ and /admin_level/ are indexed.

that leads to  
which makes sense to me.

After that you can wait for hours. there is no additional output in the
logfile.


in pgadmin3 i can see fetch-requests, but i don't know if data is beeing
submitted from the database-server to qgis.

btw: a timestamp in the logfile would be fine. 2.8 ?

The same query without cursor using psql runs in about 40 seconds, which is
ok for me.


This happens in 2.4 and the new 2.6 in the same way.

I think it's really  a problem with long queries (longer then 20-30
seconds?). any timeout waiting for data?

regards
walter

Well, yes, the documentation is not good enough, but I don't think it is 
a good reason to remove a useful link. I found it quite useful, I used 
it mainly in my job where I did not have admin rights to install a C++ 
IDE or any external software. It was quite handy to have the code easily 
available when the documentation was incomplete or outdated.

Hi,

Some additional information, after some more digging into sqlite code /
documentation / mailing lists:

* The parsing part of SQLite is private and cannot be requested by an
external program. Moreover, the parse phase directly builds a program,
not an abstract syntax tree. However, a formal grammar is available
(http://www.sqlite.org/syntaxdiagrams.html) and the SQLite license is
very permissive. So, reusing parts of the SQLite parser seems not that
hard and would allow to parse a subset of SQL (only SELECT I guess)

* About indexes on virtual tables, contrary to what I wrote previously,
the xBestIndex() method of virtual tables should be enough to orient the
planner, an estimated cost and estimated number of rows can be returned
for each part of the where clause. So there should be no need to copy
native indexes.
But the provider interface should be extended in order to provide such
statistics.

Now for the more concrete part: we may have a funding for that
development, but a decision has to be taken before this funding vanishes.

So in order to advance on that topic, what we can propose is to develop
a fully functional prototype, as a transition before being added to the
core. It will implement a new data provider, with these user-oriented
features :
* an integration into the DBManager, in order to be able to use SQL on
any layer
* the ability to use a WHERE filter on layers that have a join.

For the code part, a SELECT parser will be proposed, based on SQLite if
possible and performance tests will be developed with different use
cases, allowing to test for the planner performances as well as for the
"data copying" part.

We are willing to develop this as a plugin if it can be included in QGIS
as a c++ plugin. Is there any objection to this ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS web client not displaying full WMS extent
Message-ID: <6f01665dfe104c6d99aa9d2b9b91370d@NINSRV23.nina.no>



Hi,

I am having some trouble with properly displaying a WMS in QGIS 2.5:

The web-client (http://kart.fiskeridir.no/default.aspx?gui=1&lang=1 (activate e.g. first layer in the "Fiskeriaktivitet"-tab) for the WMS I use displays a much wider data extent than the WMS in QGIS (http://kart.fiskeridir.no/wms.aspx? , here one may have to set tile size (something like 1000x1000) and choose png format in order to make it visible). In QGIS the WMS seems to be clipped in N,S,E, and W, while another proprietary GIS displays the WMS correctly (like the web-client)...

Any idea what the problem could be here?

Is it a user issue, a server issue or is it a web-client issue and probably related to (or a variant of):
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10634
?
I was using QGIS 2.5 master (d833c22) through OSGeo4W.


Thanks in advance for helping.

Cheers
Stefan

P.S.: I had this posting already on the user-mailinglist, but managed to send it into another existing thread (and got no response), so I hope you do not mind that I re-send it to the devs-list...

Depends what you mean. If you mean to add another method like Equal
Interval / Quantiles / Natural Breaks - then you would need to write
them in C++ and add them to the core library (this is not extensible).

But of course you can come up with your own classification algorithm
and create the graduated renderer easily in a Python script:

ranges=[QgsRendererRangeV2(1,100,
QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(QGis.Point), "1 - 100")]
r=QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2("cat", ranges)
iface.activeLayer().setRendererV2(r)

Hi Stefan,

I am a bit confused. As far as I can tell there is no web client 
involved - only some other WMS server and some other Web-GIS - right?

So - the actual problem is that QGIS desktop does not show the full 
extent of the other WMS server - so purely a "QGIS as a WMS client" 
issue - right?

I would double check the projection setting first, to see if WMS server 
and WMS client are on the same projection. That would be my first check.

Oops,

i tried it again and after about four hours the data arrived from the
db-server :(

so, that's no Qgis-problem but something very strange with the database. may
be it's doing a sequential search and not using the index? I'll write some
external tests without Qgis and keep you informed.

Yea, did it the last 2 hours. but remember: I costs me tree days of work to
*see* the query :(

here we go:

runs for about *3-4 hours*

about *40 Seconds*

The cursor-query does not use the indexes for admin_level and boundary.
that's nearly like a sequential search (on 159 mio. datarecords).

But i think, that is a postgresql-problem. Any hints what i can do?

walter

Thanks for the clarification Martin. I was hoping this would be extensible
using Python.

I'll probably give this approach a try then.

You'll need to show the query and the definition of the tables
involved in it (EXPLAIN <query> output also helps).

Hi all,

Can someone give me a pointer to the best way to implement an intersection
between a line and a rectangle using QgsGeometry? The line may curve out of
the rectangle and then back in multiple times, so ideally I want to get a
collection of each part of the line which is within the rectangle.

is there some trouble to use the intersection function of QgsGeometry()?
should not to be enough line.intersection(rectangle)? or probably I am
missing the question here? :)

Looking at the definition of QgsGeometry::intersection the docs state
"Returns a geometry representing the points shared by this geometry
and other.". I assume this method is designed for intersection of two
polygons, where someone is after the overlapping area.

may be i got it. after purging and recreating idx_planet_boundary and
idx_planet_admin_level the cursor-query is using those indices and
performance is on.

yes, i'm running vacuum analyze on a regular base and the last run was this
morning.

if the performance is going down again, i'll contact the postgres people.

Thanks

Hi Andreas,



Thanks for your reply, and sorry for the confusion. It is indeed a "QGIS as a WMS client" issue.

I now tested with different CRS which the WMS uses, namely EPSG:25833,32633,and 4326.

I added one layer for each CRS and then stepwise changed my project CRS.



With my QGIS project in WGS84 all data of the layer WGS84 layer is displayed properly (however in a form which is little suitable for map production), while EPSG:25833 layer only showed the lower left quarter of the map and 32633 had the "clipped" data extent mentioned.

Then I switched to EPSG:25833. Here for the WGS84 layer and the EPSG:25833 layer only the lower left quarter of the map is visible, and the EPSG:32633 layer had again the clipped extent. Zoom-to-layer on the EPSG:25833 resulted in a 1:35Mio scale while zoom-to-layer on the EPSG:32633 layer resulted in a 1:10Mio scale...

Switching the project to 32633 gave the same result as the project in 25833.



Here I also noticed that on-the-fly projection was activated when switchen forth and back between layers...



 So, it seems indeed somehow related to CRS, do you have a second or third thing you would check?

Does the server send different data for different CRS? Or is it something else?



Cheers

Stefan

You should be able to perform the intersection with different geometry types.
I done a script [0] that does an intersection between line and polygon
and returns a multiLine geometry.

You're right - thanks! I'll send through a fix making the docs a bit

Hi. I updated the latest stable versions of QGIS v2.6 and SAGA GIS
v2.1.3. However
I have seen that reported some bugs with the processing module and
ParameterBoolean. To correct the compactability with the latest of
SAGA GIS, needs
to be added or changed in [1]

if param.value:

for something like:

if param.value:
    command += ' -' + param.name + " true"

regards,

Samuel Mesa.

Hi all.
I just accepted a new plugin (CADDigitize), which look fine.
I got a bit lost here: on one side, power users often complains of lack of some
advanced digitizing tools in main QGIS, on the other hand we have a number of plugins
with apparently overlapping functionalities (e.g. [0]).
Could we discuss about ways of integrating useful functions in master, and reducing
duplication of work (thus, confusion to the users)?
Thanks.

There is already a pull request and QEP for this already. We can now talk
about it a bit more since 2.6 is out.

Hi,

I don't know exactly why, but the code you inserted in your messages are
not visible. They are only visible when using the web-based archives
like nabble ...

So apparently you have filters on geometries (with intersection test &&)
but no spatial index on these geometries.
Something like CREATE INDEX ON table USING GIST(way) could help

Samuel

Thanks for your help

Unfortunately, this is just one of the many thing that have to be changed
to adapt to 2.1.3, since there are quite a few changes. We are working on a
better support for different saga versions, that hopefully will be ready
for the next release

Thanks again!

Hi all.
We still have 42 PR on the queue:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls
some appears really obsolete; wouldn't be now the right moment to sort them out?
I'm worried that keeping a long queue will increase the chances of missing the
important ones.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Walter,

Note that if you want to troubleshoot PostGIS problems, you should look at the 
postgres side, not the QGIS one. It would have taken 10 minutes to get the 
problem here.

So :
* configure PostgreSQL server to output logs for every query
* rerun these queries with EXPLAIN in pgadmin / psql
* Use something like pgBadger to analyze your logs and find the bad queries

There are a lot of other PostgreSQL-related tools which can be useful for 
auditing, fine-tuning, troubleshooting PostgreSQL, but it is a bit off-scope for 
this list.

I know, I know, this is a delicate topic :) We need sponsors, volunteers,

Is there a roadmap for the update of the documentation? Since 2.2 a lot of
(great) features have populated QGIS, and they worth an update to the docs.
Who is coordinating the docs now?

Hi G,

coordination: Otto

Most documentation related stuff is discussed on the community list:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-community-team/2014-October/003888.html

I asked there if we want to build, and decided to wait for Diethard to
update the print composer part.

He is asking for help there, so :-)

If either Otto or Diethard gives me a green light, I start building 2.6.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Diethard will wave the green light I guess and help is very much appreciated.
Please write to the community list, if you want to help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Batch generation of map images with MTR
Message-ID: <CAH5HFGnsyg5VG+Wn=gspnxpq_+2HoiC1tMnT80c01WxeyQjF5w@mail.gmail.com>

I have code for a python plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/TomBio/)
that follows this pattern:

* display vector layer A in map canvas
* use the canvas saveAsImage method to save map image
* hide vector layer A from map canvas
* display vector layer B in map canvas
* use the canvas saveAsImage method to save map image
* hide vector layer B from map canvas

This works very well in QGIS 2.0.1 - it can rapidly generate hundreds of
map images. But I updated to 2.6 and it no longer works. All the map images
are created without the vector layers being visible. It seems like the
layers are only actually rendered at the end of the process. I tried using
the canvas refresh method in the loop, but it made no difference.

I also compared the behaviour of the MMQGIS plugin's animation tools, which
work in a similar way, and they have the same problem - i.e. they don't
work with QGIS 2.6.

I just joined the developer list and looking back over some previous posts
and doing some background reading here -
http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/products/qgis-mtr/ - it seems as though
the introduction of multi-threaded rendering (MTR) may be responsible.

Is there any way I can work with the new rendering system to get this
pattern working in recent versions of QGIS?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with sub-layer visibility in WMS raster
	layer
Message-ID: <CAH5HFGkrm=oK9gUk_sqA==vK+0Ew5sEOE9_kxVrkA8vS5dn_sA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to solve a problem involving a change to QGIS handling of the
setSubLayerVisibility method for a WMS layer.  I've noticed the difference
between versions 2.0 and 2.6, but I don't know when it was introduced
because I don't have the other versions installed.

The code below will create a WMS layer from the UK National Biodiversity
Network (NBN). (The code starting 'NHM...' specifies that this is a UK
species distribution map for the Robin.)

The WMS layer is created with four sub-layers. The code below turns off
visibility for three of the sub-layers, leaving only one visible. (In the
plugin I change the sub-layer visibility depending on the extent of the
map.)

If I run the sample code in QGIS 2.0, I see only the "Grid-2km" sub-layer.
But if I run it in QGIS 2.6, I see all four sub-layers - the
setSublayerVisibility method has no effect.

Can anyone confirm whether or not this is a bug, of if there has been a
change to handling sub-layer visibility that I should be aware of?

         url = ("url=https://gis.nbn.org.uk/SingleSpecies/NHMSYS0000530739&"
+
        "layers=Grid-100m&layers=Grid-1km&layers=Grid-2km&layers=Grid-10km"
+
        "&styles=&styles=&styles=&styles=" +
        "&format=image/png&crs=EPSG:27700")

        rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(url, 'NBN WMS layer', 'wms')
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(rlayer)

        rlayer.setSubLayerVisibility("Grid-10km", False)
        rlayer.setSubLayerVisibility("Grid-2km", True)
        rlayer.setSubLayerVisibility("Grid-1km", False)
        rlayer.setSubLayerVisibility("Grid-100m", False)

Hi Stefan,

Unfortunately I don't have the time to look further into the issue. Did 
you have a look at the WMS requests that QGIS is creating? Maybe this 
helps a bit.

I am fortunate enough to work in just one projection system ...

Gratitude is best for all of you for your hard work and effort. and made
available freely QGIS.

Effectively Victor, I have verified that there are some errors in the
raster processing modules. The previous fix only applies to vector
processing in SAGA GIS.

Hi dev,

I found a bug in 'Filter Legend By Map Content'. For point vector layer 
render with 'displacement point', when 'Filter Legend By Map Content' is 
activated, the legend is not rendered even if it has to be.

I'd like to correct it. Where the 'Filter Legend By Map Content' is done ?
I think it's due to the style definition. Is someone known which file is

My apologies - I didn't check the latest version of MMQGIS so my statement
that the animation feature doesn't work with the latest version of QGIS was
incorrect. It seems that they have solved the problem that I encountered,
so I'll take a look at the code there.

(I hope that this message comes out in the correct thread - I couldn't see
how to do it, so I'm sending a message with the same title. I'm new to
these mailing lists.)

Hey Richard,

There is a new class you can use for the rendering because we now have MTR
you have to wait for the image, or listen for the done event.  The code is
pretty easy and you can see an example of me using it here:

 https://github.com/DMS-Aus/qgis2img/blob/master/qgis2img/render.py#L43

The basics are:

    job = QgsMapRendererParallelJob(settings)
    job.start()
    job.waitForFinished()
    image = job.renderedImage()

settings is a QgsMapSettings class which you can make or take from the
canvas using iface.mapCanvas().mapSetttings()

QgsMapSettings has a list of layers to render so you can update that
without changing the layers on the canvas, it's very handy.

Give that a try and see how you go.

- Nathan

Hi Richard,

You may also want to have a look at the Atlas serial printing. It is 
getting more and more powerful with each QGIS release.

Maybe it does what you need?

Hi,

I wonder if we could offer "all in one" OSX QGIS packages in the future?

The average OSX user is afraid of installing separate frameworks - even 
if its very simple. The normal install way on OSX is just drag and drop 
to the applications folder.

Is there a particular technical reason why we cannot include GDAL/GSL 
into the QGIS package? I know that it wouldn't be shared with other 
FOSSGIS software then - but would this matter a lot?

No need to migrate, we can support both for a transition period

Mainly some CMake magic for PyQt5. I guess it's not too hard.
And migration of no-longer-supported http-code in evis plugin (port to
networkaccessmanager)

Yes, I did (QGIS for Android runs with Qt5)

http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/pyqt4_differences.html

Yes, some classes are no longer supported but the delta is small

The biggest problem will probably be old-style signal/slot connections.
Maybe we should encourage people to use new-style connections to be
prepared.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MTR and Postgis - lots of crashes
Message-ID: <545B42BA.7010307@carto.net>

Hi,

Am I the only one that still gets a lot of crashes with complex projects 
when the data sources are on Postgis and MTR (parallel rendering in 
multiple cores) is turned on? I get most crashes on Windows, hardly any 
on Linux, but this may be due to the fact that Linux accesses Postgis 
locally, whereas the Win QGIS clients access Postgis remotely. Turning 
off MTR --> no more crashes.

Is MTR and Postgis working flawlessly for everyone?

These crashes really annoy me and I have to turn off MTR until these 
problems are fixed.

Thank you for any hints / sharing your experiences with Postgis and MTR.

Andreas

Many thanks for all the help. Before I got the responses, I found a way to
make it work, but I'm clearly not working with the new paradigm, so I will
revisit it soon. That code looks very neat Nathan. Thanks for the tip about
Atlas Andreas - I will look at that too.

Thanks and best wishes,

I experienced freezes with MTR when I used joined attributes for 
symbology/labelling. The joins being not cached.
My interpretation was that the number of allowed connections to postgres 
reached its maximum, and hence no connection is available to fetch the 
layers used for labeling/symbology.

Caching all my joins saved the problem on my side.


I don't experience any trouble either on win or linux, and I suppose I 
can say I have complex projects ;)

Hi Denis,

Thanks for the hint.

I had a check on the nr of open connections on our PostgreSQL server.

The results of

SELECT sum(numbackends) FROM pg_stat_database;

are always in the 20ies.

I allow 100 connections on the PostgreSQL server. So this does not 
explain the problems.

The crashes always happen directly after project load. Once its loaded 
without a crash I never have subsequent crashes.

So something critical seems to happen on project load.

Andreas

QGIS allows 5 max I think
So whenever QGIs reaches the max number of connections, it can't fetch 
the requested layer but still waits for it...

Hi Andr?,

My PC has 8 cores. I reduced it to 7 max cores (still crashes), 4 (still 
crashes), 3 cores (still crashes), 2 (no more crashes).

Very strange ...

So obviously, things get worse if I go beyond 2 cores (out of 8).

Well - two cores are better than one, but it is not very nice that the 
other six can't be used.

Hi,

And how can I as a user control that the maximum should not be reached? 
Can I?

It should be possible, there is a build option to do that, though I haven't fully tested it.  (GSL is bundled, I keep forgetting to ask someone to fix the QGIS donwload page to remove that requirement.)

You would miss out on GDAL driver plugins, especially those with non-GPL-compatible licenses.  They would still need separate installers, and I would have to figure out where to install them.  Probably a QGIS application support mirroring GDAL's, though it could share use of the normal GDAL plugins.  Not in the application, not proper.

Required python modules are another thing that would be needed to be bundled.  But users would still need to separately install other Python modules needed by any QGIS plugins they installed.

About the installer vs. drag-n-drop: the installer is needed for compiling the python scripts and creating the browser alias.  Drag-n-drop is not the only "normal" installation method on OS X.  Installers are just as "normal".

Besides sharing GDAL with other software, GDAL and the Python modules are very useful on their own, and I hear from many people who do use them separately from and alongside QGIS.

One thing I'm not sure about, if QGIS knows to specify the GDAL resource dir (datums, projections, ...) if it's not at the default location programmed into GDAL.  And that goes for not only GDAL as a library, but the GDAL tools and GDAL python.  (and other libraries that have resource dirs like PROJ and geotiff)

I have considered an alternative: putting the current GDAL and Python module installers on the QGIS installer disk image.  It's one download, but users would still have to install each of them in the right order.

The problem with this, and another problem with the bundling method, is that when any of the pieces change, I have to package the whole thing again (and with bundling that means saving the compiled source and running the make install again to do the bundling, and hope that something doesn't trigger a recompile).  And the user has to download the whole monster again and install it.

I'd just like to second the notion of an easier install for mac, an
installer would be great, and I'd really like it if, just like the osgeo
installer, you could specify that you want the oracle support installed too-

Hi Sylvain,
I?m not seeing this. For me at least, using 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6, all exhibit the same behaviour with showing SRID?s for layers that have geometry. All are correctly showing the SRID as 8607 (Oracle?s version of WGS84).

Maybe it?s your connection options?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi,

There?s difference between 2.2 and 2.6 release when scanning an Oracle database:
With 2.2 table?s SRID are well identified, not with 2.6 and DB is the same.

What should be the reason of these different behaviour? (and the solution ;-)?

Thanks

I'm attempting to use an SVG image of a compass rose as a background
element that is rotated by a data defined number of degrees.

Currently, when the image is rotated, the numbers on the outside of the
ring are not rotating as expected along with the rest of the image (I want
to rotate the image as a whole).

I thought perhaps QGIS might be rotating each object within the SVG
independently but that doesn't seem to be the case either

Am I doing something wrong or is this an issue with the SVG or perhaps
QGIS' SVG rendering?

I've included links to the SVG itself as well as a screenshot of what it
currently looks like in QGIS and what I'd expect it to look like (as done
manually in Inkscape).

Have you connected the svg image to your map? Since you can have more than
one map in the same composition,  you need to select the map that will
control the image rotation.

Yes, the image is rotating (using magnetic variation as the data defined
property) but it's not all rotating correctly (see the linked images)

This is just the standard QGIS window, not a composition

My ignorant understanding of the (windows, right?) osgeo installer is that it downloads the bits you choose to install.  That's a bit complex for me to setup and maintain, and I would prefer to stick to standard OS X installer mechanisms.  I personally don't like installer installers (and stores for that matter), it makes for unecessary redownloading when installing on multiple computers, or reinstalling.

Hi William,

The OSGeo4W installer allows to have a local package repository in your 
LAN (e.g. on a network drive). But I agree, it would be a lot of work to 
have something similar on OSX - and then it would be too complicated for 
the OSX people (except the Unix tribe among the OSX users).

I regard Oracle support as non-standard usage where it is ok to install 
separate frameworks/libraries. But it would be very nice if the standard 
package could install without the extra framework requirements. I know, 
you would never be able to satisfy all users, but probably 90%. I don't 
know how many of the QGIS OSX users really need the non GPL stuff (like 
ecw, MrSID). I always tell users to stay away from these proprietary 
formats ...

This, and an easy way to install a QT5-QGIS version, so plugin devs who
are not able to compile can 'just install QT5-QGIS and just test their
plugin?

Hi Werner

https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS/tree/final-2_4_0-qt5

You may need to revert
9c6f1698fcb3

Make sure that dependencies are also compiled and linked against Qt5 
(QWT/QWTPolar being the most prominent ones).

Start in an empty build directory

run `cmake -DENABLE_QT5=TRUE -DWITH_BINDINGS=FALSE`

hmm
obviously Qt5.3 is minimum for compiling .. because it is searching
for a qtpositioning here and as I only have Qt5.1.1 available here I
am out of testing it :)
waiting for the distribution update *gg*

thanks for the info anyway ..

Message-ID: <CAFF9Zht6BzEFeSqZ7z2aspYV=rN43xigmdhWvYTcU+w+ZGSpEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I "Submitted" the new version of VTerrain inserting github as a repository and
tracker.

However, I did a stupid thing: I accidentally deleted the entire project
VTerrain in qgis repository (while I wanted to delete only the last version)
.

Then I re-created by inserting the latest version. So now, I lost the
"historic" version :(

Too bad. My question is: Can you recover?


OK, anyway, please see if it is in place and is approvable.


Thank you

Roberto

You're right Jonathan,

If I choose the option ? Only search in the metadata table" SRID is correctly displayed.
But this is a difference between releases.

Objet : RE: 2.2 -> 2.6 oracle table SRID not identified

Hi Sylvain,
I'm not seeing this. For me at least, using 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6, all exhibit the same behaviour with showing SRID's for layers that have geometry. All are correctly showing the SRID as 8607 (Oracle's version of WGS84).

Maybe it's your connection options?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2.2 -> 2.6 oracle table SRID not identified


Hi,

There's difference between 2.2 and 2.6 release when scanning an Oracle database:
With 2.2 table's SRID are well identified, not with 2.6 and DB is the same.

What should be the reason of these different behaviour? (and the solution ;-)?

Thanks

Sylvain Pierre

I just created a pull request for Qt5.

There is no QtPositioning in there, so you may try again if you like so :)

Anybody is kindly invited to test, review and comment.

Thank you

Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP203832181278C60DB8E4AABA7850@phx.gbl>

Dear list,

i'm trying lizmap web client and can't get how the print tool
is to be configured.

I'm using ubuntu server 12.04 with qgis-server (2.6.0.);
for the QGIS project i'm using QGIS 2.0.6.
The Lizmap (2.10.0) demo works, also the print tool works for the demo 
project,
so i think i'm doing somethin wrong with my configuration:

for the test i set up a couple of vector layers and prepared a simple
layout with QGIS composer with a map, legend and a title;
anyway when i open the project the print icon does not appear
in the lizmap toolbar, even if the print tool is checked in lizmap plugin;

any hint or redirect to relevant documentation is very apreciated,

thanks and compliments for the grat job with this tools,

Roy.

hm - I can't tell you exactly what the problem is.

BUT: you cannot mix versions. If your server runs on QGIS 2.6, your 
client where you prepare the project also needs to be of the same 
version 2.6. Those different versions are not necessarily compatible.

It will open all sorts of problems if you mix version 2.0 and 2.6

Dear Andreas,

thanks for your replay,

actually i inverted 0 and 6 in my previous email sorry for the mess !

i'm using QGIS 2.6.0 both in client (Desktop) and server side.

Also i wonder if using QGIS desktop on Windows, to setup the project
and the composer template, is "safe" considering that the server is 
Ubuntu/Linux...

anyway i'm not able to get the print tool to work preparing the project 
and template
in Windows, nor in Linux ...

thanks again,

Roy.

Hi Roy,

The documentation is not fully in english but the documentation exists 
in French.
The page about configuring print is here :
http://docs.3liz.com/fr/publisher_guide/advanced_lizmap_config.html#configurer-l-impression

Do you have activated Print capabilities for the map in lizmap plugin ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer... current status and the way forward?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgFWmh=5WROnz7XEyjZ9htXu-zyC6xDJp1scV8LbSNoEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm seeking feedback about the best way to move forward with QGIS' map
composer. I'm currently running up against some large issues with the
current design and API of composer which are holding back important
features and fixes. Some of these issues include:

- there's too much composer logic tied up in app and gui. This makes
it very difficult for plugins to manipulate and export compositions
without duplicating large blocks of code
- there's too much item-specific logic and handling scattered through
QgsComposition, QgsComposerView and QgsComposer. This makes it
impossible to have features like plugin generated item types, and
makes maintenance difficult.
- everything is coded to expect measurements and sizes in mm. I can't
(nicely) add support for other units without breaking api or resorting
to a lot of hacks
- same for mixed page sizes and orientations within a single
composition, this requires an api break to implement cleanly
- I need to totally break composer api in order to fix the instability
in undo/redo commands (see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11371)
- QgsComposition should not require a QgsMapSettings/QgsMapRenderer.
This should instead be set individually for map items. Doing so would
pave the way for features such as reprojection support for individual
map items.
- the composer is full is deprecated methods and legacy api

I've slowly come to the conclusion that the way forward is to move to
a bunch of new classes, much like what was done with symbologyV2. If
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/9 passes then
these would be named QgsLayout, QgsLayoutDesigner, etc. If not, well,
I'll have to resort to QgsCompositionV2, etc.

The potential problem with this approach is how to handle the GUI and
existing projects. As far as I can see, there's a few options:
1. Expose both the existing composer and the new layout designer to
users. Composers aren't automatically upgraded to layouts. This
approach means that existing PyQgis code and plugins will still
function for existing projects, but at the expense of a confusing
experience for users.
2. Add all the new layout classes and keep the existing composer
classes. Composer would NOT be exposed in the GUI and compositions are
upgraded to layouts when projects are opened. This approach means that
standalone python code would still operate, but plugins or code which
are designed to be run from within QGIS would no longer function.
3. Move totally to the new layout classes and remove all composer
classes (unlikely)

I'm leaning toward option 2, but what are you thoughts? What's the
best approach to move forward? Obviously I'll submit all this as a QEP
when the plans are finalised, but for now I'm just after advice on the
preferred approach.

we are getting quite a lot of feedback (in the tracker, lists,

working/saving projects made with previous QGIS releases, ex:

Any one was able to find a pattern that would allow to track the

I'm wondering whether it has to do with a composer legend item crasher that
Martin fixed days ago.

Are users sharing the project files that make qgis crash?

Hi Giovanni,

This is still too vague. We need to narrow down the issues.

How about the plugins? Still crashes with no plugins?

What data sources? Is MTR on or not?

Please ask the reporter to provide more details and ask them to disable 
all plugins and retry.

Yes indeed, in the "Map" tab of the Lizmap plugin i activated the 
"Simple print" option

from the docs you pointed (i don't know french sadly) but with Google 
Translate i understand that
only the map element is mandatory and other elements can be set up as
north arrow and legend etc..;

the template i'm testing only has a map element in A4 landscape page


in the apache log i get

[Thu Nov 06 16:25:37 2014] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Warning 1: Unable 
to find driver JP2ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.
[Thu Nov 06 16:25:37 2014] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Warning 1: Unable 
to find driver ECW to unload from GDAL_SKIP environment variable.

but print in the "Lizmap Demo" works so maybe not related...


thanks again,

Roy

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SAGA's buffer help files
Message-ID: <CAMMN2u3osUSmDWGj4K3QVvz2jTKW7zdMXHRW3hHxqUj3WhTJ2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I noticed that the help files of SAGA are not aligned with the algorithms.
Shape buffer (fixed distance) and shape buffer (attributes distance)
have the same help that is not aligned with the parameter window.

Should I open a ticket?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Roy,

I take a look at the commit list in lizmap-web-client release 2.10 and 
we fixed this bug after the release.
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/commits/release_2_10

We need to publish a bugfix release just for QGIS 2.6. The issue is due 
to the new way to define overview in the QGIS Project XML.
You can download an intermediate here :
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/archive/release_2_10.zip

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

HI all,
working with the Master (but I think same behavior on 2.6) I cannot

Am I missing something?

Hi Nyall,
as I already told you privately, I agree with the second approach: remove
the current Composer and guarantee transparent auto-upgrade of existing
layouts in projects.
The improvements to the composer worth the effort, and the consequent
visual impact for users. The important thing is to guarantee old projects
to provide the same results (layouts) though, without re-designing them
from the ground.
Having both the old Composer and the new GUI tools would be misleading and
confusing to the users, and I imagine it would double the effort to mantain
both the tools.

Hi Nyall,

I also think that option 2 would work best. Option one would be very 
confusing (I remember the days when we had two labeling versions, 2 
symbology versions, etc. - awful!).

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field Calculator "permanence"
Message-ID: <545CEB1E.6050809@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I'm using QGIS 2.6.0 on Win 7 x64 - installed via OSGEO4w

Is there a way to store your field calculator expression to always 
process and update that specific field, should geometry be edited or 
created for that Layer?

Let's say I want to create a blank POINT shape file, with a text 
attribute called "Sheet".
Whenever a POINT is created or moved, I want this field to be 
dynamically updated with:

      tostring(abs(toint($y)))+tostring(abs(toint($x)))

For testing thus far have:

  * created 2 points
  * Opened the field calculator, clicked 'Update Existing Field' and put
    in the expression.
  * The two existing points now have the correct TEXT values in the
    Sheet field
  * I close the Field calculator
  * Create a new point in my layer
  * open the attribute table to find that the 'Sheet' field for this new
    point is blank
  * I open the Field Calculator and I cannot even find a way to call
    back the previous expression I used.


Am I using the correct QGIS functionality to achieve what I need to, and 
if so, where am I going wrong?

Thanks & regards,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

Since QGIS 2.6 this possibility exists. It is called "Virtual Field".
You must not create the attribute when creating the shapefile. Just open
the field calculator, create a new field in there and check the "virtual
field" checkbox.

Regards,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,
Thanks for the quick answer.
The virtual field acts just like I want it to, except that it does not 
permanently store the column in the attribute table.
I tried getting clever by then adding a second 'Field Calculation' to 
update the existing 'Sheet' field from the virtual field, but that won't 
do it either.

So, for me there are two shortcomings:

 1. To be able to store and recall the 'Expression' and not lose it
    after closing the Field Calculator
 2. To be able to add the virtual fields that you create, into the
    attribute table.
 3. (And then of course to re-open the Shape file on another PC and have
    these Field Calculations still functional)

Any further possibilities I can try?

Regards & thanks again,
Zoltan

Hi,

What you probably ask for are database triggers combined with storage. 
This is not what virtual fields are for. If they were stored - they 
wouldn't be called virtual ;-)

You can do that f.e. with Postgis. With shapefiles not. However, if you 
share the project with the other PC, the virtual fields work fine.

Hi Andreas,
I'll fiddle with the Postgis idea - thanks.
The orange part below:
I closed the shapefile, deleted from legend and re-opened it - but could 
not see my virtual field, nor the expression I used to create it.
Have I missed a trick somewhere?

Regards,
Z

we could still add materialized virtual fields :-)

... or use layer -> save as before sharing it. That will make a
permanent copy of the values at the time of saving.

Hi Zoltan,

If you remove and re-add the shapefile you will of course loose the 
virtual fields, as they are stored with the project and not with the data.

However, if you save a layer definition file along with the shapefile 
and re-add that, they are preserved. So you can just store the layer 
definition file along with the shape and you are fine to share the data 
with your colleagues, preserving virtual fields ;-)

Hi Andreas,
I was hoping the QGIS project would keep the definition of the virtual 
fields - at least until I exited QGIS - and then by re-opening the same 
SHP file, I hoped for a reconnection of virtual fields. Yes, I know it's 
not that simple, but exploring QGISes abilities is what I am playing 
with now.

Thanks for the pointer to 'Save Layer Definition file' - I've never 
noticed that, so I'll play with that for a bit.

Thanks to Matthias too for his comments.
Yes, it is a bummer that you can only generate virtual content 
_dynamically_ with the FC (and SHP files).

Hopefully not to open a can of worms, but I can't see any reason why 
QGIS cannot create some sort of information/status/whatever file by 
using a '.Qstuff' type file extension stored with the SHP file name. 
This would not interfere with other SW using SHP files, and would 
greatly enhance QGIS's ability in processing this (really hateful) file 
format.
I abhor SHP file format, but it has unfortunately become the de facto 
request from clients, so it would be nice to have more advanced 
processing capabilities for this format.

Regards & have a good weekend.
Zoltan

Indeed it is the same nasty bug. Mathieu discovered it and I have
fixed it in master few days ago, now the fix is also in release-2.6
branch.

Unfortunately it is really an ugly one as it not only crashes, but
also clears the project file as the crash happens during the save :-(

Hi,
OK - not very intuitive, (to have to either drag and drop the qlr file 
into the layer panel, or to "add layer from definition file")

Any reason that QGIS can't be made to look for qlr files when opening 
the SHP file "the normal way"?

Regards & thanks for the help.

Good news - due to popular demand I have reverted the change in master
and release-2_6 branch.

Hi,

I don't get the point in keeping the old classes if we upgrade the
composers to layouts at opening ? Doesn't migration happen at XML level ?


Maybe while thinking about reworking the composer, we could think about a
new feature : real templates (aka "masters" in Indesign).

All elements added to a "master" appear on all the page that apply it. This
is very handy: you can always edit the master (move some elements, change
the fonts/colors, etc.), and the changes are reflected on all the layouts.
The challenging part from an UI point of view is the required ability to
override the content of templates elements (for instance the extent of a
map, the text of a textbox, etc.)

I thought of making a plugin for this, but got discouraged because of the
problem you exposed... So it would be a good test case to see if the future
API for the layouts allows to implement this easily ;)

Thanks !

Olivier

Hi Paulo: I can't reproduce the error against the RNDT and Geoportale
CSW endpoints using 2.6.  Which version of QGIS/MetaSearch are you
working off?  It looks like MetaSearch is being loaded from a local
plugin install.

IMO, this is serious enough to package a 2.6.1 release speedily. There are
enough ppl out there that don't backup their documents on a regular basis
for this bug to be hugely problematic.

It would allow standalone scripts which utilise compositions, or scripts
which operate within qgis but without any gui, to still function.

Hmmm.. Intriguing idea. On my longer term radar is a rework of how composer
item properties work. I think eventually we need to switch to a property
browser for setting item properties (think qt designer style). A new button
just like the data defined button could be used to set property
inheritance. (I think eventually labelling could use the same widget). This
is out of scope for the planned 2.8 work, but I'll keep it in mind whilst
doing the redesign.

Nyall,

Please, let's not go down the road of two options to do the same thing (ala
double symbology & double labelling engine era of qgis 1.x)

Nor can we leave users' previously saved composers broken.

So #2 seems to be the wining option.

A fundamental change like that would go very well with a name change too.

Every move that gets us closer to having non mm units is worth the sweat :)

I am trying to figure out how the things would work...

How would you decide whether to copy native index of a virtual table?
(Always?) E.g. pkey at least in Postgres is also index - shall we
always copy it?
When would you make copies of native indexes? (When constructing the
provider? On every getFeatures() call?)
How would you keep the index up to date? (Table may change outside of QGIS)

What I want to understand is how SQL select statements would execute -
like the one with join filter you need:

SELECT * FROM tblA LEFT JOIN tblB ON tblA.X = tblB.Y WHERE tblY.Z = 42

Personally I do not see much difference in having some functionality
in 'core' and having some functionality in c++ plugin (included in
QGIS tree) - in both cases that requires us to maintain such code once
it is added...

Why not develop a prototype that does not require QGIS code - I guess
the only QGIS-specific part is the virtual table implementation. Such
prototype could eventually evolve to a standalone library providing
SQL parser / execute engine with a nice interface...

Hi all,

I'm just wondering - given a few large changes coming up, including:
- qt5 support, possibly breaking plugins
- potential composer redesign, breaking api
- geometry rework, where an api break would result in a better
foundation moving forward

... is it worth exploring the idea of making the next release QGIS 3.0
and breaking API? I know the original plan was for 3.0 to coincide
with python 3 support, but that doesn't appear to be anywhere on the
horizon yet.

Personally I think we should still do 2.8, LTR it, and then we can do 3.0
for the next release.

Breaking the API again without a LTR in place makes me nervous as the 2.0
API really wasn't that long ago.

Yes. But you could as well do this:

    renderer1.setSourceColorRamp(ramp.clone())
    renderer2.setSourceColorRamp(ramp)

Indeed it is not very Pythonic. Qt library is able to avoid such
issues much better. Why is that: when /Transfer/ is needed (e.g. in
calls involving QObject-based classes), the classes explicitly
remember their parents/children. So even if you try to assign one
object to two different parents (like above), it will be actually
moved from one parent to another. QGIS API does not handle it and
that's why we have these issues. A solution would be to make internal
copies of objects in functions like setSourceColorRamp(). That would
solve the issue, but it will add an extra copy we didn't want. There
is solution for that either - to use implicit sharing. If the color
ramp class supported implicit sharing, the copy would be just shallow
(no memory copying) - and it would be a win.

I think for a future major release of QGIS we could go through the API
and see where we have these problems - and ideally fix them as
suggested above. However the implicit sharing has also its downsides -
the implementation is slightly more complex and it adds a little bit
of overhead. But it's nothing we couldn't handle :-)


> Would it be better to set up the SIP so that it always used the clone() function, and so that a python coder didn't have think about whether they might have yielded ownership of a python object.  Presumably there is a way to write the SIP to do this?  And would this create issues in those environments (eg windows 64) where the transfer function doesn't seem to work reliably, and python subclassed objects need to be deliberately kept alive?

I don't think that trying to solve this at SIP level would be good.
Any deviation between C++ and Python API (in terms of some special
code for SIP) is a pain, so if possible let's address that in C++ code
(with improvements for both C++ and Python devs). Also from C++
developer's point of view, it is much nicer if you do not need to
think how the ownership is handled in each such method.

Cheers

Couldn't we branch 2.6 off to become a LTR?

+1000  for  LTS

I am with you:  please, stop to change the api. 
If we like new functions, please add them, without change old ones. 

Thank you

In my case, on Win 7 64 bit,  QGIS 2.6 crashes with minidump each time I quit, also doing nothing (that is, no project, no file loaded)

It is normal ?

LTS  please.

It is not vague:
my QGIS 2.6 on Win 7  64 bit crashes ever when exit with a minidump. 

I have no plugin loaded, also.

Hi

QGIS 3 should come with python 3. I don't think that python 3 can be a
smooth transition so this would require us to make QGIS 4 and break
plugins once again.

Qt5 support does not require QGIS 3.

Geometry and Composer(Layout) may need QGIS 3. But then we can as well
just introduce python 3 as well.

Can you open a bug report for this.
Please try to start QGIS with --noplugins and see if that makes a change

I agree, LTS and reducing the number of breakages fit well together;
concentrating breakages (Qt5, Py3, layout, etc.) in a single release
seems a better option, especially for plugin developers.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Please don't list Qt5 in breakages.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Save selection as
Message-ID: <545DDFD1.8060302@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I realized that the "save selection as" was moved to "save as". I
appreciate that because it reduces clutter in the layer tree context menu.
I wonder if this should be checked by default whenever there is
something selected on the layer? Just like the field calculator checks
"only update selected" by default whenever there is a selection.

Hi Matthias,

I'm a little confused - I was under the impression that some web related
classes had been removed from qt5 (hence the mention of a possible
breakage). Maybe I misinterpreted something.. If not, apologies for the
noise.

Also PyQt4 imports won't work anymore so that would be a break right?

Hi,

The confusion comes from that there are two different things:

 * Qt5 compatibility
 * Qt5 binaries

The first one is a thing about the QGIS source code (qt5 branch).
The second one is about compiling/packaging.

The first step does not break anything. And allows to deprecate certain
features (e.g. qgshttptransaction) to allow for a smooth transition. It
is possible to write code that works with both versions.

The second step may actually break things. But that is not tied to a
version tag in our git repository but to a packagers decision.

*TL;DR:*

 *  Introducing Qt5 support in the QGIS source code does not break anything.
 *  Your distro actually shipping QGIS {2,3} compiled against Qt5 may
break stuff.

Makes sense now, thanks. However, by Debian removing Qt4, aren't we
effectively in a situation where users are going to have a qt api break
forced upon them, regardless of any decisions/actions we can make?

In terms of project management it would probably be good to have a
"recommended Qt version". To avoid the situation that certain users are
running the same version of QGIS with Qt4 others with Qt5 and therefore
some plugins work on one platform, some on others.

Debian seems to release at a rate of about 0.5/year, so we still have
more than 2 years to go before we are forced to release a Qt5 version
(we still may do it earlier if we like and we still could decide to have
a WITH_INTERNAL_QT4 CMake option ;) ).

I agree with a LTS version (what's LTR??? :-) ). It should be
important that the 2.X will not be "abbandoned" like as the last 1.X
series (1.8), with the Postgres primary key bug that remained UNFIXED
and that version was pretty useless...

+1 and even without officially breaking the API, plugin devs have been
quite busy with other changes which kept breaking plugins such as
multi-threaded rendering.

Seems like a UX question ;-)

I'm with J?rgen, it's very likely to confuse users because they don't
realize that the had a selection and then they find that features are
missing in the export.
The field calculator behavior still catches me from time to time even
though I'm aware it exists.

But I don't have a opinion on it - there's probably no save default for it.  In
that way having the two menu entries might have been better.

break anything.
Once that's in place, we can start to check if/where are problems and
draw a migration path.

The questions concerning the migration path are, when do packagers start
to compile (the official releases) against Qt5? All at the same
time/release? (To be kept in mind: Android is already compiled against
Qt5, some older distros that have old Qt4 versions may decide to switch
even sooner than newer distros because for them it's easier to compile
against Qt5 than to patch the source code for their old Qt4 version).
Will distros offer qgis-qt5 and qgis-qt4 in parallel? In terms of
project management a clear roadmap would be good. That however is mainly
driven by political questions and not by technical questions (most
likely QGIS 2.8 will be ready for Qt5). I would suggest to wait for
PR1676 to be merged PyQt5 support to be included. Then we can test and
decide based on more solid experiences.

All the best,
Matthias

Yes, 2.8 LTR is the least we need to do for users that spent time to
update to 2.0.

try (backup) and delete the .qgis2 folder, I have seen this a lot on
qgis installations where qgis was previously installed, and purging
.qgis2 usually works.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python tests and C++ tests for the same
	functionality
Message-ID: <545E1AEF.7050805@gmx.ch>

Hi,

While working on the test suite and trying to get all tests to pass I
realized that there are a lot of tests that exist in two versions: C++
and python (e.g. composerhtml, atlas composition). The problem with that
is, that they work on the same set of reference images and either one or
the other fails because of slight inconsistencies in the result (nothing
we should worry about, see e.g. [1]). I don't know exactly, what the
source of these is, I assume that either there are some
rounding/floating point differences in the python API or that meanwhile
one or the other test was modified but not both synchroneously.

What can we do?

(1) We could accept these deviations with anomalies or multiple
reference images.

(2) Or we could remove the C++ test in favor of the python test which
will test the same functionality/codepath and the python binding in
addition. That would have the advantage that maintainability will be
easier, because not every of these tests needs to be written and
adjusted twice. The only disatvantage I can see is that you then don't
know if it's the python binding or the logic behind it that made a test
fail. But that shouldn't make a big difference in the time one needs to
debug a test.

My favorite is (2).

Are there any thoughts from other devs/authors of these tests?

Best
Matthias

+1 for LTS (2.6 or 2.8?).
A new API break risks to make users (and plugin developers) quite nervous!

E.G. the coming QEP from Nyall (about Composer refactoring) breaks Composer
gui API, while it should mantain core. This could be included in an LTS
release, while in QGIS 3.0 back compatibility can be discarded.

Just a question: typically an LTS brings backport updates during its
lifetime. In case of QGIS how would this happen? Will we provideca new
packaging for that release with a scheduling following the master release?

Great !!!   :)     Now it works.    I will test inserting plugins one by
one.

I updated the issue list


Thank you   :)

Vote for 2. Python is a lot easier to test in, and no building step.

I think it'd be useful to figure out the source of the problem before
deciding on a solution.

Can python tests effectively be used to find memory errors/leaks ?

I have not investigated deeply, but in this cases it may not be a
plugin, but some (old) configuration stored inside .qgis2.

Hi Zoltan,

There are many other file formats besides shapes, including many 
databases. So people should stop thinking that the universe only circles 
around shapefiles.

With these other file formats it is not very common to ship other files 
along with the main file.

Why do you think that drag/drop or "add layer" is unintuitive. Those are 
the normal ways to load a layer in QGIS.

I had two crashes (with qgis project file empty) in a row applying a 
"rule-based"
style (old 2.2/2.4 QGIS style modified with QGIS 2.6) to a vector layer 
and saving
the project (brand new 2.6 project) but i can't reproduce it now;
maybe something related to styles. This **may** explain why removig 
".qgis" folder
(and related style database) seems to work...

Roy.

always **if i can** and**IMHO** an LTS should be a tool that you know 
you can relay on
with known and expected behavior so no new feature only bugfix or 
critical bugfix

My reservation with switching solely to the python tests is that it
makes debugging a lot more difficult. With c++ tests it's easy to run
a test from a debug session in qt creator to help track down a bug.
The workflow for python tests is a lot more difficult... (or is there
a way I'm missing of running these tests through qt creator too?).

For this reason, I'd vote for c++ tests for most methods and python
tests only when anything fancy is done is the sip bindings (transfer
of ownership, etc).

Hi,
I?m working with 2.6,  in the Layer module. I find it difficult to see both the style and the editing pencil because they are on top of each other.
I realize that it save space in height, but it has become very difficult to read which layer are in edit mode.  Is there a special reason for this change of behavior from 2.4 to 2.6 ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Stability (2.8 LTS) vs development (3.0),
	a proposed way forward
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=qCK9ervDH-KCN97XgC8k+CLo0JtAXoMtq-Ds3_WUCAww@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

The recent thread Nyall kick-started with his  ?QGIS 3.0?? email got me to
think about the eternal stability vs. development dilemma it (re-)exposed
through the conversation.

More specifically, it got me to brainstorm on the best way forward for QGIS
at this juncture and whether there's a way to accommodate both the folks
calling for a 2.8 LTS version, and others in need for space to further
develop and expand QGIS' capability.

And, I might just have found a way to do so. Here's the proposal, in a
couple of points:

- We make the 2.8 development cycle ?fix and refinement?-only, and reduce
the cycle's length to 6 to 8 weeks;
- The reduced cycle will help everyone's focus on the above goal;
- We append the freed 8-10 weeks to the subsequent development cycle, which
would become QGIS 3.0;
- The expanded cycle will help give space to develop some of the exciting
features being cooked by developers (Nyall's Layouts, Marco's Geometry
redesign, etc.) and bulletproof those.

This, IMHO, caters to both groups demanding stability and space for
development. It doesn't discourage or delay too much the grand scheme
changes, and pushes out a 2.8 version focused on stability through a
shorter cycle focusing on delivering a perfected tool.

The above proposal does require a momentary lapse of the nice 4-month
release cycle rhythm which the QGIS has successfully maintained for three
releases now. But, it might actually be what's needed at this very time.
Plus, the length of the two cycles stays the same, 8 months.

Comments? I'm obviously particularly interested in what J?rgen has to say :)

Cheers

Math

I think an option to make the background color of map canvas
transparent is useful. Also, if image file has a transparent color
(GIF) or alpha channel (RGBA PNG), the transmission option should be
automatically enabled.

Please open a ticket if you like.

Hi,
I am not part of the development of QGIS, but as a user, please consider 
the following:

    Currently every 3rd release of QGIS is billed as a Long Term Release.
    So:
    Switch this to February every Even numbered year


Yes, this thought is in line with Ubuntu LTS plans, and I am ware not 
"everyone" uses Ubuntu,
But,
As someone who runs a production house, I have to keep both stability 
and latest features in mind.
I run my servers on Ubuntu Server LTS, and know that I have a window of 
opportunity to change every 2 years. With this is peace of mind, and I 
can get on with the fun (read: bleeding edge) stuff, knowing that I will 
not blow up my servers.

For those deploying QGIS in a production environment, such peace of mind 
might also be welcome.
So rather than releasing an "LTR" version every 3rd release (which will 
slip as the intermediate releases might slip), give the Enterprise users 
a chance to plan their production installations using a calendar, and 
not have to keep track of "Oh, is this the 2nd or 3rd release coming up???)

I chose the "Two months before Ubuntu LTS" because QGIS could either 
hang their LTR onto "nothing", or coincide it in good time before 
another reliable release date happens (and thus get the QGIS LTR into 
the LTS repositories as well).

Just a thought.
Regards,
Zoltan

Are you aware of QEP3? Please read Tim's suggestion. There are good reasons
for this stable 4 month cycle at exactly the current release times of the
year.

The idea was indeed to reduce the height - and in many cases it helps
a lot. Maybe we can just slightly change the way how the editing
pencil is shown - for example to put it next to symbol preview icon
(instead of drawing over it) - would that work for you?

Anita,

Thanks for pointing out QEP#4, I wasn't aware of it. Tim has done an
impressive work there.

The above-mentioned QEP is a long term thing, what I was suggesting is a
very short term (i.e. 2 cycles) proposal to try and satisfy the current
needs for stability and devlopment momentum. I also am familiar with the
discussion surrounding the 4 month cycle dates having been carefully
chosen, hence why I was thinking that redistributing weeks within the
context of two cycles wouldn't break that on the long term (i.e., by the
end of the proposed two cycles, we're still 8 months from now, etc.)

Thank you for your comments

I did not mean to exclude all C++ tests. If somebody wants or needs to
write tests in C++ please continue to do so.

I am referring only the ones that duplicate python tests. I don't think
they have additional value and make maintainability harder. In general I
think instead of rewriting the same test in another language it should
be preferred to write a test for another functionality and increase
coverage.

Kind regards

Seeing this I can't resist to quote a bit of PEP-10 [1]

"""
+1 I like it
+0 I don't care, but go ahead
-0 I don't care, so why bother?
-1 I hate it

You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or
against) with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000.  These aren't
really valued much beyond the above scores, but it's nice to see
people get excited about such geeky stuff.

Hi all,
I hate cooling down the enthusiasm, but I really see LTS as an empty
word. To me, the whole issue boils down to having resources to do
serious backporting of fixes. Without that, LTS will have no practical
effect, as users will use the latest, more bugfixed version.
This is exactly what has happened in the past.
So from my point of view what we need is not +something, but funders
supporting backporting. I'd be against spending our limited core
funding for this.
In short: power users, if you need stability, please set aside some
funds to stably support a backporter, year round, and you'll have your
much sought after long term stability.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Behaviour when create new features
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A28056B4DE932@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

I have an inexperienced QGIS user who needed to draw some simple line strings. She created a new shapefile layer (line type), enabled editing and used the "Add Feature" button to draw a line string.


-          She didn't right click to finished the feature when she was done!

She saved the alterations (none because she didn't finish the feature creation process) and disabled editing. Upon opening the layer in another QGIS instance, the feature she created was missing - obvious since she didn't entirely created it.

Why did she though that she had created it?

Because even though she drew the line string (without saving it) and disabled the editing, the left over line string remains visible on the screen. You cannot click it, get feature info and so on, but it appears to be exactly where she created it.

I don't know if this is created as an issue but is this the expected behavior when creating and aborting new features?

This applies to QGIS 2.4 and 2.6.


Kind regards, Casper

"more bugfixed" is not always true. We had issues with 1.8.0 and 2.2.0
and we refused to use them in our organization due to critical bugs
that are fixed in newer version, but they have sometimes introduced
other.

So, I believe that in production environment the most stable (!=
latest) version is used. For almost 2 years we used 1.7.4, for me the
most stable QGIS version in earth (more than 2.4 and 2.6!).

Yep, that little third number in the version is really special.

Oh man. I couldn't even use 1.7.4 anymore it's so old ;)

Anyway the point is a valid one.  Running the latest != most stable.

IMO we don't need "resources" to do bug fixing.  The dev that does the bug
fix in master can do it in the 2.x branch for that stable release if it is
relevant.. This obviously has to be done smart but using the recent crash
and project corruption as an example that Martin fixed right away, to me
this warrants a new release off that branch, LTS or not, as project
corruption is a really really bad look.

There is no such a thing as the most stable version: what is blocking
for an user is not relevant for another. I have customers and friends
that cannot upgrade to various versions for very specific bugs.
I'm sorry to insist: backporting fixes is the only relevant thing in
this issue, IMO.
All the best.

Sorry I do not agree here: we had many cases of fixes breaking other
stuff, so backporting should be done with great care, and lots of
extra work; that's why I believe that without significant resources we
are not going to solve the problem satisfactorily.

All the best.

Reading this post i get a bit confused about the future of QGIS and its 
target,
because in the QGIS Release schedule for 2015 (QGIS web site) there is
a "2.8 LTR" release,
maybe this LTR release is to be bugfixed,
maybe just a release to stuck with if you don't like to switch but with 
no planned bug fixing,
this is no clear to me ...

It is also nice to have someone who keeps us with our feet on the ground :-)

thanks and regards,

Well, while I'd agree on that if there was no concept of LTS, in presence
of LTS whatever corruption happens would have to be expected by users
in all but LTS releases, meaning there'd be no rush to ever cut a new
release unless the "week of silence following fix in LTS branch" event
happens.

How far away would next (first) LTS be ?

Hi all,

QEP #4 allows to do backports for every release. Not only LTR. 2.6.1
will be very welcome.

LTR releases will be available for 1 year and will receive bugfixes
during that time. That's not going to happen magically. That requires
power users and organizations to help the development. Thank you Paolo
for raising this important point.

QEP #4 IMO outlines a frame in which organizations have more security in
what they invest. Documentation will be valid for a longer timeframe.
Things are less likely to break. There is the possibility of introducing
a new bug with another fix. But that's not a reason at all to not fix
something. Organizations which are using LTR will probably now already
be testing new releases heavily before they deploy. That will help to
discover such bugs fast.

Backporting features is not something I would like to see. That really
introduces a bigger risk of breaking things. If that's done we could
just stick to the current release schedule. (For every feature you will
find somebody who asks for a backport to LTR).

To me, QEP #4 is a wonderful plan. It needs the support of organizations!
Maybe some organizations can build a pool with funds and Q/A that is
determined to maintain that version?

Regards,
Matthias

using more simple (simple fill) symbology this does not appens

is this possibly a bug or are we not supposed to use "fancy" symbols

P.S.  is this the right list to ask questions about lizmap and qgis-server?

See if this is your case:

In short: make sure you have an (fake) X sever running.

A couple of thoughts from a non-dev looking inwards:

> Sorry I do not agree here: we had many cases of fixes breaking other stuff
Would not something like Unit Tests help ameliorate that? That's what they're designed for isn't it? I realise the state of QGIS' unit test infrastructure isn't optimal currently, but I thought I saw a project to fix get funding recently.

> : what is blocking for an user is not relevant for another. I have customers and friends that cannot upgrade to various versions for very specific bugs.

Then why not fix the bugs and require them to be backported? I know that seems flippant, but is there a reason that backporting by the submitter/committer can't be required for any bugfix submitted? If a bugfix breaks other stuff, then either the bugfix should be regressed or the breakage fixed with another fix.

Neither of these suggestions would require any outlay from the QGIS core fund, though they may increase the cost of any individual feature/bugfix. I believe GeoServer does both of these and has a healthy 30-day release schedule consisting of up to 3 branches despite having considerably fewer resources than QGIS.

Just my 2p.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Sorry I do not agree here: we had many cases of fixes breaking other stuff, so backporting should be done with great care, and lots of extra work; that's why I believe that without significant resources we are not going to solve the problem satisfactorily.

All the best.

Personally I?d think there are two bugs here, at least from a user-interface perspective, even if they?re not from a technical one:


a)     Edits showing when editing was disabled (I?ve seen this one myself).


b)    No warning that the edited features hadn?t been ?finished? when saving and/or when disabling editing.

(2.6 Testing indicates that disabling and then re-enabling editing while editing but not ?finishing? a feature shows that you continue editing the same feature; I?m not sure that?s very intuitive, hence item (b).)

Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Behaviour when create new features

I have an inexperienced QGIS user who needed to draw some simple line strings. She created a new shapefile layer (line type), enabled editing and used the ?Add Feature? button to draw a line string.


-          She didn?t right click to finished the feature when she was done!

She saved the alterations (none because she didn?t finish the feature creation process) and disabled editing. Upon opening the layer in another QGIS instance, the feature she created was missing ? obvious since she didn?t entirely created it.

Why did she though that she had created it?

Because even though she drew the line string (without saving it) and disabled the editing, the left over line string remains visible on the screen. You cannot click it, get feature info and so on, but it appears to be exactly where she created it.

I don?t know if this is created as an issue but is this the expected behavior when creating and aborting new features?

This applies to QGIS 2.4 and 2.6.


Kind regards, Casper

Agreed. Please consider, however, that this generally not something
that comes for free, and it will increase the cost of the bugfix, so
the customers must be clearly aware of this.

Hi,
Irrespective of which is the way to do it (I lean toward checking it when there's a selection), I'd suggest that the behaviour should be consistent. So either this default be changed, or the field calculator one be, otherwise you end up with confused users.

Cheers,
Jonathan

But I don't have a opinion on it - there's probably no save default for it.  In that way having the two menu entries might have been better.

Hi,
Is there an ETA on this? We're thinking of moving up to 2.6, but I can see this hitting us if we do.
Thanks,
Jonathan

Hi,

I think that functionality that works on selections and not on the whole 
layer should always be optional, and not the default.

And yes - consistency would be nice ;-)

Thanks,
Andreas

Yes. I know. That's exactly what I am banging my head about.
Do you know that some 15 years back, I had to spend vast amounts of 
energy explaining to some of my clients that SHP file format does NOT 
support topology!!
But I supposed I have been spoilt.
In 1984 when I started Geograph, I had a Mainframe (you know what that 
is? :-)  ) based GIS package (called SICAD) and in 1984 I could write 
scripts, crawl up and down the data structure and do almost anything 
because it had a fully topologically connected spatial data structure.
I ditched that in 1989 in favour of Unix based Genamap (now Linux) [and 
gone bung, but the SW still works], also FULL topology and full 
script-ability, and I still use that unless my clients demand that I use 
their software (and then they provide the licensing for the project).
So, I have mostly by-passed the rigorous requirements of conformity.

Ha ha ha... tell that to the masses.
Guess what format our friendly RSA mapping office gives out their Vector 
Data in?

Well, not so much the 'drag & drop', but the way Layer Definition Files 
are loaded:
Because I never thought of it as an option (yes, that's my failure), but 
also because intuitively it should be on the "Add Layer" button or list, 
and not as a separate item slightly further down.
If it appeared on the addlayer button, it would be noticed, and people 
would be more likely to check what that option does (and learn). It is 
in fact just another way to load a "map type".
So, I'm not at all grumbling, just suggesting that maybe that way of 
loading a layer should be on the Add Layer button/dropdown. (and not 
separately on the layer dropdown list)

Anyway, thanks for your input,
Regards,
Zoltan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry type conversion of 2.6
Message-ID: <CA+Bj0=qgsnGm-hJWpr+mxBhRqcZwpX-m+FmMOfcO9844DbJBFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just found size of .shp file increases more than twice (2900 bytes
-> 6500 bytes when it has 100 points) when I saved a point layer as a
shapefile. I didn't edit the layer anything, but the geometry type was
converted from Point to Multipoint.

Maybe this must not expected behavior. Is this a big bug of 2.6? See
also #11542 and #11597.

Minoru

For the geometry rework, it is not a problem to keep compatibility with 
2. It is even an advantage, as there is more time to adapt the numerous 
pieces of code that work with QgsGeometry.

I think it is to early to go for version 3, 2 has been released a bit 
more than a year ago.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

It would be very awesome to have live-linked templates! I would very 
much need them. I have a lot of operational projects and it is my fear 
that some day some details would change and I need to go into all of the 
projects and adopt things like logo, fonts, headers, etc. It would 
either require a script to process the .qgs files or a lot of manual work.

So +1 for having live templates. Nyall, maybe you can plan the redesign 
in a way to make it possible? I would also participate in financing the 
development of these live templates.

Andreas

Hey Paolo,

Did you build a project using the config manager first?  Roam itself is
just the viewer there is a different application to make the projects.

Hi,


Another thing which deserves some work IMO is the text boxes : either you
have to write HTML, or you're limited to 1 font/color/size per text box.
Even if it's not really linked to the global structure of the composer, an
improvement on this would have great impact on usability.

There must be some lightweight wysiwyg html editor library hat we could use
? Ideally it should implement styles that you can apply throughout a
project (probably through css classes, but I have the feeling someone
already talked about this idea ?).


And more about the live templates idea (if it's too much of a thread
hijacking please start another one) :

Maybe to avoid confusion between templates and live templates, we could
call the live templates "masters" ? That's how they are called in Adobe
Indesign (which is probably the most polished layouting software around).

http://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/master-pages.html

The thing Indesign isn't not doing well IMO is overrides : it involves an
awkward keyboard shortcut and it's hard to know what exactly is overridden
and what's not (what element, and what part of the element).
The property system you're mentioning would probably be an excellent thing
to manage inheritance.

And then, there's a question about whether the masters are global or
per-project.
The problem with global masters is that you can have effects on other files
without knowing it, and also that projects may display differently on
different setups. I think we should only have per-project masters.
And updating a project's layouts only involves reimporting the main master
once (that may be a bit tricky though if we want to keep overrides, but
using composer's items UUIDs we may make it work for some simple cases).


Thanks a lot for those bigger refactoring initiatives !

Olivier

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry type conversion of 2.6

Hi,

I just wanted to write also to the list because of a similar issue, but  
here it happens when using processing.
I created a regular point grid over a polygon. As I just wanted to have  
the points inside the polygon and not the bounding box, I clipped it with  
the processing version of ftools clip.
The readOGR in my R script I wanted to use the points with then complained  
about the layer being multipoint. Multipart to single part fortunately did  
the trick.
The original ftools clip did deliver a normal point layer though.

Cheers
Bernd

I don't see what problem that solves.  It just moves the growth into a
different repository.

Werner decided to move exclusively to transifex, because the coordination of
which translations are maintained in our repository and which not, didn't
really work out (I think the spanish translation was considered to be kept in
our repository, although actually was maintained in transifex - hence the other
round of changes).

For me that actually is a backstep.   Before I could update qgis_de.ts,
translate in linguist, update TRANSLATORS and commit all of that in one commit.
Without the locations that are only actual translations.

Lately I also started to update qgis_en.ts in the process - as that's what
transifex tracks.  So that translator using transifex have a chance to keep up
(I think qgis_en.ts exists only for transifex).

Now I'd have to update qgis_en.ts, commit it, wait for transifex to pick it up
(didn't yet try - maybe that happens instantly), download qgis_de.ts to
translate with linguist, upload the result (or translate directly on the
transifex site) and the pull the ts back from transifex and commit that - or
wait for Werner's next transifex pull to have them appear in some future
nightly build.

Maybe we should just stop to keep the translations uptodate in our repository
and let the nightly builds pull automatically from transifex instead.

That way we always have the latest translations in the nightly builds and avoid
all the unnecessary changes in our repository.   And once shortly before
release all of them would be pulled into our repository just to get them into
the tarball.

And I would just need update and commit qgis_en.ts when I want to start
translating, commit it, translated it via transifex - and get it in the next
nightly build without more extra steps and noise in the repository.

Opinions?

Message-ID: <32C2B7B9FC548345980779B3F51F1A4233A69099@mailbox-san.poole.gov.uk>

Hi,

I've been trying to remove some functions from QGIS so we can deploy a stripped down version of it into a Citrix - XenApp 6.5 environment.

I've posted on the QGIS forum<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/120199/qgis-deployment-in-citrix-xenapp-how-to-remove-pyramids-from-the-image-proper> to see if anyone could help me with this set-up.

I need to remove the ability to build pyramids on QGIS when it is installed in XenApp (GIS team will use PC's to do rendering\pyramids overviews etc).  I can use the customization tool built in QGIS to remove the Menu options, however I need to remove the 'Properties' (or just the Pyramids) option from the context menu when you right click on an Image.

Here is an image of what I am trying to remove:

[cid:image001.png at 01CFFCFD.37FD8240]                         [cid:image004.jpg at 01CFFCFE.6F437BA0]

I need to prevent this option from being used on our XenApp environment due to the amount of memory it grabs.  If a user runs this on a highly loaded server it could cause outage for the other users on that server, if possible I'd like to configure GIS to avoid the option being used by mistake.

If it is not possible, that is fine.  This is my last point of call for support, any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Steve

Hi all.
I remember in previous versions of Processing it was possible to save commands and
models as Python scripts. Now I no longer see this option: am I missing something?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

maybe I'm wrong, but seems this feature was disabled/removed during
modeler overhaul. Don't know reasons, hope Victor can shed some light
on this.

Hi Steven,
Just a notion, and this is more of a ?last ditch attempt? than anything else, but I?m reasonably sure that the pyramids are created using GDAL?s gdaladdo.

So one possible option is to remove/rename gdaladdo.exe. In theory this would disable the functionality.

I can?t test it myself because local admin privs stop me. But it might be worth a try if you?re feeling bold. Not sure if it?ll affect anything else; gdaladdo only seems to do pyramids, so might be ok.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Yes, it was removed. Basically i didn't have time to reimplement it and it
had to be done again from scratch, because the model architecture changed
completely. Since there are many improvements with the new modeler, i
considered it worthwhile releasing it without this feature that i think is
not one of the most important ones (and actually was not even a finished
one, since not all models could be exported)

I hope to have it ready for a future version, though

Hi Olivier,

Regarding HTML editor:
I very briefly discussed this with Nyall (and got an offer to do it)). I 
proposed to embed a Javascript based HTML editor (like TinyMCE (LGPL)). 
However, Nyall is probably now busy with composer/report builder. So it 
would probably be ok, if someone else works on this. I would also like 
to see this HTML editor in a text area widget - so people could write 
rich text in an attribute form. Maybe there is also a qt-based rich text 
widget we could use?

Regarding live templates:
I was hoping for a global live template that I could link into many 
projects. Otherwise it wouldn't help me much. On the other hand I don't 
need the overrides (maybe only the map title). I would only put fixed 
content in the live templates that needs to be on every print out (like 
company logo, print date, disclaimer, contact information, etc.). 
However, maybe one day I would need the overrides - one never knows ;-)

Both gdaladdo and QGIS use GDALBuildOverviews[1] - IOW removing gdaladdo won't
help.

I just checked, there's a rich text example for Qt5 :
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtwidgets-richtext-textedit-example.html

I guess it's also doable with Qt4, since the QTextEdit widget already works
with HTML, but the provided examples are not exactly a wysiwyg editor.
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/examples-richtext.html

However, TinyMCE is also nice, especially since it allows to work easily on
the underlying HTML, so it's even useful for power users. I'd love to give
it a shot but I'm really not enough at ease with C++ to do more than
copy/paste some lines of code.


And about the live templates, the nice thing of overrides is for instance
when you have several thematic maps, and want the same layout for all those
(same map extent, same position of the legend, etc.). You can update all of
those at once. I don't know for you, but I have more than one layout in
almost all of my projects.
A good practice is to have a general master defining the very static
elements (company logo, guides for margins...) in all of your projects, and
several other masters dependent of every project that inherit the general
master (for instance one where you display a big map and a small overview,
one with two maps side by side, ...). This way, you can simply reimport
your company template in the general master, and have all your project's
layout update. Still, you're able to reopen old projects without having
them automatically modified.

The idea was indeed to reduce the height - and in many cases it helps a lot. Maybe we can just slightly change the way how the editing pencil is shown - for example to put it next to symbol preview icon (instead of drawing over it) - would that work for you?

Hi!

Sounds like a reasonable idea to me, if the translations will be in
nightly I've got no problem (and I also think that the translators
don't have any). For people compiling out of sources it shouldn't be
any problem to pull from transifex either and compile.
So if we (more or less) completely stop updating instantly in source
repository but rather only update directly in front of a release and
that helps keeping the code small - I am in.

But speaking from pulling in.. Maybe it is possible to integrate tx
pull of the translations directly in the make command? I don't know if
it's possible to check for internet connection or not but it would be
nice to automatically look for new translations right in front of a
compile run.

regards
Werner

Thanks Victor for clarifying. Should I open a ticket, not to forget about this, and
to better document the process?

If I update qgis_en.ts the usual way, there are now differences (e.g. &apos;
instead of ').  Looks like qgis_en.ts was pulled from transifex.  Is that
necessary for anything?  And how does transifex handle changes like that?

On second thought do we need a uptodate qgis_en.ts in our repository at all?
QGIS doesn't use it - it's only there for transifex to watch.

Instead of updating and commiting it in the source repository (and see lots of
otherwise useless changes) we could simply have update_ts_files.sh pull it from
transifex, update it with the latest source changes and push it back.

Hi J?rgen!

I am not sure what are you aiming at, but yes - we could do it that way too.
As long as QGIS does not use qgis_en.ts we could just tx pull it -
update it and tx push it back to transifex.
(And forget about it in the source tree). The same way we could do it
with all the translations.. pulling the right in front of a compile
run and forget about them afterwards and only commit them right in
front of a branching the release branch.
As I said - as long as translations can be considered to be in the
nightly build I am confident that people compiling QGIS on their own
can also pull translations before they build.
The only problem I see is when nightly is not updating translations
and people cannot see their translations (and possibly adjust it).
(This only because I sometimes got asked about updating the languages
in the source tree so that translators can see the work before it is
getting "released")
If I am getting you correct we could update the i18n directory only
once per release. Is this what you are aiming for?

kind regards
Werner

Hi all,
just a question. Why is the "case sensitive" checkbox automatically
toggled in the filter legend?
IMHO is quite confusing and should be toggled if one want to.

Cheers

The idea is precisely to avoid copy of native indexes.

With this example query, the virtual table implementation of tblA and
tblB will be called (xBestIndex) twice : once with and once without
constraints :
* X = ? on tblA
* Y = ? AND Z = ? on tblB

If you know there is a native index on tblA(X) then you will return a
cost for this constraint that is inferior to the cost needed without
constraint (a seq scan). The planner will decide what to do based on
these costs.

Some discussion here :
http://osdir.com/ml/sqlite-dev/2014-11/msg00003.html

For spatial indexes this is still possible (to avoid copy of native
indexes), but would require to introduce some new syntax to translate
the spatial predicate into regular comparison operators.

See here :
https://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users at sqlite.org/msg87191.html

... so for spatial indexes some additional SQL must be generated from
QGIS (but it is already the case if we want to avoid the spatialite
index syntax)

Ok.

It means the optimization part (accessing costs of the native indexes
for example, as discussed above) cannot be demonstrated yet with such an
external prototype, because it would require to modify providers'
interface in the core. But it does not prevent the plugin / library to
take them into account.

Hi all,
loading in the georeferencer a coloured jpg (clipped aerophoto) it is shown as black or fuzzy coloured image.
any known issue?

furthermore, as reported in other tickets (10018 and 10459), georeferencing an image it doesn't load in the main canvas when finished or any window opens to say "done". is it normal behaviour?

all the best,

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iLMknNwgwDBN7EnQda9jRwkCJgNpHkCMUYkyKkk-S5tFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

QGIS 2.6 has surely a lot of improvement on composer, but I find myself
stuck on a simple problem on composer legend manipulation. Instead of
showing from all the layers, I want to just show a specific layer. This is
a simple code that you can run in QGIS Python Console:

from qgis.core import QgsComposition, QgsLayerTreeGroup
> from PyQt4 import QtXml, QtCore

> canvas = iface.mapCanvas()

> template_file.close()
>
> document = QtXml.QDomDocument()

I have tried several possibilities to do that by going through the c++ code
itself. The 1st possibility above is working fine actually in python
console, but somehow it crashes QGIS implementing it in the plugin. The 2nd
and 3rd are giving no effect (It says the QgsLegendModel deprecated, but if
it's not working, shouldn't it say obsolete?). The method
setCustomlayerTree in the 4th unfortunately not available in the SIP. The
5th will delete layer in map canvas.

>From those 5 possibilities, is there any other way to do this simple task?

Hey,

into the Windows installers and binaries. The bug that Martin fixed just
after release that corrupted project files is a pretty nasty one that I
think could do with a patched 2.6.1 if we can.

Hi,

using the Identify button I can show the popup with the feature fields.

It is possibile to obtaing the geometry (i.e. in the format of WKT) of
that feature? I would add a link <a href> with the geometry of

Thank you in advance :-)

Hi,

Yes - QGIS Server can output the WKT geometry if you enable the checkbox

tab).

Hi Bernhard,
  I believe it's this conversation: http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-November/035492.html - and this ticket: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11592


-------

I think this is a good test of the maturity of the QGIS project; a release has been made which has a significant regression that means opening historical projects not only crashes QGIS in some instances (very bad), but can also *overwrite* and thus corrupt the project file resulting in data loss for the end user. If that doesn't warrant a timely emergency hotfix I don't know what does.
As it stands I'd be surprised if there isn't ongoing data-loss from early-adopters. :-(

Cheers,
Jonathan

I'm not sure about the final scheduling for the composer refactoring.
Following the discussions about LTS and QGIS 3.0 will it be shifted to 3.0?

OK, now I got it, thanks (I know, I should have RTFM first). After config, the viewer
seems to run fine. Apparently the setup creates an older version of the project (not
2.6).
BTW: any plans for a long term support of this interesting app? Wouldn't it be nice
to include it in QGIS master, to make it easily available to all QGIS users?
Ready to help with testing if necessary.
All the best, and thanks.

We need to solve a number of open issues with the legend - preferably in 
the next QGIS release. This concerns mainly the print composer legend, 
but perhaps the legend in the legend tree could be solved at the same 
time. At the same time we should also think how these improved legends 
could be exposed in QGIS server.

I am trying to list the things I would like to see improved:

1. Support for legends for graphical properties defined with map units. 
Currently these legends display in the print composer at very strange, 
unpredictable and unusable sizes. E.g. a stroke-width or dash defined in 
map units is either way too big or too small. Same for symbol sizes 
defined in map units. We need a way to translate these map units in 
usable paper units suitable for display in the legend. Let the map 
author define a corresponding mm size (along with the map units) - 
solely for the display of the legend.

2. Display of legends for graphical properties defined with data-defined 
symbology. We need a way to specify common graphical properties in the 
legend that are of interest in the legend. F.e. - if I define the colors 
data-defined I would like to be able to specify the expected colors that 
may appear in my data/project. This could be either done dynamically (by 
scanning the data) or statically (decided by the map author). Perhaps 
both methods. To me, the static method may be more predictable and more 
performant.

3. Legends for diagrams (pie charts, bar charts) - something similar to 
http://esri.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=087300000008Nki&feoid=Body&refid=0EM30000000Co0O 
- showing both sizes and colors - nicely stacked into each other.

4. Legends for labels - here we also have the same issue: how can we 
display a label legend where graphical properties are set based on 
data-defined values?

-------------------

I know this is not yet well specified - but I would like to open the 
discussion how we can solve the above issues. And I am looking for a 
QGIS developer who is interested in solving the above issues. If you are 
interested in developing above listed improvements, please join the 
discussion or contact me offlist.

Do you have ideas how to solve the issues with map units and 
data-defined symbology?

There is at least one other german organization (QGIS user) who is 
interested in this and would help finance this effort. Perhaps we can 
find more organizations who would help finance.

Thank you for joining the discussion,

Andreas

I correct myself regarding issue 1:

It is not unpredictable and even corresponds nicely with the scale - so 
map display and legend display are nicely in sync. But I think we need 
to be able to restrict legends where map units are involved to a certain 
min/max scale range. So the symbols don't get too big or too small and 
get into each others way.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.6 - Open postgis raster: decimal separator
	problem?
Message-ID: <54655411.6000702@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

I'm unable to open Postgis rasters using the default language setting, 
which is pt_PT.UTF-8 in my case. By overriding language settings, I can 
open Postgis rasters. Maybe something related with the decimal_point 
setting in LC_NUMERIC?

I didn't find any bug related with this issue. Can some else confirm 
this problem? Should I submit a bug?

How to reproduce the problem (if decimal_point == ',' and not '.'):

0) Download raster from https://bo5r0b.s.cld.pt or use your own raster

i) Insert raster in to Postgis
raster2pgsql -d -I -C -M -s 3763 001972Argb_12.tif -F -t 1000x1000 orto 
| psql -h localhost -U geobox -d orto

ii) Open QGIS with default language settings.
Add raster to QGIS using DB Manager

iii) The raster does not show properly. Raster properties are not 
extract/calculated correctly.

How to solve the problem:

i) Start QGIS overriding all language specific settings:

LC_ALL=C qgis

ii) The Postgis raster shows properly and all properties are loaded with 
correct values.

I'm using:
Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS

"PostgreSQL 9.3.5 on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 
4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2, 64-bit"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Groups in Layers panel
Message-ID: <54659FE7.1060906@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I'm dealing with quite a number of vector map tiles, and I have grouped 
many of them with a common theme.

What I'm finding pretty unworkable, is that when I want to set rendering 
style, I have to do it individually per map in that group, and likewise, 
when I want to Identify a feature within that group, I have to click 
through each map in that group in order to find which map in that group 
holds the feature I want to identify.

There are probably quite a few other actions that would be easier to 
work at a group level rather than a map level,
but:

Am I attacking this issue the wrong way, or is there a possibility that 
some of these actions can be processed by QGIS at a map-group level?

Regards to all,
Zoltan

But in this way you'll have a legend not representing the symbology that 
is represented in the map and i think this would be an error;
using map units you can however restrict the layer visibility according 
to the nominal scale of your data (or min/max scale).

my 2c, Roy.

If your data have a common theme i suppose they are all belonging to the 
same dataset so
maybe merging the data will solve the problem...

Dear list,

i'm georeferencing some rasters and the georeferencing process fails (in

this message:

  failed to compute GCP transform: Transform is not solvable

the georeferencing process works in linux using the very same data

is it only my system or should i open a bug report ?

Hi Roy,
I just did a quick one and it worked; Windows using the stand alone installed version, 64bit I think.

Which transformation are you using? I tested polynomial 1.

That said, if it's repeatable, it's probably worth reporting as a bug anyway; including the sample data and detailed info.

Cheers,
Jonathan

The problem is happening with "big" raster (5680 x 4848), i tested it on 
a smaller one and it worked;
even though the process is failing i get an output with only a quarter 
of the image processed ...
it fails with any kind of transformation ...
to test it must be used a 32bit install because possibly 64bit do not 
split the data during the transform process

it may be unrelated, but I recall a ticket about systems (Windows in
that case) were using the "," instead of "." for decimal separator
cause(d) issues at many levels. I can't find the ticket now and I
can't remember if the issue was fixed or not.

cheers!

Hi Andreas, 
we are now launching a contract that will add to QGIS size varying legend in
composer and mapcanvas legend, pretty similar to the one you show. It will
not solve the diagram color part, but adds a size varying legend below color
legend when it exists (and it doesn't for diagram now). 

It will also add label data defined widgets to all symbology options,
instead of a new dialog. 

It will also add an assistant GUI to help a user choose proportionnality
rules (min size, max size fetched from data or expression, flannery, surface
size or linear function..)

I hope we will make it for 2.8, I got delayed a lot on that (we talked about
it a while ago with Martin)

Unfortunately, we will not have in this contract this data defined legend
collect tool, except when using size varying assistant. I would have liked
to, but I think it deserves a QEP. 
I  would suggest a tool to collect asynchroneously existing symbols rendered
on the map extent, in a new tab of layer properties, where user can finalize
the legend by hand. Agreed with you, I would love an automatic tool, but I
can see how we could do that. 

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS custom widgets with python plugins
Message-ID: <96EAE7D042AAC14486D68EC70207B0C14AA70EBB@srsofaioi16255.verw.rootso.org>

Hi 

I sucessfully used QGIS custom widgets (eg. qgscollapsiblegroupbox) in qt designer in and then with python plugins with "uic.loadUiType()". Using the "traditional" pyuic approach I get an missing module error when starting QGIS:

ImportError: No module named qgscollapsiblegroupbox

I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 with an own compiled QGIS master. Do I have to put "libqgis_customwidgets.so.2.7.0" somewhere specific? Or is there anything else I have to do?

Regards

Hi,

 

I have a tool that allow to edit attribute of features (only one attribute):

1-      I select the feature by click on it: vectorLayer->getFeatures(
QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect( tSelectRect ).setFlags(
QgsFeatureRequest::ExactIntersect ))

2-      Modify the attribute

3-      Validate attribute change : vectorLayer->changeAttributeValue(
fId(), iField, newValue,oldValue );

 

The attribute change in attribute table but not on the label (layer is
labeled with the attribute) and in the identify result dialog.

 

I compile my plugin with libraries of Qgis 2.6 shipped with OSGeo4W.

 

Best regards

Nejia

Hi Paolo: I think this is due to the issue per
https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/issues/68 Solution and
workarounds discussed there. This has since been fixed in OWSLib
(0.8.10), MetaSearch (0.3.2) and QGIS master and 2.6 branch.

Are there any plans for a 2.6.1 release? Otherwise this would show up in 2.8.

I'd be in favour of 2.6.1.

I was just working on getting things packaged up to try and build a .rpm,
but when I run cmake now I get the following error:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:247 (INCLUDE):
  include could not find load file:

    cmake/modules/ECMQt4To5Porting.cmake

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Dave

The module should be there

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/qt5/cmake/modules/ECMQt4To5Porting.cmake

Don't know why it won't find it.

Dear List Members,

i've got in trouble creating new point feature in a shape file using 
python (QGIS 2.2 on Fedora):

feat = QgsFeature()
feat.setFields(lay.dataProvider().fields(), True)
feat.setAttribute(feat.fieldNameIndex('point_id'), xxx)

The fieldNameIndex call makes QGIS crash

How can I populate attributes of the new feature?

HI Siki

You need to keep the fields() array as a python entity for the duration of the existence of the feature...

that is

   feat=QgsFeature()
   fields=lay.dataProvider().fields()
   feat.setFields(fields,true)
   feat['point_id']=xxx


Think this should work...

Cheers
Chris

Dear List Members,

i found the solution to my problem in the QGIS API.
An internal Python vaiable must be created:

fields = lay.dataProvider().fields()
feat.setFields(fields, True)

hmm, strange

It basically tries to get the content from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing/master/models/list.txt,
but in your case it seems to be failing...

Any additional info you can provide about your system?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <E6100A0537F18549AC8FCCB5D47FFE35618195@EXMBX1.hrw-uk.local>

Hi,
I was wondering if there's been any progress with creating a 2.6.1 release to fix the crash-and-data-destroying bug (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11592)?
There have been a couple threads requesting it (http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-November/035516.html - http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-November/035629.html) - but I've not seen anything indicating this has happened.

If one isn't forthcoming then I'd suggest that the responsible thing to do is put a nice big scary warning up on the download page telling users there's a known issue that may destroy their work if the project trigger's specific conditions.

Cheers,
Jonathan

I need to iterate through all the categories in a layer's renderer. I've figured out how to get the value and the symbol info:

categories = layer.rendererV2().categories()
for cat in categories:
        print cat.value()
        print cat.symbol().color().name()

How do I find out which of the layer's fields is driving the categorization? In other words, how do I get the field which is compared against cat.value() in order to determine whether the category applies to a given feature?

This is for the qgis2leaf plugin. I need to read out all the categories and rewrite them in javascript which Leaflet can understand.

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Write custom c++ application using QGIS under
	windows
Message-ID: <1416250234359-5173377.post@n6.nabble.com>

Anyone was able to write qgis c++ application under Windows?

The problem that I am encountering is that header files such as
"<"qgsapplication.h">" cannot be found. I have installed qgis 2.6 and those
files actually do not exist.

What do I need to do in order to find these header files so I can do C++
programming under windows?

My .pro file can be found at the following stackoverflow post:

Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP179D3500D7AAB825566BE95A78B0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

i'm testing Lizmap web Client with value relation to map values
to be inserted in a point layer, with the edit tool values are
correctly displayed with a "drop-down" list, but the layer
popup only display the numerical key value used for the relation,
do i need to setup a custom popup or is this feature not supported ?

thanks,
Roy.

Hi Roy,

It's the way that QGIS-Server returns feature info.
I thought that QGIS 2.6 has corrected this issue.

You need to install the QGIS source in order to get the header files. 
See the "SOURCES" tab on http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html 
for how to get it.

+1. This will also address a MetaSearch issue which has since been fixed in master and 2.6 branch.

Just a note that if a 2.6.1 release is rolled out that there's a few
bug fixes which have been applied to master but not yet backported.
Specifically:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/5457d7299cfd517666ad34be44c9021d78c79488
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4254d4e615b913bb1350f8975c35849b5c1a8098

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f46e68363fff2bfcc0e64882ab2aac85e28e78e5

Would all be potential candidates for backporting.

Thanks for the reply.

So after that, I should just include the directory containing the header
files in .proj?

I tried to do this, however, i get the error in the following stackoverflow

Hi

We have funding under InaSAFE to support J?rgen's work to do a 2.6.1
release - I am just waiting to hear if he is OK to go ahead with the bug
fix release. We have a show stopper bug with legend API when building our
compositions that we would also like to see in the bugfix release.  We are
still figuring out how to characterise it with a simple test case and then
will provide more details. Nyall will you be able to backport those fixes
to 2.6 branch in the mean time?

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

I'm not comfortable backporting fixes which I didn't commit or for
code areas I'm not the maintainer of. I think this should be done by
either the original committer or the maintainer, in order to minimise
risk.

Actually - there's some which are no risk
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/5457d7299cfd517666ad34be44c9021d78c79488
, https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f3eeed904416a8ec010b4064cac8b797f72a0c15
, https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f46e68363fff2bfcc0e64882ab2aac85e28e78e5),
and one composer one
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4254d4e615b913bb1350f8975c35849b5c1a8098)
I'll backport later today.

I'll also add a fix for http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11655 (trivial).

Cheers,

I saw your post on this. And I actually used this .proj file. However, with
all of your include directory, the header files qgisapplication.h does not
exist in anyone of them. This is why I am confused about where it can be.

Hi,

I wrote a post about that:

http://3nids.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/build-and-deploy-c-qgis-app-on-windows/

I hope it helps

Denis

Le mardi 18 novembre 2014, eliu1234 <[hidden email]> a ?crit :
Thanks for the reply.

So after that, I should just include the directory containing the header
files in .proj?

I tried to do this, however, i get the error in the following stackoverflow
post:

Hi all.
Is the time ripe to create packages against Qt5? In case, it would be good to do it
now, so we have enough time to test both core and plugins. If this is done, I
volunteer to test some plugins.
All the best.

ahhh I don't think we have PyQt support yet for Qt5 do we?  If so it's
going to be a Python 3 version which might cause some issues.

Apparently yes.
PyQt provides bindings for Qt 4 and Qt 5:

Hi!

I am not quite sure but at least on debian it looks like that pyqt5 
packages are only available built against python3.
(correct me if I am wrong but I only found python3-pyqt5-* packages ..)

So I assume at least on debian a switch to qt5 would also mean a switch 
to python3 ..

kind regards
Werner

hmm - ah ok - debian testing ..
well .. that should become stable somewhere soon (but looking at the 
arguing about systemd I am not so sure about this)
funny that I don't have that specific package available in my install 
here ..
But well, this is LMDE .. probably thats a special case ..
thanks for pointing it out

Hi Paolo,

What is the reason for doing so?
Which platforms would you think require packages?

I think it would be useful to do some testing, so that we are free to switch once
things are running well (or we warn plugin devs, etc.).

I can test on Debian sid, but probably it would be useful if also a win package would
be available.

All the best, and thanks.

Dear list,

it would be useful/nice to have the possibility to load an image or document
associated with a feature using the Lizmap web client,  in edit session, 
is this feasible or beyond
the scope of the application?

thanks, Roy.

Hi Roy,

You can take a look at the lizmap-web-client github issues list.
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/issues

If you didn't see it you can create it.

Thanks.

Hi Ren?-Luc

i searched for this issue in QGIS bug but cannot find it,
do you know if it's actually an open request?
because if this does not works the realtion value is
basically useless...

thanks Roy.

Hi,

First you must download packages listed below from OSGeo4w ( http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html OSGeo4W Network Installer (32 or 64 bit)):
	- qgis: QGIS desktop
	- grass: GRASS GIS
	- qgis-devel
	- qt4-devel
	- qt4-doc
	- qt4-libs
	- qwt-devel-qt4
	- qwt-doc-qt
	- qwt-libs-qt4

In the post of Denis just replace:
@set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH%
@set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\include

With:
@set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin;%PATH%
@set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\include

(replace qgis-dev with qgis)

And if you want to build 64 bits applications with visual studio 2010 replace:
set VS90COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\ call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86

with:
call "%PF86%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 if exist "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" call "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /x64 /Release path %path%;%PF86%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin

set SETUPAPI_LIBRARY=%PF86%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib\x64\SetupAPI.Lib
if not exist "%SETUPAPI_LIBRARY%" set SETUPAPI_LIBRARY=%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib\x64\SetupAPI.lib

Cheers,
Nejia

I saw your post on this. And I actually used this .proj file. However, with all of your include directory, the header files qgisapplication.h does not exist in anyone of them. This is why I am confused about where it can be.

Re: Write custom c++ application using QGIS under windows Nov 17, 2014; 5:47pm ? by  3nids 3nids Hi,

Thanks for the reply.

So after that, I should just include the directory containing the header files in .proj?

I tried to do this, however, i get the error in the following stackoverflow

Hi,

Value relations work in QGIS server - if there are single values. If 
there are multiple values (array) it doesn't work yet.

You need either QGIS 2.6 or master.

Hi Andreas,

i'm using Lizmap web client release_2_10 and QGIS 2.6.0

i'm talking about Lizmap web client "info popup"
not displaying the relation "description" but
the numeric "code value" used for the relation mapping;

actually i don't know/uderstand if the problem is
in the client or server side; not claiming that the server is  not working
nor the client ...

thanks,
Roy.

Message-ID: <bce8a5fb7401a01a9680be0b9221873d@carto.net>

Hi,

I am having a lot of troubles with large raster files and processing.

The intermediate results can go >4GB. Processing stops with not so 
helpful error messages.

I wonder if processing is hitting the 4GB limit. Can I force processing 
to use the BIGTIFF option or a raster format that can handle >4GB files?

Thank you,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Continuous Integration / Testing with TravisCI
Message-ID: <546B5D1C.5010800@gmx.ch>

Hi all,

You may have noticed that there is a new symbol on the qgis github page
that (hopefully) says build passing. [1]

The last week I have been busy with fixing tests for integration with
Travis CI.

Right now, whenever somebody pushes a change to
 * a branch in the qgis repository (that affects "master" and
release-x_y branches)
 * a pull request for the qgis repository
a service called Travis CI [2] will be activated and compile the
sourcecode and run the test suite there. That has the advantage that we
have a reference platform (ubuntu precise for the moment) where all
tests pass. This defined environment is a big step forward as it makes
test runs comparable and if something goes wrong we know that code is
responsible and not some other variable.
Currently all tests (with a few exceptions which are disabled) are
passing. And it would be excellent if it stays like that!

What does that mean for developers?

**Use pull requests**
Whenever you open a pull request first you get the chance to test your
changes without making the nice green symbol on the front page go red.
You can push to these pull requests until the tests go green. For
reviewers this is also nice: you don't need to spend time on pull
requests that don't build or don't pass tests.

**Write tests**
If you implement a new feature or fix a bug, write a test for it. If
somebody breaks the test, the pull request or the symbol on the github
project page will turn red. This means that it's clear which commit
broke the test. But the test is your feature or your bugfix!

**Try to avoid rendering tests**
A big portion of fixing has been spent on rendering tests. The problem
with rendering tests is, that a lot of them have slight inconsistencies
across systems. Gradients, anti aliasing, fonts... This all may render
differently without being really a problem. But it produces a (false)
alarm on another system and one needs to take measures. There are such
measures: defining color intolerance, allowed pixel mismatches, known
anomalies, since last week also different reference pictures... But in
the end this means extra work and false alarms once in a while. We do
create a software that has visual products. Therefore rendering tests
are required. But think very about different possibilities before
writing such a test. Maybe you can extract the WKT from a geometry and
compare that against a known WKT string instead? That is less brittle,
faster to test and much easier to maintain than a rendering test!
If you really need to write a rendering test it is likely that it will
fail on travis in the beginning. To make it pass on travis, create a
pull request and wait for it to be tested. The results will be uploaded
to the OTB CDash [3] where you get information what exactly you need to
adjust. How many pixels failed? Visual comparison if adjusting the color
tolerance a bit may help. Is an anomaly ok? Is there a need to add
another reference picture?

**C++ vs. Python tests**
I made an earlier call for having only either one or the other. That was
based on misinterpretation of test results from my side. Sorry.
My current opinion is: do what you feel comfortable with. If you prefer
to write C++ tests, do so. If you prefer to write Python tests, do so.
If you want both, do so. The important thing is: DO IT!
If you really need advice: go for python tests, they test the same
functionality like C++ functions but also test the python API and
therefore cover a slightly bigger area.

Which tests are not fixed (on the reference platform)?

 * The atlas tests had interdependencies, that made some tests pass just
because the environment was ok from previous ones. These tests are now
changed to be independent one of another. And there is a PR that should
fix the issues and re-enable the test. [4]
 * The symbology tests fail due to problems with sld loading. There is a
pull request that partly reverts a commit that broke things and
re-enables the test. [5]
 * The server pal labeling tests produced very different rendering
results. I could imagine that they would be better off if the would also
use the QGIS test font? New reference images could also be introduced.
Dakota cartography's call.
 * The server canvas labeling tests crash on exit because of a
not-yet-ended thread. Multithreading issue? Something else?
 * Recently the WCS test started to fail. I guess the server it uses to
test does not always respond? We should either fix the server, disable
the test, increase the timeout...

Where to go from here?

There are two things I would like to see:

  Many more tests :)
  More platforms: Travis can also handle mac. We could ask them to
enable mac testing for us. But we'd first need to fix the tests there.
There is a service called appveyor that runs tests for windows. But we'd
first need to fix the tests there.

I am very happy that there was such a great interest in the crowdfunding
campaign that made it possible to do that work. THANK YOU to everybody
who helped to get the testing integration to the next level.

Matthias

?Brilliant stuff Matthias! Now we need to agree to 'no new code without
tests' as a formal requirement and we will be a long way down the road
towards a more stable QGIS.

RHEL 6 has Qt 4.6 and so in order to build anything from the 2.x series it
has to be built against Qt 5.

Matthias,

Great move from yours !

I can point you to an email I sent to the mapguide folks recently, sharing my 
experience with C.I. tools for GDAL. See the end of 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapguide-internals/2014-August/007518.html

I'm skeptical you'll manage to build QGIS with (the free program of) AppVeyor, 
since GDAL reaches their build time limit.

Regarding comparing images, MapServer used to use the 'perceptualdiff' utility 
that can accept some, invisible to the eye, differences between the reference 
image and the image produced. But this may be sometimes still be a bit 
oversensitive. Definitely a tricky subject to have rendering tests running 
consistently accross platforms.
You mention comparing WKT, but that can be non obvious too since there might 
be different rounding accross platforms. Better to have a dedicated geometry 
comparison method that accept an epsilon when doing vertex comparisons.

Definitely an interesting read. Good to know that ther's a short timeout
with appveyor and alternatives, although mingw/wine solutions appear to
be a workaround. I wonder if there is a problem with appveyor, maybe
there is somebody in need of stable windows build who could sponsor this.

I had a short look at that last week and found that in the end you still
need to define a number of allowed mismatch pixels for some font images
I compared. But maybe one could tweak the parameters.
Concerning WKT you are right of course (thinking of ARM where qReal is
interpreted as float vs. double on other platforms). Something like this
for vertex comparisons could be good:

Great work Matthias ! Really good to see QGIS starting to keep up on the 
quality and industrialization side !

I second Tim on the mandatory tests with features, time to strengthen the 
rules for even more quality.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPC8y4u+UvguG6iBBWH64N4Tan6yFkcwUAR+S051379L0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all and sorry for cross-posting,

you may have know that we have a GitHub repo with user-contributed scripts
and models for Processing [0] and Processing itself provides easy way to
download them for further use.

This scripts/models may contain bugs or one may want to submit feature request.
Unfortunately right now there is no central place for this. So we have
two options
here:
 1. create special category in QGIS bugtracker
 2. use GitHub bugtracker

Another thing, as this scripts and models (well, the biggest part of
them) actually
contributed by users, core developers are not responsible to their
bugs. But users often think that if they use script/model in QGIS that
this is QGIS bug and complain. Maybe we should add a
warning/explanation to download dialog?

Opinions?

Hi Roy,

It is the responsibility of QGIS server to deliver the correct human 
readable value instead of the code.

So make sure that QGIS server supports that. It works fine on my server.

I think this would be a good move, so customers are warned they have to pay also for
the test. It will be difficult to implement for the works now in progress though.
IMHO it wouold be important also to clarify how to define a function, and how
extensive a test should be.
Definitely another step towards maturity.
All the best, and thanks.

It does, and great work !

TravisCI is nice for the gihub integration, but for larger coverage it
would be very nice to get the osgeo buildbot back [2], and ask users to
setup bots for their preferred platform:

 http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/1214

Hint: Buildbot is in python, which should be familiar to the QGIS
      developers :)

so do i need to recompile QGIS to activate this feature?
i searched for documentation but i cannot find anything relevant.

What i understand is that the configuration file for QGIS server is
the one saved with QGIS desktop...
maybe i need to edit this file to add more config parameter ?
also i cannot find documentation about those (if they exists) parameters 
configuration...

thanks,

Roy.

Matthias,

At camptocamp we often use Travis CI and Coverall: https://coveralls.io/ which 
give statistic on test coveralls.

Is it worth to add it?

You can choose the "up to bottom stop the first" mode in identify.

I can confirm that there was such bug in gdal/ogr but it shoud be closed in 
recent release.

I have a mail in my archive explaining this sent by Even rouault in gdal-dev 
list the 22/10/2013.

You can also (with 2.6) right click with the identify tool to get a popup
menu with features from all intersecting layers.

I'd love to see something like this. Another nice extension of this
work could be to add a test for documentation coverage. We could
utilise https://github.com/alobbs/doxy-coverage , and keep raising the
threshold required for the test until we get a nice coverage of
doxygen comments.

Thanks, Yves.

I found the thread in gdal-dev from almost a year ago (Oct. 2013).
This is fixed now:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5731 but only for gdal 2.0. I was 
hoping to see this fixed in gdal 1.11.

Thanks in advance,

J. Gustavo

Thanks so much for the answer. I am able to get the 32 bit version working.
Right now, I am facing the problem of not able to run debug mode. Since all
those xxxxxd.lib files does not exist with the OSGeo4W installation. Do you
have any idea how to fix this?

And right now, I cannot seem to print anything in this mode. I tried to use
cout but my output line is not printed. I tried to setup using visual
studio. But is unsure how to include these dll files without their
corresponding library files. Do you have any idea on this?

Thanks.

Hi, 

First you must download packages listed below from OSGeo4w (
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html OSGeo4W Network Installer (32
or 64 bit)): 
        - qgis: QGIS desktop 
        - grass: GRASS GIS 
        - qgis-devel 
        - qt4-devel 
        - qt4-doc 
        - qt4-libs 
        - qwt-devel-qt4 
        - qwt-doc-qt 
        - qwt-libs-qt4 

In the post of Denis just replace: 
@set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH% 
@set
INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\include 

With: 
@set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin;%PATH% 
@set
INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\include 

(replace qgis-dev with qgis) 

And if you want to build 64 bits applications with visual studio 2010
replace: 
set VS90COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
9.0\Common7\Tools\ call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86 

with: 
call "%PF86%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 if exist
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" call
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /x64 /Release
path %path%;%PF86%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin 

set SETUPAPI_LIBRARY=%PF86%\Microsoft
SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib\x64\SetupAPI.Lib 
if not exist "%SETUPAPI_LIBRARY%" set
SETUPAPI_LIBRARY=%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft
SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib\x64\SetupAPI.lib 

Cheers, 
Nejia

hi eliu1234,
The *.lib of QGIS should be created by compile. For the Qt's lib , e.g *d.lib. The qwt should download  from OSGeo4W,  so the qwt5.lib should found in OSGeo4W. The rest qt related packages should just install a Qt   from http://qt-project.org/, when compiling API using cmake, it can automatically check the QT you installed before.  Remember, the minimum version of QT QGIS-2X need is 4.7.0. hope this help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with developing custom c++ qgis
 application with QtCreator and MSVC2008 on Windows
Message-ID: <1416379317120-5173711.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am using qtcreator and msvc2008 for developing the c++ custom application.

I followed the following tutorial to setup the system:
http://3nids.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/build-and-deploy-c-qgis-app-on-windows/

Problem 1: under debug mode, I cannot create a QgsMapCanvas object. It
always exit with code 1.

Problem 2: under release mode, I tried to create a raster layer with the
following command:
QgsRasterLayer * layer = new
QgsRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster");
It always result in a layer which is invalid. I tried the python equivalent
command: layer =
QgsRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster");
in qgis python console and it works fine.

Any help is appreciated.

Hi,

1- QGIS and Qt libraries shipped with Osgeo4W are compiled using release
mode so if you want to debug your application you can use RelWithDebInfo
mode.
2- see:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/120823/how-to-load-a-wms-layer-using-
pyqgis
http://ieqgis.wordpress.com/2014/08/09/adding-esris-online-world-imagery-dat

Hi,

I tried various tools, e.g.

* SAGA reclassify
* GRASS r.mapcalc

Both work fine on smaller data sets, but fail on big data sets.

This is on Win7 64bit, with the OSGeo4W installer. I have 8gb RAM and 
40GB disk free on C:, more free space on other disks where the data 
resides.

I am not totally sure if it is the Bigtiff issue or some other issue. It 
is just a guess that maybe I am hitting a limit with tiff. It is not 
fully transparent to me what Processing is doing in the background (what 
file formats with what options it creates).

It may also be an issue with SAGA or GRASS directly.

Thanks if you know anything,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,
I also had problems to reclassify BIGTIFF with SAGA and GRASS!
Finally I used GDAL!

Hi Carlos,

GDAL would be my first choice - because it easy to automate. However, I 
don't know how can do my task with GDAL.

 From my grayscale tiff images I want to replace one pixel value (249) 
with white (255). All other pixels should stay at the value they have.

I came across https://github.com/chiatt/gdal_reclassify - but this 
reclassifies all pixels, not only selected ones.

Maybe I could use http://www.gdal.org/gdal_calc.html with a conditional 
syntax?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andreas, do you need to change the value of one specific pixel only? I
mean the pixel at [x,y] index?

Hi Andreas,

you can surely try to import the raster directly into GRASS in a 64bit 
linux,
very often this overcome memory issues, and use mapcalc sintiax,
something like:

reclassed_raster = if(original_raster == 249,255,original_raster)

regards,

Roy.

Hi Giovanni,

I need to change all pixels that have the value of 249 to a value of 
255. All other pixels should stay at their value.

Hi Andreas,

Yes, you can use gdal_calc.py
Certainly you need to perform several processes, but are very fast!

Be careful with bands!
Perhaps you will want to separate them.

And do you have problems with GRASS (directly, not through Processing)?
In GRASS7 you can even drectly write to Geotiff without passing through the
internal format (http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/r.external.out.html
).
If GDAL is built with bigtiff support there souldn't be problems...

Hi,

I will have to do further testing about GRASS. On Windows (OSGeo4W 
install) it does not work too well. It probably works better on Linux.

The gdal_calc.py solution works very fast though - glad that we came to 
this solution!

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OcK5Gc5W9ZYPFwFmKCqmGsNwGOxxrqRnHL56xTEim=Ugg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

building QGIS 2.6 on MS Windows fails (qgis_core) with

Generating flex_qgsexpressionlexer.cpp
"C:/OSGeo4W_qgis_vfk/usr/src/qgis_2_6/src/core/qgsexpressionlexer.ll",
line 22: unrecognized %option: reentrant
"C:/OSGeo4W_qgis_vfk/usr/src/qgis_2_6/src/core/qgsexpressionlexer.ll",
line 24: unrecognized %option: bison-bridge
Project : error PRJ0019: A tool returned an error code from
"Generating flex_qgsexpressionlexer.cpp"

No problem with QGIS 2.4 or 2.2. Any idea what could be wrong?

Thanks, Martin

Nice to know that gdal_calc works fine ;)
I work a lot with gdal + numpy, even for custom tools, and I admit they
work very well together!

Why so? It shouldn't, at lest not grass64.
IMHO dealing with very large rasters is one of the strengths of the good old grass.
Also OTB way of handling large files is very interesting.
All the best.

Hi,

I was able to do my color replacements with gdal_calc.py. It works fast 
and efficient.

Here is my syntax:

gdal_calc.py -A image.tif --outfile=image_output.tif 
--calc="(A==249)*255+(A!=249)*A"

Syntax looks similar to the QGIS raster calculator - but as opposed to 
the QGIS raster calculator it actually works!

I will still continue to find out about SAGA. Maybe directly converting 
from TIFF to SAGA before processing files in SAGA.

I believe that the QGIS raster calculator would need some developer love 
- to make it more robust and easier to use ;-)

I am also pretty sure that the Processing integration of GRASS/SAGA does 
not work well with big files - at least on Windows and when TIFF files 
are used.

Thanks to all who helped!
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OGR VRT and SrcSQL
Message-ID: <546C9A57.20800@camptocamp.com>


I am working with OGR VRT files in QGIS.

When I use the "SrcLayer" tag, all works correctly.
But when I use "SrcSQL" tag, QGIS seems to load the file correctly, but 
nothing appears in the canvas.

exemple:
<OGRVRTDataSource>
     <OGRVRTLayer name="test_shp_sql">
         <SrcDataSource relativeToVRT="1">test.shp</SrcDataSource>
         <SrcSQL dialect="sqlite">SELECT * FROM test</SrcSQL>
     </OGRVRTLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>

all attributes are correctly displayed in the attribute table.
when I use Save As ... to another shapefile, the new file display correctly.
"ogrinfo -la" gives me exactly the same results for "SrcLayer" and 
"SrcSQL" tags.
I've also tried the getWKT plugin which give me the same result for 
features from the two layers.

I do not understand what  goes wrong : OGR or QGIS ?

dir (this happens especially often with Processing) masking the system one.
IMHO the behaiviour is correct, but the user should be warned (e.g. "You are using an
older version of a plugin, a new one is available on your system: do you want to
remove the old one?").
Opinions? Should I open a ticket?
All the best.

1. So in the .proj file, what do i need to change?

2. My Python works in this case, it is the C++ part that is not working.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Viewport rotation
Message-ID: <20141119204632.GC21622@localhost>

Hi all,
I'm looking at implementing viewport rotation support and wondering if
anyone has already an idea about what it would take.

Could adding support in QgsMapToPixel be possibly enough to make
navigation tools aware of rotation ? Or would it be better to plug
another transformation in between, as if it was a reprojection ?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Sandro,

How are you thinking of implementing this? In the map canvas only?
Ideally, I think this should be supported in the map renderer -
QgsMapRendererJob.

Currently the composer supports rotated maps, but it's a bit of a
hack. It's really just rendering the map and then rotating the result.
As a result all labels, symbology, etc also get rotated, which isn't
ideal. If support for rotating maps was added to the actual map
renderer then the composer would also benefit, as we'd be able to
properly rotate the map without messing up labels and symbology.

Hi Martin,

I think I ran into this recently. There was a commit in 2.6 [0] that
apparently requires a newer version of flex or bison (bison 3.x, I think?)
than is available with the GnuWin32 project as noted in INSTALL [1].
Instead I used the precompiled binaries available from the 'Win flex-bison'
project [2] and specified the CMake paths:

-D BISON_EXECUTABLE=C:/path/to/win_flex_bison-latest/win_bison \
-D FLEX_EXECUTABLE=C:/path/to/win_flex_bison-latest/win_flex

Looks like the CMake find modules need updated to look for those binaries.
I suppose you could also build the latest packages yourself.

I don't know yet, that's why I'm asking.

Would that be similar to considering it an additional transformation
on the input data, like reprojection ?

Yep, makes sense. I'll try to understand what it takes.
Thanks for the pointers so far.

Message-ID: <546DE795.8020600@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
If one has a pg table with records with a missing geometry (e.g. there are records
with a geom in a point column, others in a line column, others with both), the table
will show only the records with a geom; if I click on Show all, I also get records
without a geom. Of course, selecting a record like this and clicking on Zoom to
selected does nothing.
I'm unsure this is the least confusing behaviour for the user: opinions?
All the best.

Hi,

I wasn't aware of this. Although I do not understand why one should put 
points and lines in the _same_ table, geometries are allowed to be NULL 
if the field does not have a NOT NULL constraint. I see two possible 
solutions
1) mark the dataset as having no geometry
2) (preferred) do only load datasets which have a geometry

reasoning: As one can load any relation geometryless I would assume when 
loading the relation _with geometries_ there are geometries contained.

I am aware that solution 2) can be achieved with the user applying a 
filter like <code>"geom_column" IS NOT NULL</code> to the layer but 
that's for advanced users only

Bernhard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pic2map plugin crashes qgis at installation
Message-ID: <2007866615.491044.1416489993830.JavaMail.tomcat@http1romandie.alinto.net>

Hello,

A special plugin (pic2map in the repository https://documents.epfl.ch/ groups/l/la/lasig-unit/www/ pic2map/lasigRepository.xml <https://documents.epfl.ch/groups/l/la/lasig-unit/www/pic2map/lasigRepository.xml>) failed to install on some machines (not experienced by me but as feedback from tester). Traceback below.

If you want to test, you need the pyopengl bindings:
apt-get install python python-opengl python-qt4 python-qt4-gl

I've test personnly on several machine and cannot say if the crash is reproductable.

Someone has any hints of path ?

Hi,

it seems that QGIS Server doesn't permit to identify features from
external WMS sources.

If I use QGIS Desktop, I can do identify; in QGIS Web Client, I cannot do that.

It's a known bug?

I've tried this approach, basically adding rotation support to
the QgsMapToPixel class. With such support I can see the map
rotated as requested while "horizontal" labels remain horizontal.
But "parallel" labels are completely off (and pretty funny).

For "parallel" labels, it is actually good that they rotate with the map.
I guess there would need to be some rotation knowledge at various levels
for things to be flexible enough.

Yes, for map rotation to work properly, its delta would have to be passed
into the calculations for each type of labeling placement, to provide
'expected' results. Such a delta would have to include not only the
rotation but also the new location of the label's point of reference.

Towards that end, I would say the most straightforward means of
implementing map rotation for effective labeling is to pre-rotate the
duplicated, temporary feature geometries first, before they are acted upon,
i.e. before extent (view port) clipping, etc., which would be prior to
sending into the PAL library for processing. Such an approach should keep
from having to pass the rotation offsets into the labeling calculations,
since the rotated features would already be in their output juxtaposition.

Maybe the feature pre-rotation could be done in the map renderer, prior to
sending to the labeling engine.

Regards,

Larry

Do you have a system setup that can write qgis c++ application? If you do,
can you create a valid raster layer from that?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How does QGIS display vrts where the underlying
	imagery has overviews?
Message-ID: <CADXYQQ5B87_YGsMt3qUHP+c19k7C-XgbCGvjZip1aRt8PiNQpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been really impressed with how QGIS can quickly display a vrt of
say, a bunch of tifs, when the underlying tifs have overviews already
created.  I was curious how it is going about accessing the overviews of
the underlying imagery, as the gdal api doesn't seem to think the vrt has
overviews or subdatasets, and QGIS itself doesn't mention the vrt having
overviews.

Can anyone illuminate this for me?

Thanks!
-Patrick

I use the same environment of Qgis to write c++ plugins:
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc14

to add raster layer:
m_ptInterface->addRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster");

Right, that was my idea of threating it like a reprojection.

That's possibly what I've done by implementing rotation in QgsMapToPixel,
as I do see features and label positions all correctly rotated. Only,
the PAL view on the source layer seems to be still the original one, as 
in "parallel" mode those labels are NOT parallel to the rotated but to
the original lines (I think, not really sure).

If you want to take a look, I pushed a branch here:
https://github.com/strk/qgis/tree/rotation

I think next I'll work on a widget to make it easy to specify rotation
in the GUI so further tests are easier to conduct.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS master compiles against Qt5
Message-ID: <546F1B74.50706@gmx.ch>

Hi,

Qt5 support has just been merged to master (78c5195)

This should not make any difference if you want to compile and link
against Qt4.

If you want to have a QGIS version that makes use of Qt5, please not that

  * You need to have the dependencies also linked against Qt5. You most
likely will not find that prebuilt and will need to do it yourself.
Segfaults of crssync when compiling indicate that there are dependencies
linked against Qt4.

  * In particular, check the following libraries:
    * QScintilla2
    * QWT
    * QWTPolar

  * Python bindings are completely untested (Both, PyQt4 and PyQt5)

  * The class QgsHttpTransaction is no longer supported.

Have fun
Matthias

Hi Andreas,

> It may also be an issue with SAGA or GRASS directly.

I have also tested a very large raster (8gb) and SAGA seems to choke
also when used natively from the cli interface.

grass of course does the job, especially when you use the grass data
model from the cli, native grass gui or qgis plugin. Inside processing
large raster suffer from the overhead that is needed to import/export
the raster to, and out of, a temp location.

gdal does the reclass job very quickly and I should be able to add the
tool to processing.

I agree anyway that it too bad that the qgis raster calculator (and
georeferencer) are drawing so little attention. Maybe there isn't much
people that uses them?

cheers!

AFAIK Processing does not import the raster, but uses it as an external data source
(if not, it should).

quite possible; however, maintaining multiple calcs seems more of a burden than an
advantage.

I'm kind of stuck in QgsMapToPixel as that class currently has no
knowledge of map "center". It has both min and max values for the Y
direction but for X it only has min value. 

There is also no "viewport size" to compute xMax from, so basically
I'm still missing the center of the map, which is what I would
have liked to use as anchor point for rotation.

Should I refactor the class to additionally hold a center, or an xMax ?

Hey my name is Robert. I'm using windows 7 on 64 bit and using Qgis 
2.6.0.
Hey i'm trying to process some Tifs from the console using the 
processing toolbox and saga:slopeaspectcurvature.
this is pretty much how my code looks like:

##vectorlayer=raster
import glob
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.core import *
import qgis.utils
import os
from osgeo import gdal
import numpy as np
import osr
import math
import processing
import PIL.Image as Image
import sys
sys.path.append('C:/newpython64/Lib/site-packages')
from libtiff import TIFF


output=processing.runalg("saga:slopeaspectcurvature",vectorlayer, 
1,'E:/Master/slope/asdsa.tif',None, None, None, None)


the result is a map. But the range for slope is between 0 and 1. if i 
execute slope from the toolbox, then i get a perfectly normal range with 
values. the intensities are identical( every pixel has the same colour 
in one slope image as in the other), but the values are totally 
different. This is independent of what kind of method i use from the 
"saga:slopeaspectcurvature". Am i running the code wrong? If im running 
the code wrong, i would appretiate if you would give me some guidance.
Thank you very much!


Best
Robert

yes you are right, it uses r.external.

yes I understand, but we have a clear issue. The qgis raster calc is
broken and when it works it need a very cumbersome logic (especially
for common tasks like reclassifying). GRASS r.reclass works fine, but
it does not allow to enter interactively the reclass rules (that can
be an advantage in some situations, but usually for quick
reclassifications is not), so adding gdal raster calc seems anyway a
good idea.

cheers!

sorry I was unclear: I meant I do not see the point in maintaining a qgis raster
calc, given the problems you refer, and the availability of several alternatives
(also the saga one).
I agree that adding gdal raster calc is a plus, especially because it requires
minimal effort compared to fixing and maintaining qgis one.
All the best.

Message-ID: <547278C3.2010404@mondot.fr>

Hi all,

I have a plugin using a customized version of Dockable Mirror Map.
I use it to display each processing result in a new view.

I get a strange behaviour with my plugin :
Some times, the canvas stays white. A scroll in it is fine to reload it 
and my image is displayed.
I get this problem since the beginning of the development on QIGS 2.2. 
It is for me a "random" problem, because I can't say why I get these 
white canvas. But, when I get it I save the projet with the white view, 
and when reloaded, the canvas is still white.

I've played with canvas.refresh(), canvas renderer flags and even with 
canvas.freeze().
I can't understand the behaviour I get, maybe I have a wrong usage of 
the properties above.
I also thought about triggerRepaint()...

Thanks by advance,
Alexia

Hi,

next friday four weeks after the release have passed.   Preponing the release
plan starting with 2.8 (see not yet adopted QEP #3) this would be a time for a
point release (as there wasn't a week without backports before) - although the
nightly builds of the release are not yet inplace.

Please check if all your fixes that apply to 2.6 are applied to the release
before Friday 1200 UTC.

Message-ID: <CAB28AshsNo_o16PoR_7F2Fwm7tb=Ry1pMFkxrZUiXxNfyO1Oqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've created a QEP (in very early draft stage) for a system for
overridable property collections for QGIS:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/12

This need is being driven by both labelling and layout work, and
should pave the way for features like text styles and layout master
templates.

I'm after feedback/discussion on whether the proposed implementation
would work or if there's a better way to implement this.

Nyall

But I am still getting the same error. Rather that updating CMake file

Hi,

I encountered the same problem while building QGIS 2.6 from sources, to fix
it I use flex and bison from http://cygwin.com

flex NEWS says "Support for reentrant C scanners has been added" for 2.5.6

I use flex from cygwin on Windows.

We don't include all build tools in OSGeo4W anyway.  I updated INSTALL to point
out the required version and added links to cygwin instead.

QgisInterface  is an abstract class. How are you initializing it? Or do you
just declare it and add a raster layer directly? Because from that link, I
see the addRasterLayer method is a pure virtual function.

QgisInterface  is an abstract class. How are you initializing it? Or do you
just declare it and add a raster layer directly? Because from that link, I
see the addRasterLayer method is a pure virtual function and QgisInterface
is abstract class. I want to add this layer into a QgsMapCanvas, how should
I do that?

Also, is it possible for you to test my code before to see if it works on
your system? 
QgsRasterLayer * rlayer = new
QgsRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster");
qDebug() << rlayer->isValid();

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Viewport rotation status report
Message-ID: <20141124165607.GA9238@localhost>

I've just pushed new code to the "rotation" branch in my fork [1]
that makes panning and zooming supported at the MapToPixel level.

The MapToPixel class is used by the renderer to transform inputs
to output coordinate space, right after performing geographical
projection transformations.

Rendering wise, the rotation doesn't seem to give nice results.
Arrow decorations and labels are "flattened", and "parallel" labels
are parallel to the original (non-rotated) lines.

[1] https://github.com/strk/qgis/tree/rotation

I suspect there's some redundancy I'm missing out, whereas local classes
have local view on what the canvas extent or scale is. For example I saw
QgsMapRenderer has mExtent and mMapUnitsPerPixel members but also
a mRendererContext which can provide a MapToPixel object having another
copy of that information (extent and scale).

What are these duplications for ? Could we get rid of them to have a
unified configuration for coordinate transforms ?

I understand that you don't have a use case that reproduce the problem!
Can you explain better what the meaning of "customized version of
Dockable Mirror Map"?

May you file an issue for the plugin with all data displayed in
help-about of qgis?

Just an idea, may you also test if this append with multithread
rendering disabled?

Thanks for your answer.

Actually, I wonder if my refresh problem is not only on QGIS 2.2. I 
believe I had not reproduce this behaviour on QGIS 2.4 and 2.6. And I 
didn't know about the bug.
I have these two points to analyse.

The multithread rendering was available in QGIS 2.2 ??

I'm going to work on the two previous points.

Thanks again,
Alexia

To write QGIS C++ plugin see : http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/doc/manual/qgis-1.1.0_coding-compilation_guide_en.pdf (2.2 Programming a QGIS C++ Plugin in four steps)
And you can find some C++ plugin examples here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples and https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Code-Examples/tree/master/4_adding_rasters_to_canvas

QgisInterface  is an abstract class. How are you initializing it? Or do you just declare it and add a raster layer directly? Because from that link, I see the addRasterLayer method is a pure virtual function and QgisInterface is abstract class. I want to add this layer into a QgsMapCanvas, how should I do that?

Also, is it possible for you to test my code before to see if it works on your system? 
QgsRasterLayer * rlayer = new
QgsRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster");
qDebug() << rlayer->isValid();

Hi Stefan,

To properly compile the UI file using pyuic4, you need to have the uic 
widget plugin installed.

This is the file qgis_customwidgets.py that should be located in 
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/

This file can be either installed by the package python-qgis-common or 
using -WITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS=TRUE if you compile your own QGIS (I suppose 
this requires a make install).

Let me know if this helps.

Best wishes,

Denis

If you install QGIS to custom path, you should set some environment 
variables before calling pyuic4

exemple:

export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=~/apps/qgis-master
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/share/qgis/python/:$PYTHONPATH

Personnally, I've added one line in
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/qgis_customwidgets.py

pluginType = MODULE
def moduleInformation():
     try:
         import qgis.gui
         return "qgis.gui", dir(qgis.gui)
     except ImportError:
*print "impossible to import qgis.gui"*
         return "", []

to detect import error

Hi
In QGIS versions before 2.6 , I could right click and show a custom "popup
menu" from the QgsMapCanvas, but not anymore. Its like something is
consuming the right click event on the QgsMapCanvas.
Do anyone know anything about this?
How can I get a right click event from the QgsMapCanvas again?

I have connected a slot to the customContextMenuRequested signal of the
QWidget where on my QgsMapCanvas instance is displaying. In versions before
2.6 i could display my custom menu on a right click on the QgsMapCanvas,
but not anymore. :-(

Hi Alexander,

As an author of some scripts, I think this feature is a great opportunities
to easily share useful snippets. I am not sure though we made enough
publicity around it. I fear only "power users" will have the idea to open
the branches of processing toolbox and discover there is a Scripts / Tools
/ Get scripts from collection. I have no idea though how to improve this.

I would prefer to use Github bugtracker, but I have no strong opinion about
it.

I agree we should warn the users and tell them the provided scripts are
like extensions, delivered "as is".


Cheers,
Michael

I fear only "power users" will have the idea to open the branches of processing toolbox and discover there is a Scripts / Tools / Get scripts from collection. I have no idea though how to improve this.

Especially as it?s a subitem under something that says ?0 geoalgorithms?; that implies there?s nothing under there (it?s non-obvious that these are different things).

I?d suggest that a dedicated button for that functionality be added to the interface somewhere, probably under the ?processing toolbox?.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Problem solved.
I connected to the parent widget's customContextMenuRequested signal,
instead of the QgsMapCanvas's customContextMenuRequested signal.

Problem solved.
I connected to the parent widget's customContextMenuRequested signal,
instead of the QgsMapCanvas's customContextMenuRequested signal.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Core Python plugins and their dependencies
Message-ID: <CALuHMPAWKOjb-02W39mXqNYdREwxSV0wq41TNcWBM+rSs+L7aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

do we have any policy about dependencies of core Python plugins?
Current situation
is a bit messy and confusing.

DB Manager depends on psycopg2 and pyspatialite, but we does not ship this
packages into QGIS source tree. Same for Processing, it contains several
algorithms that require matplotlib and we does not bundle matplotlib in QGIS
source tree. And it is fine, as user can easily install this packages
using package
manager or pip.

On other hand MetaSearch adds 7.4 Mb of dependecies to QGIS sources, while
in most Linux distributions this packages available from repositories
or from PyPI.
Even under Windows this packages present in OSGeo4W installer.

I think it would be good to have clear policy on this. Personally I
think that we
should avoid including Python dependencies in QGIS sources and if plugin
requires some 3rd party libs, we can make it disabled by default ot
even optional (so it will be "compiled" and installed only if all
necessary dependencies already available).

Opinions?

We ship pyspatialite - that's not available everywhere and in case we're using
internal spatialite it should be built against that version.


> I think it would be good to have clear policy on this.

Well, I don't have a good idea what thise clear policy could be.  I'd say there
should be a compelling reason why third party dependencies are included.

pyspatialite is there because of internal spatialite.  Maybe that can be
reconsidered too.  I doubt that anything uses internal spatialite anymore and
there also pysqlite that could be used with spatialite instead of pyspatialite.

owslib is not available everywhere - also AFAIK it's closely releated to
MetaSearch and has the same upstream.

Everything else could be removed from ext-libs AFAICS.

FYI the other deps in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/ext-libs are either
required by OWSLib or MetaSearch proper.

OWSLib: dateutil, pytz,
jinja2: markupsafe, pygments, six

I've deleted python/ext-libs/tests as this was a (since fixed) buggy artifact of the OWSLib build/install.

Of course, but those are usually already available.  At least our debian/ubuntu
and windows packages don't use them and depend on external packages instead -
not sure about OSX.

Message-ID: <005b01d008c7$9adf3d60$d09db820$@spaceyes.fr>

Hi,

 

I have a tool that allow to edit attribute of features (only one attribute):

1-      I select the feature by click on it: vectorLayer->getFeatures(
QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect( tSelectRect ).setFlags(
QgsFeatureRequest::ExactIntersect ))

2-      Modify the attribute

3-      Validate attribute change : vectorLayer->changeAttributeValue(
fId(), iField, newValue,oldValue );

 

The attribute change in attribute table but not on the label (layer is
labeled with the attribute) and in the identify result dialog.

 

I compile my plugin with libraries of Qgis 2.6 shipped with OSGeo4W, if I
use libraries of QGIS that I build from sources it work without any problem.

I compiled the same plugin with libraries of QGIS 2.4 shipped with OSGeo4W
and it worked fine.

 

Regards

Nejia

Hi Tom,

yes, I know that all this packages required by MetaSearch.
But as J?rgen said all this packages available from package
manager in most Linux distros and in OSGeo4W.

Ok, got your point. Sounds fine for me.

if I'm not wrong, now recommended and officially supported way to use SpatiaLite
from Python is pysqlite. But DB Manager used pyspatialite, so maybe
first we need
update it.

Thanks for the link. 
I have checked out the C++ code example on Github before. But it is just
kinda frustrating to see that the examples are mostly from 5 years ago and
so much have changed. Also, for the add_raster_layer example in particular,
the github does not even have all the files needed for the code to run. And
when I just copy the code I need from there, it does not work either.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapRenderer and QgsMapSettings relation
Message-ID: <20141125182428.GB4096@localhost>

I've found code dealing with aspect-ratio adjustments in two places:
QgsMapSettings::updateDerived() and QgsMapRenderer::adjustExtentToSize()

As I'm trying to deal with viewport rotation, any such duplication makes
the work harder as things need to be changed in many different places.

Similar thing happens for QgsMapRenderer::setExtent, which is also
present in QgsMapSettings.

As QgsMapRenderer is actually initialized with a QgsMapSetting object,
should it always use services exposed by that class rather than re-doing
things locally ? Or what am I missing ?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis --version and qgis_mapserv.fcgi --version ?
Message-ID: <5474EB4A.20408@duif.net>

Hi devs,

Playng with QGIS-mapserver I had a qgis_mapserv.fcgi hanging around in
/usr/lib/cgi-bin of which I did not know which version it was

Trying (he, this is Linux) to do a
  qgis_mapserv.fcgi --version
it appears that's not working
So I tried
  qgis --version
which is not there either :-(

We off course have this info in the about-dialog, but I was wondering if
it is worth a feature request to implement those for both exe's (and
qbrowser?)?
Would be cool to see version (git commit?), and used libs (and versions).

We are a first class linux citizen isn't it ;-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

You could also use ldd to get the linked libraries.

I agree with you it could be good to be able to get the git commit number
for one installed QGIS ( build or downloaded)

Thanks for the link. 
I have checked out the C++ code example on Github before. But it is just
kinda frustrating to see that the examples are mostly from 5 years ago and
so much have changed. Also, for the add_raster_layer example in particular,
I setup the whole project on my computer and try to add a layer, it reports
an invalid layer. So right now, I have no idea what to change in order for
the code to work.

I've tried to add the canvas.repaint() with my canvas.refresh(), and it 
seems to work !

Thanks !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Contrast Enhancement
Message-ID: <547519D0.20602@free.fr>

Hi all,

I have some problems to apply new stretching values to my layer

I have a function which allows to adapt the stretching of my image 
without the raster layer properties dialog.

When I open an image with my plugin, I display it on the canvas, I open 
my own histograms, and I can move the min max stretch of the 3 displayed 
bands.

It works well. But, when i save the project, i reopen it, I want to 
change the image stretching, it does nothing. The values are set, but it 
seems that the layer renderer is not updated.

Here is my stretching code :

>     print canvas
>     print "layer :", theRasterLayer
>
>     # type of layer : raster, vector, other
>     typeOfLayer = theRasterLayer.type()
>
>     dataProvider = theRasterLayer.dataProvider()
>
>     # the layer has to be a raster layer
>     if typeOfLayer == 1 :
>         if (theRasterLayer.rasterType() == 0 ) and 
> theRasterLayer.renderer():
> [...]
>

In my case, the canvas, is the main canvas, I have checked I work on the 
good one comparing  the print canvas and the python console with 
iface.mapCanvas().

I know :
* both cases run this function.
* the minimum and maximum values of contrast enhancement are the same in 
my two prints (before and after the setXContrastEnhancement) (so the 
theRasterLayer.renderer().blueContrastEnhancement() seems to be well set)
* these values are the good ones
* they aren't displayed in the raster layer properties dialog
* my raster layer source is ok
* when i do these steps on the QGIS python console with the layer 
iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer() which points to the same file, it works

> layer = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
> blue_en = QgsContrastEnhancement( layer.dataProvider().dataType(2))
> blue_en.setMinimumValue(150)
> blue_en.setMaximumValue(350)
> blue_en.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(1)
> layer.renderer().setBlueContrastEnhancement(blue_en)
> layer.triggerRepaint()

What have I missed ?

Hi,

 

You can see ?Contrast Homogenizer? plugin that you can download it from Qgis Plugins - Official Repository <http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.6> 

File contrastHomogenizer.py line 249

Hi all, 

I have some problems to apply new stretching values to my layer

I have a function which allows to adapt the stretching of my image without the raster layer properties dialog.

When I open an image with my plugin, I display it on the canvas, I open my own histograms, and I can move the min max stretch of the 3 displayed bands.

It works well. But, when i save the project, i reopen it, I want to change the image stretching, it does nothing. The values are set, but it seems that the layer renderer is not updated.

Here is my stretching code :




    print canvas
    print "layer :", theRasterLayer
    
    # type of layer : raster, vector, other
    typeOfLayer = theRasterLayer.type()
         
    dataProvider = theRasterLayer.dataProvider()
    
    # the layer has to be a raster layer
    if typeOfLayer == 1 :
        if (theRasterLayer.rasterType() == 0 ) and theRasterLayer.renderer():
[...]
                
        elif theRasterLayer.rasterType() == 2  and theRasterLayer.renderer():
            min_red, max_red = values[0]
            min_green, max_green = values[1]
            min_blue, max_blue = values[2]
            
            redEnhancement = QgsContrastEnhancement( dataProvider.dataType( 0 ) )
            greenEnhancement = QgsContrastEnhancement( dataProvider.dataType( 1 ) )
            blueEnhancement = QgsContrastEnhancement( dataProvider.dataType( 2 ) )
            #set stretch to min max
            redEnhancement.setMinimumValue( min_red )
            redEnhancement.setMaximumValue( max_red )
            greenEnhancement.setMinimumValue( min_green )
            greenEnhancement.setMaximumValue( max_green )
            blueEnhancement.setMinimumValue( min_blue )
            blueEnhancement.setMaximumValue( max_blue )
            redEnhancement.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(1)
            greenEnhancement.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(1)
            blueEnhancement.setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(1)
            
            print "blue enhancement", blueEnhancement
            print "blue max", blueEnhancement.maximumValue()
            print "blue min", blueEnhancement.minimumValue()
            
            theRasterLayer.renderer().setRedContrastEnhancement( redEnhancement)
            theRasterLayer.renderer().setGreenContrastEnhancement( greenEnhancement )
            theRasterLayer.renderer().setBlueContrastEnhancement( blueEnhancement)
              
        theRasterLayer.triggerRepaint()
        
        print theRasterLayer.renderer().blueContrastEnhancement()
        print theRasterLayer.renderer().blueContrastEnhancement().minimumValue()
        print theRasterLayer.renderer().blueContrastEnhancement().maximumValue()
    canvas.refresh()
    canvas.repaint()

Hi, 

Thanks for your reply.

I've contributed to this plugin :P
The line you pointed to me is the line setting the renderer.
It is used to set the X contrast enhancement.
In my actual code, 
i had 
renderer = theRasterLayer.renderer()
renderer.setRedContrastEnhancement( redEnhancement) 
renderer.setGreenContrastEnhancement( greenEnhancement ) 
renderer.setBlueContrastEnhancement( blueEnhancement )

I changed it to :
theRasterLayer.renderer().setRedContrastEnhancement( redEnhancement) 
theRasterLayer.renderer().setGreenContrastEnhancement( greenEnhancement ) 
theRasterLayer.renderer().setBlueContrastEnhancement( blueEnhancement)
to test if maybe it was a problem with my object renderer. I didn't changed anything, but I've let this writing.

Regards, 
Alexia

After instrospection,

when adding to QGIS an 'OGR VRT' layer with SrcSql tag,
iterarator with spatial filter return no features.

This seems to be due to OGR.

Does anybody know a workaround about this ?

Hi list,

I would like to try Nginx / php-fpm as a replacement of Apache / mod_fcgid
for Lizmap Web Client. I have googled a bit and found that it shall be
possible to do so. Cf links [1] and [2] below

In [2], it seems that Larry would like to publish a recipe to achieve this.

Larry, or anyone else, could point me toward the right direction ?

Hello All,


I just uploaded a new plugin, named  "LocationSaver"  that  creates a
memory layer containing  the current saved QGIS canvas viewports.

It can be useful to save and recover location views.

If you like, please approve it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Impossible to keep QGIS 2.4 while updating QGIS
 master (osgeo4W nightly build)
Message-ID: <CAECJsSqerknbfhLqtsJZEfwQwnQ58cC-EY5gH4TQr-xBJXtgQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I use OsGeo4W to install both QGIS stable and master releases.
Due to the bug of QGIS 2.6.0-1 that crashes QGIS and ruins some older
project file, I decided to not yet upgrade to 2.6 (and keep 2.4) but still
update nightly builds.
The first time I got 2.7, I choose to keep 2.4. After the install process,
I was unable to run QGis 2.4, getting the error message attached when
launching either the shortcut or the qgis.bat file in install directory.
Two days later, after updating nightly build , QGIS 2.4 worked fine and
stopped again at the next nightly build.
Since, reinstalling QGIS 2.4 in osgeo4w install process doesn't fix it, the
only usable release remains the Master.

Is this a bug or is it impossible to install both master and "not the
latest stable" releases through osgeo4W? If a bug, should I file a ticket
on qgis hub or elsewhere?
Any idea how I can get back a working QGIS 2.4?

I'm on Windows 7 64 bits but I got the same bug on Windows 8 32 bits.

Thanks.

Thank you for the good question. 

Substantially, "bookmarks" works saving canvas parameters at QGIS level, that is:  the saved canvas are visible for all projects of QGIS on that machine.
Instead, my plugin saves a temporary level that I can save with that specific QGIS project ( and, also, I can save as SHP or other , for example kml, to share it to other users ).

Does the "bookmarks" functionality make the same ?
If yes, sorry for the disturb. 
If not, please approve it. 

Ciao
Roberto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Viewport rotation: QgsMapCanvasMap and angles
Message-ID: <20141126173751.GD804@localhost>

After many hours trying to figure out who was ruining my vector data
angles I finally found the QgsMapCanvasMap::paint method complaining
about DIFFERENT SIZE of image and item.

Indeed the documentation for QPainter::drawImage(QRect, QImage) says
that the image is scaled to fit the rectangle, which in my case it meant
also ruining the angles (different aspect ratio between the two).

I tested and can confirm that passing the image size to QPainter::drawImage,
rather than the item size, fixes all the angles.
Unfortunately doing so also leaves some spurious rendered area not-cleared
and dunno what other damages it could do.

So my question now is: who's responsible for setting the bounding
rectangle of the map canvas _map_ item ?

Yes, I can help with generating some recipes for serving QGIS Server,
beyond Apache. I would like to see recipes for nginx and lighttpd included.
Both require independent spawning of the FCGI binary as a separate process,
and lighttpd has good FastCGI support via its internal (or exernal)
spawn-fcgi utility. See links [0, 1, 2].

It is important to offer a solid, thoroughly tested nginx recipe as it is a
commonly available Web server nowadays, and it uses very little in the way
of resources (so good for low-RAM VPS setups). I personally don't serve any
maps to enough users to properly test heavy loads. Will need help from
other devs with load testing the recipes.

For nginx, you can also use spawn-fcgi (or fcgiwrap, etc.) but I have found
the uWSGI [3] process manager to work very well with nginx. uWSGI also is
beneficial for deploying the Python-based search functionality offered in
the QGIS Web Client. While there are only a few examples of
serving/spawning FastCGI under uWSGI (here's a simple one [4]), it is fully
supported like many of the other protocols in uWSGI.

IMO, uWSGI offers the most configurable and flexible process manager, and
can work well as a QGIS Server backend manager to almost any Web server
frontend, e.g. nginx, lighttpd, Cherokee, Apache, etc, and on all platforms.

Of note: I used a lighttpd/spawn-fcgi setup for doing the labeling tests
for Server. See [5, 6] (has some lightweight, non-production spawning
script samples for Debian and Mac). One reason for this setup choice is
that both tools now have a CMake build and could conceivably be a
dependency for embedding a Server instance *inside* of the QGIS desktop
application (for previewing Server output, without the need for any server
setup on the part of the user).

Concerning php-fpm, I believe that is only for managing a PHP FastCGI
implementation and is now part of PHP source. I don't think it can be used
to manage a QGIS Server process. It seems like a good fit for LizMap
server-side PHP scripting, though.

I also think it would be good to offer a tutorial on combining QGIS Server
with other tools, like MapProxy [7], which is readily installable alongside
OSGeo4W [8].

You can always download the standalone installer of QGIS for Windows
from http://qgis.org/downloads/. Each one brings his own environment
with it, so no interference with the latest master build in osgeo4w.

In 2.4, when writing geoJSON, QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat() created Point features. In 2.6, this seems to have changed to Multipoint. Is this intentional? If so, why?

Message-ID: <437e323a7289541039e2f33e533dc558@carto.net>

Hi,

I tried the new heatmap renderer in QGIS master. It works nicely.

I wonder if we could introduce a caching mechanism in a temporary raster 
layer to speed up zooming and panning? The idea would be to recreate the 
heatmap every time the project is loaded and then cache it while the 
project is open. At least as an option. For small data or smaller search 
radius the live behaviour would still work well, but for larger data 
sets of larger search radius, such a cache raster would speed things up 
significantly, especially in a server scenario.

Would such a cache be technically possible and useful?

I'm not sure about a cache (would have to think about this), but try
changing the "Render quality" for the heatmap to "Fastest". That
should make a huge difference in the render speed.

Hmm, handling a cache for the heatmap renderer would probably be quite
challenging. Let's say a temporary raster heatmap is created to ease
panning, you'd have to re do this every time the zoom level is changed. You
could decide to cache as many temporary raster hearmaps as zoom levels
requested by the user during a session, but that'd probably be a memory
nightmare both in terms of nb of zoom levels and resolution of temporary
raster at high level values. All of that cache would also have to be
revoked as soon as the dataset is modified.

In cases where a cache is needed, your probably better off with a formal
raster heatmap.

Hi there,

I had this problem when I was running 1.8 and 1.9 out of osgeo. 

I think I ended up keeping backup copies of the qgis and qgis-dev bat files and subbing them in when one broke. It's a bit annoying but it worked.

While I was doing this someone (and I think it was Andre, who's already replied) pointed out that it was perfectly possible (and much more stable) to install QGIS stable through the released standalone installer, and continue with qgis-dev through the osgeo installer. 

-ramon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsExpression: Comment support and unary minus
Message-ID: <5476DD64.6000700@gmx.ch>

Hi all,

I am working on introducing comment support for QgsExpressions (See
below for examples). Line comments should be started with `--` (double
minus) like in SQL. Running the test suite on this complains, because
there is a test for unary minus that tests if `--1` evaluates properly.
And that would be considered a comment after this change, currently it
evaluates to 1 (Legitimate, but is that useful?).
Question:

 * Is that a typo and it should actually be `-1`?
 * Is there a reason, that `--` as initial delimiter for line comments
is not good?

------------------------
Examples:

Block comments:

    /*
     * Comment
     */

And line comments:

    CASE
      WHEN name = 'QGIS' THEN 'Yay' -- Using the good stuff
      ELSE 'Nay' -- You can get it on http://qgis.org
    END

Why not double slash '//' to keep block and line comments consistent.

In my experience many SQL dialects use -- in favor of //. I don not know
the reason for this.

Code highlighting already in QGIS 2.6 hints that -- and /* */ are
comments but not //. I think this is the default with `setSciLexerSQL`.

Cool - looking forward to that.

The test is just a check that double unary minus is parsed and
evaluated correctly. I guess the test should be changed to read -(-1)

So from me -(-1) to use '--' for line comments ;-)

If I may suggest something (not that I'm volunteering to do it myself for QGIS 
;-)), a Vagrant setup based on a Ubuntu Precise 64bit might be helpful to have 
a reference configuration very close to a Travis VM, so that people can easily 
reproduce and debug build or test failures.
An exemple of such a Vagrantfile : 
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/Vagrantfile
And instructions how to use it:

Thanks a lot Larry for this detailed answer ! I will give uWSGI a try to
spawn QGIS Server, and use php-fpm to boost Lizmap php proxy scripts.
I will report my progress here as soon as I can

Cheers,

Michael

Hi 

Is it possible to load zipped shapefiles with python? I have some zip files with several shapefiles in it. I tried something like this:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer("/vsizip/home/stefan/Downloads/2546.zip/lfp3.shp", LFP3, "ogr")

But the layer is not valid.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Replacing Extent with Center in QgsMapSettings
	(for rotation)
Message-ID: <20141127173618.GA16067@localhost>

I've finally handled to get a correctly rendered rotated map
(git://github.com/strk/QGIS.git "rotation" branch) but more work
will be needed to correctly get the source data extent and output
rectangle for clipping purpose.

As I continue working in the branch, I can't stop thinking that
the QgsMapSetting class should be refactored to move away from
the concept of "extent" as a defining setting.

Currently, callers set the map's "extent", which togheter with
the output viewport size is used to derive the scale and the
"visible extent" (see QgsMapSettings::updateDerived).

Once the concept of rotation is added, the meaning of "extent"
becomes very confusing. What does it represent, exactly ?

The only "stable" concept you can derive from the extent is its
center, which togheter with a scale and a rotation could be
used to derive the visible extent.

OpenLayers indeed has center, rotation and scale as the defining
parameters of a view: http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/apidoc/ol.View.html

In this scenario, panning would move the center, retaining scale
and rotation. Zooming would change scale, retaninig rotation and center
(combined zoom+pan could still be used). Rotation would retain the
scale and center.

Right now the class has mExtent and a mVisibleExtent members,
with the new configuration only the "visible extent" would make sense,
and could always be computed given an output size (currently also
a member of the class).

How would you see a transition toward this new configuration ?

If you want to follow the progress for rotation support, there's

Hi Stefan,

maybe you already figured out?

qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer("/vsizip//data/disk/home/richard/geodata/nl/autowegen.zip",
"wegen", "ogr")

loads a layer to me. Note though that you get the 'crs' popup in between.

vlayer =
QgsVectorLayer("/vsizip//data/disk/home/richard/geodata/nl/autowegen.zip",
"wegen", "ogr")

also works.

Note:
- /vsizip//   <= double /
- "ogr"  <= no capitals
(second argument is a string)

To whom it may concern:

 

I am writing to recommend you the services of Gospodarczy Instytut Analiz
Przestrzennych (Institute of Spatial Economic Analysis). We are a small company
from Warsaw mainly interested in GIS, local planning and cartography. Our
leading software in this area of our work is QGIS. We chose this particular
software mainly due to its simplicity, intuitive interface, big variety of
plugins. And of course unlimited access.

Although QGIS is undeniably one of the most simple in use software than most of
available currently softwares, we observed that during our work with local
government on plans and studies, local officials have problems obtaining the
software on their own. Our cooperation with local governments is becoming more
intense due to the adoption of the EU INSPIRE Directive. This will enforce local
officials to learn to operate the software fluently. Therefore, we decided to
organize trainings of software support, which have a relatively great
popularity.

Our trainings contribute to increase knowledge about  QGIS and geographic
 information systems in general. Thanks to your support, the scope of our
activities can be enlarged, which may also become advantageous for you. Placing
on the website of QGIS logo of our company, as recommended by developers, not
only increase the prestige of our Institute, but will result in a further
consequence in extending information about QGIS.

We kindly ask you to consider our proposal. We wish you continued success in
development of QGIS products.

Yours faithfully,

Hi Sandro,

I think you have a valid point, and hope that other core devs will chime in.

I'm also wondering about this kind of use cases outside the geo world,
like how do they do that in the CAD world, 3D world or rendering world?
And what about non-ortogonal projections which do not have a square
extent either?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Sandro

How would scale be defined for maps in degrees (witout constant scale on 
the map)?
Alternatively, there could be a rectangle (four corner points) instead 
of a bounding box.

By "scale" I mean "resolution", that is how many source units fit
in a pixel. The meaning of a source unit is left to the spatial projection;
map distortions issues are in no way attempted to be solved by this change.

> Alternatively, there could be a rectangle (four corner points)

To represent an "area of interest", in alternative to "center & resolution" ?
It would be a 4 vertices polygon, rather than a "rectangle" (the term
is already taken for objects that are defined as being not-rotated).

Would such "area of interest" be then restricted to have only right angles ?
It could still sound arbitrary to allow rotation but not map projection
distortion... it should be analyzed what's the actual usability of such
configuration.

For sure a "rotating rectangle" would encode all of center, rotation
and scale (the latter being dependent on output). But does it make sense
for an "area of interest" to include rotation ?

I see, then it makes sense to go with scale / resolution.

Objet : [Qgis-developer] pb with change attribute value in QGIS 2.6

 

Hi,

 

I have a tool that allow to edit attribute of features (only one attribute):

1-      I select the feature by click on it: vectorLayer->getFeatures(
QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterRect( tSelectRect ).setFlags(
QgsFeatureRequest::ExactIntersect ))

2-      Modify the attribute

3-      Validate attribute change : vectorLayer->changeAttributeValue(
fId(), iField, newValue,oldValue );

 

The attribute change in attribute table but not on the label (layer is
labeled with the attribute) and in the identify result dialog.

 

I compile my plugin with libraries of Qgis 2.6 shipped with OSGeo4W, if I
use libraries of QGIS that I build from sources it work without any problem.

I compiled the same plugin with libraries of QGIS 2.4 shipped with OSGeo4W
and it worked fine.

 

Regards

Nejia

Hi all.
I noticed that if I set:

  SetEnv QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH "/.qgis2/"

www-data writes in it:

  cache  gdal_pam  qgis.db

whereas if I set it to a different name, nothing is written.
Furthermore, a QGIS/QGIS2.ini file does not seem to be used (read/write), e.g. for:

  [svg]
  searchPathsForSVG=/path/to/svg

Has the behaviour of otionspath changed, or am I missing something?

All the best.

Hi,

this work for me:
(using qgis 2.6:)

I put (in the profile file)

this setting:

export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins
export QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH=/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/config/

In the folder:
/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/config

I put a subfolder named "QGIS"
and inside it I put a file QGIS2.ini   (without any dot in front)

Inside the QGIS2.ini
I put this settings:

[svg]
searchPathsForSVG=/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/svg/simbologie_continuum_geologia_regione_toscana|/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/svg/simboli_rt_dbt2k_v0

It work correctly and the svg are shown.

Please notiche the path
/home/archivio/server/qgis-settings/config/
is owned from the same user of web server.

regards,

A.

Today I've pushed new code to fix panning, zooming and center-setting
tools with fully-visible rotated maps.

While doing that I found a meaning for the current simple "extent"
concept. What's currently called "extent" basically encodes _center_
and _resolution_ of the map. That's what we add in "bookmarks".

Part of my recent commits have been adding a method to explicitly
set the center, so that at least the caller is guaranteed that scale
won't change. Setting extent still has the possibility to change the
scale, for the finding above.

I haven't tested it yet, but I suppose the zoom tool is still funny
while the map is rotated (rubberband is not a rectangle). Also, labels
placement needs to be improved with rotated map.

Tests welcome!
As usual, git remote is git://github.com/strk/QGIS.git
and branch is "rotation"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions about Dialog for Select by Expression
Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E9DCA340A@P1KITMBX03WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,
In the dialog Select by expression there has been some changes in 2.6

Window dragging in expressions must have a minimum vale so the express doesn't disappear if you drag down.
Secondly - before there was a syntax coloring - now it?s all the same color.
At last - why does buttons change name - if there is no change in function? Here I refere to Load values.

Please see the video http://screencast.com/t/VE4PvkT1 that explains the questions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Core dump when starting QGIS
Message-ID: <547C12E0.3070803@carto.net>

Hi,

I recently upgraded from Kubuntu 14.04 to 14.10. With the current master 
I get a core dump when starting QGIS. I removed the build directory and 
recreated the settings with ccmake. The compile works fine but when I 
start QGIS I get a core dump. Here are the startup messages:

-------------------------------------

Warning: loading of qt translation failed 
[/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
Warning: Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address.
IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
Warning: QGraphicsScene::addItem: item has already been added to this scene
QGIS died on signal 11Could not attach to process.  If your uid matches 
the uid of the target
process, check the setting of /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope, or try
again as the root user.  For more details, see /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
ptrace: Operation not permitted.
No thread selected
No stack.
gdb returned 0
Aborted (core dumped)

---------------------------

I see the splash screen and immediately get a core dump. I don't even 
see the main application window.

I wonder if there is a library problem after my Ubuntu update?

Thank you if you have any idea what I could do to solve my problem.

Andreas

Hi,

the same happened to me yesterday when upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04.

When I launched QGIS the second time it ran without errors.
