Hi

You may also want to peek at the changelog - there is not too much there
yet but it might give some nice hints of things to mention:

Hi,

 

Apologies for the delay in my reply. The talk was accepted for FOSS4G 2017 Boston, and Kurt / myself will be co-presenting.

 

The "State of QGIS" talk abstract is attached. I will be bringing this topic up with the community to gather contributor feedback on overall content and direction, since the talk should represent community viewpoints and cover topics the community thinks it should.

Hi Tim, Andreas, et al.,

 

Thank you for the quick replies and support. I will submit a "State of QGIS" talk today. Regardless of whether it is accepted, I will probably be in attendance at FOSS4G Boston.

 

 

Great!





 

Note that I intend this talk to be completely vetted by the community. I will be posting to the dev list with requests for comments, opinions and suggestions on content. While I will be working on this talk at work (assuming it is accepted), it will purely be about and for the community's efforts, with absolutely no content related to my employer, excepting to thank them for supporting my attendance to the event.

 

 

Thanks that sounds great.





 

I could get someone from work to help with the talk, or be a backup; though, I would definitely prefer someone from the QGIS dev community to help in this regard, ideally someone who does not also work for my employer.


 

 

I'd be happy to help compiling your slides / reviewing them etc. I guess Kurt Menke might be going along - you might want to touch base with him to hear if he is going - he isn't a developer but he is very up to speed with QGIS and the QGIS community activities. Hopefully anyone else on the dev list who is going will pipe up and pitch in if they can.





 

Anyone attending FOSS4G Boston and willing to help out? If so, I need to know today. Thanks.

Is someone from the QGIS project already giving, or submitted a proposal for, a 'State of QGIS' type of presentation?

 

If not I will be going and am willing to put in a proposal for such a talk, highlighting QGIS 3 development and upcoming release (if the community is OK with that). If so, I would prefer to co-present with someone from the project who will also be attending.

 

I am not sure who else is going along, but it will be great if you can present on behalf of the project! Big +1 from me!

As writer of proposal 12) ENHANCE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN QGIS AND X3D
(full details here:
https://qgisblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/qgisgrantapplicationssummary-march2017.pdf,
proposal 12)
, although unsuccessful, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the
QGIS Voting Membership and Sterring Committee for taking the time to read
through all proposal and cast votes. I recognize that having two 3d related
proposals made it difficult to support both at the same time with so many
other deserving projects also in the mix. Therefore, I do value the votes
in support of my proposal particularly. Thanks !

If you are curious, please head over to

https://github.com/andreasplesch/QGIS-X3D-Processing

to follow progress on this project. Any feedback, or contributions are much

Dev's,

I have been looking into an issue [0] where the GML file was actually
wrong (identical fid's for every feature), but QGIS is misbehaving
because it shows all 15 geometries, but only 1 line in the attribute table.

A lot of problems that pop up on mailing lists or issue tracker are
actually DATA related. But because the uses do not know enough about the
data/specs or structure for them QGIS is always the one to blame...

Given that I thought that it would be nice to be able to run QGIS in a
'stricter' mode, in which QGIS before or during opening a dataset does
some more checking/testing of that data.

Some examples I can think of (from recent experiences):

GML (or other OGR data sources)
- check while loading the data if fid's are unique (because if not...
see problem above)
- check with the first 10 geometries loaded if the coordinates are
actually in range of the CRS (else...)

POSTGIS
- make sure there is a primary key on tables (maybe even do a scan on
all tables and check if they have those)

ORACLE
- check if the table has at least one geom column registred in the
SDO_GEOM_METADATA view
- the srs in the geometry is the same as in the metadata (else errors
when doing spatial things IN the db)

WKT
- see [1], an issue where people feed MultiPoint (-20 -90, -20 -88 )
while it should be MultiPoint ((-20 -90),(-20 -88))

Shapefiles
- where I see:
//TODO - add sanity check for shape file layers, to include checking to
//       see if the .shp, .dbf, .shx files are all present and the layer
//       actually has features
bool QgsOgrProvider::isValid() const
{
  return mValid;
}

etc etc I think everybody can come up with such tests.

Discussing this with Matthias, we realize that there CAN be a
performance penalty on this 'premature' tests, but I think both for QGIS
and the user it is best when the user is informed about 'data problems'...

Main points I want to make:

- QGIS should either be as informative as possible to inform the user of
bad data structures (throw Exceptions?), or be able to do such tests on
demand. Not sure of too much forgiveness helps QGIS (as in [1])

- thinking about the 'one button that loads them all' discussion in
Essen see [2] we should maybe think about a 'Data Management Dialog' in
which you can both Load, Create AND TEST Datasources?

Maybe a grant for adding such tests? To make QGIS more 'data-robust'?

Regards and sorry for my long emails but it sometimes bugs me that QGIS
is so full of features but silently chokes or doesn't work because of
data-related problems,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I'd like to add a ticket to redmine but it seems that my account is 
unable to add new issues.
I'm correctly logged to the system and I can explore previous issues but 
I cannot figure how can I add a new one.
Maybe I must wait for authorization?
Thanks
enrico

A big +1 from me. Thanks, Richard. The performance penalty can be mitigated
by making the checks optional.

Hi Enrico

The Redmine address changed just this weekend. See:

True, we moved from hub.qgis.org to https://issues.qgis.org

BUT if all goes as planned you will just be redirected automagically

Note that we run issues.qgis.org only of https

Please let me know if things do not appear to work as expected.
We did tweak this during the weekend, so problems during this weekend
should be ignored :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

The redirect seems to be working fine, but using the same credentials from
http://hub.qgis.org/ I get error 403:

"You are not authorized to access this page"

Best regards,
Pedro

For some reason the QGIS Application project was not public anymore - and
"non-members" (users logged in, but not in any group) also didn't have access.
It's now public again (as it was and should be) and that seems to help.

Hi Richard,

Fully support all of your concerns.
I was talking about exactly the same to someone at the HF (cannot
remember who it was), but it would be great to have it.
There is only one thing.. Who is going to do it?

+1 from me for this idea (it would be good for the reputation of QGIS
to detect/refuse to work with bogus data)

regards
Werner

Looking into the proposal, makes me wonder if it would be possible to add
the Browser panel (that will need to be big enough for the dialogs) to the
right of the Layers Panel (assuming the default). That would imply a new
area to allow docking panels.

Hi Alexandre, 

hm - I don't think we can allow more docking space for additional panels
taking more away from the  

Assuming you work on a small Netbook screen: if you have the layer panel
on the left and the styling panel on the right, you have a few pixels
left for the map itself. If you add another column for the browser
panel, you won't even have enough space for all the panels. 

Now you could say, one shouldn't use a Netbook for QGIS - but how many
times did you have to present on a video projector that only supports
1024x768, or even worse 800x600. It would be nightmare if there is an
additional panel.

UX mailing list has been shut down months ago because it used to refer to dev list for most of decisions/advices so UX matters are now discussed either in the dev mailing list (we maybe can keep this thread) or, I guess until QGIS3 release, in the qgis3_UIX_discussion repository.

Hi, we already can put the dock panels as tabs in the same dock as the
layer tree, this is convenient to me in general for the browser.
Agreed with Andréa, we can't afford to use more space for the docks.. even
for medium size screens.

I see your point, but I was not asking it for be the default behavior.

That might not work for all users, specially those with small screen, but
for others with big high resolution screens, may look strange to have a
bunch of tools stacked and tabbed, with still so much space in the screen
to use.

Also, keeping the exact number of space used, people could move style dock
right next to the layers panel.

Anyway, no big deal, just me wondering about it.

Hi, 

I am trying to get QGIS quickfinder running (the version from github,
not the packaged version), because I want to test the new Postgres
search functionality. 

I checked out the source from https://github.com/3nids/quickfinder (the
master_2 version) and also the qsettingsmanager. I changed the Makefile
to reflect my Pythonpath. The make and make deploy went fine, but when I
load the plugin I get the error message

Hi Andreas,

I think this is a due to a bad compilcation of the UI files with pyuic. It
probably failed at finding QGIS gui lbrabry.
Look maybe at the Makefile here
https://github.com/3nids/quickfinder/blob/master_2/Makefile to define the
path properly.

Best wishes,
Denis

Hi Denis,

I modified QGISBUILDDIR in the makefile. First tried with

QGISBUILDDIR = 
$(HOME)/dev/QGIS${QGIS_MAJOR_VERSION}/ninja-build/output/python

but also

QGISBUILDDIR = /home/an/QGIS/2.18/share/qgis/python

Which is the install dir of QGIS 2.18.

In general, the Makefile works fine. But during "make deploy" I get the 
error:

pylupdate4 error: Cannot save 'i18n/quickfinder_fr.ts': No such file or 
directory
pylupdate4 error: Cannot save 'i18n/quickfinder_de.ts': No such file or 
directory

These are the only error messages I got during Makefile execution.

Anyway - if you update the quickfinder plugin anyway - I'll probably 
wait for that.

Andreas

Hi all QGIS developers,

I'm submitting a new plugin: https://github.com/enricofer/gdrive_provider

So I should release the plugin with GPLv3 that I understand is compatible
with with plugin licencing policy ("GPLv2 or greater")
<http://blog.qgis.org/2016/05/29/licensing-requirements-for-qgis-plugins/>

The plugin is provided with a checkbox that makes aware the user about the
Google Drive Terms of Service.

Do You think that GPLv3 licensing and Google Drive Terms of Service
disclaimer suffits?

Hey,

Yes, that is fine.  You can use Apache libraries in a GPL applications (I
think QGIS already does) just not the other way around e.g you can't make
an Apache application that includes GPL code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis 3 still includes qt4+py2 stuff and missing
	_gdal_array.pyd
Message-ID: <CAEDrt399yDCJU5mUm_QARFxzNz3t+fH21DQc=w2s13snjmsiOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wondered why does the latest qgis 3.0 weekly build (2.99.0-18) still
contains some qt4 and py2.7 binaries.
OSGeo4W.bat still defaults to qt4+py2.7 (separate batch files
qt5_env.bat, py3_env.bat are required to run in order to work with qt5+py3).

also, _gdal_array.pyd is missing from
apps\Python36\Lib\site-packages\osgeo
and available only on:
apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\osgeo
(same for x64 and x86 releases)

[With the latest gisinternals binaries, I could find _gdal_array.pyd in the
file:
release-1800-gdal-mapserver.zip\bin\gdal\python\osgeo\_gdal_array.pyd
but not in the x64 version.]


thus the following code fails:

import gdal
x = gdal.Open(r'D:/Map Samples/1/DTM/n29w098d5dtm.tif')  #valid tif
y = x.ReadAsArray()
print(y)


produces this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

That sounds like: https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6801

OSGeo4W probably needs to include the patch for that issue like the 
Debian package does.

Hi devs,

I have opened an issue, because some users can't install QGIS 2.18.7 and 
2.14.14 on windos because the installer checked the vcruntime140.dll

I see that indeed this bug is demonstrated by running "import
osgeo.gdal_array" (works on qgis2 but not on qgis3)

I manually applied the suggested fix in gdal_array.py:

-import _gdal_array
+from . import _gdal_array

But it still doesn't work on qgis3.
Isn't _gdal_array.pyd  a required file for import gdal_array in py3? It's
present only in the py2.7 lib folder.

I'm not sure if this file is auto generated by SWIG or if this fix in
gdal_array.i would make any difference.

QGIS depends on GRASS, which still depends on python2.

This is good news for us - if you follow the recent discussion over at

it looks like the future of QtWebKit is solid, and there's also a

Hello all

Apologies if this has already been addressed in master - I don't know the
codebase well enough to investigate.

While expanding my plugin's test suite, I got tripped up by this. The
following works in 2.18.7:

QgsVectorLayer(url, name, 'WFS') # uppercase "WFS"

However, the following does not:

QgsRasterLayer(url, name, 'WMS') # to work, "wms" must be lower case

Thanks

Tom

Hi all,
with PostgreSQL 9.4 I hit a previously unknown error when applying
versioning to a table:

ERROR:  cannot perform INSERT RETURNING on relation "pmo_current"
HINT:  You need an unconditional ON INSERT DO INSTEAD rule with a

A similar error was informally reported during the HF.
Does anybody confirm? Should the rule be updated to work on newer versions?
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Expression to get label reference point X and Y
 for use with geometry generator (make_line) ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO72YQXjKv8DE2v1Ps5p=qnV7K2C4VJcexj9kDBzuRGOfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS !

I am playing with data-defined label position, with 2 column label_x and
label_y.
I use a geometry generator to draw the line between the label and the
feature centroid, like

make_line(
  centroid( $geometry ),
  make_point( "label_x", "label_y" )
)

It work pretty well (with some rectangle background under the label text),
but it is obviously only active when the label_x and label_y fields are not
NULL ( when the label is pinned )

I would like to draw this line for any features (perhaps depending on this
line length). So basically, I would need 2 new functions $x_label and
$y_label.

Anyone has tried to achieve this ?

Cheers,
Michaël

Hi!

I submitted a bunch of QEP on that topic, if you have customers interested
to go ahead, we probably should mutualize things there and seek for common
budgets too.
What makes sense to me is that Callouts connectors make sense when labels
have been manually moved, not much for automated placement. If you let PAL
use "around point", then you will draw random lines in all directions,
which is not nice on screen.
If you align all labels using a corner placement option, then I think you
can compute easily the offset XY from centroid also.

What my plugin does for custom labeling is that it takes profit of the
pin/unpin buttons which writes the PAL computed to the XY columns.

Good news, I ported the plugin to QGIS3 at the hackfest, it's now in the
repo and here:

https://github.com/haubourg/EasyCustomLabeling/blob/qgis3_port/EasyCustomLabeling/EasyCustomLabeling.py

Feel free to submit a PR to replace the Line Label layer by a pure copy of
the source layer, and replace lines by a geometry generator (I wish I had
time for it)

i'm experiencing problems with saga

but processing is not longer compatible with the new

yes, there are known issues. If you use Windows/osgeo4w for now is
better to stick with SAGA 2.1.2 (from osgeo4w)

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16423

the above issue is not a Processing one, but rather a packing one.

cheers!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Custom python expression question
Message-ID: <89d184973ca893b4aa3baa3b747ec19b@carto.net>

Hi, 

If one creates a custom python expression, one gets a reference to the
"feature" and the "parent". 

Question: what is "parent" referring to? What object type is it? 

Is it somehow possible in the Python script to get a reference to the
layer the feature is part of? Would there be some example Python code
around that shows how one can get access to the layer the feature
belongs to? 

Thank you for any hints, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
I don't know if it is the best way for doing it, but I generally add the
current feature and the current layer as input parameters of the custom
function:

def my_function(layer_name, curr_feat, feature, parent):

They are set as inputs in this way when calling the custom function:

my_function(@layer_name, $currentfeature)

Then, I can simply call the current layer and the current feature inside
the function in this way:

layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName(layer_name)[0]

geom = curr_feat.geometry()

For a better understanding, you may also have a look to my recent answer on
this question on GIS Stack Exchange [0]:

[0]
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/235014/increasing-marker-size-based-on-number-of-points-at-same-location-in-qgis

I hope that helps.
Best regards,
Marco

Hey Andreas,

Parent means the parent expression itself.  So in a function, you can know
what the whole expression is e.g it points to the instance of.

You can't really know what the layer because expressions are not always
layer bound and QgsFeatures don't hold a reference to the layer they are
from.  Best you can do at the moment I think is to pass the layer name or
id into the custom expressions.

Actually, there would also be the "context" which gives access to the
@layer variable (a QgsVectorLayer object) and other additional things.

It's just slightly more complex to set up because it's not proxied to
the @qgsfunction.

One will need to subclass QgsExpression.Function as done here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/__init__.py#L74-L102

And then register it manually.

I think we should also send this to the @qgsfunction in QGIS 3.

QgsAggregateCalculator.calculate() method look like in Python? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem reading project file
Message-ID: <32861db8-29df-5410-16c5-ffdf66282628@fh-aachen.de>

Hi,

in a QGIS-plugin I need to read a template project file (*.qgs), modify it to adapt it to the currently loaded database
etc. using xml.etree.ElementTree, write it and read it again.


    ....

    qgsxml.write(projectfile)                       # writemodified project file

    project = QgsProject.instance()
    project.read(QFileInfo(projectfile))         # read the new project file

    projectfilecontains the name of the new *.qgs projectfile

First attempt is successful, the second fails (groups are loaded but there are no layers), third attempt is successful,
fourth fails and so on...

Everything works fine when I use the menu "project > new" before starting the plugin.

Have i done something wrong?

Best wishes

Hi, 

I have a basic example using aggregates: 

---------------------- 

@qgsfunction(args='auto', group='Custom', usesgeometry=False)
def get_ews_anlage_nr(gemeinde, feature, parent):
AnlageLayer =
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('Anlage')[0]
maxVal = AnlageLayer.aggregate(4,'to_int(substr("anlage_nr",4,4))')[0]
return maxVal 

----------------------- 

But I still have two questions: 

1. I still struggle to define a filter. I can't find the correct syntax
how to define that filter string. 

2. the first parameter "4" stands for "Max" aggregate (according to
http://qgis-python.kartoza.com/docs/core/other/QgsAggregateCalculator.html#class-qgsaggregatecalculator
). Could this code be written more "readable" by specifying "Max"
instead of 4? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi,

Finally, with the support from Matthias, I got a working example of my 
custom Python expression:

@qgsfunction(args='auto', group='Custom', usesgeometry=False)
def get_ews_anlage_nr(gemeinde, feature, parent):
     AnlageLayer = 
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName('Anlage')[0]
     aggParams = QgsAggregateCalculator.AggregateParameters()
     aggParams.filter = 'substr("anlage_nr",1,2) = \''+gemeinde+'\''
     maxVal = 
AnlageLayer.aggregate(QgsAggregateCalculator.Max,'to_int(substr("anlage_nr",4,4))',aggParams)[0]
     return maxVal

When I define the QgsAggregateCalculator.AggregateParameters() upfront 
separately it works fine. First I was trying to set the parameter 
directly within AnlageLayer.aggregate() but failed to find the direct 
syntax of the QgsAggregateCalculator.AggregateParameters() parameters. 
There are hardly any examples out there. But hey - finally it works!

Have a nice weekend!
Andreas

I am adding this to the developers mailing list as it is something to pay
attention to. It looks like there are a number of individuals that are
having QGIS crash.

Hi All,

please create an issue about this crashing:

https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues/

note that devs need as much as info possible (Operating System, versions
used, plugins used, and actual things to do to reproduce the crash, see
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/bugreporting.html)

Regards,

Richard

All,

I wouldn't mind submitting the bug report, but I think there may be
something more involved than just zooming in and out. It usually crashes
when I am zooming in and out, but in testing this with just a simple shape
it has not crashed for me. A more complex project is probably involved. If
any of you can come up with a way to cause it to consistently crash let me
know or just submit the bug report yourself.

Here it would be important to learn, when using the georeferencer, what the
working conditions are:

How many gcp-points are being used when such crashes occur.
Does the application become 'sluggish' when moving the gcp-points around.
When using the right-mouse click on the GCP-Table, does it take a long time
for the Menu to show?

In the past I have noticed that when the amount of gcp point are > 300-400
such symptoms started - becoming unusable at around 1000.

Internally there are 3 collections of the gcp-points (QgsGCPList)
1) to check later for any changes that need to be saved to the points file
2) in the main georeferencer
3) the QgsGCPListWidget which filled the GCP-Table and rendered the points
in the georeferencer and qgis canvas

For each major change (point position, adding or removal) these lists were
being completely replaced, thus forcing the rebuilding of the GCP-Table and
the rendered points in both canvasess, which was a major cause of the
application becoming 'sluggish' and sometimes caused the application to
crash when the gcp-points where > 800.

To make matters worse, this action was also taking place during the initial
reading of the '.points' file, so that when the next point was being added,
the previous points were being deleted and then rebuilt with the next point.
With a project that contained > 1000 points the loading took over 20
minutes to load.

This problem was corrected around September 2016, so that now the GCP-Table
in the QgsGCPListWidget is only build after all the points have been read.

This did not resolve the problem that after major changes the list is still
being rebuild, instead of updating, adding or removing when needed.
Also that (it seems) that gcp-points in the georeferencer and qgis canvas
are being rendered that are outside of the visible area.

So if the georeferencer is the cause of such crashes, this I think would be
the area to look for.

---
The 'Proposal 7 QGIS Enhancment Georeferencer' of the 2017 QGIS Grant
Proposals, I believe resolves this issue.

The *.points' file has been replaced with a spatialite Database, so that
the rendering is done through a QgsVectorLayer.

The QgsGCPListWidget deals with the administration for the GCP-Table,
updating, adding or removed without replacing the whole QgsGCPList.
Also the needed MeanError calculations are being only done when needed.

With this solution, the 'sluggish' symptoms starts around 1100 points and
the occasional crashes (where the machine was very busy) no longer occur.

Hi all,
I think this may have been raised previously, sorry if I repeat.
Layers loaded get a random colour, which sometimes do not create a nice
and readable palette. How difficult would it be to use one of a set of
standard palettes? There are many tools to create correct ones, even rom
existing images.
All the best, and thanks for thoughts.

Finally, I realized that it is a bug already submitted to the bugtracker 
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/12502.
In my experience, it is strongly correlated to some function in the 
processing plugin under both win7 and win10 and qgis 2.14 and 2.18 (not 
under linux).
At the moment, I cannot say exactly where the problem is but I found 
that calling the runGdal function directly is a simple workaround.
Here a simple script as example, waiting for a final resolution of the 
issue:

from processing.algs.gdal.GdalUtils import GdalUtils
import os

class MYProgress():
     # Not necessary if you have the processing progress available in 
your script
     def setInfo(self,line):
         print line

     def setCommand(self,line):
         print line

     def setConsoleInfo(self,line):
         print line

tempOutput = 'D:/test_alg/map_to_clip.tif'
maskFN = 'D:/test_alg/mask.shp'
output = 'D:/test_alg/clipped_map.tif'

cmds = ["gdalwarp",
             "-dstnodata",
             "-9999",
             "-crop_to_cutline",
             "-cutline",
             maskFN,
             tempOutput,
             output]

progress = MYProgress()

GdalUtils.runGdal(cmds,progress)

# Delete the file
os.remove(tempOutput)

Hey all,

Maybe this has been raised before, but do we really need all the copyright
header stuff in the source files?  If they needed to make a source release
they could be added using a script.

I find it just fluff that clutters the files when I can't really see much
need.  We already have the licence file for the whole project and git
blame/log can tell you the history of the file.

I'm ok to leave them but also would be happy to see them go just to remove
fluff we don't need.

Regards,
Nathan

Here is the discussion that the GeoTools team had last year on this issue -
https://github.com/geotools/geotools/wiki/Updates-to-Copyright-Header-Policy
I think we got a legal opinion from OSGeo's lawyer but I can't find the
link quickly.

Yes, because this allows downstream distributors to review the license
copyright for the individual sources. The copyright for each file is not
the same as for the whole work, they have different copyright holders
and associated lifetime.

A script will not be able to determine whether the last change was
copyrightable (to set the copyright years and holders appropriately).

git is not an option for users of the tarball release.

Please leave them, and take licensing and copyright more seriously. In
case you don't care about copyright and Free Software licenses make all
your contributions in the public domain (using CC-0) to make this explicit.

Hi,

Tomorrow I'll be giving a Workshop about "Easy Programming QGIS with
Python for custom Expression Functions (EFns)" [1].

Question 1: Below you'll find an initial list I compiled where EFns
are used in QGIS Desktop. => Did I miss an occurrence?

Question 2: I tried to make a categorization for several reasons. One
reason for this is to realize that a EFn may not work outside QGIS
Desktop. Style-related EFns for example won't work currently in
qgis2web or QGISCloud. => Any comments?

Hi,
I may have overlooked your list but note that anytime you find a
data-defined override button, there's an expression dialog behind (using
the Edit option), and this button is spread over layer properties dialog
(style, diagram, label...) and composer items' options (almost all).
Processing algorithms also have the expression engine.

Some update of the official docs (though we didn't go through each dialog)
https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/expression.html

Hi Stefan,

Expressions also work in QGIS cloud (which is QGIS server based) - but 
Python based expressions don't work in QGIS server.

I have to say, however, that the QGIS core expressions are already quite 
powerful and I don't often have the need to create my own custom Python 
based expressions. I just recently had to use them - but that is the 
fist time after many years ;-)

What is your reason that you have to use Python based expression as 
opposed to the core built-in expressions?

Andreas

Good question! According to the workshop registrations quite some
other attendees seem to be interested too at least to know more about
this :-)

In the workshop we demonstrate custom Expression Functions (EFns) from
Nathan's plugin https://github.com/NathanW2/qgsexpressionsplus which
contains some useful functions missing in core like max_incremented()
aka auto-increment, hstore_get_key for fields with key-value pairs,
etc. Then we show get_address() in order to reverse geocode lat/lon to
an address,

Then think for example about a custom EFn (not yet implemented):
* env() which returns system environment variables;
* nullif() which turns empty strings to NULL (with build-in condition);
* which generates a fuzzy or scribbled boundary on the fly.
* etc.

One good reason is that it's a self-contained, achievable task for
users who are new with PyQGIS programming. You can teach this without
having to go into depth about plugin infrastructure/standalone
scripts/etc and instead concentrate on the basics of using the QGIS
python bindings. It's a good way for users to quickly gain confidence
in starting out with PyQGIS.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem: QGIS Reproject layer Transformation of
 Lambert North and South Costa Rica to CRTM05
Message-ID: <1494192699859-5319677.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi everyone!

Before creating a ticket in QGIS Issue Tracking, I wanted to consult you a
few things to be the most effective for when creating the ticket and to
carry all the necessary information.

I wanted to ask who maintains the algorithm "Reproject layer" of QGIS
provider which transformation method is used?

We have detected that in QGIS the transformation of vector layers from the
Coordinate System Lambert North or South for Costa Rica (obsolete official
projection of Costa Rica) to the current Official Projection that is CRTM05
has a transformation problem.

*the problem:* is when use the "Reproyect Layer" to reproject a vector layer
that is in the coordinate system  "Lambert North or South for Costa Rica" to
the coordinate system "CRTM05" a mismatches occurs from 8 meters up to 100 o
300 meters when the process is performed using the "Reproject layer"
algorithm of the QGIS provider in the processing toolbox.

We believe that this is because there is a problem with the Datum transfer
since Lambert North or South for Costa Rica is Local "Ocotepeque Clarke
1866" while CRTM05 is global "WGS84" for that reason we found necessary to
know how the trasnformation is programmed in QGIS for the Reproject Layer
algorithm. 

for the transformation we need to know if it is using the matrix of
"Molodensky Badekas" of 3 or 7 parameters, the ideal is that it is carried
out using the one of 7 parameters.

We have the necessary parameters For the matrix of 7 parameters which are: 

Parameters of transformation using the Molodensky Badekas matrix of 7
parameters for reproject CRS:
Ocotepeque 1935 / Lambert Costa Rica South EPSG:5457 and Ocotepeque 1935 /
Lambert Costa Rica North EPSG:5456 to CRTM05 EPSG:5367

PAR_X_AXIS_TRANSLATION, (-)213.116
PE_PAR_Y_AXIS_TRANSLATION, (-)9.358
PE_PAR_Z_AXIS_TRANSLATION, (+)74.946
PE_PAR_X_AXIS_ROTATION, (-)2.351418791 (Is enough with 4 decimals)
PE_PAR_Y_AXIS_ROTATION, (+)6.1466912E-02(Is enough with 4 decimals)
PE_PAR_Z_AXIS_ROTATION, (-)6.394208994(Is enough with 4 decimals)
PE_PAR_SCALE_DIFFERENCE, (+)5.22
PE_PAR_X_COORD_OF_ROTATION_ORIGIN (BARICENTRO),617749.7118
PE_PAR_Y_COORD_OF_ROTATION_ORIGIN (BARICENTRO),-6250547.7336
PE_PAR_Z_COORD_OF_ROTATION_ORIGIN (BARICENTRO),1102063.6099

These are the parameters for the transformation.

This will be enough to create the ticket in the QGIS Issue Tracking? Or will
more information be needed? Or explain the problem better?

Thanks for the help!

Eduardo :)

Re: qgis2web. Nathan enabled expressions with his fantastic qgs2js:
https://github.com/NathanW2/qgs2js. There are two ways in which its
implementation is incomplete, and I've worked to develop it when I can:

- only a small subset of functions have yet been coded,  and I'd be really
grateful for help writing more: see
https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/js/qgis2web_expressions.js

- this code is only called in a couple of locations (from memory, labels and
rules), so your list could be a huge help

Thanks once again to Nathan for the huge contribution

Hi

Can you check if this still happens on QGIS 2.99?

Nathan has been working on a new crash dialog that includes additional
information that can be added to an issue report. This information will
help us to fix such "hard to reproduce" issues.

Plus this way you can help to perform the pre-release testing that you
have been asking for :)

Tom

I wasn't aware of the qgis2js project. I have borrowed the expressions
code from qgis2web for our WebApp Builder, and was going to prepare a
PR to cotribute back some changes, since i have implemented quite a
few of the missing functions. See, for instance:

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-webappbuilder-plugin/commit/7fe6f8f894a070a12735f0f8d7ee0376d495d443

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-webappbuilder-plugin/commit/6828731a95ccd342c0189e42af0f30f15918b1a8

Should I do that against Nathan's repo? Looks like it has less
functions implemented than qgis2web, and you are not actually using it
as a library, but instead you added that code in your repo and are
improving it there. Maybe the qgis2js library should provide some way
of using it as a dependency, so it can be installed in the plugin
folder using pip, for instance, and then we can just work on the main
repo and all improvements will be ready easily for all projects using
it.

I will be happy to work on that, so let me know how i can help

Thanks!

Hi Victor

I did do a PR for my few local additions:

https://github.com/NathanW2/qgs2js/pull/2

It would be good to maintain it as an independent repo, if you can be
bothered to merge your additions back. Nathan, if you don't want to maintain
it, I'd be happy to take it over, or Victor could.

As for how I pull it in, I tried using a git submodule, but I couldn't get
it to work very well in all conditions (such as in Travis). That's why I
manually copied it in. If you have a better solution, do tell.

I'm reluctant to use eg pip, as it's a barrier to non-tech users. Anyway, I
know the question of plugin dependencies has been debated here before, and
I'm not sure a good solution was proposed.

Thanks

Tom

Hi Jörg,

You might want to try to add QCoreApplication.processEvents() after reading
the project.
Here is an example of a script playing with reading/editing/saving a
project using the API
https://github.com/qwat/QGEP-customizer/blob/master/customizer.py#L89

Good luck ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Per Project Python custom expressions in QGIS 3.0?
Message-ID: <b433e60d0afd8a9e15a7b33f8f0c3373@carto.net>

Hi, 

My recent custom Python expressions I developed. clearly belong to a
specific project and can't be used in the context of a different project
- because they rely on the presence of specific data layers. 

Question: could we introduce "per project" custom Python expresssions in
QGIS 3.0 as opposed to per user ones? The idea would be to store them in
the project file. This would make the deployment of the project much
easier, as I wouldn't have to also distribute the expression functions
to the users who want to use this specific project. 

Thanks for your feedback/discussion, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <c9578ff9-b951-c85e-b859-273acf9c7998@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Trying to create a rule based style I encountered/used the 'substr'
function to find the first character of a field.

Isn't it strange that this function is one based while in all languages
I know this kind of function(s) are zero-based?

now it is:
substr('Hello',0,1) returns ''
while I expected it to return 'H'
but:
substr('Hello',1,1) returns 'H'

in QGIS3 there is also:
substr('Hello',-1,1) returns 'o'  # ok

Are more functions one-based instead of (the normal?) zero-based?

Is it an idea to bring the expression(s) inline with other programming
languages?

Or is there a special reasoning not to do this?

Regards,

Richard

Hey,

Postgres, SQL Server, etc are all 1 based. Hence the alignment with that
logic.

I have a use-case in the same category: having a style with 2 custom
icons, I want to distribute the style (be it qml or sld) to people
INCLUDING those 2 svg icon files...

Was also thinking about 'merging' the svg into the project xml, but on
second thought we should maybe do have a thorough thinking about this...

I think this touches Nathan's profile work...

/start brainwave

Because actually a 'project file' contains often just a part (and not
all) of what you actually need to startup the full project?

Is it an idea to see a 'profile'-directory as a 'temporary' addition of
the QGIS-paths? Like the 'svg' directory in the profile to use is
temporarily added to the svg-paths environment (there by making those
two icons available to the user of this profile).

The same could be done for expressions (the expressions/pythons would be
temporarily available to the project because they are available in the
profile).

Maybe a project 'file' should actually be a (zipped) directory?

During 'Essen' we had a short discussion that it QGIS maybe could
benefit from some more clear 'definition' of terms like: what is exactly
a 'legend', 'datastore', 'connection', 'profile', 'layer' etc etc (as
part of the discussion 'one button to rule them all': is it a 'add layer
dialog' or a 'data manager' or 'datastore manager' or...

/stop brainwave

It is good to have some discussion about this here I think (instead of
patching it into current structures)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Continuing to work on some regressions on 2.18 (next LTR)

I'm working on https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15868 and I'm preparing
a patch for that. But it's a patch!
My colleague Giovanni Manghi hav stressed the patch and found other
errors (below). I wasn't able to reproduce, but as in #15868 this kind
of error can be generated breaking the binding lifecycle
(http://enki-editor.org/2014/08/23/Pyqt_mem_mgmt.html -
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/sip4/using.html#ownership-of-objects).

Is there a way to automaticaly scan the code and rise-up this kind of
sip binding errors?

this is different from the upstream error reported in
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15868, possibly (not really sure)
depending on your path because it shows when using a functionality
that works ok in the unpatched (core) version.

Steps:
open SQL Window
do the following query on a polygon layer (makes the proper
substitutions where necessary):

SELECT ST_Centroid(geom)
FROM tablename
WHERE attributename = 'attributevalue';

then activate the "load as new layer" chekbox and choose for for both
the "column with unique values" and "geometry column" the
"st_centroid" temp column created by the query.
now click on "load now" and check the log. On the unpatched version
the query layer (containing 1 point) is loaded in QGIS.

Prr... you are right. Strange... apparently never used it in Postgres...

Hi,

wanting to create a nice looking graph (widget) in QGIS, I wonder what
the options are, and if there is some common consensus on what is the
best option for the near future:

I know of (seen used in Mutant plugin):
- qwt
- mathplot lib
But these look a little crude...

Another option would be to create the graph(s) via javascript using some
kind of javascript lib and show the image or html in a web widget.
Or maybe even a create custom dedicated d3js widget?

Do 'we' (as the community) have a stand in this?
Is one option more future proof (for QGIS) then others?

Regards and thanks for any input,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

one change is to use the plotly library [0] that allows to create D3
like plots with python code.

I'm currently working an a plugin, not ready yest but might be in some
time ;)

Also Processing defaults plots are using plotly library since a while
(thanks to Alex)

Hoping it helps


Cheers

Hi Richard,

there is also http://plot.ly. They provide Python bindings and
allow to create HTML-based charts for offline use. Of course
this works for relatively small datasets, as all data exported
into output HTML file (with embedded JS).

Also Qt 5 provides Qt Charts library [0], maybe for C++ code
this is good choice. But I don't know if they available in Python.

This is an area I have been interested in and have had good intentions to
see if I could help with Matteo's work, but have never had the time. I
wrote the "D3 Data Visualization" plugin that produces a heat map that is
somewhat similar to the ArcGIS data clock. It would be nice to work
together to create an awesome graphs, charts, and data analysis.

Please keep me in the loop and if I can help out I will try to free up some
time.

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Troubles with Python init script for forms
Message-ID: <fbbf4d257d3eb1ca4c6d6f97e3c64d3d@carto.net>

Hi, 

It's been a long time since I last wrote python init scripts for forms. 

Now I have troubles writing even the simplest code. Nothing happens if I
click on a feature. The form opens, but no error messages and no
reaction to my code ... This is on QGIS 2.18.7. I use the mode "Provide
code in this dialog" and add the code in the "Python init code" widget
of the "Fields" tab. 

Below is my really simple code that should write something to the
message bar when the form is loaded: 

---------------------------------- 

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
QGIS-Formulare können eine Python-Funktion haben, die beim Öffnen des
Formulars gestartet wird. 

Hier kann dem Formular Extra-Logik hinzugefügt werden. 

Der Name der Funktion wird im Feld "Python-Init-Function" angegeben.
Ein Beispiel:
"""
from PyQt4.QtGui import QWidget

def my_form_open(dialog, layer, feature):
    msgBar = iface.messageBar()
    msgBar.pushInfo("Message from init script: ","Hi There") 

------------------------------------ 

My other question: 

If I change the code in the "Fields" widget - would it "auto-load" or do
I have to do something to trigger a reload of the script? 

-------------- 

Thank you for your help, 

Andreas

Hi, 

Problem solved. I forgot to specify the "Function Name" in the widget.
After doing that, it works fine. 

On the other issue: it seems like it "autoloads" the code every time I
did some changes in the code. So that seems to work well either.

Hi Richard,

You forgot about PyQtGraph used in MuTAnT tool ;)

But anyway - I myself am searching for a nice python graph library with
nice options and a nice style..
matplotlib is the most feature rich but unfortunately very slow (unless I
might probably use the code wrong)

I am following a lot of lib development closely and some time ago (about 3
years) some graphlib programmers decided to work together on one good lib

vispy (https://github.com/vispy/vispy)

But to me it seems that stopped again and everyone is again doing his own
lib (might only look to me as this - I dont know).
vispy would be the way to go for me - but it seems it is not prime time
ready yet. (and I might be wrong but I am still missing datetime
functionality)

So for MuTAnT it's still undecided (shame that PyQwt deceased for Qt5 - it
was by far the fastest).

For now I'd recommend PyQtGraph to use. (fast, good looking and feature
rich - though still also no timedate)
If you need everything there is still no way around matplotlib - maybe they
changed something in terms of speed with the now available version 2.. not
tested yet..

regards
Werner

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [attributetable] #15803 "Sort on Top" regression
	or feature ?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_rD=8thw=9kq4JbfosX_s-4+rBF0sbh24227oQoxQAaBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

***In short:
The sortOrder value in QgsProject section:

<attributetableconfig sortOrder="<some value>">

can be any value for some reason (e.g. flexibility for the future) or
it is a bug?

I would ask to especially to Nyall that git blames is the author of
this section:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsattributetableconfig.cpp#L200

***Details:
during hackmeeting I also worked on:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15803

in the team we had problem replicating the issue on QGIS 3.x so we
discovered that the origin of the problem is in
QgsAttributeTableConfig saved in Layer style section of the qgis
project.

here an example of a project I had with wrong values

      <attributetableconfig actionWidgetStyle="dropDown"
sortExpression="" sortOrder="158">
        <columns>
          <column width="-1" hidden="0" type="field" name="Cell"/>
          <column width="-1" hidden="0" type="field" name="Time"/>
          <column width="-1" hidden="0" type="field" name="Value"/>
          <column width="-1" hidden="1" type="actions"/>
        </columns>
      </attributetableconfig>

the value is casted to Qt:SortOrder enum with:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsattributetableconfig.cpp#L200

that is undefined in case sortOrder value does not belong to the enum
range, but in the implementation the value is leaved to 158 (as in the
example)

This generate some side effects in the attribute table => the
sortOnTop button does not work because of:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/attributetable/qgsattributetablefiltermodel.cpp#L53
and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/attributetable/qgsattributetablefiltermodel.cpp#L57

that obviously returns always false

The actual patch in:
2.18 - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4306
3.x - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4444

protect the attribute table from having wrong sortOrder values, but
does not try to fix it's value in AttributeTable config that can be a
value set for some reason by the user or other components.

***Workaroud
a simple workaround is apply a column sort and save the project to fix
the wrong value

Aprart from the libraries mentioned above, I believe for a future
proof code (QGIS >= 3) the choice should be the Qt Charts library. It
used to be distributed separately under commercial license, but since
Qt 5.8 (IIRC) it is included in standard Qt5 distribution with open
source license. This library has the advantage of being native to the
Qt ecosystem and it seems to be quite powerful as well.

Cheers

Thanks all for the libs and tips :-)

@Martin: I will have a look at Qt-graph, I think it is best to keep
close to our core libs. But not sure if it will soon be available in
repo's/distro's including the python bindings.

Besides this I'm doing this as part of a larger QGIS 2.x plugin, so will
eventually probably have to use both ways.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I agree that (Py)QtChart is the way to go. Recently I did some proof of
concepts starting from this simple example:

Hey Tom and Victor,

I'm happy for you to do whatever want with qgis2js. I can give you full
repo write access if you wish to improve it.  I mainly started it to help
Tom and it kind of turned into a cool side project but I don't have any
real use for it.

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GPS Stream Plugin Crashing QGIS
Message-ID: <042a01d2c8d5$48af4140$da0dc3c0$@gmail.com>

Greetings Everyone,

 

I'm playing around with a plugin that's supposed to receive GPS Data over a
TCP socket and then once a new point is received the Vector Memory/Scratch
Layer has all features removed and a new Point feature added. I have a
worker thread running that processes the incoming TCP socket data (rate of
about 10 Hz) and then runs a function called addPoint. Currently the plugin
works great if I don't call addPoint and just print the contents of the
received message. Once I add in the addPoint function, however, the plugin
works for a bit (30-60 seconds) and then QGIS crashes.

 

My addPoint function is as follows:

 

    def addPoint(self, point):

        self.layer.startEditing()

        caps = self.layer.dataProvider().capabilities()

        if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.DeleteFeatures:

            for feat in self.layer.getFeatures():

                self.layer.deleteFeature(feat.id())

        if caps & QgsVectorDataProvider.AddFeatures:

            feat = QgsFeature(self.layer.pendingFields())

            feat.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(point))

            (res, outFeats) = self.layer.dataProvider().addFeatures([feat])

        self.layer.commitChanges()

 

Perhaps the issue is because I'm entering/exiting Edit mode so often (10
Hz)? Is there a more efficient method to accomplish what I'm doing? Or maybe
it's some sort of threading conflict?

 

Thanks,

 

Josh Q

Hi,

example of raster single band renderer in pyqgis cookbook [1] is based
on predefined list of color rules items. Is it possible to generate
rules items automatically from defined min&max values, number of
classes, and classification mode (same when user clicks on 'Classify'
button)?

Thanks, Martin

Message-ID: <1494351917280-5319952.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

An issue I face is different users' different GDAL versions meaning making
Processing GDAL calls in a plugin difficult, as you have to get the
arguments right:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/v2.17.0/utils.py#L314

I've got these different argument lists wrapped in try: blocks, but was
wondering if a different approach might be better. If I call, for example,
processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject") without arguments from the
console, I get an error back:

Error: Wrong number of parameters
ALGORITHM: Warp (reproject)

	1 - YES
	2 - NO

Can I rely on getting this kind of output from all GDAL versions? If so, I
can try to figure out the best way to parse out the arguments it needs, and
supply them.

Should this work?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Luigi,

Thanks for the detailed report. I think there are two different things
to fix

 1. XML Loading: the static_cast should be accompanied by a validity check
 2. Fix the reason for 158 ever appearing (might just be a default value
    assigned to mSortOrder in qgsattributetableconfig.h)

There's not much reason for flexibility here as far as I can tell, this
just reflects the Qt::SortOrder enum. If required, we can add additional
new flags for "SortOrderCaseSensitivity" and whatever might appear in
the future.

I hope that helps,
Matthias

Hi Richard,

If you target QGIS 3, you might also go with a plain QML approach which
is available as of Qt 5.3 which should be available on any distro where
QGIS 3 is shipped.

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickwidget.html#details

QtCharts is built on the same foundation, so you can get to the same
results. It just needs a bit more boilerplate code.

Hi Giovanni,

I'm sneaking into this thread...
On a linux machine and QGIS master, Processing reads only 1 algorithm of
SAGA. Current version of SAGA installed is 2.3.1

On sourceforge [0] I now see that SAGA version 4 (?!?) is already
available. As I remember Processing will support the LTR version of
SAGA... I'm confused on which version is (or will be) the LTR..


If the version supported by Processing is different from the one
provided by the repositories (in my case 2.3.1) do I need to compile the
correct version by myself or in future the LTR version will be included
in the repo and packages?

Thanks for any clue!

Cheers

Matteo

Hi devs,

recently the R provider has been removed from Processing. I did not
understand if R will be still available in Processing but it needs to be
activated like an external plugin or not.

Sorry if I miss some discussion about this topic

Thanks!

1) is already in the related PR
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/QGIS/commit/cae124acea62b3d387586e3c1619144a3c12b150,
btw more controls will be added on restrict SortOrder values.
2) hmmm... constructor start with the correct AscendingMode... someone
(a plugin or the core code or a bug) do
attributeTableConfig().sortOrder(<wrong value>). There are some wrong
set in ComposerAttributeTable, but I don't think it's the origin of
the problem

In QGIS master (will be 3.0) there is
QgsSingleBandPseudoColorRenderer::createShader(...) method to do that,
however in 2.x that code is not accessible through API... you could
however still port the underlying classification code to your plugin:

the same on Windows/osgeo4w. And on Windows 2.3.1 is also broken on
2.18.7 that is far worst now (but 2.1.2 should still work fine).

SAGA is fast moving (as you say there is already a version 4) and we
know that frequently the name of tools or parameters are changed in
between versions, and this of course has proven very difficult for us
to keep the description files updated.

They have now a LTR version (I think is 2.3.*) and I personally don't
see any alternative for us if not sticking with it.

Linux users (I'm also a Linux user) will have to ask packagers to add
a saga ltr package to their distribution or find a way to
install/compile saga LTR in their systems.

cheers!

In case anyone is interested, I've got a version of this approach working
now:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/commit/6980a108bc8803c7907bb3ca7da90b1fdfc59a69

Needs testing, but works locally and under Travis.

ok, now is clear. The problem is upstream in packaging..

Thanks for the info!

Hi

in GDAL list [1], devs started to parse GDAL code by a google service
to find automatically program errors.
I didn't dig into the tool and I don't know if QGIS match requirement
to be parsed.

oss-fuzz doesn't parse source code, but runs test programs that wrap the library 
functions to test and feed them with fuzzed inputs. So this is useful to stress test code 
that can accept arbitrary data. In QGIS that could be WKB parsers, data providers, etc...
Note that a rather annoying constraint is that all the code must be statically linked (see 
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/25)

I am starting to take a look at converting Lat Lon Tools to work with QGIS
3. I see mentioned to not do the following with imports:

from qgis.core import *

What is the best way to find out what routines are actually used?

Thanks,

Hi,
Good point, I did a lot of try / error and search in my plugin. Maybe this
can help: https://docs.python.org/2/library/modulefinder.html ?

Remove the line completely, run the plugin, and then individually add the
modules as they show up as errors. It doesn't take too long.

Is it better to do an import as

from PyQt4 import QtGui

and then in the code use QtGui.QDialog

or is it better to use

from PyQt4.QtGui import QDialog

Sorry if this is an obvious question. I have been a C/C++/perl programmer
for many years, but just started python about a year and a half ago.

Thanks

this is a slide about plugin porting I'll be presenting to the next
spanish foss4g:
http://slides.com/luigipirelli/desdarrolloplugindeqgis-xi-girona#/17
sorry it's in spanish

about

from PyQt4 import QtGui

or

from PyQt4.QtGui import QDialog

I would prefer the second so to avoid to postpone lib version errors
at pyc time and not at runtime.
it make it simpler to mock or alias a class globally if you need

regards
Luigi Pirelli

Hello all,

Following what was discussed in Essen hackfest about the unified Add Layer
tool (described in the end of this document
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMX9jOfl10q8oETRzOHSHnRpHCc7UJ1dDnCCq3VyTAY/edit?usp=sharing>),
I'm happy to inform that Boundless decided to allocate resources to
implement the Step 1.

"Step 1: Add a tabbed view to the existing browser (vertical column in the
following mockup). The default view is the basic browser. The remaining
tabs open the existing dialog UIs embedded inside the browser window."

As decided, we will have a PR in time for 3.0.

Alexandre

​That is great news! Thank you for the update Alexandre!

If you have any updates to share in the meantime, I'm sure the community
would appreciate to hear how this work advances.

I am wondering how important it is to import the modules separately. Such
as:

from qgis.core import QGis, QgsCoordinateTransform, QgsRectangle, QgsPoint,
QgsGeometry

Does it really make a difference? I am finding that you have to make sure
every part of your code is exercised so that nothing was missed. By doing
the above there is more of a chance to have a bug. Perhaps for PyQt4.QtGui
it makes sense, but there is less chance to have a python error if you keep.

from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from qgis.gui import *

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 2 vs 3 Plugin Problem in plugins.qgis.org
Message-ID: <CABPxTTq3o0jjdk_aSmVraT_ibKiUWRcrZoFZ80=8uL65yaV87A@mail.gmail.com>

I am a little concerned about the fact that when plugin developers have
QGIS 2 plugins and then create a QGIS 3.x version and upload it to
plugins.qgis.org, the plugin no longer shows up in QGIS 2 when you select
"Plugins->Manage and Install Plugins..." An example of this is the Plugin
Reloader.

I guess QGIS is looking at the latest version only and since the plugin
specifies a minimum version of 2.99 it simply does not show up. You have to
manually download and install the QGIS 2 version.

For QGIS 2 users, if they are using QGIS to search for "Plugin Reloader",
they wont even know that it exists. I think this is going to be more and
more of a problem as more developers create 3.x only plugin versions. Is
there a way to solve this problem? If you are running QGIS 2 have it
display the proper 2.x release and QGIS 3 have it display the 2.99+ release.

Thanks!

Calvin

Hi Calvin,

Here are some thoughts on python imports:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports

The last paragraph is about using wildcards.

I generally avoid wildcard imports. Two additional reasons not to use them:

- When you use the wildcard form it is harder for other people (and for
yourself in the future) to know just what it is that you are actually
importing. As such, debugging eventual errors takes more time.

- wildcard imports also increase the chance of having name clashes and of
hiding functions with identical names.

It doesn't make a difference for QGIS 3 itself. If you write new code
from scratch using wildcard imports on PyQt5, it will just work the way
it has worked in QGIS 2.

The point is, that some classes have been moved between modules from
PyQt4 to PyQt5 (e.g. all widgets from QtGui to QtWidgets).
The migration tool 2to3 can help with this - but only if the imports are
fully qualified.

There are other ways to upgrade your code than 2to3, the advantage of
the proposed approach is that it makes your code closer to "best
practice" - but it's up to you to decide.

And just to be clear:

in metadata.txt something like:

qgisMinimumVersion=1.8
qgisMaximumVersion=2.99

makes it ONLY show up in QGIS 2.x
mmm, maybe 2.98 should be better as 2.99 is our 3.0 developement
branch... but THIS works :-)

and something like:

qgisMinimumVersion=2.99
qgisMaximumVersion=3.99

makes it ONLY show up in QGIS 3.x (and current 2.99 3.0 branch)

Richard

Hey,

Yes if you are needing speed you should avoid going via the edit buffer in
the layer.  You should get the data provider off the layer once and then
just call the delete, update, add feature methods on there. It will avoid
the edit buffer and commit overhead that you get and no doubt are running
into.

What is the main goal of the incoming data?  Just display or do you need to
store it in the layer?   If it is just displayed you can use a map canvas
item and just update the point on the screen. They are rendered above the
map and don't cause a map layer refresh.   I have a blog post on it if you
need or there is small sample ones around the place.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer]  Running QGIS 2.18 and QGIS 3 together?
Message-ID: <CAFYjFH_8rLtO=JkLG2JS0B8a1xkZp5P6tSO8YOi3VziqxC-kOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm currently running QGIS 2.18.7 on a Win64bit machine, which I installed
using OsGeo4W Network Installer (32bit).
I recently installed the 2.99dev version and I encountered this error when
trying to start QGIS 3:

"Impossible to find the entry point [...] qwt.dll"

After a quick search, I found it in two different paths (as expected):

Path1: 'C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qwt.dll'

Path2: 'C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Qt5\bin\qwt.dll'

I know that this issue can be solved by renaming it in the proper location,
so I renamed the .dll file in the Path1 and, as expected, QGIS 3 WORKED
without any problem.

However, now the problem is reversed: I'm able to run QGIS 3, but I can't
run QGIS 2.18.7 anymore unless I rename again the .dll file in the Path1.
Is there a way for having both QGIS versions working without always
renaming the .dll file?

I want to remark that the "renaming procedure" allows running only one QGIS
version, while I wish to work with both of them (I'm quite sure I
didn't consider some simple workaround!).

Best regards,
Marco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC introduction: QGIS Desktop web service
	plugin+Notebook use cases
Message-ID: <CALufGKKvvoqBpNp-UgGjwkKJfXGqX3M1Vq5peCuZWSkJHNEz2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was selected to implement a project for QGIS as part of this year's
Google Summer of Code, so I thought I'd introduce myself (and my
project) to the list:

The project is about developing a slim plugin for QGIS Desktop which
exposes the visualisation and processing functions of a running QGIS
instance via a simple programming language-independent web service
interface which can be used as a sort of programmatic 'remote
control'. One motivation behind the idea was to give direct access to
QGIS' map styling tools to GIS-savvy but otherwise 'mapping-deficient'
(and generally interaction-poor) programming languages, in particular
R (see also https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2016-August/024817.html)

The project also covers fleshing out some specific use cases that show
how the plugin can be used to integrate QGIS into an automatic report
generation workflow. The approach of having data processing+analysis
code+documentation all in one file has been made popular by
technologies such as Jupyter notebooks and Rmarkdown, and I'm hoping
to demonstrate how this approach can be extended to GIS analyses which
combine QGIS functionality with that of other geoprocessing libraries
and data sources in a fully automated workflow.

About myself: while I have a background in software engineering, my
interaction with GIS software has so far been limited to casual/hobby
projects. I've been toying with map creation based on
mapnik/OSM/PostGIS, so far using QGIS for visualisation/data
exploration rather than processing. I therefore also expect to learn a
lot of new things through the project, in particular getting a better
insight into the breadth of use cases that are of interest to GIS
professionals!

Best,
Kevin

Hi,
I'm starting with qgis plugin development on ubuntu-based Mint OS (v 18.1
Serena). I created a very simple form in Qt Designer 4.8.7 and tried to
convert it to python file with

pyuic4 -d form.ui -o form.py

This results in

Traceback (most recent call last):

If I change /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/PyQt/QtCore.py line 28 to
sip.setapi(api, 1), it works, QGIS starts with a following message though:

Couldn't load PyQGIS.

Python version:

QGIS version:

What exactly do I have to do to make the both sides work?

Hello Michal,

I've also had this error some times ago, I do not remember if I succeed 
with pyuic4, nor the solution.

But IMHO it is simpler to load "ui" files at runtime.
Here is an example from "processing" plugin :

import os
from qgis.PyQt import uic

pluginPath = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(__file__))[0]
WIDGET, BASE = uic.loadUiType(
     os.path.join(pluginPath, 'ui', 'DlgConfig.ui'))

class ConfigDialog(BASE, WIDGET):


=> no need to run make or similar to create python files each time you 
change something in your ui files.

load the plugin from the source folder (create a symbolic link from home 
QGIS plugins dir to plugin source dir)
change something in the ui file
reload the plugin using "plugin reloader" and you immediately see the 
result in QGIS.

Hi all,

Even Rouault has proposed a solution to fix the issue:

```

The issue can be more simply reproduced when just doing "from osgeo 
import gdalnumeric" and exiting the Python console.

This doesn't look like a fundamental flow of GDAL on Windows, since when 
using miniconda, or when building myself GDAL (with VS 2010 express, 64 
bit), I don't have this issue.

For the record, my build recipee for the python bindings

  * install Python 2.7.12 64bit
  * pip install numpy ==> install numpy 1.11.2
  * set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
  * set MSSdk=1
  * cd gdal/swig/python
  * python setup.py build

```
Do you think the QGIS package for Windows could be fixed with this ?

Thanks,
René-Luc D'Hont

Message-ID: <b03f7d6f-a2df-a032-b64b-14455ca9ecb7@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
with QGIS 2.18, when inserting records in a versioned view, created with
DB Manager, I receive an error:

ERROR: cannot perform
INSERT RETURNING on relation "version_current"

HINT: You need an unconditional ON INSERT DO INSTEAD rule with a
RETURNING clause.

The same operation on the same view works smoothly on QGIS 2.14.
Could anyone confirm the regression?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

QGIS 2.18 expects a view to return the newly created row including
values generated server side. This way the primary key of a newly
created feature can directly be used (e.g. to set the foreign key of
another feature).

So, this is definitely a feature and not a bug ;)

What you can do

 - Update the views to RETURN the new record ([1])

 - Find a way to determine if a view/table returns something, so we can
    conditionally only request this when it really is available

 - Propose a different approach / better solution

Sorry for the inconvenience
Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Remaining "blocking" operations
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash_c=2OaNOXcn=Q5uttY-BKiYW_3mvBgTiKkVjkgfhoxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

With a recent PR merge by Matthias, another one of the remaining
interface blocking operations is gone and moved to task manager. This
means that task manager is now being used for:
- saving vector/raster layers
- importing data to browser destinations via drag and drop
- saving maps as rasters/pdf from canvas (not composer)
- calculating feature counts for layer tree

There's also been some recent changes in composer which prevents the
interface blocking while refreshing map item, and a funded change by
the Swiss user group which dramatically decreases project load times
while compositions are present

With these changes QGIS master is feeling extremely responsive. So now
I'm wondering what other "blocking" operations remain in master.

A quick list off the top of my head:
- updating the snapping index
- exporting compositions/atlases
- running processing algs (work underway to fix this)
- calculating categorized/graduated renderer classes for large layers

What have I missed? What other tasks currently "lock up" the QGIS
interface while performing?

Nyall

Hi,
that looks like an interesting workaround! What are the pitfalls? Don't you
need to see the real python code when developing?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] multi-layered pdf, attribute support in pdf outputs
Message-ID: <1494569921574-5320273.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello everyone, 

i am wondering whether it is going to be possible to generate multi-layered
pdfs using print composer anytime soon. While GDAL supports that QGIS does
not seem to do so yet. For making maps available to the public it would be
practival to implement layer attributes within pdf (similarly to ArcGIS). Is
this technically possible using GDAL?

Thanks, 
hilpers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Support for "segments" in the QgsGeometryAnalyzer
	buffer function
Message-ID: <193ba32a-e7af-21df-6fee-476ff9f04e5e@nmbu.no>

Dear QGIS developers,

Giovanni Manghi encouraged me to raise this in the dev
list.

The QgsGeometry buffer function has two parameters:
distance (double) and segments (int).
"distance" is used to specify the buffer distance.
"segments" is used to specify the number of straight
line segments used to approximate a quarter circle.

The QgsGeometryAnalyzer buffer function makes only the
"distance" parameter available.

In Feature request #15905
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15905) I have suggested
that the "segments" parameter is made in the
QgsGeometryAnalyzer buffer function.

To me this seems like a trivial change, and I have
created a pull request to demonstrate it
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4302).

Are there any reasons for not having the segments
parameter available in the QgsGeometryAnalyzer buffer
function?
Could curved geometry have anything to do with it?

Hi, I (or we) also use the same method as Arnaud.

The only drawback is you can’t get the autocomplete from the python file (from the ui file). But the benefit is greater: no need to ship generated python code, no need to compile every time we change the .ui file. The development is faster now.

I don’t think we need to see the generated python code from the .ui file.

You can see here for the utilities method : https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/safe/utilities/resources.py#L107 <https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/safe/utilities/resources.py#L107>

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] multi-layered pdf,
 attribute support in pdf outputs
In-Reply-To: <1494569921574-5320273.post@n6.nabble.com>
References: <1494569921574-5320273.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi Hilpers, 

I'll explain why this isn't so easy to solve - even with GDAL. 

QGIS has a very rich set of symbology and labeling options. For PDF
generation it relies on the qt libraries - which did not support
attributes and layered PDFs so far - at least in version 4 that QGIS
used so far. I don't know if qt5 improved in that respect. GDAL/OGR has
a quite limited set of feature styling options. There is no easy
translation between the two - and in 95% of the cases your map would
look different when translating to OGR/GDAL - unless you rasterize all
layers - which is probably not what you want. 

So unless either qt supports output in layered PDF and supports
attributes, it won't happen any time soon. Alternatively, QGIS could use
an alternative PDF library, which probably isn't trivial either. 

Unless someone would heavily invest in development time or money, or
better both - this probably won't happen. 

Your best option would be to try to improve qt5, so that it supports
layered PDFs and attributes or try to switch to a different PDF renderer
- not sure how feasible that would be.

I think that having this will fill one of the major gaps we have now
in comparison with proprietary packages, and I'm really looking
forward to start test it.

Thanks!

Hi Nyall,

Loving it, this makes QGIS so much more pleasant to use.

One thing that is not related technologically but the thing the most
often freaks me out:

Having to click out of a bazillion connection dialogs when a PG server
is not available. I wonder if there's anyone else who regularly is
affected by this.

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS: how to retrieve symbolLayers in renderPass
	order
Message-ID: <1494589319018-5320327.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I need to get a list of symbolLayers, but in renderPass order. In other
words, in default order if symbol levels are not enabled, or in symbol level
order if they are.

Can I do that via the API, or do I just have to retrieve the renderPass
value for every symbolLayer and then sort the symbolLayers in a new step in
my script?

Thanks

Tom

Hi,

we've been working on fixing a few bugs on the attribute table for 2.18 and
master:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16492
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15803
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15974

The patches should land soon in the latest builds of master and 2.18.x

If anybody could test the attribute table for regressions or slowdowns that
might have been inadvertenly introduced that would be highly appreciated.

Thanks!

With the OSGeo4W installer I see that 2to3 is located at

C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Tools\scripts\2to3.py

It made some changes but does not seem to migrate PyQt4 to PyQt5. What am I
doing wrong? I just tried running this on one of my files in this manner
from the OSGeo4W Shell.

python C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Tools\scripts\2to3.py -w copyLatLonTool.py

Thanks!!!

Message-ID: <CABPxTTrKrrX61rJF4uWm1r==CWJqEzOD2cZU6nb4mvGmR73GGg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is another problem I have encountered converting a plugin from QGIS 2
to 3.

In my plugin I want to automatically create a point layer and have the
point labeled. Here is how I used to do it:

            label = QgsPalLayerSettings()
            label.readFromLayer(ptLayer)
            label.enabled = True
            label.fieldName = 'label'
            label.placement= QgsPalLayerSettings.AroundPoint

label.setDataDefinedProperty(QgsPalLayerSettings.Size,True,True,'9','')
            label.writeToLayer(ptLayer)

In QGIS 3 setDataDefinedProperty() is no longer a method. It looks like it
has been replaced with setDataDefinedProperties()

How do I set the font size in QGIS 3 similar to what I was doing in QGIS 2?

Thanks!!!

Some example directly from the qgis source code,

https://qgis.org/api/qgssymbol_8cpp_source.html#l01304

generally speaking, in this transitional phase, the source code is the
preferred documentation.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS: how to retrieve symbolLayers in
	renderPass order
In-Reply-To: <1494589319018-5320327.post@n6.nabble.com>

In the absence of such a method, I'm doing this:

symbolLayers = {}
for i in xrange(symbol.symbolLayerCount()):
    sl = symbol.symbolLayer(i)
    if renderer.usingSymbolLevels():
        k = sl.renderingPass()
    else:
        k = i
    symbolLayers[k] = sl
stackedSLs = sorted(symbolLayers.iterkeys())

I think it works:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/commit/c5f4d457d32057ab6b6f56abab49d24008d20732

If anyone has a better method, do let me know.
    
Thanks

Tom

I was thinking about the DB Manager, when we launch a SQL query. Having an
option to stop the query would be very nice (like PgAdmin where you can see
the elapsed time and a button to stop the query etc)

Hello Richard,

I was wondering if you were able to address the 'make' issue? I am trying to
create a plugin and usually I run the make command in the OSGeo4W Shell, but
this time it's not recognised.

Thanks in advance

For use in models it is sometimes useful to generate a boolean output from
a processing script. Since boolean is not available as output, what would
be a good workaround ?
I am simply using string as output type:
output=str(False)
but then the receiving script has to work a bit on that input and it is
awkward to type 'True' if the input script is used standalone.

Of course, the real question is why boolean is not offered as output type ?
To me it would be useful.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] sharing processing models/scripts
Message-ID: <CAKdk67sFENKRZzJnosnZtcaQebihWWUAezT+Hv5dhPYaEsG-gA@mail.gmail.com>

There are multiple ways to to publish and advertise a collection of
processing scripts and models:

1) as a 'Resource': https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Resources
2) as an official downloadable script/model:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing
3) as a processing script collection plugin:
http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/processing.html#id2
4) manual downloading and adding:
https://github.com/andreasplesch/QGIS-X3D-Processing

There advantages and drawbacks for each:

1) less well known since it requires installation of the Resource Sharing
plugin. Does not support processing models. Potential to be in core.
Potentially easy to add another collection.
2) no obvious policy for acceptance into repo. Some PRs are not accepted.
Lack of substructure, just one large pool. Direct access from Toolbox.
Supports models.
3) does not support models. Plugins are well understood extension mechanism
by users. Built in infrastructure (updates, web site)
4) Inconvenient for users. Hard to discover. Full control. Transparent.

The lack of model support in some options can be worked around by
converting models into scripts.

4) will be available in most cases anyways if developers use a public site.

I think my preference is 3), eg. packaging as Plugin.

What are other considerations ? Practical experience or preference ?

Any feedback or comment much appreciated,

Andreas

Hi all,
a new major version of OTB has been released. In the meantime, the OTB
provider has been removed from Processing on master.
Does anyone have a plan to keep the (very important IMHO) QGIS-OTB
integration working?
I'm available for help if necessary.
All the best, and thanks.

Thanks Rashad for your prompt reply. I think Victor, Alex, and Nyall
(who is refactoring Processing for QGIS 3 and porting it to C++) are in
the best position to reply.
>From my point of view, I think I'll interpret the feelings and needs of
thousands of users saying that we cannot miss OTB from Processing. Same
for R, this has been raised recently on the mailing list.
I think the steps are:
* create an independent provider (sub-plugin of Processing) for OTB
* publish it on the official repo.
Rashad, would you be willing to take ownership of that plugin?
All the best, and thanks again.

I think OTB team as a whole would be glad to take ownership of that 
plugin. Then we could add updates of the plugin tour release process and 
ensure that it is always fresh and working. If this is ok four you, let 
us know how to proceed.

Also, we have OTB users days 6-8 june @Toulouse, France, I think I 
rembember that Victor lives not so far from Toulouse, so he is (as well 
as anyone else who whants to join) most welcome to discuss this matter 
with dev team and users.

Regards,

Julien

Great news, thanks.
AFAICT the first step is creating the subplugin, taking the removed code
from Processing. Probably Alex and/or Victor could give a hint on how to
best do this.

All the best.

Hi

The repo with the plugin already extracted and prepared is in here

https://github.com/volaya/qgis-otb-plugin

IT hasn't been published in the plugin repo, though. I think the OTB
team was ready to take ownership, so if anyone tells me the user name
or group that will accept it, i will transfer this.

The OTB user days sounds great, but unfortunately, I will not be at
home during those days (there is the spanish foss4g on 1-2 june, and i
will stay in Spain after that to visit my family). In any case, we can
set up a meeting and i can go to meet the OTB team in Toulouse in a
different date.

Let me know what I can do to move the repo ownership, so we can have
the OTB plugin released ASAP

About the R provider, we are in the same situation. The plugin is in
Alex's github account, but if anyone from the R community wants to
take ownership and take care of managing and releasing it, I guess we
can move it.

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Postgis loading using COPY instead of INSERTS?
Message-ID: <CABgOYCf5viP2cV1bhnUPD=TgcBBOcGPA_W-4Ego1MhhYN1aH5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I realized that QGIS only loads datasets to Postgres using INSERT commands,
which is very slow for big tables, and could propose to use COPY commands
with a parameter to choose how many rows are sent in each bulk COPY
command. (see [0])

I tested drag and drop in browser and dbmanager (in 2.18.7 and master) and
 couldn't find anything about that in the issues or the code base.

Did I miss something? Is there someone working in that area?

Thanks for your lights

Hi,

I suggest not to rush with releasing and publishing any of the plugins.
Please don't forget that QGIS 2.14, 2.16 and 2.18 still have all providers
built in. For master I personally don't see any benefits in releasing
Processing providers right now. These plugins will be broken most of the
time as Processing suffers from major refactoring, QGIS API also is not
stablized yet.

As Victor said, if someone wants to take ownership on R provider, I wlll be
happy to move it. Otherwise I will try to do my best to keep it working.

Just my 2c.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] how to find all features from original data in
	filtered layer
Message-ID: <4de750c7442f5a3bd579416508d31494@duif.net>


I have a TimeManager-handled layer, meaning a layer which has a filter 
on it based on a attribute 'time'. So the layer has a subsetString.

Say, the total hour based dataset is 24 hour, so I see 1 hour at a time 
(using TimeManager)

BUT now I want to select all features from the original/whole dataset 
based on another attribute (usecase: select 1 feature and find others 
based on the value of one attribute of that feature, and show the count 
in total set).

I tried something like:

l=iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
request = QgsFeatureRequest()
request.disableFilter()
it = l.getFeatures( request.setFilterExpression( u'"device" = 
\'NL1212\'' ) )
i=0
for f in it:
     i += 1
     print "{} {}".format(i, f['gml_id'])

But still I get just 1 result.

Looking into the api I found: 
layer.dataProvider().featureSource().getFeatures(), but that already has 
the subsetString set

Anybody a clue or workaround (loading the data a second time in a hidden 
layer??)

Regards,

Richard

This is good to know. On github, I saw that there are plans to move the
plugin into core but it was not clear if there was a decision or how far
the idea progressed.

+1M

not having the possibility to stop (without having to kill QGIS) long
queries and having the SQL blocking the main QGIS GUI is really a very
bad user experience compared to other tools that allow do the same
operations (ex. PGAdmin).

thanks for this. I understand it may still be early for coding, unless
people @OTB have plans to support OTB6 also on 2.18 (if this is not too
complicated). I think it would however be good to start with the basics:
creating the repo/transferring owneship, etc.
In this way the work can start soon after the API have reasonably
stabilized (I imagine around June or July).
All the best.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTrvoFOkb9XRQDZG7xLV33TQoR0HwdzbaM6LYtFsehOa-g@mail.gmail.com>

I was able to successfully convert Lat Lon Tools to work with QGIS 3. The
code for QGIS 2 and 3 are incompatible so is it best to keep two parallel
developments going and to keep the release number for the QGIS 2 version at
the 0.8.x and start the release number for QGIS 3 at 1.0.0 and continue to
release both to the same plugin repo? What is the best practice?

Until QGIS 3 is officially released I probably won't release the QGIS 3
plugin as often as the QGIS 2 plugin.

Thanks!!!

I'll probably do exactly that. v3.x for QGIS3, continue with v2.x for QGIS2.

Message-ID: <20170516070055.GA5443@localhost>

Hi Giovanni.
I'm starting with the 2.18 bugfix work and have been told to use this
document as a list of priorities to be fixed:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1frZQU8bwGX499WMvtOc6GDIWqEuSv3QHz3zc90TS46Q/edit#gid=0

As it isn't easy to tell which of those bugs is being already worked
on, can that list be obtained via redmine (https://issues.qgis.org) ?
That way I could add a filter to add "unassigned" condition.

Ciao Sandro,

c'é un thread ufficiale in lista PSC nel quale comunicare la volontá di
lavorare su qualche ticket,
cin sono anche i link diretti ai dticket per vedere se un developer ha
aggounto qualche commento, si é aseegnato
il ticket o l'ha taggato come "in progress".

Se hai intenzione di partecipare in questo sforzo gentilmente ti chiderei
di guardare

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15962 (che il "merge" di vari ticket simili)

(e ce  ne sono altri su difference e altre operazioni di geiprocessamento,
se vuoi te li linko). Nel 2017
é imbarazzante che QGIS ancora faccia operazioni di geoprocessamento che
praticmente non avvisano gli utenti (il log mi spiace "non conta"
per il 90% degli user) quando il risulltato puó sbagliato e semplicemente
danno silenziosamente risultati sbagliati.
É una cosa tra l'altro *pericolosa*, io per esempio per colpa di questa
simpatica "feature" sono quasi finito in tribunale (si certo... il sw non é
garantito...ma le firme alla  fine dei lavori, quelli veri, ci vogliono lo
stesso).

parlando di questo argomento alcuni dev mi hanno risposto con un "junk in,
junk out" che é ovvimente una cazzata di dimensioni planetarie.

grazie in anticipo per quello che potrai/vorrai fare.


Ciao

Users of QGIS 2.x don't need separate plugin as OTB and all
other providers are part of Processing.

That's right. Gui will remain in python. Algs will mostly be python,
unless they benefit from the speed boost of the native c++ code. All
the algorithms which rely on external apps will remain Python.

If anyone's curious, here's a video demonstrating the current state of the work:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DIAc6ATOh0&feature=youtu.be

Not much to get excited about from an end user's perspective yet, but
what you see here is:
- a native buffer algorithm, fully written in c++
- background algorithm execution using task manager
- the new API which uses a dictionary of algorithm parameters
- a demo of dynamic property based parameters (will be exposed via the
UI just like data defined symbols/labels/etc)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] editbuffet::commitChanges limitations found
	working on #15741... suggestions?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_qD=13OL7Vnu-Jiq=RAj==PurW3bbrYPMbPewi=pPgkDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi (especially MarcoH)

Analysis:
working on #15741 [1] I found that the the issue is comes mainly from
the following commit:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8d70a5141b0f56c40fc19e32d5d55475e22ec10f
and secondary from:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/7b64feb7e101ac7f205737dce241c9d8fa03c452#diff-989db6afac5dc91e42cf6d3e404431b3L6656
that do a better cleanup of the previous commit.

btw these commits just allowed to raise a limitation of the:
QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer::commitChanges [2] class (see doc [3])
commitChanges is a multi staged commit task with a limitation, each
stage, if success, clean it's stage buffer => if can be recovered if
one of the next stages fail.

This is exactly what happen in the issue. Merge Features is done doing:

1) deleted features to merge
2) add the new merged feature

stage 2 will fail (due the fact that if postgis layer is linestring,
the merged is multi type => incompatible). but failing the roll back
(done aborting the editing session) rollback only the stage 2, because
stage 1 was success and cleaned from editBuffer.

Splutions:
There is no a unique solution. These are the options:
1) revert or partially revert the above  commit
8d70a5141b0f56c40fc19e32d5d55475e22ec10f
2) don't clean the stage buffers, and do them only if no error is
found (opening to other regressions)
3) refactor editing buffer (would make sense integrating
QgsTransaction and QgsTransactionGroups where possible)... but IMHO
out of the scope of a bug fix
4) anything else?

I would prefer (my personal style) for a soft solution (1)... any opinion?

It's looking great :)

Having processing algs run in the background will really improve the user
experience IMO.

Having the possibility to use expressions in order to define parameters
dynamically is really awesome too! In your video demo you effectively
turned the fixed distance buffer algorithm into a variable distance buffer
(maybe a hint that we'll need only one of those from now on?) ;)

Keep up the good work!

Hi devs,

when spatial bookmark created along with coordinates it also store
CRS. But instead
of human-readable format (e.g. EPSG code) an internal SRS ID is used,
see [0]. Is
this intentionally? Should we store EPSG code instead?

That's the plan. Things won't scale well if we require separate
algorithms every time a parameter needs to be bound to a field or
expression (e.g. it's only a matter of time before someone needs a
"expression based buffer" alg), so the intention here is to allow
"data defined" parameters wherever it makes sense.

This has the potential to be very powerful. Imagine parameters within
models utilising expression variables, and some future "set variable"
processing algorithm....

Hi all,
an advanced install with Osgeo4w complains for a missing xerces-c 3.
Selecting it by hand solves the issue, so I suspect it is a missing
declared dependency.
All the best.

It's not intentional - it's just a result of using QSqlTableModel to
show the bookmarks which is displaying the internal values in that
column (the SRS ID). I looked into fixing this a while ago, but it's
not a straightforward change. I think a lot of refactoring needs to
occur with bookmarks, specifically moving the bookmarks database
handling to core and have only the model/view in app. I've seen a lot
of fragile plugin code floating around which directly reads the
bookmarks database because this functionality isn't directly available
in the API at the moment....

Sorry, I did not take note of it (AFAICT text cannot be selected from
the popup). It was something like Cannot install because
xcerces-c-3-something is missing.
Maybe someone can repeat the procedure and let us know?
All the best.

So it wasn't an error message on install and not at runtime complaining about a
missing DLL?

Or do you mean the page in the installer that tells you about the added
dependencies (dependencies, that are automatically added, although you didn't
select it)?   That would not have been an error message and you would have been
able to continue without going back to manually select it.

not, it appears during installation, after download.
it should be very easy to replicate on a clean install.

I can confirm here. I have a clean copy of windows and I have downloaded
the osgeo network installation.

During the installation I get this error:

crssync.exe - Errore di sistema

Impossibile avviare il programma perché xerces-c_3_1.dll non è presente
nel computer.


next window says:

qgis-common.bat exit code 1073741515


same error of above when trying to run QGIS

Cheers

I'm not against this, but IMHO such work should go for 3.0, as it requires
many changes in OTB provider. Pushing this changes in 2.18 is dangerous
(we already have broken SAGA support because of too fast switch to
SAGA 2.3.1) and may break OTB support in LTR version.

I think OTB team should take ownership on OTB provider plugin (it is hosted
in the Victor's repository now) and start impelement new functionality. For
QGIS 2.18 better to leave OTB support as is, or maybe backport some
fixes and description files to have OTB 5.4. and 5.6.

I agree 100% on what Alex said.

Rashad, instead of adding your user, can I completely move the
ownership to you or to another account that is managed by the OTB
team?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Slow QGIS performance with Oracle datasets
Message-ID: <6B3A58C6B8E2634EB9570259D88780A6BC7D0044@S000014.PROD.SITAD.DK>

Hi,



Using QGIS we find that retrieving, rendering and querying/filtering (spatial vector)data from our Oracle databases takes a lot longer than using PostGIS databases.

Our DBAs have investigated the matter and finds the performance to be 10-50 times slower in some cases.

Using for example Geomedia as GIS application does not show the same issues, and so the Oracle database is most likely not the bottleneck (we have also tested performance directly on the Oracle database, and both Oracle and PostGIS servers are on the same network, with Oracle on faster hardware).



We believe this could be down to the implementation of how QGIS handles Oracle connections.

If this is indeed the case, and an improvement is more of a feature request than an actual bug, we would be happy to discuss sponsoring the development in some way.



We are using Oracle 12C, PostGIS 2.3 on Postgresql 9.5/9.6 and QGIS 2.18.x



Any other input or questions on the matter are of course welcome :)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python expression function
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1705180804231.1150@bme-geod>

Dear Developers,

I found some strange behaviour of Python expression functions if variable 
length parameter list is given (e.g args=-1).
If there is a NULL value among the parameters the function is not called.
See the discussion on
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/240470/qgis-expression-function/240480?noredirect=1#comment376061_240480

If it a feature or a bug?

Regards,
Zoltan

Message-ID: <e19dcb25-9a47-c376-650e-be600974e103@duif.net>

Hi,

hitting https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16528
and fixing: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4586

with a very clean config, I see that the settings are rather messy:

[Qgis] and [qgis] are/were used (in the PR I propose a further cleanup)


But in the settings I see now different parents for the same connection:

[qgis]
WCS\aa\authcfg=
WCS\aa\password=
WCS\aa\username=
connections-wcs\aa\referer=
connections-wcs\aa\url=http://foo.com/geoserver/wcs
connections-wcs\selected=aa

And I'm wondering if we not should try to cleanup that too:

All connections related to a connection in one group, and not scattered
over those two groups. I would be ok with the use of WCS/WMS/WFS/ESRI
Anybody else interested in this? :-)

Grepping for [Qgis] I also found old plugin repo's in the installer_data.py:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py#L112

most of them are not even working anymore....

Clean?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

Cleaning is always very welcome!

I think that to bring some more order to the root level settings, we should
eventually make more use of the optional section argument:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsSettings.html#aba2f174ee000905cac8aff26665ed7c7

This is not implemented for groups though, but if you feel it could be
helpful I can add it.

Cheers.

Hi,

I had chatted on this with Juergen two weeks ago but would like to recall
that it still looks like the issue tracker doesn't send notification when
issue reports are modified.
The only notification I got in those weeks is someone's report I closed but
none of my own reports that got changed (commented, closed) was sent to me.
This could be problematic when a feedback is expected or the report was
wrongly closed.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi H,

there is an option to let Redmine know for what events you want to be
notified in

https://issues.qgis.org/my/account

did that maybe change during move to new server? There are different
options there.

Maybe change it and back to be sure you do not have a null or default
value in there?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Alessandro,

I do not understand: "This is not implemented for groups though..."
Isn't a section the same concept as a group?
Where is this 'section' element to be used?
Or is the idea to use it in a (free chosen) group?

I already have > 40 groups/sections(?) (as counted in the 'Advanced
Settings Editor').
I do not think it is possible to bring that back to the 8 you propose,
do you?

Looking into the 'Advanced Settings Editor' I also have double values in
the following 'groups'?
PythonPlugins
and
pythonplugins
but this could be due to recent changes. Ik will remove my config

Regards,

Richard

Yeah getting there, just doing clean up etc. Busy at work at the moment but
hopefully this weekend.

We also need something to deal with these key changes to help people
migrate from 2 to 3. We need a transform settings function.

Hi Richard,

I didn't know about that page. Notification was set on "all events from all
projects" (translated) but note that this wasn't my previous option (I did
receive only issues I created or wanted to follow, not all changes).
While writing this message I receive a notification so things are fixed
now, for me. Thanks.

BUT given that I didn't change this setting myself, it would be weird if I
were the only one concerned by this issue, wouldn't it.

I mean that the optional section argument is not available for beginGroup
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsSettings.html#ae0ffd9ce99f3fa8a712befb9be99412b

I don't know, maybe you can move some of them under one of the available
sections. The idea of the sections is to reduce (to 8, but can be expanded
if needed) the root level elements, of course you are not forced to do that
but I think that grouping GUI settings under the "gui" section, application
settings under the "app" section, plugins settings under "plugins" etc.
etc. is the first step towards a more logical tree classification.

This is bad design: see rule n. 1 in

Message-ID: <CABPxTToCLDpRBNJQGhbh1=7+odyzNsvP54O0Bh_KZ7caHhihuQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recently completed the conversion of Lat Lon Tools to work with QGIS 3.
It is in the plugin repo.

I noticed that my dockable dialog boxes seem to have no margin around them
in comparison to QGIS 2. Was this intended? Do I need a margin or leave it
as is?

Thanks,

On this note - I've recently discovered the need for some type of
reusable layer selection widget which allows choice of existing
layers/loading new layers from the file system/loading new layers from
available db/online connections. This would be extremely valuable for
processing too!

So I'm really glad to hear that you'll be pushing ahead with this work
- thanks Boundless!

There's been no intentional changes here. It's likely one of the
slight styling differences resulting from Qt4->Qt5 transition.

Side note: If you're porting to QGIS 3 API, make sure you use
QgsDockWidget in place of QDockWidget to ensure consistent behavior
with the inbuilt docks.

I suspect there's no reason apart from that no-one has had the need
until now and accordingly no-one has coded this feature.

A PR would be very welcome! (after the upcoming outputs->c++ work lands)

This is quite encouraging to read. I'd love to see stronger links
between our projects. I suspect there's a lot we can share - even if
it's just sharing all the custom widgets both projects have had to
develop/refine!

On this note, we spoke at the Australian hackfest about how we can
make QGIS play nicer with other projects. We've got the issue right
now that QgsApplication is a QApplication, so it's currently
impossible to import the qgis libraries into another Qt project
without creating this forced Q(gs)Application.

This should change - so we came up with the idea of splitting up the
current QgsApplication class, into:

- QgsCore. A singleton (yep!) containing all the various other "single
instance members" which are currently attached to QgsApplication. E.g.
task manager, provider registries, etc. This approach was recently
taken with the construction of a QgsGui singleton containing global
GUI members.
- Move all the various path handling code out to their own class.
- Create a QApplication in main, instead of creating a QgsApplication.
Standalone scripts would need to do the same - construct their own
Q(Core/Gui)Application, just like standalone PyQt scripts require.
- Kill the need to manually call initQgis, by handling this
automatically when the qgis python libraries are imported.

Benefits would be:
- much easier use of qgis python libraries in standalone scripts
(especially with Nathan's great work in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/df679a2). On Windows this would
then be as simple as: setup python path correctly - import qgis.core -
done.
- QGIS libraries can be used safely with any other Qt based code which
handles its own Q(Core/Gui)Application creation.

Of course... this was just planning ahead... I don't think anyone's
actively working on this yet ;)

In fact, I took a look at the Python code and found that it would be
probably possible to implement following the code for the number type, in a
few places in the processing code. I think the models provider may not need
changes.

Since I am not very proficient in c++, it will probably more efficient for
me to stick to somewhat awkward workarounds. But I will take a look.

(I would like to use Travis as much as possible. Is it possible to avoid
building locally altogether ?)

Hi,

just a quick update on this topic: we've started yesterday the work on this
task, here is the plan:
- morph the various providers *selectWidget( QWidget *parent,
Qt::WindowFlags fl ) to return a widget and not a dialog (as per original
specs)
- create a generic dialog wrapper to maintain the existing dialogs
available from the main menu (and as keyboard shortcuts)
- create the unified layer dialog (dockable!)
- insert the widgets into a stacked widget in the unified dialog
- preliminary tests
- final polishing (styles, docking behavior, usability enhancements)
- tests

I'll try to make a prototype PR as soon as I have at least one provider
available so that everybody can track the progresses.

Suggestions welcome!

A very early preliminary test: http://www.itopen.it/bulk/unibutton.png

Both of these codepaths use QgsVectorLayerExporter, which batches
calls to QgsVectorDataProvider::addFeatures in groups of 200 features.
So there's definitely the potential for a good speed bump here by
moving to the COPY command.

> Did I miss something? Is there someone working in that area?

I don't think so. The tricky bit would be handling the "RETURNING"
part of the INSERT command, which is used to update the add features
with their new feature IDs/primary keys. I'm not sure that's possible
using a COPY command.

Yep, and thanks Alessandro for the screenie. Makes me want more!

@Nyall in Essen the talk was to start with what Alessandro wrote in his
email, so 1 dialog 'merging' all buttons/widgets/dialogs into one, reuse
as much as possible. So it was possible to get it into 3.0

Off course people (.../me) started brainstorming about features which
w/could be added too :-)

Your idea adds (I think) to the idea to make some kind of
'datamanagement-console' in near future, where you can create/copy
data(!), move data around (browser part) or delete it.
Your note fits in this isn't it?

Regards,

Richard

Unfortunately there's not much information to work with here.

Can you share what you actually compared?

Hi Lene,

we will ship with QGIS only few providers. Additional providers, like OTB,
R, LiDAR, etc
will be available through plugin repository. Right now Processing is under
huge refactoring
(kudos to Nyall for his fantastic work!), so there is no much sense in
releasing plugins.
When API will be stabilised, we will publish other providers in the plugin
repo.

Hello,

I would like, if I have time, to add the GUI for the classes I recently 
added (Circle, ellipse, regular polygon). Where do you think the buttons 
must go?

- DigitizeToolBar
- AdvancedDigitizeToolBar
- A new toolbar (which name?)

Do you also have any recommendations or advice regarding this addition?

Thanking you in advance.

That may be the problem. I used a QDockWidget. I will switch it out for the

Hi List,

/me wondering if geocoder-providers should/could be used in processing.

Currently I cannot find an example, but it was earlier proposed by
someone in my geocoder QEP, see [0]

I'm hoping that QGIS could maybe come up with a reusable gui for using
such processing geocoder  providers....

Any idea's of what kind of api/input/output to use for that?

Regards,

Richard

I suspect there's no reason apart from that no-one has had the need
until now and accordingly no-one has coded this feature.

A PR would be very welcome! (after the upcoming outputs->c++ work lands)


In fact, I took a look at the Python code and found that it would be
probably possible to implement following the code for the number type, in a
few places in the processing code. I think the models provider may not need
changes.

Since I am not very proficient in c++, it will probably more efficient for
me to stick to somewhat awkward workarounds. But I will take a look.

(I would like to use Travis as much as possible. Is it possible to avoid
building locally altogether ?)

Hi Richard,

I think this is possible. Processing already supports string and coordinates
as parameters, so it should be relatively easy to pass address represented
by string parameter and get a point vectro layer with location or pass
coordinates and return either string or vector layer with new column, containing
address.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [processing] launching separate process/thread
Message-ID: <CAKdk67vvDy-NmGuGxXRQZFS3z6bmhs9oi9uRciVLwmdP8u+iAg@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to launch a minimal web server from a processing script to
serve html properly (rather than using the file protocol).

Since the web server needs to run and keep running separately from qgis or
the qgis python interpreter, I investigated various ways to accomplish this
using SimpleHTTPServer. On windows 2.18.7 as linux should be more robust.

- threading.Threat : start() works until the server actually serves a file.
Then qgis crashes with a minidump . For some reason, the crashing happens
not always but more often than not.
- multiprocessing : seems to be the recommended solution but I do not seem
to have it with Qgis python (?)
- QProcess.start() : works from the python terminal, seems robust but does
not seem to work from a processing script (?). Would be the preferred
solution.
- QProcess.startDetached('python',(args),dir) : works reliably but requires
killing and restarting the process to change the root directory served

This may all change with Qgis 3 but I suspect 2.18 will be around for a
while, too.

Any recommendations or ideas would be welcome.

I will look into qgis2web to see what it does.

I'm afraid qgis2web just uses file://. I'd therefore be interested if you get
this to work, as file:// does limit what can be done. Does d3 Map Renderer
spawn a web server?

As a followup, here is the simple processing script which is my attempt at
launching a separate task:

https://github.com/andreasplesch/QGIS-X3D-Processing/blob/master/scripts/launch_webserver.py

qgis2web does not seem to need a real http server for the preview as
openlayers apparently can use the file protocol.

Hi Giovanni,

thanks for the pointer. When I use multiprocessing.Process instead of
threading.Thread I get:

PicklingError: Can't pickle <function webserver at 0x1622F330>: it's not
found as __main__.webserver

This is probably related to:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#windows

So I am not sure how one would use multiprocessing from a processing script
rather than from the __main__ python program.

Looking around some more, there is also os.spawn and its recommended update
subprocess.Popen.

So

os.chdir(root_folder)
pid = subprocess.Popen(['python', '-m', 'SimpleHTTPServer', str(port)]).pid

and later
os.kill(pid, 7)

works robustly in my tests. This seems similar to QProcess.startDetached
which may provide better platform coverage (?).

Great news - I've long wanted a simple way to draw circles (and if I
can add a feature request - rectangles too!). Thanks for all your
recent work implementing the base components of this in the c++
classes.

+1 ... but no good ideas for names, sorry. "Feature construction toolbar"?


> Do you also have any recommendations or advice regarding this addition?

Yep. I looked into adding an inbuilt "draw rectangle" tool a few
months ago, but never got the chance to actually do the work. Here's
my 2c:

Here's what I'd suggest:

1. QgsMapToolCapture needs refactoring. It's become quite messy and
the interface is tied too heavily to the existing subclasses, making
it difficult to add new capture tools. I think this should be
refactored so that subclasses implement two virtual methods - one for
returning the geometry for the temporary rubber band which is shown
while moving the mouse during digitizing, and one for returning the
actual created QgsGeometry corresponding to the current clicked
points.

2. Create QgsMapToolAddFeature subclasses for each of the new "add
shape" actions. Assuming that the QgsMapToolCapture API is cleaned,
this should be quite simple to do for each shape type. I'd actually go
crazy here - and add multiple tools for each shape type, so you could
have tools for "add ellipse by center and radius", "add ellipse by
bounding box", etc. Same for rectangles - we could have a "add
rectangle by clicking two opposite corners tools", and an ArcGIS style
"add rectangle by clicking one corner, clicking the other end of this
side, and then clicking the opposite side tool" (see
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdeRhpDmf2s). This approach would
automatically play very nicely with the existing advanced digitizing
dock constraints + inbuilt snapping tools.

3. Expose these construction tools via a new toolbar. Group the
similar tools together with the little down arrows to select between
them + remember which was the last tool used and show that one by
default (just like how the select tools are grouped and operate). So
there'd be a group for rectangle construction, ellipse construction,
regular polygon construction.

I'm interested to here Denis' thoughts given that he's the maintainer
of this area of code and whether this approach would fit his vision.

(Incidentally - I really want to see this happen, and I'm happy to
provide mentorship for these changes if you require.)

Hi Andreas,

I recently had troubles with getting stdout / stderr from
subprocess.Popen on some Windows systems. Not sure about the reasons but
switching over to QProcess solved it.

Hi all,

If you’ve been following North Road's blog posts, you’ll be aware that
we are currently running a crowd funding campaign to extend the
capabilities of QGIS’ print composer. You can read full details about
this over at the campaign page
(https://north-road.com/2017/04/26/qgis-composer-rewrite-and-layout-engine-crowdfund-launched/)

The good news is that we’ve just hit the mid way point of the funds!
Many generous backers have stepped up with contributions and we’re
well on the way to reaching the funding goal. However, we still need
your help make this work a reality.

Right now, what we need most is interested users and community members
who will reach out to their local QGIS users and seek more backing for
the campaign. We need to publicise the campaign beyond the regular
online QGIS community, to the thousands of enterprises and
organisations which rely on QGIS for their daily mapping operations.
We need community members who can get in contact with these
organisations and help convince them that investing back into the open
source software they utilise is beneficial (and often will even SAVE
them money in the long run, due to the increased productivity that
changes like our composer improvements will bring!).

So, while social media reshares have been vital to reaching the
current stage, we now need more “hands on” helpers who will take this
on. If you know of any organisations which depend on QGIS for their
mapping outputs, now’s the time to get in contact with them directly
and advise them of this campaign!

Thanks in advance,
Nyall

As a side note: we have already 2 editbars (advanced+default), we could
'just add' these to current default one. And not adding a full toolbar,
but one of those little dropdown buttons? As I do not think you will
switch between types a lot during a digitizing session? (plz correct me
if I'm wrong).

GUI-wise: we collect a lot of edit tools already. Somebody has an idea
to keep this all tidy and clear?

I was thinking if all the edit tools maybe should become a 'panel'
instead of a toolbar? On which you have some presets/checkboxes to have
either 'simple' edits, 'advanced', 'cad', 'shapes'.
Maybe the labeling buttons could be added to that panel too?

Regards,

Richard

Hi John,

Thanks for that valuable contribution. It's a very interesting way to
reflect the values of the University of California on a public forum.
With insights like this it's easy to see how you were selected for the
position of Laboratory Director at the UCSD Supercomputer Center...

I suppose it prepares a web page loaded in webview with some python
bridges to communicate with the JS inside the webview... no need of a
webserver to run d3

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8GazEwWF4JogGpuzOD8dW_yWXHZ5FgNNyj8gGahtnjKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm starting to wonder if we need to split up the code base into different
repos for the different sub projects?

At the moment I think it would be best for QGIS Server to live in it's own
repo mainly because it means the development process and cycle can be
different to desktop if that is needed.

It's not a huge deal but thought I would throw out the idea anyway.

That's exactly what I would *not* like to see.

I think that the server developers (I'm not talking about myself: I did
nothing but reviewing and a few minor API refactorings) has been very
(re)active lately.

What is exactly the problem that you are trying to solve with this proposal?

Are you proposing to also split desktop app from core and make three repos ?

I agree with most other responses. I would like to see QGIS server
remain in the main repo. One of the reasons of the 3Liz refactoring is
to remove redundant code from Server and rely more on the core parts of
the QGIS API, to be better compatible.

Ok that's all fine. Was just tabling the idea. Doesn't really affect me was
just an idea mainly.

I looked it up, and it lists a webserver as a prerequisite, so it doesn't
help us.

Hi Matthias,

thanks for the heads up on subprocess.Popen.

While for spawning a simple webserver, no communication is needed at this
point, QProcess may then also work better if I can find out how to change
the root folder of a running instance of SimpleHTTPServer.

Could you use QProcess.start() rather than QProcess.startDetached() from a
plugin or processing script ? I am looking for a way to avoid having the
console window open up.

Best,
-Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems building 2.18 on Windows 7 with MS Visual
	C++ 2010 Express
Message-ID: <fd1fce71-183b-1d02-609c-ff8c5dc511c0@adtechgeospatial.com>

I haven't tried building QGIS for over a year and the build process is 
now failing.

1. Forked and cloned a clean copy of release-2_18

2. Ran cmake-gui which had the following warning messages but the 
Configure and Generate seemed successful
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:320 (FIND_PACKAGE):
By not providing "FindQJSON.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "QJSON", but
CMake did not find one.

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "QJSON" with any of
the following names:

QJSONConfig.cmake
qjson-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "QJSON" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"QJSON_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files. If "QJSON"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.

3. Opened the VS project file in qgisbuild and ran BUILD_ALL which had 7 
failures like the following:
98>  Building Custom Rule 
J:/QGISDB2-218/python/pyplugin_installer/CMakeLists.txt
98>  CMake does not need to re-run because

98>C:\Program Files

error MSB6006: "cmd.exe" exited with code 1.

Is there something obvious missing or wrong version of some build software?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Release 2.18.8 on Ubuntu 16.04 dies loading
	delimited text file
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E1653E74566@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

Last night I installed version 2.18.8 onto ubuntu 16.04 (via automatic upgrade).  This seems to have killed the delimited text provider.

Symptoms are:
    Open delimited text dialog
    Select simple .csv file with lat and lon fields
    Click OK
     ... QGIS dies immediately

Normal behaviour would be to open CRS selection dialog and then display the layer.

Note that existing projects with delimited text layers load properly and display the layer, so this is an issue with creating the layer, not displaying it.

I have tried removing and reinstalling QGIS and all its dependencies and the issue is persisting.

I'm installing from the http://qgis.org/debian repository

This was working without issue on 2.18.7.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding raster layer from memory in plugin
Message-ID: <b192a5eb9c10461fa60367518e54ed3e@VITOMAIL5.vito.local>

Hi,

I'm developing a plugin that generates a new raster based on already loaded rasters.

What is the recommended way to get this raster loaded into QGis? I have the raster data in a QqsRasterBlock but it is not clear how I can get this data in a QgsRasterLayer.

I did not create a processing plugin as I want my plugin to be docked, is a processing plugin the only way to achieve this?

Kind regards,
Dirk

While chasing a regression issue [1] I'm finding the
"Affected Version" field not useful in finding what's the
version which introduced a regression.

When the bug was originally filed (7 months ago) the "Affected Version"
field was set to "2.16.1", which I guess was the version tested by the
reporter, who reported this was a regression in "2.16" (2.14 working
fine), and the "Target Version" was set to "2.16".

4 months later the "Target Version" field value was removed
by Jean-Gabriel JGH. Shortly after Giovanni set "Target Version"
to "2.18" and changed "Affected Version" from "2.16.1" to "2.18.4",
effectively loosing the information about the oldest known
affected version.

[1] https://issues.qgis.org/issues/15463

May I suggest we use "Affected Version" field to list the
"oldest known affected version" ? The fact that 2.16 is not
maintained anymore could still be encoded in the "Target Version"
(ie: milestone).

What do you think about that approach ? Or do you have better
suggestions ?

The field now has a description (tooltip) to that extent.

We really needed to simplify the form for fling the issue reports, so
basically in Essen at the last dev meeting
we also had to compromise. Is perfect? no,but as is now is much more
better than before.

the idea behind that type of changes is to make clear what is the
latest version affected by the bug.
If the bug effectively started affecting a previous this is usually
stated in the description or in a comment.

Target version is now gone, so don't even speak about it now, not many
were considering that at all.

To transfer the repo i need permission to create new repos under that
org. If you can give me rights to do it, I will do the transfer and
then you can revoke them

I don't get the tooltip, don't know if due to http caches.
How about changing the label, is that a possibility ?

I'm not sure how useful "latest version affected" is, but if you think
it is important, maybe there should be two fields: "Oldest affected"
and "Newest affected". Or a list of affected versions (is that
possible?) so to be able to compute it...

I have a question on the 3D that was proposed in the grant for the use 
with QT 3D. Am i wrong to think this is really oriented towards what 
some people call 2.5D (terrain model as shown in the proposal example) 
or will there be support for 3D that will be able to display 3D meshes 
or volumes like those available in Grass and display in programs such as 
NVIZ and Paraview or more advanced commercial software. As geophysicists 
we are always trying to look at things under the ground not on top.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTrz1GYoc9p_kHSWWw+K8oJzm_wfMKWS7ytZ2V2OAxyXNQ@mail.gmail.com>

If I start with a QgsDockWidget in Qt Designer rather than a QDockWidget, I
cannot add another widget to it. With QDockWidget I have a QWidget inside
and then all of the other components. I simply cannot add anything to
QgsDockWidget. Is anyone else having the same problem?

I am using the latest version (2.18.8) shipped with the OSGeo4W installer
on Windows 7.

Thanks,

Calvin

Message-ID: <b6f4c542594b46aebbaf7078c5da5117@EXCHMBX-21.cg67.fr>

Hi folks,

No matter qgis version (2.14, 2.18) , loading  oracle spatial table with 20000 rows take few seconds while loading a view  (based on same table) with 900 rows take  more than one minute.
Is there some way to tune oracle view to take more reasonable loading time?

I know that materialized view is a solution, but with frequently dataset update this is not the solution here…

Thanks
Thanks

do you have the hierarchy of the compound widget (usually on the upper
left) ? it should contain a layout => select and break it... this is
theoretically. I'll check how is composed a QgsDockWidget.

Hi Syd

The idea is to have support for proper 3D meshes/volumes, not just
2.5D geometries. The initial work should introduce interface for 3D
renderers (somehow similar to 2D renderers we have now) allowing
generation of arbitrary meshes and associated materials from input
data (which could be 2D geometries, 2.5D geometries or 3D geometries)
- to create e.g. buildings extruded from their footprint, tree objects
from points or underground pipes from linestring geometries. In the
initial work we may not have support for reading true 3D geometries
from data sources like PostGIS, but that should not be a problem to
add at some point later when the 3D rendering framework is in place.

Regards
Martin

Hi Calvin,

I can reproduce.
This is very strange as the custom widget is indeed defined as a container,
so it should be able to receive widgets.
I tried on fedora + master, you tried on windows + 2.18, so it doesn't seem
to be OS or Qt version dependant.

Anyone else can confirm?

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,

a quick update:

I've prepared a PR with a working prototype in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4629, I need some feed-back and some
help, expecially UX/UI about if we want it as a dockable dialog too (and
how to make it user-configurable).

Feed-back welcome (but please keep it limited in scope to phase 1).

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python 3 compatibility
Message-ID: <CAKdk67v8Dy1FkTRzS8ssc7s8k0NH98qLXKYwbm=qB6FVgimMoA@mail.gmail.com>

On my linux system (gentoo) QGis 2.18 is using the system python which is
set to Python 3 whereas on my windows system QGis 2.18 is using the bundled
Python 2.

This lead to me to start to look for which Python is used in processing
scripts leading to lines such as:

http_server = ('SimpleHTTPServer', 'http.server')[sys.version_info.major ==
2]

With QGis 3 using Python 3 (I believe), there be will be a desire to write
scripts and plugins which are compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

Is there a recommendation of how to accomplish this compatibility ?

Or is the general recommendation to have and maintain separate programs for
each version ? I suspect the answer is yes here but perhaps there are other
approaches.

Any insight or comment much appreciated,

-Andreas

Thanks for the clarification. We look forward to seeing better 3D 
support more integrated into Qgis. Without good 3D support people here 
keep moving back to commercial software.

Unfortunately as far as i can see PostGIS supports 3D vector and 3D 
point clouds 2D raster but not 3D raster. The only opensource database 
program that I know of that supports 3D raster is Grass which we use for 
that purpose. But we usually do our viewing in Paraview or Mayavi 
therefore to be able to view in QGIS would be a read advantage.

Keep up the good work on QGIS it is really getting very good.


thanks

Syd

Not a guide, but a script you can use:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/scripts/2to3

it uses all stuff from

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/scripts/qgis_fixes

You could run the script and see what is changed?

That's what I'd strongly suggest. Otherwise you'll end up with a ton
of branching code trying to maintain compatibility with the older
libraries.

You could put the existing plugin version into some type of
"maintenance" only mode for 2.x and move all feature development into
a new, clean 3.0 branch.

Thank you!
You can already do this via my plugin CADDigitize (rectangle too) or QAD 
(expect rectangle). Obviously, I can also add the rectangles. It will 
certainly be necessary to create a new class or modify QgsRectangle 
which today has no possibility of rotation (azimuth, inclination).

OK. I think it sounds like what I did with CADDigitize (for GUI part).
I think that it will also be necessary to modify classes for the snap if 
later we wish to realize ("CAD") modifications of entities (trim, 
extend, chamfer, bevel ...)

I can just confirm again that Qt 5.3 is not enough, for example (but
there will be more):
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/7eb63d99dceddbe7ea10a51149800d0e0326c19a#commitcomment-22228267

What min version of Qt are you able to compile with? We should update INSTALL.

In INSTALL requirements it is also written: Qwt >= 5.0 & (< 6.1 with
internal QwtPolar)
but Qwt 6.0 does not compile with Qt >= 5.4:
http://www.qtcentre.org/archive/index.php/t-63275.html
Is it still true that Qwt must be < 6.1? I have compiled with 6.1.3
(but not tested related functionality).

I can't help with minimum Qt version (it's either 5.4 or 5.5, but I
don't believe a firm decision has been made), but the minimum Qwt is
6.1. In this case the INSTALL is incorrect and needs to be updated.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] hasCrsTransformEnabled removed?
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqmcUirBU56znLZpfsyQj+19ajNRpQhykgRNxaPtssR+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I found in http://qgis.org/api/api_break.html:
setCrsTransformEnabled(), hasCrsTransformEnabled(),
hasCrsTransformEnabledChanged() were removed. CRS transformation is
now always enabled.

But in Project Properties CRS there is now "No projection" checkbox
instead of "Enable on the fly reprojection" in QGIS2, so basically the
same, inverted. Which method to use to get 'No projection' state and
which signal is emitted when it is changed?

QgsProject().instance().crs().isValid() or
QgsProject().instance().crs() == NULL?
QgsProject().instance().crsChanged()?

Thanks

"No projection" is subtly different to OTF off. No projection is
basically a "non earth" mode, where coordinates are treated exactly as
they are and all measurements become unitless.

QgsProject().instance().crs().isValid() will return false if this mode
is turned on. QgsProject().instance().crsChanged() will be emitted
when it's switched on or off.

Message-ID: <CABPxTTrvws5GyRa87JYfL=V+HAXDSddaMM0r_OeGU1UejQ2ZfA@mail.gmail.com>

I have been toying with writing a couple of QGIS plugins and wanted to
check to see if anyone else is doing something similar and to see if there
is interest.

1. Geospatial Animator
What I am thinking of is a plugin where you can define a series key
locations keeping track of the (X,Y) coordinate and zoom level.
Additionally there would be a step size and it would output either rendered
frames or a video.

2. Another Measure Tool
As a preface I was looking at some old archaeological records and it was
giving site locations based off of the previous location with a distance
and bearing. As far as I can tell there is no tools that interactively
gives both of these values.

I would like a measure tool that provides the distance between points A &
B, the bearing from point A to B, and the bearing from point B to A.

I would appreciate any thoughts you have or whether someone is already
working on this.

Thanks,

Calvin

This certainly sounds useful!

I'm wondering - instead of adding this as a plugin, how about adding
it into the default QGIS measure tool instead? I'm happy to help out
with mentoring c++ changes if you need it.

Message-ID: <CAC8_qeZ+dAe00X4Bkw5XMjZKvK14eAXypzKvAU613R+qGP7cWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm facing a HIGHLY DEGRADED performance with attribute table opening with
version 2.18.x (2.18.8 and 2.18.7) when we have more than 100K rows. (in
this case 161K)

I'm looking at an OLD application done 5 years back with a custom QGIS 1.7,
PostgreSQL 9.0 and PostGIS.

The performance at that time was high commendable and it worked very well.
See the video here;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rjeqgFK5GA
(this video was taken on a Virtual Machine)

Recently we stepped into upgrade the technology stack and to my surprise,
the current version of QGIS 2.18.8 is way TOO slow and this goes all
against the QGIS in the Government environment.

While keeping the DB on the VM environment, we tested it on different
platform and version;

QGIS 2.18.8 (latest) ruining on Windows 10 environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k19tEqSK-1Y&t=64s
Took nearly 2 minutes to open !!!

QGIS 2.18.7 ruining on MacOS environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1eg2K17Z1E&t=15s
Again took more than 2 minutes to open !!!

QGIS 2.14.14 (LTR) ruining on MacOS environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-qklLFCHA
Took only 5 seconds to open :)


So, it appears that something has gone SERIOUSLY WRONG between the version
2.14.x and 2.18.x

Since 2.18.x is marked as LTR version, I really hope this issue is fixed
since most of the government environments adopt only the LTR version and
with such performance it goes against QGIS.

The next LTR is 3.2 which is more than a year later. Can you please look
into this issue?

Thanks and Cheers !

Hi,
I found a possible bug. I'm using 2.18.8.

I can't see the fields in "Select by Expression"
Field and values " is empty for all layers (I tested shapefiles, gml and
geojson).

I tested in Linux Mint 17 and Windows 7 and 10

Is this a known bug?

Yes I use Anita's TimeManager. What the time manager does is to visualize
across time. What I am proposing is to be able to define a path on the map
and to animate traveling across it. It will be even cooler once we get 3D.
This can be used to create an animation that can include zooming in and out
of an area and to travel along a predefined path.

I would prefer that. I am not sure how to proceed and for the next two
weeks I will be working with QGIS, but after that I would like to discuss
this further. In the past I have used C/C++ quite extensively, but have not
for the past 5 years. I think I can pick it back up fairly easily. The
biggest hurdle for me is to know how to get a QGIS environment set up and
to make changes to the core QGIS. Mostly this is because I just have not
had the time to investigate what needs to be done. I would like working
with someone who already knows how to do this.

Thanks!!!

I'd really like to publicly extend my thanks to Jürgen for this prompt
release of 2.18.9, and for the work he's put in to quickly backport
fixes and squash critical bugs leading up to this.

This makes the second point release in a row where Jürgen has been
required to push out rapid follow up releases, through no fault of his
own!

Jürgen -- without your hard work as release manager and all the hours
you put in to packaging QGIS releases there's no way we'd have
achieved the success we enjoy today. Many many thanks for all the work
you've put in over the years in this thankless task!

Hi devs,
I noticed that saving a raster (10x10m, EPSG:32632) to another CRS (3003) creates a gridded artifact with a “cell size” of 100x100m. Doing the same operation using Warp command from the Processing toolbox, everything works fine. Any idea? I’m working with 2.18.7 .
I found only Bug Report #15542 but not similar issues on this procedure.

All the best,

Niccolò

yes it s pretty amazing how fast a new release can come out and we 
really appreciate this.

but it does bring up one issue.

once you hit the update button in Ubuntu update and downloaded and 
installed a new version of  QGIS  and then realized QGIS no longer 
really worked no one in our office could figure out how to go back one 
release so we could continue working.

could someone let us know how to easily do this in the future.

thanks

Syd

Hi,
after the update of QGis Nightly through osgeo4w setup, I cannot run QGis
due to this error:

There is something I can do to fix this problem?

I'm on Windows 10, Osgeo4W 32 bit.

I'd really like to publicly extend my thanks to Jürgen for this prompt
release of 2.18.9, and for the work he's put in to quickly backport
fixes and squash critical bugs leading up to this.

This makes the second point release in a row where Jürgen has been
required to push out rapid follow up releases, through no fault of his
own!

Jürgen -- without your hard work as release manager and all the hours
you put in to packaging QGIS releases there's no way we'd have
achieved the success we enjoy today. Many many thanks for all the work
you've put in over the years in this thankless task!

What's a good way to convert 25 meters (for example) to layer

and handle the case when they layer is in wgs84.

Hey Andreas,
On the digitizing toolbar, try "Split Parts" instead of "Split Features" on multipart polygons.

Hi Magnus,

As I understand you are writing a script that should perform a 25m 
buffer on any user layer?

I think you should never buffer unprojected layers. So blocking the 
process and telling the user to transform the data to an appropriate 
projection would be best in my opinion.

If you really want your script to be user friendly, you could find the 
most suitable utm zone for the dataset, project, buffer and reproject.

Good luck,
Raymond

BTW, at the equator 25m is about 0.000225 degrees, because 360 degrees / 
40.000.000 meters * 25.
But I did not tell you this. ;)

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FgJZ-DiavP2AuBD9OQ0TU2DLbG_uLZOVU21JU-H2ufG6A@mail.gmail.com>

​Hi,

There is a long-standing but elusive crash issue
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14752

I've now narrowed it down to enabling ​"Discourage labels from covering
features" for a particular point layer in the provided test project. I've
also attached a recent crash dump from 2.14.15 to the ticket.

It would be great if a developer could look into this.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

For QGIS3, adding support for other basic Field-Types in class
QgsField, such as DATE / DATETIME and BLOBs should be taken into
consideration.

Also adding a field (SQLITE stored as 'cid') which would represent the
Field number inside the TABLE could simplify the use inside a Provider.

At the moment only String / Int / Double are supported.

What makes you think that?

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresprovider.cpp#L202
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L464
...

QGIS has quite rich field type support. Is there something in
particular which you've found is missing?

I would say it's a case of bad docs as it's just a QVariant::Type and other
providers use it already.

OK - that needs fixing. Can you send a PR?

> and the usage of type in displayString and convertCompatible.

That's fine - displayString falls back to Qt's QVariant::toString(),
so it handles other data types. convertCompatible uses
QVariant::convert in the same way.

Good, then I will work those samples into QgsSpatiaLiteProvider.
For Spatialite 4.5.0 QgsSpatiaLiteProvider needs to be worked on, which I

Hi,

As I asked previously on twitter, added new feature to PostGIS 
versioning, that writes down postgresql user role, that was used for 
insert or update of row.

But my github knowledge is not so good, for doing pull request, as my 
commits are in two branches.

https://github.com/merkato/QGIS/commit/272be6adb4784cb55c6b99409bd974b19064796a

https://github.com/merkato/QGIS/commit/f6244791334060b5a4b1993c9dcc06a6b4603f90

And here on twitter is screenshot of UI changes. 
https://twitter.com/TomaszNycz/status/868873091329478656

If someone could help me doing step-by-step with issue and pull request, 
it will be appreciated.

BIG thanks for everyone behind the scene. I believe the fix is done by

read over and understand that this issue was in discussion for quite some

Thanks for the confirmation. Just to clarify, this fix was part of the
sponsored bug fixing effort which is funded by the project from
donated funds. So the real thanks here belong to everyone who has
donated to QGIS in the past and made this possible!

For gpkg: should remain solely with OGR.

For VectorLayers (SpatialTables and SpatialViews) is more problematic,
since OGR does not support writable SpatialViews, which I use heavily.

So that would be a -1 for me for removing QgsSpatiaLiteProvider.

With the upcoming Spatialite 4.5.0, with the new RasterLite2 and Topology
support, an adapted QgsSpatiaLiteProvider can provide more than the
present VectorLayers
support.

Since with RasterLite2 one Database will contain both Vector and Raster
Layers and new Dialog logic is needed when selecting Layers to load.
The intention is to create a Dialog that will be similar to that used in
spatialite_gui, where Vector and Raster Layers are separated.
Also the 'hiding' of the Administration tables (that also contain
geometries) is needed to avoid confusion.

Since RasterLite2 is not only designed to store and show Rasters, but also
to combine the Raster-Data with Vector-Data (with SLD/SE styles), an
adapted QgsSpatiaLiteProvider would be more able to utilized to full
functionality than (possibly) GDAL/OGR.

This assumes that the QgsSpatiaLiteProvider is properly maintained and that
changes be made with coordination and discussion with the spatialite
project (which in the past has not been done).

So for QGIS3, I would say, that an option should be built in so that the
User can chose whether the spatialite or Gdal/Ogr provider should be used
in Drag and Drop actions (or other types of file selections).
The present QgsSqliteHandle class can very swiftly determine if a selected
file is supported by the QgsSpatiaLiteProvider or not (and could be
dealt with in QgisApp::handleDropUriList).

sorry for asking again, is the loss of rendering speed performances
(or better, time to fully load large vector layers) we see now  in
master (at least with some datasets is quite noticeable, like 20/30%
slower) to be considered ok (you mentioned at some point more
stability) or to be considered an issue?

thanks!

Thank you for the hint, James. Somehow I always thought that this
function is only suitable for separating an existing part from a
feature (never used it though).
Yet, if you cut a polygon with the "Split Parts" tool, the output will
be an invalid geometry (I observed self-intersections). This as well
can not be the intended behavior. I could observe those errors in
simple scratch layers as well as in PostGIS layers.

Has anybody else experienced this behavior?

Hi,

I need to export a vector layer with measures (LineStringM) to
Shapefile and PostGIS in QGIS3, neither works.

Shapefile: there is only 'include z dimension' but no 'include m
dimension' and no PolylineM in SHPT options in save as dialog. The
layer is exported without M.

Postgis: the layer is exported (DB Manager) but without geometry.

This was reported to work:
https://github.com/blazek/lrs/issues/4#issuecomment-270894322

Am I missing something or it is not implemented?

Hi,

yes I see that. Possibly related to #15542 but not sure, so better
file a new ticket (with sample data and exact steps to replicate).

Hi Radim,
NextGIS added the z ability on dataset creation and export on behalf of
QWAT's project. I didn't focus on M values for specifications and testing
steps, so it's probably just not wired yet .

What GDAL version? You need GDAL >= 2.1 for M values in shapefiles to
work. I think if you've got a source layer with m values and save to
shp with GDAL 2.1 it should just work. That checkbox for "include z
dimension" will add z dimension to an existing 2d layer, but it
shouldn't be required if your layer already has a z dimension.

We probably should add a "include m values" option as well (if
supported gdal version is present) for consistency.

Hi Anita,
I made some test of my own.

2.14.15 crashes on project load, as well as 2.18.9.

2.18.9 nightly does not crash on project load.

BUT

I tried load the point layer in 2.18.9 nightly in a blank project,
enable labels without the "Discourage labels from covering features"
option and if you zoom in/out quickly with the mouse wheel is easy
enough to make it crashes too...

all from osgeo4w.

​Thank you for the confirmation Giovanni!

GDAL 2.1.3.

I have created a memory layer with type LineStringM, which has correct
wkbType, QgsWkbTypes.hasM(layer.wkbType()) is true. M is correct in
identify - derived attributes.

BTW: wkbType in layer properties would be useful.

Shapefile or PostGIS? Any chance to be implemented soon for PostGIS?

Yes, it is, but:

QgsVectorFileWriter::ogrTypeFromWkbType( QgsWkbTypes::Type type )
{
  type = QgsWkbTypes::dropM( type );
....

Hi,

I try to import matplotlib.pyplot from python shell in QGIS (2.18 or 2.99).
It imports OK if I run it from QGIS internal python shell but it fails if I
run it from python outside QGIS (running python via OSGeo4W.bat).

it might have something to do with Tkinter.

code examples:
1.
import matplotlib
dir(matplotlib)

-> yields a shorter list (laking pyplot among others) if run from outside
QGIS.

2.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

-> Success from QGIS, but gives the following error if run from outside.

Yes, layer of areas 1 to 100 hectares. But its kind of hard to set 25m to 0,00025 degrees,
especially far upp north in Europe. The scale is different for latitude/longitude.

Maybe I'll just abort if neither source or dest CRS are projected. Else I can use one of those.
Thanks for the input!

I suspect that's probably a remnant from GDAL < 2.1. I can't see any
reason to keep it for the newer gdal versions.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problem with "no Data value" with rasters when
 using the Layer Styling panel?
Message-ID: <CAK6pVBVcB0jEQN4rzMT8VUgWuAQA_DP4ZK1McCLanD_K8gz6Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am testing the layer styling panel (shortcut F7) with the latest Nightly
build on the Ubuntu repositories.

By default, the NoData value is -9999. If I add "10" as additional NoData
value, nothing happens.

If I do the same in the layer properties, then the expected behavior
happens: all pixels with value "10" are not rendered.

So it seems that the manually added NoData values in the Layer Styling
Panel are not considered.

Can someone else replicate this problem? Should I open a ticket?

Cheers
Stéphane

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Drag and drop to PostGIS crash
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYp4XO0fKs_52q0s+vyUbSEu2VzMJV3-RQYA3V7kPSBMGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

QGIS3 crashes when a vector is dragged and drop to PostGIS in browser
in qgspostgresconn.cpp on

    // sharing connection between threads is not safe
    // See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/13141
    Q_ASSERT( QApplication::instance()->thread() == QThread::currentThread() );

the issue mentioned above is about something different (loading items
in thread) and it is marked as resolved.

In DD it is probably caused by QgsTaskRunnableWrapper which runs the
import in a new thread?

Can others confirm? Is somebody working on it? Quite important feature IMO.

Works OK here if I remove that assert... can you test and confirm that
it's safe to remove? I don't know the history here...

IIRC that comment was mine, and was there because the PostgreSQL
connection pooler was not thread safe so using it from different
thread might cause hard-to-debug issues. If this is confirmed then
the fact you see things working OK is not really reassuring.

For some reason I think https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2690 was
also meant to improve that weird shared connection handling by
deprecating some methods.

Calling QgsPostgresConn::connectDb with shared=false should be OK, right?

I guess, given the assertion was only added in the shared=true case..

I have updated INSTALL to:
Qt >= 5.4.0
Qwt >= 6.1

Just for curiosity, question for C++ experts, how this can compile/work:
    QStringList lineParts = part.split( linePartRx, QString::SkipEmptyParts );
    label = lineParts.mid( 5 ).join( ' ' );
if mid() returns QList<QString> which has no join()?

Min required is GDAL 2.0, I used:

+#if GDAL_VERSION_NUM < GDAL_COMPUTE_VERSION(2,1,0)
   type = QgsWkbTypes::dropM( type );
+#endif

QStringList has a constructor taking const QList<QString> & as an
argument - that is an implicit conversion constructor (it has one
argument and it is not declared as "explicit"), so it allows C++ to
silently convert QList<QString> to QStringList and call
QStringList::join().

Hi all,

+1000 to thank Jürgen for his work.

I think QGIS dev community should also find a way not to rely only on one
person to wear this burden (if it is really the case). I have no clue if
anyone else can help Jürgen ( or if it is necessary , or if Jürgen agree
with this, or if it is already the case...), but I think we should be
cautious. One dedicated and skillfull person as Jürgen is always the more
effective way, but sharing burden and how-tos is also a good thing IMHO.

Regards
Michaël

Thanks for explanation. I should open my C++ book sometimes.

It is strange that compilation was failing with the same clang++
-std=c++11 with Qt 5.3 which has the same
inline QStringList(const QList<QString> &l) : QList<QString>(l) { }

It is called from many places where it is difficult to pass shared
param. I have forced non shared in QgsPostgresConn::connectDb if it is
not main thread.

DD works within the browser now but not for layer with measures.

DD from layer tree to postgres/browser imports the layer (without measures) but:
- the layer is removed from layer tree - intended?
- QGIS crashes sometimes

One traceback below, it crashed when DD failed. I think that the
problem is that it is trying to show an error message which can only
be done on main thread?
The code which is run from QgsTaskManager should never interact with GUI?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Building QGIS 2.18 on OSX
Message-ID: <MMXP123MB1342470140F0E098BD82C878C5F30@MMXP123MB1342.GBRP123.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi everybody,

This is my first post here and I hope there's not already a post related to this, even thought I searched through the list a little.

I have been trying to build QGIS 2.18 for about 3 weeks following a few step by steps I found but none of them gave me success. I'm on OSX 10.12.
I first followed the official step by step from QGIS, and then, other ones using homebrew, but wasn't able to finish the build for the intended version.
I do believe I have a polluted OS and libraries, but I invested around 6 hours cleaning it and my environments to try it all again, and still, no success.

Mainly, I believe my issue is regarding Qt4, which is already deprecated and I'm not able to install it properly. I already tried the .dmg from official's qt website (which crashes) and some cartr and osgeo formulaes from homebrew and still no success.
Somewhere along the configuration and build process I get errors regarding Qt4 or some of their python bindings libraries and even thought I did manage to fix some of them, the build was never able to finish.

Do you guys believe it is still possible to build non-master versions of QGIS on OSX, and if so, what would be some kind of different approach in order to be able to achieve it?

Kind regards,


Helton Costa

I guess this has never been implemented. Looking at
QgsPostgresConn::postgisWkbType, it's only got support for a very
limited range of WKB types (no curves, no m values, won't handle z
types (only 25d types) ). I think it should work ok after that
function is fixed.

Definitely not - I hit this too a week or so ago, and it's far from
ideal! QgsDockBrowserTreeView::dragEnterEvent/dragMoveEvent/dropEvent
has code which is supposed to force a copy action when dragging from
the layer tree, but something's broken there. Any ideas Martin?

That shouldn't be the case (unless there's a bug somewhere). It's true
that tasks should never interact with the GUI in their run()
implementation, but QgsTask::finished should only ever be called from
the main thread and it should be safe to do GUI operations there. From
your crash below it seems like it's crashing after
QgsVectorLayerExporterTask::errorOccurred is emitted - but that's only
ever done from QgsVectorLayerExporterTask::finished . Could you try
putting a temporary assert in QgsVectorLayerExporterTask::finished to
ensure that it's working as designed and being called from the main
thread?

Thanks!
Nyall

Hey Andreas,
I haven't experienced the invalid geometry as you describe, but I did find that my QGIS install had some issues. I have upgraded to 2.18.9 on Win10. If you have a sample of your data available, I would be happy to try to corroborate.

Hello,

about 3-4 weeks ago, I uploaded a QGIS Plugin called BoundaryDelineation to
the QGIS Plugin Repository via http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/.

I haven't heard anything about its acceptance or refusal.

I am not sure if this mailing list is the right place to ask: how can I
find out more about the acceptance status of my plugin?

Best,

Sophie Crommelinck

I opened a ticket:
https://github.com/SCrommelinck/BoundaryDelineation/issues
and received no reply. I'll be glad of publishing it once issues are fixed.
All the best.

Oh my mistake, I haven't seen that open issue.
I solved it by deleting all .pyc files and closed the ticket.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] dwg import 100% cpu?
Message-ID: <CABgOYCeGeuNwZu+=MoB=2ngDhtsOZhaiNx2CozXGJ32mcu-jsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I encounter troubles when trying to import a dwg to a new gpkg using the
dwg import feature from project menu.

I worked well in 2.18.2 and now I get a 100% cpu in 2.18.3 > 2.18.9.

It could be related to that particular dwg file  ( I can't share it here
unfortunately)

Did anyone encounter any trouble?

Is there any available log file I could check to see what's happening?

Cheers
Régis

Bonjour Sophie (since the university in Montpellier ;-) )

You should use a .gitignore file in your git repository with "*.pyc". It
will avoid having you to delete these files everytime.

Hi,
please note that a cleaner directory structure is preferable.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] SIP coverage test removal and Travis optimization
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ZjVG4d8cFeaL=eDBN8APVcsezi93CavYcK6tV3GDS3eg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Our automatic SIP files generation is almost there and I would like to
remove the SIP coverage test from running on Travis.

I think it is harmless since any change on a header will have a direct
impact on the SIP file (or the SIP test will fail if one did not take care
of updating the SIP file).

The idea behind it is a bit of time saving on Travis:

* remove sip coverage test: ~15 sec
* move Doxygen build to the "code_layout" config (rather than on the main
"linux" Travis config) ~30-120 sec (not sure about the time here though)
* move doc coverage test to the "code_layout" config: ~20 sec

Without removing the sip coverage test, we cannot move Doxygen build away
from main build, since the test requires both the python API and the
Doxygen build.

Is this acceptable?
Is there any reason to keep the test (running on Travis)?

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,

final update: the development of what was in phase 1 is done.

Actually, a bit more than phase 1 considering that we've redesigned the
delimited text dialog GUI and I've done quite a bit of small refactorings
of the providers selection dialogs interfaces.

There has been a lot of feed-back, thank you all!

As expected, there is no complete agreement over the final GUI bits for the
menus and toolbars, and we still miss an icon (the green plus that I've
used was only meant as a placeholder). I tried to keep the old toolbar
available (disabled by default) mainly because it can spare a click and
power users might want it back. Also, the new icon is the most prominent in
the left bar and it's the first menu item in the layers menu.

I have not a strong opinion about those toolbars and menus but I think I
should wait no more and merge it as it is, then give the people some time
to test the actual implementation and decide how to improve it.

I kept the controversial part in a single commit so that it will be very
easy to revert and propose a different placement for menus, icons and
toolbars.


Any objections if I proceed?

Well, I build the OS X package.  I recently upgraded to Sierra and it messed up my development setup.  I had problems with QGIS also, but didn't want to spend time figuring it out (I need to build for older systems, and I was way behind on QGIS updates) so I used my other Mac that I kept at Yosemite.

- installing Qt4 - I had already installed Qt4 so running the installer was not a problem.  But what I have is a standard OS X installer package for Qt4, that should not crash anyways.  BUT, it installs a couple important items in /usr/lib and /usr/bin, which are protected in Sierra by SIP and will fail.  You'd have to hack those bits so they are available elsewhere in an unprotected location.  You can use Pacifist to extract installer files so you can put them in custom locations.

- compiling Qt4 - I never had much luck with this in the past, even in supported OS X versions, but it's long past supported OS X versions and you will at least get lots of warnings, if not errors.  Maybe homebrew and the like have patches to work around these, but sounds like you still had problems.

Hi,

In a Python plugin I want to retrieve information about all

In the cookbook [1] it's described how to retrieve thems
  for field in layer.pendingFields():
      print field.name(), field.typeName()

=> But how do I get all "virtual fields" programmatically?

Hi Eugenio,

I've created a sample processing model (attached), that works ok, except a
small error in the result (decimals).

For instance:

*Raster* *ID* *Pixel value*
Z_top_res a 1202,03510276
t_top_res b 53,6123428345
topo c1 -182,584899902
SAGA Result 1 c 15,1783676147
SAGA Result 2 d 31,9437332153 *Diff*
Expected Result 1
15,1783679504 0,000000335741
Expected Result 2
31,9740872222 0,0303540069
*Formula*
1 ifelse(c1>0,-(0.0065*c1-16),(0.0045*c1+16))
2 ifelse(a<500,0,((b-c)/a)*1000)
Using SAGA GUI there is no error.

Could this be because of some roundings in the input / output? (I'm sending
for the developer's list also).

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

In general, but...

> Is there any reason to keep the test (running on Travis)?

There's 2 extra things the sip coverage test does which the sipify test doesn't:

1. Flags if a class is totally missing from the bindings. The sipify
test can't detect when someone's added a new header to the project
without adding a corresponding .sip include to the
core/gui/server/analysis.sip files. Ideally this would be fixed with
some cmake magic which avoids the need to even manually build the
core.sip/gui.sip/etc files...

2. Checks that the methods *are* actually accessible in the Python
bindings. Occasionally there'll be weird things where even though a
method is correctly listed in the .sip files, it just doesn't exist in
the Python library. There's no pattern here - it happens differently
on different platforms. But this is a sip bug, so I don't really care
if we lose this extra check.

For me 1 would need to be addressed before we can drop the test.

Hi Pedro,


thank you again.

If it helps, yesterday I tested the two operation in separate process,

I mean I performed Formula 1 and I saved the result as tif, the I run

the formula 2. I saw that there wasn't errors.

So I guess the problem is when I concatenate the computations in a single process.


Let me know if the developers find out a solution.

Best,

Eugenio

For instance:

Raster  ID      Pixel value

Z_top_res       a       1202,03510276

t_top_res       b       53,6123428345

SAGA Result 2   d       31,9437332153   Diff
Expected Result 1

Formula
1       ifelse(c1>0,-(0.0065*c1-16),(0.0045*c1+16))
2       ifelse(a<500,0,((b-c)/a)*1000)

Using SAGA GUI there is no error.

Could this be because of some roundings in the input / output? (I'm sending for the developer's list also).

Thanks!

Hi Pedro,

thank you very much to have tested the computation with my test data!
You are right, I checked again the computation and actually it works.

However, I was using Saga raster calculation in a processing modeler, and one of the layer I share with you
is the resulting from a previous computation.

In other word the raster layer c=temp_recal.tif comes from a previous computation (raster calculator):
ifelse(a>0,-(0.0065*a-16),(0.0045*a+16))
where a is the layer attached, and hence c of the previous  formula is the resulting of this first computation.

E.

Hi Eugenio,

The result with SAGA Raster Calculator seems ok here, on QGIS 2.18.9, SAGA 2.3.2, both from OSGeo4W64 (result attached).

Z_top_res.tif have values from 724.403 to 1423.553, and so, the first condition is never true. Then, it always make ((b-c)/a)*1000, and the result seems ok to me.

Hi Paolo,

the raster have the same size and origin.
The pixels are precisely overlapped.

I tried also r.mapcalc, but I got a worst result.

and cover topics the community thinks it should.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Split features tool behavior
Message-ID: <CAEdR7WJfWewkiJHzR1=kimsZt7iETy449ohkwMcxwXHBLbtoMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question regarding the behavior of the "split features" tool
when it comes to multipart polygons.
For that I created a small example (see split_features_1.png).

The polygon "1" is a multipart polygon as shown in the screenshot.
Let's say a user wants to split the lower polygon into two in order to
merge one part to the polygon "3" (here the workaround would be the
usage of the reshape features tool) or to create an entirely new
feature. (see split_features_2.png).

The expected result would be a the separated polygon (here on the
right) and the rest of the polygon including the part on the top. 1
Multipart Polygon and 1 Polygon.

The QGIS result is three separate Polygons. This behavior can be
dangerous when editing complex layers.
If furthermore attributes are being changed and aggregations happen
potential errors or unexpected results for a user are imminent.

Other GIS produce the expected output of 1 Multipart Polygon and 1 Polygon.

What is the specific intention behind this behavior as it seems not
quite intuitive?

Cheers
