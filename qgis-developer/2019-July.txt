Coordinates are all just treated as "pure numbers". Distance and area
measurements are unit-less. Scale values have no real-world meaning.
Time and space break down into a singularity where "up" is left and
"right" is tuesday, July (and sometimes never). (ok, everything but
that last one!)

It still knows the CRS, and will show it e.g. in layer properties, but
the project doesn't do anything with this information. It's still
utilised by layer-specific operations though (e.g. saving the layer to
another format).

> - does it still make sense to support projects without a CRS? If yes, what are the use cases?

Yes, for projects which don't use real-world coordinates. E.g.
projects using some local invented coordinate system, buildings,
mapping on tiny scales, mapping off-world objects, creating maps of
fantasy novels or video game worlds,...

I don't think it should ever be deprecated, there's a demonstrated need for it.

It's basically the same argument required to convince CAD designers to
use real world coordinate systems and not just some paper-based
reference system. Fortunately, I think that battle has more-or-less
been won, so maybe the same arguments can be used here...

The other thing to consider is that CRS-less projects are only half
the solution. We also should add concepts of CRS-less layers, which,
when loaded into a project WITH a CRS set, are still always just
treated as raw numbers and not projected in any way.

Hi Harrissou, 

Thanks - I should trust our documentation better ;-) 

Indeed this already answers many of my questions. 

So with this documentation in mind, I can assume that the "no
projection" setting is here to stay and won't be removed in the future -
right? 

But still, when dealing with geographic data, a "no projection" project
should be discouraged ... 

Personally I think that the "no projection" option shouldn't be on the
top (both in the project setting and in the documentation), to really
discourage users from using "no projection". It should be somewhere
below or above the datum transformations, to indicate it that this is an
advanced thing where you really should know what you are doing. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

To all the QGIS Superheroes out there,I desperately need your help!I'm
pulling my hair out, while trying to get some wonderful Javascript/Html

Unfortunately the same problem exists in QGIS 3.x.You find a working example

Hi,

Nathan and Tim, thanks for helping to track down the data source!

I was wondering, if this easter egg was used a lot for trainings, testing,
etc,
wouldn't it be better in the future to swap the shape file for a GeoPackage?

That could also lend itself as a container of other generalized world data
together with their QML/SLD stylings, 
such as points for capital cities.

Right now it seems to me like a good idea but perhaps you can correct me. :)

Best Regards,
Aron

Hi Aron,

that sounds like a great idea!

Would you be able to prepare this file?

Message-ID: <AM0PR08MB38745F93D81F6ABF67B04B3087F90@AM0PR08MB3874.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All,

Been having some issues when upgrading qgis. Initially sent a message to the users mailing list and was directed here. These issues also occur on the desktop application. I am running on ubuntu 18.04.<tel:+441804>

Below is the initial email with the details.

I am having some issues with a project I am working on. Recently upgraded qgis from 2.4 to 2.18 and the raster tiles I had used previously have became very slow to render and flash when panning.

I have turned on multi core rendering and changed the map update interval which seems to set partial rendering of the tiles which has improved performance. But for new tiles that load they still flash white for a large amount of time.

This is for a qt project written in c++ so hopefully this is the right place to ask questions. But if not if someone could point me in the right direction that would be awesome. Any help greatly appreciated!

Many thanks,

Matt

Hi Matthias,

Yes of course. In fact I have already done it for a plugin that I work 
together on with Raymond.
I used the same world_map.shp and also saved the styling into the same 
geopackage as the default style.

Thus happy to proceed forward with this.

Best regards,
Aron

Before I go too far with this I want to check to see if the following
package could be used in QGIS.

astropy (https://www.astropy.org/) has a modified BSD-2 license. See
https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/LICENSE.rst

This would be the library I would pick. It might be an overkill, but in the
long run it could also be used by anyone with imagery from the Moon, Venus,
Mars or any of the planets and it would have all the necessary functions
they would need. The activity on the project is very high. One thing I have
not checked is to see if their algorithms are historically and anciently
accurate which would be of interest to archaeologists.

An astropy add on is astroplan (https://astroplan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
which has the same license and has a number of utilities that use astropy
that calculate sunrise, sunset, moon phase and illumination. It is not as
actively developed, but it may not need to be.

Skyfield (https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/,
https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield/) seems to have a lot of the
basic routines, but it is primarily developed by one person. It has a MIT
license, but seems to be actively developed. This might be my second choice
of libraries.

Hi QGIS contributors,

Sorry about the delay of the publication of the 3.8 visual changelog. 
Responsibilities had been unclear. We want to publish the final version 
of the 3.8 visual changelog on the coming Monday. If you have things to 
add, please do it until Monday.

For now I will link directly to the changelog site.

For version 3.10, the changelog is already open, so you can immediately 
start adding entries.

Thanks and greetings,

The problem with both those libraries is that they are Python only --
this eliminates them as options, since we need c or c++ for it to be
usable in the 3d engine.

I have question about the "Much Improved Coordinate Transform Handling"
feature listed in http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/. Is this
feature going to be supported in the binary distributions of QGIS 3.8? I
just downloaded the Mac 3.8 installer and it only supports GDAL 2.4/PROJ
5.2.

Thanks,
Jeremy

We're playing it safe, and aiming for 3.8.2 for the Proj 6/GDAL 3
migration. Both are huge changes, so we're waiting for wider feedback
and testing on the releases before pushing them out to all users.

Is someone able to edit the categories here? I'd like to rename "Map
Composer" to "Print Layouts", but can't find the option to do this...

Thanks for the warning! I spent some time today re-wording entries and
adding some polish. There's only a couple of empty entries now:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/#allow-browsing-feature-list:
Denis/Matthias, can you please fix?
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/#postgres-provider-add-support-for-generated-identi
: Jürgen can you populate this one?

I also reworded entries to avoid the use of passive tense "A feature
was added which allows use of...", replacing it with the more personal
"WE added a feature... this allows YOU to...". I did this for a number
of reasons:
1. It's more exciting to read. Our releases ARE exciting, so our
changelog should reflect this.
2. It helps convey the message that we are a community of people, and
that features aren't just magically appearing in the app by faceless
drones.
3. It's all our hard work, we should be able to take pride and
ownership of it :D

One thing we could consider in future is mixing the sponsor messages
in the description. eg: "In previous QGIS versions you had to ... .
Now, thanks to sponsorship from ###, you can now directly import...".
This would help move the sponsorship credits from the footer of
entries up to the text itself, which would help us push the message
that "you also can get stuff implemented by being like ### and
sponsoring changes".

Fully agreed - I also find it much more enjoyable to read, and conveys
the idea that we *are* different.

Also agreed.

Maybe we should have a small README with the style conventions we want
to use?

Hi Nyall

You should have the needed permissions to manage them. From the top menu do:

Changelog -> categories


Which should take you here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/category/list/

Yes you are right and saving to PostgreSQL is on our roadmap. I plan to start a crowdfunding campaign later this month to try to gather enough funds to complete the next round of metadata support in QGIS.

You can read more history on our work here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/91

Our roadmap for the future is mostly encapsulated here - though it could probably use some freshening up.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twE8J345Sz1rk1z34672eqlEiL2mJT4bZbuF5oRTCoM/edit?usp=sharing


If you find any prospective funders, please point them in my direction and I will try to aggregate them together to get enough money to fund the next round.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WFS with only geometries?
Message-ID: <54191bbb31296e0ec11fad57504493d9@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am examining questions from our users regarding the publication of WFS
services and the usage of this service in QGIS Desktop as a client: 

 	* Is it possible or valid (OGC compatible) to publish a WFS with only
the geometries and no attributes at all?
 	* Is a primary key column in WFS optional or required?
 	* Are there limitations if there is no primary column published in the
WFS service?

Thank you in advance for your replies, 

Andreas

Sure

>  	* Is a primary key column in WFS optional or required?

Not strictly. But the gml:id / fid of GML features must be stable, and the 
traditional way of doing that is to use the primary key to put it inside. So 
your underlying storage should pretty much have a primary key, even if it is 
not exposed by the service as an attribute.

>  	* Are there limitations if there is no primary column published in the

See above. If your gml:id / fid are not stable, then WFS paging is probably 
going to misbehave. WFS-T will not be usable, etc.

Yes! I agree. 
You can update the path for python3 by executing py3_env.bat.
So a saga_env.bat containing below would be useful


SET SAGA_MLB=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\saga\modules
PATH %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\saga;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\saga\modules;%PATH%

	geometry(Geometry, 4326)
Message-ID: <8c36c815-1a0c-ef3b-a956-c19de1e4d0f7@posteo.de>

Hi,

in OpenStreetMap PostgreSQL/PostGIS database there is a table with a
geometry of type "geometry(Geometry,4326)".

see

 \d+ planet_osm_polygon
 ...
 way                             | geometry(Geometry,4326)
|              |               |             | main       
|               |
 pointonsurface                  | geometry(Point,4326)   
|              |               |             | main       
|               |
 bbox                            | geometry(Polygon,4326) 
|              |               |             | main       
|               | 
 ...

The geometry column "way" is not visible in the layer dialog
(Layer/Layer hinzufügen/PostGIS Layer hinzufügen/):

see
https://wambachers-osm.website/images/osm/snaps_2019/tn_qgis_geometry_problem.png
and
https://wambachers-osm.website/images/osm/snaps_2019/tn_qgis_geometry_problem2.png

Creating views does help, but performance is very poor. That work around
should not be necessary, i think.

This table is really big: >300 GB without indices, 406.807.497 rows,
permanently growing.

Because that is an osm core table, i can't change the geometry of this
column (way) to "geometry( MultiPolygon, 4326)"  because i can't be
shure everything will be running fine after this change. Or will fail if
some core software has been changed.

QGIS 3.8.0 but older releases too. IIRC 2.x was ok.

any ideas?

Regards

walter

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server does not wait for remote SVG before
	rendering
Message-ID: <ab323cae-d3e2-e150-cf69-f358d9d3c264@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

We encountered a strange issue with QGIS Server, a point layer with a 
simple style using a remote SVG.

At the first GetMap request to this layer, QGIS Server rendered an image 
with missing symbol, the ?.

At the second same GetMap Request, QGIS Server rendered an image with 
the remote SVG.

And sometimes the remote SVG is not drawn and replaced by the  ?.

Do you know if the renderer or the styler has a timer to wait for SVG ? 
Is It configurable ? or the context can be configured to wait for svg or 
an error ?

Regards,
René-Luc

On the desktop it's done in a background thread, and the svg/raster
image caches fire a signal when the image is downloaded, triggering a
canvas refresh.

I'm not sure how you could address this with server. Maybe either:
1. (ugly) push some flag via the render context to force the renderer
to wait until a required svg is downloaded, and push this flag into
the svg/ raster image caches.
2. (out of the box) use https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30522 to
check in advance for any remote svg/images required in a project, and
prefetch all these on server startup BEFORE any rendering operation is
requested.

Hi Matthias,

Thanks for keeping this up.

It sounds like OSX hits the same problem with LLVM 8.0.0.

Hi all,

we've just realized that the editor of Processing scripts is "not the
same" as the main python editor. Is it worth to drop one of these and
unify the scripts into a single one?

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtGQEELW7QXkGhTNirfFVHC9hRr2YFedwTRh_y3Akp_29A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 6th-week report for my GSoC Project. You can read this report
better with image and GIF in the weekly report wiki [7]. You can also check
the project wiki page [3]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 6 Report

*Period*: 1 July 2019 - 7 July 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Addressing PR's review for the 3D measuring tool (only a few things)
[2]
   - Play around with Qt3D Experiment with Billboard from Martin [4]
   - Create a mockup for the billboard options and its issue [5]
   - Not so related to the billboard feature, I fix a very small bug in 3D
layer style dialog [6]
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Add UI for the billboard options
   - Port the billboard from Martin's experiment repo to QGIS
   - Testing
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - N/A
4. Code
   - Branch in my repo [1] and the PR [2] for the 3D measurement tool
5. Misc
   - I have an exam and the unexpected deadline for thesis proposal this
week so that I couldn't manage to do a lot of stuff. I have talked with my
mentors about it and I requested to skip the 2nd weekly meeting.
   - On the 6th week, I supposed to have an exam (or any assignments
deadline in my study). It turns out the busiest period is from the mid of
5th week until mid of the 6th week. I will have more free time in the 6th
week, unlike my proposal.

Following all this discussion, here's a quick comparison of before vs current:

Yep - I've previously discussed this with Mathieu -- but we've
actually got more than just the 2 editors, which all need to be redone
into a single united Python script widget (e.g. there's also the edit
Python expression function tab, the project startup macros option,
...)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Backporting right-to-left legend work?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshBZnHKR1aNgEdXHs2S75oMa592fAOQ95KGSo_r27Uecg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just looking for opinions on whether the recent work done enabling
right-to-left language support in print layout legends is suitable for
backporting to 3.8.

My understanding is that this is a big issue for certain locales.

I'd classify the backport as medium risk. Legends are well covered by
unit tests (and the work included numerous additional tests), but
there was quite a bit of refactoring involved, so there's always a
chance of regressions.

Thoughts?

Nyall

(For reference - I can't backport this to 3.4 LTR, as features added
in 3.6 are a pre-requisite for the work)

Thanks Nyall, nice work!

I will update the blogpost and hope that we can add a short intro int
crs & transformations to the docs there:

Hi all,
thanks for clarifying. Indeed a suboptimal situation - worth a qep or a ticket?
Cheers.

Hi All,

Does anyone know if it's possible turn on the tile grid info (bbox, x, y,
zoom) for WMTS/XYZ type layers in QGIS for debugging purposes?

Cheers

Hi Jeremy

I am afraid there is no such run-time option. There are some useful
pieces of debugging code in there, but you would need to do some
adjustments in the source code and recompile QGIS. For example in
qgswmsprovider.cpp in
QgsWmsTiledImageDownloadHandler::tileReplyFinished() there is a block
of code inside "#if 0" / "#endif" which draws tile borders and prints
tile bbox on top of the tile.

Cheers
Martin

That sounds fine to me to backport to 3.8.

By the way, I guess that piece of work also closes this ticket, right?

Hi,
Given the fact that release versions are mostly being used as release
candidates in reality, +1 for a backport. This will let a chance to many
more users to test this before next ltr. Great move!

Hi Tim,

core part should be in the src/core/providers.  And some gui classes was
moved to
src/gui/providers.

Hi

Thanks for the reply Alex! Yeah I had already looked here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/providers

There used to be OGR and GDAL folders in providers and now there aren’t.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Locked layers and styles in layouts - where to see
	used layers?
Message-ID: <1562596277295-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am going to reuse an old project file with 20 layouts which each are
different based on what layers are locked in the layout.

But now the background map source is going to be changed so I have to unlock
layers in all 20 layouts to make them show the new background map. 

But then I will loose the information on what layers should be locked (ie.
included) in each layout.

Anywhere I can see what layers are included/locked in each layout?

Final solution may be to open the project file in an XML editor - it must be
stored there somewhere

I should probably have used "map themes" but it is to late now......

Hi,
See the last example at
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/composer_items/composer_label.html#exploring-expressions-in-a-label-item
to create a list of used layers in a 'map 1' map item.

Hope that helps,

Harrissou

The code return just an empty string but it pointed me at looking at the

I thought I would share with you some results of a survey I conducted
earlier this year. There were 86 responses. Most users were using 2.x
versions of the software, but some were using 3.x. Each person that
responded may of had one or more items. I consolidated the similar
responses so the number in front is the number of people that had the same
basic answer.

17 - Easy to use and conduct analysis when compared with ESRI products.
1 - Editing is easier than with ArcGIS
2.- Supports excellent customization.
1 - Easier work flow for editing and creating figures.
13 - Much faster than ESRI products.
3 - Crashes less often than ArcGIS.
4 - More stable than ESRI software.
6 - Performs better than ESRI Desktop.
1 - Causes less headaches than ESRI software.
1 - Has better functionality and more useful tools than ArcGIS.
1 - More responsive than ESRI products to mouse and keyboard commands.
4 - Can do anything ArcMap can.
1 - Handles displaying big data points better than ArcGIS.
11 - Software is free.
1 - Saves the office $$$.
4 - Freedom from license restrictions.
2 - Free to download and use at home.
5 - Open source
4 - Being open source makes it easy to work with others.
2 - Conforms to OGC standards.
10 - Can easily be extended with plugins.
2 - Extensive 3rd party integration such as GRASS, TauDEM, SAGA, LASTools,
and R
1 - Interesting addons not found in ArcGIS.
1 - Has great toolboxes.
10 - Works with hundreds of data formats.
2 - Produces a standards based GeoJSON file unlike ArcGIS that produces a
modified format.
5 - Provides the very best interaction and support for PostgreSQL/PostGIS
databases. ArcGIS does not work will with PostGIS.
2 - Better database integration.
1 - Can make PostGIS layers based on queries in QGIS.
4 - Full featured GIS application.
1 - 64 bit architecture.
2- Fast integrated GDAL/OGR library operations.
3 - Nice to have an integrated Python console.
1 - Easier to create a filter in QGIS than in ArcMap.
2 - Some QGIS tools work better than what ArcMap provides.
3 - Visualization tools are superior to ArcGIS including better rendering /
blending capabilities.
1 - Has unique geoprocessing capabilities.
1 - Easy to write script to automate tasks.
1 - Like the persistent layer properties window, which makes infinitely
more sense than endless pop-up clicking in Arc.
1 - Like how QGIS handles imagery stretching look-up tables.
1- Like draw pausing and cannot understand why ESRI can't get this right.
2 - Strong user community support.
1 - Can plot csv files onto a map and connect related tables of information.

Extremely interesting, thanks. I believe many different replies can be
combined into more general statements, e.g. More stable and Crashes less
often. In this way it will be easier to draw general conclusions.
Starting from this, it would be good to have a phase 2, with a few of
the most common statements, asking the usual "Strongly agree-Strongly
disagree" kind of questions.
It would be good to write a short blog post for https://blog.qgis.org/
Thanks Calvin!

Hi Harrissou,

The cron job on Travis had apparently been dropped, I recreated it.
docs have been successfully updated.

The API docs is done daily on Travis for master, and weekly for the
releases.

Hi,

I need to access Processing algorithms from the QGIS Server plugin.
But any attempt to call any Processing algorithm failed with following
error message in
the logs

CRITICAL Processing[2960]: Error: Algorithm native:clip not found

In the same time I can access analysis classes like QgsHillshadeFilter
or QgsZonalStatistics.

Is it possible to access Processing algorithms from server plugins?

Thanks

You may need to call the above, before calling  'Processing.initialize()'

I have Processing initialization code in my plugin. Looks like local issue
as on another machine same code works fine.

Thanks and sorry for the noise.

Hi all,

during a training we faced some user side difficulties to create the
widgets, especially with custom values (e.g. Pie Charts exploded slices).

Is it worth to have a UI to help users to define the chart(s)? Should I
open a ticket or a feature request?

Cheers and thanks to all

Hi.
We are currently two main authors for the Midvatten plugin. Currently only
one of us has the possibility to upload new versions. We would like me to
also be able to upload new versions.

Is this possible?

Henrik

You can add "owners" in your plugin webpage settings.

Hi Henrik,

I think you can set one as Maintainer and the other as Owners. It works for
us.

Message-ID: <829667c624b487671e076855e22f4da9@carto.net>

Hi, 

Here is a quite interesting new feature in PostgreSQL 12: 

https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/generated-columns-in-postgresql-12/ 

It is similar to virtual columns in QGIS. 

I suspect that users will want to use that new column type. What does
this mean for QGIS? I guess QGIS will have to detect this new column
type in the future and mark it as "immutable". So other columns are
read/write, but generated columns will be read only. Does QGIS already
support a concept like this where some columns are read/write and others
not? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

One thing it potentially means is auto-generated insert/update-scripts fail, because they insert all fields, including computed columns.
Don’t know how PostgreSQL-12 handles inserts on computed/generated columns though, this is speaking from experience with SQL-server computed columns.
It’s not sure PostgreSQL throws on INSERTs/UPDATEs statements on generated columns though, so theoretically, this column could actually be mutable.
If this feature does nothing more than adding a hidden insert-update trigger, then this might be so, and that wouldn’t necessarily be bad.

Hi Devs,

may I draw ones attention to this (in my view pretty serious) issue:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/28914

Showing off QGIS in combination with a geopackage failed today,
because 'it just does *NOT* work' :-)

Wanted to create an issue and then found the above one
(which is a duplicate of #29035, #29166, #29766  etc)
So added a test dataset to the issue.

The 'Move selection on top' in the attribute table is broken for already
some versions of QGIS. Not sure about others, but I often show this to
newbies, to find their selected features.

I think this kind of basic functionality should not be broken for such a
long time in our beloved QGIS is it?

Any takers?

Regards & hoping somebody can have at least a look at this...,

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_Td2iy7b1ixN6cRu7OA1FWiK94Ypc0v5TCNEOyk6ZP_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just wondering if there is a reason that we have 3 shortcuts to QGIS when
you install on Windows.

- QGIS
- QGIS with Grass
- QGIS with Grass 7.6

Could there be a single exe and always set the grass path?  Given we ship
grass and saga seems odd to run without it given it's only setting the
environment variable at the start from what I can see (haven't looked at
the code).

Has been raised a few times when I have been training people as a source of
confusion.

Regards,
Nathan

GRASS is optional (in OSGeo4W - which is also used for the standalones).  So
the first shortcut is from the QGIS package, the third from the grass plugin
package.  Not sure where the second is from - there should only be two.

Hi Matteo  
I like the idea, since it's for many users hard to hack something in QML.  
This feature can reach from very basic helping features until complex code-creating stuff. So I think it makes sense to open a feature request to discuss the details there.  


Thanks and cheerio

speaking about unsupported postgresql features it would also be very
useful supporting correctly column permissions, the last time I
checked (not recentli I admit) it didn't worked at all in QGIS.

I agree. Like (to hear) it or not but this is not the only case of
"rollercoaster" (broken/fixed/broken again/etc.) of (arguably) basic
functionalities in QGIS 3.*

totally agree. I discovered today that the gdal contour lines is also
broken in dev:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/30669

as stated in the issue, I thought this was covered by tests:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/tests/GdalAlgorithmsRasterTest.py#L403

thanks a lot for the report. I'm also surprised, as I assumed this basic
functionality was covered by tests. Should we invest more in adding
tests in this area?

Test on the GUI are very very limited, and they are also quite hard to
write and to maintain.

If you add that the attribute table code has been crying for a serious
refactory since 2.x you know why it's broken (again).

But yes, we should invest more in the tests AND in the refactoring of the
code, the problem IMO with the attribute table is that it would be a *huge*
effort.

Another issue regarding testing, not speaking about that particular case, is 
that for continuous integration we test Linux, but not Windows, so Windows 
specific issues, or general issues that trigger more easily on Windows, can be 
easily missed.
Could be a good investment to support someone, and needed infrastructure, 
who'd be willing to setup a Windows CI.

Hi Rainer,

There has been a question for a minimal example to reproduce the problem 
on the bugreport.

I have come up with 
https://github.com/m-kuhn/qmap_initializer_compile_time but don't easily 
have an environment available to reproduce the problem. Are you able to 
verify the issue with the code before, so it can confidently attached to 
the issue?

Thanks
Matthias

A cynical joke :)

I think you are talking about something like this ? 
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/277677/qgis-problem-with-postgresql-postgis-column-permissions 

Correct working depends on the SQL-statements issued by QGIS. 
If it updates values in columns where no value changed, it requires GRANT-UPDATE rights to this columns. 

This is more of a SQL-generation problem than a permission issue. 
It shouldn't issue updates on values that didn't change, but it does. 

And if you update values where you don't have update rights, that generates an SQL error. 

Besides, how are column-level permissions supposed to work ? 
What happens if you load a value from a column where you don't have permission, and then save/update back the fields of a record where you have permissions. 
The result is potential data garbage.  
The entire idea of partial data loading AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SAVE the loaded data (or parts thereof) back is a somewhat fishy concept. 
Either you can alter an entire record, or you cannot. 

At this point it would be worth pointing out that seeing a subset of available records (e.g. via portfolio rights) presents similar issues. 
Are different users going to see different results when they sum areas, for example ? 
Are they going to do some financial calculation with the result ? 
Who sets the permissions, and how do you guarantee permissions are set properly ? 
Are any unfortunate combination of permissions gonna crash the system ? Gonna cause malfunctions ? 
Query performance - is it going to grind the system to a halt ? 

If anybody is going to implement any kind of permissions, you need to think about ALL the consequences first, and also whether or not that makes sense in the first place, especially considering the computational complexity this adds to your program.  And then you need to decide if that added value is worth the costs it incurs, especially including opportunity costs.

oh really?! column level permissions works only if the user is superuser? is that a feature or bug? of qgis or postgresql? :)

cheers!

Hi all,
I'm working on a plugin that prints a report at the end of the process in a
log text area of the GUI. I'd like to add an option (maybe a checkbox) to
save the content of the log and the image of the map area as a single
multipage pdf file.

Is it possible with the standard libraries or it requires external
dependencies? Do you have any documentation to suggest?

Thanks in advance

Roberta

Sure. You would be able to do this with a QPainter. Have a search for print
pdf using At and you should get something. We use the built on At libs to
render layout prints.

Thank you Nathan,
I found some documentation about QPainter but I'm not able to find
something interesting about At lib..do you have any specific link?

Using the solution that you suggested, is it possible to set graphic
effects? for instance bold or italic characters, font size, text spacing
and justification, ecc.

Thank you!

Roberta

Sorry that should have been Qt libs.  Phone auto correct doesn't understand
"Qt".

Here is a good example for you that should work out of the box.  This is
C++ but it's the same logic for PyQt:

Oh sorry, I should have understood that you meant Qt..

Thank you so much, Nathan!  Your link seems to be exactly what I need.

Thanks again!

Hi Matthias, Rainer,

Matthias, I tested but unfortunately I can't reproduce the problem with this
code. Tested with llvm 6, 7 and 8 on FreeBSD 12 and 13 amd64.

But, of course :), the problem is still present for QGIS with llvm 8.0.1 on
FreeBSD 13.

For information, I created a CI on Cirrus for FreeBSD 12 and here the
results: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5576588232491008 and my fork of your
repository https://github.com/lbartoletti/qmap_initializer_compile_time

Thanks to take care about this issue.

Loïc

Hi Loïc,

Thanks for the feedback.

Any idea what else could be tried?

Unfortunately I do not have a system where I could quickly try, so I am 
out of possibilities and ideas for now ...

Best regards

Matthias

Hi Matthias,

sorry for the late answer, but I was busy at work

My skill on C++ and CMAKE are very limited. The following steps should
show, what I did and hopefully understood right:

- create a local directory 'qmap_initializer_compile_time'
- download your files into the dir
- create a second dir 'qmap_initializer_compile_time_BUILD' one level up
- run 'cmake ../qmap_initializer_compile_time' in the latter
  (compilation takes only a moment)

  -- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 8.0.1
  -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++
  -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ -- works
  -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info

- Do I have to run ./qmap_initializer_compile_time after this (?)
- How long do I have to wait then ... (?)

I suspect, that my last steps are inappropriate to get the compile time
of QMap? I could use some help here ...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement: Week 7 Report
Message-ID: <CAEh5jtEgvZtyPpKav_HxxKhKZzs++jDpL_D0NvdskNxDFcMYcw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 7th-week report for my GSoC Project[7]. You can also check the
project wiki page [3]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 7 Report

*Period*: 8 July 2019 - 14 July 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Porting billboard from QML to QT C++ [4] as my discussion with mentors
to start from outside QGIS first.
   - Learning GLSL
   - Add UI for the billboard options (very initial work only) [1]
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Move the ported billboard to QGIS code
   - Work on the applying billboard workflow
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Debugging in 3D stuff is not easy. Especially when something is not
shown up and no error message. I got an obstacle when the billboard didn't
show up. But finally Martin helps me, and it's fixed.
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [4]
5. Misc
   - As I wrote on the previous weekly report, I only had a half time for
working on GSoC compared to the usual week.
   - PR for measurement tool is merged [2]
   - There are two small bugs in the measurement tools, I have created the
issues for myself [5] [6]. I will address it later.
   - For the next 3 weeks, I have different course schedule, so we will
move our weekly meeting schedule.

Also (it's not defence, but...) I seem to recall this particular bug
popping up in various forms since forever. Someone will post a
(partial?) fix, and then a month later the bug will be bug (maybe in
another form?). In any case, I very much doubt this is a 3.x
regression, rather just some piece of fragile code which was
sticky-taped together in the first place, and that sticky-tape keeps
coming undone.

Unfortunately (and I hate to give bad news like this), but I'm with
Alessandro here. Attribute table is the most fragile code left in
modern QGIS versions. It's inefficient, difficult to debug, constantly
regressing, and the code is a nightmare mix of interdependent circular
signals. The code is honestly horrible to work with, which is another
reason I suspect attribute table bugs are "overlooked" during bug
fixing sprints...

Hi Nyall, all,
so you're implicitly suggesting refactoring this code entirely, right?
I imagine this would be a major effort. Does anybody have an idea of the order of magnitude of the work involved?
Regards.

Yes, it needs a similar rework as has been done in the past with
symbology, vector iteration, print layouts, processing, layer
tree/legend etc. It's the oldest foundational code still in use in
QGIS today and is overdue for a rethink and rebuild.

> I imagine this would be a major effort. Does anybody have an idea of the order of magnitude of the work involved?

Well, Alessandro and I debated in the past whether or not to submit
this as a grant proposal, but in the end decided that the work
required was too large for available grant funds (and was too painful
to undertake on a partially funded/semi-volunteer basis). There's a
lot involved, because attribute table also includes forms and editor
widgets.

In my view the editor widget code itself is in decent shape, but the
form code has drifted far from its original design and had too many
extra parts bolted on, and now needs a (code) redesign. The attribute
table dialog/view and model need completely reworking, with
performance specifically in mind.

Hi Nyall,
sounds reasonable to me. So the order of magnitude is in the tens of thousands €/$, right?
This sounds a case for an ad hoc sponsoring.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Procesing pyqgis with alg decorator
Message-ID: <74b7f087-534d-de51-9922-cdeff0ec1828@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying a super simple script in Processing with the alg decorator
syntax.

Basically I'm not doing anything, but a weird error is thrown when I try
to append vector layer features to a list:

NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before assignment in
enclosing scope
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/matteo/dev/build-QGIS-Desktop-Default/output/python/plugins/processing/gui/AlgorithmDialog.py",
line 244, in on_complete
    self.feedback.pushInfo(self.tr('Execution completed in {0:0.2f}
seconds').format(time.time() - start_time))
NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before assignment in
enclosing scope


And this the super small script:


from qgis.processing import alg
from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsFeatureSink

@alg(name="myalg", label=alg.tr("My Algorithm"), group="examplescripts",
group_label=alg.tr("Example Scripts"))
@alg.input(type=alg.SOURCE, name="INPUT", label="Input layer")
@alg.input(type=alg.SINK, name="OUTPUT", label="Output layer")

def myalg(instance, parameters, context, feedback, inputs):
    """
    Description goes here. (Don't delete this! Removing this comment
will cause errors.)
    """
    source = instance.parameterAsSource(parameters, "INPUT", context)

    (sink, dest_id) = instance.parameterAsSink(
        parameters,
        "OUTPUT",
        context,
        source.fields(),
        source.wkbType(),
        source.sourceCrs()
    )

    l = []

    features = source.getFeatures()

    for current, feature in enumerate(features):

        l.append(feature)

        out_feature = QgsFeature(feature)
        sink.addFeature(out_feature, QgsFeatureSink.FastInsert)

    return {"OUTPUT": dest_id}

Some ideas?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hi Tim,

Hehe, yeah, I am the one who missed it. I put it in my billboard repository
now: https://github.com/ismailsunni/qt3d-custom-shader/blob/master/README.md
(both
screenshot and screencast). I will update my weekly report to show the
screenshot and the screencast.

You can also see it here:

   1. Screenshot:

   2. Screencast in GIF:

Thanks for reminding me :)

Best Regards

Thanks! Do the billboards always face the camera? Or can you fly behind them? And will you give them a little pin and frame to anchor them to a place?

Nice screencast. Are billboards able to handle alpha/opacity channel for a
given raster?

Hi Tim and Mathieu,

Thanks! Do the billboards always face the camera? Or can you fly behind
> them?


It will always face the came, by definition :).

And will you give them a little pin and frame to anchor them to a place?


Do you mean like a line to connect the billboard to the terrain? There is a
wishlist for that. But the first step, render this billboard on QGIS first.

 Nice screencast. Are billboards able to handle alpha/opacity channel for a
> given raster?


Do you mean the billboard is transparent and we can see the stuff behind
it?

Well, I am not in that level of understanding of this 3D rendering. But I
can say it's not easy to do something transparent in the 3D world. Since we
need to reconsider how it will be done (without transparency means we just
ignore the covered surface of the 3D objects, while with transparency we
need to know the order of the object). That's what I got from my discussion
with Martin. *Please correct me if I am wrong Martin :)

Best regards/

I imagined more they would behave like real billboards, facing a particular
direction (or at least having the option to do that).

For billboards that do not rectangular shape (a circle) yes that should be
possible and easy to support fully transparent pixels. For semi-transparent
images, there will be an issue, rendering output is not going to look good
without some special techniques because of how Z buffer works and because
objects would need to be always rendered back to front (from camera's view)
for alpha blending to be correct.

Cheers
Martin

Sure,

After some fiddling I finally found the link to the proposals again.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzgLJ-hy2GtcWrAy5geivhDDdXRGJUDcikCWUtXRe9k/edit#heading=h.cuzf1c5o2ciq

Basically the idea is to do pretty much the same thing as the GitHub 
Backporting App (https://github.com/tibdex/backport#goal). The app will 
listen to label changes and state (open/close) changes and open issues 
on the docs repo accordingly, but could very well also call other REST 
APIs upon such events. The result should be a fairly generic and open 
source Github App, that can be installed on any repo and configured via 
a yaml file inside the repo.

Best regards

Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] prj files not used when adding layer by drag and
	drop
Message-ID: <1563275166108-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have a shapefile with projection defined in a prj file.

If I open it using the menu it is shown as expected with no questions about
projection.

If I drag and drop the shp file onto the canvas I am asked to choose the
projection (from scratch - prj file apparently not read).

The actual shapefile has no qpr file

Hi all,
I just noticed that the current version of psql in osgeo4w fails to
display functions on pg11, because of[0].
Upgrading to psql11 solves the issue.
Should I file a ticket?
Thanks a lot.

I don't see what you're seeing, but I do get a crash when running your
alg. Can you confirm that removing the "l" list fixes it for you?

Very strange...

yes exactly, without appending the features to the list all is working
smooth. No idea what is happening..

Message-ID: <b565b692-8477-2cd7-8dd8-db73e0c0104c@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed some problems with the attribute table vs related map view on
recent 3.9 on linux:

* when loading a layer and opening the attribute table, the map view is
automatically zoomed to the first element (not what a user want I guess)
* if the "Show features visible on map" is selected, then the map view
literally gets crazy: it is impossible to pan, zoom in/out, etc, until
the option "Show features visible on map" is deselected. For this second
problem I filed an issue [0]

Somebody confirms?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Matteo,
In Form view or table view? If form view, can you check that you don't have
the "new" zoom to current feature button pressed (bottom of left panel)?
Cannot confirm here but I don't have a very recent build and am struggling
to get a working build right now.

Regards,
Harrissou

both views but deactivating some button in the form view seems solving
the problem.

Maybe it's me, but I think that having the zoom button only in form view
while the behavior is in both views is a little bit confusing. Not sure,
but deactivating the button when closing the attribute table?

Cheers and thanks

My either - my suspicion would be it's a bug in PyQt/sip or the QList
conversion -> python conversion code. These are very tricky to track
down unfortunately, and it's usually easier to find a way to
workaround on the Python side.

just for info, it happens also with dictionaries..

no problem if the same logic is applied to the standard not-decorator
script.

Hi QGIS core devs, 

Currently on the Github issues I have the (subjective) feeling that
every third report is about QGIS crashing on closing the program. It
seems to be a really wide-spread issue that a majority of our users
have. It would be great for QGIS' reputation if we could fix this/these
issue(s). Or has this already been fixed and people don't use the newest
versions? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

These are VERY frustrating. It's actually a bunch of different
underlying issues causing this. We've probably squashed a dozen or so,
but they keep resurfacing (or being re-introduced), and none of the
existing bug reports have clues on remaining causes.

Fortunately they are harmless. Mathieu has previously suggested we
just shut down the crash reporter on QGIS exit to avoid this -- I
think that would be a worthwhile change.

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for the reply. I also experienced quite a lot of these crashes.
Something that often shows up in the stack trace is 

proj_lpz_dist :
proj_lpz_dist :
QgsCoordinateTransform::transformPolygon :
QgsCoordinateTransform::transformPolygon :
QgsCoordinateTransform::QgsCoordinateTransform :
QHashData::free_helper :
QgsCoordinateTransform::addToCache :
QgsCoordinateTransform::invalidateCache :
QgsApplication::exitQgis :
QgisApp::~QgisApp :
CPLStringList::operator char * __ptr64 * __ptr64 :
main :
BaseThreadInitThunk :
RtlUserThreadStart : 

Like in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/30753 

But I am sure you also came across these. 

Really annoying. Perhaps disabling the crash reporter on QGIS exit on
the release versions would help? Can we enable them just on the master?

Hi Paolo, 

We might have just read the same article? Like
https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-postgresql-passwords-to-scram
or similar? 

I think it depends on the libpq version that QGIS is built against. If
it is version 10 or higher than it should just work. Just convert
already existing md5 to scram-sha-256 in PostgreSQL and edit pg_hba.conf
to use that new method. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

While discussing this further with Nathan, disabling the crash reporter
might not be the right solution as it'd most likely bring the OS crash
dialog anyways.

We'd need for the crash reporter to detect specific traces and silently
fail when it detects a useless / harmless trace.

There's also the problem of ppl pasting wrong traces due to not having
installed the debug package, we could improve the notification in this
scenario to suggest installing package.

Yeah, in this case, the stack trace is wrong because of the lack of
symbols.  The symbols could be installed with QGIS at the increase of
package size but maybe we can do that for a while until we catch this issue.

At the moment installing the symbols for the normal installer versions of
QGIS is a bit hard for most users.

Jurgen, would we be able to include the debug symbols for the build on the
normal installers for once release cycle while this is still an issue? That
would be super handy to catch this and other issues that come up.

In the meantime, if we have fellow Andreas able to reproduce an exit crash,
let's help him install the debug package and get a valid trace?

Andreas, that is, if you're game.

You can already install the qgis-pdb package using the normal installer.  The
normal installer is also shipped with the standalone, so you could also use
that to install pdbs afterwards.  They cannot be included in the standalone as
we're already near to NSIS' 2GB limit (maybe once the GRASS package is ported
to python3, so we can drop all python2 - but I gues not as the pdbs are huge)

We also have a symbol server - but given the nightlies it's huge and needs to
be aged out quickly (a week I think) so the release symbols probably don't last
long.  Running nightlies for this kind of thing should help.

Hi, 

Unfortunately I am of no good use currently to test this, as I just
recently switched jobs and currently only have access to Linux as
sysadmin. In Windows I currently don't have admin rights. And I don't
own a private copy of Windows. I am working on getting admin rights on
Windows as well, but it might take a few days/weeks to get that from the
central IT services. First need to convince them that I am trustworthy
and that it is useful for me to have the admin rights. 

But I am pretty sure that others who reported that issue would be
willing to help. 

However, if these crashes happen on Linux I can provide proper stack
traces with debug symbols enabled. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Thanks Jürgen,

Yeah I know it was a bit much to have them included.  I will see what I can
do with my install and hopefully get a good stack trace.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is the measurement tool using proj library?
Message-ID: <130366490e1a0ca59bced9b5d364648b@carto.net>

Hi, 

We are having issues on the QGIS 3.4 release that the difference between
and ellipsoidical and planimetric distance (and area) is huge. Too huge.


We have this issue on Windows 3.4.9, but on Linux (a bit newer commit) I
don't have the same huge difference, but rather a very reasonable one. 

I noticed that while the Windows version was built with proj 520 and the
Linux version with 493, so a bit older. 

But I don't know if the measurement tool in QGIS is using proj at all or
not? If yes, could it be that newer proj releases made things worse
regarding ellipsoidical measurements? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Devs,

I am writing a processing algorithm which uses multiple QgsProcessingLayerPostProcessorInterface based postprocessors to postprocess and load result layers.

The post processing itself works fine, however I would like to control the execution order of post processors to get a particular final layer order in the QgsLayerTree.

Is there a way to do it?

Regards,
Tej

Andreas,

How do your results compare with the "Shape Tools" measurement tool? It is
based on the geographiclib library.

QGIS 3.8 crashes most times for me on exiting and I have also found it to
be fairly unstable. I have had it corrupt one of the saved files so that
when it tried to load it, it would just hang. The georeferencing almost
always crashes or delivers strange results. I have not reported on it
because I have not been able to come up with repeatable steps to cause it
to crash, but the net result is I now am only using QGIS 3.4.9 for real
work and 3.8 to play around. I am hoping that the next release will fix
some of the reliability problems.

It's possible. The actual measurement calculation uses code ported
from GRASS (and not the proj implementation of these algorithms), but
proj IS used in transforming map/measure coordinates prior to
calculating the distance. Possibly something has changed there which
is impacting this.

Could you please test:

1. Do you see the same distance values when measuring feature lengths?
I.e. setup a layer with a feature with the same line as you are
measuring, and check the identify tool derived attributes or $length
value for it.

2. Can you confirm that the project ellipsoid settings are identical
between the windows & linux builds?

3. Can you share an example I can test with?

Not via existing API. But I think you could work around this by making
your post-processor also handle moving the layer's position in the
layer tree as desired? E.g. if each post processor has logic to check
where in the layer tree the layer has been inserted, and move it if
it's not in the desirable location with respect to other possible
layers, then the processors should be robust against execution
order...

I don't think the trace *is* wrong here. The recurring source of these
issues is that long-lived objects which have QgsCoordinateTransform
members are being cleaned up AFTER QgsApplication::exitQgis, where the
proj library handling is gracefully cleaned up. After
QgsApplication::exitQgis NOTHING should be accessing coordinate
transforms.

Actually I just had an idea for a potential workaround... let me see
if this works...

Hmm pretty sure if is wrong. Without debug symbols it doesn't know what
code is running and just has a good guess. A stack trace with symbols will
show a completely different stack

This is a tipical problem with threaded applications.
Some thread is not correctly shut down before app shutdown.

Hello, everybody,

One of our customers uses QGIS 3.x to create pyramids in batch mode.  Without batch mode, i.e. individual TIFs, it works fine, but in batch mode the following messages appear:

--- begin -------------------------------------------------

Does anyone have an idea?

Hi Nyall and others, 

I was wrong, there is no difference in behaviour between proj493 and
proj520. Nor is there a difference between Linux and Windows. 

We, as a user, made the mistake of creating test data in a new empty
layer at around (0,0) and my colleague in a totally different area in
the coordinate system in an area that isn't valid for the EPSG:2056
projection. The EPSG:2056 projection only works reasonably well in the
bound of approx. 2485000 1075000 2828500 13000000 

It produces bogus results if the user creates data outside of this
boundary, like at around 0,0. 

I was so embarrassed that it took me so long to find out our mistake.
For the longest time I thought it was some bug in QGIS or proj, only to
find out that both myself and my colleague created our test data outside
of the valid bounds of the projection at totally different locations,
but both outside of Switzerland. If we had some base layer below our
test data rather than just creating empty project with no background
maps, it wouldn't happen. 

When I moved the testdata into the valid bounds of the projection, the
area difference between planimetric and ellipsoidic area was less than a
square meter. 

For myself, I decided to never make fun again about other people not
understanding projections, given that I make such mistakes myself ... 

I wonder if it would make sense to issue a warning if a user creates
data outside of the valid bounds of a projection? It would definitely
make sense for stupid people like myself ... 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

Glad I'm not the only one who has made this mistake!!

This sounds like a good idea to me. When would you propose that we
raise the warning? Possibly on saving edits to a layer?

ok... a possible fix was implemented for 3.8.1 and 3.4.10. Fingers crossed!

I had this moment of realisation too while reading through

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2019-July/008703.html
and
https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/StephaneP/diary/390290

(all those "spatial isn't special" proponents trying to do data
science on raw x/y alone are about to have a ten ton weight dropped on
their heads)

Calvin,

A fair amount of crashers and stability issues have been resolved in 3.8.1,
which'll be out in a few days. Give that a try.

If you still find it unstable, actionable information describing crashes
and issues are needed (since you're a plugin dev, I'm sure that's familiar
to you ;) ). If a project file hangs QGIS, fill and issue with the project.
Same goes for the georefencer or other bugs you stumble on.

Best

Hi,

I'm trying to connect to the MSSQL server with QGIS native MSSQL provider
on Windows. Database server uses standard port, TCP/IP access is enabled.
After specifying connection name, host and username/password and pressing
"Test connection" button I get an error

Error opening connection : Driver not loaded Driver not loaded

On other hand if I setup a system DSN using same parameters and
specify DSN instead of the host in the QGIS connections dialog
everything works.

Am I miss something or native MSSQL provider works only with ODBC even
on Windows?

Ah, before testing connection one should get list of the databases.
Quite confusing and not coherent with all other database providers.

Sorry for the noise.

The UI itself is not coherent with the other providers.

Oh well, several issues with the pdbs.

The setup.hints were missing from the release pdb packages in OSGeo4W - thanks
Hugo for noticing - so although they were there, they didn't appear in the
package listing (just the pdbs for nightlies).

After the migration to a new infrastructure some time ago the symstore redirect
that was originally in place to cover for the space issues that the original
infrastructure had, was not reinstated.  So the symbols weren't available from
there anymore either.

Expiry of that symstore was a problem too as the release pdbs got cleaned away
along with old nightly pdbs.  The latter needed cleaning as they would
otherwise quickly use vast amounts of disk space - but I found no way to
exclude the former from that.  So the symstore wouldn't not have been too
useful for the release builds anyway.

I've now introduced several symstores: one for each package (qgis-ltr,
qgis-ltr-dev, qgis, qgis-rel-dev, qgis-dev) and architecture.  And those are
built from the actual pdb packages on the download server after upload using
the python package symstore.  I think that package didn't exist, when we
started with the pdbs and the only way to built the symstore was using the
windows binary - so the symstore had to be maintained on the build machine and
rsynced to the server.  So that's greatly simplified now.

I've implemented 5ed9efb3b60 to make use of this in master - the release
branches will follow.

Yes - on saving a layer it it would make sense to check against the 
valid boundaries of a projection (if we have this information 
available). Probably not during editing. I think it should not prevent 
saving, if someone wants to that, but a warning in the messagebar would 
be useful to have, or perhaps even with a yes/no question - do you 
really want to save? Do you know what you are doing?

Thanks,

Andreas

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_HV53B81c1g8dUVU2WKCczUVcbNQmV=4G0Z+PK=c+SqsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had some frustrations with the DB Manager save query functionality. At
some point I finally understood that, if there is some selected code, only
that part is saved.

To me it's weird, because when you save, the rest of the code is maintained
in the SQL editor, and the name of the query is showned in the topo.

But, when I turn of my project and open it again, surprise surprise, only
the selected part is in the Query.

Bug or feature?

Hi Alexandre,

It's my bad, I used _getSqlQuery 
<https://github.com/lbartoletti/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/db_manager/dlg_sql_window.py#L557> 
insted of self.editSql.text().

For me a feature must be documented and for this one the user must have 
the choice between the full text or the selected part. So it's a bug or 
I add this option and the doc.

Regards,

Loïc

Greetings,

I'm trying to check the image generated by my tests and I noticed that the
cdash log was quite empty. I also noticed that the provided tinyurl link at
the end of the build lead to a 500 error.

I'm not sure what is going on recently with cdash or if the move away from
cdash is intended.

Does anyone know what might be going on or is it only on my end?

Thanks,

I agree that it can be a feature, but needs to be more explicit to the user.

My problem is that I was creating several instructions and running them one
by one. Then, in the end, I wanted to save everything and didn't realize
that there was a selection.

Documentation alone won't be enough IMHO. So, maybe a check box with "Save
selected only?

Anyway, thanks for making saving available.

Alex

Hi,

Is there any other software with this behavior to "save only selected"? 
Or a use case where this is desirable?

 From top of my mind I can't find anything and I think all our other 
editors always save the full text, regardless of selection.

Regards

Matthias

Hi all.
I agree, the default should be save all. Having the option of savings only selected could be handy.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Difficulties with custom bad layer handler in
	plugin code
Message-ID: <8f36c6ca-1673-6a4b-88b5-b965bcf3daa6@rasterra.nl>

Hello to all contributors,

I am trying to implement a custom bad layer handler that I would ship 
with a plugin (for QGIS 3.4 and above).

The plugin creates map layouts and places a default world map layer in 
them, which we ship with the plugin.
However when users shave the project file and share it among each other, 
many find this layer to be broken.
The layer points to a data in the plugin path, which is not the same 
across machines.

The custom bad layer handler would try to see if this specific layer is 
broken and fix it for the user,
then call the regular bad layer handling "file dialog" to allow them to 
fix any eventual broken layers that are unrelated to the plugin.

I am creating my bad layer handler by subclassing QgsProjectBadLayerHandler,
thin I pass it to QgsProject by calling its setBadLayerHandler() method.
Since I want to pass it before any layer is actually loaded (so when 
launching qgis to open a project file, it would work right away)
I had to resort to a sort of ugly way of using the 
QgsProject.layerLoaded signal to make this happen.

This actually works, for the 1st time when I open a project file with 
bad layers. Then the 2nd time, QGIS always crashes.
It seems once I replaced the bad layer handler during project start, 
QGIS is not able to open a subsequent new project properly.

Here is my example in code:

class MyBadLayerHandler(QgsProjectBadLayerHandler):
     """ This is a custom bad layer handler that would work as the default 
one, except it would automatically fix a specific layer that is broken. 
""" def __init__(self, path):
         QgsProjectBadLayerHandler.__init__(self)
         self.validLayerPath = path

     def handleBadLayers(self, domNodes):
         # Some logic to look for a specific DomNode to fix, oversimplified here: 
for domin domNodes:
             dataSource =self.dataSource(dom)

             if dataSourceis 'the broken path to the layer I want to fix':
                 # set correct data source then force re-read self.setDataSource(domNodes, self.validLayerPath)
                 QgsProject.instance().readLayer(dom)

         # TODO: after this, call the GUI file dialog as in the default bad layer 
handler, to allow the user to fix # any other broken layers... not sure 
how to do this class MyPlugin:
     """My plugin""" def __init__(self):
         self.validPath ='valid path to layer' self.badLayerHandler =None def hackyAndUglyReplacer(self, i, n):
         """ This hacky ugly function is to replace the bad layer handler early 
on, before any layers would be loaded. it is meant to be connected to 
the `layerLoaded` signal of `QgsProject` """ # do not run further if 
there were other layers loaded before (e.g. the signal was emitted 
before) if i !=0:
             return if not self.badLayerHandler:
             self.badLayerHandler = MyBadLayerHandler(self.validPath)
             QgsProject.instance().setBadLayerHandler(self.badLayerHandler)

     def initGui(self):
         # start-up code here... #connect to signal QgsProject.instance().layerLoaded.connect(self.hackyAndUglyReplacer)

     def unload(self):
         try:
             QgsProject.instance().layerLoaded.disconnect()
         except Exception:
             pass


Does anyone know what am I doing wrong here? Have I missed something?
Why does QGIS crash every 2nd time?

I would be happy to pass the bad layer handler a better way than with 
the current signal above. But the other signals I found are emitted 'too 
late' already.
Perhaps here I am also doing something wrong?

I tried looking for help but the web barely has any trace of 
documentation on this.

I also tried to see how this is done in other plugins e.g. the 
changeDataSource plugin, but the authors  seem to have removed the code 
when they ported the plugin to QGIS 3.x
(perhaps a bad sign)

In general it seems to me this part was also overhauled in QGIS3 but 
there aren't many leads to follow on what is the current way of using 
custom bad layer handlers.

Maybe if we could put the story together on how to do this correctly, I 
could document it and put it on the web for others to refer to.

Hope you are having / had a great Sunday!

Best regards,
Aron

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtGzB3jGB-9+JcSDJCezxWFvrMp+3Xm-3GAw53YmsUJAqA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 8th-week report for my GSoC Project[4]. You can also check the
project wiki page [2]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)


GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 8 Report

*Period*: 15 July 2019 - 21 July 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Porting Billboard functionality from my experimental repo[3] to QGIS
codebase[1]. Success with a static image, and currently polishing with
default symbol (still looks ugly symbol).
   Sample result can be watched below (click and it will play on YouTube):
    - QGIS 3D Billboard Rendering with Succes Kid (static) (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxsu0ZaDd0k)
    - QGIS 3D Billboard Rendering with Default QgsSymbol - still ugly (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Tv7y07vXg)
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Make the billboard shows symbol from user
   - Polishing
   - Fill 2nd evaluation
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - It seems, adding an image (not from a file) to the texture is not
straight forward.
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [3]
5. Misc
   - N/A

Hi Sunni

Thanks for the update! Maybe I missed it, but what is planned to eventually go in the billboard? The kid pic is nice for a proof of concept but have you made a concept render of the how the final thing will look? It would be nice for the billboard to use the tooltip text or the label text - it that the plan? I’m still not convinced it wouldn’t be better having the billboard facing a fixed (or used defined fixed) direction but maybe I am alone in this….when I watch the youtube clip the boards seem to go ‘flat on the ground’ and lose their 3d representation. 

Regards

Tim

Couldn't you achieve the same result by setting your bad layer handler
directly in initGui?

># TODO: after this, call the GUI file dialog as in the default bad layer handler, to allow the user to fix

The bad news is -- unfortunately you cannot. The inbuilt bad layer
handler isn't exposed to Python in any way, and as soon as you set a
new bad layer
handler method the existing inbuilt one is completely deleted.

I've been thinking about a similar situation recently, where a
client's IT department is continually replacing network paths and
moving things around (they do it roughly every 6 months, with no
notice in advance. yep.) This breaks many many paths in their qgis
projects, but the fix is actually super simple since we know what the
network path used to be and what it is now. So what I've been
pondering is whether we need a new hook to allow a "data source
pre-processor" function to be specified, much in the same way that
custom bad layer handlers would be. This would be called BEFORE
resolving any raw paths, and would simply take an input data source
string and return a processed version of it. (e.g. by replacing
outdated network paths with their new equivalent). In this way it
would be transparent to users -- the paths would be automatically
updated, and then they'd only see the bad layer handler dialog IF an
updated path still doesn't exist.

Does this sound like what you're seeking?

+1 to that. If a user really needs to save only a selected portion I
think it's fine to require them to copy that part to a text editor and
save from there. I'd rather not overload the UI with two options "save
all"/"save selected bit only", it's just overkill.

It was moved recently to https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

The link at the bottom of Travis results is still broken so you need
to manually go to dash to fetch results.

do we have simple instructions on how to get and send a valid log?
I don't think this is widely known, even to interested users.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingAlgorithm: no output layer when
	cancelled
Message-ID: <b21a796e-203e-f2cc-07f6-1c83a78a10fe@gmail.com>

Hola,

running into 2 notorious problems with the ORS Tools plugin:

1. QgsProcessingAlgorithm, where it doesn't return the features which 
were processed until the user presses Cancel. More elaborate on SE:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/328913/pyqgis-qgsprocessingalgorithm-no-output-layer-when-cancelled

2. Another, more subtle, behavior when someone uses the batch processing 
algorithms for ORS Tools plugin like so:

- save result as .shp or .gpkg instead of memory layer

- user exceeds our minutely query limit (usually 40 queries/minute), 
i.e. errors are printed, but internally NetworkAccessManager is just 
sleeping until the minute is over and the limit is lifted

- when all is done, the resulting layer is empty. However, when using 
memory layers instead, the results are available.

Thanks for any insight, running out of coffee soon..

Cheers
Nils

Then they've never seen the crash dialog - which would be good.  Otherwise it
has the instructions:

No, for some strange reason the bad layer handler would not get assigned 
when I tried within initGui.
I tried to find out why by looking at debug messages on qgis launch, 
reading the source code,
but it is a lot to take in with my rusty C skills so I have not found 
the answer.

But I reckoned it may be due to the plugin being loaded before a 
QgsProject singleton would be initialized.

Understood - if that part is not exposed to the python API then I will 
not pursue the above. Thanks for letting me know!

Thanks for your insight Nyall!
Sounds bad with that IT Department. :(

But yes, I think that would be helpful. (I wonder who else hit a wall 
with the broken paths? )
If there would be a way to fix broken paths in python on project init, I 
would use it now to improve on our plugin.

Although my problem (or rather, our problem with Raymond) is similar but 
not exactly the same:

We created a plugin that helps to achieve consistent map layouts: the 
plugin itself ships with the correct resources (logos, symbols, and a 
world map layer)
for specific map layouting tasks and has a simple workflow via dialogs 
that creates the right layouts which the users would fill in or adapt to 
meet their needs.

The problem is that since we ship the resources with the plugin, the 
resource paths are on the plugin path which is different across machines.
So when users create map layouts, save the project file and pass it to 
another user to work on they see missing items and broken layer path, 
even though they have the plugin installed.

On the longer term we believe it would be good to have a resource 
sharing system that is native to QGIS.
That would make it very easy to share resources for plugins as well, 
without needing to instruct the users to get the resource sharing 
plugin, connect to resource repo X and pull resources a, b, c,... and so on.

I had discussions about this with Raymond and we are looking to write a 
QEP about 'native' resource sharing.

We might as well be able to live without a solution for now, as native 
resource sharing would answer our needs best.

Best regards,
Aron

Hi Tim,
I agree, the current site gives clearly the impression that the are
officila representative for QGIS in Chile.
I think they should have a first sentence about the services they
provide for QGIS, making it clear they are a commercial company not
connected to QGIS.ORG.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Layer inserted into a layertree group using a
 processing post processor does not repaint on toggle
Message-ID: <PS1PR03MB36074E79A54985C6B351864EA1C40@PS1PR03MB3607.apcprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello devs,

I am using the QGIS postprocessing interface to add layers to a layer group. The layer group is created in processAlgorithm, while the indivdual layers are added from postprocessing classses.

The layer group gets created as expected along with the child layers. However toggling the individual layers does not repaint the canvas and has no effect. Toggling the entire group does work though.

The pseudocode is as follows:

def processAlgorithm(...):
    root = context.project().layerTreeRoot()
    group = root.insertGroup(0, "myGroup")

    self.postp = MyPostProcessor(group)

    layer = QgsVectorLayer(...)
    if layer and self.context.willLoadLayerOnCompletion(layer.id()):
       self.context.layerToLoadOnCompletionDetails(layer.id()).setPostProcessor(self.postp).

MyPostProcessor is used to basically move the layer to the group.

When the layer group is also created from within the postprocessing class, everthing works perfectly.

What am I doing wrong?

Regards,
Tej

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your info, please let us know when you start the crowdfunding
campaign to gather funds for advanced metadata support.

We have two clients interested in this feature and we will try to win
them as funders.

Ehhhh- right. The built-in handler is set AFTER plugins are loaded, so
it wipes out any custom handler implemented by a plugin! I think this
is a bug -- as it makes that API call rather useless. PR inbound.

Well, it's possible we could work around this by NOT deleting the
inbuilt one when a new one is set. But honestly, I think your use case
is better server by my proposed API addition.

I suspect lots of people. Personally, as a user, everytime I see that
dialog popup a little bit dies inside of me...

Nope - it IS the same ;) You can see it in

So what you would do here is implement a custom pre-processor which
detects some hardcoded path to the plugin resource, and swaps it out
with the actual path to the python plugin. E.g.

def my_processor(path):
   if path.endswith('my_plugins_super_north_arrow.svg'):
      return os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
'resources/my_plugins_super_north_arrow.svg')
   return path

QgsPathResolver.setPathPreprocessor(my_processor)

Basically - whenever a path ending in
'my_plugins_super_north_arrow.svg' is requested, it gets (silently)
modified to point to a subfolder off your plugin's actual runtime
location. You'd just need to make sure the intercepted resources have
a distinct enough name to not clash with other (non-plugin) paths!
(e.g. don't just check for "north_arrow.svg"!).

Here's where your problem lies. You're creating the group in the
processAlgorithm step, which is run in a background thread. Apart from
being at severe risk of crashes, this also has the side-effect of
making the new group "live" in the background thread. As soon as your
algorithm finishes and that thread exits, it will stop processing
events and things will go... murky... with your group.

Solution: don't do ANYTHING like this in a background thread, and do
all this logic in the post-processor (which runs in the main thread).

That's by design, intended to avoid users getting misleading partial

Sorry, no clues as to why this is the case...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bump to proj 6/gdal 3
Message-ID: <CAB28AshQRu9UsGBNOtjn4SSyf+QvjyA8imbOtxTScy8hyY+6rw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'd like to request that we update the Windows builds and macos
packages to use Proj 6.1 and GDAL 3.

I've previously requested a hold on these upgrades to give additional
time for testing and feedback. I now consider it an appropriate time
to upgrade, as:

1. We have a nearly a full month before the next round of patch
releases, so lots of time for testing
2. I've been keeping a very close eye on proj/gdal trackers, and have
not seen any significant unresolved issues which would affect our
users. Rather these releases have been very quiet with very little
issue reports (IMO, this is reflective of proj 6.1's stability).
3. We absolutely need to maximize the testing time before our next LTR release.

Arguments against upgrading would be:

- Projection handling is very low level, critical stuff. We can't
afford regressions here.

Arguments for upgrading would be:

- We have LOTS of unit tests covering this functionality, all of which
pass under the Proj 6.1/GDAL 3 builds.
- QGIS based on Proj < 6 gives misleading and inaccurate results in
some circumstances (e.g. working with data from Australia :P) and
honestly has very naive handling of transformations and projections in
general (no fault to QGIS here, it's super complex stuff and belonged
outside of the QGIS project. Fortunately we now have access to a
world-class projection/transformation library.)
- QGIS based on Proj < 6 has very poor UX in relation to datum
transformation handling and prompting users to make informed decisions
about these
- The LTR QGIS 3.4 release has been prepared for the Proj 6/GDAL 3
transition in a least-impact way, using the current deprecated proj 4
library calls. The transition should be invisible and painless for LTR
users.
- GDAL is super-critical to QGIS, and by sticking with older versions
we miss out on many important bug fixes and optimisations (not to
mention new driver features)

Discussion welcome :)

Hi,

Just my opinion and report from some users : these two shortcuts are
confused. Most users, until they know what is Grass, doesn't understand why
there is two icons ...
In Linux, there is only one shortcut and we could enable or disable grass
plugin so why two shortcut in Windows. I know Windows interface have
redundancy but why doing the same counter intuitive thing in Qgis shortcuts
?

Thanks Nyall!

That sounds exactly what would work for us. I guess we could use a very 
unique subdirectory name for storing all the not so unique files and 
find them that way.

For "normal" users this will be available from 3.10 right?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi Nyall,

I'm in favour of switching. The only issue I see is with LTR, where a
regression would be very bad. Probably better to put out experimental
packages and call for ad hoc testing before publishing an official point
release. For reference, in Debian Sid proj6 and gdal3 are still in
experimental.
Cheers.

And GDAL 3 is staying there at least until fiona supports it.

Hi all,
we also have interested customers, hopefully we'll be able to
contribute. I agree with the approach proposed by Gerald, which does not
seem very complicated. Perhaps an ad hoc funding for this will be
enough, without the need for a crowdfunding campaign?
Cheers.

7.6.1 builds successfully when you define 
ACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H.

7.6.0 fails due to the removal of nad2bin in PROJ 6.

OTB doesn't link to libproj. The otb Debian package has a patch for GDAL 
3.

See also the PROJ 6.0.0 [0], PROJ 6.1.1 [1] & GDAL 2.5.0 [2] threads on 
the Debian GIS list.

Yes, it's just there is more to it I think. I imagined a qgis with a 
resource sharing system where we would not have broken paths in the 
first place.
It was a comforting thought, so now the lack of it makes me see that as 
my 'real' problem.
Or maybe I am an idealist! :D

Now aside from my previous thought, this is of course great to have, it 
solves our problem.
Thanks for helping!

Aron

Message-ID: <1563881029008-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Where I work somebody decided to use sharepoint as our document handling
system - I will save you for my opinion on that!

But it means that typically my GIS layers are stored at places like:
\\files\Projects\11000382XX\1100038233\GIS\Layers\

And I se no way of getting to there in the QGIS browser window?

And as the "Change data source" for a layer is based on the browser I cannot
use this feature.

I can map the network drive but with many people working on the same data I
need to assure that they will map it the same way as the mapping will be
stored in the project file.

Currently the only way to do this is by adding a favorite for the
path. Creating a favorite allows you to manually enter a path.

You can add a favorite for that network path.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WMS Request "GetPrint" to QGIS - Server fails with
 &ATLAS_PK
Message-ID: <CAGcNaVLzR1Z3=1pSSPWWJkiu9_r9Oj4BwoqFj0RfA7VV=wZvTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs!

I'm a junior developer and I'm working on a project trying to refresh an old GISWEB, to do so i chose QWC2+QGISServer.

Actual setup is:

Debian 10, Apache2, QGIS-Server 3.8, using .shp as layers... the QWC2 works fine, WMS works fine, i can print some templates, print png, etc...

The issue is that I'm trying to use the &ATLAS_PK (implemented in QGIS Server 3.6<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/21e3adfbcac4ffa339b28a4fb5fefc3a704bd2fb> and I'm getting an annoying "Internal Server Error". When I use "&ATLAS_PK=1" or "&ATLAS_PK=1, 2, 3", log says:

"CRITICAL Server: An error occurred during the Atlas print
WARNING: finish() called twice"


As I read in the code here<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/server/services/wms/qgswmsrenderer.cpp> it could be caused by 2 things :

"if ( pkIndexes.size() < 1 )
    {
      throw QgsException( QStringLiteral( "An error occurred during the Atlas print" ) );
    }"


or:

"QString errorString;
    atlas->setFilterExpression( filterString, errorString );
    if ( !errorString.isEmpty() )
    {
      throw QgsException( QStringLiteral( "An error occurred during the Atlas print" ) );
    }"


I can't determine which one is causing it. (My shapes have FID field, so pkIndexes shouldn't be null)

If I try to use "&ATLAS_PK=*" it seems to work but I get "timed out" because I have like 4k features to print (I already changed the feature limit in QGIS Server conf). I'm going to try with a layer with less features as soon as I can and post updates.

GetProjectSettings WMS request returns that I have 2 templates both with atlas enabled.

There's not much documentation<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/services.html> to read about, as it's a new feature...

The issue has nothing to do with QWC2, it's just the QGIS-Server.

ISSUE URL: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/30817

Regards,

Zeus.

Ok. That's been merged and will be backported for 3.8.2. Additionally,
I've fixed one of your original issues in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30911 where we avoid plugin's bad
layer handlers being clobbered by the inbuilt one immediately after
the plugin load completes.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Crashing on startup on Fedora 29/KDE Plasma
Message-ID: <1884571.33K9Dohpts@hedgehog-hangout>

Hey all,

I am using Fedora 29 and KDE  5.14.5 with Linux kernel 5.1.18-200. I recently 
updated to the latest version of QGIS available pre-compiled in COPR (https://
copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dani/qgis/), 3.8 and cannot launch QGIS 
without the application crashing. I downgraded to 3.4 LTS and am experiencing 
the same behavior. I was able to run QGIS just a few days ago (not sure on the 
exact version then, though), and reboots haven't fixed it. Similar luck with 
full uninstall and reinstall. On running qgis, the stdout says:

KCrash: Application 'qgis' crashing...
KCrash: Attempting to start /usr/libexec/drkonqi from kdeinit
sock_file=/run/user/1000/kdeinit5__0
Warning: QSocketNotifier: Invalid socket 22 and type 'Read', disabling...

Not sure how I can go about fixing this, I would really appreciate some help. 
Maybe I should compile qgis myself and see how that goes?

Dylan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS-Kerning-Errors?
Message-ID: <094c64aa5eab4cdb8b202dd90fe2d1da@itc-halle.de>

Hello everybody,

ihen I use mass text with different markups (font attributes) over HTML text, kerning errors occur especially with small but necessary font sizes, i.e. the spacing becomes incorrect. The screenshot [1] should illustrate this. It is simple HTML (on the right). The errors occur equally in QGIS 2.14 and 3.2 and also 3.6. Does anyone have an idea or a workaround?  What other possibilities are there for mass text with different attributes?



Here is the test HTML:

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-weight: bold;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke</br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'><b>August-Hermann-Francke</b></br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'><strong>August-Hermann-Francke</strong></br></span>

<span style='font-size:7pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke<br></span>

<span style='font-size:14pt;font-weight: bold;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke</br></span>

<span style='font-size:14pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke<br></span>

<span style='font-size:24pt;font-weight: bold;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke</br></span>

<span style='font-size:24pt;font-family: "Arial",sans-serif'>August-Hermann-Francke<br></span>

Thanks, mikeE.

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ1Mo_Efk-ZG9WnHh5k9rngcFKB0EW0vn7YnWyiZ_bY7Ww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have configured a project with a WMTS service for an ortophoto. I'm using
QGIS Server 3.4.8 LTR

Two notes:

 - My layer is named "Ortophoto 2015" (with the space), but the WMTS
GetCapabilities replaces the space with _ (Ortophoto_2015), and in the
following GetTile, QGIS Server complains that if you use Ortophoto_2015 in
LAYER, it could not find it (LayerNotFound error), but if you use the space
it's working!

 - I am using EPSG:25832, but If I load the WMTS layer on QGIS Desktop 3.8,
it is always blank.

Any idea?

Message-ID: <CAB28AsimQQ-3yUeLFqNT5w+CW4CW=UzSV8F9oW8+4kvU=jOqvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey lists

This was first discussed back in 2016 (see
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Removal-of-labeling-search-methods-td5262743.html),
but would anyone object if the different labeling solution algorithms
eg "chain" / "pop music" / "falp" / etc were dropped, and we just
leave the existing default (chain)?

I don't think ANYONE knows what these mean, and it's a heck of a lot
of code (which needs fixes) to cart around for no compelling reason
that I can see.

I have no particular preference to any of the methods, so would
happily accept a different default if anyone out there can point to
which method is best!

Googling pop music / tabu / chain only gives a handful of results
relating to QGIS labeling engine. And googling for "falp" sounds like
something that would get you flagged on your company's firewall.

Does ANYONE understand or change this setting? Or would object to its
complete removal?

Widgetname that I need for editFormConfig.widgetConfig(widgetname)? Or is this the wrong way to do it?

Thanks in advance

Hi Jörg,

The easiest way is to set it up manually and inspect what the API returns.

'ValueRelation'
 >>> iface.activeLayer().editorWidgetSetup(1).config()

'countries.gpkg', 'NofColumns': 1, 'OrderByValue': False,

The crash reporter didn't work on my computer because of a missing URL 
or something.

But as far as crashes go, I had heaps of them one day in particular and 
then they stopped. On 3.4.9

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtER67tS8FKc2LBv99-bAW+oN8oe7ZZky1CNsHuuN3jjHw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 9th-week report for my GSoC Project[4]. You can also check the
project wiki page [2]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)


GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 9 Report

*Period*: 22 July 2019 - 29 July 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Fixed billboard size when changing the viewport.
   - Rendered the billboard (more) properly by discarding the transparent
pixel. It's not ideal, but it doesn't show a black area around the symbol
anymore.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421861/62011245-19e1da80-b176-11e9-8da4-df6f9bd6d004.jpg
   - Fixed the size of billboard shown (previously it's too small)
   - Filled 2nd phase evaluation
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Make the billboard shows symbol from user
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Currently, I am trying to use QgsSymbolButton, but it doesn't show up
when I ran QGIS. I did the usual workflow (promote a QToolButton to
QgsSymbolButton). I have checked that the object exists, but it's not shown
and no error message. See the empty area in the style panel next to the
`Billboard Symbol` label.
4. Code
   - Branch for billboard feature [1]
   - Repo for QT C++ billboard [3]
5. Misc
   - Currently in a block course (there is a class every day), so I had
less time to work on it this week and need to reschedule the weekly
meeting. It will finish this Thursday.
   - Thanks to Martin for helping me debug the rendering issue.

Hi Tim,

Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the late reply.

Thanks for the update! Maybe I missed it, but what is planned to eventually

The common usage is to put a label or sign of a place. Something like this
in Google map. In this case, the sign is better to have the same size and
always facing the same direction. When we zoom out, we can see where is the
place since the billboard will still have the same size. And when we rotate
or tilt the map, we can still see it properly also.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421861/62011693-eb66fe00-b17b-11e9-939d-d5cbb1955899.jpg

In my last week report, it's getting better, like the screenshot below.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421861/62011245-19e1da80-b176-11e9-8da4-df6f9bd6d004.jpg

Regarding a tooltip or a label text, I haven't thought about it. I am not
sure it's possible to do it even for a normal symbol. Using the identify
tool is one of the option to know what is it in the billboard.

Another good example of a billboard is this
https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=Billboards.html

I hope my explanation is quite clear.

Best Regards.

Hi

Thanks Sunni! I had a long chat with Martin this week and he basically told me: “Tim you are an idiot, 3D Billboards are not the same as real life billboards, they should always face the camera” :-)

So now I am convinced but still not sure what will actually be put in the billboard i.e. how will I configure its contents based on some data from my layer?

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Odd - what you have looks ok to me. Does it work if you try copying a
symbol button from elsewhere in QGIS (e.g. say the point displacement
renderer ui file) and paste it into the 3d widget in designer?

Label placement took a lot of time and efforts in the past and this is the
outcome.
It's true, there is no real need for it while on screen, but it could be
very useful in Layout. The problem is similar to generalisation, you need
proper data to support label placement. Losing the relationship with real
geographic objects, when exporting the layout in SVG or postscript, label
placement takes time and needs cartographic expertise while changing the
algorithm in Layout mode can help a lot.
Keeping several algorithms in Layout could ease code maintenance while
keeping all the advantages.
On the other hand, this needs some efforts on documentation and Anita's
touch is really welcome here. Algorithms need reference but also a plain
explanation in something that resembles a book. Someone developed a
publishing business out of a GIS program... maybe this is too much and has
already been done, but...
My two eurocents.

So - just to confirm -- you are actively changing that setting, and
seeing useful results from different methods? If so, which do you use?
Which give the best results? What's the trade off between them?

As stated in the earlier email, I would not mind if we remove those.
Are you thinking about removing the option in GUI or to get rid of the
code in PAL for other methods too?

To shed some light on the methods for those interested... a good
starting point is PAL docs [1] with links to papers, unfortunately
most links there are broken, but this paper is a good start:
Laurent et al: From Point Feature Label Placement to Map Labelling (2009)

The paper is available here [2] and gives an overview of the whole
process of labeling with PAL. Generally the idea is to turn labeling
into a general combinatoric problem and then apply some heuristic. The
paper also covers the various optimization techniques. FALP seems to
be the most basic initial solution. "Tabu" seems to be a
meta-heuristic method from 1980's [3], "chain" stands for "ejection
chains" concept somehow related to Tabu search. And finally Popmusic
is a search method co-authored from one of the authors of PAL.

I remember there was a paper with quite extensive testing of the
methods, but can't find it anymore. From what I remember, one would
higher amount of labeled features with a slower method (e.g. Popmusic)
or fewer labels with a faster method. If we decide to stick with a
single method, it may be interesting to get the opinion of original
PAL authors on what method to choose... I don't know enough about
those methods to decide.

Cheers
Martin

Yes, if you consider trial and error a mindful method, I "use" label
placement algorithms when preparing a cartographic layout for printing.
I mainly work on geographic data and web output, so it's not frequent and I
follow the easy and dumb way: I swap algorithms, hoping for a result that
solves cluttering in the worst spots, until it fits – usually it fits here
and it's out of order elsewhere...
I generally criticise this approach, but when looking for a good
appearance, it seems bearable. Yes, I would need some more information to
do a better work. As already said, I think this is a cartographic issue
that can get more benefits by a better GIS approach. Label positioning is
not "substantial" but can exploit proper data. Say population for a
populated place. Using these algorithms on top of geometric-only data gives
little more than casual results.
I had the opportunity to weight the theory behind these methods starting
from the obituary of Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum by Maurizio Codogno on
ilPost.it that referenced the New York Times:
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/mitchell-feigenbaum-dead.html.
Looking to further developments, I think there is not a "best" algorithm,
but that it's useful to keep alternatives. I doubt the algorithms could
really work well without an interface that can reach useful data, but I
also think that keeping them available without any special interface could
keep them in a place that is not really influenced by the frequent
enhancements of QGIS.

Woah, I follow your suggestion, it works. Thanks. I am still not sure why
though :)

Hi Tim,

Ahaha, yes, it's different. I thought the same thing when I heard it for
the first time :D

 So now I am convinced but still not sure what will actually be put in the

Well, if you want to configure it from the data, it should be possible (or
I should make it possible) to do it from the symbol. Since we can use an
expression to configure the symbol, it's mean we can also configure the
billboard also.

Hopefully, I can show how to do it in this week.

Best regards.

Message-ID: <44c3ec4a-a4f0-23ef-a22b-5d4d72ecb4f4@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm facing something really weird using r.series. The tool, beside the
open ticket [0] is working nice.

What is really really weird is that while with the UI I can generate the
aggregated raster, when I copy and paste in the python console within
QGIS the exact same command (with output saved in a folder), I get no
error but at the same time no output.

Other GRASS tools (e.g. r.info) seem working fine.

If someone wants to test, you can use the raster attached in the ticket:
just be careful to change the Max parameter in the Advanced Parameter to
e.g. 10000.

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,

I use to look at the tinyurl link provided in Travis builds to find
differences in test control images.

But on recent builds (https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/564996917),
the URL gives a blank page.

When trying to browse from
https://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS I cannot find my
build.

Did I miss something ? Anyone knows what's happening ?

Thanks !

It was moved (by the orfeo team) to
https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

And something broke when they upgraded it a while ago, preventing the
use of direct links to specific results (which is why the Travis links
don't work anymore).

I had to read the URL multiple times to catch the difference: dash =>

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to select a small region of a QGIS raster
 image and calculate basic stats
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqmubwD8c=wgLeHg73Sm1F0cmS6X15fbC-7KwAjLA4u1g@mail.gmail.com>

I find that I need to be able to select a small area of a raster image in
QGIS and have it calculate basic stats such as max, min, average, and
median. I cannot seem to find any function to do this or a plugin to do it.
Am I missing the functionality somewhere? I would need to do this hundreds
of times as I examine peaks in magnetometry data to help classify the
features. Those values would then be added to a table of features.

If this is not an available feature does anyone know how to quickly
implement it? I haven't written any raster plugins yet. All my others are
vector related.

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Some thought on LTR
Message-ID: <b5cd4a35-ef98-64e0-35ec-5f2930ee0495@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I just discovered a serious bug in LTR on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine (on
16.04 QGIS 3.4 is the most updated version an user can have). Same issue
as listed here [0].

Besides on this specific issue, I think recent 3.4 LTR suffered from
some big regressions ([1], [2]...): some of them have been fortunately
solved, but still....

I'm not writing this email because I have a proposal, I'm just curious
if someone else feels the same: of course it is normal to have bug (and
regressions) but I really think we should think to enhance a little bit
more the LTR...

Cheers and thanks for feedback

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Inconsistency between the behaviors of "Identify
 Features" and "Select Features"
Message-ID: <CADQ4pmBHP4uusKLrNUWTW57LHw0hcMXXTFZN5ku_gmWp13cKcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I have a question about an inconsistency between the tool "Select
Features by area or single click" and the tool "Identify Features", that
happens in case you have in the same layer multiple point features
overlapping at the same coordinates.
When you use "Identify Features", and click on a point, you will find in
"Identify Results" information about all the features at that site.
Using "Select Features by area or single click", you have different
behaviors depending on how you make the selection: if you draw with the
mouse a square that includes the coordinates of your overlapping points,
all those points are selected; if you just click on the point (you see only
one, because they are overlapping), just one of those points is selected,
and there is no obvious criterion to know in advance which of them will be
selected. IMHO, this looks a bit counter-intuitive.
In my case, I made a little workaround in pyqt, adding to my plugin a
checkbox to let the users choose if they want to automatically select all
the features that are at the same coordinates of the clicked one (it
leverages the signal QgsVectorLayer.selectionChanged and uses
QgsVectorLayer.selectByExpression to modify the selection on-the-fly if
needed).
I am curious, anyway, if this behavior of the feature selector is expected
and if it was made on purpose.
Thank you in advance,
Paolo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [Info][Howto] Python Processing script to create
	an output without input
Message-ID: <CAM+zXj3YKNiceYRZMfA5ZJp6W4OEUHR-eCsvoEK-cfTEyFX_pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs
I'm trying to do a Python Script in Processing without an input layer and
generate an output layer based on a number of fields that respects an
order, name, type of field, precision.

The problem: I have some standard procedures that use a template shapefile.
Most of the time users create a new template or truncate existing layers.

To save some clicks what I'm trying to do is create instantly the templates
without user lose time. I'm using processing to get the advantage of batch
mode.

This is my actual code but crashes when I run (see .py in attach)

I think the problem is in the moment of writing the output file.

Kind regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PostgreSQL execute and load SQL in Processing
	Modeler
Message-ID: <CAMCJChs2hxemFcv4zMPHu-ewifQ+qtWXB0VEn2D1PW9FjjcixQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm developing a Processing Model and I want to run an algorithm (Union) on
a specific PostGIS layer. The idea is to have this input layer hardcoded to
the Union algorithm.

If this layer is stored in a system file (SHP, or any other vector layer
format), it is simple, just pointing Union input field to that file. But as
it is stored in PostgreSQL, I thought to use "PostgreSQL execute and load
SQL" algorithm to call the layer and use it in Model, as input to Union.

In fact this works well, but when running the Model, the PostGIS layer is
loaded to QGIS canvas.

I think this is happening because "PostgreSQL execute and load SQL" won’t
create any new layer, and load the PostGIS layer itself, as a result of the
query, just like it's explained in the docs:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/database.html#postgresql-execute-and-load-sql

So, anyone have any hint to call a PostGIS layer and use it as hardcoded
input to a Model algorithm, without python coding?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Is there an example on how to retrieve data from a rest service using PKI
authentication in a processing script where the rest service is returning a
vector feature in GeoJson format? I see examples for WFS and WMS services
using QgsDataSourceUri(), but that does not seem to work for rest services.

Hi Harrissou,

"PostgreSQL execute SQL" can not be input to another algorithm in
Processing Modeler, because it has no output. It is only used to execute
SQL directly in the database.

"PostgreSQL execute and load SQL" do the same, but load the result of the
SQL query in QGIS, and this one already has the possibility to be used as
input in another Modeler algorithm. The problem is just that it is loaded
to QGIS, and my goal is to hardcode a PostGIS layer input to a Modeler
algorithm. This is really easy with system based files, but I can't find an
easy solution to PostGIS layers.

Thanks anyway Harrissou!

Best regards,
Pedro

Ouch - never, EVER use "iface" in Processing scripts!

The problem is in the line:

layer = iface.addVectorLayer(self.OUTPUT, 'layer1', 'ogr')

You should remove this line, and replace the return dict with the path
to your created layer, e.g.:

return {self.OUTPUT: '/home/me/my.shp'}

Processing will automatically load this as a layer when required.

Is your link to [0] incorrect? It's the same as [1], which was
resolved very quickly after identification...

...and honestly, I don't think [1] was a huge regression. It resulted
from a fix for GRASS handling on Windows with non-ascii paths, and
only affected Ubuntu 16.04 users. The number of users affected by the
original issue would be much, MUCH greater than the number of Ubuntu
16.04 users of GRASS algorithms. And a fix was pushed almost
immediately after the bug was reported, so to me this one is just bad
luck, and not symptomatic of problems in our development processes.
(The only "fix" I could see as possible here would be to add Ubuntu
16.04 as a platform on which our CI tests are run, but to do that we'd
need to pay and upgrade from the free Travis account we currently use
and get access to unlimited parallel builds. We're already struggling
with the limitations in parallel builds on the free account with just
one build target).

> [2]

I don't see any evidence that [2] is a regression and not a feature
request, as I'm of the impression this has never been supported by the
inbuilt browser. In fact, it's only recently that QGIS browser backend
would be able to support this kind of mixed-provider structure (i.e.
postgis provider node which shows layers which must be loaded via
gdal), (and I'm only 50-50 that it would be possible currently without
further API work).

Sounds like a good goal though, and would be a great followup to
Alessandro's upcoming dbmanager -> browser work. I'm personally of the
impression that Postgis raster's have never been a first class citizen
in QGIS, and have only ever worked
kind-of-sort-of-if-you-hold-your-breathe-right. It would be great to
see this remedied and them become fully supported via browser and the
data source manager, and covered by unit tests so that we CAN safely
rely on accessing them in QGIS.

I'm not saying that we DON'T have some bad regressions which slip in
occasionally to the LTR (the recent db manager regression discussion
comes to mind), but I honestly don't think there's a bigger problem
here. Everything listed here (GRASS provider, PostGIS rasters, db
manager edge cases) have always had a shaky past in QGIS, and
regressions to them are (and ALWAYS have been) common. So I don't
think the issue lies in the LTR or the handling of it, rather the
issue lies in the code and lack of stability in these parts of QGIS.
(Mathieu - might be time for your thread on one of these points...
hint hint!)

Hmm - you're 100%. There's a gap here which can't be solved in current
Processing framework.

There's two approaches which could be taken here:
1. Add a flag to QgsProcessingContext reflecting whether the algorithm
is being run as part of a larger model. In the
PostGISExecuteAndLoadSQL.py script, check for this flag and if it's
present then skip the "addLayerToLoadOnCompletion" step.

or

2. (better, more complicated, but of value EVERYWHERE in processing)
Allow postgres layer sources to be used directly as input values for
vector layer parameters.

I'm happy to mentor the changes if you want to give a PR as shot, or
email me privately if you'd prefer to directly sponsor either
approach.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] On github, gitlab,

Hi list,

Well, I've got to say upfront that we WERE warned about the dangers of
this happening by members of our community, and now the worst IS
happening and Github has started blocking access to projects from
certain regions.

See https://www.linuxinsider.com/story/86154.html, but long story
short, GitHub is now blocking users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea
and Syria from accessing its services to comply with U.S. trade
control laws. I'm unsure if we're directly affected yet by this, but
the wording on Github's notice is very vague: " GitHub MAY allow users
in or ordinarily resident in countries and territories subject to U.S.
sanctions to access CERTAIN free GitHub.com services for PERSONAL
COMMUNICATIONS " (emphasis added by me).

What can/should we do in response to this?

Note that it ALSO applies to gitlab.com, who are also subject to the
same trade laws, so moving to gitlab ISN'T a possible solution (unless
we self-host).

I think at the least we could/should endorse an official, read-only
repo mirror which isn't affected by the trade laws, e.g.
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/qgis/QGIS would be a great candidate
(unless osgeo is also affected by the same ruling, which they could
easily be, given that they are US based too) . An official mirror
would at least ensure that users in these regions can access the
existing source.

Does this development concern anyone else?

Hey Nyall,

>From my understanding, it is only private repos (which we have none) and
nothing open source and the public which means it really shouldn't affect
us in any way.

Providing a mirror isn't a bad thing anyway, but I don't think this move
affects us really here.  A lot of places have networks blocking access to
stuff like GitHub anyway so might not be bad to have a mirror to help those
people.
