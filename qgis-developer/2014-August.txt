Hi everyone,



*Weekly Report 10*

*What was done this week?*

   - Added the checking mechanism to handle the inaccuracies which were
   encountered earlier

*. *
   - Cleaned the code for better understanding.


*What is the plan for next week?*

   - To update the code to the plug-in. As of now it is in scripts.

   - Discuss with the mentors and try to move forward to other constraint
   implementation.

Hi all,

a dialog for 'saving vector layer as' offers possibility to store also
symbology (feature/symbol layer). I haven't find any output format for
which this functionality would work (simple point layer with
categorized symbols). Does it suppose to work and for which formats?

Thanks for clarification, Martin

I think it works for spatialite and expect it will work for geopackage
when that becomes available.

Does it work for KML that would be the other logical layer type that
might include styling.

Thanks,

btw, when exporting point layer to spatialite it fails with messages

Export to vector file failed.

Sorry for the late reply

If you have your help already in a html file, you have to overwrite the
help() method in the GeoAlgorithm class, so it returns the path to your
file instead of trying to find the rst file and parsing it to get an html
string.

The GrassAlgorithm class does this to reuse the GRASS help files, so you
can have a look at it to see how it is done.

Let me know if you have questions

Cheers

Hi all.
I think we should unify this, as we have one method for saving styles for PostGIS and
SpatiaLite layers (from layer properties) and one from the Save as... dialog.
All the best.

IFAW, the current ability to export styles to OGR is limited in QGIS
only to pen's colors and width [1], right?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do a correct GetFeatureInfo request
Message-ID: <CABqTJk_cZmYw0LMCXqXt_qyQDF9-F2JigjzSBzHsfpFJRC6Wow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I send this message originally to user list, but perhaps is better to
send to this list.
And meanwhile I update with the last news.
----

We are having some troubles with qgis-server when send a GetFeatureInfo from our
framework webgis (Tolomeo webgis framework).

QGIS-Server is returning a
"Service not specified. The SERVICE parameter is mandatory"
error.

After some test, we perhaps find the issue:

So understand better so I need to hve an information on qgis-server.

When do a POST GetFeatureInfo request,

the parameter SERVICE should be set on the querystring or in a post parameter ?
;)

Infact seem the issue is that the SERVICE parameter is effectively
present but perhaps is not where qgis-server would have it .

Our framework is usually working with mapserver and geoserver and its
settings for parameter GetFeatureInfo work surely with them both.

Now we try to understand where the SERVICE paramete is wanted by
qgis-server when the client do a post request.

Any hint is welcome.

Thx,

-----

After this message , we have do some other test.
The results are that effectively seem the QGIS-Server need to have all
the aprameters in POST section and seem to ignore every paameter put
in the querystring.
Our framewor is using the post only to pass the huges coordinates of a
polyon when the user start to edit it. Instead usually send the
usually parameters in the querystring section.

However after this experience with qgis-server, because this is
effectively a no more clear section of HTTP specs.
We start to change the work of out framework to repeat the same
parameter in the query string also in the POST parameters.

Hope this resolve the issue.

An update: running the command on a sample of features (only the duplicates) works,
but on the whole layer it does not.
Fortunately the native QGIS command Delete duplicate geometries does its work well.
All the best.

Hi,

For me it is very strange that

x(centroid($geometry))
y(centroid($geometry))

does not work in the QGIS expressions.

There is a $x and $y - but this does only work directly on a current
feature if it is a point feature.

The workaround with xmin/ymin

xmin(centroid($geometry))
ymin(centroid($geometry))

works, but seems cumbersome.

Could you open a ticket please?

Andreas

Hi,

Is possible to customize the html response of qgis-server to a

Our goal is to put a logo and a Title in the body of every response.

I know an option is to change the code, but before start to do this I
like to know surely if this is not available.

on Ubuntu 14.04 it works without issues (and no need for any

Hi, we discovered that this could be a QGIS server bug.

If you set the layer visibilty by scale (i.e. I want a layer to be
visible from 1:2.500 to below) and you do a WMS search on that layer,
the result is ALWAYS empty!

I'm going to make a ticket...

We have investigated futher: If you set the maximum scale 1:1, qgis
wms server returns empty resutl. If it is set to 1:0, it works.

	GetFeatureInfo response
Message-ID: <CABqTJk8TmizoSWFVS=ZN-DKKKRbmfdFoXMvJt9W0QSoXzWwfFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When do a GetFeatureInfo request, I see, the qgis-server (v 2.4) will
response using as Layer Title the same value that isput in the
layername value of the tree of QGIS desktop.

It is also the "name" used for the layer in the list of getcapabilities.

I guess it is not the best choice.
Infact the name of the layer in getcapabilites need to be sintetic and short.

MOre better is it used the Title field.

The Title Field value come from the Matadata -> Title.

I guess the response of the GetFeatureInfo as Layer Value will use the
metadata->Title instead of the "name" that is too sintetic.

Any thought ?

Thx,

Hi QGis developers.

I was considering hacking a bit on qgis...

I cloned it from github and building (on Kubuntu 14.04) the master branch.

when running `make test` I get
44% tests passed, 54 tests failed out of 97

Is this expected?

Further, when I launch qgis and exits without doing anything, it
crashes with SEGFAULT.

Hi!

Thanks for reminding me to use make test on master from time to time ..
currently:

82% tests passed, 17 tests failed out of 97

(building on 64 Bit Linux Mint Debian Edition)

I do not wonder that some tests fail in master, and I also know that I
never was at 100% but 54 tests fail is a bit too much.Exit here is
without SEGFAULT ..

I guess there is something wrong/missing on your system.

without any further information (I am also running and compiling it on
Ubuntu 14.04 - no info about Kubuntu) it is a bit hard to tell anything.

Is Kubuntu 14.04 probably using Qt5 already?

kind regards
Werner

Hi all

I post this question in the developer mailing list, since I did not get
any answer in the user mailing list.

This is the behavior in the application after upgrading:

I realized after the upgrade from Valmeira to version Chugiak in my QGIS
project all fields that before were not editable now are editable. Does
someone else have the same problem?

kind regards

Oggetto: [OSGeo-Discuss] FOSDEM 2015: proposal for a geospatial devroom
Data: Wed, 6 Aug 2014 09:11:20 +0200
Mittente: Johan Van de Wauw <johan.vandewauw at gmail.com>
A: OSGeo Discussions <discuss at lists.osgeo.org>, talk at openstreetmap.org,
location-iwg at locationtech.org

Hello everyone,

FOSDEM[1] is a free open source event bringing together about 5000
developers together in Brussels, Belgium. The goal is to provide open
source software developers and communities a place to meet to. The
next edition will take place the weekend 31/1 -> 1/2/2015.

Last edition (in february this year) both Osgeo and Openstreetmap had
a stand and there was a lot of interest in geospatial technologies.

That is why the idea was coined to organise a geospatial devroom the
next edition.

Since the call for participation for developer rooms and main tracks
is now open [2], I would like to start writing a proposal [3], so
hopefully we can have a geospatial devroom next year.

Rather than organising the devroom organised by one project FOSDEM
really prefers joint organisation "Proposals involving collaboration
across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged." That's
why I'm sending this mail to Osgeo, OSM and locationtech.

If you would like organising the devroom (writing the proposal and
selecting the presentations) and will be present, please get in touch
or add your name to my current draft proposal [3].

Note that one can also propose main track presentations. For main
track speakers travel expenses and accommodation will be covered by
the organisation. This is not the case for the devroom.

Finally a reminder that we are only sending a proposal for a devroom
-> We are not sure it will be accepted. Competition will be fierce.

Cheers,
Johan

Kubuntu is just Ubuntu with another default package selection (KDE
instead of Gnome/Unity), so consider it as Ubuntu.

> Is Kubuntu 14.04 probably using Qt5 already?

No, I am compiling against Qt 4.8.5 (the latest Ubuntu package)

The test results are:
44% tests passed, 54 tests failed out of 97

Now that you are compiling and building on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit, Could
you send me your CMakeCache.txt from that system? So that I can
investigate the build configuration difference.

Thanks Giovanni. I tried again on 2.4 and a clean --configpath, and I get the same error.
Problems also with saga: I had to enable 2.1, but then I get the error:

The nightly builds also run the tests:

Not the exact numbers - but that there are failing tests is no news.

reconfiguring with
cmake ..

and then building.

Ending up with a build with much fewer errors and no SEGFAULT:
78% tests passed, 21 tests failed out of 97

However to make cmake .. pass I had to apply a patch, I'll make a pull-request.

What I believe has happend:
I have sometime during the spring configured and built qgis, then
forgot about it some time, then upgrade some packages (probably
libpython), then rebuilt qgis from updated master (even doing cmake,
make clean, make), but then somehow the build has been invalid
resulting in SEGFAULT

Anyway thanks for all your attention.

Hi Markus,

Are you able to switch them back to non-editable? Somebody reported
issues that he is not able to turn editing off [1].

If you open your old files with the current development version, does
the same happen? IIRC jef made some changes that could have fixed this.

Best regards,
Matthias

Hi,

I do some tries, but I'm not able to reach the value in
Metadata->Title section almost in qgis-server GetFeatureInfo response
section of code.

So I prefer to try to change the names of layers putting in it spaces
and any needed special char.

Sorry for noise,

Message-ID: <CABqTJk_3HHN5y437VUx9pndMgA+h=PP6iQRUzWmpafo1kDqjow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is QGIS-server supporting a wms group with the same name of the layer
it contains.

And
QGIS Server support the situation where more than one layer could have
the same "name" ?


I have some trouble, but perhaps I have wrong something.
So before start to do search in proof, I liketo know if this kind of
configuration is supported.

Thx,

	getfeatureinfo response.
Message-ID: <CABqTJk_iTNeSo3CDUWs-FkDsKfckNV8KTa_p0bPGWvKLOxSQNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I notice on some response text/html to a GetFeatureInfo,
on some layer qgis-server add an hardcoded field named "maptip".

Also I notice it is not always added but nly on some layer.

I found the code in the
qgswmsserver.cpp

....
      //add maptip attribute based on html/expression (in case there
is no maptip attribute)
      if ( layer->fieldNameIndex( layer->displayField() ) < 0 )
      {
        QString displayField = layer->displayField();
        if ( !displayField.isEmpty() )
        {
          QDomElement maptipElem = infoDocument.createElement( "Attribute" );
          maptipElem.setAttribute( "name", "maptip" );
          maptipElem.setAttribute( "value",
QgsExpression::replaceExpressionText( displayField, &feature, layer )
);
          featureElement.appendChild( maptipElem );
        }
      }

....

Why this adding hardcoded ?

I guess it could be a refuse of something other old code ? And so removable ?

Actually this is quite fastidiosus (embarassing) for us, because it is
a not corresponding fied to the real structure of the layer.

Thx,

Message-ID: <CABqTJk-Gp_DNe0W2VAq0m-B2kBfTQezib8EoJ8=YqTaf4Oc_5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I just pull a request for a patch that allow the configurability of
the GetFeatureInfo response using a css external file.

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11029

Please let me know if the patch is affordable for adding to qgis core.

I try to avoid change anything to break the compatibility with all
possibles use.
The change are only to allow the setting the configuring element using a CSS.

The only necessary change is to substitute a </BR> with a <HR class=..> tag.
But using the same css is possible to hide the line of the <hr> tag
and aso change its height.
So also with this patch inside managing the css file is possible to
have the same response ol-style of qgis-server.

Regards,

Hi,

If you are feeling adventurous, you can try a new methodology for setting
up a development environment on Mac [0]. It utilizes the Homebrew package
manager, and requires no manual compiling, and many pre-compiled binaries
(if everything goes smoothly).

Please post any issues to the tap's tracker [1].

The qwtpolar formula has just recently been pushed to the main Homebrew tap
[0], and subsequently dropped from the osgeo4mac tap. This means you have
to update your Homebrew setup, which you should generally do before any use
of Homebrew. In other words, you added the tap (missing qwtpolar now), but
did not also update your older local Homebrew copy (upstream repository now
has qwtpolar).

Try running:

  brew update

And, if that doesn't fix it, try to specifically clean up your tap(s):

  brew tap --repair

If your HOMEBREW_PREFIX is /usr/local (which is the default) and you are
using Mavericks, then you will be able to install qgis-24 (with no options)
from a 'bottle', i.e. a pre-built binary, which I uploaded today [1]. Then,
you can install the extra dependencies for the Processing plugin:

brew install qgis-24 --only-dependencies

# optionally install QGIS 24
brew install qgis-24

# if you need these for functionality in Processing plugin
brew install grass-70
brew install saga-gis
brew install orfeo-40
brew install taudem
brew install r

Note the 'caveats,' after installing qgis-24, about installing run-time
Python dependencies. Everything but the R package has a bottle now for
Mavericks, to make install faster.

If you are setting up a development environment, remember to do 'brew
unlink qgis-24' if you have installed it.

Hi Alexandre,

this is possible, moreover some Processing parts already has i18n support.
But some parts still lacking it, this is in our TODO list.

Thanks for the answer. I will try to make it work in "my" model then.

> But some parts still lacking it, this is in our TODO list.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that sounds like a repetitive "simple" task.
Maybe I could help you with that.

Is it done in python or C++?

Hi,

This mailing list for QGIS-related development. Questions about issues of
compiling other software should be directed to their appropriate support
channels, like the PyQt mailing list [0].

If you are looking to set up a development environment on Windows for QGIS,
consider using the OSGeo4W installer and building QGIS upon its supporting
libraries, instead of compiling all the dependencies yourself. See the
INSTALL document for info on this [1].

Message-ID: <CAECJsSo_dYKGg05-vowiUiShjfn_rOzSXHNZw5TVVgqteEGZ0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A couple of hours I'm trying without success to do something so I ask for
your help.
I would like to export as PDF (in a single file) an atlas composition
within Python Console.
I don't find how to do.
All I obtain is either multiple PDF files corresponding to each iterated
feature of the coverage layer or a single feature corresponding to the last
iterated feature.
Where should I look at, please?
And more generally, where can I find the code used by a tool such as
"Export Atlas to PDF file" in the composer GUI (atlas menu)?

Thanks for your help and advices...

Dear all,	I'm a new developer of QGIS using C++. I am doing a project which needs dynamically displaying maps/layers(just like GPS,layers automatically refreshing with the changing of object's position).I kown ARCGIS has the technique called dynamic diasplay(or something like that),which supports the capacity to do such things. Is QGIS has this ability? Any advices would be appreciated!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Broken models with processing (i.e we shouldn't be
	doing that)
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-pSX0=HqaP=BX-OKeSropaW6qfqnPo+R2xiHmH==36yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have noticed that old models don't work in the new processing modeler.
This is really, really bad. Breaking a format is just as bad, or even
worse, as breaking a API. Users don't care (much) for APIs but they care
about formats and when they stop working people get annoyed.

Processing is a core plugin and therefore people consider it part of QGIS,
changes in it effect us as a whole product.  If I break one of my plugins
that hurts me, if I change a core format (e.g qgs, qlr) that hurts the
whole QGIS project.

I can understand the need to move forward to something better, and the new
JSON format is much better then a custom format I will never argue for the
later. However not providing a way to import old models, or even doing it
by auto magic, is really bad.

Some people invest a lot of time into creating models for processing and
having it break under them with no option but to recreate will leave a bad
taste with people, trust me on that.   As processing has been "core" since
2.0 you can expect a lot of models in the wild and a lot of annoyed people
if there is no option to upgrade.

What I am NOT proposing is to revert that work, we do need to move forward
but I do think there needs to be a conversion function/s.

However if it comes close to release and there is no conversion ability
then I would say we should revert the plugin in core and wait for the next
release to upgrade the models.  Breaking the models on people with no
convert option will have much more effect then not having some of the new
features.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Bob,
QGIS can definitely do this already.
I used this feature in November last year - but make sure you use the 
latest versions of QGIS of all the plugins for field editing because at 
that stage some of the (digitising, I think) plugins caused serious 
loops when refreshing the screen or adding a feature, so not great if 
you are dynamically panning.

I used a Garmin 60CSX, but any gps that can output an NMEA stream should 
work.
You also need the free versions of Franson GPSGate from http://gpsgate.com/

On a practical note, I found dynamic panning not very useful for my 
purpose. When we drove passed a POI, we couldn't easily pause the 
panning in order to drop a points and add the attributes needed. We 
found the dynamic tracking (digitising) of the incoming GPS track very 
useful, and we manually panned the display as needed, whilst in motion.

HTH,
Zoltan

Turning the editing off is possible on fields. So this issue I can not 
confirm.

In that case, QGIS is upgrading the project to the Chugiak version and 
the problem I specified in the previous mail occurs.

Hi Zoltan,	Thanks a lot for your reply!	The version i'm using is QGIS 2.4.0. I want to develop a desktop application using QGIS API, by C++ as i said. It is not GPS, but the way it is displayed like GPS-dynamic displaying by the changing data. So i built QGIS using source code according to INSTALL. At the time of Cmake, I unchecked the Python related plugins(such as WITH_BINDINGS,WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS), hope this does not affact the function you mentioned.	Do you know which function or class is the one i'm looking for? I developed a simple demo that has these features: add layer, zoom in/out, pan. When i added a vector layer(.shp), i zoom in or zoom out, the refresh is not smooth or continuous. Are there any places i did not do right? Looking forward to your reply.
RegardsBob

Well, relatively simple. In some files all you need is to wrap all
visible strings
in self.tr() call. But for other classes additional coding is required.

Of course help and patches are welcome.

> Is it done in python or C++?

Processing written in Python.

Hey Nathan

I agree with you, and I have been wanting to do this...but it requires some
work, since not only the format has changed, but also the inner structure
of the models. Unfortunately, I am not having too much time to work on
Processing lately, but I guess it will be ready for the next release. I
would be a pity to ship QGIS with the older version, since this new one has
plenty of improvements and good new things

Thanks for the advice!

I haven't been following the whole thing but while maintaining the API 
can be a pain, I think it's a strcit requirement.

I totally agree with this too. Given that processing is treated as
part of core, the api should be frozen for the 2.0 series (as painful
as that is becoming now!). I've seen stacks of answers to
gis.stackexchange questions where processing api is used - it would be
a real shame to break all of these.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapLayerAction and QgsAttributeAction
Message-ID: <53E8E056.3020702@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I am currently working on a better integration of actions into the
attribute dialog and the feature list on the attribute table in the form
view.

While working on this, I stumbled upon the class QgsMapLayerAction which
I am having a hard time to understand the purpose of.

Some comments in qgsdualview.cpp suggest that it is related to user
defined actions vs standard actions [1]. I wondered also if it is
related to vector layer vs raster layer (as QgsMapLayer is a common base
class of the two and QgsMapLayerAction therefore might be interpreted as
"also valid for raster layers").

What I am currently building is a gui component QgsAttributeActionMenu
that will generate a QMenu based on a layer and feature (and an optional
attribute index) that can be shown as context menu (map canvas,
attribute table, feature list) or in a menu bar of the attribute dialog.
It would be nice that this class can encapsulate any logic to fetch
possible actions from different sources (some flags could be used to
enable/disable certain actions based on the context such as "open
feature form" which doesn't make sense if it's shown in a feature form
(attribute dialog) window's menubar).

I am happy about any hint I get on this,
Best regards,
Matthias

Unfortunately this code isn't currently exposed to the python
bindings, so can't be accessed via the console. The c++ code you are
looking for is in QgsComposer::exportCompositionAsPDF - at the moment
you'd need to reimplement this yourself in python. It's far from
ideal, and is on my list of things to fix, but I haven't found the
time to tackle this yet.

I can help you out here - QgsMapLayerActions are built-in c++ actions,
or actions which are defined by a python plugin. Unlike the standard
vector layer actions, these are not editable by users, and are not
listed in the vector layer properties dialog. As far as I'm aware,
there's only a single implementation currently in QGIS:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp#L3566
This action allows users to jump directly to a specific atlas feature,
and is only shown for vector layers which are set as the coverage
layer for a composition.

There's also some useful sample python code on how these actions can
be used here:

Thank you for the explanation.

I also figured out, that they can be layer independent in contrast to
the attribute actions which are always defined for a specific layer.

As I am working on a menu, I am more interested in listing/triggering
the action than creating a new one (like the one in your link).

>From this point (usage/triggering) there is not much difference as far
as I can tell. So I think that it would be good to be able to query them
in one particular place. Therefore I wondered, what you think about also
exposing the attribute actions (custom) in the MapLayerActionRegistry?
I also have noticed, that the MapLayerActions are a subclass of the type
QAction, but I don't think they can be used like that (I did not test,
so please correct me if I am wrong. I just noticed that the trigger
method is not connected, so if you add them to a menu there is not much
happening I think). If this is true, I think it would not be nice to get
a fully functional QAction similar to QgsAttributeTableMapLayerAction,
that adds exactly this functionality around QgsMapLayerAction.
Then there is only one small bit left - as far as I can tell - that is
different between the two action types, which is that the custom actions
support a type of "parameter" by substitution which allows to run them
for a certain attribute or coordinate.

Do you have any comments on these thoughts?

Sounds good to me!

Hmm... it is a little strange, and I can't recall exactly why it
inherits from QAction.
I think it was something planned for the future but not implemented at
the time. Anyway,
I'm in favour of your proposal.

It all sounds good to me! I'm just happy to see MapLayerActions used
more extensively
and get a bit more publicity.

Let me know if you need any assistance with these changes.

you can uste gdal python bindings, see:

or you can start gdal_tranlate in the background to do the job

Message-ID: <CABRzcz9KFA1aXQ-6cn2SVkK-zOgfbpNR_ckEK8kuZVFROOWAWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,



*Weekly Report 12*

*What was done this week?*

   - Successfully updated the plugin with the angle constraint algorithm.

   - Cleaned and commented the code.


*What is the plan for the next week?*

   - Complete the documentation in an exhaustive manner so that anyone will
   be able to understand the work done as well as make it easier for
   developers to use/modify the code to continue work on other aspects of
   Schematization.

   - Prepare for final evaluation.

Are you starting your shell for building by running the batch file as
indicated here [0]?

If so, it should be finding the Qt installed in OSGeo4W, not the C:/Qt
install. It seems like you have another build environment, in addition to
OSGeo4W already installed.

Note: the INSTALL doc may be out-of-date, and you may have to edit the
batch file contents to reflect the current setup of OSGeo4W, as indicated
in INSTALL.


When posting build issue questions like these, please add more context as
to what your build setup is, and what you have already tried. For example,
you noted:

> I really am disappointed because I can not manage to compile the source
code qgis on any platform Mac/ Windows 7 nor with MinGW or Visual Studio ...

However, there was no followup by you regarding previous emails to the list
with build directions and help offered to you. We would like to help you
get QGIS compiled, but it is difficult to discern what you have done in
your attempts to do so.

You have posted multiple times for similar issues. Please try to limit the
conversation to one thread, so others can logically follow along and look
back over what you have tried.

For larger code snippets and logs, consider using an online paste board,
e.g. https://gist.github.com/ or http://osgeo.pastebin.com , etc., and
including the link(s) to code you have posted there.

Regards,

Larry

Turning the editing off is possible on fields. So this issue I can not

In that case, QGIS is upgrading the project to the Chugiak version and 
the problem I specified in the previous mail occurs.

I had a look and did some experiments, but it turned out that it is a
bit too much for me at the moment.

A short summary. We have now the following classes (that I found)

Custom Actions:
Map Layer Actions:
 * QgsMapLayerAction
 * QgsMapLayerActionRegistry
 * QgsAttributeTableMapLayerAction (QAction)
 
 * QgsAction (A custom action)
 * QgsAttributeAction (Pendant to QgsMapLayerActionRegistry -- don't
trust it's name it's not a single action)
 * QgsAttributeTableAction (QAction)

One problem with creating a QAction for both is ownership and
identification.
When used for a context menu, that is not a problem. It's really short
living, in this time nobody is going to change the actions. However, if
you build a menu for e.g. an attribute dialog, it will be there for
longer and in that time, somebody can remove actions while the menu is
shown. As the actions are not copy-able they will then just have
disappeared.
In the case of QgsAttributeAction, these are triggered by an ID, which
is its place in the list of actions. If you remove one, all subsequent
IDs will change.

A QAction is not copyable and should be owned by the menu it resides in.
Therefore the registries should instead of managing QActions rather be
managing action templates, from which it's possible to generate a
QAction. The generated QAction should then either contain all
information required to run the action (a copy of the template) or be
able to tell, when underlying information has changed (action deleted,
id changed)...

It's not so easy (but maybe possible) to fix all this while keeping the
API stable.

Hi all.
I have been told popups do not work in Internet Explorer 11 for LM 2.10 beta4 and
QGIS 2.4: does anyone confirms?
Unfortunately I cannot test, not having IE at hand.
I have sample projects if someone wants to test.
All the best.

Hi,
Can anyone give me hints on statistical background behind linear
transformation in Georeferencer plugin?

I want to know the formulae used to calculate the residuals while using
linear translation.
Any related paper/material on which it is developed??

Thanks and Regards

Dear Sajid,

linear transformation (from my practice) use three unknowns
offset (Easting, Northing) and scale. No rotational angle.
The linear is not a good name for it.
E' = Eoffset + scale * E
N' = Noffset + scale * N

I received an update yesterday and didn't pay attention. I updated the 
second machine today. It seems like I've seen this on the list early 
this week or last - but I've cleaned out email.

The last ubuntu update breaks the QGIS Grass Plugin - the plugin wants 
grass 6.4.3 but grass has went to 6.4.4 at some point. Since I didn't 
pay great attention I'm not entirely sure if grass upgraded or the 
plugin downgraded. I'm not 100% sure it was this upgrade - but 
regardless this last one finished things breaking (if it started earlier).

Hi Zortan

Thank you for the reply.

Would be great to know, how this Offsets and scale is calculated from a set
of GCP's.
Any idea?

You did see some emails about this.

The plugin was removed, GRASS upgraded. When a new version of GRASS gets
added to the repo the main QGIS package has to be rebuilt for the
qgis-grass-plugin to match. That hasn't happened yet.

I'm not sure if there's an option with Launchpad to force rebuild of
QGIS whenever GRASS gets uploaded. Forwarding to the Ubuntugis group.

Thanks,
Alex

I just cleaned out my inbox, deleted everything in trash, and then ran

	method
Message-ID: <CAFO80_q1ARcMYBx_od01L_BTxC8voEA3UBC8RwnHWmgwi7OY1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've a problem rendering WMS usign "simple rendering" as in:
http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/composer.html#simple-rendering

I noticed that WMS calls during rendering add an uncorrect dpi
resolution parameter set to 0
and this value is set by this call:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/raster/qgsrasterlayerrenderer.cpp#L158

commenting that line rendering is correct, but in this moment I don't
know If this call is wrong or I'm wrong forgetting to set something in
the renderContext.

my code is here:
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_omero/blob/2.0/SchedaEdificio.py#L315

dpi value is set correctly here:
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_omero/blob/2.0/SchedaEdificio.py#L326

but its' value is overridden with 0 during rendering all the layers.

Please help me to understand if it's a bug or my fault

Thank you, Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it - luipir at gmail.com)

NOTE:
render is ok using saveAsImage method in mapCanvas as in:
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_omero/blob/2.0/SchedaEdificio.py#L227

Dear Sajid,

checking the source of the plugin I realized that different scales are 
used in easting and northing direction. So the formulas look like:
E' = Eoffset + Escale * E
N' = Noffset - Nscale * N

The minus in N formula is because of the different axis direction in the 
screen coordinates and map coordinates.
The four unknowns are calculated from a least squares estimation.

Regards,
Zoltan

Sorry, I accidentally didn't send it the to qgis-community-team ML initially. 
Who could fix it? I'm not familiar with the webpage stuff.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q670DC+AZvr7cgpbD7qLxVXX673qUQk1UAWpd1vthOLWsGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I noticed that when I use SVG symbols located in an optional path as
set in "Settings->Options->System->SVG Paths" the symbols are not
found from QGIS server.


The solution would be to add such information (currently missing) to
the project file, because this is mandatory for the server to locate
the symbols.


Should I file a ticket?

I guess the issue was resolved.

Look at this tickets.

and this
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8664

You should define one or more environment variables.
for path.

We use this approach succesfully.

Hi,

Are you attending FOSS4G in Portland? If so, do developers/users want to
get together at some point during the week to discuss QGIS, or maybe just
have a beer, etc.?

I will be there all week, but have to leave early on Saturday (day of Code
Sprint Open).

I will be there too. When we pick a day/time we should send it to the

Would be great to have a beer with other QGIS contributors! I'm there from 
Tuesday to Friday.

Hi Paolo,

Could you add an issue, so that I planify to check it on my Windows box ?
Thanks for the report

Hi,

I have changed my opinin.
>From +1 to +0

Infact I discovered just now that gdal driver for spatialite don't
seem to support tables with more than 1 geometrt field.
Almost on QGIS.

Just to explain why this is an important question.

On a sqlite db is impossible to remove a field.
So if a table is with two geometry field, it is never see-able from qgis.
Because is not possible a command like:

alter table remove filed geometry-2;

Bye,

Andrea Peri.

Hi Matthias,

I tried now several times to sent the email, but without success. So
let's try again.

please take a look on my inline comments.

Turning the editing off is possible on fields. So this issue I can not
confirm.

In that case, QGIS is upgrading the project to the Chugiak version and
the problem I specified in the previous mail occurs.

kind regards

Hi Markus,

is it possible for you to download a nightly build or weekly build and 
see if the same thing happens if you open your 2.2 project with this

I'm almost certain that there's code - or at least knowhow - available
for GDAL to add support for more than one table also for Spatialite.
@Pirmin: What do you think?

Hi Stefan,

More information to explain better:

The code is available in qgis.
But don't work.

I try it using a spatialite 4.2.0 created with spatialite-gui.
And having a table with two geometry fields.
One of type Polygon and another of type Point (the centroids of the
polygons geometries).

Using the OGR provider it see both the geometry, but when load them
the point layer don't work.

My point is just to say that actually the only stable solution to
access to a spatialite db is using the spatialite provider.

A.

Dear Andrea,

what about using DB Manager's SQL window?
There you can input an SQL select.

To remove a column in SQLite you can create a new table without the column 
to delete and then use
INSERT INTO new_table SELECT ...

Regards,
Zoltan

On a sqlite db is impossible to remove a field.
So if a table is with two geometry field, it is never see-able from qgis.
Because is not possible a command like:

alter table remove filed geometry-2;

Bye,

Andrea Peri.

Hi Zoltan.

Yes, this is the usual solution in the sqlite world.

I don't like it because is not a scalable solution when there are many 
records and there are relations with other tables.
Also an usual problem is to have a primary key filed with the same 
values of the original table.

The solution
create table as select ...

dont allow to have a primary key field of type integer incremental.

It need a more uggly
create table(...);
insert into .... select .....

But also this don't allow to have the same pk for the same records.

Hi Bob

QGIS allows you to have dynamic objects on top of map canvas. These
objects are called map canvas items, having QgsMapCanvasItem as a base
class. You can either implement your own item or use an existing
implementation, e.g. QgsRubberBand class (used for example to
highlight features when doing identification). In your case, you could
have one QgsRubberBand instance and just change its position on map
whenever appropriate.

Cheers
Martin

Hi Matthias,

I compiled QGIS with from the aur repository. I will try to download and
compile QGIS using the nightlybuild. And then I will inform you about
the situation.

Hi Martin,   I'm sorry to ask you again.   I looked up QgsRubberBand class, it has 5 Geometry types: Point, Line, Polygon, UnknownGeometry, NoGeometry. It seems there's no way to add a svg  symbol as a car icon on the map, or I was on a wrong way?    Here is some questions:   1, How to add a svg symbol as a instance's icon? I tried QgssvgmarkerSymbolLayerV2 class, but it didn't display.   2, How to draw a line or polygon using QgsRubberBand? I constructed a QgsRubberband instance, set some attributes, however it was not display.   Sorry to bother you.
Best RegardsBob

Message-ID: <53F34EE8.30303@gmail.com>

Hi all,

With Matthias' work on the new edit widgets, we have some wrappers that 
allow using some Qt widgets as edit widgets but also some custom widgets 
(relation reference, color button, etc.).

At first, the wrapper classes were named as widgets (e.g. 
QgsColorWidget). But these are not really the widgets.
This brings some confusion and some naming conflicts:

1. QgsColorWidget inherits from QgsEditorWidgetWrapper. It should be 
named according to its functionnality.

2. We have a naming conflict: if we create a class for the widget, we 
can't name it properly as the name Widget is already taken.

Hence, I proposed [0] to rename the widgets to wrappers.

This breaks C++ API but not Python since widgets/wrappers are not 
available yet.
This code was brought in 2.4.

I am quite sure nobody used this part of the API.
I know API should not be changed, and if we start making exception if 
can be a mess. But considering that:
* it's a very narrow part of the code
* that it's not available in python
* it improves the readability
* it will avoid naming problems in the future

I am asking for this change.
If nobody claims something before August 26th, the pull request [0] will 
be merged.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] visual changelog incorporation in qgis.org
Message-ID: <53F36696.5060203@duif.net>

(sorry for cross posting)

We finished the incorporation the outputs of

http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.4.0/

into the web site itself:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog240/QGIS-2.4.0.html

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog220/QGIS-2.2.0.html

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog200/QGIS-2.0.0.html

Before we retrieved the changelog data as a atom feed (without images),
peeled it with JQuery and injected it in the site, making it non
translatable.
Now we download rest and build it into the website, and it will be
translatable.

For the latest/testing version it is the feed can still be used (and is
now working WITH images also, still non translatable).

SO the idea about the future:

- when a dev or user fixes an important bug, or introduces a new
feature, create a changelog entry for it including screenie.

- it would be nice if the same dev also wrote some docs for that
feature, so the upgrading of the docs could go a little smoother.

- I also think we could use the same application to create a (huge) list
of features, exactly on the same way: some text and a screenie.
Any volunteers :-) ?

ps we will move the 'projecta' site qgis.org server in near future

SVG markers are not supported by QgsRubberBand. You may want to
implement your own canvas item for that - try to have a look at
QgsVertexMarker class for some inspiration.

This section from PyQGIS cookbook should help you:

Hi Nyals,

I have reproduced the bug under Ubuntu 14.04 and QGIS 2.4, with the
backtrace [1].
The "core" file is about 1,5 Go (!!) so I cannot send it here.

In the Gist I posted, you may delete the line 21 and add

method0()

at the end to reproduce the bug.

Thanks Richard,
It's great to have the changelog on the main website now.
Let's see how we can link it prominently.
Best wishes

Does it make any difference if you change:
c = QgsComposition(QgsMapSettings())

To:
ms=QgsMapSettings()
c=QgsComposition(ms)

?

	please try to reproduce to confirm
Message-ID: <CAHVp9Xrbr9sigOtZHPU9Yd=V+2NrE8r1vk2im+S56KS+0zqzpw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a QGIS plugin where I need to commit changes every time a
new feature is added in an SQLite database. I was using

layer.startEditing()
layer.addFeature(feature, False) OR layer.addFeature(feature, True)
layer.commitChanges()

After about 10 to 15 features the system began to slow significantly with
periods of 100% CPU usage increasing until the system became unusable.

To assess if this was my code or something in QGIS 2.4 on Debian Wheezy, I
created a simple point shapefile and added points and saved each time (both
trying just saving and stopping editing and saving) and again at about 10
to 15 points the system failed.

My request is simple.
1. Can someone else confirm that this happens on other systems
2. If so, is there some way around this until this fixed?

Thanks

TSW

Hi Trevor,

just guessing: Is your plugin applying the 
editingStarted()/editingStopped() signals? If not there are plugins 
around that do it and are known to slow down QGIS. So if it is not your 
plugin first thing would be to unload _all_ plugins and see if the 
problem persists. If not reload the plugins only one at a time to 
identify the one causing the problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help on Oracle provider on Debian
Message-ID: <53F444B5.7000400@duif.net>

Hi devs,

I want to invest some time into testing/working with the QGIS Oracle
driver (both for QGIS-Desktop and QGIS-Server).

First thing needed, I have: installed Oracle DB on a CentOS machine.

But for next thing: compiling QGIS with OracleProvider on Linux/Debian
enabled, I'll need some hints.

Anybody experience with installing/compiling OCI on Debian, and able to
provide a link or info about how that's done.

I found this (old) link:

http://ggorjan.blogspot.com/2007/04/oracle-instantclient-odbc-on-debian.html

Which reminded me to earlier Oracle work: there is always so much to
download, not clear what you need and what is just cruft.

So if somebody is able to describe the minimal Oracle stuff I need to be
able to build Oracle Driver that would be great.

I'm happy to describe it later in a blogpost and I'll buy you a
beer/applepie/pizza whatever whenever we meet ;-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard!

I have installed oracle client on my ubuntu some time ago - hopefully
it will be the same with Debian - if it works I opt for a beer ;-)

=[ client SDK ]=

- download from Oracle web (need to register):

instantclient-basiclite-linux.x64-12.1.0.1.0.zip
instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-12.1.0.1.0.zip

- unzip (e.g. somewhere to home dir)

=[ QGIS with Oracle ]=

- configure: -DWITH_ORACLE=TRUE
   + point to the library + include dir

- make sure the client library path is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- run QGIS with custom QT_PLUGIN_PATH=...../output/lib/qgis/plugins
  (so that the OCI plugin for Qt is found)

- if running QGIS from Qt Creator, make sure to setup environment for running,
  otherwise it will fail to log in with weird error messages, e.g.
    ORA-12162: TNS:net service name is incorrectly specified
  environment:
    ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe
    ORACLE_SID=XE
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/martin/Downloads/oracle/instantclient_12_1

(note: I run Oracle server on localhost, not sure if anything else is
necessary when run on a different machine)

Cheers
Martin

When instantiating QgsMapSettings first, then use this object to
instantiate QgsComposition, this works well with no segfault.

Without your help, I could have spent many times on this issue without even
noticing this small difference. Thanks a lot again !

Is it still an issue, though, or should I close the issue I added in the
hub ?

Best wishes,
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSGeo4W installer: lost plugins, configuration,
	not printers
Message-ID: <53F4543F.8080805@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just updated qgis-dev using OSGeo4W installer. I had the bad surprise 
that all plugins and the configuration (toolbars, etc) were lost. Also, 
I don't have access to the printers when trying to print.

Anyone knows what could have happened?

Is there a way to restore the config?

PS: installation was done on an admin account, while QGIS is used in 
another user account.

Cheers,

Denis

Martin/other python experts,

What's the best way to fix this? Is /Transfer/ appropriate, given that the
c++ code would never delete this object? Or is there an alternative sip
flag which is more appropriate for this?

I think this is really API problem rather than Python-specific issue.
The QgsComposition is designed in a way that it always had
QgsMapRenderer from map canvas accessible (now changed to
QgsMapSettings). Worst of all, it is supposed to be the same instance
as used by map canvas - so it keeps just reference/pointer to
QgsMapSettings/QgsMapRenderer. The QgsComposition should be fixed so
that it does not require QgsMapSettings/QgsMapRenderer - after all, it
does not make much sense, there may be several composer map items with
different configuration. Each QgsComposerMap should have its own
QgsMapSettings instance.

The root of the problem here is that the QgsMapSettings() will create
an instance and then destroy it - while QgsComposition just keeps
blindly using dead reference. /Transfer/ or other annotations will
IMHO not solve the problem. I would consider is as a known issue and
live with it until API is not fixed.

Btw. using "c = QgsComposition( QgsMapRenderer() )" is also wrong
because of the same reasons. If it worked, it was just luck :-)

Regards
Martin

Agreed. I guess we'll have to live with this until the next API break.

Thanks Nyall and Martin for your help.

In my plugin I get around it by storing the instance of QgsMapRenderer or
QgsMapSettings (depending on QGIS version) in a class property; which I
then use the instantiate QgsComposition

Could you please comment on the issue to keep track of it ? (or close it
and open a more generic one ?) http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11077

Kind regards,
Michael

   - iconv
   - pyqt4
   - qt4-devel
   - qwt5-devel-qt4
   - sip
   - spatialite
   - libspatialindex-devel
   - python-qscintilla


and all of it works well, but at cmake I have this problem

Thanks Bernhard. I did try uninstalling my Python plugins with no effect.
It however should not make any difference because I can recreate the issue
manually which should not be affected by any plugins.

What I've done for my plugin, as I'm already using the pyspatialite
library, is to replace qgis calls with direct writes with the spatialite
library and I don't have any slow down.

It seems to me that something funny is going on with QGIS itself but I
found a work around for my own issue for now.

Thanks again

Hi to all,
just a quick warning for (it) translators:
I just noticed the Italian translation is broken for some context help e.g.
Road Graph, SQL Anywhere, Python Console etc, in the latest master branch.
It was fine in the final 2.4.

Anyone knows the reason of that?

Best Regards,
-SL

Hi Andreas,
I'm struggling to have connection using service work here on windows. 
I tried putting a pg_service.conf file in AppData/postgres dir, or on a
location defined by environnement variable with no success. 

The content seems ok , but client (pgadmin, qgis) do not locate that file
correctly. Do you have any hint for us? Pg doc is light, and the web is
almost totally empty on that.

R?gis

procmon is your friend.  The file is called .pg_service.conf - and apparently
libpq expects it to be in unix format (ie. only LF as line ending and not CRLF)

Refer to ms-windows/osgeo4w/package.cmd for the cmake settings used in the
normal build.

Hi,
looking at the code it seems that until at b8bdc8f it was fine,
after that commit a lot of translation strings are missing.

I refer to strings which have not changed since 2.4 e.g. Python
Console, Road Graph plugin context help.
I suppose that if there are not gui strings changed the translation
string will be kept, or not?

Hi!

Ah ok - now I know.
Translators made me aware of some facts that are not true anymore in
context help and I adjusted the information in this context help
(fe4e552e) to more reflect the current state. (I know - should have
been made before 2.4 release). It seems that context_help is not
updated very often.

regards
Werner

The plugins are becoming more numerous and the number is expected to
grow, it may be useful to include a tree filtered by category, ie
digitizing, vector, raster, geoprocessing plugin, instead of a list
widget.

I'm not a huge fan of trees for this kind of thing. How about better
filtering options.

I think you can already filter on tags?

It works!

you saved me again J?rgen! 

I'm not totally clear yet on how to use procmon for that.. (just another
tip?)

It can often be difficult to know which category to put your pride & joy 
into.

Hidden keywords that can be filtered on, might be useful. Hidden so they 
don't clutter the screen.

Download procmon[1], run it and filter for process name qgis(-dev)-bin.exe and
try a connection using a postgresql service.  QGIS (or better put libpq linked
into it) will then look for .pg_service.conf in what seems to be
%APPDATA%\postgresql.

On second thought the unix file ending thing might be due to the fact that we
set the runtime library to binary mode, which libpq might not expect.  Maybe
browser doesn't do that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Struggling with iface.openFeatureForm()
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_E6uE5FQVD9NAsggQca88Pps6ZMXSHNTGW_HQ3mfBAaCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to finish a plugin that was initially designed for 1.8.

Our workflow is currently on QGIS 2.2, but we will update in the future, so
I'm doing some test in 2.4 and in master.

My goal is to open the feature form of a temporary feature in a layer, and
keep it's attribute values for future actions.

The code is something like this:

mc = iface.mapCanvas()
> layer = mc.currentLayer()
> temp_feature = QgsFeature()
> attributes = []
>


# getting default values (for primary keys)

provider = layer.dataProvider()
> for j in layer.pendingAllAttributesList():
>     if provider.defaultValue(j):
>         attributes.append(provider.defaultValue(j))
>     else:
>         attributes.append(None)
> temp_feature.setAttributes(attributes)
>

>
iface.openFeatureForm(layer, temp_feature)
>


print temp_feature.attributes()


My "problems" are:

In 2.2, after I edit the feature form and press the OK button, the
temp_feature attributes are updated, but so is the first (already commited)
feature of my layer...weird.

In 2.4, the Feature Form always open in non editng mode, even when the
current layer is editable.

In master (2.5 1b205be), after pressing the feature form ok button, a new
feature is automaticly added to the attribute table, and the temporary
feature attributes are not updated.

I though it might be something to do with *updateFeatureOnly* boolean
value, but setting it to True does not seems to make any difference.

Can anyone of you QGIS developing masters throw some light into my poor
brain?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Bernhard,

Thanks for the link, I guess that the 2.4 problem was already identified
and corrected in master.

A bit of update on this matter. Regarding 2.2. I was doing my tests with a
dbf layer. With a postgis table is working well. So I can work with that
for now.

Still, it seems that there is something to fix in 2.5. should I open a
ticket?

In QGIS 2.5 the problem is different. Opening and editing a new feature
form with openFeatureform(temp_feature) automatically adds it to the layer,
and does not update the temp_feature attributes after you press ok.

I believe that the original behavior were to update the temp_feature
attributes and then you would need to manually add the feature to the layer
with layer.addFeature(temp_feature), this would allow some feature
manipulation between the processes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Resurrecting the RFC (QEP - QGIS Enhancement
	Proposal)
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9Py9e6-Yk1OjPJJ++0mLKkvooBgQSJTUfqFXbh00k-UQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I would like to raise something I have been considering for a while now. We
are becoming a large project, in code and users, and there has been some
recent issues of developers doing work only for there to be disagreements
on the implementation. I would like resurrect the use of RFCs, or I think
would should name them QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal because that sounds
much cooler :)

My thinking behind this was:

- QGIS is picking up pace in popularity and use so we need something to
formalise the future feature set and any improvements for the next version.
 Most people know the Python project uses the idea of PEPs in order to
document what new major features are coming in X version and to explain the
rational, or reasons .  I have found this handy to be able to look at
detailed overview of why a feature made it or didn't, or when it might make
it, or if ever.

- This is more then just using the bug tracker to log future features. This
is something where we can have more detail and then break it down into sub
tasks which can live in the bug tracker but linked to the QEP (RFC).

- The QEP should also have formal voting and discussion around the
proposal. This should be limited to a small pool of developers.

- The QEP could also list changes the API, or if breaking changes need to
be made.

- Things like how the new feature might fit into other future plans.

- QEPs should list as much detail as possible in order to help everyone see
the bigger picture with the feature or change.

Another reason I was thinking about this was in order to consolidate major
features and collaborate better. Emails are fine but get lost and forgotten
very easily, the bug tracker is the same.  The QEP can link to the emails
and tickets for future reference.  QEPs should be the central point for the
feature linking to everything that is related.

Tim has been using GitHub for inaSAFE RFCs and it looks good. IMO I would
say we should use that.

Thoughts?

Nathan

Hi,

I'm mostly an observer of QGIS dev, but I think it would be a nice move to help
coordination and formalize big changes. GDAL or MapServer have been successfully
following such a practice for years. See
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/RfcList or
http://mapserver.org/development/rfc/index.html for possible ideas for the
Content table of a RFC (mostly what Nathan suggested)
The voting is typically limited to PSC members, whereas the discussion phase is
open to everyone to give their input.

Why?   PYTHON_LIBRARY points at %O4W_ROOT%/apps/Python27/libs/python27.lib in
package.cmd

bison.exe (or it's m4) apparently doesn't like to be run from a directory with
blanks.  Try installing into a directory without blanks.

Hi Martin,

I owe you a beer :-)

Thanks! Succesfull. Biggest hurdle was that I was in the impression that
the libocci.so.12.1 was the mail lib, but it appears that
libclntsh.so.12.1 is the one you need.

Will do some connections testing and test with qgisserver, and write a
blog article about it.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Nathan,

Sorry for top-posting, but I think your idea is very much needed. I was
looking into labeling changes, built upon Nyall's recent work, and found
the new features to be drastic enough to warrant a QEP (I like the acronym
as well).

Question: at what point does a new feature need to go through the QEP
process? (You mentioned 'major features.') Or, are you suggesting all new
features have an accompanying QEP?

This should go a long ways towards ensuring stability is always taken into
consideration, too.

Regards,

Larry

We are becoming a large project, in code and users, and there has been some
recent issues of developers doing work only for there to be disagreements
on the implementation. I would like resurrect the use of RFCs, or I think
would should name them QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal because that sounds
much cooler :)
>
> Thoughts?

I'm strongly in favor of this idea, and for formalizing the
commit/development process in general. Like Larry mentioned, we'd need some
guidelines about what kind of changes are OK just to push through without a
QEP.

I'm also curious about time lines, given that often pull requests sit with
no response for many months (years?). Would there be an automatic
acceptance after a set time with no -1s?

On a related note, I'd also like to see some additional rules put in place
around acceptable commits:
- all commits which modify CORE components should be accompanied by unit
tests, unless exemption is granted in advance by the dev list. GUI and app
would be immune due to the difficulties in implementing ui tests
- all api changes should include detailed documentation, including a
description of all variables and their use

This is probably a discussion for another thread though...

I like the idea of QEPs. I think we could adopt a process very similar
to GDAL RFCs.

@Larry - regarding stuff going through QEP process: I don't think
every small feature needs QEP. We could have a rule of thumb to decide
when QEP is necessary - e.g. new additions to core/gui library or when
a development is going to add a lot of code (>1K lines) or there will
be significant impact to user interface.

Cheers
Martin

I have already raised this on the GDAL-Dev forum (a lot of help but no

here.
I use QGIS for verification of an application that uses pure GDAL (built by

I have had some problems with a particular MrSID file where 'gdalinfo' run
from QGIS gives a different (although correct result) compared to 'pure'
gdal.
Both versions when running 'gdalinfo --version' give 'GDAL 1.11.0, released
2014/04/16'
I am building GDAL using the latest MrSID DSDK 9.0.0.3864.

The results of the gdal_info are as follows, the differences highlighted in
bold:

The problem appears to be in the 'false_easting'.

What I would like to know is, what QGIS does differently? 
The answer from GDAL-Dev was that there was a bug in gdal but how can this
be if QGIS reports a different answer using the same gdal version?
What can I do to make my gdal do the same as the gdal built into QGIS? Is it
a tweaked data file?
This is causing me major issues as I need to be able to display these MrSID
files in the application that we have and at the moment they are about 145
miles out!

Hope someone can help.

Thanks

Martin

Hi Nathan,

I was thinking the same way lately. QGIS has now plenty of feature, and while 
this is really great, our technical debt seems to be increasing a lot 
recently.
Having a formal process for major new features as MapServer and GDAL have, 
would allow to have a much more coherent way of developping qgis.
Strong +1 on the idea then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis.org repository public key for Ubuntu expired
Message-ID: <53F70ED0.1070005@gmail.com>

Hi there,

I see that the public key mentioned on the website 
(http://downloads.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu) 
has expired.

I use Ubuntu Precise and was successful before to use the qgis 
repository ( deb http://qgis.org/debian precise main). But now I get an 
error when updating my package list against the qgis.org repo for ubuntu 
precise.

My current QGIS is at 2.4.0 and this is an extract from the output 
(Dutch) from the 'apt-key list' command, from which it seems that the 
key has expired since 18 August:

pub   1024R/47765B75 2013-08-18 [verlopen: 2014-08-18]
uid                  Quantum GIS Archive Automatic Signing Key (2013) 
<qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>

Obviously, reinstalling the same key did not help.

Hopefully somebody can handle this!

You didn't verify that before posting. ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend refactoring - part II - ready for merge
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfO76zqtWeRyj_kssssPPVpRCoYWoSQNLe1wasANymaWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

In recent weeks I have been busy with the second part of legend
refactoring. The main goals were:
- clean up the mess with legend - there are three different ways of
legend presentation/rendering: 1. in legend widget (now layer tree
view), 2. composer legend, 3. WMS legend
- make legend rendering independent from composer - so it can be used
elsewhere - in WMS or in GUI
- allow different strategies how legend for a layer is created - until
now the legend generation was hardcoded - this should allow things
like data-defined legend, labeling / diagrams in legend
- allow new types of legend items - for greater flexibility of item
appearance - e.g. show a gradient color ramp for raster layer

The code is in my repository:
https://github.com/wonder-sk/QGIS/compare/legend-refactoring-part2

To introduce the important new classes:
- QgsLegendRenderer - takes care of rendering of the legend - similar
to how QgsMapRenderer handles rendering of map
- QgsLegendSettings - contains user configuration of the legend
(fonts, colors, sizes, spacing) - similar to QgsMapSettings for map
- QgsMapLayerLegend - base class for legend implementations. For a
layer an implementation should return a list of legend nodes
- QgsLayerTreeModelLegendNode - base class for legend node
implementation. Provides data(), flags() methods used in the layer
tree model and provides draw() method for rendering of legend in
composer/WMS

The QgsMapLayerLegend and QgsLayerTreeModelLegendNode classes are used
by QgsLayerTreeModel to generate and display legend in a tree.
QgsLegendRenderer makes use of QgsLayerTreeModel and allows the legend
nodes do their legend rendering.

An example of custom legend node:
- screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/GtvTlQ7.png
- code: https://gist.github.com/wonder-sk/c5d925833bcd54b9e401

An example of custom dock widget using legend renderer:
- screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/EAvE96u.png
- code: https://gist.github.com/wonder-sk/211b7130b58e50d78e6d
(in the screenshot above you can also see legend node icon embedded in
layer node)

There are not many changes visible to the user - the changes are
mainly visible for developers. From the few user-visible changes:
- in layer tree view - if a layer has just one legend item, it will be
shown on the left side of the layer name instead of occupying another
line. This is what already happens in composer.
- in composer legend item settings - 1) there is tree view with just
one column, label style is set in popup menu, 2) when auto-update is
on, the tree view is synchronized with project's layer tree and it is
read-only. When auto-update is off, it is possible to manipulate the
source legend tree

Regarding backward compatibility, there are two things worth mentioning:
- QgsComposerLegend::model() will return QgsLegendModel which is not
in use anymore. There is QgsComposerLegend::modelV2() as a
replacement. The way how the models work is significantly different
and I don't see a way of fixing that without a complex and fragile
synchronization logic. Anyway, according to Nathan's plugin analyser
tool there are no plugins using composer's legend model
- reading of older projects with composer legend ignores the
customization (e.g. renamed items, reordered items, removed items). If
time allows, I will try to address this before the release

So... please have a look if you are interested and enjoy the endless
possibilities of new legends :-)
If there are no objections I will merge it during the next week.

Regards
Martin

You should give people at least a full week to look at the new code.

Hi Nathan

Sounds good to me (no strong opinion wheter to call it RFC or QEP). The 
old RFC template is even online 
(http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/RFC_Template).

So open questions:

- What needs to have an RFC?
     Proposal Martin: >1000 lines of code /  modification to core/gui / 
UI changes

- Who can vote?
     PSC only (GDAL) / committers

- How long shall the period from RFC/QEP announcement until finish of 
voting period be? Probably it needs a 'remember, you have to vote' mail 
a few days before end of voting period.

Will be cool if Larry can do the first QEP of the 'modern age'.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Plugin - Numerical Digitize
	Question/Modification
Message-ID: <C0C245000D79DB41822EBA612C15BD2332ED2FCF@AGEXM05.eas.ds.ky.gov>

Greetings All,

My question is for a developer that works with the Numerical Digitize plugin.

I am employed at a non-profit planning agency that works with water and wastewater utilities. Many of these utilities have handheld GPS units that return a text file with geographic coordinates in longitude and latitude. It would be extremely beneficial for these utilities to plot their appurtenances and update shapefiles themselves. Experimenting with the current Numerical Digitize plugin, it appears the tool is designed for XY coordinate entries.

Is it possible for the tool to be modified so that geographic positions (longitude/latitude) can be entered?

The data I am experimenting with is in KY SP Single Zone (EPSG 3089).

I am running QGIS Desktop 2.0.1, on Windows XP. I installed the software using OSGeo4W Shell.

Should this be an easy modification, I will be happy to share sample data with a developer.

Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to receiving a response.

Josh Farrow

Another good rule of thumb is "if you ask yourself is a change is worth a RFC, 
then it is worth it"

>

>      PSC only (GDAL) / committers

With GIT, 'committers' can be anyone. You probably meant folks who have push 
rights in official repo ? If you give them voting rights, and potentially veto 
right (not sure how the rules of the voting system of QGIS are), then they are 
defacto PSC members, since they can steer the direction of the project. Not 
saying this is bad. Just a consequence.

You probably have to distinguish two phases :
- a discussion phase. The length might depend on the reactions of the readers, 
if the RFC needs to be reworked, etc... Difficult to put a max length. Generally 
it is left to the appreciation of the person who writes the RFC to feel when 
enough concensus has been reached so that the voting phase will approve their 
RFC
- the voting phase. In GDAL/MapServer, motions are to be voted theoretically 
within 2 business days. This might be short however.

I'd say neither psc nor commit rights are a good fit. While I agree that
the psc should definitely have a say, not everyone on the psc is a
developer or has c++ coding experience. Similarly, we have people who have
commit rights who are neither developers nor psc members.

Since a big part of the qep would be commenting on proposed technical
architecture, I think its fairly important that developers have a good say
in the process. But conversely if the qep process determines the direction
of QGIS, then non devs on the psc should also have a say.

So, I'd say we need a new group for voters. We could have a process like:
- a candidate is nominated & seconded (possibly by psc members only?)
- the candidate gives a short reasoning on why they'd like to be part of
the group and what skills they have
- after receiving a set number of votes the candidate is accepted into the
group. (Again, possibly only the psc could vote on candidates?).

Same here, I don't think we should increase dependency on this static
classification.

Better integration of tag filtering is the way to go. A combobox in the
search panel would be fine I think.

Ah wow - I've been playing with it here and it is so much nicer from
the UI point of view. Two things I picked up though.

* I don't know how to reproduce it exactly but it seems that when I
change the text for a layer name in general properties it updates the
legend fine but after using QGIS a little more I notice that the layer
name reverts to its previous state. I will post more details if I
figure out how to replicate this.

* Do you have any strategy for dealing with symbols larger than the
thumbnail in the legend? e.g. if you set the size of a circle  to 8 it
basically draws a square. This is not a regression as the old legend
implementation suffered the same thing, but I was hoping a new
implementation could offer a fix for this. I know there are limits to
what we can do in the space of the legend but perhaps having some
simple system whereby symbol previews are proportionally scaled such
that the largest icon will always fit into the space provided and the
smaller ones are relatively reduced in scale? Perhaps someone else has
some creative ideas on how to improve their visual representation in
the legend?

Great stuff as always Martin!

Tim

Ok on a little further investigation it seems this is an issue with
renaming gpx layers - I suspect the driver is at fault here since it
does it in QGIS 2.4 too.

Hi Nyall

Having another process to nominate QEP voters sounds too complicated to me.

 >not everyone on the psc is a developer or has c++ coding experience

There is a mix of coders and non-coders in the PSC on purpose. 
Developers sometimes have a narrow point of view, so it is good that 
also non-developers have a say. In the discussion part of the QEP, the 
consequences for users can be mentioned. I don't consider that a 
problem, even for very technical subjects (and even those usually have 
somehow an influence on the users of a software).

I'm putting RFC/QEP on the agenda to discuss at the next PSC meeting 
(http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/PSC_Meeting_5_September_2014).

Regards,
Marco

OK, fair enough. But would non-psc members be able to comment on proposals?

That's also my opinion. Everyone can discuss, not everyone can vote (and 
my expectation is that controversial RFC/QEP will be very very rare).

I agree it is a major issue of the legend currently. I think the best 
would be to have it scaled to get the largest symbol to fit in the 
square and the others proportional to it, but marking that it has been 
scaled (for example with a frame) and show the actual size (in a small 
popup?) when hovering on or clicking the symbol.

Leyan

I think we can add a 'features' feature - I'll get Ismail to work on
it - please file a ticket with your requirements & we can discuss
further there.

Your changes seem fine to me, but no doubt someone will complain when
we break API....could you at least add a changelog entry notifying of
what the API incompatibilities are?

I had the same impression as Nyall. PSC is meant to steer direction of
the whole project, not to deal with technical details of
implementations in QEPs - after all, only 3 out of 7 positions are
meant for developers. At the same time I understand that creating
another "developer" committee would make things more complex.


I think that voting on QEPs could be started when the QEP's author has
impression that enough consensus was reached. Most projects also allow
their RFCs to go to 'deferred' state if the proposal is too
controversial.

Originally I thought that only new functionality would be covered by
QEPs, but it is actually quite useful to have one common process for
any significant changes in the project - ranging from development
stuff through infrastructure changes to organizational changes (like
introduction of trademark). So it makes sense to have PSC vote on

As already said, IMHO context help should be removed altogether, and replaced with
the relevant pages of the manual, or a link to them.
All the best.

Hi,
only for better understanding every details,
there is a list of actual member list of PSC.

And my curiosity is for the affermations:

>after all, only 3 out of 7 positions are
>meant for developers

I guess a short curriculum of every psc member could help to understand 
the role of everyone.

Also, AOAIK an important question is undrstand the limit of a RFC.
Infact don't forget that the main enhancement are always covered by one 
or more funders.

Tipically they ask an enhancement with some request themself.

This RFC in the QGIS world is obviously after the real fund phase where 
the funders find the developer and contract him.
So what mean that the RFC is submittable to the PSC ?
If the PSC to accept the RFC required more changeables and these 
changeable require more fund, what happened ?

Or this RFC could be submitted before to find the developer and fund him ?

In this second situation, the RFC should be submited from the funders ?

Thx,

Andrea.

Hi all.
I noticed that a field widget (in my case, hidden) is saved in a project, but not in
a style: is this the intended behaviour? In my view it seems more intuitive if this
would be saved in both.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

this is a good choice, just make sure that the context help is also
available when a user is offline.

Agreed, that's why the first choice I mentioned was replacing, instead of linking.

IMHO it sholuld be the **only** choice. Linking to online help is not an option.

Hi Andrea,

First of all, I tend to agree with Marco, where QEP should be voted when there 
is a general agreement on them. The PSC voting should therefore be enough.

As for you question about QEP vs funders.

What should happen is one of the three following scenarii :

* The funder works with a contractor which knows QGIS and the QEP process well 
enough to guarantee to the funder that the QEP will pass as-is, for the 
originally proposed amount. In this case, the contractor takes the risk.

* The funder provides the QEP and makes the discussions with the community 
until a general agreement is reached. Then the funder finds a company/developer 
to pass a contract for the development phase.

* The funder makes a first contract with a company/developer, to write the QEP 
and reach an agreement (or not). Once the QEP status is set (voted as is, 
voted modified, deferred, rejected), the funder can pass another contract with 
this company/developer (or another) to implement the QEP.

Hi Vincent,

You speak of discussion with community.
This is agreement, but the only important to be sure of the work is the
PSC agreement.
If after 2 weeks the PSC say nothing one could start with a contract
for the development ?

Surely better could be have a +1 explicit from the PSC menbers on the
docs before start the work.

And how PSC vot need to say that the RFC is accepted ?

Please note also that a community discussion could bring far from the
objective of the RFC.
And forgot that only the PSC vote are relevant to say the RFC is
accepted or not.

Another question is:

actually 4/7 of PSC are not technical.
This mean that a RFC could be approved without that any one of
technical comptents are say :
"ok it is compatible with actual QGIS, it don't break anything".
Or evalute if what is potentially breakable is reasonable or not.

My dubt is infact.  A compatibility break is a technical question ?
I guess potentially no, because it is more on QGIS usability , but is
technical when
start to say:

hey using this solution you break the past, instead if you use this
other solution you don't break the past.

Is not simply to evaluate this question, and without a QGIS developer
expert is not easy to follow a RFC for a funder.

A.

So my 2c:

- From the PSC point of view the intention is that the PSC facilitate
teams to work on specific areas e.g. documentation team, UX team etc.
I think RFC's would probably come under Marco's remit (PSC: Code Manager).

I don't think it is necessary for the whole PSC to be involved unless
Marco wants help. So the normal modus operandi would be:

* Marco forms an RFC review team
* People submit RFC's
* Review team accepts or denies the RFC's
* PSC is available to resolve any disputes that may arise or aid in
decision making where review team feels the impact on the project is
broad.

As Marco said, and as it always has been the case in the QGIS project, the PSC 
vote should only be a confirmation of the community advice.
If the PSC vote is contrary to the general community agreement, then we have a 
problem with the PSC itself. It never has been the case AFAIK.
If the community do not generally agree, then there is a problem with the QEP, 
and it has to be either refined, or changed.

> docs before start the work.
The PSC is there to validate the community advice, based on the expertise of 
the latter. If you want to have a sense of agreement before writing a RFC, 
then ask the community.

> And how PSC vot need to say that the RFC is accepted ?
I think the QEP should be officially proposed to the PSC by the original author, 
and the PSC will have a certain amount of time (say 1 week ?) to vote.
This vote should reflect the community advice.
A lack of vote in the given time should lead to QEP validation.

Once again, the PSC vote should only be a validation of the general community 
advice. The required technical competences are in the community at large, and 
the PSC knows to trust the community.

Then the funder hires a QGIS developer to follow the RFC and make report. 
That's my scenario 3.

Hope this clarify your questions. Others, do not hesitate to fix my 
understanding of the process if I am mistaken.

Hey,

I am still of the opinion that the PSC doesn't need to be involved in the
vote unless there is a split.  Most QEPs will be at a technical level and
might take a bit to parse, others might not be.

It might be best to have categories or QEPs so that different groups have
different votes. A QEP for say changing the bug tracking system could be
voted by the PSC for example (example only).

A QEP should come after some discussion on the mailing list. Consider it a
formal proposal rather then a 'what do you think of this idea'. If you are
funding a project then mailing list discussion is highly recommend because
creating a QEP even if you have money and a developer is no guarantee that
it will be accepted.

The whole point of a QEP is to see the full idea of a proposal in one place
and to make sure it will fit with the best interests of the project. Having
10 ways to do X is not and doesn't help our users.

Having QEPs might slow development in the sense that you can no longer just
fund something and have it go in without objection or discussion.

Hi martin,

I'll try to have a check of your modification on wms legend next days (or week)

What mean "the community dont agree" ?
More explain.
If 3 or 4 user community say "no" or "ask different solutions" . It is the
community think ?

I guess the PSC should not ne only a simply executor of the community
think, but  the real director of the project.
Often the community think a thing bit thw more strategic solution is
another.
I guess the server side is always minority on user interest. And often the
user font understand what is a server question.
So the community never choose a server solution.
This mean in the medium time to split the qgis in two distincts products.
Desktop and server.

Every one with its own community.

My 1 ct.

Hi All
The feature of saving styles and .ui forms in a pg/splite database seems
very useful but somehow I can not load any .ui forms from my database.
I successfully saved a .ui form into the database and now I find it in
"layer_styles"."ui". But the tag <editform> ("layer_styles"."styleQML") is
pointing to the original .ui-file.
How can I change <editform> to point to the .ui form saved in the database?
Regards
Josef

probably it's better to change the subject of the thread in something
more useful

about saving ui in SL, if confirmed, could you prepare test data or
prepare a description of the problem filing a tiket?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugins mandatory metadata
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671e7JdmWX-MEG-WrVDTn8W=1dyTj3qT+KAhOGchP99rHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It seems like most of us are still confused about mandatory metadata
in Python plugins.

There have been a lot of discussions on this topic in the past and I
would like to resume the discussion.

IIRC the most debated questions were:

* if "homepage" must be mandatory
* if "tracker" must be mandatory
* if "repository" must be mandatory

We somewhat agreed about leaving those metadata optional but "highly
recommended", this means that the automatic validator still accepts
the plugin but a warning is shown to the author and to website staff
users.

The plugin approval is not automatic, if somebody thinks that for a
particular plugin one of those metadata are absolutely necessary
he/she can just unapprove the plugin.

I'm still convinced that the a.m. metadata should be recommended but
not mandatory but of course we can change this policy.

If I missed the point in which a different decision was taken, please
let me know and I will add those rules to the validator.

I agree they should remain optional for now.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Identify results form vs feature form
Message-ID: <53FB558A.3060301@nurfuerspam.de>

Dear all,

up to QGIS 2.2 there was an Option in Settings -> Options -> Map Tools, 
identify section:

"Open feature form, if a single feature is identified"

I can not find that option in QGIS 2.4 and QGIS dev anymore. It is still 
in the lastest docs

<http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#options>

and it still behaves the same way. But to change the behaviour, I have 
to start my still working copy of QGIS 2.2 or  QGIS 2.0. I guess this is 
not intended.

Am I missing something well-hidden?

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

After a few months of managing the plugin approval queue, I still do not understand
what is the advantage of having plugins without a repo and bugtracker.
I agree that a home page is not a necessity.

All the best.

It's in the identify dialog now.

Sounds like a bug.

IMHO if the objective was to hide it, Nathan miseably failed at it ;)

Paolo,

of course the question is not wether is there an advantage but on the
contrary if is there a penalty without that informations.

IMHO the answer: most of the times yes, but not always.

For simpler plugin, a repository is probably not particularly useful
nor is a bug tracker.

But since the final approval step is human-driven, nobody stops you
from unapproving a particular plugin if you really miss one of that
metadata.

Moreover, plugins are GPL licenced, hence the source code should be shared 
when a plugin is distributed. Python is a script language, but still there are 
some source which should not go into the final plugin package (.ui files 
typically). 
Therefore, a plugin _must_ have a full source code available somewhere, and a 
repository is a logical place for this.

Globally it is about improving the global quality of the software, and these 
steps are the basics a plugin developer should provide.

This is not always the case, I know at least one plugin without ui files.

But the question is not if a plugin generally needs a
repository/tracker, of course it does.

The question is if a plugin can be uploaded in the official plugins
repository even if it misses a repository/tracker. There is some
automatic validation in place and automatic rules do not admit
exceptions.

Hi,

Well, I did follow these guidelines (which proved successful earlier 
on), but I recently get these error messages which have to do with the 
expiration of the public key. I have the same issue in Linux Mint Qiana 
as well.

Hopefully someone can take a closer look.

Hi there,

I see that the public key mentioned on the website 
(http://downloads.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu) 
has expired.

I use Ubuntu Precise and was successful before to use the qgis 
repository ( deb http://qgis.org/debian precise main). But now I get an 
error when updating my package list against the qgis.org repo for ubuntu 
precise.

My current QGIS is at 2.4.0 and this is an extract from the output 
(Dutch) from the 'apt-key list' command, from which it seems that the 
key has expired since 18 August:

pub   1024R/47765B75 2013-08-18 [verlopen: 2014-08-18]
uid                  Quantum GIS Archive Automatic Signing Key (2013) 
<qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>

Obviously, reinstalling the same key did not help.

Hopefully somebody can handle this!

The key mentioned on
http://downloads.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu is DD45F6C3
not 47765B75 - and that was already the case when you posted, although not
long.

There is an option to show the feature form and a checkbox "Auto open 
form" , yes. It's not easy to understand that checking that will open 
the feature form for single features.

If I set the checkbox, I have no chance to get the identify result form 
back if my layers contain only single features.

The old option method looked somewhat more logical to me. Any chance to 
get it back? It would not harm anybody, and the docs are correct again.

If you click the "Help button" of the identify form, it also tells me 
about the old options.

Hi Luigi

I have no problems saving layer style and a .ui to spatialite DB. I can
also load the style back from SL. But I can not find how to load the ui
form.

I am not sure if it is just me who can not find this hidden feature or if
it is actually missing. Can someone please confirm this and I will create a
bug report.

Josef

Yes but there are always going to be exceptions to this and I dont
believe we should make having these items a sticking point e.g.:

* some one in a corporate environment can't easily make a website for
the plugin they write
* Someone in a coprporate environment works in a repo behind a firewall
* a bug tracker is behind a corporate firewall

As Ale says, its not that we should encourage people not to have these
things, but we should not penalise them for it unduly if they don't.

I think there are other things that would be more interesting to
mandate e.g.:

* standardised documentation
* HIG compliance
* Including a license file

etc.

I would still like to see us reach a point where we have 'best of
breed', 'sanctioned' plugins, and the 'wild west' differentiated for
the users.

Regards

Tim

Since I'm not a contributor to the main project, just some plugins, I'm not
sure my voice will count for much but I think Tim hits on an important
point.

As as a developer of plugins for my company, I have created repos and bug
trackers for the plugins I created because I was asked to but they are not
regularly used, watched or maintained. If anything they are worse than none
at all.

I understand the interest in standard documentation, but even that is often
less than ideal from a companies perspective. Speaking generally companies
provide plugins for two reasons. First, they are something the company
needs and is willing to share with others. Second, they are useful tools
for the company's clients to use with the companies commercial tools or
services. In both cases plugins are, to some extent, a means to promote the
company so hosting documentation on the company site is more valuable to
the company then distributing all of it with the plugin.

I would encourage QGIS developers to try to keep balanced requirements to
ensure that corporate, academic and volunteer contributors and users can
all benefit.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Identify results form vs feature form

Hi,

The reason I moved the option is because it wasn't really a "option" in the
first place. Something like that doesn't belong in the options dialog as it
can be changed more then once during a session, and if you are having to
visit the options dialog for that then it's in the wrong place. Anything
found in Settings -> Options should not have to be changed a lot, set once
and forget. The old method was also inconsistent, sometimes you might not
want the feature form to open for a single feature but you got it
regardless unless you did the Settings -> Options dance to change it for a
single use case.

I agree that getting the identify results dock back is not the best,
however moving the settings back to Options is not the solution.  I am
thinking a Open Result Pane button next to the identity map tool button.

The recommend workflow is to leave the identify result dock open, put it in
a tab if you need, and control the settings for identity from there.   They
will persist between sessions just like the last settings.  The identify
result dock will always show the current results regardless of if the
feature form is shown or not.   This is to make it more consistent from a
users point of view as the tool always does the same action regardless,
showing the results.  Opening the feature form is a bonus on top of the
standard function not in replace of.

It was never about hiding the options. In fact quite the opposite.  Moving
them to the dock now give you more live control on a need by need basis
rather then Settings -> Options...dance if you need to change it for a
session.

Regards,
Nathan

Strange. There is a repository tag:

But it does not show in the plugin repo.

Hi Martin,

This sounds quite exciting!
Thanks a lot for this large refactoring!

I can't tell much for the code part. However, I have a few remarks from 
testing:

* Removing a symbol in the rule based symbology that was used as a group 
without any symbol does not removie it from the legend.
e.g.
Layer
|
---- scale group without symbol
   |
   ------- symbol xxx

If I move "symbol xxx" to the top level and delete the scale group, it's 
not removed from the legend.


* In the case of a rule based renderer has a single top level rule, I 
would suggest that this top rule is not shown as a symbol but directly 
at the layer level (similarly to a single symbol layer).
An example of such config:


and in the legend:

?

I would propose that "r?seau" symbol label is hidden, and its symbol is 
shown on the layer level directly.


* Also would it be too complicated to reproduce the rule-based hierarchy 
in the legend as a tree? Is it out of scope?


Thanks again for this.
I am looking forward to further testing in master :)

Best wishes,

Denis

That means the server instead of returning the GetCapabilities response
redirected to the same url that the GetCapabilities request already used.  So
chances are that will happen again and again...

If you will find the pattern how to reproduce it, feel free to report
an issue - glad to hear the bug is not caused by the refactoring
though :-)  (according to your latter mail)

Yes this is still an issue. The legend icon in the layer tree has more
problems than just fixed maximum symbol size. It also ignores the fact
that some symbols may have size specified in map units and assumes
that one map unit == one millimeter. Moreover such legend entries
should be probably updated every time that map scale changes (which
may have a negative performance impact) or at least once upon a time.
But thanks to the refactoring it should be easier to address the
issue. In map composer legend, rendering of the legend is now done
correctly and the code for rendering of symbol icons for both layer
tree and composer (and WMS!) is now just in one class
(QgsSymbolV2LegendNode).

For a strategy with big symbols I would suggest (for a future implementation):
- have a default symbol icon size (as of now)
- allow symbol icons to become bigger up to some maximum icon size
- symbols bigger than maximum size would be scaled with a small note
underneath how much they are scaled (e.g. "1:5")

Cheers
Martin

Well, it means that we desparately need people to invest some time to
update the documentation. Documentation needs work.
The Help button text is called 'context-help' and is currently a
separate system, which we hope to make use of the normal docs too.

Currently the docs are not yet updated for 2.4. Latests 'stable' docs
are actually for 2.2.

We need to organize a documenation-update team again, so hopefully we
can branch a 2.6 docs just after releasing 2.6

Anybody volunteering? Please write to the 'QGIS-community' list.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Agreed. I think this invitation should be broadcast more widely, as it does not
properly belong to devs (only|mainly).
I think users could contribute.

Creating a public repo an bugtracker on GitHub takes 3 minuts at most. I do not see
this as an heavy requirement.
Having them lessen the burden on a company, it does not increase it, as it allow more
people to cooperate.

That would be possible, it would require some adjustments though. Currently
symbol's icon is shown at the layer level only if these two conditions are
met:
- there is only one legend node for layer
- the legend node has property "embedded in parent" set to true


* Also would it be too complicated to reproduce the rule-based hierarchy in

The legend nodes are intentionally kept in a list. Another tree structure
just for legend nodes would make things much more complex and the
rule-based renderer is probably the only case where it would have some
added value. In the future, if we support item delegates for legend nodes,
we could maybe achieve some pseudo-tree behaviour for rule-based renderer.
But currently that's out of scope...

Hi J?rgen

Is this (qgis) application specific or can this behaviour also reproduced by simply refreshing the browser? (since it never happens in the browser).

AFAIK the links are not updated when uploading modified metadata, and should be
edited by hand (am I correct?).

No, IIRC it should be overwritten when a new version is uploaded.

Hand editing is always possible but metadata.txt is not synced.

Hi Martin

Thanks for your efforts to unify the legends. Few comments from my side:

- API break: is there a list of breaks inside the 2.x series? I recently 
came accross one in the provider API, and it would be good to provide 
some guidance for people porting code to newer versions. Regarding 'not 
used according to plugin analysis tool': most plugins are probably not 
in the plugin repo.

- For the legend graphics options layertitlespace and layerfontcolor, it 
says 'TODO'.

- qgswmsserver.cpp:671 : it seems a bit strange to iterate over all 
nodes to set the property. Can this be done inside some legend class 
(maybe legend renderer)?

Regards,
Marco

QGIS browser?  I'd expect it to behave the same.  Any other application might
just follow the redirection and run the same request again and hope for the
best.

Maybe the server does actually respond differently to a later request (which
QGIS doesn't expect), otherwise the client might just stop requesting after a
number of redirections or end up in an endless loop retrying the same request
again and again.

Hi Stefan,

is it your own server? I've also seen related messages with a apache
server with faulty Redirect or Rewrite rules (if I'm correct, Chrome
browser was telling me more then Firefox, if it was wrong).

If someone wants to have a closed environment for their plugin / application 
development based on QGIS, then they can setup a closed plugin repository.

We are talking about enforcing rules on the official QGIS plugin repository, not 
the other ones, aren't we ?

Free software is about open development, not only open licence. We enforce 
the licence, but it is from my point of view not enough to ensure a piece of 
code is called free software.

Both points are not mutually exclusive (nor exhaustive).

One of the question I often hear is "what are the best QGIS plugins ?". I 
would like to be able to answer this question with "Official QGIS repository are 
all good".
Or maybe we want a QGIS official plugin repository, and a "staging" or 
"contrib" one, with different levels of rules and quality ?

No, not my own server. Unfortunately some protected one. So I'm trying to figure out how to report to the service provider.

Hi J?rgen

Thanks. I did not mean QGIS browser but a "normal" browser like Firefox etc. I never get an error message when I request GetCapabilities from Firefox/Chrome etc. So I thougt it could be some Qt-http-classes thing.

Hi,

I have to say that I actually dislike the "new" identify docking thingy
(sorry Nathan), it just feels strange to me. Even hidden as a tab it steals
lots of space in smaller screens (An option in settings to choose docking
it or not would make my day! :-p)

But I do agree that toggling between Open feature form mode and identify
tool only mode is not optimal.

I also agree that the feature form is a totally diferent funcionality, and
accessing it do need some love.Therefore was planning on working on a
plugin to add a button to the toolbar to directly open a selected feature's
form. Additionally, if more than one feature is selected, the feature form
would show all features equal values and empty the rest of the fields.
Updating one of the fields will change it across all features, while
keeping the field empty will preserve original values. A popup message
should show up to warn the user that several features attributes will be
updated.

Do you think this would be useful?

I'm having problems with the current openFeatureForm () implementation
tho... as I have referred in this mailing list before [0]
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Struggling-with-iface-openFeatureForm-tt5157574.html>.
And I have now created a bug report [1] <https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11099>
of it as this would be crucial for the plugin.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

I also agree this new dock wasn't the best way to deal with results. I 
think it is true for users who are 99% dedicated to dealing with vector

I am currently working on improving the Layer Selection mode in the 
identify map tool. The idea is to introduce a feature level, so you can 
always open the result in a feature form. You will also be able to open 
the attribute table with a filter on the identified features from a same 
layer. Also, you'll have access to map layer actions and so on.

This identify map tool would be a good client for a QEP ;)

Cheers,

Denis

Yes, but it should be in core. We have been thinking of this feature for
a while and I am hoping to find the time/funds to implement this.

There are two different cases to handle multiple selection IMO:

 * Multi Edit: what you describe, edit attributes of multiple features
at once
 * Attribute table (form view) with a filter applied to inspect the
selected elements only, but individually.

Any reason you aren't simply dragging it out of the dock to put it in
floating window mode when you need to?

I have the time (kind of..), but not the C++ knowledge or the funds to buy
it, hence the python (temporary) solution,.

The second case already works well, and the new field calculator bar really
speeds things up, but you still need to be changing the fields one by one.
The first case also has the benefit of making use of the edit widgets.

Like Denis said, if you are doing lots of editing, you need things to be
done fast and need windows out of your way. Putting identify in window mode
make the Open feature Form hard to use, since two windows will open
(Identity and Feature Form) that will block the vision to the map canvas.
The user, after editing the feature attributes must press ok in the feature
form and close or drag the identify windows away.

Thinking about it, this might not be a identify tool problem at all. And
the docking behavior might actually be the best to keep. When editing lots
of features attributes, you want the feature form, not the Identify
results, that's why I think the best solution would be to separate the
(fast) access to feature form from the identify tool. (keeping the right
click open feature form).

I agree.  The main issue I see here is not the identify tool, although I
have issue with the widget itself but that is another topic.  The issue for
me is the tool does two jobs (both not very well). Like you said we need to
split attribute editing, and attribute info, both are not the same thing
and should be treated differently.   If it was me doing it right now, I
would add a "Open Feature Form button" that takes the selection and opens
the form for the first one, with next and back buttons to move though.

Personally I'm not sure that another map tool solves the issue which is why
a action button is better IMO.  OR maybe we are a context menu to the
canvas for faster actions after a select. This means you still have a
button in the toolbar but you can have quick access via right click. There
are other options to make this faster as well.

Yes, figure out why qgis_core doesn't build and that one will disappear.  It
would have been better to quote the first error and not just the last - most of
the errors are probably just produced because qgis_core failed to build.

Hi,

Thanks for this solution. Is there a place where all the configuration
options are listed and explained ?

* QGIS Server Environment variables like :
QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH
I am sure there are some more.

* Qgis configuration file variables to put in the .ini , like
[svg]
searchPathsForSVG=/path/to/svg1|/path/to/svg2

I searched the documentation with "configuration" key, and had a look at
[1] but could not find it.

[1]
http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_server_support.html?highlight=server

Thanks in advance
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing causes major slowness at QGIS startup
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1zZYBMrC0jFmNUjUaw8tsfFn-_eXdULkiofWyFZwWyow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

in our organization with over 1,000 windows machines, we install QGIS
on a windows samba share so it can be launched via a desktop shortcut.

We discovered that the processing python plugin is the slowest plugin
to load. The QGIS base install contains 5 python plugins (fTools,
metaSearch, gdalTools, db_manager and processing) and we calculated on
a windows 7 pc these times:

QGIS with processing plugin
time from "loading python plugins" to GUI screen -> 31 seconds (to
load all 5 plugins)

QGIS without processing plugin
time from "loading python plugins" to GUI screen -> 15 seconds (over 50% gain)

Investigating the processing plugin, it seems that it loads all the
configs in the init() code, not in the initGUI() as should be
correctly.

Note that this slowness will be visible for everyone that has this
plugin DISABLED in the plugin list, because the initialization code is
in init(), so this slowness is involving all.

Hi, 
interesting issue. 
More generaly, startup speed starts to be an issue here, and plugins take
more than half the time of global startup. 

Do we have tips for plugin authors to speed up python loading? 
Do we have already investigate all startup bottlenecks ? 

Cheers
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Caching GetProjectSettings with Qgis server
Message-ID: <CAPtRYtDX-jB7Ygd-ghMqt7QMEV0A+18o_Ljy2ii339dZ98MV0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to have more information regarding Qgis server caching certain
requests and how to control that. I didn't find any documentation regarding
this, so I ask.

Example:
On my environment (ubuntu 12.04, apache 2.2.22, qgis 2.4) I do
GetProjectSettings request on certain project. If I restart Apache or save
the project the request is not cached (I assume) and it takes from 20 - 65
seconds. In order to avoid Server Error after 40second I added this line to
Apache configuration

FcgidIOTimeout 80

So, after this long request, next same request is immediately so it must be
cached, right? I tested with different clients and must be on server. But I
do not control this, because after unknown amount of time the cache is
removed.

Can anyone explain this and should I explore basic Apache caching tehniques
like this:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/caching.html

Right now I don't have any caching modules enabled in Apache.

Another question is why is it taking so long, but I will ask that extra.

thanks

Uros

Hi Uros,

I might be wrong but I think that request are not cached in the
standard sense, the startup delay is due to the application startup
time ant to the first time parsing of the project file that also needs
to instanciate many objects.

What is cached are project configurations (parsed project files) for
the available services, layers, getcapabilities and getprojectsettings
requests, but the caches are invalidate whenever the project file
changes on disk, for instance see:

https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgsconfigcache.cpp#L36

 The end of the story is that there at the first request there is the
application startup time + the configuration parsing for the
particular service and project tuple, the next requests for the same
service and project is considerably faster because it doesn't have to
start the application nor to parse the project file and instanciate
all the stuff.

Of course, all this goodies come only with FCGI, if you run the server
in CGI mode, then all requests are treated as the first one.

Hi Michael,

I think such details are currently missing in documentation. If you are
into it now, can you please write something about it and do a pull
request (or just sent some text to the community list and the place
where you want to put it)?

FYI we also resurrected the index pages of documentation:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/genindex.html

would be nice if these kind of env/conf vars would show up there.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I am indeed trying to gather some info about QGIS Server (looking at the
source code), especially on tuning performance and setting environmnent
variables. I will propose a PR in the documentation repository soon, as a
start for developping the QGIS Server doc part. I will probably start small
as a basis then complete it whenever I find time and information.

Thanks for the revival of the genindex.html, it is indeed very handy.

Best wishes,
Michael

Just after answering to Richards' email, I saw someone already added some
text about the QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_server_support.html?highlight=qgis_options_path

QGIS community is really moving fast !

Yes. Another practical example - in the plugin builder you have the dialog
that asks you all about your plugin, including the optional items. But when
you first start to build a plugin you probably don't already have a
website, repo etc. So we can't easily extract these data at the start of
the plugin building process. When it comes time to publishing the plugin we
don't really have a mechanism to retroactively ask for the missing info. So
the workflow is a bit awkward.

Yeah me too! Please don't misunderstand me in the discussion - I agree with
your position about the desirability of having metadata, bug tracker etc. I
just don't consider it a show stopper if for one or other reason the
developer does not have one of these fields populated. That said if the
rest of the interest people wanted to make these feels mandatory I won't
argue that enthusiastically against it :-P

Yes I would like to see us get there in the end. We actually discussed it a
bit in Vienna but I think we don't have the resources to put this into
place yet.

Hi,

I know this was already discused, but I still cannot enable logging for
qgis server. My configuration is this:

-Ubuntu 12.04
-Apache 2.22
-Qgis 2.4 (standard install)

I added this line to apache configuration:

SetEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /var/log/qgislog.txt

Nothing happens, I also manualy created empty file and set chown as
wwwdata, but still nothing is logged.

Am i missing something? Any ideas?

Thanks

I am not aware of such list - but it is the right time to start one.
Do you have any preferences where to put it - doxygen page / wiki page
/ qgis-documentation repo / somewhere else?

Something to be addressed - these features are not supported out of
the box by QgsLegendRenderer. Btw. are these custom options documented
/ used anywhere?

This looks OK to me - I don't think we do not need another mechanism
to skip legend node labels... and other classes like legend renderer
are not supposed to alter the input model. Moreover this functionality
is special to WMS and it's just two lines of code, so I did not feel a
need to generalize it somehow.

Martin

Right. If we remove all of those plugin, QGIS is much faster to start.

Yes, they should move the big code from init() to initGUI().

They should remember that the code in init() is ALWAYS executed, even
with that plugin "disabled" from the list.

It should also be possible to add some timing stats to the plugin loading
code from the QGIS side to log which plugins are taking time to load.

Actually since the adoption of metadata.txt for plugin metadata it is
not necessary for QGIS to load all python plugins on start up. I have
a suspicion that it is the plugin installer component which tries to
load them while QGIS is being started (just to check whether they load
correctly). Such check is IMHO not necessary and its removal would
make the loading time shorter.

If you are on apache and mod_fcgid you'd better try with

I have seen plugins occasionally getting broken: are you suggesting to do the check
only on activating them (+ at install time of course)?
All the best.

It is not a real showstopper anyway: any fake url (or a generic one) will do (yes, it
happened).

No. As Martin Dobian suggested, when QGIS is loading, only the
"metadata.txt" file of each plugin should be read without executing
the Init() function of *every* (enabled and not enabled) plugin.

I would also prefer to keep the entry barrier low.

I.e. if a hobby-programmer does not add these fields to his plugin but 
will happily make (the missing bits) of the source code available on 
request (GPL states on request IIRC) it should be possible for him to 
just upload the plugin, but get warned that he could make people a lot 
more happier if he would set these fields. I can imagine people 
struggle with git, do bugtracking by email or on an internal tracker, 
don't have a homepage... But still make good plugins which could 
eventually evolve into projects with all these parts included. There 
are a lot of other things people can fail at. And just make these 
things hard requirement because they are easy to check does not feel 
right for me.

I would also vote for the solution of having different repos ( 
recommended, bood, creepy )

Hello Mathias,

We already have the "experimental" flag for not production-ready
plugins, do we really need different repos?

Hi all,

+1

I suppose the plugin approver should check if all the sources are 
available in the source (if no code repository is available), e.g. ui 
files. It would be important for those who would make a fork of a (already 
not supported) plugin.
A minimal documentation in the source may be obligatory.

It can be done inside initGUI() function.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] line renderer and composition mode
Message-ID: <20140827125314.GA22610@norbit.de>

Hi,

any objections to have the line symbol layer render in composition mode
"source"?

I have a layer with multiple levels of administrative boundaries, where higher
level boundaries (eg. state) lie over lower level boundaries (county). Lower
level boundaries should not be visible if there is a higher level boundary on
top of them.  The styles are dash-dotted - so the lines don't fully cover the
lines below.

I could solve that by putting a white line on the bottom of the symbol, but
that would also mean that layers below are covered, that I still would like
see.

Rendering the line in "source" composition would allow to have a fully
transparent line symbol layers on the bottom of the symbol that would overwrite
the already rendered lines on that layer with transparency.

Is that already possible in a different way (without resorting to multiple
vector layers) to achieve the same?   Or does it introduce some problem that I
didn't think of?   It could still be optional...

Having this mode would be useful but imho it should not be the default
mode and it should definitely not be the only mode. I can think of
many cases where I wanted to have multiple lines drawn over each other
without the "source" effect you describe. Couldn't it just be another
feature blending mode?

Best wishes,
Anita

Your solution is not always good.

You should could use the level symbols to give what symbol won in overlap.

I'm already using symbol levels.  Is there a way to have transparency in higher
levels remove earlier rendered stuff on lower levels?

Level 2 - .. -
Level 1 -.-.-.

Should look like

        - .. -

if there are level 1 & 2 boundaries on top of each other and not like

        -...--

Still the transparent bits should not cover (vector/raster) layers below.
Putting a fully transparent line on the bottom of each level and rendering it
in source composition mode would achieve that (ie. the transparent bits of the
higher level would make everything rendered in lower levels transparent again
instead of leaving it as is).

Yes.
You can apply the transparency on color single.

Hi. Just to understand the questione.

If you put
Level2 = 2
Level1 = 1

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Embedded layers/groups issues : relative path
 become absolute when saving the project
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO41Qpamqzpt=3EKvxLPJAFGPJgVQ5U0FTpkFvRhgk9gyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I opened an issue about it [1]. Please share some feedback, and assign to
the proper developper. This bug is nasty in the way it prevents users from
using embedded layers in QGIS Server (or they have to modify the project
each tiem after saving it to remove absolute paths )

[1] http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11109

Best wishes,

Michael

Hi,

FYI - here is an explanation of the different composition modes:
http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq17-compositionmodes.html

These are different from blend modes and I think it would be very
useful if they could be exposed to the user. But it would have to be
done on a symbol level and not on the layer level. Or at least as an
option to choose from.

On a similar issue it would be nice if the background (rectangle or
stronger stroke) of a text can hide paint in other layers - with the
goal to make better readable text labels - in german language we call
that a "Textfreistellung" - I don't know the correct english term,
sorry. Hugo Mercier from Oslandia already looked into the issue a bit
and prepared a proposal. This may be solved with the composition modes
as well.

So I would definitely like to see the exposure of the different
composition modes exposed to the user on a symbol level level.

Thanks for bringing up the issue,
Andreas

Agreed with Anita. We could just add 'source' feature blending mode to
the list. Just tried the styling as described by J?rgen and then run
this in python console:
>>> iface.activeLayer().setFeatureBlendMode(QPainter.CompositionMode_Source)

And it worked as expected - transparent line from "upper" symbol
removed the previously painted dashed line.

Interesting topic - in the past I've looked into adding these
additional composition modes, but could never get them working nicely.
The main issue is that they will apply to everything drawn below them,
including the canvas background, underlying layers, etc -- this is
almost certainly not what anyone wants! For these to be useful we'd
need a way of limiting their scope. There's more details and a
proposed solution here:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Vienna-hackfest-QGIS-Legend-discussion-tp5131063p5131082.html

> >>> iface.activeLayer().setFeatureBlendMode(QPainter.CompositionMode_Source)

I think this will have unintended side effects. It may look ok in the
canvas (since layers are rendered to cache images, effectively
limiting the scope of the "source" effect), but will probably look
quite different when rendered direct to an image or via the composer.

Do you mean "smart halos"/"variable depth masking"? (see
http://mapnik.org/news/2012/04/20/smart-halos/ or
http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00s50000002v000000.htm
)

If so, that's great news that this is being looked in to. It's been on
my todo/wishlist for a while now. Here's my thoughts on how this could
work:

1. within the label settings, buffer tab, add an option for "smart
buffer", which allows selecting a layer those currently included in
the map's legend tree.
2. when rendering, a "snapshot" of the map is taken when the layers up
to and including this selected "smart buffer" layer have been
rendered. Eg, if the project has layers "land", "water", "regions",
"streets", "cities", and the "regions" layer is selected for the smart
buffer, then the snapshot is taken after land, water and regions have
been rendered.
3. When the labels are rendered, the buffers for the labels are drawn
onto the snapshot using the "destination in" composition mode. This
would result the snapshot layer being clipped for all areas outside of
the text buffers.
4. Draw the resultant clipped snapshot layer on the map, then render
the text on top of it.

This would result in a really flexible approach. Since it's all done
"on-the-fly", there's no need for premade raster layers as is required
in ArcGIS, or for multiple stacked layers in your project to achieve
this effect. Is this the kind of approach Oslandia is taking? (Sounds
like a good candidate for a QEP!)

Me too! Again, symbol level composition modes and
whole-of-symbol-level transparency effects have long been on my
todo/wishlist.

It might be possible with Spatialite, Postgis or GRASS layers.

Yeah it is possible.. But instead of converting feature class to shapefile and executing topology is time consuming. Is it possible to create a plugin for that? If so please help me..

What place do you recommend then? Seems to me there is no developer

That leaves doxygen.   Why not document API breakages where the API is
documented?  Sounds like the best fit ;)

It's fine to put it into doxygen. Can it also be available as a 
summarized list there (so not only as a comment at the method level)?

That's fine, until those deprecated methods are removed. Then the api break

Alessandro,

Thanks for answering, yes I have fcgid enabled and I meant configuration
stuff especially getprojectsetting request which is taking very long on
certain project. So that is cached, in memory I assume?

Are there any settings, I would to keep the cache unless I saved the
project or restart server, which are obvious cases to remove cache. From
the code example I see that if the project is changed it is removed from
cache, I don't see any other cases.

Can I use apache cache modules to save the cache to disk?

How are anyone dealing with this on production servers?

regards,
Uros

Hi,

Thanks Alessandro,  this is working now. I was trying only with SetEnv. I
also had to set QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL, otherwise the file was empty. So
this is my setting now which is working (Apache+Fcgid):

FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE /var/tmp/qgislog.txt
FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0

LogLevel 0 means that everything is logged, for debugging only.

Is someone working on documentation? This could be included for others.

regards,
Uros

I don't see anymore those actions in legend contextual menu, could we
re-enable them?
Also, wouldn't be useful to have a "check all" and "uncheck all" actions?

I did not test the legend refactoring part II branch yet, so I don't

Now they still show up only if you click to empty area. I have
excluded it from the ordinary context menu because it is getting
really long for layers - and expand/collapse all items are not really
contextual actions anyway. I think we could have a small toolbar like
in browser dock widget and have those actions there (either directly
or in "advanced" menu) - together with actions like "new group".

> Also, wouldn't be useful to have a "check all" and "uncheck all" actions?

We already have such thing in Layer menu > Show / Hide All Layers.

The second part of legend refactoring contains no changes in this area.

The idea is to have an explicit list (a doxygen page) with the
incompatible changes - so nothing should get lost if stuff it removed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QEP1 - Proposal for QEP
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-7YoRb-PS2nqSVq-8Z-on5JvN00GjxAPhieGH0N-2q_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

So I think all (most) agree that the QEP idea is good for the future of the
project.  So in order to move this forward Richard has created a new github
repo for us to store the QEPs.  The plan is to use a git repo to store the
QEPs and new QEPs MUST be added via a pull request.    The pull request
will allow discussion around the QEP until voting stage, then once it's
committed into the repository it is accepted.   So the short hand of that
is, if it in pull request state, it's in draft/review stage.   Using the
pull requests will allow for comments on the sections inside the QEP and
allow tracking of commits made while in draft/review.

In order to kick this off I have created the first QEP which is a proposal
for using QEPs. How meta is that! QEP 1 should include the details on how
future QEPs will work.

You can find the first pull request here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/1.  This QEP is
still in draft mode and I'm happy to take feedback on the sections so we
can build it out how we need. Please leave comments on the pull request.

You will notice that I have created two types of QEPs, process and
standard.  Standard is application focused and will be managed by a group
of developers. Process QEPs are related to how we do the other stuff in the
project and are managed by the PSC.  I got this idea from PEPs which have
three types but I don't think we will need to go to that level.

Regards,
Nathan

In order to work, it needs cx_Oracle (development done with latest 
version 5.1.3). See the README.md for further details. It's a DBA-API 
2.0 implementation for Oracle and this eased development a lot by not 
dealing with low-level Oracle Database connections problems.

I have started from the postgis code of DBManager and tried to implement 
all of its features under Oracle. Some tasks can't been done under 
Oracle like renaming a schema or changing the schema of a table, etc. 
 From what I have tested so far, eveything is working but you can expect 
bugs just because my test environment is quite restrictive (Oracle 10g, 
Spatial 12, no DBA rights, no raster data).

I am not a professionnal Python developper nor an Oracle DBA but I've 
tested the plugin on a production environment with good results. I think 
it needs code and internal queries review.

My main objective is to have this code (and its modifications) 
incorporated in the official QGis repository. One of the prerequisites 
is to have cx_Oracle Python library incorporated in the official QGis 
build. But I don't know how to achieve this and I think it is a little 
bit complicated, especially for GNU/Linux distros (at least there is 
already an Oracle SDK incorporated into QGis repository).

Other prerequisite will be, of course, the code quality. Feel free to 
report bugs in the Github issues tool of the repository. You can also 
send me patches.

Best regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QEP: QGIS Mapserver Python Plugins
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672zKzi65qBHGpLzOQ6t4uowdpd1L66XQ85h23XuqvBXEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

as anticipated to some of you during the last HF, I've started to add
Python plugins support for the server side.

The rationale behind server plugins is doublefold: first they could
provide additional services without the need to touch the C++
codebase, second they allow for GUI-based configuration since the
server plugins are not separated from the desktop plugins (of course
the environment and permissions should be carefully configured to
allow information sharing from the desktop user to the webserver user
).

I've already coded a first working implementation and a few
proof-of-concept plugins.

The current implementation is based on the following ideas:

QGIS Python plugins can have additional metatags to specify what
SERVICE and REQUEST they expose, for example:

service=HELLO
methods=GetCapabilities,GetOutput,RemoteConsole

This plugin will respond to calls like
/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=HELLO&REQUEST=RemoteConsole


The current implementation is pretty simple and CGI-style, whatever
the plugin prints to sdtout is captured and sent back to the client,
the return value from the method is the (optional) content type.

I would like to discuss this ideas during the next HF (or sooner), in
particular:

* I'm not happy with the current request handling and I think we need
a mehod to pass cached parsed project instances to the plugins when
needed and a better handling of HTTP headers
* I 'd like to see signals/slots implementation instead of static
function calls, but maybe it's just syntactic sugar
* from the python side, we don't have an iface to pass to the plugins,
so I'm currently stuck to @staticmethod


The code is in a branch:
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/tree/serverplugins

HelloServer demo plugin:
https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-helloserver
It is a test plugin and it provides a remote console (web shell),
insanely insecure DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!! and arbitrary python code
execution configurable through the QGIS desktop plugin GUI.

Here is a short demo of the HelloServer plugin:

Have fun !!

no problem to scroll down a lot of layers to find an empty area :)
but couldn't we think to some submenu action here?
I think it is useful to add they in context menu for groups only as well.

yeah, I know, sorry badly explained, I was referring to move them in
the context (sub)menu as well.
Having all in legend should be helpful to the end user imo.

I am away until Sept 5th, but will work on that once i am back. Didn't know
about the init() and initGUI() separation, so thanks for the info.

A large part of the time it takes to start Processing is probably spent in
reading the description files for SAGA, GRASS and OTB algorithms, so i will
try to find a way of making that faster, or avoiding it if not needed at
first

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjN=4+DvSkDfZiu2VhXVbr+u=o2Ziu_1FyhG-5cgy7xeg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm struggling to understand the rationale behind some logic in
QgsRubberBand::addPoint. At line 163
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsrubberband.cpp#L163),
if a new geometry index is required then it is added and the specified
point added to this new geometry index.

That's fair enough, but the very next code block will then re-add that
same point to the new index. The result is that the first point will
always be added TWICE to the rubber band.

Is this deliberate? Or a bug in the code?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

IIR the rubber band adds two points because the second one will be used 
to track the mouse moves.

Basically addPoint is synonym of add point to line. It shall not be used 
if you want to have single points.

Cheers,

Denis

This looks like the first real case for an RFC! I'm quite sceptical adding 
Python to QGIS server. In my opinion this should be discussed thoroughly first.

Hello Pirmin,

thanks for the feedback!!!  At least this is the start of a discussion
:) I knew from previous conversations with some of you that adding
python plugins to the server was not at the top of the priority list
and
I added QEP (RFC) in the original subject because I know this topic
must be discussed: I'm not going to do a PR anytime soon, and my
implementation is more like an hack to see how far can I go with this
idea, but, so far, it seems quite promising.

Everybody knows how has been important to have Python plugins on the
desktop side, coding in Python is 5 to 10 times faster than building
C++ code and moreover the lower barrier to start being productive will
bring a lot of new functionalities from a larger pool of developers.

Last but not least, python plugins do not need to pass the
PR/pull/build/relase cycle that affect the C++ core, which adds a
considerable delay to bug fixes and new features.

That said, I would really like to hear more from you all about the
reasons to be against this idea.

I guess the main goal is to avoid that the adopt of python on server
could slow it.

Infact , the main difference from a desktop and a server is that the
first is serving only one perosn and this mean that the user could
wait also for a work for himself.
Instead a server is used from many users and every of them dont like
to wait too much.

So the preferrable is if the python server solution sill be optional.
So who don't need it could to not compile it.

Sincerelly I don t see any advantage in the python server side inside the qgis.

The only scenario I could admit is for a rapid prototype of some
solution, but afer, this
for an usage in a production environment the python solution should be
transform in a C/C++ solution to have the sufficient
execution rapidity.

Hi Andrea,
In the first case I imagine (executing Processing modules or models as WPS services),
the overhead will be minimal, as all the heavy computation is run by the appropriate
backend.
All the best.

Sure it should be optional, but even when compiled, to avoid the
slowdown it's enough to don't use any plugin, the current
implementation is like a 404 handler: when there is at least one
python plugin installed and there is is no match with the SERVICE
string, then, if a plugin declares that service, it's executed.
This check comes at the end of the loop after all other options have failed.

If the request contains WMS, WCS or WFS then the plugin code is not
even reached, if there aren't any server plugins installed then the
plugin code is never reached.

No slowdown if you don't use the plugins.

Well, just a small slowdown when FCGI app starts the first time but
IMHO is less than noticeable.


Just to make it clear: nobody forces you to use python plugins!

I just like that we now have the possibility to use them, if (and only
if) we want.

Hi Alessandro

Thanks for this interesting input. I'm happy to look at it in detail, 
but need a bit of time to review it and think about it thoroughly. Also 
I'd like to do some testing (e.g. run some of my internal server 
benchmarks here).

As a fery first 2c: Python on the server can open some interesting 
options (expression functions in python, custom renderers, ...). Of 
course it needs the possibility to turn python off for server.

Regards,
Marco

Thank you Marco,

I will be happy to hear about your testing results and I highly
appreciate all advice that you can give me!
I'm sure that there are many improvements that can be made to my
hack-ish proof-of-concept implementation.

A quick question: python plugins only add an #include and two lines of
code in qgis_map_serv.cpp, a #ifdef SERVERPLUGINS block should be
enough to disable them completely, where should I add that option to
let cmake know about it?

Hi Pirmin,

I recently spend some time exploring the server side expecially QWC - or other
options.  If I didn't know before, I'd now know why it's called "web".
Frameworks over frameworks in countless languages.    Some frameworks are
are quite similar, some are clones or heavily inspired by others, just
implementend in a different languages.   You can't explore them all, but you
can choose without exploring either.  Really frustrating.

News to me was that javascript is apparently also heavily used on the server
side based on node.js.  So more clones and alternatives on the server side to
choose from.

And we have javascript in Qt.  There's even a generator that builds Qt bindings
for javascript.  If that could also be done for QGIS bindings, we could have
plugins in javascript.   And those could work on desktop, server and android.

But that's just an idea that striked me - exploring it would have sidetracked
me even more, so I didn't.   Anyway - maybe good enough to share it.

No links.  I just tried to lookup qt bindings generator I mentioned and found a
qt binding generator for node.js instead - example on the frontpage a message
box - message box on the server side?  No, I'll stop here, no more exploration
for now. ;)

Hi Poalo,

How you can say that the overhead should be minimal.
?
:))

However surely best ifthe python on server is optional in compiling.
So if an user dont want it should remove it.

Because in that case Python does almost nothing, just passing the command to GDAL,
SAGA, GRASS, or whatever.

The startup will happen only the first time, unless you use CGI and not
FCGI.
Anyway, I proposed it a couple of years ago, but many told it was useless
for various reasons.
I think it could be useful if the plugin could affect WMS/WFS
request/response.
As an independent service I would rather use standalone python web code
(actually I do it this way, loading, parsing and caching the qgs project
and, in case, using headless QGIS APIs).

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G1P087HNBz8DVQYzFaAjffhPiiBL5POiTUubSoQ2wvoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working in a user function for expression builder to retrieve a x and y
values of a map extents in a print composer. The idea is to be able to use
it in label to label the map corners.

I know I can get all active (opened) composers by doing:

composers = iface.activeComposers()

It gives me a list of QgsComposerView, that I can select by the list index.
But how can I know the position of the QgsComposerView  in which I'm using
the function (by using it in a label)?

Many thanks,

Alexandre Neto

OS the python usable in a fcgi environment ?
This mean to load  and lock an instante of python forma every fcgi session
(almost 40-60 afaik) ?

You can make an entries in CMakeLists.txt and in 
cmake_templates/qgsconfig.h.in.
As an example, look at WITH_ORACLE and HAVE_ORACLE

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Performing buffering with script in PyQGIS
Message-ID: <12947918.882161409312615360.JavaMail.root@wmail51>

I wrote a script that performs the intersection of two layers:


-the first Layer-> layer1 represents the rivers


-the second Layer-> layer2, represents a set of circular dots
 distributed in a geographical area (at each point corresponds to a 
numeric value that exceeds a threshold value)


The result of the intersection should be highlighted with an operation of buffering.

The new geometry formed by the intersection + buffering should look like this:




Writing from console PyQGIS I have not encountered any errors.

To see the new geometry I added new layers to the previous ones (from "add vector layer") but I have not seen anything new.


This is the code of my script:


from qgis.core import *

from qgis.gui import *


canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()


layers = canvas.layers()

layer1 = canvas.layer(0)

layer2 = canvas.layer(3) 


from qgis.analysis import * 


overlayAnalyzer = QgsOverlayAnalyzer()

overlayAnalyzer.intersection(layer1, layer2, "/home/..../Scrivania/..../output.shp") 


layer3 = canvas.layer(0)


geometryanalyzer = QgsGeometryAnalyzer()

geometryanalyzer.buffer(layer3, "/home/..../Scrivania/..../buffer.shp", 500, False, False, -1)


Tips ?Also Demo &amp; Plugin example that I can study


I'm working with QGIS 2.4 on Win 7

Thanks in advance

Another question.
Is about the security of the environment.

I don't know too well the possibility of python in a qgis project.
But I fear that a qgis project could have some python code to start ad
startup of the qgis project.
This mean that the same code should be run in the server when it start
a qgis-server instance in fcgi ?

However the more important option is
to be able to choose to fully disable this option.

Thx,

A.

No.

Plugin in QGIS desktop application are not bound to projects but to
the user preferences (i.e. are installed in user directory and every
single user can enable/disable/install/remove plugins independently.

The same is for the server plugins, but because the server user
doesn't normally have a user directory, the path in which plugins are
stored is configurable by some environmen variables that points the
plugins path to a directory of your choice, this can be one of the
(trusted) user's directories or whatever else you choose.

This means that you could have different FGCI server instances (apache
virtual servers, for example) that use different sets of environment
options and point to different sets of installed plugins.

As always, it's administrator's choice how to configure the
environment and secure it (choose proper permissions etc).

Up to this point, there is nothing new or special for QGIS.

For python startup code, this is simply ignored by my implementation
but it would be possible to write a server plugin that parses the
project file and executes it (not that I see anything useful in doing
that).

Hi,

I tried to use this environnement variable as well, but I cannot set the
log file as /var/log/apache2/QGIS_Server.log , even if I chmod and chown it
to give Apache full rights :

ls -lh /var/log/apache2/QGIS_Server.log
-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data 0 ao?t  29 15:49
/var/log/apache2/QGIS_Server.log

If I set the file to /tmp/QGIS_Server.log with
FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE "/tmp/QGIS_Server.log"

then it works correctly and the log file is filled with data.

Any hint ?
Michael

Hi Alessandro

Thanks for this interesting input.
I'm happy to test it and to develope some use case.
I thought it's a good feature and can help to enhance QGIS-Server easily 
: WPS, WMTS, Table Join Service, WFS2 or other that OGC does not already 
know.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Hello Ren?-Luc,

I'm happy to hear that you are going to test it, please let me know how it goes!

Keep in mind that it's just a proof of concept, and yes, we need a RFC
or QEP: the current implementation is the simplest, less obtrusive and
quickest that I could think about.

For example, I would consider adding real signals attached to plugins
slots and cached parsed projects passed to plugin instances...

I'm currently working on a WPS server plugin that bridges Processing
and PyWPS (version 3.2.2 since the latest version 4 is tightly bound
to werkzeug), now fighting with parameters but it basically works.

Sure!

Better have an IRC/gmail talk.

I'll try to polish a bit the code and upload what I've done so far.

Currently the biggest problem seems that process.Popen on grass
commands hangs :(

But wait, there's more! :-) (Sorry, off-topic.)

Yesterday, I came across the Duktape [0] embeddable JavaScript engine,
recommended by the osgEarth project as a new dependency [1].

It has a very small footprint and simple implementation. Not sure how that
would work with Qt, or even if it is needed beyond Qt's JavaScript
generator, engine, etc. Just found it interesting.

Could be used to directly integrate things like d3.js [2] or node.js
without the extra interface through Qt's QScript or QWebPage? (Just
guessing there.)

If/when QGIS's code base has been updated to Qt5, JavaScript will become
readily available as a scripting solution as well.

Hello,

I've got a first highly experimental Processing-PyWPS bridging plugin:
https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-wps

* I've only tested grass convex hull with a small shapefile
* GetCapabilties and other requests work with GET calls ony
* it needs Processing patches otherwise it hangs when reading pipes
from shell process (see [1])
* Processing needs other patches as well to support concurrent
requests (for example the grass temporary script storage should be
done in tempfile instead of the current processing folder)

I don't know Processing enough to say if there aren't any other big
showstoppers for this plugin.

Still a lot of work to do :)

Another question could be the timeout.

Infact. If a processing take too much time to end.
It should go in timeout.
So not only concurrency need, but also a timeout system to avoid the 
lock never ending of resources.

This is normally done at the webserver level:

Yes I think to him when say need a timeout procedure.
The Apache KILL is absolutely brutal and is better avoid to run in it 
when there are connections to dbms or
opening of files.

Expecially if the procedure (qgis , processing, grass, and so on..) are 
not think to work in a situation where
the work could be istantaneosly interrupted.

As example:

if apache kill a procedure that use grass.
The grass is istantaneosuly killed. And this mean it leave a lock file 
in a own folder.
If an user don't remove it (the file) the grass don't restart correctly.

Hello Andrea,

PyWPS can be configured to execute a Process within a temporary
Location.

Hi Luca,

Thx, now I undrstand better.

You say the procedure pywps use a new temporary location for every new user.
At the end of the procedure the last action of the procedure is remove
the location.
If the procedure was killed for a timeout. No problem.
Every new use has a new location so no prblem with grass. And with a
cron procedure the older location are cleaned.


Andrea.

WMS/WMTS/WFS/WCS type links detected will have an "Add to
[WMS/WMTS|WFS|WCS] button enabled.  When the user clicks the button
[1], MetaSearch (among other things) uses OWSLib to do a quick
GetCapabilities test/check [2] as a means of verifying things before
it's passed to the appropriate provider [3].

The original intent was to prevent erroneously detected URLs from
getting to the provider dialogs, but it is looking like ([4], [5],
[6]) this is turning to be more of a burden that does not yield
additional value to the logic/checking already baked in the existing
WMS/WMTS/WFS/WCS providers proper.  So then MetaSearch just passes the
URL as-is.

Alex/Richard/Angelos: I propose lifting this out of MetaSearch per
above.  Comments/objections/other ideas?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugins: what's next?
Message-ID: <DUB122-W1270C59E0D643E981C43EAA7D80@phx.gbl>

hello devs!
after the good job done with the plugin-repo, I was wondering if there is any idea about trying to optimize plugins through the merging of the similar ones. something like having a package of more plugins related to a single topic (i.e. qProf + ProfileTool + VogisProfilTool   or   all the CAD ones, etc).
in this way would be easier to concentrate single devs' efforts on a single plugin instead of having more than one, and obviously it turns useful also for users not to be lost among the hundreds already present.

does it make sense? may be hard to organise the working groups? or it may lead to a heavier loading of the software?

sorry if it sounds as a silly question.

all the best!

Nic

It's not currently possible -expressions have no way of knowing the context
in which they are being used. See:

Thanks Nyall, this way I will just stop looking for it.
