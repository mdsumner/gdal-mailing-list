 create geometry from attribute

Hi all, let me precise the need:
Numerical vertex edit and wkt plugin are usefull when dealing with one geometry.
Geom calculation with field update can create eventually a WKB, but it's absolutely not user friendly, and there is actually no way to load a layer from that in a file based layer.

Think of a user getting a excel or calc spreadsheet with XY inside. The only way to import it directly as a spatial layer (not talking about using sqlite or postgis.. too complex for common users not even aware of data source types) is too export it to csv and import it with delimited text plugin.
That is always a pain since no tool exports csv in the same way when dealing with numerical / text types, decimal separators...
XLS, calc, dbf do type correctly fields and avoid any file conversion (if no formula or problem in field names today). Importing directly the datasource, and being able to spatialize it afterwards , only if needed (join pure attribute data is also a use case), would be nice.

So is the need for my corp.
My question : I would like to avoid data duplication (again) , is that feasible using pluginlayerType in python API todayu, or do I need some core modifications ? Of course, that need to be reloaded correctly with a project file.

Hi
What about using the field calculator ? I think I have seen a method in the "geometry" tools : something like geomfromwkt ? If needed, we could simply add a way to modifiy the features geometry with the field calculator, and it will do the trick.

The Quick WKT plugin does something very similar.

Hey Regis,

I think a Layer -> Create Geometry Layer menu item would be a great idea
for non geometry layers.

Wouldn't be that hard to do I don't think.

Sqlite might be the best format as it's light and flexible.  If you want
something dynamic i.e change the data, updates the points, then maybe a
plugin layer would be best. I am planning on adding the ability to define
data provider in Python for 2.1, I do have working code just can't commit
it, which I think would work well here.  It would wrap the other layers
dataprovider and just return the geometry on the fly.

We could make it 2.1.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Regis, all,

You can also open a CSV with X.Y coordinates with a VRT file describing the 
geometry component. You could automatically generate and load such a VRT with 
an interface to guide the user.

The Add Delimited Text Layer import tool also has a watch file option

http://i.imgur.com/K1BL1zo.png

However this will only work for file based layers.  I would like something
that would work for any type, PostGIS, MS SQL, etc.

Thanks Vincent, 
you are right. We already discussed that with Chris on the list. The problem
is that it is restricted to CSV again, and that it creates a separate
datasource. We could also think of extending VRT to all datatypes in OGR,
and have a GUI letting user to generate and load that VRT. That is elegant,
but what about cases with databases or read only files? Should we ask user
to write vrt somewhere (not what I want at all), or should we store vrt
definition in project file? 

Thoughts?

Hey Regis,

I think a Layer -> Create Geometry Layer menu item would be a great idea
for non geometry layers.

Wouldn't be that hard to do I don't think.

Sqlite might be the best format as it's light and flexible.  If you want
something dynamic i.e change the data, updates the points, then maybe a
plugin layer would be best. I am planning on adding the ability to define
data provider in Python for 2.1, I do have working code just can't commit
it, which I think would work well here.  It would wrap the other layers
dataprovider and just return the geometry on the fly.

We could make it 2.1.

Regards,
Nathan



that looks nice! SQLITE is a data duplication.. so could be hard to maintain
sync with datasource. 
Opinions about relying on a vrt ?

I don't think VRT would work because not all QGIS data sources are OGR
based so VRT wouldn't work in that case.

A special type of layer, e.g plugin, IMO would be best for this. Something
that just reads the feature from the underlying layer and adds the geometry
on the fly.

Hi all,

There were some discussions about the relation of the recently announced QGIS 
Enterprise [1] and the upcoming QGIS 2.0 release.
QGIS Enterprise was born out of the needs of our customers for a stable QGIS 
branch with frequent bug fix releases similar to the Ubuntu LTS model. Almost 
all of the professional QGIS users we know, have many custom plugins in use. 
Some of these plugins are applications with 10'000's lines of code! So API 
compatibility has absolutly hightest priority for them.
That's the reason we branched 1.9 before the API break to give our customers 
most of the features of 2.0 but let them more time to migrate their plugins to 
the new API.
We fixed many major bugs reported by our customers and applied them also to 
QGIS master [3]. The QGIS projects benefits from this model directly, since it 
finances at least Marco working 100% on QGIS core development. And there are 
not only bug fixes flowing back into QGIS master, but also major performance 
improvements [2],[4].
We hope very much that we can carry on this synergy for the coming years and 
look forward to see you in Maptember to work together on QGIS 2.1!

Regards
Pirmin

Hi,

Is this going to be an open initiative or limited to a Sourcepole's 
offering ? Will you backport translations ?

Hi 

I really like the idea of a LTS version of QGIS. Is there any chance to see a "community edition" (free) of QGIS Enterprise?

QGIS Enterprise is an internal QGIS branch maintained by Sourcepole.
We backport translations as needed by our customers. Currently we have english

Thank for this information. This is a good thing and I'm sure there is 
a demand for it in France :) , the only downside I see is that a single 
company is getting the use of the "Enterprise" tag attached to QGIS.

I doubt there ever was.  The stable release weren't too stable after all.

AFAIK the GPL doesn't require to distribute source to the public - just to
those you gave binaries to.

So assuming that sourcepole is only distributing binaries to customers, those
are entitled to also get the sources (but are free to redistribute, if they
want to).

I don't know how QGIS people interpret GPL based on this wikipedia definition.

Yes an no :)

There is a stable branch of QGIS: QGIS Enterprise. If you got enough costumers who does have some contract I think it would be great to grant access to QGIS Enterprise to public.

Yes, Stefan is asking for a community driven based one.  One that comes
from qgis.org rather then another company.  Not that there is anything
wrong with what sourepole are doing, it's a great idea to support customers
and being under GPL gives anyone the ability to do that.

We have talked about a "stable" branch for 2.0.  It might happen, might
not.  I'm hoping that I might be able to spend some time on it but help is
always welcome.

I rather see this "QGIS Enterprise" license under LGPL than GPL.

Don't forget the french speaking part of Switzerland ;-)
As GeoServer shows, there can be several "Enterprise" offerings [1],[2].

It's pretty simple in this case really.

Sourcepole have an internal branch of QGIS that they maintain.
This version of the code is still under GPL because QGIS is.
Sourcepole give binaries and make source available to customers.
If I am a customer, under the GPL I am able to redistribute the sourcepole
version.
Bug fixes that sourpole do are ported upstream for the greater good, if
they want to.

Sourcepole are selling support and bug fixing packages ( and faster turn
around on new builds) etc.  They are also providing a stable, more focused,
branch for their customers. Which, if I was a customer, this is a great
idea.

Personally I don't like the word Enterprise but that is just a taste thing;
and I can understand why the choice of word.

In my opinion, if it is GPL, QGIS Enterprise should be available to
Public as General "Public" License (GPL).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License

BTW, I have not interest in using QGIS Enterprise. I am happy with
QGIS 1.8 in Mac OS X.

If Sourcepole would like to follow with OpenGeo business model, that is fine.

Remember that OpenGeo provides,

1. Enterprise version, and
2. Community version.

Releasing the source code to the public isn't a requirement of the GPL
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic

However once you give the source code to someone they can post it, so
basically they can make it public for you.

Normally companies do release the source code publicly because it is easier
to control that way and centralize things.

No.  It's still GPL.

Any support docs, or training sourcepole provide however are not. Only the
QGIS software bit part

Message-ID: <51D17B64.2010709@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just for info, googling QGIS 2 release led me here:
http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/qgis_governance/release_checklists/release-2.0.html
It might be good to update this page with dates in the future ;)

Also, I was wondering if you have any intention to change the repo name 
from Quantum-GIS to QGIS before release?

Cheers,

Denis

right, we probably still have the -uantum part here and there - if you find it,
please open tickets against it.

Hello,

My understanding is that it is a commercial service, so you don't have any 
licence. 

QGIS is open source, all code source and patches are already publics or in 
master. If I understood correctly, QGIS entreprise is a binary with backward 
patches, maintenance and support services.

Pirmin will correct this if needed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Color of selected rows in table
Message-ID: <52eeb59e7c66d2b1bdcfa83f9b70dd69@carto.net>

 Hi,

 On QGIS master in Windows I have the issue that the selected rows (when 
 I select the features in the map) in the table are not salient enough. 
 They appear in a very similar light gray as every odd row. This means I 
 cannot easily distinguish an odd row from a selected row. See this 
 screenshot here: 
 http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/selected_rows_picked_from_map.png

 This is only an issue with the Windows version, not on Ubuntu/KDE, 
 where these selected rows appear in light blue.

 The other funny thing is that, if I select the rows in the table (and 
 not through the map) they appear in a blue color (see htank 
 tp://webgis.uster.ch/temp/selected_rows_picked_from_table.png). In my 
 opinion there should not be different colors whether you select objects 
 in the table or in the map.

 Can other Windows users of QGIS master confirm my issues?

 Thank you,
 Andreas

Hi Marco,

I have created a project with a composer with 2 maps and one as

Do you think this one has to be in the WMS Capabilities ?
Do we can exclude this one form WMS Capabilities ?

Hi Ren?-Luc

Why do you want the overview frame map be removed from capabilities? In 
a GetPrint request, the extent of all maps is undefined unless specified 
from the client. How would you set the extent of the overview map if not 
given by the client (fixed zoom-out ratio?)

Marco

Hi Marco,

The way I understand overview map is :
* fixed extent
* fixed layers
* fixed scale
But it's true that client can specified some informations.

Could we imagine a way to identify overview map in composer ?

I don't know if this is always true. Sometimes the overview map is only 
zoomed out a bit (e.g. QGIS map canvas overview map is not necessarily 
zoomed to full extent, it can also move).

 >Could we imagine a way to identify overview map in composer ?

It would be straightforward to add an attribute to the 
GetProjectSettings xml document. Then the client could set the overview 
extent.

Marco

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYr6rXJm6NEth+WDWaZN7j9c4n_vtB_aDRYAqcduai=77Q@mail.gmail.com>

What kind of API backward compatibility do we support in the major
release line? Binary or source?

In particular, if there is a method:
  method()
and I need to extend that method with a param:
  method(bool f = true)
and with the default value it works like the original method(), is it
sufficient to change method() to method(bool f = true) or do I have to
add a new method_new(bool f = true) and call it from the old method()
with the default param?

Similar with enums, is it allowed to change enum values during the
major release line?

Hi,

In case anyone was wondering...

I have been absent from the community for the last two weeks, though I have
been trying to follow along. My wife and I just had son (our second kid),
who showed up a full month ahead of his due date.

I am now back to a somewhat regular schedule and can devote time to fixing
issues, mostly related to labeling.

Where can one find the changes to the API for the current development version
(1.9) and the 1.8.

I am trying to update past version plugins.

Thank you,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for String Freeze!
Message-ID: <CA+3oMjtSEko4dV8-R-vFqt8kvmWKdhKR8z0-UF9y9BMui2-AEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (and especially translators),

As of today (2. July 2013) please note that we are entering string freeze
for the run up to the next release. If you are committing bug fixes please
avoid changing any strings unless it is absolutely necessary. Translation
.ts files have been updated in git so please update your local git
checkouts or download the updated .ts file from [0].

Due to the fact that this (2.0) Release of QGIS is a Major upgrade with
lots of new features there is no closing date for submitting your work this
time. A lot of issues still have to be fixed. But this is the chance for
you as a translator to have a little longer time to complete the
translation.

We do not expect any string changes during this period so translators
should be able to continue work without problems. Be aware that the
transifex [1] system is still NOT included in managing the translations for
QGIS. As soon as we have a running workflow (hopefully for 2.1) it will be
announced seperately.

If you have any questions about the translation process, please see the
following page which includes instructions on how to generate a .ts file
for a new locale.

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/GUI_Translation

Many thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do!
Regards,

Werner Macho

P.S.: The Translation Progress can be seen in the nightly versions of QGIS

 Perhaps you could be interested in our plugin:
RT QSpider.

It create a shapefile from a dbf with coordinate on two field int or
textual.

The plugin is actually for 1.8 only, bt we plan early to evolve to qgis 2.0

 Hi all, let me precise the need:****

Numerical vertex edit and wkt plugin are usefull when dealing with one
geometry. ****

Geom calculation with field update can create eventually a WKB, but it?s
absolutely not user friendly, and there is actually no way to load a layer
from that in a file based layer. ****

** **

Think of a user getting a excel or calc spreadsheet with XY inside. The
only way to import it directly as a spatial layer (not talking about using
sqlite or postgis.. too complex for common users not even aware of data
source types) is too export it to csv and import it with delimited text
plugin. ****

That is always a pain since no tool exports csv in the same way when
dealing with numerical / text types, decimal separators? ****

XLS, calc, dbf do type correctly fields and avoid any file conversion (if
no formula or problem in field names today). Importing directly the
datasource, and being able to spatialize it afterwards , only if needed
(join pure attribute data is also a use case), would be nice. ****

** **

So is the need for my corp.****

My question : I would like to avoid data duplication (again) , is that
feasible using pluginlayerType in python API todayu, or do I need some core
modifications ? Of course, that need to be reloaded correctly with a
project file. ****

Hi****

What about using the field calculator ? I think I have seen a method in the
"geometry" tools : something like geomfromwkt ? If needed, we could simply
add a way to modifiy the features geometry with the field calculator, and
it will do the trick. ****

Nice! this will help a lot with actual 1.8 in production environnement here. 
may I suggest a more explicit title for an eventual new version? 

I would vote for adding that in core vector menu for 2.1..

Hello I am interested to contribute to Quantum Gis.

I think I found a first task to do "Bug 8200".

Another work on it ?

Do you think it 's a good task for a first contribution ?

Thank you

I'm writing some "headless" Python scripts which use the QGIS API for data
management.
QgsLogger prints debug messages even if QGIS_DEBUG env var is set to 0.
How can I disble it?

I've found a workaround right now. Setting QGIS_DEBUG to -1000 makes
QgsLogger stopping all the messages (default to -999).

Hi Marco, we replied at the same time :)
I forgot to say that I'm on Windows so no /dev/null there... NUL makes
python crash.

Abnyway, even with -1000 there's an annoying issue. I always have to click
the down arrow on the keyboard to show the prompt, otherwise the
interpreter remains blinking after each command execution.

Try setting QGIS_DEBUG to -1.

Why enforcing that the input raster to be georeferenced
must have a CRS? In principle, in most cases the
raster to be georeferenced has just arbitrary Euclidean coordinates.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] get mean of pixel values within defined area
 around current mouse position
Message-ID: <20130702141211.7c6a08d1@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

for a qgis 1.8 plugin I would like to query the mean of pixel values of a
raster layer within a defined buffer for the current mouse position (not for
an existing point layer).

For the buffer it works:

... 
feat.geometry().asPoint() 
(3.5176e+06,5.4062e+06)
buff_geom = feat.geometry().buffer(1000, 5)
buff_geom.asPolygon() [[(3.5186e+06,5.4062e+06), (3.51855e+06,5.4059e+06),
(3.51841e+06,5.40562e+06), (3.51819e+06,5.4054e+06),
(3.51791e+06,5.40525e+06), (3.5176e+06,5.4052e+06),
(3.51729e+06,5.40525e+06), (3.51701e+06,5.4054e+06),...]]

but now I try to find a solution to query the raster pixels within the
buffer zone and calculate the mean, but I don't know how and if this is
possible in QGIS 1.8 at all. I found QgsZonalStatistics, but that doesn't
work for my task.

Does anybody have a solution for this or a better idea, how to solve this?

Thanks 

Otto

Only the st_intersects function can trigger IllegalArgumentException
(it is a GEOS exception). The && operator is immune.

Hi,

Not sure it's the best way but I did something similar with these
workarounds:

A - with gdal:
1 - the user click and you get your buffer. (already done)
2 - use gdalwarp with "-cutline" and "*-*crop_to_cutline" options to
extract a new raster. (python subprocess)
3 - read the created raster in a numpy array to do all the statistics you
need.

B - with matplotlib:
1 - with the buffer: create an array of the vertices
2 - read the raster into another numpy array
3 - use the "points_inside_poly" function of "matplotlib" lib to create a
numpy mask.

Not tried but postgis raster should do the job.

Hth,
Fred

Subject: [Qgis-developer] custom forms with qt4 - problem with combo box
Message-ID: <1372836386835-5063731.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear qgis-devs,

I am creating a custom form with Qt4-Editor based on these great hints from
here

http://linfiniti.com/2009/11/creating-dynamic-forms-a-new-feature-headed-for-qgis-1-4/
http://nathanw.net/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/

When I open the form in QGIS for editing my layer, I get a problem using an
'editable' ComboBox that I created in Qt4. I can input new data, but the
dropdown list is not working. I can click on the dropdown button but the
list does not appear, even though there are already values stored in that
respective column.
When I change the layer field properties in QGIS to not editable (untick the
editable check box), the dropdown list is working, but I cannot edit the
field anymore.

Any ideas what is going wrong here?

Stefan

Hi Stefan,

First, you should not set the combo box as "editable" in Qt-Designer 
[0]. It is not aimed at working like this. Only the QGIS field must be 
"editable".

Second, have you correctly set up the field as a value relation or a 
value map?

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Fred,

thanks for the hints, A and B sound interesting - PostGIS is not an option
here. 

One more question, because you already used these workarounds. What solution
A or B should be more usable (faster) from your opinion, if I need to
calculate the mean while moving the mouse over the map canvas?

Regards
Otto

Hi Nathan and Denis,

thanks for your quick replies, it helped me solving the problem! 

I am not sure if this is the right way, but now it works out the following
way:

- in Qt4, I kept the ComboBox to be editable
- in QGIS, I changed the field properties to "Value Map" (this is a little
bothering however, as I have to specify the value-description list first)

@Nathan: not even the "QLineEdit completer" was working, i.e. I input a new
value that was already existing in the column, but there was no
auto-completion, just blank.

Stefan

Just be careful with the editable option in designer, as I noticed it 
might store NULL values.

Hi Denis,

I don't see how I can set editable option in QGIS for 'Value Map' or 
'Value relation'. This option only exists for Unique Value.

Hi Stefan,

Sorry my mistake, this is a feature which has been added in master 
version (upcoming 2.0).

Editable in QGIS will allow the user to interact or not with the combo 
box (this corresponds to "enabled" option in Qt Designer).
Editable in Qt Designer means the user can write values in the combo box.

Hope it's clearer!

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all

I try QGIS Master on debian wheezy with this depot : qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org

Since a few updates qgis did not start at all now;

If I launch in command line, I have :

symbol lookup error : /usr/bin/qgis.bin: undefined symbol: _ZN14QgsApplication8createDBEP7QString

Do you know where is the problem ?

Thanks

Ludovic

Hello all
also in my case I get an error.
with this query
***********
SELECT a.fid, a.geom
  FROM elf.elettrodotti_3045 as a
join
  elf.linee_elettriche_all_3045 as b
on
  st_dwithin(b.geom, a.geom, 50);
***********
on pgadmin works
on qgis 1.8 works and can load data as layer
on qgis 1.9-master (rev bc002f7) dbmanager execute correctly the query but I
can't load as layer with postgis error postgresql layer has no primary key
(fid is a PK...)

Thanks
Pietro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Iterate on vectors : overlay analysis
Message-ID: <1372846504737-5063764.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I'm a beginner in python and pyqgis. 

I have a precise idea of what I want to do with python scripts : I have
often many recurrent overlaying tasks to do.
For example, what are the layers which intersects with a particular or a
bunch of layers in a folder or in a spatialite database ? Or make a buffer
for all the vector layers in a folder or a spatialite database. 

So I need to learn how to loop with vectors and apply overlaying or spatial
query to them.

For now I searched :
- On how to work with layers from map canvas : ok with pyqgis cookbook
-On how to intersect : QGSOverlayAnalyzer for the Intersection, but I don't
know for buffer etc.
- on how to loop with layers and QGSOverlayAnalyzer...not idea at all.
- on how to loop with spatial queries, not idea at all.

As the API is huge and the classes numerous, could you guide my research in
the good direction ? Or give some example of looping with an overlay
treatment between current map layers or folders ?

Thanks for your help.

Bye

Hi,
I have no idea in terms of performance but I would bet on B option in your
case.
Thanks to give feedback.

probably A would be slow because of the external call to gdalwarp

I don't think that it is possible to add test for src/app/main.cpp
into the system we are using for other tests. It would be necessary to
run qgis executable to test that options, but AFAIK qgis cannot be run
in noninteractive mode.

I have got recently close to this problem because I wanted to add a
test for functions in QgisApp. I added a new constructor to QgisApp,
qgis_app lib and it is possible to test QgisApp from test unit. I'll
add it in 2.1 (https://github.com/blazek/Quantum-GIS/commit/f5ebe855)

There are new EPSG and towgs84 params for 5513, 5514, 5221,
2065,102067, 4156 and 4818 in QGIS but they are deleted/overwritten by
wrong values from GDAL by crssync (at least in weekly build for win).
Until we manage to push them also into GDAL, I need to preserve
somehow the correct values from resources/srs.db.

Unfortunately no, the new EPSG codes which are not in GDAL are deleted.

It seems to be impossible to be maintained. I have correct EPSG codes
but no way to get it into distribution.

Hi

Pirmin what happens if / when QGIS project itself wants to release QGIS
Enterprise version - or another company? Maybe it would be better to call
it 'Sourcepole GIS' or something to make it clear that it is not an
official QGIS product but an official Sourcepole product? I think there is
going to be a lot of confusion otherwise with people thinking that it is
part of the QGIS project but they can't have it....

Also (out of curiosity) what is to stop one of your clients cloning the
private source tree that you provide and then making that publicly
available - or just pushing it back in to the mainstream QGIS tree? i.e. do
you realise any real long term benefit from keeping the tree private in the
first place?

Best regards

Tim

Hi!

As I had some problems with non existing EPSG Codes in the srs.db
lately too .. I support Radim here ..
It seem's that something is going wroing here .. While most of the
world is covered not all EPSGs are available or being overwritten ..

Isn't there an official "latest" database that we can just take? Or
try to make it easy for the user to update the db if connected to the
internet sync db on QGIS start or something like that?

kind regards
Werner

Brilliant. Why didn't we think of that before - and we can also reduce the
cluttered QGIS UI to a single DWIM[1] button while we're at it. ;)

7805af3cf introduces a noupdate field in tbl_srs, that is set to 1 for the
mentioned CRSes.  And crssync doesn't update or delete records marked like
that.  But that flag should probably tracked somehow and set to 0 eventually,
when the CRSes get corrected in/introduced to geotiff/GDAL/proj.4.

*lol*
I knew that that was coming ..
And I also knew that you surely already took a look on it .. but as I
did not know what has already been looked at .. I took the easiest
thought that I had ..
I also know that it is not easy .. but .. as Radim also said .. there
are problems .. somehow ..

But thanks for the insight into crssync and the noupdate field .. :(
.. crazy stuff ..

And .. if you could implement a DWIM UI .,. I would also like to see
that in a lot of other software :)

regards
Werner

Hi all,

I have been redrawing a few PNG icons last days.
I have already changed the identify and action icon as shown on the 
right of the printscreen.

Two commits are on their way to get accepted for selection and system icons:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/693 
<https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/693/files>
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/692

I think the pan icons are a more debatable point.
I tried 2 news designs.
Image attached or 
https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/127259/748218/16c720c0-e482-11e2-9058-58a5d24d56b5.png

Could you tell what you think about them?
1. Keep current
2. Hand style
3. Pad and arrow style

Of course we can have a combination, so please specify pan or panToSelected.

I think it's a good time to update these icons, and will give QGIS a 
fresh look for 2.0.
I took the initiative of doing so on my own. I started with two awful 
icons (identify and action), and I felt like going on.... So if you 
think things should not be changed, please say it, so I won't spend too 
much time on this.
And if you like the changes, you can also say so ;)

Greetings,

Denis

Hi

A big +1 to switch to the hand based ones from me.

Hi Denis,

thanks for your effort.

+1 for pan = hand
panToSelected with hand looks like "select by click" to me, so +1 to 
keep current (symbols IMHO need not be similar as panToSelected is a 
button and pan is a tool)

Bernhard

Great, thanks.

It seems that GDAL is occasionally synced with EPSG from libgeotif
[1], no additional overrides. In [2] is described EPSG in libgeotif.
They keep overrides separate in gcs.override.csv and pcs.override.csv,
it is not clear to me if gcs/pcs.override.csv are used somehow by
crssync or not.

If I got it,  If we want to get correct towgs84 params to srs.db in a
clean way, they must be added to libgeotif gcs/pcs.override.csv and
crssync must use them.

BTW, we have a problem [2]:

"Note that we deliberately keep alterations separate from the EPSG definitions
in gcs.csv and pcs.csv to avoid violating the EPSG distribution license
which requires that the definitions be distributed in unaltered form."

Note. The database from epsg.org does contain the correct
transformations (towgs84) 4836 (SK) and 5239 (CZ), the problem is that
each one is for a different territory but the same CRS. While the
relation between CRS and transformation in EPSG database is
(naturally) one-to-many, QGIS oversimplified the relation to
one-to-one. So all the evil comes from QGIS itself. We should probably
separate CRS from towgs84 and allow users to choose from multiple
towgs84 for CRS.

Is it the same problem I had some years ago while doing some stuff on
austrian coordinate system?

I took a picture at that time how ESRI solved to manage it

If yes .. than cedric knows what I am talking about :)

We have a similar problem here with multiple transformations between two 
coordinate systems (ntv2 based transformation more accurate in that case).
So I was also thinking about enhancing the coordinate transformation 
class to store transformations in a table (import from epsg 
transformation info) and let the user select the transformation in case 
several exist. QgsCoordinateTransform would then adjust the proj-strings 
of source and dest CRS on the fly.

What do you think about such a solution? It looks like I have the 
possibility to work quite soon on such an enhancement.

Regards,
Marco

Where do you want to let user select the transformation? In my opinion
it should be possible everywhere where CRS may be selected (including
OWS dialogs). That means not to have one global transformation set for
user or project because it may happen that it is necessary to work
with data with different transformations in a single project.

Is it possible to do it without API break?

Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F5551A41D1D@fmexch2.fylkesmannen.local>

Hi,

Is anyone else still having problems with this bug http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6468?

I am writing a standalone python program, and my code loads a style from a .qml file, but the labels do not display when the maps are rendered to a .jpg.

The polygons have the correct styling (border etc), but not the labels. I am using new style labeling.

The labels load correctly within QGIS GUI, but not in the python code.

I am using QGIS master from OSGeo4W, updated today.

Thanks

James Stott

Good point. Probably the user should be asked if setting/changing CRS of 
a layer or if user changes the map CRS (in that case he is asked for all 
layers). It might be a bit of a useability challenge to make this user 
friendly (especially for users who don't bother about transformations).

>Is it possible to do it without API break?

I hope it is possible to enhance QgsCoordinateTransform with additional 
methods (reading transformations from sqlite, reading/writing to project 
file, etc...). My guess is that it is possible without break.

Regards,
Marco

I have no authority to say this, but just go for it ! There are lots of 
bugs and the core team seems a bit overwhelmed by blockers for 2.0 
release, so they will welcome any help ! Once you have a fix, the best 
is to issue a pull request in github.

Regards,

Leyan

Hi all, 
User here are a bit lost when having to open xls files, just because ogr
file filters don't mention it, and because browser panel does not see it at
all. 
Is there any technical problem not to display that file format? If not, I
will create a feature request (for 2.1 of course now)
All the best
R?gis

+1 for pan with the hand!
 
for panToSelected, instead of rotating the hand you could try to just leave it like pan and add the selection box, that way it will eliminate the "select by click" effect I think

Hi all.
How is it possible to know, in the print composer, which one is Map0, Map1, etc.?
I kind of remember in 1.8 this was shown on a tooltip, but I cannot see it in current
master.
All the best.

Hi all.
In my recent install, the mouse wheel does not seem to work for zooming on the

It works e.g. for selecting through a scrolldown menu.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SEXTANTE adaptation to new SAGA version
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zED3TtmdP8xGGffhw6-JfFbOwqK2bo8aQKF=Tm9ay-6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

SAGA 2.1.0 has just been released. The current version of SEXTANTE in
master has been now adapted to work with SAGA 2.1.0, and raster
algorithms will not work with any other version. Please, update your
SAGA executables if using the latest master version, since now 2.1.0
is the target version.

The only algorithm adapted so far is the raster export one, which, for
SEXTANTE, was the most important one that had been modified, since it
blocks all other raster algorithms. Other algorithms might have
changed, but they are not adapted yet. If you find something that was
working before and now it doesn't, please report. Also, if there are
new algorithms, feel free to suggest them to be added to SEXTANTE as
well, describing their syntax, if possible, to help us do it.

Windows users, please notice that the Osgeo4W installer still ships
with SAGA 2.0.8, so you will need to install SAGA 2.1.0 manually and
change the SAGA path in SEXTANTE. This will be updated soon, so it's
just a temporary issue

Thanks for your help
Victor

Thanks.  This is good since only 2.1 works on OS X.

Hi,

I was under the impression that the GUI would be finalized with string
freeze. Is the plan now to incorporate these new icons in 2.0? I'm
asking because I'm preparing material which I would like to be
up-to-date with the final release and I would like to know when I can
be certain that the screenshots won't change anymore. Or should I wait
until the release is out?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita!

Sorry for that .. but string freeze does not seem no necessarily mean
GUI Freeze :)
Anyway .. I also fixed some typos and bug in the original language that
i got reported back ..
And i think with this changes to some icons we should be good to leave
the GUI on its own ..

And .. well except of the hand (which I also like more than the arrows
for panning) The icons look at least very similar to what they looked
before ..

And my personal opinion is still that people should not rely that much
on how the icon look like but more on the function behind it ..

regards
Werner

I totally agree but I also learned the hard way that some people will  
freak out if you change the icons even only just a little bit.

Thanks everyone!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building QGIS 1.8 in openSUSE 12.3
Message-ID: <3262160.AUYIpnNTX3@resilience.greenzone>

Hi QGIS devs!

I recently switch (and still am in a testing phase) from (K)Ubuntu to openSUSE 
(12.3).  Feels great so far, stable -- very.

I am trying to  compile QGIS 1.8 from source but I have some difficulties as I 
am not sure how similar the "process" is comparing to (K)Ubuntu (Debian-based) 
Linux.


I think I have (already) installed build dependencies with

sudo zypper si -d qgis

Reading installed packages...
Loading repository data...
Resolving package dependencies...

Nothing to do.



Next, I have instructed in "/etc/ld.so.conf.d/osgeo.conf"

/osgeo/src/Quantum-GIS/build/output/lib/



The configuration (ccmake) goes fine and then, the compilation fails:

Linking CXX shared library ../../output/lib/libqgis_gui.so
[ 47%] Built target qgis_gui
make: *** [all] Error 2



The file mentioned above exists in

/osgeo/src/Quantum-GIS/build/output/lib/libqgis_gui.so



What is next to do/search in order to get qgis compiled?

Thanks, Nikos

Hi Anita,

I am sorry I started this without discussing more.
As said, I just wanted to do one or two, and I end up with doing 10.
I will do the last today, and I will pull request today. So then, it's 
just a matter of when the pull requests are accepted.
Also as said Werner, these are really minor changes except for the 
really bad ones (the next will be oracle and mssql).

Greetgins,

Denis

Hi!
There is still the Poll about "Which "Version" of Windows are you using?"
Currently 75% are using 64Bit Versions and 25% are using 32Bit Versions ..

Adressed to Andreas .. Still leave the poll there and wait or can we
take it from the Webpage?

I think a completely different name of a "new" GIS which is "very similar" to 
QGIS could be more confusion than one or many QGIS variants. Look at the 
various Linux variants (some of them commercial) or many other examples [1].

We didn't think a lot about publishing our source code branch, yet. So this 
could happen anytime. The question why clients do not publish sources of 
commercial FOSS software is hard to answer. Maybe it's a question of loality?

Hi Werner,

You can take this poll off the webpage.

The poll supports my hypothesis that the majority of the QGIS Windows
users is already on the 64bit version.

The disappointing thing is that, except one or two organizations, hardly
any company or organization wants to contribute to this effort financially.

Maybe we should migrate everything to 64bit Windows and get rid of the
32bit version to avoid a lot of duplicate work. But even this would mean
several days/weeks of work for someone.

Hi,

Shouldn't there already be SVG versions around for the original icons? I
can't imagine that the original icons where created in a raster editor
(like GIMP) and not in a vector tool like Inkscape?

This is just a question.

Hi Nikos,

why don't you use the packages from application:geo repository:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Download#24-openSUSE

And if you need to compile, you can take a look at the spec file here:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Application:Geo/qgis?expand=1&file=qgis.spec

Maybe this helps

Regards
Otto

Hi Andreas,

I have no idea about this. At least, for most of them there is nothing 
in the repository.

Hi,

That's bad. We should always have the SVG versions next to the raster
versions.

As we discussed SVG should be the default in the future.

Already most of the new devices have high-resolution displays and the
raster versions really look ugly/blurry on these devices.

Thanks for your work, Denis.

Yes, I know, I don't understand why they're not present in the folder.
Al the new icons are SVG !

Hi, 
I could support a part of the work for a 64 bit version if needed. 
 That would be very much usefull for 2.0 here here. Last discussions I
remember on 64 bits version said that Jef was taking charge of it. Since we
have not seen any clear call for funding, funders probably didn't show up.
Please confirm and help us estimate the needs. 


Anyway, I think that we must not abandon 32 bit packages since many users
still have old machines. QGis seems to grow as a tool used in poor
countries, for developpement projects, even if we don't have much feedback
of that. Cutting some of them because of incompatible hardware could be very
bad publicity.

Hi,

QGIS is used by many environmental NGOs. Their work is most of the time 
based on voluntary work. These volunteers have quite often older 
machines -> 32bit.
If 32bit is abandoned will QGIS community lose hundreds or thousands of 
users. The counter how many units (QGIS applications) has been 
downloaded does not show all these installations where only one package 
has been downloaded but installed into ten computers !
Even if the summer is hot You should be calm when doing assessment when 
to drop 32bit out of games.

Best regards,
Kari

	which is then corrupted
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO79HSNJjcL+_uYqAjpwy6jSAFXWJ8RmkkcW_QkRgfHQgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I am user last QGIS master (from yesterday), and sometimes, when saving the
project, QGIS crashes. I have not yet find a way to properly reproduce the
bug.
But this is for me a real blocker, since the QGIS project file is then
corrupted and lost ( 0 ko ). It seems that "save as" can help to avoid this
bug.
It seems also that the problem occurs when I want to add a new layer to the
project, then save.

Is this bug already well known or shoud I open a ticket (and try to provide
a project which reproduces the bug)

Kind regards

Michael

It seems to be related to adding a layer from the browser dock.  I fixed a
bug like this a few weeks ago but it seems it's resurfaced.

Hi Kari,

My message was meant to be "provoiking". People want everything - they
want a version 1.9. They want both 32bit and 64bit versions. But they
are not willing to contribute. They just take things for granted.

I am aware that there are still 32bit machines around - but then these
computers must be at least 10 years old. For the past decade all
machines are 64bit capable.

Maybe these NGOs just do not realize that their machines are 64bit
capable and that they can only gain from upgrading the software on their
machines (reusing the very same hardware).

Even NGOs have resources - if they don't have financial resources they
should have at least human resources that could upgrade the operating
system on their computers. I would assume they would even be eligible
for free Windows upgrades given their non-profit status - or even better
- they could switch to Linux.

I do not want to trigger a huge discussion here but rather tell people
that they have some sort of responsibility as QGIS users and should
contribute in some way.

Andreas

Hi R?gis,

Yes - J?rgen will be able to work on it after his bugfixing work for
QGIS 2.0.

Things look much better now, financially. If you can also contribute a
bit there should be enough financial resources around.

Lets discuss this with J?rgen and the two of us offlist.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I most apologize my mail and the ideas in it. Of course You are right. I 
can see Your expertise which I don't have.
The unemployed youths should of course buy new machines and start, at 
least, to donate to FOSS projects immediately.
No more of this topic.

Best regards,
Kari

I agree with Pirmin, a product with a completely different name sounds
like a new GIS software.
In addition, not keeping the relation with the QGIS project may damage the
project itself in the long run.

Why do not put the company name in the front, something like
Sourcepole QGIS Cloud/Enterprise?
This makes everything more clear and allows others companies, but mainly
the QGIS project itself, to create its own version.

Just my 2 cents.

Hi!

My suggestion to solve that kind of problems would be to just have a

"something"|..... based on QGIS

but I appreciate the appearance of the enterprise QGIS and hope that
it will QGIS itself some push to be more known by companies ..

regards
Werner

I just reproduced the bug. It is indeed caused when loading a layer from
the browser.
Full reproductible example here :

Hi all,

it seems there are still a number of inconsistent icons in the new theme, I see

add oracle layer
add sql server layer
add sql anywhere layer
add oracle georaster layer
db manager
evis
interpolation


I'm in doubt about

topology checker
globe


feedback?

Thanks Denis for this great work

Giovanni, I personnaly like the topology checker icon. You are right we
could replace the blue with the "grey-blue' of the other new icons, to make
him less "flashy" compared to the others

Already did! In fact I used to manually create a list of dependencies:

There was a similar problem here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2013-May/022598.html

Since it compiles on the opensuse build server without problems, I guess you
should check, if the versions of the dependency paykages fit. Maybe you have
qt packages installed from different opensuse repositories or versions,
that make the gui build crash?

Otto

Well.. I think they already choose and from my point of view they are free
to do it as they like.. I think they are close enough to the project to
know what they do.. And I think it is a good idea to have some income to
provide that service..
Taking another mail from today.. People mostly take it for grant and just
take qgis without contributing something.. While I can (currently)  live
with that sourcepole is more than welcome to make their income.. With their
contributions to the project it's just fair to leave it as it is..
When I read permits announcement the first time I knew what was going to
happen.. And it happened ;-)
So I wish sourcepole a lot if success with that project and will just keep
on reading this thread
;-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Vector attribute types compatibility
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYpzCDk9mnrLdJGOMBMRV_dKTiFx4xDXMwvKK=Wj2Y+Jog@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to ask how vector attribute types conversion between
providers is supposed to work. Currently:

QgsMemoryProvider:
* mNativeTypes: int(10), double(20,5), string(255)
* addAttributes() silently skips the field if type is not Int, Double
or String, does not test length and precision, always returns true.

QgsOgrProvider:
* mNativeTypes: int(10), double(20,15), string(255), date, datetime
(the types should be taken from OGR because depend on OGR driver, but
I don't see any function in OGR to get supported types)
* addAttributes(): if type is not supported, the field is not added,
error is set and returns false, supported fields are added however.
* createEmptyLayer() is using QgsVectorFileWriter which has its own
field types handling (different from QgsOgrProvider::addAttributes())
and calls directly OGR_L_CreateField()
* convertField(): doing the same as QgsVectorFileWriter (copy pasted
code) but not used at all

QgsPostgresProvider:
* mNativeTypes: int(0), longlong(0), double (20,20), string(255), date
(there are more types defined but these are those with max
lengh/precision per QVariant type)
* addAttributes(): is using field typeName() to add fields, but
typeName is always provider specific so it may become problem if
fields come from another provider. If single field fails, no fields
are added (transaction) and false is returned
* createEmptyLayer(): is using convertField() (that is why d'n'd does
not fail) on all fields and then addAttributes()
* convertField(): sets field typeName based on type

The problems I see:
* impossible to take simply fields from one provider and add them to
another one, for example:
    * ogr -> memory: numbers are often double(24,15) or date
    * ogr -> postgres: ogr is using String as typeName which fails as
type in postgres, postgres mNativeTypes are too short
* postgres provider addAttribute() takes typeName (which may be
whatever) as type for add column
* no method to convert not supported field to a supported one + get
message (for example, "string cut to 255 characters" or "date
converted to string"

I believe that, from user point of view, if data are being written to
a provider which does not supported all data types, then:
* user should be warned before the data are written, getting a list of
necessary type conversions and length/precision cuts
* if confirmed by user, all the data should be written converted to
supported types
but there is no support for that in API.

My suggestion:
* add
     virtual QgsField QgsVectorDataProvider::supportedField(field, ok, message)
  which would try to convert unsupported field to a supported field
and set message about conversion, it should almost never fail
* all methods adding fields (createEmptyLayer, QgsVectorFileWriter)
should use the same provider addAttributes()
* provider addAttributes() should first check if all fields are
supported using supportedField() and add nothing if at least one is
unsupported (if some fields are not added successive addFeature()
fails because of different number of attributes)
* add support for date and datetime to memory provider and set
benevolent length/precision limits (however it is not correct to set
size/precision > 15 for double, that is the only way to make possible
to copy data from OGR)

I am not sure how QgsPostgresProvide::addAttributes() should work,
because using typeName() may fail for fields from different provider
while using type() (i.e. convertField()) would disable the possibility
to specify explicitly postgres type by typeName. This is maybe
crucial. In general, what defines field type - "type" or "typeName"?
We could say that if typeName is unknown to postgres, it should use a
type based on "type" but the same typeName may have different meaning
for different drivers.

I am talking about 2.1.

+1 for clarifiying the use of types in QGIS. It is very hard for
non-developers users to understand the concepts behind, and the differences
between real, double, float /  int, integer, int4, int8  / varchar, char,
text, string / etc.

The hard part would be to let the drivers use specific types != showing
only "simple types" as float / string / integer / boolean.
Why not store the driver type (for example bigint for postgres) but only
show "simple" correspondance ( integer here). The power users will be able
to see the real driver type in the metadata tab (or anywhere else more
appropriate).

I would love to see only these types in the Field tab : string / float /
integer / boolean

Well, as mentioned here

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Fwd-QGIS-Desktop-Bug-8085-New-A-64-bits-build-on-Windows-crash-on-exit-td5060493.html

I offered to help a bit with the 64 bits build. It's a pity that some 
bugs in the building system are not addressed yet (namely the some 
include libs being ignored).

If it is off interest this link has my dependencies with both 32 & 64 
all build with VS2010

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w85ib633hcua9lc/wPB-OXhQpG

The above misses the Qt and qscintilla because my local directory is not 
cleanly separated and it amounts to > 1.5 Gb.
There is also no postgree libs not GRASS but the rest should be pretty 
complete.

I still not able to run the qgis64 with the python I used to compile it 
(Winpython 2.7.5 portable). As far as could debug it it stop with an 
error something like

"cannot evalString" when trying to load the plugin fTool

Hope it helps

Hoi Joaquim,

Thank you for your reply.

As it seems now, J?rgen can invest the time to work on it - and with
collaborative efforts and one major sponsor (Vorarlberg) we should be
able to finance it.

J?rgens main goal is to automate the build with the OSGeo4W build
system, so that the OSGeo4W distribution, the standalone installer, the
stable and developer version can all be built from the same sources and
build system.

As it looks currently, J?rgen can work on this in August and it should
then be ready with the QGIS 2.0 release - if there are no
major/unsolvable problems.

Thanks to all who replied so far and offered their help.

Andreas

Message-ID: <6B54F199-286F-4059-A88C-FD56C3B3AB21@gmail.com>

Hi, 

If this report is repeated one, sorry for that. 

I got this error message when I tried to do spatial join. 

I used latest weekly master version on Windows. 

----
An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    res = self.compute(inName, joinName, outPath, summary, sumList, keep, self.progressBar)
  File "C:\QGIS\apps\qgis-dev\python\plugins\fTools\tools\doSpatialJoin.py", line 145, in compute
    fieldList1.extend(fieldList)
TypeError: QgsFields.extend(QgsFields): argument 1 has unexpected type 'list'

Python version:
2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]


QGIS version:
1.9.0-Master Master, 1ad59b7

----

According to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7103, this should be fixed around 4 months ago. 

Any idea on this?

Message-ID: <CAFO80_qSDhOaH4d7LVg5Pc_oyMW2SCnG6fRf5hms+k2CP-jk-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

to support my porting work of qgis's plugins, I found really useful
the RemoteDebug plugin developed by Pirmin Kalberer of SourcePole:

I roughly ported it without good testing... but it seems to work.

you can find the fork here: https://github.com/luipir/qgis-remote-debug
and some instruction to set it up.

generally the plugin hang up qgis if it's not capable to communicate
with the pydev debug server...

I hope it could be useful to speed-up plugin porting.

Hi all.
I have used qgis on win, and I think I've hit this issue:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34148/qgis-opening-a-shapefile-without-an-exclusive-file-lock
The symptom is: while transferring files to a server with filezilla, shapefiles open
in qgis are not copied.
On Debian this apparently does not happen.
Should I file a ticket?
All the best.

Hi Gino,

I already had a pull request for the same, but your branch looks much 
more complete.
So I will happily dismiss mine, once you issued a pull request for 
yours.

Just a sidenote: There is no need to convert a value to a type /str/ 
and then to a type /unicode/ a simple unicode(value) instead of 
unicode(str(value)) is fine.

Looking forward to having an updated version in the repo.

Matthias

Message-ID: <201307061135.36237.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi,

Some new svg icons (all the wrenches, hammers and screwdrivers) are completely 
out of the palette. Those icons in options or layer properties dialogs are 
much more colorful and complicated than other icons [1]. Sorry to say that, 
but it looks awful to me :) I'd either ask Robert if he has a svg version  
somewhere (although he's probably quite busy right now) or leave png (the 
property icons are not supposed to scale AFAIK). Making svg at all cost is not 
the right way IMHO and the recent look is a regression for me.

Hi Borys

It is not in use anymore. But let me remove it, some parts in the 
composer still depend on it and need to be deactivated.
Furthermore, the 'overlay' plugin type can be removed as well.

Marco

Some really are regressions in my view as well. Please consult with Robert
and work on consistency.
Layer Properties | General icon now does not fit at all.
I don't think there was urgent need to rework icons which already fit the
"gis" theme. Rather get the remaining odd ones (e.g add oracle layer) done.

Best wishes,
Anita

Personally I don't agree with this. The new add layer icons look pretty
nice, they still need a bit of work but if Denis builds of Larry's
suggestions I think they will come out looking good.  The old ones looked
to much the same even if they did fit in with the theme in terms of colour
and style.

I haven't checked the new add layer icons yet. They are not in the nightly
I just installed.
I was mostly put off by the icons in Layer properties and Settings which
Borys mentioned.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CyberTracker integration
Message-ID: <072f01ce7a5f$5837b250$08a716f0$@com>

Hi folks,

 

I'm the developer of CyberTracker (http://www.cybertracker.org
<http://www.cybertracker.org/> ). This is a free data capture and
visualization tool. The desktop side runs on Windows, but the client runs on
Windows, Windows Mobile and Android.

 

I'm interested in scoping out what would be involved in integrating with
QGIS. One simple idea might be a way to automatically generate a data
capture application that populates a shape file all from within QGIS. I'm
definitely open to alternatives.

 

For the folks who know QGIS well, does this sound like a viable approach?
Are there other similar efforts?

 

Cheers,

-Justin

Sure, the layer icons are nice, I was only talking about the Options->General

Did you already have a look at QGIS?

There is the coordinate capture plugin that allows to create features from GPS
positions (points and lines) - that might be a starting point.

And it's possible to create custom forms to ease entering and editing of
attributes.

Nathan's qmap[1] plugin also might have similar goals.

Could be a small problem with SIP 4.14.7 and Mt Lion (sorry, I'm on Lion, but it's annoying that a minor update is sensitive to system version).  If 4.14.6 works, that's OK, but good to know for updating the INSTALL doc.

What version of Xcode do you have?

Hi,

Just two days ago I updated my QGIS build environment on Lion with SIP
4.14.7, PyQt v4.10.2 and QScintilla v2.7.2 (using latest XCode). Everything
went fine, with no compile errors. So, I can confirm it work builds OK on
Lion.

However, I did notice something odd. I generally run from the build
directory. Due to the env update, I completely erased my build dir before
doing a new configure and compile to make sure everything is a fresh build.
In my CMake config options I have WITH_PY_COMPILE=TRUE, which appears to
create incompatible .pyc files from the generated resource_rc.py files
created with the new SIP version. Deleting the .pyc files and letting
QGIS's embedded interpreter create the byte-compiled versions on launch
fixed the issue (otherwise fTools and GDAL Tools would not load).

I will test this again on my nightly build Macs at work when I update their
environments this week.

Regards,

Larry

I have just updated some of Denis's property icons to help them match the
characteristics of existing icons [0]. There were issues with the new icons
having no buffered whitespace and the line width was a bit heavy [1].

However, I do not see how you can label Denis's excellent initiative to
rework these icons as 'incoherent and unprofessional' or a regression. ?? I
fail to see how that type of criticism is constructive towards the goal of
arriving at better icons, especially since none of the new icons is in any
way of lesser quality, artistically or intrinsically, than the ones they
have replaced.

I also fail to see how these icons being SVG has anything to do with issue.
IMO all icons in the program should be switched over to SVG. There are no
issues that I can see with doing so.

Thanks J?rgen,

 

I see Nathan?s project is really about putting a stripped down version of
QGIS onto a PDA. Nevertheless, it?s impressive.

 

CyberTracker is designed more as a data capture conduit ? highly
customizable UI (via XML) that can be used even by low-literate folks.
Integration with QGIS would be great.

 

If anyone is interested in a collaboration, please let me know.

My project isn't about putting QGIS onto PDA.  QGIS doesn't run on PDAs and
I doubt it ever will.

QMap is meant to be a field collection version of QGIS.

That?s true, I missed the concept of a form in the description on the site. 

 

My interest is in a rich, user friendly data capture experience, especially
for cases where the field user is not a QGIS user and may not be able to
read or write. Our studies indicate that this is also a more efficient way
to capture data for literate users. Over the years we?ve rolled our own
mini-GIS for the desktop, but the scalability of this approach is clearly
limited. Since we?re a non-profit and in the process of opening our code, it
makes sense to leverage an existing system. Of the solutions I have
investigated, QGIS seems most aligned at the technical level.

 

We do bring some interesting work to the table. Our client supports Windows
Mobile and Android and has a large library of customizable UI components
which can capture many different data types, including images and sound.
There is also support for timer tracks and a field map.

 

I?m pretty new to the Open Source community, so apologies if this is off.
I?m probably going about this all wrong.

 

Cheers,

-Justin

Hi Radim

Thanks for raising this important point.

>but the same typeName may have different meaning
>for different drivers


How about passing a string that tells the origin provider string? The 
data provider could then recognise if it comes from the same provider 
and use the native types. If not, it should use the Qt type and 
information from QgsField (e.g. length, precision. Probably more in 
future? ).

Marco

Hi Justin

Having a cybertracker sequence generator in QGIS would be great. In general
for open source the way to go is to build something that solves your own
needs and then put it out there for others to use and contribute to. You
will probably get much more useful and directed feedback if people have
something (even an initial prototype) to play with that they can then kick
the tyres and give you pointers on what additions would make it more useful.

Regards

Tim

Surely it's a step in right direction, thanks. However the icons still ignore 
the palette (especially the saturation) and the style (e.g. the degree of 
shape complexity) of icons already existing on the list. Just compare the 
hammer&screwdriver to the paintbrush.

I appreciate Denis' daily work so much that I don't mince words when one 
particular commit goes IMHO in completely wrong direction. Denis, I kindly 
appologize if you felt offended or depreciated. I used to talk straight if I 
completely can't agree with a particular action and I'm thankful if people do 
the same to me.

I have nothing against the new icons themselves. I don't prefer the old ones. 
Even if I did, I'm not going to force my personal taste. But I'm going to 
defend a basic harmony in the GUI. The new icons just completely don't fit to 
the others. I'm not skilled in design, so usually I sit still and let more 
competent people work. But this is one of the rare moments, when I feel 
constrained to point out that maybe asking the original author about svg 
sources may be better solution than introducing such a mixture of styles.

Of course all icons should be switched, but imho not at the cost of making 
them incoherent. Btw. big thanks for your tonight's replacements the old 
inconsistent icons :)

Hi Justin
I think your project seems a little bit similar to http://fulcrumapp.com/   http://fulcrumapp.com/features/  for field data collection, maybe just missing the part for people who can read or write
What they do is capture data using custom forms on the field and then you sync over the internet on the cloud, once on a computer you can export the data to use with GIS software and create PDF reports
Probably a similar approach?

Hi Antonio,

 

Yes, similar to Fulcrum.

 

I?ve been following them for a while now and think they are doing a lot of
things right. They?re missing a few components that are important for us,
e.g. full offline (for security) and support for a number of in-field
scenarios. It?s possible these features will be created over time. The
proprietary nature of Fulcrum would tend to turn off some potential groups
in the same way as it occasionally has for us. 

 

So far, we have not seen meaningful support for low literate users in any
major product. As more and more folks have smart phones, this may pick up. 

 

Cheers,

-Justin

Thats understandable the differences, now Justin can you specify more about how would you like to make the integration
 
I am thinking you would probably want to do the data collection using CyberTracker, then export it or download it to be used within QGIS. Now what is it that you would want to do with the data inside QGIS? Depending on your goals you may want to create a plugin that would take the data and do certain predefined analysis

Hi Borys, Larry Nathan and all,

I did felt a bit offended, but I am sure it was not your intention, it 
is for sure a question of culture. French speakers tend to wrap up with 
nice words ;)

Anyway, I get your point for these icons. If wanted, I can simplify the 
hammer or something else.

Now, here is my plan.
First, I will finalize the icons for project/layer toolbars according to 
Larry's recommendations. Thanks a lot to Larry and Nathan for your 
support and comments by the way.
Second, I will try to get a nice hand for pan.
Then, I will try to harmonize a bit the settings icons by bringing a new 
set.

Also, pull requests are open, so anything constructive should be written 
into them.

Cheers,

Denis

Seems it's not necessary. As I'm the only one disturbed here, probably also an 
average user won't get any negative impression.

Hi Antonio,

 

One area of difference with CyberTracker is that it captures data as
name+value pairs. Converting to shape file attributes therefore tends to be
lossy. Alternatively, one data set point might be able to populate several
shape file attributes. I?m not sure how to deal with this yet, but my
thinking is that we would go simple and fully automatic first. The
integration involves converting a shape to a data model, sending the data
model to CyberTracker and managing the return of the data.

 

For the purposes of analysis, I?m thinking that any feature that
CyberTracker has that is not in QGIS yet, would be built in parallel over
time. We have relatively simple charts (like effort, distance travelled,
etc), but also something called Index of Abundance which would be nice to
have open (if it?s not already there).

 

Cheers,

-Justin

Thats understandable the differences, now Justin can you specify more about
how would you like to make the integration
 
I am thinking you would probably want to do the data collection using
CyberTracker, then export it or download it to be used within QGIS. Now what
is it that you would want to do with the data inside QGIS? Depending on your
goals you may want to create a plugin that would take the data and do
certain predefined analysis

Hi Antonio,

 

Yes, similar to Fulcrum.

 

I?ve been following them for a while now and think they are doing a lot of
things right. They?re missing a few components that are important for us,
e.g. full offline (for security) and support for a number of in-field
scenarios. It?s possible these features will be created over time. The
proprietary nature of Fulcrum would tend to turn off some potential groups
in the same way as it occasionally has for us. 

 

So far, we have not seen meaningful support for low literate users in any
major product. As more and more folks have smart phones, this may pick up. 

 

Cheers,

-Justin

Hi Justin

 

I think your project seems a little bit similar to http://fulcrumapp.com/
http://fulcrumapp.com/features/  for field data collection, maybe just
missing the part for people who can read or write

 

What they do is capture data using custom forms on the field and then you
sync over the internet on the cloud, once on a computer you can export the
data to use with GIS software and create PDF reports

 

Probably a similar approach?

Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] CyberTracker integration

That?s true, I missed the concept of a form in the description on the site. 

 

My interest is in a rich, user friendly data capture experience, especially
for cases where the field user is not a QGIS user and may not be able to
read or write. Our studies indicate that this is also a more efficient way
to capture data for literate users. Over the years we?ve rolled our own
mini-GIS for the desktop, but the scalability of this approach is clearly
limited. Since we?re a non-profit and in the process of opening our code, it
makes sense to leverage an existing system. Of the solutions I have
investigated, QGIS seems most aligned at the technical level.

 

We do bring some interesting work to the table. Our client supports Windows
Mobile and Android and has a large library of customizable UI components
which can capture many different data types, including images and sound.
There is also support for timer tracks and a field map.

 

I?m pretty new to the Open Source community, so apologies if this is off.
I?m probably going about this all wrong.

I updated the latest versions of QGIS (Master) and SAGA GIS (2.1.0) on Arch
Linux, however I have seen errors when running commands of SAGA from Sextante,
since it has been removed the prefix "lib" in the SAGA modules. The
solution has been to remove the prefix "lib" (lines 240, 307 and 356) from
file SagaAlgorithm.py [1].

I think this information is useful for Linux users who start using the
latest version of SAGA GIS.

Hi Borys,

Thank you for the reply to my concerns. I am inclined to agree with you
now. There really was no reason to change most of those settings icons, or
depart from the color palette of the GIS theme.

Denis, I have replied in your pull request [0]. Basically, I think, as
Borys and Anita, that the icons need to maintain color consistency and
style. IMO this is not the time to be departing from the theme, especially
for icons that did not have any usability issues (though obviously you have
solved some existing icon issues, i.e. ).

Concerning whether there are existing SVG source files for all current PNGs
in the GIS theme, I asked Reobert a while ago and he said all of his work
is in the OSGeo graphics repository. Evidently some of the source files for
QGIS icons had pixel-based components, i.e. there are a percentage of GIS
theme icons that need to be vectorized.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] layer toolbar icons
Message-ID: <51DB601A.3020808@szczepanek.pl>

Hi,

Following Denis and other's efforts on better icons [1] I want to 
propose extreme simplification. In layer toolbar we have 8-9 icons with 
'add layer' in context. Let's skip this redundant part (add action and 
layer in background) from the graphics. Missing database icons for 
Oracle and MS SQL are in [2], and simplified W*S icons are in [3]. There 
are more colours, but still in the same palette.

'Add vector layer' and 'add raster layer' icons probably should be left 
with only 'layer' sign, as it will be more consistent with 'create 
vector layer'.
We should leave also 'create' and 'remove' action icons with layer 
background in this set.

Nice PostGIS and SQLite icons by Denis are almost ready. I would just 
add them colours.
Original add CSV icon (with two fields on both sides of comma) is better 
for me, as comma itself will look very lonely :)
I can make original version bigger and remove 'import' action.

I'm not sure, but your version Denis look blurry. Are you aligning 
objects to grid or is it due to increased line width?

Thank you Denis and others for your effort in making QGIS nicer!

best regards,
Robert

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Python] splitGeometry
Message-ID: <51DBF0D5.7080304@jena.de>

Hi,

I am trying to split a geometry (polygon) with a line, the line is 
straight and crossing the polygon's boundary exactly twice; here is my code:

result,  newGeometries,  topoTestPoints = 
myGeometry.splitGeometry(splitterPList, True)

the result is 0 (OK) but newGeometries contains only _one_ polygon. I 
was under the impression that newGeometries would contain _all_ polygons 
resulting from the split operation, i.e. the two halves at each side of 
the line.
If this is the intended behaviour I think I can make a workaround with 
myGeometry.difference(newGeometries[0]), if it is not I will file a ticket.

Bernhard

Hi Bernard,

If I remember well, when you do myGeom.splitGeometry, it returns the 
splitted geometry which is removed from myGeom.
So basically, you do have both parts.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Denis,

thank you for the hint. It's true (newGeometries is misleading, though)
so for anyone interested, here is the relevant part of my code:

#split geometry
result, newGeometries, topoTestPoints =
myGeometry.splitGeometry(splitterPList, True)

#update the original feature
myFeature.setGeometry(myGeometry)
myLayer.updateFeature(myFeature)
# create new features for all new geometries
for aGeom in newGeometries:
   newFeature = QgsFeature()
   newFeature.setAttributes(myFeature.attributes())
   myLayer.addFeature(newFeature)

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7HPFJ37BqB9JsN8KFOC9icybWssKQfYUtLEOXaQ1EjcA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I usually use ogr2ogr whenever I want to load several shapefile in the same
PostGIS table. I have recently seen that the import tool has an option "Add
data to a layer" in the Action groupbox. But I cannot use it since it
remains greyed out whatever the options I choose (selection a schema then
an existing table in the comboboxes).

Is this feature already working or should I stay with ogr2ogr --append for
a while ?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Thanks Paolo for your prompt answer.

The idea was to show a simple way for end-users. I will tell them to use
the "Vector > Merge shapefile" tool, and then import the merged shapefile
with DbManager (or via drag and drop from the browser)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] map rendering time much longer on windows than on
	ubuntu
Message-ID: <51DC0440.9070106@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed that QGIS renders much slower on windows than on ubuntu.

This is the configuration:
Windows 7 64 bits
QGIS master from Osgeo4W
vs
Ubuntu 12.04 64its
QGIS compiled on computer

The windows computer is more recent and powerful than ubuntu's one.
I have mainly PostGIS layers.

Is it a know issue/problem/feature whatever?
Is there something I can do to speed up????

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Apart from a dozen things influencing the rendering speed on a 
particular machine mostly related to the datasource (e.g. network/disk 
speed...), the binary itself can also be optimized by not including the 
debug symbols.

But to be accurate, one would need to do a more in-depth profiling of 
the problem...

Hi,

Another difference, besides debug vs. no-debug, may be the qt version.
The QGIS installers for Windows still use qt version 4.7, while most
modern Linux distributions use version 4.8. Version 4.8 may have some
performance improvements?

Maybe that explains some of the difference.

Just a wild guess,
Andreas

What circumstances do exist, where we are not be able to determine the 
native type based upon QgsField metainformation, but without using 
typeName?

I think we should focus on the development on an unambiguous type 
schema (QgsFields) and only use the typeName (with provider 
information?) as a very last resort.

We could then introduce a method QgsField::canConvertTo( QgsField& 
other ) and let this method return yes / yes with constraints (as you 
described, truncate, round etc) / no.
Right now, the QgsFields::operator== is abused for this operation, but 
it's not really accurate, like a number of bugs (FieldCalculator leaves 
you with a column full of NULL's after saving) have shown already. I 
already introduced this patch [1] to deal with the current state.
I'm not sure if in addition to precision and length another field 
number of bits or bytes should be introduced? (I'm not familiar enought 
with the providers to answer this question, but I remember having seen 
INT8, INT16 etc. datatypes)

Additionally, these fields (precision, length, bytes) should also be 
able to carry information like "not applicable" or "unlimited", so 
canConvertTo knows, if it needs to compare these fields also or compare 
them in a special way.
E.g. String types won't need "precision"
E.g. String types can have length unlimited

Matthias

Hi Justin, I'm using both programs (well, actually, just starting with
cybertracker)
(I'm the one who collaborated to solvve the problem of running CT on Mac)

I think you should keep CT as simple as possible, not only because of
the low-literate users but also because in the field
you want to have what you need and only what you need. The CT approach
in which you design your own template is very good.
What I can see as an advantage is an efficient way of trasnfering the
info collected with CT to Qgis, perhaps through a spatialite object
or some other open spatial database. But I would not add gis capabilites to CT.

Regarding the ability of having more mapping capabilities in the
field, I wonder if you could make use of Oruxmaps, it
works very well on Android, I use it a lot in the field and for
navigating the aerial campaigns.

Hi,

I had a look at the current defaults for toolbars and panels. A new user of 
QGIS 2.0 should not be overwhelmed with too many buttons and windows, but we 
should guide him to find important features like the embedded browser. In my 
opinion there are some defaults which could be optimized to reach this goal.

Toolbars:
-Turn off Advanced Digitizing
-Move Label to second row

Panels:
-Turn on Layer order and Browser in a tabbed view with Layers

Print composer:
-Place all toolbars in one row

Regards
Pirmin

IMHO Layer order is an advanced feature and should be hidden by default -
novice users are heavily confused by the fact that the legend order and the
render order can be managed separately.

afaik

the layer order actually is hiding but the "control rendering order
checkbox is enabled"
This is quite confusing for an user.

I guess the better is hide and "control rendering order disable" by default.

agreed. as for the rest:

* Browser on, tabbed with Layers
* all Print composer toolbars in one row
* no strong opinion about placement of Label

As for the Toolbar Advanced Digitizing, I'm unsure about hiding it: newbies could
easily miss important tools. It would be good to hide all digitizing tools unless
digitizing is on.

Thanks for raising this.

In case anyone missed it:  scripts/mkuidefaults.py produces
src/app/ui_defaults.h from the current settings.

So updating it should be easy, once it's decides what should be the default.

Not sure if the data contains pixel coordinates and if the screen resolution
might therefore be an issue...

Hi all,

Thanks for your reply.

I have noticed it seems that postgres request are much longer from the 
win computer than from ubuntu (on the same external server of course).

I timed this request:
Ubuntu: 100% about 45 ms
Win: 50-70% about 45ms, 30-50% between 250 and 700ms, sometime even more.

I googled without finding anything relevant...
Have someone experience something similar?


Also, I'd like to try to remove the debug info.
Is the correct way to do this: in environment variables: add a 
QGIS_DEBUG variable with -1 value in the user variables?

Cheers,

Denis

That would still produce the output, but not show it.  Not sure if the pure
production alone also has a noticable impact.

But the production of the output doesn't really explain, why the same requests
are sometimes slower.  Maybe looking at the output would help here ;)

Otherwise getting rid of debugging output completely would require a Release
build (which would not include -DQGISDEBUG).

Hi all.
On current master, example R scripts apparently run without issues, but no output is
shown in the Results window. The resulting html is of the type:

<font face="courier">
<h2> R Output</h2>
</font>

or

<img src="/tmp/sextante/rrasterhistogram18a1cdc6d0734098bc728452ee90d3a6.html.png"/>

but the png is not there.
Any suggestion?
All the best.

Yes, Filipe reported that and I hope I can fix it soon. I didn't have
much time these last days, but let's see if I can work on it later
today. Sorry for that

Thanks for your help!

Victor

p.s. One question: Is R 3.0 now more common than 2.x among R users?
Should we make 3.0 the target version in SEXTANTE?

Hi Otto,

Thank you for pointing this out. Isn't this just a warning?

If you have a good test project with smaller data to share I am happy to
replace it with a smaller project.

I just did not have the time to work on the sample project.

Anyway - the file could be checked out by hand or it can just be ignored.

According to the release notes R > 3.0 should be faster than previous
versions with "big data" so I guess it would make sense to make it the
target version. However, most R users tend to wait a while to update. Would
it be to difficult to support both R>3.0 and R < 3 ?

Hi Andreas,

for 50M to 100M you get a warning, but the HYP_50M_SR_W.tif is 166.94 MB and
that's too much. For both files I resampled output files from 0.03 to 0.08 degree
pixel resolution. That is 4500 x 2250 instead of 10800, 5400 pixel. Still
sufficient I think.

Both would now be below 50M of size. Is that ok? Then I would commit the
changes.

Regards
Otto

Hi

I know gh recently reduced their maximum hosted file size - see

Hi,

thanks for the link. Here is the content in short:

"GitHub warns you when you push a file larger than 50 MB. We'll reject pushes
containing files larger than 100 MB. We do this for a few reasons."

To fix the problem, you'll first want to remove the large file from git:

# Stage our giant file for removal, but leave it on disk
git rm --cached giant_file

# Amend the previous commit with your change
# Simply making a new commit won't work, as you need to remove the file from
# the # unpushed history as well
git commit --amend -CHEAD

# Push our rewritten, smaller commit
git push

I can do that and apply the smaller, resampled files, if that's ok.

Regards
Otto

Hi J?rgen,

Effectively, I noticed the postgres difference from the command line, so 
nothing related to QGIS...I'll try to investigate the question with our IT .
The problem is that QGIS is almost unusable in these conditions, with 
rendering time of about 2s!

Is there an easy way to produce a windows installer? By easy I mean from 
my compilation environment on ubuntu? Or do I need to compile on Windows?


Thanks,

Denis

Hi Augustin,

Yes, I recall. Thanks, that was good work!

I'll take a look at OruxMaps and Spatialite. 

We often get queries to add more GIS functionality to CyberTracker both for
the desktop and the PDA. While it would be nice to keep it simple, it seems
like over time people will want to do more and more away from their desktop.
Especially as we start seeing tablets which are about as fast as desktops
from a few years ago. 

Cheers,
-Justin

Hi Justin, I'm using both programs (well, actually, just starting with
cybertracker)
(I'm the one who collaborated to solvve the problem of running CT on Mac)

I think you should keep CT as simple as possible, not only because of the
low-literate users but also because in the field you want to have what you
need and only what you need. The CT approach in which you design your own
template is very good.
What I can see as an advantage is an efficient way of trasnfering the info
collected with CT to Qgis, perhaps through a spatialite object or some other
open spatial database. But I would not add gis capabilites to CT.

Regarding the ability of having more mapping capabilities in the field, I
wonder if you could make use of Oruxmaps, it works very well on Android, I
use it a lot in the field and for navigating the aerial campaigns.

Hi all.
What is supposed to do this command? I cannot see an effect.
BTW: shipping hundreds of complex tools without any documentation is really
embarrassing, perhaps we should find a way to fix it.
All the best, and thanks.

I update QGIS master on Windows/Osgeo4W, downloaded SAGA 2.1 and
configured properly SEXTANTE to use it.

I have not success running any SAGA raster module (ex: split rgb
bands, supervised classification). For what it matters my installation
noe fails to run also OTB modules (that previously worked without
issues, like kmean unsupervised classification).

I'm missing something?

thanks in advance

Hey Giovanni, when you say "any" raster module...it means those two
ones only? supervised classification has changed in SAGA 2.1, so it
shouldn't work, and split rgb is a very special module, not actually a
SAGA one, but one that relies on some SAGA funcitonality...

Do you have problems with other algorithms? I just tested some
geomorphoometry ones and they were working fine.

Thanks for your report!

you are right, I was too fast saying "any", anyway I have issue with a
few modules I tested (like tri, tpi, vrm) and not with others (slope,
aspect, curvature). It seems that others do not have issues also with
OTB, so maybe it is a local issue, but I don't know what it can be.

Please, if you can make a list of those modules that have changed and
now do not work, it will be of great help. I planned to do a diff with
the module description that SAGA produces...but the output format has
changed, so this is not a good solution  :-(

Message-ID: <CAKWoFMJCkOZ340Excs6_RMtmPTvdJ4YXCRzDdcJ3DpwvNgCREA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a python plugin and I found a "bug" in Plugin Manager.
I found out that QGIS is not loading the plugin from QGIS_PLUGINPATH.
That's because that plugin is not enabled and mentioned in QSettings().
The actual problem is that plugins in QGIS_PLUGINPATH are not appearing in
the Plugin Manager so those cannot be enabled.

Do you confirm this? Do I file a bug report?


I managed to get my plugin loaded when I manually added the needed setting
in windows registry.


BR,

Lauri

Didn't know that. Updated the script to support composer UI defaults.

I've reported a change in the command of intersection of polygons in SAGA
GIS v2.1, I have also tried to build a patch for correction:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8239

"In the new API SAGA GIS v2.1 has changed overlapping polygons, now the
"Polygons Intersects" function is divided into six separate functions:
Intersect, Identify, Difference, Symmetrical Difference, Union and Update.

I attached the path with the new SAGA descriptions of the six features for
Sextante, So I think it is not necessary the PolygonIntersection.txt file."

Regards,

Samuel Mesa.

Couple of other ideas comments, too:

* Currently there are no side toolbars by default. Many apps utilize the
left side toolbar for critical tools. To me, such tools in a GIS app are
the canvas navigation tools. So whenever I to an initial setup of QGIS, I
always put the Map Navigation toolbar on the left.

* Similarly, I always place the Plugins toolbar on the right side. There is
currently a bug that sets that toolbar to not be shown on a default install
(that should be fixed).

I would like to hear feedback on those two suggestions for default side
toolbars. Following your suggestions (and mine), the default window would
look similar to this (on Mac) [0].

+1 for removing Advanced Digitizing toolbar as a default, as all of the
functions are available in the Edit menu already. If needed, the user can
show that toolbar.

Another major layout issue is what the layout looks like after turning on
all core plugins [1]. Then, what it looks like when all those plugin
toolbars are shown [2]. This needs some work.

Having the nav toolbar on the side would be ideal if you could dock it on
the right side of the layers panel.  I'm not a fan of having to go all the
way over the layer panel to access the navigation tools.

That's a very good point. What about the Navigation toolbar on the right,
with the Plugin toolbar filling the empty space at right on the first row
of horizontal toolbars?

Here's my reasoning. Nav tools are quickly accessible, and when a new user
downloads/installs a plugin, there is already space to show it (assuming
that plugin loads a tool button into the Plugins toolbar). Then the user
can move toolbars to their liking.

Any other ideas?

I think on the right is fine. To me that feels better that all the way over
on the left.

It's a real bugger that we can't make Qt dock the toolbars inside something
else, seems you are constrained to QMainWindow.

+1 to hide it, someone might find it useful but most users will associate layer order with visibility/rendering?

IMHO Layer order is an advanced feature and should be hidden by default - novice users are heavily confused by the fact that the legend order and the render order can be managed separately.

I've never liked side bar tools but since I will be able to move it I wouldn't be unhappy if that's the default ?

Didn't know that. Updated the script to support composer UI defaults.

Couple of other ideas comments, too:

* Currently there are no side toolbars by default. Many apps utilize the left side toolbar for critical tools. To me, such tools in a GIS app are the canvas navigation tools. So whenever I to an initial setup of QGIS, I always put the Map Navigation toolbar on the left.

* Similarly, I always place the Plugins toolbar on the right side. There is currently a bug that sets that toolbar to not be shown on a default install (that should be fixed).

I would like to hear feedback on those two suggestions for default side toolbars. Following your suggestions (and mine), the default window would look similar to this (on Mac) [0].

+1 for removing Advanced Digitizing toolbar as a default, as all of the functions are available in the Edit menu already. If needed, the user can show that toolbar.

Another major layout issue is what the layout looks like after turning on all core plugins [1]. Then, what it looks like when all those plugin toolbars are shown [2]. This needs some work.

Could we add the possibility to close toolbars by undocking them and hitting an x in the window

I prefer the right for navigation than left

Here's my reasoning. Nav tools are quickly accessible, and when a new user downloads/installs a plugin, there is already space to show it (assuming that plugin loads a tool button into the Plugins toolbar). Then the user can move toolbars to their liking.

Any other ideas?

Didn't know that. Updated the script to support composer UI defaults.

Couple of other ideas comments, too:

* Currently there are no side toolbars by default. Many apps utilize the left side toolbar for critical tools. To me, such tools in a GIS app are the canvas navigation tools. So whenever I to an initial setup of QGIS, I always put the Map Navigation toolbar on the left.

* Similarly, I always place the Plugins toolbar on the right side. There is currently a bug that sets that toolbar to not be shown on a default install (that should be fixed).

I would like to hear feedback on those two suggestions for default side toolbars. Following your suggestions (and mine), the default window would look similar to this (on Mac) [0].

+1 for removing Advanced Digitizing toolbar as a default, as all of the functions are available in the Edit menu already. If needed, the user can show that toolbar.

Another major layout issue is what the layout looks like after turning on all core plugins [1]. Then, what it looks like when all those plugin toolbars are shown [2]. This needs some work.

Hi all,

Finally, it was due to a bad configuration of the network card. Requests 
take the same time, but QGIS is still a bit slower.
I will try to have a version without debug symbols.

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all,

During a map redraw, the canvas gets blank (white) on windows while it 
keeps the previous (current) image on linux.
I prefer a lot linux behavior.

Is this something related to Qt and nothing can be done about it?

AFAIK, this is a problem with the qgis package.
The OTB package is in sync with current gdal package, the Qgis package
needs a rebuild.

libgdal1 does not exists anymore.

Hi all.
Maybe I'm missing something here, so I apologize beforehand. I think we could improve
the general situation with documentation and help. The application is growing a lot,
and it is proving very difficult to maintain and translate all this material. I know
the style of a manual can be different from what one could expect from an Help
button, but I believe the differences can be rather minor, and the advantages are huge.
This would also solve the issue from where I started, i.e. sextante help.
In short, I suggest to:
* remove the current Help content
* point the help button to the relevant page of the manual
* distribute the manual together with qgis
* remove the tab Help from sextante algs
* add an Help button, as with any other dialog of the app.
All the best.

Hello,

I uploaded a plugin to the repository a few weeks ago for approval. Is there
anything else I need to do before the plugin is checked over? 

My plugin zooms the map extent to a given UK postcode.

Hey Matthew,

I have approved it now.  I would suggest changing the icon and updating as
much of the plugin information as you can.  If you can it's best to create
a git repo somewhere, like on github, to house your code so that people can
send you bug fixes if need be.

Thanks Matthias,
in fact, disabling backbuffer and enabling back again results in no crash.
Rather elusive.
All the bets.

I have started having a look at this...and It seems to be working on 3.0...

I am on windows and both raster and vector algorithms are working, It
installed all needed packages on first execution, and now it all works
fine.

I fixed a bug in the way the R intallation is tested, but I guess that
was not a big issue (it was only a windows problem)

The problems seems to be related to libraries being installed...but
then not available. I am not an expert on R, and the code to install
libraries autoatically was contributed by someone else. Maybe you can
guide me on this? Any idea about how to ensure that the needed
libraries are installed?

I can try to improve the error messages, so if that happens, the users
sees a message saying "The R algorithm you have executed needs a
library that is not available. Please install library XXX manually in
your R distribution"

What do you think?

Hi Victor,
I'm not sure this is my problem: even the supersimple
hist(as.matrix(layer))
fails.
All the best.

even that simple one requires rgdal, which is installed by SEXTANTE if
not already installed. Could you send the R log file so I can see
what's going on?

thanks!

so we have found the problem....but now we have to fix it :-) that lib
is supposed to be installed by SEXTANTE automatically. There must be a
lib path issue...

Hi,

The problem occurs even with maptools and rgdal installed. I tried running
"create regular sampling grid" and only a generic error message was shown.

The packages are there, but Sextante apparently cant find them

mmm, SEXTANTE doesn't have to find them...it's R that uses them.
Someone mentioned in the past a problem with packages paths...but my
knowledge of R is limited, so I don't know what I can do... :-(

Please, if you know how to fix the aoutomated installation of
packages, let me know. I can do work on the SEXTANTE side, but on the
R side i am very limited....

Thanks!

IMHO this should be left to the user: in different systems the installation may be
different, one user may prefer to install from packages, one to compile, etc.

I think a simple warning "Please install package YYYYY" should be enough.
Thanks.

This is weird. Before i upgraded to R 3.0 it worked, but now it doesnt.
Even more weird is that on Paolo's system it works and on mine doesnt.

Donovan Cameron shared some insights on the bug report. Perhaps he can help
you understand better whats going on.

Regards

probably you have to recompile your libs. update.packages() is your friend here.
So the message should be "Install or update your packages".
All the best.

Its working now.

My R version is 3.0.1 and Sextante was working with R 3.0.0 packages which
apparently caused this problem.

I went to ~/qgs2/sextante and deleted the folder "rlibs" which forced
Sextante to reinstall "its packages".

So the problem was that I upgraded R after running R-Sextante for the first
time.

I dont expect users to regularly update R but there should a warning or a
way to Sextante upgrade its core packages.

Thanks for the help

Hi guys,
Speaking of R, would it be worth adding some maintenance scripts? e.g. 

update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)

and even:

if(!require(installr)) { 
install.packages("installr"); require(installr)} #load / install+load installr
updateR()

I'm not much of an R guy - maybe there are other things too.

Regards,
Alister

Hi guys,
I agree with Antonio on both counts.  With the layers panel on the left it seems more natural to have the navigation toolbar on the right side of the window.  
And yes, if it is possible to have a titlebar on floating toolbars that would make it much easier to close toolbars you don't want (sometimes it isn't at all obvious which toolbar you are looking at, so you have to go through turning them on and off one at a time until you find the right one).

Also, I think this has been suggested previously, but personally I don't think the File or the Manage Layers toolbars should be on by default.  They aren't like some of the other toolbars which you need to frequently switch between different tools, they contain functions which users naturally look for in the right place in the menu, and in the case of the Manage Layers toolbar I suspect that even for experienced users it is much faster to find the right tool in the layer menu than it is to figure out which icon in the toolbar is the one they want.

Regards,
Alister

Don't agree. I can't see this getting removed and if they were it would
hurt user experience more the help it I feel. I'm an experienced user and I
use the toolbar all the time, it's faster then navigating a menu which is
why they are there.

I'm not a friend of a toolbar on the right side, because it's too far away 
when the Sextante toolbox is displayed.
I propose to put the layer toolbar on the left side. This will feel quite new 
for most users, but it makes sense to have it at the side of the layers panel 
and the browser which also has an "add layer" functionality.
+1 for activating the plugin toolbar filling empty space.

So it is possible to get the toolbar inside the map canvas area by changing
the central widget to a QMainWindow and adding the toolbar to that.

So you end up with:

QMainWindow (QGIS Main Window)
 - QWidget (CentralWidget)
 -- QLayout
 ----QMainWindow
 ------ QToolbar
 ------ MapCavnas

http://i.imgur.com/85ggkiF.png

However you loss the ability to dock out side of the map canvas, and there
is a strange rendering issue with the toolbar.  It could work with some
magic but I think it would be pretty hacky.

So, going with your suggestion of having Manage Layers toolbar on left, and
Plugins toolbar filling space to right of Help toolbar, the layout would
look like this [0] (using latest icons from Denis [1]).

+1 for this as default layout.

Couple of things need some work:

* The New Spatialite Layer needs a new icon, and its icon added to the
toolbar

* When all other core plugins are turned on (that have a add or new layer
function) it looks confusing, like this [2] (after a restart). To fix, just
need to ensure the Oracle and SQL Anywhere (also needs new icon) icons go
before the W*S icons and the New GPX Layer goes before the Remove Layer
icon. This way, the icon grouping continues to make sense: Add, New, Remove.

* Help icon looks a little too dominant, or possible too far off-style.

I would be happy with that layout.

I love those new icons Denis!

Hi,

Just a quick note about recent updates for both 10.6 and 10.7-8 Mac nightly
builds [0]:

* Note: Boths nightlies now using SpatiaLite 4.0.0
* Kyngchaos.com GDAL Complete-1.10 (2013-05-01, must update your local
install)
* Qt 4.8.5 / sip 4.14.7 / PyQt4 4.10.2 / QScintilla2 2.7.2 (bundled)
* MySQL Client 5.6.12 Qt plugin (for eVis plugin support, bundled)
* libspatialindex 1.8.1 (bundled)
* 10.6-only: Qwt 6.0.2 (bundled)

Both builds are now basically using the same supporting libs now (Postgres
client is still 9.1 on 10.6).

William, the issues with Spatialite 4.0.0 still persist [1]. Maybe having
your SQLite framework updated to Spatialite 4.1.1 before trying to track
down those errors might be prudent?

I don't see any compatibility-breaking changes (would require new framework version and rebuild of everything), so I'll work on it over the weekend.

Hello,

I have built qgis 1.8 final release from source  on Centos6.  When I run make check, I get failures in qgis_rasterlayertest and qgis_rendererstest.  These failures are the result of raster anomalies that do not match the expected raster anomalies stored in testdata.  The raster anomalies  are in many cases similar too (but a bit worse than) the expected windows anomalies.  The anomalies are as follows:

Continuous_result_diff.png
Graduated_result_diff.png
Landsat_875_result_diff.png
Landsat_basic_result_diff.png
Raster_pseudo_result_diff.png
Raster_result_diff.png
Single_result_diff.png
Uniquevalue_result_diff.png

I added these raster anomalies to tests/testdata/control_images/[test case], and that did eliminate the unittest failures as a result of anomalies not matching any expected anomalies.  However, my unittests still fail after the anomaly match as a result of bandStatistics

QDEBUG : TestQgsRasterLayer::landsatBasic875Qml() Expected size: 120w x 120h
QDEBUG : TestQgsRasterLayer::landsatBasic875Qml() Actual   size: 120w x 120h

   Loc: [/pse/edv/hil/src/qgis/18release/qgis-1.8.0/tests/src/core/testqgsrasterlayer.cpp(177)]

When I ran qgis_rasterlayertest through gdb,  this mean value was found to be 4.

Qgis is linking yum installed libpng 1.2.49.


1.       Are the anomalies a feature of the system, and just need to be added to testdata, or are they manifestations of a bug?

2.       What can I do about the bandStatistics error? Is this going to cause bad behavior in qgis, or is only going to effect image quality?

3.       Might this be coming from a library dependency?


Thanks,

MonsterMushroom

Message-ID: <CAG4NRe+ZfVx1kx3=jcFYBsXdV--R0CEZrkz6O+C1Yi-MaDB1GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Because of the broken dependencies of the nightly-build, just compiled
qgis master under linuxmint 15, which is based on ubuntu raring.

I followed
http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc3

with the following changes/additions/notes:

1 I installed dependencies for precise (no newer versions recorded in
that page...)
2. sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
3. ccmake ..
Changed:
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/apps
QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/qmake-qt4
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so

4. After make and make install, I try
$HOME/apps/bin/qgis
/home/alobo/apps/bin/qgis: error while loading shared libraries:
libqgis_core.so.1.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

but libqgis_core.so.1.9.0 has just been installed under ${HOME}/apps/lib, thus
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/alobo/apps/lib

and qgis works (somehow, though: it's a dev version)

Hi guys I hope I'm not to late for the lunch,

I have attached a (mature draft) Rscript that check if all needed packages
are installed (needed because in the given rscript.rsx there are some
"require(..." or "library(...")
One my Linux it works fine.
Note that it currently doesn't check for SEXTANTE R default packages as
raster/rgdal... but it would be no problem to add them by default.
Currently it installs to the default lib location (so you need to have
write access (in the R promt if the folder does not exist R asks you if you
want to create a libloc where you have write access, this could be
problematic and this is probably the reason for the sextante /R lib loc?,
if this is a problem, I can use the sextante R lib loc).

Depending on where you save these files the command is:
R CMD BATCH "--args ~/exampleScriptNotOk.rsx" ~/checkPac.R
R CMD BATCH "--args ~/exampleScriptOk.rsx" ~/checkPac.R

This command should be started on every Rscripr.rsx execution before the
real execution as it tries to make sure thet the packages requirement are
all ok. If no installation is required it is very fast, here 1/3 of a sec.
see ceckPac.Rout for the full execution log

If this method is an option some testing from your side would be great!
This is only a suggestion, ant it can be easily addapted/changed/enhanced.

Matteo

Thanks for your help

After some thinking and discussion, I think that the best and easiest
solutions is just to have a separate SEXTANTE environment, with its
own libPath. This is the current configuration, but it was not
correctly set, so libs were installed tere, but not used from there
later. With Donovan's solution, this wil be easy to fix.

The R connector in SXTANTE is supposed to be used by people that can
use R and write R scripts, so I guess we can let them add the
necessary install commands for their scripts. SEXTANTE will just take
care of rgdal, since that is used very often.

What I will try to do is:
- document this in detail in the manual
- improve the error handling, so if the R script cannot be run due to
a missing dependency, SEXTANTE will inform the user. For this, your
scripts might be useful.

I want to treat the R scripts much in the same way as the Python
scripts. If you need a lib (other that the ones installed with QGIS),
you have to install it yourself, modify the PYTHONPATH add the import
sentences, etc...and I assume that you know Python well enough to take
care of that. The same goes with R scripts. By having a separate R
environment, I guess this is easier and also it will not interfere in
the "normal" usage of R outside SEXTANTE. And we also get rid of the
problem of not having priviledges to install new packages, since all
goes to the home folder.

What do you think of this?

Thanks again!
Victor

I strongly prefer to install needed R libs at the system level, not in user path.
At very least, sextante should warne the user and ask for confirmation before
installing R libs. In that case, I would skip that and go to the system, installing
all what is needed.
All the best.

Hi devs,

I am pretty new in QGis and very interested in help to decrease the number
of opened issues on bug tracking system.

Currently QGis issues has the following statistics:

Bugs

31 opened bugs with Blocker priority
37 opened bugs with High priority
661 opened bugs with Normal priority
243 opened bugs with Low priority

Features

1 opened features requests with Blocker priority
13 opened features requests with High priority
394 opened features requests with Normal priority
310 opened features requests with Low priority

Because the high number of opened issues it's hard to a beginner choose the
"right issues" (bugs/features) that really need atention.

I am skilled in C, C++ and Python and ready to try to contribute with QGis
community.


I look forward to hearing from you, the "right directions" that I should go
to.

Hey Daniel,

What you have done is great. The blocker and high ones should be the focus
at the moment so we can get the release out. However if you find something
else that you think you can tackle by all means have a go.  We are in
feature freeze at the moment so only bug fixes.

- Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Splash screen for 2.0
Message-ID: <CALCNqkaLHqC+KbvT86PfhJmUX3PLf+2XJA_GYg3mzxYXnWNDXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If you are a daily blocker list [1] watcher you will have noticed that
Juergen Fischer (aka our resident coding machine) has been whittling the
list down  - 31 issues left as I write this.

Juergen has been funded for two weeks - one week each from the Swiss QGIS
Users Group and QGIS.org's fund). If you have been contemplating sponsoring
QGIS, there is never a better time to do it as we use the money to fund
activities such as these which are a huge step in helping us to produce
good quality releases.

Based on his progress I expect we should be ready to release before
FOSS4G2013 (yay!). We need to decide on two things:

* A name for the release
* A map for the splash screen

These should be in a similar vein to the splash and name for QGIS 1.8
'Lisboa'. Since the next Hackfest after Lisbon was Zurich I am proposing
that we name this release after an interesting place in Zurich. To avoid
trademark etc issues I would prefer we use a little know place - also one
that non german speakers have a vague hope of being able to pronounce. As
such could I ask our hosts from Zurich to proffer a suitable name and a
nice old map that we can use for the splash screen?

Many thanks

Tim

Hi Victor,
Having a separated libloc causes also a maintenance problem, as the libs in
there can only be updated (with ease) by SEXTANTE, that does not (?) update
them. I also think that it is better to have everything on system level but
there are also environments where a user has no writing privileges outside
its user space and a user libloc is required (this does R by default in
such a case, but it asks the user to create that dir if it doesn't already
exits, and R re-connects to that user libloc every time it starts with the
same user).

So except for the problem (esily to solve) of permissions and user libloc I
would stay within R defaults.

I think that SEXTANTE offers a good place to share scripts, _especially_
for non R experts (like the example scripts). I.e. I create an R-script
that my colleagues can use without knowing R. I think this is one of the
great things of SEXTANTE!

I think it is (quite) easily possible to remove the need of R knowledge for
a lot of situations, one of these it the installation and update of
packages. It is much easier to share a Rscript (rsx) to another system if
not installed packages are added automatically.

It could be interesting to have also a online repository of RSX scripts,
isn't every R-script is a bit like a plugin!?

Cheers, Matteo

hi I remember a discussion we had with tim last month in South Africa. I
Suggested that. he thought was too hard in english.
I then suggested "Dufour".  beside being a very influencial swiss
cartographer [1] it is also the highest mountain in switzerland.

i think it would be very representative for the whole swiss community.

Ok, fine then. Only in the canonical libpath. :-)

>I think it is (quite) easily possible to remove the need of R knowledge for a lot of situations, one of these it the installation and update of packages. It is much easier to share a Rscript (rsx) to another system if not installed packages are added automatically.

I agree with that, but what I mean is that the person that writes the
script should take care of all the installation/checking/etc code. He
should put all that sanity code in his plugin, not expect SEXTANTE to
do it, because that makes things less fllexible, and it seems that we
cannot come to a good solution on that. That's what I meant. Of course
I like the idea of sharing scripts :-)

Cheers

+1 for Dufour!!!

Easily pronounced, and very representative!

A very good idea!

That would be a nice map on the summit:

Hi,

I also like the name "Dufour".

There are also the old "Dufour" maps: see http://s.geo.admin.ch/09751c84f

The problem is that the mountain called "Dufourspitze" is not yet on the
maps that Dufour initiated/created. It was only named after his name.

So - we could either use one of the old maps without the name
"Dufourspitze" or the current map and ask Swisstopo for permission to
use the new map.

I can volunteer to ask Swisstopo for permission. I have some good
connections. You just have to decide whether you want the old Dufour map
(black and white, old style) or the current map (current/new style).

Yes I guess it it the saver choice.

>>I think it is (quite) easily possible to remove the need of R knowledge
for a lot of situations, one of these it the installation and update of
packages. It is much easier to share a Rscript (rsx) to another system if
not installed packages are added automatically.

>I agree with that, but what I mean is that the person that writes the
script should take care of all the installation/checking/etc code. He
should put all that sanity code in his plugin, not expect SEXTANTE to
do it, because that makes things less flexible, and it seems that we
cannot come to a good solution on that. That's what I meant.

A script writer can care about the own environment but not so much on the
one of others (just the loading can be handled with ease). R it to much
modular it is not possible (for what I know) to provide a fully operation
plugin if a package is not available locally.
So probably every script need to have in its documentation which library
has to be present, and a reference to a doc on how to install libraries in
R. Probably this is a good solution.
Or/And SEXTANTE provides with a script like the one I have send you with
the capability to checkout for required packages. So if that script fails
(the info which library has to be loaded comes from the sript.rsx), the
info 'can not install package XXX' see doc... would help further to
manually install.
But as QGIS is now close to release (for what I know) it could be a
development that happens after that... (but I don't want to make pressure
on that!).

I'm always thinking of SEXTANTE as a possibility more for non R-users.

>Of course I like the idea of sharing scripts :-)
Great count on me! (for all these things!)

Yes I think Error handing (communication) is very important!
and also an update script could be made that could be started from the
SEXTANTE options and configuration.

Cheers

Hi Marco,

I've made some test about vectorJoins.

QGIS-Server doesn't provide joined attributes in GetFeatureInfo, 
DescribeFeatureType and GetFeature.

I thought it will be enough to add layer->updateFields to have access to 
joined attributes, but it's not enough and my vectorLayer has 
vectorJoins().size() > 0.

How can I activate vectorJoins ?

Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Hi Ren?-Luc

QGIS desktop has some logic during project loading to make sure the 
dependent layers are loaded as well. The server needs to do something 
similar (but it is not implemented currently).

Marco

Hi Marco,

Ok, it will be important to load the dependant layer.

Thanks

the square ones, very nice indeed and super packaging. I thought about it
but i don't  think it would be an issue.

There is also an old map called "Siegfriedkarte" which is based on the one from dufour and on this one the mountain is names "Dufourspitze".

http://s.geo.admin.ch/327b6cf7e

And it does not look that depressing as the b/w one.

Hi,

I also like the name "Dufour".

There are also the old "Dufour" maps: see http://s.geo.admin.ch/09751c84f

The problem is that the mountain called "Dufourspitze" is not yet on the
maps that Dufour initiated/created. It was only named after his name.

So - we could either use one of the old maps without the name
"Dufourspitze" or the current map and ask Swisstopo for permission to
use the new map.

I can volunteer to ask Swisstopo for permission. I have some good
connections. You just have to decide whether you want the old Dufour map
(black and white, old style) or the current map (current/new style).

A very good idea!

That would be a nice map on the summit:

To avoid trademark etc issues I would prefer we use a little know
place - also one that non german speakers have a vague hope of being
able to pronounce.

What about 'H?nggerberg' (the place where the developer meeting took
place) ?

Hi All

If you are a daily blocker list [1] watcher you will have noticed
that Juergen Fischer (aka our resident coding machine) has been
whittling the list down  - 31 issues left as I write this.

Juergen has been funded for two weeks - one week each from the Swiss
QGIS Users Group and QGIS.org<http://QGIS.org>'s fund). If you have been contemplating
sponsoring QGIS, there is never a better time to do it as we use the
money to fund activities such as these which are a huge step in
helping us to produce good quality releases.

Based on his progress I expect we should be ready to release before
FOSS4G2013 (yay!). We need to decide on two things:

* A name for the release
* A map for the splash screen

These should be in a similar vein to the splash and name for QGIS 1.8
'Lisboa'. Since the next Hackfest after Lisbon was Zurich I am
proposing that we name this release after an interesting place in
Zurich. To avoid trademark etc issues I would prefer we use a little
know place - also one that non german speakers have a vague hope of
being able to pronounce. As such could I ask our hosts from Zurich to
proffer a suitable name and a nice old map that we can use for the
splash screen?

Many thanks

Tim

Hi Daniel,
thanks for this; one possible alternative is to take the category you are most
familiar with, or interested on, and try to fix tickets in that area.
All the best.

Hi all.
While checking the bug queue, I noticed over 250 tickets are missing the Category
tag: this makes it less likely to spot duplicates, and makes the work of the bugfixer
more annoying: please reporter have a look, and help us classifying them in the
appropriate category.
Thanks.

I have the following output, where there is not SpatiaLite format available.

Do any maintenance scripts need to be in the SEXTANTE configuration?
I was suggesting just listing them in the sextante toolbox with any other R scripts.

Regarding users sharing their R scripts, shouldn't these be shared through the same infrastructure as python scripts and styles and whatever else?  Someone was working on that, weren't they?

Hello, I have a problem with this "new" version and the FileGDB (ESRI) plugin 
of the GDAL 1.10 framework  of William (Mac OS X Snow Leopard). I can write
a FileGDB folder but when I try to read it,  QGIS hangs.

Note that I have no problem with Python, both with ogr or Fiona (based on
ogr), even in the Python console of QGIS.

With a file geodatabase created with QGIS

Hey all,

In order to close another blocking issue off the list I would like to
propose that we run with the vector version of the current logo that has
been created in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6688.
This logo still looks the same but being vector will look much nicer. The
logo is currently used on Facebook, Google+, Flickr, GIS.SE, and looks
pretty good.

After 2.0 is out and we form a design group we can look at a more revamped
logo.

If everyone is happy with this logo I will go though and update all the old
logos with the new vector version so we can close that ticket.

+1  for agreeing on a logo across the board.

If vector proposal agreed, it'd also be a good opportunity to add high
resolution icons for application shortcuts on Win / Linux / OSX. By 2013,
qgis is the only low res icon on my desktop :)

Hi Stefan,

Good idea. This version - because the italian part is white, would even
leave some space for the QGIS logo ;-)

Who will design the splash screen?

Should I go ahead and ask Swisstopo for permission? I think that even
for the Dufour or Siegfried maps we should ask for permission. Even if
the copyright has expired.

+1 for using the vectorized logo for 2.0 release.

In addition to resolving this, it would be timely to address that the
standalone QGIS browser needs a distinct QGIS-based icon (see issue 5848
[0]). There are two versions noted on that page, but I think a different
badge, or maybe different color 'Q', is in order, to easily differentiate
the two apps when listed side-by-side at 16x16 in file system folder list
views.

The one I made has been in use in the Mac version for awhile, but I think
it is barely adequate when view in the Mac dock at smaller sizes. It would
be good to have several new versions to choose from.

Another nice addition to spatialite would be to add the liblwgeom support.
This is part of the postgis build, but can have its .so and headers files
moved to a different location (I believe) because it only links to
libgeos_c and libproj. However, I did not find liblwgeom-2.0.3.dylib in
your install for postgis 2.0.3.

Since the .dylib can be included standalone (after postgis is built) and
spatialite built against that, could you include liblwgeom in your SQLite3
framework (or maybe GEOS framework)? This would offer extra geometry
functions to spatialite [0] (especially the MakeValid function) without
requiring users to install the full postgres/postgis package.

Also, having worked with recent spatialite builds for the homebrew project,
I came across the nice additional XML functions for spatialite [1]. I did
not have issues building libspatialite against default libxml2 on Lion
(10.7.5), but spatialite-gui failed unless I built libspatialite against a
newer 2.9.x version of libxml2 [2]. 2.9.x version is recommended
(required?) for spatialite.

The xml functions could be used for the proposed QGIS project-as-db setup,
where the current project xml-formatted file could be directly stored in a
spatialite db, with minimal adjustment to existing project reading/writing
code.

Have you tried QGIS yet with Juergen's change to accept empty spatialite DBs?  It would be good to check if this works before trying Spatialite 4.1.

Maybe.  It's getting messy.  But, PostGIS is GPL, and I'd rather keep the whole framework non-GPL.  So it would have to be the standard full Postgres+PostGIS install, but then the framework becomes dependent on PostGIS (directly) and Postgres (indirectly).

I saw this addition to 4.1 and expect to build it in.  Looks like Mt Lion also has xml2 2.7.  Another messy addition if using xml2 2.9, but license is OK.

Hi

I took a look at the various maps linked to. I prefer this on:

http://s.geo.admin.ch/09751c84f

The large tracts of white in the Siegfriedkarte don't really work for me
and I find the above one much more visually interesting and not at all
depressing. I also do not think it matters that the word dufour does not

William

Juergen's fix from Friday of the problem loading empty tables and his fix from yesterday so that DB Manger now recognizes SpatiaLite version 4 metadata tables both work. Tested with Larry's nightly build from this morning. I can now create a new layer for editing and drag and in DB Manager dropping tables into either SpatiaLite version 3 or 4 databases works very well.

Since Larry is requesting features, I have one. It would be very useful to anybody on OS X that does much with SpatiaLite to have Spatialite_GUI available from your site. Would it take much additional effort to also build this when you build spatialite?

I don't mind the background idea, but I was just thinking why not get some
data of the area and make a map using QGIS itself for the splash.  We can
make some impressive looking maps now with all the great new features it
only seems fitting that we show them off in the splash screen.

It would be good to find a nice new modern font and change the colour as
that mockup makes me feel like I'm living in the 70s.  0_o

Message-ID: <1373842422.9915.YahooMailNeo@web122302.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm not sure if this is a bug, so I put here before opening a ticket.

I made a screencast to illustrate the situation: http://goo.gl/VPVe9

Basically, when I clean a filter created with Advanced Filter in the attribute table, and do apply, it does not show all the records again, and shows a parsing error. Doing the same with Column Filter, it works as expected.

Anyone confirm? Should I open a ticket?


Thanks.


Best regards,
Pedro

Hey Pedro,

Yeah it's a bug.  It's trying to eval an empty expression which can't
really work. The correct behavior would be to change the filter back to
Show All Features if the expression is null and the user presses Apply.

Can you file a ticket for this please.

Hi Nathan,

I just opened a ticket: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8297 


Thanks!

Best regards,

Hey Pedro,

Yeah it's a bug. ?It's trying to eval an empty expression which can't really work. The correct behavior would be to change the filter back to Show All Features if the expression is null and the user presses Apply.

Can you file a ticket for this please.

- Nathan?

I can confirm this works for my local builds as well (10.7.5). Spatialite 4
now seems to be mostly, if not completely, functional now. Thank you,

I, too, work with spatialite_gui as it is (I think) the best means for
working with spatialite dbs/tables. Unfortunately, it's gui is built off of
wxWidgets instead of Qt, i.e. an additional gui toolkit would need to be
installed with or alongside William's frameworks. However there is an easy
means of getting the latest versions of those, by using homebrew in an
isolated install directory [0].

I don't think it matters what gui toolkit it uses, as long as it works.  WxWidgets is simpler to bundle with an app and has a lot smaller footprint than Qt.  The main question is whether spatialite_gui works with wx 2.9, needed for a 64bit build, and for compiling at all on Mt Lion.

Yes. That's the wxWidgets 64-bit version it is compiled with by homebrew
formula [0][1]. The patch noted on the formula page isn't needed for
version 1.7.1.

Agreed: please note we also have done a plugin [0] who directly uses the lib, and
makes it available several very useful algorhitms (e.g. MakeValid), not otherwise
available in QGIS.
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] layers disappear from project at launch
Message-ID: <51E39CD5.7070708@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When I open a project, a major part of its layers disappear when I open 
the project.
The 15 layers are added to the legend, and when it starts rendering 12 
of them are removed.

I looked at the debug output without seeing anything relevant.
The layer count goes from 15 to 3:
http://pastebin.com/PASMbuRL

Do you have any idea what to look for?

Thanks,

Denis

Yes I think we should stick with using the map background as provided by
Andreas and just get the text elements acceptable to folks.

Hi,

Here is my try for a splash-screen:

http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_splashscreen.png
and
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_splashscreen.svgz (with a
high-resolution Inkscape source file - for you to play around and
change) - warning: does not display equally in the web browser than in
Inkscape. Requires Ubuntu font.

I personally like the modern map graphic better than the old style map.
Just my opinion.

When choosing the map extent it is important that both "Dufourspitze"
and "Monte Rosa" remains legible.

Andreas

There's not enough contrast between the background and
the wording, making it hard to read "QGIS" and harder to
read the version and name. I like the "water effect" :)

Hey Andreas,

I quite like this. Prefer the colored map top the black and white one.  The
text does need to be changed but I think that is workable.

Hi,

I agree - the text could be more legible.

I would propose to lighten the background map a bit to make the text
more legible. I also changed the stroke-width of the version text a bit
to make it more legible.

See

http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_splashscreen_v2.png
compared to the old version

and here is v3:

I added the copyright. If we decide for that version I will have to ask
for permission and probably have to set the copyright somewhere.

Hi

Can you make a high res one? Did you use the gimp to make it? See the
master version in
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/images/splash/splash.xcf.bz2

Basically if you make a replacement for that we can make the 600x287
reduced version from that. Also note that you will need to put a light
stripe at the bottom for the load update messages to show clearly against
(see again above master image).

Thanks

Tim

OK the copyright will be obscured by white / light stripe for progress
messages I mentioned in my previous email. Can you move it somewhere else?
And also  can you indicate that the copyright  applies to the image only
(e.g. Background image copyright Swisstopo) - otherwise it looks like the
whole of QGIS is copyright to them.

Regards

Tim

Personally I"m not a fan of the halo 3D looking QGIS and wording.  I would
be keen to see a solid wording but with a bit of transparency so it's not
in your face.

Hi Tim and others,

I can add the white stripe at the bottom.

Do you want the rounded corners and white borders again?

I can also try to fill the "QGIS" text with a white transparent fill as
Nathan suggests.

I like them others don't. So I'm happy either way. If you do go non-rounded
the mask file needs updating too.

Will it be clear to everybody that the SwissTopo copyright text is meant 
for the splash image and not for the QGIS application?

A bit odd to see the ? (c) in the splash screen...

yeah ..
although I like the map itself .. I am not happy with a copyright sign
on the splash screen no affiliated in any way with QGIS ..
the splash screen is the first thing users see ..
and therefore they would probably think that QGIS is produced by
swisstopo .. not a good idea

If we do _have_ to have the copyright on it .. I'd rather choose another map

Werner

+1, same to me.

But, Andreas, don't you think Swisstopo would agree to leave the 
copytight for a so small area and for QGIS?

Otherwise, aren't the old map free of copyright?

Cheers,


Denis

I asked them once about the copyright: as far as I remember the answer was that there is no copyright on the old ones. But something like a "Leistungsschutzrecht" (ancillary copyright?). You can buy the scanned old maps from swisstopo but you are not allowed to redestribute them. But if you have the old paper maps and scan them yourself, you are free to do whatever you want.

Stefan

Hi all,

Here is v4:

http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_splashscreen_v4.png
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_splashscreen_v4_small.png

Changes:
* round corners
* white margin
* white transparent background at text "QGIS"
* Backgroundimage: Copyright Swisstopo

I will have to discuss the copyright issue with the colleagues at
Swisstopo. I will ask for all three maps:

* the current one
* the Siegfriedkarte (the colored one, where the italian part is white)
* the Dufourkarte (the black/white one)

Andreas

To me that is getting there. I would have the blue of Version 2.0 Dufour
bit a slightly different blue but I prefer that flat look to anything 3D
looking. To me it's just cleaner.

a bit darker, and maybe increase space between letters

Hi all.
Is someone actively checking patches and pull reqs provided? We
currently have [0] 36 tickets with an attached patch and [1] 31 open
pull reqs. Some of the patches could fix high priority bugs.
Moreover, not applying them we would also frustrate the effort of new
developers, which is not good for the longer term health of the project.
Thanks for those who will take the time to revise them.
All the best.

Paolo,

There is a SEXTANTE Pull request in there that I hadn't seen. Thanks
for pointing it out. I doesn't look finished to me at first sight, but
definitely is an interesting contribution, so I will take care of it
and discuss it with the author to encourage him to collaborate more.

Thanks!

No one else like me would prefer to get rid of round corners? They do
not look smooth on most machines, and the square corners would somehow
represent one of the many changes in qgis 2.0

cheers!

I personally do not care too much. Fine with either round or sharp corners. The latter are easier to do ;-)

Answer:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer('track.shp', 'layer_name_you_like', 'ogr')

error_msg = ''

error = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat( vlayer, 'test.sqlite',
'System', vlayer.crs(), 'SQLite', False, error_msg, [ "SPATIALITE=YES" , ] )

where:

vlayer                             =>  vector layer which will be exported
to spatialite
'test.sqlite'                      =>  absolute path to new spatialite
database file
'System'                         =>  string that represents the file
encoding
vlayer.crs()                      =>  vector layer crs
'SQLite'                           =>  provider name
False                              =>  export onlySelected?
error_msg                        =>  if there is any error message will be
put in that variable (if user don't care about error handling, set to None)
[ "SPATIALITE=YES" , ]   =>  database options. (here is the trick)



Also, there is a class
http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayerImport.html

But, I didn't have success in create an empty database using the
QgsVectorLayerImport. I think that class (QgsVectorLayerImport) expects a
created spatialite database.

How about to insert the logo into splash ?

Here as it would look: http://lrssvt.ns0.it/img/qgis_splashscreen_logo.png
note that the load message are shown on the right

+1 for square corner

-1 for adding copyright

+1 for sharp corners, they are easier to do and will look cleaner. The
rounded ones sometimes looked blurred out.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python support for both 1.8 and 1.9 in Linux
Message-ID: <CAP13dT3xz4XC2nFspmVYj0XNh2ZWjLNywuFJdbxrXC7jZQhswQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I recently updated my GNU/Linux system and now qgis lost support for python:

Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
RuntimeError: the sip module implements API v10.0 but the qgis.core
module requires API v8.1

I tried 1.9 and it simply say that python is unsupported without
giving an error message or any reason (besides it uses less intuitive
icons very similar among them and not organized so the toolbar becomes
over cluttered, I hope this will not remain in the beta version).

I'm not sure how important is it the change among SIP versions.
Wouldn't it easier to make qgis.core less picky about versions?

Some plugins are very practical, in fact should be included in the
official version, like ftools and the one to allow write the exact
coordinates for a node (not everyone has a precise artistic hand).

Thanks in advance.

Hi

You can see a procedure for resolving the issue in this IRC conversation
log:

http://irclogs.geoapt.com/inasafe/%23inasafe.2013-07-07.log

It involves adding repositories and altering the software installed on your
system so proceed at your own risk.

Regards

Tim

Hi all,

These are some interesting improvements.

I like it how the arrow points to the "Dufourspitze" and also the
transparency aspect of the arrow. I also like the new arrangement of
version number and code name "Dufour".

You may want to try the text without the borders - just plain fill
without the border.

I would either use the original proposal that I did with the 3D-looking
borders (filter effect) or no border at all, if you want to go for a
flat look.

Hi

What about doing the text in 'Swiss' red, plain and flat?

I personally don't like the font very much (especially for the copyright
and the "version 2.0 dufour" parts). You could try with Helvetica (which
seems quite a logical choice ;) )

Also, the copyright (if needed) could be black, and smaller, and would be
more discrete on the top-left.

Cheers,

Olivier

Can't say I'm a fan of the red. It's a bit of a harsh colour to use IMO.
 The blue looked nice because it matched the blue on the background map.

Here are a blue and red version.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/5n2k06mipa9crjz/qgis_red.png
https://www.dropbox.com/s/c3bqb4ijd4tndm6/qgis_blue.png

IMO the red just doesn't work.  The red on blue just looks strange.

Why not leave the logo Q flowing off the splash I think it looks quite
good.

I do think that the font all needs to be the same colour or shades of the
same colour, Having different colours doesn't look good at all.

Some thoughts re Nathan's latest iterations:
- Red is a no-go for me, both because it's been associated through time
with "oups, something's gone wrong, error"
- I would get rid of rounded corners for splash screen, it's so 1990s ;)
rounded shapes are also foreign to GIS environment. If rectangle is too
"boring", you could have a stretched octagon:
 ______________
/                         \
|                          |
|                          |
\______________/
- Not a super fan of the rotated QGIS logo, I'd straighten it out.

Hi all,

Great work on the final touches! This is an exciting release and something for which everyone who's worked on it should be very proud.

-1 for red ... imho, only create a visual using red, yellow, green and blue
if you have a compelling reason. For me, already having yellow, green and
blue borders on tropical fruit plate ...

+1 for ordinary rectangle
-1 for octagon or rounded corners ... let's keep it simple - except if
there is a compelling reason to do otherwise

I like the background map and would not mind the slightly rotated logo.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hey All,

Just wondering what the status of the new website is.  It would be really
nice to have this done for the release if we can.

we can re-introduce the rounded rectangle when we can deal with circular
arcs and compound geometry in QGIS ;-)

I made the request at Swisstopo regarding the copyright question. I did
not hear back so far. Probably this is not an everyday question.

Hi

We / I will probably invest some time next week to backport the work we
have done on InaSAFE (preview here http://inasafe.linfiniti.com) to QGIS.
We will replace the orange theme with the css from the current QGIS mockup
and spruce up what we can.

Regards

Tim

I'd stick to a no frills version:

http://ubuntuone.com/63RgGmwLnmiOz9t4PZCBgT
http://ubuntuone.com/2zsvWL3Liccsm3Zhkzrgkh

First uses Helvetiva, second Univers.

I'm not sure if too many colors really work (green and yellow from logo, blue/white from map and red frim text...).

+1 for ordinary rectangle
-1 for octagon or rounded corners ... let's keep it simple - except if there is a compelling reason to do otherwise

I like the background map and would not mind the slightly rotated logo.

Blue is really nice.

I also like the idea of the "octagon"!

IMO the red just doesn't work.  The red on blue just looks strange.

Why not leave the logo Q flowing off the splash I think it looks quite good.

I do think that the font all needs to be the same colour or shades of the same colour, Having different colours doesn't look good at all.

Hi

What about doing the text in 'Swiss' red, plain and flat?

Hi all,

These are some interesting improvements.

I like it how the arrow points to the "Dufourspitze" and also the
transparency aspect of the arrow. I also like the new arrangement of
version number and code name "Dufour".

You may want to try the text without the borders - just plain fill
without the border.

I would either use the original proposal that I did with the 3D-looking
borders (filter effect) or no border at all, if you want to go for a
flat look.

sorry if I did not follow the whole thread ..
but is the version with the Logo overlay already gone? I liked that a lot ..
Had a very nice look .. and the idea of pointing the arrow to the tip
of the mountain was even better ..

to summarize .. the colours are fine now .. I am just asking about the Logo
:)

regards
Werner

Wener there is still some ideas bouncing around.  I personally like the one
with the logo on it.  If the colours are a concern for people then maybe we
just need to tone the yellow and green down a bit.  But I do like the idea
of having the logo on the splash and where it was looked good to me.

hi all, well glad the naming wasn't as difficult as the theming :)

so my 2 cents on the design.
- I like the no shadow no 3d blue text as in Stephan Example
- I'd like to have the logo down left slightly rotated as in Salvatore
example but maybe more transparent
- I like edgy edges ;)
- i don't like having the copyright on it. the old maps are public domain
now no?

thanks all

Wener there is still some ideas bouncing around.  I personally like the one
with the logo on it.  If the colours are a concern for people then maybe we
just need to tone the yellow and green down a bit.  But I do like the idea
of having the logo on the splash and where it was looked good to me.

- Nathan

Yeah . if the arrow is not pointing to the actual place which the name
tells us .. it does not make sense any more to rotate it .. I liked
salvatores suggestion ..
But I am good with a straight logo as well pointing to nowhere ..

Hi all,

I just got permission to use this Swisstopo map as a background for our
splash screen - the size must not exceed 500'000 pixels.

It is ok if we mention the copyright of the background map of the splash
screen in the "About Dialogue" - so no need to put it on the splash screen.

Who can do this copyright notice in our about screen? It should be
written as:

Backgroundmap of Splashscreen: ? 2013 Swisstopo

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

I like this version of Salvatore with the partial logo in the
bottom-left corner and the arrow pointing to the Dufourspitze. Can we
settle on this representation of the logo? I am also fine with the "edgy
version" where the logo exceeds the splash screen into the transparent
part of the splash screen.

As for the text - I personally would still prefer a blue version. The
Helvetica font is a bit boring - too close to Arial that half of the
world uses ... I personally would keep the Ubuntu font, which is nicer.

Andreas

Not a fan of the yellow around the text.  I think it makes it look a bit
cheap.

I would vote for
https://www.dropbox.com/s/7pn14e6jtty6bhs/qgis_green.jpgbecause the
green text looks better in that one.  The logo could be moved
to the bottom but the lime green looks nicer then the dark green.

oh.. I missed that.
what about using [1] but moving the logo down (as in Salvatore 
suggestion) and the text up?

and maybe try in blue as Andy says

cheap.

I would vote for
https://www.dropbox.com/s/**sjlo6dkwxz78hom/qgis_green.png<https://www.dropbox.com/s/sjlo6dkwxz78hom/qgis_green.png>
because
the green text looks better in that one.  The logo could be moved to the

I've just noticed the name for the next release and the effort for
getting a new splash, and I very much like the way this is going.

Currently, all splash screen drafts I have seen are heavily based on
swisstopo maps. While I personally like these very well-done maps, I
don't see the connection between these and QGIS. For me, looking at the
splashes feels like looking at a swisstopo advertisement.
I would prefer a version, where we show off the new features of QGIS
and/or having a historical map instead of just showing a standard
product of the official Swiss map-makers.

There are a long series of maps available for Switzerland.

These include

Sigfriedkarte:
http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/de/home/products/maps/hist/siegfried/hist.parsys.73474.downloadList.99205.DownloadFile.tmp/siegfried508.tif
(Sample)

Dufourkarte:
http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/de/home/products/maps/hist/dufour_digital/dufour_samples.parsys.73474.downloadList.57777.DownloadFile.tmp/tk0081861.tif
(Sample)

Geological:
http://map.geo.admin.ch/?selectedNode=node_ch.swisstopo.geologie-geologischer_atlas1&Y=633373&X=87292.5&zoom=9&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&layers=ch.swisstopo.geologie-geologischer_atlas&layers_opacity=1&layers_visibility=true&time_current=latest&lang=en

(Sorry, I'm not sure about the licensing terms for the historical maps,
so I was hesitating to distribute those. I know that it's not possible
to design a splash-screen like that, but at least these links give an
impression about these maps)

I'm sure there are even more other maps available.

Regards,
Matthias

the green text looks better in that one.  The logo could be moved to the
bottom but the lime green looks nicer then the dark green.

I like it too, but but please do it with the logo not falling over...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC still too large file in sample project
Message-ID: <51E56316.1080206@jena.de>

Hi Otto and Andreas (and everybody else),

I tried to upload a branch to my fork and still get github's error about 
HYP_50M_SR_W.tif is too large (166.94 MB). The file system is telling me 
it is about 30MB.
Should I refork?

Bernhard

I agree with Matthias, and I'll suggest again (as Andreas did before) to 
try the dufour map: http://s.geo.admin.ch/09751c84f or maybe the 
sigfriedkarte

Hello,

I am using a weekly release of Qgis (10th July).

It seems that it does not support loading a MrSid format file any more.

Hi Marco,

I have made some test and to have vectorJoins, QGIS-server must use 
QgsMapLayerRegistry.

In which method layers can be added to QgsMapLayerRegistry instance ? in 
QgsProjectParser or QgsMSLayerCache ?
In which method layers can be removed to QgsMapLayerRegistry instance ? 
in QgsProjectParser or QgsMSLayerCache ?

Thanks a lot Tim; I agree with Nathan it is important to publish it
when releasing qgis2 at latest. I can give a hand if useful.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAExk7p0XTXyKGg_Vpwiv6k3qx_cjJ_0PKUCNb8OcWj_Q9g6kOw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Mailing list,

I've been working on a python plugin called "Layer Combinations", which I'd
love to release as stable for QGIS 2.0 (it's still flagged as experimental).

Since it's a workflow enhancement plugin, I thought it could be of some
interest to most of you. If so, I invite you to try the latest version
(0.8, requires QGIS nightly/master), and report any bugs or ideas on the
tracker :
https://github.com/olivierdalang/layerCombinations

You'll find a small explanation of the plugin below, and a video trailer
here :
https://vimeo.com/70446444

Thanks for your attention !

Olivier


## LayerCombinations##

It allows to store the visibility and the folding state of the layers in
the legend in so called "combinations".

Those combination can then be restored, allowing to switch back and forth
complex setups.

The combinations can also be applied to composer maps. The link is dynamic,
which means that if the combination is updated, the composer map will
automatically reflect the modifications.

I find it very handy for big projects with many layers and several print
composers.

Hope you like it !

Hi guys,
Tim is right about the logo orientation - there's no reason to put it on a lean.  Even in the versions with the arrow pointing at the mountain it would look far more sensible if you reposition and/or resize it so that it is vertical.

Alister

+1, I like this one, a bit sophisticated (i.e. not cheap looking) :-).

Although, I like the Q (QGIS Logo) a bit smaller, 90% might be better.

 Hi Matthias and Marco,

 You probably have to blame me for using the "modern" Swisstopo map. I 
 just like it better and I think they look prettier than the old black 
 and white maps. Also it gives QGIS a more modern touch, I think. 
 Especially the old Dufour maps are really looking very "heavy" or 
 "depressing", although they are also a piece of art on their own.

 I asked Swisstopo and they are ok if we use the modern maps if the 
 splash-screen does not exceed 500000 pixel. We have the permission to 
 use the current map.

 Andreas

Man I wish this had existed about a year and a half ago. Especially the fact that it integrates into the composers too. I have always felt that was something that was needed - an easy way to edit the locked layers in a composer map - hence why I wrote a plugin for it.

Think I may well not bother update the locked layers editor plugin to 2.0 seeing as you have made this. This is much better.

What a plugin. Can't wait to use it. My studens work on big projects with many layers from differe nt timeperiods. This will help !
Good idea with the small video.

Dear Mailing list,

I've been working on a python plugin called "Layer Combinations", which I'd love to release as stable for QGIS 2.0 (it's still flagged as experimental).

Since it's a workflow enhancement plugin, I thought it could be of some interest to most of you. If so, I invite you to try the latest version (0.8, requires QGIS nightly/master), and report any bugs or ideas on the tracker :
https://github.com/olivierdalang/layerCombinations

You'll find a small explanation of the plugin below, and a video trailer here :
https://vimeo.com/70446444

Thanks for your attention !

Olivier


## LayerCombinations##

It allows to store the visibility and the folding state of the layers in the legend in so called "combinations".

Those combination can then be restored, allowing to switch back and forth complex setups.

The combinations can also be applied to composer maps. The link is dynamic, which means that if the combination is updated, the composer map will automatically reflect the modifications.

I find it very handy for big projects with many layers and several print composers.

Hope you like it !

Hi,

I wanted to give a short feedback. Finally my solution for qgis 1.8 with some
help from Anita was to create a buffer polygon around the point as a memory
layer and calculated the mean value with QgsZonalStatistics. Here is the
code I used, maybe useful for others:

from qgis.analysis import QgsZonalStatistics
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

vpoly = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon", "pointbuffer", "memory")
feature = QgsFeature()
feature.setGeometry( QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(3517601,5406205)).buffer(10000,5))
provider = vpoly.dataProvider()
vpoly.startEditing()
provider.addFeatures( [feature] ) 
vpoly.commitChanges()
stats=qgis.analysis.QgsZonalStatistics(vpoly,"/path/to/rasterlayer.tif")
stats.calculateStatistics(None)
allAttrs = provider.attributeIndexes()
provider.select(allAttrs)
provider.nextFeature(feature)
attrs = feature.attributeMap()
for (k,attr) in attrs.iteritems():
  if k==2:
    QMessageBox.information(qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow(),'Info',attr.toString())

Regards
Otto

This is huge ! Thanks for this plugin. I think this should definitely be
added as a core plugin (in 2.1) if other agree, of course

what if we would do a composition of the 3 maps? maybe using blending modes?

Hi All!

I am unable to install qgis for android on my samsung note 8.0 due to an
md5 hash mismatch error. So far I have not found any way to resolve it. Do
you have any suggestions or is this a bug?

Thanks!

Hi,

Thanks a lot for this plugin Olivier, this will be extremely usefull for
managing big projects.

May I suggest an enhancement ?
I think it would also be really usefull to save the geographic extent of
the layers combinations too.

This would enhance the spatial bookmarks, allowing the user to create real
"views" for a big project, and thus would simplify the process of map
making (in the composer) when dealing with multiple localities (sort of a
simplified Atlas composer).

What do you think of this ?

Anyway, thanks again for this work,

My 2 cents,

Robin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] highlighting features
Message-ID: <51E68555.80405@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I'm working on issue 4819 and noticed that when a feature is selected,
the pan is fast even with complex polygons whereas the pan slows down a
lot when features are highlighted.

My best guesses for the difference is:
1) pan operation use cached image for rendering in rendereV2
2) rendering style and/or pipeline is sufficiently different to cause
delays (this would explain why refresh after pan drag/drop takes 4sec
with highlighted feature, while cached image refresh takes only 2sec
otherwise)

The fix I can think about for this are either:
1) to introduce caching in QgsHighlight (therefore adding substantial
complexity to this class).
2) to add the parameter "highlighted" (along with "selected") to
QgsFeatureRendererV2::renderFeature and get rid of QgsHighlight
altogether (or at least deprecate it).

What is the best option: caching in QgsHighlight, modifying
renderFeature, or something I did not think about ?
 
Thanks,

V.

We've just been booking hotels and some confusion arose, because the 
Wiki says Travel to FOSS4G (Monday 17th).
But the 17th is Tuesday already.

Can you shortly confirm, what days exactly we'll be staying in Brighton 
and on what date the transport will take place.

Thank you very much,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New API: get attribute values from a PostGIS layer
Message-ID: <CAK6pVBUhynefjv2b4xfxDiAe37=ZGSrjqw6a8d4BQExNz5DRhA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am trying to get into the new 2.0 API and am still facing issues for very
basic stuff: getting the values of the attributes out of a PostGIS layer.

Basically, it works (with the almost same code) in the Qgis python console,
but I don't manage to get it to work in a stand-alone script.

What I have so far is a PostGIS layer, that I load with:

*uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
> uri.setConnection('localhost', '5432', 'db_name', 'user_name', 'password')
> uri.setDataSource('my_schema', 'my_table', 'the_geom')
>
> my_layer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(),'myhospitals','postgres')
> *


A quick test shows me that the layer has been successfully loaded:

*if not my_layer.isValid():
>     print "Layer failed to load!"
> else:
>     print "Layer loaded successfully"
> *


I would assume that

*for elem in my_layer.getFeatures():*
> *    print elem.attributes()*
>

should return the attributes in a usable format but, instead, I get:
*
*

> *[<PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant object at 0xad37aca4>, <PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant

Does anyone have an idea where the problem could lie?

For those who speak French, the question is posted here as well:
http://www.forumsig.org/showthread.php/37178-Nouvelle-API-r%C3%A9cup%C3%A9rer-les-valeurs-attributaires

I am using Qgis 1.9.0 with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 13.04

Thanks in advance for ideas and comments...

	SEXTANTE
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zj03uOMbhvxou-MAcN3YN_kfhWAsH3Knjq-i9aKj=ruw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

We have been discussing some issues with packages in R, and I would
like to share some ideas wth you

The goal is to make package installation as easy and practical as
possible, so scripts can run with minor settings

I am thinking that a good solution would be to check for packages
needed by a script, checking calls to library(). With that, package
installation commands could be included, as it is done now with rgdal
and raster, with a code like this

'tryCatch(find.package("rgdal"), error=function(e)
install.packages("rgdal", dependencies=TRUE))')

replace "rgdal" with the lib the script uses...and it should be fine, right?

two problems in here:

1) if the user has no permissions that will not work, but I can
implement a way of checking what is needed and what is installed in
case the algorithm fails, so I can inform the user to manually install
the reuqired packages

2)to avoid installing things automatically, for users that might not
like that behaviour, this can be turned off, so manual intallation is
required.

All this would go on the default lib path, since we agreed that it is
a better option than having a custom one that might duplicate packages

Comments are welcome

Thanks in advance!

Victor

Hi Stephan,

We modified the postgis-workshop tutorial for qgis plugin development to
use the new python api of qgis 1.9, there are examples of feature access
in there:

Cheers,

Vincent.

Hey Stephane,

This is because your standalone script doesn't use the new SIP API.  I
pushed a change last night so that now importing qgis will set the API to
version to.  All you need to do is make sure you import it first before any
of the PyQt4 modules are.

Before:
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from qgis.core import *

After
from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *


If you import PyQt4 first it will set the API to version 1 which you can't
change after.

- Nathan

Hi

More broadly, it would also be nice if R could be provided 'out of the box'
in our standalone installer for windows (and osgeo4w too I guess) - I know
the complicated installation process prevents many users from 'giving it a
try'.

Regards

Tim

You will need to get the nightly builds I'm not sure what time they are
done for Ubuntu, but If you would like you can add this code (before any
PyQt4 imports) into your code in the meantime:

import sip
try:
    apis = ["QDate", "QDateTime", "QString", "QTextStream", "QTime",
"QUrl", "QVariant"]
    for api in apis:
        sip.setapi(api, 2)
except ValueError:
    # API has already been set so we can't set it again.
    pass

That will set the API version so you don't need to update just yet.

Sounds good, but I guess we could do that once we have a larger set of
R scripts prepared. Otherwise, to use R from SEXTANTE, you actually
have to know R, and in taht case you probably know how to install
it...

Are there any plans to put SAGA in the standalone version? That will
definitely help users. It might need require some changes in SEXTANTE,
though, to have it configured by default

Cheers
Victor

think it will be good to show the world wide effort that goes into this
project and how you might have a developer/contributor living next door :)

I don't expect exact address of where you live.  Just give me what ever you
are most comfortable with, town level would be good if your comfortable
with that so we can at least show spread. There will also be no names on
the final map, although if people are keen for that we can always make a
public version later.

We have a map of the users on the plugins site which I turned into a
printed one at
http://www.flickr.com/photos/madmanwoo/8715654343/in/pool-qgis so I'm
looking to do something like that for developers/contributors.

This is not just for core developers, if you have submitted any code, doc
updates, or patch, translations, this applies to you too.   I'm thinking of
highlighting the different types of contributes

You help is very much appreciated.

Regards,
Nathan

Good idea, thanks. Why not taking this chance to make it public, using QGIS web
client and LizMap? It would be nice to show devs and users on the same map.
Our web capabilities are unknown, and seriously underestimated, so this would be
worth the (small) effort IMHO.
All the best.

If someone can set up a LizMap setup, or hosting, for this I think it would
be great. I didn't make a public map to start because not everyone might
not be keen for everyone to know where they live, but having a public map
isn't going to hurt for the people that don't mind.  I'm also making a map
of all the QGIS support providers around the world so if we can have a
LizMap project setup to show that to it would be really cool.

Or maybe even just one project with three different layers. Users,
Contributors, Support providers, etc.

Yes, maybe also sponsors, donors, etc.
As for privacy, we can limit the zooming in.

Agreed: pretty useless to set up everything for R, that remains useless unless one
know what is he doing.

*Please* do: having it working out of the box will immensely increase usability.
All the best.

Hi all.
I think a good warning "Please go and install the following libs" with a link to the
instructions for R is just fine.
All the best.

I agree with Paolo!

A popup window which is saying "... could not be started because we
did not find the xxxxx library for R on your system" would be enough
..
It would be perfect if the name of the missing library could be displayed..

I think with that information people should be able to google (and
learn howto install libraries for R) ..

just my 2c
regards
Werner

Hi Nathan,

One could easily host this on QGIS cloud.

I can also host it on GIS Uster with QGIS web client, if everything is
contained in a spatialite db it would be easiest. OSM could be used as a
background.

Message-ID: <CABr3zxX-iS_tk=ujx+nqVJHvN3r=ctKZGHu-9EeUmbkJtgqDpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

QGIS 2.0 seems to be coming along well and according to what I've read on
these lists it will be released soon.

As you know, it is possible use R tools in QGIS via Sextante. There are
some example scripts already but I think there should be more.

A few months ago I made a few very simple tools but I'm now planning to
work on some more complex stuff to include in QGIS 2.0. R itself can be
used as GIS, which means there are plenty of tools to analyze GIS data. So
I would like to ask everyone for ideas for new new algorithms. Here's an
example:

If anyone has any suggestions, please share them. If you already have some
R code prepared, all the better.

Thanks

Regards
Filipe

Hi all.
Back from an intensive short course on QGIS analysis, here are a few notes on sextante:
* grass import takes really too long for global data; this makes it pretty limited,
especially when using in models, where one has to convert to and from several times;
two possible solutions:
  * keep the same internal format when two analyses use the same backend (I know
Radim already discussed about this)
  * use v.external whenever possible
* in the manual [0] there is a reference to iterators for vectors, but I cannot find
the function: am I missing something, or is the manual outdated?
* I would be keen on starting with saga documentation; can we agree on a format, and
a way to share it between help and manual, so we can start? I have been checking
other analytical software, and I think having the manual pages at hand when doing
analyses seems widespread, and a good way to go; overall, the scope is not very
different between the two; I'd be grateful if someone could decide, set up the
structure, and give us a template.
All the best.

The scripts that does that is ms-windows/osgeo4w/creatensis.pl

It already runs weekly to produce a "preview" standalone installer[1], which
already has SAGA.

Hi Nathan,

If you have a QGIS project with the data (SHP, Spatialite, whatever), we 
can host it on a LizMap setup.
Do you want to administrate it ?

We would be happy to host it on QGIS cloud. You may upload it (or give 
us the data to upload if you prefer).

Hi all.
The plugin is currently broken for master. I remember Richard fixed it, but it is not

Hm, I booked the room in Nottingham starting 17th (ie. Tuesday) and nothing yet
in Brighton.  Could somebody clarify if we're leaving for Nottingham on monday
or tuesday please?

There is already the option to define a grass session, so it minimizes
exports and imports and keep the same mapset across modules. I have
just found out that it is not used in the modeler (!!?? I thought it
was...), and it shouldn't be too difficult to activate.

Can you share a screenshot of a parameters dialog of an algorithm that
uses a vector layer?It should have the iterator button, this is really
strange. I will add an image to the manual to make that more clear.

I would like to put the rst files in my sextante-help repo somewhere
where people can easily edit them just from a browser. I think that
would be a good solution, but haven't found any platform to do that.
There are many that can be used for single files, but for 300+ files,
we need something that can automate the first upload.

Cheers

Hi J?rgen,

It's good to hear from you.  

I can confirm that we'll head up to Nottingham on the Monday.  

Let me know if there is anything else you might need...


Kind regards,

Pete

Hm, I booked the room in Nottingham starting 17th (ie. Tuesday) and nothing
yet in Brighton.  Could somebody clarify if we're leaving for Nottingham on
monday or tuesday please?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] More ideas about package installation in R for
	SEXTANTE

hm isn't it exactly the script that I have send you some days ago?? (apart
from the (easy) option for auto/manual installation)

It detects library() and require() in a rsx-file, tries to install these
packages to the default path, and returns a warning (a text file with
required infos to manually install) if one or more packages have not been
installed by the routine...
In the documentation of any script there should be the list of required
R-packages and a link to a how to manually install it.

Sorry in case I'm misunderstanding!


>More broadly, it would also be nice if R could be provided 'out of the
box' in our standalone installer for windows (and osgeo4w too I guess) - I
know the complicated installation process prevents many users from 'giving
it a try'.

If this means to have an alternative R installation, with all its
maintenance is not that practical...an automatic installation of R and some
SEXTANTE default packages ok, but I think it should happen on the R-default
location and only if not yet installed.

Hi all.
In recent periods, debs are often partially broken; I suggest keeping the latest
version for which all the packages have been produced, so that is it installable.
All the best.

There is a working version (thanks to Richard Duivenvoorde) available at
http://www.qgis.nl/2013/06/30/english-temporary-fix-for-openlayers-plugin/?lang=en

Why not upload it now on plugins.qgis.org (for qgis 1.9 only), and then
upload the new (improved) plugin when ready?

cheers

Hello,

I am interesting also to go to the FOSS4G after the HackFest. What should I do 
to help organization? Do I need to put my name some where?  Add a flag FOSS4G 
on the departure column is good enough?

Thanks,

If you want to build QGIS, use instructions from INSTALL file [0].

Is the intent to have the GDAL tools in the Raster menu support using GDAL 1.10 with the release of QGIS 2. With QGIS 2 built with GDAL 1.10, the "Mask layer" radio button does not display in the Clipper dialog. GDAL 1.10 is failing the the version test in doClipper.py as it thinks 1.10 is older than 1.7. I would assume other tools may also be effected. Should I file a bug report? Priority?

Message-ID: <CAK6pVBVoKEzVo6HoGZ0b3bvLHKvCOknh7QJusaOzbTHWD-yYEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a problem similar to the one I raised yesterday (
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-July/027423.html) but
this time with the network analysis module.

I just tried to follow this tutorial:
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/network-analysis.html

It somehow works (not yet completely, but I have to find out why) in the
Qgis console but not in my stand-alone script.

Basically, my script fails to create the tiedPoints:

tiedPoint = director.makeGraph( builder, [ pstart, pend ] )
>

This throws an exception that I am unable to understand:

> (<type 'exceptions.Exception'>, Exception('unknown',), <traceback object

Do you see a good reason for this behavior? Do I need to explicitly import
anything more in my script?

So far the heading of my script looks like this:

> import sip
> try:
>     apis = ["QDate", "QDateTime", "QString", "QTextStream", "QTime",
> "QUrl", "QVariant"]
>     for api in apis:

>     pass
>
>
> from qgis.core import *
> from qgis.networkanalysis import *
> import qgis.utils
>


Thanks a lot in advance for your help and ideas!

Cheers

Thanks Nathan,

this has indeed solved the problem.

I just updated Qgis on my Ubuntu but apparently the nightly builds haven't
taken your change into account yet. I'll give it another try in a few days

Cheers

Hi Paolo,

the reason to make it available via qgis.nl is to make it only available 
to 'expert'-users. It was a very quick fix, so our idea was to give the 
'normal' users only the 'real fix' from sourcepole later.

Besides that, as I'm not the 'owner' of the plugin, I feel that 
sourcepole should have the last word in this.

If it is ok with sourcepole, feel free to take that zip and upload it to 
qgis.plugins.org (I'm abroad with limited internet access now).

Regards,

Richard

that shouldn't be a problem: "normal" users do not istall qgis-dev

Agreed, this would help. I can't find it, where is it?

I understand this solution would be far easier for many, but I think using a system
which is different from the rest of documentation is suboptimal.
Anything that is good for sextante docs will also be good for the rest of docs.

All the best.

The button is there. I am sending you the screenshot back, with my
mouse pointer (in white) pointing at it :-)

The manual already contains a picture with that, I added it yesterday.
Any idea for a better icon for the button?

Can we start just using git, as with the other docs? People can even
edit the rst files on the on-line editor in github, which is not a bad
solution...

If you can just edit the help on github in the browser that will increase
the chance someone will help.

If ypou hadn't pointed it out, I would never find it. Aside from the new
icon, maybe you could add a small popup explaining what it does.

I think that's fine. If you set up the system, I can start coordinating the effort.
All the best.

I am adding some extra descriptions anyway. There is always room for
improvement and for more detailed explanations

I am going to write the help for one algorithm as an example, write
down some instructions, and then we can move the repo to the qgis
group instead of being in my personal github account? Sounds good to
you?
I have the next week a bit busy, but will try to do it ASAP

Thanks!

Hi all.
The iteration is working, but I get an error after about 100 iterations:

===
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/core/GeoAlgorithm.py", line 147, in
execute
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/algs/mmqgisx/MMQGISXAlgorithms.py",
line 598, in processAlgorithm
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'pendingFields'
===

triyng to read sextante logs brings a different error:

===
Errore durante l'esecuzione di codice Python:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/SextantePlugin.py", line 142, in

  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/gui/HistoryDialog.py", line 57, in

  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/gui/HistoryDialog.py", line 65, in

  File "/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/sextante/core/SextanteLog.py", line 90, in

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/codecs.py", line 881, in open
IOError: [Errno 24] Troppi file aperti: u'/home/paolo/.qgis2//sextante/sextante_qgis.log'
===

Obviously I hit the unfamous max number of files issue, so not much can be done at
the sextante level. A couple of suggestions though:
* the error should be better handled
* when the output produces many files, a warning "Please load files after the
analysis is finished", and an automatic deactivation of the "Open output file..."
option would help a lot.

All the best.

hmm, seems that the problem is not with the output files, but with the
log file...so it should be feasible to fix it...

Thanks for the ideas!

It is also with the output files: only a part of them are produced, before the module
stopping.
All the best, and thanks.

Hello,

I am interesting also to go to the FOSS4G after the HackFest. What should I
do to help organization? Do I need to put my name some where?  Add a flag
FOSS4G on the departure column is good enough?

Thanks,

In fact, the file is not there (nor anywhere in the system): a packaging problem?
All the best.

Message-ID: <CACfnYnT2e6ND0C0Ca5jvn15vpw-w8GNM0X=zgC6gfsqnScanhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

on qgis master (ubuntu nightly + ubuntugis) I have noticed that when
creating a new SL db (from the browser or from "new sl layer" dialog)
it takes many minutes to do so, so long that at first I was thinking
that the program had freezed. I can't see the same on master/windows.

Someone else sees this issue?

Should I file a ticket?


cheers

Hi Paolo,

Here is a new description:

Raster Interpolation browses a vector layer of points, interpolates at 
their position the value of a raster layer and save the value in a 
chosen field of the vector layer.

Interpolation can be nearest, linear or bi-cubic. Simple filter on the 
vector layer may be applied (browse only currently NULL values and/or 
only selected features).

I hope it's a bit more clear...
Otherwise, the printscreen on the plugin homepage (linked) might help:

http://3nids.github.io/rasterinterpolation/


Cheers,

Denis

Hi Denis,
I have read the description, but I do not understand in detail what is the plugin
doing. What is interpolating?
Thanks.

I'll try to reformulate:

You have a vector layer of points.
You have a raster layer (might be a DTM).

Foreach point feature of the vector layer:
     - take the location of the point
     - calculate an interpolated value of a chosen band at the point 
location
     - save this value in a field of the feature

you mean, it is interpolating between adjacent cells? This is interesting, and I
believe quite new.
thanks.

You have this available in SAGA through SEXTANTE. It is called Add
Grid Values To Points and it has Nearest Neighbor,  Bilinear
Interpolation, Inverse Distance Interpolation,  Bicubic Spline
Interpolation and B-Spline Interpolation available

Yes, exactly.

I am using DTM to calculate pipe slopes. If you have very short pipes 
crossing two raster cells, you will get a wrong value, this is why I 
needed to calculate interpolated values.

You can choose:
- nearest neighbor
- bi-linear using 4 cells
- bi-cubic using 16 cells (I did not notive slow down, but it requires 
scipy)

Also, the plugin saved directly the values in the vector layer (instead 
of creating a new shapefile).

Cheers,

Denis

It sounds too hacky. Provider key should not be used above providers
abstraction level, I believe.

So the same what Matthias is suggesting, right? It sounds better.

It would be probably better to work with a number of bytes instead of
length at least for some data types. Maybe we should define our own
enum for QgsFields data types, reflecting more SQL standard than C++
data types, because QVariant types are not sufficient. There is no
QVariant short (smallint, int2) for example. That way we could also
define the number of bytes just by the type (int2, int4, int8).

What is "not applicable"?

Does not length = 0 mean unlimited?

So is there a general consensus to use type/length/precision instead
of typeName everywhere?

hi everybody,

I have a un little problem. I have writed a plugin for qgis and I have
implemented a function to print the map whit legend. But i can not to set
the background of legend. The background of legend show me trasparent.

this is the fragment code:


                legend = QgsComposerLegend(c)
legend.model().setLayerSet(mapRenderer.layerSet())
legend.setItemPosition(1,1)#settare la posizione
legend.setFrame(True)#aggiungere il contorno
c.addItem(legend)

Thanks!!

Hi Victor,

Indeed, I did not notice earlier.

Although I try to have access to SAGA algos without any success.
I have SAGA installed, saga_cmd is accessible, but I can't run these 
algos (ubuntu 12.04, qgis master).

Cheers,

Denis

No, not a new function, since no new one have been added to SEXTANTE.
I haven't actually checked if there are new algorithms in 2.1....

Message-ID: <51ED2CC1.4070003@gmail.com>

HI all,

Thanks to Salvatore Larosa which points that we are at 10 blockers 
before QGIS 2.

But I take a look at the bug trackers :
* 10 issues are blockers bugs
   * 6 target the version 2.0
* 43 issues have high priority
   * 31 are bugs
   * 25 target the version 2.0
* 1036 issues have normal priority
   * 402 target the version 2.0
   * 365 are bugs and target the version 2.0

I would like to know, as a contributor, what we have to do before QGIS 2.0 ?

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Please note that, although on a separate Redmine instance, sextante issues also add
to the figure. Ideally they should be migrated to qgis desktop instance, but this
will imply missing the subcategory classification, which IMHO is not good.

> I would like to know, as a contributor, what we have to do before QGIS 2.0 ?

Besides going and fix issues yourself, I think the most effective approach so far has
been directly sponsoring one developer to go full time bugfixing.
If we get significant new donations, we can keep on supporting this approach.
BTW, Juergen is doing a wonderful job - thanks him, Andreas for starting this, and
all the sponsors and donors to make it possible.

All the best.

My interpretation is that:
* we are committed not to release with blockers
* sponsorship supports one developer for a fixed amount of time, on a best effort basis
* the dev is free to find its way in order to be most effective.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
All the best.

As much as it would be nice to have all this bugs marked against 2.0 fixed
before release I can't see that happening.  We have already delayed this
release by a long time as is. Most of the concern now should be on the
blocking list, which it has been over the last couple of weeks. We are also
already in string freeze so we can't go doing anything major in terms of UI
changes that might stuff up the translation process.

This is not saying that other bugs can't be fixed but we need to cut the
line and release once the blockers are done or else we are never going to
get it out. People, developers included, are just going to get frustrated
by the delays. If we draw the line and release it will always just be a
game of "just wait for this next bit; and this next bit; and this next
bit".  It's not like 2.0 is going to be the final release we ever make.

I think is Tim's plan is releasing on/before FOSS4G, which would be really
good for me. I would really like to draw up hype with my QGIS 2.0 keynote
and having it released would be a good start. Tim is planning to revamp and
style the new website this week which will be nice. Apart from fixing the
blockers and revamping the site I can't see anything stopping a release.
 The manual is a on going effort, even after the release, and because now
it's all rst and html output it will be easier to keep people up to date.

+1, I think the layout and color selection are good. The layout doesn't
include that dark grey border, does it? If so, please consider removing it.

Also, the font used for 'QGIS' is rather weak and, to be frank, a bit
goofy-looking (especially the Q). I have a huge assortment of professional
fonts which I can work with to find something better.

Nathan, do you have a working design file I can use? Or at least a
background PNG without the lettering?

There appears to be no leading between the lines 'QGIS 2.0' and 'Dufour,'
nor spacing between 'QGIS' and '2.0.' Was this intended? I do kind of like
the effect, however. Usually when this is done in design, at minimum, the
coloring of the two words/lines is different, even if just a difference in
tone of the same color.

Regards,

Larry

Hi all.
Next HF is approaching, time to start organizing.
I would suggest:
* for the organizers, to let me know about local budget, and global needs
* for the participants, to book their flight early, to keep costs down, and let me
know if they need support, with an estimate
* it would be good if we stay at the same hotel, so logistics is easy, and contacts
are maximised: can we agree on one?
All the best, and thanks.

I think the Q logo should be smaller, say 1/3 the splash hight and nestled
into the top left corner (with some white space around it) and with no
transparency.

Agreed - though can you please use a font that is free or at  least easily
available and provide the final splash as a gimp xcf so that we can easily
re-use it in future releases.

I agree with this, it needs a little more white space between the words.

Also a note that we usually store the master splash in  much higher
resolution so that it can be used in posters / printed products etc. A
downsampled one is then used for the final splash. Ideally in future
releases we would just swap out the background image and edit the text
containing the version and name.

Ibis looks good.

Paolo, to get that discount, I guess we shouldn't book separately,
right?. You (or someone else) should do all bookings. Do you want us
to make a list of people that want to stay there, number of days,
etc?...or just put "ibis" in the wiki page so you can go there and
just count people?

Cheers
Victor

Before booking, let me know the approximate number and I will talk to them to see if they offer group discount.

That was my suggestion. Better if LOC takes care of the bookings, so it will be
easier to do last minute changes.
All the best.

I do not think anybody objects to IBIS, if this is the group choice.
Our plans are to cover these expenses with QGIS funds, for all core devs.
All the best.

Message-ID: <51EF65A6.30208@gmx.de>

Dear QGIS-devs,

I have a bunch of maps that I need to print. I already created 
qpt-templates for these maps using a shell script (on Ubuntu).
Is there a way to call the printing function of QGIS from within the 
shell to print my templates e.g. to pdf or other formats?

Thanks for any hints

Hi Stefan,

QGIS 1.9x (the upcoming 2.0) has a serial print function called Atlas.
It does not work from the command line but from the GUI. It works well.
As far as I know it also comes with a Python API - so if you can invest
some time you can create your own python scripts for serial printing.

I would definitely recommend to use QGIS master/2.0 and not QGIS 1.8 for
serial printing purposes.

Andreas

Hi all.
When printing a layout that contains a WMS, we get a warning about max size.
I think this is useless now, as the print driver automaticallly tiles up the WMS req.
Should the warning be removed?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Label linestrings multiple times and left and

Message-ID: <51EFED7B.7000701@carto.net>

Hi,

I would like to label linestring geometries multiple times with
different label texts. I would like to do this without having to load
the same layer mulitple times. E.g. a label at the beginning of the line
(if the beginning is visible) with one expression for the text, the same
linestring geometry should be labeled in the middle or somewhere along
the "visible" line with a different expression for the text, and again
at the end of the line with yet another text string.

Also I would like to label text both above and below the line, based on
attribute values.

I know this is currently not possible, but would this be possible to
implement in QGIS 2.1?

Thanks,
Andreas

I think QGIS should offer the option to on-the-fly try to fix those
geometries. This was discussed previously [0], and I think the best
solution presented so far is to find a way to incorporate the standalone
PostGIS library 'lwgeom' into the QGIS source tree, or just the relevant
bits, as Juergen suggested at the end of that thread, and add support in
QgsGeometry.

As a side note, Spatialite 4.x includes support for the lwgeom library as
well, and for the Mac 'homebrew' package manager, which offers an install
of QGIS, it causes a circular dependency issue[1]. The solution there was
to disable the lwgeom support in Spatialite. Currently, other software that
uses the lwgeom lib (I think) also require that PostGIS/PostgreSQL already
be installed.

Ideally, if someone where to find a way (maybe it is simple, but not for
me) to have the lwgeom library compile-able as a standalone library, apart
from PostGIS, it would help both the QGIS project and some packaging issues
now and down the road. I suppose we could ask Paul Ramsey or Sandro
Santilli what they think about such an idea, and if they could help.

But that just wraps the C++ library with Python doesn't? (Very nice, btw!)
That still requires a full install of PostGIS/PostgreSQL (at this time):

...
    def getLwgeomLibrary(self):
        # try to load the LWGEOM library
        libpath = SextanteConfig.getSetting("LWGEOM_PATH_SETTING")
        lib = ctypes.CDLL(libpath)
...

For labeling, I don't think we would want to introduce Python into the mix,
or require PostGIS to be installed. So, either C++ compiled-in or shared
lib support would be best (for the speed).

Do you have some links to any notes on how this was done using the PostGIS
source code? I'd like to make that library available for the Mac builds and
pass the notes along to others.

Larry

not, we have compiled it as standalone; in deb it is the same:

The MakeValid is not a fast process.
Try to apply it on-the-fly will slow again the labelling flow.

Another problem is tht it could change little , but not less important, 
part of a geometry.
so if the user will decide to edit it .
Instead of editing the original geometry it will edit a changed geometry.
And save in the shapefile (o r other container) another more changed 
geometry.

Don't forgot that the original ST_MakeValid of postgis (and also 
spatialite) will return also the
removed parts of original geometry. (point , arc or other it was)

To not lost of view the original geometry.

Yes, but only for those features that are tested to be invalid (already
done). Also, as I noted, this should be optional, and probably disabled by
default.

The labeling engine sends to the backend PAL library *copies* of the
feature geometries. So, the original geometry is never edited, i.e. the
copy would be what is run through ST_MakeValid. Once the labels are
created, those copied geometries are dumped and never rendered on the
canvas.

There should probably be some logging somewhere, if the geometry is
invalid, but usually the copied geometry has been clipped to the extent
rectangle. In other words, invalid geometries of the copies at that point
have nothing to do with the original features, which may be valid. So,
logging invalids at that point doesn't make sense.

This could be an issue, where a multi-geometry is return for a single
input. It seems this could be overcome with some checks, and eventually
fallback to rejecting the geometry, if necessary.

Sorry. I don't understand your meaning here.

Actually, I hadn't tested building the standalone Mac liblwgeom.dylib since
PostGIS 2.0.3 came out. I was able to easily build the .dylib for both
2.0.3 and with current source trunk. Trunk appears to now require the
json-c lib, which was not part of the Kyngchaos framework installs, but is
readily available via homebrew.

So, it fairly simple to compile and include liblwgeom-2.0.3.dylib (422 KB)
with Mac bundled app builds, once it is utilized directly in QGIS code.
Very nice, indeed, for geometry repairing routines!

William, here is what I did [0]. Please let me know if there is something I
am missing in the build steps that might cause issues for use in a bundled
QGIS. Thanks.

The MakeValid is capable to resolve very complex situations, the main goal
is never lost any vertex. So the MakeValid in the Postgs often could return
a geometrycollection with one, two or three parts (polygons, linea and
points).

As example when the invalidity is a line inside a polygon (this is quite
normal when the geometries came from cad systems), the MakeValid will
create a collection with the polygon and a line. In Spatialite instead the
collection are not so flexible so the solution was to wrap the MakeValid on
two distinct functions:
MakeValid() and MakeValidDiscarded.

Sorry, I was unable to explain.

Simply I want say that the main goal of the MakeValid was to resolve an
invalidity withoun lost any vertex of the original geometry.

In spatialite where the collection are no so flexible.
The solution was to support two functions one to return the higher level
geometry (usually the more interesting to see) and another function
(MakeValidDiscarded) to return the lower level geometries.

But this mean that using only the ST_MakeValid() in spatialite without see
what return the MakeValidDiscarded Function could mean to lost something.

Re-creating postgis configure is unnecessary with the release source, and I wouldn't suggest to most users to use dev sources.

If liblwgeom becomes a requirement for QGIS, I'll certainly be packaging it with QGIS, and adding instructions to INSTALL.

Additional notes:

It can be configured with GEOS also.

The default is to include raster and topology, neither of which is part of liblwgeom.  And configure will fail if it doesn't find GDAL for raster support.  So, disable both to same some compile time and configure hassle.

It probably requires a full install of Postgres.  It will find it automatically in /usr/local/pgsql if it's there, but probably fail if missing (don't want to delete mine to test).  This may be a blocker for the casual user that doesn't want to install Postgres.  Postgis needs an option to build just the library for this to be more accessible.

My adjusted configure:

./configure --with-geosconfig=/Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework/unix/bin/geos-config \
--with-projdir=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/unix \
--with-jsondir=/Users/Shared/unix/json-c-snow \
--without-raster --without-topology

        Im compiling the Qgis1.8 in RHEL 5, all the dependencies I have

everything went properly but when I gave option 'g', it is showing

        Along with the WARNINGS I gave "make", at that time its giving an

it is not a requirement, but it wouold be good if you could include it anyway, to let

it should not; at least, o win and deb this is not the case.

We have discussed about this during the Valmiera meeting, without reaching firm

Subject: [Qgis-developer] right-click to end the digitizing
Message-ID: <51F0BF4F.7000006@gmail.com>

Hi all,

For digitizing, I wonder why the right-click adds a point and finishes 
instead of just finishing the operation.

While showing QGIS to new users, it seems to be very unintuitive. I tend 
to agree to this. After using Inkscape a lot last weeks ;), QGIS' 
behavior seems even more unnatural.

Indeed, one operation per button would be a lot better: left to add, 
right to finish.

I know this discussion has been raised before but I think it might be 
the right time if we decide to change. It would be for 2.0  as this 
isn't a new feature but quite a change in behavior.

In my company, we'll have a few drawers working on QGIS to digitize and 
I think such basic operation should be more intuitive.

What do you think?

Cheers,

Denis

Message-ID: <CAMZqZzx4Mt=JGcZjZD6KE2j-u_Up-OG=SvP=6QG9oUaPjy8VzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Thanks for all the hard work, I have been using the almost 2.0 builds with
some satisfaction. Unfortunately, all is not well. I am using yesterday's
Master build, and there seems to be a few bugs still.


First of all, the dialog window for Raster|Analysis|DEM is too tall for my
Macbook, which only has 800 pixels vertically. You might consider
rearranging it a little. I can still use it by starting the analysis by
hitting Enter, but I cannot actually see the bottom row of buttons or the
resize widget.


Second, I have some errors in the Raster|Conversion|Rasterise dialog that
make it unusable for me.

I am trying to rasterise a vector layer that I saved as a selection from a
layer that I had previously vectorised.

I understand this dialog is just a front for GDAL tools, but the bridge
seems to be broken: I get the following python error when I try to select a
filename for the rasterised output layer:

Traceback (most recent call last):

'/Users/XX/YY/ZZ']


Then if I try to run it with the existing size, I get another python error.
If I choose the option with pixel size, the action just seems to hang
without resolving or any error message.


I hope this makes sense. I have installed all of the required packages from
kyngchaos, AFAIK. Feel free to contact me for additional data.


Best wishes,

 Oscar

+1000, 
I had the same feedback here in training courses, but did not raise it here,
since we never do mass digitizing here.

Hi all,

I propose to add an option for this.

Here is the pull request, what do you think?
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/765

Would it be ok for QGIS 2.0???

Cheers,

Denis

Hi

I don't know what's your windows system... generally on gnome or kde
using Alt+7 and cliking on the window allow you to pan the gui along
the window.

this doesn't append to me in gnome3 or unity... but probabilly i've to
find the correct key combination.

I don't know using osx window manager

another workaround is to change application font sizes of your desktop
configuration.

I have done little digitizing, but I think it would be more intuitive to
have right-click finish digitizing only, no need to make that opional.

Admittedly the vertical size of that dialog is a bit large.
If you close the "Creation Options" section, can you resize the window and
see the bottom buttons?

I cannot reproduce these 2 problems in linux, perhaps only a Mac bug?

Consider filing a bug report here:

Changing the license would require getting agreement of every developer who
ever contributed to QGIS and removing / rewriting code from those that we
can't track down or that don't agree. I think there are a 1000 other better
things we could be spending our time doing....

Dear Etienne,

Thanks for the suggestion. If I close the creation options in the DEM, I am
still a bit short: I see the gdaldem ..... window, but the OK and Close
buttons still end up below the bottom of my screen.

I am using Mac OS X 10.6.8 on a 13" Macbook with a resolution of 1280*800
(which, I admit, is a bit small for this sort of thing).

As for the python error, I don't know if it is Mac-specific. Maybe someone
else can confirm before I file a bug? I managed to run gdal_rasterize from
the command line and it worked fine, so the problem is definitely between
QGIS and my Mac.

Best wishes,
 Oscar

I mean configuration probably requires postgres.  Compilation of only liblwgeom after configuration does not.

It's a Python one. lwgeom is not a requirement, but it would be good to include it
anyway; probably more and more of its functions will be used (easy to add them to the
plugin).
All the best.

Hmm, unless QGIS itself starts using lwgeom, I don't think bundling tools for use by 3rd party plugins is the way to go.  Maybe OK since it's an extension of Sextante (just refreshed what you said on this thread).  Or could the plugin just be added to core Sextante?

I'll think about options.

I do a lot of digitising and +1 for right clic finish only unless you add other actions to right clic like snap to midpoint, snap to edge, etc like other software then my vote would g8 to double click to finish feature or f2 if that's not patented?

that's the plan; of course it is only feasible if lwgeom is available for all major
OS, so it's a chicken-egg problem.

Well,
Double click is source of a lot of double vertex if it?s not fast enough. IMHO this is too prone to generate invalid geometry.
Adding a shortcut to a key would be convenient, especially if shortcut could be modified in option/configure shortcuts.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tools to support code porting to new c++ and
	python APIs
Message-ID: <CAFO80_pbhMH2L_zbD+QSSQh7yKEcxhXYi1W6NYrpapiLZJZWXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

due to my work on porting qgis plugins to new APIs I looked for a tool
helping me to find code modifications.

I didn't find it! so I wrote a "really bad" draft tool to recursively
grep most of modifications stated in this two web pages:

A) http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20
(partially supported... i've to complete it)
B) http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20

python code can be found here:

https://github.com/luipir/qgis20_api_check

Inside the code I brutally replicated the suggestion stated in the A
and B websites (I did't find a good way to automatically parse their
content to auto-generate the check script... but I didn't spent time
on it)

brutally grep (without sophisticated regular expressions) generate a
lot of fake messages, but the script helped me to evaluate the
complexity of the work and to point directly where to modify

The only thing we can do is look that every NEW file added to the
source code has a license ..

Hi Tim,

As per license disclaimer in qgis.cpp:

/***************************************************************************
* *
* This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify *
* it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by *
* the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or *

* *
***************************************************************************/

so anyone could fork the entire source tree into GPL3 without license 
problems.

I believe that only a decision needs to be made, without asking all 
copyright holders in this case (moving to MIT or similar would require that)

Cheers,
Angelos

It depends if the QGIS project has strong reasons to move from GPL v2 or later 
to GPL v3. But, as a reminder, mixing GPL v2 only and GPL v3 is not possible 
since the licences are incompatible. What should be considered is QGIS and its 
whole ecosystem. Keeping with GPL v2 or later is the option that maximises 
compatibility with other GPL dependencies.

You are correct that dialogs too big to fit on such screens is a big
usability problem. I'm pretty sure I filed a bug a long time ago stating
that all dialogs need to be checked that they fit in 1024x768, more
preferably that they can be re-sized to 800x600 on their minimum end
even if they look bad. If we don't take care to do that we make QGIS
unusable on many computers.

My laptop and many others out there are 1366x768 (Close to 40% of
machines on the net would have this issue according to
http://netmarketshare.com/report.aspx?qprid=17 )

FYI, on Unity (Recent Ubuntu), if you hold alt and then click and drag
with the mouse you can move the window however you want)

Thanks,
Alex

I agree, I like the shortcut to key idea.

Double click is source of a lot of double vertex if it?s not fast enough. IMHO this is too prone to generate invalid geometry.
Adding a shortcut to a key would be convenient, especially if shortcut could be modified in option/configure shortcuts.

I do a lot of digitising and +1 for right clic finish only unless you add other actions to right clic like snap to midpoint, snap to edge, etc like other software then my vote would g8 to double click to finish feature or f2 if that's not patented?

Yes, there are two issues here.
Firstly, it should definitely be possible to finish digitising a feature without adding an additional point.  And I think at least for the sake of new or casual users this should be the default.
Secondly, I think even if it doesn't happen now, eventually there should be a menu on right-click, for things like undoing the last vertex.  I think a little while ago there was some discussion of this along with right-click menus in the composer, but maybe it was just me ;)

Regards,
Alister

Hi,

I have modified the pull request so it now finishes without adding a vertex.

I think that having a key to finish digitization might wait for having 
something else done with the right-click.

Is this ok for you like this?

Cheers,

Denis

I have no idea why you get these errors, but you should NEVER run as root
user, unless installing important things.
Try again as a normal user, you will probably have better success.

This is an app bundling error. I have verified here on 10.7.5 with the
nightly. The separate help app is located here (relative to your install):

/Applications/QGIS_2.0-dev.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/qgis_help.app

Inside its bundle is the main executable at:

qgis_help.app/Contents/MacOS/qgis_help

Running the 'otool -L ' on that gives the following (which matches your
error):

@executable_path/lib/libspatialindex.dylib

This is not where libspatialindex.dylib is located relative to the
qgis_help binary. It is really at:

@executable_path/../../../../lib/libspatialindex.dylib

in the main QGIS app bundle.


This needs fix in the CMake setup for bundling on Mac. You can fix locally
if you have Apple's XCode and command line developer tools installed with
the following commands in Terminal:

cd
/Applications/QGIS_2.0-dev.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/qgis_help.app/Contents/MacOS

install_name_tool -change @executable_path/lib/libspatialindex.dylib \
@executable_path/../../../../lib/libspatialindex.dylib \
qgis_help

Works for me on 10.7.5. Please test if you can. Make sure to remove the
noted symlink you made first (unneeded).

Now, this begs the question... why is libspatialindex.dylib needed by the
help app to begin with? I don't think it is. So really, what needs fixed is
the fact that it is being added to the help app build, when it shouldn't be.

Also, you will find the info in the help app outdated. And, often the app
will open up behind your front window.

Regards, and thanks for the report.

Larry

Should be fixed with commit f779592f:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/f779592f9de26061d77de4867b6678e3dbb10074

Once the 10.7-8 Mac nightly is built tomorrow morning, please test.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Chain Temporary Algorithms
Message-ID: <1374897599819-5069057.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hej Everyone,
New to the mailing list here... and I am having some trouble writing a
script that I was hoping someone could lend me a hand with. Mainly this is a
script I use to get centerline's of a polygon that I used in ArcGIS before
and I want to adapt it to work in QGIS. Anyways there are a sequence of
algorithms from qgis that I want to use in memory before getting the final
output as a series of points (which then need to be processed further)
however chaining these algorithms simply fails after the first one where the
output is simply not being created for the next step to process.

Here is a snippet of that code - any help would be appreciated!
Cheers,
Bjorn

#Definition of inputs and outputs
#==================================
##[Example scripts]=group
##Polygon=vector
##Detail=number 1000
##Scale=boolean True
##All_Paths=boolean False
##Output=output vector

#Algorithm body
#==================================
import sextante as st
    
densify = st.runalg("qgis:densifygeometries"),inFC,Detail,None)
extractNodes = st.runalg("qgis:extractnodes",densify,None)
voronoi = st.runalg("qgis:voronoipolygons",extractNodes,None)
voronoi_lines = st.runalg("qgis:polygonstolines",voronoi,None)
polygon_lines = st.runalg("qgis:polygonstolines",inFC,None)
clip = st.runalg("qgis:clip",inFC,voronoi_lines,None)
out = st.runalg("qgis:difference",clip,polygon_lines,None)

layer = st.getobject(out)
features: = st.getfeatures(layer)
Points = []
for feature in features:
    Points.append(features.geometry().asMultiPolyline())

Sorry I posted the wrong code in the previous post it should read

import sextante as st
    
densify = st.runalg("qgis:densifygeometries"),Polygon,Detail,None)
extractNodes = st.runalg("qgis:extractnodes",densify,None)
voronoi = st.runalg("qgis:voronoipolygons",extractNodes,None)
voronoi_lines = st.runalg("qgis:polygonstolines",voronoi,None)
polygon_lines = st.runalg("qgis:polygonstolines",Polygon,None)
clip = st.runalg("qgis:clip",Polygon,voronoi_lines,None)
outData = st.runalg("qgis:difference",clip,polygon_lines,None)

The error I receive follows:
Oooops! SEXTANTE could not open the following output layers

Output:/var/folders/jk/2kj1gpl15d1747rkn7sl_mkh0000gn/T/sextante/scriptexamplescript521deca6725e4911ab0ecebf719f4bdf.shp
The above files could not be opened, which probably indicates that they were not correctly produced by the executed algorithm

Checking the log information might help you see why those layers were not created as expected

Cheers,
Bjorn

Hi,

Qt 4.4 is really old already. If you are compiling the dependencies 
yourself as well as you wrote, you should consider using a newer 
version.
Also, I don't know know why you are compiling all the dependencies 
yourself, normally it should be enough to install the required -devel 
packages.

Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Checklist update
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiZwxhHs7bYMTXjDwrvTbXj0pRFFzxji0SrQmw1EOyjAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We've got a pretty outdated checklist floating around - and appearing on
Google searches for 2.0 release:

http://qgis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/qgis_governance/release_checklists/release-2.0.html

Could someone update it or should we simply remove it?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

It seems, that this information is outdated. QStringList.append(
QStringList ) has been introduced in Qt 4.5 [1]
It looks like we need to update the requirements. Or in case there is
still a stable distro we want to support which ships with Qt 4.4 we
would need to adapt the code.
Regardless, I would strongly recommend to update to a newer Qt version.

Kind regards,
Matthias Kuhn

I think the original is here:

Better keep this updated, and remove all the rest.
Thanks for pointing it out.

Hi,

We don't support Qt 5 yet. Best to get the latest Qt 4 version ( 4.8 ).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] raster calculator bug
Message-ID: <CAMZqZzzHx0sxFWj+8WZMWxeUf_O1v5qhp6FVDd_npFs85AdMKw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

I am using nightly QGIS_1-9-0_2013-07-27_f854288 and the raster calculator
is very broken when using powers.

For example:

Area_mask at 1 ^ -130.3475674

where Area_mask has a value of 0, 1 or 2

Results in 'nodata' everywhere. In part, think it has to do with the
negative value, because if I run

1 /  (Area_mask at 1 ^ 130.3475674)

I get at least 0 and 1. However, there is a mathematically valid answer for
2 as well, so there is more wrong than just the negative being used wrongly.

I also have a strong notion that stuff like this used to work, though I
cannot be sure it is a regression.

If anyone can confirm this, please consider it as a release blocker.

Best wishes,
 Oscar

Hi

what was the result of QgsFields.values()? I've no documentation in
master and in 1.8!

I've this error in a plugin:

 File "/home/ginetto/.qgis2/python/plugins/rt_postgres_extractor/WizPage1.py",
line 187, in fillLayerAttrsCombo
    self.layerAttrsCombo.addItems(  self.getFieldNames4Combo(flds.values()) )
AttributeError: 'QgsFields' object has no attribute 'values'

from this code:

pr = layer.dataProvider()
flds = pr.fields()
self.layerAttrsCombo.addItems(  self.getFieldNames4Combo(flds.values()) )

where layer is a QgsVectorLayer => pr is a QgsVectorDataProvider

I know! i was changing to 2.0 api... Natan shown me that
QgsVectorDataProvider.fields() changed from QMap to QList... QMap has
values() method, but QList no... but solution is to erase values()
call beacuse called funcion need a QFields list.

thanks anyway, ginetto

Hi all,

seems calling fieldNameMap() on vector data provider crashes QGIS.
To reproduce load shapefile and run in Python console next commands:
l = iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
fm = l.dataProvider().fieldNameMap()

Anyone confirms? Should I file a ticket?

Thanks

and leave: self.layerAttrsCombo.addItems(

Seems switching from the deprecated sipInstance... calls to sipType... 
calls (e.g. sipConvertFromType, sipCanConvertFromType etc) solves this 
issue. However, these are deprecated since sip 4.8. Can we switch all 
of them or do we need to support older sip versions still? (The INSTALL 
file states min SIP version is 4.5) I think we already do use some 
(newer version only) sipType calls not within an #if condition, so I 
guess somebody would have complained if this would be an issue...

Hi Alexander,

Confirmed here. Seems to be an error in the MappedType code, because 
we're using the deprecated sipConvertFromNewInstance instead of 
sipConvertFromNewType.

Hi Arun,
thanks a lot for this. Would you mind sharing your ideas about which resources to
share? For instance, I would be keen in adding also Sextante user models, possibly
others will have further ideas.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAFO80_pUTiFu5aUUuyM0hq9=raOoF1U6R3aQxXeTA=CAvDE+mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm evaluating a work about managing tile download retry during a WMS request.

Analyzing the code there are different solutions
A) implementing a new requet in QgsWmsProvider::tileReplyFinished if
ther is an error (probabilly it's better to re-organize the logic of
this routine because there are too many exit points)
B) adding a configuration method in QgsNetworkAccessManager(subclass
of QNetworkAccessManager) adding managing of retry. In this case all
QGis can use this feature.

I noticed that the option parameter:
Settings->Options->Network->Timeout for network requests (ms)
configure only  QgsHttpTransaction::httpTransaction(...) call that is
ONLY used inside mapserver core plugin code (option name is at lest
not comprensible)

Timeout could be another configuration parameter added to
QgsNetworkAccessManager.
Timeout managing could be managed as here:
http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/15222
that is the same solution used in QgsHttpTransaction

thanks, Lugi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

Hi Arun,

When coding the new plugin manager recently, I was thinking how to cooperate 
with you to not duplicate the code. Finally I don't decided to consult with 
you at that stage, because - due to a time pression - I had to focus on the 
architecture, reusing as much as possible from the old code, postponing any 
nicer gui for 2.1.

Unfortunately I don't plan to assign much time to the manager/installer during 
your current GSoC period and I even haven't compiled your branch yet (shame on 
me!), however, if you have any ideas how to include the plugin management to 
the common framework, I'd be happy to cooperate. The manager is accessible 
from Python, however, I don't consider it as any public API, so we still can 
change it quite much in QGIS 2.1

Anyway, I haven't found any common way for presenting items. For plugins, I've 
found the simple name list + www browser for details the most suitable, while 
for styles probably a rich list would be better. Code snippets may be closer 
to plugins though...

What do you think about it all?

Borys.

I've created a tool in Python, that requires guiqwt for the interactive
graphical definition of spline parameters. I would like to include it into
a plugin of mine (for Qgis 1.8), that currently does not require any
non-standard Python module.
I don't know what could be the best way, mainly from the user point-of
view, for managing the absence of this module in QGIS Python.

Thanks for any suggestion,

mauro

Hi,

I would suggest you to check for the presence of the module when the plugin
starts and give the user instructions to install it.

If the module is small, you could also consider to include it in the plugin
distribution and add the folder to sys.path to allow inclusion.

I see that guiqwt is based on PyQwt.  This is not good, since PyQwt does not support the latest PyQt, and probably never will.

matplotlib is lower-level, surely would require (much) more work to do the
same, and I'm not sure if it supports interactivity between spline
parameters changed by the user in a slider, and interpolated spline curve a
plot.
In guiqwt is is almost all made.

 Hi,

 I just opened http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8379

 We should really get rid of duplicate functionality. Everything that 
 can be done with "line decoration" can be done with the more powerful 
 "marker line".

 Are people using "line decoration"? Can we remove it?

Sure, thanks. I didn't dare because I can replicate it reliably only with one

Anything I should try or add?

Hi all.
I suspect this may be due to its bounding box; however, I have form the canvas a Xmax
of 17087388, and I set up on the OWS properties 19472183 to prevent this.
Original data are in 4326, with
xMin, yMin -25.6707,-35.2822 : xMax,yMax 149.129,57.6651
Any help would be appreciated: could this be a bug, or a local config problem?
Thanks a lot.
All the best.

Hi all.
I think Andreas initiative of sponsoring Juergen work focused on fixing important
bugs has been a great success (thanks for this!); we are around 10 blockers now,
several of them related, and another 40+ tickets of high importance. I assume the
budget has been consumed by now, so what are our plans now? Should we keep on with
another week, or do we have another strategy?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Digitization change in upcoming 2.0
Message-ID: <51F762D0.4040600@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS users,

On today's master and upcoming QGIS 2.0, the behaviour of the 
right-click in digitization has changed.

Instead of adding a vertex and finishing the digitization, *it now only 
finishes the **digitization without adding any vertex*.

We understand it is quite a change for long-time users, but we believe 
this behaviour is much more intuitive, and that users will get used to 
it very quickly.

Best regards,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS QgsVectorFileWriter
Message-ID: <D75BA737-6A7B-4842-9A35-60B3ACE7EDBD@gmail.com>

I have a list of Linestrings [(x,y),(x,y)] pairs that i've created as

    shapelist.append(([QgsPoint(x1,y1),QgsPoint(x2,y2)]))


shapelist[:5]
[[(4.11658e+06,5.18318e+06), (4.11717e+06,5.18218e+06)], [(4.11847e+06,5.18323e+06), (4.11771e+06,5.18223e+06)], [(4.1064e+06,5.17508e+06), (4.10647e+06,5.17408e+06)], [(4.10755e+06,5.1749e+06), (4.10693e+06,5.1739e+06)], [(4.11138e+06,5.15935e+06), (4.112e+06,5.15835e+06)]]


MultiPolyLine = QgsGeometry.fromMultiPolyline(shapelist)

However when I attempt to apply the writer by 

writer = QgsVectorFileWriter(out, "CP1250", fields, QGis.WKBMultiLineString, layer.crs(), "ESRI Shapefile")

I receive the following traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: arguments did not match any overloaded call:
  QgsVectorFileWriter(QString, QString, QgsFields, QGis.WkbType, QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem, QString driverName="ESRI Shapefile", QStringList datasourceOptions=QStringList(), QStringList layerOptions=QStringList(), QString newFilename=None): argument 3 has unexpected type 'dict'
  QgsVectorFileWriter(QgsVectorFileWriter): argument 1 has unexpected type 'str'


What does a Qstring imply here? Do I need to apply PyQt4.QtCore.QString(out)? 

Cheers,
Bjorn

If we have the funding, lets get Jurgen on for another week - I'd like to
get teh release out by the end of August.

Otherwise we must start thinking seriously about releasing with a list of
'known issues'. As currently stands, that list would contain*:

The SVG marker window has several bugs related to SVG parameters
Wrong font display in qgis server
Polygons digitized in Postgis layer with "Avoid Intersections"
WFS-T and postgis: "ERROR: null value in column "gid" violates not-null
constraint" when adding features
Point pattern fill: invalid scaling of displacements when printing or
writing PDF from composer
Symbology: Get rid of duplicate functionality "line decoration"
Blocker Measurements in degrees even when meters are chosen as map units
Print as raster doesn't work
Large memory used with map units symbology at large scales
VRT file opens instantly in 1.8, not opened after 10 mins on Master
QGIS does not deal with shapefiles with two fields with the same name

We should have funds available. As soon as Horst is back we'll have the exact
figures. An alternative would be to call for targeted donations.

All the best.

Hi, 
is this a sort of Release Candidate? 
Looking at the blocker list remaining, 'print as raster' and "pdf from
composer" can't be kept as know issues even for a release candidate. The
other are woraroundable (I hope that work exists !)

Cheers
R?gis

Well ideally all those issues will be fixed for the release -  I was just
listing what is currently there. Lets see what we can organise in terms of
funding more bug fixing before we go down the rabbit hole of discussing
which known issues are allowable :-)

right; so I suggest to start a funding campaign for qgis2.

Hi,

I guess that the 3rd argument (fields) should be a QgsFields object.
You can create it like this.

fields = QgsFields()
fields.append( QgsField( "id", QVariant.Int ) )
fields.append( QgsField( "desc", QVariant.String ) )

Cheers,
Minoru

Message-ID: <ccf102b260d5d7203ba6460487055c6b@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I am testing QGIS desktop WFS client against a QGIS WFS server and see 
 that the client is skipping features - quite a lot in fact.

 The server part seems to be fine as I can get all features to display 
 when using FME viewer as a client.

 Do others have similar issues? Are there open bugs on the WFS client 
 regarding this? Any tips what I can do? Any hidden settings for limiting 
 the number of features?

 I tried to use with and without cache and there is no difference.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Hi all.
The next HF is going to be an expensive one; as such, it is important for us to have
an accurate budget. I would therefore ask anybody who needs support to let me know
ASAP, both for the flight and for the hotel.
Also a note "I do not need support" by core devs who are already covered by other
means will be appreciated.
All the best.

Hello,

Sorry for the late reply. With respect to the types of resources, I had
symbols, symbology style sheets, plugins, script runner scripts, sextante
models, and if possible print composer templates. But the basic idea is not
to create a GUI for all of these or change the existing ones like the
plugins downloader, that is already present. My idea is to create the
remote infrastructure (server - qgis-django) with the required API and
write the basic backend library for the Quantum-GIS desktop application.
Then the desktop application API can be used at respective places, wherever
required.

When I wrote the proposal, initially I had the idea to write a single
plugin, perhaps in Python to show-case the idea. But presently I think
writing the backend code in the "core" library would be more helpful than a
single plugin for a particular resource. Basic working is downloading ->
validating -> initiating integration. This is common to any resource we
might share.

The present code with the QgsSymbolResource class in my gsoc13 branch is an
example of the above mentioned methodology with GUI integration done in the
Symbol Import Dialog.

It would be great if others could add their ideas as well.

I think my previous mail explains what I am trying to achieve. I too was
boggled by the GUI challenge that I found it difficult to give a common
interface. Making remote integration with server in the core library and
integrating the import of resources in the respective GUI parts of the
desktop application, might be a bit lot to build. But I think that way we
are making it more seamless.

What do you think?

Sure. I mentioned the GUI issue,as I find it probably the most divergent part. 
All the rest (API for up/downloading, voting etc, qgs classes for storing 
metadata and handling communication, and the django part) could be probably 
easily unified... However look two paragraphs further.

Exactly.

So you used server-side filtering. My approach is different. First download 
metadata of all available and installed plugins to a metadata registry, then 
process it (filter, sort etc) locally. The metadata registry is just a nested 
QMap: 

QMap< QString plugin_id, QMap< QString property, QString value > >

Did you considered such approach? And if so, what downsides you see? I'm 
afraid for plugins it's the only solution, because of metadata complexity [1] 
and the need of finding updates at startup.

For styles, it looks like an overkill at this stage, however, if you'd like to 
implement filtering/sorting by votes or versioning/updating (like in plugins) 
in the future, I encourage you to consider refactoring the idea unless it's 
too late :-)

Instead of simple QMap of QMaps, there could be also some dedicated classes:

QgsAbstractMetadataRegistry ( containing a map of QgsAbstractMetadata )
QgsPluginMetadataRegistry ( containing a map of QgsPluginMetadata)
QgsSymbolMetadataRegistry ( containing a map of QgsSymbolMetadata)
etc. 

The QgsAbstractMetadataRegistry class could contain methods for fetching, 
downloading, uploading, voting etc. 

If you prefer to stay with your approach, probably the currently implemented 
core part of the installer has to remain separated, however, 
auhentication/upload/voting API probably can be shared. I'm not very familiar 
with the existing repository django app though.

I hope I didn't drive you mad with this idea of refactoring ;-))

Regards,
B.

Hi,

Problems on this topic have been reported several times.
- OGR SQL: REPACK fails if filename includes non-ascii characters,
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8391
- Fail create a spatial index with shape file that contain Japanese in

- spatial index fails, http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1295

I think these problems have not been completely fixed. Please see
#7794 and #8391 for the steps to reproduce the problems. I would like
to fix the problems before the 2.0 release. There is a pull request to
fix the problems.
