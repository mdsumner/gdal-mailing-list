How does the wxGUI know that the option should be placed in Selection tab?

Hi Alexandre,

why not save such data in the folder under QGIS home directory (~/.qgis2)?
You can easily get path to this directory with the QGIS API and data in this
directory will be safe even when plugin removed.

It is defined using guisection:

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/vector/v.distance/main.c#L97

In the XML it looks like:

    <parameter name="from_layer" type="string" required="no" multiple="no">
        <label>
            Layer number or name (from)
        </label>
        ...
        <guisection>
            From
        </guisection>
    </parameter>

It is not defined what should happen with the ones which do not have
guisection, i.e. it is up to you to decide and it doesn't make sense for
GRASS GIS to enforce one representation or the other. The old behavior in
wxGUI was that all required options/parameters were in the Required tab and
all with non defined guisection were in Optional tab together with all
flags without guisection specified. The current (and better) behavior is
that wxGUI respects the guisection specified for required
options/parameters and (if it is actually specified) includes a red star to
a field description. In this case, it is up to the module to have it
defined nicely which means that module should specify guisection for every
required parameter if it is defining it for at least one (i.e. define all
or nothing). The Optional tab still behaves the same and contains all
not-required options/parameters without guisection. So now Required and
Optional behave the same -- as fallbacks.

Unfortunately this hasn't tested well.... the results seem quite
random (reporting changes on files which haven't been touched) and
I've been unsuccessful with contacting Scrutinizer's support to figure
out why.

Tim (or someone else with admin rights to the git repo) - can you
remove this from the QGIS repo for now? We can re-enable if
Scrutinizer are able to fix these issues....

Message-ID: <CAB28Asid4grRN-7f6UOTKGjmtt3r4gZTOh57zCYeusjkWtRRcA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Radim (+list),

I'm just wondering what the status on the GRASS provider unit test is.
It currently seems to fail on all platforms (eg
http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=32702706&build=198123).
Is this an expected failure or revealing a real issue?

Cheers,

?Thanks. Nyall we are testing it on InaSAFE - when we have a good handle on
how it works I will revisit its use on QGIS.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What is "Discourage other labels from covering

Message-ID: <CAECJsSokbwJ6kii6SNxHyL0tariqRW0neBwDvWjVFVc9xRRNKQ@mail.gmail.com>

In QGIS master (524716f), Layer's Properties > Labels, where we use to
select in a combobox the field to label, there is now a combobox with
options like :
- No labels;
- Show labels for this layer;
- Discourage other labels from covering features in this layer.
I'd like to understand why this third option is there and what it does
(since choosing it just deactivates labels properties - just like "No
labels" option).
If it's supposed to set the layer features as obstacles for other layer's
labels, shouldn't it be a checkbox in Labels > rendering > Obstacles?
Moreover, someone may want to show labels of a layer but discourage other
layers to have their labels covering the features of the first layer. Is
that possible with this configuration without duplicating the layer?

Thanks

It was bug in the unit test, changes in the provider were not
reflected in the unit test. Fixed in cc1888, passes on Linux.

There's a little more detail about the change here [1]. But basically,
in the past it was only possible for a layer to act as an obstacle for
labeling if the layer itself had labels. This isn't ideal - eg in my
current project I have a water bodies layer which isn't labelled, but
I still want to avoid labels for roads/features being placed over the
water features where possible.

So this change was made so that you can now have layers act as
obstacles without being labelled themselves. I agree that the UI for
this isn't ideal, but I couldn't come up with a better approach. This
setting needs to be grouped with the label properties, and it's also
important to make it clear that if you label a layer it can still act
as an obstacle layer.

I do have one followup change planned, which is to move the actual
widgets for configuring the obstacle behaviour (eg the obstacle
priority and polygon obstacle behaviour combobox) into a new
"obstacles" setting pane (placed under the existing
buffer/shadow/placement/... etc panes). Then this obstacle pane would
be set as the only visible pane when the mode is set to "discourage
other labels...", since the settings there apply also to obstacle-only
layers. Make sense?

I'm not tied to this approach, and am open to a better UX for this.
Mockups are welcome!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with QgsPluginLayerRegistry
Message-ID: <CAPHDReL0xYOtD_qT-jQK1UBA-ATBN6wwsmmTvRKCLv3V5A+4gg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
it seems to me that the QgsPluginLayerRegistry does not upcast the
object types correctly when createLayer() is called.

I have written a Python test that shows this problem.
Code and output of my test is located at pastebin.com:

http://pastebin.com/x68ft55D

In the example code i created a TestLayer class derived from QgsPluginLayer.
I created the according TestLayerType and registered them in the
QgsPluginLayerRegistry.

When calling createLayer() of the registry the registered TestLayerType object
seems to create the correct object. however, the TestLayer object is
casted to QgsPluginLayer
by the registry and the wrong functions are called (draw() and
noise()) from the base class.

I have no idea if this is a compiler problem, but i am not able to use
the QgsPluginLayer concept
in my QGIS plugin.

The problem appeared on Ubuntu 14.04 64Bit on AMD and Intel CPU.
C++ version is (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4.
I have tested the script with qgis-2.8.1 and 2.11 r7934a92. It fails
in booth cases.

The watermark plugin seems to be affected as well.

Any idea howto fix this?

Best regards
Soeren

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Expression context and custom functions
Message-ID: <55E86370.1040300@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I am using custom expressions functions for a plugin.
Something like this :

class MyFunction( QgsExpression.Function ):
    def func( self, values, feature, parent ):
        feature.geometry()
        ...

The problem is that "feature" is now a QgsExpressionContext(), not a
QgsFeature anymore.
I cannot find how to access the feature from the context. Did I miss
something ?

Thanks

Maybe I've misunderstood, but are you trying to define a new function
to appear as an expression? Isn't that what the @qgsfunction decorator
does? Do you need to define a new class for this?

This is what the decorator does.
Except that I need it in a plugin: using the decorator rather than a
manual register/unregister make it crash on each reloading (I need to
reload it quickly during the development).

But even with the decorator, the problem is still the same: the
'feature' parameter of the custom function is not a QgsFeature anymore
as it was on previous versions, but a QgsExpressionContext. And it seems
there is no way to access the feature through the expression context.

Looking at the source, the feature is stored in a variable called
"_feature_", but trying to access this from the function returns None.

Does http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13162 count as a show stopper? It makes
rasters totally unusable in 2.10 on OSX.

Hi guys,
I?m compiling QGis 2.9 on windows 10 platform, and when it was done, I found there?re some buttons don?t have icon images. But I checked the qgisapp ui file, there were image sources and the image files were just there too.
Why is that?
Hope someone can help me with this problem, thanks a lot.

The old API is fixed in 9133538 - sorry about that. I've renamed the
new method to funcV2 in the Python bindings.

Should also be fixed with 9133538, but I'd appreciate confirmation.

Hi Jacory,

I encountered the similar issue on my Mac OSX homebrew environment,
and at that time, the cause was the difference of compiled Qt version
(4.8.7) and loaded Qt version (4.8.6).
https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/issues/95

If you follow the QGIS MSVC build instruction, could you try to launch
"qgis.2.9.0.sln" from command prompt after executing the environment
variables batch file,
then run(debug) "qgis" project after setting it as "Startup project" ?
(Because I think that launching the project after executing the batch file
will guarantee
to load same Qt library as compiled one.)

Regards,

Ko

I tried QGIS Xcode build once, but it failed at loading Xcode project time.
So, if you want to build QGIS on Mac environment, I think that "Qt
Creator" is the
only choice. (But, I still don't try it yet...)

Probably, the following page is useful.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] wps4server: QGIS Processing to Web Processing
	Service
Message-ID: <55ED8D01.2070400@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm proud to announce the publication of wps4server: 
https://github.com/3liz/qgis-wps4server

wps4server is a QGIS Server Plugin that provides OGC Web Processing 
capabilities, based on PyWPS and QGIS Processing.
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps
http://pywps.wald.intevation.org/

With wps4server you can publish all the QGIS Processing algorithms 
through Web Processing. This means you can create a Web Processing 
Service that provides :
* QGIS algorithms
* GRASS7 algorithms
* GDAL/OGR algorithms
* Orfeo Toolbox algorithms
* SAGA algorithms

But also your :
* R scripts algorithms
* Python scripts algorithms
* Models algorithms

With a configuration file, you can restrict the algorithms number based on :
* a provider list
* name and title filter
* an algorithm list

You can find the source code and an installation guide here :
https://github.com/3liz/qgis-wps4server

Test and feedback are welcome !

Awesome!

This is a great example of what can be done with QGIS Server Python plugins.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] translate shortcuts
Message-ID: <1441637438729-5222943.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello.

I want to translate a menu name which has a shortcuts when Alt key is
pressed. 

/self.templMenu.setTitle(self.tr('&Templates'))/

The letter of shortcuts is defined with symbol '&'. In my example the menu
name is 'templates' and when 'Alt + t' is pressed the menu is opened.

When I write the 'my_plugin_es.ts' file to translate it and then compile to
'my_plugin_es.qm', it desn't work. Any idea how I have to write the menu
name in the 'my_plugin_es.ts' file?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] no more map ?
Message-ID: <20150907174431.GA20864@localhost>

I'm running qgis from master after a long time and facing
a gui that does not show the map:

 http://strk.keybit.net/tmp/qgis-nomap.png

Where the map should be, a "Recent Projects" tab is shown,
near a "News" tab, but I can't find any way to remove those
screens to unveal the map again.

The "View"->"Panel" menu only has "Layers" and "Browser" checked.
Where is my map ? Is this experience intended by design ?

Hi Sandro,

There are three possibilities:

* Open a recent (or not-so-recent) project
* Click the "new project" button
* Add a layer to the canvas

The welcome screen should only be shown when the mapcanvas is empty anyway.

Cheers,
Matthias

Right, that's the problem. I used "Add PostGIS Layer", selected
those two tables, and hit "Load". The commit id can be seen in
the titlebar. I hadn't tried to reproduce with that same commit,
and I could not reproduce (on first try) with current master.
Possible race condition ?

There were some changes in that area of the code in the last 2 weeks, so
if it works with current master I guess it's ok to assume it's fixed
until somebody complains.

Have a look in the 'QGIS plugin builder'-plugin sources or in it's
makefile. I had that one working with translations some time ago.

Hello,

Finally I defined first the text and then I added to the name menu. Now it
works

/text = self.tr('Templates')
self.templMenu.setTitle('&' + text) /

'my_plugin_es.ts' looks like:

/<message>
    <location filename="my_pluging.py" line="70"/>
    <source>Templates</source>
    <translation>Plantillas</translation>
</message>/

In English the shortcut works pressing 'Alt + t', and in Spanish the
shortcut works now pressing 'Alt + p'

thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Deliberate errors, but Travis passes
Message-ID: <1441714140713-5223114.post@n6.nabble.com>

I've implemented very basic Travis testing for the plugin qgis2web, and it's
been working very well, catching code errors which result in Python errors.
However, I'm now trying to expand the suite of tests to test the plugin
against different data. The problem I have is that I now cannot get Travis
to fail a build. I have tried adding deliberate errors which cause Python
errors when running the plugin, but Travis still passes.

The file with the tests is:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/test/test_qgis2web_dialog.py

Can anyone help?

Hi qgis-developers,

I produce my own network analysis software sDNA (www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna<http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna>).  It currently runs as a plugin for ArcGIS or Autocad, from the command line, with a standalone GUI, or through a Python API.

We would like to create a QGIS plugin that allows people to use sDNA from inside QGIS.  sDNA is free but not open source, still I believe this can be done within the terms of the GPL by running sDNA in a separate process with pipe or file communication.  That said, I'd like to know whether a plugin that loosely connects to proprietary software would be welcome in the first place.

What are your thoughts?

Best regards

Crispin

Hi Tom,

I mostly use the normal assert or one of its unittest twins
https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#assert-methods to
compare calculated results against expected results.
I didn't find any of these in your file, so I am not sure, what exactly
should trigger a test failure there.

Some (almost 100%) sure things :
* a Python "import" means GPL "contamination"
* Calling an external process communicating through pipe or file does
not imply GPL contamination

I would say that it is safe to have a qgis plugin calling a proprietary
external process.
That said, I also think that your external process should not be a
necessary part to run your software, otherwise it may be considered as a
strong connection or inclusion, and be subject to GPL contamination. If
it is optional, no problem. This specific point has to be verified
though, not 100% sure.

Hi Matthias

This is the very early stages of implementing unittest. In time, I will test
for expected results using assert methods. At the moment, though, all I want
this to achieve is to catch Python errors, to prevent my making releases
which crash. This is what I was doing before, and it worked as I needed: if
the plugin gave a Python error, Travis failed - if not, it passed. This no
longer seems to work, though - as I say, if I introduce a deliberate error
to the code, and confirm that the plugin gives a Python error, Travis
nevertheless passes.

Thanks

Tom

Hi Tom,

In this case please read my question as "where exactly do you expect the
tests to fail?" :-)

I did a short check and it looks like it causes a segfault at the moment
and this is somehow not picked up properly?

Though looking at your commit for the deliberate error you are looking
for an exception but it is unclear to me via which codepath the tests
should get from the test file to the point in the code where you
introduced the deliberate error.

Hi Matthias

Firstly, I'm not aware of a current segfault in the tests, so I'll keep an
eye out for that.

Yes, I am talking about exceptions thrown by Python. The deliberate error I
have introduced is in the main function called when a map is exported in
Leaflet format (ie not in Openlayers3). This means that about half of the
tests should fail (the ones with Leaflet in the function name). However,
they all pass for me.

Thanks

Tom

Hi QGIS,

IF you attend the next hackfest, I think it would be good to add the
topics you will be working on. Also to see/ask for collobaration.

I started with some documentation related stuff:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/14th_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Gran_Canaria_2015#Topics

Hi Richard,

These are my objectives in Canaria meeting :

1) add a 3D menu in QGIS, and its relative functions  (for example:
VTerrain, qgis2threejs, GEarthView, DronePlanner etcetera).

2)   solve the blocker "minidump" problem  (
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13272  ).


Where we need to insert our own objectives  ?   At what point of the page ?
You can place yourself an example that we can clone?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating field with a trigger
Message-ID: <4958049.19YQ3Yqsuz@tatras>

Hello,

I have a small project with a sqlite db. There is a layer with a trigger on a 
field #1 to calculate an addition and put the result in another field (#2).

When I edit the initial field #1, the second field #2 is not updated in the 
form. I need to close the form and open it again to see the result.

Do you think this is a known limitation or a bug?

My point of view is that it is a limitation, as QGIS don't know that a trigger 
can change a value in the same feature server side.

I don't know if QGIS should or could get an update of the data server side 
before display the form content.

In case there is no such plan, do you think we can add some logic in a python 
script to force the form update (I can ask to Arnaud next week on this topic).

Thanks,

Y.

Hi Yves,

I have only experience with PostgreSQL but I assume that sqlite behaves 
similar. If you edit a feature in QGIS your layer is in edit mode 
(allowing for undo/redo). Changes are committed only when you click on 
the respective button. This results in an update statement sent to your 
db which then calls your trigger. Thus field#2 is not changed when you 
change #1 _in QGIS_. In order to have such behaviour AFAIK you would 
have to do it in Python (which would be totally independent from the db 
trigger then).

Apart from that if
field#2 = field#1 + x
then field#2 is totally redundant. You could either create a view 
containing this field or create a virtual field in QGIS.

Bernhard

still this should be considered an option to show the resulting value to 
the user instead of having it in a field of its own.

I just simplified for the test case. This is more complicated but was not

Humm, I need to think a little bit on this. I am not sure that move some logic 
from the db to QGIS is always a good things. 

One of the use case which lead me to let this logic in the DB is when I use 
this field in several part (for example, in a layer in QGIS and in a website, 
for an export with ogr2ogr or event in several layers in QGIS). 

It is easier to manage one location (ie the trigger) than several (in QGIS if 
we use this field in different layer). I need to check this but we are in such 
use case.

Anyway, I agree with you in other use case that it is easier to manage this as 
a virtual field, much less trouble :)

A view would be perfectly suitable for this.

You could hide the field from the view and add a virtual field in QGIS
that does the same calculation, that's probably easier than python

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin maintenance
Message-ID: <bffe56180d3c47d5b2351b73bf890a18@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Hi,

Recently, I updated the GarminCustomMap plugin which I developed a few years ago, because users reported that it crashes QGIS.

Unfortunately, the bug reports (the plugin uses the QGIS bug tracker system and repository) never were forwarded to me, so I noticed them only with a significant delay...
So I was wondering if it is preferred that plugin authors use their own versioning and bug tracking solution (github in my case)?

Furthermore, the plugin worked nicely with QGIS 2.0 to 2.4. While problems were reported for 2.6 and later. I did not change the plugin-code in that period, so issues must have been introduced by external changes (likely in GDAL/OGR and their windows packages). I see that it is impossible to prevent such issues, as plugins are by nature not core. But how should plugin authors deal with that? Simply send bug reports back to QGIS (in my case it came from there...)?

Kind regards,
Stefan

P.S.: For me it seems that it was sufficient to simply rebuild the plugin skeleton with latest Plugin-Builder (which was about time anyway), but sometimes identifying the problem can be quite time consuming and frustrating...

Hi all,
we are finding a few small issues with this very useful command:

* new connections are not listed on the list of connections; QGIS has to
be restarted to take the new connection into account
* the output SR is compulsory (without it it silently fails): better use
the input SR as a default.

Should I open tickets about this?
All the best.

I had a look and libgeos-c1v5 and its dependecies seems to be installed.

Some ideas?

Assuming your using Debian/Ubuntu, since GEOS 3.5.0 the geos libraries 
have moved to the Multi-Arch library paths (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ 
on amd64).

It looks like you're specifying GEOS_LIBRARY manually, FindGEOS supports 
both the traditional and Multi-Arch library paths.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi all,
Nyall, Thanks for the feedback and the work you've done. I read your
article few weeks ago but didn't try the new functions till last day.

I agree that layer, regardless it is labelled or not, should offer the
option of being an obstacle of any other layer's label. I suppose you mean
that, as far as possible, labels from another layer shouldn't "touch"
interior or boundary of the layer's features. I can easily figure it out
for point and polyline layer but not that easy for polygon (except for
boundaries). You didn't write about but would you mind explaining the
expected behaviour of "Over the feature's interior" - for polygons - in
"minimise placing labels" options. What can be its use case?

Sorry, I'm not an UI expert but what about adding a checkbox "Discourage
other labels from covering features in this layer" in top of the old
checkbox "Label this layer with" in Labels tab ? We then have two
checkboxes:
- the first one manages the relation with the labels of other layers
- and the other one for labelling the layer as we use to (with its current
sub-tabs).
Then the layer can be labelled and/or "obstacled" without interference.
What may be difficult with this schema is that it doesn't handle the
"minimise placing labels" options, unless adding a combobox after the first
checkbox (available for polygons).
I think user should clearly identify whether the obstacle option is within
the layer (in render tab) or against other layers (the top checkbox).

Regards,
DelazJ

Hi Bas and Sandro,
don't know what I have done, but I've configured and generated the make
file again and I was able to compile the dev version.

@Sandro: the libgeos-dev was already installed

Thanks!

Hi Vincent, thank you for your reply.

The QGIS plugin would not be essential to the external process as sDNA works on its own anyway.  The external process would however be essential to the QGIS plugin.

Is there any sort of official position on this, e.g. from the steering committee?

Best regards

Crispin

Some (almost 100%) sure things :
* a Python "import" means GPL "contamination"
* Calling an external process communicating through pipe or file does not imply GPL contamination

I would say that it is safe to have a qgis plugin calling a proprietary external process.
That said, I also think that your external process should not be a necessary part to run your software, otherwise it may be considered as a strong connection or inclusion, and be subject to GPL contamination. If it is optional, no problem. This specific point has to be verified though, not 100% sure.

Hi,
I do not think we have an official position: we stick to the GPL
licence. I admit that the interpretation may be sometimes tricky, but in
these case it's only a lawyer (or better a judge) that can give a
definite answer.
In general I thin Vincent has outlined the prevailing interpretation.
All the best.

IMHO using only GitHub is the simplest option, and it works well enough.
Of course, I do not like it being proprietary software, but since QGIS
code is already there, I think we can't complain.

Yes, I think that's the correct approach.

Thanks for the report.

Just thinking aloud here: If the plugin would support analysis with sDNA
and let's say GRASS GIS network analysis tools then sDNA would be just one
of the options, thus not essential, so thing might be ok. But you should
consider the full GPL way. There are reasons why people are using it :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server does not release files after each
 request - OGROpenShared instead of OGROpen ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO62o0ZZ7=u7FfOyg58hzG1VA=pkXaf_cigNH3EwjFMWtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

We are trying to use QGIS Server with nginx / supervisor instead of
classical Apache / mod_fcgid.

We have seen that for each server request, such as a GetMap responding an
image rendered from a single Shapefile (or Tiff, of whatever), QGIS Server
opens a new access to the file.

Exemple number found via the lsof command, after some requests

lsof /tmp/someShapefile.shp | wc -l
126

which means here 126 requests has been processed by QGIS Server, but the
access to Shapfile has never been released. Each requests leads to a new
file handler.

Imagine a project with several layers, and a web map with many users /
requests --> this lead rapidly to many opening of the same files open for
nothing, and can cause issues.

In Apache configuration, this was not sensible, as mod_fcgid and Apache
kill QGIS Server worker after N completed requests, and it seems the ulimit
used is the system limit.

In our configuration, supervisor has by default a ulimit of 1024 files
opened. This limit is vers fast reached ( 1024 requests only ). We could
tune this configuration, but it seems to walk aournd the issue without
solving its origin.


We have 2 ways of dealing with it :

* Make sure QGIS Server does not open a data file each time a request needs
it --> we will investigate if the cache is well used

* We could also use GDALOpenShared instead of GDALOpen , and OGROpenShared
instead of OGROpen in QGIS provider code:

GDALOpenShared :
http://www.gdal.org/gdal_8h.html#a46a02c21047d78f88f8abb1ff6b14ae2
OGROpen in QGIS :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ogropen&type=Code


Any idea, comment appreciated !

Regards,
Micha?l

Message-ID: <CAJy=Xtf8K2hY9TVun9ytFTc-NH6R7gGmRwDtMj2wvXiVN2qVaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

when I need to isolate the current atlas feature in map views I currently
enable the rule based feature style and I set the rule to "$atlasfeatureid
= $id" following this tutorial:
http://nathanw.net/2013/12/02/waiting-for-qgis-2-2-highlighting-current-atlas-feature/
I'm wondering if there is an easier method, accessible for the common gis
user, to do this avoiding expressions and complex styling methods, and if
it's possible to control this behaviour directly from "controlled by altas"
slot in map item properties tab as from the attached sample image.

Hi all,

I recently recoded Processing's Dissolve. The changes fundamentally 
reduced the runtime of the algorithm. In the pull request discussion [1] 
Matthias and I came to a point where we were wondering about the future 
of fTools and Processing. I found this discussion from May [2]. What is 
the current status and road map in this respect?

If you can name algorithms to be ported I am willing to do it.

IMHO it would be great if we could get rid of the redundancy in the next 
LTR release.

Sorry for the late answer.

I will look at the github issue and see what is going on. I have made some
improvements in future Lizmap release, and tested the differents demo
projects against it, so things should be ok now.
Comparing between servers is not always possible, depending of QGIS Server
versions.

Objet : [Qgis-developer] view only current feature in atlas maps
Date : ven., sept. 11, 2015 10:49

Hi list,

when I need to isolate the current atlas feature in map views I currently enable the rule based feature style and I set the rule to "$atlasfeatureid = $id" following this tutorial: http://nathanw.net/2013/12/02/waiting-for-qgis-2-2-highlighting-current-atlas-feature/
I'm wondering if there is an easier method, accessible for the common gis user, to do this avoiding expressions and complex styling methods, and if it's possible to control this behaviour directly from "controlled by altas" slot in map item properties tab as from the attached sample image.

Regards
Enrico Ferreguti

Hi all,
thanks for raising this point, IMHO a serious one. I'm very much in
favour of removing redundancy. In this case, however, I think we better
be careful before removing fTools, because:

* people are used to it, and for one-shot analyses it is (slightly)
easier to run than Processing (weak argument)
* we do not have enough development resources to make Processing
bulletproof, particularly for 3rd party backends; therefore, we
encounter occasional problems, and we cannot guarantee a smooth user
experience in all cases (strong argument).

First issue can be solved, as suggested, by adding menu shortcuts to
Processing analyses, to mimic existing situation.
Second one is more serious: IMHO we really need a dedicated developer in
this area: any power user (=larger institutions) are willing to take it?
Similar things may be said for GDALTools.
All the best.

Aside from the syntax...I am not sure it is a good idea...

I mean, it is a good idea to allow optional parameters...but that is a
big change in the current semantics of Processing algorithms. Some
params can be optional (layers, tables), and have a setting for that.
When they are not used, their value is None, but the value has to be
passed (so an optional layer param is a layer param that can be None).
Allowing optional parameters would require some importante changes in
many places in Processing, specially in the modeler, so i would
suggest some more discussion about this.

Not sure if that can maybe be added to the WPS plugin part, so nothing
changes in Processing, but the WPS service exposes the parameters as
optional and then fills the values with a default one before actually
callin gprocessing.

Hope this helps

I think Arnaud also raised the question sometime ago (my fault for not
commenting on that at the time...), and it should be easy to add those
shortcuts, but I haven't had much time lately for working on
Processing.

I wont be attending the next Hackfest, but sounds like a task that can
be accomplished in those days, and I will be happy to help remotely or
take it completely and try to develop a subsystem in Processing to
customize the menus and toolbars with Processing algorithms.

Hope this helps

Another proposal : in the gui for rule base rendering, we could add a new
column in the rules tables, name "Activate only for atlas", which will
allow the user to toggle each rule. If the checkbox is checked, the rule is
used only in atlas.
This way the user can tune more easily, in the context of QGIS vector layer
properties.
I do not like having checkbox in the composer, since the composer is not
always opened and visible.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Managing plugins that depend on other plugins
Message-ID: <55F2C9F3.6030208@oslandia.com>

Hi,

The problem already happened when I developed processing plugins (which
depend on processing), now it happens because I'm developing a complex
plugin with some parts that will be useful as independent plugins (so I
developed them as plugins): there is no clean way that I know about to
specify dependencies and inform the user when they are not available.

It would be nice if the plugin manager could use a list of dependencies
to activate several plugins at a time.

The same mechanism could also be used to test if non-standard
dependencies required by a plugin are available.

It could be in metadata.txt, or, even better, in requirements.txt, what
do you think ?

I agree with Micha?l. I do not mean to modify styles from composer. Checking the option in composer should not influence map styles. It should only control feature visibility on atlas map item.

Not tested yet. I will do it.

Another question: I am trying to access the current atlas geometry from
a plugin, but fail to do so.
>From the python console, with a atlas in preview mode :
QgsExpression.specialColumn("$atlasgeometry") -> None
QgsExpression("$atlasgeometry").evaluate() -> None

However, if I set a layer's label to "$atlasfeatureid", I get the right
label ...

Is it intended ? I guess that is because the "global" expression
evaluation has no atlas context ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server does not release files after each
 request - OGROpenShared instead of OGROpen ?

Hi

I tested a quick and dirty patch, by replacing all occurences of OGROpen
byt OGROpenShared in QGIS source, then rebuild and test server side --> No
locks anymore ! QGIS Server works like a charm here, without increasing the
number of opening for the same file.

The only (but big) problem, is that this seems to be not thread safe, so it
makes QGIS Desktop segfault. For example, I just started QGIS 2.8.3 with my
patch, and it segfaults when "Browser" pannel read the content of my
favorite folders (and find Shapefiles). I am pretty sure that the
multithreaded rendering would also cause it to segfault.

No worries for the Server side, since it is not multithreaded by conception.

We are investigating this issue and will report back here.

Cheers
Micha?l

Hi all,

It means, as you know, that QGIS was run with a version of GRASS
different from that used for compilation.

You are right, fixed in 95e9ade.

That's true. Is there any reason you aren't accessing the atlas
feature/geometry directly? Why go through the expression engine to
retrieve this?

Mmm, nice addition though!
But maybe it lacks an option to not use it :-)

Another observation: when I create a line, and use the nodetool to edit
one line, after clicking on a node, it immediately 'sticks' to the mouse
and moves. In 2.8 the vertex only get's 'selected' and after this
selecting you can move it. Is this intended behaviour?

Can anyone confirm?

Yes it is. Although, there will be another pre-selection state which will correspond to 2.8 behavior.
Although, on first click it will free the node.
The idea is that you don?t need to keep mouse button pressed while moving the node to allow using advanced digitising.

Marco has still some work to do in the node tool, you can follow discussion here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13276 <http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13276>

Regarding the table view, I don?t know if Marco will allow disabling it. At least, it would be nice to just hide it.

That was introduced when moving the CAD map tools to the gui library. It

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Project Snapping Options
Message-ID: <55F5CB78.9080505@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I just realized that the "Snapping Options" entry in the "Settings" menu
is related to the project configuration. As such, I think it should go
to the "Project Properties" or at least to the "Project" menu.

I was expecting that changes in this dialog will modify the application
settings. The application settings can be changed from the "Settings ->
Options" menu but are overridden by the project settings. They only
serve as defaults for newly generated projects.

I would expect that I could either set the project settings to inherit
from the application settings or that I could set the application
settings to override the project settings.

Did I miss something obvious or is the behavior strange indeed?

Hi Matthias,

I asked this questions some weeks ago [0]
Good to see that I'm not the only one getting confused :-)

We must make things more clear one way or another.

The new changes assume:
 - User always wants to move a vertex
 - Only one single vertex is selected

But in general, the node tool is also heavily used for deleting, adding and moving vertices. With the new behaviour it is a bit confusing for users how the other tasks can be done, when it gets automatically locked on a single node.

Cheers,
Saber

Mmm, nice addition though!
But maybe it lacks an option to not use it :-)

Another observation: when I create a line, and use the nodetool to edit
one line, after clicking on a node, it immediately 'sticks' to the mouse
and moves. In 2.8 the vertex only get's 'selected' and after this
selecting you can move it. Is this intended behaviour?

Yes it is. Although, there will be another pre-selection state which will correspond to 2.8 behavior.
Although, on first click it will free the node.
The idea is that you don?t need to keep mouse button pressed while moving the node to allow using advanced digitising.

Marco has still some work to do in the node tool, you can follow discussion here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13276

Regarding the table view, I don?t know if Marco will allow disabling it. At least, it would be nice to just hide it.

Hi Saber,

Thanks for reporting.
That was introduced when moving the CAD map tools to the gui library. It
should be fixed now.

There's a long blocker list relating to regressions in the map tools, eg:

- deleting a node: the rubber band is not removed
- deleting a node: when finished, the next node should be pre-selected
(this pre-selection should by synchro with the table view selection
model).
- right-click should cancel the edition of the node (but keeps it pre-selected)
- for point layers, there is no visual feedback of the point being
moved (no rubberband)
- editing in table view: changes should be applied to the rubberband
on keypress (not on editing finished), and when editing is finished it
should ends the digitizing (clear rubberband)
( all from http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13276)
- split tool errors: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13273 and
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13347
- inability to add parts to null geometries - refs
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12885

I tried to do some digitising in master last week and honestly it was
unusable for geometry editing. Lots of regressions and unexpected
behaviour compared to the smooooth editing machine that 2.8 is! I
understand master is a work-in-progress, but can we get some
confirmation of which issues will be addressed prior to 2.14?
Marco/Denis? If there's no funding to address these then I think they
should be prioritised for the 2.14 bug fixing period.

Personally for me unless we can get the whole thing nice and smooth I
really think the old click-drag still should stay as default and the
click-click mode + tools is added to ctrl modifier.  I know it adds more
complexity but I don't think "move" is the default action we should take on
a node unless we are told that is what the user is wanting to do.  I also
understand the desire to be more cad like and add more control on the
drawing tools but unless done right it's going to give people a bad
experience.

Yeah I agree.  Not sure it makes much sense to be in the Settings menu when
it's not application wide. I would just move it to the project menu.

No, old behavior should be brought back:
- when you click on a node, it moves but you can delete directly (so no
changes in terms of click)
- selecting several nodes should put them in pre-selection mode (hence
you can delete it).

Best wishes,
Denis

At the risk of stating the obvious, selecting multiple nodes (to move or
delete those) has to come back. I do lots of digitizing and shipping 2.12
in its current state would be a very significant regression.

Hi,

Marco agreed to participate in our paid bug fixing program that should 
start after feature freeze (which - according to our website - is on 
September 26. If PSC votes for him - he can then work several days 
dedicated to bug fixing.

Marco is traveling the next two weeks (FOSS4G South Korea) - but I 
assume - after he is back, he can continue working on the 
digitizing/geometry issues.

I am not sure that QGIS bug fixing program is the right way to go.

It wouldn't be fair that an unfinished paid work is pushed to master and
later on the group sponsors the end of the development.

I suggest to wait for Marco's answer regarding the schedule for fixing
the node tool.

I think that waiting again 2 weeks is a bit long as this tool is crucial
in QGIS. If he can't make it, then the solution of paid bug fixing by
another dev can be discussed, but that's a bit odd to me.

This is a great fix! It's important to optimize resources, expecially

Thanks for the clarification.
I now retrieve it through the atlas composition in the new version of

Hi Paolo,

just a thought: AFAIK fTools does not use 3rd party backends, so the 
question of bulletproofness in conjunction with fTools IMHO should only 
be raised for those algorithms that are currently in "QGIS 
geoalgorithms". (Otherwise I fully agree: the rest should work flawlessly)
As I said I would be willing to port what has not been ported yet and/or 
look over algorithms that do not work as expected.
In spring the question of icons has been raised, too. This should not be 
forgetten, either.

Hi Bernhard,

The current code redundancy does have some severe issues like:

 * Algorithms may give different results from the vector menu and
processing (although both labelled similar, [QGIS] Geoprocessing)
 * Bugs need to be fixed twice
 * Features need to be implemented twice

If I remember right, somebody was working on a C++ implementation of
fTools recently. Does that ring a bell somewhere? It would be a pitty if
you work on this and a new implementation is merged at the same time.

After this question has been answered, a big +1 from my side to work on
this.
And another +1 if we get some unittests for the algorithms. They are
actually perfect candidates for unittests.

Kind regards
Matthias

I would need hints on tickets addressing such problems. If that is 
really the case who is going to decide what the "right" result is? 
Alternatively we could keep both but label them differently.

are they currently?

are they currently?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Geometry precision model
Message-ID: <55F67BA1.8080007@oslandia.com>

Hi,

I am investigating a better handling of different precision models
within QGIS geometry operations, and in particular the "fixed" precision
model.

Since geometry processing in QGIS relies mostly on GEOS, I think this is
close to the kind of discussion that can be found in PostGIS:
https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/ToleranceDiscussion

I see it as:
- storing somewhere as a global parameter, the current precision model
(in project parameters?), i.e. the current "grid"
- adding a way to set the "global" precision model to the Geometry API
- make the Geometry API use this precision model

For the last point, I see two possibilities :

- since we rely on the GEOS C API, which does not allow to modify the
precision model (always the default - floating), it would require to add
some new functions in the C API to change the precision model for
coordinate constructions

- using the C++ GEOS API instead of the C API that exposes precision models.

I am not sure yet about what possibility to implement. Is there anything
that prevent us from using the C++ GEOS API ? Having it in the C API may
also benefit to other projects (PostGIS) ...

I don't know, maybe Paolo has some experiences?

For now, I would just dump one of the two implementations and if
problems surface decide case-by-case about the procedure (duplication or
introduction of an additional parameter).

Hi

Side note: that are now some ogr2ogr based equivalent algorithms available,
that on average have significantly better performance than their ftools
counterparts. Up until recently the absence of virtual vectors in
Processing did not allow creating algorithms requiring two or more layers.
But that feature was added in the latest developer meeting by Luigi Pirelli.

My point is: it may be worth considering abandoning some ftools algorithms
in favour of ogr2ogr based ones.

Cheers

Hi Matthias,

sorry, I was not aware that new algorithms currently get implemented in 
both, fTools and Processing (same for bug fixes). This may be because of 
my ignorance, as I only adressed Processing with both, bug fixes and new 
algorithms since it had been introduced.

Salut Hugo,

I believe that Sourcepole (Sandro Mani) worked on this already - but the 
GEOS patch is pending and was not yet accepted.

See also:
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/713
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2015-January/007080.html

Best to discuss with him - and maybe help to get Sandro Santilli to 
review this patch and hopefully accept it.

Andreas

Normally, I would be present at next hackfest and interested in working 
on this.

 From my point of view, the task would be:

  * Create a customizable vector menu based on Processing like proposed
    by Victor at Nodebo
  * List fTools menu entries, with candidates Processing algorithms, and
    differences that need to be solved.
  * Porting algorithms that has not yet been ported
  * Complete some algorithms with new parameters or createcustom dialogs
    close to fTools ones when need.
  * Get processing plugin fully translated (already working on this)

Your contribution to the discussion on the mailing list would greatly
help moving the patch forward. I think adding the possibility to set
PrecisionModel via the C-API is the way to go, just not sure about the
details about the interface. Drafting an implementation in QGIS might
help evaluating the latest proposal better.

Yes the linking and licensing restrictions of GPL comes up many time but can be solved in edge cases - you might want to look at the (now defunct) SQLAnywhere plugin that was contributed (you will need to look back in Git history to find it)?they managed to find a way to deal with creating a GPL stubb that creates a socket connection to their proprietary db backend if I recall correctly. Marco Hugentobler has often said in response to these kind of questions (and I agree) that the GPL creates a platform that encourages sharing in two directions and when you weigh up the license against others in those simple terms it still seems like a good choice even if in some edge cases it actually means we lose potentially interesting contributions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CDash
Message-ID: <55F69C5E.3050304@opengis.ch>

Hi developers,

For about a year we have continuous integration support with travis. I
turned out to be a great tool for quality control and has evolved into
an amazing state which I did not expect when I started the crowdfunding
campaign.

At the moment it is a standard procedure to check if a pull requests
passes the travis checks. And when the master branch goes red, the
developers head gets the same color.

One major reason that the builds turn red quite often is because the
test results cannot be submited to cdash. This is pretty annoying since
false positives cost time, decrease motivation and reduce the
credibility of travis. I do not know the exact reason for the
instability of the current hosting but there is a need to improve it.

Does anybody know the current hosters (otb) and is able to ask them if
they are aware of the problems and what would be required to improve
stability?
Alternatively we could also start hosting our own cdash. That means that
we need to maintain it.
We could also look into 3rd party hosting. I had a short look at
my.cdash.org but I assume that the upload quota of 100MB for the free
plan is too low for us (would need to verify though) and the paid ones
are only slightly higher.

Do you have more ideas or feedback on the above points?

It would be great to improve the significance of travis even further!

Matthias

There are quite a large number of tickets (mainly blocker and some
regressions) opened recently. Not sure how many of them are related to the
latest node tool changes, but as Nyall said, the current status of
digitising in master is far from ideal.

I am not sure that QGIS bug fixing program is the right way to go.

It wouldn't be fair that an unfinished paid work is pushed to master and
later on the group sponsors the end of the development.

I suggest to wait for Marco's answer regarding the schedule for fixing the
node tool.

I think that waiting again 2 weeks is a bit long as this tool is crucial in
QGIS. If he can't make it, then the solution of paid bug fixing by another
dev can be discussed, but that's a bit odd to me.

How about only send to CDash the failure cases ?

It's still handy to see the results from passing tests - eg, allowing
me to bump the acceptable doc coverage ;)

Good idea to improve the situation short-term!
I just committed it, let's see how it works.

In the longer run I still think it would be good to have the detailed
report for failing builds always available, so the questions remain.

Hi all,
I'm so glad of this spur of interest in the analytical capabilities of
QGIS! I often felt lonely, seeing that comparatively little resources
are invested in this important area. I frankly think we are understaffed
on this, and welcome any new effort to improve the current situation.
Please fill up tickets on all your requests, so nothing will be missed
(there are also other important functions to be reimplemented).
IMHO the main issue is to make Processing robust enough, with a
significant and sustained bugfixing effort. Replicating fTools menu is
not a huge issue IMHO, people will get used to it (just don't do it just
before an LTR, and we'll be fine).
All the best.

You could configure Travis to use 2 different "jobs" (using a matrix)
and accept failures from the "job" consisting in sending results to
CDash

Right, for the geometry checking plugins I've been using the C++ GEOS 
API, but I've wrapped the additional precision related functionality in 
a C API, see

https://github.com/manisandro/QGIS/blob/geometry_plugins/src/core/geosextra/geos_extra/geos_c_extra.cpp
https://github.com/manisandro/QGIS/blob/geometry_plugins/src/core/geosextra/geos_extra/geos_c_extra.h

Such an API was proposed upstream early this year [1], but the 
discussion stalled. So perhaps that discussion could be revived.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG fill broken?
Message-ID: <55F6F1A0.6040007@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I noticed that both in 2.10 and 2.8.3 the polygon SVG seems partly
broken, at least on 64 bit: the submenu shows a line instead of a
symbol. In 2.8, the fill is not shown, while in 2.10 it is.
Anyone confirmes?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Seems fine on my machine in all versions (2.8, 2.10 and master) - 64bit 
Ubuntu. Are you sure you don't have an odd setting, such as map units 
with strange values?

Hi all

Considering the discussion, I think it is best if I revert the 
click-click changes. Like that, there will be vertex editor with old 
click-drag behaviour. The remaining issues can then wait until after 26th.

Greetings from foss4g,

It's a bit of a pity.
We discussed the new functionnality of the node tool, and it was decided
to integrate at once the node editor and the advanced digitizing.

Only if it works though and doesn't make editing worse which is the current
case.  The large amount of regressions need to be fixed or else people are
going to get super annoyed at not being able to edit correctly and I can
tell you that is going to be a lot of people.  Reverting is good move
unless there is time to fix the bugs which doesn't seem to be the case.

Yes, I understand.
I'm just afraid to never get the advanced digitizing in the node tool as
originaly planned.
I totally agree that having the node tool broken for such a long time in
master was not really a good situation.

Hi Paolo,

It seems like there is no valid file path selected pointing to your SVG 
file. Below the symbol preview panel there is a line (just above the 
"effeti disegno" checkbox) that normally shows the file path pointing 
towards the selected SVG file. In your case it seems to be empty - but 
it shouldn't.

See my screenshot at http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/qgis_svg_fill.png

Can you try to select a file and see how it behaves?

Is this a project migrated from an older version?

Andreas

The SVG fill issue was raised >11 months ago here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11522

It only affects QGIS on 64-bit platform (all OSes).

Not sure if this is the same issue.

In Paolos case, the symbol path is really empty (no file path set). Even 
if you select a default symbol there should be something visible in the 
file path line input widget. So either the user never selected an SVG 
symbol (which would explain it), or there is a migration issue from an 
older QGIS version.

On the other issue (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11522):

I can confirm that the default fill of default symbols is white on a 
64bit Ubuntu Linux and recent master. Hopefully, this can be fixed. It 
is quite annoying - but not a major blocker in my opinion - as the user 
can still easily fix it by setting the color back to black.

Actually I just had a look at the symbols with the white fill and it 
seems that the actual symbols have the fill set to white:

As an example:
In file svg/accommodation/accommodation_caravan_park.svg Konsole 
outputsvg/accommodation/accommodation_caravan_park.svg

Konsole output
<path fill="param(fill) #FFF"stroke="param(outline) #000"

FFF means a white fill.

So it seems that the 64bit software is correct and the 32bit software 
would be broken if it still renders this as black (which I doubt it 
does), but the symbol definition is broken. That doesn't even require a 
developer to fix - any user can do that.

I don't know who changed all these default fills to white?

I'll just add this as a note to the bug description.

Andreas, shouldn't param(fill) mean that it'd be replaced by the default
value (which would be black, or at least is under 32-bit)?

Hi devs,

anybody visiting FOSS4G has time to write something on the 'official
blog' [0] or others about the role QGIS plays there at talks or coffee
tables?
Let me or Anita know if you need write access.

Yes - param(fill) means that this fill color is replacable. But it is 
followed by the default color. #FFF means 255,255,255 which is white.

So the 64bit version renders this correctly. If the 32bit version 
renders this as black it is wrong.

Someone must have changed all this fill colors to white in the past. We 
must change this back to black (#000)

If you change it to black, does it shows properly under 64 bit? Ie have you
tried modifying one to check the fix?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] focusInEvent combobox
Message-ID: <1442309261647-5224248.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello

I want to add an event to a combobox. In particular, when the focus change
to the combobox I want to show a QmessageBox. Shearching the web I find out
that I can do it reimplementing the focus event handler, but that means
change the python file generated by the pyuic4 tool. So each time I change
the ui file I have to add the reimplemented the event. There is another way
to solve this situation without changing the py file generated from ui file.

Thank you.

Hi,

I would like to build QGIS 2.10 ( branch release-2_10 ) under Ubuntu 14.04,
so I use the qgis official repository, and then

apt-get build-dep qgis

I get a error about missing grass-dev dependencies . Has anyone found a way
around ?

Thanks
Micha?l

but have you selected a SVG symbol in the list? Your screenshot does not 
show a selected symbol. Sorry to insist on that ;-)

The submenu "Line" is normal. It was always there in conjunction with 
SVG fills, so you can also set a stroke around the polygons. It has been 
like this for many versions. Nothing changed there for a while.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server : layer ordre from group
Message-ID: <55F8303A.9080309@gmail.com>

Hi devs and QGIS Server user,

I just fixed an issue in QGIS server and backport it to release-2_10 and 
release-2_8.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8948721991bf321fb7eb2da259790624183f619d
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/ae906b5eca9f99d7e4bd4e29e3b1bc4b49122be2
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/977d17751b9c05da1f09ed40d1cf27a97db5f534

If custom order is not enabled and a group is requested, layers was 
added in the DOM element order. The default rendering order is the 
reverse. To fix this issue, QgsWMSProjectParser::addLayersFromGroup has 
to read group element children from end (bottom) to start (top).

If you use QGIS server, I invite you to update your build.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Hi Ren?-Luc,

Thank you for the patch and the notice - do you know since when this bug 
was present. Probably since ages?

This change will basically mean that all QGIS Web Client users will have 
to patch their client at the same time they upgrade their server.

I am not against this change - I am just thinking about the 
consequences. I think we reversed rendering order on the client. If we 
don't communicate this properly - a lot of QGIS server/client users will 
run into this issue and will complain.

Hi Andreas and devs,

My fixe does not affect the layer order fixed by the WMS LAYERS parameters.

For exemple QGIS Web Client manage the layer order by building the WMS 
LAYERS parameters with all the layers and without groups. QGSI Web 
Client is not concerned by this fixe.

In Lizmap, user can specify Group as layer, which means that the group 
name is used in the WMS LAYERS parameter. We used it to reduce the 
number of names in the WMS LAYERS parameter, to have 3 rendering based 
on  scale in one web client layer, to have based layer, etc. It is not a 
so old issue, probably introduce with the new layer tree.

I just fix it because the rendering was not in the same order as in the 
Desktop QGIS.

Hi Ren?-Luc,

Thank you for your reply!

Will it change the order in the output of GetCapabilities and 
GetProjectSettings responses?

You are right that we are sending leaf layers, no groups, in QGIS web 
client.

Anyway - I will test and see if I'll need to change QGIS Web Client or not.

I don't know if I well understood, but can be simply adding a listener
without changing the uic

e.g.
<your GUI instance>.<your combobox
objectName>.focusInEvent.connect(<your QmessageBox function handler>)

ho! sorry

because it's a protected method, you should create a derivated class
from QComboBox where overload your method, then add your "custom"
class in Qt Creator project promoting your QComboBox to your custom
class (where the include is "your_custom_class_module")... more
details here: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/designer-using-custom-widgets.html

the promoted class will be imported in the uic at the end of the file.

Hi all,

I?m planing to use some features of the Qgis in my python script.
i am using the function QgsVectorLayer.loadSldStyle that returns true but
the result of the QgsVectorLayer.rendererV2 not works when i am using the
script outside of the QGIs. How can i solve this?
I already have tried adding the following calls to my script:

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("qgis_path", True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()
app = QgsApplication([], True)

Thanks u all.

Sorry, i figured it out, i was using the calls in the wrong order, the
correct sequence is the following:

app = QgsApplication([], True)
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(qgishome, True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()

checked again, it works here on Debian. I noticed the issue on Win

I'll report in case of any issue.

ok, thanks for clarifying.

It appears in OpenLayers, too. I had to reverse the order of layer in
the QGIS project file in order to make it work...

Hi all

Ren?-Luc has found why this appeared, essentially with Lizmap. Lizmap send
GetMap request to QGIS Server with a non empty STYLES parameter (ex:
STYLES=default). This is to let the user choose the style.

In this case, QGIS Server did not use the maplayer cache, so it had to get
all information from the provider to build the maplayer objet for each
GETMAP request ! This is why in this case, a new opening was made on the
file.
The following commit fixes it :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/a5450a78ffcbba9a75afa8be43460ad741fea050

It has been backported in branches release-2_8 and release-2_10

A very good side effect is with PostGIS layers :
* before, QGIS Server sent many many queries to build the whole maplayer
for each GetMAP, such as : [1] if metadata were available, and worse like
[2] if metadata were not (for example for PostGIS views or if the user had
disabled "use metadata" )
* now only the main "get data" queries are sent for each GetMap, like [3]

In [2], you can see some performance kiling queries (on big datasets), such
as

SELECT count(distinct ""nb"")=count(""nb"") FROM (SELECT row_number()
OVER() AS nb, * FROM ""2013"".v_geo_parcelle
) AS ""subQuery_0"""

SELECT st_extent(""geom"") FROM (SELECT row_number() OVER() AS nb, * FROM
""2013"".v_geo_parcelle
) AS ""subQuery_0""

Thanks a lot to Ren?-Luc for fixing this !

Cheers

Thanks Ren?-Luc and Kimaidou,

This sounds like a useful fix. I will test and report if I run into issues.

Do you have any numbers/observations how much this will speed up 
services that use Postgis as storage? I mean very rough numbers only.

Anyway - I will test.

Hi !

Paolo : the bug has been backported in branches "release-2_8" and
"release-2_10", so it would be included in 2.8.4 whenever it is released.

Andreas : This fix is only relevant for WMS clients using a non empty
STYLES parameter in GetMap. In this cases, this would greatly improve the
speed if :

* the WMS client do use a non empty STYLES parameter. If not, QGIS Server
already used the cached layer.
* the WMS client sends a lot of GetMap queries, for example if you have
many users or if you use tiles.
* the underlying data are big or complex, because the queries "SELECT
extent()" and "SELECT count(id)=count(DISTINCT id) will not be sent, and
theses queries can be slow.

In Lizmap client for example, we use STYLES with 'default' for each layer,
and we usually have map built with tiles. So it will be significant here.

Cheers,
Micha?l

Hey Steven,

Thanks.  I will take a look at any issues before the release.  The best way
to get these addressed is to open tickets on hub.qgis.org and assign them
to me.

Hi again,

Could please someone of the core devs have a look at # 11901.

According to the bug report, it appeared and disappeared although I did not make any changes to the plugin code. Actually, the plugin worked nicely for almost a year or so before the bug was reported the first time.

Furthermore, the issue seems to pop-up also with other plugins, according to bug reporter.

I am open for the possibility that the issue is due to this particular plugin, but then I would need help to identify what actually the reason is and where to start fixing it... Possibly GDAL related, as this was reported for Mac (which I have not available...).

Kind regards,
Stefan

IMHO using only GitHub is the simplest option, and it works well enough.
Of course, I do not like it being proprietary software, but since QGIS code is already there, I think we can't complain.

Yes, I think that's the correct approach.

Thanks for the report.

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wkJDBdUQdcAu-4s7n40dzGbfyRejMXZJNXhV5AbGe1aQ@mail.gmail.com>

OL3 has changed the way GetFeatureInfo request parameters are generated.
The nre way uses fixed WIDTH/HEIGHT and X/Y (I/J) params: 101 for the first
and 50 latters. Then it builds the BBOX parameter consequently.

The old way they were built from the size and extent of the map, and the
query coordinate.

The new style makes QGIS Server respond with empty results if the click is
not exactly on the feature coordinates.
I've tested the same request on the same layer served by Geoserver, which
responds even with not so precise clicks.

Can this be caused by coordinates rounding happening inside QGIS Server?

Agreed, it's bothering many users.
Thanks for pointing it out.

Hi Giovanni

QGIS Server uses a fixed percentage (1 or 2%) of the image size as a default 
tolerance for GetFeatureInfo requests. This works nicely with a full sized 
image e.g. in the QGIS WebClient. But with the smaller image size in the OL3 
GetFeatureInfo request this results in a single pixel tolerance which requires 
pixel perfect clicks.

There are new parameters in QGIS Server to set the tolerance in GetFeatureInfo 
requests (should be available from QGIS 2.10):

	FI_POINT_TOLERANCE
	FI_LINE_TOLERANCE
	FI_POLYGON_TOLERANCE

The tolerances can be set in pixels per geometry type.

If you add these parameters to your OL3 getGetFeatureInfoUrl() calls, the 
feature info requests should respond to less precise clicks.

Cheers
Mathias

	qgis server tiles
Message-ID: <1442497030895-5224645.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
working on qgisserver install here with tiled client (Lizmap), we
encountered that empty tiles are rendered with borders inheriting from
shapeburstfill. 
See picture [0] 

That is fine in desktop QGIS mapcanvas unless we put an oversized "shade to
distance" value. 
See [1] 

Any idea if there could be a workaround to avoid that with inverted polygon
renderer tiles? I guess Nyall knows that  ;-)

Thanks Mathias!
I will investigate it. Maybe an heuristic for the tolerance could be used
on the base of the BBOX coordinates...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS server/desktop segfaults
Message-ID: <55FADC42.50900@carto.net>

Hi,

Currently, with current master, QGIS server always crashes on my test 
machine (Ubuntu 64bit). Any idea how I can investigate it?

The same version on QGIS desktop always crashes on exit. Maybe it is the 
same issue?

Here is the output from the crash on exit in QGIS desktop:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Starting Plugin Development for importing data
	from BigSense
Message-ID: <55FB2F41.2000002@battlepenguin.com>

Hey there,

I'm the lead developer of BigSense and I really want to write a plugin
for qgis to import data from a BigSense server. I've got qgis running
with some basic shapes for the maps of the areas I'm studying. I've been
looking through a lot of the plugin documentation and I'm not entirely
sure where to start.

Basically, BigSense queries look like the following:

http://example.org/Query/DateRange/20150812/20150813.csv?SensorType=Temperature

and return data that looks like the following:

PackageID,TimeStamp,TimeZone,RelayID,SensorID,SensorType,Units,Data,Longitude,Latitude,Altitude,Speed,Climb,Track,LongitudeError,LatitudeError,AltitudeError,SpeedError,ClimbError,TrackError
261,2015-08-12

Each record contains data from a Relay and a Sensor (a relay can have
multiple sensors. We de-normalize the data, so the output is flattened.
Each package_id only has one time and one GPS data set, but multiple
sensors with their own data and units). Default timezone is always UTC.

I want to make a plugin that can import a dataset into qgis. Basically
it would be a dialog with a field for the BigSense web service end
point, a date/time range (Query/TimestampRange is supported for UNIX
timestamps) and drop downs with constraints. I don't care about keeping
track of what's imported or importing data twice. That's all going to be
in the hands of the user.

Looking at the documentation, I'm assuming what I need to do is start
with "Writing Vector Layers" and create a new layer, add a feature for
each reading, set the Geometry of that reading to a Point from my GPS
(I'm ignoring all readings without GPS data and I'm ignoring all the
_error fields for now too), and set and Attribute for the actual data
("temperature" - > 15.6C) and then add that feature to the writer?

Is that correct? Am I on the right track? Are there any examples of data
imports up on github or in the documentation that I've missed that fit
this use-case?

Thanks.

Hi all.
Processing on QGIS 2.10 is not finding my installed grass7, on Debian
sid. I kind of recall there was a problem, with a simple fix by Victor:
do we need to release an updated Processing package?
Or is this a local issue? Checked on Windows, and it works.
Thanks.

I'm referring to this:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2015-August/038772.html
If I inderstand it correctly, a commit and a new package is much needed.
Thanks.

I confirm once more that the simple fix in:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/2a14ffd281d0a0e99a0a899622a29ca0efdb0852
works. Could please someone release a new Processing package?
It's pretty important, as GRASS is broken without it.
Thanks.

I was already wondering why nothing happened for such a long time.  
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13072 is closed.
My GRASS (on QGIS 2.8.3) was only working cause I fiddled around for hours  
and then downloaded processing 2.9.3 manually and refused to update it to  
2.10.1. Since then, no new processing plugin was shipped.
I wonder how many people have no GRASS support for months now, don't they  
dare or are there only so few Linux users who try to use LTR but always  
compile latest versions?

Cheers
Bernd

Hi

This is indeed annoying. I'm using GRASS 7 directly as a result.

As Paolo mentioned recently, Processing doesn't seem to be extremely
popular amongst QGIS users and it is understaffed at the moment.

Cheers

Hi Paolo (and others),

as you can see here:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing/

Current packager is Alexander (in cc). First thing is to ask him to
package a new version.

If he is too busy, just let the dev list know, because I think every
experience plugin-dev can get this packaged (maybe with a little help of
Victor or Alexander...)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

this is what I'm doing ;)

yes, little bit more than zipping code from master and uploading it.
I think Victor can do it, or I can as well, with a little help.
Thanks.

Strange. Processing is my work horse from the moment on it was published,  
and I will never want to miss it again. I wonder how and what other users  
do, when not using processing? This is an outstanding innovation, but  
obviously too much hidden (simplified interface, duplications with vector  
and raster menu), so ppl have no idea what it is good for?

Using the GRASS GUI is only sth for people with no tendencies to nervous  
breakdowns ;)

Agreed. The main point here is very few people invest in it, so
stabilization and innovation is slower than we would like.

Hi,

Am I the only one who gets crashes on exit with QGIS current master?

These crashes happen on Ubuntu Linux 64bit, but also on Win7 64bit 
(although the windows version is a bit older (3 days old)). But Linux is 
up-to-date.

What can I do?

Hi,

Problem solved. Turned out that a plugin was causing the crash on exit.

Now I still have to find out why QGIS server is currently crashing on my 
system.

Thanks,

It is not a plugin from the public plugin repository, but a plugin 
developed by ourself from the waste-water project ;-) apparently it was 
a known-problem - but I did not know.

oh, I see, thanks. I'm asking because it happens with several plugins,
and I believe we should make something to make QGIS more robust, and
intercept these errors before crashing.
If your plugin crashes QGIS systematically, it could be a good test case.
All the best, and thanks.

Thinking on all that?s said here?



The idea that the proprietary link must be optional to ensure compliance with GPL seems to me a difficult one to apply at the granularity of plugins, because if the aim is to provide multiple different ways of doing something, the natural way to implement this is via multiple different plugins.  The overall effect then is that the proprietary link is optional in QGIS overall but not within that plugin.



Anyway I noticed there is an existing case study here in the Oracle Spatial Georaster plugin https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_oracle_raster.html



Is this sort of thing generally considered ok, and on what grounds?



Best regards



Crispin

Hi Vincent, thank you for your reply.

The QGIS plugin would not be essential to the external process as sDNA works on its own anyway.  The external process would however be essential to the QGIS plugin.

Is there any sort of official position on this, e.g. from the steering committee?

Hi,
I do not think we have an official position: we stick to the GPL
licence. I admit that the interpretation may be sometimes tricky, but in
these case it's only a lawyer (or better a judge) that can give a
definite answer.
In general I thin Vincent has outlined the prevailing interpretation.

Yes the linking and licensing restrictions of GPL comes up many time but can be solved in edge cases - you might want to look at the (now defunct) SQLAnywhere plugin that was contributed (you will need to look back in Git history to find it)?they managed to find a way to deal with creating a GPL stubb that creates a socket connection to their proprietary db backend if I recall correctly. Marco Hugentobler has often said in response to these kind of questions (and I agree) that the GPL creates a platform that encourages sharing in two directions and when you weigh up the license against others in those simple terms it still seems like a good choice even if in some edge cases it actually means we lose potentially interesting contributions.

Regards

Tim



All the best.

Hi all,

These crashes can have different reasons (e.g. for the plugin at
Andreas' place it's becuase of a custom expression function which seems
to get double deleted). Some of these can probably be prevented by
changes in QGIS core, some will require changes in the plugin.

The best method I can think of is to reproduce the problems on a
computer where QGIS is running in debug mode (or at least capable of
producing a stacktrace) and decide case-by-case.
For the minidump - which would theoretically also include a stacktrace -
I am not sure if anybody is actually capable of analyzing it.

I'm sorry to tell you that I doubt that there's an easy way to deal with
it. Or a generic approach to "catch" this and prevent QGIS from crashing.

Just my 2c, if anybody has an idea to fix it once and for all, please
speak up :-)

Matthias

Message-ID: <55FC1BBC.2090505@carto.net>

Hi,

I am still trying to find out why QGIS server crashes on one of my 
machines (master version).

If I run qgis_mapserv.fcgi on the command line I get the following output:

-------------------
Konsole output
an at laotop:~/cgi$ ./qgis_mapserv.fcgi

<ServiceException code="Service configuration error">Service unknown or

</ServiceExceptionReport>
------------------

Could it be that my ECW/JP2 warning are causing the crash (500 http 
error code)? Is this the problem?

--------------

On another matter:
QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE / _LEVEL never worked for me. I specified the 
following in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/fcgid.conf:


Konsole output
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE "/var/log/apache2/qgis_server.log"
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL 0

I created the file /var/log/apache2/qgis_server.log and made sure it is 
writable by everyone - however, it always stays empty. Is level 0 the 
most verbose code? Why is it not working?

Thanks for any ideas,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

ECW is not causing crash.

You can add QGIS log to have more logs

  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_LOG_FILE "/var/log/apache2/qgis.log"
  FcgidInitialEnv QGIS_LOG_LEVEL 0

Hello Andreas,

to convince QGIS server to log is black magic... if you are working from
the command line, you should set the env vars by exporting them or directly
in the command, this works for me from the cmd line:


QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL=0 QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE=/tmp/qgis-000.log
./qgis_mapserv.fcgi

The ECW/JP2 are probably unrelated to your crash.

FYI Sourcepole did some QGIS related presentations and put their slides
online:

http://blog.sourcepole.ch/2015/09/18/presentations-at-foss4g-2015-in-seoul/

Thanks Marco, Pirmin and all for representing 'us' there!

By the way, is anybody aware of some video recordings?

Hi all,

I found this same problem.

pyuic4 on osgeo4w environment doesn't fix this. Still the compiled py file
tries to import QgsFieldComboBox from qgsfieldcombobox.

Is this an error in osgeo4w environment? Possibly some paths are missing
from PYTHONPATH or PATH?
At least qgis package and its gui module couldn't be found by python of
osgeo4w.

I tried to create a qgis.bat to %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\etc\ini with the following
commands:
  set PYTHONPATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\python
  PATH %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH%
After that qgis.gui is imported fine in python but still pyuic4 can't
find QgsFieldComboBox
from correct location.

The actual problem might be that
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins\qgis_customwidgets.py
file is not found by pyuic4.
After I copied that file
to C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins
everything works ok.


Is this a osgeo4w bug or could this be fixed by us?
Should the qgis postinstall bat copy qgis_customwidgets.py file to the
right place?



Thanks,

Lauri

No, qgis-dev might not be the only installed version - so you have to setup the
PYTHONPATH to use the version you target.

Hi J?rgen!

I think that this can't be fixed by just setting the PYTHONPATH.

If I have understood right the problem is that PyQt and its uic module
can't find qgis_customwidgets.py or better said
'qgis-dev\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins' directory because it is not told
to do so. It is not that some module can't be imported because it is not in
pythonpath. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Directories that are searched for widget plugins by PyQt4 are defined in
uic.widgetPluginPath. I have not found any environment variable where this
list can be altered.
After I appended
"C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins" to the
widgetPluginPath list I'm able to use uic.loadUiType function inside
python. Still that doesn't solve the problem with pyuic4 because
widgetPluginPath can't be set externally.

I imagine that the fix would be in the QT Creator ui project setting
correctly the include for the promoted widgets (the widget promoted to
a QgsFieldComboBox)... so the error should be in the
cartogram_dialog_base.ui project

let us know

Hi,

?I'd like to draw some attention to a really nasty OGR issue/regression
which makes it impossible to use OGR algos in models:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13174

In general, this is kind of a follow upon of the thread "GRASS missing from
Processing?" where Paolo summarized:

?I assume most of the paid development is currently not aimed towards
geoprocessing. Paying users so far seem quite focused on cartographic
abilities and data management but much less on spatial analysis.

?What would it take to get a Processing testing framework up and running as
discussed in https://hub.qgis.org/issues/5807?

There's been success with crowd-funding initiatives in the past. Is there
any dev who would want to focus on this?

Best wishes,

Hi,

There has been some work going on to support HiDPI displays as discussed on

is this really necessary? Of course I can change the permission, but
still it sems weird.
All the best.

Hi Anita,

I've a 4k display and I've committed some small hidpi fixes in the past
months ( see:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr++hidpi+ ),
unfortunately I'm very busy until mid november and I've no time to work on
that issues now, buy I'm definitely interested in doing it.

What I suggest to do is to file separate [hidpi] tickets for the individual
items.

The plugin manager is based on qtwebview and should support zoom out of the
box (*setZoomFactor <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwebview.html#zoomFactor-prop>*
).


Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] is cache for network working in proxied environment
Message-ID: <55FFB050.2050003@duif.net>

Hi devs,

I am using a lot of wms services as we have nice reference maps online.
Those services are normally working great, except when I work in an
environment where there is a network proxy running: I have to put the
right parameters in Qgis Network settings to let QGIS find plugins etc
etc...

Question: the WMS/WMTS services there are awfully slow. And I was
wondering if this can have something to do with the firewall (does maybe
not honor parallel requests??) ...
OR that the cache mechanism is maybe not working because of the proxy...

I had a look in the cache directory and see files with a '.cache'
-extention. Looking into the files these are binary files, but I see
http-headers in it...

Anyway. Do people working in a proxied env have the same experience?
Or can they confirm 'it just works'...

Can the dev's who are familiar with the caching system confirm that it
should work in a proxied (squid) environment?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

Despite the lack of financial investment QGIS-Processing is, in my opinion,
the best tool for GIS analysis in the market (including paid software).
However there are a few problems (like the one mentioned above) that can
discourage new users and ruin user experience.

I think some paid development time would certainly help QGIS- processing a
lot. For instance QGIS-Processing multi-threaded support seems to be
finished or close but still hasn't been merged into master (I assume
because no developer had the time to review it).

If the sponsors are not interested in financing Processing, then
crowdfunding would be a nice alternative. I would certainly be willing to
contribute.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-Server] Add a Short Name to layers for OGC
	Web Services
Message-ID: <55FFC8A2.50708@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,
Hi Marco,

With some QGIS-Server user feedbacks, we think that it will be usefull 
to add an OGC Web Service (WMS, WFS, WCS) Name to metadata layers.

We think that we need to add an input to specify a OGC Web Service Name 
because a lot of users use QgsMapLayer.name() as a title. 
QgsMapLayer.name() is used by user as a title because it's the label in 
the QGIS legend and in the composer legend.

An other point is that currently if the user activates 'Use layer id as 
name' in the Project Properties and does not set the title in the layer 
metadata, the QgsMapLayer.name() will be used as the OGC Web Service Title.

In the WMS implementation specification, The Name is a text string used 
for machine-to-machine communication while the Title is for the benefit 
of humans. For example, a dataset might have the descriptive Title 
?Maximum Atmospheric Temperature? and be requested using the abbreviated 
Name ?ATMAX?.
In the WFS, the Name has to be a valid XML Tag name and Tag names cannot 
contain any of the characters |!"#$%&'()*+,/;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~|, nor a 
space character, and cannot start with |-|, |.|, or a numeric digit.
The QgsMapLayer.id() can be a valid OGC Web Service, but it is too long 
and it's not an abbbreviated Name.

I propose to add a Short Name in the layer metadata which will:
* be stored as a WMSName element
* accessible through QgsMapLayer.shortName()
* be used as OGC Web Service Name if it has been set and 'Use layer id 
as name' has not been checked

Remarks are wellcome.

Fixed in fae0654.

The underlying problem is more serious, some GRASS data are accessed
through GRASS modules and GRASS modules can only be run in a mapset
owned by current user so that is is not possible to get data from a
location where the user does not own any mapset. I'll ask in GRASS
list.

Message-ID: <CAB28Asg=4vcSetfQCK5xzdZGOkLYcSAtg_oPLYG39HhTkYpU0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi J?rgen,

I'm hesitantly asking what your thoughts are on extending the freeze
for 2.12 by a couple of days? I'm aware of a few large pieces of
valuable work which are in progress and hoping to land in 2.12, and
we've also got a few large PRs waiting/about to be submitted which
will take considerable time to review.

For myself I'd love a couple of extra days to add a few extra things
to expression contexts. Specifically, adding a "@original_value"
variable so that the original symbol/label value is available in
expressions. Eg, a data defined expression
"set_color_part(@original_value,'alpha',"population"/100)". Bam - easy
value-by-alpha maps. Or stuff like "case when "population" > 10000
then @original_value + 4 else @original_value end" .

Any chance of this? Totally understand if you'd prefer not.

Hi!

I have an MS SQL database (not spatial) from which I would like to fetch and update data from my python plugin.

My question is:
Is it possible with a "normal" QGIS installation to connect to an MS SQL database from python, so I'll be able to execute various SELECT and UPDATE statements?

I haven't begun any development, I'm just trying to establish if this is possible and whether it is straight forward.

Hi J?rgen,

I would also like to request the feature freeze be extended a bit (possibly
one week?). I am finally done with a new authentication system that
includes support for authentication plugins. I am submitting it's PR today
and updating the associated QEP. It would be good to have a bit more time
to review it and give the PSC time to vote on the QEP.

Message-ID: <CANxjxarsWCv3S_ZKMhsS+b0rKzJEfm6VTxz_HyoYuBKE7Z2_yQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am experiencing a crash that systematically happens on each machine
I tested, both Windows and Linux, for such reason I am excluding a
local issue.

Before I file a ticket though, I would like to know if anyone can
reproduce the issue. The steps are:

* open the attribute table
* create a virtual field with expression = "other field"
* open delete column dialog (from the toolbar of attribute table)
* the only selectable column is the new virtual field, select it
* ok on dialog
* crash

Thanks for any feedback!

Best Regards,

Hi,

I'd prefer if bigger features go in early in the development cycle instead of
just in time for the feature freeze (or even requiring to postpone it).

That's one reason why we have short release cycles - if you miss one slot the
next one is close...

Fair enough. It's not like we don't all have months of warning to plan
around this ;)

Hi all, 
+1 with that.
 I also would like that we start clarifying Metadatas concepts currently
present in QGIS. 
We have some OWS metadata on project level, but no ISO (19xxx) there. At
layer's level, we have amix of OWS and ISO metadatas, with confusion on
those concepts. 

Title is a very good example of this, since Title in WFS needs to respect
formatting rules, when ISO metadata titles are more dedicated for human
beings ;-)
Since some of us want to be able to generate ISO metadatas AND server WxS
services form QGIS, I think we should start some global approach in that
area. 

I raised that issue yesterday in metadata QEP from Tom here [0] 
[0] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/20 

Any opinion on that?
Cheers
R?gis

Hi,

Is there any Makefile expert here that can teach me how can I change my
Plugin Makefile to include some new sub-folders (made by me for code
convinience).

The plugin was based on the Plugin builder, and the Makefile is the
original one provided by the plugin builder, with added files. Yet, when I
run make, the sub-folders are not created and files are copied to the
plugin root.

You can see the makefile is here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/3nem7trrdk8y42s/Makefile?dl=0

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-Server] Relative paths and QGIS-Server
Message-ID: <56000114.1070807@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,
Hi Marco,

I encounter some troubles with relative paths and QGIS-Server. For 
example, SVGMarker path and NETCDF datasource are not resolved in QGIS 
Server unlike in QGIS Desktop.

To resolve relative path for SVGMarker, the class QgsSombolLayerV2Utils 
is used and it based on QgsProject::instance()->fileName().
To resolve relative path for NETCDF datasource and other GDAL 
datasources, the class QgsMapLayer is used and it based on 
QgsProject::instance()->readPath( filename ).

QGIS Server uses the QgsServerProjectParser to convert relative path to 
absolute path. This mean that it parses the project and update paths.

To fixe this issue, we have 2 solutions :
* Set the QgsProject instance FileName in the QgsServerProjectParser
* Update QgsServerProjectParser::createLayerFromElement to resolve and 
update SVGMarker path and GDAL datasources

Marco, I'dlike to have your point of view to fix it.

Regards,

Hi Anita,

I'm not sure: I cannot work on that at the moment and probably I'm not so
much expert about the GUI for most of those issue, but feel free to assign
them to me if nobody can handle them, hidpi enhancements are on my TODO
list.

Hi Paolo,

is there a list of tickets for INSPIRE compliance?

If yes, can you please make sure that INSPIRE appears in the subject?

I do not think so. I believe the interested parties should team up and
coordinate the work, which is multi faceted.

Hi R?gis,

Thanks for your reply.

I would like to resrtict the discussion on name, short name and title. 
and the way users use layer name.

For every QGIS Desktop user, the layer name is a human beings. They used 
space and accent because is the way to authenticate a layer in a legend.

Now, if a user want to publish his project to the Web with QGIS Server, 
he probably doesn't want to update layer name and add a layer title for

So to make QGIS and QGIS server more friendly for publishing OGC Web 
Services, I think a Short Name for layers can be useful.

The usual way would be to run apps/qgis/crssync.exe (foldernames on 
Windows). But I assume it looks only into the GDAL files, not PROJ.4.

It should not be a great problem, because GDAL 1.11.3 is just around the 
corner.

Agreed. The first issue is to find a developer interested in doing this,
and opening the crowdfunding.
I understand most Processing gurus are superbusy nowadays.
Any taker?
All the best.

?Thank you for your input Filipe!

?Crowdfunding initiatives so far? were initiated by a dev who was
interested to advance a certain feature. It would be great if somebody
would step forward for Processing because I also think that chances for a
successful funding campaign are quite good.

Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OGRDataSource life cycle
Message-ID: <CAGhxFKWUKUUi48NhQCE1-BMscV7WNcT_LJ2iaMf2kve5RsLnkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello QGIS gurus!

I am developing a gdal driver for AmigoCloud (www.amigocloud.com)
datasource. This is a REST API to AmigoCloud backend. It?s somewhat close
to CartoDB gdal driver. I have a question about life cycle of the OGRDriver
and OGRDatasource. It seems that every time I pan/zoom map in QGIS it
creates a new instance of OGRDriver/OGRDatasource, Open() it, does it thing
and destructs it. All this process makes it slow. How do I deal with it?
I?d like to keep something in RAM, perhaps cache, is it possible?

I am seeing the destructor of an OGR datasource being constantly called
after each draw. Is there a way to change that behavior? Seems kind of
expensive.

Thanks,
*Victor Chernetsky*

Hi all,


The path that must be specified as PYTHONPATH is
QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/share/qgis/python

All the custom widgets have their classes in qgis gui. Therefore, you
just need to add the QGIS python path to PYTHONPATH to be able to define
properly their import.

As J?rgen said there might be several versions of QGIS installed (i.e.
different versions of the custom widgets library), hence the PYTHONPATH
can't be set automatically.

To answer my own question: there have been some changes in global proxy
config, and now I do not even have to put in the proxy+port anymore but
can use 'defaultProxy' instead.

So yes it just works now (with me....)

Hi Ren? Luc, 
fair enough, let's focus on Short name first. Could you provide some screen
mockups so that we can all understand how GUI would be changed, and how WFS
name write rules can be checked in QGIS GUI? 
We also get rid of the "diplay as" field that is currently unusefull (unless
I'm wrong).

IMHO,having clearer labels and tooltips clarifying which field is used in
WFS service and which wyntax is authorized in it would be a very good first
step. 

Some content validation regexp magic could be nice too. 

Cheers
R?gis

Hi Salvatore

Following the steps in Pedro's ticket does *not* crash for me. However, I'll
ask some questions to clarify:

1. I did not select "Virtual field", as that was not mentioned in the ticket

2. I only gave a static value for the contents o the field, rather than an
expression - does this only happen with more complex expressions?

3. I did not close the attribute table between creating the new field and
deleting it

Does anyone else *not* get a crash following the steps in
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13366?

Thanks

Tom

The EPSG database hasn't been updated in this maintenance release. You need 
GDAL 2.0 for EPSG:6707

Subject: [Qgis-developer] snapping and topology checker
Message-ID: <20150922105106.15064eb6@karibik.Speedport_W_724V_Typ_A_05011602_00_001>

Hi all,

1. I've had some inconsistent problems with the topology checker
lately (linux, QGIS 2.10.1). I've tested a line-layer with the dangles
option. This layer had been created time ago with arcgis
two-point-line-tool. It showed me a lot of errors/dangles even on
straight lines, where the nodes seemed to be connected. They were not.
So I've tried to repair those by grabbing and moving the nodes on to
each other in snapping mode and checked them again.

My problem: Sometimes it works and the dangles are gone. Sometimes it
doesnt. Anyone else encountered similar behaviour?

2. I'd like to copy closed line-objects from my line-layer
and paste them in a polygon-layer. It's no problem, when the object is
created in one go. But when the line-object isnt closed yet, I don't
know how to do it. I've tried to close it by editing with snapping mode
and then even to dissolve it before copy+paste. But the objects are
always recognized as multiple line-objects, so when pasting in the
polygon-layer it becomes 2 Polygons closed at their repective start- and
end-node.
What do I have to do here?


Thanks
Marc

Hi, I must have missed something. How do you modify that field? It is greyed

Thanks for the clarification. Any idea whether this will land in Debian
and Windws in time for the 2.12 release?
All the best.

Many apologies - you are right. I change "Layer name", and couldn't
understand what Display as was meant to be: a non-editable text field which
mirrors Layer name? Why?

The GDAL transitions in Debian are quite involved, so it's not going to 
happen soon after the release.

I've discussed the plans for GDAL 1.11.3/2.0.1 in Debian on the Debian 
GIS list, see:

https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis/2015/08/msg00121.html
https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis/2015/09/msg00104.html

I have to divide my time over many packages, so I can't fully dedicate 
it to preparing the next GDAL transition (to 1.11.3 or 2.0.1 if the 
reverse dependencies all work with GDAL 2.0). merkaartor was one of the 
packages known not to support GDAL 2.0 and its development has been dead 
upstream for quite some time, fortunately Ladislav L?ska has picked up 
merkaartor development again, so we'll soon have an updated merkaartor 
package in Debian unstable that does support GDAL 2.0. Other GDAL 2.0 
incompatibilities are still expected in the other reverse dependencies, 
so chances are good we'll migrate to GDAL 1.11.3 in Debian before 
switching to GDAL 2.0.

Kind Regards,

Bas

thanks. is merkaartor a good reason to hold a very important package
like gdal? wouldn't it be better to drop it until ready?

With the terrible state the josm package is in since the upstream 
developers switched to JCS and the problems experienced trying to 
package it, having an alternative OSM editor available is very valuable.

Is QGIS important enough to hold back GRASS or osgEarth releases? The 
answer depends on which user you ask.

If you want speeder updates in Debian, additional contributors are 
required to share the work load. Or employ me to dedicate my time at 
$DAYJOB to packaging too. Neither of which is likely to happen, so we 
have to make do with limited resources (time mostly) we've got.

Kind Regards,

Bas

No.  If you don't update the package there will be no need to update QGIS
(because "no one" is going to build the above packages just to see if QGIS
works with them).  If a nightly fails, QGIS will likely be fix soon afterwards.

> so we have to make do with limited resources (time mostly) we've got.

As always.   Thanks and keep up the good work.

yes it occurs with any value, not needed a complex expression.

correct, you have to keep attribute dialog open

Actually there are two different issue apparently,  the first one
(Pedro's issue) happens with native field, but it was already fixed
[0],
the second one (mine) happens when creating a virtual field by field
calculator and then deleting it.

Maybe should I file a new ticket for it?

Thanks for your feedback.

Message-ID: <CAAE2-cmWoNn7=p-RBmxX4gAs2uhDF3-_Kp4skDY2d9m=0PeCzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I wonder if someone in this community/forum can explain me what I am going
to describe.

1 - I have an "ecw" raster file with a CRS already defines as "EPSG 102091"
(Monte_Mario_Italy_1). I have create a polygon (I have set the parameter
CRS as "EPSG 102091" too) and I use it as a mask to clip a portion of the
raster through "GDAL Clip raster by mask layer". Then I saved this portion
of the raster as a new file. When I open the clipped raster, the CRS is not
"EPSG 102091" anymore but "EPSG 3003" that, of course, is always a Monte
Mario (exactly "Monte Mario / Italy zone 1") but I wonder why is not "EPSG
102091" also in the portion I have clipped. What disturd me is also that
these two RS are not exactly the same, as also stated here:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/102541/any-difference-between-epsg3003-and-epsg102091

Anyone can explain me why that happens?

2 - Maybe here is not the place for this question, but I try... I have
converted the previous portion in EPSG 3003 into a common WGS84 ("EPSG
4326") through GDAL Warp (reproject) and, looking at the new raster, it
seems that the tool performs the operation properly. Sorry, this portion is
located in the middle of Sardinia. Then I create a kmz file through "Create
Garmin cusrom map from map canvas" tool, I imported this file (in the
proper file extension and with the proper CRS, wgs84) in the Garmin
BaseCamp but my area is not where it should supposed to be, Sardinia, but
is between Albacete and Madrid, in Spain (yes, BaseCamp view is set in
wgs84), any idea?

Thanks in advance,

Filippo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New authentication system ready
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9fn-BsMUO+voNM4-8MLf9VQM4r6ytEcDOTZsUVM+E_OQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The authentication system I have been working on for about a year is now
available for testing [PR 2330, QEP 14]. Would like to get people's
opinions on whether I can push this to master for upcoming release (and
maybe a vote on the QEP). Most of the code is bolt-on extra classes or
spliced-in GUI widgets, with very little actual core integration (see
second commit of PR).

Here's what is included:

* Master-password-encrypted authentication configurations stored in an
SQLite database
* Authentication method plugin architecture (like data providers)
* Basic auth method plugin
* Basic plugin integrated with PostGIS and OWS provider connections
* Inline with current username/password setup (still fully functional)
* SSL server connection configurations (save exceptions or custom configs
for SSL connection errors)

Check out the "6. Further Improvements" section of the rendered QEP.


PKI authentication related (why I was originally tasked to build the
system):

* Import extra Certificate Authorities, intermediate cert issuers and
personal identity bundles
* Manage certificate components like in Firefox
* Authentication method plugins for PEM and PKCS#12 bundles on disk, and
for stored personal identities
* Integrated with OWS provider connections (PostGIS and other databases
will take a bit more work)

Check out the example docs on PKI for a quick introduction to the whole
authentication system.


PR #2330:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2330

QEP #14:
https://github.com/dakcarto/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/auth-system/qep-14-authentication-system.rst
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/17

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New API for labeling Engine?
Message-ID: <1442953198943-5225522.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
I just saw a recent commit labeled "New API for labeling engine
(QgsLabelingEngineV2)" [0]

Can anyone tell us more on that work that seems very promising?

My question is not totally innocent, I just launch funding to start QEP's
work on labeling improvements. I would like that QGIS can handle several
features, but need to fund exploratory work before knowing how to do that
exactly:
  - add core ability to draw callouts between features and labels
  - add new label types, that wan be labeled on "paths", just like ESRI
annotations. 
  - port to C++ features currently available in EasyCustomLabeling Plugins
and Mask plugin. 
       - generate layers dedicated to manual labeling (addition of data
defined fields).
       - Allow to mask labels outside of an area of interest, and allow
Atlas to use it in batch use cases.

Thanks for your lights, and maybe we could share our targets here (I know,
you are fast.. we are slow.. ;)). 

All the best
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Replacing Raster and Vector menus with Processing
	algorithms (update)
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zSWfY1CYujkRwpunBTeq4dzJiOAML_Rpx2H_KUfrxM3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

As a first step to replace Raster and Vector menus with new menu
entries that call Processing algorithms to avoid redundancy (as we
have been discussing since sometime ago...), I have added a new method
to Processing named addAlgorithmEntry. It adds a menu entry in the
specified menu, which calls a Processign algorithm. Basically, it's an
easy way of placing an entry point to a Processing algorithm outside
of the Processing toolbox

Usage is rather straight forward

addAlgorithmEntry([name_of_algorithm], [menu_name], [submenu_name],
[menuentry_text], [icon])

The last two parameters can be ommited, and the original title and
icon of the algorithm will be used.

Here is an example, on how the Raster/Conversion menu could be
replaced with this:

import os
from GdalTools import GdalTools
from processing.gui.utils import addAlgorithmEntry
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

def addRasterAlgorithm(name, group, iconName):
    icon = QIcon(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(GdalTools.__file__),
"icons", iconName + ".png"))
    addAlgorithmEntry(name, "Raster", group, icon = icon)

addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:rasterize", "Conversion", "rasterize")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:translate", "Conversion", "translate")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:pcttorgb", "Conversion", "24-to-8-bits")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:rgbtopct", "Conversion", "8-to-24-bits")
addRasterAlgorithm("gdalogr:polygonize", "Conversion", "polygonize")


Now it's a matter of making sure that all algorithms are replaceable
with a Processing equivalent, and add more lines to the above a script
for creating the full alternative menu structure.

Then, that script can be called by Processing itself, or put it in a
separate plugin that adds GDAL/OGR functionality based on Processing
algorithms. (Paths to icons should be modified from the above example,
of course)

Let me know if you have questions or you want to help on this,

Regards

Hi Victor,

Thanks a lot for this work !

I think this kind of script must ben called by Processing which can check
if all the needed providers are well configured ( grass, otb, etc.). Menu
item could then be removed (or just set inactive) if Processing finds any
issue with each one.

Regards
Micha?l

There's already a ticket. It's a limitation of the Qt framework on OSX, so
until that's fixed upstream (maybe it's fixed in Qt5, I've not tested)
there's nothing we can do.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGSrelationeditorwidget in custom form
Message-ID: <CAM_TN3-d8W=TuVhuxLfJdwqiHKWT163wJ6ZB=PAveaO1G7VSGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the QGSrelationeditorwidget in a custom form with qtcreator.
It works very well (very powerful feature !) but I have some problem:

The first is that I can't fit my subform due to the large amount of data
present inside of it. I wondering if it were possible to set the width of
the leftmost column (where there is the selection of the related record)
because it is huge and it use the main part of my form. I try to see in the
properties of the widget but unsuccessfully.

The second problem is that I can't activate my custom objects into the
subform when I switch to editing mode because I can't find the proper
signal. Is there a signal
for QGSrelationeditorwidget that say to me when the subform goes in editing
mode ?

Thank in advance
Luca

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Writing GUI for QGIS<-->iOS/Android Sync Tool and
	GDAL 2.0
Message-ID: <CA+g+PQDLQ7TwPiVm=uEQJWT+kwPvG9c0yWC=3+UJ4u=o1uG_Eg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello qgis-devs,

A co-worker and I are working on optimizing a few things for our QGIS <-->
iOS/Android sync tool and we have a few questions. By the way, in case you
are interested about the tool itself, you can read this:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2015-September/033717.html

We have two questions:

1.- What is the recommended way to add a specialized GUI? I realize there
is a python plugin architecture - we'd be happy to code against that. But I
also noticed that we could go the route of a Qt dialog
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/4d681f03c64478918d8db8096b736bd055a56846/src/gui>
and
we could definitely go that route, too. Is there a particular advantage
about using one vs the other beyond language choice?

2.- The second question is related to GDAL versions. Our tool relies
heavily on GDAL/OGR and I am curious if there are any plans to switch GDAL
2.0 anytime soon? If not, we can back port a lot of our changes, but I
wanted to understand what was the release plan before we started pushing
one way vs another.

Thank you for reading this far!

- Ragi

Hi Luca,

The width is not configurable with a property on the top widget. I
assume's it would be with a stylesheet (the object name of the widget is
"listViewWdg").

The subform represents another layer, so you can connect to the other
layer's signals.

Hi all.
If I:
* open a line layer
* apply a style defined for polygons, rule based
* then I go back to Single symbol style
* the style remains of type polygon, and I cannot find a way to have my
lines style back.
I think this is a bug, does anyone confirms or knows whether there is a
ticket? If not, I'd open it.
All the best.

This was motivated by my work on rule-based labeling (landed just
moments ago in master). The labeling engine has existed without major
architectural changes for 5-6 years since its introduction. Since then
lots of features were added and the original framework started to show
its age. The new API should allow for much more flexibility... things
like running labeling engine completely independently from the main
rendering loop, using anything as a source of label features (e.g.
raster cells?) and so on. The old API (QgsPalLabeling) is of course
still available (and acts as a wrapper of the new API), but should get
removed in QGIS 3.

Labelling raster cells would be awesome!

Very nice to see labelling get some love! I could add my wish to your list:

* allow canvas border to be treated as a labelling impediment to prevent partial labels

Hi Martin, 
Thanks for your lights. 
The idea is to write advanced QEP's by the end of the year. Then, we will try to fund coding on that roadmap (all is opened there). All good ideas are welcome for those QEP's. Oslandia is now funded on the QEP's part and will start the work and work on that at the hackfest. 
Several parts of QGIS will be touched, from qgs format and ability to store data and ressources , labeling API up to UX design.
Cheers

If I understand your wish correctly, this is already possible: in vector
layer's properties - Labels page - click the upper-right button to open
(global) labeling engine configuration - uncheck "Show partial labels".

Will this work in QGIS server, too? I mean: when a map is requested 
through WMS a bbox is sent in the request. Won't there be any partial 
labels at the edge of the bbox?

It seems that WMS server supports that option too (from a look into
the code, not tested).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] A few issues with 2.10 diagrams
Message-ID: <5603CD93.1040602@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
diagrams are nicely improved in current version. However, I found a few
minor issues:
* when giving a transparency to diagrams, on repoening the dialog the
cursor is reset to 0, even if the values of transparency is correctly set
* IMHO the default placement should be at the centroid of the polygon
rather than around it
* histograms seem to be always working in map units, which is unclear to
me. I can explore this more thoroughly if useful.

Should I open three tickets?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Minidump when using GDAL in plugin
Message-ID: <1443092274881-5225874.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I have problems with  DEMto3D
<https://github.com/jawensi/DEMto3D/tree/master/DEMto3D-QGIS>   plugin.
Using this plugin in QGIS 2.10.1, QGIS crash on exit. Instead I test it in
QGIS 2.8.1 and works fine without minidump message on exit. 
I've tracked the problematic code and I find out that it's the use of the
GDAL
function ReadAsArray, for reading the content of a raster band.

/dem_dataset = gdal.Open(path_layer[0])
band = dem_dataset.GetRasterBand(1)
data = band.ReadAsArray(x_off, y_off, col_size, row_size)  /

The plugin works, but the problem is the crash dump on exit.

Any idea if the problem is in the plugin or in QGIS.?

Thank you

That is most likely exactly the issue which a couple of other plugins face...

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11901
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10823
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11891

Your report might be a step forward in solving this issues? Do we need a bug report up-streams for GDAL?

Cheers

+1 indeed the full level of control as we have available for labels would
be very welcome.

Something like symbol levels would be great as well. The main idea would be
to be able to control the order of diagrams, e.g. small ones on top of big
ones.

Best wishes
Anita

Hi Denis,

Unfortunately this seems not to be enough.
If pythonpath is set pyuic4 still produces wrong import.

Here's my environment and command to compile ui file
with QgsMapLayerComboBox.
------------------
C:\OSGeo4W64>echo %PATH%
C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python27\Scripts;C:\OSGEO4~1\bin;
C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\WBem;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\msys\bin

C:\OSGeo4W64>echo %PYTHONPATH%
C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\python

C:\OSGeo4W64>pyuic4 test_widget.ui -o test_widget.py
-----------------

In the compiled test_widget.py there's still a line:
from qgsmaplayercombobox import QgsMapLayerComboBox


Paths should be set correctly because importing qgis.gui works ok from
python started from the same environment.


PyQt and pyuic4 reads custom witget definitions
from C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins.
I think that PyQt is not aware
of C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins folder.


This is not a problem of only pyuic4.
Also all plugins that use custom qgis widgets and try to import ui files
directly in their code using the uic.loadUiType() function crashes on
windows!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] profiling python plugins
Message-ID: <CAHHAMpCJd8AWn5-vG0pOdN7fZn_NK=CjgEcQfHF_-Yoiif22MQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm seeking advice on how to profile python plugins running within QGIS.
Besides providing a useful tool to the development environment for
plugins, it would
also provide useful information from our continuous build process.

My hope is that there is some way to conditionally start a profiler when
the python interpreter is initialized within QGIS.  This would help avoid
placing profiling code in the plugin source.

The interpreter appears to be initialized here...

*qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp*
    void QgsPythonUtilsImpl::init()

Is it possible to conditionally invoke the embedded profiling functions
during initialization in
QgsPythonUtilsImpl::init?
    PyEval_SetProfile(Py_tracefunc func, PyObject *obj)
    PyEval_SetTrace(Py_tracefunc func, PyObject *obj)
    PyObject* PyEval_GetCallStats(PyObject *self)


Or maybe there is there a way to utilize startup.py to provide profiling?

Ideally I would like to call a QGIS method to provide the results in a
python console or when executing a test script.

Any guidance is appreciated.

Thanks,
Robb

Hi Lauri, hi J?rgen,

I think you're right and
\apps\qgis-dev\python\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins\qgis_customwidgets.py
should be moved to
\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\uic\widget-plugins.

This file is not intended to change over QGIS versions and is totally
generic.
In fact, it will load the qgis version depending on the PYTHONPATH.

J?rgen, are you ok with this and can you do so?

Cheers,

Denis


PS: here is the content of qgis_customwidgets.py

Hi Anita

right click on sourceLayerCombo, in the contextual menu there is
"Promoted Widgets" or "Promote to", there will open the menu with
QgsMapLayerComboBox listed. You can find it's name in "Promoted
class"... the error is that in the Line text "header file" have to
write  the python module name that contain the class. In you case the
module name (without .py) that contain the class
QgsMapLayerComboBox... I suppose it would be "qgis.gui".

here more details: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/designer-using-custom-widgets.html

Hello

I'm develop my first plugin that allows interaction with geometry features.

I already change the map canvas elements from plugin but now, I want to make
the inverse, pick the geometry (point/line/polygon xy coordinates) from map
canvas when I change it with mouse...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Deselecting layer classes
Message-ID: <560432F1.3080806@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I need to select only a few classes from a complex legend. Deselecting
the whole layer leaves all the classes selected, but not visible on the
canvas. To show only a few of them, I need to unselect each of them,
which is boring. Am I missing something, or this possibility is missing?
Thanks.

I'm trying... 

QgsHighlight(self.iface.mapCanvas(), feature.geometry(), layer)   
QgsHighlight(self.iface.mapCanvas(),
QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(x,y)).buffer(10000,5), layer)
QgsHighlight(self.iface.mapCanvas(),feature.geometry().buffer(10000,5),
layer)
self.iface.mapCanvas().refresh()

Nothing...

this is what is done inside qgis when identify a feature

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgsidentifyresultsdialog.cpp#L1508

probably you forgot to do highlight.show()

Hi,
This issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12700 might also be concerned since
it seems to be side-effect of HiDPi improvements.

Hi

I am also having this problem when publishing a layer as wms. I have tried
turning off diagrams on the affected polygon layer (and all others) and
saving the QGIS project but the diagram tags (Pie chart) remain in the QGS
file. I have tried deleting the layer from the QGS file but it appears again
as soon as I save the QGIS project. 

I have also noticed that when I remove the layer from the QGIS project and
re-add it, the diagram tags in the QGS file are not present but when I
change the symbol (colour of a simple fill) the diagram tags appear again.

Any help appreciated

William

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Metasearch throwing an error
Message-ID: <56051B13.5000704@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
the current version of MS returns an error when adding default servers:
Cannot parse XML file: not well-formed (invalid token): line 11, column 129
When reinstalling, I get:
Impossibile caricare il plugin MetaSearch a causa di un errore chiamando
il metodo classFactory()


Traceback (most recent call last):

It's because we're entering feature freeze, nothing special.

Hi Paolo: I was able to reproduce this issue.  The default CSW
connections list had XML errors.  I have fixed this in master and
release-2_10 branches.  I've also added this as a note on our guidance
page [1].  Can you confirm the fix works for you?

Thanks

..Tom

FindGEOS.cmake changed in that commit, introducing the new variable 
GEOS_CPP_LIBRARY. It looks like a simple reconfigure of an existing 
build directory is insufficient for cmake to pick up that change, and 
people have reported that it is necessary to start from an empty build 
directory for the build to succeed, perhaps removing the CMakeCache 
might also be sufficient. Anyone with enough low-level knowledge of 
cmake to explain why the reconfiguring does not pick up the changes in 
FindGEOS.cmake ...?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] TypeError: C++ type 'QgsFeatureIds' is not
 supported as a signal argument type
References: <K-2yXu0----0@tutanota.com>
Message-ID: <K-3KhIn----0@tutanota.com>

Hi QGIS developers!

I got strange error with the 'commitedFeaturesRemoved' signal.
See:?http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html#a520550b45603ed20d593b1050768bd97

I try on python console (with any active layer on editing mode):
>>> layer = iface.activeLayer()
>>> def listener(s, l):
>>> ???? print s, l
>>> layer.committedFeaturesRemoved.connect(listener)

It returns `TypeError: C++ type 'QgsFeatureIds' is not supported as a signal 
argument type`

Now replace `layer.commitedFeaturesRemoved.connect(listener)`by:
>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import QObject
>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import SIGNAL
>>> QObject.disconnect(layer, SIGNAL(r"committedFeaturesRemoved()"), 
>>> listener)

No error, but it returns `False`.

If I delete some features and switch off editing mode, it returns nothing! No 
print! The signal doesn't work(?)

After exchanging a few message with some people on irc #qgis, the error only 
appears with latest QGIS version on OSX10.10.5. (it works well with 2.8.2).?

Maybe someone that has approached the same problem... and solved it?

confirmed, thanks a lot!
I'm getting an error from PCN, but that's a separate issue, now
investigating.
all the best.

Hi devs,

As you can see in the PR [0], I've fixed up some things, including adding
the ability to edit an authentication ID, which will help with workflows
where users need to share projects. I've also cleaned up the interface and
moved most PKI-related dialogs out of the main Options view.

I am working on another widget that can be used for the Handle Bad Layers
and the Layers Properties dialogs. That should work for most issues
occurring when sharing projects and when users open projects with missing
authentication IDs. I've also added feedback in the selector widget when it
tries to load a config ID that is missing.

I should have those bits done today, then it's mostly work on finishing the
unit test migration to C++.

**However, I would like to merge this now, since it is in a very good state
for doing so. Does anyone have objections with me merging this?**

Message-ID: <CAFcOn29xKymYkEtHG=zHZsO92siFCNUqxfzM7gXKnbua4-zzZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for a Kriging interpolation from an irregular point data
set to raster data in QGIS without dependencies, if possible. There's
1.       Interpolation plugin (C++) [1]
2.       ?Raster Interpolation? plugin von Denis Rouzaud (Python) [2]

I know that GRASS and SAGA implemented Kriging [3].
But these are are dependencies I'd like to avoid in order to make QGIS
even more easier to use.
AFAIK even Denis' "Raster Interpolation" plugin requires Scipy
separately installed.

So eventually, I'm considering to extend "Raster Interpolation" Python
plugin (or [1])
Any suggestions or activities regarding this?

 You want Kriging in QGIS? You now have to implement a full
statistical analysis system in QGIS. Kriging is hard, or even
impossible to do properly as an automatic points-to-raster process
without statistical diagnostics. You'll need to plot your variogram.
You'll need to fit your variogram. You may need to transform your
variables, and transform results back (and the back-transform of
Kriging standard-errors is not trivial).

 The simplest points-to-raster Kriging system I've seen is autoKrige
from the R automap package. Even so this has about 7 parameters and
options to choose from. Plus working in R makes it easy to plot
diagnostics and histograms and do transforms and testing....

 If you want to try all that, there's a few python kriging
implementations that you could use, or this blog poster shows how to
do it from scratch with basic matrix ops:

Hi Barry

Many thanks for your explanations and hints.
So from a pragmatic point-of-view ("80/20 pareto rule"):
Do you think Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) would do the job as well,
since Kriging has so many parameters to fiddle around and to understand?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QCA lib dependency for master
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR86zxML8xL2-E7n-FVaKJfaKKPhnnW0__iSYvwFtCCJ=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

With PR #2330 merged, there is now a dependency upon the Qt Cryptographic
Architecture (QCA) library and one of its plugins [0] for master builds.

See first two posts of the old PR #1838 for information on getting QCA
installed for your system [1]. I will update INSTALL tonight or tomorrow.

QCA is GPL2-licensed tool now part of the KDE project [2]. Its usage in
QGIS has a run-time dependency upon QCA's OpenSSL plugin (qca-ossl), which
keeps QGIS from directly linking to OpenSSL, thereby avoiding any annoying
export restrictions. You can install other QCA plugins, but qca-ossl is
prioritized over any others in QGIS startup code. If the plugin is missing
the new authentication system will gracefully disable itself (let me know
if it does not).

Latest QCA version is 2.1.0 (and recommended), which builds on all major
platforms using CMake and includes all available plugins in the build
process. However, the code has been tested against version 2.0.3 (package
on Ubuntu 12.04), which requires separate building of plugins.

The Travic CI builds already have the necessary bits added for QCA in their
setup scripts.

Larry, I noticed that the ssl plugin is mandatory if you enable
tests. While I do understand that tests exist for using the SSL
plugin, should that be a recommended but not mandatory dependency ?

I hadn't tried disabling QCA completely, but it should be checked
if it still allows enabling tests.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [ANNOUNCE] 2.11 feature freeze begun
Message-ID: <20150926071521.GA27345@norbit.de>

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.11 development cycle ended yesterday at
12:00 UTC. We are now in feature freeze on the road to the 2.12 release on
2015-10-23
(http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20151023T12&p0=1440&msg=QGIS+Release+2.12&font=sanserif&csz=1)
(27 days away; see also roadmap
<http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html>).

Now *we*, *the community*, need to prepare QGIS for release. No new features
will be added anymore. *Users*, if not already begun, should now start
extensive testing of master and report bugs on the hub <http://hub.qgis.org>.
*Developers* should move their focus from creating new features to fixing bugs.
*Translators* can can continue their work (we maintain all our translations on
transifex now).

The nightly builds of QGIS testing available for Windows
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#windows>,
Linux (Debian and Ubuntu)
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu>) and Mac
OS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-macos-testing>
are now effectively snapshots of what's going to be released.  Except of course
for the bugs that are going to be fixed until release day.  For Windows there
will also be weekly release candidates of the standalone installer
<http://www.qgis.org/downloads/weekly/>.

Lets keep up working together to make 2.12 another great release.

Ok, that should be fixed with dd9b37b. Tests are skipped if the qca-ossl
plugin is missing. It should not be a mandatory dependency.

Not sure I understand what you mean by 'disabling,' or why doing that would
be useful for testing. It won't compile if QCA is missing (won't configure
either, just like other required libs).

Thanks. It would still be nice to print a RECOMMENDED warning.

Ok, I thought QCA was still optional, no problem then.

Message-ID: <1443273338712-5226284.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello, see my code, please. I intend to maintain Z value on shapefile, so:
I write first on canvas... even I give the Z value, it will write Z = 0.0,
ok...

feat = QgsFeature()
feat.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromWkt("LINESTRING (151620 319350 10, 151710
319350 10)"))
layerCanvas.dataProvider().addFeatures([feat])
layerCanvas.commitChanges()
self.iface.mapCanvas().refresh()

So, for grab the Z value, I go to the shapefile and update Z...

driver = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile')
dataSource = driver.Open(myfilepath, 1)
layer = dataSource.GetLayer()

oldGeom = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt("LINESTRING (151620 319350 0, 151710
319350 0)")
newGeom = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt("LINESTRING (151620 319350 10, 151710
319350 10)")

# write shapefile
for feature in layer:
	if feature.GetGeometryRef() is not None:
		geom = feature.GetGeometryRef()

		if geom.Distance(oldGeom) <= 0.1:

			# delete oldGeom
			featureId = feature.GetFID()
			layer.DeleteFeature(featureId)

In canvas, I see the right Z :)
But when I edit something, I lost that geometry...
In point geometry, that's all ok, but in linestring, it disappears...
Thanks

Hi Larry


Great to see this new feature make its way into QGIS. One thing I am curious about is what happens when we want to publish a project in QGIS server. What is the standard workflow for that or similar situations (e.g. shared project stored on a network drive?

Regards

Tim

That should work for most issues occurring when sharing projects and when users open projects with missing authentication IDs. I've also added feedback in the selector widget when it tries to load a config ID that is missing.

Hi Paolo,

Is this related to issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13310? This issue is 
preventing me from installing Grass on Ubuntu 15.04.

 Depends on what "the job" is. To get an impression of the overall
trend of a set of samples - IDW is probably fine. But to get a
*principled* (ie based on a statistical model) set of estimates over a
grid *with honest estimates of uncertainty* so you can answer
probabilistic questions (like "what's the chance that the soil over
there will contain 1ug gold/tonne?") you need something like kriging.

Hi Tim,

For shared project scenarios, including the network drive setup, you can
edit the authentication configuration ID to something that is shared across
users. (Thanks to Nyall for pointing out that this, and the Handle Bad
Layers dialog, needed solved before feature freeze. [0])

Since the authcfg ID is embedded in the project file, each user just needs
to make an auth config that has their specific credentials for that
resource, then edit the ID (upon creation or config or after) to the same
ID in the project file. Then, when when the resource loads, the same
configuration will be queried on everyone's QGIS, just with their
respective credentials for the authentication method used.

With the very last feature I added, for the Handle Bad Layers dialog, users
can Add/Edit/Remove auth configs within the dialog and have the data source
URI updated to match. So, in the scenario of a shared project, the user
could immediately add an appropriate new auth config (and see exactly what
shared authcfg ID should be used) upon project loading .

Also, see the discussion in the PR about other sharing scenarios, and how
the unimplemented Resource URL could help here  [1].

Regarding the QGIS Server launch, I think a good fix would be to add
support for passing the master password as an environment variable to a
password file, like is done with Postgres and other setups. For example, an
env var like QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_PATH could be set to a filepath. In
QgsAuthManager::instance()->init() the variable could be read, password
loaded, then the variable unset in the env. This would also make a great
way to allow using Desktop without having to enter your master password
every session.

Similarly, the master password could be in an OS's keychain or keyring and
be auto-input in the background on launch if that user's OS key cache is
unlocked. See Matthias's suggestion for that [2].

Currently, the master password auto-set can be set via Python, or by way of
a custom C++ plugin, on launch setups using a call to
QgsAuthManager::instance()->setMasterPassword( "mypassword", true ).
However, I think many of the Python bindings should be blocked for the
initial release. So, setting an env variable to a password file path seems
like a good start, especially for QGIS Server.

Note: for Server, you can also use QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH to set the path to
a qgis-auth.db dir on the server.

Hi Salvatore,
I'm unable to find the ticket no., I would like to know if the virtual
field issue is fixed
in current master (today I'm unable to build the master on Ubuntu 14.04 due
to an
error linking geos library, related to the following changes [1]).

Did you have time to have a look at it?
Otherwise, if you need help in crushing this bug, please just ask.

Cheers!
Giuseppe

Forgot the attachment:
http://drive.dakotacarto.com/qgis/auth-edit-authcfg-id.png

That shows editing the auth config ID in the config editing widget, which
can also be accessed from an auth config selector widget's Edit button. The
selector is what would generally be the only widget needed in plugins or
standalone apps for users to access and work with the auth system. You can
see the selector embedded in the PostGIS and OWS service connection dialogs.

Once a plugin has an auth config ID it just calls to QgsAuthManager,
passing the ID, to 'expand' the auth config where needed, in a
QNetworkRequest object for example. The auth method plugin associated with
the config then manages what credentials gets expanded and how, after
QgsAuthManager marshals a call to the plugin.

Looks like I need to get busy finishing the auth system overview Lucidchart
diagram I started!  :^)

Note that the OSX daily build system seems broken since a while, and
there's no current way for users to test on OSX without building for
themselves.

Not sure how this can be addressed, but given the embarrassing state of
recent releases on OSX it's a big issue...

Any ideas?

Hi Nyall,

Sorry about that. Seems my notification script was failing. I will have the
Mac nightlies back up tonight. Also, I will introduce a slim fully bundled
version, without any external installs needed.

Alternatively, I can do a very minimal Homebrew-based build that has almost
no bundling, and only requires a base QGIS formula install of dependencies

Yet another option is add light bundling to the Travis builds and push
those to an Amazon S3 bucket when completed.

Again, sorry about the nightlies. Been too busy to notice

Regards,

Larry

Ahh, not at all... happens to all of us! Good to hear it'll be back up
and going soon. I really want to get our OSX users more involved in
beta testing and feedback so we can raise the quality of the mac
release to the same level as the win/linux releases, and having access
to these daily builds is a big part of this.

Cheers,
Nyall

Subject: [Qgis-developer] News - request time out
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYpWQrT6CMJgo_huvL+ryBwnVz6Ln7j5_bTzWD2ptRsZ8w@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting sometimes but quite frequently 'Network request
https://www.google.com/uds/?file=feeds&v=1 timed out', which probably
comes from doc/whatsnew.html (google.load("feeds", "1")). News are
loaded correctly. The request in a browser works ok.

Another problem is authentication telling
'https://www.google.com/jsapi, Unable To Get Local Issuer
Certificate..., Certificate Untrusted: ...' on every launch until I
set 'Do not verify peer certs'.

Unfortunately this happens even if 'Open project on launch' is set to
'New', which means that News are not displayed at all. Would it be
possible to load News page only if it is really shown?

Nice feature, btw, the News.

Attributes map must be updated just after the signal has been emitted
otherwise the attribute index changes before to remove the index
throws the exception on
the attribute form code. It happens only when the attribute table is open.
You fixed a very similar issue recently (#13366)

known issue, I had to edit my CMakeCache.txt

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Which menu to put LiteratureMapper (New) Plugin in?
Message-ID: <5608BECF.5080802@wildintellect.com>

We're about to upload a new plugin. Before we do, we wanted to ask
people's opinion on which menu to add it to.

In short it's a plugin that works with an online Zotero bibliography to
georeference literature in a way that lets you create web maps (embeds
geojson).

For more details see:
http://micheletobias.github.io/maps/LiteratureMapper.html

Any opinions on best placement?

Web seemed like a possible location but might be hard for users to
realize that's where it's filed.

It just occurred to me that it would be really slick if the plugin
manager told you which menu the plugin shows up under.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,
Thanks for the plugin. IMHO web is OK. The installer kind of tell you where the plugin is placed (category), but I agree it could be more obvious.
All the best.

I'd prefer Kriging to IDW also for simple jobs.

Kriging is (at least) four operations:
0: Know the assumptions and check your data, transform if necessary and possible.
1: Estimate your empirical semivariogram (describing how difference increases with distance).
2: Select a parametric semivariogram model, and adjust parameters to fit the point cloud from 1) 
3: Use the parametric model to calculate a weight matrix between each target location (grid point) and each observation point.

Loosely speaking, the three first operations define the core of Kriging. The last operation answers the same question as IDW, both providing the coefficients (weights) in a linear combination of the input data. 

With Gaussian data, spatial stationarity, well-spread data points and a properly selected/tuned semivariogram model, Kriging can be shown to be 'Best linear unbiased estimator' (BLUE), and provides mathematically correct estimates of the variance at each target location. IDW promises no such thing, hence appears less dependent on assumptions. This does not imply that IDW is more robust or almost-as-good for simple tasks.

For the numbers that both methods do provide, it is possible to evaluate and compare the two using leave-one-out cross validation. 

With just a reasonable a priori judgment for the range parameter, my guess is that Kriging will beat IDW in cross-validation for most problems, including notoriously assumption-breaking daily precipitation data. With some scripting, it is also possible to optimise Kriging's semivariogram parameters by minimising the cross-validation RMSE. This does not qualify for being BLUE or for trusting the variance estimates, though.

All this said, the extra burden of finding Kriging in one of QGIS' plugins, may serve as a warning that there is more to it than just plug-and play.

Sjur  :-)

Hi!

I'm using QGIS master x64 from OSGeo4W, and I'm experiencing crashes (with minidumps) each time I exit QGIS (including if I just open and closes QGIS).

I don't know how to extract a stack trace from the minidump (if it has one?) and renaming the ".qgis2" folder doesn't help.

I have just updated the my MASTER edition from OSGeo4W, based on revision c7a3ea3, but I haven't found a build date for that revision. The "qgis-dev-bin.exe" has a modified date of September 16, 2015, but I would expect it to be newer by now?

I could open a ticket describing the problem, but I'm not sure where the problem is? QGIS code or OSGeo4W builds?

Can any give me a hint?

Regards, Casper

the date of your revision is a couple of weeks ago (15 Sep), in the
meanwhile a lot of fix have been pushed
Please try a more recent revision, the crash should disappear.

Also try disabling plugins - a crash on exit can be caused by a bad plugin.

Kriging is not that hard to find in QGIS, you just have to go to the
Processing search box and type "Kriging" to find all the the kriging
algorithms ;-)

>From the point of view of user-friendliness, the Processing
implementation (wrapping the corresponding SAGA modules), might not be
as easy to use as some people would like, but for tools such as
kriging I am strongly against wizard-like UI's and similar elements.
ArcGIS's Statistical Analyst is great and has a wizard with a
fantastic "next" button that allows you to interpolate using all sort
of esoteric methods and will make you believe that you are creating
sound raster layers...when the truth is that, without knowledge, you
are creating rubish. I don't like to give users that wrong sensation.

People want a "Kriging for dummies" functionality, and that's is a bad
idea. Kriging is complex and it's not easy to understand the
underlying principles...but you have to understand them if you want to
use the tool. I think there's no other functionality as misused in GIS
software as this one...everyone want to use kriging because it's cool
and they have heard it's better...but without studying what it really
is.

(I get questions about this topic often, so here's my take on it and
on why the Processing implementation is like that, in case it might
help).

Hi Nyall and Salvatore.

I have made a manual install of the nightly build from OSGeo4W and now I have a newer revision and no crashes so far. So problem solved.

I do a quiet update of my nightly build each morning using the OSGeo4W installer, and something must have gone bad, since the installer didn't wanted to upgrade my previously install. But again problem seems solved, so no reason to dig further into that.

Thank you for confirming the my previous nightly build installation was too old!

Regards, Casper

A client of me as noticed that the latest qgis-dev from osgeo4w doesn't
contain some of the latest commits. Actaully it refers to commit 6a6adc9
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/6a6adc9>, which is 6 days old.
I thought osgeo4w contained the nightly build, while weekly snapshots were
available as standalone installers.

When you say sample models you mean the ones in the online github
collection? That repo needs a bit of love, i guess... Anita proposed
separating them in folders indicating which version they work on. It's
a good idea, but I have to find some time to implement it and curate
the collection of scripts and models a bit...

Agreed. Anything claiming to be a "wizard" for Kriging really needs to
be a psychic wizard that can read your thoughts and understand your
data. A better device would be an "Interrogator":

*ping* Your data seems to be discrete small integers, are you sure you
want to model it as a Gaussian? [*yes*/no]

*ping* So you want to model your data with Gaussian cofactor response
p-value thresholds from an underlying Bayesian surface? [*yes*/no]

*ping* That last question was nonsense. You're just clicking "yes"
until you get a surface model - any surface model - right? [*yes*/no]

*ping* okay, at least you are honest. I'm deleting the kriging module
now, go find a statistician.

That's right.   There have been issues with Windows build - mainly GRASS
updates, but over the weekend also missing dependencies that were newly
introduced.

I added 

* QCA (in 64bit including a patch working around a crash on exit),
* GEOS 3.5.0 (including a patch introducing an C-API to the precision model;
  OSGeo4W's GEOS doesn't include the C++ API) and
* GDAL 1.11.3

to OSGeo4W and now it carries QGIS fefd85a in both 32 and 64 bit.

The weekly snapshot is just a standalone installer of the (qgis-dev) state of
osgeo4w at that point.

Well written and I fully support that.
Sometimes it seems that people want a wizard for everything (and a
computer that can read their mind).
I am against imitating everything that "commercial software" provides.
Sometimes it is better to treat users to switch on their brain.
For me that is still the point that separates Opensource Software from
proprietary one.
I am not sure if we should try to get more users at all cost. Let's do
things correct - even if that is not always popular (because it is not
in reach with one click).

just my 2c

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiSzOWqST49vrpZ0TNzqs=onRaMoh=DVLPKhH1A9HzQ7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to suggest removing the Openstreetmap tool from Vector menu
for the upcoming release. Reason: It does not work. The resulting DBs are
incomplete.
See discussion in
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2014-May/027668.html
and related ticket https://hub.qgis.org/issues/8878
Also, the workflow is far from intuitive.

Currently, the Quick OSM plugin seems to be the much more reliable option.
Maybe we could add that to core instead?

Best wishes,
Anita

That'd be a big -1 for me. I use the current OSM tool shipped by default on
a monthly basis.

Hi Mathieu,

Thanks for your insights! So you are not encountering the issues described
in the ticket? Or are you using it for a very specific purpose which is not

Hi,

You'll find 2 krigings algorithm implemented in R.

In the processing toolbox, you can get these scripts with R scripts > 
Tools > Get R scripts from on-line scripts :
* Kriging
* Kriging with model selection

Werner, Barry

I just wrote to have Kriging in QGIS with less external *dependencies*
like GRASS, SAGA (or R).
That's what I meant by "easier to use" in my initial thread.

Then I challenged the benefit of Kriging versus IDW just because I
don't want to use it because it's cool.
Thanks to Barry and others for the explanations.

The use case you obviously have in mind, is to do data analytics as a
researcher or informed user - which requires the steps Sjur mentioned
(many thanks too).

On the other hand, to me it's still worth thinking of a helper dialog
(in whatever implementation and whatever you call it) which suggests
parameters calculated on cross validation.

... Unless you are saying that only statisticians can ever master Kriging :-O

Hi Marco,

The new node editor widget does not suport Z value of 3d shapefiles, right?

Could Paulo's proposal be interesting to add to the node widget?

Thanks!
Pedro

Stefan

Leaving aside the statistical discussion, the Processing
implementation doesn't use really an? "external" element. It uses
SAGA, that's true, but if you use a QGIS package (in Win or Mac), SAGA
is installed and configured automatically, and it is used as any of
the dozens of libraries that QGIS uses underneath ...so the user wont
notice that is using an external software, just like you don't notice
that you use GDAL for opening layers.

Using R is a differenet thing, that requires manual configuration...

Cheers

Hi Stefan,

My post was in no way meant offending. I replied to Victor and Barry
just because of the nice joke about "wizards".
My experience at university is just that a lot of students use
"wizards" without knowing what they are doing and Barrys post
described exactly what I saw at university.

I hope you will find (or already found) what you are looking for.
With Kriging unfortunately I cannot help you because I just did not
understand it ;)

regards,
Werner

Werner: I'm with you.
Victor: Thanks for the pointer to SAGA tools in Processing.

The background of my questions is, that I'm having a research project
in mind where we need to implement Kriging for predefined agricultural
soil samples.
Here the farmer does not need to know what's under the hood.
Now I'm thinking to give back something to the QGIS community like
parameter suggestions calculated from cross validation.
And I'm reluctant to implement this using something other than a QGIS
extension (nothing against SAGA).

Any one who has experiences on how estimate any Kriging parameters?
E.g. these SAGA tool parameters look especially "frightening" :-)
Power function A/B (in Universal K.) and Variogram Model (in Ordinary K.)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange problem with drag-n-drop
Message-ID: <CAMCJChuyjFi3+RRmnRju5kgOpoQA1VSvL0Wg4EtO7X1tp=gHsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am with a strange problem with drag-n-drop in QGIS. If I have the Browser
pannel fixed on one side of QGIS window, the drag-n-drop does not work
properly, as shown in this screencast:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi7266i4074bltn/drag_n_drop_problem.ogv?dl=0

If the Browser pannel is "free", then everything works fine.

This happens to me on Linux, with Xubuntu and Lubuntu 14.04, with QGIS
2.8.3 and master, both self compiled.

Anyone confirm?

Thanks,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Its a tough choice - I remember a while back you mentioned the possibility of using an in-place binary update service (I forget the name of the framework) so that we could incrementally update our .app bundle. It would be awesome to start with the nightly builds using this approach so that we can just get the delta of changes each night. Otherwise I would probably opt to continue with the same strategy you currently have for nightlies (requiring shared frameworks for GDAL etc) and introduce slim (probably more like ?fat?) builds for the actual released versions of QGIS for OS X (so that they can be installed sans shared frameworks from William).

While brew is nice, it requires testers to install a lot of stuff on their system in order to be able to test QGIS nightlies, so I would prefer that brew is marketed as a tool for dev rather than for testers.

Tim

Sure. You can also pilfer the user documentation, as referenced in the QEP
[0]. It was the in-house doc for the Boundless version that was focused on
PKI, but still gives a pretty good overview of the user's perspective on
working with the system. (Oh so snazzy Win 10 screen snaps as well!)

The Authentication section of Options has graphically changed, but that's
about it, beyond the screen snap in this thread.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Please help to prepare the changeling for QGIS 2.12
Message-ID: <4357943E-648F-4C03-B0FD-8B7455DE17B9@qgis.org>

Hi all


Most of you should be aware that we are in feature freeze 2.12. Each release adds more and more features, especially advanced features which are sometimes difficult to document. Could I call on those who have introduced key new features like e.g. the authentication framework, new gemetry tools, new labelling tools etc. to provide me with details descriptions of your work for the visual changelog?[1]  Those of you that are pressed for time and can?t write a lot of details, please consider just supplying a bullet list of facts and I will fill in the details.

If you have direct access to the change log, please consider adding entries, or stubs for entries (with screenshots if you can!) - again I am happy to fill in the details, but please provide enough info that we are able to test it and document it based on your description.

If you do not have direct access to the change log, please consider sending me an email with notes and screenshots if you would like me to promote a new feature.

Don?t forget to include the name of the developer for the new feature, their url, the name of the feature sponsor and their url if you are interested in promoting them.

By the way, those of you who experienced issues with the change log in the last releases, please give it another go - I made many small fixes to it over the  last month or so and (while it is certainly still not perfect) it should be more useable now.

If anyone would like to assist in writing up the changelog, please contact me. You don?t need to be a developer, just have good english writing skills, a recent nightly build of QGIS and some spare time. I would be most grateful for any help provided.

Finally could I ask folks not to blog / share the changelog on social media etc yet - lets save that for release day so that what we are sharing with people is current and complete.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing ParameterCrs default to canvas CRS
Message-ID: <CAHCHdbKj=BwiDhwYM+PGaJ_yE0i4Kt5dxdgaj8VP1MbppkvSZg@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any way to make a ParameterCrs in a processing tool dialog default
to whatever the CRS is on the map canvas? Current behavior is to default to
4326. Even better would be to make the parameter dependent on an input
layer, much like ParameterTableField works.

As far as I can tell, this is beyond the current capabilities of the
processing framework. I'd love to hear if anyone else has addressed this in
some way.

A trick is modifing the line in .ui file changing the "header" tag

e.g. (for QgsDateTimeEdit widget)
original is:
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsDateTimeEdit</class>
   <extends>QDateTimeEdit</extends>
   <header>qgsdatetimeedit.h</header>   <---python error looking for
"qgsdatetimeedit" module
  </customwidget>

modified is:
  <customwidget>
   <class>QgsDateTimeEdit</class>
   <extends>QDateTimeEdit</extends>
   <header>qgis.gui.h</header>    <---works!
  </customwidget>

Of course it is not usable becouse every time you save the .ui file form
QTDesigner you have to change the <header> tag again!
I could not manage to use the "Promote.." to save the correct header
definitively

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR--PVy7iGx8JhGDq2HAChC-vmCGH6MbbGPnFLK=3Lx8JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When compiling on Mac, the following line takes ~30 minutes to complete:

[  0%] Building CXX object
src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/qgsexpression_texts.cpp.o

Also, it is recompiled every time anything with the CMake build setup is
touched, i.e. editing any CMakeLists.txt file, so it is making recompiling
during dev work very painful.

This has tripled the build times on my very fast Mac dev box and the
nightly box, both of which have SSDs. Any ideas on speeding up the
generation and or compiling of the texts?

How large is that file on your machine?  Here it's about 150k.  One of the
largest files - but qgsexpression.cpp is almost the same size.

Not sure if it grew significantly, when it's production was changed from
including the html function help to filling the objects.

And I didn't find an elegant way to make the preparation only run if one of the
json file changes (or a new one is added).

qgsexpression_texts.cpp is 144 KB on my two build boxes.
Here's the generated file:
https://gist.github.com/dakcarto/d55927def236e269295a

The file is the same on both Mac 10.7 and 10.9 boxes.

qgsexpression.cpp is ~128 KB on my two build boxes.

Didn't time the 10.7 box (just guessed), which is used for the nightlies,
but just did and it is ~ 55 minute wait there.

Thanks for looking at this.

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrnWgtfq8NvpX_QaizDpr8YAyS3DEFZk5WOcsL_P41Z5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'd like to share this article someone sent me, comparing ArcGIS and QGIS (
gisgeography.com/qgis-arcgis-differences/ ).
I do not agree with all the assertions of the author, thinking  sometimes
that he doesn't really know how powerful QGIS can be (even though I,
myself, don't know how ArcGIS is these years). But I think it's worth
reading. And maybe we can find ideas to improve QGIS.

If there's one thing I can take in this article and the comments below,
it's that QGIS is really poor in documentation. Many options, features in
the GUI are not (fully) documented. So since we are in feature freeze, if
at least new features can be well documented...

Regards,
Harrissou

Odd, qgsexpression_texts.cpp takes 22s here and qgsexpression.cpp 43s (gcc
5.2.1 on Linux).  But both brings a "note: variable tracking size limit
exceeded with -fvar-tracking-assignments, retrying without".

I didn't notice any significant longer compile times on Windows either.

No clue why qgsexpression_texts.cpp takes so much longer on OSX.

It's also fine on the Travis OSX builds. Maybe something local with your
build environment?

It's not simple ;) but I agree that it's an annoying side effect of
the shapeburst. You'll also notice that with a large enough distance
you'll also see the effects of polygons being clipped just outside of
the canvas

The answer is hiding somewhere in
QgsShapeburstFillSymbolLayerV2::distanceTransform1d:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/symbology-ng/qgsfillsymbollayerv2.cpp#L1262
Basically at the moment that algorithm assumes that pixels at the
beginning and end of a row should have an initial distance of 0, when
for our uses they should have an initial distance of infinite.
Unfortunately the highly-optimised maths in that function is a bit
beyond my grasp, so if a shotgun trial-and-error approach fails, I'll
need to wait until someone with more advanced mathematical
understanding comes along to fix this!

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO:STRING=-O2 -g -DNDEBUG

If I set the optimization to -O1, -O0 or none, then the compiling of the
file drops to mere seconds, even on my older 'nightly build' Mac.

Here is what I propose for a CMake adjustment on the compile flags for just
that file:

https://gist.github.com/dakcarto/0cc443708487d205254a

Since I am confessedly a absolute noob when it comes to compiling
optimizations, I would appreciate an opinion on that diff. Also, if you
usually do Debug builds (no optimization), can either of you try compiling
with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release or RelWithDebInfo to see if the slow
compiling shows up for you?

The Travis build does not have CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set, i.e. is None or just
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS or CMAKE_C_FLAGS used, which combined are
"-Wno-deprecated-declarations". So no optimization there, so no apparent
issue.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing test suite
Message-ID: <560B7497.8050409@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
Processing has become a crucial piece in our infrastructure, and I am
convinced it deserves the best of our attentions.
IMHO a full and proper test suite is a necessity. From the QGIS side
this should be straightforward; the tricky part is to invoke the various
backends, in their several versions for the various OSs.
So my question is: is there anybody willing to take this? I think we can
ask power user to support us, and we probably have QGIS funds to cover it.
All the best.

Thanks for the proposal Paolo. This is clearly an important need for Processing

I, however, don't think that the test suite should have test for all
algorithms. The most important part, IMHO, is to test the framework
itself (which will be quite complex itself). It is very uncommon that
a change in the Processing code breaks a single algorithm. Usually it
breaks several of them that shares a point in common, or all of them.
Testing a representative set of algorithms (using all types of
parameters, outputs, etc) and different situations (used in  the
modeler, used with this or that type of data...) should be a good
start.

I wrote some tests some time ago, but I guess most of them wont pass
now, I haven't mantained them during this time. I can take a look at
them and we might be able to reuse them. They were, however, not setup
to be run on a testing  QGIS, but simply run from the QGIS console.
That won't work for automating it and linking it to our CI system, so
we should work on preparing the testing infrastructure.

My time is limited, but i will try to help as much as possible if
other people are willing to collaborate.

Cheers

Hi Nyall, 
thanks very much for the pointer, we know now where to look for a solution.
Another hypothesis, couldn't that be the inverted polygon renderer that is
sending a polygon clipped by map extent + a margin ? If this is the case, we
could simply put a greater margin value. Maybe Hugo at oslandia knows that. 

Cheers
R?gis

great news! Congratulations Anita - hope this will not distract you too
much from QGIS, rather it will make collaboration between QGIS and
OSGeoe tighter and easier.

?Not sure ... It's difficult to pick between the tips and recent projects
tab ... which of the two tabs should be shown by default? Or are you
thinking of combining the two contents?

Imho, this doesn't seem urgent. Most people have probably deactivated the
popup.

Don't we also use the popup as a donation reminder now?

Best wishes,
Anita?

Hi Paolo and all,

I think idea is good but I found one negative side.
I like to have map canvas as large as possible -> tabs make it smaller.
Same happens when you have a lot of plugins, they create more and more 
bars (also below the canvas!)
If tabs will be used more in future, there will be then some area away 
from canvas all the time.

I think we should develop some method to keep canvas as large as 
possible. There is users (like ngo) who cannot afford to buy nice 4K 
displays. I think that even HD size is for lunatics.

Cheers,
Kari

The tabs under discussion are not permanent - they are only visible until you open a project or add a first layer. If you try one of the nightly builds you should see the startup tabs and then get a better idea about the discussion.

I would suggest to add another tab.

surely not urgen, and I believe it is not feasible now that we are in
freeze.

not so sure about that, but in any case having the tips at hand would be
good. And with the current method it seems easier to add more.

yes, but see above (deactivated) ;)
BTW, I would like to have a special section of the news describing
current crowdfunding opportunities - I think this may greatly increase
donations.

All the best.

Hi,

I was planning on moving the tips to a new tab so consider this done once
we are out of freeze.  We can also split up the news tab to add extra info
not just the blog feed. Have it pull from different places for different
info.

Regards,

Hi Kari,

Note that the tabs are only displayed immediately after the start of 
QGIS. Once you opened a project, the tabs are removed and the map canvas 
gets as much screenspace as it had in previous QGIS versions - so not 
really an issue.
