You can keep the default assignee (i.e. nobody) for tickets.

just sent a reminder to the PSC. We have to decide what parts of the "Release"
and "Developer" information need to be migrated. I cannot decide that, but I
hope we will complete the migration soon :). The "Community" and "Finance"
parts are done.

Again, please only get/add information from/to the new wiki: www.qgis.org/wiki

Subject: [Qgis-developer] indentation scripts
Message-ID: <20090702093537.GA31572@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I'm not sure everyone is aware of this: in the process of releasing 1.0 of QGIS
we reindented our code base.

To maintain the indentation I added a few files to the scripts directory:

astyle.sh:
runs astyle with our indentation settings on passed files.  It also makes sure
that unix style endings are used if flip(1) is available.

prepare-commit.sh:
checks what was changed in the working copy, runs that through astyle.sh and
shows a diff of the indentation changes.   This should be run before each
commit.

update-indent.sh:
keeps track of the revision it was last run on, updates to the current
revision, runs all files change inbetween through astyle.sh and echos the svn
commit command that should be run to commit the reindentation.   Currently I
run it manually from time to time.

Originally Tim and I wanted to do automate this on commit using a server side
hook, but server side hooks are not allowed to change code.  But we might at
some point implement something that rejects commits that astyle.sh would
change.

Hi all,
I just compiled rev. 11005 and I immediately found a problem. Trac right
now does not work so I'll drop here my note meanwhile it returns
available.

I open qgis, create a test vector layer (tested polygon and line), save
it and the vector does not appear (removing it and reloading does not
works). If I zoom out it arrives at a scale that qgis closes/crashes:
"seg fault". No further message.

tested on Ubuntu 9.04 32 bit and Debian testing 64 bit.

Hi all,

I have made a py plugin that plot points at a given position over an
underlying map.
At a given rate (1 time per second for example) the points change position
and move over the map.
I have used QgsVertexMarker to do this.

Now I am trying to plot instead of the "icon" make available by
QgsVertexMarker class, a custom image loaded from a file.
SO I modified the class in the following way:


   - add ICON_CUSTOM to the enum


enum IconType
    {
      ICON_NONE,
      ICON_CROSS,
      ICON_X,
      ICON_BOX,
      ICON_CUSTOM
    };


   - add the method

void QgsVertexMarker::setIconFileName (QString fname)
{
  mFileName=fname;

}


   - modify the QgsVertexMarker::paint

void QgsVertexMarker::paint( QPainter* p )
{
  qreal s = ( mIconSize - 1 ) / 2;

  QPen pen( mColor );
  pen.setWidth( mPenWidth );
  p->setPen( pen );

  switch ( mIconType )
  {
    case ICON_NONE:
      break;

    case ICON_CROSS:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, 0, s, 0 ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( 0, -s, 0, s ) );
      break;

    case ICON_X:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, -s, s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, s, s, -s ) );
      break;

    case ICON_BOX:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, -s, s, -s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( s, -s, s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( s, s, -s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, s, -s, -s ) );
      break;
    case ICON_CUSTOM:

      QPixmap pixmap(QSize(22,22));
      pixmap.load(mFileName);
      p->drawPixmap(0,0,pixmap);
      break;
  }
}



   - update the binding file .sip

The problem now is that the icon (png file) is not plotted correctly until I
refresh the map canvas.
See the attached images.
notcorrectvisualization.png is what I obtain on the screen
and
correctvisualization.png is waht I obtain after pushed the refresh button.

Any suggestion to solve ??

Hi Juergen,

maybe I'm missing something, but what's the reason behind requiring to
have the source code perfectly formatted all the time? :-) If we care
about proper formatting, isn't it easier to do the indentation update
only before creating release branch?

My concern is that indentation commits make any parallel development
harder and create additional conflicts in code that need to be
manually resolved.

It would be wiser to load the pixmap just once and keep the QPixmap,
it will save some time when doing updates. Additionally, you don't
have to set pixmap's size before the load() method - the pixmap will
be resized to the required size during the load.

Yes: you have to update boundingRect() function to return correct
rectangle of the marker. Currently for markers it's something like
(-5,-5)..(5,5) while you probably want a bounding rect e.g.
(0,0)..(22,22). But think also where dou you actually want to put the
pixmap - currently you draw it in a way that the position is at the
upper left corner of the pixmap. Maybe you want it to be in the
center...?

Hi!
I was able to reproduce the error* 10 times out of 10 with the vector
you can download at this link**. Consider that is a "complex" polygon,
but I reproduced the error also with very simple ones.

These are my observations:

a) with this test layer (that has many nodes), once clicked with the
"simplify feature" tool, the slider takes a few seconds before show up.
Maybe this is physiological delay, maybe is possible to do something.

b) add the layer, click with the simplify tool, move the slider, put the
slider to the initial value, click ok -> qgis crashes

c) add the layer, click with the simplify tool, *don't* move the slider,
click ok -> qgis do not crashes

then if you click again with the simplify tool, move the slider, put the
slider to the initial value -> qgis do not crashes

d) when you use the simplify tool as in c), then you exit the editing
mode, qgis asks if you want to save the changes -> this do not make a
lot of sense as no changes were made.

e) I noticed also the following: take the "majrivers" shapefile (you can
find it in the qgis demo data), and test the simplify tool. On some
features it works fine, on others it behaves like the above description
and on others is enough to click with the tool on the feature to crash
qgis.


Platform is Ubuntu 9.04 and QGIS rev. 11005


Hope this can help

Hi Martin,

I solve the problem of pixmap visualization using the correct icon dimension
(setIconSize () )
but I don' t understand how to use boundingRect() and... which
boundingRect() method----

Hello Devs!

I am getting following error starting QGIS 1.2 compiled from trunk on

in advance for any information.

I suggest you to produce the debs (debuan folder from trunk) and install
from these: you have all the packages you need, and they will honour the
(many) dependencies.
All the best.

Thanks a lot,

I have already found system ho to reproduce and probably fixed this error.
I'll test it with this layer and if successful send it to Martin.

I didn't notice yesterday that I started qgis as a root (from a console after
building and installing the debs). Today I got "segmentation fault" (that's
the only message) trying to do that as a regular user. 
What would I need to solve the problem? Thank you in advance for any help!

I just built the updated source on OS X with qt-4.5.2 carbon. The  
build went well. Tested with a shapefile, and everything looks good.

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bugs in SpatiaLite provider?
Message-ID: <66a45d6d0907040114j4ddead71v36d2291ae303406e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, list!

I'm try to move one project from shapefiles to SpatiaLite database and
find some bugs I think.
I've create new empty spatial database with nessesary spatial and
ordinary tables, QGIS load
empty spatial table succesfully.
Also I create simple plugin which copies features from shapefile layer
to SpatiaLite layer, but it
doesn't work. So I tested this plugin with both shapefiles layers
(source and destination) and it
works fine and copies features from source to destination.
Here some code:

vproviderA = vlayerA.dataProvider() # source shapefile layer
allAttrsA = vproviderA.attributeIndexes()
vproviderA.select( allAttrsA )
		
vproviderB = vlayerB.dataProvider() # destination SpatiaLite layer

inFeat = QgsFeature()
Geom = QgsGeometry()
lstFeatures = []

vproviderA.rewind()
while vproviderA.nextFeature( inFeat ):
	Geom = QgsGeometry( inFeat.geometry() )
	outFeat = QgsFeature()
	outFeat.setGeometry( Geom )
	lstFeatures.append( outFeat )
vproviderB.addFeatures( lstFeatures )

Is this code correct or possible I do something wrong? Or maybe this
is a bug in SpatiaLite data provider (in addFeatures method)?

Another problem string attributes are clipped when they contains
national characters (e.g. "?", "?", "?"). How to check:
  1. Create empty SpatiaLite base with one spatial table
  2. Add this layer to QGIS
  3. Create one feature and add text attribute with national
characters (I use ukrainian)
  4. Save
String is clipped on first national character.

And at end I have one question related to QGIS and SpatiaLite. Is it
possible to create and add spatial view as layer to QGIS.
With PostGIS layers it's possible, so I think it's possible add this
functionality for SpatiaLite

Hi all.
Until now, only Tim applied for a travel grant: anybody else?
All the best.

Hi Otto,

thanks a lot for the effort in migration!

>From a brief look I see there are also some outdated pages that have
been migrated too. Supposedly only admins have the rights to delete
wiki pages... is there any template available that one could use to
mark a page  outdated?

I've found out there are also some pages missing, e.g. PythonBindings
page which serves as a quick introduction to the API. So I would wait
some more time with putting the old wiki offline until we get this
kind of things sorted out.

Bye
Martin

no, there isn't. Can you send me a list of outdated pages, that need to be
removed? I migrated more or less everything, except the pages Marco told me some
days ago. It would of course be nice to clean up the content.

good! I tried to catch everything, but maybe there are some (more) pages
missing. Can you tell me, what is missing - except PythonBindings? If you or
anybody else find more pages, please tell me or migrate them. I will also try
to find some time and check the wiki within the next days again.

  Otto

Here are some notes from Marco:

that's why I didn't migrate these parts from
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopersCorner

"Build notes for developers"
 SVN trunk
    * Building with CMake - build guide for all platforms
    * PythonBindings

do we need those pages?

Hi Otto

Yes. However, 'PythonBindings' and 'Building with CMake' are not under 'General' and not under '0.8 and earlier'. I meant to keep those ones. Sorry if I was unclear.

Marco

Hi all,

just some thoughts, please treat as IMHO.

I love shapefiles, but they are one foot in the grave. I can see SpatiaLite taking their place.

I followed Massimo's email on OSGeo on release of spatialite-gis ALPHA
[1] and thought, hmm...looks like qgis. But it is not.

I would really like to see this support in QGIS too. It is not clear
from the organizational point of view whether all this nice features
better be developed under QGIS, but not stand alone from the start,
this is author's decision, I respect that. I'm all for
lots of tools, but the question for me personally is when will I *finally* be
confortable with switching from Arcview to QGIS fulltime.

I think what we really need here is a SpaliaLite manager, much in the
line of the excellent PostGIS manager: any taker?

It would be useful knowing what exactly prevents you from the switch (ie
what are the weak points of QGIS, in your experience).
All the best.

Hi all,

I would like to manage OGC services (WMS and WFS) under ACL (Access Control

Is this possible with the present releases?. If not, is there any roadmap

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsVertexMarker modified class: Plot moving points
	over a map at fixed rate
Message-ID: <48d9b78e0907070741m2c04f450o5e9f7c83653b4921@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have modified the class QgsVertexMarker and the plugin to plot at a fixed
rate some points over the map with a custom icon. (previous mail below)

How can I delete a Marker from the map ?
I try to delete the QgsVertexMarker object using "del" in python but it free
the memory but the icon is ever over the map.
My actual solution is to "hide" the marker using no custom icon but this
method still paints something (not visible) on the screen.

any suggestions
?

Thanks in advance
Luca






I have made a py plugin that plot points at a given position over an
underlying map.
At a given rate (1 time per second for example) the points change position
and move over the map.
I have used QgsVertexMarker to do this.

Now I am trying to plot instead of the "icon" make available by
QgsVertexMarker class, a custom image loaded from a file.
SO I modified the class in the following way:


   - add ICON_CUSTOM to the enum


enum IconType
    {
      ICON_NONE,
      ICON_CROSS,
      ICON_X,
      ICON_BOX,
      ICON_CUSTOM
    };


   - add the method

void QgsVertexMarker::setIconFileName (QString fname)
{
  mFileName=fname;

}


   - modify the QgsVertexMarker::paint

void QgsVertexMarker::paint( QPainter* p )
{
  qreal s = ( mIconSize - 1 ) / 2;

  QPen pen( mColor );
  pen.setWidth( mPenWidth );
  p->setPen( pen );

  switch ( mIconType )
  {
    case ICON_NONE:
      break;

    case ICON_CROSS:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, 0, s, 0 ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( 0, -s, 0, s ) );
      break;

    case ICON_X:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, -s, s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, s, s, -s ) );
      break;

    case ICON_BOX:
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, -s, s, -s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( s, -s, s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( s, s, -s, s ) );
      p->drawLine( QLineF( -s, s, -s, -s ) );
      break;
    case ICON_CUSTOM:

      QPixmap pixmap(QSize(22,22));
      pixmap.load(mFileName);
      p->drawPixmap(0,0,pixmap);
      break;
  }
}



   - update the binding file .sip

+1 from me. It's very good it have SpatiaLite and RasterLite support in QGIS.

I think first of all we need not SpatiaLite manager, but full and bugs free
integration (support) of Spatia and RasterLite in QGIS. At this time there is
some problems with this.

Besides there is some problems with accessing and manipulating spatial-enabled
tables through Python pysqlite module. sqlite3 module from OSGeo4W installer
doesn't have "enable_load_extension" capability so, user can't load
library libspatialite.so
(libspatialite-2.dll) and work with spatial-enabled tables. Some
version of pysqlite installers
or sources have this problem (disabled and not working
"enable_load_extension") too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with shp files created in QGIS when
	imported to R
Message-ID: <4A53756B.3040604@gmail.com>

Hi!

I've found a couple of things that seem to be errors. Let me
know if I should fill error tickets.

1. A shape file drawn as a set of independent straight lines in QGIS has 3 pairs
of coordinates (the 3rd == the 2nd) for each line , which made unhappy some R 
functions once the file was imported through rgdal as an SpatialLinesDataFrame. 
For the first line:
 > coordinates(fl1)
[[1]]
[[1]][[1]]
          [,1]    [,2]
[1,] 449919.6 4631874
[2,] 448616.7 4630789
[3,] 448616.7 4630789



2. Shape files edited in QGIS, i.e., deleting one line and making another one,
and then saving, cannot be imported to R through rgdal.

Roger Bivand (author of readOGR() in R) has done an extensive exploration, his 
last comment being:
"OK - this means that QGIS doesn't delete it, but just marks the DBF in a 
particular way that is highly non-standard, and probably only understood by OGR. 
I suggest running ogr2ogr to see if the feature gets flushed too"

Not sure if this has to be reported as an error, perhaps something to
be modified in order to avoid problems with other software?

I reproduce here Roger's tests and comments:

The problem was downstream, in that a 0-length segment created problems
for sampling from the line. Otherwise, the duplicated point is simply
redundant. It looks as though the line termination operation adds a final
point even if that point is already given.

Just marking a DBF field as missing is probably not a portable way of
deleting a feature, it really needs to be removed fully.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0907071405v4b035cb6l73d8d56a1147b2a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to announce new version of PostGIS Manager - already in the
repositories (both in mine and in contributed plugins at pyqgis.org):
- shows triggers and rules, able to delete or enable/disable them
- faster GUI as it loads only content for current tab (and not all of
them as before)
- geometry processing - allows you to do area/length calculation and
(optionally) set a trigger that updates the field on inserts and
updates
- table versioning (experimental) - modifies a table so it stores all
history of the changes
- various updates and bug fixes I've incorporated from the feedback I've got

Any feedback is welcome as usual :)

use following code to delete a marker:
canvas.scene().removeItem(marker)

Canvas items are assigned canvas as a parent. This means that if
canvas is being deleted and the item still exists, it gets deleted
too. In c++ it's enough to delete the marker instance and it's gone.
However in Python if you do "del marker" you actually delete only the
reference, not the real object because it is owned by the canvas. By
explicitly removing the item you make sure it won't be shown anymore.

Message-ID: <3937B41A-DE0C-4A25-9AD5-432501F14E0A@kyngchaos.com>

I'm not sure yet if I'm doing something wrong in my build, but  
Spatialite 2.3.1 isn't working.  Using the identify features tool on a  
Spatialite layer returns no results.  After the failure, when the  
display redraws for any reason, that layer disappears.  (tested with  
the spatialite sample data)

I'm using an external Spatialite - my Sqlite framework on OSX, which  
includes Spatialite.  I just updated the framework to Spatialite 2.3.1  
and now it's broken.  (previous framework: Sqlite 3.6.15 + Spatialite  
2.3.0; new fw: 3.6.16 + 2.3.1)  Simple spatial queries in the CLI  
sqlite tool work, but I haven't tried anything more there.

I recompiled Qgis 1.1 just to make sure, but that didn't help.

I saw that Spatialite was updated in trunk, but I don't see any  
changes to the provider or interface sources, so I didn't see any  
point in compiling a new trunk version.

Has anyone tried Qgis with the new Spatialite, and does it work?

Great enhancements of the plugin thank you very much. I have some

1. The schema list in Database view should be sorted

2. On some tables (not in all cases) I do get the following error

Hi Horst,

both are fixed in 0.5.1. Anyway I don't really understand the reason
of 2nd problem - it seems like there's a constraint on column that
doesn't exist... or something goes wrong in the plugin :-) Could you
post me the contents of the metadata tab for such table(s)?

Hi Martin,

Thank you for this very useful plugin. It feels to me a bit like
ArcCatalogue in the ESRI world.

I have two smaller request if it would be possible:

For the map preview - could you re-use the QGIS-settings from the options
dialogue regarding:

a) mouse wheel behavior/zooming and
b) antialiasing setting

I don't know if a python plugin can read out these settings? It would be
cool if the user would "feel at home" by getting the same as setting as in
regular QGIS.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

that's a good idea, implemented in v0.5.2. Antialiased map looks much better :)

Martin

I found out further issues related with OID Indexes (1) and table
versioning (2) and one enhancement (3). 

1.
When I select a table with OID index, the meta data Indexes part shows:

Name Column(s)
afu_prog05_oid_idx ??? (#-2)
afu_prog05_idx wkb_geometry

A double click on this table leeds to the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/barpadue/.qgis//python/plugins/postgis_manager/ManagerWindow.py",
line 439, in editTable
    dlg = DlgTableProperties(self.db, ptr.schema().name, ptr.name)
  File
"/home/barpadue/.qgis//python/plugins/postgis_manager/DlgTableProperties
.py", line 64, in __init__
    self.populateIndexes()
  File
"/home/barpadue/.qgis//python/plugins/postgis_manager/DlgTableProperties
.py", line 350, in populateIndexes
    cols += self._field_by_number(col).name
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'

All tables without OID Index can be double clicked without any problems.

2.
* The schema select box content should be sortet.
* The geometry index and all other indexes of the versionized table
should be a patial index with the constaint "where time_end = NULL ".
With a partial index you will have huge performance advantages. With the
time the amount of archived or historized records will grow up. P.e. one
table of our cadastral data contains more than 1 Mio records, but 700000
of them are not in production state (end_time <> NULL). With the partial
index these records don't exists for Postgres, as the result you do not
have any performance problems with your production data. 

3. I would be nice to add a selected table to Qgis mapcanvas.

Horst

Hi all,
I'm working on update new GRASS modules in QGIS (1.1 unstable) and i 
find a problem with some old modules if I work on Windows platform.

If I try to open them I have this error:

Cannot start module r.in.srtm
command: C:\PROGRA~1\QUANTU~1.2\grass//bin/r.in.wms.bat --interface-description

"""" non ? riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno, un programma eseguibile o un file batch. >

Some of this modules are:
r.in.srtm
i.in.spotvgt
v.in.e00
v.in.mapgen
r.mapcalculator
r.shaded.relief
r.param.scale
v.db.addtable
v.db.droptable
v.db.addcol

..and many others

I open a ticket about this:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1765

Anyone has the some problems?

Leonardo

Hi Marco,

My requirement is also similar to what this post asks...

There are some doubts about ur method...please see if u can find time to
answer these..

would I be able to use all the mapTools like selection,identification etc on
the layer that i need to update constantly 
by using your method (apart the normal static layers..)?? 

and can i add this live layer on to the legend and also set its symbology
from the layer property dialog box?

and i have a doubt about what u said .."In this subclass you need to create
a QgsVectorLayer.." so u mean that this subclass should have a
QgsVectorlayer object (or as many as the need may be for live layers) on
which i keep adding the live objects...and within this subclass i call the
paint method which will draw the objects??
and i guess i have to keep the same reference to the only Qgsmapcanvas
object for this subclass aswell as the objects are to be drawn only on the
mainCanvas.. and what about maprenderer object??should it be also the same
object as for the main layers??
and about implementing the paint method.. in short i would be calling the
drawFeature of the QgsVectorLayer Class(for all the features on the layer )
from within the paint function that would be custom implemented.. is it?

Please enlighten me..

Thanks for finding time and helping us.. :)

Best Regards.

Ashish

The file qgis_msvc_deps_except_qt4.zip[2] seem to be missing or un-reachable.


Could anyone let me know if the file is available in some other link.


Rgds.
Abhay.

Hi Godofredo,

Thanks for the quick response but the INSTALL also providing the same link
for qgis_msvc_deps_except_qt4.zip

this link is providing the following error.

Reading the INSTALL file I can see it is also outdated. 

 

The file qgis_msvc_deps_except_qt4.zip used to contain all headers and libraries needed to build Qgis, now you can download OSGeo4W from here: http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe and download and install GDAL, GEOS, GSL, EXPAT, POSTGRES libs.

 

then in the cmake step point to lib and include folders of your osgeo4w installation directory, this way cmake can find the dependencies.

Hi, 

Anita Graser created a SVG version of the QGIS logo for us. This task was
already open for a long time and I am happy we finally have it :) - thanks a
lot.

I added the logo to QGIS trunk at ./images/logo/qgis_icon_new.svg
and I would suggest, we check, if we want to keep the old qgis_icon.svg or not
and rename the new one then. 

You find the logo as well in the wiki "Press Centre".

Ah, tables with oids, that's something I've completely forgotten...
Anyway, isn't it discouraged to use oids for regular tables?

That's why I'm not adding any indexes to the tables with versioning,
because I wasn't sure how to do it correctly. I was thinking about
using multicolumn indexes - e.g. geometry+endtime, that would probably
do the right thing too. But the partial indexes seem to be more
appropriate. Thanks for sharing.

Already on my TODO :-)

What are you reasons for not having primary key for the tables?

Yes, it would be possible, but this is something that should be
available in postgres provider first...

Thanks Godofredo and Tim for your inputs.

I am able to compile the missing dependency like sqlite and postgresql using
the OSGeo4W libs.

The only question I am left with is, I have installed pre-compiled version
of QGis that come with OSGeo4W.
The plugins dir of those present in my home dir under *".qgis"* folder is
raising error related to python plugin.
Is there a possibility to be able to run my source compiled edition with
separate profile?

Thanks and Rgds.

Abhay.

Hi Ashish

To answer your questiones: the proposed solution was only meant for the display of a layer that is regularly updated. As you noted, it is only put on top of the map and it does not integrate with the legend and the normal tools. I think for this it would need support for updated layers implemented in the gui/app classes.
But even with my described plugin solution you could implement your own tools that work on the separate updated layer also in your plugin.

As updating a layer without repainting the others is a frequently asked question, I wrote once an (intentionally simple) example plugin that adds an independent layer on top of the QGIS map. You may download it from http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/updatelayer.tgz
But what I described is only one possible solution, there may be many others.

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: Re: AW: [Qgis-developer] Rendering single layer from mapcanvas
 

Hi Marco,

My requirement is also similar to what this post asks...

There are some doubts about ur method...please see if u can find time to
answer these..

would I be able to use all the mapTools like selection,identification etc on
the layer that i need to update constantly 
by using your method (apart the normal static layers..)?? 

and can i add this live layer on to the legend and also set its symbology
from the layer property dialog box?

and i have a doubt about what u said .."In this subclass you need to create
a QgsVectorLayer.." so u mean that this subclass should have a
QgsVectorlayer object (or as many as the need may be for live layers) on
which i keep adding the live objects...and within this subclass i call the
paint method which will draw the objects??
and i guess i have to keep the same reference to the only Qgsmapcanvas
object for this subclass aswell as the objects are to be drawn only on the
mainCanvas.. and what about maprenderer object??should it be also the same
object as for the main layers??
and about implementing the paint method.. in short i would be calling the
drawFeature of the QgsVectorLayer Class(for all the features on the layer )
from within the paint function that would be custom implemented.. is it?

Please enlighten me..

Thanks for finding time and helping us.. :)

Best Regards.

Ashish

The current situation is ambiguous: a reporter is lead to think that an

Hello Devs,

Do any of you know of a C++ plug-in tutorial or how-to?  The only one I have
been able to find on the web is at
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/DevelopingPlugins and appears to be outdated.

Thanks,

Matt

Hi

Yes that was the intended meaning - IMHO feature requests are just as likely to imtroduce new bugs as they are to fix existing issues. That said, I think its probably fine to change it to annoyance only.

Are you on trac admin list to make these kind of changes?

Regards

Tim

Hi Martin, 
here is my "wish list"/notes for the future updates of Postgis Manager:

*) when loading data from shapefiles, the "choose input shapefile" shows
always the home folder (in linux) when it opens. Would be better to make
it open in the last folder used otherwise is very annoying when loading
many shapfiles.

*) multiple load data from shapefiles

*) when a shapefile is loaded into postgis the table list is not
refreshed in the database view

*) when changing the table structure (by adding/deleting/editing
columns) of a postgis layer that is loaded in the map canvas, refreshing
the layer after the changes are applied. This already happens in qgis
when you alter the table structure using the "properties -> attributes"
menu.

*) when adding/editing a column I get always an error if I try to define
the length of the field. 

*) when adding/editing a column, when choosing a particular type, an
error is returned if the "can be null" checkbox is not selected. For
these particular types should be better to have the checkbox
automatically selected.

Thanks for your effort

I select WGS84 or ED50 for the output shape. This
is not the case using Global Mapper:

QGIS UTM 31N ED50 POINT(449919.586269 4631874.109627)

TRANSFORMS TO LONGITUDE,LATITUDE:

QGIS ED50  POINT(2.396864 41.836439)
QGIS WGS84 POINT(2.396864 41.836439)

GlobalMapper  ED50  2.39686371? E	41.83643863? N
GlobalMapper  WGS84 2.39572870? E	41.83535625? N

I cannot guarantee that Global Mapper is right, of course,
but doesn't it make sense that the coordinates be
different in both datums? I suspect that proj4 (behind QGIS)
is not using the +towgs= field.

Any opinions on this problem?

Thanks

Hi Matt

Hi Agus.
I think QGIS is mostly ignoring +twgs parameters. This is the root of
several bugs, and I think is one of the major issues to be solved.
Mentioned also in our bug squashing initiative:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Bugs#Projections
Unfortunately, it did not attract much specific funding jet.
All the best.

Thanks,
In that case, before the problem is fixed,
it should be prominently stated that conversion
of coordinates involving different datums in QGIS is wrong.
Otherwise, this implies a serious loss of reliability. This
is an important matter for people using GPS coordinates, which
are often in WGS84 by default. Users cannot rely on "on the fly"
reprojection, but should set their GPS on the same CRS as
the maps they will be using later.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS modules problems
Message-ID: <4A5B6007.8090809@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Some problems with the GRASS plugin:
- r.mapcalc sometimes takes the wrong list of rasters (one of the names
is duplicated, and masks the real name of another layer - playing around
with those rasters with wrong names, I has a nasty crash of the whole qgis
- importing PosGIS layers is difficult or impossible: if I define the db
connection so that grass can access the postgis db, it tries to write it
back there; if I define a connection towards a different db where I want
to write (eg a dbf or sqlite) it cannot find the PostGIS db
- in db.connect we shoud set up a fixed "schema=" option, so that if in
db.connect.schema a connection schema has been defined, this gets
overwritten every time a d.connect is called; otherwise, the schema is
called every time, and db.connect fails.
Opinions?
All the best.

just below the QGIS logo top/left is the link "QGIS Wiki" leading to

Message-ID: <1247561139.4681.62.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,
actually in qgis if I toggle the editing of a layer that is not active
in the legend, the points/nodes do not show in the map canvas. If I
toggle the editing of a grass vector layer that is not active in the
legend, the points/nodes show in the map canvas.

What is the right behavior? I guess that it needs to be consistent for
both grass and non-grass vectors, maybe not allowing to toggle the
editing of non active layers.

Hi all.
What about dropping 1.0.2 line, and concentrating on 1.1.x, and soon on 1.2?
My arguments:
- most people use 1.1 or trunk (see the poll)
- 1.0.2 is not more stable than 1.1
- we do not seem to have the human resource to backport systematically
the many fixes we have in 1.1 (often, not even those in trunk)
- the current situation is quite confusing for necomers (and probably
also for many other users); see e.g.
http://qgis.org/en/download/binaries.html
All the best.

Try opening a previously saved QGS file with a WMS layer and no internet
connection with 1.0.x .. crash! This means I can't really use QGIS 1.0.x
when traveling or if the internet is down. Nonetheless, I do my main
work with the "stable" 1.0.x series since I work with other people .. we
keep our versions the same for obvious reasons.

Versions 1.1.x and beyond are more stable with this particular matter.

The current "Move feature" tool does not allow rotation,

geometric shapes

Hi Agus,

Marco Hugentobler is currently working on a point-rotate tool for rotating
SVG symbols.

Are you sure that a rotate function really makes sense for line and
polygon features? I doubt it. What would be the use-case?

FWIW, that would be my preferred approach if I was a member of the

For planing low height aerial campaigns with small format cameras. It's 
useful having a rectangle of the size
of the planned footprint (of a single image or of the length of a flight 
line and the width of an image) and moving it and orienting it to 
accommodate the features that you want to cover.
Also, defining a rectangle to clip an image (which I use to simulate the 
result that we are supposed
to get if appropriate imagery is available, i.e. a previous
regular aerial photography)

In general, this would be useful for designing field sampling schemes by 
locating rectangular plots of a pre-defined size.

Similar but why not to include this feature within the Edit tools? At 
some point
the user may want to use some of the tools already present in the current
version.

Along the past days has been made an effort of "cleaning" the trac. Here
is the actual situation:

active tickets 300
total tickets 1781
critical 17
major 81
minor 202

a few more critical tickets are probably going to be closed in the next
days. Paolo and Lorenzo are working to close many tickets of the GRASS
component.

Among the nasty bugs that I (too) suggest to solve as soon as possible,
there are the ones about projections, scale and measures, as already
pointed in this wiki page

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Bugs


in detail:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/418 
QGIS fails to read undefined projection from user datum in shape.prj

+1 again on leaving only 1.1, we're having not 2 but 3 versions
of QGIS "stable", "unstable" and "even more unstable", this is
confusing.

But please also check Tim's comments [1] on this issue raised sometime
ago, they are valid.

Good point. However, I think Tim was a bit optimistic on our manpower,
especially when he says that "it doesn't take that much effort to
maintain" 2 versions: in fact, most bugfixes are not backported, not
even to 1.1., so I would now vote for releasing frequently a new version
from trunk, when we reach a general consensus that the current trunk is
stable enough to be released (as it happens now, IMHO).
We should not underestimate the potential confusion among users: in my
experience, this is a very real problem.
All the best.

Backports are only for 1.0, 1.1 is just a release of the unstable branch - it
doesn't get any long term support - such as backported bugfixes.

At least that what I understood.

But I also believe that any manpower spend on 1.0 is mostly wasted - no matter
how tiny.

And I think that's already the plan.  1.2 will be released when the
symbology-ng & labeling stuff was merged.

Why don't we release another version *before* this? It is possible that
major merges will cause some instability, therefore pushing forward 1.2.
All the best.

Hi,

looking at the poll it seems that 1.0.x isn't *that* popular among
users. Majority of use the last version or even the bleeding edge
compiled from source (although the poll is biased towards unstable
versions thanks to our testers).

My biggest concern is about the naming: calling 1.x versions
"unstable" seems unfair to me. Any greater features are developed and
tested in branches and merged once they're ready. So the trunk is +-
stable and virtually ready for a release at any time. That's why I
would prefer to mark also 1.x releases "stable" or avoid
stable/unstable completely. Every 1.x release brings many new features
that make 1.0 look old :-)

There's also a matter of promotion: currently the QGIS home page
states just under the big logo there's version 1.0.2. But there's also
a newer version that many users probably just don't know about! And
sincerely, the "unstable" version doesn't sound like a choice for
production use. That's maybe also the reason why there are some people
prefering 1.0.x releases.

That's my opinion too. And if there are companies/organizations which
really need to have a version with long term support, they should
take care of backporting the fixes from the trunk. For a decent
backport, it's really necessary to also compile and test it, not just
commit the backport - waste of our time.

Recently I've been wondering what will be the best time for new
release (1.2). In about two weeks we're going to finish the
qgis-mapper project and there are some more functionality besides new
symbology and labeling I'd like to put into trunk: most importantly
OpenStreetMap provider+plugin, topology checking plugin and vector
features caching. But that's probably too much for one release... So
one possibility would be to release 1.2 with just some of the features
and get the rest into 1.3. Opinions?

the advertisement in the banner below the logo should switch at any click, but

Yes developing in branches helps keeps trunk more or less release
ready but introducing new features inevitably will introduce new bugs
/ crash points. Although we have tried to introduce a culture of unit
testing, this as not reallly taken hold, and that means we put the
burden of testing and finding those bugs and crash points on our
users. If we are going to do that it seems to me only fair that we
indicate this with the 'unstable' moniker. There is a good quote that
says 'software without unit tests is broken by design'....

I've been swamped with (non qgis :-( ) work the last few months, but I
plan to go throught the commits since 1.1 was released and backport
what is possible.

If all the new features are ready, I'd vote to introduce them all in
the 1.2 release. If Martin prefers, we can do a release of 1.2 now as
suggested above and then merge in his new stuff and do a 1.3 release
in the not too distant future....

Does it make 1.0.x broken by design too? I'm pretty
sure that "reliable" industry giants like ArcGIS should have unstable in their titles too, they
crush all the time. I don't think this is unfair to remove unstable
and have a "this software may/does contain bugs, use at your own risk"
mantra all over the website and qgis itself. This is reality, whatever
we call it.

I'm also sorry for the failure of creation of unit tests for qgis. I'd
be glad to discuss it on the hackfest in Vienna. There are some
possibilities for improvement. Main reason I see is that it's hard to
motivate anyone to create unit tests for older code which just works
(tm) or mostly seems to work...

I still think that stating a product is "unstable" makes bad marketing
impression. This would mean that any project should release their new
versions as unstable. Moreover I feel that our stable and unstable
releases are pretty equal when it comes to stability.

> There is a good quote that

Well, that's maybe too tough :-)
Anyway, the good news is that symbology-ng includes a set of unit tests!

I'll leave that decision on you, Tim :-)
Basically the plugins shouldn't do any harm to application itself. The
only risky thing would be the patch for caching of vector features -
it gives a boost to the vector rendering speed in expense of some
memory.
Regarding labeling - I'm not sure whether to release it as a
standalone (c++) plugin and only later put it into core library - or
put it directly to the core library. Anyway we have to keep the old
labeling code due the api stability and just allow the user to switch
between the old/new implementation - the same will apply for the
symbology.

Hi all

Wow, I'm looking forward to these nice features!

Regarding release, I'd prefer a defensive approach (that is adding the new features after 1.2).
Else, if you think we should release 1.2 with new symbology / labelling / vector caching, please make sure there is enough time between feature freeze and release.

Regards,
Marco

+1 for me: let's release 1.2 real soon (ideally after squashing or
closing [several of them are probably invalid] the remaining 17 critical
bugs
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=critical%3A+causes+crash+or+data+corruption&order=priority
; if nobody is going to work on this now, better release as it is) and
wait for the merge, do some testing and release a 1.3 as soon as we
agree the new version is not *more unstable* than the previous one.
All the best.

Done - thanks Tim for allowing me to do so.
I would also like to change the component list: the current situation is
sometimes ambiguous. The ideal would be to have a classification system
both user friendly (easy to decide which category the bug belongs to)
and developer friendly (easy to check just the bugs in their respective
areas of interest).
A few possible changes:
- recombine "Plugins" and Python" into "C++ plugins" and "Python plugins"
- combine Translations and Internationalisation
- combine Graphics, Symbology and Marker Symbols
- drop SPIT
- include MapServer export into Python plugins

The current category list is:

 	Build/Install  	  	
	Data Provider 	 	
	Digitising 	 	
	Documentation and Help 	 	
	Graphics 	 	
	GRASS 	 	
	GUI 	 	
	Internationalisation 	
	MapCanvas 	
	Map Legend 	
	MapServer export 	
	Marker Symbols 	
	OGR Layer support 	
	Plugins 	
	Printing 	
	Projection Support 	
	Project Loading / Saving 	
	Python 	
	Rasters 	
	SPIT 	
	Symbology 	
	Translations 	
	Vectors 	
	WMS

Comments and other suggestions welcome. It would be great if some
developer would accept to become owner of one or more category.
Furthermore, I'm going to set some more default reports for specific
purposes (eg OSX bugs, etc. - again, suggestions welcome).
All the best.

Note that in proj 4.6 it is not more assumed +towgs84=0,0,0 by default,
so that it would result anyway in a wrong datum if +datum or +towgs84
is not explicitly set.

before dropping SPIT should we wait to Postgis Manager become a core

Hi all,

do you have any idea how should be the right behavior for the situation
described in the following ticket?

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/926

basically if you have two polygons that overlaps completely and you
select (with the select tool) the outer one, then the selection is ok.
If you select the inner one then both are selected. 

Using the attribute table you can select just the inner or the outer one
by selecting the relative row.

Ideas?

I meant, dropping the category; it should go under C++ plugins.
Thanks for comments.

if two polygons overlap, than the described behaviour is fine.

However, there is something else. I think this ticket is not only about overlapping polygons,
but also polygon and an island (outer and inner). I think in this case, clicking on outer and
inner should lead to the selection or identification of only one polygon.

The reason for wrong behavior might be, that the MBR are used instead of actual polygons,
so clicking on the inner one lead to selection/id of the outer one
also.

Hi all.
I am managing the trac, and I discovered that in the workflow currently
implemented apparently there is no way of changing a component without
assigning it to an owner:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/admin/ticket/components
This is understandable (maybe even good :) ), but against our current
usage. Would it be possible to change this behaviour?
All the best.

checked in QGIS, it's working as expected in this case, the only
minor comment is that red outline of the polygon with the hole cover
all the polygon, though I think it should exclude the hole and follow
it by outline.

But the download figures[1] look much different.   There the 1.0 version does
seem to have a much larger userbase than the later versions...

So we might be wrong after all.

Hi all,

I don't know if you can rely on download figures at all. People can 
repeatedly install from one download. Other people install the svn 
version (which I assume you don't see in the download statistics). Also, 
there are downloads at other places (Linux packages, OSGeo, etc.) Then 
even if people download the 1.0 version a lot you still don't know if 
they actually use it, or just try it out and don't use it.

I still think that the 1.0 version is way too limited to do serious GIS 
work and would suggest that the QGIS team concentrates on the 1.1 and 
1.2 releases as stated by others. As other people stated, the 1.0 
release is not more stable than the unstable version (this is my 
experience as well). I think QGIS is great and evolving quickly, but it 
still has a lot to catch up compared to commercial GIS that has been 
developed for 10-20 years already. For this reason I'd say release often 
at the current stage - at least 1-2 times per year and then move to 
longer release cycles once QGIS matures.

One of the big advantages QGIS currently has, is that I (as a 
user/customer) can get in new features relatively quickly (compared to 
commercial GIS). QGIS should use this advantage and release often.

Just my opion.

Thanks,
Andreas

Can incorrect behaviour of the outline while identifying
indicate some more problems? Though selection works fine. This ticket
can definitely be closed, but new one should be created for the
described effect.

Message-ID: <633be2250907172045v7611440cvc2c7fb9348f2d80a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having a problem that I am hoping someone can help me with.  I have a
piece of code that iterates through a feature class and pulls out the x and
y coordinates from the geometry.  The z values are stored in the attribute
table and I would also like to pull that value for each feature.  I have
looked at Tutorial 6, but it looks like the classes have changed since it
was written, I think.  I can see that feature.attributeMap() returns a
dictionary of Key-Value pairs (I think) but I can't figure out how to get
the "Elevation" field attribute value from that.  Here is the piece of code:

 while (mypVectorLayer->nextFeature(currentFeature))

{

//get geometry of the feature

QgsGeometry* currentGeometry = currentFeature.geometry();

QgsPoint currentPoint = currentGeometry->asPoint();


 //get the attributes of this feature

const QgsAttributeMap& myAttributes = currentFeature.attributeMap();


 //get the value from the "Elevation" field

double zval = //value from field



//add point coordinates to point and add point to dt

 Point pt = Point(currentPoint.x(), currentPoint.y(), zval);

dt.insert(pt);

//delete currentFeature;

}


Thanks,


Matt

Hi Matthew

You need to first find out what index the attribute with name 'Elevation' has. QgsAttributeMap uses that index number, not the field name. 
You may find out the index of a field name by using the function fieldNameIndex of QgsVectorDataProvider

int fieldNameIndex(const QString& fieldName)

But that gives you only the commited fields. If you also want to consider the not-commited fields, you could work with QgsVectorLayer::pendingFields

Then, once you have the index, query the value of QgsAttributeMap for this index. QgsAttribute Map is a map (or a dict in python) with key int (the index) and QVariant value (the attribute value).

Regards,
Marco

Agreed fully. I think we cannot trust download stats at all, as many
(most?) people download qgis from OSGeo or their distro sites.
Furthermore, the prominent notice on our web site "1.0.2 is the only
good one" pushes hard downloaders towards that version.
Incidentally, I must say that having people using 1.0.2 makes also
people reporting old bugs as new ones, which makes keeping the bug queue
clean more difficult.
I repeat mysel, but I think that deprecating 1.0.2 and releasing 1.2 now
is the way to go. Please note that we only have 9 critical bugs open
now, the lowest number since ages.
All the best.

Actually they should be just 7, as Marco will apply a patch for one
after his holidays and another one will be closed as seems to be not
reproducible (still testing).

Hi!

I also fully agree - we should bring out 1.2 soon and probably drop 1.0.
But the (most asked) thing is that we should have a fully working
stand alone installer for windows.

Not that I like Windows (I only _have_ to use it @work) but it is
still a fact that most people unfortunately are just able to click
"Setup.exe"
Dont' get me wrong - I like those people .. They are our Users ;) (and
they give me work by cleaning their Computer)

So I still vote for getting 1.2 out soon but .. to get really more
users to use it - we need Setup.exe ;)

regards
Werner

Hi all.
I cannot change the owner of a ticket, even though I am trac admin. This
is quite inconvenient: anybody can fix this?
Thanks.

Hi all.
What is the difference between a bug and a defect? I'm claening up the
bugs qeue, and I found the difference rather blurred.
Less ambiguity makes life easier for both reporters and debuggers.
All the best.

+1

Seems really unnecessary to have the "defect" category.

 A bug makes you want to bug the developers. A defect makes you want
to defect to gvSIG :)

Hi all,

while editing if I use identify tool on a feature, it pops up a dialog
that allows to edit values.

Though I like the idea, I'd vote for keeping identify tool working
the same way regardless whether I am in the editing mode or not. I'd
suggest making a separate tool for doing what Identify tool is doing right now in
editing mode.

Is it a bug or a feature? QGIS 1.2-trunk.

That feature is about a year old (r9092).

Marco,

Thanks for the direction, I got it working.  As it turns out I had tried
something close to the correct way at one point but was making it harder
than it it is.

Thanks again,

Hi All

I'm not in agreement with ditching 1.0.x. The stats we looked at
(including OSGEO downloads) for the win setup.exe's that I made for
1.0.2 and 1.1 and made available at exactly  the same time had many
many more downloads for the stable release (~75k for ver 1.0.2 versus
~4.7k downloads for 1.1). True we cant see how many downloads were
made on other distros, third party redistribution etc,  but if the
figures lay the other way around wouldnt you be using them as an
argument for deprecating 1.0.x?

I would like to make the additional point that many users using the
1.0.x releases are probably silent on this list, the forums etc - this
discussion is biased towards developers who typically enjoy being on
the bleeding edge.

Surely it does not impact on any of you if 1.0.x continues to exist
and the users who are looking for a long term maintained version will
appreciate our commitment to not only making new versions, but also
providing a slow moving target for them to work against.

That said I suspect this thread will go on ad-infinitum since so would
like to suggest that we do the following:

- Promote the 1.x releases on the download pages etc
- Keep the 1.0.x description and down load page there (in a less
prominant position).
- Do occasional 1.0.x releases  - I will backport any commits I can to
the 1.0.x branch and make occasional releases
- Release 1.2 with the current feature set as Marco and others have suggested
- Incorporate Martins NG and Labelling stuff into the future 1.3 release
- Lets work to get some kind of proper metrics in place - an opt in
first-run wizard that is invoked each time a user uses QGIS + unique
version that pings a server with OS + Version. I will do the server
side stuff if someone else can pitch in with the QGIS part.



Regards

Tim

I agree with Tim and will point out that in my experience 1.0.x is still
more stable. Most of my colleagues that I see on a daily basis still run
it, and I still have a copy installed on 1 machine at all times because
the upgrade path has not appeared clear and tested, nor did it work when
1.1 first came out. Previous upgrade attempts on both Ubuntu and Windows
are really untested and don't go that well. (GRASS-GDAL plugin always
seems to break)

For this upcoming school year I plan to request 1.0.x be installed on
our lab machines (40+) since I know the functions we need are working. I
can likely request minor updates but the lab managers aren't keen to big
jumps in versions every 3 months, since there's lots of other software
they have to play nice with. So +1 on getting the exe installers working
better out of the box (I'm experimenting with msys builds to see if that
helps)

I think one thing we need to start focusing on more is testing, like
before 2.0 we need to test that an upgrade to 2.0 can be done from 1.0
with OSGeo4w and on Ubuntu, the dependencies on GDAL and GRASS seem to
make these unstable.

I'm also interested in getting more discussion going about automated
testing to find bugs before release.

Thanks,
Alex

If someone can review them, and finds them ok, why not allowing him to

Subject: [Qgis-developer] load layer style failed - possible bug?
Message-ID: <31f1d37d0907200109g7d041f86j91b6a57a3ad27d37@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm working on MacOs X and writing a little plugin in python that load
layer with .qml style.If the .qml file It's into HD directory, I haven't
problems, but If I put the qml file into ./qgis/python/plugins/myplugindir/
Qgis cannot read the file. So, it's impossible writin a python plugin with
.qml files contained into the plugin.

Some suggestions??

How are you trying to load the qml?   Loading with
QgsMapLayer::loadNamedStyle() should work with any path.

If you want to have QGIS automatically loaded the qml when you load the layer
the qml needs to reside in the same directory and have the same name as the
vector data source.

Hi all.
In my installation of qgis, the manual does not seem to work:

g.manual -i
Starting browser <> for module index...
/usr/lib/grass64/scripts/g.manual: line 79: : command not found

Anyone is more successful?
Should I open a bug?
All the best.

I have 2 layers into postgres/postgis DB. The problem appears only into
/.qgis directory.
This is a piece of code:

if  layerUS.isValid() == True and layerCA.isValid() == True:
USLayerId = layerUS.getLayerID()
CALayerId = layerCA.getLayerID()
layerUS.loadNamedStyle('/Users/.qgis/python/plugins/pyarchinitus/modules/gis/styles/previewUSstyle.qml')
layerCA.loadNamedStyle('/Users/.qgis/python/plugins/pyarchinitus/modules/gis/styles/previewCAstyle.qml')
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layerUS, False)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layerCA, False)
layerToSet = [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(layerCA, True, False),
QgsMapCanvasLayer(layerUS, True, False) ]
elif layerUS.isValid() == True and layerCA.isValid() == False:
CALayerId = None
USLayerId = layerUS.getLayerID()
layerUS.loadNamedStyle('/Users/.qgis/python/plugins/pyarchinitus/modules/gis/styles/previewUSstyle.qml')
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layerUS, False)
layerToSet = [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(layerUS, True, False) ]
elif layerUS.isValid() == False and layerCA.isValid() == True:
USLayerId = None
CALayerId = layerCA.getLayerID()
layerCA.loadNamedStyle('/Users/.qgis/python/plugins/pyarchinitus/modules/gis/styles/previewCAstyle.qml')
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layerCA, False)
layerToSet = [ QgsMapCanvasLayer(layerCA, True, False) ]
elif layerUS.isValid() == False and layerCA.isValid() == False:
USLayerId = None
CALayerId = None

Does that return anything helpful (should be an empty string on success or an

But that's the right directory?  You're not missing the username, do you?

Seems unrelated to QGIS.  Looks like your qwt bindings don't match your qwt
libraries.

Is it on Qt4.5? Seems like PyQt4 doesn't work smoothly with Qt4.5 yet...

upgraded to python-qwt5-qt4 (5.1.1~cvs20090626+dfsg-2) as per debian
unstable, and recopiled qgis: now it segfaults on startup, nice result. ;)
Probably python-qwt5-qt4 and libqwt5-qt4 (5.2.0-1) are not aligned in
Debian.
Thanks.

even reverting to an earlier version and recompiling now I cannot start
qgis (even removing pyplugins). It crashes on "Starting python".
Removing all qwt5 stuff does not help, nor recompiling afterwards, so
I'm basicaly stuck: any suggestion?
All the best.

Recompiling itself qgis shouldn't change a thing.  qgis doesn't know anything
about qwt.  The upgrade was probably enough.

Hm, doesn't even seem to be a (generic) debian problem.  profiletool loads fine

Hi all.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS creating defective shape-files?
Message-ID: <4A66BD5B.60406@fossgis.de>

Hi,

I'm having a weird problem with some shape-files. May be it's a QGIS- or
a ArcGIS Bug:
I'm managing a lineshape exported from an ArcGIS geodatabase into a
lineshape. Extracts (also done with ArcGIS) are edited in QGIS (by the
way: the editors find it much more comfortable to use QGIS for that. I
just have to use ArcGIS for extensive Topology testing). We are using
QGIS 1.2.0 unstable (Codestand 10965M on Windoof), because of some fixed
Bugs from earlier versions that hit us.
The problem is:
The shapes seem to be without any problem using QGIS, but when I add it
to ArcMap some Lines disapear at a specific Zoomlevel.
The problem disapears by exporting the shape from ArcMap into a new shape.
I'm not sure how to find the "guilty party" (well, I know who is the
guilty one in general). Is it QGIS creating dirty shapes? Or is it just
a Bug in ArcGIS? Honestly it's quite hard to get any support from ESRI.
Does anybody who is just in the Code able to say, if it could be QGIS or
ArcGIS doing something wrong?

Why are you on 4.5.1 and I'm on 4.5.2?  BTW the real packages are called
libqtcore4 and libqtgui4.

because you're on unstable, and I'm on testing :)
now I upgraded all, but I still have the error:

Marco,

I am not a developer, but I use both QGIS and ArcGIS on a regular basis and
I have experienced the behavior that you described in ArcGIS a number of
times with shapefiles that have never been "touched" by QGIS.  I haven't
been able to pin down a pattern of when it happens, but I suspect it is an
ESRI problem.

Regards,

Matt

I have been told several times by ESRI users that sometimes they have shp that
do not open in Arc*, so they open it in qgis, save it again, and reopen in Arc*,
whithout an error.
Being non-topological, shapefiles are inherently fragile objects in my view.
All the best.

So it seems a pyQwt5 etc problem after all:

This sounds like a corrupted spatial index file. Can we have a look at
the shapefile that doesn't work well in ArcGIS?

SpatiaLite or not, shapefiles _should_ work correctly everywhere. Otherwise you're cutting out lots
of users.

For the records: upgrading to debian unstable solved both compilation and
startup problems (thus, I guess it was all due to misaligned libraries).
I still have the

  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.5/PyQt4/Qwt5/__init__.py", line 32, in
    from Qwt import *
ImportError: /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.5/PyQt4/Qwt5/Qwt.so: undefined symbol:
_ZN13QwtLegendItem17setIdentfierWidthEi

for the two plugins, but this is a minor issue now for me.
All the best, thanks for helping me to understand, and sorry for the noise.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Specifying file encoding for vector files
Message-ID: <4A675C6E.6000406@homann.se>

Background:
Recently jef made some work on making project files shareable between OS:es by allowing
data sets to be specified with a reltive path in the project files. Thankful, I started
testing this with my Ubuntu and WinXP boxes, having files on a network drive.

However, opening vector files weren't as easy as I thought, the files were found but the encoding
was wrong.

Problem:
In the project file, each vector data sets have an encoding specified (e.g 'UTF-8', UTF-16', BIG5').
This encoding is specified when adding the layer to the project, and can't be changed.
Unfortunately, the default encoding when adding layers is taken from QTexCodec::codecForLocale()
and on BOTH Ubuntu and WinXP this defaults to "System". A bad name, becasue the system encoding
are infact different on different OS:es...

So, when users happily adding "System" encoded vectors on Ubuntu (i.e. UTF-8) it works flawlessly.
But when the project file is saved, and opened on WinXP the vectors are still opened with the "System"
encoding, which is not identical and the vectors are not properly read!

Unfortunately, there is no way to go from the "System" encoding to a universally recognizable name.

Current situation:
When creating a new layer, the default encoding is taken from last used encdoing.
When saving the layer as shapefile, the default encoding is UTF-8.
When adding a new layer, the default encoding is System.

Solution:
Instead of defaulting to "System", we should have another decoding set as default when the user is
prompted, and there are two solutions as I see it:

1) Go with the last used encoding everywhere.
2) Let the user specify a project wide default encoding which is used everywhere.

Ladies and gentlemen, let the voting begin!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch to add sld support for wms layers in qgis
Message-ID: <COL103-W29E0B1128ED0B6668EDDAFB21B0@phx.gbl>


Hi:

 

I just uploaded a patch to add style layer descriptor support for wms layers in qgis. The patch includes the following:

 

Support for style layer descriptor url.

Support for style layer descriptor inline. (sld_body parameter in wms).

Changes to add layer from a server dialog to allow to write an sld url and a sld body.

Changes to save and read the sld url and sld body in qgis project.

Added a new tab in wms layer properties dialog named sld to allow change sld url and sld body.

 

The patch is located in qgis trac https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1167, the patch also fixed partially

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1726

 

I did some simple tests with geoserver and mapserver wms.

 

Any feedback and comments are welcome.

 

 

Regards

 

Godofredo Contreras

to contact me. May it be helpful to increase the quality of QGIS.

Marco,

I looked the shapefile that you've provided. As I said, the problem
with some objects missing on certain scales is related to spatial index. If you remove
*.sbn and *.sbx files (you can do it safely, this doesn't modify the
data) and reload shapefile in ArcGIS, the problem seems to go away.

Now some thoughts/discussion points:

1. The fact that QGIS is showing everything correctly probably means
that it is simply ignoring spatial index (sbn,sbx) of the
shapefile, is this so? If so, I'm not sure if this is correct
strategy, use of this index might help to work with larger datasets.
As I can see, QGIS is creating its own index (qix), it might mean that
ESRI spatial index format is not open/effective?

3. And related, if the shapefile is loaded in QGIS (1.1) seems like it is
locked and cannot be loaded in ArcGIS _at all_, ArcGIS complains that
there is an error in the shapefile. Again, I'm not sure if this is the
correct behavior, locking on editing is good, locking on viewing,
hmm...

QTreeWidget::headerHidden() was added in Qt 4.4.  Looks like you're using an
earlier version.   Try r11163.

Hi

Since the major discussions about what goes into the release, what we
call it and how we promote it seem to be behind us, I would like to
press on with the next release. Is everyone agreeable if we aim for an
end-of-August release? The timeline would go something like:

1 August - 1.2 Feature Freeze - bug fixing only from now on
14 August - String freeze and call for translation updates
21 August - tag for release and call for packaging
End of August - release announcement

Sound ok? I'll put a new release checklist up shortly.

Regards

Maxim / Marco, etc,

I would note that there is already a GDAL ticket on the need to delete the
.sbn/.sbx and/or .qix files if the underlying shapefile is changed.

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/2798

This is on Chaitanya's todo list.

Sounds good, provided it does not interfere with Martin extensive changes - if
so, I would opt for a slightly earlier schedule for feature freeze.
BTW: only a few critical bugs are left
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&priority=critical%3A+causes+crash+or+data+corruption&order=priority
and some of them are probably invalid. Would it be feasible to fix all of them
before release? From our side, I think we can fix
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1712
Thanks.

Hi all.
Running the eVis tutorial
http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/index.php?section_id=116
goes smoothly, but when I try to run a query (either by hand or with a preset
query from xml), I get a popup with layer name, x and y (I add a name, select x
and y fields), then:

The layer is not a valid layer and can not be added to the map

The connection seems to be ok:
New Database connection requested...
Connection to [./home/paolo/Desktop/eVis_tutorial/PhotoPoints.db] established
Tables:
->Points
->Attributes

Any explanation? QGIS from trunk on debian unstable.
All the best.

So I tried a new project with fewer raster layers and now I can print.
Does anyone know how to determine the maximum number of layers I can
use on my system? BTW I was using the large project file with  a code
revision from June without this crash.

Hi Otto, list,

the problem is fixed in r209 on SVN repository - will come soon also on
Faunalia's 3rd party repository. Updated version of the plugin is
2.0.2. 
This is actually a patch, the module needs substantial cleanup.
I tested it on Debian Squeeze, Python 2.5.4, python-rpy2 2.0.4a-1. Hope
it works also on Opensuse.

best regards, 

Anne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass modules
Message-ID: <4A69A0D7.7020207@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Some grass modules seem redundant, with caveats:
- v.out.ogr.gml and the generic v.out.ogr

The generic one does not seem to work for GML:
v.out.ogr input=test@user1 type=area layer=1 format=GML dsn=/home/paolo/Desktop
olayer=prova2 -e -c
ERROR 4: Failed to create GML file /home/paolo/Desktop.
?Unable to open OGR data source '/home/paolo/Desktop'

whereas v.out.ogr.gml works, apparently because it allows to define the layer name

- v.out.ogr.mapinfo and the generic v.out.ogr
I think the generic one is more than enough for mapinfo; I suggest to remove the
specific one (that has also a wrong description)

- r.out.gdal.gtiff and v.out.ogr
the only difference is that the gtiff module automatically writes the file
extension (.tif), whereas the generic one writes a file without extension, which
can e confusing and annoying. I would suggest to remove the specific one if the
generic can cope with this.
All the best.

Martins changes are in a branch - he will marge it in to trunk (==
eventual qgis 1.3) after the release of 1.2.

Hi,
I understand (I already knew what was the difference), but that wasn't
my point.

GRASS "layers" in a GRASS "vector map" have *common geometry*. You can't
edit the geometry of one GRASS "layer" not interfering with the
geometry of the other "layer" in a single "vector map".

This is different than in case of e.g. shapefiles, where each layer is a
set of files dedicated only to a particular layer, thus when you edit
it, you do so only for this particular layer.

GRASS "layers" and OGR "layers" are different things.

Paolo,

It has been fixed in r11184. eVis actually just uses the delimited text 
provider ( needs to be updated to use a different provider someday ) and 
there was a problem with the uri format that was introduced when 
preparing for migration to the QGIS trunk.

let me know if you have any other problems.

ok, now it works - the only problem is that the path stored in the sqlite db is
a windows one. Perhaps it would be good to have two versions of the tutorial
(ie, of the xml query and the db)?

Yeah, my question was much more trivial.

Take an ogr layer, say a shapefile, and add it to the map. Then add a
grass vector layer. Un-check both in the legend then toggle editing for
both: the shapefile nodes won't shown in the map canvas while the grass
vector ones will do.

I just asked if this difference has a purpose or not. If not, I guess
that the two situation must behave the same way.

Cheers

Paolo,

The tutorial and sample data you are using ( on 
http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/index.php?section_id=116 ) was 
specifically written for a workshop for windows users and for a much 
older version of eVis and it has not been updated since.

the main documentation ( 
http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/evis/documentation.php 
)provides more generic and the most up to date information, but not a 
step by step style tutorial.

Ironically I was just talking this morning with our folks about this 
very issue as it relates to a couple of our other resources as well.

This also raises another question about what documentation folks need 
when a plugin is submitted for inclusion into the trunk.

Hi Pete.
Thanks for your reply. I found the tutorial very clear and useful. Please note
that the main doc has to be updated, in particular for what concerns the
installation, eg the link:

Download the eVis plugin from the CBC Biodiversity Informatics Facility website:
http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/evis/download.php

is correctly broken, and in general the install instructions are no longer
necessary.
All the best, and thanks again.

Hi all,

with the new v.out.ogr and the new r.out.gdal you can export to all 
formats supported by GDAL/OGR library (GML and other formats with the 
same problem) but you have to specify the right extension in the output 
file name. Of course I can specify this in the module.

The alternative is to create a modules for every format supported by 
GDAL/OGR with an increase of the modules in the GRASS tools menu.

Any advices for the other developers?

Thank you very much
Leonardo

Hi Tim,

I think Paolo has in mind some other goodies we've developed in the
qgis-mapper team. I think I'll finally commit only OpenStreetMap
provider and plugin before the feature freeze and the rest of the
developments will be included some time later.

Message-ID: <4A709992.8050805@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think not having a roadmap and a timeline can confuse both users and
packagers. How about establishing a plan for two major releases per year (plus
eventual minor, bugfix releases), with a fixed (with some flexibility of course)
calendar?
Something like:

- 1 August 2009 - 1.2 feature freeze
- 14 August - string freeze and call for translation updates
- 21 August - tag for release and call for packaging
- 31 August - release announcement

- eventual releases of minor versions (bugfix) when needed

- 1 February 2010 - 1.3 feature freeze
- 14 February - string freeze and call for translation updates
- 21 February - tag for release and call for packaging
- 31 February - release announcement

And so on. Just take it as an example - any different arrangement of dates would
be ok for me, I'm mainly interested in checking whether a similar schedule is
feasible, and if it makes sense.
All the best.

In my opinion could be a good thing to release new qgis versions in fixed 
dates, for example, every 6 months. 
This should permit us to write a feature plan with some middle milestones.
What do you think about?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Various OSGeo4W updates
Message-ID: <20090730072731.GA3083@norbit.de>

Hi there,

over the last few days I made several changes to OSGeo4W, that I would like to
keep you posted about:

1. I updated the QGIS dependencies Qt, SIP, PyQt4, PyQwt5 and GRASS including
the GDAL plugin.  After that qgis, qgis1.1 and qgis-dev were rebuild using
those.  I also switched to GDAL 1.6 in the process.

The scripts used to build the GRASS package (including patches to the GDAL
GRASS plugins) are at [1].

2. The nightly build of qgis trunk, that I used to upload to our website, was
also moved to OSGeo4W. qgis-dev is now the nightly build.

The packaging scripts are in the qgis repository[2].

The build is done at 1am CEST and uploaded to upload.osgeo.org (about 4pm PDT
there).  After the upload osgeo4w-regen.sh and osgeo4w-promote.sh are called to
update the setup.inis for the installer.

So be aware that, if you're uploading test packages to OSGeo4W in that window,
they might show up in setup.ini earlier than you intended them to.


3. The installer was also improved a bit.  The existing russian and ukrainian
translation and a new german translation are now integrated into the main
executable, so there is no need for multiple setups anymore.

The express installation targets now include GRASS and the QGIS express target
was changed from qgis to qgis-full.  The latter is a pseudo package that
installs qgis (1.0) including optional dependencies that enable Python support,
the GRASS plugin and some additional python packages that are used by popular
qgis python plugins.   See [3+4].

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0907300422o2a34298chbb6575553ca941b6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just added OpenStreetMap provider and plugin into SVN trunk
(r11210). It has been developed by Lukas Berka as a part of the
qgis-mapper project.

Main features:
- open OpenStreetMap (.osm) files and browse them in QGIS
- inspect OSM objects
- download OSM data from server
- edit OSM objects: add / modify / delete
- editation history (undo/redo)
- upload changes to server
- Import layers into OSM

For more information, check out the user guide:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/osmplugin_user_guide_draft.pdf
Please note this is a rough draft.

There's no need for special installation actions, just compile and install.

Please test and enjoy :-)

Martin

Hi Giovanni,

it should be fixed in r11215.

Martin,

I'm adding this to the OSX Xcode build, and noticed a few problems  
that might affect the cmake build also, for the provider:

- none of the headers have any moc classes:

   Warning: No relevant classes found. No output generated.

- needs the GEOS headers path

- needs the qgis core/renderer header path

- needs to link QtGui for QImage

- needs to link SQLite library

those are really nice news and will make both beginners and advanced
user's life easier. Nice to see that our translation efforts didn't go
unnoticed.

For some reason, I can't find new osgeo4w-setup.exe anywhere, seems like the version on
the main page is still the old one. Multiligual version was not uploaded yet?

Anyway, thanks for your work J?rgen.

JEF> Hi there,

Strange.  The new version was already uploaded.  Frank just verified that he
gets the UI in English, while mine is in German.  So that seems to work fine.
Perhaps a proxy issue on your end?

Hello Developers,


I am working on a little application using QGIS and am having trouble using

problem...not sure.


Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Hi Matt

currentGeometry2 is a pointer, so you need to use '->' instead of '.' to call a function.

if(currentGeometry2->contains(currentPoint))

should solve the problem.
Btw, what kind of program do you write? 'delaunay_intersect' sounds interesting...

Regards,
Marco

I also like this idea but we've tried it before and had problems. Since
we rely on people to work on stuff in their free time its very hard to
impose deadlines on anybody. The current system we have works very well
- - where we leave some time for open commits, send out a 'ok to release?'
email, and if everyone is happy plan a release schedule over the course
of the next month.

Perhaps things will be different now that we have a codebase that is
more stabilised and we are working in branches, so I am game to try
again since I would also like to see:

- - a yearly stable release that will have maintenance updates
- - several unstable releases for those who want to have the latest &
greatest


regards

Message-ID: <4A72C15A.8070709@gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm getting a weird behaviour with "zoom to point", I get
an exaggerated zoom no matter what you set, anybody else is
finding the same problem? (qgis 1.1.0 Pan unstable on
ubuntu 9.04)

Also, would it be possible to get that point marked with a circle
or something so that you can fine tune the zoom and pan, and even
get the point saved to a points vector layer?

Thanks

Not big deal, but in the field would be better moving the cursor
to the approximate place and then zoom and get automatic re-centering.

In the field, it's better to avoid the mouse (actually, there is often 
no mouse
but the hateful pad, cannot believe that hardware engineers have not come
with something better than such an uncomfortable and anti-ergonomic system!)
or just use it for rough positioning. A way to move the cursor (not to 
pan) with
the keyboard (i.e. Ctrl+->) would be handy also, perhaps displaying a 
cross-hair.

Maybe we could define different sets of keyboard shortcuts and make sort 
of "for in the field"
mode and "for in the office" mode.

Hi Agustin, 

maybe a good idea would be to add an enhancement ticket to the bug tracker with
a short list of your ideas and wishes. Otherwise it will probably be forgotten
in a few days.

Marco,

Thanks so much for your reply.  I am not at my machine right now so I can't
try it.

The program I am writing calculates the intersection of two triangulated
surfaces.  Right now it only takes point shapefiles as input for both
surfaces.  A deluaney triangulation is constructed from the point files and
the intersection in 3d space is calculated.  The program works but needs a
lot of refinement at this point.  The code I asked you for help on adds
points to the triangulation, and I am trying to limit the triangulation to a
mask to reduce coputation time of the intersection routine.

When I get this working better I am planning to release it GPL (or whatever
license is appropriate).  Maybe as a plugin to qgis.

Thanks again for your help.

Matt

Hi Matt

currentGeometry2 is a pointer, so you need to use '->' instead of '.' to
call a function.

if(currentGeometry2->contains(currentPoint))

should solve the problem.
Btw, what kind of program do you write? 'delaunay_intersect' sounds
interesting...

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dynamic Stylesheet
Message-ID: <7a2e550c3f8b3087cb53c608c070fbcf@127.0.0.1>

Hey List,

I have numerous zoning and road layers that have similar field
classifications but not exactly the same.

For example, a zoning layer has a general classification structure similar
to:
- R-*		// Residential
- C-*		// Commercial
- RM-*		// Residential-Mixed
- I-*		// Industrial
- etc ...

Different municipalities have different sub zone policies, so a small town
would have R-1 to R-15, whereas a small village would have R-1 to R-5 for
example. The key is that they all start with the same letter or two.

Each zone has a different standard color: R (orange), C (Grey), I (dark
grey) for example, where the subzones are painted with different shades of
that root color.

Saving and reloading a style file does not work when the number of classes
of the style file is different from the layer. 

Q-1: So, I was wondering, is there a way to write a stylesheet, that
automagically assigns all residential areas different shades of orange,
commercial different shades with blue, etc??

Q-2: Is there a way to write a plugin for it? I searched the API Docs
(http://doc.qgis.org/head/search.php?query=symbology) and I?m not sure if
any of these functions would help me achieve what I want.

Q-3: Since we?re talking stylesheets, is there a way to change the
default green to blue subclassing to colors I specify as default?

Cheers,
dassouki

Yes, it can never be released... :( 31 February is good for me, but what about 
setting more feasible date?  :)

Hi dassouki.
Whoever you are, please stop flooding the trac. Many (most?) of the ticket you
opened are invalid, duplicates or so generic that they cannot be replicated,
thus are impossible to fix. This causes noise, and make us waste time.
Check carefully before opening a ticket, this *has* a cost for the project.
Thanks.

Sorry about "whoever you are",

Please proceed to closing my account and my tickets.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] weird behavior of "zoom to point"
In-Reply-To: <4A72C15A.8070709@gmail.com>
References: <4A72C15A.8070709@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <e32d76a10907310846h1f4651f3wedf4090b7066480@mail.gmail.com>

I think the exaggerated zoom depends on what scale are your data.

Maybe the scale factor could be a relative factor with the canvas fullExtent
as base extent.

Something like this can be useful (zoomtopoint.py file, run() method):

    mc=self.iface.mapCanvas()
    extent = mc.fullExtent()
    xmin = float(x) - extent.width() / ( 2 * ( 100-scale ) )
    xmax = float(x) + extent.width() / ( 2* ( 100-scale ) )
    ymin = float(y) - extent.height() / (2 * ( 100-scale ) )
    ymax = float(y) + extent.height() / ( 2 *( 100-scale ) )
    rect = QgsRectangle( xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax )
    mc.setExtent(rect)

x, y are the point coordinates to center
scale is the factor (1 to detailed scale, 99 to general scale)

I tested and works fine.

Germ?n.
