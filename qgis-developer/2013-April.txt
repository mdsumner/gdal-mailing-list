The plugin produces a complete mapfile, not only styles.
All the best.

I should have added that there are a number of pull requests pending
evaluation [1], I would like to suggest that
we allow any pull request to be applied over the next two weeks where
the pull request id < 493 (i.e. when the pull request was already
lodged prior to the feature freeze).

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgQd-ALS93PYXv5yQnEFfrxrtDR7DvStWtc0RvzimS1fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I realise I missed the feature freeze by a couple of hours, but I'm
hoping an exception can be made for this pull request:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/493

Basically, this adds blending modes for composer items (in line with
the recent addition of blend modes for layers & labels). It also adds
a transparency slider for composer items which can be used to control
the opacity of the items.

It'd be a nice feature to have in 2.0 if an exception is possible!

Cheers,
Nyall

Ok I will go ahead and apply your changeset (I've tested it out here).

Nyall, those are really great additions.
When you have a minute, you should look at a blend modes issue I spotted
and described over here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7461

Will do... I was just trying to beat the feature freeze - now it's

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rating plugins: Only four stars?
Message-ID: <op.wuu6qgq8na7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

The current plugin voting seems a bit odd: On the overview page, e.g.  
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/most_voted/, the highest possible vote  
seems to be four stars.

On the actual plugin pages, it seems to be possible to give up to five  
stars.

My impression so far is that the overview page is wrong. Could you have a  
look?

Best wishes,
Anita

Its also a little odd that you can't sort by # votes so its a little hard to find the "Most voted" plugin.

For example, if you sort by "Stars (votes)", Sextante shows up in the middle of the list even though it has the most votes.

I wonder if the application name should also have "2" in it?  Otherwise, to get a side-by-side install of 1.8 and 2 you'd have to configure a different prefix.  Though I guess a different prefix would be best on linux to keep all the support files separate.  I could at least change the OS X app to "QGIS 2", since support files are by nature isolated for an app, then it could be placed in the standard /Applications folder alongside QGIS 1.8.  I don't know how an app is organized on Windows, if it needs a different install path or different app name.

I guess that may make sense on e.g. ubuntu where you want to have both
installed from packages into /usr.

Hi QGIS devs,

Do you think it is possible to get this UI improvement merged before 2.0?

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/494

Sorry if this type of change was required before the feature freeze, but I've been a little busy over the last few weeks. However I guess it is debatable if this is a feature or a UI change.

One other change that I would like to see in QGIS 2.0 is the ability for the WFS provider to implement the subsetString() method. This would allow users can change the layer attribute filter once the layer has been added map. I'm close to finishing testing on this, but it will take one or two more days to complete. Would it be possible to get this accepted post the feature freeze as well?

Thanks,
Jeremy

The Globe plugin is usable on Linux since a few months. I'm currently working

;-).
Marco and me did a lot of investigations on the Windows side. Our conclusion 
was, that a different compiler version must have been used for one of the 
dependent OSGEO4W packages, probably GDAL (globe uses C++ API).

Hi Pirmin,
this brings back to the vexata quaestio of improving the osge installer. There has
been some discussion, on and offlist, about it, and any input would be appreciated.
All the best.

Sure.  GDAL on OSGeo4W is built with VC10.

My opinion:

- Old labelling == over the bridge
- Old Symbology == stay or go as others prefer. It is well enough
hidden that it wont bother anyone still being there. It would be
cleaner to strip it out of the code base though.

Hi,

and what about icon theme? If I remember correctly we decide that
default icon theme in QGIS 2.0 will be "gis" theme by Robert.

Another important question ? switching to PyQt API v2.

RT Mapserver Exporter plugin uses SLD as intermediary format for styles,
but it needs mapscript v6.2 which is not available on OSGeo4W yet.

Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Printing multi-page PDFs from QgsComposition object
Message-ID: <1364900281330-5044040.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear Developers!I'm writing a new module, in which I try to implement some
codes to export PDF files. The output looks like a simple Word document:
only text, no maps. For that, I created a QgsComposition object, and added
everything to it (as QgsComposerLabel objects) just like in case of map
compositions. The export to PDF works fine, except that I have no idea how
to tell the module to print multiple pages. I use the default A4 paper size,
and sometimes the text does not fit on a single page.I defined a variable
called "position" which starts from 0 and increases every time a new line is
added to the page. Since it is in millimeters, I can always tell when a new
page should be loaded.Here is an excerpt of my code:def savePDF(self):   
self.mapRenderer = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()    self.c =
QgsComposition(self.mapRenderer)    self.c.setPaperSize(210.0, 297.0)   
#here I add all the text labels to the page    self.savePDFFileName =
QtGui.QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self.dlg, u'save as PDF', '.', 'PDF files
(*.pdf)')    self.printer = QPrinter()   
self.printer.setOrientation(QPrinter.Portrait)   
self.printer.setOutputFormat(QPrinter.PdfFormat)   
self.printer.setOutputFileName(self.savePDFFileName)   
self.printer.setPaperSize(QSizeF(self.c.paperWidth(), self.c.paperHeight()),
QPrinter.Millimeter)    self.printer.setFullPage(True)   
self.printer.setPrintRange(0) #this is for printing all pages   
self.printer.setColorMode(QPrinter.Color)    self.printer.setResolution(150)   
self.pdfPainter = QPainter(self.printer)    self.paperRectMM =
self.printer.pageRect(QPrinter.Millimeter)    self.paperRectPixel =
self.printer.pageRect(QPrinter.DevicePixel)   
self.c.render(self.pdfPainter, self.paperRectPixel, self.paperRectMM)   
self.pdfPainter.end()I already spent a lot of time trying to figure it out.
For example, at the QgsComposition class reference page (
http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsComposition.html ) I found some hints:
::setNumPages() and ::addPaperItem(), but when I try to invoke them they
don't work (error message says: 'QgsComposition' object has no attribute
'addPaperItem') which means that they are not implemented yet. Is it
possible that this can only be solved when a future QGIS release comes out?
For example, the .setNumPages says: "Note: added in version 1.9."I also
tried to go through the QPrinter class reference here:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qprinter.html According to it, the QPrinter
object has a .newPage() method ("Tells the printer to eject the current page
and to continue printing on a new page. Returns true if this was successful;
otherwise returns false"), but at this point it didn't solve my problem.Any
advices are highly acknowledged! I'm a python newbie...Thanks in advance,

Despite feature freeze, I'd like to ask what happened to that plan. As
far as I know, this change has not been made, and if this change is not
made before QGIS 2.0 it will have to wait for 3.0 (This is not something
to be done for 2.1).
It will probably be a small change (to switch in the core) but with a
huge impace (concerning plugins).

Yeah if we could flick it on it would make a load of difference to how
clean the code is.

Hi Pirmin, thanks for the clarification

using the ubuntu nightly build repo, I can make qgis crash by just
playign around with the globe settings.

Should I file a ticket?


cheers!

Hi,

I would vote to switch now, because later we will have much more
plugins to update. Also have two breaks (first ? new API, second
? PyQt API update) is not good IMO.

Hey

one thing:

I am assumming that code freeze applies to plugins as well, right? It
is ok for me, since most of want to do now in SEXTANTE is testing and
bugfixing, not adding new features, but I was just wondering. Since it
is very easy to deploy new versions of a plugin through the plugin
installer, maybe there is no need to be so strict with plugins?

Sorry for the question if this has discussed or written somewhere else...

Cheers
Victor

IMHO the plugin in core should be feature-frrezed now; further development should be
carried out in a branch, and published (perhaps as experimental) on plugins.qgis.org
Does this make sense?
All the best.

Hi,

+1 to switch now to the new PyQT API. We already a big break - so lets
break now (even more) and then stay stable for a while. Plugin
developers will have to rework their plugins anyway because of the new
Vector API and the switch to the new PyQT API can be done in the same step.

I would also vote to switch now when API is broken.

Finally, although master does not seem to suffer this problem, I

I noticed that there are non-QGIS Qsci API files in the QGIS source.  Shouldn't these be copied at build time from the installed Qscintilla API files?  Especially PyQt and Qscintilla itself.  QGIS has PyQt 4.7.4, Qscintilla 2.4.5 and GDAL 1.9.1 API files, yet I have PyQt 4.10, Qscintilla 2.7.1 and GDAL 1.10 beta2 (though no API file for GDAL) installed.

Hi QGIS devs!

I'm just been playing with the new python console and it's a great improvement -many thanks to Salvatore Larosa.

One feature that seems to be missing is the ability for auto-completion to work on runtime objects using automatic type inference.

e.g. currently:

>>> iface.activeLayer().

does not bring up autocompletion list for the QgsMaplayer object

Or:

>>> layer = iface.activeLayer()
>>> layer.

does not bring up the autocomplete for the layer object.

Is this a hard thing to implement? Or is it limited by the Qsci module?

Cheers,
Jeremy

The reasoning behind that is for having a baseline version for API files
for development, relative to the current user install base. In other words,
if on Mac the latest PyQt or Qscintilla API files were used, a PyQGIS
developer could use the console to craft a script or plugin (that they then
intend to release) and may be using APIs that are too new for users of a
different platform, e.g. RedHat. The RedHat user may be using Qt 4.6 and
the plugin/script may not work for them. Same concept goes for GDAL and
other bindings.

This brings up the question again of what the current base system
requirements for QGIS 2.0 should be. My feeling is that Qt should be at
minimum 4.6, though I think 4.7.x would be better. Qt 4.6 introduced built
in graphics drop shadows, for example. IMO, if a solid set of base
requirements can be established, even for common Python libs, then the
appropriate base version API files can be generated and ship with 2.0.

When we discussed this before, Radim made a good point that supporting
5-year-old installed software in the open source community is fairly
common, and often special releases are setup with that in mind, e.g. LTS
releases. This is much less common in the Mac and Windows user culture.

In the Python console's settings, Salvatore coded the ability for the user
to add custom API files. I haven't tested it recently, but the idea is that
a developer could load in what they want to match their target user systems
and project.

Regards,

Larry

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Memory layer saver plugin to core?
Message-ID: <1949156697.6336.1364944299085.JavaMail.root@s-101-LINZ>

Hi All

I'm wondering if there would be any support for moving the memory layer saver plugin to core.

At the moment many plugins create scratch memory layers, and the current default behaviour of QGis is to silently drop the data when the project is saved - when the user reloads the project the layers are still there, but the data is not (for example if they have created contours).  This seems a really bad user experience.

The memory layer saver plugin when installed simply saves the layers with the project, and automatically reloads them (at least for users with python installed, who are most likely to create memory layers).

I think that it is a fundamental user expectation that when they see the same thing as when they saved it that this should at the very least be part of the core distribution, and possibly enabled by default.

I have recently updated this to use a Qt binary stream (QDataStream) for all memory layers as a single file, rather than using GML format.  This may not appeal to some users, but it avoids problems that happened with passing the data through the OGR mapping, which was creating problems in restoring the attributes correctly (due to handling of the fid).  The Qt stream is a simple and efficient mechanism to avoid these issues.  An alternative would be to create an SQLite database, but that requires much more work, and will still end up with something which is not necessarily useful outside QGIS.

The plugin will need some rework for QGIS version 2 I suspect, in terms of iterating through the layer. But this should be minor.

The QDataStream version of the plugin is at  http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MemoryLayerSaver/

Cheers
Chris

Hey Chris,

As we are now in a feature freeze it might be a bit late to bring it in
however I would like to see it as a core part of QGIS, not as a plugin, but
as something that just happens when the user saves the project.  The New
Memory Layer plugin should also be moved into core of the program as it's
great for creating quick one of layers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] best to add a feature on a layer (+ crash)
Message-ID: <515BC145.3020400@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I try to add a feature in a layer with only one field (over a few in the 
layer) filled.

Here is what I tried:

f = QgsFeature()
f.setGeometry(myGeom)
f.setAttribute(1, myValue)
provider.addFeatures( [f] )

This causes QGIS to crash.

What did I wrong? I should not set field 1 if there is a field 0 in my 
feature?
Should I set the same number of fields as present in the layer?
Is there another way to achieve this?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Denis,

You didn't tell QgsFeature how many attributes it has.  You can call
initAttributes(1) or pass in the QgsFields into QgsFeature(fields)

Sounds good, as it fixes a serious issue (data loss).
Can we foresee any serious problem in including it?

All the best.

Hi, 
+1 for including it to core. I use it every day, and users outside my
administration are lost we not having the plugin enabled. 
  But I can live until 2.1 since we have a default conf enabling that plugin
for users. IMHO PSC has to decide what is the target version, but I don't
remember a clear choix on the target here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Memory-data-provider-persistence-td4108012.html
<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Memory-data-provider-persistence-td4108012.html>  
 
Shall QdataStream / sqlitedb / be embedded in QGS file or stay data along
qgs file? We need a clear position since project file structure stability is
really important for a GIS tool. Ccurrent behaviour is OK for me, but
compressed archive including QGS file + data + other ressources like svg,
images would be great and transparent from a user point of view. And user
could still uncompress it to repair broken project.

I have a patch pending on my machine, but I have found out it needs
more work than just running few "sip.setapi(...)" calls. In PyQt4
QVariant API v2 there is basically no QVariant anymore. Given that we
use QVariant.Type for things like defining QgsField types, we need to
find a workaround (in PyQt4 they had a bit similar situation with
QSettings).

I still would like to get it into 2.0, but recently I have been too
busy with real life to do anything with it. In the following weeks I
should be able to find more time, so hopefully we will make a switch.

I would like to remove old symbology before 2.0 as a part of API cleanups.

According to this discussion, most people would appreciate the switch.

I would like to have this change included as fast as possible, to give 
plugin developers as much time as possible to make the necessary 
changes before 2.0 is released.

Martin, if you are still too busy, would it be possible to push your 
branch and create a ToDo list, so others could jump in if they find 
some time?

Hi all.
I also would like a lot to get read of duplications and old code. Please consider
that there is still a lengthy list of unresolved issues:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Switching_from_Old_to_New_Symbology_and_Labeling
Perhaps we should decide a subset of blockers, not removing the old one before fixing
all of them.
All the best.

 Hi Paolo,

 This list is not up-to-date anymore. Most of it is now resolved now 
 (e.g. all the data-driven stuff). We should go through this list at the 
 hackfest to make sure that nothing is missing. The GUI inconsistencies 
 can also be fixed during the HF.

 +1 for removing old symbology and labeling before QGIS 2.0

 Andreas

Even if the list of missing features isn't emptied, the old symbology 
must get killed for 2.0

Paolo, I don't know about you but I personnally don't want to spent 
anymore time in the comings years explaining or solving issues due to 
the use of an accidental use of a deprecated engine. The switch has been 
going on for years : old symbology delenda est !

+1, old and new symbology/labelling shouldn't coexist anymore, they cause
lots of confusion.
IMHO keeping the old features makes slow the migration to the new ones.

Cheers.

+1 to erase old symbology and labeling from UI. 
But do we keep it in code so that old projects still open?

sure! I just want to be sure we'll not have to deal with lots of complains for a
missing feature. I do miss the quick and easy way we had for giving random colours to
a categorized vector, for instance.
Andreas: one of my top aims for the next HF is to clean deeply the wiki, and publish
the new site; help welcome. As it stands, it is probably more of harm than good.
Thanks for pointing out the page is obsolete.
All the best.

Hi, 
just tested this now in master. Great feature , thanks a lot. Just one small
question, how can we clean alignements lines displayed after double clin in
ruler bar?  I couldn't find anything for this. .

The code will have to go away, too. But don't worry - we can still
take care of the old projects by providing project file
transformations: so old projects will be transformed to new symbology
automatically before being read in QGIS 2.0.

I will have a look at that during the weekend to make see what else is
missing - if that will be too much work, I will just put the initial

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding a raster file to the QGIS sample dataset
Message-ID: <op.wuyvfjrtna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I would like to propose adding another raster file to the Alaska sample  
dataset that we provide for our users. Currently it only contains a small  
raster with landcover information. I'd like to add a hillshade raster  
(which I clipped from the global Natural Earth hillshade and reprojected  
for Alaska). I think it would be a useful addition for different  
demonstration purposes.

What do you think? Who has access and can change the download file?

Best wishes,
Anita

agreed, a more comprehensive sample package would be very useful.
I would not object splitting it in two, a basic package, kept small, and a full, with
OSM, Landsat, etc.
Obviously, this make sense if there is a maintainer of the package, to keep it
updated and add new stuff as it comes out.
All the best.

great idea. I have access and can update the zip file ... could you also

Hi all,

as feature freeze deadline has passed here it comes a resume of the
bug situation. A few of them are awaiting feedback and maybe can be
closed, but most of them are still valid.



*) there are 90 bugs classified as blockers

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23

that's it, are all regressions or new features added along the last
year that do not work at all or do not work as they should be.

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=32

a few of them are also (awaiting) in github pull request queue




Regarding the switch from old labelling/symbology to the new engine,
the page is *almost* obsolete, but not quite yet

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Switching_from_Old_to_New_Symbology_and_Labeling

beside missing a real color randomizer there is a big issue with
labels not being saved in qgis styles

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7134

and another 2/3 styling options that were available in the old
symbology that are not in the new one

Hi all.
I thought we were talking about symbology only. Labelling has a number of issues, for
me rendering slowness is a real blocker: on a slow machine it is practically
unusable, and many of our users have low-end hardware.
All the best.

To clarify it's a popup on first load. Clicking ok does go to the docs.
I'm guessing a debug js alert is in the code somewhere?

I agree the PAL engine, and possibly QgsPalLabeling class need optimized. I
view this as a definite bug that should be addressed before 2.0 is
released, if old labeling is to go away for good. I welcome any help in
getting this done, but ask that anyone looking to jump in to help to please
wait until I commit the new label backgrounds and drop shadows, which
represents a significant amount of editing to qgspallabeling.cpp.

I am basically done with initial label backgrounds implementation and will
commit today or tomorrow. Drop shadows will be sometime before end of week.
After that I have some bugs to take care of for the QgsPalLayerSettings and
QgsPalLabeling classes, mostly missing data defined counterparts to current
features and others listed here [0] (some may not be on tracker, yet), but
can work around anyone helping with speed optimization.

I have successfully tried converting back to drawing text directly with
QPainter instead of QPainterPath and that worked OK, but the speed increase
was small, i.e. something still needs optimized in PAL lib.

Of note: the more features and drawing that is requested of the new
labeling engine, the slower it will become, regardless of optimum rendering
speeds. There will come a point where older hardware just can't cut it
anymore.

Hi,

Testing feature creation now. I understand what the "delete broom" buttons  
are good for but in my opinion they should not be targeted when clicking  
tab to change to the next field. It's very irritating and surprising. The  
first few time, I thought I had made a mistake before I realized that the  
focus is going to the "delete broom".

Should I file a ticket for this?

No problem at all.

Would be nice though!

Hi Jeremy,
I was aware, sorry for that.
I am trying to solve this issue although I don't know if this is related to the Qsci module.
Thanks.

Hi QGIS devs!

I'm just been playing with the new python console and it's a great improvement -many thanks to Salvatore Larosa.

One feature that seems to be missing is the ability for auto-completion to work on runtime objects using automatic type inference.

e.g. currently:

>>> iface.activeLayer().

does not bring up autocompletion list for the QgsMaplayer object

Or:

>>> layer = iface.activeLayer()
>>> layer.

does not bring up the autocomplete for the layer object.

Is this a hard thing to implement? Or is it limited by the Qsci module?

Cheers,
Jeremy

Does anyone know of a workaround? Matt Boyd suggested saving images and 
loading them for these specific zoomlevels - could anyone tell me how to 
go about that (and is it allowed under the Google terms)?

Turns out the problem was the qt.conf file that sets paths to qt libs. Just pointing to the share folder using UNCs worked.

This is due to the new SVG based icons.  I had to reinstall qt4 from OSGeo4W in order to get the QtSVG libs to install.

Give that a go and see what happens.

Hi there.

After making a clean install of 1.9 - 174 (before vector merge) I'm missing some icons in the toolbar, namely Pan Map to Selection, Toggle Editing, Save Layer Edits, and Current Edits.

I thought there was a themes folder in qgis, but I can't find one even in other installs where this problem doesn't occur.

So my question is: where are the icons stored and can I replace them with a complete set?

Thanks,
Duarte

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why does the Simplify Feature tool have no normal
 input field for the tolerance?
Message-ID: <op.wu1a56jmna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

The Simplify Feature tool currently only allows the set the tolerance  
using a slider widget. It doesn't even display the tolerance value  
anywhere. If a users wants to take notes about the performed processing  
steps, he would have no chance with such an interface. I would therefore  
like to suggest adding an additional line input field where one can both  
read and change the tolerance settings.

What do you think?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I just noticed that with todays nightly, Offset Curve is greyed out for

Could someone please confirm what should be the correct behavior of this

+1, that would be a good option..for example, in my data, once I know that
entering 0.05 for the tolerance would be enough to simplify a geometry to my
requirements, it is tiresome to drag the slider everytime..

Hi Anita!
I'll probably take care of this at the HF (If noone else is taking it) as i
believe that every slider should have a connected spinbox to enter values
manually ..

kind regards

Hi all

I do not see about which "simplify tool" you are talking about. When I open
the Vector > Geometry > Simplify geometry , I get this :
http://picpaste.com/Capture_du_2013-04-05_12_22_30-C6KX48vK.png

It is not a slider, but a spinbox, which is fine.

Is there any other simplify tool I have missed ?

Thanks in advance

Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do we deal with duplicate functionality in
 Select by Location and Spatial Query Plugin?
Message-ID: <op.wu2iomljna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

In master, we currently have (at least) two ways to select features by  
location: Vector - Research Tools - Select by Location and Spatial Query  
plugin. Both cover Intersection. Spatial Query also offers Contains and  
Disjoint. Select by Location allows to compare a layer with itself while  
Spatial Query forces you to duplicate the layer to achieve the same  
results.

Do we want to keep both or wouldn't it be better to get rid of one?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,

personally I prefer to keep only one tool.

Also Spatial Query plugin is much faster on large datasets

Hi!

So as far as i can see there is only one difference - the "keeping" of the
layer - or forcing to duplicate the layer ..
Personaly I tend to keep everything clean and tidy too but I see not
disadvantage of having them both .. even more when one of them is "only" a
plugin..
So we already have the functionality built in if on needs it ..
And .. can the plugin function be used by sextante?

regards
Werner

It seems to be a core plugin though ... just like ftools.

Select by Location algorithm already present in SEXTANTE and it is
based on fTools code.

Message-ID: <1365172053040-5044851.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi dev's and contributors. 
In preparation of the next Hackfest, in which I won't be able to join you, I
would like to share my personnal priorities for new features and
consolidation of QGIS 2.0. 

Sorry for doing it now, when everybody is full time on 2.0 release, but I
think next hackfest is the right place to clarify further evolutions.
Considering that my reaction time to contract work on QGIS is too slow
compared to QGIS community speed, I need to have 2 years visibilty to be
able to fund at the right time.

*I initiated a google doc here [0]*

Any contributor is welcome to comment / edit this document as a draft effort
to contribute following a global systemic approach. 

I would be very pleased if Hackfest participants could react on this to help
us contribute.

Hi R?gis,
could you please explain this?
Improve DB manager with a SQL query assistant similar to Qspatialite one.
All the best.

Sure. DB Manager as a very nice SQL editor window with autocompletion.
Qspatialite embed the SQL Window with a user interface close to Mapinfo SQL
window, allowing to add table names, column names, columns values, group by,
order easily. This is one of the good features in Mapinfo, and users not
familiar with SQL still achieve doing some queries with this. 
DB manager has , in my mind the capacity to becom the main tool to interact
with Spatialite or QGIS. We still need to add user oriented features, and
also more ETL capacities (mapping structure and data types) for loading
purposes. 
Cheers, 
R?gis

Hi devs, I was wondering if there is a way to add coordinates in the following formats currently it supports only Decimal Degrees and Eastings/Northings however when working with GCS specially WGS84 one can receive the data in the following formats Degrees Minutes and Secondse.g. 16 18 59.56810 N 086 31 18.36440 W Degrees Minutese.g. 16 18.0165 N 086 31.0051 W Think of how Google Earth lets you input coordinates and how easy the workflow is, the Numerical Vertix Edit should have this same options and probably should be similar the form as the Numerical Digitize Also the tool has the option  Coordinates are given * in the CRS of theProject*in the CRS of the Layer Maybe it would be a good thing to add which CRS it is right in the dialog Coordinates are given * in the CRS of theProjectGCS WGS84*in the CRS of the LayerPCS WGS/UTM16 This plugins maybe should be core components of QGIS as it extends its functionalities and they could be more accessible if the actions were performed on right click

P.S. Also the option to change order of coordinate input, since its x,y/lon,lat but sometimes I need y,x /lat,lon just because of my workflow

Do anybody knows how can I draw a line starting at a point with an azimuth and distance? I tried Improved Polygon Capturing (misleading name a bit) but unfortunately it doesn't seem to do the work maybe because I am doing this with layers in WGS 84 but projected coordinates. It would be great if QGIS since I would like to recommend this for making aviation charts By the way can QGIS support Nautical Miles and Statute Miles?

I am a geologist and I perform frequently this type of calculation with a
Python script in the console or with a Python script without QGIS (see
similar solution with Fiona module in  How do I find vector line bearing in
QGIS or GRASS?
<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/55449/how-do-i-find-vector-line-bearing-in-qgis-or-grass/55480#55480> 
)

The solution is geometrically simple (here in 2D in a projected coordinate
system in meters)

      from PyQt4.QtCore import *
      from math import cos, sin, radians

      def ptor2ptfin(p, angle, dist):
           ''' position of the point located at a distance dist and azimuth
angle from the point p '''
           dist_x, dist_y = (dist * sin(radians(angle)),dist *
cos(radians(angle)))
           xfinal, yfinal = (p.x() + dist_x, p.y() + dist_y)
           return QgsPoint(xfinal,yfinal)

     # for QGIS 1.8
     distance = 200
     angle = 20
     line_start = QgsPoint(122.989235,13679.083853)
     line_end = ptor2ptfin(line_start, angle, distance)
     # memory layer
     v_layer = QgsVectorLayer("LineString", "azimuth_lines", "memory")
     pr = v_layer.dataProvider()
     pr.addAttributes( [ QgsField("azimuth", QVariant.Int),
QgsField("distance", QVariant.Double)])
     seg = QgsFeature()
     seg.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline([line_start, line_end]))
     seg.addAttribute(0, QVariant(int(angle)))
     seg.addAttribute(1, QVariant(distance))
     pr.addFeatures( [ seg ] )
     v_layer.updateExtents()
     v_layer.updateFieldMap()
     QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([v_layer])

And and you just need to change the function ptor2ptfin to fit your
requirements (haversine, 3D distance, miles, etc.)

I'd have gone for the qgsAzimuth plugin.


As far as I know QGIS is limited to units commonly used for projections.

A little hack to get it working correctly in your area:

You can change the level of maximum zoom by editing line 24 of 
.qgis/python/plugins/openlayers/html/google_satellite.html

The basic file says:
     { type: google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE, numZoomLevels: 22 }
I had to change to:
     { type: google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE, numZoomLevels: 20 }
and the plugin will not try to get images at higher resolution (which 
are not available anyway). Jut try several values to see what zoom level 
is adapted to your study area.

Still, I would love to see a real solution to the problem.

Regards,

Leyan

Hi,

What is the status of plugins
1. to load PostGIS Raster and
2. to load MBTiles

directly into QGIS as (raster) layer?

To be more specific:
I really mean loading PostGIS Raster and MBTiles directly, w/o trick using
GDAL (GdalTools?) and configuring .VRT "by hand" before.
For PostGIS Raster specifically I'm aware of the plugin "Load PostGIS
Raster" (alias "WKT Raster Plugin"?) from Mauricio de Paulo (QGIS Official
Repo. 2).

Yours, Stefan

Note that with GDAL 1.10, you'll be able to open mbtiles files directly as any 
other GDAL rasters.

Hi Even

Thanks for the hint! Of you really mean by "open mbtiles files directly as
any other GDAL rasters" being able to access files with postfix ".mbtiles"
(not by postfix .VRT) - that's what I mean.

Remains the issue for loading PostGIS Raster: When I try to load a "Add a
Postgis Raster Layer (using  "Load PostGIS Raster" (alias "WKT Raster
Plugin"?) from Mauricio de Paulo) I get the error below (I tried it with
QGIS 1.8 and 1.9 under Windows).

Yours, Stefan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Select by Location tool and other things
Message-ID: <SNT143-W10D5ADDE49C3EE13986BBEA5C40@phx.gbl>

I was using the select by location tool today and here are my thoughts. 1st. Once it finishes the selection it gives the result in the status bar of QGIS, I think if it is succesful it should close the current window and show a pop up XX/XXX features selected, and during the performing of the operation a progress bar should be shown that way we know it is working 2nd. I saved this selection to a folder as a shapefile, the behavior I was expecting was for a pop up window or something asking if I wanted to add this layer to the QGIS or not. Instead I had to navigate to the folder where it was saved and add it. 3rd. On my laptop running windows 8 some of the popup dialogs of QGIS overrun the task bar at the lower part of the screen making it impossible to press the ok button or others.

just yesterday i needed a spatial query but i realize that none of existing
plugin or core function have the possibility to apply a buffer for
selection.

i discovered a plugin called not properly "query by example" that lets to
apply a buffer (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/richie).

at the moment, it works only in 1.8. 
do you think it's possible to incorporate this feature into core?

Hi,

The 1st point was already reported as a regression on this ticket: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7528 .

I dont know if I should report this as a separated ticket. What do you think?

I was using the select by location tool today and here are my thoughts.
?
1st. Once it finishes the selection it gives the result in the status bar of?QGIS, I think if it is succesful it?should close the current window and show a pop up?XX/XXX features selected, and during the?performing of the operation a progress bar should be shown that way we know it is working
?
2nd. I saved this selection to a folder as a shapefile, the behavior I was expecting was for a pop up window or something asking if I wanted to add this layer to the QGIS or not. Instead I had to navigate to the folder where it was saved and add it.
?
3rd. On my laptop?running windows?8 some of the popup dialogs of?QGIS overrun the task bar?at the lower part of the screen making it?impossible to press the ok button or others.
?
?

Hi

just a quick note that old symbology API has been removed: QgsRenderer
(+ implementations), QgsSymbol and few others are gone. Projects using
old symbology still can be loaded and old symbology will be
automatically converted to new symbology (just in memory, so if you do
not save the project it will continue using old symbology). There are
few things that are currently not being converted properly to new
symbology:
- data-defined rotation / scale / symbol name - TODO
- map units flag for point symbol - TODO
- texture for fill style - no equivalent in new symbology (svg fill is
better anyway)
- continuous color renderer - no equivalent in new symbology
(graduated symbol renderer may be used instead)
- composer - legend items for old symbology are ignored and need to be
recreated manually

Old labeling has been kept as-is - there's not so much code involved
(basically just one class, QgsLabel) so it's not such hot topic within
the API cleanup.

I am aware that few unit tests related to rendering got broken, I will
fix them soon. (btw. there are few failing tests not related to the
symbology changes: qgis_atlascompositiontest, qgis_composerhtmltest)

How do others feel about dropping "V2" postfix from new symbology
classes for QGIS 2.0? E.g. QgsSymbol instead of QgsSymbolV2. I would
like to see those removed to keep the API clean.

Regards
Martin

I think they are different, although have some similarities. I don't know what the right approach about reporting would be but I guess I was hoping someone in the developer list would check this out

 Hi Martin,

 Thank you for your work on removing the old symbology stuff.

 Marco is working on data-defined symbology and it is already in master. 
 These are now all on the symbol level as you may want different 
 rotations for each component of a combined symbol. Also the units are 
 now more fine-grained. As an exaple you can define a size in map units 
 and the outline in mm.

 I agree that the texture for fill style is obsolete as we have the line 
 and point pattern editors and SVG patterns.

 Andreas

Re texture fill, does the svg fill support bitmap within svg?

I assume we have tickets for all these issues; should we mark these as
blockers?
I would add the random colour assignment (or, did I miss something?)

Hi Martin

I also like to have the V2 postfixes removed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS Server] GetProjectSettings: BoundingBox Issue
Message-ID: <5162A7B2.3010709@jena.de>

Hi,

I set up a pretty simple project using current QGIS Server (Codeversion 
082c6ba) on a Linux machine. The Project is using WGS84 (EPSG:4326). 
Only one shape file is contained being in EPSG:4326, too.

This is what QGIS server replies:
1) 
http://localhost/wms/kartenportal_1_9?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
<Layer queryable="1">
   <Name>Ortsteile</Name>
   <Title>Ortsteile</Title>
   <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS>
   <EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
     <westBoundLongitude>11.4988</westBoundLongitude>
     <eastBoundLongitude>11.6731</eastBoundLongitude>
     <southBoundLatitude>50.8561</southBoundLatitude>
     <northBoundLatitude>50.9892</northBoundLatitude>
   </EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
   <BoundingBox CRS="EPSG:4326" maxx="11.6731" minx="11.4988" 
maxy="50.9892" miny="50.8561"/>

2) 
http://localhost/wms/kartenportal_1_9?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings:
<Layer displayField="name" queryable="1" visible="1">
   <Name>Ortsteile</Name>
   <Title>Ortsteile</Title>
   <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS>
   <EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
     <westBoundLongitude>11.4988</westBoundLongitude>
     <eastBoundLongitude>11.6731</eastBoundLongitude>
     <southBoundLatitude>50.8561</southBoundLatitude>
     <northBoundLatitude>50.9892</northBoundLatitude>
   </EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
   <BoundingBox CRS="EPSG:4326" maxx="50.9892" minx="50.8561" 
maxy="11.6731" miny="11.4988"/>

In both cases <EX_GeographicBoundingBox> is identical, whereas max* and 
min* parameters in the BoundingBox tag are interchanged.

QgisWebClient cannot determine a correct maxExtent from 
GetProjectSettings thus centering on 0,0 upon start.

Is this on purpose?

Message-ID: <1365426792728-5045238.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I am simply stuck at a seemingly simple issue. I want to create a polygon
rubberband. But even after setting the isPolygon in the constructor to
'True', it is creating a polyline rubberband. I am using latest master
version. Here is what i tried in the python console.

pastebin link <http://pastebin.com/bKGJwZkB>  

mCanv = iface.mapCanvas()
rb = QgsRubberBand(mCanv,True) #shouldn't this constructor create a polygon
shaped band?
 
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(300,300))
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(400,400))
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(400,600))
 
print rb.asGeometry().exportToWkt()
 
LINESTRING(300.0 300.0, 400.0 400.0, 400.0 600.0)

Shouldn't the exportToWkt() be outputting a Polygon instead of a Linestring?
What am i doing wrong here?

Thanks
Vinayan

thanks to Salvatore's help on irc, i got over this issue.

apparently the 'isPolygon' method was deprected..

here is the snippet that worked..

mCanvas = iface.mapCanvas()
rb = QgsRubberBand(mCanvas,QGis.Polygon)
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(300,300))
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(400,400))
rb.addPoint(QgsPoint(400,600))
print rb.asGeometry().exportToWkt()
POLYGON((300.0 300.0,400.0 400.0,400.0 600.0,300.0 300.0))

Agreed. Besides release, also packaging in osgeo4w would be important.
All the best.

GDAL 1.10beta2 has been released a week ago, so I think RC1 and final release
are close. Hopefully in one month maximum.

Hi all,
I would like to try to extend a bit the filter functionalities in qgis
server, but I've never setup e debug environment for a C++ CGI.
Can you suggest me a way to do it? I use QtCreator (Linux) for QGis
Desktop and I will like to employ iy here too, but I can't figure how
to attach it to the CGI executable...

thanks,
Giovanni

Hi Giovanni

Just set the environment variable QUERY_STRING (e.g. 
QUERY_STRING='SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities') and start the 
executable with the debugger.
If you extend the filter possibilities, make sure not to open 
possibilities for sql-injections.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,
thanks for the tip. That's a starting point, but what about POST data?
How do you debug it?

Yes, I'm aware of the risk for sql-injections ;)

I'm usually debugging GET requests. However, in Qt Creator, you can also 
attach to a running fcgi Prozess.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rename through add vector file
Message-ID: <SNT143-W3741E32FF128470D994D17A5C50@phx.gbl>

I was adding a *.shp with the add vector dialog, since it let me rename I renamed it and proceed to adding giving me an error. After opening the folder where I had the *.shp it became apparent that the problem is it only renamed one of the files associated with shapefile. So the correct behavior should to not allow renaming of shapefiles or that renaming of the shapefile renames all the files associated to it (similar to what you can do with ArcCatalog of ESRI)

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <SNT143-W394A590331E5A96EF39F91A5C50@phx.gbl>

Couple of things here Apparently for buffer to work correctly both the source layer and the project must be in the same projection, I tried to buffer a point in EPSG 4325:WGS 84 to a distance of 10 NM (18 520 m since QGIS doesn't support several units) and it didn't work, I can do this with other COTS software The other point is that it would be nice to be able to have multiple buffer rings, just set the number of desired rings and the buffer distance interval (which would be a constant) This is my example I have one airport which I need multiple rings at 10 NM intervals, In QGIS I would need to do 6-10 times a buffer to a different shapefile and then merge them all together. It would be nice to just do it once

in old symbology, one could choose the Unique value renderer, click on
Classify, and get a random colour assignment for each class.
The same operation with new symbology is much more convoluted, and
requires far more clicks to get an almost equal result.
I this is still unclear, please ask.
All the best.

I agree, but that would be a new feature to make random color
assignment simpler in new symbology.

Yo can see it like this, but from the user point of view is rather a
regression, not being able doing somethig that was easy to do before.

I have updated color ramp manager to version 0.2.1 which uses new package
files in the repository at github.org .

Please test and report here - could you test downloading the selection as
well as the full cpt-city package?

To users (e.g. me) this is absolutely viewed as a regression.

Just in case someone not watching the bug report has something to offer.  My thought was to make the problem Enter Coord dialog floating, but I have no idea how to do that (minimal C++, no Qt skills) so I can test it.

Hi,

Here's an update on the labeling work I've been doing for the past week:

* Label backgrounds (geometric shapes and SVG) have been
implemented/committed, but currently have a couple of loose ends [0].

* Label drop shadows are essentially functional, and work for label buffers
[1]. I need a couple of days to clean up the overly verbose code, simplify
the logic and make it work for label text and backgrounds. In the GUI and
map canvas screen snaps [2][3] you can see an example of the radius
blurring and of the 'global' offset option (there are also debug rectangles
shown). When global is checked for shadow offset, rotated label's drop
shadows are adjusted to match the global offset for the layer (instead of
being relative to the label's rotation). For example, this allows all drop
shadows on all labels, or their buffers/backgrounds, to match what a user
may have setup in a hill shaded raster, i.e. opposite the angle of a
virtual sun. Turning on all these features does slow labeling down, of
course.  :^)

* Significantly missing functionality currently occurs in the data defined
aspect of new labeling features. Many of the new features do not have
corresponding data defined options, and the current gui and usage of the
data defined values does not mirror that of the new setup by recently
committed by Dr. Marco H for symbology. Since labeling does not yet have a
rule-based setup, it would be *very good* to have the current data defined
setup for labeling switched over to Marco's method. This will allow
expressions to be used for all labeling options and give users a solid
feature set for labeling to work with until 2.1.

So, I have a couple questions:

Can I push the cleaned up and functional labeling drop shadows work to
master branch in a couple of days, for inclusion in 2.0? It was my
understanding this was part of the labeling background work I was
temporarily allowed to do, but it has taken a couple of days longer than
expected.

Does switching over the data defined backend for labeling constitute a new
feature? If not, I'd like to work on it over the next week.

If switching over the data defined backend is considered a new feature, and
not allowed to be committed right now, can I at least work on adding some
of the missing data defined options for labeling?

Hi!

Well I'd still vote
+1
for integrating

To me it does make a lot more sense to break the API NOW with 2.0 than
introducing some small glitches afterwards again with 2.1 or 2.2
It's just that the Hackfest starts on Thursday and .. it should be good to
have all API changes pulled in by then ..

So if it's possible to just do a small patch for breaking the API and doing
the "cleanup" during the bugfix phase I'd still vote for doing it right now!

just my 2?

kind regards
Werner

Hi all,
i have a question about enviromental variable on Mac.
>From python shell i can import psycopg2 module. If i use Python console from 
QGIS this module it can found.
I have to write:
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.
7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/')
import psycopg2

and now it works.
How can fix it adding  permanently to QGIS enviromental variable?

Thanks

Isn't that the usual case if the .ui file is saved in a too small state in
the designer?
I made the experience that if the ui is saved too small - such things
happen..

So just adjust the .ui file and commit it again ..

That leads me to the Guidelines - I remember we said that every window
should be smaller than (800x480?) .. I don't remember the exact amount ..
It was to run QGIS on Netbooks ..
Is this "rule" still active?

kind regards
Werner

Hi Larry

+1 for pushing the drop shadows to master.

Tim as release manager needs to decide here.

Something related is to have classified label styles. Often it is 
necessary to apply multiple label styles in one layer depending on 
attribute expressions (kind of rule based renderer for labels). Maybe in 
2.1...

Marco

Consult this recent discussion:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/error-running-qgis-master-sextante-depends-on-psycopg2-but-this-dependency-isn-t-well-known-td5023977.html#a5042252

Basically, if you are using QGIS installed via kyngchaos or the nightly,
the app is built against Apple's system Python. As such, it looks for
modules installed in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, not under /opt.

Kyngchaos.com has an installer for that module that will properly install,
so that QGIS will find it.
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/python

There are other solutions, but that is the simplest.

Regards,

Larry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis Multipolygon :: cannot create a feature
Message-ID: <51640256.9000800@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a postgis layer of multipolygon.

If I create a new feature in QGIS with a single polygon in it, I have 
the error:
PostGIS error while adding features: ERROR:  Geometry type (Polygon) 
does not match column type (MultiPolygon)

Did I missed something?

Because to me, a multipolygon can be a single polygon.

Thanks,

Denis

+1 with you Denis. This restriction also implies severe known bugs when using
merge or clip tools that creates POLYGON and not MULTIPOLYGON. 
Currently, I solve this by modifying postgis constraint so that it accepts
POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON. Bu this is a bad practice. 
I would really prefer that QGIS automagically propose multipolygon (or multi
point, or multilinestring)  when a multi geometry type as been declared when
loading layer.

That would be a good idea, and I really think it could be a blocker because it leads to dead-end when editing, and sometimes leads to data loss. ( Joeren already solved that critical issue, because postgres provider dropped rows before inserting new rows, and all was lost if a constraint error was raised)

That would be a good idea, and I really think it could be a blocker because it leads to dead-end when editing, and sometimes leads to data loss. ( Joeren already solved that critical issue, because postgres provider dropped rows before inserting new rows, and all was lost if a constraint error was raised)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Python] QgsFeatureIterator for geometryless
	PostgreSQL-Layer
Message-ID: <5164130B.4050309@jena.de>

Hi,

I am trying to access features of a geometryless layer derived from a 
PostgreSQL table in current master.

if I do
feat = QgsFeature()
iter = myLayer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(myFid))
iter.nextFeature(feat)
returns False and I get a message in the PostgreSQL message tab stating 
"Trying to fetch geometry on layer without geometry."

Can anybody confirm?
Do I miss anything or is this a bug?

Bernhard

P. S.
in 1.8 one could pass a Boolean in order to tell the dataProvider to 
fetch the geometry or not.

Hi antonio, 
this is not related strictly to QGIS. The dialog you have is a system file
dialog with a filter showing only file extensions you selected. Arcview 3.2
acted in the same way. 
What you are asking for is replacing standard file dialog with a gis browser
dialog. That is good from a user point of view. 
 IMHO it's to early since many file types are supported by gdal in QGIS, but
not yet interpreted by Browser tool. I would keep OGR file dialog as it is
for advanced users, who like to have a raw view on system files, and future
unified access to datasource in brower style.
Opinions?

What you say makes sense I remember the old days of ArcView 3.2; heck I used it 8 years ago when I started using GIS. Not good comparing QGIS with what a GIS system did back in 1999 when it first came out though

>From the user point of view, specially those who are basic users (which may be more than you think) being able to rename a file and then corrupt it is not a good thing, plus I think the only special case is shapefiles right? I think it is the only file that needs renaming *.dbf *.shx *.prj *.qpj Not sure if this is easy to implement or not but it would be  a nice to have feature. On another note, why is it the only format you can create new is a shapefile? What if I really want to create a KML or GML?

You request geometry (by not saying you don't want any) - and get refused
because there's none.

myLayer.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(myFid).setFlags( QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry ) )

should work.  Not really a bug, but inconvienent.

Thanks vinayan, had the same trouble which makes me ask if anybody has an
idea if it would be possible to show in the deprecated methods in the
overview part of each class doc?
basically has anyone an idea on how to answer this answer this [1].

Subject: [Qgis-developer] getting to valmiera on your own
Message-ID: <516481EE.8030406@terglobo.nl>

Hi all who likes to get at the hackfest in Valmiera this week.

After spending some days in Latvia and having used the public transport 
I found out that it's not too hard too hard get in Valmiera on your own. 
That's cool since the "A car lift would be appreciated" is probably not 
going to work for you...

 From the airport you take the "Airport Express Bus" for 3 LAT and get 
off at the Central Station in Riga. You can also take a taxi which I 
paid 9 LAT for.

At the station you can take a direct train to Valmiera which takes about 
2.5 hours and goes 4 times a day.

662? 1234567 Diesel-engine train O 06:32 09:00 Riga-Pasazieru ? Valga
664? 1234567 Diesel-engine train O 13:10 15:39 Riga-Pasazieru ? Valga
668? 1234567 Diesel-engine train O 18:14 20:35 Riga-Pasazieru ? Valga
656? 1234567 Diesel-engine train O 21:02 23:34 Riga-Pasazieru ? Valmiera

There are also buses going, but I didn't try those:
http://www.1188.lv/satiksme/starppilsetu_autobusi/saraksti?from=R%C4%ABgas++SAO&from-id=7083&to=Valmieras+AO

If you're using the Layer -> Save as vector (or the Save selection as vector) then it isn't. It defaults to shapefile, but this is a drop down that can be changed to a whole bunch of different formats.

If it does otherwise it's a problem.

Note also that KML and GML have other expectations (e.g. CRS) that you will need to account for in the making of the file.

J?rgen,

this works!
I checked the docs for QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures and QgsFeatureIterator 
but not for QgsFeatureRequest

thank you and all the best

Without being super familiar with the code, just the concept Offset 
Curve with a polygon makes no sense unless the goal is simply to shift a 
copy of the polygon in one direction. In which case you'd need the user 
to tell you the direction since a polygon has an edge in all directions.

The polygon equivalent is a one sided buffer to the outside or the inside.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1365647185.57062.YahooMailClassic@web122006.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

The organisation I work for, NIWA in New Zealand is looking to replace an aging application.

http://www.niwa.co.nz/freshwater-and-estuaries/nzffd/assistant-software

The specs are pretty clear from the description & old program available at this site, we can discuss details on the data entry protocols to be used, but given our normal workflows are very OGC oriented, it is likely that an O&M or WFS based approach would be preferred for uploads & downloads.

At this stage I'm looking for anyone who may be interested in undertaking this work, and supporting it into the future.

I'm not sure if a QGIS plugin architecture would be suitable, but would like to be able to contribute as much of the development as possible back to the QGIS community.

We'd like this to be based on QGIS 2.0, with a completion date ideally by the end of June.

Please let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,

?? Brent Wood

Hi all,

I am trying to use the atlas functionality in a standalone python script. I am using the qgsAtlasComposition class. I get an error running this line:

myAtlas.beginRender()

I get an unknown exception.

I have also found that running myAtlas.numFeatures() always returns 0 even though I have added a layer that has data using setCoverageLayer().

I did take a look at this page and followed the steps in the test:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/test_qgsatlascomposition.py

but I cannot get it to work in my script. I cannot get the test to work either. It always errors on the beginRender() line.

* targeted donations & crowdsourcing
* translation infrastructure
* QGIS trademark & charity
* GSoC startup and coordination
* plugin infrastructure consolidation (migration of old repos, rules

Of course I'm not pretending I can fix all these issues, but at least
to help carrying the work much further.
I'm sure more cool stuff will be added along the way.

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0FB26C801A@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I'm fixing a long standing bug in the delimited text plugin (new lines in quoted fields in CSV files), and as part of this I want to build some tests. I'm starting from test_qgsmemoryprovider.py, which seems to be a good starting point, except that before I can run any tests I need to install the plugin.

So I'm looking for a steer on how install the plugin into the registry in order to be able to test it.  It looks like this should just be a call to

QgsPluginRegistry.instance().loadCppPlugin(path-to-plugin)

but I'm not sure what the proper way to get the path-to-plugin is in the test.  Which I guess should account for the difference between Windows and linux.

Any advice gratefully received!

Thanks
Chris

Hi all.
I think we should have a website as lean and clean as possible,
leaving more dynamic stuff to other media, and making it easier to
translate and maintain it.
This is a proposal.

=======
Home page
[add main features, qgis server, web clients]
=======
* Download
* Plugins
* Manuals
* Sponsorship
* Case studies
* Commercial support
* Planet
* Bugtracker
* Contacts [includes Community]
   * Mailing lists
   * Chat
   * Stackexchange
   * local user groups (list, with links to their pages)
   * user meetings
   * developer meetings
   * conferences (upcoming events)
   * polls (probably we cannot do it in our new structure, and we'll
have to use an external resource)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

This have been discussed several times, and I think we all agreed on it.
So if there is no further objection, let's start.
I'd appreciate if someone could take the responsibility for one or
more pages.
I'm going to work on git.

Thanks.

Can you share the code you're using ? Or a stack trace or a line number
where the error occurs ?
What version / git revision are you using ?

You have to call setCoverageLayer and setComposerMap before calling
beginRender(), is it the case ?

This is linked to the previous issue. Features are iterated over during
beginRender()

I was about to say everything work fine here, but ... I realized there
is something wrong with the last changes I did.

Should be fixed with this:

Not sure if it will fix your problem ...

Hi all.
At this HF we have a new dev, Emilio, who is working in Faunalia on a
new, I believe useful, feature: storing styling options in a DB for DB
layers, and loading it automatically, much as it happens for
shapefiles + qml.
If you are interested, you're welcome to come and discuss the
implementation details.
All the best.

Are you trying to test the provider or the (GUI) plugin?

The provider can be tested easily by creating a QgsVectorLayer
instance with the "delimitedtext" provider string. It is only
necessary to initialize QGIS core library which will in turn
initialize provider registry (and load all providers). The memory
provider test uses a convenience function getQgisTestApp() from
utilities.py.

To my knowledge it is not possible to test the plugin:
QgsPluginRegistry is not a part of qgis libraries, it's a class
belonging to QGIS executable, so you cannot access it.

Martin

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xoGoG9XJz7cJKMZqzw7Jve6M-YKMjMScJtG6USgzxcZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
it happens that luanching some heavy processes from plugins (e.g. for data
processing) can block QGis for a long time. Sometimes the process freezes,
sometimes there was a problem in settings things, and the unavoidable
action is killing QGis.
I know it should be the responsability of the plugins developer to manage
these situations (e.g. starting a new thread to do long running processes),
but would it be possible to have the plugins run on a separated thread and
provide a "kill it!" button in QGis? The modal dialogs do not permit to
interact with QGis when a plugin use them, so I don't know if it's
technically feasible in these cases...

Thanks for the reply.

I am using QGIS master from OSGeo4W. At the moment I am just trying to get the example in the test to work. But it always falls over at beginRender(). My vector layer is a query from a PostGIS database.

Code is below (as you can see it is pretty much the same as the test code):

           query = """(SELECT * From test.tablename WHERE substring(knrgnrbnr from 1 for 4) = '""" + KommuneNr + """')"""
            
            vlayer = loadPostGISLayerQuery("localhost", "5432", "database", "user", "password",query,"geom","gid","layername")

            QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
            mMapRenderer = QgsMapRenderer()
            layerStringList = QStringList()
            layerStringList.append( vlayer.id() )
            mMapRenderer.setLayerSet( layerStringList )
            mMapRenderer.setProjectionsEnabled( True )
            crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
            crs.createFromSrid( 32632 )
            mMapRenderer.setDestinationCrs( crs )

            mComposition = QgsComposition( mMapRenderer )
            mComposition.setPaperSize( 297, 210 )
            
            props = { "color": "0,127,0" }
            fillSymbol = QgsFillSymbolV2.createSimple( props )

Hi James,

Can you share the code you're using ? Or a stack trace or a line number where the error occurs ?
What version / git revision are you using ?

You have to call setCoverageLayer and setComposerMap before calling beginRender(), is it the case ?

This is linked to the previous issue. Features are iterated over during
beginRender()

I was about to say everything work fine here, but ... I realized there is something wrong with the last changes I did.

Should be fixed with this:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/516

Not sure if it will fix your problem ...

Dear Mr. Wood,

I am GIS Professional from Greece and would like to help with your project.
In this list you will find many experienced GIS and QGIS dev's. However,
from my point of view an underestimated aspect of GIS development is data
and system modeling. I have studied and practice UML modelling and in my
opinion it is the only way to properly document GIS (and not only) systems.

What I can do for you is the following:

If you can send me a description of your system, I can start documenting
both the state of the art and the desirable solution. If you agree, I will
do this work free of charge, but in a loose form of cooperation (I will
likely devote a few hours each week). If you like my work and think it
helped the development process, you can give me credit for that. This way I
can start building my reputation and you can (hopefully) benefit from my
documentation work.

So please tell me what you think and if you think we can work things out!

 

Thank you in advance,

 

Petros Apotsos

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lizmap for publishing QGIS maps on the web - new
	version 2.8.0
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7S0zdkY+eKcG+ZE-vhobMn5YdwGeCQUUeEvrhd+mbrig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS users and devs

We have just released the new version 2.8.0 of Lizmap Web Client, and
version 1.9.0 of the related Lizmap plugin. This new versions bring some
interesting features such as full editiing capabilities in the web client
for Spatialite and PostGis layers. Below is the detailed list of changes
since last version one month ago:

* Edition tools
The annotation tool has been fully replaced by a full featured edition
tool. The QGIS project maintainer can configure available actions for the
edition layers : create feature, modifiy attributes, modify geometry,
delete feature. As before, the Lizmap Web Client admin decides which groups
of users have access to the edition for each Lizmap repository.
Detailed description here:
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-plugin/features/edition.html&usg=ALkJrhg3Hgo-IbPSUl51py6jmzDvbL2m7g

You can try this feature in the demo project:
https://demo.lizmap.3liz.com/index.php/view/map/?repository=montpellier&project=montpellier
The data of the edition layers is resetted each hour in this project to let
people try it.

* Log
Some user actions can now be logged : map display, user login, printing,
popup, editions. Lizmap administrator can modify a configuration file to
activate or deactive this feature per action. The Lizmap Web Client admin
panel let the admin view the log. Logs can also be emptied.
Detailed description:
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-web-client/administration/logs.html&usg=ALkJrhj02cgDrmRJFv8sAK7LuwN947mOcQ


* Registration form to ask for an account
Lizmap admin can activate an option in Lizmap Configuration pannel
(Services) which will add a new menu "Register". This menu item links to a
form where the visitor can fill some information and then submit his
request. The administrator will be warn by email that someone has filled up
the form, and will be able to give the user appropriate rights by putting
him into appropriates groups.


* Other improvements
- better handling of special characters in QGIS layer titles ( + - / ; ,
etc.)
- Debug popup size in Google Chrome / Chromium
- active menu items are more visible
- Debug for creation of feature in PostGIS / Spatialite layers (postgresql
schemas, etc.)


* Documentation
Online documentation has been updated :
http://docs.3liz.com/fr/


* We would like to thank
- The Artists team from CIRAD for funding the edition tool
- Andromede Oc?anologie for funding the log and subscription feature
- People and organizations providing help, support, bug reports, etc :
CIRAD (?quipe Artists), Territoires et Paysages, INRA de St Laurent de la
Pr?e, Alis? G?omatique, l'ADUGA, les mod?rateurs de ForumSIG, Paolo
Cavallini de Faunalia, Salvatores Larrosa, etc.

* Sources
Source code is available for Lizmap Web Client, Lizmap plugin and
documentation on Github: https://github.com/3liz/
Detailed changelog from last version :
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/compare/2.7.2...2.8.0

* Upgrading
If you already have an older version installed, please follow the
guidelines here
http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=fr&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.fr&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-web-client/installation/linux.html&usg=ALkJrhiea2kU8XA56osY3RabB5pqNaH6mA#montee-de-version
Or here because Google translate add spaces between slashes...
http://docs.3liz.com/fr/lizmap-web-client/installation/linux.html#montee-de-version

We hope this new version will bring new opportunities for QGIS users and
developpers for sharing Maps and re-thinking some workflows.

PS: Sorry for the use of Google translation. I have not yet taken the time
to translate the whole documentation in English. The Web interface and
plugin are fully translated in English and Italian though.

Regards,

Michael DOUCHIN

Where is RT Mapserver Exporter plugin? I look for it in plugin manager
but I cannot find  it.
I think that don't have more MapServer Export is a big regression of
QGIS; someone during hackfest could work on it? or maybe a google
summer of code project?

Not being a developer, and not being able to help that much, please forgive
my intrusion, But I would like to give my opinion regarding the Website.

I might be also late to this discussion, but, As a user, one thing I find
quite disconcerting in qgis.org page is the fact that almost every menu
item send you to different site\page, breaking with the original layout and
making it difficult to navigate in the site.

Therefore, IMHO, I think outside links should open a new browser tab
instead of redirect the user to a new site.

found

with postgis layer with no password stored it return this error

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/lucadelu/.qgis2/python/plugins/rt_mapserver_exporter/mapfileexportdlg.py",
line 353, in accept

MapServerError: msPostGISLayerOpen(): Query error. Database connection

Is the database running? Is it allowing connections? Does the
specified user exist? Is the password valid? Is the database on the
standard port?

Could be perfect if it could open a dialog and digit the password

Hi,

Just to let you know we have been working on a fork of this plugin
during a sprint with Thomas Bonfort (from the MapServer project) to
replace the use of SLD for conversion by direct calls to the mapscript API.

The code can be found here :
https://github.com/Oslandia/rt_mapserver_exporter/tree/nosld

... as well as a TODO list :
https://github.com/Oslandia/rt_mapserver_exporter/wiki/Todo

We mainly focused on the new symbology and most of the features are
covered. There are still features that would be very hard to translate
into mapserver terms.

Let us know if you find this useful.

Hi Tim,
thanks for that. I knew the scripts, but we need a way to quickly
compile just the html of website, no translation, to check the content
we are adding. Compiling everything takes ages, and it is really
unnecessary to us.
Any idea? If not, I can probably set up a simple Makefile for it:
should I commit it then?
All the best.

wow, I didn't notice you've forked it on GH and working on that!

BTW, I see there's another fork [1] as well as some issues was fixed by
both
you and "geonux" (e.g. using the epsg vs proj string).

What do you think about a brainstorming (even by email...) on how to
improve
it avoiding waste of time due effort on the same fixes?

I really like your work as in this moment MapServer has a weak SLD1.1
support,
BTW I hope you understand I've chosen SLD because this format is (or at
least
should become) the standard for style interchange, so unbound to different
API
implementations.

Best regards.

Why not just add an option to the post_translate script to suppress pdf?
You can already compile for just one lang like this:

BTW I cannot reproduce the second issue, I already tried with a PG layer
and
it worked fine. Please, at least try to find the time to improve the ticket.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature action
Message-ID: <3F0E8571-7F7C-411D-B59E-934BEE72066C@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to create actions from within a plugin.

Basically, the plugin would add an action for specified layers, and this action would trigger some method with layer and feature as argument.
Is this possible?

This would be used to perform a specific action on features. So I'd like to have that action available by a right-click in the feature form (which gives the actions of the layer).

The problem is that you can only have attributes values as argument, but not the layer id neither the feature id.

Someone has an idea on how to deal with this?

Thanks,

Denis

Message-ID: <CALPrXdo79NXjuWKCC7FdwqVjfnBgaoON4OK1Xs1bQxxiAXNrjA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings developers,

I think we should consider a way to flag existing plugins that are not
compatible with the new 2.0 api. This will improve user experience by
preventing install of plugins that do not work with the users current QGIS
version.

Ideally all plugins would be converted to work with both 1.8 and 2.0, but
this either won't happen completely or will take an unknown amount of time.

This situation has already happened to those living on the bleeding edge
(using 1.9 in production):
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/57718/qgis-trace-tool-error/57724#57724

One way to do this is to implement a "QGIS maximum version" entry in the
plugins metadata (or __init__.py). Alternatively there may be a way to do
this with the plugin repository app, however I'm not familiar enough with
its implementation to suggest how that could be done.

Please provide feedback...

Hi,

Thanks to the hackers, solution's has been found:

while adding the action to the layer, we can give the layer id in the string, and the feature id is known with [% $id %].

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS -> Mapserver export
Message-ID: <201304111628.02744.vincent.ml@oslandia.com>

Hi,
Following the discussion in the other thread (?QGIS Globe and mapserver 
export?).

We at Oslandia started a very early proof of concept and work on
 QGIS->Mapserver interactions.

Warning : all this work is very alpha work, buggy, messy and not complete.

The first part is a plugin ??-la tilemill? to edit and watch live modifications 
of a mapfile, based on the sourcepole mapfile tools plugins, but greatly 
enhanced (with integrated editor).
It's there :
https://github.com/Oslandia/qgis-mapfile-tools

We work as well on QGIS->Mapfile export, as Hugo stated, based on Giuseppe's 
work, but without going through SLD :

https://github.com/Oslandia/rt_mapserver_exporter/tree/nosld
https://github.com/Oslandia/rt_mapserver_exporter/wiki/Todo

We chose the direct QGIS->Mapfile way because :
* SLD only covers a very small subset of QGIS/Mapserver symbology features
* SLD failed at being a reference format for styling (see the amount of 
various languages for that)
* Mapserver support for SLD is not really good

It would be great to have a common style interchange format, but I do not see 
that coming in the following years, and if it happens, it would probably be 
more a css-oriented format than SLD type.

The current "nosld" branch as Hugo said, focus on new symbology. Some 
incompatibilities exist between the two symbology systems, and they should be 
well documented (not that well covered as for now, see TODO).

There is a need for work on the mapserver side too, to facilitate writing this 
kind of converter, without having to leverage the whole mapserver stack. This 
would be a "libmapfile" library, independant from the renderer. Thomas has some 
ideas on that topic.

As for now, feel free to hack on our work and improve it. Maybe we should have 
a global "export" plugin with various export types, among them SLD, native 
mapserver, and the architecture to add more (Mapnik xml, carto, cartocss, 
cascadenik, google maps symbology...)

We do not really have time to work further on it by now, but we'll be happy to 
help and we intend to have some work done later in the year.

Vincent

hi all, I know that michael minn (cc) from mmqgis has flagged the 2.0
version as experimental and the 1.8 not. this somehow solves the proble
temporarily, but maxversion would be nice so different versions would
cohexist.

The plugin compatibility and installer refactoring is my major task for the 
HF. We'll discuss a target architecture for 2.x as soon as Alessandro and Alex 
are here, then let you know our plans. In the worst case, we manage to 
implement some basic compatibility updates and only start a deeper refactoring 
for 2.1. In the best case (if we manage to fully implement something bigger) 
maybe we even ask for a feature freeze break. Tomorrow I'll be able to say 
more.

Btw. Actually the plugin installer already supports the qgis_maximum_version 
at least since QGIS 1.0, only the new repository probably doesn't (yet). There 
is also a small feature in the installer that was useful when we were between 
0.x and 1.0. In QGIS 1.x, the installer only accepts plugins with either:
- qgis_minimum_version >= 1.0
- qgis_minimum_version < 1.0 AND qgis_maximum_version >= 1.0
So if qgis_minimum_version is 0.x, it assumes that the plugin is incompatible 
with 1.x unless the qgis_maximum_version is set. We can either do the same now 
or assume the plugin is compatible unless qgis_maximum_version is set to < 
2.0.

Oh, Alex Bruy isn't coming. So we'll try to discuss it on IRC.

+1
I think this is very important to reduce stress caused by the API and
therefore plugin break.

Hi,

So I've now got drop shadows working for all label components: text,
buffer, and background shape and SVG [0]. I realize this is obviously late,
but the changes also introduce a small container class for temporal
labeling data that stabilizes the API [1]. In this way, the calls should
not change even after most label components are migrated to the symbology
classes (between 2.0 and 2.1) in preparation for a rule- and style-based
setup.

If I can still commit this to master, I'll clean it up and do so today. If
not, that's cool, it can wait. Then, I'll focus on the belated GUI updates
and labeling bug fixes.

What about using "semantic versioning": http://semver.org/

I've been using it lately as it's the default for node.js modules.
It lets you express your requirement in a more powerful way.

As far as I can tell there will probably be a few other API changes during
the hackfest..
So from my point of view there should be all API breakages done before 2.0
release.. Which actually means now..
+1 from me for doing the changes..
And applying the "hard" freeze after the hackfest..

Tim? You have the last word..

Kind regards
Werner

Hi

that kind of versioning has been used by Qt libraries for many years -
and in QGIS we try to do the same thing: v1.0 has defined a stable
API, in further v1.x releases we have only added new functionality,
not removing anything. v1.x.y releases (if any) then contained only
fixes, no API changes.

Hi Martin

Thanks  for that .  Yes I am testing the just the provider, not sure how I could have automated tests for the plugin dialog.  I had thought that the provider was not available as the first test I wrote failed (below).  However I have now put in a test to load a layer, and that seems to pass.

    def test_001_ProviderDefined( self ):
        registry=QgsProviderRegistry.instance()
        metadata = registry.providerMetadata('delimitedtext')
        assert metadata != None and metadata.description == "Delimited text data provider", "Provider metadata is installed"

Incidentally, I'm also wondering where is the best place to document the provider - ie where to document the url parameters that can be specified, as well as (I guess) where to document usage of the UI.  Any suggestions?  At the moment the only location I know of is your  python cookbook?

Thanks
Chris

Are you trying to test the provider or the (GUI) plugin?

The provider can be tested easily by creating a QgsVectorLayer instance with the "delimitedtext" provider string. It is only necessary to initialize QGIS core library which will in turn initialize provider registry (and load all providers). The memory provider test uses a convenience function getQgisTestApp() from utilities.py.

To my knowledge it is not possible to test the plugin:
QgsPluginRegistry is not a part of qgis libraries, it's a class belonging to QGIS executable, so you cannot access it.

The documentation of the URL parameters and valid provider names
probably should be in doxygen documentation of QgsVectorLayer's
constructor as that is probably the first place where developers will
try to look. I am not aware of other places than cookbook where this
information would be summarized - and even cookbook does not cover all
available providers.

Any patch that would add more documentation would be appreciated :-)

I have a feeling that we should call that a bug: the NoGeometry flag
tells that it is not necessary to fetch geometry... so even if the
flag is not set, the feature should be fetched.

Btw. there is one slightly related thing:
"enableGeometrylessFeatures(bool)" function of QgsVectorDataProvider.
It works only with OGR provider and I believe there is not
justification for keeping it around in v2.0. If I remember correctly
we have added it long time ago when all geometryless features were
automatically rejected because other parts of QGIS were not expecting
QgsFeature with NULL geometry - however the situation has changed in
meanwhile. I will remove it.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR84Vud2JoKu6YREr5o3G0semBUmhym+D2=b9Uoc75gtgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just a quick note to anyone using the Mac nightly builds here [0].

I've updated the 10.7-10.8 build machine with the following:

- Kyngchaos.com GDAL Complete-1.9 (2013-03-01, must update your local
install)
- GDAL framework v1.10.0 beta2 installed after GDAL 1.9 (must locally
install)
    IMPORTANT: there are no format plugins for this GDAL version yet (see
blog post [1])
- SQLite3 framework v3.7.16.1-1 installed after GDAL 1.9 (must locally
install)
    note: includes support for SpatiaLite 4.0.0
- GEOS framework v3.3.8-2 installed after GDAL 1.9 (must locally install)
    note: QGIS still reports 3.3.6dev, though
- PostgreSQL client updated to 9.2.4 (bundled)
- Qwt updated to 6.0.2 (bundled)
- QScintilla2 updated to 2.7.1 (bundled)

Thanks to William for providing the framework and library updates. Of note
is the new support for GDAL 1.10 and SpatiaLite 4.0! There is already an
app archive with this setup uploaded.

I've updated the nightly to help provide some user feedback and any bug
reports before packaging, since I would expect similar frameworks will be
linked against for the stable 2.0 release.

For example, it would be good if some power users could test out the GDAL
Tools and SpatiaLite functionality, so any changes can make it into master
branch before final code freeze.

Note: no need for end users to install the extra GEOS 3.3.8-2, all it does is fix something only needed for compiling software that uses GEOS.  There is no change in the binary part of GEOS.

Ok, then it's also misleading. Should we rename NoGeometry to WithoutGeometry
while we still can?

Yes, we could do that. Or maybe IgnoreGeometry?

Recently I have been wondering whether it would not be better to
actually stop using flags and replace them by usual getter/setter
functions. My main concern is the setSubsetOfAttributes() function: it
also sets the flag, so the users may end up with a weird behavior,
e.g.:
QgsFeatureRequest().setSubsetOfAttributes( ["name","type"], fields
).setFlags( NoGeometry )
That would fetch all attributes... because the setFlags overrides the
previously set SubsetOfAttributes flag.
Maybe we can keep the flags, but we should not have the
SubsetOfAttributes there.
Also, the way how things are done right now, providers need to
implement fetching of attributes in this way (pseudo-code):
if using subset of attributes:
  for each attribute from subset:
    fetch attribute
else:
  for each attribute from provider:
    fetch attribute
This is quite annoying, we should probably have a simple array where
each value would indicate whether to fetch attribute with that index
or not (by default all values would be true). The fetching would be
simplified to:
for each attribute from provider:
  if attribute should be fetched:
    fetch attribute

What do you think? :-)

Thanks! However, as we have the symbol_xml2db.py script, I think we can keep 
the xml file just for easier edits.

Hi all,
in qgis web client it is possible to use (via url or theme switcher) a
config file different from GlobalOptions.js ?

What I would like to achieve is to use the theme switcher to publish
themes with different languages,CRS and maybe other things defined in
GlobalOptions.js

Another way would be allow set them in GISProjectListing.js

Is this possible at the moment?

Thanks in advance

Can we be sure that only the xml file gets edited or do we need a
xml2db_symbol.py to avoid loosing updates?

Yes, I've also thought about that, but somehow missed to speak up - but IIRC
(;)) I migrated everything accordingly.

Given that the flags need qualification it's even shorter to use the
getter/setters API-wise.

Don't they just all do:
 
subsetOfAttributes ? mRequest.subsetOfAttributes() : P->attributeIndexes()

Can't we move that to a requestedAttributes() in QgsAbstractFeatureIterator and
just iterate over the result?

BTW what about parallel iterators?  I suppose there were problems and thats why
you added the "active iterators" - do you recall which providers were affected
and how?

Hi Giovanni,

AFAIK this is not possible at the moment, but there is a ticket open for 
a language switcher [1]
If I had several CRS I would create different installations of QWC, you 
cannot access the projects with the themeSwitcher in this case but that 
would probably fail anyways because changing the theme keeps the current 
bounding box which would be of no use if the other theme has a different 
CRS (or is defined for a different place of the world). Could you 
describe your use case for using different CRS for the same place?

As this version uses a new folder ~/.qgis2 for plugins and a new qgis.db and
as I did not want to reinstall all the plugins, I try with  symbolic links
in the .qgis2 folder pointing to .qgis

   ln -sf /Users/me/.qgis/ plugins
   ln -s /Users/me/.qgis/qgis.db qgis.db

and it works (some plugins are no longer valid), same for my lost
customisation

  ln -sf org.qgis.QGIS.plist org.qgis.QGIS2.plist
 
if it can help someone (Mac OS X Snow Leopard, as always, thank to Larry for

I can only confirm Alexandres opinion.
In fact, i gave up using qgis.org as a starting point for anything, but  
directly use google search for "navigation" cause i will get lost anyway.  
And i think i'm already quite experienced within the qgis ecosystem ...  
but newbies?

What is more dynamic stuff? An example for me would be announcements on  
news or changes from core developers or plugin authors. And only a per  
mille of the user subscribe to or read the mailing lists where those infos  
could be available. Would love to see such things on the start page and  
not buried within any outsourced system. I bet this would downsize a lot  
of user requests.

Hi,

I'll try to follow discussion in IRC.

BTW, Paolo, should we use same guidelines for website (e.g. headings formatting) as for documentation? Just noticed that now
some pages used different headings style.

Currently xml2db_symbol.py needs to remove the existing db file, because it 
only can INSERT and not UPDATE records. Of course we can't be sure, so we 
could at least implement UPDATE to avoid removing the records existing only in 
db file, but I can't imagine how to avoid overwritting more recent records with 
older xml data. I don't know if it's worth the effort while it's all in git.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Is there anybody interested whether QGIS 2.0 will
	support non-Latin1 Shapefiles?
Message-ID: <201304121430.43276.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi All,

As most of us know, QGIS 1.8 and 1.9 *in fact doesn't support Shapefiles* with 
encodings other than Latin-1. Assuming that all recent QGIS versions use GDAL 
1.9, *the last usable version was 1.7.3* (at least for windows users in 
Poland). Thanks to the 'ignore shapefile encoding' workaround, QGIS built 
against GDAL 1.9 is at least able to open other encodings, however, the 'Save

encoding selector as well as the layer creating options.

From my point of view it's just an *incredible regression*, as QGIS just 
doesn't support Shapefiles in most languages for a year or so. If there is 
anybody else interested in bringing back support for at least UTF-8 and cp12xx 
in QGIS 2.0 pleeeease join me ;)) and review the pull request:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/492#issuecomment-16282081

Maybe someone have a better solution? Maybe someone can provide the test files 
J?rgen suggested? I don't believe nobody cares whether QGIS 2.0 supports not 
Latin-1 Shapefiles or not.

Hi Borys!

Once I finish the case studies I join you and try to get some test files
from "unusual" encodings

Hi all.
Back from a short meeting with Otto, Werner, Raynold, and Alessandro.
Main conclusions:
* we should move all the nerdy stuff to another section of the site,
quite separate (but readily accessible) from it
* as a consequence, the user website should be even leaner and
simpler, listing only the info really essential for the users
* we need to improve the current script to build up the website based
on current GH, so everybody can see and comment the results
* we need a suitable theme, but we can publish the pages with the
current one until we find a better one
* we *need help* on a small but important issue: adding links to the
table of content, in the form:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :hidden:

    website/download
    docs/user_manual/index
    docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index
    http://plugins.qgis.org

works, but the resulting link has a label "None". Does anybody know
how to add a proper label to it? I tried with the normal rst syntax
`Plugins <http://plugins.qgis.org>`_ but it does not work.
This is a stumbling block for the publication.
* in the meantime, we are migrating content.

Thanks to all.

Message-ID: <20130412155303.7e5158ce@gbdlaptop.speedport.ip>

Hi,

we also had a small discussion about the current translation process and we
think it would be the best solution for now, if we only use the local
translation process and not transifex. We need to find out first a good
workflow, how the conversion between tx and git works without conflicts.

Do we have any transifex/git experts on this list, who can have a look?

Apart from that it would be important to have a look at the documentation
of the local translation process and see if we need to improve this for
normal users, who don't know much about git, github, linguist, .... Is there
someone, who is willing to do that? The document is here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/documentation_guidelines/do_translations.rst

Paolo

Reviewing the website it seems you have two navigation menus, one at the top and one at the left. I would suggest making the only menu the top one

It seems a lot of the features there should be under a common page as it looks right now looks crowded, messy..not good for general users (not developers)

e.g.
Under support could have chat, bugs, questions and all community

I would have

Home
Support or Community
Events
News
Blog (Planet isnt such a descriptive name for persons not familiar)
About

the home page should showcase qgis, maybe visit a few websites you may like and borrow ideas

Finally a wireframe of your proposal, or a dev website for review would be easier to comment than text comments since we have to imagine how it would look

when making a website you first create the visual component maybe using inkscape and once design is final you code it

the site needs to be updated to 2013 standards

my view only, and I also find the current site horrible to navigate and get answers, looks more designed for coders than users

Hi All

Just to alert you to the fact that there are currently 6 failing tests
in Jenkins [1]:

>>> TestSuite.PyQgsAtlasComposition 0.28 sec1
>>> TestSuite.qgis_diagramtest 2.6 sec48
>>> TestSuite.qgis_rendererstest 0.84 sec48
>>> TestSuite.qgis_dualviewtest 0.15 sec48
>>> TestSuite.qgis_atlascompositiontest 17 sec160
>>> TestSuite.qgis_composerhtmltest

It would be really great to get them passing again during the hackfest
if possible so we can release with all tests passing.

Happy hackfesting!

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <CAJBK7JGzZDVjNAQTRdH8SPRhL82PfTYibi9UJhb9oFnd97-e+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I noticed this statement in QgsVectorLayerProperties::saveStyleAs()
method

apply(); // make sure the style to save is uptodate

just after the file dialog launch.
So, every time you want to export a style to a file, qgis applies it to the
layer, losing precedent applied style.
But if the statement is removed, qgis simply crashs :) but I didn't managed
why (in QgsRendererRangeV2::symbol() method).
I'm using part of saveStyleAs() (and related) code to create a qml style
and save it into a postgis db.
Is it so important to apply the style before saving it? Is there any way to
save avoiding to apply?

Thanks,

Hi Antonio,
thanks for your comments; are you referring to qgis.org?
We are building an entirely different structure, based on
http://documentation.qgis.org/2.0/html/it/index.html
Of course we still have many things to fix there.
Your comments and help on this will be much appreciated.
All the best.

Hi Marco, hi Mayeul and Kimaidou

I'm preparing an expertise for a recommendation with national outreach
together with colleague Prof. Olivier Ertz, the main convener of OGC SLD/SE
1.2.
Now I found the SLD QGIS API methods [1] (saveSldStyle and loadSldStyle in
QgsMapLayer and writeSld and loadSld in QgsVectorLayer) from Adrian Weber
[2].
And I would like to use QGIS as one of the reference GIS in this
expertise/study.

Does anybody know about the status of these extensions?
Does anybody know Adrian Weber in order to intergrate the SIP files (in
order to access the SLD methods in a Python plugin too)?

Yours, Stefan

P.S. I hope this is the right place to discuss plugins. Last time when I
asked here about "Status of Plugins to load PostGIS Raster and MBTiles
directly?" I did'nt get any reaction from neither the community nor from
the PostGIS Raster plugin author Maur?cio.

yes I was referring the old one, the new looks just a leaner lest messy one but I think it will work for now. What CMS are you using??

I got a web designer friend who I can ask to give a few pointers, but probably this would be for the next months. I cant code so I can only give suggestions, I will see if I can get some advice for the website though I think something will be needed to be done when a new logo is selected or updated the old one

Hi Antonio,
thanks for your comments; are you referring to qgis.org?
We are building an entirely different structure, based on
http://documentation.qgis.org/2.0/html/it/index.html
Of course we still have many things to fix there.
Your comments and help on this will be much appreciated.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ideas on the SVG symbols library

Hi !

My last email about SVG symbols did not get a lot of answers ;) So I try
again...

I'm still thinking about reworking the SVG library a little bit for 2.0,
but before starting that dull work, I'd like to be sure that there's some
agreement about the best strategy.

I've two variants (illustrated by the screenshot), explained in details
below. Of course the variant 0 (doing nothing at all) also exists

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfdncq9an8i6mc5/comparison.png

Personally, I vote for variant A, excepted if alpha values work in variant
B.

Cheers,

Olivier



*Variant A*
- Remove the backgrounds from every symbol.
- Add the fill, outline, and outline-width params to every symbol.
- Make all symbols initial size the same.
- Add some new SVG backgrounds

Pros :
- very flexible (add, combine, ...)

Cons :
- slightly more complex for beginners
- old project files won't look the same (the icons won't have a background)



*Variant B*
- Add the fill and outline params to every symbol, having the outline param
actually apply to the background.

Pros :
- almost the same than today (so no changes for old projects files and
nothing new to learn)

Cons :
- Its seems a bit wrong to use an "outline" color param, to set a
backgorund color.

Questions :
- Would it be possible to have alpha values in the color selector ? So you
could choose to have a transparent background, and get almost all benefits
of variant A. (I don't know the way the SVG symbols work in the code enough
to try that)


*Variant A&B*
- Run SVG cleaner on all symbols (not sure if there's any benefit, but it's
not much work)
- Remove some word 95 looking symbols (golf flag, backpacker, ... )
- Remove some duplicate icons (same icons with different colors, ...)
- Reorganize some icons ("Symbol" fold is not a very explicit name)

Questions :
- Are the GPS icons part of some kind of standard ? Or is it OK to
remove/reorganize those as well ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding The Selection of Image Type To WMS Setup?
Message-ID: <DC49060A7E430243BF2D4090200661931AE2DFF738@OC1EX201.ME.MBGOV.CA>

Would it be possible to get QGIS modified to allow the selection of the image format type (i.e. PNG, JPEG, or others) in the setup of a WMS connection? The WMS provider specifies the image types that are available using a response to a GetCapabilites request but I don't see anywhere in QGIS where we can select the type of images that we want to get. And it looks like QGIS defaults to the PNG format for requests and I find that PNG files are roughly eight times the size of JPEG images. So defaulting to JPEG images cuts down on network traffic a lot and allows for greater throughput of requests.

Cubewerx provides an image type of "image/x-jpegorpng" where it decides if it needs to send PNG images if we are doing a draw that includes some transparent areas, otherwise it sends JPEG images. This image type is stated in the GetCapabilities response along with the other image types that are supported and if we had the opportunity to select this image type in QGIS then we could get much smaller images most of the time.

We have also discovered that ArcGIS identifies itself through a user-agent string in the header of the request (HTTP method), it sends the following user-agent string: "ArcGIS Client Using WinInet" and Cubewerx has adapted their server to automatically handle the image types that are provided to ArcGIS. Unfortunately we see no such user-agent string provided by QGIS so we are not able to have the server adapted to QGIS image requests. Other clients may need PNG files so we can't have the server force the adaptation of images for every client so it would be helpful to have QGIS provide a user-agent string if we couldn't get the selection of image type for WMS requests.

Thanks,
	Bob Bruce

Paolo  I would suggest 1. To move the Go button to the same line as the search bar, making the bar a bit smaller, you may replace the GO with a loupe maybe, I believe you may just eliminate "Enter search terms or a module, class or function name." as the search bar is self explaining 2. To add a footer to the main template, you can use this part to add some information such as Contact Us, Copyright etc.3. Above the footer or in it you may add social media buttons for facebook and twitter, I believe you use those platforms4.  Maybe a slider of images that showcase some screenshots just like some commercial sites have, just to enhance visually the design and make it more pleasant5.

Hi

I'm writing some test cases in python and want to trap messages sent to QgsMessageLog.  The C++ API docs state that there is a receivedMessage signal emitted by the QgsMessageLog, but it does not seem to be exposed to the Python API.

Can anyone tell me either how to access the message log from python, or how to expose this signal so that I can use it.

Thanks
Chris

Hi all.
This is the last day we'll all be here, so I think we should take the
chance to discuss a few common issues. I therefore propose a series of
meetings:

12:00 GSoC startup and coordination
15:00 plugin management: new installer, infrastructure consolidation,
migration of old repos, rules for plugin acceptance, etc.
17:00 targeted donations & crowdsourcing, QGIS trademark & charity

Alternative and additional proposals are welcome, as well as different
timing.
Place of meeting is the small room we've been working in yesterday.
All the best.

Hi Olivier,

Yes, version A is better - as you more easily add a different background
or combine it with another SVG background symbol.

Thank you for starting this work.

Hi

I really like the rule based renderer.  One thing that doesn't seem easy though is to use the "colour" data defined property, as it isn't clear (and possibly not easy) to generate an expression for a colour.

I am thinking it would be really useful to have a "Colour" section in the function list, with at least two functions - rgb(x,y,z), and ramp(name,value) (value from 0 to 1, or 0 to 100?).  Possibly one more - rgba(x,y,z,a).  Then it would be very easy to build colours from data.

I'm guessing this would be easy to do - any takers?  or pointers to where to implement it?

Cheers
Chris

Hi all.
The work is proceeding well. This is the current state, with a plea
for help:
* the general structure for the users pages is ready; please check it
at [0]; early comments welcome, please consider that it is not
finished yet
* I need to fix formatting of sponsorship and commercial support pages
* Raymond needs to push the Contacts (QGIS Community) page
* the developer-oriented pages are still to be done/pushed (Raymond
will deal with this, help welcome I suppose)
* a stumbling block is the name of the menu entries for external links
(currently labelled as "None"): *please* help us finding a fix for this
* I would suggest, if we can fix all the above, to publish this as the
main QGIS website at the end of the hackfest
* current styling in [0] is nice, but not optimal; I suggest to
improve it, aiming to publish a shiny new version at latest in sync
with 2.0.

All the best.

Hello,

I would like to clarify a bit about the presence of XML, SQlite and the
Python script.

The XML was a the version 1 way of storing the symbols. It had a plain list
of symbols and color maps. In order to include grouping and
tagging functionality in the symbol management  the symbols were moved to
the SQLite DB. The "Python Script" was used to carryout the conversion and
create the required tables for grouping & tagging information.

Once compiled and installed, the user directory only has the SQlite and not
the XML. If you find one, it is the artifact of changing from older to
newer implementation. You are safe to remove the XML file.

However, if you already have a large number of personally created symbols
in the XML, you can,

1. use the script to recreate the SQlite manually and replace the SQlite in
the user directory. Kindly note this is required ONLY ONCE. After which any
changes to symbols you make through QGIS will refelect on the SQLITE ALONE
and NOT on the XML.

2. Simply goto Import/Export options in the Symbol Manager, Click Import ->
Select the XML file in your User directory and import all the symbols. This
transfers the things in XML into the SQLite file and any edits thereafter
reflects on the SQlite ONLY.

Kindly post if you need more clarification.

helping others to help you writing tests?
Or did I already miss that?

No, because it's already there.  If a WMS server offers multiple formats you
can select the one you want in the wms selection dialog.

Supporting that image type shouldn't be a problem.  Everything the server
supplies is passed to QImage and that transparently figures out what format it
is - the format selection is only used to form the request.

Hm, sounds like two new features.  Can you rephrase it as a bug? ;)

We could have QgsNetworkManager set a different or a configurable User-Agent
string.  That way almost all requests should have it - should be easy, but I'm
not sure if that's a good thing for everything - as we also use that in the
form widget and there at least a different user agent string might hurt.

The question is how many different agents, we need - per provider?  per server?
combinations?...

Hi,

I adapted the scripts on the server. According to the cronjob the new
documentation page ist now build 3 times a day.

All web and doc content is build from master branch and additionally the
docs and translations from 1.8 is added.

You find the current status here:

QGIS master doc repo with future website:
http://docs.qgis.org  => links to http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/

QGIS 1.8 documentation:
http://docs.qgis.org/1.8 => links to http://docs.qgis.org/1.8/html/en/

Thanks! Yes, it's exactly what I thought. 

I understand the xml file in the source code should stay, because it's more 
convenient to edit it and recreate the db with the script than to modify the 
xml inside db cells. Last days I've made some fixes and updates to the symbols 
this way.

the website stuff were just dummies in the 1.8 branch, I removed them so
with the next build we will only have the docs "manual" and "PyQGIS Coobook"
available. And maybe even the Cookbook could be removed?

If you look at the script on the server I currently use 2 clones, build them
seperately and copy things we need from the 1.8 clone into the output folder
of the master clone. This makes it quite flexible, if we want to decide what
to show on the website and easy to handle.

And therefore it was not necessary to make many changes to the pre/post
translate scripts, which are not only used on the server but also locally by
doc writers and translators. 

Instead I mostly adapted the build_qgis-docs.sh script on the server.

If you have another or better solution, we can improve it of course.

The implementation should be quite straightforward - you can have a
look at QgsExpression class and the built-in functions it provides.
Creating a function that takes three integers and composes a string
from them should be really just few lines of code.

Should be fixed in master now. This works for me:

def x(txt):
  print "log:", txt

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
QObject.connect(QgsMessageLog.instance(),
SIGNAL("messageReceived(QString,QString,QgsMessageLog::MessageLevel)"),
x)
QgsMessageLog.logMessage("test")

The last command will also print out "log: test"

I'll try, but if not, I will record it later myself and upload it,
probably with better sound quality

Thanks for the interest!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins meeting
Message-ID: <51696867.5020408@faunalia.it>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all.
A report on the meeting about Python plugins we just had:

* the new installer by Borys looks quite nice and it is certainly an
improvement over the existing one; hopefully it will be ready soon,
for possible inclusion on 2.0
* after API freeze, we suggest writing all plugin authors and
maintainers (Alessandro is preparing the list) calling for upgrade, in
order to have them functional again
* we suggest to give a reasonable delay for the fix; after that, we
can decide either to leave them as they are (in this case they will no
longer be installable in version 2.0), or to have a Py maintainer to
fix them; I'm personally in favour of this second option
* we cannot find back the rules we currently use for plugin approval
after submission; they should be put in Governance documents, and
linked both in the Py Cookbook and in the Plugins webapp
* the Deprecated tag is already implemented; it is probably advisable
not to list the deprecated plugins in the XML, so they will be left on
the site, for future reference, but not installable from QGIS; this is
a trivial change to do in  the webapp
* we suggest the plugin maintainer should be responsible for checking
the plugin on submission, approve it if suitable, and add the
Deprecated tag when appropriate
* in the metadata of the plugin we also have a category (Raster,
Vector, Database, and Web), but it is not used; we suggest to
implement a method to add plugins to the appropriate menu, if not
already done in code; this will make life easier for the authors, and
interface more readable for the users
* of 216 plugins available on the new repo, 64 have no code repository
nor bugtracker; 52 also no home page; currently these are not
mandatory; it should be discussed whether to make it so; my personal
opinion is that the desired behaviour is making repo+bugtracker
mandatory, and if the author do not define the, the webapp itself
should create them automatically
* we have 74 plugins in the old repos which have not been migrated to
the new one; I'm sending a more detailed report on these.

The general idea is that plugins are now a crucial part of the QGIS
experience for the users, and we cannot treat them as completely
disconnected from the main project, but we should take some
responsibility for them.

Comments most welcome.

All the best.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all.
This is a list of the plugins available only in the old repo, after
removing those who are superseded by others or otherwise useless:

AutoGCP 0.5
Elevation 0.1.0
Find by Attribute 0.4.1
Forest Management Toolkit 1.002
Image Boundary 1.1
Image show or hide 0.6
ImdAws 0.1
MapSheetAutoGeoRef 2.02
Map Themes Builder 0.1.1
Measuring Vegetation 0.2
MeP 0.01
P2P QGis 0.0.9
PostGPS 0.3
pyArchInit 0.4.3
QgisSRTM 0.1.8
Rectangles, Ovals, Diamonds 0.1.7
scattergramm Identify 0.3.1
SDA4PP 0.201
Spectral Profile 0.7.0
Split Feature 0.1
terralibpglayer 0.1
TMS RAS 0.1
Visibility Analysis 0.1.0
Zip Layers 0.2

Of these, the majority are broken, or of very limited use. I invite
users who need one of these to do their best to have them back,
contacting the original developer and asking to fix them and upload
them to the new repo. Surely a contribution could help speeding things up.
I would suggest anyway to mass import these to the new repo, and mark
them as deprecated, so they would not be installable (see my other
mail). In this way the code will be readily available for those
interested in adopting them and migrate to the new API, or anyway
reusing it, but they will not interfere with the rest. After this, I
suggest to shut down the old repo, with the release of qgis2 at latest.
Opinions?

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Has the blending behavior changed in the last few
	days?
Message-ID: <op.wvhksbm1na7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

Has the blending behavior changed recently? I had created a map with a  
hillshade and a vector style overlaid using "multiply". It looked fine.  
But with today's nightly, the blending mode is applied to the single  
symbol levels of my vector layer which messes up everything. It's imho  
impossible to use symbols with multiple layers if the blending stays this  
way.

Best wishes,
Anita

As far as I'm aware nothing should have changed recently. Are you
seeing this in a composer or the standard map window? Can you please
file a bug with your data & project and I'll sort this out.

	Analysis plugin
Message-ID: <op.wviul3j2na7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

Due to a bug in the GUI, DEM tools are currently unusable with certain  
rasters (those with x/y in degrees and z in meters/feet):  
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7599

In general, DEM tools and Terrain Analysis plugin cover pretty much the  
same ground. Are there plans to remove any of the two or will the both  
stay? I'm asking because I wonder which one to recommend to newbies.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all.
I started cleanup of the wiki.
What sould we do with the old, historic material? A number of pages
are about the release checklist and release specifications for old
versions. Moreover, the list is not complete.
I think this is static information of very little practical use, so we
could either remove it from the web (perhaps keeping it somewhere as a
backup text file), or move it to Governance docs.
The problem in keeping it accessible is that users will get confused
by obsolete information.
Please let me know your opinion, so I can do most of the cleanup today.
Not an huge task once we decided the guidelines.
Thanks.

Hi
In my opinion we should just sum up those information.. Merge all similar
parts to have one (and probably the newest) information.
Make the information "timeless" and delete all old parts..
So it's somehow consolidating and getting rid of old and useless things.

Greetings from the airport ;-)

Agreed: would you classify e.g. release checklist and announcements as
old and useless? Should I delete them, or?

J?rgen,
        Thanks for getting back to me on this. I cannot seem to find where I can select the image type when I connect to my WMS server. Could you please help me to locate this feature?

My WMS server is:
   http://nis.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv.cgi?CONFIG=OIM_MB_-_Orthophoto

My GetCapabilities request returns image formats of:

<Format>image/png</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff</Format><Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>image/gif</Format>
<Format>image/jpeg</Format>
<Format>image/x-jpegorpng</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-anymap</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-pixmap</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-graymap</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</Format>
<Format>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+bxml; bxmlVersion="0.0.8"</Format>

but I don't see how to select these.

As for the user-agent string, we are not seeing anything on the server in the HTTP header to let us know that it is coming from QGIS, however that would not be important to us to know if we could select the image type when we add the WMS layer.

thanks,
       Bob Bruce

No, because it's already there.  If a WMS server offers multiple formats you
can select the one you want in the wms selection dialog.

Supporting that image type shouldn't be a problem.  Everything the server
supplies is passed to QImage and that transparently figures out what format it
is - the format selection is only used to form the request.

Hm, sounds like two new features.  Can you rephrase it as a bug? ;)

We could have QgsNetworkManager set a different or a configurable User-Agent
string.  That way almost all requests should have it - should be easy, but I'm
not sure if that's a good thing for everything - as we also use that in the
form widget and there at least a different user agent string might hurt.

The question is how many different agents, we need - per provider?  per server?
combinations?...

 Agreed! I'm only sorry that I can't devote any time to keeping my old
bsrplugins up to date with changes in Qgis. Some of them (selectplus)
have got that functionality in the core now, which is a good thing.

 Of my other plugins, the popular ones seem to be autosave (which does
regular backup saves of the current project file) and topocolour
(which colours polygons so that adjacent polys are coloured
differently).

 My hope was that autosave functionality would become something in the
core - is this happening?

 topocolour needs a good rewrite for the new symbology plus other API
changes. Any volunteers?

Message-ID: <CANVKczP8YoqFW501Wd=Wdz_4c_7RcUtSo-mKYt=CYruYpFtkSg@mail.gmail.com>

Did I dream it, or was there once a plugin that offered up the layers
of a running Qgis Desktop as a WMS (or some other W?S)?

I was hoping for a lightweight way of offering Qgis maps as a web
service without needing apache and the qgis fcgi map server.

Can't find anything like it now. Did I dream it?

Hey All,

We are starting some really nice looking logos in the logo comp.  There are
a few there that I really like.  We can give feedback and ratings to any of
the logos in order to shape the direction that the designers take.  By the
looks of it only I can comment and rate however once we have a few more
designs and are down to a few styles I can run a poll to gather better
feedback.

At the moment what I would ask is for everyone to have a look over what has
been submitted and send me a email with any feedback you would like me to
give to the designer, remember to include the id of the logo so I know
which one you are talking about.

There is still 4 days left in first round which means we can still get the
designs to go in the direction that we like.

Here a few of my picks:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis nightly crashing
Message-ID: <CAPzumuHDZCecYyCS9gAJG_XbZ9X-DyAgX4k-ZizoU5oUznsu1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Updating from nightly build in Ubuntu Precise today, I can't load my
projects.  Even adding a vector layer in a new project makes it crash.
 The error from terminal is below:

Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_PH]
/usr/bin/qgis.bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/bin/qgis.bin: undefined
symbol: _ZNK10QgsProject13readListEntryERK7QStringS2_11QStringListPb

Everything worked OK since two days ago.

cheers,

nice to see this contest happening.

imo the ones showing a rounded marker inside the Q are somewhat
contextually misleading giving me the impression the product is a web
mapping library ala leaflet :)

Hi Nathan,

I think #64 by Andyzendy would work better if there was a little more space
between the Q and the u. They are really close now.
Also #50 used RGB: 43, 42, 41 which looks more sophisticated than the pure
black in #64.

I also get what Mathieu said about the typical "web mapping marker" and
that it could be misleading.

Best wishes,
Anita

obviously our wiki needs a cleanup, if even our developers cannot find
important stuff in it :)

Do we need Q(uantum) (GIS) in the logo at all?  Most of the logos are just that.

I like the idea in the logo with the curved arrow from alaska[1].  Maybe something
like that around a globe - and if there really need to be a Q the globe and the
arrow could probably form it.

I quite like the idea of having the uantum and GIS bits in the logo but
that is just my personal taste.

I think we need to stick with the Q for branding reasons, but open to ideas.

Just found [1] on [2] - you don't happen to know her, do you? ;)

[2] has also links to shutterstock (whatever that is) - if the arrow in [3]
started in Alaska, we'd even have our Q.

Hi!

I have to say .. Same from me
Thanks for the great Hackfest and the nice discussions - I think we all did
a huge step forward in the right direction.
It was greatly organized and I had a lot of fun finding my way home with
Radim in the night. :)
Special thanks to Matthias for his prompt reaction on every "problem" I
found in his branch :)
And as Alessandro already said .. Sorry for not saying goodbye to everybody
.. I also had to leave early.
Somebody kept me drinking beer .. You know who you are.

Hope to see you all next time!

Just to be sure that work on the new webpage will not get lost I attach the
3 main "topics" we decided in Freemind format to be further discussed and -
converted to a nice looking webpage.

regards
Werner

Hi Paolo,

note that AutoGCP plugin needs also QGIS with AutoGCP library
bundled. This library is unmaintained now and original authors have
no plans to support it.

We tried to adopt this plugin and library to latest QGIS with some
success. But also have no resources to fix existing bugs and
maintain its code.

Moreover similar functionality (image coregistration) now available
in GDAL. It requires some work and improvement but IMO it is much
better to use GDAL than another 3rd party library. Maybe AutoGCP
plugin should be dropped and new one, linked with GDAL should be
developed (maybe based on existing code).

Hi paolo!

well - there should be a release checklist - just to have a list to hold on
to ..
but I guess we would only need one that could be copied and
extended/adjusted as the release cycle is not a fixed one.

You'd have to ask Tim if he'd like to keep the old things - but for me they
are only there for "historical" purposes and can be deleted.
(As long as we have the newest version somewhere)
Probably the latest announcement should also stay (older ones apply to the
same things as above)

But as I am writing this - It could be probably nice to have some kind of
historic page .. but again .. there is already the wikipedia page about
QGIS where all release dates are written .. so .. I'd delete those old
pages of our own wiki ..

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Documentation
Message-ID: <516C02E9.9000601@gmx.ch>

Hi all,

As already mentioned at the Hackfest, I would really like to see a
Python API documentation.

At the moment, there is only the standard API documentation available,
which lists lots of functions, which are available for core development
only, sometimes the signature is not the same (e.g. a method might
return a tuple for two return values in python and take a reference
where it will write the result value into in C++) and it can be, that
some python-specific accessors are available (e.g. attributes as a dict,
constructor as __init__ )

This does not make it very easy to develop python plugins (I'm sometimes
reading sip-Files to know, what I'm supposed to do).

I would propose, we add a second API documentation, targeted at python
developers. I tried today to compile a python API with doxygen from the
sip files. This kind of works and lists only the methods which are
really available, but still in a C++ style (you shouldn't know if it's a
pointer, reference or whatsoever in python). Of course all this stuff
could also be described in the comments, but it would be nice to have
something like the PyQt documentation [1]

Does anybody know, how to produce such an output?
And would there be somebody willing to take over the lead and/or
maintenance for this? It would be a nice thing to have for the plugin
community.

Best regards,
Matthias

>From the logos so far I would vote for #64 or #50, I guess #50 Works better for me it looks a Little better looking the spacing of the letters, but that can be refined in #64, also I like a bit more the tone for #50 plus I like the idea #55 of T-shirt for the Project

Would you consider eliminating  the worst looking ones my vote for worst are #134 #121 #105 #82 #81 #79 #67 #68 #74 #66 #40 #41 #34 #35 #37 #38 #13 #6 #5 I would like to see #64 with a globe within the "Q" very light colors, just to see it that could work #91 for some reason it quite doesn't looks so good the marker withing the Q, looks a Little bit off for me Just my thoughts

Well, I don't like it. First off, I don't get it. At a glance, I have no
idea what it's trying to convey or why there is so much text.

Secondly, I think it is imperative for a logo design to offer a shortened
square aspect, e.g. for an icon. The Q in QGIS obviously lends itself to
this, and IMO works well for it; so I think a design that leverages that
single character will be more versatile, than say one that only works well
for a web site header.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

There is a regression in the Distance Matrix tool:

It only calculates distances for the first point in the layer. It works  
fine in 1.8.

Here is my doodle at a Q based logo that is round and will work well
in such contexts:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postponement of 2.0 API freeze until April 22
Message-ID: <CALCNqkbvDorN35cxLH_sobvujWqym_g7TXmY=qPqkdfTeNkGkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

According to our release roadmap (see below) we should be entering API
freeze today. However there are some bad inconsistencies in the API.
Here is an example from QgsCoordinateTransform:

['ForwardTransform', 'ReverseTransform', 'TransformDirection',
'__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__format__',
'__getattr__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__',
'__module__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__',
'__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',
'__weakref__', 'blockSignals', 'childEvent', 'children', 'connect',
'connectNotify', 'customEvent', 'deleteLater', 'destCRS', 'destroyed',
'disconnect', 'disconnectNotify', 'dumpObjectInfo', 'dumpObjectTree',
'dynamicPropertyNames', 'emit', 'event', 'eventFilter', 'findChild',
'findChildren', 'inherits', 'initialise', 'installEventFilter',
'invalidTransformInput', 'isInitialised', 'isShortCircuited',
'isWidgetType', 'killTimer', 'metaObject', 'moveToThread',
'objectName', 'parent', 'property', 'pyqtConfigure', 'readXML',
'receivers', 'removeEventFilter', 'sender', 'senderSignalIndex',
'setDestCRS', 'setDestCRSID', 'setObjectName', 'setParent',
'setProperty', 'setSourceCrs', 'signalsBlocked', 'sourceCrs',
'startTimer', 'staticMetaObject', 'thread', 'timerEvent', 'tr',
'trUtf8', 'transform', 'transformBoundingBox', 'transformCoords',
'transformInPlace', 'writeXML']


So we have setSourceCrs and setDestCRS - pretty much conforming to the
principle of *most* surprise. I just mention this as an example to go
along with this appeal: Lets extend the API freeze until the 22nd and
spend a few days going over your favourite classes to make sure the
public API is logical and consistent, otherwise we are going to be
stuck making band aid fixes for the next 5 years :-P

Updated roadmap:


1 April 2013 - Feature freeze - no new features in master.
22 April 2013 - API Freeze - no changes to API except where it is in
direct response to broken functionality.
30 April - GUI Freeze and String freeze - no changes to ui or strings
except where required for critical bug fixes. Call for translations.
1 June 2013 - Branch 2.0, code freeze (except for packaging related
changes), call for packaging.
7 June 2013 - Public release of 2.0

Regards

One thing about this logo is to make sure it doesn't look anything
like any other existing mappy s/w logos or any other product with
"Quantum" in the name. Doing a google image search for "Quantum logo"
will show you about 200 different corporate logos with 'Quantum' in
the name!

Hi,

Ftools Union seems broken in Master. The resulting layer does not contain  
areas which are only covered by the second layer. The attribute table is  
also messed up. Can you confirm?

That's right.
Thinking about it again, we should really fix the API before 2.0. It
seems you have ported that correctly (btw. many thanks for that!), but
ordinary users that do not read c++ code will sooner or later struggle
with it. I'm adding that to my todo list :-)

Not really. Usually there's the kind of code I have mentioned above.
In theory we could change it to use the attributeIndexes() call.

Yes we can :-)

> and how?

I have modified providers to have pointers to active iterators because
of two reasons:
1. if the user asks for a second iterator and the provider does not
support multiple iterators, the first one has to be closed - they
would not behave correctly if used together
2. if the layer is deleted for whatever reason, we must ensure that
any iterators that may still exist will be closed - they would cause
crashes otherwise

As of now, all providers support only one iterator per provider
instance. For parallel iterators (N iterators, one thread) we could
have a provider capability indicating whether they are supported or
not. Providers supporting parallel iterators would not close the
previously active iterators - instead they would only keep them in the
list of active iterators.

When we add multi-threaded rendering, things will get a bit more
complex. Providers allowing parallel iterators should be fine - they
will just need some locking of the list of active iterators. There
will be a slight problem with providers allowing just one iterator: in
a different thread we cannot simply close the currently active
iterator (from a different thread) as that would be a run condition. I
guess we will have to define the behavior in the following way - when
the provider is asked for a new iterator, it will:
a. wait for the active iterator to get closed - if it comes from a
different thread
b. close the old iterator - in case it comes from the same thread
This should ensure that the rendering (or processing) thread will wait
until GUI thread finishes what it wants (and vice versa), while still
keeping the current behavior when dealing with only one thread. We
will just need to explicitly assign iterators with the threads that
asks for them.
Btw. the case b is really just a sanity check for invalid code - it
should not happen in production environment - if it does, there is
something wrong with the application logic.

Maybe during the porting of providers to support multi-threaded
environment we will find out that it will be easier to simply update
all providers to allow multiple iterators instead of adding the
support for the case of N threads and one iterator - that is yet
something that needs investigation.

Maybe we should simply remove the updateFeature() function (or at
least clearly document the side effect of issuing a request to the
provider). Because of that request, even if the function worked in the
nextFeature() loop, it would be highly inefficient to update features
in such loop due to the many separate queries to the backend.

Another reason for its removal would be that we do not use it anywhere
in QGIS codebase and it's questionable to what extent it worked before
the new vector API merge. For example, several providers used the same
cursor for featureAtId() and nextFeature(), so the featureAtId() call
during nextFeature() loop would re-create the cursor. Moreover,
although OGR has a separate API calls for featureAtId(), OGR drivers
that do not have efficient implementation of "get-feature-at-id" will
simply fall back to internal "get-next-feature" loop, invalidating the
reading state of nextFeature() loop.

I have commented on multiple iterators in the other thread.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remove editing functions from QgsVectorLayer
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdQY4ifxyMfEFeMEgaiBe1FOD-=GAQ+EOYg5soEY5CpiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

right now, all the basic vector layer editing operations are
implemented within QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer class and the "advanced"
operations (composed of one or more basic operations) are implemented
in QgsVectorLayerEditUtils class. The main class, QgsVectorLayer still
contains editing functions and only proxies them to these new classes.

I think we should probably remove those editing functions from
QgsVectorLayer. The advantage should be two-fold:
1. fewer functions -> easier to grasp and understand the class
2. sometimes people try to call editing functions without editing mode
being turned on: these issues should go away since they would quickly
find out that QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer does not exist if editing is
not turned on.

>From the editing functions we would keep only startEditing(),
commitChanges(), commitErrors(), rollback() as they take care of edit
buffer management. The rest of the functions (addFeatures(),
changeGeometry() etc) would go to /dev/null.

Any comments / suggestions / objections?

Regards
Martin

What would be the API calls in order to add a new feature to a layer and
commit the result?

I asked Jurgen to add the updateFeature a while ago in order to make the
API feel a bit cleaner. My issue was that you could update the attribute
values on the feature but you then still call changeFeatureAttribute for
each attribute which seems really crap.  I really only want to update the
feature and give it to the layer to handle calling the
changeFeatureAttribute calls with the id, index, value stuff.

Hey Larry,

Thanks for the feedback. I had the same feelings but kind of like the
design, maybe just not for QGIS :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Icon theme update
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR93QtBij76vg=ZhS0-=KoPm=5ThY+AxprAxTAu6xqYewA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So, I've pushed a large update to master that condenses down the default
icon theme by overriding it with the gis theme (the theme voted to be the
replacement). I apologize if the change is abrupt, but it needed done with
enough time to edit/fix things before 2.0 release.

I did this in the following manner:

1) Copied the gis theme over the default theme. Any files of same name were
replaced, missing files added. The was done for plugins that also managed
icon sets per theme (grass, georeferencer and ftools).

The state of previous icon theme sets and directory structure are preserved
as a download here [0] (saves switching local or browsing online git repo
to find replaced/removed ones). These can be added back to source
directory, for reference, or not.

2) Updated all appropriate .qrc and .ui files that referenced old theme
paths.

3) Switched some icons to improve consistency (mostly to + and - icons for
table widget row editing)

4) Proofed every dialog I could think of, though I'm sure I missed
something. This was from both running from build directory and from
installed app on Mac.

5) Added some code to ensure any old saved theme choice now goes to
default. No theme support code was removed.

6) Updated CMakeList.txt files to ensure SVGs are also copied on install.


Where to go from here:

* Please, let me know if I made a mistake somewhere.

* We now have a single set of icons on which to work and update. Icons
should be updated, especially those that don't match current theme.

* Moving to SVG can be aided by leaving the getThemeIcon/Pixmap calls and
referencing the file by base name, without extension, e.g.
QgsApplication::getThemePixmap( "pie-chart" ). When using this technique,
as soon as a .png is replaced with a .svg in a .qrc resource file, it is
auto-found, without having to edit anymore code. Let me know if this
approach should be used.

Hi Larry,

What is the summary of this posting?

Does mean that we can use themes in QGIS 2.0?

I like to revive my nkids theme for QGIS 2.0 as option for Mac OS X
QGIS, is this possible?

Thanks.

Hi Folks

Please note that we now need to go into 'hard feature freeze' - we
need to get teh API neat and tidy and finalise the GUI etc. If you
bring new feature patches (even if they are ready to use), they
represent a distraction from the API, GUI and string cleanup work that
needs to be happening over the next month to get QGIS release ready.

Thanks for your understanding in this.

Some time ago, devs voted to move to the 'gis' theme as the default, i.e.
not just the one selected by default but also the only theme supported by
the project. Even after this update, you may notice the icons are still
hodge-podge with inconsistent ones needing work. Due to lack of developers
to maintain multiple project-supported themes, it is best to have only one,
so that a concerted effort can be made to keep it complete and cohesive.

Does mean that we can use themes in QGIS 2.0?

No theme support code was removed, only the gis theme condensed upon the
current default (because many default icons are still used) and old project
themes removed. However, there has been talk of removing all theme support,
but I can't speak to the state of that decision.

I like to revive my nkids theme for QGIS 2.0 as option for Mac OS X

I'm not entirely sure, but to use a different theme than the default, you
will need to add it to the appropriate source directories, edit the .qrc
files and compile the source again. For example, nkids has been in the
source themes directory for awhile, but not choose-able in the gui because
it is not been made part of compiled-in resource system.

I did add some code to push any old saved theme choice over to the new
default, so if you did add a revamped nkids theme, maybe considering giving
it a new name as well.


If I am misunderstanding the current state of decisions regarding the move
forward for icon themes, somebody please correct me (see also [0]).

Hi Larry,

OK. Thanks for clarification.

I understand the decision to have a one theme. That's is fine.
However, I like to do my own compile version with nkids in Mac OS X
later on. Is it possible. I like to see first are the set of icons
needs to be done.

Thanks.

Noli

Dear Borys,

Most of all thanks for your efforts. 

Actually that encoding issue highly affected Korean QGIS users badly and reduced usability. I'm not a developer, however I can help you by testing and giving you test files. Also I'll share your efforts with Korean developers as well. 

Thanks again.

Hi Barry

You can use the QGIS cloud plugin to publish web maps without having 
apache / fcgi server installed on the local machine.

layer.startEditing()
layer.editBuffer().addFeature( feature )
layer.commitChanges()

Anyway if someone wants to add a new feature permanently, it should be
rather done this way:
layer.dataProvider().addFeatures( [feature] )
It's more efficient and it does not mess with the editing state of the
layer (imagine you are editing a layer and a plugin action will commit
all your changes without asking!).

I understand the motivation, but unless we have change tracking in
QgsFeature there is little sense to keep the function. And as J?rgen
has noted, adding such tracking just for this particular function does
not seem right.

IMHO that's not ok.  If the provider doesn't support multiple iterators, the
second on should be rejected - forcing the caller to close the other one first.

As we lost the ability to do featureAtId while iterating a layer, we now have a
couple of places, where stuff behaves strange and it's not really obvious that
it's causes by a setFilterFid request killing a surrounding iteration.

Rejecting it wouldn't cure that, but at least make is show (ok, that's what the
error message does also do that now).  And unless we get the parallel
setFilterFid request back, we'll need to identify and rewrite the looping code.

Please keep the old release checklists for a while - I often refer
back to them. I am migrating the checklist processing into the
governance docs so eventually we can delete them.

You're right - when thinking about it again, it makes more sense to
reject new iterator rather than close the previous one with force. It
should be relatively simple to swap the behavior.

In the other thread (about updateFeature()) I have noted that we
actually never really supported featureAtId while iterating a layer -
at least not in all providers... AFAIK postgis always used only one
cursor. With OGR provider that could work - but maybe just for some
drivers (e.g. shapefile). If I have time I will try to do few tests
how qgis 1.8 behaved.

When porting the code to new API, were there really loops that
combined nextFeature() with featureAtId() ?

Hi,

yes, we definitely should and will write about the activities. Whose blog can
we use? Paolo, can we use yours from Faunalia?

As for Essen I prepared a "Result" section in the wiki. Can everybody write
some notes about what people did during the hackfest. I already started for
things I know...

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/9_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Valmiera_2013#Results

P?teris can you send me the pictures you took from the group? And all
others, if you have some nice photos of the event, please send it to me...

Regards
Otto

 That's just adding a bit more complexity again...

 I think the best solution to my use case would be to find a very
lightweight web-fcgi server (I think they exist) and to run that with
the qgis fcgi server backending it. Then I can be editing my project
in qgis, saving, then doing WMS queries from another application via
that server. I was originally hoping the WMS queries could go straight
to my running desktop QGIS, which would save having to run two
instances of QGIS at once.

 My use-case is that of auto-generating map images into report files,
dynamically based on data. There are report-writing systems for R and
Python that allow embedding of code and graphics created by the code
(see knitr, Pweave). I want to be able to put qgis map images in my
report such that if I get new data I can just re-process the report
and get an updated PDF out.

 another way may be to embed a qgis standalone instance in python code
in the document which creates a qgis map canvas and renders an image
from that...

Hi Larry, 
it's a total surprise to me, since I thought I was following list
intensivly. I remember voting against gis theme, but majority did choose as
default. That's fine, I'm OK with the vote. But I was thinking having the
choice to switch back to classic theme ! 
I submitted both themes to users and all of them in my corp wanted to keep
classical one. By myself, I really have visual difficulties with gis theme
(to much blue-grey, very few pixels to distinguish functions, overly
complicated icons..)
Moreover, I must say I've not been able to fund anything for months in QGIS
project due to the lack of visibility. Please think of us and let us see
more clearly where we can help the projects. 

Sorry for that message, but these last minute surprises really starts to be
a problem to me. 

R?gis

Hi

I can second that. Switching gis theme as default is ok (and afaik 
that's what most people on the list / poll voted), however it needs a 
possibility in the options to switch to the classical theme.

Marco

Don't be sorry, everyone's opinion should be heard. I have mixed
feelings, the old theme seems to kidish but the new one is too gray.
Now is a good time to look at which icons are causing the most issues
and revamp them.

Hi Larry,
it's a total surprise to me, since I thought I was following list
intensivly. I remember voting against gis theme, but majority did choose as
default. That's fine, I'm OK with the vote. But I was thinking having the
choice to switch back to classic theme !
I submitted both themes to users and all of them in my corp wanted to keep
classical one. By myself, I really have visual difficulties with gis theme
(to much blue-grey, very few pixels to distinguish functions, overly
complicated icons..)
Moreover, I must say I've not been able to fund anything for months in QGIS
project due to the lack of visibility. Please think of us and let us see
more clearly where we can help the projects.

Sorry for that message, but these last minute surprises really starts to be
a problem to me.

R?gis

Hi,

Very reduced use of colors in gis theme was intentional.
Colors should be used in come consistent manner.
Blue-gray was just a base. Now we can start adding (with caution) colors.

Central part of icon:
yellow - select, selected object
green - object to be edited
blue - neutral (any context)

Action part of icon (right bottom):
yellow - create, select
green - add
red - delete, remove
blue - others

I know some icons are VERY similar in look, so feel free to propose what 
new color should be used where.
Use this threat if possible please.

regards,
Robert

Personally I'm not a fan of that.

Why don't we make startEditing() return a edit buffer/edit session. So you
could do this:

session = layer.editSession()
session.addFeature(feature)
...
session.commitChanges()

This would mean that everyone can keep their own edit buffers and can do
what they want.  Means you could also doing this:

with layer.editSession() as session:
     session.addFeature(...)

which will commit the features at the end.

But I think this is exactly what the 3rd party code should not be
doing (to automatically create and commit changes). If a developer
wants to do that, they should call
layer.dataProvider().addFeatures(...). It will be faster and it will
not mess the user's edit buffer - IMHO 3rd party code should not call
startEditing() or commitChanges()/rollback() at its will. And the only
case where you may want to use the editing buffer directly is when
e.g. creating a new tool for vector layer editing or something similar
where the user should be able to undo/redo the action performed by the
plugin code.

On the basis that I'm known to have no graphical design sense, the only one so far I'd speak up for is 48.
http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/48

To me most of the rest look like QGIS is some sort of modernist architectural design programme.

-ramon.

And would would those session interact?   Does vector layer render everything
that got added in any session and skip everything that was deleted in any
session?   Can stuff added in one session already be removed in an other?
How would rollback/undo/redo work?

I go for this:

http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/1
18

It is an open source project, hence there should!! be some sort of animal (Q
looks like a bird to me!) presence there in the logo!

 

Cheers

Thanks for the feedback. I had the same feelings but kind of like the

Well, I don't like it. First off, I don't get it. At a glance, I have no
idea what it's trying to convey or why there is so much text.

Secondly, I think it is imperative for a logo design to offer a shortened
square aspect, e.g. for an icon. The Q in QGIS obviously lends itself to
this, and IMO works well for it; so I think a design that leverages that
single character will be more versatile, than say one that only works well
for a web site header.

Message-ID: <20130416123040.65b3b2ae@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear Community,

as you can see from the comments on the mailing lists, the ninth hackfest in
Valmiera was a great success and very well organized by the latvian team
from SuGIS - Maris Nartiss, Peteris Bruns and Raitis Berzins. 

On behalf of the PSC I would like to thank all participants, organizers,
sponsors and donors who spent their time, energy and money to make QGIS
again a little better. 

I added a webpage with information and further links about the people, their
activities and photos from the Valmiera event here:

http://www.qgis.org/en/developer-meetings/valmiera-42013.html

Kind Regards
Otto

I could imagine that something following the idea of
http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/126
would work too.

>From all the submitted ones so far, I'd still go with
http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/50

I don't see any bird in
http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/118and
I don't think it would work well as an application icon.

QGIS has no animal. Do we want one? Or stick to the Q? In my opinion, so
far, the consensus seemed to be that we want to stick with the Q at least.

Best wishes,
Anita

 Hi Barry,

 The use case of generating reports should not require running QGIS 
 server. I think that QGIS desktop should first offer such functionality 
 that maybe later on could be exposed in QGIS server as well.

 Did you look at the Atlas serial printing functionality that was 
 introduced in QGIS master? You can iterate over either map sheets or 
 features. It may already cover the basics of your reporting needs. 
 Combined with the ability to include web-frames and tables in a layout 
 and to use expressions and attribute fields in text labels should be a 
 good foundation of a reporting system in QGIS.

 We in Uster, as well as other Swiss QGIS users have a strong interest 
 in such reporting functionality. Are you coming to the QGIS hackfest in 
 Brighton in September? It may be a good place/time to discuss such a 
 reporting system.

 If you need stuff much earlier - maybe you should talk to Oslandia, the 
 current maintainers of the Atlas serial printing. They did paid work for 
 us in the past and I can recommend them. Of course others could work on 
 that as well, e.g. Sourcepole.

 Whatever you decide about this reporting - please keep me or this 
 mailinglist in the loop, because I think this topic is of general 
 interest.

 Andreas

 Maybe 'report writing' means different things to different people!

 In R, using knitr, you can create an entire typeset PDF document
driven by the data including graphics (and animations...).

 You write a text document with embedded code chunks delimited by
<<>>=/@ tags. Eg

\documentclass{article}
\author{Barry}
\begin{document}

This is a data analysis.

<<read>>=
data = read.csv("datafile.csv")
@

We can plot the data on a graph

<<plot>>=
plot(data$x,data$y)
@

\end{document}

Now knitr can embed python code, and plots created using matplot.
Wouldn't it be nice if that embedded code could be creating map images
in the document from Qgis' wonderful cartographic rendering system?
One way would be for the code to just grab a rendered image from a WMS
server, the other might be to render to an Image using qgis-python in
code chunks of the document.

 I'll probably be running around doing Foss4g stuff - hopefully see
people in Nottingham!

Hi,

Since adding back the old default as a 'classic' theme choice is fairly
straightforward, only taking about an hour to do, I suggest the following:
It isn't done for a couple of weeks.

Here's my reasoning. If we are all looking at only the new default theme
and helping develop that into a complete and cohesive look for 2.0, then
those who are working on it will benefit greatly by the entire dev
community's focus.

I also think Robert's and other's reworking of the default icon set to
address color and useability concerns needs the full focus and support of
the community for it to have a good chance at success. If right before GUI
freeze (~ 2 weeks), the new theme is assessed and there is still a
consensus, or maybe a vote, that there should be a second project-supported
choice, then the 'classic' theme can readily be put back in.

Please let me know what you think of that approach.

Regards,

Larry

Hi,

Very reduced use of colors in gis theme was intentional.
Colors should be used in come consistent manner.
Blue-gray was just a base. Now we can start adding (with caution) colors.

Central part of icon:
yellow - select, selected object
green - object to be edited
blue - neutral (any context)

Action part of icon (right bottom):
yellow - create, select
green - add
red - delete, remove
blue - others

I know some icons are VERY similar in look, so feel free to propose what new color should be used where.
Use this threat if possible please.

regards,
Robert

My 2c. I was also hesitant about switching to the new GIS theme - I
have ~ten years of using the old theme so it was hard to make the
switch. However the last few months I have been using exclusively the
GIS theme and I must say you will get used to it and start to
appreciate it for its visual consistency. I think there are a lot of
benefits to having only one theme - some of which Larry had described
above. Also we will have less 'stuff' in our source tree, QGIS will be
readily identifyable in screenshots, screencasts and publications etc
- it will go a long way to creating a unified image and brand for our
project.

Sure I would like the colours on the icons to be a little brighter and
there are probably other things that can be improved, but I think
having one officially maintained and supported icon set makes a lot of
sense.

Tim

Hi all,
agreed fully; in spite of the logistical challenges of the venue
(Valmiera is the most remote place we had an hf in), everything went
very smoothly, and the meeting was by all means a succes - and a real
pleasure!
Thanks again Maris, Peteris, and Raitis!
All the best.

Hi all, 
many thanks to your efforts to let us know what happened in Valmeria. 
Did you had any discussion on 2.1 Roadmap?
I submitted previously my personnal wishes here [0], do you have any
feedback to give on that? 

Many thanks, ( this will be my basis for next fundings, and priority will
certainly raise for issues where I'm not the only requestor)

Any discussions on colors,icons etc always generate a lot of heat. I hope I
am not being offensive to anyone here.

Personally, I liked the old classic theme and would prefer it to have as an
alternate option. Anyway, putting my disappointment aside, I have started
getting accustomed to the new theme. Here are my thoughts/comments about
some icons from 'gis' theme.

 - pan map, pan map to selection - most apps associate 'hand' icon to
pan..so first time qgis users(having already used other graphics apps) would
find it handy..
 - rotate feature(s) - both icons(classic and gis) are poor. In the gis
icon, the rotation part near the corner is too small to see. Classic icon
was contributed by me..no comments ;)
 - move feature(s) - most apps have icons similar to the classic theme
 - zoom last, zoom next - The left and right arrows are better inside the
magnifying glass as in the classic theme. Also I like how the handles of
glasses in classic theme are symmetrically placed about y-axis making the
two icons complementary
 - Node Tool - very complicated icon in gis theme..only a single point is
shown. If multiple vertices were present in icon, it would be better
 - All Icons in the add layer toolbar - the icons are good..it would be
great if some bright colors can be used for all these icons instead of the
lighter grey for better distinguishing 

hope others come up with better suggestions to make the 'gis' theme better.

Thanks
Vinayan

Hi Sanghee,

your cooperation would be greatly appreciated. Testing and providing
samples would be very useful.
All the best.

One consequence of eliminating the "classic" theme as an option is a lot of
otherwise good, general documentation (articles, blog posts, stackexchange
posts, books) will be crippled.

I'd like to echo what Tim's saying.

I've been using the new theme for a little while too, and am now more than happy to accept the apparent greyness (looks blue-ish to me) because it lets the colours for the rest of the icon stand out - which is to my mind the important part.
(For instance I find myself looking for the new vector layer icon, by looking roughly where all my layer icons are and looking for a small gold badge, which I'm finding to be much quicker)

I'm particularly impressed with the consistency of the icons in the newer gis theme.

It's really nice work.

-ramon.

Hi all.
After participating to several HFs, I'm convinced that a good option
is to held them in a single venue, where we could both hack, sleep,
and eat. I think we can make the organisation much easier this way
(one single booking), thus relieving local organizers from too heavy
tasks, negotiate a good rate for the whole package, and making it
easier to have the hacking timing anyone prefers.
I would suggest future organizers to consider this option.
If this is surrounded by interesting places (I'm partial to natural
areas, but also social environments would be good), this could be perfect.
BTW, Raymond and me had a couple of days cross-country skiing before
the meeting. It would be nice if we could do an active, outdoor
pre-meeting for people interested also for next HFs, a nice occasion
to further strengthen personal bonds within the community and get
fitter before the very long sitting hours of the HF.
All the best.

Yes probably, but other commercial software have made even more drastic
changes and they have survived. The old theme may be familiar for most of
you who have lots of years of experience with it, but newbies would
absolutely don't care. I vote for supporting only one theme and use it for
now on for documentation. If anything needs to be updated to reflect this,
then I think there would be many volunteers happy to do it.

Resistance to change is natural, embracing change is not easy. May I suggest
that the whole now default (and I propose only theme) be completely revised
before version 2.0 is announced. This is because from now on all
documentation should use this theme.

BTW I used the old theme and I completely hated it, too many icons are
misleading, too many icons used for the same purpose and it looked
unprofessional like an unfinished product made by amateurs but that's just
my opinion.

This would limit the options where you can host the event. For example,
hosting it in a university might not offer you accommodation, catering, etc.
But on the other hand, they are more approachable, willing to help with
lesser cost/no cost and generally more space/better facilities for the
event.

Cheers
Saber

Hi all.
After participating to several HFs, I'm convinced that a good option is to
held them in a single venue, where we could both hack, sleep, and eat. I
think we can make the organisation much easier this way (one single
booking), thus relieving local organizers from too heavy tasks, negotiate a
good rate for the whole package, and making it easier to have the hacking
timing anyone prefers.
I would suggest future organizers to consider this option.
If this is surrounded by interesting places (I'm partial to natural areas,
but also social environments would be good), this could be perfect.
BTW, Raymond and me had a couple of days cross-country skiing before the
meeting. It would be nice if we could do an active, outdoor pre-meeting for
people interested also for next HFs, a nice occasion to further strengthen
personal bonds within the community and get fitter before the very long
sitting hours of the HF.
All the best.

Well that's a very valid point.  :^)  With respects to it, I now think the
'classic' theme should definitely be reinstated as an alternative to the
default.

I looked through the number of screen captures and icons in the current
documentation and training manual repos to see how much work it would be to
migrate to the new icon set (obviously not an option for a book). It looked
like a considerable amount of work; enough so that I noticed there are
still screen snaps from much older versions.

However, there are still the benefits outlined by myself, Tim and others on
why moving to a single, new theme to support is a good idea. Towards that
end I'm thinking that maybe the following might now be a reasonable
approach:

* When developing or updating an icon for a 2.0+ feature, only one icon is
made for the new theme, and then copied to the classic theme, i.e. minimal
development time spent on the old theme.

* After 2.0 is released, remove the classic theme from master branch and
only move forward with the new theme. This assumes that between 2.0 and 2.1
many of the screen captures can be updated. Still not helpful for a book,
however.

Thoughts on those ideas?

Regards,

Larry

My views

PAN: the current icon seems more that it will move a feature not pan, I vote
for the hand, that is what the cursor shows anyway 

PAN TO SELECTION: This should really be a right click action not a separate
icon. You would select the feature using the selection tool then right click
(list of actions) pan to selected. This can also be added to the layer menu,
currently it has zoom to layer extent, would it be too difficult to add also
Pan to selection or Zoom to selection

ROTATION: I would say just use the big rotation icon most software have (the
same as rotate point symbol icon), its easy that way to identify the tool
fast. Does anybody know why there is a separate Rotate point symbol icon

ADD Vector, Database, etc icons: I think it was discussed somewhere that
having a single dialog box that address all of them would be considered, to
much space taken up by each case

HELP icon: Do we really need a dedicated icon (lifesaver), the menu on the
top is really pretty much accessible and F1 is pretty universal, this icon
only takes space

In the project menu (don't know how you call the toolbars), I would add
What's this? icon eliminating the help toolbar and in this same project menu
I would add the Add data/raster/etc new dialog if it was changed leaving the
new shapefile, remove layer icons

Touch Zoom and Pan icon I really don't understand its function

Zoom Full extent : Not feeling it

Zoom to Layer extent is already a right click action on the layer which I
believe is more appropriate way of doing it, I would remove this icon to
save space, the same for Zoom to native pixel resolution (I believe this
would apply only to rasters so this icon should be eliminated and just be
present as a right click action on the menu for raster layers

Agree on Zoom last, Zoom next

On the label toolbar, I would just change the rotate label one a bit,
eliminate the square and make the rotation arrow stand out

On the edit toolbar, the arrow in the move feature I would use the classic
move arrow, the current one is more associated with nudge, for the node tool
I would suggest something more similar to Inkscape

I would also have the zoom and selection on the same toolbar

On another note, can the tool bar have names on the top when undocked and
can we close them using a (x) on the corner? That way I could have reference
the toolbars in a better way

Sorry for all my comments

I would go for that also, #50, can we also ask the designer to add a world
inside like #126 in a lighter shade of grey and see how it works.

In my view #50 would be a great logo as it is for the project and then the
"Q" part can be used for the desktop icon and make some great looking
t-shirts like shown in #55. This looks modern, professional and conveys what
QGIS aspires. I would also suggest that logo colors be used in the icon
theme where possible once the final logo is approved to have some
uniformity.

#201 #200 #199 don't look GIS related
#198 looks like a copy of #50
#196 #195 #194 looks, well something else
#192 looks aweful
#191 #190,#186 look to simple
#187 #185 #183 #182 #181 #180 #178 #177 #176 #175 #171 #170 #169 #168 #167
#166 #165 #164 #163 #162 #161 #160 #159 #158 #157 #156 #155 #154 #153 #152
#151 #150 #149 #148 #147 #146 #145 are just ugly 


I think #126 has some potential but I wouldn't vote for it myself, #118
would work well for a desktop icon I guess and #50 is what I am favoring
right now, most people call Quantum GIS just QGIS anyway now and this logo
kind of reflects it by making it more prominent

I like the http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/50 entry, but I would like to see it with the "GIS" slightly smaller so that it is not on the same line as the top of the "Q". This would make the "Q" element of the logo/name more prevalent and would make the "Q" as a standalone icon for the application more identifiable, in my opinion.

Regards,
John

Of course, it is a suggestion, not a requirement.
Obviously you do not have to bother with this if you have already organised
differently for the next HF in Brighton.

That's what I thouoght, but it proved wrong. We need just a room with connectivity,
and most hotel can provide it at low cost, maybe even for free, especially when
bundled with 20-30 rooms booked for 3-4 days. In the last day of the Valimera HF we
had a very nice room, with good wifi, for free, quite convenient, as we could stop,
sleep, eat, and work at will. Saving the transfer from the hotel to the hacksite
makes things easier and more productive, IMHO.

All the best.

All the best.

+1 for #50. I like also #57, the same but with a background. Both can be
used in different contexts.

I think most users would figure out the difference, though I guess it
would be confusing for complete newbies. Since GIS 2.0 will ship with
the GIS theme activated by default (and it would show up on all
computers as default since QGIS 2.0 has a discrete settings archive)
having or not having the old theme won't make any difference to the
user's out of box experience. You would need to go back to old
materials and instruct the user to switch themes in the options dialog
before those materials  could make sense to them.

There should be no need for this - if the new theme is the default any
other theme should fall back to it if an icon is not present (assuming
the original logic I wrote for that has not since been removed).

Personally I think that just defers the problem.

Does the patch also fix symmetrical difference? It's broken as well.

Hi Marco,

Hi,

I know this thread has been silent for a while but I think it's important to
bring it up once more.
I'm currently trying to develop some materials and wondering if they should
cover ftools/GDAL or Sextante mainly. Currently, it sounds like it is
certain that Sextante will be around in future versions while the future of
ftools/GDAL tools is less certain. 

I don't care much about ftools. I don't like having to create new Shapefiles
every time I run an algorithm. I never managed to remember which tool is in
which submenu.

In case of GDAL tools, I see the advantage of being able to copy the GDAL
code.

In Sextante, it's easy to find the tools by name and the results can be
temporal layers. So I strongly disagree with previous arguments that
Sextante is not valuable from a user perspective. 

Even if we don't reach a consensus whether both menus and toolbox should be
around permanently, could someone please confirm what will be the situation
in 2.0? Are there any plans to remove anything for the release? Have any
decisions been made for after 2.0 yet?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

If I can give my opinion,

I don't dislike #50, but I think that that isolated Q won't be strong
enough as an Icon.

I believe that #91 and #88 (short and long version of the same design)
would look quite distinct and sophisticate, would give a great program icon
and looks very good printed too.

http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/88

I believe that 2.0 deserves a brand new logo, so any of the old logo
revamped styles (like #166, #49, #42) don't seam to be a good option.

I agree. Sextante makes finding the appropriate tools a lot easier,
specially when the user is doing GIS analysis for a long time.

In ArcGIS 9.1 or 9.2 ESRI removed the Analysis tools from Menu and put them
all on ArcToolbox. A lot of users complained and they ended up creating a
Geoprocessing menu with Intersection, Union etc. Perhaps something similar
could be done in QGIS.

My opinion on this (clearly biased, of course), is that the argument
of not making sense to look for algorithms under a menu called
"sextante" is not a very strong one. First, the menu is called
"Analysis" (which makes much more sense that looking for processes in
something called "vector", since that is much more generic....).
Second, I think that SEXTANTE is not much different than GDAL or
GRASS, since they are all acronyms.

But, as I said, I have a biased opinion...and I might be too used to
the name :-)

All ideas (thanks Anita for your ones!) about what is missing in
SEXTANTE to fully replace those independent plugins, are welcome

Regards
Victor

Actually, I think I prefer this #88 entry upon second review. I agree with your point that the Q icon is more distinct. This also has the  "GIS" portion of the logo reduced and offset from the top horizontal line of the "Q" as I was suggesting for #50. I also like the flow of "uantum" off the tail of the Q. Lastly, it looks like a Q.

Yes please thanks Marco - eventually I would like all governance stuff
to come off the wiki and reside there so it is properly curated.

 I don't think the Q is Q-y enough, and is a bit detached from "uantum".

 If I could draw cartoons, we'd have Quentin the Qgis Quokka:

Anyone for 84? The styling of the Q looks like roads or other map waymarkings:

I personnaly prefer #50 than #88, because 88 uses a too much seen point of
interest logo : used by Google, used by many open source maps, etc. It
won't say "hey it's QGIS", it will say "Hey, its 'geolocation'"

I kind of like the 84 too, as it remains simple but meaningfull

For me the designs from Dewa (#91, #88) and Andyzendy (#50) look best
so far. I also like the recent addition #205 because of the modern
icon design.

+1, same for 91
I think so far #50 and the right part of #117 are my favourites.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] wrong transformation of project on qgis 1.9.0
Message-ID: <CABqTJk8gnzeUexZ7+_xTK4+0Vhy=J8SDTCqfkLnoggfxMQeEgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a 1.8.0 qgis project and try to open with the new qgis-dev version
of qgis.
To see how much compatible it will be with the next released version of
qgis.
Unfortunately I see it is pretty drammatically unusable.

Infact In the "old" project I have many projects where often the layers are
rendered with a "unique value" style of old symbology.

The reason to have used the unique value rendering is that it allow the
usage of the empty value as a conditional "all the other values".
And this is a "must" in the rendering in our usages.

But when I tryed to load this project with the new qgis dev I see that it
change from the "unique value" to the "categorized" style.
What a wrong choice !
Infact it don't allow the use of empty as "all the other" but use the empty
as only "empty" value :)

So I see all our objects simply disappeared from our project.

I guess when import from 1.8.0
qgis should use the unique value for the old unique value style.

And I guess this is a really blocking issue because
actually the qgis is "heavily" changing the qgis 1.8.0 project.

Regards,

Andrea.

Please file a bug report and attach a sample project.

Btw. the "unique value" renderer in old symbology is equivalent to
"categorized" renderer in new symbology. It is not clear to me what is
actually wrong with that. Maybe just a terminology problem? (it has
been suggested once or twice to do some renaming of new symbology
renderers, but I am not sure if any consensus was found).

Hope the final gis theme looks not so foreign (aka "odd looking") in
the Mac OS X.

Gis theme looks nice in Ubuntu.

Hi,

I like #185 also, #50 is good but it is too linear IMO I don't know if it
looks fine for other context (splashscreen, web page, desktop icon etc).
Also I think #91 and #88 are misleading for a GIS desktop application.

There might be a way to make most people happy here.

I find the vector menu a nice ui shortcut for useful functions. If sextante
relevant functions are at par (or better), couldn't the vector menu items
stay, which would please many, and when clicked triggers sextante's
function dialogue? Victor? Same thing could happen with vector menu too.
Sextante's analysis toolbar is super useful but might be a throwback for
some if vector / raster menu functions disappear.

On human resource (coders and testers) and maintenance angles, keeping to
mechanism to do same thing is an obvious waste.

I see. So you'd suggest to keep only Sextante code (where duplicates
exist!) but provide shortcuts from the menu? I'd +1 that.
I've been testing a variety of functions in the menus and in Sextante over
the last days and there are always some broken ones. Neither "package" is
without major bugs today.
We need to get it together for 2.0 and that's easier if we can focus on one.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Discussion] Repository and Plugin idea for Google
	Summer of Code
Message-ID: <CACbtZwTKM9VQ6HMpUF25YR6E271VLQXMcV_UOs2L_osW_AtWoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been going through the Google Summer of Code 2013 ideas page [0] and
I think the remote repository for style/svg/script sharing proposed by
Alexander Bruy would be a nice follow up of my last year work on the Symbol
management.

Here are a few things that come to my mind:

0. The foremost point is, instead of a plugin to handle the fetching and
importing, we could implement them in the parts concerned directly. Eg.,
style import in style manager, sextante model/script importer in sextante
..etc

1. Since we don't have a repository, last year I just made a way to input
the XML url in the symbol Import dialog and fetch the symbols. The idea is
to add an option to get the symbols from the central repository with their
groups and tags and import them individually or based on individual groups
or with a specific set of tags.

2. The Django application with REST API must be with an user authentication
layer, should be install-able and configurable for organisations to host
their own servers.

3. The base URL for the remote server can be kept changeable in the
application options, so organizations can point it to their servers.

I might have missed a few obvious points. Kindly discuss and help to
improve the idea. Thank you.

Hi all.
My proposal:
* leave the duplication for 2.0
* go towards removing it for 2.1, *only* when a full testing framework is in place,
and we are *sure* everythiong is working properly
* leave shortcuts for the most commonly used functions (maybe a poll can help here),
and possibly an option "add to shortcut menu" for the user
* leave the commandline available for the programs that allow running it straight
away (gdal, grass, saga, ?), so users can reuse them in scripts etc.
All the best.

Anita, yep, remove code for ftool functions that are in sextante but keep
vector menu shortcuts.

I quite like the visual metaphor of the magnifying glass that is used
in #216 [1]. It conveys the idea that this is a tool for seeing things more
clearly and answering questions, and the simple dot in the centre is a good
vector allegory. Perhaps the implementation could be improved, but it's on
the right track for me.

Paolo, imo decision of looking into this option for 2.0 vs 2.1 should be
primarily driven by quality. If qgis can offer better  quality in vector
functions by maintaining the two mechanism for 2.0 then it should be
deferred to 2.1. If the opposite is true, then might be worth for Victor to
weight in and state whether such proposal can be achieved for 2.0.

Hi,

personally I think that we should leave only SEXTANTE but first need
to implement all missed functionality.

Agreed, having such functionality in SEXTANTE will be great and not only for GDAL but for all command-line tools. And AFAIK something
already here ? executed commands available in history manager.

Regarding keeping menu entries, maybe it is better to allow users create own groups in SEXTANTE toolbox and populate them with various
tools?

Maybe it is better to allow enter several URL's at once like in

Hi all,

for a course I am about to give tomorrow I played a bit with SEXTANTE, 
although I am going to teach geoprocessing with fTools (we are using 
QGIS 1.8). It was my first go with SEXTANTE and I was about to show what 
it will offer in the future. Therefore I built a small model with three 
input layers a buffer and two overlay operations. I did not succeed in 
running the model so I tried in current master.
As it currently is SEXTANTE is not operable for me (or I am doing it 
wrong): First message is "Layers do not all use the same CRS...." 
although they definitely do and the same EPSG-code is noted in square 
brackets behind each layer name!? Second I get an "Error executing 
algorithm..." it seems as SEXTANTE cannot use PostGIS layers as input 
(when I save them as shape files the model runs perfectly), this is a 
big limitation as my institution stores almost everything in PostGIS. 
(SEXTANTE should not offer PostGIS layers to choose as input layers then).

Well, this was a very disappointing experience because additionally QGIS 
was frozen two or three times opening or closing the model. I do not 
want to complain, all I want is to ask for keeping fTools as they are 
until SEXTANTE can _really_ replace them in all aspects. Then we should 
remove the vector menue completely because I agree that finding the tool 
you are looking for is a lot easier in SEXTANTE.

my 2 cents

Bernhard

But current documentation is for QGIS 1.8, so I think this is not
big issue.

I am sorry to hear about your bad experience. Could you detail a bit
more about what you are doing (algorithms you are running, etc)?.
PostGIS layers should work without problems, but I have recently fixed
a problem with PostGIS when using SAGA algorithms, so there might be
other issues like that.

If you want, you can send me your layers and model, so I can have a
look and try to find out what is happening

Many thanks for your collaboration (and patience)

Victor

Hi Victor,

thank you for your quick reply and even more for all the work you are 
doing for SEXTANTE. If it is operable (and I am sure, it will be) 
SEXTANTE will be a big step forward for QGIS!
I am going to send you the model an layers (as shape files, you need to 
import two of them into PostGIS) in a PM. SAGA is not installed on my 
machine.

I like the idea of allowing menu entries to be defined from SEXTANTE
algorithms, as a shortcut to them. If we agree on that, I could start
working on it.

Thanks everyone for you ideas!

I agree with allowing the user to define some Menu entries. As an end user
I'd rather have all Analytical tools in one place, but this would allow
people "to not loose their habit" of calling some more commonly used tools
(I agree with Paolo, a poll with be good) from the Menu.

Sextante is more stable in the areas where there more users. This can only
be solved if more people step in for testing or when the full testing suite
is completed. In any case, Sextante is the single most powerfull GIS
analysis tool out there, including proprietary software. It's a huge
undertaking and it is being carried by very few people. I wish there were
more people contributing to the code and testing it.

Hi,

I have an osgeo4w installed Qgis 1.9 in windows xp. Is there any way i can
see the log console?

When i used to run in it from ubuntu build, the './qgis' command used to
show all messages in the terminal? can something similar be done using the
osego4w install?

Thanks
Vinayan

You should be.

I tested myself and I believe you found a bug.

You should be able to add a new class without any value, and all values
outside the existing categories should be rendered with that symbology.
Thats how it works in 1.8.

I'm not being able to open qgis.org (probably is under maintenance), but if
there is no issue ticket for this problem, we should create one.

Yes. A better way to do. I already see a use case,  get symbol from a
central repository (eg QGIS official) and have the scripts/models from the
local repository (organisation localhost)

Try setting the following env vars in system properties:

QGIS_DEBUG 1
QGIS_LOG_FILE c:\blahblhablha.log

(Untested by me)

Exactly. We're just working with Alex on refactored plugin installer and I 
still think about some reusable widgets and logic. Unfortunately I see too 
many differences between plugins and 'static' stuff to make it as closely unified 
as I wish. The present Manager uses QgsDetailedItemDelegate for the plugin 
list items. I'd love to modify it to something like in KDE installers:

http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kde-runtime/kcontrol/icons/get-new-theme.png

But actually it seems to be much more appropriate for styles than for plugins, 
where I incline to a simple list + a html area with metadata.

http://tmp.borysjurgiel.pl/manager.png

Anyway, now we're trying to manage to make changes necessary to merge the 
installer into manager in this very short time left to 2.0 freeze, so guess 
there is not enough time to discuss unified look and feel now. We have to to 
push it as it is, and as soon as the styles/snippets installer development 
starts, we can discuss further unifications.

Your own ubuntu builds?  I think the packages are built without QGISDEBUG, so
no debug output there either.

Anyway, on windows the output goes to the debugger - without a debugger you can
see the debugging output with DebugView[1] and the qgis-dev package is built
with QGISDEBUG.

Hi Tim,

It caused a crash when i started the application. It created an empty log
though in the specified log path.
I was hoping there would be a live console

Hi all,

just want to inform you that Victor was able to solve my two problems. 
Number 1 (CRS missmatch) was kinda my fault (or let's say the fault of a 
former QGIS version where my project originally was created in: QGIS did 
compare proj4 definition and picked the first CRS the definition of the 
layer matched. As EPSG:31464 and EPSG:31468 have the same proj4 
definition but the first is deprecated it was chosen, although my layer 
is defined as EPSG:31468 in geometry_columns)
Number 2 (no PostGIS suppport) was fixed in master

Bernard's problem was related with using non-file layers in the
modeler. It was a very easy fix, so please, everyone that's using
SEXTANTE, share your problems so we can work on them and make the
software more stable. :-)

Thanks in advance!

Wouldn't it be good to have SEXTANTE as category in the bug tracker 
(like fTools and GDAL tools)?

Wouldn't it make sense to translate  the old style into a rule-based
renderer? There it's easy to define a style for "other".

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.9 and SpatiaLite 4 problems
Message-ID: <62A0E1111966D94E8C70621664D1A1D3079334@itdbisexchmbx1.nd.gov>

If I try to create a new SpatiaLite layer called soils in a new database, I get the following error when I click OK:
soils is an invalid layer and cannot be loaded.
I also tried to create a new layer in both existing version 3 and 4 databases and get the same error.

This on OS X 10.8.3 with nightly build for Lion and Mt. Lion with GDAL 1.10 and SQLite 3.7.16 (includes Spatialite v. 4.0) from KyngChaos.com. Does anybody have this problem on other OS?

Running a pyObjC program that loads SSURGO data into a Spatialite database. The spatial layers in the created SpatiaLite 4 database can be imported into QGIS and appear to display correctly. However, DB Manager shows the spatial layers as tabular data. After using spatialite_convert to convert the database to v. 3, DB Manager correctly displays the spatial tables. Given this, I think that the sqlite framework from KyngChaos is working correctly and that the problem is in QGIS.

I don't know how worked the old unique-value on old-simbology.

Bat I guess it quite hard in the rule-rendering reproduce the
"other not otherwise defined values". Surely not impossible, ma quite
harder almost manually write it.

Infact every rule is filtered indipendently from other values on the
datasource.

In a rule-render is easy to write a rule like "every value",
but to reply the "otherwise" is necessary to create a filtered rule tha has
every other definided value.

So as example:

if i put:

rule 1)  value = "0101"
rule 2( value = "0102"
rule 3) value = "0103"
...etc...

the "otherwise" condition in the rule-render should be something like:

(value <>"0101") and (value <> "0102") and (value <> "0103") and (value <>
"0104") ...etc....

Andrea.

Well since I can't code I can help with the testing, just point me where to start and I will try Sextante?

As an end user I'd rather have all Analytical tools in one place, but this would allow people "to not loose their habit" of calling some more commonly used tools (I agree with Paolo, a poll with be good) from the Menu.

Sextante is more stable in the areas where there more users. This can only be solved if more people step in for testing or when the full testing suite is completed. In any case, Sextante is the single most powerfull GIS analysis tool out there, including proprietary software. It's a huge undertaking and it is being carried by very few people. I wish there were more people contributing to the code and testing it.

Get Qgis Master, randomly (or deliberately) choose tools that you know how
to use and run them. If they don't work as expected, report a bug:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/sextante/issues

When I have enough time, I do my regular work using Qgis Master and report
the bugs that I find.

Hi.
The previous behaviour was much faster by all means however.

Hi all.
I like the way this discussion is going.
I suggested to postpone the removal of "old" commands because I think
there is still a lot to do in Sextante, and it would be risky to
remove well tested tools too early. Furthermore, it is still
comparatively easy to break some functionalities with small changes,
so until we have a proper, automatic test at every commit, I would
prefer to rest on solid ground.
If things change in the next month or so, I'd be the first to support
Sextante (as I've always been).
All the best.

yes, nice idea - be careful not to generate confusion with existing
tools; perhaps this can be done by adding a sextante minilogo to the
icon for the tool.

Yes, it should be more evident to the user, and easier to copy-paste
to be run from the shell without modification.

Let me just note that I'm not so sure how solid our ground is. E.g. ftools  
union tool used to work fine and is broken now. Same with ftools distance  
matrix.

+1 for keeping the vector menu.

I think it is best to have maximum algorithms available in c++ ap,  in the
analysis module(i see that some are already available)..I would be willing
to contribute to it if required

thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Does Sextante Field Calculator support all
 functions of attribute table field calc?
Message-ID: <op.wvpc4fppna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I have a polygon layer with an "area" field and want to calculate $area /  
"area". This works well in attribute table field calculator.

If I try to use Sextante Field Calculator, the resulting field contains  
only NULL values. Is this supposed to work? Is this a bug you can confirm?

Best wishes,
Anita

J?rgen,
	After consulting Cubewerx yesterday, I realized that we weren't seeing the image types because QGIS wasn't reading the default version of the Cubewerx GetCapabilites document.

The Cubewerx default OGC version is 1.3.2 which has request section headers like: 
<Operation name="GetCapabilities">
<Operation name="GetMap">
<Operation name="GetFeatureInfo">

Version 1.3.0 of the OGC GetCapabilites document has request section headers:
<GetCapabilities>
<GetMap>
<GetFeatureInfo>

I managed to force QGIS to read the GetCapabilities document by adding the string &version=1.3.0 to the end of my URL. Once I did this then I saw four image types appear as options:
PNG JPEG GIF TIFF
I did not see an option for the encoding image/x-jpegorpng that Cubewerx is offering.

So I have two questions:
1) will QGIS soon accommodate a OGC GetCapabilites format version 1.3.2 document?
2) will it be possible to have the image type of jpegorpng allowed to be used?

Having 2) accommodated will allow the server to decide if a PNG file is needed in areas where part of the image is transparent and send JPEG images where no transparency is required. The PNG images are roughly 8X larger than the JPEG images so accommodating this image type would reduce network traffic significantly.

Thanks,
	Bob Bruce

J?rgen,
        Thanks for getting back to me on this. I cannot seem to find where I can select the image type when I connect to my WMS server. Could you please help me to locate this feature?

My WMS server is:
   http://nis.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv.cgi?CONFIG=OIM_MB_-_Orthophoto

My GetCapabilities request returns image formats of:

<Format>image/png</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>image/png; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff</Format><Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>image/tiff; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>image/gif</Format>
<Format>image/jpeg</Format>
<Format>image/x-jpegorpng</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-anymap</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-pixmap</Format>
<Format>image/x-portable-graymap</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="PaletteColor"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="RGB"</Format>
<Format>application/x-cubewerx-wkb; version="3"; PhotometricInterpretation="BlackIsZero"</Format>
<Format>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</Format>
<Format>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+bxml; bxmlVersion="0.0.8"</Format>

but I don't see how to select these.

As for the user-agent string, we are not seeing anything on the server in the HTTP header to let us know that it is coming from QGIS, however that would not be important to us to know if we could select the image type when we add the WMS layer.

thanks,
       Bob Bruce

No, because it's already there.  If a WMS server offers multiple formats you
can select the one you want in the wms selection dialog.

Supporting that image type shouldn't be a problem.  Everything the server

Hm, sounds like two new features.  Can you rephrase it as a bug? ;)

We could have QgsNetworkManager set a different or a configurable User-Agent
string.  That way almost all requests should have it - should be easy, but I'm
not sure if that's a good thing for everything - as we also use that in the
form widget and there at least a different user agent string might hurt.

The question is how many different agents, we need - per provider?  per server?
combinations?...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating context help and translations
Message-ID: <1759273385.172417.1366233209066.JavaMail.root@s-101-LINZ>

Hi

Just wondering what the procedure is for updating context help (in this case for delimited text plugin).  I can update en_US version, but sadly I'm totally incompetent for any other options.    So question is when translations are being done, how should the other versions be handled.  At present there will be an out of date (ie largely correct but much less informative) help file there.  But for a lot of users it could be more useful to have the en_US version with the extra info.

So is there a way of flagging that the other files are out of date (ie candidates for retranslation).  Or do translators look at everything anyway?

Thanks
Chris

Unfortunately no flagging ..
The only thing you can do is a pull request for the en_US version and than
hope that a translator sees this pull request and will update also the
other language files ..
but currently the field of context_help translation is not such good
covered as GUI or Documentation translation ..

kind regards
Werner

J?rgen,
	Thanks, that's great.

I upgraded my QGIS and I was able to connect to the WMS and see the image types without adding the &version=1.3.0 string and I did see the JPEG/PNG selection. When I selected that type and drew the whole area I did not get an image that had transparency so the underlying image was now showing where blank areas appeared. When I select JPEG/PNG is QGIS selecting an image format specified by image/x-jpegorpng or is it specified by something else? I am wondering if I should be looking to the server for the problem or looking to QGIS.

Thanks,
	Bob

Hi Bruce,
how about funding these developments?
All the best, and thanks.

All fTools functions are in Python. C++ implementation in analysis
lib needs review and maybe some refactoring to support selected
features and memory layers.

Hi Anita,

Field calculator in SEXTANTE is very simple calculator based on
Python eval() function. So it allows only basic math with native
data types and some string operations (like concatenation).

Seems we need to improve it and add QgsExpression support.

BTW, there is also Advanced Field Calculator that should allow
calculate area and perform much more complex calculations

I really don't understand the love for #50. It either reads as
GIS-uantum, or QGIS-uantum or on third inspection QGIS-Quantum. Its
impossible to read it as "Quantum GIS". I can't think of any other
corporate logo that is that unreadable - except maybe CNN which I
sometimes parse as CMI :). #64 from the same designer at least gets it
in the right order, but the skinny 'uantum' looks uneasily perched on
the 'GIS'. Take that away and all you have is a circle with a triangle
trying hard to be either a very fat map pin or a Q.

 Have a quick google for something like "best product logos" and you
should see that ease of readability of the product name is paramount.
If you can't look at a proposed logo and instantly see either "QGIS"
or "Quantum GIS" then that logo fails. Anything that typesets the Q of
Quantum radically different from the "uantum" such that they just
don't work together, fails. Of course a very clever designer can bend
or break these rules, and especially with an already-recognised brand
(eg CNN again) where the logo (word) part of the design is less
important than it's visual recognition as a wordless symbol. Any
squiggle of parallel lines with that same curvature and style looks
like CNN.

  I think the problem overall is the tension between getting "qgis"
and "quantum gis" in the same logo. I think I would prefer to see a
logo that uses the full name (Quantum GIS) but with a stylized Q
device that isn't part of the readable part of the text, e.g.

http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/233
http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/238
http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/165

http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/43

Now I'm not saying any of these are good/bad/indifferent, but they all
show the style I prefer - instantly readable 'Quantum GIS' with a
separate "Q" that can be stylised as a recongisable mark.

Ah, the joy of aesthetics... Feel free to ignore any of the thoughts
above, its just the way my synapses are responding!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] malloc error in nightly build in Ubuntu precise
Message-ID: <CAPzumuFju2rhN9xp5yKZNpSZARSGJxqdUdfrGZ2VJ_aXH5uE-g@mail.gmail.com>

Updating the nightly build with Ubuntu Precise today, QGIS freezes at
the splashscreen.  Terminal reports:

*** glibc detected *** /usr/bin/qgis.bin: malloc(): memory corruption:
0x00000000027bf4b0 ***

cheers,

Hi Bruce,

Yes, it's requesting image/x-jpegorpng, but some servers complain about the
TRANSPARENT parameter, when jpeg is requested and therefore QGIS was not
adding that, when the image type contained jpeg.  Obviously "image/x-jpegorpng"
also leads to that behaviour.  01e26da9f fixes that.

Hi Borys, we use QGIS compiled with GDAL 1.7 on Debian Squeeze and
Ubuntu Precise, so we are currently not affected with this regression. I
agree, it is total show stopper us too (Slovak and Czech rep. -
windows-1250).

I will prepare some shapefile in windows-1250 and utf-8 for testing.


For a reference, here [1] is a blog post describing this problem.

Hey all,

Could everyone please fill in this quick survey about the logos that you
like and dislike.  Any common logos in the dislike section I will remove so
we can reduce the sample set.

I am trying to get it done for the GSoC. I would contribute otherwise too.
My course completes this year, so why waste the opportunity GSoC provides.

I have now noticed the #7.

http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/7

I do not like it right away, but I think it has the right principles. The
original\actual logo has an north arrow or a compass needle, we could pick
on that. This logo, has clearly transformed the Q into a compass. A few
changes to incorporate the word "Quantum" in the same color as the Q and it
could work.

Using a strong yellow for q, it could became a revamped (more "modern")
version of the original logo.

Using #7 idea, I played a bit in inkscape and created this:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8tqy3dqdxsfbz9e/qgis.jpg

Since I'm not a designer, this us more a concept than a actual proposal.
Don't know if I can make it fancy.

I like the options that try to mix a compass with a Q.
It would be nice if it were something derived from de OSGeo logo.

The concept is in some of the logos, but they're still not quite there in terms of design:

I also agree that using the POI common symbol is not a good option.

Hi!

To be honest - I'd like to have a voting page somewhere ..
But it seems that you have to create an account on the logo page to start
voting ..
Probably someone finds another way to vote (or Nathan is taking our "vote"
into his ..)

Werner

I can set up some polls on the site once I have a general idea on which
icons people like.  The poll will let everyone vote with stars which logos
they like the best out of 8.  I will do this tomorrow once I have a general
idea from the form data.

If you don't want to use the form then this mailing list is also fine.  I
will take votes and feedback from both.


Regards,
Nathan

Victor,

Maybe I'm wrong but I think that Sextante does not work on qgis 1.8, right?
Note that, in such a case, feedback from users will be limited as most
users work with the stable release.
I have a 1.9 version on the little Mac and test from time to time.

I would add that this conversion of key tools from python to c++
should be a priority in qgis developement. Many
critical operations fail or never end in real life (size beyond limits of demo
datasets)  cases of study. Thus Vinayan work would be greatly welcomed by users.

hi!

If I remember correct Carson Farmer startet to bring the algorithms into a
cpp library (which would be a good and fast choice i think)
I'd welcome having fast and reliable algorithms in cpp .. So I agree with
Agustin - very welcome work..

Werner

Agustin

SEXTANTE now only works on 1.9 (to become 2.0 soon...), but all this
discussion is about tools in versions  >= 2.0. So those users that
work with the stable version will have SEXTANTE in their stable 2.0

I agree with the need of that c++ conversion. Once that is ready,
wrapping from SEXTANTE is trivial.

Cheers

Let me add that plain re-writing from Python to c++ may _not_ bring a
great speed improvement. Often it is more important to change the
algorithm - e.g. to use a spatial index where possible.

That was my thought...but for some reasons some operations are very
slow from the fTools code, even if they use indexing. I have a couple
of examples with points in polygon calculation, that take ages in
fTools (or the same SEXTANTE algorithm, which has the same code), and
they shouldn't. Maybe the Python call to create a spatial index is not
working properly and it actually does nothing... ????

I haven't spent too much time on this anyway, so it's true that
improving those algorithms might be possible and probably in some
cases not hard. I do not remember much about all ftools algorithms,
but for instance, those in the MMQGIS plugin were in many cases very
naive (and thus, unusable for large layers). I put them into SEXTANTE
as they were, but it's true that some extra work should be done on
that, at least with the most used algoirthms

Regards
Victor

Victor,
I know this is about >= 1.9, that's is the point:
I want to stress the contradiction about asking for feedback while
the tools cannot be tested on the stable version that most users use.
Qgis has an extraordinary feature:
users can test experimental tools developed as plugins while keeping the
stable core. If Sextante were working on the stable release, (either
by making sextante work
on 1.8, which is probably not possible, or by having released an
stable 1.9 ) you
would be having a lot more of feedback from users.

 Agus

Hi Agus,

You can get Sextante 1.0.8. It works well with QGIS 1.8. I've been using  
it for months now.
Only issue is that it has to be installed manually because Plugin  
Installer always fetches 1.0.9.

Anita

Could you show me how?

value = $area / "area"

causes

WHILE developing a Software Project (like QGIS) or a Database (like a GIS)
it is essential to build a conceptual model of the system. This should be
done both on static and functional basis.

My immediate concern at this time is the model of Geometric Networks. I want
to build some fleet tracking tools that use sequential GPS signals to
calculate vehicle passes through points, trajectories, routing etc. So, I
started modelling the QGIS library classes that I thought were relevant to
my subject. This is an ongoing work, and I have modelled a few classes,
their relationships, but also some use cases and functions. I am using UML
notation for this task. 

Note, that I am not using UML to automatically produce code. This is a
misconception, I think, of UML and its purpose in developing systems. I use
modeling purely for overview and documentation reasons, as I am not a
hard-core coder, but rather a GIS designer/engineer.

These being said, I think this modeling process can help with various issues
of QGIS development, including (but not limited to):

- Layers and sublayers programmatical handling

- Grouping and programmatical access of tools like SEXTANTE (and also other
plugins)

- API documentation (not the automatic one, but rather a manually updated
one, addressing all relevant issues to specific classes and methods).

- Connection between classes of different libraries (GDAL, QGIS, Qt etc.)

I hope that was a neat introduction to my thoughts about how GIS systems
should be documented! I also REALLY hope it gets some attention this time!

IF any of you think we can do some introductory work on QGIS documentation
(be it the actual API, GUI elements or any other part of the project) using
modern UML annotation and tools, please feel free to contact me with details
and ideas. I am willing to volunteer a few hours each week towards making
the QGIS project better, and documentation is the first step.

I am also open to conversations on this subject (a blog/forum would be
REALLY helpful there) and opinion sharing.

 

Hoping this message will strike some strings,

Petros,

Can you share some example diagrams you've made already and explain how 
they could integrate with the QGIS API and it's auto diagrams. I don't 
think anyone opposes your ideas but it's something you're going to have 
to get started and see if others want to help/continue the method.

Obviously we can host/incorporate such diagrams into the existing 
documentation.

Keep in mind there is a learning curve to UML and tools for UML, so 
simplification and recommendations are helpful there.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster saturation issue
Message-ID: <68E471AA-660C-47DF-A310-1B6213796C98@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I really appreciate the great new raster settings. These enhancements to QGIS are very nice.

On testing saturation today, I did notice a potential bug with that setting. For my test raster, I set the saturation to 1 and the difference between that setting and 0 was quite large. If I move to 2, 3, 4, and so on, the differences are very small and incremental. 

I'm wondering why the leap in saturation from 0 to 1? Is something incorrect in the algorithm calculating saturation? It seems as the values between 0 and 1 need to be handled to make the 0 to 1 change as incrementally small as the 1 to 2.

Regards,
John

Can you create a bug report about this and attach your raster to it
(if possible)? I'll take a look at this and see what's happening...

Thanks!

Actually - I can replicate it here. Don't worry about attaching a raster.

Personally I would automatically exclude anything that uses a compass
metaphor - it is so cliche and is used by so many different products
out there that it does not distinguish ours from the rest.

I think it would be helpful to require that each voter submits only
ONE preference - that way they have to put their head on the block and
commit to something and we can see the sum total of the very favourite
designs.

Hi

This is my favourite

http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/267

Though I would ask them to remove the word 'uantum' and write the word
GIS in the same size as the Q.

I think in general we should consider dropping the use of the Quantum
in the name and simply refer to our project as 'QGIS'.

Regards

Tim

Hi

267 is nice. You can replace ?uantum? with  ?server?, ?desktop? or ?webclient?.

I think in general we should consider dropping the use of the Quantum

I like the idea of Stephan: remove 'uantum, and leave it open or put 
'server', 'android', 'mobi', 'browser', 'desktop', 'plugins', 
'components', 'gadgets', 'rocks' or whatever there...

Or put this 'sub-project'-string over the full length and put GIS in 
same size.
Or just on same level as Q

Agreed very much!

And what does this designer think about using it as a desktop icon of 
different sub projects? Different colors for 'waves'? Or something else?

Richard

ps thanks to all for putting the effort in it! We are getting a very 
cool logo I think :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interaction between QGis and ArcGis
Message-ID: <1366366040046-5048256.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

If I want to open the same shapefile in both softwares at the same time, the
file is locked in ArcGis (even if the edition mode isn't used in QGis).
ArcGis is enable to recognize the feature's type (we can see a "?" instead
of polylign, polygon or point). 
This issue has been only noticed on Windows (and with ArcMap 9.2).

Someone has already seen this problem ? Is it due to QGis or Gdal ?

Thanks.

Julien

Hi, 
could you join a shape sample and specify gdal and qgis versions? 
I tested right now with a shp generated with QGIS, and add no problem
opening  / editing it with qgis master  nightly wiht gdal 1.9.2-2
r?gis

Dear Alex and list members,

Thanx for your reply and I am telling you that I am getting to prepare a
sample of my diagrams, along with an explanatory text. Do you think an open
Google Doc would be suitable? Other proposals, so that anyone can comment?
On your other comment, one of the purposes of UML, is to visually convey
information, even to those not able to comprehend it in the first place! So
it actually DOES simplify information! However, I do get the point of the
comment, and it was already in my plans to take it step-by-step.

Until later,

Petros,

Can you share some example diagrams you've made already and explain how they
could integrate with the QGIS API and it's auto diagrams. I don't think
anyone opposes your ideas but it's something you're going to have to get
started and see if others want to help/continue the method.

Obviously we can host/incorporate such diagrams into the existing
documentation.

Keep in mind there is a learning curve to UML and tools for UML, so
simplification and recommendations are helpful there.

Thanks,
Alex

Dear Petros,

I'd like to assure you first, that any work on improving the 
documentation is highly appreciated.
Please share your work in the best suitable manner for you but in a way 
others can at least access and maybe comment.
I've made good experiences with google docs, but I'm sure there are 
other good possibilities out there too.

I'm looking forward to seeing your ideas,
Matthias

Hi R?gis,

I tested it with Qgis master too?but with a shape not directly generated
with QGis. It may be the difference.
You can try on a other shape (BD Carthage for example). I?ll join a sample
on Monday if necessary.
I don?t remember you had ArcGis?

Julien

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Suppress emitting of signal: Bad practice?
Message-ID: <51714FAC.8070006@gmx.ch>

The QgsMapLayerRegistry::removeMapLayers allows to specify a parameter,
which will suppress emitting signals (altough it seems that this is not
even properly working [1]).

This parameter can lead to strange behavior, where some parts of the
software might not realize, that a layer has been removed and keep
references to no longer available objects.

The same fact applied to selected features in a vector layer. The
problem there was most probably, that only a method was available to
change the selection of a single feature and while iterating over
features, the signal was suppressed to not update the map canvas in
every iteration.

In my opinion, this is bad practice and we should remove these
parameters and add methods which allow batch jobs (removeMapLayers is
already in place) and then emit a single signal for a batch and call
this method wherever an iteration takes place.

So my questions are:
* Does somebody know why removeMapLayer(s) accepts this parameter?
* Do you see any negative effect of removing these or any upside in
keeping these?

API freeze is approaching fast and I think we should get rid of these
parameters now.

Any opinions on this?

I completely agree with you - it is a bad practice to pass a parameter
whether to emit signal or not - it is typically something that leads
to wrong design.

I remember we have added that to support georeferencer. The workflow
with layers in QGIS is currently:
1. create Qgs[Vector/Raster]Layer instance
2. add the layer to map registry
3. map registry emits signal, caught by legend widget
4. legend widget adds the layer to the list of layers and updates the
list of layers in canvas
Georeferencer comes with its own map canvas and its own set of layers.
When we add a layer that should be georeferenced, we do not want it to
appear also on main canvas - that's where the 'emit signal' parameter
comes handy. Setting it to false will avoid loading the layer in the
main window.

There are surely more ways how to fix the problem, but probably all of
them involve slight redesign of how the components are interconnected.
Maybe we do not need a map layer registry. Or maybe we could have
several map layer registries (instead of just having singleton), one
for each canvas in the application. Or maybe we need something more
general than just a list of layers: e.g. right now the ordering is
defined by legend widget... for a proper logic/gui separation we
should keep the layers + ordering + grouping in a data structure (and
only let legend widget serve as its view and controller).

I am not sure how feasible is to do something about it now, but in any
case I would warmly welcome another shift of API freeze, the amount of
things we need to fix in API is quite high (e.g. in my pipeline:
symbology-ng "V2" renaming, feature iterators + requests API fixes,
QgsVectorLayer API updates, QgsExpression API fixes, sip API 2 and
probably more).

Cheers

It was added to allow batch removal of layers. If you have a plugin
and you listen for layers removed and say 5 are removed at once and
you have some long running code that updates when the layer set is
changed, it is called 5 times. I think it is important to have a way
to remove layers in batch and let clients only receive a single event.

When I wrote that code I delegated the actual layer removal work to
the layer removal function. No problem from me if you update this but
I think the ability to remove multiple layers while triggering only a
single remove event should remain in place.

Yes agreed I will propose another shift to the end of April (feature
freeze remaining in effect).

Hi All

Given the number of API issues that still need to be resolved, I
propose we move the API freeze date to 1 May 2013.

Suggested updated timeline:

1 May 2013 - API, GUI Freeze
15 may String freeze - no changes to ui or strings except where
required for critical bug fixes. Call for translations.
1 June 2013 - Branch 2.0, code freeze (except for packaging related
changes), call for packaging
7 June 2013 - Public release of 2.0

I see the problem and a complete redesign of this API is (at least for 
me) at the moment out of scope.

There are two signals emitted for removal (the buggy implementation)
* layerWillBeRemoved (emitted properly, zero or one time)
* layersWillBeRemoved (emitted once or twice)

For addMapLayers (batch method) there are also two signals (properly 
emitted IMO)
* mapLayerAdded
* mapLayersAdded

The batch mode remove signal (layersWillBeRemoved) has already been 
emitted at least once since 1.8 (regardless of theEmitSignal parameter) 
and I don't think there have been any complaints, I'll remove the 
condition around that one.

My (quickfix) proposal would then be:
* Also emit mapLayersAdded (batch mode) unconditionally to allow proper 
tracking of layers to anybody.
* Rename the parameter from "theEmitSignal" to "addToLayerRegistry" and 
rename the signal according to that, so the use of this is 
straightforward communicated to the developer.

Does that sound good to you? A little effort for a cleaner API :-)

Sounds like a lot of work you want to get done. Will the deadline 
extension be enough for you?

Is the feature freeze still in effect?

I would like to finish stuff on the cpt-city color ramps, including adding
new ramps to the distribution, and add a configuration gui.

Hi Nyall,

I'm just getting back to this, so I don't know if a bug report is still required or if you worked on it already. I'm building trunk now and will followup with a bug report if the issue persists.

Hi!

I just subscribed to the Planet QGIS blog, which is great, and located here:
http://planet.qgis.org/planet/
http://planet.qgis.org/planet/feed/atom/

(also linked to at http://plugins.qgis.org/planet/, from
http://www.qgis.org/en/community.html and http://www.qgis.org/).

However, before I found that I got stuck looking at this:
http://qgis.org/planet/
Which aggregates fewer blogs, has no RSS/atom feed and has broken links (
http://blog.qgis.org/). Perhaps it should be taken down or redirect to the
fully functional URL?

I wasn't sure where to report this. Hope it's okay on this list.

Cheers,
Chris

Hey all,

I'm going to go over what people have voted for so far and put them in a
poll for people to vote on.  The top designs out of that will go though to
the final round where we can have more iterations of the picked designs.

I like #50 but with slight modification, a globe inside the Q would be
good. The globe designed from #315 is nice to be put inside the Q in
#50.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all.
Yesterday I have shown Sextante in an advanced course. Here my conclusions:

* in Sextante options, General entry should always be the first, Modeler second, and
Script third
* the name of the settings is an editable field, which seems inappropriate
* the Settings column should be wider, at the expense of the Value column;

standalone packages (win, osx); any blockers for this?

Overall, there is great excitation, and users are looking forward for 2.0, with
Sextante in bright light!

All the best, and thanks.

QGIS opens layers (files) in update mode ("r+") if possible (file
permission + OGR driver support). It may (but also may not) be a
problem also for #6448 (slow shp over network) I am currently
struggling with. In general, I think that it is bad to open files
always in update mode even if in most cases they are not going to be
edited.

Currently there are no QgsVectorDataProvider::startEditing() and
commitChanges() which may also be a problem for database providers
because QgsVectorLayerEditBuffer::commitChanges() calls more provider
methods changing
data (deleteAttributes, addAttributes, deleteFeatures,
addFeatures...).  The commitChanges() should do everything in one
transaction IMO.

My proposal is to:
1) Add QgsVectorDataProvider::startEditing() and
QgsVectorDataProvider::commitChanges()
2) In OGR provider try to open layer in update mode only to get
capabilities (get info if it can be modified when the provider is
constructed) but then to reopen in read only mode.
3) Call QgsVectorDataProvider::startEditing() from
QgsVectorLayer::startEditing() to be sure that the layer is still
editable (permissions could change or it was opened by another
application for editing since the layer was opened) and to reopen
files in update mode (files based) or to start transaction (DB based).
4) Call QgsVectorDataProvider::commitChanges() from
QgsVectorLayer::commitChanges()
4) In QgsOgrProvider::startEditing() reopen the layer in update mode
5) In QgsOgrProvider::commitChanges() reopen the layer in read only mode

I am not sure if reopening of layers in OGR provider may be a
performance problem, but I hope that it should not be.

We don't really have to implement startEditing() and commitChanges()
in all providers for 2.0, but it should be in the vector API.

solution for #6448.

I would like to be sure about the right header files order we prefer.
Developer manual [1] example is using:

* qt headers
* qgis headers

do you agree with that order (least specific -> most specific) extend
for system etc (each section sorted lexically):

* system headers
* standard libraries headers
* qt headers
* other 3rd party libraries headers
* qgis headers

or do most people prefer reverted order (most specific -> least specific):

* qgis headers
* other 3rd party libraries headers
* qt headers
* standard libraries headers
* system headers

The pros for each one may be found in many threads on web.

grass vectors are broken and are causing qgis to crash when removing

I have been thinking about changing all the options dialog. Doesn't

It's limited now for two reasons:
   1) The classification of algorithms is done manually...and it is
boooooring to do :-) SAGA and QGIS ones are already done, but I have
to do the GRASS ones. However I am not sure about including GRASS, it
is more complex to use. You can use a SAGA algorithm without knowing
what SAGA is, but to use a GRASS one, you need to understand some
GRASS ideas, so it is an advanced process, and the simplified
algorithm classification shouldn't assume that. You can always change
to the advanced view to use GRASS (now you can change directly from
the toolbox, no need to go to the config dialog)
   2) I would like to have in that list, only those algorithms that
need no extra configuration, to make that the default and have it
working out-of the box. That's why R and OTB, for instance, are not in
there.

good idea. If OTB goes into osgeo4w, I could add the OTB algorithms to
the simplified list of algorithms

I still have to send Jurgen the SAGA package as we discussed it in the
Hackfest. We can put both SAGA and OTB, and taht would really give a
lot of power to SEXTANTE

Thanks for your ideas!

great, thanks. ready to help if necessary. I still think the appearance of sextante
dialogs do not seem too much in line with QGIS look, so maybe you can ask someone to
help with the GUI.

Sorry I do not agree with you:
* most GRASS commands, as they are incorporated into sextante (or in the GRASS
plugin, by that way) are really straightforward to use; in courses people often do
not notice the difference
* more importantly: GRASS is included in most if not all QGIS installation, so you
can rely on it; this is not the same for SAGA
* GRASS modules have a proper manpage, while SAGA is sometimes very hard to understand
* GRASS has a long history and a wide community, so you can trust more on it on the
longer term.
So in short I would not put GRASS as a second class citizen in Sextante ;)

Again, do not agree: some OTB commands are very straightforward, and solve problem
people have struggled on for years. The usual effect of showing it is jaw-dropping.
Removing stuff from first sight may have deeper consequences than a clever developer
can foresee, sometimes :)

OTB *is* already on osgeo4w - my suggestion (a strong one BTW) is to include it in
the standalone installer for QGIS 2.0

I very like as this contest is going, #50,  #267 and #268 are very nice but
I also think they don't look fine as desktop icon, IMO inside  the "Q"
there is too much white.

Regards,

-SL
I like #50 but with slight modification, a globe inside the Q would be
good. The globe designed from #315 is nice to be put inside the Q in
#50.

Dear Sirs,
I tried the Qgis development version (1.9 alpha).  I am interested in
connecting to Oracle Db 11.
Currently known considerable slowness in accessing Oracle tables.

several times asked the SRID for no reason.

By improving definitely have access times that are excessive. If you are
interested in as soon as changes can I re run the test.
The 300 dpi printing for now does not work and crash the Pdf generation

Salve.
Grazie per la segnalazione. A quel che so questo dipende da come sono
strutturate le
tabelle nel tuo DB. Dato che sei in una posizione ottimale per farlo,
avendo pieno
accesso ad un'istanza reale di Oracle, potresti inoltrare le tue
considerazioni in ML
qgis-dev? Sarebbe di grande aiuto per migliorare la situazione.
Grazie mille.

Ola.
Che sta succedendo? Qualcuno ha intenzione di muoversi? Mi pare sia stata
esplicitata una lista minima di chi e' interessato a far ripartire
l'associazione.
Possiamo iniziare a lavorare in questo senso? Mi pare che la prima cosa da
fare sia
la convocazione dell'assemblea, e le opzioni siano:
* attendere il GFOSS Day
* convocarla prima.
Voto per la seconda opzione, per non perdere ulteriori occasioni
importanti; penso
si possa trovare una data fra maggio e giugno, in un luogo raggiungibile
dalla
maggioranza degli interessati (immagino la scelta sia fra Bologna, Firenze
e Roma,
ma qualunque alternativa per me va bene).
Saluti.

PS:
Tim, there have been some comments (probably written by you) to 
deprecate / replace the non-batch signals and methods.
I've left them there (and removed the deprecation comments) as 
convenience methods and signals (and to not break the API).
As long as you don't have long-running jobs such as repainting the 
canvas it won't hurt to use the non-batch signals and for any other 
purpose, the batch API is in place and mentioned in the API doc. 
Therefore, in my opinion, these should be left there.

If you still see a benefit in removing these, you could do so now.

Hi,

    I am an italian archaeologist and an enthusiastic QGIS user. I do
what I can to spread the knowledge about QGIS and other open source
softwares to my university students (I am a contract professor at the
Basilicata University and some days ago I've become contract professor
at the Specialization School of Archeology of Udin, Venice and
Trieste).
The main difficulty I have with open source GIS is the advanced
editing of vector layers. QGIS doesn't offer too much support to
digitizing, the CAD Tools plugin has some useful functions but is far
from being complete and the kind of interaction that it proposes is
not very productive and time-saving (it's not a critic: CAD Tools
saved my life a lot of time, and I want to thank the developers and
maintainers). Many times, I had to convert my vector layers to dxf and
back in order to perform some complex tasks (with all kind of
conversion problems, like the preservation of the attributes values,
etc.).
I have some experience in programming (about ten years of
developement, mainly in C# with the .NET Framework, before I switched
to Linux), and I would like to try (only try, without promising
anything!!) to implement complete CAD tools and functions (I there
isn't and analogous project already active; in that case, nevermind!).

I think that developing a CAD plugin from scratch is very hard to me
and maybe not the better way to get good results, so I'm oriented to
try to augment the interaction between QGIS and an existing CAD
software (I'm thinking to LibreCAD). I thought to two possible
strategies:

1. Use the LibreCAD library and source code to develop a C++ QGIS plugin;
2. Create a shapefile/spatialite/postgis driver for LibreCAD in order
to edit those formats inside LibreCAD.
3. Convert some layers of the QGIS project in a dxf file and back
(each QGIS layer in a different layer of the final dxf file).

I'm asking your opinion about which of those ways could be the faster
or the better to implement, or which one is impossible to undertake
according to your knowledge of the QGIS API.

My doubts are:

Strategy #1: Probably the ideal one, but does the implementation of
complex snaps or constraints against the features of other layers
(i.e. midpoint, parallels, etc.) require changes to the QGIS API, or
all these operations can be contained on a plugin? Is it better to
work directly on QGIS vector layers or to create a plugin layer, edit
it and then commit the changes to the vector layer? The conversion
could help me to manage geometries in the way LibreCAD wants. Is it
possible in your opinion to have an interactive shell (i.e. draw the
first point, and then inserting the coordinates of the second point)?
Strategy #2: Probably the easier, but I should find a way to disable
some LibreCAD functions (i.e. the drawing of splines, or the drawing
of points on a line layer) without disseminating my changes all over
LibreCAD's source files. For this kind of solution I'll ask to the
developers of LibreCAD.
Strategy #3: The problem is on committing the changes of the dxf file
to the original layer: how to specify that a line in the dxf file must
replace the geometry of and existing record of the original spatialite
layer? Maybe it's impossible, it doesn't seem to me that I can put on
a dxf file the necessary metadata to preserve a link to the original
features.

What do you think? And what do you actually do when you have to draw
complex shapes on shapefiles or other vector layers?

Just a note: I'll be bundling OTB and SAGA in the OS X package.  I already have code in sextante to automatically find the bundled copies.

Maybe I'll look again at Taudem.  I think when I looked at it a year ago I was put off by Windows/Arc-centric nature of it.  ... ugh, just a quick browse of the source doesn't look good - mix of windows and unix line endings in some files needs to be fixed (maybe the compiler doesn't care, but it's hard to read), and assumption of available headers/libraries, like MPI.  This may not be an option for OS X, at least in the near future.  It's also disappointing that the author didn't use libtiff, so that taudem could support lzw compression and bigtiff.

I'd say #307, #334 and #337 should be retained for second round...

Thank you so much for this. So, Victor, paths could be set up as defaults in all
major platforms then, right?

Bad stuff, agreed. However, taudem has been properly packaged in Debian main, so I
suppose it can be brought to a reasonable state.
BTW, is it supported by an active community? Has anyone tried to contact the authors
suggestiong at least some basic fix?

Thanks again.
All the best.

Paolo

You have convinced me: OTB and GRASS should be on the simplified list :-)

Now comes the hard part...classifying their algorithms...

I have already done it for OTB, since the names and groups are usable.
GRASS ones are clearly not...which means that we need not only to set
a group, but an alternative name for each GRASS module...

If anyone feels like helping, here is the link to a google spreadsheet
where the classification can be edited

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Arf7VNv0yae5dGR4UjFMekxNVmg1blBUdWMweHJRYVE&usp=sharing

Thanks in advance for your help!

From what I could figure out, there is no need for a default for Linux since it inherits a shell environment and can execute commands without explicit paths (the $PATH is the default).

I don't know the details of the Windows environment, but there is a default path for GRASS, but none for SAGA, OTB or TauDEM.  Though I don't understand the python searching logic for the GRASS default.

This is whet I thought, but from a first trial Sextante does not seem to work without.

I'll investigate, thanks.

It wasn't too hard to fix the Windows junk.  Key points:

- I fixed the mixed line endings, but I don't know if the compiler cares

- a few headers have hardwired a local "stdint.h" meant for windows.  change to <stdint.h> for *nix/OS X

- the clean target is a dep in all, it freaked me out when the *.o disappeared after the build

- CC is hardwired to mpic++, easy to override without editing the makefiles

- need to pass in LDFLAGS so it links libmpi and libmpi_cxx

Hi Diego

Can I suggest to put your post in a new thread instead of
incorportating it into an existing (and unrelated to your post)
thread? I suspect many people who may have given you feedback will

Yes, there is no need for it. That's why in Linux SEXTANTE assumes
SAGA is on the PATH and doesn't let you the folder yourself manually.

There is a default for GRASS because SAGA is bundled with QGIS. For
the other ones, they could be anywhere in the system. Now that they
are going to be installed along with QGIS by the OSGeo4W installer, I
will add default paths for them as well.

When would be startEditing() called - when user starts editing in GUI
or when user is going to commit the changes, just before issuing
provider editing functions?
Maybe beginTransaction() and endTransaction() or commitTransaction()
would be better names? It would be practical to have also another
method to detect whether the provider is in editing mode.

What about legacy code that directly makes changes to
QgsVectorDataProvider? Will it need to wrap the editing functions with
these two additional calls? It would be good if that would not be
necessary and the provider would start and stop the transaction
automatically if not in editing mode.

Regarding 2) is it necessary to open layer in update mode in order to
get editing capabilities?

Agreed.

Personally I do not care so much about the order of the sections. I
would say we should just:
1. #include the corresponding header file first (e.g. for abc.cpp the
first include should be #include "abc.h") to ensure that the header
file does not have some hidden include dependencies
2. keep each section sorted

Anyway the least specific -> most specific order makes more sense than
the opposite order.

When user starts editing (Toggle Editing), that should ensure
possibility of later commit (provider will keep files in update mode
after startEditing()). startEditing() may also fail (if permissions
changed), it would be bad to let user do editing which could not be
commited. Opening a transaction in DB should ensure that commit will
be done on the same data which were edited.

Maybe better, but we are already using startEditing() and
commitChanges() in vector layer so I would prefer to use the same.

endTransaction() for rollback?

> It would be practical to have also another

Yes and startEditing() should return false it a transaction is already opened.

It can probably start automatically but when it should commit? It
should not commit changes automatically in destructor, not commited
changes should be lost if supported by provider (DB providers) . File
based providers will do changes immediately, no rollback on provider
level,  but still there will be rollback on layer level.

> get editing capabilities?

I think so, OGR_L_TestCapability works with opened layer and
OGR_DS_TestCapability can only test ODsCCreateLayer and
ODsCDeleteLayer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Make QGIS interact with LibreCAD.
Message-ID: <CAML4Tuk_oqhE_RZ90F=cmyYPiTavOOSRCJdbA+bS6ffGMJF-yA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Yesterday I posted in a wrong thread, so I'm opening a new one. I'll
copy and paste the previous message and add some notes. Sorry for the
mess!

Original post:

I am an Italian archaeologist and an enthusiastic QGIS user. I do what
I can to spread the knowledge about QGIS and other open source
softwares to my university students (I am a contract professor at the
Basilicata University and some days ago I've become contract professor
at the Specialization School of Archeology of Udin, Venice and
Trieste). The main difficulty I have with open source GIS is the
advanced editing of vector layers. QGIS doesn't offer too much support
for digitizing, the CAD Tools plugin has some useful functions but is
far from being complete and the kind of interaction that it proposes
is not very productive and time-saving (it's not a critic: CAD Tools
saved my life a lot of time, and I want to thank the developers and
maintainers). Many times, I had to convert my vector layers to dxf and
back in order to perform some complex tasks (with all kind of
conversion problems, like the preservation of the attributes values,
etc.).
I have some experience in programming (about ten years of
developement, mainly in C# with the .NET Framework, before I switched
to Linux), and I would like to try (only try, without promising
anything!!) to implement complete CAD tools and functions (If there
isn't and analogous project already active; in that case, nevermind!).

I think that developing a CAD plugin from scratch is very hard to me
and maybe not the better way to get good results, so I'm oriented to
try to augment the interaction between QGIS and an existing CAD
software (I'm thinking to LibreCAD). I thought to two possible
strategies:

1. Use the LibreCAD library and source code to develop a C++ QGIS plugin;
2. Create a shapefile/spatialite/postgis driver for LibreCAD in order
to edit those formats inside LibreCAD.
3. Convert some layers of the QGIS project in a dxf file and back
(each QGIS layer in a different layer of the final dxf file).

I'm asking your opinion about which of those ways could be the faster
or the better to implement, or which one is impossible to undertake
according to your knowledge of the QGIS API.

My doubts are:

Strategy #1: Probably the ideal one, but does the implementation of
complex snaps or constraints against the features of other layers
(i.e. midpoint, parallels, etc.) require changes to the QGIS API, or
all these operations can be contained on a plugin? Is it better to
work directly on QGIS vector layers or to create a plugin layer, edit
it and then commit the changes to the vector layer? The conversion
could help me to manage geometries in the way LibreCAD wants. Is it
possible in your opinion to have an interactive shell (i.e. draw the
first point, and then inserting the coordinates of the second point)?

Strategy #2: Probably the easier, but I should find a way to disable
some LibreCAD functions (i.e. the drawing of splines, or the drawing
of points on a line layer) without disseminating my changes all over
LibreCAD's source files. For this kind of solution I'll ask to the
developers of LibreCAD.

Strategy #3: The problem is on committing the changes of the dxf file
to the original layer: how to specify that a line in the dxf file must
replace the geometry of and existing record of the original spatialite
layer? Maybe it's impossible, it doesn't seem to me that I can put on
a dxf file the necessary metadata to preserve a link to the original
features.

What do you think? And what do you actually do when you have to draw
complex shapes on shapefiles or other vector layers?

NEW COMMENTS:

- Antonio Locandro is compiling a list of required CAD features. It
would be very useful, so please Antonio, get me a link to this list
when it's finished.
- The more I explore QGIS and LibreCAD source codes, the more I'm
convincing that integrating LibreCAD's tools on QGIS is very
difficult, and it would be easier to develop those tools from scratch.
To get the best results in a short amount of time, I think that I
could work to make shapefiles and other vector layers editable in
LibreCAD (using GDAL). This solution has the issue that it doesn't
allow to snap to other QGIS layers, nevertheless it could be of great
help and available in a reasonable amount of time. Then, when I have
more practice with QGIS and LibreCAD APIs, I'll try to do something
better (i.e. develop a "QGIS driver" for LibreCAD in order to open the
whole QGIS project in LibreCAD, organized by layers).
I'm waiting for the answers to an analogous thread in LibreCAD's mailing list:

http://forum.librecad.org/Using-LibreCAD-s-tools-on-GIS-vector-layers-td5707930.html

I think that I'm going to work on this project in a few weeks.

Let me know what do you think and if you have suggestions.

FWIW, I think that #336 is really good, but it was probably added to late to be really noticed.

A couple of people said they like the other variations of it, by I think the one which has the triangle on the Q in a different colour is no good because it isn't clear enough that it is a Q.  Even in #336 I guess it might not be clear enough, but the triangle does seem cool compared to a regular stroke on the Q...

Of course, I'm still not convinced it is better than the proposal here:

Paolo, I have changed the configuration dialog with your suggestions
(thanks!). Everything you suggested is there, except making the param
name not editable, which seems a bit harder to get...

Also, now there are autoconfig paths for SAGA, GRASS and OTB in
Windows, so if a user installs QGIS with the OSGeo4W installer, there
should nbe no need for extra configuration, and  he could start using
all algorithms directly in an out-of-the-box QGIS install.

thanks!
Victor

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Context help styling
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E0FB26C802E@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm wanting to tidy up some context help, and can't quite figure out where some of the styling is coming from, and where would be a good place to put styling information if I wanted to.  It looks like it comes from the code

    QString myStyle = QgsApplication::reportStyleSheet();
    helpContents = "<head><style>" + myStyle + "</style></head><body>" + helpContents + "</body>";
    webView->setHtml( helpContents );

The reportStyleSheet() function returns CSS styling for h1 to h5 header levels, but not much else.  I replicated this into an external CSS file, and wrote a little python script to display the help text in a QWebView.

But it doesn't come out quite the same.  For example the spacing in a <pre> </pre> block is different.

So I'm wondering if there is some more styling coming from somewhere I've missed, and that I could maybe use?  And if I did want to have some styles for spans or paragraphs (eg for code), where should I put them

Thanks
Chris

eg
Python script

#!/usr/bin/python
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtWebKit import *

with open('context.css') as fcss:
    css=fcss.read()
with open('QgsDelimitedTextSourceSelect-en_US') as fhtml:
    content=fhtml.read()

html = '<head><style type="text/css">'+css+'</style></head><body>'+content
+'</body>'

app=QApplication([])
main = QWebView()
main.pageAction(QWebPage.Reload).triggered.connect(reload)
main.setHtml(html)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating core plugins
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xzGpLsLXjrT4cBC9qHcqc8eU0yc+JOGr++RMGeNhzTsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Having SEXTANTE as a core plugin in QGIS is really great, but I am
worried about how that will affect users when 2.0 is released. My two
main concerns are:

- People currently using SEXTANTE as a non-core plugin will have 2
versions of SEXTANTE installed when they install 2.0. This is likely
to cause strange behaviour, and, as some users have reported on the
mailing list, it seems that the non-core plugin (in this case, the
older version), will override the other one. Not a nice thing... The
solution is to manually uninstall it, but that is going to cause a lot
of confusion...

- I have a few features that will not be ready for 2.0, but I would
like to release them later, just releasing a new versino of SEXTATE
independently. However, I think that core plugins cannot be updated.
Installing the new one separately will cause two version to be
installed...

Any ideas on that? I see that the easiest solution would be to have
something in the plugin manager that, in case of having two versions
of a plugin, would use just the most recent one.

Thanks in advance!
Victor

Yes, non-core plugin overrides the core one (just because of the Python path 
order), so the only thing you can do is to make the core SEXTANTE version 
higher - at least QGIS will warn about the override and suggest manual 
uninstall.

But we use the new .qgis2 directory, so I guess we just should tell users to 
not copy the .qgis to .qgis2 thoughtlessly...

In addition, we could prevent QGIS 2.0 from loading uncompatible plugins. The 
repository and the installer assume, that plugins with qgisMinimumVersion==1.x 
are only compatible with 1.x unless it's strictly set by an optional tag 
qgisMaximumVersion (>= 2.0). The same behaviour could be implemented for 
loading plugins.

Exactly, the base version in core and updates in user directory. The problem 
will be when you release a new version with QGIS 2.1, the updates for 2.0 will 
override the new version. But we can improve the override detection procedure 
for 2.1 (for example, the installer could uninstall the overriding version 
instead of only warning)

Or uninstall the overriding plugin, if older. It would be probably more 
elegant solution...

Victor,

Would it be possible for you to add GRASS' pan sharpening function
(i.fusion.brovey) to sextante? I'm sure that'll make more than one guy
happy :)

Keep up the good work, lots of very nice tweaks to sextante lately.

Hi Mathieu,
please have a look to:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/python/plugins/sextante/grass/grass.txt
It is reasonably easy to add command yourself. If successful, you can send the file
to Victor, or better issue a pull request for it.
Thanks!

Or notify the user, and asking "Do you want to remove the older version you installed
previously?".

Thank you.
It would be nice if you could announce it to the users ML, so we could make it sure
this work in all local settings.

Strictly speaking we are still in feature freeze, but if your work
will add polish and usability to 2.0 I think its fine to add an an
exception to accommodate this.

Hi Anita

and sorry for late response. Advanced calculator used a bit different syntax ? field names should be included in "<>", so
your formula will look like

value = $geom.area() / <area>

You can find documentation here (nfortunately only in Russian)

Paolo, nice, didn't know it was that easy to add new functions.

I gave it a go, but something's wrong as the output raster isn't
created. It might have to do with the fact that i.fusion.brovey
doesn't seem to have a raster's output parameter. Instead, and
somewhat unique to this i. function, it has an outputprefix parameter
(see http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/i.fusion.brovey.html).
I've tried to simply use that parameter as a placeholder for
sextante's OutputRaster syntax, but it doesn't seem to work.

Victor, do you know what's happening here? Here's the
i.fusion.brovey.txt syntax being used (and failing ATM):

i.fusion.brovey
i.fusion.brovey - Brovey transform to merge multispectral and high-res
panchromatic channels.
Imagery (i.*)
ParameterRaster|ms1|Name of input raster map (green: tm2 / qbird_green
/ spot1)|False
ParameterRaster|ms2|Name of input raster map (NIR: tm4 / qbird_nir /
spot2)|False
ParameterRaster|ms3|Name of input raster map (MIR; tm5 / qbird_red /
spot3)|False
ParameterRaster|pan|Name of input raster map (etmpan / qbird_pan /
spotpan)|False
ParameterBoolean|-l|LANDSAT sensor|False
ParameterBoolean|-q|QuickBird sensor|False

AFAIK, there is no active developer community around TauDEM (maybe
because of very specific area), it developed by single author and
mainly oriented on Windows and ArcGIS.

I talked with David (TauDEM developer and author) several times when
worked on TauDEM provider for SEXTANTE. He has some plans about
putting TauDEM sources at GitHub or Bitbucket. This allows other
developers contribute to project and maybe increase community. But
seems he didn't have much time for this.

I can ask him again and maybe help him with initial import. Also I send him two patches for building TauDEM under *NIX.

I think decoupling the release of a new Sextante version from the release
of a new QGIS release is very important. QGIS Master always has bugs that
preclude the users from correctly testing Sextante.

When Sextante was first released as a plugin, all users had to do was to
checkout the svn repository to get the latest code. It was during this
period that there was the highest number of people testing Sextante. Now,
there are only a few.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible memory leak in rendering code
Message-ID: <20130422125029.4e703d4fe04d7e324bf7575f@gmail.com>

Hi all,

working on QTiles plugin we found one odd issue ? when number of
canvas redraws is relatively big (around 200 000 - 300 000) QGIS
crashed with segmentation fault. Seems there is a memory leak
somewhere.

I'll try to debug this more, but as I'm  not very familiar with rendering code any help and suggestions are welcome. Small test
plugin to replicate this issue attached. Also it is possible to use
QTiles plugin for this: just set extent and zoom levels so number of
tiles is greater that 200 000 and start process. QGIS will crash
at 60-70%.

Hi Alex,

I found in the past particularly two things making the rendering more 
stable:
* Disable Render Cache
* Enable Backbuffer (only availale in X11/Linux)

Can you check if one of these two changes in the options fix this issue?
(Restart after changing)

Matthias

I didn't know about that qgis2 folder, but sounds like a good thing,
and will solve the main problem that I was worried about.

Once 2.0 is out, I can release new versions of SEXTANTE, and also
release them when a new QGIS version is released, so people using a
non-core version (a version that is not the one that comes with QGIS)
can also update.

It seems that you have been thinking about this already, so I guess
that it will not be hard to keep a separate release schedule in case
there are new features in SEXTANTE that would be good to publish
without waiting for a new QGIS release.

Great work Borys! Seems that the early morning trips while at the
Hackfest really worked out ;-)

Hi Diego,

some of my users with more complex editing tasks (and familiar with CAD 
software) are complaining about not having similar possibilities in QGIS 
and I admit that our CAD has much more to offer in that respect 
(snapping, construction), so thanks for the move.
IMHO the best would be to have CAD-like functions in QGIS (strategy #1) 
because
1) many people missing these functions already might use some CAD or 
another to get their work done and are exchanging data between the two 
systems (with all problems), so strategy #2 would simply exchange their 
CAD software (if they are willing to change)
2) and more important: many things that work in CAD do not work in GIS 
and vice versa, e.g. CAD: line color, hatching, dimensioning...., GIS: 
attributes. Splines could be resolved into polylines, resembling the 
original spline, though. In short words: CAD is about drawing, GIS is 
about data modelling. So if you have the functions in QGIS you can more 
easily prevent users from doing silly things.

Hi Matthias,

thanks for hints. Just tested with disabled Renderer Cache and again
get crash. Here is last console messages:

Hi Bernhard,

I'll take your opinion into account. I'm still in a preliminary phase
and I'm still deciding. I verified that adding shapefile support to
LibreCAD is relatively simple, due to the good architecture of
LibreCAD's IO and geometry classes. Now I'll test how hard is adding
advanced cad tools to QGIS and how much time it can require to me.
Then I'll compare all the pros and cons of the two solutions and I'll
start to work. I need to finish the work before september, when I'll
have to use it in my job).
I'm not an expert of the QGIS API, and I need to study the source code
and the documentation in order to know precisely how can I interact
with QGIS while drawing:

- changing the snapping behavior and override the default one when required;
- having context menus with CTRL + right click (like on AutoCAD);
- drawing temporary entities (i.e. to trace extension lines);
- forcing the pointer to move along specific directions inside the map canvas;
- fast accessing to vertices, lines and angles of the existing shapes,
also for polygons.

I also need to understand if I can do all these things from a plugin
or do I need to make changes to the QGIS source code (I'll try to
avoid this).
I'll update this threads with all my progresses in the next days.

Diego

By the way, it would be a good thing to remove render caching
completely before 2.0. In any case it will need to be reworked when
moving to multi-threaded rendering... it has only a limited
functionality of storing previously rendered map in each layer and
reusing it in case the extent has not changed. Unfortunately the
rendered image is stored directly within QgsMapLayer class - in order
to work properly, the cache should be kept internally within each
QgsMapRenderer instance.

I totally agree with Bernhard. Extending his CAD tools is the best solution.

Hi 

I actually wanted to dig into C++ and rewrite the CadTools for QGIS 2.x and also change the UI handling a bit.

Not sure how fast I will progress though.

Hi Diego,

based on a discussion [1] on this list a couple of months ago I started 
coding some of the missing tools as my time allows. This is going to be 
a Python plugin made from scratch.
What I do have right now is:
1) Dissolve multi geometries (code from Alexandre Neto's plugin)
2) Split feature with feature of another layer
3) Cut out feature with polygon of another layer

I can share what I have on github. Maybe you want to have a look or join in.

What would be the tools you have in mind (I do not know LibreCAD)?

Bernhard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Make QGIS interact with LibreCAD.
Message-ID: <SNT401-EAS4417A928039F90A6769340A5CB0@phx.gbl>

I would say add CAD tools within QGIS,?

1. Extend?
2. Trim
3. Snapping environment
4. digitise using either icons or commands on a console
5. Intersection, etc.

CAD tools are faster for digitising and more precise, having that possibility from within QGIS would make it so much better, I find digitising in QGIS very limited so for me right now its not to a point I can recommend it since in my industry we do a lot of complex shapes and edits.

based on a discussion [1] on this list a couple of months ago I started 
coding some of the missing tools as my time allows. This is going to be 
a Python plugin made from scratch.
What I do have right now is:
1) Dissolve multi geometries (code from Alexandre Neto's plugin)
2) Split feature with feature of another layer
3) Cut out feature with polygon of another layer

I can share what I have on github. Maybe you want to have a look or join in.

What would be the tools you have in mind (I do not know LibreCAD)?

I would like to see some changes in the snapping interface. If you got some 30+ layers it is really difficult to find a specific layer. A layer tree for snapping just like for the legend would be great. And add the tree as tab like the browser.

I say it could work if you had an interface where you can set which layers you want to intersect but interactively select snapping within a console. I remember when I used AUTOCAD the thing that I really liked about it is thata. I can draw pretty fast and accurate using only commands but had the icons if I wantedb. Snapping is one of the best I used, you can interactively set the snapping while digitising like snap to end, snap to midpoint, snap to edge, etc. Like Diego said before I will start a shared google document where I will add digitising cases I use/need, once its up you are free to add your particular cases also. The idea is to see if all of this cases can be done using QGIS (core+extensions) at some point in the future I would say the necessary plugins needed to perform this edits would need to be merged into one single plugin. So having a tool with all CAD functions would be great.

I would like to see some changes in the snapping interface.
If you got some 30+ layers it is really difficult to find a specific layer.
A layer tree for snapping just like for the legend would be great. And add the tree as tab like the browser.

Betreff: Re: [Qgis-developer] Make QGIS interact with LibreCAD.


 

I would say add CAD tools within QGIS, 


 


1. Extend 


2. Trim


3. Snapping environment


4. digitise using either icons or commands on a console


5. Intersection, etc.


 


CAD tools are faster for digitising and more precise, having that possibility from within QGIS would make it so much better, I find digitising in QGIS very limited so for me right now its not to a point I can recommend it since in my industry
 we do a lot of complex shapes and edits.

Hi Diego,



based on a discussion [1] on this list a couple of months ago I started 

coding some of the missing tools as my time allows. This is going to be 

a Python plugin made from scratch.

What I do have right now is:

1) Dissolve multi geometries (code from Alexandre Neto's plugin)

2) Split feature with feature of another layer

3) Cut out feature with polygon of another layer



I can share what I have on github. Maybe you want to have a look or join in.



What would be the tools you have in mind (I do not know LibreCAD)?

I'd also suggest to include numerical entry (length, angle, X/Y
coordinates).

Please have a look at
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/improvedpolygoncapturing/ (it does not work
well in 2.0 yet).
With advanced snapping environment (include angles, midpoints,
intersections...), I'd say it's the CAD feature I miss the most in QGis.

Stefan and Bernahard, I don't want to create redundancy on the plugin
repository: if you're working on similar projects, maybe I can try to
help you instead of starting a brand new work.
Stefan and Antonio, by now i'm not focusing on specific tools (i.e.
extension vs. draw perpendicular), but I'm studying to find a sort of
design pattern that could allow faster drawing in respect to the
actual CAD Tools plugin. As Antonio said, it would be niche to have
something like the system provided by AutoCAD: while drawing, CTRL +
left btn to activate a specific constraint (i.e. perpendicular,
midpoint, etc.), then leave the mouse on a geometry for some seconds
to activate the constraint in respect to that entity, then move the
mouse and draw (or something similar and less like AutoCAD, to avoid
copyright problems). And of course, command line options.
If this plugin (?) is possible and can be designed with a sufficient
level of abstraction, it shall be easy to add new tools to it (i.e.
extension, tangent to a circle, etc. maybe reusing part of the code of
LibreCAD or of another open source CAD software).
By now, I need to create an experimental project on my pc before
saying what is possible to do in QGIS and what I'm able or not to do.

I'd also suggest to include numerical entry (length, angle, X/Y coordinates).
Please have a look at http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/improvedpolygoncapturing/ (it does not work well in 2.0 yet).

With advanced snapping environment (include angles, midpoints, intersections...), I'd say it's the CAD feature I miss the most in QGis.




2013/4/22 Ziegler Stefan <Stefan.Ziegler at bd.so.ch>










I would like to see some changes in the snapping interface.
If you got some 30+ layers it is really difficult to find a specific layer.
A layer tree for snapping just like for the legend would be great. And add the tree as tab like the browser.

I would say add CAD tools within QGIS, 


 


1. Extend 


2. Trim


3. Snapping environment


4. digitise using either icons or commands on a console


5. Intersection, etc.


 


CAD tools are faster for digitising and more precise, having that possibility from within QGIS would make it so much better, I find digitising in QGIS very limited so for me right now its not to a point I can recommend it since in my industry
 we do a lot of complex shapes and edits.

What I do have right now is:

1) Dissolve multi geometries (code from Alexandre Neto's plugin)

2) Split feature with feature of another layer

3) Cut out feature with polygon of another layer



I can share what I have on github. Maybe you want to have a look or join in.



What would be the tools you have in mind (I do not know LibreCAD)?

Sorry, probably not.

The problem could be that not edited layer keeps something in memory
(shx - shapes index) and that is not updated (reloaded) when shx file
is updated by second (edited) layer. But that should not result in
crash.

Simple adding of startEditing/commitChanges to provider cannot solve
that. We need to update (reload) all layers using the same data source
(files) after commitChanges. In fact, some formats must not be read
while edited, so startEditing should disable all layers using the same
file. I think that GRASS plugin is doing that. It may also happen that
a file is modified by another application ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] behavior of splitting feature
Message-ID: <51754433.7060008@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am dealing with multi polygons these days, and I find very annoying to 
not being able to split a part into several part.
First, am I right saying it's not feasible?

If yes, I would like to propose to add a choice to the splitting tool:
- split into several features
- split into several parts (only availbale for multi-polygon/lines layers)

Would you agree on this?

Then, how to propose this to the user?

1. Choice dialog after drawing the split lines (propose only if layer 
has multi geometry)
I think everybody agrees it's a bad option

2. Have two icons and two separate tools
Nice to use, but not to right direction in terms of number of icons in QGIS

3. Have a drop down icon as for the selection tool.
My suggestion.

If drop-down is the chosen option, I would also suggest to group add 
part with add ring, and also delete part with delete ring. It would 
therefore more coherent.

Greetings,

Denis

Hi Denis,

I agree - this is another improvement that should be implemented.

I would opt for option 3, with the drop-down buttons, or maybe also just
a modifier key. Option 1 and 2 is sub-optimal.

I would also welcome your other suggestion about the drop-down for
ring-manipulation.

Not sure how well such drop-down buttons would work on mobile devices
though. But mobile devices would need an improved UI anyway.

I'd also like to see a way to modify multi-point features.

You can use Multipart Split Plugin to split the selected multipart features.

Agreed: if at all possible, please join forces rather than duplicating plugins: from
the user point of view, it can quickly become a nightmare to move across hundreds of
plugins.

Agreed +1 Having all the needed editing tools in one plugin would be better, right now you need to install several plugins to do editing work, maybe getting them together under one roof and deprecating the original afterwards would make the experience easier for users and for writing manuals also

Hi Tim

I have created this pull request for review
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/550

It adds quite a few color ramps to the base QGis distro, which would
increase distribution by about 500Kb.  I have not changed the UI in any way.

Cheers,
Etienne

Hi,

I would propose that the editing stuff should go into QGIS core. It is
cumbersome having to download plugins all the time for editing.

I would also suggest to implement the CAD stuff in QGIS core. I can't
see why someone does not want to have these improvements.

That way the tools get more exposure to both users and developers.

Message-ID: <op.wvyhmjijna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

In todays master, clicking "Add class" doesn't add a class but overwrites  
an existing one. For example, create a graduated renderer with 4 classes  
and press "add class". You'll still have 4 classes but one of the original  
ones will be replaced.

Should I file a bug?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

I would prefer if most of the editing tools would be available in core
- - and if possible - implemented in C++.

They could be prototyped in Python and then later moved to core after
maturing.

I hate having to install plugins for simple things, like perpendicular
lines, swapping line direction, extend/trim lines, etc.

-1 from me -- please don't do this! I realise that it has some
limitations, but render caching makes a huge difference in speed with
my workflow.

I frequently use layers based off complex PostGIS views which take a
long time to generate. With render caching I'm able to selectively
toggle layers on/off or rearrange them for comparison without having
to wait for QGIS to request a new version of the view from the PostGIS
server. If I switch off render caching then every change to layer
visibility or ordering triggers a refresh of the view and a painful
wait in QGIS.

Obviously an ideal solution would be to cache the PostGIS layer
locally, but until that's possible render caching helps a lot...

Hi,

Thanks to all for the feedback :) I'm really not very familar with all the OGR 
encoding stuff. I applied my pull request [1] to allow wider testing. 

Many thanks to Minoru Akagi for two other patches. One of them is applied[2], 
the second not, because my patch covers this isue too. Your patch [3] was 
safer, as it just reset LDID to 0 on save, but I believe we should go on and 
use the encoding declaration. A big difference I see in our approaches is I set 
ENCODING to encoding name, while you you use "LDID/0". I guess the "LDID/" 
prefix tells OGR to use LDID instead of CPG? I think if we should use it for 
encodings supported by LDID, but I guess it's not worth of the additional 
work, unless some other important software prefers LDID over CPG. 

I also added Shift-JIS to the Shapefile Encoding Fixer plugin. Please let me 
know if any of you needs (or just knows) another important encodings.

Still there are two urgent problems:
- the "System" encoding has to be replaced with the proper value
- unit tests are still missing

And one longterm:
- after iconv conversion tio UTF-8 the layer doesn't remember the source 
encoding, so it's impossible to preserve it e.g when saving from Table 
Manager.

Maybe someone wants to take one of the remaining issues?

There's at least one already existing plugin which will do that.


Might be worth looking at.

Interestingly b is possible, but you have press apply all the time for changes to come in, and the snapping options window gets in the way a lot.

Maybe if you could dock the snapping options under the layer list, and changes auto applied, that would help a bit.

Unfortunately, the render caching feature has never worked on OSX. It is a greyed out option in the settings because the code was never stable on this platform. If it is meant to be a program feature, it would ideally be one that is available on all platforms.

Hi all.
I have tested in depth the Atlas and overview functions, and come out with a few issues:
* an overview map is not autocentered, so if it does not cover the whole area, the
overview does not appear on most prints: a known limitation, or am I missing an option?
* feature filtering does not appear to be working with $rownum: again, a known
limitation, or am I missing an option?
* it would be good (and used in other software) to put a transparency outside the
selected feature for each map: I remember this has been discussed on the ML, but I do
not know what is the fate of this functions: is there and I did not find it, or is it
something that has still to be developed? Any roadmap for this?
All the best.

 The snap settings window is already dockable. See general options -->

Backbuffering solves a lot of issues with the rendering cache. It was 
only introduced on Linux so far (to avoid flickering of the canvas) but 
maybe it should be enabled automatically if rendering cache is enabled.

Explanation:
Most crashes I had, happened due to recursively starting another 
rendering loop out of an existing rendering loop. Normally initiated by 
some user interaction. These user interactions wait in an event queue, 
which is only processed, a) when the rendering loop is finished or b) 
when processEvents is called. The backbuffering option removes the call 
to processEvents. This has some limitations like you are not able to 
incrementally draw features and you are not able to cancel rendering 
(Escape).

If leaving the render cache in the code, I would at least automatically 
enable backbuffering as well for the sake of stability.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi all.
I have been submitted an interesting if weird problem. Sometimes it is necessary to
show in legend, especially for rasters but sometimes also for vectors, an image that
shows an extract of the map for better clarity. In other software, this is done in an
ugly fashion, by disaggregating the legend and inserting an image.
I think we can do something better, by either defining among properties:
* an image to use for the legend
* a bounding box to extract the image from and put on the legend.
The first option seems simpler, the second is probably better, as it can update the
legend if visualization properties change.
Thoughts?
All the best.

 Hi Paolo,

 I would say 1) and 3) are just missing features. The client that paid 
 for the overview map feature did not request what you want. They just 
 had the overview map at full extent (that is what maybe 90% of users are 
 doing) and did not want to zoom in and auto-center. 2) may be a bug. 
 Could you open a bug request?

 regarding 3) will only work for polygon features - but Atlas also works 
 with lines or points. So it needs special casing for polygons. A missing 
 feature that you can ask Oslandia to implement. You will have to specify 
 if you want this feature on the main map or the overview map or both.

 Hi Paolo,

 There is always the option to export the legend to Inkscape/GIMP 
 (through SVG/PDF or PNG) change it and re-import it again.  know - it is 
 more complicated - but I think that QGIS cannot cater to all wishes/edge 
 cases, regarding the legend.

 Of course - you client/contact could hire someone to implement this 
 feature. But until then, the workaround through another graphic software 
 seems feasible to me.

Yes, of course they are ready to sponsor such a function, if there is a general
interest and consensus about this.
Exporting and reimporting is feasible only for occasional stuff, not in a regular
workflow.
All the best.

 Hi Paolo,

 From a cartographic point of view such functionality is 
 useful/important. Esp. when dealing with transparency and blending. If 
 you initiate such development, then please make sure that the legend is 
 also taking into account transparency and blending.

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for your reply.

Indeed, I'll try to do option 3.
I am doing this now, so it will probably be part of 2.1

Message-ID: <20130423092523.38d57711@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

is it possible to have clickable web links from features in the qgis
webclient? And if yes, would I need qgis master to use it?

And another question. I saw that e.g. qgiscloud allows to choose base layers
from google, bing, ... with qgis webclient. This does not seem to be part
of the "official" repository in github - right? Is it planned to integrate
this functionality or is somebody already working on it?

I found several mailings but not really a solution or clear hint.

Message-ID: <20130423112952.ed511c814052ad57ecbab54a@gmail.com>

Hi all.

I think many of us used labels to style maps and know that currently
QGIS chopped-off labels near map boundaries. This issue already
mentioned in your roadmap in wiki [0]: "Add option to have boundaries of map canvas's current extent act as obstacles to labels".

We (me and my colleague) tried to fix this issue. Our patch simply
test labels for intersection with current extent and drops any
items that not completely within extent. Also added UI for controlling this behavior. Code can be found at GitHub [1]

We tested it with our data and seems all works fine. Only one thing
is missed now ? support in QGIS mapserver.

I already talked about this issue and patch with Larry, but want to put it for wider discussion. Any opinions? Should we accept this
patch or it is better to wait for 2.1, or maybe look for completely
different solution?

I would be very sorry to see this feature go. I use it regularly since I
often work with huge datasets. E.g. loading the street network of a whole
country from PostGIS, I would have to wait for ages without the possibility
to cancel rendering.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] disjoint checking in geometry addPart
Message-ID: <51764214.1090004@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am wondering if this is correct to check if polygons are disjoint when 
trying to add a new part to a multipolygon.
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsgeometry.cpp#L3009

Indeed if you try add a new part having a segment in common with an 
existing part it won't be ok.

Also, while trying to slit parts, I cannot use addPart method as it is, 
because the parts are not disjoint.

What do you think?
Should we rather use GEOSOverlaps ?

Thanks a lot

Denis

Hi Anita,

Please don't get me wrong. I don't want this to be the default. But it 
should be the default with rendering cache enabled (if the decision is 
to keep rendering cache at all).

Regards
Matthias

I am surprised that people really used the render caching. I had all sorts of issues so I did not use it. To me it was really broken. I think we should remove it and reintroduce it when multithreading is implemented and the feature works as expected. Better not ship it than ship in a broken state.

	needs them
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xbkXS+tQ7UN3AR87r6UeG9MgFUtKXXhNSnx5Dp1HZXww@mail.gmail.com>

I was testing the QTiles plugin with QGis dev from Osgeo4w. It doesn't work
[1] because a line of code calls QImage.fill(QColor) which is a signature
supported only since Qt 4.8.
Looking into the Osgeo4w installer options, Qt libraries are 4.7 yet.
Are there plans to upgrade them?

I'm the opposite.  I have it enabled all the time and don't really have any
issues with it.

It's not doing any harm leaving it in IMO so -1 to remove it.

Hi,

How comes that the same feature works fine for some but is broken for
others?

When I have it on (using a combination of Postgis, WMS and GeoTiff) I
often have redraw issues and the layer toggeling often fails. Layers are
not drawn, but appear to be on with the checkbox in the layer tree or
vice versa. I think the main problem is when also using WMS sources.

Really strange ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] serious regression out of new vector api needs
	attention prior to 2.0
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=q6m5dJqMFxvFvkR1xyeGpwNcwszREVr1ZvFO4Rqir7mw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I've filed an issue over the weekend which IMO is a really serious
regression which shouldn't be left unresolved prior to the imminent
2.0 release.

Long story short, when a layer symbology is set to categorized,
graduated, or rule-based, all features will disappear when editing
feature(s) on that layer (by moving feature or one of its vertex). If
the user then leave the edit mode (saving changes or not), all
features will reappear.

When features disappear, an error pops up in the log window saying
"Already active iterator on this provider was closed".

Data itself is not impacted, but it's a super scary behavior for the
average user. It got me to cancel edits many, many times before I
understood what was happening.

Issue filed can be reached here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7660

Hi,

this changes doesn't solve issue for me. Crash happens even if only
vector layers with or without labels used.

Just finished testing with disabled caching and enabled backbuffer
(only vector layers with Single symbol style, one layer labeled
using PAL and scale-dependent labeling is enabled). Same result ?
first rendering becomes very slow, QGIS eats memory and finally crashed. Here is last console messages for this case:

Also you can use 'materialized views' [1] in Your database.

Which only moves the problem upward.   Maybe we should handle setFilterFid

I think the postgres provider had a separate (very short lived) cursor for

Apparently.  But my porting was more an semi-automatic effort - so didn't
really look closely at all the code.  And I wasn't aware that multiple
iterators were a problem - I thought that was kind of the point of the new api.
;)

But we have a few tickets for that.  Eg. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7472.  I
tried to link others related tickets there.  There are probably more.  The
submitters usually are not aware, that the problems are related.

I think this is a (real) blocker.

Yes, I see the same layer redrawing problems when using WMS and PostGIS
layers.

Hi Otto,

actually this works but is a bit outdated. If you are using the latest 
webclient with the popups you should be able to simply store an URL in a 
field and qwc automgically detects it and forms the <a>-tag around it so 
it becomes a clickable link.

Hi Bernhard,

thanks for the hint, but how would that work in pratice, if I don't want to
show the complete link but a description?

At the moment to display "QGIS Homepage" I use:

<a href=http://www.qgis.org>QGIS Homepage</a>

Althought there is nothing wrong in the non-core plugins overriding the core 
ones, it's always cleaner and clearer if they are installed only when 
necessary. So personally I prefer to keep the non-core version number always a 
bit lower then the core one, so after QGIS upgrade the installer will rather 
warn and remove the obsolete update, instead of updating it with the recent 
update ;)

Exactly. It's what I called "necessary" in the paragraph above.

This behaviour is present for years. The only addition still to be made for 
2.0 is removing the obsolete updates (now it only warns and suggests to do it 
manually).

Hi Otto,

you are right. This won't work. The automatic url detection is for 
simpler cases where users store a pure url in a field. This url is 
detected and displayed as a link without any html writing necessary.
So if you want to individually format a complete link with html tags you 
may do it as you showed. If you do
<a class="popupLink" .... the link gets styled as defined in popup.css.
I cannot test currently but I think that you might get another <a> tag 
around your link. Is that true?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis WMS server/client issues on Windows
Message-ID: <CACfnYnT-8Z_xHpn1Ww0tQ8+9FiX4F9=vurWLeCdq+j0O4_Qw2g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

a while ago for testing purposes I played around with QGIS server on
Windows and make it work as wms server and together with QGIS web
client.

Now I followed my notes again[0] and noticed a few (new?) issues with
qgis server and qgis used as wms client.



Here the cases:

*) qgis server 1.8, qgis desktop 1.8 as wms client

the url

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=c:/temp/teste18.qgs

works, while

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=c:\temp\teste18.qgs

does not. The error message is


"(No error code was reported) The WMS vendor also reported:
Configuration file problem : perhaps you left off the .qgs extension?"


and to make it work it is necessary to select the checkboxes "Ignore
GetMap... and Ignore GetFeatureInfo... ".

Is this the correct behavior?







*) qgis server 1.8,  qgis desktop master as wms client

trying add a layer using a wms layer created with qgis server 1.8, the
layer is added in the toc but is not visible and in the log I get:

Map request failed [error:Error downloading
http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=c:/temp/teste18.qgs&&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-23998.1550490432018705,-145303.2600138939451426,48776.5100903988350183,-71056.7674680688360240&CRS=EPSG:3763&WIDTH=376&HEIGHT=384&LAYERS=grid_hex_2000&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/jpeg&DPI=96&MAP_RESOLUTION=96&FORMAT_OPTIONS=dpi:96
- server replied: Internal Server Error

is this a bug in the QGIS master WMS client?




*) qgis server master, qgis desktop master or 1.8 as wms client

the url used is like

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=c:/temp/teste20.qgs

in the wms client the layer list is not presented and it just show the
project name. Trying force add this "layer" I get

WMS provider: Cannot calculate extent
(d:\src\qgis\src\providers\wms\qgswmsprovider.cpp : 126 :
QgsWmsProvider::QgsWmsProvider)
Raster layer: Provider is not valid (provider: wms, URI:
IgnoreGetFeatureInfoUrl=1&IgnoreGetMapUrl=1&crs=EPSG:3763&featureCount=10&format=image/jpeg&layers=teste20&styles=&url=http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map%3Dc:/temp/teste20.qgs
(d:\src\qgis\src\core\raster\qgsrasterlayer.cpp : 826 :
QgsRasterLayer::setDataProvider)


Is QGIS server master not working on Windows?




cheers

Hi Bernhard,

yes, that doesn't work properly. 

<a class="popupLink" href="http://www.qgis.org">QGIS Homepage</a>

ends up in a string ("QGIS Homepage' target="_blank">QGIS Homepage), where
the second link (QGIS Homepage) works and the first one is wrong. So that
doesn't work well.

But <a href=http://www.qgis.org>QGIS Homepage</a> is fine.

Otto

There we go. I'd like something, and it's already there. :)

Thanks, I'll try that out next time I'm in the office.

Otto,

I made a pull request fixing this issue. If a url is detected 
(http://something) in an attribute it is checked whether there is an 
opening "<a" - tag and only if this is false the tag is automagically 
created. So if you store a complete html-formatted link in your 
attribute it should be displayed as stored.

As Andreas said, this is expected behaviour, as usually the overview map

We discussed that already, and it is not an easy task. The trouble is with 
labels, which would appear anyway even if a mask (or transparency) is outside 
of current feature.
Some other are interested in this feature, so we can discuss about its 
implementation. Feel free to open a feature request issue as to gather user 
needs on that point. 
Among them :
* mask out all but coverage, labels included
* alternatively, make it transparent
* only display current coverage, not the others

Hi QGIS community,

- please forward this on as you see fit -

It's that time of year again when OpenStreetMap reaches out to the
community to find out what you've been up to. That's right - it time to
submit your presentation ideas for OpenStreetMap's annual "State of the
Map" conference.

If you have something interesting to present about your work with
OpenStreetMap and would like to tell the world, we would love to hear about
it. Simply fill out the "Call for Presentations" form explaining the topic
of your presentation. To keep things easy, at this stage we just need a few
words, not a full presentation. :-)

http://www.stateofthemap.org/info/call-presentations/
(Call for Presentations closes on Monday 10 June 2013.)



=== A bit more information ===

The State of the Map 2013 Conference to be held in Birmingham, United
Kingdom, from 6 to 8 September is calling for presentations.

The theme of this year?s conference is ?Change? so we are particularly
interested in presentations addressing this theme. Our programme will cover
a wide range of topics that will interest everyone from the new
OpenStreetMapper to the professional contemplating using our data.

We are seeking presentations from businesses, the public sector, charities,
and individuals.

If you have something to say, for example, about switching to OSM, barriers
to its use, apps for mobile mapping, changing community organisation or
behaviour, historical mapping, or just anything that you want to present,
then make sure you register your proposal with a a few words to describe
the topic.  Tutorial sessions are especially welcome!

Just to add a little more to the Call for Presentations:

This year I personally want to try and get as many people involved as
possible. We are therefore hoping to have a Poster Exhibition for people
who may not be able to attend in person (we can print them locally). If
this sounds interesting to you, please use the same form and specify
"Poster" as the "Session Format". Posters can be mainly pictorial, or
include text. You can bring it yourself or send an electronic copy for
local printing (Sponsorship to cover printing costs would be much
appreciated - If you know a company who would be interested, please let us
know).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Plugin as user interface for make and
	install automation
Message-ID: <CAMRukd3iCY8PN0zX4T1gs=kqRkeFhmg73NfzE3nS+XDgO2JJjA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Firstly, not sure if this post should go here or to
qgis-release-team;<qgis-release-team at lists.osgeo.org>
If my coin flip directed me to the wrong place, my apologies:

Before stating the question, some background:
The question pertains to the Q-Rap Radio Planning Tool (
http://www.qrap.org.za/) that is a plugin for QGis. The project works
nicely and the core functionality is quite mature. The plugin is however
not in a state to be submitted for distribution through the QGis plugin
machinery yet. The install procedure seems to be a stumbling block for most
users. Work to get the plugin in a QGis distributable state is on the
cards, but there is a lot of work to be done and few hands. In the mean
time, we would like to relieve the users of having to jump through hoops.

Please critique and/or give guidance on what we think would be a good
interim compromise.

Q-Rap Install Plugin:
We are playing with the idea to build a Python plugin as per guidelines
given for QGis Python plugins.
The idea is that this pure QGis compliant Python plugin can be distributed
through the QGis plugin machine, giving exposure and easy access.
The Q-Rap Install plugging job will be to automate the build and
installation of the currently non-QGis compliant C++ code. (The stuff
current and prospective users are required to do)
The build process under the plugin will be standard CMake approach.

What the Q-Rap Install Plugin will be doing:
-Check and advice user if current OS platform is supported
-Checkout the required source code
-Check/install required application (Posgresql, PostGis)
-Check/install required libraries.
-Kick of CMake build process and check results.
-Create Posgresql users and database
-Kick of second CMake build process to compile app, that will create
database structure
-Kick of app to create the database structure
-Kick of process to populate database with sample/test database.

After the Install plugin has done its job, the actual Q-Rap plugin will be
available in QGis ready for use.

The rationale is that we can get Q-Rap setup for the user in a semi QGis
way, without breaking QGis requirements.  As stated, we need to do a lot of
work to get Q-Rap into a native distributable state. We also think that it
will take us significantly longer to get Q-Rap in a native QGis state than
this interim solution.

Thank you kindly,

Johan Ballot

Hi All, +1 for the new needs
We already discussed this before, in separated topics. 

I pointed those needs in my personal roadmap for QGIS 2.1 here [0], which
means I want to fund some work:
[0]
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6Tp0QqKdkY65vQ5v94-8WpltcOxWTbQh2ow5tTkQCQ/edit


The main issue is to find some way to label features only in a sub area or
mask. This could be done in differents maners where you devs can help us:
- add a general 'masking' feature, with option on layers to label only
inside mask. Are we able to do that with reasonable perfs? Atlas could
dynamically generate such a mask. We need some buffer options , and style
options for mask layer. My prefered option by now, if possible. 
OR
- Add a 'labeling' layer in layer order panel, so that user can choose id
label can be draw 'under' other layers. It might not be easy to understand
for newcomers, and will always make qgsi calculate labels everywhere in
canvas. 
- Any other idea?

If we achieve to a common proposal, that could help me to speed up to put
some money on that. 
Cheers All
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 'File' versus 'Project'
Message-ID: <5AA6CAD5-5FF5-4708-BD50-81941899C2AB@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was having some discussion on IRC today with Tim and Larry about the recent change to the menu in trunk. Before, the menu used "File" and that was changed to "Project". My position is that it does not seem Mac-like, whether or not a QGIS document resides in the filesystem as a .qgs file or if your "Project" is fed from a database, something apparently planned for the future of QGIS.

I'd be interested in feedback from other Mac users on this. I'm flexible to the change, but wanted to vet this and see if anyone else had a strong opinion one way or the other. Please make it clear if you are a Mac OS X user or not.

Thanks,
John

Thanks, John, for bringing this up for consensus.

A little of background. The change was made as a GUI setup for the future,
for use with database-based projects (which are not currently implemented),
and so it matches what a Project is, semantically.

It is definitely not Mac-like to not have the File menu, but it does not go
against Apple's HIG to rename the File menu...

 'If your app is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to
something more appropriate or eliminate it.' [0]

It does go against what normal Mac users may expect.

+1 for keeping it as Project (and for keeping Composer instead of File,
too), so we can have 2.0 docs and their screen snaps be as future-proof and
cross-platform as possible.

One other bug I encountered is that annotations should be turned off
for overview maps - currently it makes using annotations impossible.

Yes you have the correct list!

Don't you think it would be easier to just have your python plugin
fetch pre built binaries for the supported platforms and then extract
them into a convenient place? Some time ago I added support for
loading C++ plugins form user defined locations - though this is not
well tested. So your workflow might be:

* user installs python bootstrapping plugin
* bootstrapper fetches a binary zip and extracts it on ~/.qgis or ~/.qgis2
* bootstrapper manipulates qsettings for QGIS to include the extract
dir for the binary bundle
* bootstrapper uninstalls itself and prompts user to restart QGIS
* QGIS starts and discovers and loads QRAP from the user c++ plugin folder
* go home and enjoy a lekker cup of rooibos tea

If you are targetting linux platform, you may also consider just
making binary packages e.g. deb / rpm.

This sounds good. The original discussion we had was for the view
extent to be treated as a collection of linear features that a label
placement request would collide with. This would cause chopped labels
to be shifted inwards away from the boundary if there is a valid label
placement available to them. In your implementation I guess the label
is just dropped even though there may be space on map for it? If I
understand this correctly then your approach seems a good start though
I think the second way I mentioned would be better in the long term.

Interesting. I'd say this is going to look as odd at home on my mac as at work on their windows box. No file menu - that's going to look very unfamiliar.

That said, it's a good name. It does describe what's in there - those commands work on the project-file not a layer-file.

Right, I thought it was the same cursor, but in fact they were called
differently ("qgisf[N]" vs "qgisfid[N]"). But still with OGR there is
not guarantee that it will work - if the driver does not implement
random access to features. Not sure about other providers...

The point of the new API was to get a common flexible interface.
Multiple iterators are currently a problem mainly because previously
the providers were not designed to work that way. There was just the
implicit assumption that it's possible to use nextFeature() and
featureAtId() at the same time - although likely not working in all
cases. I would like to address multiple iterators in the 2.1 release
together with threaded rendering.

Thanks for gathering the related tickets into one place. Right now it
seems that all those problems lead to the handling of changed
geometries within vector layer's feature iterator
(fetchNextChangedGeomFeature()). We could update that code to first
finish iterating over features from data provider and only after that
fetch remaining features (by ID) with changed geometries that have not
been considered before (in the main loop) - at that time the internal
provider's iterator will be closed already, so there will be no
collision. This change should also lower the amount of queries to the
provider: if the feature with changed geometry is still in the filter
rectangle, no superfluous "feature at id" queries will be issued.

Does that sound good to you?

Martin

Hi Paolo, I don't see how the second option is really much better, at least for vector layers.  If you specify the bounding box manually then there is still nothing to make sure it contains an appropriate part of the map.  e.g. for a layer using the classified renderer, if someone edits the attributes of the feature in the bounding box then it might be in a different class, and your legend would be wrong.

A better solution for vector layers might be this: provide a drop-down list of all the features (listed by fid) in the layer/class/rule, so the user can either just show the symbol by itself (the way it works currently), or select a feature from the drop-down list to display the part of the map containing that feature.  

This approach would still have limitations e.g. changes to the data or project might mean that the selected feature is hidden behind something else.  But if changes to the feature mean it is in a different class, then the legend would simply revert to either displaying just the symbol by itself, or displaying the next feature which is still in the class.

Note that if you implement something for this you can probably close http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4094.

Alister

Hi

Is there anywhere a summary of the Python API changes for version 2.0, as a guide for porting plugins to the new version.

I'm guessing that with the focus on cleaning up the API this may be a work in progress, but if there is something available that would be great.

Thanks

Hey guys,

I have made some changes to the interface of the modeler, taking into
account a couple of suggestions from Tim and Andreas (thanks!). Not a
big change, but I guess it's a nice usability improvement.

Before starting rewriting the corresponding part in the manual and

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

I agree - live map extents to be used in the legend seems to be quite
unpredictable to me and/or complicated to use. I would opt for static
images as a background - easier to implement and more reliable.

Hi all,

I have noticed that since I updated OSGeo4W yesterday, I cannot launch QGIS 1.8. It stops loading when the splash screen gets to Loading Python.

I also get the following error when trying to run a python script from the OSGeo4W shell:

G:\>zip_data_test.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\OSGeo4W\\apps\Python27\lib\site.py", line 563, in <module>

    user_site = getusersitepackages()

Does anyone here know how to fix this? Is this a problem for the OSGeo4W people instead?

Hi,

seems this caused by recent Python upgrade in OSGeo4W. I think rebuilding QGIS will solve this issue.

I install QGIS from the OSGeo4W installer.

Does that mean I need to wait for a rebuild of QGIS to be put out in the installer?

Thank you Victor - looks good (only tested with the sample models).

I still haven't really started using SEXTANTE but will for sure in the
upcoming weeks. I will try to replace some of the simpler FME workflows
with a SEXTANTE workflow.

Will report if I run into troubles or have suggestions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] today nightly build issue when geoprocessing
	vectors
Message-ID: <CACfnYnTr6ur5YruqrP4U-mVXJp5uVpi=sCiqcg=XXKx1KdsXHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm the only one to have big troubles with the latest qgis master when
doing some kind of vector geoprocessing?

If I use a tool in the vector menu, when I click "ok" when it asks me
if I want to add the result to the project, then qgis crashes (seg
fault).

If I do some kind of vector geoprocessing with sextante the result is
added to the toc, but then zooming or just touching the toc causes
qgis to crash:

Warning: QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
Segmentation fault


anyone else?

cheers

Well, I have reconsidered this and it may be better to call
QgsVectorDataProvider::startEditing() from
QgsVectorLayer::commitChanges(). It is not probable that permissions
changes when the layer is opened. It is more probable that user
decides to cancel changes, this way we avoid not necessary reopening
of files.

It should not be important for API and implementation in providers
where we call it from vector layer, we can move it around in the
vector layer later.

I added to QgsVectorDataProvider:

virtual bool startEditing();
virtual bool rollBack();
virtual bool commitChanges();
virtual bool isEdited();
signals:
  void editingStarted();
  void editingStopped();

As I said, to keep names consistent with vector layer. Currently not
implemented nor used. It would be useful to have it implemented for
2.0 at least in ogr provider to resolve #6448 at least for reading.

Currently all editing methods in postgres provider do changes in
transactions. If we implement QgsPostgresProvider::startEditing() it
should start new transaction and all changes should be done within
that transaction. Are there any potential problems?

Should the startEditing() / commitChanges() close all iterators?

What transaction should use QgsPostgresProvider::getFeatures()? That
opened for editing or another one?

Ok. I've been standing at the bottom of a large-ish hole today, so if this sounds like a dumb idea that's my excuse.

Could we move Layer across next to Project?


Some reasoning.
1. If we're abandoning File in favour of Project, then there's possibly no reason to retain Edit next to it either. Other than historical ones.
2. Project and Layer are largely about opening, closing, saving (and other similar things) files. Project files in one menu and Layers (vectors, rasters, DB, etc) in the other.
3. Then you have a more logical progression from left to right about how to use QGIS. (Open stuff, change stuff)

-ramon.
(OK, 1. is not so good, but it does open the door to ask questions!)

Thanks for the reply.

I have tried 2. QGIS opens but then complains about sip. This doesn't fix the command line problem.

So I am awaiting for 1. to happen :) 

As suggested on the OSGeo4W mailing list (http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/ANN-Python-2-7-4-td5048404.html), renaming the python27.dll in windows\system32 (or syswow64) works, but it means ArcGIS wont.

I think it means that for us there are two options,

1. In a little bit they'll rebuild 1.8 and put it on the installer.

2. Find the python upgrade that just changed and run it back a version. (When you run the update, things that you have installed will say either the new version that it's about to install or Keep if there's nothing to do. If you click on the Keep it will cycle through a few things, one of which should be the last installed version) No guarantees about what will happen though - I'd try 1 first.

Ramon,

I would agree with those points. In fact I think the menu structure as is
doesn't make much sense and the Edit menu should be renamed to Feature/s.

What does Edit mean:

 - Edit Layer
 - Edit Feature
 - Edit Project

If you look at all the tools in the Edit menu they are all related to the
current feature or features.  The undo and redo actions should be moved to
the layer menu.

Here are my thoughts on the Layer menu:

http://i.imgur.com/oYO55Qz.png

Moving the Add xxx Layer to the project menu would mean you follow these
actions when creating a new project:

Project -> New
Project -> Add xxx Layer

Change the style

Layer -> Properties

That is a more logical flow IMO then currently what is there.

Thoughts?

- Nathan

Hi,

even GetCapabilities of a QGIS mapserver WMS tells jpeg is a valid
format for GetLegendGraphic request, trying this format results in an
exception telling that GetMap does not support "jpeg" format but it
works with the not listed "jpg". Pull request #554 [1] adds jpg, jpeg,
image/jpg and image/jpeg as valid formats to GetMap and GetLegendGraphic
requests.

Hi,

I am working with the valuetool plugin and would now like to get the

already a solution in another plugin for that or does anybody has an idea how
to solve this with pyqgis?

Hi Otto,

I have done something similar for landit plugin (DTM values).

There is three methods: nearest, linear and bicubic interpolations.

You can found the the code here
https://github.com/3nids/landit/blob/master/elevationdialog.py#L120


Cheers,

Denis

I'm not sure if I agree with that : getting a snapping engine that works
smoothly will require a lot of tweaking, which is a pain in C++ compared to
python.

Also, some user will be interested in adapting the snapping engine to suit
their particular habits, which is easy when working with python plugins.
And some other users won't be interested at all in this kind of tools.

About the problem of installing multiple plugins : it would of course be
much more elegant if all the CAD-drawing related tools were neatly packed
in one plugin, which could then even be preinstalled or "featured".

No way around that - you can put ArcGIS' python27.dll somewhere ArcGIS will
find it first (bin?), but won't force everything else to use that particular
version.

Well, my original reaction when I saw the File->Project change was that it's very non-standard, and may cause more cofusion than it's worth.  Certainly on OS X, maybe on other systems.

People know what the "File" menu means, even if the main object of an application is a "project", or video or email or whatever.

Same goes for the "Edit" menu.  And it's standard position is right next to the File menu.  Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy and Paste are the basics for the edit menu, and should work in dialog text boxes for copying and pasting text, as well as whatever document editing they may do.  Do not move Undo/Redo, more confusion.

I realize that this may be Mac-centric, but the OS X HI Guidelines seem to be generally followed or adapted on other systems, and these File and Edit menu changes are a bit radical.

Message-ID: <20130424162328.7a984fd6@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

how is it possible to update the list of available layers in a python plugin
automatically, when I add or remove layers from QGIS legend?

To load the layers I use QgsMapLayerRegistry

Regards

Hi Otto,

Not sure to understand what you mean.
But, can't you update your list by connecting signals either from the 
layer regirstry, or the legend interface ?

Would it be possible as a first interaction if all the CAD/Drawing tools be merged into a single plugin so the plugin library be less crowded and we knew exactly what tools are available? I disagree that some users wont be interested in this tools, some users are just doing analysis and that is fine but to be able to perform analysis and models you sometimes have to create the data, having the tools to create the data is part of every COTS GIS software and it should be part of QGIS. Of course if a user is just doing analysis he would just hide the tools

I would prefer if most of the editing tools would be available in core

- - and if possible - implemented in C++.

I'm not sure if I agree with that : getting a snapping engine that works smoothly will require a lot of tweaking, which is a pain in C++ compared to python.



Also, some user will be interested in adapting the snapping engine to suit their particular habits, which is easy when working with python plugins. And some other users won't be interested at all in this kind of tools.



About the problem of installing multiple plugins : it would of course be much more elegant if all the CAD-drawing related tools were neatly packed in one plugin, which could then even be preinstalled or "featured".

William,

I can understand the concern, it was the same thing that went though my
mind when I change the composer menu. In the end most people didn't care,
or adapted.   There are a lot of applications that don't use a file menu
and work quite well, I would say better in fact.

Regarding the Edit menu, you will notice that the tools in there are not
related to text or documents they only refer to the current feature, or
selection of features.  If you have a dialog open you can't use that menu,
unless the dialog is non model and in that case still doesn't help you as
there are no tools to use on text.

If the Edit menu is to stay, that is fine however I would suggest a new
menu called Feature/s which houses all the current tools in the edit menu
minus the Undo/Redo and Copy/Paste Feature.

Regards,
Nathan

Ok now I see what the discussion is about. Seriously changing File for Project what was the rationale for that? Pretty much standard to use File and it wont cause any confusions. I am going with William on this issue

I am having a second look at the menus and can I ask why would you want to crowd the menus with the same actions you already have icons for in toolbars? e.g.  Edit menu has all the same tools as the Advanced Editing Toolbar (I highly doubt users doing serious editing would use menus instead of icons)Layer menu has all this add layer types the same as Manage Layer Toolbar (would look better with just an icon that opens a file dialog to whatever data you need, an universal add data button type) IMHO it seems a waste of space and makes things crowded

Ramon,
I would agree with those points. In fact I think the menu structure as is doesn't make much sense and the Edit menu should be renamed to Feature/s.  


What does Edit mean:
 - Edit Layer - Edit Feature - Edit Project
If you look at all the tools in the Edit menu they are all related to the current feature or features.  The undo and redo actions should be moved to the layer menu.


Here are my thoughts on the Layer menu:
http://i.imgur.com/oYO55Qz.png



Moving the Add xxx Layer to the project menu would mean you follow these actions when creating a new project:
Project -> NewProject -> Add xxx Layer


Change the style
Layer -> Properties
That is a more logical flow IMO then currently what is there.


Thoughts?

Ok. I've been standing at the bottom of a large-ish hole today, so if this sounds like a dumb idea that's my excuse.



Could we move Layer across next to Project?





Some reasoning.

1. If we're abandoning File in favour of Project, then there's possibly no reason to retain Edit next to it either. Other than historical ones.

2. Project and Layer are largely about opening, closing, saving (and other similar things) files. Project files in one menu and Layers (vectors, rasters, DB, etc) in the other.

3. Then you have a more logical progression from left to right about how to use QGIS. (Open stuff, change stuff)



-ramon.

(OK, 1. is not so good, but it does open the door to ask questions!)

I just tried this feature and my impression is why is this enabled on the canvas view? This features are more suitable for the composer and having two ways to achieve something is not always a good thing. You can control in a better way how things look in the composer anyway. For me it doesn't make sense to have this enabled in the Canvas

Hi Nathan,

Here are both of your example programs on OS X. You will see that the menu observes the OS X HIGs with a File and Edit menu item in the main menubar of the OS for both of these applications.

http://imgur.com/NaxyYMi

Adding changes to Edit to the list of desired updates to the GUI takes this even further afield from standard interface design for OS X. I think you will be disenfranchising one of the supported operating systems with these changes and that it will make more sense to keep the File and Edit layout, in addition to cleaning up some of the other OS X gui issues, like having the "Analysis" menu item from plugins showing up between the Window and Help menu items.

Regards,
John

While the Mac HIG clearly states that changing the name of the File menu,
or removing the File menu, is fine, the following are definitely not a good
idea in my opinion:

* Having anything except Edit to the right of File/Project
That would not only be unconventional and confusing to users, it gains very
little compared to the significance of the change. IMO it should absolutely
be avoided. Clearly the Mac convention here is to have File, Edit, [View],
[Main Component], [Lesser Component], etc. (older Mac conventions had View
more towards right end of bar) This is shown in Apple's Mail program [0],
where the main component is a mailbox and the lesser a message. In
Photoshop it is: File, Edit, Image, Layer...  Following these conventions
any Feature menu should be located just right of the Layer menu, and the
Layer menu just right of Edit or View.

* Moving Layer items into Project menu
While using almost all Mac software the File menu is visited only when
initiating, saving, exporting, printing, or ending a work session,
regardless of whether it is file-based in nature. While working within the
session, almost always component menus are used. For example, a similar
layer-based program, Photoshop, places all it layer-related actions under
the Layer menu, not the Image menu. IMO the Layer menu actions should stay
where they are

However, the menu could be cleaned up a bit. Having a submenu for adding
data sources, and sub-grouping by type with separators, will allow growth
of the submenu without cluttering the main Layer menu [1].

* Moving editing function out of Edit menu
The main editing currently done in QGIS is on features, aka 'Digitizing'
for the toolbar, so it is logical for those editing functions to be under
the Edit menu. I agree with William in that undo/redo should always be
located there, as well as copy/cut/paste and delete functions. Currently
copy/cut/paste refers to only 'features,' which makes no sense if you are
not editing features. Those should be generic and only be Copy/Cut/Paste
and Delete or Clear, or be dynamic and change relative to what is being
edited (that would be more work, though).

So, maybe there should be a Digitizing submenu under Edit. Other items that
programs commonly place under the Edit menu (some not currently implemented
in QGIS) are spell-checking, text manipulations (upper, lower, etc.),
special character inserts, select functions (currently under View),
find/search functions, and others. So there is functionally room to grow in
that menu, outside of just feature editing actions, i.e. Edit menu should
not be considered for removal.


As a separate suggestion: if we wanted to minimize our menus better and
prepare for unknown future functionality grouping and expansion, we could
create a Tools main menu, which could have Vector, Raster, Database and
Analysis submenus. This would make room for a Feature main menu, for
example, and allow future growth within Tools without forcing yet more
horizontal growth of the menubar. Downside is that it adds an extra layer
of submenu mousing to get to commonly used actions.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Antonio,

I think it is more about having consistency for the platform than anything else. We want the user to find the application familiar. The death-knell of many an OS X application on review sites is how non-Mac-like the application feels. Users expect the menubar to exist and to provide a means of navigating standard application operations.

Developers will provide their own customization in different formats. Microsoft Office has their "ribbon" interface that provides "organized" drop-downs and formatting elements outside of the menubar, but you are able to do most of the same stuff by navigating the menus and options therein.
http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Office-for-Mac-ribbon-default-1024x614.png

I think we can achieve the customization desired while maintaining the HIG for OSX.

Cheers,
John

This would help with the problem of the Analysis menu item showing up between the Window and Help menu items. I've often felt that a more consolidated approach like you describe would be much better. And we have the ability to customize all menu item functionality with custom shortcuts, so those that don't like the extra clicks can work around that by creating shortcuts.

Cheers,
John

Ignoring the other suggestions for a moment, changing the File menu name to
Project (or Composer) does not go against the HIG for OS X (the initial
discussion of this thread). This has be established. It does affect user
expectations, however.

This is frowned apon by HIG folks - all tool buttons etc should be
accessible by menus as far as possible - a user may have disabled a
toolbar, may have accessibility software that uses the menu system to
activate functionality etc. In short adding a toolbar button should never
be an excuse for removing a menu item.

Tim

Why bundle instead of having a separate installer (like is done with the
base GDAL frameworks, etc.)? Same question for the osg/earth frameworks.

Also, when you get things situated for the release and you have time, I
would appreciate any build notes, so I can add such support to the nightly
build.

Larry

I think this is debatable. Per our irc conversation yesterday, there are semantics to what constitutes a document-basis for a program versus a non-document basis. My understanding of the exception in the HIG is that a program that does not have a document that the program operates on can consider removing or renaming the File menu item. From the HIG [0]:

"In general, each command in the File menu applies to a single file (most commonly, a user-created document). If your app is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate or eliminate it."

I consider a map project to be a document, whether it is based off of a physical file, *.qgs, as it currently does or whether it is a record in a db, a possible feature for the future of QGIS. I don't see the wiggle room on the HIG for QGIS consequently.

Regards,
John

Having scale (scalebar) and distance (via grid) is handy when panning
around in the map view, taking application screenshots, screencasts,
exporting the canvas as an image etc. These features are disabled by
default so they should not cause you any interference if you don't
want to use them. The copyright decoration functionality could
probably be replaced by current map annotations implementation I
guess...

As much as HIGs are good they are guidelines at best, they are not meant to
tell everyone what to do in every case all the time. Apple, MS, etc don't
even follow their own HIGs. If I was proposing to change the colour and
style of all the whole interface to red with pink borders and use fully
custom widgets then I would say sure follow the HIG and scrap the idea.
However changing File -> Project was like changing File -> Composer in the
print composer,  it was a bit of a "ohh there is no file menu" but people
handled it fine and no one complained.  I would say the composer even feels
better now from a UX point of view because that first menu is named after
the thing it takes action against.

I ran a workshop the other day with some new users, and lots of existing
users, all who had only just installed 2.0 for the first time and none
freaked out.  The menu will only take people two seconds to see and notice
that it's the same stuff that is in File and move on with their work.

Regards,
Nathan

My understanding of the exception in the HIG is that a program that does not have a document that the program operates on can consider removing or renaming the File menu item. From the HIG [0]:

True enough.
It'll look a little odd.
It's not going to be quite expected.

I'll even agree that a project file is a document of a sort.

But GIS programmes, particularly the way QGIS thinks about things use at least 3 different sorts of documents. In this case, Project files, vector files, raster files, then arguably database files and web service files. The menu has them lumped up as File (or Project) and Layers[1].

I think while it will be odd for about 30 seconds, it will make sense and most people will be happy.

-ramon.
(with apologies for side tracking everyone)

[1] I suppose I've always felt a bit odd about the use of File in QGIS's menus because I might touch that once a session, but the vast majority of the files (documents) I use come in through the Layers menu. Doesn't make a great deal of sense to me but such is life.
If we're allowed to rename it to something that better reflects the content, then shouldn't that happen?

Simplicity for me and ease of use for users.  My general plan has been separate packages for stuff (GDAL & co.) needed by multiple other end-user packages (GRASS, Mapserver, QGIS).  And maybe for tools useful on their own (python modules, and yes, could be SAGA, OTB, TauDEM), if I have time.  And a little bit of whatever I feel like doing factors in there also ;)

I did consider an OSG/earth package, but never got around to it.  QGIS is the only thing I use that needs it, though I was briefly interested in OSSIM, and there were small build issues early on (now sorted out).

The main thing is a user bundling cmake script for SAGA, OTB and TauDEM.

Do you need any build info for those?  OTB isn't hard, just a simple patch.  SAGA is a bit of work because of missing autotools in the latest Xcode, and it needs wxWidgets.  TauDEM needs some work, a few of us are in communication with the developer to fix it up.

I think when I looked at it a year ago I was put off by Windows/Arc-centric nature of it.  ... ugh, just a quick browse of the source doesn't look good - mix of windows and unix line endings in some files needs to be fixed (maybe the compiler doesn't care, but it's hard to read), and assumption of available headers/libraries, like MPI.  This may not be an option for OS X, at least in the near future.  It's also disappointing that the author didn't use libtiff, so that taudem could support lzw compression and bigtiff.

Agreed: for "real" users, installing >1 package, having to deal with paths, different
versions, and possible incompatibilities, can be a significant hindrance, often a
blocker.
The easier the better.
All the best.

It is already ;)

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/landit/

But it's for QGIS >= 1.9

Right now it's only working for one band raster. I needed it and could 
not spend much more time on it.
I might push a new version handling multi band rasters.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi all,

I personally would prefer two plugins, one with CAD-like functions 
(constructing, snap to middle of line etc.) and one with more GIS-like 
editing functions (clip, fill holes and the like). If you look at the 
current CAD-Tools plugin it is already pretty crowded but we are talking 
about at least the double amount of functions.
Implementing the plugins in Python could create more support in 
programming from the community (I have no idea about performance, though).

Hey all,

The logo comp has now moved into the final rounds and we have to pick at
winner out the designers left. The designs there are not final yet and I
will be giving feedback to the designers to iterate their designs into
something that we like. I have updated the design brief to include the
community aspect and that it must also work as a desktop icon.

I have just sent of an email to 99designs to get the final round extended
by another 7 days in order to collect more designs and have time for people
to view and comment.   If there are any variations of the designs. or a new
direction, please post it here and I will update the comp with those
details.

The round with the designs is here
http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397.

REMEMBER: These designs are not final until the last minute so we must get
feedback to the designers if we would like to see something different.

Regards,
Nathan

@Andyzendy #50 is good. However, would it be possible to have new
design based on #50a (e.g. #50a)  with a globe inside Q or a raster +
vector graphics inside the Q.

Thanks, Noli

I second that, most of my users need this enabled to "get" the scale of 
the things displayed (so they can stop editing nodes when the scale is 
at 4cm...). QGIS isn't just a composing tool.

As I already said, this should even be a default : always useful for 
those who needs it, disabled once & for all for those who don't.

For me -1 to have a globe in it - I would prefer it more abstract.
Also she should remove the 'uantum' from the logo so it just says
'QGIS'.

Hi,

I agree - not a big issue to change the menu from "File" to "Project".
It also makes sense to me since all of the subentries in this menu
relate to the project - and not to files (like shape files, tiffs, etc.)

+1 for leaving the first menu entry as "Project". It also helps to
clarify for people that they are saving a project - and not their edits
in files that are open in the project.

Things in UI design change over time. Nothing is written into stone and
users have to accept that and adapt. I think that the change of the icon
set and the UI redesign are way more disruptive thant the change in the
menu. But I think they are an improvement.

Just look at your favourite applications - lets take webbrowsers - with
every version their UI changes a bit - and people do not have problems
adapting.

Or - if you are a graphic designer - compare the versions of Photoshop,
Inkscape, Gimp, etc. - all of them change their UI over time - and yet
the users manage to do their jobs - and usually they can do their jobs
better with each version.

Hi,

I would also like to keep it abstract and only Qgis as text in the logo and
not Quantum GIS. I like the idea of #33. It looks still like an evolution of
our current logo with arrow.

http://99designs.de/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/33

But I would also like to see #33 more abstract and less colourful as in #65.

http://99designs.de/logo-design/contests/qgis-needs-logo-210397/entries/65

So my favourite would be a mixture between #33 and #65 and only with QGIS
and not Quantum GIS as text.

Regards
Otto

Hi all,

When I write:

f = QgsFeature()
f.setFields( layer.dataProvider().fields() )

QGIS crashes

Here are the two involved methods

void QgsFeature::setFields    (    const QgsFields *     fields    )

virtual const QgsFields& QgsVectorDataProvider::fields    (     )     const


Anybody has an idea??? Did I do something wrong?

Thanks

Denis

Denis,

Try this:

fields = layer.pendingFields()
f.setFields(fields)

I think it is a scope thing, or object ownership.

Martin, is that what the issue is?

+1 for me too, I didn't even noticed the name changed. I just went there 
and clicked.

I think the main concern is for new users, but new users will be 
exploring what each menu has to offer. Experienced ones, will just go 
there automatically.

furthermore, changing from file to project we make clear that save saves 
the project and not the data, maybe even helping avoiding what happened 
to mad_ on irc yesterday [0]

Do you get any answer about this point ?
In my case I have 95%  Oracle RDBMS. Actually with  QGis 1.8, I can?t access these data. It coul?d be a very, very sad news if the next main release couldn?t  give a full support to Oracle?

Dear Sirs,
I tried the Qgis development version (1.9 alpha).  I am interested in connecting to Oracle Db 11.
Currently known considerable slowness in accessing Oracle tables.

several times asked the SRID for no reason.

By improving definitely have access times that are excessive. If you are interested in as soon as changes can I re run the test.
The 300 dpi printing for now does not work and crash the Pdf generation

Salve.
Grazie per la segnalazione. A quel che so questo dipende da come sono strutturate le
tabelle nel tuo DB. Dato che sei in una posizione ottimale per farlo, avendo pieno
accesso ad un'istanza reale di Oracle, potresti inoltrare le tue considerazioni in ML
qgis-dev? Sarebbe di grande aiuto per migliorare la situazione.
Grazie mille.

Ola.
Che sta succedendo? Qualcuno ha intenzione di muoversi? Mi pare sia stata
esplicitata una lista minima di chi e' interessato a far ripartire l'associazione.
Possiamo iniziare a lavorare in questo senso? Mi pare che la prima cosa da fare sia
la convocazione dell'assemblea, e le opzioni siano:
* attendere il GFOSS Day
* convocarla prima.
Voto per la seconda opzione, per non perdere ulteriori occasioni importanti; penso
si possa trovare una data fra maggio e giugno, in un luogo raggiungibile dalla
maggioranza degli interessati (immagino la scelta sia fra Bologna, Firenze e Roma,
ma qualunque alternativa per me va bene).
Saluti.

Yes, an evolution of the current logo would be good for recognition 
(although eventually people will get used to any)

#334 falls into this category as well, but I'd prefer to have something 
which can be put onto a transparent background.

My "I'd stop right away working on android qgis since I could not touch

My I'd enjoy touching this:

Hi Borys,

I agree to specify the ENCODING option. LDID/87 does not have definite
meaning (depending on the environment), so avoiding to write shapefile
with the value would be nice. If the output encoding is UTF-8,
QGIS/OGR will generate cpg file that contains "UTF-8". This behavior
must be ideal. In case of the other encoding, even if there is a
problem with the content of a cpg file (e.g. use in another
application. I am not much sure about cpg file), the user will be able
to fix it easily.

Similarly, how about specifying the ENCODING when creating new
shapefile (in createEmptyDataSource())?

In QgsVectorFileWriter, how about always using SHAPE_ENCODING="" ? It
will solve the problem and never make any encoding conversion failure
with current encoding listbox.

Thank you for your work on the plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] restoring geometry from postgis
Message-ID: <5178F748.8040705@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to recreate a QgsGeometry directly from the geometry field.

I have the geometry field like
01030000201555000001000000090000009651A84762EF28C19A0D0EA8ACCA52C1DCFD96C48B3934C1F31438F4260F53C106D7B89F97CF32C185BB1404A97654C1C8894E831C4E1EC1A2DDD7AE97B455C1C8B6A8CD9BF303C1F3EE3A19015656C120A82FD12965F7C064C3417A07C054C1B071B0D568BBFEC04A8C063F72BE52C12C927E235F9C1EC11B03D25FD96852C19651A84762EF28C19A0D0EA8ACCA52C1

I assume this is EWKB, right?

I am trying to use QgsGeometry fromWkb without success.

Is this feasible?

Thanks,

Denis

Hi

I like the logos from dakcarto [2] but only the simplest with an arrow for
the Q and if it get rid of the hands.
Keeping the globe inside, removing the hands, and (why not) add the colour
from the removed hands on some of the globe stripes, and I would like it :)

Hi Denis,

The QuickWKT plugin contains useful code that converts EWKB to QgsGeometry.
>From this long wkb textstring, we will need to decode the geometry
type,coordinate system and geometry data. That is what I understood

I think #391 looks pretty amateurish. #303 is slightly better but overall,
I'm not convinced by the designer.

Best wishes,
Anita

Seems much easier to modify QTiles (as shown in the bug report) than to
upgrade Qt to 4.8, which may or may not have other side-effects.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0 and PyQT v2 update
Message-ID: <5179915E.7000801@carto.net>

Hi,

It has been discussed that PyQT should be updated to v2 befor the QGIS
2.0 release. Is this still a feasible goal?

I think it would be good to also update it before 2.0. With the new
Vector API most plugin developers need to rework their plugins anyway.
It would be good to also do the PyQT v2 update now.

It would be bad if would release QGIS 2.0 without the PyQT v2 update and
then shortly after we would break all plugins again, because of the PyQT
v2 update.

Is Martin the one who would work on this - or can/will others work on
this as well? Martin - will you have time?

Thanks,
Andreas

Yes, that's what I did (I suggested it in the bugtracker).
My question was in general. Are there blocking reasons to not upgrade to
4.8?

Hi folks

It seems that every jenkins build generates errors. A few errors seem to
have been around for quite some time...

>>> TestSuite.PyQgsSymbolLayerV2 0.28 sec 61
>>> TestSuite.qgis_rendererstest 0.85 sec 217
>>> TestSuite.qgis_composerhtmltest  7.4 sec 596

This is confirmed on my box

The following tests FAILED:
 14 - qgis_rendererstest (Failed)
 28 - qgis_composerhtmltest (Failed)
 57 - PyQgsSymbolLayerV2 (Failed)


It would be nice that responsible parties fix either the cause of the
failed tests or revise/remove the tests.

Cheers
Etienne

Hi all,

I have gone though and removed any of the ones that got bad feedback from
people and any duplicate feeling icons. Most with Quantum in the logo have
also been remove except for a few because they are the only one of that
style.  I have left feedback on all the designs about things like removing
the Quantum bit, adding more community feel, more abstract world, etc.

Regards,
Nathan

Couple of questions with regard to QgsFeature fields and attributes:

1) Are there any guidelines/constraints regarding field names.  The delimited text provider can take names from the first line of a text file, and that can be very arbitrary.  I'm wondering if I should put more constraints on the names (maximum number of characters, valid character set, other...)

2) It seems that fields get referred to in various places as fields and attributes in the API.  Is there any logic to this.  That is to say, where should I use the word "field", and where should I use the word "attribute"?

Thanks
Chris

Hey Chris,

1) I don't think there is any limit.  The name is just stored as a QString
so anything it supports QGIS should too.

2) I have noticed that too it is quite confusing at times.  To me fields
should refer to the column information, and attributes should refer to the
data it self, but that is not always the case in the API.

It only matters if you plan to export to certain data types, ie 
shapefiles have a quite short naming limit (based on the dbf 
limitations, 10 char I think). I would avoid spaces, underscores and 
other special characters too.

Enjoy,
Alex

Since blend modes are found everywhere else
(vector,raster,label,composer items), an exception to allow addition
of blend mode on the only remaining gap would make sense.

There are some limits in shapefiles concerning names in the attribute 
table, coming from the dbf - format. So, if at first the column names 
are e.g. longer than the eight characters allowed in dbf, and the user 
stores the data later as a shapefile, in this way, a problem could maybe 
  arise, especially if the long names are similar at the beginning...

Albin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSGeo4W troubles
Message-ID: <6c8144a80670a7194fcda2b08b4e1746@carto.net>

 Hi,

 For some reason, with the most recent OSGeo4W build, I get a 
 "qgis-dev-bin.exe" and "qgis-dev-browser-bin.exe" instead of 
 "qgis-dev.exe" and "qgis-dev-browser.exe" in the directory 
 "%OSGEO4WROOT%\bin". The qgis-dev.bat still references the old name and 
 therefore QGIS cannot start.

 Why is this change to the "-bin.exe" versions and why wasn't the 
 qgis-dev.bat updated accordingly?

 Thanks you for clarification.

 Andreas

 Hi,

 The shape files should not constrain us with the column length anymore.

 Meanwhile, QGIS-Dev (master) even handles the column shortening and 
 conflict detection (if shortened columns collide because of the 
 shortening) correctly. This wasn't the case in older versions. Thanks to 
 whoever fixed that!

 Personally I would avoid characters outside of the [a-zA-Z_] range in 
 column names. Some formates may have troubles with these other 
 characters.

I already discussed this with Andreas, and I agree 100%. If it is
feasible to do it before 2.0, it will be much better for all plugin
developers.

I would be happy to do the switch, though I will be on holiday for the
next 10 days. I can have a look at it when I come back. But if there
is anyone willing to give it a try in meanwhile, feel free to do it
:-) I am attaching a diff with preliminary changes to switch to spi
api 2 - if anyone would like to play with it.

IIRC there are few things that need to be sorted out:
- dealing with QVariant::Type which is used e.g. in QgsField. Most
likely we can safely switch to using QMetaType::Type (QVariant is not
directly available anymore)
- take care with transition of QSettings [1]
- provide a shortcut that python tests and third-party scripts could
use for setting sip api 2 (has to be set explicitly if not running
within QGIS)
- migrate any plugin code within QGIS source tree

Yeah something is likely wrong with the ownership. Needs some

If the startEditing() and commitChanges() are going to be called
within QgsVectorLayer::commitChanges(), then I find the names
confusing and begin/commit/rollback-Transaction() would be IMHO
better. They do different things, so they should have different names.
And while using startEditing() and commitChanges() is necessary for
editing within QgsVectorLayer, calling those functions in
QgsVectorDataProvider should be optional (edit functions should
automatically open a transaction and then close it afterwards).

I do not see any right now.


> Should the startEditing() / commitChanges() close all iterators?

Good question: this needs more thoughts. Closing them makes sense
because with some providers the iterators would not return correct
results. However that would mean that some code will stop working.

Hi Victor,
looks nice, but I'd wait updating the manual until we have a GUI freeze - I still
think some smaller refinements would be useful to mate it moer QGIS-like.
I like the advanced/simplified interface button.
All the best.

Hey Paolo,

thanks for the ideas. Any suggestion about how to change the
appearance to improve it and make it more QGIS-like?

Anyway, I 'd probably update the manual, and then if needed, rewrite
it. I do not mind doing that, but I would like to have docs
synchronized with software as much as possible...otherwise, it might
be confusing for users (maybe I'm being too optimistic thinking that
users do read the manual....)

Thanks!
Victor

Hi Victor,

just tested new SEXTANTE Commander. Really nice feature, but there
is one drawback. When Commander activated it is impossible to
interact with the rest of QGIS/SEXTANTE interface until it was
closed.

Yes, I still have to work on the UI a bit. Unfortunately, I am not an
expert on PyQt, and the only way I found of  of making the commander
stay there is to make it modal. I tried other ways, but they ended up
having the commander floating around other windows, which is not a
good thing.

Suggestions are welcome

By the way, I will update the docs with a description of the commander
and how to create custom commands for it (it's really easy...)

Cheers!

Hi.
I would happily leave this to one of the GUI gurus around.
One thing that might improve usability, and be more QGIS-like, would be to have only
one popup, with modeler, options, etc. as separate tabs (as e.g. in Add WMS layer) or
left icons (as in most current popups - see e.g. Laye properties).
BTW, we still need a general GUI cleanup; even if we cannot implement all for 2.0, it
would be important to have guidelines, both for core stuff and for plugins (core and
external). Anyone is working on this?
All the best.

I'll remember it. I'm going to come back to manager development as soon as I'm 
done with shapefile encoding.

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  OSGeo4W QGIS 1.8 Doesnt Work
Message-ID: <20130426150745.186180@gmx.com>

Hello.

I'm having the exact same problem.
I think maybe it's related to a Grass RC2 to RC3 update.
The file called when you open QGIS 1.8 is C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis.bat
I opened that file and I have:

@echo off
SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC2\etc\env.bat
@echo off
path %PATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC2\lib
start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\qgis\bin\qgis.exe %*

But since I updated Grass, the file
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC2\etc\env.bat
and the folder
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC2\lib
don't existe anymore.

I opened the file that calls QGIS-dev (C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis-dev.bat) and it points to the new install of GRASS 6.4.3RC3:

@echo off
SET OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\o4w_env.bat
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC3\etc\env.bat
@echo off
path %PATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3RC3\lib
set QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT:\=/%/apps/qgis-dev
start "Quantum GIS" /B "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\bin\qgis-dev.exe %*

I tried then to tweak C:\OSGeo4W\bin\qgis.bat but with no sucess.

Can anyone help ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Shapefile Encoding summary
Message-ID: <201304261815.37039.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Most of the encoding issues are fixed, and there is still one big problem left: 
the unresolvable "System" encoding. It's a special Qt codec and unfortunately 
there is no way to figure out which particular codec is hidden behind this one. 
It's choosen in different ways depending on the OS, iconv presence etc. So if 
you use this "System" encoding when saving a Shapefile, the OGR/iconv doesn't 
know how to encode it. Well, it's probably solvable still, but a bigger 
problem is the "System" name goes to the .cpg file. Such cpg is of course 
useless, but it also forces QGIS to enable the OGR conversion, blocking the 
possibility to adjust it in the encoding combobox.



After spending some days on it, I believe that above all we should rename 
the "Ignore Shapefile encoding" to more meaningful "Shapefile encoding 
autodetection (experimental)", set it to false by default and warn in the 
documentation to never use this option together with the "System" encoding. It 
generally fixes the problem in a coarse manner and is a basis for any further 
convenience. Do anybody agree to do that? Regardless of this flag, QGIS 
properly writes the encoding declaration to cpg file. In QGIS 2.1 we can easily 
add our own encoding autodetection, what will just set the encoding combobox 
instead of forcing any internal conversion, like OGR's one does. 

Alternative solution would be, I guess, unacceptable: to completely get rid 
of the "System" encoding from comboboxes and make UTF-8 default encoding. The 
major advantage and disadvantage at once is forcing users to be aware what 
encoding they use. However, I assume most users use windows and Shapefiles in 
local codepages, and it could be unacceptable for them to switch from the 
default UTF-8 to their codepage after every QGIS installation.



Ok, I assume we encourage users to turn off the autodetection (turn on 
ignoring), and tell to those decided to use it anyway to not mix autodetection 
with "System" encoding. But regardless of autodetection/ignore state, if a file 
is saved with "System" encoding, QGIS puts this name into the cpg. Non-empty 
cpg forces OGR to turn on the conversion from indefinite encoding (unless 
ignoring is on). Even of we make a workaround in QGIS, the fi can be broken in 
other software. I see three possibilities:

1. Only include the "System" encoding to comboboxes when opening existing 
Shapefile and take them out from those where you save one. So users can use 
System for opening files, but they have to specify a particular encoding when 
saving Shapefiles. The default output encodung (in a fresh installation) would 
be UTF-8 of course. The question is: do we only use it when autodetection is 
on (ignoring is off) or always? In the former case it doesn't prevent most 
users from creating .cpg files containing the useless "System" string, so 
"partially corrupted". In the latter - we force all users to use real 
encodings on save, but the efficacy is very high (except layers created by some 
plugins, as authors will surely forget to disable/enable the "System" in 
QgsEncodingFileDialog).

2. Let the "System" exist in all comboboxes, but in case user use it for 
saving, just don't create the .cpg file.
Disadvantages:
- unclear behaviour, as it creates some layers auto-recognizable, some not
- I'm not sure if saving to "System" will always work properly

3. Let the "System" exist in all comboboxes, but in case user use it for
Disadvantages:
- annoying
- only works in when QgsInterface is available

At the outset, this will render almost all third party plugins inoperable.
If this change is to be made, we need to widely publicize the fact to users
that some or perhaps all of their favorite plugins may be broken at the
release of 2.0.

It will likely take a while for many of the plugins to be upgraded to the
v2 API. Some will probably be abandoned and stuck at 1.8. We will need to
ensure that the plugin installer can prevent installation of incompatible
plugins in 2.0 as well as 1.8.

We have already rendered many plugins inoperable by changing the vector 
api (and some other API's) so lots of plugins will need some love to 
get ready for 2.0.
Then there is the PyQt API V2 change which will render some more 
plugins useless.
And I was just remembering, that I've heard, that the upgrade to PyQt 
API V2 is done to be ready for Python 3. So it's probably also worth 
considering, if the PyQt version changes and python upgrade should 
happen at the same point in time. I have never upgraded code from 
Python 2 to Python 3 myself, but there seem to be some differences 
which require work to migrate.

In order to be able to plan the plugin development. Is the upgrade to 
Python 3 something which is really considered to happen in the next 
couple of years? Would it not scare too many plugin developers and 
users away, because it will require once more a considerable effort to 
update?
If Python 3 is not an option for the next couple of years, is it worth 
upgrading the PyQt API now?
Would it be better to upgrade to Python 3 right now! Because this will 
require plugin developers to go over all their code now. Once only.

I know it's quite late (with respect to the 2.0 roadmap) to bring this 
up, but I haven't really thought of it earlier and I think it's a very 
important decision.

+1 for pushing (Borys') work on the plugin installer to a high priority 
feature for 2.0

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Delimited text plugin and file encoding dialog -

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E12B25D94E2@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

The new delimited text plugin GUI has a selector for file encoding which I added (to support different file encodings!).

However I've just noticed that there is a QgsEncodingFileDialog which already supports selecting encoding for a file (though it is not much used in QGIS).

It would make sense to use this for the delimited text plugin, but that would make the provider dependent on the gui library, rather than just the core library.  So I'm just wondering if that is considered "A Bad Thing".  And whether using the QgsEncodingFileDialog would keep the plugin more consistent with the rest of QGIS, and so would be A Good Thing?

Thanks
Chris

Making the provider dependent on GUI lib would be bad IMHO.  Probably
one could split the UI and the provider itself so that the add delim
layer ui is in he gui lib.

Done. Will work as soon as QGis.QGIS_VERSION os set to 2.0

The current version must be within the range: 
(qgisMinimumVersion - qgisMaximumVersion). 

If qgisMaximumVersion is not explicitly set, the default value is: 
qgisMaximumVersion = floor(qgisMinimumVersion)+0.99

It's implemented in the installer and, additionaly, in the new repository to 
allow an initial filiering there.

I'm trying to manage until Tuesday, but at this moment I can't even estimate 
the probablility of success. I only have tiny time resources and they were 
mostly eaten by the encoding issues (much more important).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] On-The-Fly CRS Transformation Does Not Apply
	+no_off Parameter
Message-ID: <CADVpKTopPgeByefMms7JSTWyMN4EvjvAFKHaLd7C6L1Y2fvVPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,


This query is about a discrepancy between projection results using the *Custom
CRS Test* and *on-the-fly* transformation, and not about RSO per se.


The Proj4 parameters for GDM2000 / Peninsula RSO (EPSG:3375) as given by
epsg_tr.py (GDAL 1.9.2) are:

+proj=omerc +lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25 +alpha=323.0257964666666 +k=0.99984
+x_0=804671 +y_0=0 +gamma=323.1301023611111 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs

This Malaysian projection requires the +no_off or *+no_uoff* flag (both
works) for rotation at the natural origin as of proj 4.8. To test, I
created a custom CRS based on GDM2000 / Peninsula RSO adding this flag.
However, there seems to be some discrepancy between the on-the-fly derived
results and the Test in the Custom CRS definition dialog.


I set the project CRS as the custom CRS I created and added the test point
in WGS84.

Test points: *1.827764875* deg N, *103.640259872222* deg E (WGS84 EPSG:4326)

Expected results: Northing *202,122.062* m, Easting *627,096.132* m
(EPSG:3375)

*The test points and projected coordinates are taken from the GDM2000
Technical Manual published by the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia.
*

*Test results (standard EPSG:3375)*:

cs2cs ? -240332.04, 958936.71

QGIS Master (13d35ac) On-the-fly derived: Y = -240,332.0326, X =
958,936.7057

QGIS Master (13d35ac) Custom CRS Test:* -240,332.0326* N, *958,936.7057* E

QGIS 1.8 On-the-fly: projected coordinates not derived

QGIS 1.8 Custom CRS Test: -240,332.0326 N, 958,936.7057 E

*Test results (with +no_off flag)*:

cs2cs ? 202122.06,  627096.13

QGIS Master (13d35ac) On-the-fly derived: Y =* -240,332.0326*, X = *
958,936.7057*

QGIS Master (13d35ac) Custom CRS Test: *202,122.0625* N, *627,096.1317* E

QGIS 1.8 On-the-fly: projected coordinates not derived

QGIS 1.8 Custom CRS Test: 202,122.0625 N, 627,096.1317 E


It looks like the Custom CRS Definition Test dialog is giving the correct
result, but the on-the-fly transformation is ignoring the +no_off flag.


Is the on-the-fly transformation using a different transformation process
and reading the proj4 parameters differently, or am I going about this
wrongly?

Hi all.
Do you have an idea of how much work is this? Could this be fixed more efficiently in
a cooperative fashion, iterating the same changes over all the plugins, or does it
require a lot of ad hoc adaptations?
All the best.

+1 with Matthias, we should plan pyqt2 and python 3 for a future release. I
see major risks in migrating now when we are in feature freeze with so many
blockers to solve in 2 months. We have very few users and developpers that
did real test to migrate to pyqt2 and python 3 , so we might have major
issues hidden in there. 
We users really need 2.0 to happen this year in a stable state and I guess
this is already a great challenge. 
My two cents.

The original motivation for that methods was to reopen files in r+
mode, not to start transaction in DB provider. It is not possible to
reopen files in each provider edit method and startEditing() would
have to be obligatory. However, as I am thinking about it more, it
seems that reopening files could cause more troubles than keeping them
always in r+ mode. Until now, it does not appear to be a problem to
open files in r+ mode, apart the slowness on Windows which is only a
side effect. The suggested read only mode + VSI cache was only a
workaround, not resolution of the problem which is in OGR.

I'll probably remove those new methods. If we find it necessary to use
read only mode for files, we can reopen them in r+ first time a
provider edit method is called. That should isolate the problem in OGR
provider. Begin/commit/rollback-Transaction() may be added later, it
should not break the API.

The same question probably applies to all provider edit methods.

The layer extent is:
xMin,yMin -166.532;-55.1121 : xMax,yMax 178.372;71.1777

so I don't know what coordinates are to be forward transformed in your 
error message. Has your road style and labelling any coordinate information?

It works for me on QGIS Lisboa and without styles, but looks a bit weird 
in the middle of Africa.

I made some tests with the similar Michigan omerc projections and ran 
into the same problem:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4910

It looks like it is a GDAL problem.

Ah, so on-the-fly is using ogr2ogr and the custom crs test is just using
cs2cs.

I'm using the "Primary road" style which comes with nightly by default.  
The style alone seems to work. Once I enable labeling using street "name",  
the forward transform error pops up.

Earlier today I used a different style and no error happened so you might  
be on to something with your theory that the road style contains  
coordinate information.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

I can confirm this on Mac. However, it doesn't happen when labeling is
turned on, but when symbol levels are set (and labeling is on). Symbol
levels and labels work individually, but if either is turned on when the
other is on the error occurs and force quitting becomes the only option.

I get the following (note it is being on-the-fly transformed to UTM here):

Debug: src/core/qgspallabeling.cpp: 1305: (registerFeature) Ignoring
feature 1893 due PAL exception: Geometry Type is unknown
Debug: src/core/qgscoordinatetransform.cpp: 623: (transformCoords)
Projection failed emitting invalid transform signal: forward transform of
(25075.946436, 81366.459079)
PROJ.4: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=utm +zone=13
+datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs
Error: latitude or longitude exceeded limits

I've traced it to line 1057 in qgspallabeling.cpp [0]. Just guessing, but
it looks like something is different between how the features are sent to
QgsPalLayerSettings::registerFeature from
QgsVectorLayer::drawRendererV2Levels as opposed to
QgsVectorLayer::drawRendererV2, which works fine.

Please create a ticket if you have the time.

Hi Anita,

Tested here on a fresh git pull of the master branch (1959182), it works
well with lakes.shp.
Can you share your project file ?

Handling the setFilterFid requests so that they don't interfere with other
iterators - thereby reviving any code that implied that featureAtId is possible
while select()/nextFeature() is ongoing.

But judging by the lack of tickets that complain about this, I suppose with
frequently used OGR drivers it worked.

That's what I thought - ie. the closing of active iterators is a temporary
kludge.  But I didn't think that we would release 2.0 with that (at least not
after I found that this was introducing regressions).

Not really - sorry ;)

To me it sounds like extending the kludge.   And identifying the affected code
is probably not that easy either - I suppose just a few were tagged with
tickets yet.

Some of the code (eg. some stuff in fTools) probably should be reworked anyway.

The question is who has enough time to work on any of this...

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=ztuUikjg=XR2hY=EgiYgEwv_mJm1LCauBYckGrHypkLA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm doing some test with memory intensive plugins.
I've noticed that when I stop a plugin that has allocated a lot of RAM, the
memory isn't released.
The plugin launches a separated thread, then I kill it. I even unload the
plugin, but memory remains as high as when I stop it.
Shouldn't/couldn't QGis release it?
How to deal with it?

I've just submitted a pull request for this change (#567). This
request also adds the related feature of inverting the overview frame
(ie, shading outside the area covered by the linked map). Since this
wasn't discussed as part of the original exception, I'll let someone

Hi Aakash,
great to hear this!

As a first thin I would suggest you to build the android QGIS so you get 
all dependencies working and so on.

Some bugs I'd suggest you to look into, are:
- http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5170
- http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7732
- http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6037

For your application, it is fairly straight forward, you need to write a 
proposal similar to [1] where you explain what you would like to 
achieve, subscribe and introduce yourself to the qgis-developer (added 
to CC) [2] and see what people think. I'd like to mentor you, just 
please remember that this is a serious commitment.

Regarding your skills, it looks good, and yes qml is not that hard to learn.

Looking forward to read and comment on your proposal

ciao

Hi all.
In current master, there is an option (Data defined properties) to rotate a symbol,

All the best, and thanks.

Thanks Hugo,

When I create an empty project and test it, it works ...

I'll try to track the problem down and share a project file that doesn't  
work. Unfortunately the current one is a bit messy :)

1. Maximal: If the freeze is postponed, tomorrow I'm trying to do as much as 
possible and in the evening I write a report and publish the unfinished branch.

2. Minimal: I only make necessary updates to the old Installer (just a few 
fast fixes) and completely postone the new one to 2.1.

3. Intermediate: I don't invest time into the full option, instead I try to 
only embed the old installer into the new manager window. They will exist on 
separate tabs without functional and visual merge. Hopefully it should be 
feasible to implement tomorrow (still not so trivial thought).

The advantage of the third option is althought it's not the final merge, QGIS 
2.0 would have only one window for installing and managing plugins. The 
confusing separate menu entry would be gone. But of course still we would have 
one tab for enabling/disabling, and separate one for installing/upgrading, 
what is messy. I believe we should have one tab for all activities on 
installed plugins (enabling/disabling, upgrading, uninstalling) and a second 
for installing new stuff. Of course it requires much deeper integration.

What do you think about the options?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labeling gui redesign and expression-based data
	definitions
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-Xqu8jBvDyjyxw5JKA9qEu2k2H4nJjxQPDErUM1xxdTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Similar to Borys' dilemma, I am try bringing the new labeling features and
gui to a reasonable release state, but need a couple of days more to finish
things up (excepting existing issues, etc.).

I have added expression-based data definitions for labeling (bringing
functionally on par with current symbology implementation), but need the
rest of the week to clean it up and fully turn it on for existing and
missing data definitions. [0] slideshow, [1] branch. Note: if you build
that branch, only new-style data definitions and the new tool button work
for a label's *font size*, all others are currently broken/unimplemented.

Things left to do:

* Re-work current labeling gui (not very difficult, see last slide in
slideshow for older sample of how it will look). This will include
integration of the inline data definition tool buttons, which not only give
feedback on the state of the definition, but also disable appropriate
layer-level widgets if a definition is enabled.

* Freshen up the current implementation to be cleaner and more flexible
with the API, and refactor QgsPalLayerSettings, QgsPalLabeling and the
canvas labeling tools to utilize the new data definition methods.

I believe I can finish this by the end of the week. IMHO, it would be very
good to get labeling to this state for 2.0, current bugs and issues
notwithstanding. This will allow a reasonably functional and flexible
labeling system (with expressions), to be used while a much larger
rule-based system and refactoring is being worked on for 2.x.

Any comments on my completion and committing of this work by week's end?
(then on to bugs/issues)

Would it be possible to integrate the left panel in the panel of the 
vector layer properties as a tree widget, as we see in many software [0]?
I think this would be much clearer and space saving but I understand it 
won't be that straightforward in current structure.

It looks great! I think the wait is worth it!

Do you think it could be interesting to integrate this also in the 
settings dialog? If the left panel can be integrated as a tree widget 
item in the panel of the settings dialog (as I just proposed for the 
labelling).

Borys from me I will be happy for the full implementation even if it delays
the release a couple of days.

Not sure I follow that.  Why would you want plugins in the settings dialog?

Well, I like the idea of having everything grouped.

For example in pyCharm everything is in one dialog: application and 
project settings. And you can search for anything in a search bar.

If the left panels can be nested (as suggested previously), I would even 
consider integrating the project settings in the main settings.

I would leave them directly accessible from menus of course, but just as 
shortcuts leading to the main dialog but with the right panel open.

You then would have everything accessible at one place.

I don't mind the idea but I'm not for plugins living in the settings
dialog.  Plugins are not settings they are their own standalone thing.

Having some kind of settingsWidget() method exposed on each plugin that so
that we can add plugin settings in the settings dialog is not a bad idea,
but I think the installer and manager should live outside of the settings
dialog.

I understand. My point of view is that everything can be thought as a 
setting, and some softs are doing this and I like it. But it's no big deal.

That's a great idea. But it would be confusing as settings can be 
application or project related. Unless you put everything in a dialog 
setting ;) Joke apart, it's a great idea.

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E12B5731BAF@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

As we are looking at API tidy ups (I understand), would there be any support for providing a bit more granularity in supportsSubsetString.  At the moment this is a simple boolean, and the GUI offers a SQL based subset string builder.

However not all providers naturally use SQL based strings.  I'm interested in adding subset capability to the delimited text provider, whichi I've done using QgsExpression as the basis for subsets.  This works very well except that the GUI isn't an expression builder.  I think there may be similar issues with the WFS provider.

What I am proposing is something more like an enum QgsDataProvider::SubsetStringType, which could then be interrogated by the properties dialog to select the appropriate query builder dialog.

Logically this would supplant the supportsSubsetString boolean which could be deprecated, replaced with

virtual QgsDataProvider::SubsetStringType QgsDataProvider::subsetStringType(){ return NoSubsetString; }

Other types could be SqlSubsetString, ExpressionSubsetString, ...?

Thoughts anyone?

Thanks
Chris

I'm a heavy pycharm user but I find their settings implementation
completely overwhelming. Even with the search functionality I can never
find particular settings easily. Given that experience, it makes more sense
to me if we keep options close the thing that is being configured (i.e. as
per current plugin implementation).

There is a long history of moving tabs from top to the left and back, so it 
should be quite simple to replace the recent QListWidget once more with 
QTreeWidget, but...

You aim at a complete gui revolution, what deserves for a broader discussion.
Note that besides plugins, also styles, customization etc should be 
integrated. Well, personally I'm happy with separate windows. But even within 
the present Options dialog a tree could be reasonable to make the tabs less 
crowded... I'm not fully convinced to this idea, because I like the 
possibility to fold the list to icon-only mode. With more and more tabs it 
would become useless.

Anyway, such significant GUI revolution should be probably done either before 
2.0 or wait for 3.0... And I guess we release the 3.0 in maximum two years.

Thanks for your replies.

This idea came out this morning mainly from the labelling gui, where I 
think the tree widget might be really useful. And I am wondering if a 
general mechanism of integrating dialogs in others by merging their left 
panels should be developed.

Otherwise, regarding the plugins settings in the main dialog, I got your 
point and I almost agree ;)

Thanks again,

Denis

Dear Community,

at the hackfest in Valmiera we started to plan the new QGIS website based on
bootstrap and there is a group of people who would like to help/assist
working on it. 

What we now need to create the new website is someone who is willing to take
the lead for the web project. Someone who has already knowledge with
sphinx/bootstrap and knows how to proceed and who can implement it and
coordinate the group of volunteers to assist.

If you think you are the right person and have some time to spend for the
new website, please tell us. Any help is appreciated.

Kind regards
Otto

	2.0 ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4HpZ7ESk5c9Ywqo-fArT0KzhUtwhsX-W+iF5wGXR6EsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

Ren?-Luc (aka reluc) has completed the getStyle request for WMS. It allows
to get a SLD style for a specified layer with parameters :
SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetStyles&VERSION=1.3.0&LAYERS=layer1,layer2&STYLE= .

This feature would be a great addition for web client based on QGIS Server
: combined to the WFS request, it will allows clients as OpenLayers to
retrieve data with WFS and the style to apply with getStyle. (even if SLD
export does not match exactly the QGIS style features)

You can see the changes here:
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/commit/833e00447f240b1f8e1424ea20fbe0d13e3c1583

Do you think we can add this modification into QGIS before 2.0 ?

Cheers

Michael

The best thing would be to define this as flags, where a provider can
say, which types of subset it supports. Support for QgsExpression could
actually be directly implemented in the base class
(QgsVectorDataProvider) and not in a specific provider, as it can be
applied to any provider.

I think the supportsSubsetString would then have to be replaced by
supportedSubsetTypes(), which returns a set of flags which tell, which
types a certain provider supports.
Your method would then most likely become currentStubsetType(), which
tells the currently enabled subset method.

>
> Other types could be SqlSubsetString, ExpressionSubsetString, ...?
I was always wondering if it would be possible to translate a
QgsExpression (or at least a subset) to native provider SQL. Like a
database abstraction layer. This would allow to develop plugins
independent to data providers while keeping the possibility to let
database servers do the job they're best at.

+1, having to rely on a search bar for settings means IMHO that the 
settings organization is badly designed. I totaly agree with Tim, 
PyCharm is super, but their settings panel s***s :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Manager - consultation for the best solution
Message-ID: <201304301211.19532.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

I need your advice which direction should we take to store plugin metadata in 
QGIS 2.x. I started to work on Solution 2, but now I think maybe the first is 
better? It looks much simpler anyway. I'd be happy to see some response asap, 
as I'm going to implement it until lunch and go further today... :)

SOLUTION 1:
The QgsPluginManager is created as soon as application starts and it persists 
all the application life time. Once it's created, it reads installed plugins 
to the QListView model (like it used to do now), and then Python (if 
available) uses QgsPluginManager API to add extra metadata (of available 
plugins) directly to the model. So QgisApp::showPluginManager() only calls 
exec() of existing QgsPluginManager instance.

SOLUTION 2:
The QgsPluginManager only exists within QgisApp::showPluginManager() (like 
now), so I create a new global C++ data structure for all plugin metadata: 
QgsPluginMetadataRegistry. When application starts, C++ pushes metadata of 
installed plugins (both C++ and Py) there, then Python (if available) adds an 
extra metadata for available plugins. Finally, when an user opens the 
PluginManager, it has an access to the joined metadata. All filtering is done 
by QSortFilterProxyModel. 

In addition, this QgsPluginMetadataRegistry class provides transmitting slots-
signals for communication from C++ to Python. For example: because the install 
procedure stays in Python and the "Install" button is ported to C++, we need a 
way to connect signal from the C++ button to Python. But in this solution 
QgsPluginManager is created on user's click, while the Python is already 
loaded on startup. So first Python (on startup) connects to signal from 
QgsPluginMetadataRegistry, then the manager (when created) can ping this 
transmitting slot. I guess it's the simplest way (within solution 2).


==========

Regardless the solution 1 or 2, I'd like to extend QgsPluginMetadata class to 
make it more multipurpose. Now it's only used internally in QgsPluginRegistry 
and only contains two fields. I'd add the complete field set (what won't bother 
QgsPluginRegistry) and use it also as a main metadata item everywhere. 
Everywhere means:
In solution 1 - QgsPluginMetadata as a PLUGIN_DATA_ROLE data in QListView item 
In solution 2 - QgsPluginMetadata as a base for QgsPluginMetadataRegistry 

I'd also remove QgsPluginItem class and include its fields into 
QgsPluginMetadata.

So the present state is:

1. QgsPluginRegistry - the registry of loaded plugins. Data are stored in 
QMap<QString, QgsPluginMetadata>

2. QgsPluginMetadata - a simple class for the map above. It's only used 
internally within QgsPluginRegistry. It only contains thee fields:
name, library and a pointer to the living plugin object.

3. QgsPluginItem - seems it's obsolete and could be easily merged with 
QgsPluginMetadata. More details: it's similar to QgsPluginMetadata, just 
contains another fields and is used in one place only: in 
QgisApp::showPluginManager() to get data from 
QgsPluginManager::getSelectedPlugins().


The proposed solution:

1. QgsPluginRegistry - leave it as is

2. QgsPluginMetadataRegistry (only solution 2): parallel to QgsPluginRegistry

3. QgsPluginItem - remove it and include its two fields to QgsPluginMetadata

4. QgsPluginMetadata - make it an universal plugin metadata object


==========

In all cases, all the QgsDetailed... classes are not used anymore, and they 
only stay for GRASS Plugin.

It seems they moved the help docs in the  GRASS website. I will try to
redirect it.

One note: this module might have some problems with the extent and
cellsize, since it takes no input layer, so no automatic extent can be
used. i will check it later today, and fix it if needeed

Thanks!

Hi all.
Once sextante has run some grass module (failing BTW), I cannot use the GRASS plugin
until I close the mapset and reopen it again. The error is:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/grass64/lib
QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=
comando: /usr/lib/grass64/bin/v.net --interface-description

GRASS_INFO_ERROR(9792,1): G_getenv(): variabile LOCATION_NAME non impostata
GRASS_INFO_END(9792,1)

Seems to be related to recent changes in .grass6 usage.
Should I file a ticket?

All the best.

What do you mean with "closing the mapset"?

better a less obtrusive and faster module, like e.g. r.info?

FYI, other pages show well. Are they all taken from website, or from the grass-doc
package?

I see it takes a raster in input, in fact.

mmm, maybe it' would be harder to actually check that it has produced

from website. Maybe docs for that module were removed

True :-) anyway, I will check that in case there are modules in that situation..

Hey all,

There is only one day left in the logo comp.  I have already had the final
round extended three times so this is it.  Please let me know if you have
any feedback you would like me to leave on the designs at

I think Larry said he is working on some new revisions of his logo which I
am keen to see.

a good solution.
local files should always be there, except in some Linux distro, *if* an user decides
to install just grass, not grass-doc.

Hi Nathan,
I like the first three #338, #50 (removing "uantum"), #336.
I also like the idea that money goes to one of our devs.
I agre that some refinement to #338 and #336 would help to look more professional.
All the best, and thanks a lot for having taken the lead on this.

Hi Paolo,

I added a more appropriate description.
"Multiplicator for attribute values" it is now. I did not mention "mm" 
because it can also be in map units. Additionally I hid some unneeded 
controls (for attribute selection) and switched to tabs, as we 
fortunately have the vertical tabs for toplevel elements now.

Do you think it's better now?

It was not my intent to encourage the postponement of these features to 
a later release.

I wanted to get a decision about inclusion or non-inclusion which is 
not based on time-constraints of the developers, but instead is 
strategic decision.

In my opinion, it can shed a bad light onto the project and discourage 
developers from maintaining their plugins if they've got to rework the 
whole plugin with several subsequent major releases.

If this is a top-priority goal for 2.0 I don't mind having it excepted 
from the API freeze (and therefore rendering the API freeze pretty much 
useless) for a week or two.

Concerning Python 3: This is a mail from 2010 which states, that there 
is the possibility to support Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-January/008803.html
If this is really possible, I don't see any problems with postponing 
the Python 3 update, as we'll be able to have a painless grace period.

Thank you for your feedback
Matthias

my favourites are:

still 280 followed by 50 and 338

nice logos anyway .. but in most of them i dislike the complete round O ..
in 280 i can understand the round most because of the "compass" lookalike

Hi

Could you ask AndyZendy to make one the same as #50 but replacing 'auntum'
with 'Desktop'? For me that is my favourite one (and the derived cards and
tshirts) but the Quantum part is obsolete. We coould then replace Desktop
with Server, Mobile etc as the subbrand demands...

I would also welcome #50 without "uantum".

I am not in favour of #338 or #336 because those are too complex for
logo. And then, there seems to be 3 hands on it, right? I understand
that the green one is Wassermann's hand [1][2] but I wonder whose is
the blue and brown?

Message-ID: <1367335278381-5050474.post@n6.nabble.com>

I was looking at the different plugin available today and they are 215
different ones, the Plugin Installer gives some useful information but would
it be possible to link to the webpage of the plugin (when available) where
the tools can be described and reviewed before installing. 

What I would expect is to click the desired plugin then right click and show
a help file with the functions, the icon or where the menu should show (yes
it takes me a lot of time to see what icon/menu the tool is when I have
never used it), tutorials, etc. I suggest the specific plugin webpage as
this would be the easier way using a hyperlink

This would help people learn about the plugin before installing it, because
sometimes the description is not enough

Hi Matthias,
much better indeed. A few notes:
* the fixed size of the pies is greyed out, and I donot see how to change it
* the option for dimensions are not remembered when closing the window
* the default dimension for pies (100) appears too large in most cases
* wouoldn't it be better to autofill the Max Value field for size scaling?
*
* if I do not select a fixed size (which, for histograms, does not make much sense),
I get:
- ---
You did not specify a maximum value for the diagram size. Please specify the
attribute and a reference value as a base for scaling in the Tab Diagram / Size.
- ---
which should refer to pies only, I guess.
* in general, I cannot display a reasonable size of histogram, so it must not be too
intuitive, I guess.
Thanks.

It apparently is! Would like to see also some sort of rating for plugins,
like most downloaded (which probably could mean its the one users, at least
beginners think would be the most useful). Just a suggestion not that it
should be like that

Of that group, I'd plumb for 338. (I'd probably prefer the Q form used in 280 though) This is clearly a Q. Many of the rest (e.g. 336 and 50) look more like deformed circles.
I found I needed the hands in 280 pointed out to me, and I think they'd be lost at a smaller size, but that the hands in 338 and 336 are much more obvious.

After that I'd probably end up with 334 or something similar.

I still really don't like 50, and would favour any of the others except 200 over it.
 I suppose I could live with 50 so long as no one *ever* drew it in brown.

-ramon.

This should really be a separate thread, as it needs some real discussion
focus. The sample you show is from a program of conceptually different
functionality (a code editor?). I will try to outline the way I approach
this with regards to GUI decisions for QGIS: based upon the temporal access
need of an object's properties

* Code editors*
These are programs that offer a solution to a fairly linear workflow with
limited objects.

Objects: app, project, document, code
Workflow: app options, project options, write code, test code

The most temporal object is obviously the code. After that, you may
occasionally need to adjust project object options. Whereas, the app
options are probably accessed infrequently. In other words, grouping
together many options works because access to them is generally infrequent
once the editor is set up.

* QGIS *

Objects: app, project, data source, layer, feature, composer, composer item
Workflow: app options, project options, data source options, layer options,
(then, many different directions)

Because much of visualizing GIS data requires editing options, those
options associated with objects of differing temporal access need to be
visually isolated to increase functional day-to-day focus and remove
unnecessary clutter. Ideally objects of differing temporal access should
not be grouped or shown together, except where such context shows a
relationship. For example, objects of a highly temporal nature, e.g.
symbology, labels, composer items, can be shown within or associated with
their parent object (and currently are).

Since workflows in QGIS are so numerous, a more modular, rather than
always-grouped approach is better. For example, while doing a lot of
labeling, I prefer to just open the labeling dialog and not the vector
layer properties (which has the labeling dialog also embedded), to reduce
visual distraction and focus on the task. I would dislike being forced to
always wade through a layer dialog's tree just to do labeling, and hate it
if the layer dialog was also inside an even larger tree structure.

Similarly, there are some options dialogs that can be grouped but are also
best to have the ability to be separate, e.g. snapping options. This should
be in Project properties, but also available in separate dialog/dock,
because of its higher temporal access needs during feature editing.


Concerning the labeling dialog specifically, as labeling becomes more
complex, i.e. rule-based, it approaches the same gui functionality needs as
symbology. Graphically moving in that direction for 2.0 allows users to
become accustomed to such a gui. In other words, eventually much of editing
labels will resemble the workflow and dialogs of editing rule-based
symbology. In this regard, a tree view within the labeling dialog makes
sense, though embedding it within a tree view for the vector layer does
not, since the labeling tree will become an editable 'stack' like the one
in symbology.

Following this logic, I would like to see the symbology dialog more modular
and directly accessible like the one for labeling, as its access is just as
highly temporal.

Regards,

Larry

Hmmm. I had never heard of Wassermann's hand, so that's just a coincidence.
The hands represent dev's and user's hands, all working on the project
together, but from different parts of the world and from different
disciplines, which are represented by three elemental colors: brown
(geology, landscaping, city planning, etc.), green (biology, forestry,
etc.), blue (hydrology, oceanography, etc.).

Nathan

Thanks for pointer, I hadn't seen that, and certainly it is a similar thing in terms of implementation (ie when the filter is applied as features are extracted).

There would still be the question of where and how the request is presented to the user (ie what sort of request is available, though of course an expression based filter is always an option), and how it is defined with the layer and persisted into the project.   Also the subset has its own feature count and extents, so that may not sit will with a feature request implementation.

Hi All

As we are looking at API tidy ups (I understand), would there be any support for providing a bit more granularity in supportsSubsetString.  At the moment this is a simple boolean, and the GUI offers a SQL based subset string builder.

However not all providers naturally use SQL based strings.  I'm interested in adding subset capability to the delimited text provider, whichi I've done using QgsExpression as the basis for subsets.  This works very well except that the GUI isn't an expression builder.  I think there may be similar issues with the WFS provider.

What I am proposing is something more like an enum QgsDataProvider::SubsetStringType, which could then be interrogated by the properties dialog to select the appropriate query builder dialog.

Logically this would supplant the supportsSubsetString boolean which could be deprecated, replaced with

virtual QgsDataProvider::SubsetStringType QgsDataProvider::subsetStringType(){ return NoSubsetString; }

Other types could be SqlSubsetString, ExpressionSubsetString, ...?

Thoughts anyone?

Thanks

I think #280 wihtout the hand, but with some shade on the colors instead, would be nice and simple.
Otherwise I would go for the #50 without "uantum"

Certainly the functionality could be placed in QgsVectorDataProvider.
It may need some care in the relationshiop between this an the actual provider,
In terms of managing recalculating extents, feature count, etc.  But would be nice
to have this available in all providers and not have the user wondering why
sometimes they can't select subsets.  (And as I just discovered, also wondering
why they can't use a table in a join, which also requires subset string capability).

I guess having multiple substring types for a layer could be really confusing for a user
If that is what you are suggesting.  On the other hand if you could manage abstracting
Into QgsExpression, that could be very cool.  Doesn't sound easy though!

Also from a UI point of view, the QgsExpression builder dialog isn't quite right for
a QgsExpression based subset, as it is about calculating values, not implementing a
filter.

+1 to Tim idea

QGIS Desktop
QGIS Server
QGIS Mobile Android
QGIS Mobile Ubuntu

I think the next QGIS hit will QGIS mobile Ubuntu since Ubuntu Mobile
(phone and tablet) support Qt and Qt Quick / QML.

New logos withdrawn.

My 2 cents:

I feel like design #50 is overly generic. Simply logos are good, but
wondering whether this one went on the road of simplification to the
extreme, leaving a logo with a *slight* gap in meaningfulness. There could
be ways to remedy to that while keeping overall design intact. Maybe by
having some sort of faux-3d on the green triangle using gradients to make
it more like an arrow.

#338 has much more identify, both hinting at GIS and cooperativeness of
open source project. The color palette could be improved (maybe dark gray
or black for text, and a tango color scheme based colors for hands?), as
well as making GIS a bit smaller, moving up, and allow space for 'desktop,
android, etc.'.

Neat, a logo with a nice story :)

Nathan, how is the final selection going to work?
Can we narrow the choice down first where there are a number of very similar versions by grouping them together as one (e.g. 338/336/340/335 or 2/388/393/334/333/332/331)?

Hi Larry,

Thanks a lot for this clear explanations.

I understand you want to open the labelling in a separate dialog.
My idea was to provide the way of nesting left panels: if you have a 
widget with a left panel which goes in another one with a left panel, 
then it is nested. But you still have the possibility of showing the 
dialog on its own.

Besides, if the labelling is moving toward a tree widget, then 
effectively it makes no sense.

Thanks again for the clarification,

Denis

My vote would go for #336, which I think has a better balance than #338.
I'd prefer to see it in a darker grey or black though, and maybe try
different fonts for the GIS part.

Rudi

Alister,

I will run a poll at the end.

Not saying we should pick Larry's because of this, although I do like it,
but we have the added advantage with Larry to refine it more after the comp
is up.
