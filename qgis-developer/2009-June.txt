Subject: [Qgis-developer] New snapshot of OpenStreetMap plugin
Message-ID: <e8e7199c0906010559y511552can8cba0ecfaa26908a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

for those interested in the QGIS-OSM integration, there's a good news:
today the qgis-mapper team is releasing a new snapshot for public
testing.

Features:
- download OSM data
- load and display .osm files
- identify nodes, ways and relations
- edit data: create, modify, delete objects
- upload changes to OSM server
- automatic pre-defined styles for OSM data

How does it look like:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/qgis-openstreetmap.png
(showing OSM data in center of Prague)

Currently there is virtually no documentation available for usage of
the plugin. This will be fixed in the following weeks.

We welcome any comments, suggestions or bug reports from you!

Hopefully at some point of time in future this work will be integrated
into QGIS codebase. Currently it's necessary to install provider
separately.

== Installation ==

Requirements: you need QGIS sources, at least v1.0.0, preferably SVN trunk.

1. download OSM provider:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/osm_provider-snapshot-090601.tar.gz

2. unpack to source into src/providers/

3. modify src/providers/CMakeLists.txt - add "osm" to the list of subdirectories

4. recompile and install qgis

5. using plugin installer, fetch the "OpenStreetMap plugin" from my repository:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/plugins-sandbox.xml

6. restart qgis and you're ready for street mapping!

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugin: SDA4PP (Spatial Data Analysis for
	Point Pattern)
Message-ID: <8b5938320906011215k41a75ee0qf701b1ba9a623ec4@mail.gmail.com>

 *Dear to all,
*

The plugin performs analysis on point pattern spatial data. It uses spatial
analytical structure of R. The plugin communicates with R through RPy2.

*The repo and docs are here:*

http://ggit.metu.edu.tr/~volkan/plugins.xml<http://ggit.metu.edu.tr/%7Evolkan/plugins.xml>

*Used components' version:*

QGIS 1.0.2 / 1.1.0

Python 2.5.2

RPy2 2.0.3

R 2.9.0

NumPy 1.2.1

R packages: (spatstat_1.15-2, maptools_0.7-22, rgdal_0.6-7)

 *Following tools are available in the plugin:*

*Interactive Identify Tool:* returns the value of overlapping raster and
vector layers in one window. It gives more information about feature than
the standard identify tool in QGIS. This tool is also available in the repo
as separate plugin.

*Quadrat analysis:* A method of point pattern analysis in which the study
region is sampled using a set of similar shapes (quadrats) and counting the
number of events in each. Analysis of the resulting quadrat counts can help
determine whether the pattern is evenly spaced or clustered.

*F function:* A function in point pattern analysis based on the cumulative
frequency of the shortest distance between events in a point pattern and a
set of randomly placed locations in the study area.

*G function:* A function in point pattern analysis based on the cumulative
frequency of the shortest inter- event distances between events in a point
pattern.

*K function:* A function in point pattern analysis based on all the
inter-event distances between events in a point pattern.

*Kernel density estimation:* A method of density estimation making use of
kernel functions. For each event to be included in the density estimates a
kernel function is used to 'spread' its effect across space.

*Tested OS:*

XP professional Service Pack 3

XP professional 64 bit edition service pack 2 (qgis should be installed
under C:\Program Files, but not in C:\Program Files (x86). this is required
for this plugin, may not be for others.)

Ubuntu Desktop 8.10 intrepid ibex (R 2.7)


 Please send bugs, opinions and suggestions;

Message-ID: <26777.193.246.86.39.1243942831.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi all,

There seems to be a bug in the Attribute Table when editing Postgis data
sources.

The funny thing is that I can only reproduce the bug for some tables, not
for all.

When I edit a table cell, the value disappears and appears in the column
to the left of the cell I was editing. The orginal cell reverts back to
its original value. It seems that in some cases the index of the table is
not correct (off one entry).

Here is one of the table definitions where editing in QGIS fails:

===========
-- Table: hydrologie.gewaesserachsen

-- DROP TABLE hydrologie.gewaesserachsen;

CREATE TABLE hydrologie.gewaesserachsen
(
  gid serial NOT NULL,
  the_geom geometry,
  autocad_entity_handle character varying(50),
  gewaessertyp_code smallint,
  bfs smallint,
  rid integer,
  gemeinde_gewaesser_nr character varying(10),
  CONSTRAINT pkey_hydrologie_gewaesserachsen_gid PRIMARY KEY (gid),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_dims_the_geom CHECK (ndims(the_geom) = 2),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_srid_the_geom CHECK (srid(the_geom) = 21781)
)
WITH (OIDS=FALSE);
ALTER TABLE hydrologie.gewaesserachsen OWNER TO an;
==================

I don't yet know why the bug only appears with some tables and not with
others.

Have other people come across the same problem?

Thanks,
Andreas

Does that only happen for columns that are located after the geometry column?
Most tables probably have the geometry as last column as the attributes are
created first in CREATE TABLE and the geometry column later with
AddGeometryColumn() on the existing table.

yes - this seems to be the case. The geometry column is the problem. It
works fine for tables where the geometry column is at the end but fails
for tables where the geometry_column is at the beginning.

Should I file a bug on this?

I consider this a major bug that should also be backported to the 1.1
release. I think this wasn't a problem in the 1.0 release, since this had
a different table implementation - am I right?

Thanks for your help,
Andreas

No, should be fixed in r10875.

We only backport fixes to 1.0, but that's not necessary here as the 1.0
implementation doesn't have that problem - as you already noted.

Hi J?rgen,

I can confirm that it works fine now!

Thank you very much - this was a really quick fix!!

Hello-

I am trying to write a small script/proof of concept that I can eventually
turn into a QGIS plug-in that utilizes the CGAL python bindings to generate
a Delaunay triangulation polygon shapefile from a point shapefile.  The
problem that I am having is that the CGAL bindings seem to work only with
python2.6 and the QGIS bindings seem to only work with python2.5.

Does anyone have any suggestions for handling this situation?  Can the QGIS
bindings be made to work with python2.6?  Also, if I can get this to work
using python2.6 is there a way to make a QGIS plugin use version 2.6?

I have tried to get CGAL to work in python2.5 but havn't had any luck, the
import statements seem to work but some of the functions don't.

Thanks,

Matt

The ubuntu jaunty packages are build against python 2.6. I didn't hear about
any problems with that yet, so I suppose there is no problem with qgis and
python 2.6.

Thank you for your input.

Maybe I have another problem then.  If I open the Terminal and type:

python2.6
>>> import qgis.core

I get:

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named qgis.core

However, if I do the same with python2.5 it works fine, and I can go
on to write a shapefile, etc.

Any idea what would cause this?  I am using Ubuntu Jaunty.

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Jurgen,

I am using python-qgis 1.0.1-1~jaunty1 from deb
http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

I will try the version and repository you suggest and see what happens.

Thanks for your help.

ogrinfo -so -al gives:

Extent: (437.000000, 51131.000000) - (44137.000000, 511549.000000)
Layer SRS WKT:
(unknown)
Name: String (0.0)

What I am looking for is access to the name 'GEM'.

Via python I notice that 'subLayers()' are empty:

 >>> l = iface.mapCanvas().layer(0)
 >>> l.subLayers()
<PyQt4.QtCore.QStringList object at 0x13101618>
 >>> l.subLayers()[0]
exceptions.IndexError: sequence index out of range

While the provider subLayers have the name embedded in an odd Qstring:
 >>> l.dataProvider().subLayers()[0]
0:GEM:0:Unknown

Is parsing this string they best way to get at this information? What  
happens in QGIS when there are multiple layers?

Running this on a shapefile and a GeoJSON file I get this:

 >>> l.dataProvider().subLayers()[0]
0:statesp020:2895:Polygon

http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/ogr/data/multipolygon.geojson
 >>> l.dataProvider().subLayers()[0]
0:OGRGeoJSON:1:Unknown WKB: 6

Can anyone explain what those numbers mean - Number of features?

Thanks,

Dane

Hi Dane:

Sublayers returns a QStringList with one string per layer, the string has four components separated by a ":", the components are:

LayerIndex : LayerName : FeatureCount : GeometryType

 spqr uses rpy version 1, and I think Vulkan's spatial stats plugin
uses rpy-2, so it'll all be horribly incompatible in all sorts of
nasty ways.

 You'll have to disable spqr until someone rewrites it to use rpy-2.
Not something I have time for.

I imagined, and I confirm: Vulkan plugin uses rpy2.

Too bad.

Hi,

yes, it is true. sda4pp plugin uses rpy2 (2.0.3)

very interesting error. I have never seen before.

if i have time, will i upgrade the spqr to use rpy2, if Bary do not mind?

 It's released under the GPL, so I don't have any say in the matter
even if I did mind :)

 But the problem is that we need to keep rpy-1 and rpy-2 versions
going, since rpy-2 isn't that mainstream yet (by which I mean "isn't
in the ubuntu repositories" :) ).

 So I'm not sure what the best solution for developing and deploying a
rpy-2 compatible version of spqr would be. Currently I'm thinking I
need to create a new plugin, lets's say called spqr2, in my bsrplugins
repository, and give you (Volkan) commit access (which probably means
you get commit access to all the bsrplugins, but that's okay), and
then I just add spqr2 to my qgis repository for deployment. The info
for spqr2 will make it clear that it is rpy-2 compatible.

 We could just create a new SVN branch for it, but currently my code
for building the repository from SVN doesn't handle that - it only
exports 'trunk' (I think). In effect creating a new plugin is like a
new branch anyway, since all the bsrplugins sit in the same SVN space.

which one is more appropriate?

a new plugin (like spqr2) OR spqr plugin will have both rpy and rpy2 feature


both of them fits me but i never used svn.

Hi David

It is possible to add/remove entries in the WMS connection list from plugins by using QSettings. Have a look at qgsserversourceselect.cpp/h and qgsnewhttpconnection.cpp/h to see how it is done.

However, it is not possible to pop up the WMS dialog from plugin, because QgsServerSourceSelect / QgsNewHttpConnection are in the app module and not exposed to plugins. So the sound solution would be to move qgsserversourceselect.cpp/h and qgsnewhttpconnection.cpp/h from the app to the gui module. 

The quick and dirty solution would be that you copy those two classes to your plugin (but that only works for C++ plugins, e.g. is done for WFS with qgsnewhttpconnection).

Are there any objections if we move QgsServerSourceSelect / QgsNewHttpConnection to gui? 
QgsNewHttpConnection is also used by WFS (and my OGC SOS plugin in progress), so I have no doubts about this class. QgsServerSourceSelect might still be usefull for third party apps.

And of course we are interested to hear about progresses with the CSW plugin :-)

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-user] Calling WMS 'Plugin' from a CSW plugin...
 
Hey Folks,

I am working on a plugin that wants to take the result and pass it to
other plugins.

One plugin is the WMS tool... OK it may no longer be a plugin but that
is how I am considering it.

I am playing with the OGC CSW spec to make a CSW client for inside
QGIS...

What I want to do is this. From a python plugin I want to

1. Create a new WMS server connection by passing a name and url combo to
the WMS tool
2. have the dialog pop up with the new server connection populated and
layers displayed.

That way all the user needs to do is choose the layers they wish to add
and then click ADD.

This is in the hopes the CSW client can exploit other service specific
tools/plugins.

Any thoughts?

P.S I assume this is a user question and not a developer question as
this is dealing with scripts and not QGIS core.

Cheers

Message-ID: <20090603152820.GB14684@rigacci.org>

I'm pleased to announce a new build for QGIS 1.1 on Debian Lenny.
This involved the backport of some packages from Debian Squeeze
(Testing).

QGIS 1.1 includes the new spatialite provider.

I also included the new experimental OpenStreetMap provider,
announced by Martin Dobias some days ago [1].

The apt-gettable repository is http://debian.gfoss.it/

Packages version:

  * proj 4.6.1
  * geos 3.1.0
  * gdal 1.5.4
  * grass 6.4.0~rc4
  * libgdal-grass 1.5.4
  * spatialite 2.3.0
  * qgis 1.1.0

Message-ID: <e579e76c0906031024s423ebcp3d97fae73daec8cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I wrote a new GeoCoding python plugin that uses Google webservices, this
plugin is completely independent from the existing geocoding plugin written
by perrygeo (no shared code).

The plugin supports geocoding and reverse geocoding.

The plugin has an external dependency on geopy so I decided to include it in
the zip.
geopy has a dependency on simplejson (which has some C code, so I did'nt
include it in the zip).

I tested it locally but Paolo Cavallini reported a problem (which I wasn't
able to reproduce) with geopy dependency.

I would really appreciate you comments, impressions and  any help in fixing
the a.m. issue if you experience it.

The plugin is available at this repo:

http://elpaso.homelinux.org/qgis/plugins.xml

Thank you in advance!

Works for me on Ubuntu 8.10.


I had to install manually simplejson and this version

http://code.google.com/p/geopy/wiki/ReverseGeocoding

of geopy.


Thanks a lot!

it is a bug now. the reason is converting from sp classes to ppp format of
spatstat library in R, at least one numeric column is required. if there is
no numeric column in point layer, then id column of point layer can be used.
i will try to fix it.

it will be good to reach this repo more easily for users who deal with
spatial statistics.

Hi Borys,

That is an excellent plugin, but I found an error and fixed for xp. The
error occurs when insert a new field and click the save button in win xp.

i actually do not know how to prepare a python patch in pythonic way, but i
marked my changed code between the commented blocks like  "BEGIN SECTION"

you can find more explanation in the code.

could you look at my suggestion and if it is ok for you, could you let me
know when the plugin is revised in your repo?

i want to test your plugin.

regards,
volkan.

I could not find any function to reach "id" colon of layer. the value of id
colon for each row can be reachable like feature.id(). I want to reach as a
colon. maybe the id as a colon can be unreachable with the python code or i
could not find. do you have any suggestion for this? so i think this option
does not solve the problem. Another solution can be to add a new integer
field, populate this field with numbers and save the file and then sent to
the R. Actually there is another plugin, Borys' Table manager does the same
thing; insert the field and save. Hacking some part of the table manager
code into sda4pp will be a long story. i wll do later. i think these are
note to myself.

thanks for your valuable input and awaring of difficult bug. :-)

 ouch ouch ouch!

 If you need to do file path manipulation in python then it's
generally better to use functions from the os.path module - it handles
OS-specific things like / and \, splitting dir/filename from paths,
creating canonical paths, resolving symlinks (if your OS supports it)
and all that.

 Note that os.path tends to fail if you feed it QStrings, so convert
to python strings beforehand, or maybe use methods from QDir -
actually, that's probably a better idea! QDir has methods for these
sort of things too. Concatenating strings for files, especially adding
slashes or backslashes, can get painful when you go across platforms.

this patch is only for to fix the error, not to refactor the code.

i tried to change the code as minimum as possible.

os.path.join(Path, Filename) is more appropriate, but if the code is working
without using proper built-in function,

that is also fine for me.

Hi all.
I think setting up a proper infrastructure to upload the plugins to a
common repo is becoming more and more important.
Any plans to do this?

Hi

I am under ubuntu 9.04, Qgis 1.0.1
I have installed geopy, using this

svn checkout http://geopy.googlecode.com/svn/branches/reverse-geocode geopy
cd geopy/
sudo python setup.py install


I worked, see:
Installed /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/geopy-0.93dev_r84-py2.6.egg
Processing dependencies for geopy==0.93dev-r84
Finished processing dependencies for geopy==0.93dev-r84

But the plugin stills complains about geopy missing. I have not installed it
with easy_install, because I do not know what it is (and installing the
package python-virtualenv did not help :(  )

Any hints ?

Thanks in advance

kimaidou

Your installation procedure is correct.

To test if geopy is installed correctly, you could try to

import geopy

from a python console.

Sorry I was unclear.
Well, if plugin developers ask to add their repo to standard ones rather
than adding their plugin to the official repo (globally the most
efficient choice), I think we have a problem. I am worried about much
work being underutilized or wasted, having very useful plugins not
effectively available to most users (and probably also to some
developers). This issue can increase dramatically over time, as QGIS is
getting more and more widespread.
What could be done? My opinions
1. advertize more the possibility to upload plugins to the standard repo
(e.g. Volkan, were you aware of this?)
2. integrate the repo into qgis (e.g. adding the possibility of
uploading plugins straight from the app)
3. integrate the repo with the main qgis web site
4. add an "experimental/sandbox" repo, to encourage devs to submit their
plugins as early as possible, and promote cooperation
5. add the usual popularity and rating stuff, that would also encourage
sharing and spreading plugin use.
We can help if useful.
All the best.

Hi all

Probably we just need a group (or a person) that volunteers to review plugins for the official repository.
Plugins can only be used widely if they are in the approved repository (http://pyqgis.org/repo/official). Otherwise the user cannot be sure the plugin does not do any bad things on the local computer. 

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0906060812p12586bakd72713b97c168bb1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just added a new "node" tool for more rapid vector editing to svn
trunk (r10890). It has been developed as a part of qgis-mapper
project.

It resembles a tool for editing paths by nodes that is present in
every vector editor. How does it work (in QGIS):
- click on a feature, its nodes will be marked by small rectangles
- clicking and dragging a node moves it
- double clicking a segment will add a new node
- pressing delete key will remove active node
- it's possible to select more active nodes at once: by clicking and
dragging a rectangle
- it's possible to select segment's adjacent nodes by clicking on the segment
- it's possible to add/remove active nodes by using Ctrl when clicking
a node or dragging a rectangle

I recommend everyone to turn off vertex markers in options when
working with this tool: the redraws are much faster and the map is not
cluttered with markers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend File Group drag bug in Ubuntu 9.04
Message-ID: <e32d76a10906060906n5b855337u57ff85fe4d4ec252@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

QGis crashes when I drag an item from a file group just one position above
the file group. It happens in the release event. The drag is not allowed to
another position.

I'm using QGis 1.1 in Ubuntu 9.04.

And just a question:
I'm reading the code in svn because I want to implement the legend in a
standalone application. The file group items that I see in the QGis legend
are the legend items which type is LEGEND_LAYER_FILE in the code? I want to
avoid this items in my app.

Thanks in advance.

Germ?n

Hi list,

since the last svn update I always get the follwing error while compiling.
Can anyone help me with that? Didn't changed anything on my environment.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Martin  
  
Thank you for these very nice tools. I made some
tests and I found out that the tools doesn't take respect on the
topological editing option defined under Project

Am I right?

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Node tool 
 
Hi all, 
 
I've just added a new "node" tool for more rapid vector editing to svn 
trunk (r10890). It has been developed as a part of qgis-mapper 
project. 
 
It resembles a tool for editing paths by nodes that is present in 
every vector editor. How does it work (in QGIS): 
- click on a feature, its nodes will be marked by small rectangles 
- clicking and dragging a node moves it 
- double clicking a segment will add a new node 
- pressing delete key will remove active node 
- it's possible to select more active nodes at once: by clicking and 
dragging a rectangle 
- it's possible to select segment's adjacent nodes by clicking on the segment 
- it's possible to add/remove active nodes by using Ctrl when clicking 
a node or dragging a rectangle 
 
I recommend everyone to turn off vertex markers in options when 
working with this tool: the redraws are much faster and the map is not 
cluttered with markers. 
 
Please give it a try and as always we'll be happy to hear some feedback :-) 
 
Martin

Message-ID: <1966208837.25541244445331930.JavaMail.root@srsofaioi13477.ktso.ch>

I found a bug, which leeds to crash QGIS when using the merge tool under special circumstances. 
 
1. open a polygon layer 
2. toggle editing 
3. select 2 adjacent polgons 
4. activate "node tool"  
5. double click the common border of the two polygons => red squares arises 
6. select tool "merge selected features" and merge the two polygons => although the common border was removed, the red squares are still there 
7. click on a red square => QGIS crashes 
 
The new option "do not show vertex marker" is very nice, but when you have loaded many layers, you do not see or know if one or more layers are toggled in editing mode. In minimum the editing layers should be marked as "in editing mode" in the layer list. In former versions, until 0.8 I believe, the layer in editing mode were marked with a hashed box around the layer name.

You're right, topological editing isn't taken into account. To be fixed...

I'll pass this bug report to our "node tool" guy Richard.

Yes, I remember that functionality :-) There were overlay icons for
"in overview" and "editable" states of a layer. From a brief look at
the code, I've figured out that the code for it still exists
(QgsLegendLayer::updateIcon), however some plumbing that would trigger
the update is missing.

In Windows XP with the OSGeo4W QGis 1.1 version, I get a message box:

   Access violation - no RTTI data!

QGis crashes if I want to check/uncheck the file group item.

Pta: I did resolve my question and I'm able to avoid the legend file group
items in my app.

Hi.
I'm working with the legend and when I drag an item layer on any symbology
item the cursor turns to forbidden, but after that, if I move the cursor
(with an item layer to drag) on other item layers I'm still getting the
forbidden cursor, instead of the SizeVer one. It would seems I couldn't move
the item layer but when I release the mouse the canvas reflects the new
layers order.

I think it could be improved and I could do it, but it seems a bit add in
the code and I don't know if you can do it instead. Please tell me to change
it or to wait.

Thanks in advance.

Germ?n.

why is not possible to merge non adjacent or non overlapping features?

Hi Giovanni

It is possible to merge non adjacent features, but only if the layer type is multipoint/multiline/multipolygon.

The reason is that most datasources don't allow to insert e.g. multipolygons into a polygon layer (e.g. PostGIS).

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] snapping for move vertex feature
Message-ID: <20090609173431.0bcfb412@nature>

Hi,

I am just trying to move some vertices of a simple vector box with 4 corners and
i'm finding it really hard to pick up the vertices and move them. 

In Settings -> Project Properties -> General I set the Map Units to meters
according to my CRS and also adapted the snapping options for the layer to
vertex, 10000 meters and map units. But even with this high value it doesn't
seem to work. 

I have the impression that a defined snapping is not used for the move vertex
feature. When I use the digitizing tools capture point, line, and polygon
snapping works as expected.

Is this correct and if yes, is there a reason for this behavior or is it just a
missing feature?

kind regards,
 Otto

Hi Otto,

when clicking the vertices, there's a different tolerance - search
radius for vertex edits. It's independent from the snapping tolerance.
You can set it in options dialog, digitizing tab.

Message-ID: <1244572543.402.3.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,
I noticed that when editing a vector point layer on qgis 1.2 (Ubuntu
9.04) the symbols do not change nor the layer is marked differently in
the legend, so it can be difficult to recognize if a layer is being
edited or not. I can't recall if i previous versions it worked
differently.

thanks in advance

Starting from r10895 there's a different icon in layer list to
indicate that a layer is editable.

Hope that helps!

Unfortunately currently it's not possible to interact with legend
widget (it's not part of the qgis libraries), so if you do any changes
to layer set in map canvas, they won't get propagated into legend.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] grass modules  and grass 6.4rc4
Message-ID: <200906101724.32744.lorenxo86@gmail.com>

Hi list!
There are some grass modules that don't work (Cannot find key ...).
The reason is that .qgm module definitions differ from the grass options, for 
example:

v.buffer.qgm:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE qgisgrassmodule SYSTEM "http://mrcc.com/qgisgrassmodule.dtd">

<qgisgrassmodule label="Vector buffer" module="v.buffer">
        <option key="input" typeoption="type" layeroption="layer" />
        <option key="buffer"/>
        <option key="output" />
</qgisgrassmodule>

v.buffer --help:
Usage:
 v.buffer [-sc] input=name output=name [type=string[,string,...]]
   [layer=value] [distance=value] [minordistance=value] [angle=value]
   [bufcolumn=name] [scale=value] [tolerance=value] [--overwrite]
   [--verbose] [--quiet]

You can see the xml definition too, with v.buffer --interface-definition.

So the problem is that the option "buffer" doesn't exists anymore, now is 
distance.

Here the list of the modules affected:

r.surf.fractal  (Cannot found Key d)
v.buffer (Cannot found Key buffer)
v.to.db (Cannot found Key column)
v.dv.select (Cannot found Key column)
v.db.select.where (Cannot found Key column)

I'm using  grass-6.4rc4.
How to procede to mantain the backward compatibility?

regards
Lorenzo

Hello!

i try both of your plugin with the same configuration (Windows XP and
QGis1.0.2) bu i'm not able to make it works....

With "Image Boundary", i can select a type of file, a path but nothing
else....  buttons remain grey...
With "Image show or hide" i get an error message: Do not have valid Path
Field. See first feature

Where can i get technical documentation or at least some specifications
(path syntax, name of the compulsory fields, raster type supported...)?

Best regards,

Guillaume

I see two approaches here:
- changing the makefile, so that differnet modules are used when
compiled with different grass versions
- blacklisting some modules, so that they are not loaded at runtime when
a specific grass version is present
To me the first approach seems mor efficient, but others are much more
authoritative than me.
All the best.

Hi all,

I'm working to upload the modules for GRASS-6.4.

I think that changing the makefile, so that differnet modules are used 
when compiled with different grass versions, is a good idea.

So I can wait to upload the modules on the trunk if developers think 
that it can be a solution.

Regards
Leonardo

Please go on uploading, we'll work on the makefile soon afterwards.
Also, please be careful about following the syntax and style rules for
names and descriptions of the modules (see the current ones, and the
many small corrections I made to obtain a coherent interface).
All the best.

Message-ID: <48d9b78e0906110341o38e157e4vf604a5e69286142c@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to develop a "proof of concept" apps that read some points
position (lat,lon) from a DB and plot it over a map (vector or raster or
something other) at 1 time per second rate.

To do that I make a QGIS python plugin that add a Point Vector Layer to the
mapcanvas,
add a Feature (1 point) using the following code:

    vl = QgsVectorLayer("Point", "provaLayer", "memory")

#Create Layer
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vl)
    pr = vl.dataProvider()

# add a feature
    x=12.108
    y=42.066
    point = QgsPoint()
    point.setX(x)
    point.setY(y)
    geom = QgsGeometry()

    fet = QgsFeature()
    fet.setGeometry(geom.fromPoint(point))
    pr.addFeatures( [ fet ] )
    vl.updateExtents()

It works.

After that I want to wait 1 second (for example) and replot the same Feature
on an update coordinate (x1,y1)= (x,y+something).

I have tried vl.changeGeometry(.....) but don't works. Any suggestions ?


Moreover I need that only the Point Vector Layer being refreshed and not
also the underlying map. Otherway while refresh has done I'll see a white
screen without any map.



Please Help me...

Message-ID: <e32d76a10906110723v4b8df551m2f69ec11dc790931@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I'm using PyQGIS. I have three classes in my app: Viewer, Legend and Load.
The Viewer class is the main one, the Load class add some data to canvas.
The Legend class has a SLOT to capture the layerWasAdded SIGNAL from the
QgsMapLayerRegistry class and when it happens add an item in a QTreeWidget.

The Legend class can remove layers. So, I have a problem with the SIGNAL
layerWasAdded. When I remove a layer I get multiple lines like this:

  Object::disconnect: Unexpected null parameter

After that, if I add the same layer again I get a segmentation fault that
crashes my app.

This happen even if I use a custom SIGNAL passing the layer object as
parameter from my Load class.

I'm working in Ubuntu 9.04 with latest versions of every package I need.

If I run my app in Windows XP I get the line ( Object::disconnect:
Unexpected null parameter ) multiple times, the app doesn't crashes but
every time it needs more time to load the layer.

I don't know what's the problem, because if I don't use the SIGNAL-SLOT
mechanism with that object (layer) my app works fine.
But I want to have components (and a real PyQt4 application), not a lot of
function calls across the classes.

Hope you can help me with this issue.

Thanks in advance.

 Germ?n.

Ok, I will uploading them.
I'm going to follow the new syntax, name and description used before are 
the description of the GRASS modules windows, I used them to make more 
easy the recognition.

Hi all.
Have you made good progresses on the GDAL/OGR plugin? I think, given the
recently discovered bugs in the current OGR converter plugin[0]
and the lengthy TODO list[1], I think it would be very good to rewrite
it in python, adding several functionalities (including the raster
catalogues via the virtual rasters[2]).
All the best.

Hi all.
For testing the system, I tried uploading an interesting plugin I
found[0] on pyqgis.org (I did not find a way to contact the author - I
hope he does not mind). Unfortunately I discovered that the plugin is
incompatible; I hope someone will be able to fix it for recent versions.
Also another plugin from the same author looks interesting:
http://kubuntu.free.fr/wiki/?page=QGisTrackGps
I encourage all plugin devs to upload their plugin on the repo, so
nothing will be lost, and it will be much easier to find and being found.
All the best, and many thanks.

When you are going to upload the grass64-compatible modules, remember to move 
the old ones in src/plugins/grass/modules-old.
The modules in modules-old will be installed only if the version of grass is < 
6.4.

Hi:

 

I'm my case I changed from python to c++  because a problem with callback functions. I'm already working 

in raster exporter plugin. The plugin will have the following functionality:

 

Translate from any supported raster format to any gdal driver with write support.

Batch translation of multiple raster files to a target raster format.

Full support for driver creation options via xml configuration file.

 

I already developed the classes to deal with creation options and I think they can be used with ogr converter plugin

to solve the following todos in ogr converter:

 

 // TODO: Add support for creation options

 // TODO: Append and createion options not implemented

 // TODO: Append option not supported

 

The classes are ready but the plugin needs more work.

 

Also I was checking the create new vector layer dialog, to improve it, add reestructure functionality, support for all ogr vector formats, and selection of projection. Unfortunately I found that there are not support in ogr to deletefield, checking 

in the mailing list I found that some other qgis developers have made a request for such functionality in ogr without success, 

do you think the qgis team can push a rfc in gdal/ogr to add this functionality?

 

Regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Default postgis layername format
Message-ID: <20090612111807.GT70353@keybit.net>

Just so it doesn't get lost, I'd like to suggest an improvement
to the default naming convention for layers loaded from postgis
columns.

My use case is: have XMLTester (from GEOS) produce an SQL file
containing informations about a testcase run, load the SQL 
in postgis, have qgis show me what happened.
The XMLTester produced SQL creates a single table, with columns
for the input(s), the expected output and the obtained output.

Current qgis only uses the table name by default, so I miss
which layer was which (expected or obtained or input ?). Thus
I always find myself manually renaming the columns.

Jef correctly pointed out that using <table>.<colum> always might
be too verbose for the "normal" use. And I can add to that
sometimes one would want even more (<db>.<schema>.<table>.<col>).
So my suggestion would be to make it a user preference, using
a format with labels substitution, like:

	DefaultPostgisLayerName %d.%s.%t.%c

With the default being just %t to match the current behaviour.

Do you like the idea ?

Hi German,

some code from your app would be helpful. How do you create instances
of the layer classes? How do you delete the layers?

That's because you would have to put the layer into editing mode. When
in editing mode it gathers all changes to internal buffer and finally
allows to do a commit (store data permanently in data provider) or do
a rollback (forget all changes). You could avoid this by calling
directly provider's changeGeometryValues() function.

For displaying data with regular updates I would suggest you to draw
the points as map canvas items: the main advantage is that the
background map doesn't have to be rendered every second, only the
points are changed.

As already written above, map canvas items is the way to go. Try
exploring the QgsVertexMarker class, it might be useful for you.

Message-ID: <e8e7199c0906140741u2146801fkd6231258eac73794@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

this is yet another announcement of the qgis-mapper team: I've just
committed undo/redo functionality for vector layers to svn trunk
(r10920 and r10921).
I hope you'll find it useful :-)
I also hope this functionality will make QGIS rock even more in vector
editing capabilities!

Every layer now has its own undo stack where the edit actions are
recorded. The stack is cleared on commit and rollback. You can trigger
undo/redo from Edit menu, from advanced digitizing toolbar and from a
newly added dock widget displaying the contents of current layer's
undo stack.

Most of the implementation has been done by Richard Kostecky.

Your comments are as always highly welcome.

Regards
Martin

Hi!

this is huge!

I want to thank you for this new addition! qgis is better and better
every day it passes.

It seems to work pretty fine. I just noticed that in point layers when
you add a point the stack isn't updated. This doesn't happens when you
move or delete a point.

thanks again

Thanks for testing! I've fixed adding new point to undo stack in r10923.

So qgis_core.lib can't be find, probably because it wasn't build before.

Anybody can help me with that?

Hi

Recent commits have broken grass compilation on ubuntu (Jaunty here
but pretty sure it breaks earlier versions too...).

CMake Error at src/plugins/grass/CMakeLists.txt:2 (SUBDIRS):
  subdirs Incorrect SUBDIRS command.  Directory: modules-6.2 does not exists.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1


Ubuntu still ships grass 6.2 and so the appropriate modules dir should exist.

Thanks

Hi Martin.

I create the layers like the PyQGIS Wiki says:

( For shapefiles)  layer = QgsVectorLayer( layerPath, layerInfo.fileName(),
layerProvider )
Where layerPath is a QFileDialog result and layerProvider is "ogr".

If the layer is valid, I call a function to add it to canvas:

  if layer.isValid():
    self.agregarCapa( layer )

  def agregarCapa( self, capa ):
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer( capa )
    self.layers.insert( 0, QgsMapCanvasLayer( capa ) )
    self.canvas.setLayerSet( self.layers )

I remove layers from the Legend class:
    for i in self.layers:
      if i.layer().getLayerID() == self.currentItem().layerId:
        self.layers.remove( i )
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(
i.layer().getLayerID() )
        self.canvas.setLayerSet( self.layers )
        break

Then I remove the QTreeWidgetItem:
        self.takeTopLevelItem( self.indexOfTopLevelItem( myItem ) )

Like in the QGIS legend, I have an item for the layer name and its geometry
type and a child item for its symbology.
The parent item (the layer item) has the attribute canvasLayer to reference
it and access its functions and attributes.

I'm using this connect line:
self.connect( QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance(),
SIGNAL("layerWasAdded(QgsMapLayer *)"), self.legend.addLayerToLegend )

The legend has another connect line to update the layer status:
  self.connect( self, SIGNAL("itemChanged(QTreeWidgetItem *,int)"),
self.updateLayerStatus )

When all it's ok, remove layer always returns two lines like this:
Object::disconnect: Unexpected null parameter


Thanks by your help.

Germ?n.

Sounds like you are missing flex and / or bison. Download the gnu win
builds of these and specify the path to them using cmakesetup.exe

Ooops! Can replicate here. Fortunately its not persistent so restarting
QGIS will bring it back (for me it does anyway).

Hi Martin


Cool features you have been adding! I noticed with the node tool that if
you undo it leaves the vertex marker boxes behind and then things get a
litte loopy because the node tool lets you drag the ghost of the line
around (the line state as it was before you pressed undo).

Regards

I think I know where's the problem: you remove the map layer and then
update layer set in canvas. When updating the layer set, the layers
which have been removed get disconnected from the slots of map canvas.
But that time your layer doesn't exist anymore and the pointer is
invalid - thus the disonnect warning or a crash.

So the solution should be to swap those two lines. Another way would
be to connect to registry's layerWillBeDeleted signal (which is
emitted in removeMapLayer() method when the layer still exists) and
update the GUI and canvas. This would be a bit cleaner solution if
there were more places in code where you remove a layer.

Thanks Martin, but I remove the layer from the layerSet before removing from
QgsMapLayerRegistry. So, when I update the layer set in canvas, the layer
doesn't exists.

Well, I thought this order would do those things:

        self.layers.remove( i )
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(
i.layer().getLayerID() )
        self.canvas.setLayerSet( self.layers )

Anyway, I did the two lines swap and get the segmentation fault again.

Martin, thanks by your advices, I finally get it.

I reorder things this way (just like QGIS do the same things):

Add Layer:

    * Viewer Class: Calls the loadShapefile method from Load Class.
    * Load Class: Add layer to QgsMapLayerRegistry.
    * Legend Class: ( SLOT to layerWasAdded SIGNAL )
                   +  Add new QTreeWidgetItem.
                   +  Update the canvas layer set. (Before, the canvas layer
set was updated on Load Class)

Remove Layer: ( Before, a for did the RemoveItem, the remove from
QgsMapLayerRegistry and the update canvas layer set )

    * Legend Class: Remove layer from QgsMapLayerRegistry.
    * Legend Class: Remove the QTreeWidgetItem.
    * Legend Class: Update the canvas layer set.

Now the app works with SIGNAL-SLOT mechanism, like it should be.

Hi All,

I am very sorry to disturb you all. Can you please help me out?

I want to call the grass functionalities in my plugin.
Like Can we call the functions (r.mapcalc, r.import, etc) from our own
plugin?
If yes, How?
I am using Python, QGIS on windows platform

Thank you in advance.

you can import grass from py (if you use grass64, of course).

First of all thank you very much for your reply.

I am not that very conversant in GRASS and QGIS. So it will be really
helpful for me, if you can elaborate your answer a bit more.
Like, Can it be imported like normal QGIS / system libraries? or we need to
do some thing more. Then after importing can we call the functions like
normal function calls?

Presently I am using Grass 6.3. I tried to import but it was giving me no
modules error.

Thank you in advance.

With Regards,
Bishwarup

Message-ID: <fced846c0906170357o1e95bfekb98c61e384ea8a1f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I started to try to use Qgis verry recently for a project I'm working on. My
first issue is to display a geographic card using Qt/C++.

I started by discovering Gdal and now I'm dealing with Qgis to do my work. I
installed Qgis correctly and I tried a sample code using the Qt Creator IDE
(I didn't chose it, it's imposed). Now I didn't find how to compile my code
correctly on this IDE on Windows OS. I trued to use the addLibraryPath
method to include the headers of Qgis but it didn't work. Does any body know
how to fix this problem please.

Thanks

If you are simply trying to compile your own application against QGis
libs, you would need to provide a lot more detailed information about
your setup and dumps of your QMake files before anyone could even begin
to help you.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WinXP - Cannot start any grass module
Message-ID: <5b1890a50906180514g1f5c6dc2i3b9bc7ead80b571f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just reporting, that I cannot use GRASS via QGIS. Using QGIS 1.0.2
standalone installation and GRASS 6.4.0RC5 on winxp.

1. trying to open any grass module,
I get warning like this one:

"Cannot start module v.in.dxf
C:\GRASS//bin/v.in.dxf.exe --interface-description"

2. trying to open a vector layer from NC dataset
I get warning:

"G_getenv(): Variable GISBASE not set"

and then another one:
"Runtime error!",
which kills QGIS.

No such things with osgeo4w QGIS instalation 1.0.1 nor 1.1

Regards,
Milena

Message-ID: <1245343253.3612.42.camel@sibirica>

Hi,
I'm using qgis 1.2 on ubuntu 9.04 (rev. 10945) and I noticed that
decorations (scale bar, north arrow and copyright) do not show even if
enabled.

Should I file a ticket?

Hi list!
I made some changes into GRASS module to fix some bugs. 
There are some problems about the deletion of a layer. 
Could you give a try to all the stuff and report problems?
Your help is verry appreciated :D

bye

Hopefully these will not be the *last* changes ;)
Your help is more than appreciated: understanding the internals of the
GRASS plugin, not to speak about improving or fixing it, is not an easy
task. Looking forward for your comments.
All the best.

the bug of no numeric column found in point layer while running density tool
is fixed for only shape file. A new numeric field is added to shape file
with unique field name. For non shape file data, this problem is still
valid, but instead of giving an error, an informative message is displayed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help with Tutorial and Eclipse
Message-ID: <633be2250906210519g4949b2cbr69645538ab354e4f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List,

I am wondering if someone can help me get the C++ tutorials to compile using
Eclipse?

Here is my set up:
- Ubuntu 9.04
- QGIS version 1.0.2 standard install from the repositories
- QGIS version 1.2.0 compiled and installed to /usr/local
- Eclipse Ganymede with CDT and Qt Integration

So what I have done is:
1) Create a new Qt GUI Project, GUI Type: QMainWindow (this compiles and
runs but doesn't do anything)
2) Add /usr/include/qgis to the project includes
3) Add the following to the .pro file:
       INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/qgis
       QT += core gui sql xml svg opengl qt3support
4) Copy and paste the tutorial code from http://blog.qgis.org/node/10 to the
automatically generated main.cpp file.

I have also tried to reference the QGIS version 1.2.0 that was compiled
locally, but no luck.

When I try to compile the project it looks like the QGIS classes are not
recognized and I get the errors below.  It looks like it is finding the *.h
files.  I suspect that it is a problem with my *.pro file.

If someone could help me out it would be greatly appreciated, even just a
point in the right direction.

Hi Matthew

I'm not familiar with eclipse as a C++ IDE but I  wonder if you have
declared the compiler constants -DCORE_EXPORT , -DGUI_EXPORT and
- -DPYTHON_EXPORT. It should be fine to declare them as empty vars if you
are under Linux. This is just a shot in the dark since as I mentioned
I've never tried to build under eclipse.

Regards

Tim

I made a clean installation of qgis 1.2 from sources on a clean
installation of linux and still no decorations.

Hi Milena

Yes I am aware of this. My windows virtual machines are currently not
useable since my upgrade to Jaunty. As soon as I get that sorted out I
will take a look and try to build new installers.

If anyone else has a solution in the meantime that would be great. I
seem to recall Juergen Fischer saying something along the lines that the
osgeo installer resolves this by using a batch file to launch all apps
that ensures that all the environment vars are set nicely first....

Regards

Tim

Are you aware the cmake can create projected files for "Eclipse CDT4"?
I never used that, but that might be a start.

Desculpe me :-) My first response was from my cell phone without trying
it yet. I can replicate the issue here. In fact the decoration draw
events are still being triggered, but it looks like something in
mapcanvas may have been changed which has broken them. I'm having a
deeper look to see if I can figure out why.

Tim,

Thanks for the suggestion, I really appreciate your help.

I added the code below to my *.pro file and it runs now, but with some
errors which I need to look into still.

Added code:
  ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DGUI_EXPORT=)
  ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DCORE_EXPORT=)
  ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DPYTHON_EXPORT=)

I am now getting this message when I try to run it:
  QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::findMatchingProj will only work if prj acr
ellipsoid acr and proj4string are set!...
  Layer is valid
  QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::findMatchingProj will only work if prj acr
ellipsoid acr and proj4string are set!...

Some times it runs, sometimes it doesn't after these messages (??).

As a follow-up, do the tutorials need to be compiled against the full source
code or should they work with only the install from the repository?  I have
it "working" with the full source code but am wondering if this is
necessary.

Thanks Again,

Matt

Jurgen,

I was not aware of this.  Thanks for the tip, I will look into it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New substvar for grass depending packages (e.g.
 upstream qgis package)
Message-ID: <20090622081815.GD5308@mithrandir>

Hi d-gis and qgis folk

I'm going to release a new grass-dev package with a suitable
deb-substvars snippet. What i'm going to provide is a tiny
debian.substvars file that can be concatenated to <your-package>.substvars
before calling dh_gencontrol in order to introduce correct versioned 
dependencies on the available grass package.
The auxiliary var will be (as obviuous)

${grass:Depends}

Thanks to Stefan and Sergei from Tcl/Tk team to have pointed me in other
context this useful trick to manage inter-package dependency more easily
than a control template.

It could be considered to provide a debhelper-like method to 
merge grass dependency in all binary packages substvars too, just in
case. I see no reason for that ATM, the only reason to do that
would be getting the package names directly from debian/control
and completing the required files, for instance.

Currently it is more straightforward providing a simple

/usr/lib/grass64/debian.substvars

file in grass-dev. The goal of this var is declaring a binary interface
which can be used for interdependent packages, e.g. Qgis, Gdal plugin
I also would suggest Qgis folks providing the same kind of infrastructure
for possibly dependent packages, such as third-parties python plugins.

At the same time I will provide a debian.mak makefile snippet, with
Make vars which could be used to know where the package places
its own things, what is the grass version installed, what is its
debian interface etc.

Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS slow when zooming
Message-ID: <OF1B146084.A65CF13B-ONC12575DD.00324C70-C12575DD.00336905@comune.trento.it>


Hi, I discovered a problem with QGIS (1.0.2 and 1.1). It's slow when
zooming big vector layers (either in SHP and Postgis format).

Reproduce it with:

1) zoom small region
2) zoom another time

as you can see, QGIS is going to use 100% CPU and remains stuck.

I've attached the shapefile in this URL, so you can test this:

Tim,

Thanks for your help.

I didn't think that I would need a complete svn checkout, but I wanted to
make sure as I though that I read something to the contrary at one point.

I will check out the unit tests as you suggested.

Thanks again,

Matt

Yes, same issue here. I have this problem with some of my data (Shapefiles

I cannot confirm this (just checked against a fresh QGIS form trunk).
On which OS?
Could you please test again with a self-compiled qgis?
Thanks.

The OS is Windows XP, and I've used lastest OSGEO4W QGIS version (1.0.2
stable and 1.1 unstable).

Hi qgis-devs,

I've open a new ticket [1] for this bug. It happens on vector layers. When I
select a feature from the results dialog it has no reference layer to draw
the rubber band and get a segmentation fault.

I also send two possible patches, clearing the results dialog and closing it
when the active layer is remove.

Message-ID: <3AB845CFE24D2B4597EE61C7AAAA839756752BFB73@EXNSW-MBX03.nexus.csiro.au>

Hello,
I'm looking to develop an application that will act like a loosely-coupled server. It will store geospatial data of various formats in the database, and will serve requests from other applications to get / put data in the database.
Is QGIS suitable for this?
Can data from the data store be retrieved via the server and rendered separately?
Is QGIS efficient for continuous updating of data and continuous retrieval of data, for example so that a moving object can be easily rendered?
Does QGIS support using Oracle / Oracle Spatial as the dbms?
Does the QGIS API let you access the database easily?

I had a look at pyQGIS and it looks like you connect to the database with the dataSourceURI, from then on everything with the database is automated? When you create a new vector it automatically saves it in the database?

Thanks in advance!

 Qgis is really intended as a graphical desktop GIS client, so for
what you describe as a 'loosely-coupled' (whatever that means)
'server' you might be adding too many layers of complexity by using
the Qgis API for database access...

 Qgis uses the GDAL and OGR API libraries for data access, so you
would probably benefit from using those directly in your application.
C, C++, and Python bindings directly to GDAL and OGR exist. Your
system will then be able to use any of the OGR data sources for vector
data - this may include Oracle Spatial, but does include PostGIS,
which is my choice of spatial database (Free, Open Source, powerful
and marvellous).

OSGEO4WIN, updated yesterday.
After update gdal16 to 1.6.1-3, when starting QGIS I get error message:
"jpeg12_osgeo.dll could not be found". I search all files in my computer
and there is no "jpeg12_osgeo.dll", so I think this file is missing in
the gdal16 package, or maybe in installer scripts. Now I install back
gdal16 1.6.1-2, everythig work OK, and there is "jpeg12_osgeo.dll" in my
OSGEO4WIN folder in bin subfolder.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis 1.2 findings
Message-ID: <1245939272.3928.136.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,
I'm playing around with qgis 1.2 (rev. 10971) and I have found a number
of situations. I don't know if are bugs or temporary problems just
because it is a work in progress. Just have a look, try to replicate
them and if necessary I will file a ticket. Others are simply
observations looking for feedback.




1) "add a postgis layer". If I try to rename an existing connection
(edit) the connection is duplicated (with the new name) instead of being
changed. It appears only if you first close the "add a postgis layer"
and then reopen it.


2) in every version I used on Ubuntu (since 0.8 or so), when I click the
"add a raster layer" button and then I click the "files of type", the
subsequent drop down window has way too wide dimensions in order to show
all the values of the last option (and it is a very wide line). On
screens without a high resolution this affects usability.


3) in tools (ftools) -> geoprocessing -> clip
If I clip a layer using a grid (as example) as "clip layer" , the
resulting layer has the grid lines on it. The result seems to me
identical to the one I obtain with the "intersect" tool. Clip tool
should use just the borders of the "clip layer"(?).


4) If I change the name of a vector layer in the legend using
"properties -> display name" and then I save the project, when I reopen
the project and I toggle editing mode (for the layer with the changed
name), the icon in the legend doesn't change.


5) "Simplify Feature" tool. When you use this tool a slider appear to
let you choose the tolerance. If you mode the slider forth and back and
then you choose the initial value (and click ok), qgis crashes

"Fatal: ASSERT failure in QVector<T>::operator[]: "index out of range",
file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qvector.h, line 331
Aborted"


6) In a postgis layer if I add a column with the "postgis manager", the
attribute table is not immediately updated, as I have to reload the
layer to see the changes. This doesn't happens if the column is added
trough "Properties -> Attributes", but sometimes (usually the first try)
this freezes qgis.


7) In "Properties -> Attributes" when you click on "add attribute" you
cannot choose "width" and "precision".


8) In "Properties -> Attributes" when a column is added, length and
precision parameters are not shown immediately, as closing and
re-opening the dialog windows is necessary.


9) In a shapefile where I defined a "Diagram Overlay", if I change the
attributes table with the Table Manager, when I save the changes the
Diagram Overlays disappear together with the definitions.


10) If I delete a postgis column with the "postgis manager" and the I
open the attributes table I only see "ERROR" as values. If I reload the
layer everything seems fine.


11) Print composer: when I reopen a saved template, if the underlaying
project is not the one that was in use when I originally created it,
graphics will obviously miss. It would be nice to link the template with
the name of the project, so an alert window can be show if the project
is not the appropriate one.


12) If I click on "Table Manager" and the active layer is a postgis one
a python error is thrown:


"An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File

Hi Giovanni,

thanks for the feedback. But I must note that it's much better to file
a ticket for every bug you encounter. Posting a list of bugs to
mailing list usually generates less or no response.

Not reproducible here. Is that with every layer you try? What type -
polygon / line? Multipart? Does that happen occasionally or always?

Think about postgis manager as an external application: layer loaded
in qgis doesn't know anything about the newly added column (otherwise
it would have to check every time). No idea about the freeze, probably
a run condition.

Applies the same as above.

Hi to all.
I'm developping under mac os x a plugin[1] and I've updated python at 2.6,
with psycopg2-2.0.11 and SQLalchemy 0.5, but qgis doesn't recognize python.
With python 2.5 sqlalchmey doesn't work.

What I can do to make run correctly my plugin? The new version of Qgis will
use python2.6?

Thank you a lot!! 8 )

Ok,
but I just wanted to have your feedback before eventually filing
tickets.

I'm struggling trying find a pattern, but it happens indeed,
lines/polygons/multipart. I tested complex layers and even very simple
ones created on purpose.

So why/how adding a column trough "Properties -> Attributes" works

Same as above :)

deleting a column trough "Properties -> Attributes" doesn't mess
temporarily the table.

Because Qgis doesn't use the python executable, it links directly to  
the Python framework/library.  This ties it to a specific Python  
installation.  You would have to build your own Qgis linked to Python  
2.6.

I don't know about the compatibility of Qgis with Python 2.6.

Thank's a lot William. I've downgraded python at 2.5, with psycopg2 2.0.5.11
(the old installation I've saved) and SQLalchemy 0.5.5 and all run
correctly.
Best regards

Hi all.
I was yesterday at an OGC meeting, and I discovered that software can be
listed easily. I think being listed does not mean much in real terms,
but it has an interesting marketing impact, so I went on and registered
QGIS:
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/#Faunalia
Of course it was just a test, and I do not want to take the merit of
QGIS, so I would suggest to decide together under waht name should it be
listed, then I (or others) can proceed and change the record.
Furthermore, I think it is important if you can check whether the
listing is correct (I added GML 3 because it has just been fixed in
GDAL, thanks to the bug fixing initiative).
All the best.

Hi all.
The Vienna hackmeeting is approaching, and we would like to have as many
devs and power users as possible. We currently have collected
substantially less than we aimed for:
http://www.qgis.org/sponsorship.html
Some additional funds will certainly come, but obviously our users are
not as generous as we have expected, so I think it is safe to count on
2.5kEUR. I'll keep on searching for funds, and ideas on where to look
are always welcome.
I invite therefore the devs who are willing to attend, but do not have
funds to cover travel and hotel costs, to apply for a QGIS grant,
stating how much they need.
We'll do our best to accommodate everybody's needs.
All the best.

Shouldn't that be the OSGeo foundation?  But I see OSGeo projects everywhere,
but OSGeo not once.

Good point. I expected that after the signature of the MoU between OGC
and OSGeo, there would have been a whole lot of good initiatives,
including the listing of projects in OGC. But this had not happened, so
I decided to go on. Would it be ok to list it under QuantumGIS as an
organization?
All the best.

Folks,

I see QGIS is now listed twice.  Once under Faunalia, and once under
HS-RS - OpenSource tools (by Jachym).

I would like to see OSGeo setup as an organization and OSGeo projects
listed under it where practical.  Paolo, would you be interested in
laking the lead on this, and mentioning it on the OSGeo standards
list?  If not, me or Arnulf could likely do it.

Best regards,

Jachym told me he was going to remove it - I'll ask again.

Would it not be better if all OSGeo entries were managed by Tyler? My 
understanding of the way things work in the OGC portal is that the first 
person to register a product under the organization name "OSGeo" will 
become the de-facto administrator of all OSGeo products in the future.

Right. I did it just because Tyler has not done it before.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Directions to get mrsid support in GQIS (and other
 packages using gdal) on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <4A47311F.3010709@gmail.com>

Thanks to Alan Boudreault and the rest
of the ubuntugis team, and, of course, to the gdal team, we can add mrsid support
for QGIS that has been installed from binaries for ubuntu (from 8.04  to 9.04).
This support extends to other software relying on gdal, like package rgdal
for R.

An equivalent package exists for ecw support, I'll send directions for it
in few days.

We have tested these directions on several machines, but we cannot guarantee 
that you will not find other problems. Nevertheless, I do think this
is an small risk.

1. Include the ubuntugis unstable repository according to
https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntugis-unstable

2. sudo apt-get install gdal-mrsid-src gdal-bin

3. Go to http://www.lizardtech.com/developer
login (or register if you have not done it yet)  and  only then you'll see
*Download SDKs*
<http://www.lizardtech.com/developer/members/license.php>
on the left panel. Select  *Download SDKs*
<http://www.lizardtech.com/developer/members/license.php>,
accept the agreement and select the appropriate
*GeoExpress SDK for Linux (x86)
(I think that you can use either the version **gcc 3.2 or*
*gcc 4.1 for ubuntu 8.04 - 9.04, but actually don't know for sure)*
(Micha and I have tested the version for  gcc 4.1)

In the following I assume that you copy the file to /usr/local (you'll need sudo cp)

4.  cd /usr/local
sudo gunzip Geo_DSDK-7.0.0.2167.linux.x86.gcc32.tar.gz
sudo tar -xf Geo_DSDK-7.0.0.2167.linux.x86.gcc32.tar

5. Now you use the gdal-mrsid-build that got made in step 2:
sudo /usr/bin/gdal-mrsid-build /usr/local/Geo_DSDK-7.0.0.2167
Copy  and paste the output to a txt file just in case.
Note that this process makes  /usr/lib/gdal16plugins/gdal_MrSID.so

6. Re-install grass   support if you had it for  previous versions of  gdal:
apt-get install libgdal1-1.6.0-grass

7. Check  the available formats:
gdalinfo --formats

If gdal-mrsid works, you'll see a long list of supported formats with MrSID 
listed near the
top. QGIS will be able to display sid images.



Note: in some machines we get
~$ gdalinfo --formats
ERROR 1: /usr/lib/gdal16plugins/gdal_MrSID.so: undefined symbol:
_ZNSs20_S_empty_rep_storageE
ERROR 1: /usr/lib/gdal16plugins/gdal_MrSID.so: undefined symbol:
_ZNSs20_S_empty_rep_storageE
Supported Formats:
   VRT (rw+): Virtual Raster
   GTiff (rw+): GeoTIFF
   NITF (rw+): National Imagery Transmission Format
etc

In this case, you'll also have an error for package rgdal in R:
  > require(rgdal)

Loading required package: rgdal
Error in fun(...) :
     GDAL Error 1: /usr/lib/gdal16plugins/gdal_MrSID.so: undefined
symbol: _ZNSs20_S_empty_rep_storageE

Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'rgdal'

but this error goes away just by deleting
/usr/lib/gdal16plugins/gdal_MrSID.so

Hope this helps!

Message-ID: <1fef7d9b0906290202n144f2920s727e41e58a0ecf9f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs

I have just started playing with QGIS on WinXP and noticed dependency
problems with the standalone installers posted at:
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/win32/QGIS-1.0.2-0-Setup.exe, and
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/win32/QGIS-1.1.0-0-Setup.exe

Dependency Walker shows a dependency on msvcr80.dll, but msvcr90.dll
is bundled in the installers. I resolved the issue by copying the
following into .\bin
Microsoft.VC80.CRT.manifest
msvcp80.dll
msvcr80.dll

Dependency Walker also shows the following delay-load modules to be missing:
ieshims.dll
wer.dll

These are not present on my WinXP Pro SP3 system and so I have not
been able to resolve these last two dependencies. Any tips?

Regards

Craig

I suspect that those files are blunded in the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008
Redistributable Package (x86)

Hi Luca,

Close, but 90 is the 2008 package and 80 is the Visual C++ 2005 package.
So I guess the installers depend on both packages.

Hi Paolo,

there are some plugins for trac that do the job:
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracMetrixPlugin
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracTicketStatsPlugin

So you might want to ask admins to install such plugin...

Bye
Martin

Hi all.
Would it be possible to move the hackfest page
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/2._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Vienna_2009
to a more prominent position? Now it is very difficult to find.
Also, please devs confirm your participation, and start booking your flight.
Also, we had a suggestion to organize short courses on QGIS programming,
just before or after the meeting. This could generate some additional
resources and help covering costs. If someone is interested, please show up.
Thanks.

Hi QGis-dev's.

I open a new ticket for this issue: http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1753

Should I avoid the 'on the fly' transformation on raster layers?

Hi,
I have not received much feedback, so I'll file tickets.

My only doubt is about who is the most appropriate person to assign the
ticket for a particular component.

I can find this info on the qgis wiki?

thanks
