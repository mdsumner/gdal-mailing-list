Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsRasterHistogram Python bindings
Message-ID: <CALuHMPA9hLUhZ=O6-AMq+xdvm6yCf7sEkjNsm3THqp=NSJi=cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

while working on Processing algorithms I have found an issue with
QgsRasterHistogram class. According to the documentation, member
histogramVector should not be available in Python [0], but it is present
in the corresponding SIP file. However, any attempt to access this member
leads to QGIS crash.

Should we remove histogramVector from Python? Or it should be exposed
and there is a bug/incomplete implementation in bindings?

That's odd - there's nothing particularly unusal about
HistogramVector. A vector of ints should be accessibly from Python.

Why not try removing the typedef use from the sip file and see if that
helps? E.g.

#ifndef SIP_RUN
HistogramVector histogramVector;
#else
QVector<int> histogramVector;
#endif

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Possible discussion during hackfest?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjGs9pjunaFS+1y+s-SVbkS77hfGdH2bSdVEa-40y7T7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm wondering if it's possible for us to block aside some time during
the upcoming hackfest for a group discussion about the future of QGIS.

In the previous hackfests I've attended there's been excellent
presentations showing off what individual organisations (and
individuals themselves) are working on for future inclusion in the
QGIS ecosystem, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing these
again this weekend. But apart from some targeted discussions (such as
making plans for qt5/python 3/qgis 3/issue tracker) I haven't been
aware of any larger discussion amongst all these interested parties
about the general "future direction" of the project.

Specifically - I'd LOVE for us to set aside some time for all these
invested parties to be able to discuss what we see as weaknesses in
QGIS and possible threats to its future success as a project. And
obviously, make some collaborative plans together about what we can do
to address these weakness (and smash down any threats to our world
dominance with lava powered mega super lasers ;) ).

Would anyone else find this valuable? For me, setting aside 30-60 mins
for SWOT Analysis on QGIS' future amongst all these organisations and
individuals who are financially/emotionally invested in the project
would alone make my trip to the hackfest worthwhile :)

Message-ID: <CAP=p+YuwvoK9yZvRJwx100Ye+GE36cWj1QQdS4HPgcwbtpPE-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
       I am currently planning the next 12 months of the AequilibraE plugin
development, particularly for the following features:

- Public transit travel assignment
- Vehicle routing (up to capacitated with time windows)
- Modelling tools for demand-responsive transit (necessary to model a world
of autonomous vehicles playing a role in public transit)

Many of the possible development paths, however, include the use of more
Python libraries currently available on QGIS for Windows (So far I have
made a point to make the plugin compatible with all major platforms). On
that note, I have three questions:

1 - Will it be easier to add new libraries to the QGIS 3 Python
installation? (Using PIP, Wheels, or any other technology)

2 - Where do I find the list of Python packages available on QGIS for
windows (present and planned)

3 - How do I get a new python library shipped with QGIS by default?

Cheers,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS server vs LTR
Message-ID: <c34869cd-3694-2bdf-4361-2cb22a3bc829@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
now that 2.18 is LTR, I think many people will be tempted to upgrade
their qgis-server. I'm not aware of anyone testing the new version of
the server, either alone or with Lizmap oe QWC2 clients.
During the HF I'd like to do the testing, if nobody has already done.
So the questions are:
* anyone has done the testing?
* anyone wants to join the effort, either here in Ndebo or remotely?
* anyone has an indication that 2.18 server could fail?
* any are were testing would require spacial care? Maybe external wms,
wfs, tms?
Thanks for feedback.

Hi,

I'm not getting any crash here.
Do you have any mean to produce a stacktrace?

Here is backtrace produced by QGIS https://pastebin.com/HfnVhKDd.
And another one taked with gdb https://pastebin.com/q7a2wgg9.

Also tested on Windows using latest nightly build (c373c8b). No crash,
but error

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python36\lib\code.py", line 91, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
MemoryError

For testing I use following code and dem.tif layer from Processing
test dataset:

layer = iface.mapCanvas().activeLayer()
histogram = layer.dataProvider().histogram(1, 10, None, None,
QgsRectangle(), 0, False)
histogram.histogramVector

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS server vs LTR

As far as I have seen there are two major problems, one actually
caused by a change in QGIS Desktop layout composer, see:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2017-July/049400.html

So at is now QGIS Server 2.18.11 is basically broken for use within a
webgis application (no getprints if the layout has a label/text box),
also for me the problem with the legend is a blocker to its adoption.

cheers

in my test print works even when text boxes are there, e.g.
https://lizmap.faunalia.eu/index.php/view/map/?repository=faunalia&project=conca

I think now that 2.18 is LTR we should either fix these issues or warn
users to stick to 2.14 for a server.

all the best.

I personally don't have any issues with QGIS server 2.18. I use it in 
production.

I had a bug fixed with layer rendering order if one would call by a 
group layer (esp. the root layer) without specifiying all leaf layers - 
but it is fixed since a few weeks.

Other than that I don't have any issues - but I may not use all of the 
features (like the legend stuff).

Hi Nyall,

Does it make sense to open a new issue on QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals
for the meeting? We could start filling items for each dimension of the
SWAT analysis. I'm attending a presentation with some QGIS "weaknesses"
that I could add for the meeting in advance.

Regards,

Jorge

Yeah let's go planning QGIS 4 !
+1 for pushing SWOT and decisions in a QEP, so that those who couldn't make
it to nodebo can folloW. One of or weaknesses is clearly that we don't
communicate enough on decisions made during hackfests, maybe because of 🍺?
 😉
Have I a good time in the never ending sunset country folks !

Hello,


I have a (rather big) Postgres/PostGIS database that basically looks
like this: https://ibb.co/bK7PKv


I want to use QGIS for editing and inserting data.


I already found these ressources:

https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#fields-properties

https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html#creating-one-or-many-to-many-relations

https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/forms.html


I tried it: I created the relations and built custom forms.


However, when I want to insert or edit something. QGIS becomes really
slow and crashes finally. But before I describe the problems in more
detail I want to read more about it. I find the documentation (linked
above) a bit too little.


So, my question:


Is there any documentation I have missed?

Is there any book (chapter) you can recommend?

Do you know of any example where QGIS is used for entering data into
many related tables in Postgres/PostGIS at once?


I am thankful for any hint or resource.


Jakob

Message-ID: <54e858cd-ce47-b37f-eb88-cd510e4c5211@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I just created a PR for QGIS Server concerning GetPrint.
Because of the lack of test on the different GetPrint specific 
parameters in the precedent versions, I don't know if the refactoring 
gives exactly the same features. So I need reviews and tests to add new 
tests.

The good news for QGIS Server is that when this PR will be merged, we'll 
be able to definitely remove all the old project parser codes from the 
server.

Good Hackfest!

René-Luc

Hi all,
loading a layer from the filesystem in a Processing module (I tried
several, e.g. remove holes) does not filter layer types; this is
confusing, only vector extensions should be shown.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS expressions: map vs dict
Message-ID: <1fd418a2-aa6c-b2e8-209e-20d6daec4bf0@carto.net>

Hi devs, Hi Patrick,

I noticed that in QGIS master there is a new group of expressions called 
"Maps". I think they have been developed by pvalsecc (Camptocamp). 
First, thanks for adding them!

I know that is has been added a while ago, but I would like to discuss, 
if this group of functions could be renamed to "Dicts", with a prefix of 
"dict_xx" instead of "map_xx". Alternatively, it could be named "kvp_" 
(key/value pairs).

The reasoning is that in the future we may want to have multiple maps 
per project and we may want to reserve "Maps" for actual maps 
(identified by name or id).

Besides, users that do not know programming, might not understand that 
this is not about maps, but actually about a dictionary data structure 
or key/value pairs.

----------------

Another thing: the declaration of a "map" or "dict" could be improved:

The current notation is:
map('1','one','2', 'two')

Wouldn't it be nicer to have something like:
map('1':'one', '2':'two') or map('1':='one', '2':='two')

It would be easier to read than just a lot of commas, where every second 
one is a key, resp. the value.

Any thoughts on these two issues about "map" expressions?

Thanks,

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Two additional useful array functions
Message-ID: <43b48c13-dd75-664f-e089-bcd87432956a@carto.net>

Hi again,

On the topic of the new array expression functions in QGIS master:

The available list of array expression functions is already quite complete.

Two additional array functions that I would like to see implemented are:

array_reverse(array) (would reverse the order within the array of all 
elements)

and

array_slice(array, start_value,end_value) - this would make it easier to 
extract say a portion of the array, e.g. from the 4th to the 10th element.

Is there any chance that this could be added?

Thanks,

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Creating Arrays and Maps from aggregates and
	relations
Message-ID: <0eae8792-5660-5afb-7aae-f12a833459e2@carto.net>

Hi,

At the moment an array or map data structure in an expression can only 
be created by using the array() and map() constructor function where one 
has to explicitly include all the values at the creation of the data 
structure. Arrays can also be created from strings with the 
string_to_array function.

Wouldn't it be useful if the arrays could be created by an aggregate 
function and in particular the relation_aggregate function (esp. useful 
for analyzing 1:n relations)?

Something like: aggregate(layer:='countries', aggregate:='array', 
expression:="area") --> array with all areas of the countries

or

relation_aggregate(relation:='cities_in_countries',aggregate:='array', 
calculation:="towns") --> array with all towns that are related to a 
country.

---------------

Similar for maps:

aggregate(layer:='countries', aggregate:='map', expression:="area", 
mapAttributes:="area, population") --> nested maps with all areas and 
population per country.

or

relation_aggregate(relation:='cities_in_countries',aggregate:='map', 
mapAttributes:="town_name,town_population") --> array with all town 
attributes that are related to a country.

Any thoughts?

Andreas

Hi,

As "array" is already a key word in QGIS expressions, to aggregate 
values in an array, I would propose to use the same as postgis : "array_agg"

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changing the logic for map extents in composer
	templates?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiWBA+fkgNq-6abZTjmQ=CyhC=MM8bJAJ-1uQVwofW0hA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've recently been made aware of an issue regarding creating new print
compositions from templates.

Currently, the logic used here is:

1. For all map items in the template, check the stored map extent
2. If this stored extent intersects the full extent of the layers in
the map canvas, then keep it. If not, reset the map item's extent to
match the map canvas.

I think this logic could be refined. The issue is that any project
with a "global" basemap layer (such as a wms/xyz
tiled/QuickMapServices/etc layer) will ALWAYS satisy the "stored
extent intersects the full canvas extent" requirement, so the map
item's extent will never be altered.

Possible solutions I can see are:
1. Change the test to be "if the stored extent has any intersection
with the CURRENT map canvas extent, keep it. Otherwise reset it to the
map canvas extent."
2. (more intrusive, but more flexible) Add a new "template settings"
section to composer map item properties, with a checkbox for "Store
map extent for use in templates". If checked, the stored map extent in
the template will ALWAYS be used for that map. If unchecked, the map's
extent will ALWAYS be reset to match the current canvas extent. It's
an extra setting, but possibly making the logic explicit and visible
to users will actually make this behaviour simpler to understand.

What are other's thoughts?

Although it adds a new setting, my vote goes to solution 2. I'm not a fan
of "black magic".

Hi Devs,

To enhance QGIS Server 2.18, I have tested to add some test and I have 
some trouble with Highlight layers.
Does some one have using this feature ?

on master? 2.18?
On 2.18 it shows all the files by default, as the normal "add vector
layer" dialog, then you have the "files of type" dropdown to select a
specific type of vector data source, as the normal "add vector layer"
dialog.

This was fixed an eternity ago (e.g.

committed yesterday)

I still see the vector type seelctor in QGIS/master on Windows.
Can't try on Linux now. If in your DE that does not show plase open a
ticket and file
it as a regression.

Thanks for chacking.
I did not check on 2.18, so I'm unsure it's a regression.
All the best.

Processing message is:

Anyone else have this problem?

Hi Calvin,

Due to frequent changes in SAGA algorithms, that forced frequent updates to
processing, it was decided to only support SAGA's long-term release. So, if
you a version of SAGA other than 2.3.2, that might be the problem.

 mode when using drag&drop designer
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7zSck0kNodrF+2McWrwEe2fcDoOFQ+x8SLdLHa6kh6BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A user reported an issue on QGIS 2.18.11 (and probably previous versions).
When the drag and drop designer is used for a vector layer, the attribute
table, viewed in form mode, does not show any colour underneath the current
feature.

See this image
https://framapic.org/Ft1j3xwqga2D/8ARZc3qUL6AP.jpg

Is is a known issue ? I will obvioulsy open a ticket if needed.

Regards
Michaël

Hi Michaël,

I can't confirm here (2.18.11, win10) but I think your screenshot says all.
The background color should appear under the feature whose attributes are
displayed on the right.

I would also like to observe that another thing weird in the screenshot is
the count of selected features at the top of the customized form dialog
showing 0 while there's obviously a selected feature (yellow square).
Might not be related but worth mentioning.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi

There are no specific requirements for QGIS on Windows - any computer made
in the last 10 years will probably run it fine - newer hardware and better
specs will perform better with larger datasets, heavier processing routines.

Android version is available in the App Store - search for QField.

Regards

Tim

Hi there,

I'm seeing this message when committing:

Running spell check on files: images/themes/default/mGeoPackage.svg

did I do something wrong in my commit hooks configuration or is the
spellchecker really supposed to also scan icons?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] User defined env vars on QGIS Master Windows
Message-ID: <211d7a61351277cc321e1be10c699e41@carto.net>

Hi, 

I use Postgis service definitions and define them centrally in a
pg_service.conf file. This concerns QGIS master on Windows. 

While this works fine on QGIS 2.18, I have issues in master - only if I
define PGSYSCONFDIR centrally in the Windows operating system, this
variable is honored, not if I define them in QGIS under Settings -->
Options --> System --> Environment. In this latter case, the env var is
ignored. 

I am pretty sure, this issue is rather recent, because it already worked
with older QGIS master builds. 

Maybe this has somehow to do with the "Add layer" refactoring in QGIS
master? Just a wild guess - perhaps it is some different issue. 

In any way, I would like to know if I am the only one experiencing this
problem. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

You could a batch file in etc\ini instead that sets PGSYSCONFDIR.  That will be
run before QGIS starts (I do that with NLS_LANG for Oracle sometimes) and
doesn't pollute the global enviroment.  Note that the change might not be
picked up if you run a pinned QGIS instead of starting it via the shortcut (you
need to run that at least once).

My guess is that PGSYSCONFDIR is set too late from the QGIS settings - ie.
after the first connection is attempted.

2.18 is now what you translate if you go to Transifex

See 'fixme' links in headers to fix text or translations.

Let us know if you spot problems or think your language should be build

Thanks for all your work.

I noticed a strange ` ` marks in the top of every page. Is that the
disclaimer message, do we need to remove it?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue with $scale in QGIS 3
Message-ID: <a48f47e2c54c59a6be677bb3f7240e5f@carto.net>

Hi, 

I use the function $scale in a data-defined label property (letter
spacing property). The expression worked fine in QGIS 2.18 but fails in
QGIS 3. 

Did something change in the expression context in QGIS master, so that
$scale can't be used in label settings context anymore - or is this a
bug? 

The reason I still use $scale and not @map_scale is that we still have
QGIS servers on 2.18 around, and QGIS server in the 2.x branch can't use
the @map_scale variable. 

Thanks if you know about this issue, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671g2Eh0w_3rBv8PnU7gS7Z_ZQOF6O_9_HYQ6J7mQLShnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm confused about the correct naming for this possibly duplicated
functions:


In the base class QgsDataProvider, we have and empty (returns 0):
virtual uint subLayerCount() const

but, in the providers code we have a mix of layerCount and subLayersCount,
the former is not virtual.

IMHO, we should use the base class virtual subLayersCount and rename all
the providers layerCount to override the subLayersCount.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjgZ=b=nBjc7M=JXwm+y8+c+mAGZ3zJH6ySC4=Kd2CvPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

In the pull request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4993 these three
classes are proposed to be removed from QGIS 3.0.

The rationale here is the these classes are unused in the master QGIS
code, they are unmaintained and have no unit tests or other QA, and
all have inflexible API (e.g. always requiring writing outputs to
shapefiles).

They all have equivalent (and more optimised and flexible) algorithms
available via Processing (where the algorithms are unit tested and
maintained). We should be pushing all QGIS api users to use the
Processing algorithms instead.

Please speak up now if you have objections to their removal.

Hi all,

Another heads up - PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4994 removes
startup tips from QGIS 3.0, with the intention of freeing up the
first-run user experience for an enhanced welcome screen.

If you have STRONG objections to this change, please comment on

in favour of removing tips, so we'd need a strong reason to keep them
around now...

Hi devs,

I have just realized that we never decided on a very important question,
so I thought it would be a good point in time to do this now.

Should documentation for methods be written in imperative or descriptive
language? In explicit, should it be

* "Add a new part to a multi type geometry"

or

* "Adds a new part to a multi type geometry"


I have a tendency for imperative "Add a new part...".
Thank you all for helping to decide on this crucial question, I really
wonder how it happened that this was never defined in the coding standard.

Matthias

I'd go the other way, and use "adds a new part"/"returns the outline
color"/etc. Reason is that this is what Qt does, which we've modeled
other parts of our standards on.

I have thought about that for tool tips and documentation (not code), and I
think it sounds better in the descriptive form. I guess for code this is
similar.

Hi all,

Following on from discussion at the recent hackfest, please see QEP 100 at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/100

regarding proposed changes to datum transformation handling within
QGIS. Anyone with interest in how QGIS handles datum transforms
(including the looming introduction of temporal dependant datum
transforms, such as GDA 2020) should read and comment on the proposed
changes.

Timing is tight for this one - but at the same time it's a "3.0 or
never" type change!

My 2 cents after som testing:

1. I agree with the necessity to consider only the vertices of the selected
feature(s), it's the best way to resolve edition at common boundary. Nyall's
proposed approach seems good to me, otherwise another idea to avoid the
"magic effect": we can just test if the selected feature(s) is visible in
the viewport and if not display a warning message explaining why there is no
editable vertex in the current view.

2. About the double click to add a new vertex anywhere on a segment. This
behavior does not really match the click-click approach. I think a double
click must result on a new vertex added and validated, like 2 following
simple click without move of the node position. On another side, ability to
add a vertex anywhere on the segment is an important feature, for this task
it will be more instinctive to see the "+" symbol (actually displaying only
at the middle of a segment) following the mouse mouvement across the edge so
we can add a new vertex at any point of the segment without perform a double
click.

3. I'm not in favour with the ability to highlight and move a segment,
selecting 2 vertices to move a segment seems enough to me.

4. Selecting one or several nodes by drawing a rectangle is very udsefull
but it lack the ability to add new nodes to the current selection by
maintenaing ctrl or shift key.

Regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GRASS and SAGA providers in 3
Message-ID: <CAA70oVXYF9eLa66Yj-DL=SwaZeZurR8jz+30Ynywh0p92gXNcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I have some Q's about these providers in 3. I know the toolbox has been
reorganized by operation instead of provider. I've also noticed that GRASS
and SAGA are no longer providers in the latest nightly release. This came
up during preparation for the State of QGIS talk at FOSS4G with Larry, and
the plan forward was not clear to us. Those algorithms are obviously
heavily used by many QGIS users.

I also just noticed that porting SAGA algs to the new API is being worked
on. I'm assuming that porting these two sets of algs to the new API is
simply not completed yet. Am I right on that?

When enabled, will these algs be placed into the appropriate operation
folder in toolbox?

Will they be enabled by default or will users need to enable those
providers via Settings-->Providers?

Will there be an indication of which provider a tool is from?

Thanks!
Kurt

​Are you referring to

before_install:
- sudo apt-get -qq -y update
​
or something else that I failed to recognize as potential fix?

Thank you for helping me out with this!

That's only for "native" QGIS algorithms. External provider based
algorithms (GDAL/SAGA/GRASS/etc) will still show up under folders for
those providers, just like 2.x. It's another way to push people to try
the QGIS native algorithms by default.

(which reminds me - the current grouping is a mess of duplicate and
near identical groups... we need to clean that up before release and
have only a few logical, non overlapping categories)

Yes - it's a work in progress still. SAGA algs are being worked on in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5021, we need someone to step up and
port the GRASS ones. GDAL still has a few left to port (volunteers
welcome), but the QGIS ones are 97% there (I'll do the remainder of
those).

We desperately NEED more people to step up and help here. In the worst
case scenario (no-one ports grass or the remaining GDAL algs) I'll
have to resort to reverting all the c++ processing improvements OR
have duplicate "processingv2" plugin type approach (with only the
ported algs, and a duplicate "processing v1" 2.x style plugin).

No change here from 2.x.

Off topic - but I'd love to see your slides from OSGEO4w!

Hi Nyall,
Thanks that helps. I wish I had to skill set to help with this. I can at
least help on the testing end.
Larry has the final slide deck in Keynote. I'm hoping he can export that
and make it available.

Hi Anita,

There was (unfortunately) a lot more to it, like path mangling etc.
However, at the moment I wouldn't spend more time on it, Denis is looking into building regularly updated Docker images for master/3.x releases especially designed for easy travis integration. I'll be looking into integrating these for plugin tests these days. You better wait for this.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Question on signed windows installers
Message-ID: <6ce81255fcdd183a3c974da188cbf4a2@carto.net>

Hi Jürgen, 

I noticed that the Windows all-in-one installers are now signed (Open
Source Geospatial Foundation). Is 2.18.12 the first signed version or
were the previous versions also signed? 

In any case - wanted to report back that our AV scanner did not complain
about 2.18.12, whereas it "swallowed" the QGIS 3 weekly without even
visibly notifying (only in the log file one could see that QGIS 3 was
sent to quarantine and the original installer file removed). Perhaps
signing installers builds trust with AV software? Installing over
OSGEO4W installer is always fine. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Yes, it's the first one.

The weeklies apparently weren't built for a while.  Did anyone else notice?

I added signing for the weekly yesterday.  Requires wine and in turn xvfb -
because we need to produce an extra installer that installs an uninstaller, so
we can sign it and include it in the actual installer - runs fine locally (but
w/o xvfb), but currently the final step crashes with a bus error on qgis2...

Hi Jürgen, 

Thanks a lot for the explanations, your work and efforts around signing
and fixing the weeklies! 

Another step in order to make QGIS more professional.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Auxiliary data storage for labeling,
	UNDO/REDO - where does it belong to?
Message-ID: <CABgOYCeTmM7fx-9JR0RzYhH8mZ06+Aa9_hgN8tQY1i0i3fB8jQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

one major drawback of QGIS has long been that labeling was considered as
part of the datasources, which can be true in some cases, but often it more
belong to a project map object

We, at Oslandia, working on adding Auxiliary storage capabilities to QGIS,
which was discussed in several QEP [1] before.

Now we are close to merge but the work but I would like to discuss some
ergonomics and design polishing.

In all GIS tool, custom labeling informations have been stored in project
file, except in QGIS (which was a brilliant idea to keep it simple !).

A user will now have two ways of storing labeling data :
 - In the datasource by manually adding the fields and setting the
corresponding labeling widget. Only advanced users, with grants on the
datasource do that
-  Using an auxiliary data source sqlite db stored inside the project, just
directly using the labeling toolbar, even on readonly layers. 90 % of the
users will use that I think.

If we consider that a label modification (location, style, rotation ...)
belongs to a project, then we save it when a user saves the project.
If we consider it is belonging to the data, we save it with data save
button.
Rollback for data edits exists using the edit buffer.
But Rolling back project modifications exists only partially, in composer's
edit command list or in dynamic styling panel.


Our concern is about how to handle and display the undo/redo actions for
labeling when they are stored inside the project file.


We thought about 4  ways before concluding that:
- merge the labeling command in the source layer's edit buffer stack ->
that won't work if the layer is readonly. If a user chose not to use the
auxiliary data, then it will work like normal editing.
- add separate buttons to save auxiliary data by hand (which is the same
action as saving a project in fact). Tollbars are too cluttered and users
are already confusing data and project save buttons.
- Create a global "project" or maybe "mapcanvas" level stack, but I suspect
users would like to be able to rollback style, composer and labeling
independently, when undoing some labeling action could also remove some
layers or important styling things.
- Finally, we decided to add a separate edit buffer for the auxiliary data
inside the dynamic styling panel, just below the style/label edit buffer.

So  has anyone any strong opinion here?

Is there any plan somewhere for a Project Undo/Redo, allowing for instance
to Cancel a layer deletion ?

If yes, please share your thoughts so that we store each undo/redo stack at
the right place, and hopefully with something users will understand easily.

All the best,
Régis

If I may,

I would prefer to have one global undo/redo stack of buttons for all
project related tasks in QGIS main window (this should include labels,
styles, layers order, layer adding and so on). Even if that means that if
you go back too much, you risk removing some layers from the project, or
other more destructive actions. IMHO, having segmented undo/redo will also
create confusion among the users. Map composer, as a different window is
the exception, and should work separately.

Thanks for the work on auxiliary data storage, that will be great!!

Yes of course! This feedback is much appreciated.
Having labeled a lot of data, I'm still not very sure  by myself of what I
would prefer. When I feel weird to lose my labels customization when
rolling back a symbol color, having a clutered UI with multiple undo-redo
panels everywhere sucks t.

We chose the separated undo / redo approach because that's what was done
for composer and styling, and we didn't feel mature enough on the
specifications for a unified undo/redo stack for project editing.

For instance, CTRL+Z is by default on data editing and feels as the natural
shortcut for cancel. How should that behave in an edit session mixed with
project modifications.
Also, some actions need to be excluded from the undo stack at project level
such as zooming, panning. There are already buttons for that, on we could
end with enormous  and noisy stacks. Every undoable action also needs to be
named in the queue to help user find its way in the history, and that can
be a big work to clarify all that.

I would propose to launch a dedicated QEP with a 3.2 milestone so that we
can discuss ergonomics and details separately.
If anyone is interested in supporting that work, let us know.
Thoughts ?

Hi Anita,

I got around to doing this now.

For the project here I had to add a bit of additional overhead because
it requires some additional binaries and services compared to a plain
installation

- postgres
- java

So I had to use docker-compose (for postgres) and an extra Docker file
(to install the dependencies).

It's still super-easy - it just could be even a tiny bit simpler, if
these are skipped.

It only requires these files:
https://github.com/opengisch/projectgenerator/tree/master/.docker

And these lines:
https://github.com/opengisch/projectgenerator/blob/2bf4d2acc43da9b0bcedd5f530715d287a6d12d6/.travis.yml#L1-L2

It all depends on the awesome work from Denis who managed to provide
regularly updated builds of the current master branch on dockerhub.

Let me know how it goes for you
Matthias

? Thanks in advance! Martin

Hello all

There was an issue with null values in GeoJSON exports:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16812

Was the fix ever backported to LTR?

Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What to do with QgsTransectSample for 3.0?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgNPA+ujRj7+1OmVtQQjacpD8v-hucf-m32qv24W9yG4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just been doing some cleanups on the analysis lib - see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5078, and I'm now wondering what we
should do with the QgsTransectSample class.

Earlier in the cycle Alex and Victor did a bunch of work exposing a
lot of the analysis lib functionality via processing. But this class
is not used anywhere - it's not utilised by the master c++ code, and
is not exposed via processing either. So we're carrying it around only
for potential use by 3rd party plugins/scripts.

BUT:
- it's unmaintained, and has had no work done (beside compilation
fixes) in the recent past
- it's outdated, and has a bunch of antique assumptions (like always
writing to shapefile outputs)
- there's 0 unit tests
- there's almost no documentation on exactly WHAT this class does, and
how it should be correctly used. And without use in the master
codebase to model from, I can't see how a 3rd party can be expected to
utilise this code correctly anyway.

Options I see are:
1. remove it and avoid the issues
2. get someone who knows how transect sampling SHOULD work to look
over the current logic, take up maintenance, add unit tests, and
expose this functionality via processing
3. leave it in it's current form with unknown quality and unexposed
functionality

Thoughts? I personally see 3 as not an option, and while 2 would be
nice, I honestly can't see anyone picking this up.

I would advice to go with 1

Ouch, it's apprently wasn't the signing stuff after all - including the PDBs
just exceeded the 2GB limit for NSIS installer.  w/o the PDBs it works fine.

Hi, 

We are starting to use QGIS 3 in production because we need some of the
newer features. 

The one major annoying issue is the misalignment of the highlight
geometry of the identify tool. 

Can we please, please fix this issue? 

See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16824 

It would help us a lot! 

Thanks,

Hi nihcas,

There are updated instructions to build QGIS on Windows (submitted as PR
#4990 during the hackfest in Nødebo).

Take a look at the instructions:

https://github.com/imiara/QGIS/blob/8726146feda8932e4d47e148c8dbba163f179421/doc/msvc.t2t

If you find something missing on these instructions, please let us know.

Regards,

Jorge

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBijpFMk-XOd1w07T9JKubU2jbH9ivEuJQzQhLrVzm1yjw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to create a new RasterDataProvider within the same Library as
the
QgsSpatiaLiteProvider, which is called: QgsRasterLite2Provider.

An extra class has been created, but cannot be found by
the QgsProviderRegistry, reporting 'Invalid data provider rasterlite2'.

I have assumed, that since Grass also has both a Raster and Vector provider
that this would not cause a problem.

Some sort of extra step seems to be needed that I have overlooked.

I'm not sure if you are aware of it, but GDAL 2.2 SQLite driver supports rasterlite2 datasets 
(in read-only), provided it is built against librasterlite2.

Yes, I know.
This a part of the 'overhaul' of the QgsSpatiaLiteProvider in preparation
for Spatialite 4.5.0 which will contain more functionality along with
RasterLite2 which be released with it.

At the moment, however, the GDAL 2.2 SQLite does not render the present
(development) version of RasterLite2 correctly, which I assume is due to
the latest changes made in RasterLite2.

Hi Jorge

Thanks for your guideline.

I follow the instructions a below:

1. 	MS VS 2015 setup with python tools complete.
2. 	cygwin x64 installed at c:\cygwin.
3. 	osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe installed at D:\OSGeo4W64.
(For this I have used "OSGeo4W-setup-x86_64.exe -R d:\OSGeo4W64 -a x86_64 -A
-k -P qgis-dev -P qtkeychain-qt5-devel -P oci-devel -P expat -P fcgi -P gdal
-P grass -P gsl-devel -P iconv -P libzip-devel -P libspatialindex-devel -P
pyqt5 -P python3-devel -P python3-qscintilla -P python3-nose2 -P
python3-future -P python3-pyyaml -P python3-mock -P qca-qt5-devel -P
qca-qt5-libs -P qscintilla-qt5 -P qt5-devel -P qt5-libs-debug -P
qtwebkit-qt5-devel -P qtwebkit-qt5-libs-debug -P qwt-devel-qt5 -P sip-qt5 -P
spatialite")
4. 	Ninja.exe copied to d:\OSGeo4W64\bin.
5.	cmake-3.7.2-win64-x64.msi installed at C:\Program Files\CMake
6.	created at batch file at d:\OSGeo4W64\OSGeo4W-dev.bat. Structure of batch
file is
	"@echo off

	set OSGEO4W_ROOT=D:\OSGeo4W64
	call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"
	call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qt5_env.bat"
	call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\py3_env.bat"

	set VS140COMNTOOLS=%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio
14.0\Common7\Tools\
	call "%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
amd64

	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft
SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Include
	set LIB=%LIB%;%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Lib

	path %PATH%;%PROGRAMFILES%\CMake\bin;c:\cygwin\bin

	@set GRASS_PREFIX="%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.2.1
	@set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\include
	@set LIB=%LIB%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\lib;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\lib

	@cmd"

7.	Open the windows command prompt and run d:\OSGeo4W64\OSGeo4W-dev.bat.
After that check 
"git clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git"

9.	Open package-nightly.cmd as shown below. I had replaced "cmake -G Ninja"
with "cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"" and rest **No change**.

10.	On the command prompt I have run "OSGeo4W-dev.bat" again. After that
package-nightly.cmd 2.99.0 1 qgis-dev x86_64.

11. *The result in command prompt is as below*:

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671QpBGJdQQjeimfXuSb5HXSeFAOrxe7wDDZ+75=Q3f1zw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Unfortunately this is not a fancy new feature but only a small refactoring
:)

Maybe it did not worth a QEP, but I'd appreciate some other comments before
moving forward.

Thanks!
