Subject: [Qgis-developer] printing to svg
Message-ID: <2592.60.234.100.23.1154426676.squirrel@secure.niwa.co.nz>

Hi,

I've been looking at resolving a few of the problems with printing to svg
in qgis, but have run up against a number of problems with Qt4's
implementation of svg that make it difficult to produce correct svg's from
the qgis map composer.

I don't think that the current svg output from qgis is of a good enough
standard yet and would like to remove it from the map composer, or at
least inform the user that the output from it may be less than desired.

I note however that Qt4.1 now offers a print to pdf option which seems to
do the job well, and think that a save to pdf could be a suitable
replacement for save to svg until Qt4 sorts out it's svg stuff (or we find
and use an alternative svg writing library).

Comments?

Gavin

Hi

I would go for the warning user approach, as for simple use cases it
may still be relevant...
PDF output is always nice!

hello everyone,
this is in continuation to my previous mail,
with the command 'ogrinfo --formats' ihave got following output

  -> "SDTS" (readonly)
  -> "TIGER" (read/write)

I am struggling with this issue now for some time now?
kindly anyone will put some light on it?

I would like to try compiling qgis v0.8.0 preview 1 from source.
However, I find that it is distributed without a configure script.
When I try to generate one with autoconf, it fails with various m4

Could you please redistribute the source with an appropriate configure
script, send one to me privately, or explain how I can generate it
myself.

Thank you very much for your help.

What platform are you using? You should use the autogen.sh script to  
generate configure. Pass the switches you want to use with configure  
to autogen.sh as it runs configure after the auto* portion is complete.

Typically these types of errors are due to older versions of automake  
and autoconf. You should have at least:

gsherman@madison:~$ automake --version
automake (GNU automake) 1.8.5

gsherman@madison:~$ autoconf --version
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59

Message-ID: <44D4DC31.3030703@loskot.net>

Today, one of QGIS user in Poland asked me a question about custom
symbols in QGIS.
Here I'm forwarding his questions:
1. There are 5 poing symbols available in QGIS. Is it possible to add
new symbols, for example SVG files?
2. If it is possible, how to add new symbols to the QGIS?
3. Are there any additional point symbols available to download from a
website?

I'd appreciate any feedback on this subject.

Message-ID: <44D4F7CE.2080303@loskot.net>

FOSS4G2006] QGIS Screencasts CD Proposal

Today, I encountered interesting article on LinuxNews.pl website (a
polish Linux news aggregator)
about screencasts and Captorials (http://www.captorials.com). Shortly, I
started to think about promoting QGIS on FOSS4G 2006 (and not only on
FOSS4G) with screencasts. I had a short chat with Gary on the #qgis and
he told me he was also thinking about similar idea. Here, I'd like to
present my proposal of "QGIS Screencasts CD" promotion activity.

What is a screencast?

Here is the answer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast

What is Captorials.com?

Simply, it's a video-based helpdesk center:
"Captorials.com holds homebrew screen-recordings, also known as
screencasts or simply, captorials."

What's the idea of "QGIS Screencasts CD"?

Captorials.com idea provoked me to think about QGIS Screencasts CD.
Inspiration

I believe there is no need to explain why screencasts are nice idea to
promote Quantum GIS.
In a few words, I see following roles that screencasts can play:
- a (revolutionary) way of providing support - especially for
non-technical users
- portable presentation of QGIS features without installation
- promotion - everyone likes gadgets, movies, presentations, etc.

Plan

The idea is simple and consists of following tasks:
1. Collect a bunch of QGIS screencasts
2. Prepare >= 100 CDs with collected screencasts (burn + prepare labels)
3. Distribute the QGIS Screencasts CD on the FOSS4G 2006
4. Provide availability to download screencasts or the complete CD from
QGIS website

The most difficult and time-consuming task is the first one.
Here, I hope it's possible to find 5-15 QGIS users and developers
interested in delivering screencasts about various QGIS features. To
simplify this tasks, we could record QGIS User Guide sections as
screencasts.
If there would be 10-15 people and everyone could record 1 screencast,
then I think we have the whole CD ready :-)

The second task is much simplier.
If there would be >= 5 of us and everyone could burn 5-10 CDs, then we
could collect 100 CDs quite easily.
We'd also need someone to create and print nice CD labels :-)

Distribution is easy:
- there will be two QGIS workshops, so that should be a nice opportunity
to distribute CDs
-
- .... (I don't know about other QGIS activities, but it should not be a
problem to distribute CDs)

AFter FOSS4G, all screencasts may be put on the QGIS website or
Captorials.com to download.



There are 4-5 weeks left to FOSS4G, so I believe it's feasible.

I can promise to prepare 1-2 screencasts and to burn 50 CDs.
When we meet on FOSS4G, we would need an hour or two to put labels on CDs.

I'm looking forward to hear your comments!

p.s. I'm posting this proposal to following lists:
qgis-user@lists.qgis.org
qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org

Hi

QGIS supports two type of symbols:

1) Hard coded symbols (the 5 point symbols) which can have graduated  
colour sybology applied
2) SVG symbols which cant have ramped colours

Users can add svgs easily by simply dropping them in the appropriate  
folder.
Point symbols need to be added programmaticall

In the future it is my plan to define colour presets for svg symbols  
that will have ramping applied. So for example we would say that  
black would be replaced by the ramped colour.

There are lots of free svg symbols available a google search away....

Regards

Tim

Hi Mateusz

Some time ago I posted a howto on the wiki

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RecordingFlashMovies

Which explains how to create a screencast. Some people have added  
casts to qgis.org and these have proved to be very popular:

http://qgis.org/index.php? 
option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=89&Itemid=77

It would be great to have a well thought out series of these  
screencasts that show the range of activities that can be carried out  
in qgis. Hopefully the urls above will help folks interested in  
getting going with your idea.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <114DEF4A-893C-4D71-AE3C-0E20603DB95B@mrcc.com>

Greetings,
We have set up a group blog for QGIS at http://blog.qgis.org. Before  
you think "oh great, another website", we have a specific use in  
mind. We would like to step up the interaction between the  
development team and the community.

We invite QGIS users and developers who wish to blog about topics  
related to GIS (and QGIS in particular) to make use of the new blog.  
Some of the things we would like to see from developers are
* what you are working on now
* what plans you have
* howtos for using QGIS

 From the community we would love to see:
* how you are using QGIS
* how you solved a problem
* success stories
* howtos for using QGIS

Of course blogging on OS GIS in general is also appreciated. We  
aren't trying to duplicate what others are doing, but rather get more  
of the user and developer stories out there for others to benefit from.

If you don't want to blog, feel free to comment on the content others  
post. If you do wish to blog you need special privileges. Just send a  
message to me and I'll set you up in short order.

Thanks and we look forward to what you have to contribute.

Gary,

Does it mean the idea behing QGIS blog is similar to "planets" like
http://planet.ubuntulinux.org
http://planet.gnome.org/
etc. ?

Great idea!

As a stories template, I'd like to point on interesting thread from

OK, but what are those SVGs for if they can't be used as geometry symbols?

That would be nice feature for sure.

Tim,

Nice work!
Yesterday, I tried ScreenKast:

No, 'New' button must always be enabled  because you can add more

Well said. I think your theory has merit. I for one would like to see  
QGIS licensed such that proprietary extensions could be developed. My  
theory is that some (perhaps many) of these would ultimately find  
their way into the open source code base, thus enhancing QGIS for  
everyone. I suspect there are many organizations out there that would  
be more willing to choose an OS GIS if they were able to add their  
customizations and intellectual property without exposing it to their  
competitors. QGIS would benefit by more users, expanded community,  
and likely financial input that would benefit the OS side.

Alas now you know that I am not an OS / Free Software zealot -- just  
a person interested in advancing the state of the art of OS GIS.

Nice idea!
I can customize a livecd with a DE like XFCE (or anything you want, but this 
is fastest on livecd and Thunar it's so cool ;) ) and QGIS with sample data.
Then we can create an html page with the link of all the Screencast, and open 
it in firefox as soon as the livecd had loaded.

Let me know what you think.

Yes, that's my idea too to provide users with HTML page aggregating all
screencasts, also categorized in some way.


Call for QGIS Screencasts!

I'd like to call anyone - users and developers - who could record
screencast (one or more) to give a note. Thanks in advance!

Do you think it's a good idea to create wikipage on the QGIS Wiki
about Screencasts CD proposal?

On this wiki we could gather all information about the idea:
- list of screencasts proposals
- list of contributors + what subject they're preparing
- HOWTOs links

etc.?

Hi,

For all those who are looking for easy to install and use tool for
screencast recording, I'd like to recommend ScreenKast utility:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/screenkast
http://captorials.com/index.php?cmd=software

For Ubuntu, Debian and SuSE, there are packages available:
http://instrudeo.bpower2.com/packages/

Today, I played a bit with this tool and it's really cool :-)

I hope it will encourace people to try some screencasts recording.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Derived Area is calculated wrong
Message-ID: <44D8C95C.7040102@o2.pl>

Hi,

(I'm reposting this, as my first attempt was filtered out by anti-spam
and on the second attempt, forwarded by Tim, nobody replied.)

This is a serious issue. Is it a bug or user/setup problem?

There is a vector polygon Grass layer. It's area is, according to
'v.to.db option=area units=k', 32281.680484. Also d.what.vect reports
"area size: 32281680484.380993". These seem correct, as after
rasterising it in Grass at 10m resolution the raster non-null area
(r.stats -a) is very close: 32281681800.000000.

However, querying the same vector exported to shapefile (v.out.ogr
type=area) in QGIS 0.8 (current SVN) returns '(Derived) Area 32303.759
km2'. It's 22 km2 more!

Querying the polygon Grass vector itself in QGIS returns the same wrong
derived area too.

The more complicated shape, the bigger the difference.

Could somemebody investigate? The shapefile is attached.

Are there islands in the polygon? Can you check is island
presence could cause the error?

Hi.

There are tickets/bugs which I cannot reproduce and consequently I cannot
fix them. I would like to mark somehow such tickets in trac so that we know
the ticket was inspected by somebody and it can hardly be resolved.
How to do that?

No islands. The area is a plane, simple circle, which I created in Grass
buffering a point. See:

$ v.build full_circle2
Building topology ...
7 primitives registered
Building areas:  100%
1 areas built
1 isles built
Attaching islands:  100%
Attaching centroids:  100%
Topology was built.

With another, bigger and more complicated shape, I get a bigger
difference - of about 0.087%.

Besides, this is not the point how big the difference. There should be
no difference. This is GIS.

Hi,

I cannot compile ogr provider with cross compiler. Everything seems
to be the same as few moths ago when it was working, now I get this error
when dll should be created:

ogrprovider_la-qgsogrprovider.o(.text+0x5d99): In function

Please read the documentation for ld's --enable-auto-import for
details.
etc.

Do you have idea where is a problem?

Hi,

I think that it would be useful to have defined namespace QgsLogger
so that we could use
  using namespace QgsLogger;
and then debug() without QgsLogger:: prefix.
Anybody knows how to define it? I tried to add
namespace QgsLogger { } around QgsLogger class definition but it does
not compile.

Just as side note, 'using' directives are not recommended
in shared header files because it causes
pollution of global namespace.
(See "Characteristics of a Good Long-Term Solution" under
http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/053.htm)

If you would like to write less than that, you can put namespace alias
in header where QgsLogger is defined:


namespace log = QgsLogger;
// or even shorter
namespace w = QgsLogger;

Then you will be able to use

log::debug();
or
w::debug();

Hi all.
I noticed that in the trac we have several tickets opened on the same
general subject (loading shapefiles problems: #235, 200, 120, 115, 73).
This would be rather serious during normal use (but it does not happens
in our setting); perhaps it would be better to merge them into one
single ticket? I can do it, if you agree.

Hi Paolo

I think its better to keep them separate as they represent different
underlying issues (OS, QGIS version etc).

Thanks

Message-ID: <000001c6c1e4$04bfa2d0$9a01a8c0@mende>

Hello all,

I am new in QGIS. I have been tried to compile QGIS v.0.8 (I was getting
source codes from https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis SVN repository)
on Windows platform using MS Visual C++ 2005. In first time I have got lot
of compiler errors then I was getting Mr. Mateusz Loskot's help. But I have
still new compiler errors. Please look an attached compiler full log file
(20060817_1618_compiler-error-msg.txt). 

I have got strange error please look at attached "special_error.txt" file. 
-----------------------------
qgis_gui.lib(qgisiface.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
"public: virtual struct QMetaObject const * __thiscall
QgisIface::metaObject(void)const "
(?metaObject@QgisIface@@UBEPBUQMetaObject@@XZ)
-----------------------------

After that error I was investigating qgisiface.h, qgisiface.cpp,
qgisinterface.h and qgisinterface.cpp files. 
There have not QgisIface::metaObject(void)const, qt_metacast(char const *)
and qt_metacall(enum QMetaObject::Call,int,void * *) functions. 

Please help me, what's wrong in my compilation process? 

I hope that you will help to me.


Best regards,

Dear all,

I was trying running QGIS within --lang option on Windows platform. I was
typing following command in console:
	D:\custom_GIS\qgis.exe --lang de
	D:\custom_GIS\qgis.exe --lang ru
But I can not see correct localized QGIS. How can I use QGIS embedded ready
translation such as qgis_de.qm, qgis_ru.qm and etc... By the way QGIS's
shared things are located in correct path "D:\custom_GIS\share".

Please help to me, how I can solve my problem.


Thanks and best regards,

Hi,

I note that the code in qgis that processes the command line arguments is
surrounded by an #ifndef WIN32, so that under windows no command line
arguments are accepted. Is this intended behaviour?

hello everybody,
Currently i am trying to create a application which let me overlay( creation

For this purpose i am thinking of few steps:
1. Creating a new vector layer:
                  Issue: here issue is layer supports only either lineor
point or polygon but usually i want to have all of these available to me.
How i can sort out this issue?
2. Add projection information ( if this is independent of underlying map's
projection information)
3. Displaying it and editing it.

Any advices on how i can carry out this task more effectively is welcome.

regards

Yes, it is. But i think only with QGIS 0.8 preview, which can be obtained at 
http://download.qgis.org/qgis/.

This is the infamous -F and/or -framework option in .la file error.

Since libtool gives up without a useful explanation when it finds 
something unexpected in a .la file, perhaps it should be known as the 
"something unspeakable found in .la file" error. :)

I usually get this when I upgrade Qt and forget to edit or comment out 
the line beginning with "dependency_libs=" in libQtTest.la. Since the 
options propagate, you also have to delete libqgis_gui.la, 
libqgis_core.la and libqgis_raster.la after fixing libQtTest.la.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] custom projection definition
Message-ID: <20060823084140.GC23829@localdomain>

Hallo,

maybe i do something wrong, but:

I would like to define my custom projection "Krovak  S-JTSK" with
following parameters:

Name: sjtsk
Parameters: +proj=krovak +ellps=bessel +no_defs +towgs84=570.8,85.7,462.8,4.998,1.587,5.261,3.56

It is not possible to add custom projection to QGIS. When I click on the
"Save" button, nothing is saved.

when I try to add just something common:
Name: myproj
Parameters: +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84

It can not be saved either.

In sqlite:
sqlite> select * from vw_srs;
sqlite>

In the command line, only two lines appear:

QgsCustomProjectionDialog::getProjFromParameters()
QgsCustomProjectionDialog::getEllipseFromParameters()

And, I would say, the test does also not work, how expected:

I would say, that North and East are changed
and
when I try 

Parameters: +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84
North: 12
East: 24
the result is 
0.2084
0.4189

is it wrong, that I'm expecting "12 14" ?

echo "12 24" |cs2cs +proj=latlong +to +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84
12dE    24dN 0.000

??

short summary:
1) It is not possible to save custom projection
2) the "test" of custom projection does not work properly

qgis_unstable 0.8 fresh svn, build with dpkg-buildpackage on ubuntu 6.06

Thanks

Jachym

Dear Radim Blazek,

In first thanks a lot for your great article "BuildingWindowsBinaryOnLinux".


I am new in QGIS development. 

I want to write simple plug-in for my own purpose, therefore I need to
compile QGIS for Windows platform. In first time I was using Mateusz
Loskot's HOWTO (Building Quantum GIS with Visual C++ 2005). However I can
not compile latest QGIS source for myself. I have been getting lot of
compiler errors; I was so many times to trying compiling QGIS using Visual
C++ 2005 on the windows XP. Of course I my compilation progress is improved,
although still so many strange compiler errors alert to me.

After that I was decide to using yours HOWTO. 

Every thing is OK until GRASS compilation. In GRASS compilation process had
some compilation error. Please look at attached "error.log" file. I have
using GRASS 6.3 source from CVS repository which is noted in your HOWTO.
 
Then next step is "GDAL GRASS support" processing. This step is so buggy for
my compiling time. After I recompiling according your HOWTO then I had error
occurred please see it from attached file "gdal-winmake-error".

In finally I have compiling QGIS without-postgresql option (according
HOWTO); however I found many errors in SPIT plug-in compiling also
postgresql related things. Why it was occurs for me, I was specifying in
QGIS for without-postgresql. 

In the end please help me, what I will do for compiling QGIS within
PostgreSQL support, should I compile PostgreSQL from source distro? If yes
then which configure script and make util I have to use? Simple Linux
configure script or winconfigure within winmake and winmake install?

Thanks for reading my so long and so boring email.

I hope you will help to me; I am looking your reply.


Best regards,

Hi

There is no need to do so much work - we have made a re-useable cross
compilation environment in a chroot jail. It can be downloaded from
here:

Dear Gary Sherman,

Can you check http://gisalaska.com/torrents/mingw_chroot.tar.bz2 for

Hello everybody,
As against my previous approach, i followed a newer one.
Let user put/mark on canvas as QgsMapCanvasItem  and mouse interactivity
using QgsMapCanvasTool.
But i have some issue which i couldn't sort out.
a. When i click on canvas ,after loading plugin , point symbol donot apears
until i refesh.
Header file look like this:-
/*----------vp.h-------------*/
class vP:public QgsMapCanvasItem, public QgsMapTool, public QgisPlugin
{
  Q_OBJECT;
  public:
  vP(QgisApp * theApplication, QgisIface * theInterface);
  //! Destructor
  virtual ~vP();
    //! Mouse move event for overriding
    virtual void canvasMoveEvent(QMouseEvent * e) { }

    //! Mouse press event for overriding
    virtual void canvasPressEvent(QMouseEvent * e) { }

    //! Mouse release event for overriding
    virtual void canvasReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent * e);

     void drawShape(QPainter & p);

     void updatePixmap();

public slots:
  //! init the gui
  virtual void initGui();
  //! Show the dialog box
  void run();
  //! unload the plugin
  void unload();
  //! show the help document
  void help();

  //!draw a raster layer in the qui
  void drawRasterLayer(QString);
  //! Add a vector layer given vectorLayerPath, baseName, providerKey ("ogr"
or "postgres");
  void drawVectorLayer(QString,QString,QString);
  //!will receive signal pbnOk clicked
    void recvOkClicked();
private:
  int mPluginType;
  //! Pointer to our toolbar
  QToolBar *mToolBarPointer;
  //! Pionter to QGIS main application object
  QgisApp *mQGisApp;
  //! Pointer to the QGIS interface object
  QgisIface *mQGisIface;
  //!pointer to the qaction for this plugin
  QAction * mQActionPointer;
    //! container for storing location of elements, later will be made of
appropriate struct
    QList<float > elementList;

};

here is code for drawShape()
    [CODE]
  //!This will draw the elements on to canvas
void vP::drawShape(QPainter &p)
{
    double temp_x, temp_y;
    QgsPoint qPoint(0.0,0.0);
    QPoint cPoint(0,0);
    //loading image to pixmap which will be displayed on points
    QString myFileNameQString= "/home1/qgis/images/vP/hit.png";
    QPixmap myQPixmap;
    myQPixmap.load(myFileNameQString);

    //displaying it at position where the points are marked
    //currently drwing all points which are is in list but only point which
is added latest should be drawn
    QListIterator<float> listIterator(elementList);
    cout<<"\n";
    while(listIterator.hasNext())
    {    temp_x=listIterator.next();
        //cout<<"\t"<<temp_x<<" ";
        if(listIterator.hasNext())
        {    temp_y=listIterator.next(); //cout<<temp_y;
            qPoint.setX(temp_x);
            qPoint.setY(temp_y);
            cPoint=QgsMapCanvasItem::toCanvasCoords(qPoint);
            p.drawPixmap(cPoint.x(),cPoint.y(),myQPixmap);
            show();

        }
        cout<<"vp.cpp-205\t";
    }
    updateCanvas();

    //update();
    cout<<"vp.cpp-210\n";
 }
[/CODE]

I had observer that this function drawShape() is continuously being called.
I myself has not made any connection to it.

Code for canvasReleaseEvent() is :-
void vP::canvasReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent * e)
{
  QgsPoint point =
mQGisIface->getMapCanvas()->getCoordinateTransform()->toMapCoordinates(e->x(),
e->y());
if (e->button() == Qt::LeftButton)
  {
    show();//why here-find out priority@5
    //!make data available for storage
    cout<<"\nelement bein added "<<point.x()<<" "<<point.y()<<"vp.cpp -171";
    elementList.append(point.x());
    elementList.append(point.y());
  }
}

All advices are welcome. Also i keep stucking at such situations where i i
have to display on canvas through interactivity with user. Will anyone guide
me in improving here?
regards
quickNitin

GRASS is not obligatory, if you dont need GRASS you can compile
QGIS without GRASS support. The errors in error.log you can ignore,
those modules failed to compile but that is not important because
those modules are only few (not important) from hundreds of others
which compiled well.

The same as GRASS, you only need to do this if you want to display
GRASS rasters.

|  ../libgdal.a(cpl_vsil.o):cpl_vsil.cpp:(.text+0x401): undefined reference to
|  `_VSIInstallLargeFileHandler'

No idea, you need to find where VSIInstallLargeFileHandler is/should
be defined and then find why it is missing.

I have noticed the same, I also dont have postgres compiled.
It is bug in Makefile.win, I have fixed some of them but
then I get tired and simply commented those subdirs in
src/Makefile.win, this has to be fixed.

Here I cannot help, I dont have postgres compiled but it should be possible.
I think that Gary compiles with postgres.

i found what wrong i was doing. i was calling updateCanvas( ) inside
drawShape() function which in turn was resulting in call to drawShape().
Second, slot defining visibility rectangle was not connnected.

greetings,
With refrence to webpage http://grass.itc.it/platforms/grasshandheld.html,
there is a screenshot showing some very initial version of QGIS on some
handheld device.
Is somebody carrying out such work curently? or work on it has stopped. Can
i have access to previous work?

hello evrybody,
today i discovered sth lse is also going wrong with plugin. After using
plugin, displaying points,  whenever i start another tool which generate a
new mesage window( like measure line, measure areaa) it cleans the canvas
and shapes marked with plugin are gone.
I think are implemented to work this way. How can i avoid such behaviour?

The work does not continue we need something more systematic -
special dialogs for PDA, #ifdef PDA etc. and keep it all in  SVN
in sync with normal version.
What you see on the screenshot was normal version of QGIS with
resized some dialogs and compiled on Debian / IPAQ.

Thanks for the note.  Steve Halasz maintains the debian/ packaging  
stuff - I just wrote the build package script. I actually use  ubuntu  
so my copy of the debian/ dir is slightly forked to cope with  
different versions of gdal etc.  Regarding the gridmaker error I'm  
not sure why you are getting that. Perhaps Steve has some ideas -  
Steve? I dont have access to my linux box till monday, Ill try to  
build the packages then and see if I get the same problem.

The debian install instructions look ok - they do seem to assume you  
already have gcc etc set up on your system - which you obviously have.

Testing the package building process is already a great contribution!  
If you are looking for other things to do Ill be happy to point you  
in the right direction. Chiefly filing bugs on

https://svn.qgis.org/trac

Will be of the most use so we can get all the issues with the  
upcoming 0.8 release identified. If you are a coder, bug fixe patches  
will also be much appreciated.

Its no problem to write to me personally, though the developers  
mailing list is usually a better option given the shared brain power  
they offer...I forwarded this to the list for now...

Hi,
can you give me some hints how to create new icons?
Which application do you use for making icons on Linux?
How to make them? Vector pictures converted to rasters?

Thanks

Hi Radim

I have a template in SVN under qgis/images/themes/default/ 
icon_template22x22.xcf

There are various layers in there that may be useful. I often grab  
crystal icons as a basis to start making a new icon with too.

If you need any help, let me know I can whip some icons up for you....

Regards

Tim

It seems to be raster, do you work with rasters?

Do you know where original pictures in SVG format can be downloaded?
Here are only rasters:

Hi

Yes all the icons are rasters at the moment....I prefer GIMP to  
vector art apps....

Hi,
I have found strange thing, a pluging cannot be loaded on Windows
(QLibrary::load () fails with "Invalid access to memory location")
if it contains a class which inherits from QgsVectorLayer.
No problem if QgsVectorLayer is used as member.
On Linux everything works without problems.
Anybody has an explanation?

Hi

I wonder if its anything to do with the win dll boundary issue :

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460.aspx

But in this case it shouldnt be I think.....?

I assume Tim is right, however the article above does not
mention similar situation that likely occurs in QGIS/plugins on Windows.

Generally, inheriting from class in external DLL is a bad idea
on Windows, unless developer will promise that the base class
does not allocate anything and return it outside.
For example

// a.dll
struct B {};

struct A
{
   // Ownership transfered to the caller
   B* getB()
   {
      B* p = new B();
      return p;
   }
};

// c.dll
struct C : public A
{
   void foo()
   {

Although, I'm not sure if QgsVectorLayer does apply to this situation.
May be there are some resources allocated in constructor of the base
class, and then they cross DLL boundaries. That would be likely unsafe
too, on Windows.

But I think it may be necessary to track where the crash
occurs, to know what's the exact reason.

I've forgot to write about yet another possible problem.
If there are new virtual functions added one of classes from the
inheritance tree (accross DLL boundaries) but the plugin was build
with the older version, it may crash too.
Here is longer story about this issue:

Hi,
I dont think this is the case because I have compiled
everything with the same libraries and especially
it does not crash, it fails to load the library!
QLibrary.load() fails, that means before any piece of
my code is executed.
The class does not need to be used at all. It fails to load
the plugin if I compile into the plugin this class:

BiogeoSource::BiogeoSource ( QString n, QString p, QString l )
    : QgsVectorLayer ( n, p, l) {};
BiogeoSource::~BiogeoSource(){}

Message-ID: <20060828151145.0575b992@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear Devs,

building win-snapshots for QGIS-HEAD I like to add another target to
the Makefile.win, which copies the (binary) msys-files for the
GRASS-shell into the release-folder. This makes it easier to automate
the packaging process.

However, this applies to the mingw_chroot I am building.

Perhaps someone could add this t o SVN.

Cheers

Tim, thanks for your reply.  Another thing I tried with 
qgis_0.7.9+svn20060826 on Ubuntu Dapper:

~/src/qgis-unstable$ sudo ./doCheckInstall.sh

. . .

Cleaning up...OK

Bye.


Then I thought I would update:

neil@gandalf:~/src/qgis-unstable$ svn update
svn: Working copy '.' locked
svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks (type 'svn help cleanup' for details)
neil@gandalf:~/src/qgis-unstable$ svn status

?      nbest build notes
?      patch-stamp
?      doc-pak
   L    .
M      build_debian_package.sh
~      autom4te.cache
neil@gandalf:~/src/qgis-unstable$ svn cleanup
svn: 'autom4te.cache' is not a working copy directory


I only know enough about svn to be dangerous, so I looked through the 
docs and found out what '~' means, but couldn't see how to resolve it. 
The only thing I can think of is to rm -r and re-checkout.  What it is 
autom4te.cache and what should I have done about it?

Not giving up yet,

Neil

Hi,
it seems that main menu items on the left side (File, View)
are 'hidden/disabled' somehow so that it is impossible to
select them on Linux and Windows.
Does it work for you?

Does If the crash occurs on QLibrary::load() then I suppose
the BiogeoSource object is crated during "on DLL load"
and then QgsVectorLayer ctor is called too.
May be QString passed across DLL boundaries make troubles,
I don't know.

Sorry, I can't give any more details here.

qgis_0.7.9+svn20060828 builds nicely using ./doCheckInstall.sh but 
./build_debian_package still chokes on not finding gridmaker

Of course, now I notice an item for Ubuntu Dapper on the 0.8 Release 
download page.  Duh.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 0.8 release grass plugin and query builder issues
Message-ID: <44F3183D.7090605@speakeasy.net>

A couple of things that I notice while playing with my shiny new QGIS:

*  I notice that the GRASS plugin prompts you for GISBASE but won't 
allow selection of a directory.  It seems to work fine when I point it 
to /usr/lib/gras and hit cancel.


*  QGIS crashed when I tried to go into the GRASS editor:

No such file or directory: /driver/db/
error_routine (fatal = 0): Cannot open driver 'dbf'
Cannot open database /home/neil/gis/kb/ses/grass/ses/PERMANENT/dbf/ by 
driver dbf
mProjectionEnabled = 0
QgsGrassEdit::setCanvasPropmt
Segmentation fault

I noticed that the attributes for my GRASS layers were not coming across.


* The query builder button is greyed out for my vector layers, both 
GRASS and SHP.  Why wouldn't it be available?

These might be bugs, but since I'm not 100% sure if I compiled correctly 
I thought I would submit them to the group and see if others see them also.

Hi

For checkinstall to work it needs to be run as root since it actually
installs everything and then makes the package from the installed
binaries.

e.g.

sudo ./doCheckinstall.sh

Note that since Steve did the debian/ stuff I dont really maintain
that checkInstall script any more. It probably still works but I cant
verify that. I kind of left off using it because the debs it creates
dont do any dependency checking so they are only useful on a machine
where you have manually installed all the dependencies yourself.

Steve do you have anyidea about that grid plugin error?

Regards

Tim

Sorry I should have mentioned that I had made those in the first
place....though they need updating as they are a little stale now....

The query builder is currently only supported for PostGIS originated layers.

Not offhand. I'm pressed for time, so it's all I can do to get qgis
releases properly packaged for debian. The latest is the 0.8 preview
release, which I've just uploaded to the debian-gis repository:
http://pkg-grass.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/DebianGisRepository

All I can say is that the gridmaker binary is included in that package Ok.

If I get a chance I'll sync my latest debian control files to svn
HEAD. Perhaps that will help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt 4
Message-ID: <44F40D22.3060801@loskot.net>

Hi,

I'm forwarding announcement about new QT book:

Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt 4

<http://www.phptr.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0132055147>

This seems to be an interesting book for intermediate and advanced
programmers using QT 4 library. At the moment, it's only available
to download, but I think it's reasonable to wait for printed version
(preorders possible with discount:
http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0131879057)

I hope you'll not consider this e-mail as advertising of this book
from my side, since it shouldn't be consider as such.

Cheers

Obviously because GISBASE was not selected in previous step.
Which platform, compiled yourself? GISBASE should be compiled
into the plugin using --with-grass and you are only prompted for
GISBASE if it was removed.
What does it mean 'won't allow selection of a directory'?
Most probably the directory you selected is not GISBASE.
The dialog is checking for $GISBASE/etc/element_list.

The problem is that WMS provider gets the srs.db path
from static QgsApplication::srsDbFilePath() which is
inited in main(). WMS provider on Windows was built with staticaly
linked core library and so the path was incorrect.
Unfortunately if I used CORE_DLL the provider fails to load
(QLibrary::open). I found that this works:
  $(CORE_A) $(GUI_DLL)
Yes, strange because QgsApplication is in core library so it
should not work! Another strange thing is that OGR provider
loads if compiled with DLL. I have submitted to SVN but
it is not final solution.

Correction: WMS provider gets SRS via QgsSpatialRefSys
which is in gui lib, so it works as it should. Still no explanation
why it fails to load when compiled with core dll.

BTW, WMS should work? I cannot get anything displayed with
http://www.mpasol.it/cgi-bin/wmsdemo.php?request=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=WMS

Do you have some free WMS service which works?

Hi Mateusz

Thanks for this link! I?d be interested to get a copy, but there isnt
much info on the site - it would be nice to see a sample chapter to
get a feel for the writing style...

Its funny to see Bruce Peren?s name on a book about Qt4 since he cause
all that stink about only promoting gnome (and thus gtk) over kde for
Debian Common Core Alliance (which thankfully seems to faded into dust
now....).

Also I dont know if its been mentioned on this list but C++ GUI
Programming with Qt 4 (Paperback) by Jasmin Blanchette, Mark
Summerfield was recently announced too. Its available in German too
and possibly other languages.

http://www.amazon.com/C%2b%2b-GUI-Programming-Qt/dp/0131872494/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0/104-7072469-1535110?ie=UTF8

Yes, there is sample of CHAPTER 9 - QObject, on the Informit IT website:

I'd not expect it :-)
See paragraph at the end of this article:

http://www.newsforge.com/software/03/12/16/0029234.shtml

"In February, my book series will publish C++ GUI Programming with Qt,
the official Trolltech guide  to Qt 3.2, by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark
Summerfield. I have a minor financial interest in promoting Qt"

Though, I don't care about this political stuff
and only cow does not change its mind ;-)

besides, GNOME rulezzz ,-)

Thanks.

3 days ago I started my 14-days free trial of Safari
(O'Reilly/InformIT), and there are QT 3/4 books available to read
online. I found it helpful when working with PostgreSQL internals, for
example.

By the way, for those who are not convinced to read this chapter.
This chapter explains Composite Pattern based on QObject-based
types. I memorize there were some discussion a few months ago about map
composer/printing stuff and its design.
The Composite Pattern fits that problem pretty well.

I have successfully tried (even with the srs.db-error popping up in
win32) the WMS services from DEMIS or NASA Onearth:
	
	http://www.demis.nl/wms/wms.asp?
	http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi?


Perhaps they work for you?!

Thanks for finding the bug in linking the paths of the srs.db, even if
the reason is not explainable...

I will update my experimental win32-build.


Best regards
	
	Stephan

Hi

Since you seem to be looking at mingw debugging tools, another nice
tool is Dr MinGW (windows only). It replaces the standard windows
crash handler with one that will produce a backtrace for your app.

  http://jrfonseca.planetaclix.pt/projects/gnu-win32/software/drmingw/index.html

The actual Dr.Mingw installer is available at:

http://ufpr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/mingw-utils-0.2.tar.gz

Extract the above tarball into your c:\MinGW directory and then from a
dos command prompt do:

cd c:\mingw\bin
drmingw -i

The next time you program crashes chose the debug option on the crash
handler and then a stacktrace will be displayed for you.

Hi developers - how far are we from a release?

I see the bug queue has shrunk, although we still have a couple of  
major issues.

Translations need to be updated and the user manual needs to be  
reviewed and finalized. I also haven't got the context help completed  
for the dialog that are "wired" with a Help button.

I'd like to find a Python/MapServer expert to complete the MapServer  
export script to include in the release (any volunteers?).

There are still some cosmetic issues on the Mac.

What's the consensus? Can we release prior to FOSS4G which starts Sep  
12?

Thanks,
-gary

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer: Labels/rasters are not exported to SVG
Message-ID: <20060830092659.619c747f@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear developers,

I am in the position to search for a tool which can 'pimp' the maps
generated by QGIS. I thought about inkscape which has nice
vector-drawing capabilities.

When I export from Mapcomposer into SVG, the resulting map does not
look like I had them layouted in the Composer. 

Some of my remarks:
* Labels are not exported
* filling-styles are ignored
* Rasters are somewhat exported, but not shown in inkscape
* no text-elements

What would be really nice is that label- and general text-exort should
work. This would improve the usability of the SVG-output greatly.

Is there any chance to get (at least) some of the things done in one of
the next releases? I thought that the label-stuff worked in 0.7.9
(qt3-based), but I may be wrong.

Best regards

	Stephan

No, I don't think so. We have still 19 tickets opened. FOSS4G
should not force us to release a buggy version. We can release
preview 2. It is much better to here on the conference that
QGIS 0.8 stable was not yet released but 0.8 preview 2
works very well then that QGIS 0.8 is again buggy like 0.7 was
and it is better to wait at least for 0.8.5.
RC1 is probably better name then preview. Preview is something very
preliminary. I am sure many people will try the new version
of QGIS on the conference and would be bad advertisement
to see there crashing stable version.

Hi,

I'm still waiting for "Go!" to update polish translation
based on the final version of 0.8 release.

I just want to give a note, that I'm tracking the release process
and I'm ready to start and continue polish translation update work.

Cheers

Hi,

If there is any press release or common overview information
about QGIS, may be it's a good idea to put it here, in a list of GIS
viewers ;-)

Stephan,

Those problems with the svg export from qgis are caused by bugs and 
unimplemented features in the Qt4 code that qgis uses when exporting to 
svg. I recently tried to work-around some of them, particularly the lack 
of text labels, but had no success.

Currently, the users expectation of svg export is higher than we can 
provide. I am planning on adding something to qgis to make people aware 
of this until qt4 does svg better.

Regards

Gavin

This might be good. I will try to build todays qt4.2 snapshot from
trolltech and report back, if this solves anything with this.
