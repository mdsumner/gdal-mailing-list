If I go on this page:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap

I read:

Milestone: Version 1.0.3 - Closed tickets: 131 - Active tickets: 83

and, under:

"This is the third bugfix release in our stable version. We will release
when we have accumulated 50 or so bugfixes (unless there is a critical fix
that requires an earlier release. "

So we can except a 1.0.3 release?

Hi Martin.

It seems the QgsSearchString class isn't in PyQGIS. Can you add it, please?

Thanks in advance.

Thats a mistake the milestone should be open still as we have not
released 1.0.3 yet. After we are done with getting 1.2.0 out we will
start backporting any fixes we can to 1.0.3 and then do a release.

Thanks for pointing that out.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 1.2.0 'Daphnis' the
next in our development release series.

Our 'development' release series are provided to offer users a chance to
try out new features as they make their way into the code base. We will
not support these releases over a long term and they are aimed at people
who don't mind if the user interface changes from release to release. We
are dropping the term 'unstable' in favour of 'development' to label our
non-long term support releases since it creates the incorrect impression
that these releases are more crash prone. In reality the developer
releases contain many bug fixes that should improve stability over
previous releases.

Binary and source code packages are available at
http://qgis.org/en/download/current-software.html

A visual changelog for the release is available here:

http://blog.qgis.org/node/137

Along with the release of QGIS 1.2.0, the QGIS Community Team is hard at
work on an updated QGIS Users' Guide version 1.2. The guide will be
available in the near future - we will post announcements when it is
available.

QGIS is a completely volunteer driven project, and is the work of a
dedicated team of developers, documenters and supporters. We extend our
thanks and gratitude for the many, many hours people have contributed to
make this release happen.

If you would like to make a donation or sponsor our project, please
visit http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html . QGIS is Free software
and you are under no obligation to do so.

Happy QGIS'ing!

Hopefully you'll find help among the developers,
this is really a critical missing utility in QGIS.

This error only happens with the OSGEO4W installers and only for the more recent installers. I suspect that it is some component that I am downloading?that is causing it.

Hi Bob,

This might be a SIP 4.8 problem.  r11540 fixes it for me.  It also makes the
valueTool fly again.

Unfortunately it involves a slight API change in following signals:

QgsMapCanvas::xyCoordinates( const QgsPoint & );
QgsMapToolEmitPoint::canvasClicked( const QgsPoint &, Qt::MouseButton button );

The const qualifiers are new.  So the connect calls need to be updated (note:
connect returns false, when the connect fails).

Can this be fixed without changing the API?

I forgot something else:  this not only affected Windows - I was also able to
reproduce the problem on Linux (on Debian unstable, Qt 4.5.2, PyQt 4.5.1, SIP
4.8.1).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] providing old binary packages
Message-ID: <20090903095301.3fbf9f01@nature.localdomain>

Hi, 

looking at the software download page for the development versions, it seems
that all version 1.1 packages are missing, probably changed to version 1.2
and versions 0.9, 0.10 and 0.11 are still listed as well. 

http://www.qgis.org/en/download/current-software.html

Shouldn't we remove these older versions? I found that for several
distributions and platforms, older devel and stable packages are not
available anymore e.g. opensuse, Mac? Is this correct and how do we want to
proceed here? 

Regards,
 Otto

Old versions of my Mac binaries are still available, just not linked  
to, yet.  I have an old downloads page that I'm slowly filling in, but  
I haven't gotten to Qgis yet.

Yes that was probably a cut and paste error by me.

Funny I was thinking about this over the 1.2 release as well. I was
wondering if we couldnt make the download process simpler and have teh
current software page list only the most current dev release, the page
list the most current LTS packages and then an archive or similar page
listing older versions with a note saying that we dont guarantee if they
are still available.

However of course that means even more work (and I'd prefer to lean
towards making the release process simpler rather than more complex).
Ultimately I would like to automate this but until then I guess we
should just stick with how things are currently done and prune away dead
links as and when people bring them to our attention.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSX Snow Leopard update & notes
Message-ID: <779ADEEB-2127-4E54-87C6-ED57F64347FF@kyngchaos.com>

I updated the Xcode project to work with Snow Leopard.  That means  
adding a "snow" SDKSYS and working around some issues in Snow.

For all OSX versions, I removed the "native" build (SDKSYS not set).   
All compilation uses the system SDK that you are building for.

Also for all versions, I made Python and Expat defaults based on the  
SDKSYS.  They both will use system-provided versions by default, if  
available.


Some general Snow Leopard notes:

- the default GCC version is now 4.2.  This could be trouble if mixed  
with libraries compiled with 4.0 (ie Qt binaries).  At least Qgis  
didn't crash, I haven't tried using it yet.

- Qt 4.5 doesn't officially support Snow yet, but it seems to be  
working.  Every Qgis source compiled will spew a warning:

#warning "Support for this version of Mac OS X is still preliminary"

- SIP/PyQt need some fixes, but it's not difficult.  A big problem is  
that the Python executable is now 64bit (!), but Qt (standard) is  
still 32bit only, so you need to force it to run 32bits so that SIP  
and PyQt configuration and tools work properly. (ie pyuic4 is a shell  
script that runs the pyuic python script)  And the arch command is  
broken, so it's not simple.

When everything is working smoothly, I'll look into Qt Cocoa.

I have been using qt-cocoa, and there are some general issues with it,  
like the loss of text tags when hovering over items in the canvas  
legend. I cannot change text color for text labels in the composer,  
and probably more stuff along those lines.

Additionally, I cannot seem to get my python plugins working at this  
point. I have the python console, but the plugins are not functioning,  
despite updating my install_name_tool post-build stuff. This, I  
believe, relates back to the unincorporated patch in ticket 1658. I  
will try applying the patch and see if it helps.

Francesco,

You can see about geometry calculus from GEOS libray (http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), have bindings for python.

In Qgis see python plugins ftools, in ... /ftools/tools.

Motta,
Follow up questions:
1- can you create a new line layer that connects the existing point to
polygon/line layers?
2- can you specify the  connection type: point to perpendicular to the edge
of line/polygon layer or point to vertex?
3- can it be done without PostGIS?

cheers,

Hi Francesco,

In the Linear Reference plugin [1] (by Martin Dobias for Faunalia) I see
this kind of functions on geom.py file. There is Point and Line classes with
some useful methods. I think it can help you.

I guess we need a Mac developer that understands Qt.  I don't know if  
Tom has time to do a lot of work (if any) on this.

Are you building Qgis 64bit with Qt Cocoa?

The Xcode project gets all the install names right, it does the  
install_name_tool step.  I can look at those bugs and see what I can  
do.  The 4-way universal part of #1658 is invalid for the standard Qt,  
since it's not 64bit.  It's also invalid for a 32bit Cocoa build, so  
for now at least see if a 32bit Cocoa build works.

I think you might be correct. I know Tom has been exceptionally  
helpful in the past on these issues. (Yes, I'm hoping flattery may  
curry favor.)

Yes, I was able to apply the changes, although the diff did not match  
for one of the files. No change for the plugin functionality, so the  
part dealing with lib linking apparently is not working.

Regarding the xcode project, where is the install_name_tool step in  
the build process. I'm wondering if I can extrapolate the necessary  
steps from a file or output during the build.

Thanks,
John

... actually, it's automatic (just checked the details now).   
libqgis_core and libqgis_gui are compiled with the correct linking, so  
core.so and gui.so don't need "fixing".

The way cmake builds things is that libraries have linking to source  
paths. On install, install_name_tool is applied to all libraries and  
programs to "fix" paths.  I guess this is done to avoid accidental  
linking to older installed copies of libraries.  It doesn't happen in  
Qgis for the python modules because python compilation is not under  
cmake's control.

So, I haven't seen much of a concensus about whether to keep v1.0.3  
maintained.  I'm wondering how the organization of svn matters.  If I  
have a bug fix that I'd like to apply to a possible future 1.0.3, what  
do I apply it to?  I don't want to have to remember when a 1.0.3  
branch is created to apply the patch.

Thinking along the same organization as GRASS, I'd expect a 1.0.x  
branch where bug fixes are backported to, then a release is tagged off  
that.  It looks like tags were forgotten after 1.0 preview 2.

Apply it to the Version-1_0 branch.  That's what 1.0.3 will be branched from
when time comes.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly

disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Accessing GPS devices platform independently
Message-ID: <200909051435.00029.marco@hugis.net>

Hi devs

Is there a way to access the data from a GPS device (serial port or USB port) 
in a platform independent way? From what I have read, gpsd can be used on 
Linux but not on other platforms.

Is it necessary to directly parse the NMEA 0183 protocol on windows? I see 
there are some projects connecting gps devices and QGIS (QGIS track GPS, 
Quantum Navigator, QGIS mapper). Is there already some NMEA related code?

Thanks for any suggestion,
Marco

Hi

A generic / platform independent GPS tracking component would be a great
a addition to qgis core.

Hi Bob

Wow, that sounds good! Let us know when the plugin is available. I could have 
a look on the attribute problem (as long as the problem is in QGIS and not in 
OGR library).

I agree with Tim that it would be good to have a class for live GPS access in 
the core library. So probably we can port parts of the plugin to C++ later.

Regards,
Marco

Hey all,

I was wondering if it's possible to add a maximize button for the python
console in QGIS. I'm using 1.2.0 under ubuntu 9.4.
Another request, with the new python console, pressing enter returns a new
line; would it be possible to have a keyboard shortcut (ctrl + enter for
example) that executes the command ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] libgdal1-1.5.0-grass and the qgis grass plugin
Message-ID: <4AA7A04A.1080309@gmail.com>

At least on ubuntu jaunty, libgdal1-1.5.0-grass is automatically
installed by the qgis grass plugin (with Synaptic). So without 
libgdal1-1.5.0-grass, I
cannot use grass from within qgis 1.2.0. The funny thing is that
qgis actually requires libgdal1-1.6.0-grass also,
otherwise you get an error at displaying grass layers.

The problem is that the R packages rgdal and spgrass6
do not work properly if libgdal1-1.5.0-grass is presnt.

Is there any way of getting rid of libgdal1-1.5.0-grass
and still get the qgis grass plugin installed?

Thanks

Agus

Hopefully, but note that the (at least my) problem
is not with libgdal1-1.6.0-grass but with the fact that
the qgis grass plugin requires libgdal1-1.5.0-grass, so
you get libgdal1-1.5.0-grass automatically installed
when you install the qgis grass plugin, even if you are happy
with libgdal1-1.6.0-grass

Yesterday Alan Boudreault on the ubuntugis mailing list said it will
soon upgrade libgdal-grass package to 1.6.2. Hopefully this will resolve
(also) this issue.

Date: Wed, 09 Sep 2009 14:32:10 +0200

At least on ubuntu jaunty, libgdal1-1.5.0-grass is automatically
installed by the qgis grass plugin (with Synaptic). So without 
libgdal1-1.5.0-grass, I
cannot use grass from within qgis 1.2.0. The funny thing is that
qgis actually requires libgdal1-1.6.0-grass also,
otherwise you get an error at displaying grass layers.

The problem is that the R packages rgdal and spgrass6
do not work properly if libgdal1-1.5.0-grass is presnt.

Is there any way of getting rid of libgdal1-1.5.0-grass
and still get the qgis grass plugin installed?

Thanks

Agus

Hi All,

I am trying to programmaticly create a polygon shapefile from two separate
input shapefiles.  The first is a boundary polygon shapefile and the second
is a a polyline shapefile that contains a number of segments (could many)
that are spatially contained in the boundary polygon.  The polyline segments
either form closed areas or when connected end-to-end extend accross the
polygon. I want to use the polylines to essentially cut the polygon into
smaller polygons.  Does anyone have any suggestions where to start with this
problem.  My question may not be completely clear so I have uploaded an
example picture: http://www.flickr.com/photos/42311742@N02/3904105994/

Hi Matthew

For the polylines that cut the polygon, you could use 
QgsVectorLayer::splitFeatures (or on feature/geometry level 
QgsGeometry::splitGeometry
And for the features that are contained in the polygons, there is 
QgsVectorLayer::addRing.

Hope it helps,
Marco

Hi Marco,

Thanks for your thoughts.  I will have a look at your suggestions.  It looks
like they are definitely the direction that I need to go.

I anticipate I will have some difficulty because, due to the way the line
segments are generated, each polyline segment is a separate feature and they
are in no particular order.  It looks like maybe the first step I will have
to do is create a number of continuous polylines from the segments, then use
the methods you (and Carson in an email that missed the list) suggested.
Does that sound correct?  At that point I could determine whether I should
use splitFeatures or addRing.

Thanks again for your input.

Matt

Hi All


Recently some important bug fixes that have been added to resolve issues
with the OSM plugin under windows and with vector clipping issues. Also
I believe Martin is in Peru (ola Martin!) so is probably unlikely to be
planning to commit his symbology changes in the next week or two. I
would like to thus put out a quick release of 1.3 (i.e. no feature
freeze, no translation stage etc) to get those fixes out into the wild.

I prefer to release it as 1.3 since there are also new features in trunk
like Marcos very excellent terrain modelling plugin. The alternative is
to backport the fixes to release as 1.2.1 but since the same amount of
work is required, I prefer to do 1.3.

My suggestion is this that once the win rendering OSM fixes have been
tested and clipping issues have been tested (hopefully tomorrow), we
immediately branch for 1.3 and call for packaging. I will do the
preparation for branching over the weekend.

Any objections / flames / flowers?

Regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ogr2layers plugin
Message-ID: <1252657712.3948.26.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

once there was a site dedicated to a nice qgis python plugin (that
worked on qgis 0.9/0.10) that made easy produce openlayers snippets to
add to a web page.

The site no longer works/exist ( http://www.ogr2layers.org ) and every
attempt to contact the authors (asking to port it on qgis 1.x) had no
success.

I would be nice to have it back. It was released under GPL 2, so maybe
someone wants to have a look at the code and make it available for qgis
again. The code is attached to this e-mail.


Cheers

Hi,

well, the plugin worked fair enough. Maybe the lack of time of the
developer and the fact it was made as "test", plan in favor of a fork or
at least a collaboration with someone interested helping developing this
nice tool.

Can I say my word of a non-qgis-developer?

I compiled latest QGIS trunk for days and it works very well on my Ubuntu
64bit system.

I therefore agree to your proposal.

Thanks,
but there is a source of confusions here:

The left menu in the web page mentions "Plugins"
but then

http://www.qgis.org/en/download/plugins.html
or
http://pyqgis.org/repo/contributed

only mention "python plugins", which make the reader
think that there are only python plugins. 
Why are C++ plugins not listed somewhere?
A while ago I proposed reserving the term plugin to the
python plugins and use another term for the C++ plugins,
(i.e., "C complements") in order to avoid this sort
of confusions.

Anyway, how could I reach the author of the
GPS tools (note that I'm using the name that
is used in the Qgis menu) or his/her web page?
Are there no web pages for the C++ plgins? Most
python plugins do have a web page, why not
the C++ plugins?

Message-ID: <4AAA1ED1.2070506@gmail.com>

After upgrading to QGIS 1.2.0.2~jaunty, the python grass
plugin still installs libgdal1-1.5.0 (+ grass 6.4.0~rc5-2~jaunty)
and QGIS crashes upon start up with message:
"Uncatched fatal GRASS error. Incompatible library version for module.
You need to rebuild GRASS or untangle multiple installations"

Removing libgdal1-1.6.0  does not solve the problem
Removing libgdal1-1.5.0  (now you can do it without automatic uninstal
of the grass plugin) and installing libgdal1-1.6.0  does not solve the 
problem either.

Grass runs fine independently in all cases.
Qgis runs fine without the grass plugin

Removing libgdal1-1.6.0  does not solve the problem
Removing libgdal1-1.5.0  (now you can do it without automatic uninstal
of the grass plugin) and installing libgdal1-1.6.0  does not solve the 
problem either.

Grass runs fine independently in all cases.
Qgis runs fine without the grass plugin

Hi Augustin,
make a purge before reinstalling qgis, and all should be ok (sudo apt-get purge 
qgis*)

I've done:

sudo apt-get remove qgis
sudo apt-get purge
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
sudo apt-get install qgis
sudo apt-get purge

Same problem at qgis startup.

Qgis starts if I do:

Can you use any GRASS layers from GDAL?   The GRASS plugin for GDAL might need
a rebuild.  Perhaps the old plugins don't work with the new GRASS.

As far a QGIS is concerned I don't see a direct dependency to gdal 1.5
anywhere in the packages.

The problem here is that QGIS GRASS plugin justs expects GDAL to have GRASS
plugins, but doesn't directly link with them (which would produce a specific
dependency automatically).

The dependency to libgdal1-*-grass is just there to make sure GDAL has GRASS
plugins, but that assumes that there is only one set of plugins available.  If
the latter is not the case apt might choose to install libgdal1-1.5.0-grass
(and it's dependencies) over libgdal1-1.6.0-grass.

I don't known how to express a dependency that would deal with this
automatically (and would work with all repositories).  Perhaps simply changing
the order is enough.

A workaround is to install libgdal1-1.6.0-grass beforehand - obviously that
doesn't help with the crash if the GRASS plugins for GDAL don't currently work
at all.

This is what I've tried now (not having the qgis grass plugin installed):

sudo apt-get remove libgdal1-1.5.0
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get install libgdal1-1.6.0
sudo apt-get install grass
grass -tcltk

and

In grass
r.in.gdal -o 
input=/media/Transcend/ANYELLA/catuav20090730/tif/SDIM0178.tif 
output=delmetif

worked fine. Is this a sufficient test for "Can you use any GRASS layers 
from GDAL? "
If not, tell me which one would be more appropriate.

Now, if I try:
$ sudo apt-get install qgis-plugin-grass
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree      
Reading state information... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
  libgdal1-1.5.0 libgdal1-1.5.0-grass qgis-plugin-grass-common
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  libgdal1-1.5.0 libgdal1-1.5.0-grass qgis-plugin-grass
  qgis-plugin-grass-common

Need to get 0B/9986kB of archives.
After this operation, 19.4MB of additional disk space will be used.

Abort.

So I do not see the workaround, how can I install qgis-plugin-grass
and not libgdal1-1.5.0-grass ?

The only thing I can do is removing
libgdal1-1.5.0-grass after installing qgis-plugin-grass, but
this does not seem to work...

(how can I list all items related to qgis and grass using apt?)

That's the wrong direction.    You need to access GRASS from GDAL not vice
versa.

gdalinfo $HOME/grass/spearfish60/PERMANENT/cellhd/elevation.10m

That's strange.  Try

 apt-cache rdepends libgdal1-1.5.0

to see what depends on libgdal1-1.5.0.  There shouldn't be anything qgis or
grass related except for libgdal1-1.5.0-grass.

And try

 apt-cache depends qgis-plugin-grass

to see what qgis-plugin-grass depends on.  There should only be the dependency
to one of the libgdal1-*-grass packages - and that should be satisfiable by
installing libgdal1-1.6.0-grass.

Hi,

seems are available the grass palettes that are associated to the "type

Any idea how/if them can be easily added to the module in the qgis grass

Hi Tim

+1 for making a 1.3 release soon.

I have another plugin that I'd like to commit. It calculates simple raster 
statistics for polygons (similar to v.rast.stats, only a bit quicker). When is 
the latest time to commit for 1.3 branch?

Does gdalinfo still crash when you remove libgdal1-1.6.0-grass?  If it doesn't,
then that narrows it down to the gdal grass plugin.

Hi Tim.

Do you remember the issue related to the about dialog and the contributors

Should I open a new ticket on QGis trac?

I think the problem is in gdal:

Yes.  The gdal grass plugin needed and rebuild after GRASS was updated.
Alan just took care about that.  Another upgrade should fix it.

Which grass is that (apt-cache policy grass)?

That's what triggers the dependency to gdal 1.5. The ubuntugis jaunty grass
depends on libgdal1-1.6.0.  So your grass must be from a different repository.

No, that's an "or".  So any grass gdal plugin will fullfil the dependency.

I maintain my packages for internal use; those on debian.gfoss.it are meant for
the public. The main diff, however, is the availability for different platform
(hw & distro).
All the best.

Hi Tim

Thinking again about the mentioned raster statistics plugin, it is probably 
better to include it after 1.3 because it is not very well tested.
So no need to wait for me to branch 1.3 release.

Regards,
Marco

grass:

      6.2.3-2.1 0
         500 http://archive.ubuntu.com jaunty/universe Packages

The ppa.launchpad.net repositories I have in sources.list  are:

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu jaunty main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu jaunty main

is the grass 6.2.3-2.1 0 from archive.ubuntu.com causing problems?
Is there any way to specify the actual repository in case a package
is available in more than one repository?

J?rgen,
I've ugraded to qgis 1.2.0-2~jaunty1build1
and ligdal1-1.6.0-grass 1.6.0-3~jaunty1

When I install the qgis-plugin-grass, ligdal1-1.5.0-grass
is no longer installed and qgis and grass both seem to work fine.
gdalinfo works for grass layers now:

$ gdalinfo 
/media/Transcend/MONTSENY2008/Carlos_Montseny/GrassData/GrassData/carlos/A_TOTAL/cellhd/delmetif.blue
Driver: GRASS/GRASS Database Rasters (5.7+)
Files: 
/media/Transcend/MONTSENY2008/Carlos_Montseny/GrassData/GrassData/carlos/A_TOTAL/cellhd/delmetif.blue
Size is 4573, 3048
etc

Thanks a lot for your help and please transmit my gratitude to Alan.

Nope, I was probably wrong.

The package from archive is considered in apt-get rdepends, although it
wouldn't be installed.   So that doesn't tell us which actually is the package
that triggers the dependency.

It might still be the or dependency in qgis-plugin-grass, if the dependencies
are processed in order and libgdal1-1.6.0-grass is not installed already. I
reversed the dependencies for 1.3.0.

BTW dpkg -l libgdal1-1.5.0-grass to check whether or not the package is
installed.

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

- --- Note to casual readers --- Please do not pre-announce this release -
give the packagers and release team a chance to do their thing so that
people hearing about the release have a fair chance of finding a
package, reading all our press material etc. --- End note ---

Today I have branched QGIS 1.3.0 'Mimas' for release. This release is
faster than our normal releases due to some critical bugs that were
fixed. It would be great if you can assist by making packages for your
preferred platform. The branch can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_3_0 qgis-1_3_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.3.0.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.3.0.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks.

If you make a package please be so kind as to send me an email with
details of where I can download the package. Please make sure the
package is wgettable since I do not have the bandwidth to first download
all packages to my home pc and then up again to the download server.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros please
let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.

SVN (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any major
code changes.


The timeline for our future releases is, as always, available here:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap



Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual changelog,
press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will send you an
email when the packages are ready and you can start broadcasting
announcements.

Best regards

Hi!

I have a nmea file that I can convert to gpx using gpsbabel with no problem:
gpsbabel -i nmea -f GPS_20090730_055859.log -o gpx -F GPS_20090730_055859.gpx

and the gpx file works fine in QGIS.

Nevertheless, I cannot read and convert the nmea file to gpx using the gps
plugin in qgis. I select the file and nmea format, but the file
does not get selected in the menu. While using gpsbabel is fine for me, using
the gps tools would be a lot better for students.
Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug? I can provide
the nmea file if required, of course.

Thanks

Agus

Message-ID: <31f1d37d0909130920k357b08f2w820e41afdb4f6b89@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,I've installed Qgs 1.2.0 but when I try to a load a plugin which import
psycopg2, python returns this message:

    from psycopg2 import *
  File
"/Applications/Qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/psycopg2/__init__.py",
line 56, in
    from psycopg2 import tz
ImportError: cannot import name tz

I've try on my IDLE to import this module and all run correctly. Probably
isn't embedded into psycopg2 that is present in Qgis?

Thanks a lot

It's there, so maybe there's something I missed in the environment  
setup.  Which plugin are you trying to load?

I'm having other problems with Qgis and psycopg (separately) on Snow  
Leopard, but I'll see if I can make sure it's working for the 1.3  
release.

Hi all.
If I load a virtual raster (BW, TIFF) and I apply full transparency to value 0 (to remove collars),
the areas=0 remain white. If I do the same to individual TIFFs, the correctly become transparent: a
bug, or a limitation of the VRT format?
Thanks.

Using ubuntu jaunty, Value tool does not work with
latest 1.3.0 from the ubuntugis repository. No error, just
does not print the raster values.
This is a very important tool, displaying raster values is essential.
Any help?
Thanks

Probably there is the same error with the Scattergram and the Profile plugins? 
I've noticed Jaunty had no appriopriate version of the PyQwt5 module, but 
didn't check it last time...

Your Qt is probably too old.  I had the same problem when building for ubuntu
hardy.   It's fixed in r11649 by removing
src/plugins/raster_terrain_analysis/qgsrasterterrainanalysisdialogbase.h and
src/plugins/raster_terrain_analysis/ui_qgsrasterterrainanalysisdialogbase.h.

Matt,

I see your picture and my idea are same operations:

1) Split:
Create polygons from layer polygon(source) with polylines(cut).
Polygon data -> Boundary Shapefile
Cut data  -> Polylines segment (only two segments in picture showed) * 
these lines cross or touch line boundary of polygon
Result -> three Polygons

2) Make polygon from polyline closed:
Polyline -> Polylines segment (only closed)
Result -> Polygon

3) Union:
Polygon -> polygon from result first item
Polygon -> polygon from result second  item
Result -> All polygon

Strategy:
1) Separate type polylines: Closed (A) and not Closed(B)
2) Make polygon from A
3) Split polygon(big polygon) with B
4) Union result item 2 with result item 3.

Luiz,

Thanks for your thoughts.  I agree with your approach for the most part.  I
think that the difficulty for me will be with the implementation and
achieving it programmaticlly.

I should have been more specific about the picture that I shared.  When I
say segment I am referring to each individual single straight section (i.e.
two points) so each of the polylines that you are referring to is actually
many individual segments.  That doesn't really change the approach but adds
an extra step.  Basically the polylines need to be "dissolved" first.  Is
there an existing function to acheive this?  Also, is there an enexisting
function to union polygons programaticlly?

Matt

You will likely need to do this yourself by finding segments that share a
node, and creating a single line from all the associated QgsPoints.

Certainly, check out QgsGeometry.combine() in the docs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help needed to call grass modules from inside QGIS
	and Python Plugin
Message-ID: <78e951a60909150336x229e1bceq47149fa647629645@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Is there a way to pass some arguments automatically to the grass mapcalc
function, from inside QGIS, through Python dialog boxes?
Like I get some inputs from user through python plugin dialog box and I want
to automatically call mapcalc module and pass on the arguments / expression
to it.

I am using Python 2.5, grass 6.3 and windows

I am posting the same question in the QGIS forum.
Thank you in advance.


With Regards,
Bishwarup

Paolo,

I cannot think of any reason off the top of my head why there would be a 
difference, so submit it as a bug if you have not already. It may just 
be a double comparison problem in the transparency class as the data 
come out of gdal as floats -- I recently fixed a similar issue with the 
no-data values in the histogram display.

Also if you could, can you provide a little more detail on your virtual 
raster? Or feel free to just send me the .vrt file off list if you like.

I'll send it - do you also need the original rasters?
All the best, and thanks for looking into this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Value Tool does not work on 1.3.0
Message-ID: <4AAFBCFF.2090106@gmail.com>

(This message was sent through Nabble also but I've got a note stating 
tha was
not distributed. Sorry if it is finally duplicated)

This does not seem to be the problem, as Value tool
does not work on intrepid either (I'm using 1.3.0.1~intrepid3)
On intrepid, the graphic window draws the axes but not the line
and both Profile and Scattergram work fine. But the value tool
does not print or plot the values.

On jaunty, the graphic window complains about qwt. Have
not tested Profile and Scattergram (will do it in the evening). And
value tool does not print the values.

So it seems there are 2 problems here, the most important one being
the one making value tool not printing the values.

BTW, I think that such a fundamental information as the raster value 
should be
displayed on the bottom, just besides the position information. In some
packages (i,e, TNTmips) you see both the actual raster values (up to 3) and
the RGB of the color displayed (which do not necessarily match). Then,
an additional tool such as the current Value tool would provide additional
extended information.

Anyway, the urgent thing now is getting the value tool back working!

    Probably there is the same error with the Scattergram and the
    Profile plugins?
    I've noticed Jaunty had no appriopriate version of the PyQwt5
    module, but
    didn't check it last time...

 I've just had a nose at the Value Tool code and I think I've solved it..

 Edit valuewidget.py and change the two instances of:
SIGNAL("xyCoordinates(QgsPoint &)") to

SIGNAL("xyCoordinates(const QgsPoint &)")

 - it's just a case of adding 'const' before QgsPoint....

 It looks like the signal definition changed.

Yes!

Thanks a lot.

On jaunty, the graph does not work because of the qwt5 problem,
same for Scattergram and Profile, but in these two cases the installer warns
the user and he/she can uninstall.

I have a python-qwt5-qwt4 package in Synaptic, but requires
an older python (<2.6) and I have 2.6.2

Great.
Barry, could you update the plugin on the repo?
Could other plugins be affected too?

well, there are at least other plugins (I can make a list if necessary)
that need a particular dependency that requires python <2.6, but under
the latest ubuntu releases > 2.6 is installed.

 I don't have write permission on the repo - what do you think I am, a
developer? :)

> Could other plugins be affected too?

 grepping the plugins I have installed at the moment doesn't show any
use of that signal except in the ValueTool.

do not know if you can update an existing plugin uploaded by someone else - just test!

Hi all.
Linux has been ported on Trimble hardware:
http://developer.sdgsystems.com/nomad/updates/NomadQtopiaGuide.pdf
http://developer.sdgsystems.com/nomad/updates/NomadReleaseNotes.pdf
http://www.sdgsystems.com/download/datasheets/NomadLinuxWeb.pdf
Anyone interested in/planning to port a reduced QGIS to it?
Seems feasible, and would fill up a gap in free GIS.
Thanks Gmanghi for pointing this out.
All the best.

Thank you everyone for your help.  I really appreciate it as I am trying to
learn the QGIS API and C++.  I think that I have a solid plan to achieve my
goal now.  However, I seem to be stuck on something that I think should be
simple, looping through the points of a QgsPolyline.  If I iterate through
the Polylines and print out the point coordinates using ->at(int).x() I can
print out x1, y1, x2, and y2 with out problems.  But, if I try to iterate
through the points of the polyline and print out the coordinates, I get x1,
y1 and then a bunch of junk values for the first 3 polylines and then
eventually it ends unexpectedly.  Below is the code I am trying to use.

 //now iterate through each polyline feature

while (mypPolylineLayer->nextFeature(currentPolylineFeat))

{

qDebug("feature = %i",f);

++f;


 //get point geometry for current feature

QgsGeometry * currentPolylineGeom = currentPolylineFeat.geometry();

QgsPolyline * currentPolyline;

currentPolyline = &currentPolylineGeom->asPolyline();

 //this part works

qDebug() << "x1 = " << currentPolyline->at(0).x();

qDebug() << "y1 = " << currentPolyline->at(0).y();

qDebug() << "x2 = " << currentPolyline->at(1).x();

qDebug() << "y2 = " << currentPolyline->at(1).y();


 QgsPolyline::const_iterator it = currentPolyline->constBegin();

for(; it != currentPolyline->constEnd(); ++it)

{

//this part doesn't

qDebug() << "x = " << (*it).x();

qDebug() << "y = " << (*it).y();

}

}

Update:  So I thought that QgsPolyline->at(int).x() and
QgsPolyline->at(int).y() methods were working but upon further
investigation, they aren't working either.  It only returns the correct x
value for x1.  All of the other values are very small i.e. 1e-308

Once you install (1.3.0.1 jaunty)  plugin BuildVRT you get

"The plugin seems to have been installed but I don't know where. 
Probably the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.

Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find 
the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It 
also means that I won't be able to determine if this plugin is installed 
and inform you about available updates. However the plugin may work. 
Please contact the plugin author and submit this issue."
I remember having seen this problem with another plugin few weeks ago.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Suggestions: Save Project Prop.,
 default directories, folder for shp files
Message-ID: <4AB2293B.1040201@gmail.com>

Hi!

Three suggestions:

1. It would be useful being able to save the settings
in Project Properties as default for the next
time Project Properties have to be set.

2. Also, across all qgis and plugins, opening by
default the last directory would be useful (or at least
being able to set that behavior as default option in
Options)

3. Finally, some tools create a folder for the set of files
of a shp layer. I think this is useful ans should be
done in all cases.

Thanks for your attention.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python console issues
Message-ID: <4787348E-750C-48E0-B982-9EF88182E1E4@kyngchaos.com>

I was trying to figure out a python extension issue with a bundled  
module on OSX, and wanted to see what the sys.path was as Qgis sees it  
(Qgis 1.3).  I only get errors in the python console.

import sys
sys.path

just echos the commands in the output.  'print sys.path' does give me  
the sys.path in the output.

In previous versions (1.1? 1.0), and in a Terminal python session, you  
don't need to explicitly print output.


Also, <return> doesn't execute the python any more, but allows me to  
type multiline commands, yet it's all just run together as a single  
line command (like the python interpreter in a terminal does).

It breaks compability, but you could connect to the old signal when connecting
to the new signal fails.

Message-ID: <4AB340CF.6030203@gmail.com>

Hi,

According to Synaptic, Grass 6.4.0~rc5-3~intrepid1 is available for 
installation
(I guess from the ubuntugis repository, as this is the only one
I have selected in which grass and qgis are available) but
selecting it for upgrade would uninstal
libgdal1-1.6.0~grass
qgis-plugin-grass
qgis-plugin-grass-common

These 3 items are not selected for upgrade.

I think the same is true for jaunty, can confirm this evening.

Might it be that libgdal-grass-1.6.2.3~intrepid1 is not selected
by Synaptic because labeled "lpa" in the repository?

Thanks

Agus

libgdal-grass just became available for upgrading, I did
and then upgraded grass to 6.4.0, not being required
to uninstal anything.

The qgis grass plugin works fine with this grass version
(as far as I can tell by now)

 But Qt doesn't seem to give you any warning or failure if the signal
isn't valid. I think you'd have to check for the Qgis version and use
the 'const' version of the signal if the version is after whichever
version of Qgis made the change.

I prefer the files to go into the directory I specify, not a subdir. I
believe the behaviour is that if you specify a file name with .shp
suffix, it will create files in the current dir, if you leave of the
.shp it creates a dir with shapefiles in it. This seems like its already
ideal to me...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Domains
Message-ID: <f0f9bf090909180443y2c546864lc8d7d9fd72ca397b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,
I was asked about QGIS and field domains and I began to search for some
answers. As far as I could see, QGIS have domain support and one can set
these domains. Is there a way to set QGIS to search the domains from a table
or file? (like doing a join in a domain table).
The purpose of this is that ESRI PGeo comes with the gdb_codeddomains inside
it's own dataset, and one could read these data and set as comboboxes in
qgis. When talking about SpatiaLite, Postgis and Shapefiles, we could use
domain tables to allow the user to set the attributes from these lists
rather than setting numbers like 0, 1, 2.
I was thinking about writing a plugin to read the parameters from a
nonspatial table and set the domains using QgsVectorLayer::setEditType *
ValueMap*, but I think it's an odd approach for this problem.
Does anyone have experience with this and can shead a light on how it would
be easier to the user to see these domains? The main difference from PGeo is
that we don't have a fixed domain table so I think it should be flexible
enough to read the domains from tables from any dataset qgis suport.
Maur?cio de Paulo.

Message-ID: <e17134bc0909181318h2d260848uc8ccd68839411292@mail.gmail.com>

Hello qgis developers,

I was looking for a way to compute a shaded relief map from a DEM
without GRASS, and proceeded to use numpy as it was suggested on the
rasterlang plugin web page. After fiddling with the python console in
Qgis, I decided to tackle a plugin and it turned out to be tractable
after getting over all of the windowing code and learning designer. I
send a version of the plugin to Barry Rowlingson because I reuse his
layerAsArray and writeGeoTiff rasterlang functions and he suggested
some improvements. Since the shader plugin is in a usable form now, I
went ahead and made it available on the pyqgis.org repository as
shadedrelief.zip. Please feel free to test it and improve on it.

Apologies for the coding style, this is my first python experiment.

Right now, it would be nice to add a little preview in the dialog to
see the effect of the parameters on the shading. I can see that I
could take a scaled down copy of the array, apply the shading (would
be quick on a 100x100 image), and display that. Presumably on a pixmap
Qlabel, and I found a code fragment which converts a numpy array to a
Qimage, so no file IO would be necessary.

What would be hard for me is to make that work nicely. I envision each
change in the parameters triggers an update of the preview, or to have
a dedicated update preview button. Perhaps this means that the UI is
not a Qdialog anymore. And it presumably requires a Qaction which is
tied to an update function. I would also need to put the shading
itself into a function.

I also would need to load the layer before the ok clicking, presumably
when the dialog is shown or initialized. Hopefully the update would be
fast. Looking at the rastercatalog plugin for its raster previews I
see that it uses threads to generate the previews. Maybe this would be
required here as well.

All this overwhelms my python knowledge and curiosity by a significant
margin at this point. Any pointers or tips welcome,

Andreas

Sorry, but connect() returns whether or not the connect was successful.  See

I suspect (and this is pure speculation) it's the interpreted dynamic
nature of python here. In C++ I think that Qt's moc knows all the
signals at compile-time, since they are declared. With python,
everything is dynamic, and so you could be connecting to a signal on a
python object that doesn't exist yet...

hm, looks like that's a bug.  [1] also states that it should return true on
success only.  But the can verify that it doesn't in PyQt 4.5.2 too.

So connecting both signals should probably still work.

 Maybe Qt does, but PyQt doesnt :) If I connect to a non-existent
signal I get True returned. Stick this in a Qgis Python console:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
def foo():   return
z = QObject.connect(iface,SIGNAL("fnord()"),foo)
print z

This is on Qgis 1.3.0, Qt is 4.3.4 from qVersion(). I've found someone
getting an unknown signal error in PyQt but that message was from 2003
and looked like Qt3.

I just tried your plugin out (I've been waiting for this!) and it worked
great. It would be a great addition to the qgis analysis lib if ever you
felt motivated to rewrite it in c++!

In the mean time here are two suggestions:

 -   let the user choose which layer to use from the list of already
loaded layers rather than just assuming the active layer is the one to
be used
 -  preserve no data values from the original dem.


Thanks for writing this!

Tim

Since my c++ knowledge is limited to common sense, my invitation for a
rewrite goes out to any motivated qgis developer :)

I actually had thought about that a bit but decided that I want to
keep the interface minimalistic. The list provided by the main window
looks good to me. What I can see is a "Apply" button which does not
close the plugin. Not sure how to implement that.

> ?- ?preserve no data values from the original dem.

That is a good idea and maybe not too hard. numpy has a notion of
masked arrays which could come in handy.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 1.3.0 'Mimas', the
next in our development release series.

Our 'development' release series are provided to offer users a chance to
try out new features as they make their way into the code base. We will
not support these releases over a long term and they are aimed at people
who don't mind if the user interface changes from release to release. We
are dropping the term 'unstable' in favour of 'development' to label our
non-long term support releases since the 'unstable' moniker creates the
incorrect impression that these releases are more crash prone. In
reality the developer releases contain many bug fixes that should
improve stability over previous releases.

Hi Mauricio

I hope to understand your question correctly. You are reffering to the use of 
domain type constraints to handle enumeration types, right?

QGIS supports constrains on domain types in postgres. The constraint needs to 
be defined in the form 'VALUE in ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')'. If so, the postgres 
provider detects it and offers those values as possible enum types for a field. 
If you then choose 'enumeration' as edit types, QGIS offers those in the 
attribute dialog when editing. This is a good way to work with enumeration 
types in postgres because the standart postgres enum type cannot be changed 
once in use (but nevertheless, QGIS supports also the normal enum type of 
postgres).

Such an approach could also be implemented for other data providers (e.g. 
spatialite). Just implement the method QgsVectorDataProvider::enumValues 
accordingly.

Regards,
Marco

William usually puts up the release when my release announcement goes
out. William can you confirm if the new release is available?

Barend we can always use help on the release team if you would like
pitch in to improve QA when we do a release it would be most
appreciated.

I will remove the mac link for now and re-enable it when William
confirms it is online.

Dear all,

i'm new on QGis, and i'm starting to develop plugin for my project 
using Python and QT.
I'm able to connect to PostGIS database to query the data and to load 
the Layer into QGis, but i'm not able to load the same layer in the 
Overview windows.
May someone can suggest me which function/class/code allow me to do it?

Thank you,

Hi everybody,

i'm tinking to realize a QGis function that every x seconds read data 
from a PG/Postgis database in order to update the current layer/s.
Do you know if it is possible to realize this type of function?

In the module QTCore there is a class named QTimer. I have to use 
this one to realize this functionality?

Thank you, Michele.

Tim,

I agree that behavior would be ideal (leaving the
user free to decide), but this is not
what is always happening. For example, if you
use Save as Shapefile... and select
test as file name, you do not get a folder named
test.

Dear all,

I've just removed Qgis 1.2 from my system and installed 1.3 from the
Ubuntu (Intrepid) PPA. All seemed to go fine, but Qgis segfaults when
I try to launch it. Running strace reveals that it is failing to find
any files in:

/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/

A location that doesn't exist on my laptop. I had previous problems
with 1.2 as the apt-get process didn't install the python-qgis
package, but apt now tells me that I have the latest version installed
(1.3.0-1~jaunty6).

Any pointers would be gratefully received,

Thanks, Joseph

Hi Michele.

There is an 'actionAddToOverview' method in QgisInterface class [1], so you
could use it directly for your plugin.

I!

I think that while the contents of the message
"Found XX matching features ", (after searching the Attribute table) is 
useful
having to click ok to continue with anything else
is annoying.
Perhaps the ok could be removed? Or could the note be printed
in the bottom and not in a new window?

Hi all,

For use Gdal binding with QGis 1.3 for Windows  i maked some tricks.

1) QGis used Gdal bindings gdal15.dll, not gdal16.dll (installed by 
setup.exe )
I used gdal15.exe  from QGis 1.2 for Windows.

2) Is needed put the gdal15.dll in directory in PATH enviroment.
The gdal15.dll not be call if is in [QGis instalation directory]\bin

Hi all.
Work is going ahead: now gdal_rasterize is available.
Our idea is to add all the tools first, then start refining them, so do not worry too much if some
feature or option is missing (but suggestions for improvements are welcome anyway).
All the best.

Hi Michele.

It seems the 'actionAddToOverview' method doesn't work yet. As a workaround,
you could do something like this:

      layer = self.iface.activeLayer()
      mapCanvasLayer = QgsMapCanvasLayer( layer )
      mapCanvasLayer.setInOverview( True )
      self.iface.mapCanvas().setLayerSet( [ mapCanvasLayer ] )

Regards.

I tried 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and trunk, the same result. Do you have any

Hi Martin

Usually this happens if there are several versions of the qgis libs around 
(libqgis_core.so, etc...). Does it solve the problem if you remove the old 
ones?

Marco

I am afraid it's not my case - I found only
'/usr/local/lib/libqgis_core.so' in my system.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remove Selection
Message-ID: <4AB9F3C5.1070304@gmail.com>

Hi!
I've found quite a number of people interpreting
"Remove selection" as actually deleting the selected
records. Perhaps we could use a different
terminology, just Un-select?
Also, it would be useful having a keyboard shortcut
for un-select all and the ability to un-select one given
feature with
the right-button of the mouse if the selection tool
is activated. In this way the user could make a broad selection using a 
rule in
the table and afterwards refine the selection by un-selecting
interactively.

Let me know if this make sense for a ticket.

What about (brainstorming):

- Remove from selected/ selection
- Exclude from selected/ selection
- Reject from selection
- Subtract from selection

It reminds me a bit the GIMP. The user can set the behaviour of a tool
(to add, to remove, to create a new selection, etc.). It would be great
to have some handy tools like the ones used in Photo-Processing
software.

You are right, Agustin. It can be confusing and if possible should be
avoided. In this context I would use 'unselect' or 'clear selection'.

My fault: if you do not specify an output shp, the plugin fails. If it specified, no problem.
See https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1308
It looks an easy fix (just checking wheter the output field is filled).
All the best, and sorry for the noise.

Well, the 'actionAddToOverview' method from QgisInterface do work, just add
this line to your code:

      self.iface.actionAddToOverview().activate( 0 ) # '0' is the signal to
emit, in this case "QAction.triggered()"

And this way you activate the AddToOverview action from QGis. It adds the
active layer to overview map. So, you don't need the workaround.

Regards.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Windows Standalone Install Will Not Run on Freshly
	Imaged Computers
Message-ID: <2D7230119FDBCE4DB0984678195B9200B12992@OC1EX04.ME.MBGOV.CA>

Hello Group:

                        Yesterday I just got my hands on a newly imaged
computer that had the latest Government of Manitoba XP image installed
on it. I wanted to test the standalone installs of QGIS before I tried
any installs of the OSGEO4W images. I installed version 1.3.0 and the
install seemed to work OK. When I tried running it though I got the
error message:

 

"The application has failed to start because the application
configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this
problem."

 

I unistalled QGIS and reinstalled it and got the same message. Next I
tried installing the standalone versions 1.2.0, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 and got
exactly the same errors. When I went back to the installer for 0.11.0
this installed and ran OK.

 

Today I went down to the Government of Manitoba computer test lab and
got a newly-imaged computer and found exactly the same problem. Then I
ran the OSGEO4W installer on all of these versions and on 1.4.0 and all
of the QGIS versions ran OK. Afterwards I was able to run the standalone
versions OK also.

 

Would someone happen to know what might be wrong with the installs of
the standalone versions and how I might fix them to get them to run
without the OSGEO4W versions?

 

Thanks,

            Bob Bruce

Bob,

The OSGeo4W install includes installing the visual studio runtime which
is required by a variety of things.

The QGIS download page mentions:

Note: You may need to install the Microsoft C Runtime Libraries too. If QGIS 
does not start, get the MSVC libs from here and install them before trying to 
run QGIS again.

Bob,

I should leave this to the creators to answer, but I believe it is due
to one or more of the following reasons:

1) It makes the download quite a bit bigger, and the extra stuff is only
ever needed once per machine.

2) It makes the install more complicated - the redistributable is a
separate .exe which must be run.

3) It may not be absolutely clear what the rights are with regard to
redistribution of the runtime (though I'm convinced on a review it would
be fine).

Hi 

Also be sure to install QGIS 1.3.0-3 (available on the QGIS website - earlier builds had a problem with the gdal python bindings which may result in some plugins not working correctly.

Message-ID: <2D7230119FDBCE4DB0984678195B9200B129B4@OC1EX04.ME.MBGOV.CA>

Hi:

            Is there a function to call to 'discover' the version of
QGIS that you are running? I would like to be able to decide whether to
call:

 

QObject.connect(self.emitPoint, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(QgsPoint &,
Qt::MouseButton)"), self.setClipWindow)

 

or

 

QObject.connect(self.emitPoint, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(const QgsPoint &,
Qt::MouseButton)"), self.setClipWindow)

 

based on the version of QGIS. This would allow me to have one version of
my Image Clipper plugin.

 

Thanks,

            Bob Bruce

Hi Germ?n:

                        Thanks for that pointer. I changed the code to:

 

        theVersionInt = QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT

        if theVersionInt / 100 > 102: # must conform to newer API standard call

            QObject.connect(self.emitPoint, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(const QgsPoint &,\

                            Qt::MouseButton)"), self.setClipWindow)

        else: # version is 1.2 or earlier - use older API standard call

            QObject.connect(self.emitPoint, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(QgsPoint &,\

                            Qt::MouseButton)"), self.setClipWindow)

 

And now it works for all versions of QGIS.

 

            Bob

Hi

Its probably the same issue of the stand alone installer (now fixed in build 1.3.0-3). Since we are linking to gdal 1.6 now, python must be set to look for gdal python pyd files in osgeo4w/apps/gdal1.6 instead of the default python libs path. No idea how to fix that in the osgeo4w dist, though no doubt Juergen will have an idea.

Tim

Might be related to this: I just compiled QGIS on a Debian testing, with GDAL 1.6, correctly
recognized; when I try to install a gdal plugin, it looks for gdal 1.5 and fails:
libgdal1.5.0.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Any hint?
All the best.

Hi

Try to run ldd on your QGIS binary and see what gdal lib it is looking
for. Then check all the usual suspects:

- - is ccmake  showing the correct gdal lib variable?
- - is gda 1.6 in your library search path
- - have you clean built since changing the gdal lib in cmake?

Regards

Tim

There's nothing to fix, because it works.

To have python bindings for GDAL 1.6 at all you need to install gdal16-python.

And the batch files used to start qgis call gdal16.bat, which setups PYTHONPATH
correctly.  So if you start qgis using those batch files you should be all set. 

Standalone applications need to use a similar approach.

Hi all.
I see qtlandkarte has improved a lot:
http://www.qlandkarte.org/
it is Qt, has 3D, and uses (not fully, however) GDAL, so we have common ground. Has anybody looked
into it? Do you think there is code to borrow, or functions to integrate?
All the best.

Just for the record: found the problem (thanks Borys, Frankie, Niccolo): I had a dir:
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/GDAL-1.5.2-py2.5-linux-i686.egg/
which shadowed gdal 1.6.
All the best, and sorry for the noise.

BTW, the problem with qwt is still there in debian testing, but it works in unstable
http://n2.nabble.com/PyQt4-Qwt5-errors-td3297928.html
All the best.

SIP is used to generate the python bindings.  So each and every plugin use SIP
bindings.  So it's not that easy to replace it at all - any probably
without changing the python interface.  SWIG might be any option.  That might
also open QGIS for other languages.

But I'd expect riverbank to change the license, because it's likely that
someone will fork sip otherwise.

Dear Quantum GIS Developers,

I would like to send out call for taking over OGR
maintenance in Quantum GIS project.

I haven't done much, practically nothing, but as I'm listed
as official maintainer, I believe I owe the Community
official clarification of the situation.

I would be thankful if somebody could take over OGR maintenance
and removing my name from the project organigram [1].

Thank you and best luck to everybody involved!

Hi

Didn't you read clause 5 subsection 3.1.2.5 of your contract which clearly states that all QGIS developers once inaugurated as a maintainer may never resign unless they are 80 + years old and struggling to see the computer screen anymore?

On a serious note, thanks for your contribution, hopefully someone will take an interest in pursuing the ogr plugin work in the future.

Regards

Tim

Dear Quantum GIS Developers,

I would like to send out call for taking over OGR
maintenance in Quantum GIS project.

I haven't done much, practically nothing, but as I'm listed
as official maintainer, I believe I owe the Community
official clarification of the situation.

I would be thankful if somebody could take over OGR maintenance
and removing my name from the project organigram [1].

Thank you and best luck to everybody involved!

I've read that one, twice, but I hope you could make
an exception for me ;-)

BTW the wiki moved.  [1] was the old location and [2] is the new one.
And I reversed [3] in [2].

I'm not sure this is related (sorry if it is not) but are you aware that
there is a new python qt project ?

I've noticed that there's no way to specify a scale factor between horizontal
and vertical units (e.g. if the DEM is in decimal degrees, and the vertical
units are meters).  I use the gdaldem tools to make hillshades right now,
and it allows you to specify such a scale factor (Feet:Latlong use
scale=370400, Meters:LatLong use scale=111120  - see
http://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html).

Other than that, great plugin, love it!

Hi

Regarding GdalTools installation. It can be improved slightly. Instead
of asking to install "osgeo" ("_ogr" on the other machine) if
"gdal-python" is missing, it can be more specific. I spent some trying to figure out what is this package -
"osgeo" or "_ogr", turned out this was "gdal16-python"

I encounter this error occasionally on ubuntu. Sometimes the error
appears when opening a project, but most times it does not. It doesn't
seem to cause any problems and I can continue working. The error comes
from: qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp

int QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::openDb( QString path, sqlite3 **db )
{
  QgsDebugMsg( "path = " + path );
  int myResult = sqlite3_open( path.toUtf8().data(), db );

  if ( myResult )

    QgsLogger::critical( "Can't open database: " + QString(
sqlite3_errmsg( *db ) ) );
    // XXX This will likely never happen since on open, sqlite creates the

    // ... unfortunately it happens on Windows
    QgsMessageOutput* output = QgsMessageOutput::createMessageOutput();
    output->setTitle( "Error" );
    output->setMessage( "Could not open CRS database " + path +

The vertical exaggeration factor was intended to be used for that
purpose but I did not allow a sufficiently small scaling there
(1/111120 for m or 1/370400 for ft). I updated the plugin and uploaded
it to the repo with just that change. See if you can use it that way
now.

Glad that you like the plugin,

Andreas

Hi all and especially non-latin, non-UTF8 users,

I'd like to point to a strange behaviour regarding adding GRASS layers with
different encoding.

Let's say you have a GRASS vector with UTF8 database, you select a
location, add vector layer - all nice, table is readable, life is
good. Now you need to add another table from CP1251 location, you
select location and add layer and hmm... attributes are unreadable.

Now to fix this, we go to Layer\Add vector layer like we add any other (non GRASS layer) and select
CP1251 encoding there, click OK, but don't really load anything just trigger
needed encoding, so no need to actually select a layer.

Go back to GRASS location, load CP1251 layer - now it shows up fine.

To summarize: I find this rather unintuitive. Either encoding should
be added to add GRASS vector dialog, or layer encoding should be globally
set or something else.

Am I missing something? Any thoughts?

Please be patient. I'm a newbie here...

1) My newbie question: I can't seem to get a simple repos to parse  
Qgis. I have created a file and placed a boilerplate python plugin in  
the same directory:

<?xml version = '1.0' encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="/qgis_plugins.xsl" ?>
<plugins>
   <pyqgis_plugin version="0.0.1" name="Forest Information" >

I have no idea what the xsl document should look like and cannot seem  
to find an example of one. Can someone please give me a little guidance.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Newbie plugin developer question
Message-ID: <E0DE0E21-E019-48FA-B448-BCCDF6AB8822@forestinformatics.com>

I have completed a proof of concept experimental intelligent software  
agent (server-side) for forest and forestry data, and now need to  
generate a client/consumer interface for editing and updating rows in  
a PostGIS database housed on a server far away (think dial-up and  
remote connections). I have selected to develop it as a QGIS plugin.

1) I've never written a python program in my life, but given a decent  
IDE I'm sure I can manage it in no time. I've been developing  C/C++  
code for 20 years.
2) The plugin needs to work on several platforms. I spend most of my  
time in OSX, but the target audience is Windows users. I run windows  
under a virtual machine.
3) Users will have local copies of the data(base) and need to sync the  
data with the server (once a week? once a day?)

My question is this:

Can I develop this plugin using an IDE (Eclipse or Dev Studio)?
If I go with Python, what gotchas am I running into? Single level  
menus under Plugins or anywhere in menu tree?
If I use C++ do I need to build all of QGIS an any platform I want to  
run the plugin on from source?

So far, I've assumed the user will download the OSGEO4W for QGIS, so  
I've assumed they can connect to my repository and install it that  
way. Is that rational regardless of how it's built?

Thanks,
Jeff.

Hi!

Why is not
http://www.mappinggeek.ca/QGISPythonPlugins/Bobs-QGIS-plugins.xml
added to the repo list in the Plugin Installer Tool/Repositories/Add 3rd 
party repositories? I'm using the Modified Zoom-to-Point plugin and find 
it very useful,
not having the exaggerated zoom that is still present in Zoom-to-Point 
plugin
from the official repo.

I've never written a C++ program in my life, but pretty much in no
time I figured out how to convert Qt C++ programs into python. Most of
the OO paradigms from C++ map to python very simply. I think I spent
most of the time just converting "foo->bar()" from C++  into
"foo.bar()", and removing semicolons - but you don't even need to
remove the semicolons.

 Depending on your application you might want to keep the local copy
in an SpatiaLite database. That way there's no need to run PostGIS on
your users machines. Then your sync system would pull out of
SpatiaLite and sync to PostGIS. Obviously if you need all the heavy
geo-lifting that PostGIS does then that's not an option. Just a
thought.

> My question is this:
> Can I develop this plugin using an IDE (Eclipse or Dev Studio)?

 I've never understood IDE's :) With python there's no 'build' step to
speak of, so all I need is a text editor.

> under Plugins or anywhere in menu tree?

 Plugin menu items can go anywhere - you can create a new top-level
menu or squeeze them into any of the existing menu items. This is all
controlled by Qt. Python plugins use the PyQt4 library and so can call
99% of the Qt library methods.

 The only problems you'll get are when Qgis API calls haven't been
implemented in the python interface, but asking nicely on #qgis on IRC
sometimes gets that done. Learning how to do it yourself with SIP (and
as a C++ programmer, you might understand that better than I do!) will
win you massive points.

 There are some things you can't do with C++ or Python plugins because
the behaviour isn't exposed in the API. For example I don't think you
can change the right-click menu in the layer list.

> If I use C++ do I need to build all of QGIS an any platform I want to run

 Not sure - I suspect that once you've got everything to compile your
plugin then building Qgis would be trivial.

 That's how the repositories are supposed to work!

I'll be glad to add it when only two problems are resolved:

- the Image Clip is updated to work with QGIS > 1.2 (plugins not designed for 
recent versions should have the <qgis_maximum_version> tag, but Bob has 
written it's solved now)
- the Zoom To Point version number is correct and don't confuse the installer 
(the declared versions: in the xml and in the __init__.py HAVE to match to let 
the installer determine the plugin status)

also, we're working on integrating image clipper into GDAL Tools, so it mught become redundant.

Message-ID: <8CC68154-C0EB-4E2B-9DB6-325AF0B50E18@forestinformatics.com>

It seems that we cannot include port numbers in the urls for qgis  
repositories, yes?

   <pyqgis_plugin version='version 0.0.1' name='rufus'>
     <homepage>http://www.forestinformatics.com:9182/qgis</homepage>
     <download_url>http://www.forestinformatics.com:9182/qgis/ 
rufus.zip</download_url>
   </pyqgis_plugin>
</plugins>

while the html output displayed just fine, qgis would return an error.  
I've since moved the directory to a place that doesn't require the  
port number but want to keep the two httpd locations completely  
separate for now. is is possible to include the port number in the url?

Thanks,
Jeff.

Note also that a bit ago we started 'geosilk', see

http://projects.opengeo.org/geosilk
http://blog.opengeo.org/2009/05/01/geosilk/

These extend the 'silk' icon set which is widely used on the web, 
borrowing geospatial icons from the uDig icons:

http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/DEV/Imagery

We're using them in the GeoServer admin console and in GeoExt, and are 
definitely excited for more people to make use of them and for 
collaboration.  It'd be great to sync up somehow with the gis icons, 
though it looks like ours are a bit more space constrained.

 Seems to work for me with Qgis 1.3. I put:

http://www.forestinformatics.com:9182/qgis/plugins.xml

 into the URL field and 'rufus port test' in the name. Plugin
installer was happy, and it installed your plugin.

What was your error, and what version of Qgis? Are you sure you got
the right URL in the field? It has to be the URL of the xml, not the
repository folder.

Ok, everything installs well, but I assume it's only because you've masked it 
with the instance not requiring port number.

It is likely that the installer ignores the port number - I'll check it 
tonight and try to fix.

Hi Giovanni

Yes, there is room for more operators. The list in the ticket seems to be 
usefull to me. I just like to wait for Martins opinion before adding more 
operators, since he knows the search string parser code best.

I'm closing the ticket if there are no objections.

it. Feedback would be appreciated.

Help on the plugin is available at:

This plugin may be incorported at some point into the GDAL Tools plugin

Could it be possible highlighting the boundaries

It would be most useful to explore their "contents"
on other layer, i.e., while keeping "no brush" for the fill
style, inspecting an image composite
for the selected polygon (i.e., a veg. tye or a crop type)
would be easier if the boundary of the selected
polygons were highlighted.

Thanks!

(and good to know it's considered a bug, and not
a "by design feature" as the Ctrl++ :) ), Anyway,
this is a "minor annoyance" only if you don't need it...
I'd rather change it to "does not work as expected"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Trunk not building
Message-ID: <B3E44714-7D6D-4E6B-A0A1-46D14AA72513@wildnevada.org>

Before filing a bug, is anyone else experience a build failure with  
the current trunk source?

Qt-4.5.2, sip-4.8.2, PyQt-4.5.4, OS X 10.6.1

Here's my error output:
