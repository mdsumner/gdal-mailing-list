Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis 0.9 OSX build
Message-ID: <B34228F7-C33E-4409-BAF1-4AD17775108E@kyngchaos.com>

I have a Mac OS X build of Qgis 0.9.0 preview 2 available now.  In  
working out out how to bundle PyQt and SIP I used the @loader_path  
feature that was introduced in Tiger, so it won't run on Panther.   
Besides my frameworks, the only other extra software needed is Python  
2.5 (not the 2.3 that is in the system).

The Python support loads in Qgis, and I tested on the CLI by setting  
PYTHONPATH and importing qgis in python.

Also, I updated my Qt recently, so this uses Qt 4.3/PyQt 4.3 + SIP 4.7.

Some observations:

- there are some linking problems in the install step - msexport,  
qgis_help and the python qgis libs link to the source build copies of  
libqgis_core and libqgis_gui.  Probably an install_name_tool step was  
missed.

- the strange crash loading shapefiles when GRASS was missing seems  
to be fixed.

- python annoyance: Qgis uses Qt3support, core, gui, network, sql,  
svg, xml, so only those Qt frameworks would normally need to be  
bundled in the app.  But PyQt loads as a whole package, which means  
assistant, opengl, script and test also need to be bundled.

- python problem: since qgis python loads from the python executable,  
@executable_path won't work for the bundled Qt frameworks and pyqt -  
the frameworks can only have one install path (either relative to  
qgis or relative to python), and relative to python would be wrong  
and fragile, traversing across completely different directory trees.

So I ended up using Tiger's @loader_path feature.  That way they're  
all relative to each other inside the app bundle, independent of  
where python is or where Qgis is installed.  Only the executables use  
@executable_path.  Here is my diagram I came up with to map this out  
(I abbreviated a few things - @l and @x are loader_/executable_path,  
core and gui are the qgis libs):

I wonder if bundling at least the Qt frameworks (and setting  
@loader_paths) should be part of the make install step?  Possibly  
even bundling the PyQt/SIP stuff?  I don't know about others, but I  
consider Qt to be one of those things you always bundle, and not  
leave in /Library/frameworks.  Things could go wrong in there -  
overwriting a user's version (older OR newer), or expecting a user to  
download and install it, C++ binary compatibility problems with  
different versions.

I forgot an issue I noticed:

the splash window doesn't have transparent corners - where they are  
rounded, a default toolbar background shows to make the window  
squared off.  This was OK when I tried preview 1, but I used Qt 4.2  
then, so maybe it's a Qt 4.3 problem?

Hi Tisham,
I'm testing the new preview and I found some bugs or defects.
Maybe do you know some of these but I prefered make a complete list.

Python missing
PyQt4 missing
Python QGIS bindings support missing
SIP module missing

GRASS missings
If I use a old QGIS version for GRASS GISBASE I can use GRASS tools.
But if I open a mapset and then if I close it QGIS says:
?Cannot close mapset. Cannot remove mapset lock: C:/Documents and
Settings/leo/Documenti/cartografia/Toscana/leo/.gislock?

The Mapserver exoprt tool does not work.

The "Add all layers to overview" and "Remove all layers from overview"
don't work and sometime when I click them QGIS crashs.

SHAPE EDITING
When I select a digitilized polygon and when I try to add an island QGIS
say to me: "Selected feature is not a multipolygon". Is this function
available ony for PostGis tables?

MAPCOMPOSER
The value of the rappresentative scale is not realistic. The values are
too small.
The default scale segment value has strange value (es. 980)
The SVG creator does not work
It is not possible to choose where the pdf is saved and the created pdf
seems to be damaged.
Bad rendering about points vector.

POSTGIS TABLE EDITING

Trying to edit a a postgis-table. This seems to work as expected inside
the GUI, but after deleting the layer, reload it, the datas do not
appear changed.
The first time that I made the test, whn I click on 'Stop editing' QGIS
say:

    ^

The PostgreSQL database returned: ERROR: syntax error at or near "="
LINE 1: UPDATE "public"."rm98_2007_lin" SET ='34455' WHERE "gid"=1
Durante la prova: UPDATE "public"."rm98_2007_lin" SET ='34455' WHERE
"gid"=1

I think the problem is in the double quotes: "public"."rm98_2007_lin".



Thank you very much for your work
Leonardo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsGeometry
Message-ID: <200709081603.19953.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis devs,

I'm currently doing some development in the geometry class (in the advanced 
editing branch). qgsgeometry.cpp now has about 5000 lines of code. Clearly 
too much for one class. 
I therefore plan to move some code that modifies the current geometry to other 
classes. For instance there could be a class 'QgsSplitGeometry' which has a 
pointer to a geometry object and a method that splits this geometry using the 
interface methods fromPolyline(), asPolyline(), etc. Like this, we could move 
much code away from qgsgeometry.cpp. The interface methods make copies of the 
geometry, but I think that this is no problem for manipulation methods, which 
are not performance critical. And the fromPolyline(), asPolyline(),... 
methods provide a proper interface that separates manipulation code from 
internal geometry representation (which is wkb).

Any objection about this? 
Maybe you have better ideas. If so, please post them here on the list.

Best regards,
Marco

I don?t think this is a good way. Let?s say that QGIS is rendering a
map and in meanwhile user wants to open and browse attribute table -
in this case we have a problem with concurrency, probably there are
other situations that would need mutual exception.

My idea is that we must provide an interface for iteration that
wouldn?t have side effects on data provider. Members variables which
are being modified during interation must be extracted from the
provider and put to a specific subclass of an iterator. This way we
can isolate different iterations at one time so threads won?t get into
race condition.

Yup, it?s worth finding out if the problem with a crash with big zooms
doesn?t pop up anymore with recent versions of Qt (4.2 and later).

Well, there?s a small problem that we want to be able to use core
rendering routines also without the need to use QGraphicsScene (e.g. a
server that runs without X server). That?s why I think we should
develop our own caching mechanism which would work also when graphics
view is not used.

Some time ago we had a patch here from Brendan Morley (I think it can
be still found on his blog on http://blog.qgis.org/ ) where he tried
to use directly graphics view items for vectors. The speed has been
reported by someone as pretty bad when using BIG layers, but probably
this could be improved somehow...

Hi Marco,

you're right, that class is really HUGE and hard to maintain. My big
wish about it is to stop completely doing the operations on geometries
with WKB and start fully using GEOS for geometry manipulations. It
will not only make the code much smaller, it will be also less
volnurable to bugs and with the same performance (I guess we can trust
GEOS devs that the library is efficient). In my opinion, we should
only support WKB import and export, but represent the geometries as a
GEOS geometry. If the class would be still too huge, I'm for splitting
it into some smaller ones.

What do you think?

Martin

P.S. I'm still without a proper internet connection, so my replies
might take longer time :-/

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the feedback.

> In my opinion, we should

> GEOS geometry

I think that with data sources that provide only wkb geometries (e.g. ogr or 
postgis), there will be some overhead for drawing if we store geometries only 
in geos format internally.
Currently, it is:
postgis -> wkb -> drawing in vectorlayer
and with internal storage as geos:
postgis -> wkb -> geos -> drawing in vectorlayer

>My big
> wish about it is to stop completely doing the operations on geometries

You are right that they shouldn't be done in WKB. But my experience with geos 
is that manipulation code can have similar length as with WKB, in some cases 
even more. In my opinion, the classes QgsPoint, QgsLinestring & co. are very 
well suited for manipulations. It is possible to just change one coordinate 
value, e.g. for a vertex move, without the need to do the whole geometry 
construction again (as in geos).
It may not be very performant to convert QgsPolyline to geos and than geos to 
wkb, as it is currently done with asPolyline(). But, unlike the drawing code, 
the manipulation methods are not performance critical at all since only few 
features are manipulated at once. 
So my preferred solution would be to move manipulations into separate classes 
which get and set geometry from QgsGeometry with 
QgsPoint/QgsLinestring/QgsPolygon & co. 
Would that make sense?

> If the class would be still too huge, I'm for splitting

I think it would still be too huge only with geos representation. Splitting 
sounds good.

Marco

In case of OGR this is not true - we can use derived classes of
OGRGeometry for geometry retreival instead of WKB export.
I'm going to take a look at the conversion routines, but IMHO
conversion WKB -> GEOS should be quite fast. Postgis -> wkb conversion
in fact should be costless since AFAIK postgis stores the geometries
in extended wkb, which is a superset of OGC wkb.
Maybe I'm wrong but the real bottleneck is always data fetching from
the providers as they have to read the data from some media. Any
conversions happening in RAM are very quick in comparison.

In GEOS you can also do vertex moves without the need of
reconstructing the geometry, e.g. LineString::getPointN(size_t n)

I just think that since we already have GEOS as a dependency, we
should use it more thoroughly.

That's just temporary routine, once it's all in geos representation we
can convert it directly from that.

So far QgsPolyline, QgsPolygon are just typedefs for arrays of

Could you please post how could the splitted classes look like? I

Hi Martin,

Sorry for my long mail. In my opinion it is a really interesting topic.

> In case of OGR this is not true - we can use derived classes of
> OGRGeometry for geometry retreival instead of WKB export.

Ok, this is a clever solution. So postgis is the only provider that would have 
a performance loss with internal switch to geos? I'm inclined to think that 
this is a low price for the benefit of cleaner code with geos instead of wkb.

>Postgis -> wkb conversion
> in fact should be costless since AFAIK postgis stores the geometries
> in extended wkb, which is a superset of OGC wkb.

Yes, but wkb -> geos afterwards not. You can test the effect by forcing a wkb 
to geos conversion for every feature. In QgsGeometry::wkbBuffer() insert the 
following two lines.

 unsigned char * QgsGeometry::wkbBuffer()
{
  if (mDirtyWkb)
  {
    // convert from GEOS
    exportGeosToWkb();
  }

+  mDirtyGeos = true;
+ exportWkbToGeos();

  return mGeometry;
}

(and outcomment the debugging output in the geos conversion routine)

I tested with a database that had 3s to draw without extra geos conversion and 
4s with. The effect might be different with other data.
However, in my opinion that seems acceptable, since it's only for postgres 
provider.

> Maybe I'm wrong but the real bottleneck is always data fetching from

You can test the performance effect of reading from disk by comparing ogr 
layers in qgis with wfs layers for the same dataset. Afaik ogr reads from 
disk while wfs provider reads the features into memory when loading the 
layer. There is indeed some difference, but the difference is not so high as 
I expected. What is your opinion?

check the following example:

wfs:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/marco/mapfiles/mapfile.map&

shape:

http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/various/lake24k_nhd.zip



> In GEOS you can also do vertex moves without the need of
> reconstructing the geometry, e.g. LineString::getPointN(size_t n)

LineString::getPointN(size_t n) returns just a copy of the point:

Point*
LineString::getPointN(size_t n) const
{
	assert(getFactory());
	assert(points.get());
	return getFactory()->createPoint(points->getAt(n));
}

Maybe there are other possibilities that I have missed?

> So far QgsPolyline, QgsPolygon are just typedefs for arrays of
> points... what methods would they receive?

Yes, I meant those typedefs. My point was just that some modification 
operations may have less code with the QVectors than with geos classes 
directly.  

> Could you please post how could the splitted classes look like? I
> still don't get an idea in what would that result...

There could e.g. be a class that splits a geometry into two parts by a line 
(just to get the code for geometry splitting out of QgsGeometry):

class QgsSplitGeometry
{
	public:
		int splitGeometry(QList<points> splitLine, QgsGeometry** newGeometry);
	private:
		QgsGeometry* mGeometry
}

and then implementation something like:

int QgsSplitGeometry::splitGeometry(QList<points> splitLine, QgsGeometry** 
newGeometry)
{
	//switch over geometry type
	...
	case QGis::WKBLineString:
	{
		QgsPolyline thisLine = mGeometry->asPolyline();
		QgsPolyline newLine;
		//...then code to change line
		mGeometry->fromPolyline(thisLine);
		//...and to create new line
		(*newGeometry) = QgsGeometry::fromPolyline(newLine);
		return 0;
	}
}

But ok, maybe it can be done better by getting and setting geos geometry from 
QgsGeometry (and converting to QVector based structures inside 
QgsSplitGeometry if needed there).

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <681d07c20709110128h6e2b2567w60ea61642fae4eb6@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to build 0.9 on ubuntu from source, following
http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource, in hopes of doing my
part in making 0.9 the best qgis ever :)

There appears to be a minor typo in section 5.9.  It looks like this

  cd qgis
  mkdir build
  ccmake ..

should instead be this:

  cd qgis
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ccmake ..

Adding "cmake" to the "sudo apt-get install" list of dependencies in
section 5.4 would make sense, too.

Finally, I have a question.  i'm using feisty, and during dependecy
install I had to make a package substitution with libgdal1.  Apt-get
tells me:

  Package libgdal1-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
  is only available from another source
  However the following packages replace it:
    libgdal1-1.3.2-dev

and again

  E: Couldn't find package libgdal1-grass

so I use libgdal1-1.3.2-grass instead.  No problem, easy going until
compile-time.

I assume, in my limited wisdom, that i need libgdal1.3.2.so, and so I
check, and there it is.  Am I mis-interpreting things?

  $ locate -r 'libgdal.*.so$'
  /usr/lib/libgdal1.3.2.so

Thanks so much for the BuildingFromSource instructions - very clean
and easy-to-follow.

Actually, wkbBuffer() gets called at least two times (as also
wkbType() calls it), but this is still quite a lot of time. I'll look
into it.

Ok, but I won't be able to compare with your WFS server (still no
internet at home). Maybe the difference is lower as the data gets
cached by the operating system?
I'd like to look at the performance of the conversions.

Ah, you're right. But there are still GeometryFilter classes which I
think could be subclassed to change the geometry without the need to
reconstruct it.

Now I'm starting to think that we should rather start to use a scheme
as e.g. OGR and GEOS use. They have a base Geometry class and derived
classes which can do operations with the specific type of geometry
(point, polyline, ...). What leads me to this: when you look to
QgsGeometry source, it's full of long switches for different types of
geometry. In a book about refactoring I've read that long switches are
a "bad smell" which should be better implemented with virtual
functions with different implementations in derived classes. Does this
make a sense to you?
In this approach, splitGeometry() would be also just another virtual
function in QgsGeometry which would be implemented properly in child
classes.

Cheers
Martin

Icosa, you are right about the libgal library, it is a bit different for 
Feisty. Here is my initial apt-get statement I use on fresh copies of Feisty

sudo apt-get install subversion g++ qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools cmake 
postgresql-
8.2 sip4 python-sip4 python-sip4-dbg python-sip4-dev grass libgrass 
libgrass-dev
libgeos-dev gdal-bin libgdal1-1.3.2-dev flex bison gsl-bin libgsl0-dev 
sqlite3
libsqlite3-dev python-qt4-dev

That should be all you need to get qgis to compile....

I believe that you only need this lib if you are building grass from 
source also

cmake is not finding the gdal library. From the build directory you can 
type:
ccmake .
in a terminal window and then you can set the correct path. You can also 
use a command line option to set the path to the gdal library. However, 
if you use the apt-get list above you should not have any problems.

Hope that helps a little.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving forward with the raster transparency branch
Message-ID: <46E6AA8E.6000403@amnh.org>

QGIS Devs,

There has been interest in merging the mods in the 
raster_transparency_branch into the 0.9.1 release. The main changes 
currently are:
1) Revival of basic contrast enhancement
2) Introduction of transparent pixel lists
3) Foundation for basic color ramps.

More information about the raster_transparency_branch can be found here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RasterTransparencyBranch

Back in May and June there was a meeting to discuss refactoring of the 
monolithic (5K+ lines) QgsRasterLayer class. The last UML design can be 
found here:

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RasterRefactorRfc

There still needs to be some discussion regarding the final refactoring 
of QgsRasterLayer as there are some great ideas being proposed but 
uncertainty regarding the best approach.

In the mean time, I am proposing that contract enhancement and 
transparency be the first functionality that is broken out of 
QgsRasterLayer, as they are relatively well defined, discrete components 
that are well suited for being separate classes. I will undertake this 
in the current raster_transparency_branch with the goal of having this 
ready for the 0.9.1 release. I propose that classes be named:

QgsRasterTransparencyFilter
QgsRasterContrastEnhancementFilter

I am not sold of the Filter suffix but am still using the June UML as a 
bit of a guide. These changes should not affect anything outside of 
QgsRasterLayer and should not adversely affect anything class that 
inherits QgsRasterLayer.

Please let me know what you think.  Marco, I want to specifically ensure 
that these proposed changes will not impact anything you are currently 
working on. Again, these changes will be made under the 
raster_transparency_branch first, then at a later date merged into the 
trunk.

Thanks
-pete

BTW: from the 12 to the 22 I will have limited access to e-mail, so 
apologies ahead of time if I am slow to respond .

Hi,

I've downloaded qgis 0.9 for Mac OS X 10.4  from from
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/unixport/qgis.

If I try to run this comand from python IDLE:
import sys
sys.path.append('/Contents/MacOS/share/qgis/python')
from qgis.gui import *

Python go in crash or if I try to launch a Martin Dobias tutorial also
python go in crash for a bus error

Where is the possible mistake?
There is someone that using correctly qgis+python bindings under mac os x?

thank you very much

Check Console.app for a crashlog in ~/Library/Logs.  It'll probably  
be for python.

When I built that package I tested by importing qgis, but I had  
nothing else to test.

That sys.path looks odd - /Contents/... is absolute from the root of  
your HD.  It should probably be:

/Applications/qgis0.9.0.app/Contents/MacOS/share/qgis/python

Though the qgis import didn't complain.  Odd.

Hi William,
the path it's right beacause I can import succesfully qgis.core.

The problem is only with qgis.gui. This is my crashlog:

Hmm, have you installed Qt and PyQt/SIP yourself?  Which versions?   
It's loading some Qt stuff from the Qgis bundle and some from / 
Library/Frameworks.  It should all load from the Qgis bundle.  If the  
versions don't match, there will likely be problems.

It's a bit of an experiment, for now.  Trying to get the bundling  
thing working - I tested it withOUT an installed PyQt/SIP and  
frameworks, but didn't think there might be issues WITH an installed  
PyQt/SIP.

Probably Python is looking in it's own site-packes before any user- 
added paths.  I wonder if there is a way to change the sys.path  
search order?  I don't know THAT much about python, yet.

Are you running the Python stuff from within Qgis?  Or from a  
Terminal without Qgis running?  Qgis adds its internal python to the  
sys.path automatically, so that's probably why core loads if run from  
Qgis.

Even so, sys.path.append adds to the end of the search list, so the  
Qgis bundle will be searched last, and your installed PyQt/SIP will  
be found first.  A better way might be to insert instead of append.   
Try this instead of the sys.path.append:

sys.path.insert(1,'/Applications/qgis0.9.0.app/Contents/MacOS/share/ 
qgis/python')

This should put it at the beginning of the search list, but after the  
script path (item 0).

Yes, true. It may make sense to switch to such a scheme in the middle term 
(maybe after merging of advanced editing branch).
There could be several possibilities to do so:

-The qgis classes could be derived from geos classes and from QgsGeometry 
interface class.

-Or an approache similar to OGR which has their own representation of geometry 
and does geos conversion when needed for topological operations.

And there are surely other approaches. At first glance I prefer the first 
approach as it seems to me that we could reuse more code like this. But I 
have to look closer at the geos implementation.

Marco

Yes, those actions would be blocked during map rendering. But with the current

Ok, seems like threaded rendering can only be done after another provider 
redesign. And there is also QgsRasterLayer which would need to be implemented 
in a thread safe way...

My work in the raster branch is finished for the moment, so no problem.

What about merging the current state of the raster transparency branch to 
trunk after release? Like this, all the users (at least those compiling the 
newest svn) would benefit from the work that has already been done in the 
branch. Raster redesign could then be continued in a branch.

Marco

Yesterday I've took a look at GEOS library and found out that there is
some kind of support for custom geometry classes - we could make our
own CoordinateSequence class which would use QVector, our own
CoordinateSequenceFactory for creation of these sequences and
GeometryFactory from creation of our custom geometries. The only
problem is that we still would need to use Coordinate class for the
coordinates, but that's not that big problem. It comes with three
member variables: x,y,z and some functions. I can imagine that we
would derive e.g. QgsCoord class from it that will add some more
functions for us if needed - in fact this class (QgsCoord) should
replace QgsPoint, as QgsPoint should be in the new scheme derived from
QgsGeometry.

After all, we would get a common representation for QGIS where we
could avoid any further conversions, I'm just a bit affraid if others
would be okay with this as it's a rather radical change...

Gary, maybe this should be changed in the Qgis source?  I imagine it  
will affect other platforms where a user installs PyQt on their own  
but uses a downloaded Qgis binary.

Yes, it will touch many existing lines in the whole codebase, including 
plugins. But in my opinion it's really worth doing it, as having a clean 
geometry represenation is very important for a GIS. 
It would therefore be good to have a wiki page and make a request for comments 
before starting to redesign the geometry.
 
As we make the redesign in a branch it will not disturb other development 
activities (at least in theory). So it should be easy to convince people.

Marco

Regarding groups, this is not the only, and a not major problem IMHO.
More annoying issue is that moving groups, and layers when groups are
present, is buggy. See the report: https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/699.

Hi Peter,

Another comment about the refactoring of raster layer:
It would be good if thread safety could be another criterion for the raster 
redesign. That means that member variables describing the iteration state in 
providers should be separated into an iterator object. Martin and I discussed 
this for vector layers on the mailing list. As there is raster refactoring 
anyway, it would be good to consider this point as well. Hopefully, at some 
point in future, qgis may benefit from the capabilities of multicore cpus.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cmake and ccmake usage - "Python bindings disabled"
Message-ID: <681d07c20709141957p3da7e861wca66256c0586850d@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for previous ccmake+feisty+libgdal pointers.  I'm still getting
comfortable with cmake.  You pointed me in the right direction, and i
successfully built and ran 0.9.

I ran into some confusing cmake and ccmake behavior - using the
"ccmake" invocation, when I press "c" to configure my values, it
flashes messages including "Python bindings disabled due to dependency
problems" on the status bar... "e" doesn't show errors, and I can
still "g"enerate.  Is it possible to see (and respond to) these
messages in "ccmake"?

In cmake, what i'm assuming are the same messages go to the console.
I get I've verified the locations of the sip binary, python2.5
libraries, PyQt4, but I don't see where to specify PyQt4 location and
I still get

-- SIP not found!
-- PyQt4 not found!
-- Python bindings disabled due dependency problems!

any ideas?
best,
christian

Hi Wiliam,

I don't understand how do you mean this - what should be changed? If I
understand this issue correctly, the problem arises when someone adds
qgis bindings path to the end of python's sys.path list. Instead it
should be added to the start of the list... but how is this related to
the QGIS sources?

Regards
Martin

The Python tools shell that is opened from within Qgis sets the  
sys.path. src/app/qgspythonutils.cpp line 50:

   // expect that bindings are installed locally, so add the path to  
modules
   // also add path to plugins
   runString("sys.path = [\"" + pythonPath() + "\", \"" + pluginsPath 
() + "\"] + sys.path");

Ah, once I look at it closely, it's effectively doing an insert, just  
in a more manual way.

The mapserver export does an append:

   QString sysCmd = QString("sys.path.append('%1')").arg(scriptDir);

but it doesn't use any python extensions, so no change necessary there.

Hi,

since PyQGIS is just an optional part of QGIS, it?s not considered to
be an error when python dependencies are not found - the rest of the
sources can be built without any problems.

Yes, with cmake you get the same messages. SIP and PyQt4 detection
tries to import the appropriate python modules. What happens when you
run python and type:
import sip
from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui

If you have already installed SIP and PyQt4, make sure that it's
installed to correct version of Python (different versions of Python
do not share additional modules).

Devs,
I have completed an initial review of the QGIS code base for  
copyright and license information.

Where copyright/license was missing from a source file, I added a  
default statement with my contact information. Feel free to correct  
the copyright for files you may have created but failed to include a

Thanks!  FYI, for ubuntu feisty, i find that the following two
packages are required to successfully import the above modules (though
I haven't tried a rebuild yet):

sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-sip4

take care,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Projection: National DATUM of Luxemburg (LUREF)
Message-ID: <1190041411.3997.22.camel@linux-fvav.site>

Hello,
        
        my Name is Sascha Wernicke and I'm working for a
        consulting-company in
        Luxembourg. We are using GRASS and QGIS to generate forestry
        maps and to
        so some raster-analysis. The reason why I'm posting this message
        is,
        that in Luxemburg we are using a special projection which is
        called
        LUREF.
        I have inserted the details for the LUREF projection which I
        have
        received from the Luxemburgian Cadastral Office, at the end of
        this
        mail. Concerning this, I would ask whether it would be possible
        to
        create an own LUREF-projection which could be integrated in the
        QGIS-project? 
        In advance I thank you very much for any help concernig this
        subject.
        
        Best regards from Luxemburg.

I would prefer if we can begin to adopt a more conservative policy
with regards to merging things into head. The idea would be that when
we feel raster stuff is useable, make a test release from that branch,
solicit, comments feedback, bug reports etc. Then stabilise and only
*then* merge. The idea being that svn trunk can be as stable as
possible at all times and that we become a lot more conservative about
letting new code into trunk. Also I would like to ask that any new
features proposed for merge with trunk be accompanied by suitable unit
tests so that we can have a good quality control process and identify
early on if future changes break existing features.

Other than the above reservations, I support the proposals you and
Peter are making for refactoring and thread safety.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

I agree we need to formalise a procedure on how to merge branches back. Maybe 
we should discuss it in a PSC meeting?
In my opinion, the development in branches has lead to a lot of branches that 
are around for some time. And the longer they are developed separated from 
trunk the harder it will be to merge the work back. At any rate we should 
avoid to have OpenQGIS, DeeQGIS, SkyQGIS, PirolQGIS, ...

Regards,
Marco

Yes I agree there is some trade off here - though in general if you
merge trunk into your branch weekly or so this is not a great issue -
unless you have large architectural changes in your branch. In general
prefer that we have some small hassles merging stuff back to trunk and
have a more conservative, stable trunk. Regards to DeeQGIS etc I wasnt
really suggesting this. Rather to have a test build or two from
branches for public testing before we do the merge. This is not
dissimilar to other projects e.g. firefox creates test builds of the
3.0 branch while still developing onward in the stable 2.x branch.
Anyway good lets discuss on an irc meeting :-)

We should be more conservative than before, but not too much - in my
opinion QGIS is not yet in a state which we could call "mature". So I
think that a good method of decisions for merging branches to trunk
would be that once developer(s) say that a branch is ready for merge,
two or more other devs or testers should try the changes (and maybe
review the code) and write down their observations and issues. If
there are not any major problems found, branch can be merged.

This is more flexible than doing releases for public testing - in fact
we don't have many active testers (that would file bug reports) so we
can't compare with a project like Firefox with hundreds of testers...

I apologize for being so slow to answer.

The polygon border problem should be fixed.  Like the lines, it only matches
when both the map and legend are in render mode.
I think there are time when it's good to be able to set render mode
independently, but it would be helpful to have a "set all items to
render/set all items to cache" option.

The label positioning is slightly more difficult, and I haven't had time to
work on it.  Thanks for the dataset though.
As far as I can tell, the font nastiness occurs with Qt on Ubuntu.  I've
created a simple test program which reproduces the problem, so it's not a
QGIS bug:

 I have this terrible compulsion to convert Qt C++ code into Python/Qt
code, so my Python version of Steven's code is here:

http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Geog/Qgis/QT_Fonts_Python.zip<http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/%7Erowlings/Geog/Qgis/QT_Fonts_Python.zip>

[files unzip into current directory so unzip this in a sub-folder of its
own. there's only three files in it]

 unzip, run "python main.py" and if you have PyQt4 it should do the
same as Steven's C++ example - ie on my Ubuntu box show text badly when
scaling small point fonts up to large pixel sizes.

Barry

I added a bit of code which checks the default font size and limits it to a
minimum of 6.  With some settings, we were getting sizes around 3, which was
totally unreadable.  6 may still be too small, but at least it's a little
better.
Also, I think I have fixed a bug which sometimes prevented the addition of
more than one map to the page.

I tried the program and the top text "hello!" is always rendered
not-grabled. The text below, "Simple Hello!" is garbled, until I press
"Zoom In" 4 times. Then it starts looking allright. I'm using QT 4.3.1.
It was the same with 4.3.0. Both built from source. Still on Ubuntu Dapper.

Other map composer issues we have not rised yet:

1. Polygon pattern fills are always rendered wrong in the map composer
in "render" mode. Pattern elements are too thick and spacing between
them is exagerated compared to the display in main QGIS window.
However, polygon patterns look OK in the map composer in "cache" mode.
Yet, in the PDF output polygon patterns are always garbled, like in the
"render" mode. Interestingly, the patern fills in the *legend* box in
map composer are always corrupted, no matter what rendering mode.
Currently, one can't use pattern fills for print/PDF output. QT or QGIS
fault?

2. The distance between layer name and legend classes in the legend box
in the map composer is to small. It is annoying when using national
characters or undescore in map titles (see the attached screendump).

I just rebuilt from source on Ubuntu feisty following directions at

The layer just won't render, no matter what i do.

Hi,

the messages you get here are not the interesting ones - please
recompile QGIS with debugging turned on - then you will get all
messages from QGIS - hopefully also the ones which could lead to the
source of the problem.

Message-ID: <BAY110-W131A607988F9F7FC8A7BADB2B70@phx.gbl>

Hi:
    I have been working in a mysql plugin using ogr provider, reading is now working 
   but I can?t get writing working.  ogrinfo --formats reports mysql (read / write), I registered
   the datasource  with update support with no errors.

   ogrDataSource = OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open(QFile::encodeName(uri).constData(), TRUE, &ogrDriver);

   But the option toggle editing is always deactivated with this kind of datasource

   How is this option activated?

Hi,

QGIS uses TestCapability() method of ogr layer to detect its
capabilities and enables editing only when some of the write
operations are available - so that would mean that mysql driver in OGR
doesn?t support writing - also when looking at its sources it doesn?t
look like it would support it.

Thank you Martin for your answer. I made a program
to test what capabilities is the mysql ogr driver reporting
and it only reports: 

Random Read.
Fast Spatial Filter.
Fast Feature Count.

But there have to be something wrong with the driver capabilities report
because in the same test program I use CreateFeature and it works
but it is not reporting Sequential Write.

Message-ID: <d368056f0709260316u72a1a7a4tba02b36d9191bb64@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers

On Sunday night I tagged the 0.9 release of QGIS.Before Otto and I
make more general announcements it would be great to prepare some
packages. If you are able to, could you please create packages for
your platform of interest. Tisham will be creating the windows
installer and I will build packages for debian etch and ubuntu feisty.
If you are able to build packages please let us know! Also once the
packages are built it would be great to have people tested so as they
become available please drop a note to this list and those whoe are
able to test them send a quick note saying if they worked ok for you
or not.

You can obtain the source for the release by doing:

svn export https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis
https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/Release-0_9_0 qgis-0.9.0

Many thanks once again to all those who work (often fairly
anonymously) behind the scenes to keep QGIS moving forward!

Best regards

Hi :

I sent a mail to gdal-dev list to ask about the testcapabilities of mysql ogr driver
and in effect it is a bug  in the driver, something similar happens to postgresql driver.

Could it be safe to test in ogrprovider if driver is mysql and set the capabilities manually
temporarily until this bug has been fixed?

Best regards
Godofredo Contreras

Message-ID: <d368056f0709261243w6eeaa2abhbe069fbac8ff1b76@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (and especially David and Martin!)

I've been trying to build QGIS on a clean xp mage in parallels. After
too many hassles to mention I have all the deps built or downloaded
and installed. Im following the notes David previously sent to the
list and notes from Mateusz on building Qt with msvc as well as just
groping along in the dark a lot :-)

Trying to compile qgis core I get 332 errors which I must say is some
kind of personal record ;-) Most seem to deal with geos namespace
issues. Do you have any hints on how to resolve that?

Also (for Martin) the search stuff doesnt seem to be compiling (flex / bison).

I would really appreciate any hints on resolving these issues! Full
transcript from msvc express below...

Regards

Tim

Hi All

Ok in follow up to the previos message I discoered I must have copied
in the incorrect version.h into geos....I tweaked that file and all
the geos errors are gone leaving me with (only!) 206 others....

It looks suspiciously like you need to apply my patch I sent to the list a wee 
bit back. I've attached another copy to this message. I've not tried building 
from svn for a while but I'm working on the assumption that nothing has 
changed in the spatial index code since I generated this patch... Give it a 
try and let me know how you get on.

David

Hi Tim,

maybe you have something wrong with path to flex and bison - the lexer
and parser .cpp files have been created or not? (or check whether
you're not missing some DLLs in PATH they need)

I've been able to build and run QGIS with David's patch some time ago,
but I didn't apply it so far to SVN as some things happened to be
still unresolved (and I didn't have time to investigate it further):
- I had problems to apply the patch on linux due some mismatch of
windows and linux line endings
- I couldn't compile QGIS with MinGW with this patch (some problems
with QgsApplication)

But I think we really should sort out the things and make possible to
build QGIS with MSVC without troubles - since next Qt open source
versions will support it too.

Regards
Martin

I think this could be a temporary solution... But it would be wise to
find out from which version of GDAL it supports writing in mysql
driver and don't allow editing for older versions.

Hi David

Ah thanks I thought the patch was applied already. Ok Ill apply it
tomorrow when Im at work and try to resolve the issue Martin mentioned
and then commit it once they are resolved. I wonder if you could
regenerat your path against current trunk to minimise any conflicts I
may run into?

Many thanks

Tim

Hi Martin

Thanks for the tips - Ill check tomorrow to see what files are being
generated and what arent. By the way should I be using flex of flex++?

Hi

Martin in building qgis_core I am left with only one error after
applying Davids patch and fixing some include path issues:

------ Build started: Project: qgis_core, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------
Generating qgssearchstringparser.cpp
Compiling...
qgssearchstringparser.cpp
c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file:
'.\qgssearchstringparser.cpp': No such file or directory
Build log was saved at
"file://c:\dev\cpp\qgis\build\src\core\qgis_core.dir\Debug\BuildLog.htm"
qgis_core - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

Can you give me some hints as to how to go about trying to fix this (
I think it also does not generate the .ll file).

Regards

Hi

Ok forget what I said about missing .ll :-) I managed to get core to
build by copying in the parser.cpp from my mac build tree....would
still be nice to know how to get msvc express to do this automagically
though....

Hi

Great, thanks Douglas! Can you leave them there for a few days? Gary
will need to upload them to the download server but I think he will be
making his way back from the Foss4G2007 conference...

Many thanks!

Yeah; they'll sit in updates-testing for awhile, so I think we should be safe.

OpenSuSE 10.2 and 10.3 packages are available as well, built by Dirk Stoecker
today. You find the repository here:

Thanks a lot Dirk!

I've had a look at the qgis_core project in MSVC. In the CMake Rules 'folder' 
there should be an entry for qgssearchstringparser.cpp.rule. Right click this 
and select properties. Hopefully under Custom Build Setup --> General there 
should be a command line that uses bison to turn qgssearchstringparser.yy 
into qgssearchstringparser.cpp. Not sure how to fix it if this is missing. 
All the flex and bison stuff just worked for me. I'm using bison version 
2.1.2149.21847 that came with the GnuWin bundle. I'm currently building from 
svn just now. I'll let you know how it goes...

OK, it all builds fine for me. Pity about the running though. Seems to be a 
problem with my sqlite: probably linking with the wrong version or something. 
I'll have a look tomorrow...

Hi

For me running failed due to an assert caused by missing projection
icon. This is a path issue in qgisapplication I think and I should be
able to fix it easily enough tomorrow when I get to my dev box. I
applied your patch to svn trunk and tested on mac and linux and they
build fine for me wiht the patch in place so I committed it.

Regards

Tim

My OSX build is now online.  Because of the @loader_path I had to use  
for Python support, it requires a minimum of OSX Tiger (10.4).

Hi Peter,

Unfortunately not, it was just a discussion with Martin on the developer list 
(see http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2007-August/002340.html 
and ...002341.html and 
http://lists.qgis.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2007-September/002355.html)

For vector, thread safety would involve quite some redesign. So if redesign is 
done for raster layer anyway, it would be good to consider thread safety too.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Peter and Tim,

While sitting in the train, I plaied a bit around with the methods 
QgsRasterLayer::drawPallettedMultiBandColor and 
QgsRasterLayer::drawMultiBandColor. I think that some multiplications and 
comparison in the inner loop, which is executed appr. 800000 times during 
each redraw, can be avoided or moved outside the loop. Especially, 
QgsRasterLayer::drawPallettedMultiBandColor was much faster on my PC 
afterwards.

Attached the patch. Please review and test, if I didn't break any existing 
functionality.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Guys

http://www.flickr.com/photos/timlinux/1453754560/

Thats running build with MSVC express. Many thanks for all the help
and especially for Davids great patch. David I committed a small fix
so that the icons etc are found properly so the assert issue is
resolved for me. Its in trunk if you svn update....

There are a number of small issues during the build process I would
like to try to get sorted out - Ill probably make a list next week and
post it here for suggestions to possible fixes.

Best Regards

Tim

Hi Marco

Thanks! There are actually many places we can optimise things. For one
when we have a separate renderer class for each renderer type, we can
avoid a lot of switches...

Peter is now 'Raster Master' so I will defer the patch to him (if
thats ok Peter?).

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <BAY110-W35EDE1C94D11FAB368DF34B2B20@phx.gbl>

Hi:

I just made an svn update and try to compile qgis. I got the following errors:

c:\dev\cpp\qgis\src\app\main.cpp:52: error: redefinition of `int _fmode'
c:\dev\cpp\qgis\src\app\main.cpp:46: error: `int _fmode' previously defined here

It seems like the directive #undef _fmode does not undefine the variable.

Best regards

Hi Godofredo

Thats probably because of me applying Davids msvc patch. Could you try
to wrap that in an MSVC ifdef and see if that fixes the problem for
you?

If it does feel free to commit.

Thanks

I don't think lines 45 to 48 (#ifdef MSVC to #endif) should be there. We only 
want to set _fmode directly like this if we are *not* building with visual 
studio. This is handled by the #ifndef _MSC_VER block.

OK, tried that and I'm also using the correct sqlite version for my build. It 
all builds and runs properly now. At least I can load the sample data from 
the QGIS website...

OK, I'll look out for that.

Message-ID: <BAY110-W19B093145AB87C362FFEC0B2B30@phx.gbl>

Hi:
    I was testing wms support with DM solutions server in a windows machine and
    I found the following:
 
   1.-Even when the server supports several formats only png is shown.
 
     Checking the debug information I found that even when QT documentation
     says that the following formats are supported by default:
           




BMP

Windows Bitmap



GIF

Graphic Interchange Format (optional)


JPG

Joint Photographic Experts Group


JPEG

Joint Photographic Experts Group


MNG

Multiple-image Network Graphics


PNG

Portable Network Graphics


PBM

Portable Bitmap


PGM

Portable Graymap


PPM

Portable Pixmap


XBM

X11 Bitmap


XPM

X11 Pixmap
 
      QImageReader::SuportedImageReaders() does not return GIF(should be enabled), JPG and JPEG.
 
       I think that getting wms images as gif and jpg are important.
 
  2.- Map canvas is not repainted after a wms request is complete.
 
Best regards
 
Godofredo Contreras

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [patch] rubberband extension
Message-ID: <20070929183135.GA15191@norbit.de>

Hi there,

attached patch adds the ability to query the points currently in a
QgsRubberBand and to remove the last.

I use this in a plugin to avoid the need to keep track of the selected
points twice and to be able to take back the last entered point from a
context menu.

QgsMapToolCapture should probably be updated accordingly, but didn't find the
time yet.

Hi

Marco are you going to look at this? It might be best to pass down the
line to Martin Dobias since the rubber band stuff was done by hime
wasnt it?

Hi

If qimagereader does not report gf being available it may be your Qt
compilation that is missing support for it?

Could you add you isses to trac? Let me know if you need an account (but I
think you should have access alreaady since you have svn access).

Regards

Tim
