Hi Nathan,

Thanks for the feedback! As far as I recall, we currently don't use
the bin anywhere, right? I'd expect Robert has his reasons why.
Do we agree that the current suggested icon is better than what's in
QGIS right now? Maybe we can take it step by step and for 2.6 at least
include this one improvement before we start the more general
discussion if there should be an X or a trash can?

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.4 and 2.5: default transparency for select
	not honored?
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw2DyC7y9+up5ban8SwHjJmj5HYQCzZHj_V=tTANqn=8ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I found a problem with QGIS 2.4 and 2.5 yesterday build.

When you set the defeult the color for selections and you set the
alpha channel (i.e. to 25%), at next QGIS startup only the color
(without the alpha channel) is taken, until you modify the alpha
channel from the project options window.

To reproduce it:

 1. open qgis with empty project
 2. set the select color with transparency
 3. close qgis
 4. reopen qgis
 5. load some layers
 6. select one geometry: you'll see that the transparency value is
totally ignored
 7. set the transparency from the options
 8. now the selection is transparent

happens on both 2.4 and 2.5

Hi all,

don't know if the question is right placed here. 
In QGIS in the "Add WMS" dialog on tab "Search for Server" you can put in 
some keywords and get a list of WMS matching this topic. How could a WMS 
becomes a member of this resultlist?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Request for feature freeze exemption
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashx3WDgx3+=3oiVeiP=OZDnuczdbxV3h96MiZKcCcuUeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just posted a pull request #1601, which I'd like considered for
an exemption for feature freeze for 2.6. As mentioned in the PR:

What this feature does is add an option in the view menu for
compositions to hide the bounding boxes of the currently selected
feature. It's a standard feature in design programs as it allows you
to tweak the size and position of items and see exactly what the
result is without the bounding boxes / mouse resize handles getting in
the way.

Reasons for an exemption:

- the code is self contained, it has no impact on any other code
areas, so it's very low risk
- I know this part of the code base backwards - these changes don't
introduce any regressions
- it's a really handy feature to have and it's ready to go

Please consider merging this if you think a FFE is acceptable.

Cheers,
Nyall

Hi all,

It would be nice to have the same interface for data defined properties 
in the 'Style' widget and in the 'Labels' widget.

The 'Labels' widget has a small icon on the side of each property that 
allows to specify a field or expression. The 'Style' widget has the 
'Advanced' combobox and the 'Symbol selector' has the big button 'Data 
defined properties...'

The 'Labels' small icon is my preferred option. It could be added beside 
the symbol selector properties. This would replace both the 'Advanced' 
comboboxes and 'Data defined properties...' button.

A step further would be to link this icon with the text/button/combo of 
the property it's related to. If the text/button/combo is big enough, 
the field/expression could take its place (easier to see than overing 
over the yellowed icon). If the text/button/combo is too small, it could 
be grayed out.

I would be happy to have your feedback.

V.

Hey Vincent,

This is the plan as far as I know.  Both features landed by two different
devs at the same time so it would be good to unify them now that the base
code is good.

Message-ID: <CAMCJChtRjjd480v+CUnhy5q4pjjfwynn3+80gLJ+v5VXxVc5kw@mail.gmail.com>

It seems that there were changes in warning messages in QGIS master.

When trying to copy features from a PostGIS layer in QGIS master to
another, in the moment of pasting to the destination layer, I get the
warning message "Paste features: no features could be succesfully pasted.",
however it does not show the reason.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/warning_message_qgis_25.jpg

In previous versions (2.2 and 2.4), QGIS handled this issue differently. It
allowed pasting and only when saving showed the error message with details
(violation of the unique constraint on the primary key field).

This change was intentional or can be considered a bug?

Hi,

Now copy/paste tries to convert geometries to match layer destination. So,
you probably had incompatible geometries like trying to paste lines in a
point layer.

I can try to provide a better feedback, but as I remember it was not so
easy.

Greetings

Not in this case. Both layers were geometry (MultiLineString,20790).

In previous versions the only problem that the warning message showed was a
violation of the PK constraint (as you can see in the images). And, in
fact, after that I did the job in QGIS master DB Manager, with an insert
into and select, skiping the PK field (serial), and it worked well.

Tested with today's QGIS master from OSGeo4W (64bits).

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS and South Oriented CRS
Message-ID: <542C1FF3.8030304@geograph.co.za>

Hi Devs,
Gavin & I have swapped a few emails discussing this, and would like to 
get a wider opinion as to whether it is a QGIS error, or not.
QGIS version in use by me, as per attached screenshot.

*The problem:*

    If I read in a CSV layer that uses South Oriented CRS, then QGIS
    displays this layer "mirrored" even after telling QGIS what the
    applicable layer CRS is.
    Furthermore, when I move the mouse downwards or to the left, the
    coordinate readout values decreases instead of increases.
    In short, if I work in a South Oriented CRS, I must deal with an
    inverted picture or an incorrect coord readout.
    Is this correct behaviour for QGIS?

*_To test:_*
*
Fixed test parameters:*

  * Always start with a "new" QGIS so that only default project settings
    are "set". (EPSG:4326 but 'on the fly CRS' off)
  * Only load the CSV file so that there are no other map layers to to
    contend (CRS wise) with.
  * The absolute position (on earth) of the test data is not important -
    we are looking to see that QGIS displays the points
    correctly_relative to each other_, and that the coordinate readout
    is correctly increasing South and Westwards.
  * Use only the two following CRS (note the only difference is the axis
    parameter)
    *EPSG:2048* is      +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=19 +k=1 +x_0=0
    +y_0=0 *+axis=wsu* +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs
    *USER:100004* is +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=19 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
    *+axis=enu* +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs
      o *Testdata:*
        The coords below should be EPSG:2053 - in other words, the South
        Africa Land Survey coord system, which is essentially a distance
        from the central meridian (19E in this case) and a distance from
        the Equator (some 3769Km in this case). Note that the further
        South you go, the larger the '3769xxx' value gets (ie: South facing)

            A,19961.49,3769105.30
            B,19902.64,3769135.18
            C,19899.91,3769132.99
            L,20095.87,3769783.70

        The relative positions of these 4 values ("in real life") are: 
        A at the top, B and C  Eastish of A (but B below [South] of C)
        and L far below A and slightly to the West of A (see attached
        'correct_orientation.jpg')

*Test results:*

  * Open QGIS, add delimited text layer and specify its CRS to be
    EPSG:2048, keep Project CRS on the fly "off".
    Result:

        Image is inverted (A is South of L) and B & C are West of A.
        Coordinate values are both +ve numbers and mouse position coords
        decrease to West and South

  * Using above data, Set Project CRS (on the fly = YES) to same EPSG:2048
    Result:

        No change from above.

  * Simply change Project CRS to EPSG:100004 as defined earlier in this
    email.
    Result:

        Image orientation is now correct BUT
        Mouse coords readout shows -ve coord values, and these values
        still (numerically) DECREASE towards the West and South.

*Start with a "new" QGIS* (to pedantically make certain that no CRS 
functionality is left over from above tests)

  * Open QGIS, add _the same_ delimited text layer and specify its CRS
    to be EPSG:100004, keep Project CRS on the fly "off".
    Result:

        Image is inverted (A is South of L) and B & C are West of A.
        Coordinate values are both +ve numbers and mouse position coords
        decrease to West and South

  * Using above data, Set Project CRS (on the fly = YES) to same EPSG:100004
    Result:

        No change from above.

  * Simply change Project CRS to EPSG:2048 as defined earlier in this email.
    Result:

        Image orientation is now correct BUT
        Mouse coords readout shows -ve coord values, and these values
        still (numerically) DECREASE towards the West and South.

*To close:*

If I redo both the above tests but set Project CRS before importing the 
CSV layer, there is (of course) no change to the results.
Even though I was not expecting changes to some of the above test 
permutations, I did them all in order to pedantically wipe out any 
unexpected behaviour.


So, Why am I not able to work in my desired CRS orientation when using QGIS?
Is this a bug, or is it some feature that most likely may be worth 
implementing?

Regards to all,
Zoltan

Hi all,

I am trying to build QGIS on Mac OS Mavericks and I am having troubles with QScintilla.

While compiling, I reach this error

Although, it exists in /usr/local/include/Qsci

and I used the following in cmake: -D QSCI_SIP_DIR=/usr/local/include/Qsci

Anybody has an idea what to look for ?

Thanks a lot,q

Message-ID: <CAM8PBg+Bf1OAQxr5WOYKnjjkZVrcDBMdxY2cJNoaP1GV+ijJtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using QGIS 2.4 and QGIS 2.5 b044d4d on OS-X. I am trying to edit a
point layer that is being served out as WFS 1.3 from GeoServer 2.5. When I
try to edit attributes or the geometry, I get an error that says:

Could not commit changes to <layername> (I tried a couple).
Errors: ERROR: 1 geometries not changed
 Provider errors: empty response.

However, I'm able to see that the new edit successfully saved in GeoServer.
If I remove the layer and add it again in QGIS then the update is there.

The WFS I am using works with a mobile app and with OpenLayers 3 so I'm
pretty sure the service is functioning properly.

Any ideas on troubleshooting?

Thanks,

Scott

FYI,  I will be funding that very soon, as a consultation is on here about
homogeneizing those style interfaces, focusing on a more clear and
functional UI for size varying analyses, and finally implement legend for
size varying items. 
I think that will be a good topic at the hackfest, the consultation ends few
days after Essen. 
Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant represents a mapped type and
	cannot be instantiated
Message-ID: <CAHpqhBM_zQ6NAm8su0arUz1T7piBDCdZRgAgErrvsF=+D=ddoA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a qgis python plugin and have encountered a curious problem.
I've successfully tested the plugin's dialog standalone via ipython.
However, I get the following error when I try to execute the same code from
within qgis: "PyQt4.QtCore.QVariant represents a mapped type and cannot be
instantiated".

The error occurs from within a QAbstractTableModel subclass, specifically
the headerData function, which is given below:

    def headerData(self, section, orientation, role):
        if role == Qt.DisplayRole :
            if orientation == Qt.Horizontal :
                return QVariant(self.headers[section])
            elif orientation == Qt.Vertical :
                return QVariant(self.events[section].categoryID)
        return QVariant()

As far as I can tell, that's pretty much textbook PyQt.  I've found a similar
problem
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10382025/qvariant-in-qcombobox-python-2-vs-python-3>,
but that was a python 2 vs. 3 scenario, and this is all within the python
2.7.1 domain.

I've tried to code up a workaround where I just return empty strings and
that leads to all sorts of havok.  The table is rendered, but the header
columns are missing and there are undesired check boxes in all the table
cells.

Has anyone else encountered this problem?  Or otherwise knows what's going
on?

Cheers!

Mark

Your answer is here: 
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20

QVariant is no longer present in QGIS since we use the sip 2.0 api.
Use regular strings rather than a QVariant.

I found this thread very helpful.  It seems to be that to the dialog into edit mode this has to be done programmatically by calling startEditing() - not by simply having the layer in edit mode.   Can anyone else verify that?   Regardless, thanks for the pointers and suggestions in the thread. Much appreciated.

That is, after accepting the dialog, it adds a new feature, and does not update my temporary feature. This leaves no room for any changes before the feature commit. I described my problem in the following bug report, and Matthias Kuhn adviced me to create my own Dialog, so that's what I'm trying to do. I would be glad to use iface.openFeatureForm() only

Hi Susann,

i was wondering about that too, so I had a look:
Under Options -> Network: General there is the field "WMS search address"  
http://geopole.org/wms/search?search=%1&type=rss

On http://geopole.org/about, you can find in the last line "Copyright (c)  
2008-2010 by Sourcepole AG" with a link to http://www.sourcepole.com/

Obviously this service is not really maintained (2008-2010) and indeed  
there hasn't been a lot of changes for a long time.
So maybe you can contact the guys and ask them what to do to get listed.

Cheers
Bernd

Hi Martin,

I was wondering if you could maybe have a look at the snippet related to
legend use in PyQGIS and update it for the new legend implementation?

Thanks a lot!

Hi Pedro,

As said, copy/paste only tries to convert geometries and will paste if possible.

Foreign key violation is only detected by Postgis, so the reason why QGIS is not actually pasting is not due to a FKey violation.

Do you have a debugging environment or can you provide some demo data?

Best wishes,

Denis

Hi, there is a small change in simplification code to fix the bug #10767 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10767):

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/eaacb125c402cf22dd66482b313bdaef73791fea

Can you test QGIS before this commit ?

Best regards
Alvaro

Asunto: Re: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.5 vs 2.4 rendering mode

See attached screen shots. It takes 15 seconds to render all the area.
With 2.2 or 2.4 release there?s no step like this during rendering an it takes 5 seconds for same area / same data?

Hi,

Doing some test on 2.5.
I?m a little bit surprised by rendering mode between 2.5 and 2.4. Is there any change?
First QGIS 2.5 is slower than 2.4 with same data. And rendering mode looks  like an impressionist  painter drawing randomly small area on canvas for vector and draw pixels for raster, both before full rendering  correctly done?

Os is Win7

I'm posting a follow up here on the odd chance that someone else has the
same problem and greps for it on this mailing list.  I'm relatively new to
python-based qgis plugins, and found that most of the extant documentation
for PyQt was for sip 1.0 api; and, worse yet, there was no mention that
there were two versions.  So it's very, very easy for a newbie to fall into
the same trap I did.

First, the link you provided was helpful except with regards to situations
where a **null, or empty, QVariant** was returned.  I found that returning
empty strings and empty lists yielded all manner of strange and
counter-intuitive behavior for my table.  I.e., both horizontal and
vertical headers were missing altogether, and the cells were mysteriously
populated with uncheckable check boxes.  The solution was simple: return
None.  I would have done that *first*, but read somewhere that that
wouldn't work.  :(

So, for future reference for those wanting to do this same thing as I was,
that is creating a Qt table from a model for use within qgis, here's a
stripped down version of my class:

from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore, Qt
from PyQt4.QtCore import Qt, QDateTime

from Event import Event


class Events(QtCore.QAbstractTableModel) :

    # column headers
    headers = ['Created', 'Name', 'Description']

    def __init__(self, parent = None):
        super(Events, self).__init__(parent)
        self.events = []


    def rowCount(self, parent=QtCore.QModelIndex()) :
        return len(self.events)


    def columnCount(self, parent=QtCore.QModelIndex()) :
        return len(self.headers)


    def data(self, index, role) :
        if not index.isValid() :
            return None #With sip v 1.0 used to be QVariant()
        elif role != Qt.DisplayRole :
            return None

        if index.column() == 1 :
            return self.events[index.row()].name
        elif index.column() == 2 :
            return self.events[index.row()].description
        elif index.column() == 0 :
            return
QDateTime.fromMSecsSinceEpoch(self.events[index.row()].created)
        return None


    def headerData(self, section, orientation, role):
        if role == Qt.DisplayRole :
            if orientation == Qt.Horizontal :
                return self.headers[section]
            elif orientation == Qt.Vertical :
                return str(self.events[section].categoryID)
        return None

    def addEvent(self, categoryID, name, description = '', created = 0) :
        self.events.append( Event( name, description, categoryID, created )
)


I did find a way to force ipython to use sip 2.0, which was particularly
useful for when I wanted to test the dialog standalone.  In my
"~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py" I placed the following:

import sip
try:
    sip.setapi('QDate', 2)
    sip.setapi('QDateTime', 2)
    sip.setapi('QString', 2)
    sip.setapi('QtextStream', 2)
    sip.setapi('Qtime', 2)
    sip.setapi('QUrl', 2)
    sip.setapi('QVariant', 2)
except ValueError, e:
    raise RuntimeError('Could not set API version (%s): did you import
PyQt4 directly?' % e)


So, while in ipython I could use the "gui qt" command and The Right Thing
would happen: sip 2.0 would be used, so I could then test within the proper
sip API context.  (H/t to
http://cyrille.rossant.net/making-pyqt4-pyside-and-ipython-work-together/)

Hopefully someone out there at sometime will find this useful!

Cheers,

Mark

I found that I had to invoke the feature form myself to get the form into edit mode.

	layer.startEditing()
        self.iface.openFeatureForm(layer, feature, True) 

It was not enough to invoke startEditing from within the feature form init method.

Am not sure if this is by design.

Hi Denis,

I just tested on Linux, with two simple shapefiles (attached), with only
two lines each. Making a copy of the shapefiles, all goes well.

If you import the shapefiles to postgis (with dbmanager) to
multilinestring, they stay with equal pkeys. When I do the copy / paste
(which worked fine with the same data in shapefile format), QGIS shows the
warning message "Paste features: no features could be successfully
pasted.". Running QGIS with GNU gdb, does not appear any error at the time
the warning is shown.

I also tested this with points, multipoints, and Multipolygons, and the
same happens.

The proof that I believe show that the problem is in primary key is:

importing the two layers attached to the postgis with dbmanager, you get

layer_1
id_0* | id | desc
1 | 1 | 1
2 | 2 | 2

layer_2
id_0* | id | desc
1 | 1 | 1
2 | 2 | 2

*pkey

If I delete the second line of layer_2, and copy the second line of layer_1
and paste on layer_2, it already works, and layer_2 becomes:

layer_2
id_0* | id | desc
1 | 1 | 1
3 | 2 | 2

(id_0 is 3 because of the sequence).

The only explanation I find for this behavior is QGIS verify the violation
of unique constraint of pkey field id_0, and launch the warning and prevent
the pasting.

What do you think?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

Here's a crude PHP script to login and upload your <plugin>.zip file when it's been updated.

Requires libcurl

https://github.com/nzfarmer1/qgisplugintools/blob/master/upload.php


p.s. have just made a new release of TelemetryLayer - starting to get down to a short list issues that could use a more experienced plugin developer if anyone's keen ... ?  :)

QGIS is not pasting the field of the primary key to avoid conflict.

I am not sure to understand your problem.

I tested with two postgis layers having a primary key. In both layers, I have a feature with pkey = 1. I copy/paste from layer 1 to layer 2, and at end I have two features in layer 2, one with pkey= 1 and the second with pkwy =2.

paste was successful.

Could you provide a small dump of your postgis layers and the exact steps to reproduce?

Hi Denis,

This is even more strange. "Paste features: no features could be
successfully pasted." warning only appears when selecting more than one
feature. Please see the screencast:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/copy_paste/qgis_copy_paste.avi

Test data:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/copy_paste/tables2.sql

Thanks!

Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbology api
Message-ID: <542E840B.2050501@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

While thinking about the interface of categorized and graduated 
symbology with varying size (instead of color) I had an idea to reduce 
the code complexity in src/core/symbology-ng (~15% less code).

Since it changes the symbology API, I'd like your input on that:

At the moment we deal with categorized, graduated, rule-based and single 
symbol with different classes.

At the same time the single symbol allows to use expressions for all 
symbol properties.

We can use expressions to make the single symbol layer behave:
- graduated : properties are continuous functions of attributes,
- categorized or rule based : properties are discrete function of 
attributes

The user interfaces for categorized, graduated, rule-based could remain 
the same, it's just that it would generate the expressions for the 
single symbol instead of configuring as specific class. Several 
categories could be defined to affect various parameters (color and size 
are the first use case).

Can you tell me if the idea is sound ?

V.



PS: (implementation detail)

Data defined properties are treated as a special case in the symbology 
classes.

Since a constant is a valid expression, why not avoid this special 
treatment and have properties being always expressions in the symbology 
classes ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error NetCDF on qgis_mapserver
Message-ID: <CAO-ZED_41_+J-+uZfRWT7J7bkKjkFa5AtW4hQpw91GkM3cWN3g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was trying to use a qgis project in qgis_mapserver following a tutorial.
The project with simple layers using shape files works fine!! But when I
tried to use a project with NetCDF raster layer, it no shows and apache
complaint about netcdfdataset.cpp:

/var/log/apache2/error.log
ERROR 1: netcdf error #-33 : NetCDF: Not a valid ID .
at (netcdfdataset.cpp,~netCDFDataset,1549)

Is that a problem with qgis_mapserver compilation? Is there some compiled
with theses libraries?

regards,

Feel free to see a working example in the latest release of TelemetryLayer

https://github.com/nzfarmer1/telemetrylayer/blob/master/tlbrokerconfig.py  (Line : 143)

If you install the plugin you can see it working by double clicking a group in the legend.

There's also an example showing how to wrap the dialog init within a class with state and to reflect dynamic changes made to the features while the dialog is open

https://github.com/nzfarmer1/telemetrylayer/blob/master/featureforms/editformfactory.py
https://github.com/nzfarmer1/telemetrylayer/blob/master/tltopicmanager.py

(Code's a bit rough as this is a work in progress)

Message-ID: <CAL5Q672yj3+vPz6GZRGh_8tMvn_p6jA3Q1jj57p6nszc2xqyoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

this afternoon at the HF in Essen we had a meeting about my proposal
to implement python plugins for the server side

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/4

I've collected your comments and finalized the proposal with the more
complete implementation, that will offer much more flexibility for
plugins to implement new features and modify existing ones.

If you like you can read the slides online here:
http://www.itopen.it/qgis-server-plugins/

The RFC is now open for voting, please give some feed-back!

Thanks!

Interesting idea.

At the moment the graduated renderer colour is also a discrete function of attributes.  Changing to a continuous function (or having a continuous function alternative) would mean changing the legend interface somewhat.

I've been thinking about how to better implement the Vector Field Renderer plugin (written before expression based renderering, uses a python renderer) and I'm thinking that it only needs a few more expression based properties in the symbology to be able to replace the python rendering (independent x,y scaling and offset of symbols, and an x,y offset or more simply just an affine transformation maybe).  Also (if it is not already present) some functions for determining map scale in expressions.

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbology api

Hi all,

While thinking about the interface of categorized and graduated
symbology with varying size (instead of color) I had an idea to reduce
the code complexity in src/core/symbology-ng (~15% less code).

Since it changes the symbology API, I'd like your input on that:

At the moment we deal with categorized, graduated, rule-based and single
symbol with different classes.

At the same time the single symbol allows to use expressions for all
symbol properties.

We can use expressions to make the single symbol layer behave:
- graduated : properties are continuous functions of attributes,
- categorized or rule based : properties are discrete function of
attributes

The user interfaces for categorized, graduated, rule-based could remain
the same, it's just that it would generate the expressions for the
single symbol instead of configuring as specific class. Several
categories could be defined to affect various parameters (color and size
are the first use case).

Can you tell me if the idea is sound ?

V.



PS: (implementation detail)

Data defined properties are treated as a special case in the symbology
classes.

Since a constant is a valid expression, why not avoid this special
treatment and have properties being always expressions in the symbology
classes ?

If I understand correctly, you propose to use single symbol renderer
with expressions (for color and for size) in places where we currently
use graduated/categorized renderers. Is that correct? If it is, how
would it handle the case where symbols of individual classes are
completely different? (not just varying in size/color)

It would be also good to check the impact on the rendering performance
- maybe if more than just few classes are used, the evaluation with
expressions could slow things down significantly. (the expression
engine could enjoy some performance improvements).

Martin

Message-ID: <CAGvsbY6+VPAO3JZjcuUEvsYYfGpK_Z84UF-RN6UEq6v=xb=15Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I think that I've found a possible bug in Composer.

I created a composer, I added a map, and I saved "Main properties" like
"Cache".
Then Save the project, close, and then when I open in Main properties
convert to "Rectangle"!
This produces that the map doesn't show correctly.

Is it a bug??
Should I open a ticket?

Best regards,

Hi Carlos,

There's an existing issue for this:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6085

Unfortunately it's caused by a bug in the Qt libraries, so we need to wait
until it is fixed upstream.

Cheers,
Nyall

Hi,

Some problems with OSGeo4W nightly:

Unable to load GdalTools plugin.
The required "osgeo [python-gdal]" module is missing.
Install it and try again.

In the OSGeo4W installer, there is no python-gdal, only gdal-python and  
it's installed in version 1.11.1-1.

This breaks the Gdal Tools plugin.

Additionally, I also get an error related to Processing and mission osgeo

I'm sorry, but I also have no clue about the voting process, I just
understood that I had to make a pull request for the RFC and that's
what I did.

Maybe a +/- 1/0 on the mailing list would be sufficient.

Yes a vote here or on the pull request is fine.  Only PSC votes count
towards a pass and fail.

The slides dont say nothing about the optionality of this.

Should be possible to disable all the python side using some compile settings ?
like

"disable-python-server-side" ?

Or enable it only for speciic project.

So avoid to have more insances.
Something with python capability and other without python capability ?

Aso a last question is the accounting.

At least of lesser site, the usual user accounting is using
single-sign-on solutions with https.
Is this supported ?.

Obviously it should supported directly from qgis-server otherwise it
is exposed to the

"man in the middle attack."

Of course yes.

This could be easily implemented at the webserver level or directly
inside the plugins in case of need.

The plugin support has no direct implications with authentication or
authorization. What the plugins will implement (and how they'll do it)
is far beyond the scope of my RFC.

Disclosure: I am currently working for Boundless, helping with their new
QGIS support offering [0].

While the Boundless QGIS OS X package is standalone, offering a nice
drag-drop install, there are several reasons why the QGIS project may not
wish to rely upon it for its general OS X release.

* It is branded as a third-party distribution (see splash screen).

* It is produced by a commercial third-party entity using their resources
and on their schedule.

* It may be built from custom branches that include interim features not
present in the official releases.

Each of these points makes sense for an entity looking to make inroads
towards enterprise adoption of QGIS, but are not, or may not be, in line
with the QGIS project's goals, per se.

There may also be the appearance of a conflict of interest, or unfair
advantage, if QGIS releases for any OS come from a particular commercial
entity who offers paid support. However, this does seem to work with
Canonical and Ubuntu, for example.

If the PSC wishes so, I could offer to be a liaison with Boundless and
present such a OS X general release proposal to them.


With regards as to the reason why the Boundless QGIS offering is a nice,
tidy package, it stems from the work their packager, Michael Weisman, has
done. After the release of 2.6, I believe he and I will look at how to push
his CMake bundling changes (using CMake's BundleUtilities [2]) upstream to
master. Once such a bundling setup is in core, anyone can produce a
standalone QGIS bundle from the standard source tree, including the QGIS
project itself.

For the past year or so, I have been working on a project towards this
goal, OSGe4Mac [3]. Based upon the Homebrew Mac OS X packager [4] (e.g.
apt-get for Mac), it allows for quickly building all QGIS dependencies, in
support for bundling and other goals. This will have the following
advantages:

* QGIS stable and nightlies can readily be built, packaged and released on
OSGeo resources, by any Mac developer.

* Dependencies can quickly be provisioned to a Mac OS X virtual machine for
continuous integration setups.

* A fairly complete OSGeo toolset can be released as a single DMG (Mac disk
image), aiding workshops, etc.

* An OSGeo4Mac installer (very similar to OSGeo4W) can be built off of Qt's
Installer framework [5] to do on-line or locally distributed Mac OS X
installs.

Towards this goal, I have been in contact with the OSGeo System
Administration Committee chair, Alex Mandel, about setting up a **Mac build
server**. I am willing to donate all of the necessary Mac OS X software and
pre-configured virtual machines (all the work I am already doing on my Macs
for the QGIS nightlies).

Would the QGIS PSC be interested in providing any financial support towards
buying a Mac Mini build server for OSGeo, used initially for building QGIS?
Anything in the $1,000-2,000 USD range would greatly help out. I will be
adding the proposal to the 2014 infrastructure plan [6].

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [HackFest] Synthesis of fTools discussion
Message-ID: <1446268.78UpBWITTQ@tatras>

Hello,

We had a discussion about the futur of ftools plugins here at Essen. This 
email aims to sum up the discussion to get more feedback.

# Some Context

Camptocamp wants to contribute to the ftools plugin for one of our customer. 
We have some issues on this plugin on which we want to work on with the 
community.

The community (Victor and Alexander mostly I guess, may be other dev) worked 
to port ftools feature into processing. 

We have now two parts of code to maintain.

# Issues

* Interface improvement
* performance issue
* missing feature in processing algorithme
* translatable algorithme

# Interface improvement

Tim worked on this for the inasafe project in order to improve ui in 
processing. There are also some possibilities to create custom interface for 
each algorithm.

# Performance issue

The Python code could be improved to get better performance. Some other 
possibilities could be to port the code to C library or to use GEOS library 
(Martin tested this with some good performance improvement).

# Missing features

This is not a technology problem, just need some love from someone. As soon as 
all feature from ftools will be in processing plugin we can think about the 
futur of ftools: do we need to completly remove it or to plug-in ftools 
features to processing one, or other? Though?

# Translation

Thanks to Alexander, the processing plugin is now translatable, just need some 
love from our translator community after updating transifex.

I hope my synthesis is not wrong or misleading, please correct me in this 
case. All comments are welcome.

Y.

Actually almost all fTools algoritms already available via Processing,
only few are
"missed". This "missed" algs now also ported, but not commited into
master because
of feature freeze.

Just remebered that some fTools algorithms were ported to C++ by Carson Farmer
(original fTools author) several years ago. One can find this
algorithms in QGIS analysis
library, look at QgsOverlayAnalyzer [0] and QgsGeometryAnalyzer [1].
Maybe it is better
to update this code instead of writing new one.

As I said, almost all fTools functionality already available and
missed algorithms
are ready to merge.

Regarding fTools (and maybe GDAL Tools) removal, I think we need to wait until
Processing can completely replace this plugins.

+1 for the observer pattern. Having the ability to install "middlewares"
within the flow would be great. In this case I would suggest to consider
the opportunity to choose the plugin execution order (i.e. plugin1 request
processing should happen before plugin2, etc.).

+0 in case of the 404 method is employed. In this case I prefer to use an
app out of qgis server...

And not allow to have one unique URL for all the services.

This is good for who have one only service, but not good for who plan to 
serve many services.

IMHO the interface for most modules is almost on par right now
(Processing vs fTools), so this should not be preventing replacement.
What is probably more impacting on the final user is the arrangement
of menus, as fTools is more structured and probably easier to navigate
for those who do not know the name and use of different commands.
Maybe this could be solved with:
* alternative, more hierarchical menus, replicating fTools
arrangement; this could be added as an alternative tab, see the GRASS
plugin toolbox for an example
* as mentioned in the meeting, adding visual hints about the functions
of each module (again, a rather rough example can be found in the
GRASS toolbox), so users can understand more quickly the meaning of
each tool.
In any case, I think working for an improved Processing is more
effective than further investing in fTools.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgCOYOmLy97iUGSr3GCcAc6TneQtxa2JvCJZYe3GEgyWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just submitted a new QEP proposal, regarding stricter
requirements for unit testing for core changes:

 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/7

This proposal is aimed at providing more stable releases and
preventing regressions in QGIS releases by expanding the coverage of
unit tests and adopting a hard line approach to compulsory unit tests.

Discussion welcome!

Dear Nathan,
have you found some time to work on the map swipe QGIS plugin?
I would be happy to help developing the plugin or testing it, if you like?
Do you have a public source code repository, so that i can start to
study your code?


Best regards
Soeren

Yes, it is correct. Although the marker, which can be composed of 
several simple symbols, seems to be a better base.

A discrete function can handle the shape (it is already a parameter that 
can be defined by an expression). A little complexity comes with 
composed symbols (markers): in a given layer, different markers (from 
different classes) may be composed of a different number of symbols, but 
if we handle the 'null' case for the shape, then the number of symbols 
for a marker is only a max, and markers with less symbols will be 
handled just fine.

The performance issue is definitely a concern.

I can think of some strategies to avoid a systematic evaluation of 
expressions for all features, but they imply some sort of 
classification, so I'm not sure it's a net gain on the code complexity 
front. So I would prefer keeping the approach simple (i.e. evaluate 
expressions for all features) and profile the code to see if expression 
evaluation can be improved.

I've made a preliminary test with graduated color (5 classes) one the 
one hand and continuous color defined by expression on the other hand. 
For 250k points, this gives roughly a factor 2 loss for rendering time 
(5sec for graduated, 10sec for expressions). I think this is rather 
encouraging.

Do you think this 2x loss is a killer for this approach (considering the 
improvements that can be made to expression evaluation) ?

Message-ID: <op.xm9kpdr4na7rjy@anita-pc.local>

Hi,

I'm trying to use one of the examples from the PyQGIS Cookbook to render a  
map at custom resolution:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/composer.html#simple-rendering

While the layers render fine, no labels are drawn. Do you know how I can  
add labels to the output?

I tried

render.setLabelingEngine(QgsPalLabeling())

but no luck.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Here's a small script you can use to test the Python bindings for labeling
[0]. It is intended to be run from within the PyQGIS console's script
editor, and uses the Spatialite db for labeling unit tests, called '
pal_features_v3.sqlite' [1].

Setup:

* Load the 'background' layer
* Load the 'point' layer on top of 'background'
* Select the 'point' layer in the legend
* Open script in console's editor and run it

When script is run, you should end up with something like this [2],
probably with different fill color for 'background'.

See the Python labeling test suite for more examples, from
'test_qgspallabeling_*.py' [3], specifically the
'test_qgspallabeling_tests.py' file.

Feel free to add this to the Cookbook. However, the API for labeling may
change during the 2.7 dev cycle, if rule- and style-based labeling is
introduced.

Hi Martin,

Before the refactoring, a newly added layer was automatically the active  
layer. This is not the case with the new legend. Was this a conscious  
decision? From a user standpoint, the previous behavior made more sense:  
Now, after adding the layer, I have to click it in the layer list before I  
can open the attribute table or do anything else with e.g. the toolbar  
tools.

Should I open a ticket?

Best wishes,
Anita

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9hiWQo77c2_Pq+kJwPfYvOTaKCKh6S9V=gMZfY43eSUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I would like to get some opinions on how the currently QLR feature in 2.4
works.  Currently the QLR will have absolute paths if the project is set to
have them, or relative if the project is set in that mode.
I'm not sure I really like this as it's a bit magic with what you will get
and means you can't make a relative QLR from a absolute path based project.

Do you think this needs to be an option for each QLR when saving?

Hi Nyall

Sorry for the late reply. In case you want to add the changes in
Processing, the most important ones are.

- New modeler. The modeler has been rewritten, and now provides extra
functionality such as allowing nested models with no depth limit. Models
are now stored as JSON files. Backwards compatibility is kept, so all
models can still be used.
-On-line collection of models and scripts. Models and scripts can be
downloaded from the online collection and installed directly from the
Processing interface. The collection will be expanded with new scripts and
models provided by Processing users.

Let me know if you need something else.

Cheers

Hi Victor,
Can you provide the link to the collection? Are there instructions in
place that tell users how to share scripts/models?

Hi Nathan,

I think absoluth path projects and relative projects(!) have different
use-cases. I prefer relative paths, but in organisations with one huge
data-disk, maybe absoluth paths are preferable so project/qlr files can
be moved around easily.

My idea is that one of both is preferred by a user, so one of the
options (relative/absolute) is more or less standard for that user.

Adding an extra option to switch (for a non 'standard' situation) adds
extra option stress. While if clearly documented (or shown in dialog)
that a relative project breeds relative QLR files and vv can be enough?

Then IF a user want a custom type of QLR he/she can create a temp
project for it, change that to the preferred option and create a qlr
with that....

So my stand: keep the dialogs simple (for most common use cases),
especially as there is already a way to do the thing you want to keep an
option for.

See what others think of this.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Or preferably a link to a documentation section and some sexy
screendumps so we will have a shiny changelog like
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog240/index.html
again :-)

Hello,

Sorry if I repeat my question that I sent some time ago,  but it seems
very relevant
to the topic.

I noticed that using  the    .render()    function  with  pyQgis > 2.2
the labels are not  visible.

This is my test source code (taken from my GEarthView plugin):


                iface = qgis.utils.iface

                mapRenderer = mapCanvas.mapRenderer()
                mapRect = mapRenderer.extent()
                width = mapRenderer.width()
                height = mapRenderer.height()
                srs = mapRenderer.destinationCrs()

                # create output image and initialize it
                image = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
                image.fill(0)

                #adjust map canvas (renderer) to the image size and render
                imagePainter = QPainter(image)

                zoom = 1
                target_dpi = int(round(zoom * mapRenderer.outputDpi()))


                mapRenderer.setOutputSize(QSize(width, height), target_dpi)

                mapRenderer.render(imagePainter)
                imagePainter.end()

                xN = mapRect.xMinimum()
                yN = mapRect.yMinimum()

                nomePNG = ("TestImage")

                input_file = out_folder + "/" + nomePNG + ".png"

                image.save(input_file, "png")


So, my question is :  how need to change my code to have labels again
visible ?

:)

Hi

I did have some problems with dpi output and qgsmaprenderer. Martin Dobias helped me at the hackfest. Now I?m using qgsmaprendererjob classes and it works with custom dpi and labels:

    mapSettings = QgsMapSettings()
    mapSettings.setMapUnits(0)
    mapSettings.setExtent(rect)
    mapSettings.setOutputDpi(DPI)
    mapSettings.setOutputSize(QSize(width, height))
    mapSettings.setLayers(lst)
    mapSettings.setFlags(QgsMapSettings.Antialiasing | QgsMapSettings.UseAdvancedEffects | QgsMapSettings.ForceVectorOutput | QgsMapSettings.DrawLabeling)

    img = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_RGB32)
    #img = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_Mono)
    img.setDotsPerMeterX(DPI / 25.4 * 1000)
    img.setDotsPerMeterY(DPI / 25.4 * 1000)

    p = QPainter()
    p.begin(img)

    mapRenderer = QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob(mapSettings, p)

    mapRenderer.start()
    mapRenderer.waitForFinished()

    p.end()

    img.save("/tmp/"+filename+".png","png")

Great  !    Thank you also to Martin   :)

I am studing your source code...

BTW,   are  "qgsmaprendererjob"   classes  introduced from 2.4 version ?

In that case, I need to use a conditional like this :

              if  QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT > 20200:

Hi Stefan,


I did have some problems with dpi output and qgsmaprenderer. Martin Dobias helped me at the hackfest. Now I?m using qgsmaprendererjob classes and it works with custom dpi and labels

Great  !    Thank you also to Martin   :)
I am studing your source code...
BTW,   are  "qgsmaprendererjob"   classes  introduced from 2.4 version ?
In that case, I need to use a conditional like this :

              if  QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT > 20200:

Good to know :)

during hackfest, surfing the code with J?rgen to hunt a blocker bug, I
noticed that there where a lot use of the function
QgisApp::instance()->mapCanvas() => some functions at the "app" level
refers only to a unique canvas reducing the ability to interact with
multiple canvas.

it's a feature or really a limit?

regards, Luigi Pirelli

Many thanks for Otto and Larissa for the organization. It was great and
linux hotel was perfect.

As a complete newcomer for this kind of events, thank you all for being so
welcoming. It really feels good to be part of QGIS community. (And now I
have faces to connect to email addresses)

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] monitoring OGC service resources
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.02.1410060743210.20863@www.localdomain>


FYI as discussed on IRC today, for MetaSearch we have a default list of
CSW endpoints that we ship with the plugin.

I have been working on GeoHealthCheck [1], which provides service uptime/
monitoring of OGC endpoints (as well as simple HTTP links/websites), and
have stood up a public instance at http://geohealthcheck.osgeo.org (stores
30 days of uptime stats, get in touch with me if you would like your service[s]
added - self-registration is disabled for the time being), and have registered
the MetaSearch default endpoints to monitor them over time.

It's early days (suggestions, development/docs support would be great!), but
I thought this could extend to the default WMS/WFS providers we have default
in QGIS, or resources used in demo.qgis.org as suggested by Richard, or really
any resource that folks would want to keep an eye on over time.

Cheers

Hi Luigi,

some time ago we have discussion about having mupltiple map canvaces
in QGIS and even there was experimental patch for this [0].

But this is a very complex topic with many open questions. Maybe we should
start new discussion on this topic.

Hey Soeren,

The code that I was playing with is here.
https://gist.github.com/NathanW2/dc1b665cbce627ce0350#file-sipe-py

hopefully I will find some time soon to build the plugin correctly.

Message-ID: <1412613379077-5166197.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello everybody,

While working on the manual's update (using the tasks list [1] in the wiki),
I came across a change related to "ValueMap and GetFeatureInfo".
If I am not wrong, this update is related to QGIS server and it lets to use
mapped values also in the output of a GetFeatureInfo request.
I tried to replicate this feature in my local installation but the output is
just the "un-mapped" value.

The WFS service contains the correct mapped value.

What do you think about?

Thanks
L.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual Fields - Allow adding fields out of edit
	mode
Message-ID: <5432E98D.3080807@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I merged a commit today that fixes some problems with virtual fields, in 
particular a crash when removing a virtual field.
As the virtual fields do not work on the data provider, they are not 
directly linked to edit mode being turned on. This also allows to add 
virtual fields on data providers that do not allow to add additional 
fields. This led to a change in the GUI, that you are also allowed to 
add fields when edit mode is turned off. I added an info, that editing 
mode will be turned on, when adding real (provider) fields on the add 
field dialog.
However, I am not sure how intuitive the current behavior is. As we are 
approaching the final release date, I thought I'd explicitly point out 
this change and ask for feedback so we can take measures if there is 
hesitation to this approach.

Please share your impression and if you disagree with the current 
approach it would be highly welcome if you could outline an improved way 
of tackling this.

Matthias

Hi Victor,

looking at:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing/scripts.html#example-scripts

I do not see something yet about the online collection? Are you able to
write about this? Or should it be on the documentation list? It's not
yet listed on

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/ManualTasks#Updates-QGIS-24-and-26-User-Guide

Regards,

Richard

hmm, the "Example scripts" section contains a description of the online
collection. Maybe i should extend it and add more screenshots in there...

as suggested by Alexander Bruy I open a new thread continuing
discuttion opened in the thread:
"Map swipe tool in QGIS"
**************************************
having different mapCanvas embedded in a QTabWidget (as proposed in
the patch) I think is not as useful to the user as having multiple
canvas as proposed by the Dockable Mirror Map plugin.

reading the Nathan's code of the swipe tool I found the limit to swipe
among images that share the same crs.

The problem with missing qscimod4.sip from some Debian/Ubuntu packages
seems to be still an issue. Recently I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 and I
cannot sompile the sip parts of Python yet.

Nathan suggested [1] to disable the sip parts related to the code editors
for the moment, but it seems it hasn't been done. Have you found different
solutions to the problem?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual Fields - Allow adding fields out of
 edit mode
In-Reply-To: <5432E98D.3080807@gmx.ch>
References: <5432E98D.3080807@gmx.ch>
Message-ID: <54339EE8.20302@jena.de>

Hi Matthias,

there seems to be a small bug in the add field stuff: scenario
1) add a virtual field
2) add a permanent field => field is added but marked as virtual 
(symbol) and name is that of the virtual field added in step 1) BUG!
3) close and reopen layer properties => field from step 2) is displayed 
as it should, so the bug is on the display side only

tested with e5850f3

to your question: I think the current editing-mode behavior is 
intuitive. What is not intuitive is that the expression editor can only 
be launched when adding a virtual field. I am aware that I can add a 
(permanent) field with the field calculator but this whole business is 
IMHO not consistent.
This would be consistent:
1) in field calculator if choosing to add a new field offer to make it 
virtual or permanent (permanent being default)
2) make add-field dialog be the same no matter if adding a permanent or 
virtual field.

regards

Bernhard

Can you find that file on your machine? I can't....
Where should it be located?

I fear there was some problem with packages upgrading, but I can't find out
where.

If I'm not wrong you're searching only in your home folder...
That file is required by gui.sip, as you can see. If it cannot be found the
compiler shows the error (the build works fine the second time you launch
it but then you get the Python error on QGIS startup).

The only solution for me was unsetting QSCI_SIP_DIR to disable this sip
part.

QSCI_SIP_DIR is ?set? to QSCI_SIP_DIR-NOTFOUND.

What is this good for btw ?

If I'm not wrong you're searching only in your home folder...
That file is required by gui.sip, as you can see. If it cannot be found the compiler shows the error (the build works fine the second time you launch it but then you get the Python error on QGIS startup).

The only solution for me was unsetting QSCI_SIP_DIR to disable this sip part.

Can you find that file on your machine? I can't....
Where should it be located?

I fear there was some problem with packages upgrading, but I can't find out where.

The problem with missing qscimod4.sip from some Debian/Ubuntu packages seems to be still an issue. Recently I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 and I cannot sompile the sip parts of Python yet.

Nathan suggested [1] to disable the sip parts related to the code editors for the moment, but it seems it hasn't been done. Have you found different solutions to the problem?

QSCI_SIP_DIR-NOTFOUND turns QScintilla off. In my case the QSCI_SIP_DIR was
found but it was without the qscimod4.sip file. In this case QScintilla is
detected and turned on but then the error happens.
I had to set the option to QSCI_SIP_DIR-NOTFOUND to disable the feature...

Rule based renderer allows to have several symbols for the same element, 
which seems difficult to implement with expressions in a single symbol 
renderer (except if you combine them into layers on a single symbol? 
Sounds messy). It can be very useful to quickly see which elements have 
different properties: just create rules with colored dots and a 
different offset each time, all the relevant dots will appear near the 
element.

You also need to deal with symbol levels (advanced->symbol levels...). 
This is very useful for example for dense point layers, to ensure the 
points you want to focus on appear on top, or for road rendering when 
you do not want the road borders to mess up intersections.

If you want to combine all these renderers, why not use the rule-based 
renderer? It is the most powerful and can easily cover the others. I 
already coded a small converter between renderers, which can be used to 
convert single symbol, categorized and graduated renderers to rule-based 
renderer. Something similar could be used directly on user input in 
order to always save a rule-based renderer in the symbology.

This converter could be made much simpler if we get rid of the code 
dealing with "advanced->rotation field" and "advanced->size field" as 
they can be directly replaced by expressions. I think it would be a good 
first step before making more radical changes.

It could go there indeed, good idea.

I don't completely follow. Do you propose to remove the "virtual field"
from the "add field" in favor of 1) or is the intention something else?

Not sure if I met a feature or a bug...

I can open the same attribute table multiple times. I would expect, when 
I open it the second time, QGIS would just show/focus on the window 
containing the already opened table.

Is this meant to be this way?

will the field calcuator be active all the time then?

no, proposals 1) and 2) are independent from each other.
proposal 2) means, that the expression builder should be offered when 
adding a permanent field, too, thus not changing the dialog when user 
changes his choice of permanent/virtual.
Scenario is: user wants to add a permanent field and fill it with an 
expression. Now it is either
1) add field and accept
2) open calculator, choose field
3) define expression and accept
or:
1) set editable
2) open calculator
3) define expression and accept

future behaviour would be:
1) add field
2) define expression and accept

Hi Raymond,

Just discussed this last week with Denis who thought that sometimes this
is intentional (comparing two tables).

We thought about having the possibility to have a split view on the
table. Once this is possible we could prevent the attribute table from
being opened several times for the same layer.

Opinions?

It might be worth preventing several tables by the mean time:
* I observed many times several tables open with users. I believe this 
is not great for the memory.
* would be easier to fund the functionnality of comparing tables if you 
can't do it with several dialogs ;)

I would vote for not letting more than one dialog per layer.

My 2 cts.

I think if the user wants to add a permanent field with the help of an
expression the current solution with the field calculator is fine. I
don't see any benefit that the "add field" dialog would have over that.
On the other hand defining the virtual fields in the field calculator
(and removing them from "add field") could make things more coherent.

Any opinions about this?

When I deliberately open a table more than once, this is why.

(Oft times I forget that I have a table open, because it's hiding behind another window, and then wonder why I have so many QGIS windows open.)

This would be handy.
It sounds like something that would work best on a big-ish screen.
How would the small screen users feel about this?

Agreed on all.
I think for smaller screens we can use tabs in the same window.
All the best.

Hi Matthias,

What is the point of comparing two identical tables? If they have the 
same source, the contents must be the same. Or do you mean comparing 
different parts of the same table? In that case a split view would 
indeed solve the problem.

A disadvantage of opening the same table multiple times is that updating 
edits in all windows/tables will even be more complicate than it is now. 
(Already meeting bugs/inconsistencies sometimes.)

Hi,

IMHO the current behaviour is not optimal. I often see my users having 
the same table opened several times because the expected behaviour is 
that if it is already open it comes to focus (similar as with opening 
files). If the layer has many features opening the same table a second 
(or third) time is awkard as it takes some time.

So how about having an option "Open only one instance of a layer's 
table" that is ticked by default? Just untick if you need to compare 
tables (e.g. with different filters applied).

Bernhard

Actually I expect a table would be split horizontally, dividing is in an 
upper and lower part. Both parts having their own scrollbar. Now you can 
scroll to row 1000 with one part and compare the values to the values on 
the other.

Right?

it does not really have any, but I was wondering why I can use an

+1, this would make the expression thing in the "add field" dialog needless
add/remove field would be only for working on the data structure; the 
layer must be in editing mode, which makes your original question 
obolete :) or now it is applicable to the calculator

I would be against the proliferation of options: better design a sane behaviour, and
splitting seems quite reasonable.

Often one wants to compare a selection with another one, so we would need also one
selection/show bars per table.

Remove field would still be available out of edit mode to remove virtual
fields.
Add field would only be available in edit mode. But the field calculator
instead available out of edit mode.

Two tables can also also have different filters. So you might want to
compare them.  Restricting to a single open table per layer is not good
IMO, but yes the side stacking option that currently happens is not ideal.

Something else I have considered in this situation is a table manager type
dock, or some other way to show tables that are open.  So like the composer
we can close but not destroy the table and also maintain the state.  This
means you could restore the table from the manager rather then having to
reopen them each time.

A simple way (but of course not the only option) for the above is to add a
Tables -> sub menu to the context menu for the layer which lets you restore
a "closed" table.

Just a thought

QGis.WKBLine, None, "ESRI Shapefile")

Qgis raises an error telling that first parameter is "str", but he

QGIS 2.4 64 bit on Win7

Which QGIS version do you use?

I have a serious issue with master.

If I load a shapefile and then I open the attribute table, I can't right
click on this layer in the panel (to modify properties for instance).

If I close the attribute table, I can right click on it.
I use the dockable widget for the attribute table.

Anyone confirms?
Thanks

What about to have behavior of the attribute table as before (open
just one table / activate existing one), and in the attribute table
toolbar we could have a button to clone or split the table.

And/Or we could have a button to open a new attribute table window.

I believe that Paolo's concerns are valid, that sometimes you need a 
different filter. Having two filter lines in split view can crowd the 
window and split view on small screens may be difficult to use, thus a 
separate window could be better at times.

Anyway, default to raise the open table sounds reasonable.

anyone had the need to make QGIS work behind a proxy requiring Negotiate

AFAICS the only authentication scheme supported by QtNetworkProxy is Basic,
right?

Message-ID: <004e01cfe2e0$4ad7c4c0$e0874e40$@spaceyes.fr>

Hi,

QgsGeometry ::deleteVertex( int ) 

 in QGIS 2.4, it must not delete a vertex from polygon that has only 4
vertex or from polyline that has only 2 vertex. This condition was verified
in QGIS 1.8 

Is this a bug ?

 item properties in a print composer?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrC+s52D7EyEuKnwgALaOk=zCxoXSGqJTZqN=YyL3NtJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I try to understand the use case of empty tables in print composer and am
still confused.

Create a new print composer and add an attribute table item
set its height enough to show more rows than the maximal values of features
you set.
Add a second frame to this item.

Is this second frame considered as "empty table" (as no feature attribute
will be displayed inside)?
According to the answer, I think I'll have many other questions about the
options in "empty tables" combo box.

The only "empty table" I found in my tests is when the first frame displays
nothing (because "maximal rows" is set to 0 or "show only visible features
within a map" is checked and nothing matches). Is it the only situation?

Can somebody explain to me, please?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Server plugins call order
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672HeGAjA9O5YNc_kbA1ha+KSpYSsmTn_0j5poSYQbgJsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm mostly done with a first highly experimental server plugin implementation.

I would like to hear your opinion about the order of plugin filters call.

The current implementation is the "Observer" pattern described in the
RFC, together with Martin Dobias we decided to start with two filter
hooks:

* requestReady
* responseReady

having the opportunity to alter the parameters (coming from the query
string or soap or whatever) before entering the core services switch,
we can effectively skip it over completely in case of need. For this
reason (and because a raised exception is stored in the request), the
exceptionRaised hook is not necessary anymore.

Plugin filters can be optionally ordered by a "priority" (defaults to
0) and filters with lower priority will run first.

Beside the fact that a filter is not forced to implement both hooks
(and hence it can decide to have requestReady and responseReady
filters with arbitrary priority), my question is if is it better to
invert the priority order on responseReady hook.

This is a common pattern in web applications, where filters are
creating kind of "onion" wrappers or "middleware" (for example in
Django framework).

So, for instance

registerFilter( filter1, 200) # priority 200
registerFilter( filter2, 100) # priority 100

will result in the following calls:

filter2.requestReady
  filter1.requestReady
   core services (if matches)
  filter1.responseReady
filter2.responseReady

I prefer the solution above to the same priority ordering on both hooks:

filter2.requestReady
filter1.requestReady
   core services (if matches)
filter2.responseReady
filter1.responseReady

No. This behavior only triggers when the entire table is empty. It is
designed for atlas prints, where the table's contents are being filtered by
the atlas. In this scenario it's possible that no records match the filter
for a particular atlas feature and you need to handle empty tables.

Thanks Nyall. This is what I suspected.
Then, none of the "empty tables" options should work on the frames in the
example above, right?
But actually, "Draw empty cells" option does have effect on them. Isn't it
a bug?

Hi Anita

I think setting of active layer to the newly added layer was
previously (<2.4) a side effect of something else - and the removal
was not completely intentional. There is no problem to add that
behavior back... feel free to open a ticket.

Cheers
Martin

Well - possibly it's a little inconsistent, but I think this behaviour
is desirable. If you're wanting to show empty cells, I think you'd
also want to show them when the table is partially filled, rather than
only when it's totally empty.

get the geometry of the Objects and this Query runs extremly long (30-60
Minutes). And this happens everytime i change a little bit (even only the
color of something.)

Is there a way, to tune that? All usual indexes of this OSM-Tables exist.

Second: Is there a way to monitor (see) the real Queries the Plugin is
sending to the database-server?

now, i'm running whireshark (network monitor) to fetch them! That's awfull.

May be there is a  debugging options which i don't know about. If i have to
i can install 2.5-dev too.

Regards
walter

ps: Yes, may be i should ask that on the user-list. I tried it some months
ago and did not get any good answer.

Hi Walter,
which plugin do you mean?
All the best.

sorry, no special plugin; just that build in PostGis tool.

mainly i need to the the queries going to the server in order to optimize

Hi Walter

When you connect to the PostGis database make sure that you have selected the "Use estimated metadata" option - this optimises the connection for large datasets - see attached screenshot.  This should greatly improve the connection times for postigs.  (If you are already doing this then may need to look further!)

Cheers
Chris

Hi,

I noticed that somebody started to add commercials to commit logs:

Sponsored by ....

Funded by ...

etc. etc.

We should take this seriously, mostly ever developer works for a
company or run its own business.

Imagine if everybody starts adding those (not really useful) sentences
to every commit.

IMHO there othe (better)r ways to advertise our QGIS commitment.

Hi Alessandro.

+1 .

Almost because I guess the Public Administration should be stop di
wast resources in gfoss.
:)

So the private could use their money as like better.
Instead the public should simply acquire licenses of commecial.
This could resolve any problem.

Dont ?

Well, I wasn't thinking at institutions and external sponsors.

I'm thinking to regular core committers.

Look into pull requests and you will know what I mean.

Imagine if I'd add "Funded by ItOpen bla bla bla" to all my (not yet
many) commits, if Jef added "Funded by Norbit" and Marco and others
added "Funded by Sourcepole" ...

TO EVERY COMMIT

It that what I would like to avoid.

Like?

This has been discussed in the PSC
(http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/PSC_Meeting_7_Feb_2014), but I'm not
actually sure what the outcome was.

I don't like that there is a necessity to do this - and I'd like to avoid it
too.   But I also think there needs to be a way to value contributions and
make it visible who invests into the project.

We could mention it in release notes and changelogs. Or create a
dedicated page on the website (for funding over a certain amount).

Is this really an issue? It seems rather trivial. I personally am
strongly in favour of these attributions in the commit log. Reasons
are:

- It gives credit to sponsors. That's important! Look at how many cool
features were added in 2.6 thanks to sponsorship...
- It gives credit to developers who donate their free/company time.
That's also important. QGIS wouldn't exist if it wasn't for these
developers donating their time
- The commit log is basically for developers or power
users/contributors only. It's a fairly harmless place to advertise
these sponsorship messages. For a while there was a few "sponsored by"
messages in code comments - that's a much worse/more intrusive place
for these messages.
- It lets us blow off steam when release pressures ramp up :P see
68c49fe09, 34f00d106 and 2427546d8

So, +1 for allowing these messages.

The question is that whn we use an european fund to fund a develope
for gfoss (like qgis).

The enhancement is an advantace for all.
This is a certain.

But the European require to certificate the reality of the Fund
putting a disclaimer on the product realized.
Otherwise no fund at all.

I guess a citation in a page that is mied with many other developers
is not what ask the europe ,
because is not possible to localize exactly what was don with the european fund.

Ths is surely a problem and I guess is really hard to use successfully
European fund for enhancement on QGIS.

Instead the EU fund are really good for start new never existent
before gfoss products.
A godd example of this is gvSIG.

That software born with european fund.
So no doubt of it , all the work was from EU fund no proble to demostrate it.

I'm with Nyall.  I see no direct reason this is a bad idea.  If I do
something in my free time I don't care about getting recognition for it
because my direct work on the project is enough and if someone wants to see
what I do they can check my commit history or blog, however if I commit
something, say a feature that took be a while to make, on work time under
my employers name for them I think it's worth noting that they sponsored
that work.  Their contribution can be traced to that single commit and
pulled from the log.

The place it gets tricky is if you are running your own business committing
all the time for work reasons.

On the same note I do think it's worth having a page for each release with
a list of users who were active and sponsors that did the work.  This would
mean everyone gets highlighted for their work.  It doesn't need to be name
+ feature type of list, just a list of names is enough..

I agree to Nyall -

We need sponsors. And sponsors don?t want to be in footnotes fontsize 6.5

Right now I?ve started to get sponsors to the next developer/usermeeting in Denmark. And I?m sure sponsors will not be satisfied to be put into an appendix.

I think these small textnotes in the mail are harmless

Is this really an issue? It seems rather trivial. I personally am strongly in favour of these attributions in the commit log. Reasons

are:



- It gives credit to sponsors. That's important! Look at how many cool features were added in 2.6 thanks to sponsorship...

- It gives credit to developers who donate their free/company time.

That's also important. QGIS wouldn't exist if it wasn't for these developers donating their time

- The commit log is basically for developers or power users/contributors only. It's a fairly harmless place to advertise these sponsorship messages. For a while there was a few "sponsored by"

messages in code comments - that's a much worse/more intrusive place for these messages.

- It lets us blow off steam when release pressures ramp up :P see 68c49fe09, 34f00d106 and 2427546d8



So, +1 for allowing these messages.



Nyall

I agree with Nathan and Nyall. The commit history isn't a very 
"official" thing, so there is some room for attribution and other 
additional information.

Personally I prefer a meaningful commit message with some "spam" in it 
over a commit message that contains (almost) no useful information like 
"Fix #1234", "Fix #4567 [Meaningless title of an issue report]" 
"Followup 65443" (That one is not so bad, but could be improved with 
some prose). I often find myself looking at the commit history to find 
information about why something was done.
IF something needs to be fixed in the commit log, then we should rather 
focus on this than on a bit of pride, fun and attribution.

I also think that a list of funders/sponsors for a particular version 
would be nice. This could be directly below the changelog or linked 
there (I am rather thinking of a list than each individual change).

Regards,
Matthias

Considering that one of QGIS' main source of funding for development is
through financial sponsorship of _independent_ developers, I'd be very
careful not to take decisions that would hurt that ecosystem without asking
those independent developers the reasoning behind leaving a trace in the
commit log of who/what financially paid for feature XYZ.

For e.g., this could actually be a requirement of sponsors when it comes to
financial audits (i.e., what better audit proof that budgeted money went to
pay for specific improvement(s) of an open source project than a trace in
the said open source project's commit logs).

Beyond that, I find that as long as the "sponsored by" / "funded by"
one-liner is a the very end of the commit log, it doesn't hurt the ease of
readability of the commit logs via github or git log.

The home page footer sponsors are listing the QGIS project sponsors, not
sponsors who paid for independent developers to improve code and add new
features. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

+1

On a related note, keeping commit lines within 70 columns and
separating short description line from long description body
with two newlines also helps a lot :)

As J?rgen mentioned, we discussed this:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/PSC_Meeting_7_Feb_2014
My interpretation is that the PSC agreed on allowing giving credit to
funders in commit messages. Obviously I promised to write something
along these lines in the governance docs, but that might have gotten
lost in my todo pile:


16:20 <@anitagraser> 1. would be "giving credit to funders"
16:21 <@anitagraser> ideas were: a) in code/comment, b) in commit
messages, c) in release log, .... any more?
----------------------------- >8 -----------------------------
16:21 < pcav> I think commits are most appropriate
16:22 < pcav> but we should agree on a standard formula
----------------------------- >8 -----------------------------

Chiming in from the perspective of someone who was working for an occasional feature ?sponsor? until recently (mostly GeoServer, but also one or two QGIS), we didn?t do it with the intent of getting our name in anything (be it commit log, appendix, or even <h1> on the project front-page). We did it because we needed a feature or wanted to help the project.
If we were doing it to raise awareness of our philanthropy, the commit log is quite probably the absolute last place we?d have wanted it to be.

I agree to Nyall ?

We need sponsors. And sponsors don?t want to be in footnotes fontsize 6.5

Right now I?ve started to get sponsors to the next developer/usermeeting in Denmark. And I?m sure sponsors will not be satisfied to be put into an appendix.

I think these small textnotes in the mail are harmless

Is this really an issue? It seems rather trivial. I personally am strongly in favour of these attributions in the commit log. Reasons

are:



- It gives credit to sponsors. That's important! Look at how many cool features were added in 2.6 thanks to sponsorship...

- It gives credit to developers who donate their free/company time.

That's also important. QGIS wouldn't exist if it wasn't for these developers donating their time

- The commit log is basically for developers or power users/contributors only. It's a fairly harmless place to advertise these sponsorship messages. For a while there was a few "sponsored by"

messages in code comments - that's a much worse/more intrusive place for these messages.

- It lets us blow off steam when release pressures ramp up :P see 68c49fe09, 34f00d106 and 2427546d8



So, +1 for allowing these messages.



Nyall

You can't as we didn't decide anything, did we?   I don't see a point in
guidelines - either it's allowed or it's not.  Guidelines would just dis- or

To make an example, this is a good commit message.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/a132bc9a9e318c2321c8fba13dc9503b4d11e2aa

It states
  * which problem it solves
  * and what it does exactly

And I could not care less about an additional line at the bottom stating 
"Funded by John Wayne"

My guideline in all this would be:

What harm is it doing to need to change what is currently happening?  To me
the answer is none.

Provided you don't put it all on one line in the commit log and have it at
the bottom then put what ever you like in there as long as I can see what
was done and by who

Hi J?rgen,

you've got the point.

Without clear rules we risk abuse.

My original complaint was not about occasional big new features
fundings (see regione Toscana or city of Uster) but day-by-day small
bug fixes or changes made by regular committers.

If every developer start adding "Funded by ...." lines to each and
every commit he makes, than we have a problem.

Do we have a problem? What kind of?

Is a funded (with money) feature more worth than a feature or bugfix 
sponsored by a developer's private time?

14.04 is probably not recent enough (the fixes from debian unstable might not
have made it into it).

Did you manually add QSCI_SIP_DIR?  Otherwise it should not be found and
qscimod4.sip would be disabled (see 3988ad0f[1])

There was an IF condition in front of my sentence:

IF every developer starts .....

THEN we have a problem

And the problem would be flooding of commit logs with "Funded|Sponsored by ..."

I can live with it, I just feel that commit logs are not the right
place to store those information.

If commit logs were not visible on github (and Google couldn't find
them) we were probably not even talking about them.

I personally do not see any problem in having a "Sponsored by" bottom line
even in every commit message. Maybe not the most correct thing to do, but
it doesn't bother me, just like it doesn't bother me to see the author of
the commit. As long as the first line of the message (which is the one
shown in log summaries) describes the change introduced by the commit, i
think it does no harm at all

If we do not want the log commit to be flooded with such lines, maybe we
can encourage people to put them only in merge commits. If someone is
sponsoring you to develop some new functionality, you are likely going to
be working on it on a separate branch. Write your comments normally and
when it gets merged into master, put your "Sponsored by XXX" tag in the
merge commit.

My 2 cents

Anyway, not such a big problem, IMHO

Agreed. If I spend 2 hours of my free time fixing a bug, I think i'd be
entitled to putting a "sponsored by" message in the log to use as
advertising for my business.

Ultimately it's far more important to have the bug fixed than have a
slightly shorter commit log.

Also we should avoid playing the What If game.  It's not normally a good
idea because it's a open ended question.  My position is normally fix a
problem when it becomes a problem. (This only applies to non life
threatening situations of course).

Actually - the more I think about it, the more I'm in FAVOUR of these
messages. I personally think every "sponsored by
Sourcepole/Boundless/Norbit/..." adds weight to the project. It shows
that it's a serious project with serious backers, rather than a
part-time hobby project.

My interpretation of the discussion is that Paolo, Richard, and me
+1ed allowing crediting funders, while you gave it a 0. No other PSC
members were present.
Based on that, it would be allowed and it should probably be stated
somewhere that "yes, it is allowed to credit funders in the commit
messages".
Or do you mean that not enough PSC members voted?

Best wishes,
Anita

Well, I fail to see either problem or actual need.  If each and every commit
was properly attributed it would probably get less attractive anyway.  And the
"value" of the contributions are hard to value anyway and all this is only
considering code contributions...

"Use estimated metadata" is true and i see (in wireshark!) qgis is only
fetching 100 samples to get the geometry. But even that needs a very long
time. 

I think, Postgis is doing a sequential search but i'm no shure about that.
But why does Qgis check the geometry? it is allready known and should not be
necessary.

This part of Qgis is for me like a Black Box: select your data and wait. No
loggin, no infos, nothing. Just wait.

That is very frustrating in the developement-phase of a map. Killed the
Qgis-Process dozend times a day, loaded my last save and started again. :(

walter

Can you send the whole query ?
I think there's a class of such issues with big tables that need be
addressed (and secured with some automated testcase).

You can open some of the box by connecting to the database
and looking at the pg_stat_activity table.

It would contain querying being processed.

I feel your pain.
If you can, please test this issue with the current master branch so if
something has to be fixed it has a chance to be in time for version 2.6 
(due in 2 weeks).

That should already work.  Are you using QgsNetworkManager?

Almost.  It should have "Fixes #8166" in it to automatically link to the issue
and close it - Bugfix #8166 doesn't create that link.

Good hints. If it's not already in CODING, we could add these
guidelines in that file.

Also, since most of you don't seem to be annoyed by the "funded by"
sentences, I  think we can agree on Victor's proposal: if the new
feature/bug fix etc. was funded by an organization, a company or an
individual, a single line (80 chars max) sentence can be added as the
last line of the commit, after a blank line.

That line should be added only in the last "merge" (final) commit and
not on all and every individual commit.

Hi Jurgen,
I'm not using QgsNetworkAccessManager in my plugin (you meant this, not
QgsNetworkManager right?) but a simple QNetworkProxy with type HttpProxy.
It should be fine for my purposes but it doesn't manage Negotiate. Anyway
QGIS doesn't pass the proxy neither...

Hi,

for those of you interested in this topic, here is the API I'm working
on for Python bindings:

http://www.itopen.it/qgis/serverplugins/api/annotated.html

The implementation is complete, I'm currently working on a test plugin
and looking for memory leaks and other possible problems.

The test plugin will show some simple use cases, this is what I've
currently implemented:

* HTTP Authentication: Basic
* the remote console (with some additional checks for HTTP_HOST and
REMOTE_ADDRESS + HTTP Authentication Basic)
* a WMS GetImage watermark

I did it again and - performance is ok - no idea what is going on there. :(

will try it this night with another table.

But: it would be much much easier if Qgis would do the Job: "log all queries
sent to to the server" instead of using external tools to fetch that infos.
Using pgadmin3, postgresql server logs, pg_stat_activity or even wireshark,
which is for catching network traffic, is a little bit strange.

I disagree. "Funded by" attribution lines should go wherever the author
feels is appropriate, regardless of whether the commit is a merge type,
pulling in a whole branch, or the commits are simply rebased on top of
master.

It is a matter of public record:

* QGIS is a public project
* The funding is for a public project.
* The funding is a matter of public record (unless otherwise deemed by
sponsor).
* The commit log is a public record (and the longest standing one for the
project).

I fail to see how any of that can be misconstrued as "spam," if the line in
a commit is merely an attribution, i.e. not part of the first line of the
commit.

Even if *every* single commit message in the QGIS repo had a "Funded by"
attribution line, I could not see how that is anything but a matter of
fact. Actually, I think that would be an awesome record of the project's
prowess of finding sponsorship.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What does mean "empty tables" in "attribute

Indeed, this a desirable behavior: user may want to show empty rows when
there are not enough matching features. This is what I was looking for when
using this option. But having this one working for a table and none among
the three other options is a bit confusing for the user. I spent at least
an hour on testing why these options didn't work and I'm afraid I won't be
the last.

Don't you think that "draw empty rows" can be a separate option (may be a
checkbox)? It'll have its effects on every frame with too higher rows for
the features.
The other three options in the combobox will work only when there is no row
(on real empty tables).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIP and transfer of ownership
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E1383A201CB@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm just looking at the QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2 SIP and wanting to check my understanding of the use of /Transfer/

I think this is used to transfer ownership of an object.  So for example the renderer includes the member function

    void setSourceColorRamp( QgsVectorColorRampV2* ramp /Transfer/ );

So this could be used from python with code something like

    ramp=myColorRamp()
    renderer.setSourceColorRamp(ramp)

However if you were using the same ramp in two places, then you'd need to make sure that you didn't pass the same object to both, so you might have something like

   ramp=myColorRamp()
   renderer1.setSourceColorRamp(ramp.clone())
   renderer2.setSourceColorRamp(ramp.clone())

Is this right?

If so, then I wonder if having to pay attention to this sort of memory allocation/ownership issue is not very "pythonic".

Would it be better to set up the SIP so that it always used the clone() function, and so that a python coder didn't have think about whether they might have yielded ownership of a python object.  Presumably there is a way to write the SIP to do this?  And would this create issues in those environments (eg windows 64) where the transfer function doesn't seem to work reliably, and python subclassed objects need to be deliberately kept alive?

Cheers
Chris

That's a good idea. Can you file a bug report and assign me? I'll tackle it
before 2.6 release.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CAD tools
Message-ID: <543B72A1.8050305@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thanks to a really productive HF and good advices from its participants, 
I could port the CADinput plugin into QGIS core.

The general idea of CAD tools in QGIS is to have a kind of filter which 
works on top of//any map tool.

A pull request has been open [0] and a QEP has been proposed too [1].

If you have time to try this and provide feedback, you are welcome.

The general intention is to integrate this in the beginning of next 
release cycle.

Best wishes,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom SVG issue in QGIS API
Message-ID: <BAY174-DS17EB781B8D8B61C2B1C18D2AC0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

         I'm using QGIS-2.4.0 API to developing application.

I wrote a custom map canvas item called MyMapCanvasItemSvg that show SVG
items in canvas. 

It is well to load and display SVG from symbol library of QGIS (i.e. file
path: d:\QGIS Chugiak\apps\qgis\svg\symbol\*.svg),

But when I create a svg file using Adobe Illustrator 16.0.0(which is same as
Generator of symbol library's svg), it breaks. 

I don't know the key point of SVG, I searched the topic on mailing list,
only found the topic"Custom Symbology and Inkscape"(link
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Custom-Symbology-and-Inkscape-td4139425
.html#a4139427> ),

It don't help.

         

Any advice appricated!

 

Here are parts of my MyMapCanvasItemSvg codes:

 

void paint(QPainter *painter)

{

         QImage svgImage(29, 29, QImage::Format_ARGB32);

         QPainter imagePainter(&svgImage);

         mSvgRenderer.render(&imagePainter);          //mSvgRenderer is a
object of QSvgRenderer, constructed using a svg file path

         painter->drawImage(QrectF(0, 0, 100, 80), svgImage, QRectF(0, 0,
100, 80));

}

 

Regards,

 

Bob

Hi list, 
I wan't to set a square symbol in a point layer with python. 

Currently, I use a graduated symbol legend, and I have a circle (point) symbol with this line for each item: 

symbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(layer.geometryType()) 

But I want to set a square for one item. 

How can I do? 

Thanks, 
Stefano

Hi Larry,
At the risk of being a dissenting voice, is this really the message QGIS wants to spread? That sponsorship is king? As an Open Source GIS project, I would hope that its prowess lay in producing exceptional GI software rather than finding sponsorship. The later is a means to an end.

Also, what qualifies as ?funded by?? There was a monetary transaction? In which case what about the people who donate code they created in their own time and have received no fiscal incentive at all ? should not their contributions be similarly highlighted?

Cheers,
Jonathan

Good hints. If it's not already in CODING, we could add these
guidelines in that file.

Also, since most of you don't seem to be annoyed by the "funded by"
sentences, I  think we can agree on Victor's proposal: if the new
feature/bug fix etc. was funded by an organization, a company or an
individual, a single line (80 chars max) sentence can be added as the
last line of the commit, after a blank line.

That line should be added only in the last "merge" (final) commit and
not on all and every individual commit.

I disagree. "Funded by" attribution lines should go wherever the author feels is appropriate, regardless of whether the commit is a merge type, pulling in a whole branch, or the commits are simply rebased on top of master.

It is a matter of public record:
* QGIS is a public project
* The funding is for a public project.
* The funding is a matter of public record (unless otherwise deemed by sponsor).
* The commit log is a public record (and the longest standing one for the project).
I fail to see how any of that can be misconstrued as "spam," if the line in a commit is merely an attribution, i.e. not part of the first line of the commit.
Even if *every* single commit message in the QGIS repo had a "Funded by" attribution line, I could not see how that is anything but a matter of fact. Actually, I think that would be an awesome record of the project's prowess of finding sponsorship.

Thanks for the answer! 
Sorry but I didn't understand how to use QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2. 
I did some attempt but I didn't manage.. 
Below there's my code (with only two symbol item as example) 



myTargetField = field 
myRangeList = [] 
myOpacity = 1 



# symbol 1 
mySymbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(layer.geometryType()) 
mySymbol.setColor(QColor('#FFFFFF')) 
mySymbol.setAlpha(myOpacity) 
myRange = QgsRendererRangeV2(0.1,34.4,mySymbol,"< 35") 
myRangeList.append(myRange) 
# symbol 2 
mySymbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(layer.geometryType()) 
mySymbol.setColor(QColor('#238443')) 
mySymbol.setAlpha(myOpacity) 
myRange = QgsRendererRangeV2(34.5,39.4,mySymbol,"35 - 39 dB(A)") 
myRangeList.append(myRange) 

# other symbol items 




myRenderer = QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2('', myRangeList) 
myRenderer.setMode(QgsGraduatedSymbolRendererV2.EqualInterval) 
myRenderer.setClassAttribute(myTargetField) 

layer.setRendererV2(myRenderer) 
iface.legendInterface().refreshLayerSymbology(layer) 
layer.triggerRepaint() 


And I want that symbol 1 became a square. 
I can't understand how to use QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2. 

Sorry and thank you!

you can get the symbol layer from QgsSymbolV2 instance:

>>> mySymbol.symbolLayer(0)

and then change the name for the markersymbol:

>>> mySymbol.setName("square")

a working example which you can test from python console is:

>>> layer = iface.activeLayer()
>>> mySymbol = QgsSymbolV2.defaultSymbol(layer.geometryType())
>>> mySymbolLayer = mySymbol.symbolLayer(0)
>>> mySymbolLayer.setName("square")
>>> layer.rendererV2().symbols()[0].changeSymbolLayer(0, mySymbolLayer)
>>> iface.legendInterface().refreshLayerSymbology(layer)

Best Regatds,

I guess no fiscale advantage there are for any funding GFOSS.
So seeing to fiscale advantage the fund to GFOSS are fund lost.

I guess however that if a developer named "Count zero" give some code
developed by its own.
Why dont write "code founded by count zero with its own time" ?
The anonimy of the code is not a value. More better to know who found Every
piece of code.

Every single log line has the committer's GitHub name so it isn't anonymous.

My original concern was about advertising who pays the development
**in the commit logs**.

I just believe that commit logs are not the right place. I would
rather prefer to see those informations in the release notes, on a
dedicated web page, on printed materials, on T shirts, on coffee mugs,
carved in stones, wherever you want but commit logs (and source code,
except email addresses and copyright in the header, of course).

Let me repeat it again: I'm absolutely not against providing full
credits to funders, I'm against doing so in the commit logs, they are
by devs for devs.

Of course, I will be happy with any conclusion the community will
agree upon, if any.

Well I guess money does make the world go around.  A lot of the cool
features in QGIS were the result of sponsored work, without that
sponsorship somethings might have never happen. Developers and community
many exceptional software which is driven by sponsors and the community.  I
don't really see any harm in giving a hat tip to the sponsers because a lot
of them invest a lot of cash into QGIS.   This is of course not to say that
we should just change to a "give us all your money!" model but that is not
what is going to happen, or is happening now.

I would like to see a more public list of those who spent time on each
version, including translators, and doco writers, and sponsors. All of this
can be pulled from the git logs and using the funded by tags is a good way
to find money based features/bugs.

I know, but that also includes the paid-for devs; my point was that if QGIS wishes to highlight those paying for work with money, then highlighting those paying for work with time seems fair too.

Other than that, I'm +1 your entire message and don't think anything of the sort should be in the logs!

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan,

I don't think that this is the message that QGIS wants to spread. If it
would be, we would do popups that ask you to sponsor for every new
feature you created ;-)

But as you state, sponsorship is a means to an end. As such it is a
prerequisite for moving this software on and therefore it is good if
users are aware of the fact, that this software was created by people
and that they can only spend their time if they have a possibility to
get the money they need for a living.

If you ask me: a "funded by" is in a commit author's responsibility. He
knows what he wrote that commit for. Be it for money, for fun, for his
boss, somebody he loves or a university degree. If he thinks it is worth
putting a note there for any reason - i.e. definitely not limited to
monetary transactions - he should be able to do so. It does no harm, but
may be a reward for his time or be part of a contract.

The username next to a git commit is not the same thing. It can only
tell who does the commit, but does not tell for what reason/who he does it.

The only restriction I would put to this is that it must be placed at
the end of the commit on a new line (for the sake of good readability).

Regards,
Matthias

+1 . Can I request that the psc please make a final ruling about this issue

Honestly. I don't really think it's that big of a deal. If you pay for
something in your time and would like credit for it there are lots of ways
to get credit: blogs, twitters, commit logs, github stats.  If I do
something and I want people to think "oh look a new feature Nathan added"
(or someone else s cool work) I will blog about it, else I just leave it.

We already have a list of contributors on the About box. We can make this
more fancy but that can also turn the whole thing into a game of numbers
and lines committed, and Jurgen will always win ;)

The reality is this:

1) Some companies want to see it for record, or contract.
2) It doesn't pollute the log
3) It's at the bottom so you don't see it unless you do a full log (git log
--oneline if you didn't know you can do that for short log)
4) Does it really matter?
5) The first line is all that really matters
6) I like seeing that X feature at Y point was added/funded by Z company
7) We can pull this information for the website to generate a page

1) and 4) are the most important ones.

I look at the log every day, as with all devs, in short and log form, and
have never once cared about that small bit of text at the end.

Speaking here with my PSC hat on <|:-)

Nice example of a 'community discussion/rise-up' I think, but as noted
by Anita earlier, this came already up in a PSC meeting and we more or
came to this same conclusion.

As a PSC we can be blamed for not 'communicating' this enough AND off
course community members can always have an opposite reasoning
from it anyway.

But now let's stick by our earlier conclusion and I will add the
following line:

"a dev can write a one line (<=80 chars) 'thank you/funded by/whatever'
as a LAST line in his/her commit message to give credits to someone for
the work"

somewhere here:

  http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/sponsorship/index.html

This is/was in our view the least obtrusive way (for users, apparently
not for all devs) to give credits to sponsors if needed.

Hope this settles down this discussion, now let's do some new
features... funded or not :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

The changes have been merged to master today.

  * Virtual fields are now defined from the field calculator.
  * The field calculator is always available, regardless of provider 
support and edit mode.
  * If an action from the field calculator requires to turn edit mode 
on, the user will be notified on the field calculator dialog that this 
will happen automatically when clicking ok.

Please test this and open issue reports if things are not working as 
expected. Thank you very much.

	the metadata title.
Message-ID: <CABqTJk-Ay_-GGLCdqvotyNv3+EkyhVsdZ6ib2eTFndvNQ6etYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In qgis-server (i tested with last dev),
when use a category renderer,
and request a GetLegendGraphics.

The return use the LayerName as title of the layer in the Legend.
Like this sample show:

http://tinyurl.com/kwvoo6h

Or this other:

http://tinyurl.com/qaravsm

AFAIK should be better to have as Legend Title the title insert into
the Metadata Title (when filled).

Infact the layername is often a non-understandable code. Instead the
Metadata Title is a Human Understandable value.

The choice to put the layername istead of the Metadata title (when
available) is a bug or a wanted feature. ?

Thx.

Hi all,
I would like to ask for a couple of questions about VPL component QGIS 
Processing Modeler. The topic of my bachelor thesis at the university is 
"Evaluation of QGIS Processing Modeler according to physics of notation". I 
will evaluate diagrams created in Processing Modeler and I will use the 
theory from dr. Daniel L. Moody and outputs from eye-tracking tests. Are 
there any information about history of this VPL component? Is there any 
possibity to change design of the objects which are included in diagrams?
Thanks

Filip,

No way to change the design of objects from the interface. I am not
familiar with the subject of your thesis, but as the creator of the
Processing Modeler, I will be happy to ask questions about it, so just let
me know.

Cheers

Hi Matthias,

thank you for your work!
However I have some small issues and a bug [1]
- I do not see any notification when not in edit mode but my action 
requires edit mode (edit mode is turned on, though, when clicking OK)
- shouldn't "create virtual field" be the default when layer is not in 
edit mode?
- could the check box "create virtual field" be placed to the right of 
"create a new field"?

Hi Andrea,

It's a regression since the merge of the new Layer Tree.

Can you open an issue ?

Thanks,

I think it's more predictable (and therefore increases usability) for
users if it's either always on or always off by default. Don't you think?

"Create a new field" is a group box.
Would you create another group box with all field type widgets? I doubt
it's easy to place it in the group box header as well. But I could
easily take it to the top, just below the header.

Best regards
Matthias

Ok, agreed, so I opt for "always on" because it will always work

No of course not :-) I was not aware of the group box. I just had the 
impression it should be there, so moving it on top seems adequate.

It should be "always on" for providers that do not allow to add
attributes. For others both options always work and I prefer to keep the
previous behavior (without broad agreement that this should be changed,
if you convince some people I may change my mind ;-) ).

I open the ticket.

Meanwhile I see that contrarly to the first email, the category also
wrong to put the title in the legend response.

Thx,

Andrea.

But thus the behaviour is not predictable either (from a user's point of 
view, who is just loading data into his/her project). Virtual field will 
_always_ work, no matter which provider.

For others both options always work and I prefer to keep the

Anybody has an opinion on this?

Message-ID: <CAK4m-3zRwnmyN-hwa2F06P_RU_GefhMQS_Av7jrXAg-g6YCwaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm developing a Python plugin with several submodules (like MMQGIS).
I create a BaseDialog class to create each dialog and some functions
to fill the dialogs.
When I try to call the second method QGIS crash and it return this logs.
Maybe I should create a ui file for each method and don't use the
BaseDialog class to create my interfaces?

could you attach the output of the py-bt command?
Just for having some more information about the crash.

just type py-bt [0] onto gdb prompt, you need of the python extension
for debugging though.

I am a bit lost with changelogs.

Nyall, is your changelog the same as Tim's one [0] or is there one on 
QGIS website?

Were the features listed above added to it?

Best wishes,

Denis

I'm referring to Tim's one. To clarify, all I did was trawl the git
log and copy features which I think were worthy of inclusion. I
haven't written them up nicely or generated screenshots, so someone
will need to edit and reword the entries prior to release.
Unfortunately I don't have time to tackle this - I think I'm better to
stick to bug fixing and leave the wording to someone else :)

I'm still not able to run it, I installed all the needed software.
These are my steps:
- run "gdb qgis"
- inside gdb type "run" this execute qgis
- now try to crash qgis
- type "py-bt" but the result is

 (gdb) py-bt
 Undefined command: "py-bt".  Try "help".

Instead if I run only "bt" I obtain some output (the following one is
the complete output of gdb)

Hi Denis:

http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.6.0/

is actually this application:

https://github.com/kartoza/projecta

So if you have features you want to add, please do and also upload
screenshots etc.

There is the notion of approving 'feature entries', so different users
have different roles.


Tim managed the earlier versions, by rewriting text and asking people
for better screenshots or additional information etc.
Not sure if he is available now, if not it would be nice if somebody
else takes this job.

When the changelog is final, we can get a rst version of it whichi is
then used to pull a copy into the website and become a translatable
source like eg:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog240/

I cc Tim to ask if he is available for this or not.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

and python2.7-dbg?

I don't know whether getting stacktrace by python helps here, but that
should be a big hint in order to try to track down the source of the
problem with your plugin.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS certification
Message-ID: <543D33A4.7010109@gmail.com>

Hi all,
as pointed out in Essen, in a (I hope quick) future there will be the 
change to some people to give official QGIS certificates.
These people should be authorized by the "core team" and the 
certification money will go to QGIS.

So, for example, I'm authorized and I made a course by myself with my 
company to 10 people. 3 of them are interested to have an official QGIS 
certification, they pay something and that's all, right?

In the Internet I found this website:

https://www.coursera.org/

it offers courses for free with scheduled homeworks, tutorials, videos, 
data, etc...
So I can join the class for free, attend the lessons and do all the 
quizzes and assignments. But, if I want a "Coursera" certification that 
proves that I attended successfully the course I have to pay for this 
certification (around 50 bucks).

Do you think that this method can also fit for QGIS? I mean, maybe a 
section in the website (or somewhere else) where you can do a course and 
earn an official certificate?

Suggestions are welcome!!

Cheers

Matteo

I think that certification is a good idea and that some standard training
materials tied to that make sense. On that effort I have two points.

First, I would suggest that if there is an effort to have QGIS
certification, then this should be coupled with a discussion a while back
to stable releases where effort is made on bug squashing and not new
features. The reason for this is that certification on commercial platforms
is tied to specific versions and thus companies investing in certification
for their staff will expect the same type of effort. In my mind this seems
naturally tied to an effort to put forward QGIS as a viable alternative to
commercial tools for governments, NGOs and companies.

Second, I use QGIS to teach a Intro GIS course at the University of
Calgary's Continuing Education department. Much of those materials are
targeted toward using QGIS as a means to teach GIS not the particular
features of QGIS. That said if there was an effort to setup standard QGIS
educational materials I would be willing to contribute whatever parts of
those materials that would be useful.

Del Mar College in Texas is offering classes & certificates as "QGIS
Academy".

http://foss4geo.wordpress.com/2014/08/10/announcing-the-new-geo-academy/

The classes are only $25 each; I'm taking the GST 102 class now.   I'm
using QGIS under Ubuntu (classes assume windows), and there are issues;
like no installed support for MrSID (LizardTech propriety fmt), and
Multispec doesn't run under Wine.  I have enjoyed Python plug-in
development though (not part of the classes).

Yes I plan to review everything in the changelog over the coming weekend.
As usual just stub in your ideas as entries in the 2.6 changelog or send me
an email if you can't manage the website with any entries to add and I will
review everything to get the writing style consistent, add screenshots
where needed etc.

Yes I am. And thanks Richard for making the nice explanation of the process
and thanks to Nyall and others who have been helping to populate it.

As usual just stub in your ideas as entries in the 2.6 changelog or send me
an email if you can't manage the website with any entries to add and I will
review everything to get the writing style consistent, add screenshots
where needed etc.

Thanks Tim - your work on this is really appreciated!

We have detailed a plan for this during the Essen hackfest - please see

https://github.com/timlinux/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/master/QEP-3-QGIS_Long_Term_Releases.rst

I hope that we can make 2.8 the first LTR release.

Ah cool - thanks for this Matteo - I'll add it to the list of things to
look at (along with http://taotesting.com which we are currently
evaluating).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] weekly build problem
Message-ID: <CAAA+3N4YKFDRoCBCzTwFmZPZHHtBFs=2Buz1_s-H=1YQSa+9_A@mail.gmail.com>

I installed the windows weekly build on 9/26/14 and QGIS has been behaving
poorly ever since.  When I add
a simple shapefile, stored on my local hard drive, turning the layer off an
on takes up to 10 seconds.

I have since tried to uninstall the weekly build and install a stable
version of QGIS (2.4) but the problem now remains.

Is there something else that needs to be uninstalled such as visual C++,
etc?

Thanks Tim. That looks like a good planfor long term releases. I'll sign
onto that list to see how I can contribute on the training side.

Are there any plugins that could be causing this problem? Seeing as the problem exists over 2 different versions of QGIS I would recommend checking.

I have had similar (think it was with version 2 and 2.2) and the problem was solved by turning off all plugins. I was then able to add the plugins in again one by one to find the plugin causing the problem.

Rename your .qgis2 folder in your user profile directory (eg
c:\users\my_name\.qgis2) to something else to try a vanilla qgis
configuration. If speed goes back to normal, problem lies with a plugin, or
less likely a non-default qgis setting.

Hi Trevor,

one of the idea's for educational material, is to put an 'index' page in
the QGIS website, pointing to material available on external websites.

A first page is created here:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/trainingmaterial/index.html

you can either add links to that page, OR (if you have a lot to
tell/show) create a new page and link to it on the index page,
describing your material and pointing to your site.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ok, how do you usually use py-bt with gdb? how do you run gdb ("gdb

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Can QGIS generate a has-attribute map that
	composed of several .shp maps?
Message-ID: <BAY174-DS11826329E63D6ECC6C6FF0D2AA0@phx.gbl>

I'm using QGIS-2.4.0 API to develop application. 

I need a map that composed of several vector layers. If only this, it can be
done by merge in QGIS, but I need more for that: the map(or project?) I want
is composed of several layers, each layer has its own attributes, such as
style: color/labels, the visibility of scale dependent. For example, the map
MYMAP I made is composed of city.shp layer, river.shp layer, road.shp layer.
When scale is changed, it displays different from city to river,road. I
don't think this can be done by merge only. 

It can be done by the software QGIS, but in API development, it is difficult
to do such things. So I think there got be a better way, for now I think it
can be done by: 

   1.A composed map. A map that composed by several .shp maps, and their
attributes, make it in QGIS software and use the map in apps. In apps, it
can load the map and the rest things are same as a single map. 
   2.A project. A project that composed by these things, this also be done
in QGIS software. In apps, it can load project, but at the same time, the
.shp maps used in project will be needed too. 

I don't know if I make my point clear, and I don't know how to do it for my
point, or if there is a better way to do it, any advice appreciated! 

 

Regards,

 

Bob

Of course, additions to the main repo, instead of linking external
pages, are possible, and welcomed. WHile diversity is a Good Thing,
consolidating efforts into one robust training material, with the
possibility of selectively compiling specialized subset (e.g. only
introductory chapters, for a basic course, all forestry-relevant
chapters, for a forestry course, etc) is even better.
I'm available for help on this.
All the best.

Usually, it is enough to type:

# gdb qgis
(gdb) r
.................... <- crash
(gdb) py-bt
.................... -> python stacktrace

but there are other useful options [0]

also look at this link [1], you could be in the same situation

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS-Website issues
Message-ID: <543E4B3D.1050307@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I have just had a look at the issue reports for QGIS-Website. There are
a lot of issues open, some of them would be very easy to solve (e.g. [1]).

As the website is the first contact for many users it is an important
business card for the project and therefore imporatant it is in a good
shape - and it is a lot better than the old website actually.

Still, there is always the possibility to improve the website and I am
afraid, that people who could participate to do so will turn away if
there is no response to their suggestions.

I am aware that this is not a job that is "fun to do" nor a job that
makes a business model (at least not one I could think of right now).
But it would still be good to improve the situation. Do you have any
idea what we could do to improve the situation there?

Regards,
Matthias

After uninstalling all my plugins, renaming my .qgis2 folder nothing had
changed.  So I uninstalled QGIS, deleted any remaining QGIS folders
including .qgis2 and  purged everything from my registry settings.
Everything is working again.   Thanks for you input.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QuantumGIS

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\   I had several QGIS installations here that I
had to delete.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composers: should locked elements be
	selectable?
Message-ID: <543E7DF6.70904@carto.net>

Hi, Hi Nyall,

This concerns a change in the print composer. There seems to be a change 
in behaviour between QGIS 2.4 and 2.6 regarding selectability of locked 
elements.

In QGIS 2.4 locked elements where still selectable in the canvas, in 2.6 
they are not, but one can still select them in the element list.

To me, the locking mechanism mainly prevents unwanted movement of 
elements and I personally would prefer that locked elements are still 
selectable in the canvas. It would be different if we had the concept of 
layers. Elements in locked layers should not be selectable, I think - 
but since we do not have layers yet, I am not sure ...

What are the opinions?

Andreas

This is intentional and something I've been coding towards for a long time
(it was actually my first ever frustrating behavior i ran into with QGIS'
composer back when I started using QGIS!).

Here's the rationale:
- it brings QGIS into line with the standard behavior of illustrating/DTP
software. This is a big plus in itself...

- it makes it possible to interact with items which are stacked below other
items. Otherwise, its impossible to click and drag an item which has
something above it. Making locked items non-interactive in the canvas means
that you can lock the upper item, freely move/resize the lower, and then
unlock the upper item again.
- the items panel makes it easy to select locked items and also quickly
unlock them.

Unless a bunch of angry users turn up at my house with pitchforks and
flaming torches this change is here to stay! ;)

Hi Nyall,

I guess I was just used to the old behavior.

I have a lot of print composers with locked items (to avoid accidental 
movements) and was used to the fact that I could still select the locked 
items ...

I guess I will get used to the new behavior. Please leave it as it is.

I felt the same Andreas, but after some weeks using version 2.5, I think
I'm getting used to this behavior and makes more sense, as the Nyall says.

Thanks for the improvements in Composer Nyall!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Show area of a polygon while editing with node tool
Message-ID: <1413445131355-5167750.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm developing a python plugin.
Now the users of the plugin want to see the area of a polygon while editing
it with the node tool because they need to have polygons with a specific
area.
Means they move a node and the area changes while moving the node.
Is there an easy way to manage this? Are there already any examples?

Thx for your help

regards

Michael

you can always get the geometry from the rubber band with asGeometry()

http://qgis.org/api/classQgsRubberBand.html#aecb438a7c6e7c284d6a601d88985b66a

and calc the area.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem adding non-cached WFS layer using PyQgis
Message-ID: <1413449308166-5167778.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

>From my plugin I am able to add a non-cached WFS layer to QGIS using the
following code:

c_extent = self.canvas.extent()
str_c_extent = c_extent.toString()
str_c_extent = str_c_extent.replace(" : ", ",")
url = site_url + "wfs.ashx?id=" + token +
"&SRSNAME=EPSG:27700&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME="
+ layer + "&BBOX=" + str_c_extent
iface.addVectorLayer(url, title, 'WFS')

The layer is added to the ToC fine but does not fetch any features ('show
feature count' is 0). Panning the canvas etc does not cause the layer to
request features either. 

If I add the same layer in using QGIS GUI (unchecking the 'cache' button)
then each pan/refresh will request the features for the new canvas extent.

The layer source of the WFS added by PyQgis and QGIS GUI are identical when
looking at the properties.

I have tried this in both 2.4 and nightly build. This was not an issue in
2.2 with exactly the same code.

Could anyone suggest fix/work around to this problem I could try?

Manys thanks
Matt

Hi
Isn't there already such plugin? I haven't used it yet but you can give a look to CalcArea plugin and see how it deals with that.

Hi,

just a question: are you trying to superimpose this on top of the 
out-of-the-box node tool or are you planning on creating a new tool that 
copies the node tool?

The first is not so simple I assume, the second either (plus it does not 
make too much sense to rewrite core functionality in Python). Apart from 
that I would be sceptical because with mouse moves the users will never 
achieve their target area.

I see two possible solutions apart from making a plugin of your own:
1) label the polygon with its area; after a node is moved the label is 
updated so users can approximate their desired target area.
2) try DigitizingTools plugin; there is a function to move a node or a 
polygon side to achieve a target area. If you need other funtionality 
there you are invited to contribute.

Bernhard

Thx for your hints guys.
Indeed I thought about superimposing or creating a new tool that copies the
node tool.
But the plugins mentioned by Bernhard and Junior should be a good and much
easier solution as well.

Thank you for your help

regards

Michael

Unfortunately, I don't have a good idea yet how to improve this situation ...

Looking through the current list of open issues, there are some
technical issues which can only be solved by people who are familiar
with the platform. Others are more concerned with the content of the
website and could be handled by more casual contributors.

In general, it might help to raise issues on the documentation team
mailing list to get attention.

Best wishes,
Anita

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=x-vmrqJ=ZsGnjEuyDJKVsmezh3x9taCUpiW7qZs4K5Rw@mail.gmail.com>

I need to iterate over a layer without the need of geometries.
I rembember I used this flag time ago and it worked fine. Now, if I set
this on the feature request, I get an empty set of features from the
iterator. Am I doing something wrong?

req = QgsFeatureRequest(QgsExpression('$area>1000,00'))
reg.setFlags(QgsFeatureRequest.NoGeometry)
feats = [f for f in mylayer.getFeatures(req)]

if a set the flags to QgsFeatureRequest.Noflags the iterator returns the
correct features.

if you set flag to NoGeometry you cannot pass the $area function as it
needs of the geometry in order to calculate the correct value.
your snippet should to work whether you store the value of $area in a
new field and use it in your espression

Could this be a reason? :)

Ciao.

Great Salvatore, you're right.
I thought the geometry wasn't passed by the iterator but it could be used
during  the request expression evaulation. That was wrong ;)

Alexandre

I wanted to give an update on this.

Use case 1:
	- Store a reference to the feature in the data portion of a QWidget
	- On a callback, make the layer editable and pass the stored feature to the openFeatureForm

This works and enabled the feature to be edited.  HOWEVER, the feature may already have been changed so could be in a stale state.

Use case 2:
	- On the same call back, look up the new feature using layer.getFeatures()
	- Make the layer editable and pass the "returned" feature to the openFeatureForm

This fails.  Feature form opens as non editable.

Use case 3:
	- Use the original feature.
	- Copy the attributes  from layer.getFeatures() to ensure the old feature is in sync.
	- Make the layer editable and pass the "updated" feature to the openFeatureForm

This appears to work ok. See issue raised here:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11395

Telemetry Layer has been updated to support the working scenario:

My rationale is in the QEP pull request - I can expand on it if you want?

Hi,

has anyone had problems with QGIS 2.4 on Windows? Sometimes and
randomly, during editing a shapefile (.SHP), it freezes for 10-20
seconds and then it restarts...

With the 6th QEP opened for discussion, it would be about time to finish QEP 1 
first?
As I understand the proposed process [1], Nathan should ask on this list for 
voting to adopt QEP 1.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] size of git repository
Message-ID: <20141017115936.GA28333@localhost>

Hello everybody,
today, after being waiting too much on a "git log --stat" command I went
asking for ideas in the #git channel, and reported the QGIS git repo url.

They cloned and reaction was like this:

 12:42 < luto> strk: what is in there? an ubuntu iso? :D
 12:44 < canton7> 925 megs in all

I went digging up history back to June 2011, when the code was moved
to git, and according to my blog post at that time the size was 330 Mb:
http://strk.keybit.net/blog/2011/06/07/getting-just-the-tip-of-a-remote-git-branch/

 12:48 < luto> 200mb of XML
 12:49 < luto> 4mb per file
 12:50 < canton7> yeah, those xml files are like 60000 lines each
 12:51 < canton7> strk, in conclusion, I'm not surprised --stat's being slow.
                  calculating which 50 lines have changed out of 60000
                  for a few files at a time is going to take a little
                  while :P
 12:51 < canton7> 1.3 gigs for a whole clone

There might be nothing that can be done to reduce the size of the
repository w/out altering the history, but maybe some care should be put
into avoiding to make the growth so fast.

 12:56 < luto> $ time git --no-pager log --stat > /dev/null
 12:56 < luto> 167.40s user 2.13s system 100% cpu 2:49.38 total
 12:56 < luto> $ time git --no-pager log > /dev/null
 12:56 < luto> 0.34s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 0.357 total
 12:56 < luto> on a ramfs and i7-3630QM (quad core, 2.4ghz)
 12:56 < luto> that's really not something one can work with..

On my laptop it takes 4 minutes to run this:

  time git --no-pager log --stat HEAD~100 > /dev/null

In the #git channel on freenode are going on with the analisys to try
at figure out if it's possible to alleviate the speed problem.
I though it was worth mentioning to the list.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 1:many relation enhancements
Message-ID: <54411984.3030005@gmail.com>


Hi all,
I'm working with the 1:many relation tool (what an amazing tool!!) and I 
get (maybe) some enhancement ideas.


I'll explain myself with a small example:

I have a geometry layer (Europe countries extracted from natural earth 
database) and a table (dbf file downloaded from the EU database[0]) of 
waste produced for every country from 1995 to 2012.

I made a form mask for the identify feature tool and when I open the 
relation tab I can see relation of the table of all the waste produced 
for every year.
But what if I want to see just the year 2010 for example? Or what if I 
have 2 waste types in the same column (say urban waste and recycled) and 
I want to see just the recycled one?

Do you think it is possible/easy/smart to add a sort of auto-filter tool 
(like in Calc) so that the user can filter, and then display, just by 
the values he wants?

Moreover (and finally), do you think that it would be possible also to 
render by the linked table values? I mean, graduate all the countries of 
the Europe layer with the recycled waste values coming from the dbf file?

I don't know if I have been clear enough, but I hope so else, be free to 
ask clarifications

PS. here [1] a dropbox link with a zip file containing the layers and 
the project file.. if anyone wants to try..

Thanks! Cheers

Matteo

By the way I'm not sure if it was ever officially mentioned that Nathan is
the official QEP manager as voted by the PSC[1].

Paolo,

Have you compared the output of ogrinfo -al on the shapefile after SAGA has 
created it, and after resaving ?

Hi Paolo,

Not confirmed here with qgis master and saga 2.1.1 (xubuntu 12.04).

Have you tried the same process on saga standalone?

Thanks Even. The wrong one has:
Extent: (nan, nan) - (nan, nan)
However, updating the extent from QGIS vector propertires does not solve the issue.
Seems more of a problem with SAGA though.
Do you think I should open a ticket upstream?
All the best.

It is likely that the OGR Shapefile driver doesn't do right things with such 
extent. Perhaps always filtering out features when spatial filter is defined.

> Seems more of a problem with SAGA though.
> Do you think I should open a ticket upstream?

Yes, that should likely be fixed on SAGA side.

Perhaps OGR could also better react in that case. Perhaps open a ticket in 
GDAL trac with the shapefile attached.

Dear Paolo,

recently I have something similar. I compared the bad and the good 
shapes with diff (octal dumps).
If you send me the bad shape I can try to find the cause of the problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] v.generalize in Processing: wrong output projection
Message-ID: <544368C0.50207@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Applying v.generalize through Processing on data with prj:

PROJCS["ED50_UTM_zone_30N",GEOGCS["GCS_European_1950",DATUM["D_European_1950",SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388,297]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-3],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

generates an output with a wrong prj:

PROJCS["UTM_Zone_30_Northern_Hemisphere",GEOGCS["GCS_international",DATUM["D_unknown",SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388,297]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-3],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

that is interpreted by QGIS as a custom projection (USER:100007 -  * SR generato
(+proj=utm +zone=30 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs)).

Anyone confirms? It is not clear to me which part of the toolchain is to blame.
Should I open a ticket?

All the best.

There seems to be a problem with SAGA's shapefile writer/reader. See this:

The parameters are the same, so not really wrong. QGIS often does not 
recognize similar projections when the name does not fit.

The only thing missing is the +wgs84 parameter from EPSG:23030:

+proj=utm +zone=30 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-87,-98,-121,0,0,0,0 +units=m 
+no_defs

Those parameters are often ignored in shapefiles, and QGIS does not find 
the right EPSG code without them.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

I think in such cases it would be nice if the different issues are
updated to link to each other, so different issues/projects can benefit
from each others comments or data?

Message-ID: <CANtWbEA0B=3GyY77r0MePg5L=4wqNLWZVAkHTqRO0u+GQm-V2Q@mail.gmail.com>

 i have a question about the qgis project oragnize. Is those CMakelists.txt
file is write by hand? Not generated by some software.

Is the process is like that? first developer write the cmakelist.txt file,
the other developer can use the cmakelist.txt file under CMAKE to configure
and generate project for different platform. then compile the whole
project. Is my statement right?

SO my question appears, If i need make some custom modification basing
qgis. Is my right process would be like that:   first write some similar
cmakelist.txt file for my custom qgis project. then using cmake to
generate, then build the project.

thanks.

Hi guys,

I open the recent QGIS master and i don't find the Oracle Spatial icon.

In the Plugin Manager only appears the Oracle Raster in installed plugins.

Can anyone confirm this? Is the same for the other OS?

not quite sure it's the same issue.
I'm investigating upstream (SAGA and GDAL).

That should be a general procedure for raising issues to the PSC anyway. I
will also rais in the next PSC meeting getting in place some system to keep
a better record of the votes we have taken.

The measure tool onscreen markers are not persistent and are therefore 
not useful. Why have tools that have no useful function? I've complained 
about this before, filed a ticket and was argued down by a developer.

It is frustrating to try to contribute to a project when nobody wants to 
cooperate.

I don't think it is fair to characterise QGIS as a project where nobody
wants to cooperate. People are busy, may have differing opinions to you,
may not have noticed your ticket etc. We are a community of people trying
our best to cooperate and sometimes we fail, but it certainly isn't through
a lack of desire to cooperate. My advice is keep trying (in a friendly way)
to get your request noticed, and if others don't always agree with your
ideas, don't take it personally.

Tim

Correct - we generate CMakeLists.txt by hand and that saves us from
generating Makefiles by hand.

Yes. And if you need to build a custom standalone app that links to QGIS,
you can use the handy cmake/FindQGIS.cmake to let your build process find
QGIS for you.

Hi all.
I noticed that osgeo weekly[0] is published in the early morning of Monday.
Today  they are not yet there (I do not know which time zone they refer to).
At the same time, nightly does not seem to be compiled today, at least for Debian.
I'm writing because I think it is quite important, in these last days before the
release, to have fresh packages to allow for more testing.
BTW, it might be useful to package also at mid week, for the same reason.
All the best, and thanks.

Now (8:16 dutch time) I see this on the server as time/date:

rduivenvoorde at qgis:~$ date
Sun Oct 19 23:15:42 PDT 2014

So I think it will appear somewhere in this afternoon?

do you know if there is a ticket about this? it is unclear to me where exactly the
problem belongs:
* the processing backend adding a (from QGIS point of view) malformed prj
* Processing itself not copying the right prj to the output
* QGIS failing to interpret valid parameters
or?
thanks.

Thanks Juergen for clarifying this.
Any hope for a mid-weekly release? I may have about 10 people heavily testing it on
Wed to Fri.
All the best.

Why would they require a standalone?

as previously discussed, having a standalone, and announcing it widely, will make it
easier for people to install it, thus enlarging our tester base.
not a critical issue anyway.

Resending this email from the user list to the dev list.

@Umberto: you have more chance to get this done if you sent this to the
developers list. But it is good to advertize this kind of fixes and try
to get this into QGIS in this way! Thank!

@devs: does this look like a viable fix for the problem?

Hello.

I?ve been using qgis since a long time.
With the new version (2.4) I can?t edit my polygons with the reshape
features tool because it rises an ?unknown exception?.
I know this is a bug (see hub.qgis.org
<https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10999>). Anyway, it seems they are trying
to fix this problem (on GitHub
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1609/commits>), but, as a
non-programmer user, I cannot figure out if I can actually solve my
issue modifying the code myself (according to the gits) so far.
Since the reshape tool is a must to have tool in my work, I wonder if
someone experienced the same lack and maybe got a hint for me.

 Thanks in advance!

P.S.: I am really sorry to have posted this message many times by my
second (not-registered) mail address (umberto.minora at unimi.it). Please
consider this message and not the others, and sorry again...

Hi all.
I'm glad to announce we have a new silver sponsor:
http://qgis.org/en/site/about/sponsorship.html
Sourcepole has a long term commitment to QGIS project, and it is a pleasure to see
they decided to support it also as sponsors.
It is thanks to generous initiatives like these that several aspects of the project
are sustainable, most notably the prerelease bugfix and the HackFest organization.
Many thanks therefore to all our sponsors.
Happy QGISsing.

Hi,

I'd be against adding a lot of SVGs to the standard installation. Too 
many files slow down QGIS. People should selectively install only the 
icons they really need.

Didn't we have a project of a common icon repository where users could 
contribute/checkout tagged icons, specific to certain needs (e.g. 
geology icons, landmarks, geomorphology icons, etc.)? What happened to 
this project? This would make much more sense rather than delivering 
hundreds/thousands of icons by default where users only need 5-10 % of 
the shipped icons.

Agreed fully. Unfortunately the project is still unfinished. IMHO (I know, I'm
repeating myself) it would be important to have it in production.
As a side not, I think we should also do something to speed up the loading of many
symbols: as QGIS is being picked up for serious work, it is rather normal for users
to build up huge collections of symbols.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing Select By Location operators
Message-ID: <544515C2.1090902@camptocamp.com>


Processing algorithms like "Select By Location", "Extract by Location" 
have been enhanced with some new operators :

  * Include input features that touch the selection features
  * Include input features that overlap/cross the selection features
  * Include input features completely within the selection features

Which can be combined in a binary OR manner.


What about exposing each existing geometry operators supported by 
QgsGeometry class :

  * intersect
  * contains
  * disjoin
  * equals
  * touch
  * overlap
  * within
  * crosses

I remember that Arun's summer of code project (2012 I think) was meant
to improve the situation. Are there still problems with slow loading
of symbols? Or are we talking just about loading of SVGs? (that should
have been improved too)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New processing manage fields algorithm
Message-ID: <544521A8.4030501@camptocamp.com>


We want to create a new processing algorithm for manage table fields.

This new algorithm would have :
     one standard input layer vector parameter
     one standard output layer vector parameter

     a specific fields mapping parameter composed, in columns
         source field name (optionnal)
         destination field name
         destination type, length, precision
         expression (default to the source field name)
     the mapping would be initialized, when possible, with the input 
layer fields.

In the dialog :
     the first tab would present the normal input/output parameters and 
a button to go to the next tab
     the supplementary fields tab would contains the fields mapping

The final goal is to supply a user friendly interface to manage table 
fields :
     rename fields
     change field types
     add new fields based on expression
     change fields order
and save the result as a new file, temporary file or memory layer

What do you think about this ? Any remarks ?

Bug report #9703

The line thickness is good. The endpoints could be improved. Crossmarks 
would be better than dots. If dot endpoints are easiest to program, then 
put a smaller white dot in the middle of the larger red dot. This will 
help measurement accuracy. The most desirable quality of the tool would 
be for the markers remain on screen until cleared by the user. This 
includes remaining on screen while other commands are selected and new 
data entered. This onscreen persistence should also be applied to the 
angle measure tool.

With robust CAD tools this would not be an issue because the operator 
can quickly draw temporary measure lines on screen and erase them at his 
leisure. With QGIS the CAD tool functionality is clumsy and inefficient. 
Data point creation with other systems is fast and well developed. Most 
CAD systems allow inputting a data point, then drawing the next point 
using a relative angle and distance at the keyboard or visually with 
onscreen angle and distance display controlled by snap settings. Perhaps 
what I'm really asking for is better CAD tool functionality.

I have many *thousands* of points to calculate and enter by hand. Months 
worth of work. If I were a programmer perhaps this would not be 
necessary. Unfortunately I don't think I have the time to spend a month 
or two getting up to speed programming in the QGIS environment, not that 
I would not like to. I just spent 7 months learning a foreign language 
to translate documents for my project. When the functionality of the 
measure tool changed after QGIS 2.1(1.8, 2.1 something like that), and 
the measure tool lost its persistence I despaired.

I am pressing for this functionality because I need to finish my project 
and put food on the table.

Anyway, this is my project, analyzing ships navigation data:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCWZzqHc8ow

In this project QGIS is merely a tool to develop a better understanding 
of historical events. What will really be significant is when QGIS goes 
3D and I am able to visualize aircraft and ships data simultaneously in 
an animation using the animation plug-in.

GRASS is started with
g.proj -c proj4="+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl 
+towgs84=-87,-98,-121,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"

So the command line for GRASS is correct. From that point on, GRASS does 
not do any reprojections on the data, so GRASS is working ok. ED50 is 
not mentioned explicitely in the projection definition. I'm not sure if 
an EPSG-code can be given instead.


> * the processing backend adding a (from QGIS point of view) malformed prj

The .prj that QGIS creates:

PROJCS["ED50_UTM_zone_32N",GEOGCS["GCS_European_1950",DATUM["D_European_1950",SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388,297]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

and the one from GRASS:
PROJCS["UTM_Zone_32_Northern_Hemisphere",GEOGCS["GCS_international",DATUM["D_unknown",SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388,297]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

with false names, but correct parameters, and no towgs84 in both cases. 
It seems that GRASS does some WKT guessing on its own, instead of just 
taking that of the input file to the output file.

But QGIS also creates a .qpj file with TOWGS84 parameters and the EPSG code:

PROJCS["ED50 / UTM zone 
32N",GEOGCS["ED50",DATUM["European_Datum_1950",SPHEROID["International 
1924",6378388,297,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7022"]],TOWGS84[-87,-98,-121,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6230"]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4230"]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["metre",1,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],AXIS["Easting",EAST],AXIS["Northing",NORTH],AUTHORITY["EPSG","23032"]]

This is for compatibility with shapefiles from ESRI, which never include 
TOWGS84 in the .prj

Maybe we should ask the processing dev to copy the .qpj from the input 
to the output file without further change. Or hand over the EPSG code on 
the GRASS command line unless a custom CRS is used.

I don't know if there is a ticket, and whether to address it to GRASS or 
processing. Perhaps to both.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Hi,

It is very likely that better CAD functionality will hit QGIS soon. An
approach based on the CadInput plugin [1] is being discussed [2] and
parted to core [3]. Maybe this does already provide a lot of what you need?

Matthias

That's definitely a nice idea. I guess this was what you started working on
at the Hackfest but i wasn't of much help since i wasn't understanding the
idea completely... :-(

Here are some suggestions:

- There are some algorithms that have a custom UI and that you can take as
example. The vector calculator is probably one of them
- You will need to create a custom UI for the modeler as well, in case you
want to appear with a nicer dialog than the default one. Processing
supports that, but there is no algorithm currently using it. I can take
care of that once you have the basic UI finished
- Sounds like it would be a nice algorithm to have for editing a layer.
That is, to modify it instead of generating a new one. You can do that by
not having a visible output layer in the UI, and just returning the input
layer source path instead as output value.

Let me know if you have questions.

 Missing Oracle Spatial icon?

As far as I know, Oracle spatial support is only enabled when using the
windows installer, and only then if the support is selected. I tried
(unsuccessfully) to build qgis on ubuntu, I would love it if someone could
report on the full steps they used to do this successfully on linux (or
mac)-

Hi all.
I'm testing the plugin, and I cannot see the background maps on the output page (they
are shown on the preview though). I see this has not been reported as a bug: is it my
local problem?
Thanks.

I think it's related to local files (  more info
<https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/issues/1729>   ). Can you please open a
bug?

Thanks

I had some problems ith that plugin too, see

What datasource types did you test?

hi, vert nice idea.I would miss a tool to import a destination schema like in
ETL tools (and why later not a graphical mapping tool like tmap component in
talend).

Hi, 
I just finished a project with custom UI made with QTcreator with qgis
widgets. I successfully added the 1-n relations editor widget, ans it is
really a great feature.

+1 with filter suggestion to find a relation . a spatial filter  ( distance
or BBox index filtrer) would be the best filter.
I also saw some  possible improvements :
-  An option to choose default  view (attributs or form) is welcome ans
should be exposed in qtcreator too.
- blocking the tools to add or delete relations is wishable when administor
do not want  user to do it. 
- a commit is made  for each row that has been clicked on (red italic
confirmation on form view). this leads to commits even if no data has  been
modified. is that possible to have detect commit status if data input is
made?
 
Mattheo, 1-n agregator are not yet in qgis, but it is easy in postgres or
SQLite to have a view agregate value to let qgis map it. 
Cheers
R?gis

Hi Jo?o,

for Windows I know the Oracle provider is part of the osgeo4w install
(and I think also in the standalone installer, but not 100% sure).

Only if you have this Oracle spatial provider included you will see the
little blue oval meaning the Oracle provider is available.

Most linux repositories do not have the Oracle provider in their QGIS
binaries, probably because of license troubles.

Some time ago with some help of Martin I was able to build QGIS on
Debian with Oracle Spatial provider.

For more info see this thread.

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-August/034195.html

My plan is/was to write some a blogpost about it but....

Anyway, some info for now:

You have to register with Oracle and download the instant client
packages, via
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html

- instantclient basiclite linux
http://download.oracle.com/otn/linux/instantclient/121020/instantclient-basiclite-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip

- instantclient sdk linux
http://download.oracle.com/otn/linux/instantclient/121020/instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip

see also instruction from Martin. But unzip those, and then configure
your compile/build with -DWITH_ORACLE=TRUE

for me the magic lines were:

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/richard/dev/oracle/12.1/instantclient_12_1/libclntsh.so.12.1


 ccmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/richard/apps/qgis/masteroracle/debug??
-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python2.7
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so i
-DWITH_ORACLE=TRUE
-DOCI_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/richard/dev/oracle/12.1/instantclient_12_1/sdk/include?
-DOCI_LIBRARY=/home/richard/dev/oracle/12.1/instantclient_12_1/libclntsh.so.12.1
..

And voila, you have your Oracle Spatial icon ;-)

As said, I hope to find some time to do this again and then blog about
it (though I 'lost' my Oracle db, if somebody has a online test db
available, please let me know).

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ah, this is useful. Let me mess around with this.

What was the latest version of QGIS you checked with?  This has been fixed
by Jurgen in August in commit [0] so will be in 2.6 and is in dev at the
moment.

[0]
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f28b63497d458a50c9e3c604229229d6138c8bf0

My advice is to run the dev version as well as stable if you are keen to
see what has and hasn't been fixed.

Hello G. Garibaldi,

Like you,  I'm not a core programmer and therefore I depend on this fellows
goodwill, time and skills to make qgis a better tool for me to use.

With this in mind,  I have to say that you probably would have more success
if, instead of demanding for changes to meet your needs, you kindly asked
for help in the developers or users mailing lists. I bet that there would
be a few people giving suggestions to solve the problem,  without asking
anything in return. This has been working very well for me.

Also, it looks like your work depends on qgis. Not less than qgis depends
on you. So take some time asking yourself what could you do for qgis. If
some new tools are crucial for your work, please consider sponsoring it's
development (Developers also need to put food in their tables).

Now to your problem.

Since you need persistent measure tools, I would suggest you the following
workflow:

- Install "memory layer" and "memory layer saver" plugins (I think the
first one will became core in qgis 2.6);

- Create a new memory layer with lines geometries;

- Label your memory layer using $length in the expression;

- Whenever you need to measure something and keep it for further use, all
you need to do is draw a line in you memory layer instead;

Note 1: This can also be done with areas using a polygons memory layer;

Note 2: You can style the lines to create fancy measuring representations,
for instance by adding some arrows at the end and beginning  of the lines.

Hope this helps,

Alexandre Neto

You can also build packages for the "sid-oracle" distribution[1] - that'll
require a oracle-instantclient11.2-devel package (made with alien from the
oracle download you described) and include a qgis-oracle-provider debian
package in the build.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Open a *.qgs project file in API,
	why maps do not show?
Message-ID: <BAY174-DS18FEFFCAB4D5746BAD0808D2940@phx.gbl>

Hi all, 
I'm using QGIS-2.4.0 API. I saved a test.qgs file in QGIS Desktop, in this
project, there is one layer in it. 

Then I open the test.qgs project file in QGIS API to developing, but it is
not showed in APP. 

Why is that? 
The code I'm using to open the project is: 
    QString myProjectPath = "E:\\QGIS\\Pro\\test.qgs"; 
    Qgsproject::instance()->setFileName(myProjectPath); 
    bool isRead = QgsProject::instance()->read(); 

In Debug mode, isRead equals TRUE. 

Any advice would be appreciated!

 

Regards,

 

Bob

Use:

Hi Gary ,
Thanks for reply! 
I don't what iface is. Is it another name of QgsProject::instance()? I'm
using C++ to developing app.

Ah, I missed the fact you were using C++.

iface is an instance of QgisInterface available in the Python console. 
It exposes interfaces in QgisApp, which doesn't help you if you are 
developing a standalone app in C++.

See the code for: QgisApp::addProject( QString projectFile ) in 
qgisapp.cpp for how QGIS loads a project file.

Hi
I?ve got a question from a GIS user: Is it possible to open a DFS2 file in QGIS ?
For sure I?ve been through the filelist - but maybe a hidden plugin or another advanced function for opening and editing.

Hi,

Thank you for the feedback. It's nice to hear that this work is being
used and appreciated.

Matteo, the filter sounds like a good idea. The main problem I see with
that is that adding an additional filter column may be cluttering the
already limited space in the embedded form. Maybe a button is required
to toggle this.

The other idea - if I understood it correctly - is something I have been
considering for a while. It is generally known as "aggregated
functions", that is things like max/min/avg/count etc. over all (or even
only a subset of) related features. This would be best embedded in or
around the expression engine. It's an advanced topic, but it's
definitely on my todo list.

This is referring to a scenario where both involved layers contain
geometries and you would want the parent's feature available in the
expression to filter the childrens?

That is available in QtCreator if you use the custom widgets plugin.
There is an option called "view mode" which can be set to form or table.

This is likely not a problem of the relation widgets but the edit
widgets used on the embedded form. Maybe one of them is unsuitable (like
a value map that doesn't contain the original value or an edit widget
that does not match the widget defined in the .ui file).

If somebody is able and willing to fund these features or help otherwise
I am more than happy to see things improving in this area. I think there
is a lot of potential left to be explored with relations.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi Gary,
According to the QgisApp::addProject( QString projectFile ) function, I did
some change in my code. However, the map still doesn't show, but the CRS in
project works fine. So I think the project file was read but there is
something wrong about display(or MapCanvas).

I don't use Python plug-ins and ScaleComboBox, so I remove the relevant
part, the code is:

	another
Message-ID: <CAHpqhBP-KKwePfcnVMhDnsV95fF2YS5vpz635HRQJ4SzsFb6zA@mail.gmail.com>

So I filed an "issue" <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues/215> for
the qgis web page regarding using pdb with qgis in that the proper imports
weren't done.  However, I've moved forward and found that the code blows up
when I try to drop my python plugin into the debugger.

So this code per the documentation
<http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/ide_debugging.html#debugging-using-pdb>
:

        pyqtRemoveInputHook()
        pdb.set_trace()

Causes this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/Volumes/ColettiData/MarkColettiHome/.qgis2/python/plugins/TweetTracker/tweet_tracker.py",
line 385, in run
    self.__createPointLayer(self.dlg.selectedEventNames(), tweets)
  File

  File
"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/bdb.py",
line 67, in dispatch_line
    if self.quitting: raise BdbQuit


I'd really rather avoid the annoyance of spraying print statements
everywhere and rely on a proper symbolic debugger.  Surely others are able
to use pdb for their qgis plugins?  If so, how do I make this work?


Cheers!

Hi Matthias,
Agregate functions could be provided by virtual table feature (qep is coming I think), I suppose we should chose one common way for advanced relationnal capabilities.

About filtering, you're right,  we can't assume children table to be geographic. I was thinking of a search bar on top of the dialog showing new children candidates. That search bar could have a qgsexpression widget on its right to enable a permanent filter + a field chooser to choose on what field apply the user entries of search bar. why not have parent geometry accessible in expression builder and let the power user make spatial filters?
..
Thanks for the tip on qtcreator, I worked on 2.4? now I know it's done ;-)
By now, no direct funding is possible for me (administrative blockers). I wish I could finance your work on unit tests first, but it is currently forbidden to french administrations..

cheers,
Regis

This is referring to a scenario where both involved layers contain
geometries and you would want the parent's feature available in the
expression to filter the childrens?

That is available in QtCreator if you use the custom widgets plugin.
There is an option called "view mode" which can be set to form or table.
(Available in master / 2.6)

This is likely not a problem of the relation widgets but the edit
widgets used on the embedded form. Maybe one of them is unsuitable (like
a value map that doesn't contain the original value or an edit widget
that does not match the widget defined in the .ui file).

If somebody is able and willing to fund these features or help otherwise
I am more than happy to see things improving in this area. I think there
is a lot of potential left to be explored with relations.

Kind regards,
Matthias

Hi,

I think we could use the same feature as in processing for sharing scripts
and models. It is based on a git repository, and works quite well. It would
be sraitforward for devs to add icons, and users would be able to choose
which icon set they want to download and then upgrade.

Regards
Michael

Hi Mark,

Thought not really helpful: I just tried your instructions and those
work for me on Debian Linux here. Hope there are some mac dev's with
experience around. Only difference with instructions: although the
output is in python console, the input I have to do in the terminal I
started QGIS in.

I'm running a debug build of QGIS here, not sure if that is really needed.

Is gdb working for you to set a breakpoint in QGIS cpp source?

I'm either printing statements or using pycharm for plugin debugging
normally :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Sorry - forgot to reply to this. I was going to suggest that if you
make sure all your items have meaningful ids set then it's even easier
to lock/unlock them from the items panel. You can either set the id
through the item properties panel, or by quickly double clicking the
name in the items list panel.

You'll also observe that selecting a locked item in the items panel
will still draw a dotted highlight around the item on the canvas (and
allow you to edit the item properties via the panel). So it's quite
easy to identify items by clicking them in the list and seeing which
item is highlighted.

Hope that helps!

Hi Michael,
sounds interesting, as it avoids entirely the complexity of a web-based application,
and could be implemented soon, with minimal effort. This holds true for symbols and
styles as well.
Any comment? Any taker?

I agree that one common way is preferable, but actually this QEP itself 
is already duplicating functionality (of QgsExpression) and nobody was 
able yet to confirm that it is possible to optimize queries for 
execution on the database with sqlite virtual tables. Something that is 
a must from my point of view. I think it is a good initiative, but for 
the aforementioned reasons I am not yet completely convinced, that it's 
the one and only way.

That search bar could have a qgsexpression widget on its right to enable a permanent filter + a field chooser to choose on what field apply the user entries of search bar. why not have parent geometry accessible in expression builder and let the power user make spatial filters?
Yes, once there are expressions available the parent feature should be 
available for evaluation. Now I am not sure if I understood correctly. 
Are you referring to a filter to show only a subset of the related 
children or a filter to search for new children which you want to link 
to the current feature?
I was also thinking of improving the search field to link additional 
features (or change the parent of a feature) but that would mainly make 
sense (in my scenarios) if this could be evaluated server-side and that 
would require a project "expression compiler" for which I am currently 
also looking for funders :-)

I thought this barrier mainly exists for "funding" as such (like in unit 
tests, but thank you for mentioning it), but not for a particular 
contract work with a requirements document for a new feature? But you 
surely know better.

All the best,
Matthias

But we already have core implementation for this (I know, it is not merged
and also require server-side app). Maybe we should compare this two ways
and decide which one offers more functionality and will be more usable for
large symbol collections.

If I'm not wrong, core functionality offers tags, groups and some other nice
features. As reasult one can create complex search criteria. In other hand
solution available in Processing is very simple (AFAIK it was developed as
temporary solution until core functionality is not merged).

Just my 2c.

Hi,

this topic has been addressed several times during the last few years,
the current situation is that a Django app skeleton for a symbology
and styles is already available from a GSOC work at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/tree/gsoc_remote/qgis-app/symbols.

Unfortunately, after having examined the code during the HF in Wien we
decided that it was not production ready, and we have no time and
resources to improve the code. A rough estimate of the time required
to improve/complete the app and test/deploy it is 7 working days (for
the symbology application only).

But this would be only part of the development since we still would
require (in any case) the QGIS desktop integration part.

That said, I'm not against using a github based solution, even if I
don't generally like the idea that we depend more and more on external
sources.

An argument in favour of the Django app is that it would probably
allow for a tighter integration with the website, exactly like the
plugin website does.

I don't know anything about the amount of time/resource needed to
complete the github-based solutions though.

Hi,

Since I'm the author of the mentioned QEP
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/5), I have to
answer :)

What functionalities of expressions do you think it duplicates ?

I don't see anything that prevents virtual layer queries from being
optimized server-side. It has to be taken into account during the
implementation of virtual layers, of course, but it is hard to exhibit
the precise way it will work now without having an almost complete
implementation.
Anyway, it will try to complete my proposal with some more concrete
material about that when I find time.

Almost all (IN, LIKE, ILIKE, *, +, / just to name a few)

I was referring to this discussion here.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/5#issuecomment-58148788

Sorry I did not respond again, but I don't think a complete optimization
is possible without having deep access to virtual table functionality in
sqlite (or having to parse the same SQL on our end and replace parts of
it which basically comes close to writing our own engine again).
But let's discuss this on the QEP PR instead of inside this ml thread.

I'll make sure I'll have a look at it when I find time after you found
time :)

Just to give you my feeback based on my implementation of SQLite SQL dialect 
in OGR ( 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/sqlite/ogrsqlitevirtualogr.cpp 
), I also doubt that you could easily inform the server that a join should be 
done. AFAIR I could forward simple filtering to the server/backend (things like 
"column_A >= 5 AND column_A <= 10 AND column_B != 10") by implementing the 
xFilter virtual method, but Virtual Tables are not informed of joins happening 
(the sqlite virtual table API hardy exposes SQL at all). So that would indeed 
require analyzing the SQL on QGIS side.

AFAIR, I've just verified that JOIN like "t1.col1 = t2.col2" are seen by the 
virtual table implementation like successive filters "t1.col1 = val1", "t1.col1 
= val2", where val1, val2 are values from t2.col2.

And regarding xFilter, even filters with OR etc.. are hidden to the virtual 
table implementation and evaluated only by SQLite.

Well, QgsExpression has been designed to mimick the SQL WHERE clause, so
yes I agree.
My point is that if you want to extend expression to support joins,
aggregates, window functions, etc. you end up recreating SQL, but
probably a less powerful one.

The difference I can see between expressions and SQL is that functions
used in expressions may have no direct equivalent SQLite-side. But it
can be resolved by using user-defined functions in SQLite (that would
just call code from QgsExpression for instance), so that the SQL dialect
would be seen as an extension of the current QgsExpression, not
something different.

Thanks Even for your feedback.

The idea under virtual layers is that SQLite may be exposed to advanced
users if they want to use a complex query on some data sources.

It is very interesting to use SQLite to replace existing features from a
code point of view because it simplifies implementation.
But exposing a SQL query for already existing features such as joins may
not be desirable for standard users.

So for joins, since the information comes from QGIS ("I want to join
tables t1 and t2 on this column predicate"), the SQL query can be
deduced and some other metadata is also known, like the fact that t1 and
t2 may be from the very same database.
In that case the virtual layer may be created with some metadata saying
that this is in fact a join that must be optimized. And then the virtual
layer provider can ask the underlying provider (say postgis) if it can
process the whole join query.

You can call it mimicking, you can also call it implementing it's own
SQL (subset) dialect.
Yes, you end up recreating SQL. How powerful it will be is hard to say
right now, right?

I am not only referring to the current relations implementation here. I
don't think aggregate functions need necessarily be based on creating a
relation definition in the project file (Just like in a database you
also don't need a foreign key constraint to create join).

But if I want to create a new layer or an ad-hoc iterator that joins
data or makes use of other advanced relational database features, it
would be nice if QGIS could forward such requests to the database. Say I
want to create a symbology based on the amount of waste within
countries, QGIS should be able to execute this request on the database.
In this scenario you could likely want to define this request inside an
expression (e.g. a virtual column).
So basically, I think we need a functionality that is able to work as a
database abstraction layer. Forward wherever possible to the db, use a
(local) fallback implementation where not.

I am not opposed to use SQLite for this. There is no reason for us to
reinvent the wheel, the NIH syndrome should not be our driver. But I see
some limitations and I would rather prefer to have these properly
addressed. And I will be more than happy if you tell me that you
convinced the sqlite virtual table developers that they should extend
their API to expose the parsed SQL structure and allow to tweak it. Then
we have a fallback implementation which is well-tested but we still have
the possibility to fine-tune requests for big databases.

Matthias

Sorry for my english, "mimicking" was not a negative term for me.

Sure. But if you want it to be as powerful as other SQL engines, lots of
work is needed (parsing, planning, optimizing). Work that has already
been done, I think.

Not sure to understand. You mean there would be no need to create a
virtual layer just to execute an aggregate ? Exact.
But if the virtual layer concept is complete enough, then every single
layer can be seen as a special case of a (trivial) virtual layer, then
to create an aggregate, you won't need to create a new virtual layer.

I agree, but can you be more specific on your example ? How many tables
involved ? Which fields ? What kind of joins ?

Splitting the original query in local and remote queries seems to me
very hard in the general case. It would require not only the parsed SQL
AST, but some information about the execution plan. And the plan may
depends on statistics on the data. And even when you know the plan, I
think it is still hard to translate.

Generally speaking if the user tries to do a very complex query with
lots of different data sources, it is hard to guarantee good
performances, but I don't see it as a major problem. If you want
something complex AND fast, then use SQLite or PostGIS.

So, I would vote for optimizations that can be done for simple, defined
scenarios, like the "join" case given by the current join or relation
feature of QGIS : no nested queries, no group by, no order by, no CTE,
etc. That particular case could be detected when the join is created,
and optimizations can be created, like creating a (temporary) postgis
layer with sql=the join query.

I may be missing something. Are there other simple cases where the
optimization is well defined ?

To put it differently, I don't see the lack of knowledge about parsed
SQL query as a blocker for the implementation of this virtual layer
concept. A general cross-database SQL optimizer would need lots of work
(in QGIS and/or SQLite) and may come later (if really needed).

The other option would be to say we don't need everything SQLite
provides, and we won't never need it. So then we can define our own
subset of SQL and it would probably be easier to optimize. But I can't
see why we would want to limit the features :) it is usually the opposite.

IMVHO we need this function a lot, and we need to be realistic: of course a fully
integrated solution, entirely under our control is by far preferable, but if nobody i
going to implement it anytime soon, a temporary solution would be good, in order to
start building our symbol collection, that can be migrated to the Great Final
Solution when ready.
All the best.

So, I searched for  "scipy"  library  and I want to install it, using

python setup.py install

but, again, I had other errors   :(


Can anyone help me?

Message-ID: <5448F659.6040709@carto.net>

Hi,

I have troubles with actions - testing with current master (nightly) on 
Win7 64bit.

Often QGIS either crashes when using the action or the action is started 
but not with the correct attribute value.

The action starts a Java application with a given parameter set. When 
QGIS does not crash, the Java app is correctly started, but the 
parameter (a database key) is often omitted.

Did others test the current master with their actions (on Win7 64bit)?

Thanks,
Andreas

Message-ID: <CACfnYnSJi3pdMKBvL0VFvDwKN3=MiEjm5ZzTk5TojtvFvvwWRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm noticing the following when editing features via wfs-t (with qgis
as client and as server): if the modified feature has a lot of nodes
then saving give this error

Errors: ERROR: 1 geometries not changed.

Provider errors:

empty response


if I simplify/generalize the feature then (at some point after
generalizing quite a lot) modifying/saving via wfs-t works ok.

Adding/deleting features operations are not affected.


I tested both qgis 2.4 and master both as client and server using both
shapes and postgis as source data.

Is this a known limitation?



cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend-tree: Category checkboxes behave strange on
	Linux/KDE
Message-ID: <54490284.5020909@carto.net>

Hi,

Is there someone who tests QGIS master on Linux/KDE?

I have issues with the new legend tree and the "pseudo-layers" (category 
checkboxes). Normally a checkbox needs a mouse-click in order to toggle. 
In the legend-tree on Linux/KDE it seems like if I check one checkbox 
with the click and then mouse-over other checkboxes, the 
checkbox-statechange already happens on mouseover. This is very suboptimal.

Apparently only the checkbox state is toggled, but not the action 
associated with the checkbox - thus the legend-tree gets out of sync ...

I wonder if others have the same issue? Testing on Kubuntu 14.04 / KDE 
desktop.

Hi Andreas,

Do you say that the same project/workflow does not crash on linux and is 
specific to windows or have you haven't tested this on linux?

If you haven't, by any chance, can you try and give more details where 
the crash occurs?

Best wishes,

Hi,

I don't have this software on Linux, that I am starting with the action.

The crash happens quite unpredictable. Sometimes it starts correctly, 
sometimes the other software starts, but the parameter is missing, 
sometimes it crashes.

If the crash happens, it happens immediately after I trigger the action.

Does the minidump file help at all?

Hi all.
1, the default interface on windows seems to be the advanced one,
instead of the simplified (as it should probably be)
2. afre some analises on the simplified interface, the Geoalgs menu
entry disappears, and reappears when switching to the advanced
interface and back.
Anyone confirms? Should we open a ticket?
Thanks.

It's a bit hard to tell from this. I observed some crashes when running 
actions a few months ago, but nothing since.
 From where do you launch the actions (new identify menu, identify dock, 
feature form)?

The question besides the crashes is why in many cases the parameter

BTW:

Here is the action I use:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\DataverAbwasser\jre\bin\java.exe" -jar 
"\\srv141\Stadtentwaesserung\sbu\a2dv\av2dv.jar" 
-conf="F:\Data\Programme\Dataver\av2dv.conf" -typ=K -bez=[% "haltungsnr" 
%]

The "haltungsnr" is the dynamic attribute that should be handed over to 
the other application. In 80% of the cases it fails, in some cases it 
works with correct values. I double checked that the values exist.

Very strange.

Andreas

Hi all.
I noticed the following problem:

* starting it with defalut parameters in a 4326 project for rectangles
(line) results in;
Algorithm Create grid starting...
global name 'feature' is not defined Vedi il log per maggiori informazioni

for hexagons:

Algorithm Create grid starting...
global name 'xVertexLo' is not defined Vedi il log per maggiori
informazioni

whereas for Rectangles (polygon) and diamonds it runs fine.

* the method for selecting the extent is quite unpractical, if
compared to the Vector command equivalent: would it be possible to
change it?
Also, adding the possibility to select the extent by hand with the
mouse on the canvas would be good

* in any case, it seems that the command adds one less row than
expected on the North.

If anyone confirms, I can open the relevant tickets.

All the best.

I simply ran the first_alg example from the training manual, and the
menu disappeared.
Now it's back, and I cannot make it disappear again.
Not a serious issue anyway.

I somewhat assumed that 2.6 package in osgeo4w would be shipped with saga 2.1. To my

2.0.8 is still the most tested and stable version, in terms of integration
with Processing. It doesn't work in OSX (only 2.1 work there) and in Linux
there might be more recent packages, so we support 2.1 as well, but in
Windows is still the safe option. The difference is not so big, so I would
say let's stay on the safe side and leave it like that

For QGIS 2.8, let's make the integration with 2.1,2 (or 2.1.3 if released
soon) the priority, and let''s try to homogenize SAGA versions

I just installed testing on Win using OSGeo4W and the default was simplified.

Hi Alessandro,
I've read the latest version of the QEP and had a look to your repo.
If I'm not wrong the current implementation doesn't provide custom services
as in the initial proof of concept, but gives the opportunity to define
"middlewares" before and after the requests have been processed by the
standard OGC servces offered by QGIS Server. Is it right?

In 64bit OSGeo4W there is 2.1 available for testing.  But the default
version is still 2.0 (as Victor already pointed out).

So, we're a couple of hours out from release and unfortunately I don't
think that master is in a release ready state just yet. There's quite
a few serious blockers in the queue, including #11475, #11457 and
#11455.

But my real concern is that these don't seem to be slowing down - new
blockers are being filed every day. I think we need an extra week for
things to stabilise and slow down before release. This worked really
well for 2.4, which was one of the most stable QGIS versions in the
2.0 series.

Opinions?

+1

I would also prefer an extra week for testing/bug fixing.

Also, the list of "high priority" bugs is still very long. We should not 
only fix blockers, but also some of the "high" ones. There are some 
"high priority" bugs with crashes or severe malfunctioning.

definitely preferable for me.

Hi Andreas

This should be fixed in 8db77f. Let me note that the problem may
happen only with rule-based renderer where some rules have been copied
(to create new rules) while using qgis master. It should not be
linux/kde specific.

Projects where this problem appears need to be fixed by the user - the
easiest way is to select all rules, copy&paste them and remove the
previous rules. This will rewrite their non-unique identifiers to
unique.

Cheers
Martin

The problem is that each version has plenty of changes: modules that
disappear or change name, parameters that are renamed for no reason, etc.
It's a lot of work to keep track of them. The person writing that post has
found a patch for _one_ algorithm and for _one_ version (2.1.2). There are
+300 algorithms, and we support 2 versions, but not 2.1.2 yet and not the
upcoming 2.1.3, which has a lot of changes in syntax.

The idea for the future is to support the latest one, and we have already
talked to the SAGA team to avoid those changes if not really needed. We
also were considering the option of forking the project and freezing it, so
we use our own SAGA and we have no issues when a new one is released
(specially in linux)

Hi Martin,

Thank you very much for this fix. So the problem was actually 
copy/pasting the rules, and not the legend tree itself. After a new 
copy/paste of my rules the problem is indeed gone.

I would assume that this a common workflow. I am most likely not the 
only who copies existing rules and paste them for some changes - 
especially since the context menu offers this option. I am glad this is 
fixed now.

Many thanks,
Andreas

Hi Giovanni,

Thank you for your interest in my work!

You are partially right: the new implementation we agreed upon in
Hessen is loosely based on the Django concept of middlewares, with the
addition of the possibility to add new hooks (callbacks) in the
future.

This implementation also allows for an easy implementation of custom
services though.

In fact, this concept proved to be extremely flexible and unobtrusive
at the same time: a plugin can define one or more "filters" [1] with
an optional priority, the filters have access to server interface [2]
that in turn can manipulate the request handler [3].
By manipulating the requet handler, a plugin can intercept and alter
the input (typically the query string) **before** entering the main
C++ switch for core services and/or can intercept and alter the output
**after** the main C++ switch. The output typically is one of: none
(in case the service did not match), an exception, an image or a
XML/HTML document.

I have developed a test plugin [4] which implements the following filters:

* an HTML remote python console, also implements HTTP BASIC
Authentication to give an example of HTTP header manipulation
* do nothing but logging the result of QUERY STRING manipulation tests</li>\n"
* say HelloServer! and write some lines in the logs
* WaterMarkFilter: adds a watermark image on top of all WMS GetImage requests
* raise and exception, catched in main loop

Have a look to the filters for the implementation details.

For anyone interested in testing, the implementation is in my
"serverpython" branch:

https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/tree/serverpython

PLEASE NOTE THAT in a previous email I gave the address of a wrong
branch, that one above is the right one.:

This is direct port of mmqgis algorithm and currently it works in same way
as original algorithm. Of course it would be much better to use "native"
Processing extent selector here.

Did not tested this yet, but will try to take a look today.

Hi Alessandro,
the concept is clear but I probably I was reading the worng repo:
serverplugins-iface, which is the latest you authored.
In this repo it seems that, in case a SERVICE different from the standards
ones is called, an exception is raised [1], while in serverplugins repo the
workflow is quite different, because the switch looks for plugin available
to process the request.

However, what you're saying is that a plugin can completely change the
incoming request and the outgoin request (I understand the middleware
concept very well being a Django dev) and so:

 - have the opportunity to server a non-standard service
 - have the opportunity to do not let the request reach the QGIS Servers'
request handlers.

I will have a look to the filter examples later.
Thanks for this work Alessandro ;)

I just checked it, and the default is simplified. IT seems to be working
here (i removed all Processing settings and when restarting it uses the
simplified interface as default)

I do not know what might be happening in your machine... :-(

Yes that's an old branch, I have to do some housekeeping :)

The latest branch for server plugins is
https://github.com/elpaso/QGIS/tree/serverpython

In my plans, I first have to get the requesthandler refactoring PR
accepted (it's in the queue), then I will PR the plugins support.

Yes, basically, you can alter the incoming SERVICE value and skip core
C++ services completely, or you can alter the response of a core
service within the responseReady filter (see the watermark example
filter).

Possibilities are endless: give me a regexp and I will change the world :)

You're welcome! Let me know your impressions and suggestions.

In my TODO list I have a better exception handling (more pythonic) for
exceptions raised from the plugins and, within the python plugins, a
mechanism to cache and reload plugins configurations when it is
changed from the desktop, but this is far beyond the scope of QGIS
server plugins and much more into the python side of the topic and
currently crashes QGIS whenever I use QFileSystemWatcher (PyQT bug?).

A blocker-free release makes the most sense.
If postponing helps fixing them (ie: something is on working on them)
then it is very worth it, IMHO.

Hi all.
On Windows 8, the interface for raster calculator is missing the first
dropdown (with "a" raster). Possibly as a result, we cannot complete
the analyses. See error below.
Is this confirmed, or a local problem?
All the best.

Are you using the most recent version? I don't think so. The algorith is
trying to do resampling, and that was removed some time ago. The fact that
you do not have the first layer to select in the interface probably also
means that you Processing is old

Subject: [Qgis-developer] One more week for bugfixing before 2.6 release
Message-ID: <20141024101410.GA26019@norbit.de>

Hi,

due to popular and well-based demand I'm extending the bugfixing phase for one
more week and postpone the release for that period.

Please keep up testing and fixing master to make it as good as 2.4.
Thanks to everyone involved.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Vector equivalent of a VRT
Message-ID: <544A5F20.40206@geograph.co.za>

Hi All,
I've been googling around, but cannot find what I'm hoping for.

Is there a VRT implementation for vector data?

It would be nice to have a single name to load into QGIS for a set of 
vector data (eg SHP files), and as you pan around your 'VVT' file, QGIS 
would open and display only the files relevant to your current view-port.
This is of course very useful for NGI's sheet based vector offering - 
but the VVT implementation need not bother checking for overlapping 
vector data, but simply index by the MBR of each (SHP) file.

TIA,
Zoltan

Surely:

http://www.gdal.org/drv_vrt.html

unfortunately, there is no easy-to use transformation for it.

 From the page:
> The virtual files are currently normally prepared by hand.

And hence QGIS can not save into that format.

Yep. Looking at it now - thanks Alexia as well.

Make that -2 for forgetting that someone mentioned the fact that you can
have vector vrt's to you before on the QGIS mailing list  :-)

Hi Victor,
you're right, it's qgis-weekly, which BTW has a number of oher issues, now solved.
Sorry for the noise.

Does this mean we want to invest in some more bugfixing days, or that we hope more
time will result in more bugfix by volunteers?
In the first case, any ad hoc contribution by users would be appreciated.
All the best.

Ok, must be some unknown local issue then.

Hi all.
After a 3-days course, mostly on Processing, I must say this is not really the case:
several modules did not work in 2.0.8, while they worked in 2.1.
It would be nice to clear up the situation, and provide a more predictable
environment for users and developers alike, but I imagine this would have to be
postponed to post 2.6 release (unless we can profit from the extra week we have for
fixing & testing).
All the best, and thanks.

* today a very "odd"  issue has been reported, and I'm not sure is not
intended behaviour (I hope not)

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11485


* a bad issue is this one

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7540

basically is pretty easy to loose features after
editing/removing/adding a shapefile.


I would like also to discuss about this

* speaking about shapefiles

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11007

long story short: edited shapefiles in QGIS (with the reshape tool,
the split features tool and others) are saved in a "inconsistent"
state (even when removed from the project) and other gis software
(tested many, OS and closed) have issues with them (they show
supposedly deleted features, throw errors because of the different
number of features and records, etc.). Saving the shapefile into a
copy "fixes" the issue.  A patch in OGR, that will be available in
gdal/ogr 2 solves the issue, but only if closing the qgis project or
removing the shapefile from the project. If a user edits a shape and
copy/send it to another person (to be opened in a different software),
without closing the project or removing the shape from it, then the
shape will still be corrupted.


cheers

If we have more funds available, I support the idea in investing more funds
into paid bugfixing.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Missing psycopg2 on Mac OS X after QGIS install
Message-ID: <544BF1FD.8010306@geoapt.com>

On install of QGIS nightly on a "fresh" Mac, starting it up leaves you with:

File 
"/Users/gsherman/Desktop/QGIS_2.5-dev.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/postgis_utils.py", 
line 28, in
     import psycopg2
   File 
"/Users/gsherman/Desktop/QGIS_2.5-dev.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/qgis/utils.py", 
line 460, in _import
     mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: No module named psycopg2



Closing the error box brings QGIS up and it will function, sans the 
postgis_utils...

I know what this means and how to solve it, but should a clean install 
leave the user wondering what's wrong?

It's possible that it wasn't bundled in the nightly.  I bundle psycopg2 in my QGIS, but I also have a standalone psycopg2 installer on my site.

I think it makes sense to keep up with the funded bug fixing if we have the
money.

We could build something - at least for the use case where you want to
create a mosaic of shp files that have the same attributes... But i have to
wonder if there is much point - just importing them into spatialite or
postgis seems like a much nicer approach. You could always dump out
spatially separated shapefiles again from postgis.

Maybe the QGIS testing funding would fix all these probelms? Now it's
funded!

I thought of a vector vrt driver as first part of creating GeoPDF from 
vector and raster layers, as described in 
http://latuviitta.org/documents/Geospatial_PDF_maps_from_OSM_with_GDAL.pdf 
which is still much handwork.

Up to now, only Raster export to GeoPDF is possible via GDAL.

	legend?
Message-ID: <CACfnYnSX56WQ5KDmayT-WEC82uENt1dzRos08JZAFC_j_wtztw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, there is an ongoing discussion about this matter here

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11491

In case you are not aware: if you use data defined fill/border colors
for a vector, the legend will show the symbology classes (in case you
are using the categorized symbology), but the symbol for all the
classes will be a nice black square instead of the expected
colors/borders (let's assume that the user has created the table the
right way, with only one color per class).

There is a technical answer by J?rgen, but anyway a decision must be taken.

Do we expect to see the classes and the (data defined colors)? Or when
using data defined colors we do expect another thing?


cheers

Well, I'm not building a plugin - but rather a bash script, both to keep 
it simple, and to further my knowledge.

So,
My script is working insofar as I am getting a VRT that QGIS (v2.5.0 rev 
b43d131 and gdal/ogr 1.11.0) loads, _but it comes in with zero elements._
For guidance I am using http://www.gdal.org/drv_vrt.html

I have tried wrapping each SHP file in it's own <OGRVRTLayer 
name:shpname>, and below is the version having a global OGRVRTLayer name.

You need to encapsulate the 3 layers in a OGRVRTUnionLayer. A single 
OVRTVRTLayer can only have a single SrcDataSource. And you need to put 
directly the file name, without the "ESRI Shapefile:" prefix.

From the doc :
"""Example: Union layer (GDAL >= 1.10.0)
The following example will return a layer that is the concatenation of 
source1.shp and source2.shp.

<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTUnionLayer name="unionLayer">
        <OGRVRTLayer name="source1">
            <SrcDataSource>source1.shp</SrcDataSource>
        </OGRVRTLayer>
        <OGRVRTLayer name="source2">
            <SrcDataSource>source2.shp</SrcDataSource>
        </OGRVRTLayer>
    </OGRVRTUnionLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>
"""

You don't need to specify the Extent generally.

Thanks Even.
Typical me: I try to interpret the instructions, and not follow the

I still get no syntax errors on opening the VRT, and no features either.
Could it be the 'slashes' in the filename? I would have thought they'd 
be OK because they are in double-quotes:

<OGRVRTDataSource>
   <OGRVRTUnionLayer name="Rivers">
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2730_RIVER_LINE_2006_06">
<SrcDataSource>2730/2730_RIVER_LINE_2006_06.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2731_RIVER_LINE_2006_04">
<SrcDataSource>2731/2731_RIVER_LINE_2006_04.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2732_RIVER_LINE_2006_04">
<SrcDataSource>2732/2732_RIVER_LINE_2006_04.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   </OGRVRTUnionLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>

You likely need to add the attribute  relativeToVRT="1" in <SrcDataSource> so 
that the paths are interpreated relatively to the VRT file.

i.e.

 <SrcDataSource  
relativeToVRT="1">2730/2730_RIVER_LINE_2006_06.shp</SrcDataSource>

You can check with "ogrinfo -al /path/to/your.vrt" to see if it works and if 
there are error messages.

Magic! - It works.
I did have the relativeToVRT in an earlier version, but my syntax was wrong.

I've got some general VRT queries, but I'll start a new thread on those.

Big thanks and enjoy the rest of the weekend.

Right.... with a little help on the VRT syntax, from Even, this script

Subject: [Qgis-developer] VRT functionality
Message-ID: <544D16E5.2070400@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I just want to clear up my mindset as to how a VRT is implemented in QGIS.

I'd like to understand when QGIS opens a file, when it reads the 
contents, and when it writes (if need be) and closes a file.
In this context, I am thinking about SHP files - especially the NGI 
dataset which comes out "cut up" into degree squares.
Let's just deal with 1 feature type: Rivers lines. My VRT looks like:
<OGRVRTDataSource>
   <OGRVRTUnionLayer name="Rivers">
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2730_RIVER_LINE_2006_06">
     <SrcDataSource 
relativeToVRT="1">2730/2730_RIVER_LINE_2006_06.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2731_RIVER_LINE_2006_04">
     <SrcDataSource 
relativeToVRT="1">2731/2731_RIVER_LINE_2006_04.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   <OGRVRTLayer name="2732_RIVER_LINE_2006_04">
     <SrcDataSource 
relativeToVRT="1">2732/2732_RIVER_LINE_2006_04.shp</SrcDataSource>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
   </OGRVRTUnionLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>

  * When I open the VRT in QGIS, does QGIS open ALL the VRT files and
    look for the extent of each of the files?
      o If my VRT had the extents included for each of the files, would
        this stop QGIS from (at this stage) opening the files and
        reading the extents?

  * Before rendering the VRT, does QGIS look at the extents of my
    viewport and only physically open my files and render it's contents?
    In other words, if I first zoom into a known area, then open my VRT,
    will QGIS at this stage still open all the subfiles, instead of
    waiting until a specific subfile needs opening)

  * As I pan around my map, does QGIS open and close the VRT subfiles
    that are out of my current viewing region?

  * Presumably if any of my VRT subfiles touch or overlap my current
    viewport, they would be "processed" depending on what I am doing?

  * Is there a way to structure a VRT file so that you can have access
    to the underlying files that make up the VRT? (Even edit access?)


Or, is the VRT just any easy way to bunch a whole lot of maps under one 
name, and there is no processing benefit depending on the area you are 
viewing or working in?

TIA,
Zoltan

Zoltan,

In fact those are more OGR questions than QGIS questions. QGIS makes no 
difference when reading a plain shapefile (through OGR) or a VRT.

If QGIS issues a GetExtent() on the VRT, then with the above definition, it 
will query the 3 shapefiles to find the extent of each. But on shapefiles this is 
a fast operation.
You could define <ExtentXMin>, etc... just besides OGRVRTUnionLayer if you 
really want fast GetExtent()

Yes, but QGIS probably asks GetFeatureCount(), so it will need to open each 
shapefile, unless you define <FeatureCount> as well.
But QGIS will also asks the field definition, and will need to open each ...., 
unless you define <Field>

>

QGIS will define SetSpatialFilter() on the layer with the extent, so as the 
layer can use a spatial index if it has one. Reviewing my code in VRT union 
layer, I can see that the spatial filter will be forwarded to each source 
layer. So it will need to open them, but the shapefile driver won't scan any 
feature if setting a spatial filter that does not intersect the extent of the 
shapefile, so that should be fast. A possible optimization could be done in the 
VRT union layer to take into account the extent of the source layer to avoid 
iterating on it if the spatial filter on th union layer doesn't intersect that 
extent.

To be efficient, you likely need to compute .qix spatial index on each shapefile.

The VRT driver will maintain a pool of a maximum of 100 source layers by 
default (that number can be altered by setting the OGR_VRT_MAX_OPENED 
configuration option) and will close transparently the older ones

Not sure what you mean by "have access to". But a union VRT can be opened in 
update mode and the update mode will be forwareded to the source layers 
(provided they support it). You can delete or modify features. For creation of 
new features, you need to specify <SourceLayerFieldName> as documented in 
http://gdal.org/drv_vrt.html

Your above VRT should work reasonably fast. Unless you have several hunderds 
or thousands of source layers. In which case, you may need to define more 
optional elements in the VRT to avoid the scans, and there would be perhaps a 
need for some enhancements in the OGRUnionLayer class.

Oh---had it said "Required Components" I might have expanded it and read

It sounds like William has it covered for installs of a released version.

Hi Gary,

Thanks for the feedback! Section is now renamed to:

REQUIRED, Optional and Supporting Components

Btw, you were not the first to run into the problem.  :-)

Regards,

Larry

Hi Even,
Thanks for the detailed thought, and for the effort of reviewing your code.
I'm fiddling with setting up quite a big dataset - likely to have over 
1000 shapefiles in the VRT - maybe even up to 3000 - but I will 
experiment and see what is both logical and practical.
My goal with the above questions is to try to avoid opening all the 
shapefiles at the time the VRT is opened, so that there won't be a 
"million and one" physical disk IOs.
If the user then loads my VRT with rendering off, it should load very 
quickly (if I can supply all the details needed, in the VRT file).
Once the user has zoomed into his/her area of interest, and turns 
rendering on for the VRT, then (hopefully) only the underlying 
shapefiles in that AOI need to be physically accessed.

So, how compatible is the current code when opening a VRT, to zeroing 
the need to open any underlying VRT files before any rendering or other 
operations are done by the user, and if the user is "zoomed in", to 
limiting the underlying VRT file-actions only to those affected by the 
current zoom level?

ogrinfo -al -so gives a lot of info that could be added to the static 
VRT file, but is it enough to stop QGIS's implementation of VRT from 
physically querying the underlying files until absolutely necessary?

Also, when a VRT opened, do you really need all the knowledge (like 
featurecount) at this stage?
One negative of me putting the featurecount into the VRT xml, is that 
someone could change that shape file, and the actual feature count would 
then differ from that in the xml file.

So, probably to negate the direction I am hoping to go in (like putting 
details into the VRT file so that opening the VRT would cause minimal 
disk io), the correct way would be to optimise the QGIS code so that the 
information about the underlying files is only read by QGIS when 
absolutely necessary.


Regards & thanks again for your interest.
Zoltan

Zoltan,

You definitely need to define all fields (otherwise the VRT driver will open each 
file to compute the union of fields) or declare 
<FieldStrategy>FirstLayer</FieldStrategy, the geometry type, the global 
extent. And ultimately, you would also need to declare the extent per layer, 
once an extra optimization would be done in the union layer to avoid opening 
files whose declared extent doesn't intersect the area of interest declared by 
SetSpatialFilter().
I can imagine an enhanced version of ogrbuildvrt, as a python script, that 
would retrieve all needed informations from source layers, could be usefull 
too.
I can imagine also an interesting improvement: you could declare some option 
in the VRT saying that by default GetNextFeature() on the union layer should 
return nothing, except if the area of interest doesn't cover more than X 
source layers, so that when the VRT is zoomed out, one doesn't try to open 
thousands of files.
If you're interested in some of those improvements, you can contact me. 
Perhaps some spatial indexing of the bounding boxes of the shapefiles would 
also help, instead of sequential iterations, but for a few thousands ones, 
that isn't probably necessary yet (spatial indices are generally interesting 
only starting with dozains of thousands of geometries).

I know QGIS asks that in some situations for example when displaying 
informations about layers when opening a multi-layer dataset. You coud likely 
put a dummy value, like -1, since I don't think QGIS uses that except for 
informative purposes.

Yes, there are perhaps optimizations possible on QGIS side as well. If you use 
GDAL trunk, compiled as a debug build, you can use the OGR C API spy 
mechanism. I've added recently to help debugging my improvements in the 
MapInfo driver when I spotted bugs in it when using QGIS. See

OK - some good thoughts there, thanks.

At the moment it is knowledge gaining and experimenting for me, but if I 
ever need to deploy what I am trying to set up, I'll most certainly try 
to influence any possible optimisation - by whatever method makes 
everyone happy to get involved.

Hi Giovanni,

If tinyows and QGIS-Server can't save feature through WFS-T, it's 
probably an issue in the QGIS WFS Client, isn't it ?

Hi Paolo,
you need to set control to OrbitControls.

Hi Nyall,
It might be slightly off topic, but could it be that we need a
different warning? In my experience printing WMS works (only?) if the
output resolution is set to 75dpi. But there is no warning for the
user in case the settings are the default 300dpi which results in the
WMS layer not being printed. (At least in my experience so far.)

Best wishes,
Anita

Since the last used control is saved, I did not consider it carefully.
Now it's ok to change the default controls to OrbitControls, which has
more functions (e.g. arrow-key control and auto-rotation) and is
probably suitable for flat earth.

HI Ren?-Luc, thanks for the answer.

The tiny-ows issue seems to be isolated to the server side (or how I
configured it), as I can't find a client that works.

On the other hand I think there is an issue with qgis-server: qgis as
client can edit/modify with no issues certain features (ex: polygons)
published on geoserver, but the same features published with qgis
server return the error I posted in my first message. If the feature
is generalized, at some point the error when saving does not show
anymore.



cheers

Hi Hugo,

Sorry for my slow response, I was quite busy the last days.

I'll try to explain a bit more what I have in mind.

For example there is the new expression function "getFeature()" which is 
an ad-hoc replacement for a join. I have been told that the performance 
for rendering is not very good, I assume this is caused by a lot of 
requests performed in the background. It would be great to be able to 
join this on the server side.

I would be very happy to see more of this introduced. For example I 
could well imagine a new Expression (Syntax just made up, that can still 
be designed in a more appropriate way)

   avg( c.population ) { LEFT JOIN cities c ON c.country_code = 
$thistable.code }

This should then be locally evaluated (for shapefiles et al) but 
forwarded to the server for database services (postgres and the like).

Now, as we have different backends and their syntax does not always 
match (most do standard sql, but there are extensions, think of ST_* in 
postgis, SDO_* in oracle spatial etc, and there is no guarantee, that a 
dataprovider supports standard SQL) we need an abstraction layer and 
cannot just assume that every dataprovider will understand the same thing.

I am planning to implement this abstraction layer for ordinary 
expressions in the near future. And I would be very happy to see that 
there is a way to extend this with aggregate functions. This will all 
require a fallback level (if the server does not support a given 
functionality, for shapefiles, to be sure that the result is the very 
same regardless of server function implementation details...). We 
already have this for ordinary expressions as we can just use the 
QgsExpression implementation.

I can only repeat, that I will be more than happy to see this fallback 
level implemented by means of sqlite virtual tables. But in my humble 
opinion it would be very unfortunate if there would be no way to 
optimize this tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. That's why I am asking 
if sqlite developers are open to collaborate because if the will to 
collaborate there is missing we will end up having to reimplement this 
functionality.

I totally agree with your statement "A general cross-database SQL 
optimizer would need lots of work (in QGIS and/or SQLite) and may come 
later (if really needed).", but would append "and will require either a 
re-implementation in QGIS, ending up in duplicated functionality" 
(that's what R?gis was worried about in the original mail) "or will need 
the possibility to get deeper access to sqlite's internal data 
structures or callbacks to optimize where required. This will require 
cooperation from SQLite developer's side or forking sqlite.".

Best regards,
Matthias

That project is about making current tests pass and keeping them passing
for the future. Very important, glad it made it !

It won't be matter of a few days, nor it will involve fixing bugs that do
not have a test. But if bugfixes funded for 2.6 will come with a testcase
guarding for them not to come back again it'll be great.

Thank you for the clarification Sandro, this mail has escaped my notice.
I am also glad that this campaign made it. I will make sure that I will 
work on this in the upcoming weeks (not only) to ensure that new test 
cases being written now are taken into consideration.

Hi 

Since I do not have access to a server w/o x server I cannot test it by myself. Does anybody know if a running x server is required to run pyqgis standalone apps? E.g. something like this:

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/home/stefan/Apps/qgis_master", True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()

QgsProject.instance().setFileName(os.path.join(current_dir,  "bpav5000sw.qgs"))
QgsProject.instance().read():

QgsApplication.exitQgis()

I'm not sure if an X server is *always* required, what I know for sure
is that if you are going to use any SVG symbol or HTML formatted text
in a widget, then your script will crash with an ugly segfault if X
(or fake X) is not running.

The X server is required here. QApplication will try to make a
connection to it. QCoreApplication does not - but it brings other
limitations.

Actually there is an easy way to try it out - just set DISPLAY env
variable to nothing:

martin at zenbook:~$ DISPLAY="" python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from PyQt4 import QtGui
>>> app = QtGui.QApplication([])
: cannot connect to X server

(the process is aborted)

Cheers
Martin

I agree. This getFeature() is a symptom that we need more advanced
relational-oriented functionalities.

How would it be "forwarded" for database services ? If the two tables
are from the same db, then ok, we are in the "simple optimization" case
that I was talking about previously : more or less a translation between
SQL dialects.
But what if the current table is a local file (shapefile) and cities is
a postgis table ?
You would then need a magical optimization engine that will say you need
to send the list of local country codes to a remote query like :

SELECT avg(population)
FROM cities
WHERE country_code IN ( $local_country_code_array )
GROUP BY country_code

But actually, the best optimization depends in the general case on the
actual data stored in tables. If the bandwith required to send the IN
part to PostGIS is too important, there may be cases where it is better
to fetch everything remotely and sort and group by locally or they may
be cases where another query would be better.

This is why writing an optimal SQL query is hard and why database
planners do lots of work, rely on lots of heuristics and statistics  and
are hard to implement.

Yes, exactly, and this was to whole point of relying on SQLite and

I really don't think the difficulty is here. Even if we have access to
the parsed SQL and even to the result of the SQLite planner, splitting
the execution plan in optimal local and remote operations is *very hard*
in the general case. And we would have to do it whatever the abstraction
layer we choose : SQLite or our own QgsExpression-based solution.
And I really don't think that would be a good idea to do this in QGIS.

The optimization plan could be: don't try to optimize in the general
case (premature optimization ...), only optimize specific
well-identified cases.
For now the only simple case I can see is when a join is done on tables
from the same database (and the user don't know or can't do a join on
the remote database), then yes we would have to know the syntax of the
original query and translate it into the desired SQL dialect.
And yes it would be better to have it from SQLite. It would require
either to work with the developers, to patch it or to somehow include
the parsing part of SQLite (we already ship sqlite / spatialite with
QGIS right ?). But I really don't see it as a blocker.

I really think using SQLite as our database engine has a good potential.
It could extend the abilities and expressivity of QGIS. And it could
also allow to use *less* code in QGIS (seeing every provider as a
virtual layer). And it could also paves the way for a native QGIS file
format (this is another discussion, but somehow related).

But whatever the implementation is, trying to be (automatically) as
performant as a well-designed query on a well-designed db is a waste of
energy.

On a more pragmatic side, people are already interested and might pay
for db-oriented functionalities in QGIS (the very first need is to be
able to filter joined tables). It does not have to be the only incentive
for design choices, but this is a good opportunity. Then a decision has
to be taken.

So, if it is hard for you and me to agree :), are there other opinions ?
Other arguments for one or the other side ?

In this case I think the sqlite virtual table approach (or any other
local filtering method) should be preferred. That would involve too much
black magic.
There may be some cases where we can mix things (e.g. two parts of a
where clause combined with "AND" where only for one of the two WHERE
clauses a native SQL translation can be found could be performed as a
two-step filter, but that's really not the main point)

I don't think we do ship it but I may be wrong?
Please don't get me wrong, I didn't say it's a blocker. The original
discussion started from R?gis statement "there's a QEP taking care of
relational queries, is there a need to duplicate functionality?" and my
response "I am not sure if sqlite virtual tables will be able to satisfy
all our needs". I was just wondering about the limitations of this
approach and I am still very open to hear about any experiences you had
with sqlite developers (I have none) because that is what counts when it
comes to working with upstream as you proposed.

Yes, we cannot do that. But we can try to find a way that allows
developers to develop and users to create projects independent of
providers while still providing good performance on a capable backend.

I don't want to disagree, I just wanted to raise questions / to
understand the limitations. I see the demand for this functionality and
I see the potential that sqlite virtual tables have to offer. I just
wonder what the performance will be like in a scenario where there's a
network (with latency for every request) involved. And what it would
require to overcome this issue (if there is any).

Matthias

Indeed, I don't know well the sqlite dev community.
I will try to know a bit more about exposure of internal SQLite data
structures.
In the worst case we could decide to fork or include parts of the code
the license is very permissive.

Btw, there is a spatialite / sqlite source distribution in
src/spatialite (probably only used when WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE is enabled)

Ok, but this performance issue is not related to the backend choice
(SQLite or our own), right ?

Hi all, 
this is a very high level topic for me. I will just point out some
user/funder needs, and maybe try to describe other strategies exist in GIS
softs. 

As a user coming from both ESRI and Mapinfo world:

 - The main (and last?) real advantage of MI was its native pseudo-SQL
capabilities (with many limitations). Users really often now have a
centralized spatialDB, where the administrator can do many things (almost
everything in fact), but the classical user has only two possibilies for
relation Db treatments: algorithms or duplicate data in sqlite and learn
spatial sql (unless their DBA grant them to Postgres... ). Power users are
very happy, ex MI users are not in QGIS. 

- Arcgis have no agregate capabilities over its relations.. Joins are more
developped and allow summarize algoithms. To go further, It requires using
an external DB system, and it's a pain (they all have limitations, in term
of cost or learning curve..). Postgis/sqlite is far away in terms of
accessibility

Having virtual sqlite tables would allow some MI-like behaviour. Users here
would appreciate that a lot (I will still be using postgres underneath for
perfs).
 For more simple use cases, some only want to improve joins by being able to
join and output agregate values if multiples tuples join, for simple mapping
purposes. I think UI needs boths things, a SQL dialog to create queries -
Qspatialite-like - on every table, and some agregate capabilities over
joins. 
 What we must avoid is having two different implementations, with differents
limitations. Only power users knowing what is really happening underneath
will know what function to use, which is bad in UX terms. 
A comparison is OGR CSV driver versus CSV plugin... User has to know that
both tools are differents, behaves differently with a different providers.
Nothing in the GUI let you know that except try-fail approach.

BTW, I have the feeling you don't disagree at all but that we are digging
one of the harder features of a GIS tool. IMHO, that really desserves
discussions, prooves of concept.  Any other opinions in dev's?


Cheers
R?gis

Spontaneously: Creating reports based on aggregated statistics, but the

I think in src/core/spatialite there is only the spatialite and not the
sqlite sourcecode. I normally don't compile with internal spatialite
(it's an old version? and I like to stay close to upstream and avoid
duplicated libs). It also opens the problem of name collisions for
linking/hard to handle interdependencies between external and internal
sqlite versions and will require us to manually keep the code in sync
when new versions are released.
It would probably be hard (but surely not impossible) and it will
probably need ongoing effort.
Therefore it would be very welcome if the sqlite community is open to
changes.

The performance issue itself not. The possible optimization we are
discussing now, yes :-)

I've also heard that from others. I think it's a very valid requirement
and pretty much what QEP/RFC 5 by Hugo proposes.

And that's where my main questionmarks are: Will this implementation be
able to make use of postgres capabilities? In particular, a postgres
database has a higher constant per-request cost in comparison to local
data (network roundtrip vs file access) but makes this up through
efficient filtering/aggregation. And if there are problem, how many
possibilities do we have to improve the situation.

The problem is that we have one proposal which can be available soon
with lots of functionality and a not-too-hard implementation. But we/I
lack knowledge if it performs well in every scenario and if it offers
the possibility to optimize.

I also don't think it's disagreement, it's evaluation of risks/chances
involved by either of the two.

Hi,

With the current initiative to get #1 approved by the PSC, I wondered if
there was ever an agreement on the name.

The vote counts quoted below are about even, it seems that currently
there's a tendency in the dev community to use QEP more often than RFC
(probably also because of the name of the github repo) but I don't
remember that there was ever an official decision.

I don't mind too much which one it is but I think it would be good to
have an official statement and clear guidelines what to use.

I would therefore like to ask the PSC and Nathan to decide on this topic
and communicate the outcome.

Thank you very much
Matthias

Hi all.
I noticed two options (Result feature ID's > Invalid source | Invalid reference) are

http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_spatial_query.html?highlight=spatial%20query
Anyone know what is their function? Could you add two lines of explanation to the

Thanks.

The name is QEP, which is what we are going with. Tim asked for the mandate
vote to make me the manager for the topic and that is what I have gone with.

The thing is, we cannot forecast everything, and without a working prototype, 
we will probably never be able to determine the behaviour for every scenario, 
as we probably cannot imagine every scenario at all.

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."

At some point we need some working code to be able to start iterating over 
something real, more than trying to imagine a perfect plan and see nothing 
coming at the end.

QEP are there to make sure the global orientation and design is good and is 
coherent with the rest of the project. They cannot be fully exhaustive, and 
there will probably be other QEP regarding this feature set to enhance and fix 
the first implementation. 
We could even go back if this approach proves to fail. Failure is progress 
too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] size of translations, use a distinct repo?
Message-ID: <5450BC90.2020104@gmail.com>

Hi all,

It seems that the size of the QGIS repo is increasing exponentially 
lately...
 From a quick look, it seems that translations are quite heavy.

If this is correct, wouldn't it be a good solution a distinct repo for 
translations?

Translation would then not be available by default when building from 
source if you don't integrate them (which I think is quite satisfying).
Would it be possible to do this through cmake?
Maybe using git submodule?

I haven't thought that much about it, but I'm just preoccupied that the 
repo won't get to 2gb by the end of the year...

Any thoughts?

Denis

Hi Minoru,
just tested with OrbitControls, and I still can rotate the plane below the surface,
which does not seem appropriate to me.
BTW, I also have the background canvas shown in white, which also looks bad: any
solution for this?
Thanks.

Yeah I think that is a good idea. The repo size is already massive compared
to what it should be.

I have been thinking about the same thing just recently... My slow
internet connection cries whenever I fetch changes from github after a
translation update.

I stumbled upon the same problem ~2 weeks ago:

+1 for using submodules for translations.

It's not premature optimization. It's evaluation of a likely scenario
(at least nobody disagreed with a likely performance problem so far) and
early prevention of a vendor lock-in by looking ahead.

There would also be the possibility to create this feature as a plugin
instead of implementing it in core. I think this has been discussed
before if I remember right. If it's in core it's very unlikely that we
will go back. And going back would certainly not make life easier for
power users.
I don't want to promote the option of implementing it as a plugin, I am
just listing it for the sake of completeness.

I think the most simple answer to my questions would probably be a
statement from the sqlite virtual table developers stating that they are
open to collaboration. That would literally vaporize any concerns I had.
It should not be hard to ask.

But again: I do like the general idea and I see the potential of this!
Please do not treat this message as a fundal disagreement with the QEP.

I guess this is just due to the "location filename" stuff.  That often causes
massive change in the ts files, because lines were added or removed from the
source files - even if there isn't even a changed translation.

I think that is not used at all for transifex and it's not that important to
have in linguist either.

So instead of inventing something new, all it takes might be to add "-locations
none" to our lupdate call, reduce the size of the .ts files a lot (in one huge
commit) and avoid useless tracking of location changes in the future.

Objections?

Indeed it seems it would improve the situation significantly. Can 
someone take care of this?

But more generally, I think the translation could be kept separatly in a 
submodule since I guess most people fetching master to compile it on 
their own don't need the translation files. That would generally slow 
down the growth of the repo.
Anyway, doing this might not be worth it. I don't really know the effort 
required.

Good idea,
if its really translation that causes the growth we should do
everything to avoid that.
Is there any way to "shrink" the already existing repo?
At one point I thought about zipping the ts files - but if there is a
better way .. good!
I always wondered why the whole translations file has to be changed
whenever there are only some small changes ..
moving the translation in it's own github repository: hmm - I don't
know if thats easily possible.. but I am also willing to try it if it
helps the source code to stay clean.

But again - anyway to shrink the already existing source code?
I don't mind about loosing track of translation changes.

Werner

As Jurgen noticed, there are some useless changes in the ts files:

      <message>
-        <location filename="../src/core/qgscontexthelp_texts.cpp" 
line="327"/>
+        <location filename="../src/core/qgscontexthelp_texts.cpp" 
line="319"/>

if there are lines removed/added in the source file, this will cause 
changes in the translation file.
Jurgen suggested to remove these tags "location filename" which would 
improve a lot.

I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be possible.
git submodules would be pretty useful for this matter.

As far as I know, you can't shrink existing repo without destroying the

As a slight side point, according to transifex it looks like we could have 13 fully translated languages for the GUI by the time 2.6 is released (13 languages are on 99% or more). 15 languages are over 95%. This is excellent news.

Is it something we should publise, maybe add to the visual changelog?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems when editing the attribute table
Message-ID: <CAMCJChvd9OWhYDQFwK8mOjWjOrTnLgw7qhnf8L7uvh2pQu3nrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There's a thing that happens to me when I'm editing the attribute table of
layers (both PostGIS and shapefiles) in QGIS.

I change the content of one (or more) fields, but the content displays the
same. I save the editions and continues to show the old value. To see the
changes, I have to close and re-open the attribute table.

I've confirmed and this happens to many people. I confess I've noticed this
from some versions ago (including the current master), and I think I got
used to it, but it is certainly a bug.

As it is a situation that is not easy to replicate, because does not always
happen, I can not open a ticket with truly useful information.

What do you think?

I have to say that initially I was very excited about the idea... and
after thinking about the details I am getting less excited as there
are probably lots of gotchas. Below there is list of questions in the
order of reading the proposal.

** Use cases

- item 1 - in what sense the layer would be "dynamic"?

** Indexes

- how will be indexes requested by underlying providers of primary
sources? Will you add support to providers to return indices
associated with a given primary source? How can sqlite make use of
such information? Are you going to replicate the same indices for the
virtual tables?

- the need to use spatial indices explicitly (with such weird syntax)
is not good - this should be done by DBMS, not by the user. In
practice nobody will use them and the spatial queries will be slow

** Serialization

- I am lost. Are we going to materialize those sqlite views in memory
or to disk? I thought they were meant to be just views wrapping QGIS
layers

** Implementation details

- regarding QgsVectorLayer constructor: to me it does not look like a
case special enough to require a new parameter

- what does it mean the provider would be based on spatialite? a
subclass of spatialite provider - or a copy of it - or something else?

- are the insert/update/delete triggers going to be provided by user
or generated automatically? (I believe it should be automatic)

- how do we find out that the views from virtual layers are actually editable?

- how do we determine whether the view has a geometry - and in case of
multiple geometries, which one to choose? (geometry columns are just
ordinary blobs, right?)

- how do we determine primary key for a view? (for feature IDs)

** Python bindings

- how would I create a virtual layer from Python? I would hope to do
something like iface.addVectorLayer("SELECT * FROM layerX", "virtual")
- would that be possible?

** User interface

- what is the "referenced layers" box for - is it just to inform user
which layers he used? Or does he need to explicitly register those
"primary" layers somewhere?

** Performance

- how will sqlite plan execution of queries?
  - inner join of two virtual tables based on attributes?
  - spatial joins?
- does sqlite have access to any statistics of virtual tables and
indices? These are quite important for reasonable query execution
plans.

- During normal operation when iterating over vector layer there is
conversion: backend -> QgsFeature. As far as I understand the virtual
tables add two more conversions during execution: QgsFeature -> sqlite
-> QgsFeature (first in virtual table implementation, second in new
provider implementation). Is that correct? Have you tried to measure
additional overhead?


In summary:

I have the impression that virtual tables are just a simple way to
provide access to external data to sqlite, not an invitation to use
sqlite engine with "foreign" data. The provided API simply does not
look mature enough. I would not be too optimistic about openness of
sqlite project - the developer list is not publicly available and I
haven't found a link to repository either (except for the commit log)
- but I may be wrong.

Aren't there any other embedded SQL engines that we could use?

Maybe we should have a simple SQL 'SELECT' statement parser that would
parse the queries and then decide what to do with them:
- execute on backend (if all tables are from the same DB)
- execute with existing QGIS functionality (if we have efficient
algorithm for that)
- execute with sqlite engine (with materialized views)


Cheers
Martin

Hi!

I added the suggestion from jef and tried the new produced ts files in
linguist and transifex without any problems ..
So I decided to update everything again (with strings and transifex update) ..
ts files should now have no location inside any more ..
I hope that shrinks down the size from now on.

regards
Werner

Pedro, Frank,

Thanks for pointing that bug out - I've added a bit to it.

Over the last week I've noticed that if I just open the table and change things, it refreshes fine - 
but if I open the table, sort it, then change things the refresh breaks.

Is that pattern repeatable for you?

-ramon.

Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F55011800D6FC@fmexch1.fylkesmannen.local>

1)      Updating of values using Field calculator

Using master, I select some rows in an attribute table (the data is in PostGIS). I use field calculator to update the values of an existing column in my selected rows. These new values will not display until I close the attribute table and open it again.


2)      Row selection (blue highlight)

If I click and drag down or up while the mouse button is still held down, I can select multiple rows. These rows are highlighted in blue. If I do this a 2nd time, when I first click the mouse button, the old selection is still shown in the blue highlight. The old selection highlight only disappears when I am finished with my new selection and release the mouse button. This for me isn't the correct behavior that I would expect.

However, if you select a set of rows, and then make another program the focused window, if then click back into the attribute table and drag a selection (the action of click and drag has to be the thing that gives the attribute table focus back), it displays the correct behavior I would expect (i.e. the previous selection highlight is removed straight after I have clicked with the mouse button).

If I return focus to the attribute table window first and then click and drag, it still displays the wrong behavior.

Is anyone else experiencing these problems? I am using Windows 7. Apologies if these have already been reported.

Regards,

James

"create a dynamic point layer based on X,Y(,Z) coordinates" => if points
coordinates in the underlying layer change, then their geometries can be
updated during the next fetch.
Like for example the creation of a point layer from a CSV file with the
"watch file" option.

Yes we will need something like this in order to properly use indexes of
underlying layers. By populating sqlite_stat* tables.
And yes I realize that may involve replication of indexes.

For the case where more than one index is available on a table, the
xBestIndex method of the virtual table mechanism is made for that: an
estimated cost can be returned for each constraint

Yes it is the Spatialite spatial index syntax.

Yes, they are. They can be part of a project file. The second paragraph

Not decided yet. But it is probably too early in the discussion to go
into such details.

As automatic as possible. But in the general case, it is not possible.
Some columns cannot be updated (computed during the query). Or there may
be more than one possibility to "update" a join.

If an update trigger is defined.

Good points. We will need to pass these information to the constructor,
as it is now with a postgres provider

This kind of syntax (using loaded layer names instead of their explicit
definition) is clean but would require :
* that layers are already loaded before we can use them
* then to save the "loading order" of layers in the project file

The document refers to the use of explicit layer urls.
I don't have a strong opinion on this choice.

Hmmm correct. I did not have any measure yet ...

You mean another powerful, embeddable, open source, spatial-enabled, SQL
engine ?
I don't see :)

Ok, after thinking about issues Matthias and you raised, inclusion of
the syntax parsing part of (a subset of) SQL in QGIS may be needed,
especially to generate spatial index queries ...

I still think we should try to avoid having both your item 2 and 3. We
better have to choose between executing with QGIS or with something else.

Hi Werner,

Thanks for this, indeed last translation commit is indeed much smaller!!!!
Less than 1k lines while it used to be about 50k before.

Cheers,

Denis

Hi!

I am sorry for not realizing that :(
But from now on it should be much better ..
Other thing is that I think about only updating all translations in
source only every two weeks (or probably only in front of a release)
as the translation should be done in transifex anyway. And only
updating the english source in transifex (and master of course).
Pros: even smaller and less commits,
Cons: Some translators often like to see "how it looks like" and I
understand that from time to time you want to see if "it fits".

What do you think about that?

regards
Werner

a) some translations are very difficult to do if you cannot see "the 
case" (sometimes developers even invent terms which don't exist in real 
life!)
b) or translators and their friends want to prepare some presentation, 
teaching, tutorial related material already before the release in their 
own language !

Hi,

Is it possible to write classification scripts for the graduated renderer  
in Python?
I recently had a talk with someone who would like to have an equal area  
classification and might be willing to add it but I'm not sure if it's  
possible using Python or if he would have to use C++.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

We can download the latest ts file from Transifex and build it with Qt
Linguist or lrelease command. So just one time update of translation
files in GitHub before every release is enough for me. I use a batch
file (below) to build it, and then check the translation appearance
with the qgis-dev of OSGeo4W.

The message location information must be heavy for the git repository,
but it may be useful for translators. I use it to find the relevant
source code, for example, to know what string %1 is replaced with (is
it replaced with a number? layer name? or error message?). We can see
the name of context that a message is located, but it is not always
helpful to find the location of message. Without location information,
I'll find the source location using "search from files" function of
text editor, but it is not efficient way.

Is it possible to upload the source ts file with location information
to Transifex, and clean up location lines just before the translation
files are committed to the git repository?


### build_ts.bat
---
call C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\o4w_env.bat

SET TS_DIR=translations\QGIS.qgis-application
SET TS_LANG=ja
SET DEST=C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\i18n\qgis_%TS_LANG%.qm

REM lrelease.exe is included in qt4-devel package of OSGeo4W
lrelease %TS_DIR%\%TS_LANG%.ts

REM backup original file
if not exist %DEST%.orig copy %DEST% %DEST%.orig

REM copy the built qm file

Taht would be appropriate IMHO. Should I open a ticket?

Chromium and FF, same thing. See attached.

Yes, please.

You need to take some steps. Do not change view extent of map canvas
while these steps:
1. save the map canvas as a PNG image.
2. set the background color as PNG transparent color using a photo
editor. I used IrfanView for this purpose.
3. in the plugin dialog, select the image file option in the display
type group and enter the file path in the edit box.
4. set transparency to 1% to enable transmission, and uncheck the
build sides option.
5. do export

works smoothly, thanks. IMHO it would be better to make all this automatic.
should I open another ticket?

Hi all.
I noticed that we still have 8 blockers and 110 tickets of high priority.
None of the blockers seems to me serious enough to stop the release.
Is it confirmed that the release date for 2.6 is tomorrow?

As new crashes are being spotted and reported on IRC, would it make
sense to request a vote for cutting the release, rather than having
it on a fixed date ? In that way each voter would have a chance to
run their own tests before giving the green light...

Hi people,

the new version was just branched off, the new tar ball[1] was made and
packaging can begin and the feature freeze on master is now over.

The new version will be announced once packages for some platforms are

Cool, thanks J?rgen.

Plz let us know when you think we can make this public for the bigger
public:

Anita already created a 'banner' for the frontpage, I will put it on
frontpage.
I will put the visual changelog into the website.
We have to do some little make up fixes in the website.

Hi,

Too early.  I just noticed that I've messed up the splash screen (after I
uploaded the test packages to OSGeo4W).

I've reset the final-2_6_0 tag and created a new tarball.   If anyone already
started packaging, sorry for that.

For whoever needs it, I found out that "git pull" does not update
the local tag, nor it warns about it being changed upstream.

It takes a `git fetch --tags` to update.

Hi Paolo,

I cannot check it right now, but could you open a ticket in Github so that
it does not get lost while time passes ?

Thanks a lot
Michael

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Make error - QGIS Latest (2.6.0)
Message-ID: <CBE92E2B-8108-4AB4-BD11-6DB735E9D816@dimensionaledge.com>

I?m getting the following error with QGIS 2.6.0  latest.   I?m running CentOS65 however earlier today I successfully installed QGIS2.4.0 on the same machine using the exact same steps.
Just wondering what might be different, and what the fix is?
Thanks in advance.

#INSTALL STEPS
scl enable devtoolset-1.1 bash
gcc --version
# gcc (GCC) 4.7.2 20121015 (Red Hat 4.7.2-5)
wget http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-latest.tar.bz2
tar jxf qgis-latest.tar.bz2
cd qgis-2.6.0
mkdir build-master
cd build-master
ccmake28 ..
# In opened table press "c" without quotes.
# set the POSTGRES_CONFIG, and GRASS_PREFIX variables
# press "c" again
# press "g"

make

#And this is the error I get?
