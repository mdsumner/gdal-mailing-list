Seems that your PyQtGraph is outdated. Recent releases 
(https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph/releases) do not contain a 
pyqtgraph/Qt.py.

Have you tried updating it with
$pip install -U pyqtgraph ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is there a recommended GDAL version for QGIS 3.34?
Message-ID: <CAKKm1vH9r6zfXTQyW7RNpfWNXqcbxA8Xxvg8btraV5fYhtTKkA@mail.gmail.com>

I don't actually know/understand how to tell if a given version of QGIS
should work against a given version of GDAL. E.g. can QGIS 3.34 be compiled
against GDAL 3.9? Why/why not?

Is there a recommended version of GDAL for a given version of QGIS? E.g. is
there a recommended version of GDAL when I compile QGIS 3.34?

Background/motivation for asking: I have tried compiling different versions
of QGIS against different versions of GDAL, but some unit tests keep
causing segmentation faults. Could a segmentation fault be caused by a
mismatch of version of a dependent library like GDAL?

Best regards, Thomas

For operational uses, I would say the latter is the better. For 
regression test purposes, some tests might perhaps need 
tweaking/skipping depending on the GDAL version. CI uses GDAL 3.4.1 for 
QT5 testing and 3.7.3 for QT6 testing.

Nobody can guess that. You need to provide much more details: which 
test(s), stack trace when it crashes, etc.

The instructions on the repo tell me, in rather strict wording, to run the
unit tests locally before creating a PR.

The test checkGitStatus keeps failing locally. It does so because GDAL
updates the timestamp of gpkg files, even when only reading them. The
Internet told me that I needed to build against GDAL v. 3.4.2 or greater,
to not have these timestamps updated. So thats what I have spent a few
evenings trying to do. There are other tests that fail too, but this is the
one I chose to look at first.

So it's quite surprising that you tell me CI for Qt5 uses GDAL 3.4.1.
Wouldn't that cause the automatic online test on github to fail? Or have I
misunderstood something? :)

Sincerely, Thomas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to get the rotation angle from the Rotate Tool
 in Advanced Digitizing Toolbar
Message-ID: <d57271ea2c884a5f8b2738eab7dcd470@erdc.dren.mil>

When I run the rotate tool in the Advanced Digitizing Toolbar it pops up a small window that allows you to change the snap to angle and show the angle the selected feature is rotated to.  Is there a way to get access to the angle through python?

        actions = iface.mainWindow().findChildren(QAction)
        self.action_rotate_feature = [x for x in actions if x.objectName()=='mActionRotateFeature'][0]

        self.placed_element_layer.selectAll()

        # Inititates rotate feature action allowing to select a snap to value.
        self.action_rotate_feature.trigger()

My problem is I call this tool on a layer where I programmatically select the features to rotate.  I can see they are all rotating but when I edit my session as below only one of the features gets unrotated somehow,  If I do not end the edit session as below and I allow the user to toggle editing off all the layers stay rotated until I exit QGIS and then QGIS unexpectedly ends.


        if self.element_rotated:
            self.placed_element_layer.commitChanges()
            self.placed_element_layer.endEditCommand()

I have posted the issue about features rotating and then some getting unrotated after the edit session was programmatically ended and the solution provided did not work and after replying I have not yet heard back from the person that helped.  So I though as a work around if I can get the angle from the rotate tool and run the processing tool processing.run("native:rotatefeatures") using that angle I can rotate the features in the layer using that tool.

Hi developers!

I've been wondering if you can have a python plugin installed in all 
current and future user profiles. I'm constantly switching and creating 
new user profiles and it would be nice to have some plugins (such as the 
fantastic Plugin Reloader) on all user profiles.

Is it possible to do so?


Thanks!

I'm not aware off that. Others?

Only solution I can think of, is creating symbolic links?
You could create one 'master_plugins'-dir with your plugins in it, and the symlink that one as 'plugins' in the profile/python folder?
(or symlink individual plugins from that one)?

On Linux you can even copy these and move them around.

I have seen symlinks on Windows, not sure if you can move these around.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

You can use the `QGIS_PLUGINPATH`environment variable to point to a 
shared folder where your install the plugins you want to share. I you 
want to rationalize your profiles deployment accross different computers 
and users sessions, I recommand to give it a try to QDT 
(https://guts.github.io/qgis-deployment-cli/)*.

I'm curious but why do you need to propagate a developer oriented plugin 
such as Plugin Reloader through so many profiles?

Hi,

Thanks for the replies. I like the `QGIS_PLUGINPATH` environment 
variable, I'll try it out. It's more a convenience thing, I'm a plugin 
developer and I have many profiles to work on different 
plugins/environments. And some plugins like the Plugin Reloader, debugvs 
or the First Aid plugin are a must for developers. So I was wondering if 
I could have some "global" plugins.

I'm guessing that if I set the `QGIS_PLUGINPATH` then the user's plugin 
directory is not used? Or can I have plugins in both directories and it 
will still work? I'll try it out anyways, thanks again!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Relation Reference Display on the Attribute Table
 (table mode)?
Message-ID: <8c625692-e97d-4f01-a3b3-806512fb25ca@mail.shortwave.com>

Hi!

I have noticed that that the display value from a relation reference in the attribute table, only works on form mode, showing the display value instead of Foreign key ID. But that does not happen in table mode, where it only shows the display name, if we choose use read only line instead of combobox, otherwise, it will show the FK id until we click the cell for editing it.

Surprisingly, in the Identify Results panel, the display value shows correctly on all situations.

I wonder if this is a bug or a feature request.

Hi,

I have a problem in my QGIS plugin by loading a Tiff with a classified 
raster renderer. Either the rendering is ok, but legend and 
layerproperties are wrong, or the legend is super but the rendering and 
the classbreaks don't go.

Described my problem detailed here:

Please could someone attend to it?

Hello,

Could someone help guide me through creating a heat map like the one attached in the journal article?  Arcgis only allows me to do one for one endpoint/criteria but this journal article used QGIS to generate a heat map that blends two endpoints together.

Many thanks,
Evelyn

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] symbolLayerCount() on many layers crashes QGIS
 3.38..
Message-ID: <SJDV5Y$A831100EEFD39C630816B05F752A2813@opengis.it>


   Good morning,
   I've done a lot of tests and I can't figure it out.
   QGIS 3.36 and earlier do not show this problem, from QGIS 3.38... version the error occurs.

   Situation:
   I'm running code with qgis2web(plugin), if I use symbol.symbolLayerCount() on a single layer there are no problems and there are no problems even if I add further layers (one at a time). But if I use symbol.symbolLayerCount() at startup on many layers the crash occurs. It almost seems like there is a memory error, but why?
   The PC I use is extremely powerful.

   How to reproduce the error:

   Insert many layers into QGIS 3.38.. , even with the same source, use the categorized style on a field with many values.
   Make all the layers visible and start qgis2web, click on Preview (if you have qtwebengine installed) or on Export

   Video:

   I attach a gif of the behavior. First I use qgis2web with just one layer and add the others one at a time.
   Then I reload the plugin and use qgis2web with all layers together and show the error.

   Example project:

   I attach an example project

   Python Stack Trace:
Windows fatal exception: access violation
Current thread 0x00002128 (most recent call first):

Could someone please tell me if Im correct in thinking that the unittest on
GitHub, CI for Qt5, will also fail because GDAL v. 3.4.1 updates timestamps
of gpkg files, even when just reading them. And if it does not fail
"checkGitStatus", then why not? What is different between my Ubuntu 22.04
and the Ubuntu 22.04 that runs tests on GitHub?

I have more tests failing locally than just gitCheckStatus, but I chose
this one as the first one to deal with. And I thought compiling against a
more recent version of GDAL was the solution.

If I've gone off track, or completely misunderstood something, then please
give me a hint to get back on track :)

Hi Thomas,

I would recommend opening a pull request (flag it as draft if not yet sure
if it's ready for review) and see what feedback you get from CI.

You can also run a limited number of tests locally for a shorter feedback
loop during development / feedback for test results. Your time is probably
better spent developing than on getting a fully functional local test
environment, just make sure you don't actually commit any changed gpkg into
the pull request.

Cheers
Matthias

Thanks for the feedback, Matthias :)

Meanwhile, I think I found the reason why this test does not fail on CI.

checkGitStatus does not pass, it skips. And it skips because an
environment variable QGIS_TEST_ACCEPT_GITSTATUS_CHECK_FAILURE is set to 1
in the docker container.

Hi,

? ? ? ?I am not sure this is the correct mailing list, but I am not sure how to deal with this.





I have been receiving spam by a person named Pankaj Sharma?on multiple addresses about a certain?MapSafe?plugin.?It looks like somebody got his hands on the list of plugin authors or something of that sort.? 





Is there a way to discourage such behavior?

Confirmed, I've had a couple of mails from him too.

For what I know, only admins can see the mail addresses of the plugin authors (I can),
but I could be wrong.

For what I he released this plugin shortly (3 versions already, nog so often downloaded).
Not sure if it either the plugin, or the spamming is actually evil though...

Hello Evelyn,

I'm not sure about how to do this. It might be worth emailing the 
journal author (jeanniem at jekyllisland.com) if you haven't already?

If you do get a reply, please share - I am interested to learn too!

Best wishes,
Nick.

I understand asking for donations to help in keeping a plugin up to date, but I have downloaded a plugin that after either a certain time or a certain number of mouse clicks, I now get a popup with every single mouse click that asks for a donation.  That seems to defeat the purpose of open source.  Highly annoying.  I can't even fully evaluate the plugin for my needs.

Well obviously I can modify the code which is what I did to get around the issue, but I wouldn't think that a plugin should be officially posted to the plugins repo if it times out its usage.

Hi Luke, (cc'ing PSC list)

Not sure which plugin you are talking about.

But in my view a 'nagging'-screen to pay for development would be a reason to remove a plugin from the repo.

(Personally I'd even go further and also remove plugins from the qgis repo which only can be used in combination with paid services (they can host the plugin theirselves))

There has also been a plugin spamming plugin devs with mails recently...

Maybe update the rules on which you can put plugins in the official repo?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Agreed.  I see norms as allowing it once per install.

Agreed.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Add a layer using python console - let QGIS figure
 out which provider to use and what sublayers to load
Message-ID: <DU0P195MB2255552805AD4820BAAD31DFA2672@DU0P195MB2255.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,

I am trying to figure out if there is an easy way to add a layer using python API knowing only the file path of the source dataset. I would like to let QGIS figure out which provider to use and what sublayers to load if it is an archive. A bit like if I was drag dropping a file on the map canvas, but using python API.

I am able to add layers using the following code, but this means that I need to add a lot of custom logic to determine what provider to use, and what sublayer to load in case of archives:

from qgis.core import QgsVectorLayer
layer = QgsVectorLayer(file_path, layer_name)
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)


Is there any way to do this with the python API? Thank you!

Best,

Jean-Baptiste PETER

Everytime I compile, I wonder if other people are waiting as long as me :)

I'll start. 80 min. From scratch. Sometimes it takes longer, upwards
110min, but I think that's when the PC runs too hot because it's a warm
summer day. ThinkPad W530 from 2012, i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40GHz, 32GB memory.
This is with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG (not sure if that matters), and
everything else is standard.

On my old Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 with 8GB RAM and 7200 RPM HDD it took about 12 hours.

You really need more cores and faster storage to have reasonable build times.

On an Intel Xeon Silver 4310 (12 cores) with 64GB RAM and SATA SSDs it takes about 2 hours including running lintian on the resulting Debian package.

Embedded systems are not really suitable for building QGIS.

On the RISC-V buildds (Hifive Unmatched) with 16GB RAM and SSD storage it takes about 30 hours.

On the older ARM buildds it takes about 7 hours, same as MIPS. On the newer ones it takes about 1.5 hours.

On s390x buildds it takes about 4 hours.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Also, using ccache helps if you are rebuilding (e.g. because a dependency was
updated).

However, I notice that on upgrade from 3.34.x to 3.34.x+1 it seems there
are no hits.  I don't know if that's because every .c includes,
eventually, a .h with the version, but it would be nice if there weren't
cache misses when there don't need to be.

Message-ID: <CAFRPRniVXr58K-JoqK536Qr+fd8y5Xk4GmGh-CMn--Bm-HY-Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

I want to set up a GitHub workflow to test if the QGIS plugin installation
works fine on Windows and if the tests are passing. This is due to several
installation issues our users have had recently so that we can spot and fix
them right away.

I'm currently using the code below, but it does not test the plugin
installation following the same steps a user would take to install it and
despite this first issue, some tests are failing under this Windows
installation, but passing on Ubuntu-latest.

Does anyone have a suggestion to overcome both installation and testing
issues?

Regards,

Renata.

Is this indeed for a debug build with all default cmake options (with

Dear devs,

Title says it all. Looking at the code, this argument is never used.

I first understood it would stop the algorithm but no.
Sorry for my ignorance?

It is actually https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/a2626a2a427afc5d139061e43ade0e62bafda8ad/src/analysis/processing/qgsalgorithmdissolve.cpp#L303

> I first understood it would stop the algorithm but no.

It doesn't stop the algorithm, the algorithm has to
stop by itself after it detects and report the fatal error. This boolean is usefull
for other classes that would implement feedback to be aware that the
algorithm has to stop, and so act as such, like printing a red colored
message FATAL ERROR for instance.

This is how I understand the rationale of this boolean.

Hi Julien,

I was referring to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/0b11a7c36c446c37534c3c4c8f25c803640b780a/src/core/processing/qgsprocessingfeedback.cpp#L62-L69.

Looking at the calls to this method in the algorithms, I came to the same explanation as you.
But maybe I was missing something...

Thanks !
Nicolas
