Message-ID: <20060702180810.65e96e7f.takubo@saruga-tondara.net>

Dear all,

 I have some questions about some features of QGIS.  
I would like to know how I can customize QGIS or 
embed QGIS features into custome application.
Please teach me current status, future plan or other useful 
information about following question.

1. multiple map canvas 
 Some month ago, it was discussed about multiple map canvas 
implementation. Have you decided how multiple map canvas 
work (combination of layers, projections, etc...) ?  
And these features including release 0.9? Or more future plan?

2. embedding map canvas 
 So splitting Qgis features into some libraries, we can embed 
Qgis feature into our own applicaition in 0.8? Is threr any example 
for embedding map canvas into custome appllication? 
And can I embed multiple map canvas into one application 
(so can I create MDI application ) ?

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS w/ postgis 1.1.2
Message-ID: <20060704122901.635aa7fe@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear devs,

I have set up a fresh env using PostGIS 1.1.2 on Postgresql 8.1 (debian
testing) and QGIS Preview1 Release (selfcompiled).

My environment:
SELECT postgis_full_version();
POSTGIS="1.1.2" GEOS="2.2.1-CAPI-1.0.1" PROJ="Rel. 4.4.9, 29 Oct 2004"
USE_STATS (1 Zeile)

SELECT version();
 PostgreSQL 8.1.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by GCC cc (GCC)
4.0.4 20060507 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.3-3) (1 Zeile)

QGIS refuses to load data without OIDs (which is disabled by default in
Postgres8).

The error is the following:
The table has no column suitable for use as a key.

Qgis requires that the table either has a column of type
int4 with a unique constraint on it (which includes the
primary key) or has a PostgreSQL oid column.

In the debug-output it seems it is looking for an OID-column, but my
database does not have them enabled.
As stated creating a unique index manually makes QGIS able to load
the dataset. 

Aparently it fails of neither OIDs nor indexes are available for the
data.
I have imported the data with v.out.ogr from GRASS which does not
create a unique index nor a uniqze constraint on the id-column
(ogc_fid).

I do not have much insight in the postgres-stuff but I like to have a
nice and easy solution to make it easy to show imported datasets in
PostGIS from QGIS. I am not quite sure if this is a QGIS problem or
even a GRASS (v.out.ogr) problem which does not create an index. Going
save would be just add a unique constraint on the ogc_fid-column which
should be done by OGR?!

Best regards

	Stephan

Hi Stephan.
We solved this changing postgres settings (with-oid), but we agree it is quite 
unconvenient. Otherwise, we define a primary key on the ogc_fid, but we agree 
that it should be easier (either from GRASS or from QGIS side).

OK, thanks. for the record, in Postgresql 8.1 the value
default_with_oids = on in /etc/*/postgresql.conf needs to be activated
manualy, since it is not enabled anymore.

Then QGIS does not complain anymore, but this is not a nice solution,
if one tries to not use OIDs.

I'm currently trying to overload the canvasPressEvent from QgsMapTool in my

Subject: [Qgis-developer] updating data from multiple algos simultaneously
	on canvas
Message-ID: <39f4276e0607050304w49927603u3c6dfb54e861b9bc@mail.gmail.com>

hello everybody
i am using QGIS 0.7.9
Aim of my plugin: To display points received from various algorithms
simultaneously on canvas.

Situation is like on top of map i am displaying location of points received
from a client-socket using TCP/IP. It works fine till only one such socket
is opened and read from .Updation and movement of points goes well. But as
soon as i start reading from multiple client/sockets and try to display data
, all situation goes awery. Then only data from recently activated
socket/client is updated and displayed. This is where i am looking for help.

How i have implemented: For storing data from various socket i am using
QHash with key as socket Descriptor id and Value as in a QList.
For each readyRead() received signal i gets i add in hash with correspondent
socket descriptor as key.
here is part of code i am putting:

// this slot will be called for newConnection() signal
void tcpCock::activatingNewConnection()
{
     tcpSocket=tcpServer->nextPendingConnection();
    connect( tcpSocket, SIGNAL(disconnected()),tcpSocket,
SLOT(deleteLater()));
    connect( tcpSocket,SIGNAL(readyRead()),this,SLOT(updatePixmap()));
    //provide a connect for linking socket exiting status to one of slo
which disconnects drawShape() from refresh signal.
    connect(
tcpSocket,SIGNAL(disconnected()),this,SLOT(socketDisconnected()));
    pIntQlist= new QList<int> ;
    hash.insert(tcpSocket->socketDescriptor(),pIntQlist);
}


//drawshape() function defination for QgsMapCanvasItem's pure virtual one
void tcpCock::drawShape(QPainter & p)
{
    //load the pixamap to be displayed
    QString myFileNameQString= "/home1/qgis/images/cock/cock.png";
    QPixmap myQPixmap;
    myQPixmap.load(myFileNameQString);


    QHashIterator<int, QList<int>* > itr(hash);
    while ( itr.hasNext())
    {    itr.next() ;//possible outcome of error
        //tempList=itr.value();

        QListIterator<int> tempListItr(*itr.value());
        tempListItr.toBack();
        y=tempListItr.previous();
        x=tempListItr.previous();
        QgsPoint qpt(x,y);
        QPoint pt=toCanvasCoords(qpt);
        move(pt.x(),pt.y());// added to check for movement of all
elements-questionable
        p.drawPixmap(pt.x(),pt.y(),myQPixmap);
      }
}


//This slot will be called for every readyRead()signal
void tcpCock::updatePixmap()
{

    QTcpSocket *tempSock=dynamic_cast<QTcpSocket *>(sender());
    if(tempSock)
    {
    QHash<int, QList<int>* >::const_iterator itr=hash.find
(tempSock->socketDescriptor());

    QString st;
    QDataStream in(tcpSocket);
    in.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);
    if( tempSock->bytesAvailable() <= 0 )// changed from tcpSocket since
tcpsocket will look for newely activeted connection only
    {
        //cout<<"\nNothing    Available for reading";
        return;
    }
    in >>st;
    int i=0;
    QChar *data = st.data();
    while (*data!=' ')
    {
        ++data;
        i++;
    }
    QString s1=st.left(i);
    x=s1.toInt();
    QString s2=st.mid(i+1);
    y=s2.toInt();
    itr.value()->append(x);
    itr.value()->append(y);

    move(x,y);
    QgsRect r=mQGisApp->getMapCanvas()->fullExtent();
    setRect(r);
    show();
    updateCanvas();
    }
}

What i feel is not ok with this piece of code is i am not able to address to
canvas item corresponding to  data received from each client.  To avoid it
i am  drawing  each  canvas item again  at their last available location in
hash.value() ie list. But output is that only newely created socket -canvs
item is updated.
While using gdb i observed with 3 client connections. Every canvas item
starts again from location provided by newly activated client. and after
that all follow the path.
kindly help me in this matter.

this is in rference to my previous post about plotting input from multiple
algorithm on canvas coming through sockets.
it is solved.
i did a silly mistake. I was reading from a wrong socket.
In slot updatePixmap() which will be called for every readyRead() signal,i
had opened stream on wrong socket descriptor wwhich was pointing to latest
opened connection.
in place of Q
QDataStream in(tcpSocket)
i should had used
QDataStream in(tempSock)
which did all the trick.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Polygon clipping/fill problem
Message-ID: <44ACAE94.7090708@mrcc.com>

I have discovered a problem with polygon fills reminiscent of the issues
we had on OS X at 0.7.4. This occurs when rendering a polygon with a
large number of vertices.

I suspect that this is related to the changes in 0.8 from a custom
canvas to the Qt canvas, although I have not researched it to be certain.

This is a major issue. I have opened ticket #173
(https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/173) which includes screenshots of an
example rendered in both 0.7.4 and 0.8.

Hi,

my configure (without --with-qt-pkg-config) fails with:

./configure.orig: line 9149: `    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(QT, QtCore QtGui

I have pkg-config version installed (version 0.20) on Ubuntu  6.06 LTS

It seems that PKG_CHECK_MODULES simply is not defined and consequently
bash fails even if the block is not processed.

Is it necessary to use PKG_CHECK_MODULES? It seems to be just another
shit like all the auto* staf is.

I get the same thing on Mac OS X.  No pkg-config installed for me,  
and I don't want to.

I ended up commenting out that line (there's actually a couple of  
them I think) so I could build without pkg-config.  I didn't want to  
use the suggestion of installing pkg-config just for this.

Hi,
anybody here is using Qt 4.1.4? I cannot move widgets
interactively with mouse in designer and I cannot add
new widgets. Is it known problem.

Radim,

I'm using Qt 4.1.4, and designer works fine.

Yes and in a new widget there is no layout. Changing
position in x/y input boxes works only if moved by mouse
the new position is somehow lost.

Ubuntu Dapper Drake, I have compiled Qt myself, I am going
to try 4.1.2.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with GDAL formats as plugins
Message-ID: <16331.69.129.24.86.1152287370.squirrel@webmail.kyngchaos.com>

(This is a clarification on Greg's message in the qgis-user list)

I have a few formats in my GDAL built as GDAL plugins, for various
reasons.  This includes GRASS (raster and vector), JasPer JP2, MrSID, and
a new Kakadu JP2 plugin.  With all these enabled, when adding a raster,
there are many JPEG2000 choices, and all except the first have the same
menu text so I can't tell which is which.

JPEG-2000 part 1 (*.jp2 *.JP2)
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)
MrSID [not the actual text, I just shortened it here]
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)

Disable MrSid and that drops to:

JPEG-2000 part 1 (*.jp2 *.JP2)
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)
JPEG 2000 (*.jp2 *.j2k *.JP2 *.J2K)

Disable Kakadu (just JasPer now), and the same 3 choices are available. 
Disable JasPer and enable just Kakadu, now there are no JP2 choices to
load rasters.  Enable just the MrSID plugin, and the MrSID and 2 JPEG 2000
items are available.

Why is Qgis ignoring the Kakadu GDAL driver?  I can't try this with Kakadu
built into GDAL, only as plugin.  The GDAL programs see and can use the
Kakadu driver plugin just fine.  Since only a few of the available GDAL
formats are available in Qgis, it must be something programmed into Qgis?

Why are all JP2 drivers shown (and with multiple menu items for each)? 
The only way I know of to choose an *input* format driver in GDAL is to
set the GDAL_SKIP environment var to tell GDAL to ignore drivers.  But
maybe there is a way when using the libraries?


This is with my Qgis Mac Universal build of 0.8 preview.  Happens both on
PPC and Intel Macs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] rendering current line in Grass digitizer is very
	slow
Message-ID: <20060707231052.1cefdbd7.werchowyna@epf.pl>

Hi,

Lines in Grass digitizer are being drawn really slowly on pretty fast
computers [1]. The more vertices the line has, the slower the
rendering. The bug affects only the line being currently digitized, ie.
if you just try to modify an existing one by moving or adding
single vertices rendering is fast. But when you digitize a long line,
with each vertex added the rendering speed decreases.

To reproduce:

1. Open a Grass vector in Grass digitizer.
2. Start a new line (or boundary) by putting the first vertex. See how
smoothly the line is drawn as you move the cursor with mouse.
3. Now digitize 10, 100, 300 etc. vertices. See how much slower the
rendering gets with each vertex put. Note the slow-down does not depend
on the zoom level or the amount of features being displayed. The only
"reason" for the slow-down is the amount of vertices you have put in
the line being currently digitized.

Is this a known issue? Is my description clear? Could it be fixed?

Using SVN 0.8 of yesterday, Ubuntu Breezy and Dapper.

GRASS edit in 0.8 is using QgsRubberBand (XOR rendering
does not work anymore IIRC) and it is probably slow because
it is not designed for complex graphics.
I dont know if it can be improved.

Is it possible to add entry in legend view without usind addVectorLayer()
and addRasterLayer from plugin.
I am curretly reading some points from named pipe, displaying them on canvas
as canvas items.There are multiple algo writing to fifo. I want to make a
entry for each in legend view but i couldn't find anything in qgsiface.

Brendan,

I would be extremely carefull to commit 'extensive remodelling' to svn head 
before 0.8 is out. In my opinion, this is a good thing for after 0.8 or for a 
branch. I think we will have a lot of new bugs when making changes in the 
core of qgis and i am worried that 0.8 will never come out.

Hi Nitin,

Currently not. In your case, i think you could put the points in a vectorlayer 
and add this vector layer to the legend. It seems to me that your program 
which reads from pipe is a kind of data provider (and thus could inherit from 
QgsVectorDataProvider). So all you need to do is to add this provider to a 
vector layer and add this layer to the legend. Like this, it would fit nicely 
into the qgis layer/dataprovider philosophy. Is this right or are there 
reasons why it can't be modelled like this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS: attribute-editing
Message-ID: <20060711093056.6a29def7@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear devs,

I have an understanding problem ot the attribute-editing-popup in
GRASS-edit-mode.

When I start to create a new GRASS layer, added an attribute-table and
start to digitize a new object, the attribute window pops up and
one can enter attributes corresponding to the digitized object. So far,
so good.

In the middle of the attribute-window there is a "New" button, which
creates a second entry in the attribute-table linking to the same
geometry object, right?

I do not really understand the usecase where double entries in the
attribute-table for one geometry oobject are necessary.

If someone could elaborate on this usecase I would appreciate it.
Otherwise I would suggest that the "New"-button is only clickable when
no attribute-entry for the geometry is in the table, otherwise it could
be greyed out?!

But perhaps I do not understand the usage of this button correctly at
the moment so please forgive.

Thanks for your comments.

Cheers

	Stephan

This is for either:

geometric element, or

geometry (vector).
A bit intricate, but very powerful.

OK, understood. I have not yet found any usecases for this yet.

in GRASS-terminology this is called 'layers'. yes, understood too. But
I thought this goes to a different tables (linked to different
'layers').

The different 'layers' are very powerfull indeed, but I think I do not
get it right here in the use with QGIS. I thought this is done through
the 'layer' selector in the edit-dialog.
?!

Hi,

macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES should not be dependent on whether pkg-config
is installed.

As this is an issue for more people I suggest that qt4 detection with
pkg-config should be removed - those who will need it can apply a
patch.

Currently I'm away from my development computer for a long time so
anyone feel free to revert my changes in autoconfig stuff...

IIRC we have not decided completely how will multiple map canvas work.

There's somewhere a feature plan for 1.0 release but I don't remember
the URL, you can try to check qgis-dev archives.

I have done some work on this already, but I would call it rather
alpha state - if you're adventurous enough try to checkout
lib-refactoring-branch from SVN and use qgis core and qgis gui
libraries. Some information is also on wiki but not finished. I'll get
to this back in september when I get back from holidays.

i think it may not be.
I don't think i could call named pipe as vector data source. It is more of
asynchronous which i can ultimately desire to save as  one of the
postgis/shape file(i am looking to work on that later since i curently have
no idea in this regard.). Also that data from pipe can keep on coming for 18
minuets asynchrnously, so i am treating it as  non stop data, also how many
thread will push data on pipe are not static.
Iam also no able to intrepret it" So all you need to do is to add this
provider to a vector layer and add this layer to the legend". I think it
mean simply add it as a vector lyer and  to legend. but what about updation
of it which may flicker badly if again a layer is refreshed completely.
only some points may get changed.

Now i am thinking  2 ways of doing it.
First:  use QgsDataProvider then provide functionality for all the
functions.i feel i ned to work out on Spatial refrence system. These Points
currently i am intrepreting over map but i want them to come independently
of map. SRS i am good at. This concept is very weak of mine. Then Projection
WKT, for simple points defining latlong location what i can feed to it. No
idea.
Then how to keep updating it, same issue.
Second is extension to my current plugin which display points read from fifo
on canvas using qgsmapcanvasitem. Then i am thinking of generating a grid
kinda view with each row for each element updating them continuously for
location . What i also looking for is if i click on any item on canvas it
should get highletd with correspondent or vice versa.i need to capture click
event of canvas but i need to work out here how to capture click( which i
think cnavas provides) and associate it to one of the object.

I need help on above issue. I think ihave cleared well what i am thinking of
doing. Any suggestion or guidance is open heartidily welcome.

Digitizing Grass vectors is too slow for production in 0.8. I'll have to
get back to 0.74, in spite of it's own bugs.

Too bad, 0.8 has so many other advantages...

Is there any chance to make this working as it was in 0.7.4 also with
qt4, probably before 0.8 will be stable?

I am with Macieks opinion that this should work well in 0.8.

Message-ID: <20060713110552.586269ed@butan.gdf-hannover.de>

Dear users, developers,

the new preview of QGIS 0.8 is out now, and we have updated the manual
from 0.7.4 to 0.8. 

I would like to invite you to browse through the current PDF-manual[1]
and give some feedback
* if everything is up to date for 0.8
* if some features are not yet included
* if typos are there (prof-reading of native-english-speakers)
* ...

In order to ship a (mostly) up-to-date manual with final 0.8 I like to
force this now.
I am dreaming of a fully translated manual for the 0.8 release which
means that we will branch off a translation-branch from current trunk
(of documentation-repo) where translations could be started soon.

But maybe only a dream?!

Comments welcome.

Best regards

	Stephan

Stephan,

I like this idea?
I'm also a dreamer about professional documentation for QGIS.

Recently, I started to update polish translation of QGIS UI
and I hope to include it in 0.8.
So, I can work on polish translation of the manual if you're interested.
Just give me a note how to procede.

Can you be more specific what is slow? Drawing the map,

I have read some information on the wiki.
And I tryed very simple embedded app to test. It was only diplaying shp file  
but I haven't tryed to implement any other features in it. 
I'll try lib-refactoring-branch later and try more complexity.

Hi,

WMS " is scheduled to be resolve soon.
It is not a question of life or death but it could be very useful in my
case.

Thx

Rendering *everything* gets slower and slower as you put new vertices
when digitizing line or boundary. For that you can't zoom/pan
efficiently. I have described how to reproduce the problem in my initial
email in this thread.

Very cool. I have updated the german GUI translation recently.

Nice. I will put a note on the wiki for interested people. Doktoreas
has also shown his interest in translating into italian when we are
ready with the 'master'.

Hi,

SVN commit https://svn.qgis.org/trac/changeset/5594 made some changes to
the legend - two columns have been added to contain icons for whether the
layer is in the overview, and whether the layer is editable. In my view,
these extra columns make the legend unwieldy, especially since the columns
don't have anything in them for most of the time (one needs to select
'Show File Groups', and then click on the + symbol to see the icons).

Version 0.7 of qgis did this much better, and I'd prefer to not have the
extra columns and icons in 0.8 until they can be better integrated into
the legend.

Comments?

Regards

Gavin

Hi Nitin,

It seems to me that your plugin is special in its real-time behaviour and 
canvas update mechanism (only draw new elements) and i agree that the vector 
provider/ vector layer interface are not well suited for this. 
But on the other hand your plugin feeds vector elements into qgis and you 
require functions like selection of features and insertion into the legend 
(and there perhaps reordering with other layers?). This functions are already 
written for vector layers and it would not be good coding style to rewrite 
them for canvas items.
For me it seems a better solution (at least in long term) to extend qgis such 
that it may handle real time data sources (as layers) in an appropriate way.

cheers,
Marco

Checked out and compiled. Nice. Let me post some comments from a
user-view.

I often have layers with long legend-names for classificated data. So
with this new columns I need to horizontally scroll often, which is not
very elegant.

What do you think about changing the icon of the layer to something
which indicates that it is editable (Pen?) or in overview (glasses?).
There is the problem then, what should happen if the layer is editable
and in the overview (pen with grasses?)

Perhaps there is an easy option how to integrate the icons in the
legend?

Since I am no programmer I cannot give much input here.

Cheers
	Stephan

Hi Gavin and Stephan,

I also don't like the new columns as they use too much space.

I may provide some background information why the support for overview glasses 
dropped away in 0.8. The main reason was that one legend layer may contain 
several files which can be in different editing/overview states. We had a 
similar problems with the 'allow editing' checkbox or the visibility checkbox 
at the legend layer level. The solutions for the first case was to grey out 
the 'allow editing' checkbox if there are several files in one layer. The 
solution for the second case was that the checkbox has an intermediate state 
which is displayed if several files under a legend layer have different 
visibilities.
Maybe a similar solution could be done for the icons: if there is only one 
file under a layer, the glasses/ pen is drawn on the layer pixmap (they of 
course have to be very small). If there are several files under a layer, they 
are drawn to the legend file pixmap.
What do you think?

I agree that the added columns make the legend unwieldy. Adding the 
icons is useful but the layout should be cleaner.

The "Label" caption and primary row of each layer should be full table 
width. The "Ov" and "Ed" labels aren't very meaningful when the icons 
aren't visible. Is Ed someone who pops up to help confused users? :) The 
layer names shouldn't be truncated for things which appear only in lower 
rows.

Rather than using separate top-level columns, I would just append icons 
at the end of lower rows as needed. To explain the icons, I'd use the 
yellow roll-over tooltips.

If the icons are used, they should also appear on the second row of the 
layer. When there is only one file, the icons are the same as the file 
row. For multiple files, there needs to be tri-state versions of the 
icons like the dashed and checked version of checkboxes. For example, a 
pencil icon drawn with dashed rather then solid lines would indicate 
that a layer had multiple files, only some of which are editable.

For 0.8, we should either do some additional work now to improve the 
layout or else postpone this until later.

Obviously Qgis has some great strengths in its integration with GRASS
but...

Udig is a very polished and useable app as it stands, and its WMS and  
WFS support is amazing, nice U.I. also.

Perhaps some collaboration would do some good?

Just some food for thought!

Yes indeeed its a nice project, but since its written in java and QGIS
in C++ it somewhat limites the scope for collaboration :-(

Being the culprit behind r5594, I'd better add some commentary...

As per my commit message:

"QGIS used to do this already before the move to Qt4 - however the new
QIcon idiom only seems to allow for square icons, therefore it is easier
to split the results out to several columns and give them their own
QIcons."

Each QTreeWidgetItem only appears to allow for 1 icon and 1 piece of
text per column, therefore I can't see how you can just append more
icons without also appending more columns...?

Also, I added the column headers back in because then you can at least
resize the columns yourselves if your layer names are long.

As for layout, are we *really* that scared of a horizontal scroll bar?
Or have I missed something?

Thanks for the feedback, anyway.  I'm finding it's a dance between what
the users want vs. what Qt4 can give.

Hi,

I've since discovered that the shape file I did most of my testing on 
has somehow become corrupted. Running ogrinfo on that file produces 
rubbish, and the backtrace that I put in trac was from that file...

I only moved to another file when I tried to upload it to trac and found 
that the original file was too large.

Qgis now crashes immediately when trying to load the original file, and 
the backtrace indicates a problem in strncpy() in the OGR code :)

hi marco,
for simplicity i avoided implementing as one of dataSources. I will upgrade
to what you had told later.
 Currently i added a tablewidget to my plugin which displays my desired
current location on map. I wants to make mouse interactive with my elements
on anvas in the sense that whenever there is a click on such item ,
corresponding entry in the table will be highlighted or table will scrolled
to that entry. For this i used QgsMapCanvas::xyCoordinates signal. This i
had connected to one of slot ion my plugin. Now issue here is from same
class QgsMapCanvas signal renderComplete() is being propogated to my plugin
but xyCoordinates() is not. Can you suggest what could be the source of
problem . i also found in QgsMapCanvas::contentsMouseMoveEvent() signal
xyCoordinates is continuously being emitted.

Can you guide me in my approach or there is some other better way by which i
can achieve it.

regards
quickNitin

That would be nice - I'm working on Mac OS X frameworks for a bunch  
of support libraries, and the GEOS framework will probably be C-API  
by default.  (But the C++ API will still be available)

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly

disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely  
inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 0.8 release
Message-ID: <750C5C6C-BC03-4FD8-AC92-3A6510DC9D24@mrcc.com>

Greetings,
As we continue to move towards a 0.8 release, I'd first like to thank  
all of you who are contributing to the effort through bug fixes,  
patches, documentation, translations, and filing bugs.

At present we are 75% along with regard to issues in 0.8. I would  
encourage you to feel free to work on the remaining issues. Many of  
them are assigned to me in Trac, however that is just the default  
assignment that takes place when you open a ticket. It doesn't mean  
I'm working on them (in fact at present I'm not working any, but  
rather concentrating on the Windows build and documentation).

If you have time, please reassign those tasks you want to handle and  
fix them. You can easily view the 0.8 milestone tasks here:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/query? 
status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=milestone&milestone=Ver 
sion+0.8+Release&order=priority

or create your own custom query in Trac.

One issue I would like to address in 0.8 is the context help for all  
dialogs. This isn't a new feature, the hooks have been there since  
0.7, but it has never been fully implemented. Most dialogs have a  
help button already, its just a matter of hooking them up. I'll post  
something to the list on how to do this if you want to "wire up" your  
dialogs. I have a web application to create and edit the context help  
that goes in the sqlite3 database. This application assigns the  
unique context id for a class base on a hash of the class name.  If  
you are interested in contributing to writing context help, let me  
know and I'll get the application online.

The user guide has been significantly updated and is ready for  
review. If you review the guide, please note your comments by page  
number and send them to this list. Stephan Holl provided a draft of  
the user guide for review at: http://www.gdf-hannover.de/holl/tmp/ 
QGIS_user_guide.pdf. We'll continue to edit and get it ready for  
release, in the meantime please feel free to provide comment and  
content if you see something missing.

Remember, anyone can contribute to QGIS, whether it be code  
contributions, bug fixes, bug reports, documentation, or simply  
supporting other users on the mailing lists and forums. Financial  
contributions to offset our server and hosting costs  are also welcome.

Thanks to all

BTW, I reported Ticket #202 and attached patch fixing the reported bug.
So, I left the ticked open with hope someone will check it and commit
the patch to the repository.

Just an idea, may be it could be reasonable to create new mailing list
qgis-docs for doc writers? May be some docs contributors that are not
programmers would prefer to have such a list?

SH: +1 
This a good Idea. I would vote for it. So we could separate the
doc-stuff from the more user/dev-related postings.

Also translating issues, which will surely come up soon, could be posted
to this list.

@listadmin: Does this make lots of work?

I would volunteer to keep an eye on the queue if needed.

cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding Context Help
Message-ID: <92E49CD5-91CA-4FDA-BE5F-8065E07AA243@mrcc.com>

To add context help to a dialog:
1. Add the identifier to the header file for the dialog class:
       static const int context_id = 1173513647;

2. Include the header in the class implementation (.cpp) file:
     #include "qgscontexthelp.h"

3. Add a helpInfo() function to the class and add the call to run the  
help viewer:
    void QgsNewConnection::helpInfo()
    {
      QgsContextHelp::run(context_id);
    }

4. Connect the Help button on the dialog to the helpInfo() function

The context id is generated based on the class name. You can stub in  
-1 and I'll add the appropriate id. If you want to generate the id  
yourself and you have Ruby installed, you can do it by running irb  
(the interactive ruby interpreter) and calling the hash method on  
your class name:

irb(main):001:0> "QgsMyClass".hash
=> -923915736

The resulting number is the unique context_id.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] why the old qgis dev list is still mantained?
Message-ID: <44C49DD7.7020805@o2.pl>

Guys,

Is there a reason why qgis-developer@lists.sourceforge.net is still
mantained? I thought the only qgis dev list address is
qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org.

I noticed I miss a part of qgis related discussions due to being
subscribed only to qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org, while people keep on
posting to qgis-developer@lists.sourceforge.net often, and the
discussion is continued using this address. Such discussion are not
forwarded to qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org, so many can't participate! I
noticed this accidently, when I fetched my old email box which I used
for qgis mailing lists months ago, where I found
qgis-developer@lists.sourceforge.net threads which never appeared on
official qgis-developer@lists.qgis.org.

And qgis user lists - the same (didn't check that)?

Dear devs,

I like to add a test (and learn more about QT) to in the
GRASS-toolboxbrowser which should disable the delete-button, if
the map which should be deleted is currently displayed.

Therefor I found 
	void QgsGrassBrowser::deleteMap()
and/or
	QgsGrassBrowser::selectionChanged
in src/plugin/grass/qgsgrassbrowser.cpp. Which chould be the right
place?

I am new to QT and therefor do not know how to receive the maps
which are currently displayed.

<pseudocode>
QString map = mModel->itemMap(*it);
QString displayedmap = <howtoaccess?>;

if ( map == displayedmap )
{
	/* grey out delete-button */
	mActionDeleteMap->setEnabled(false);
}
</pseudocode>
	
Thanks for any help

Its supposed to be. I have to get the SourceForge admins to shut down  
the mailing lists.

When I see posts come into the old list I attempt to redirect them to

Hi all,

I modified current svn such that the overview icon and pencil icon are drawn 
on the layer icon if the layer has only one file (a tristate would also be 
doable without much effort).
One problem is that the icons for point/line/polygon are in dark colours and 
the overview/pencil icons are not well visible. So it would be good if 
someone could make brighter point/line/polygon icons (because i'm not good at 
designing icons).

Hi,

I have at least extracted all the projections which require updating
from +proj=stere to +proj=sterea in QGIS 0.8.

In Proj 4.5 beta and Gdal 1.3.2 sterea is used in GDAL for 14 European
stereographic grids (18 listed below, but 4 are duplicate "deprecated"):

$ grep -B1 '+proj=sterea' /usr/local/share/proj/epsg | awk '/^#/ {print}
/^</ {print $1" "$2}'

# NAD83(CSRS98) / New Brunswick Stereo (deprecated)
<2036> +proj=sterea
# Pulkovo 1942(58) / Poland zone I (deprecated)
<2171> +proj=sterea
# Pulkovo 1942(58) / Poland zone II
<2172> +proj=sterea
# Pulkovo 1942(58) / Poland zone III
<2173> +proj=sterea
# Pulkovo 1942(58) / Poland zone IV
<2174> +proj=sterea
# ATS77 / New Brunswick Stereographic (ATS77)

It is necessary to update this in QGIS before 0.8 release to spare users
problems and possible data corruption.

Sorry I can't do it myself. I hope this tip helps though.

This is a first one:

echo "UPDATE tbl_srs SET projection_acronym = 'sterea' WHERE
projection_acronym LIKE '%stere';"|sqlite3 resources/srs.db

The 'stere' in column parameter is even harder, but I cannot

It is not only about updating. Also deprecated should be removed (?) as
they contain errors (eg. the EPSG 2171 has a huge one), and their new
substitutes should be added (eg. 3120 is a fixed 2171). Moreover, there
are completely new systems, at least 3328 is.

Moreover 2, there've been other changes in the EPSG database in last
moths; the issues I'm reporting here is only one of them.

Cheers,
Maciek

Hi All

As you know we are using q3 canvas in Qt4. Qt ported QCanvas in the
commercial version of Qt4, but Ive just found out that its also
available under open source now...see below.

That is not completely true. TT have release QtCanvas for free which
as Q3Canvas port for Qt4.

Hi qgis devs,

I'm trying to compile QGIS at the computer of a workmate (suse 10.1). When the 
autogen.sh script is run, the following error message appears:

autogen was run with the following options:

Any autotool guru can help me with this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS X frameworks for support libraries
Message-ID: <83AC37D6-9AB8-4630-8CCA-84ABDEE637CF@kyngchaos.com>

Ready to be released into the wild.  In a beta sort of way.  The idea  
was to make them more Mac-like - bring them out into the open more,  
not hidden away in some invisible folder, and thus make them more of  
a drag-n-drop install, and hopefully more of a standard for other to  
use in their own software.  While also keeping them easily usable in  
a normal Unix sort of way.  They could be also easily embedded in Mac  
application packages like other normal frameworks.

So far I'm sticking to the basics needed by the various GIS  
applications, and it's Tiger only right now.  It's possible to make  
them Panther compatible, but it's a hassle and I just want to get  
them working and tested first, and get feedback.  All are universal  
binaries.  All can be installed with a simple drag-n-drop to /Library/ 
Frameworks.

Included are:

- Xerces framework - this was easy, there is a framework build in the  
source already

- SQLite3 framework

- FFTW3 framework

- FreeType framework

- UnixImageIO framework - a bit of an experiment.  This is an  
'umbrella framework', loading just the framework is the equivalent of  
loading all the individual libraries, that is all their symbols are  
available directly from the framework.  It's just for image formats,  
and they include GIF, PNG, JPEG, JPEG2000, Xpm and TIFF.  Mostly I  
just wanted to avoid the clutter of many small frameworks.  If this  
doesn't work out, I'll think about doing individual frameworks.  The  
individual libraries are still available within the package for use  
as normal libraries.

- PROJ framework - a big problem was the datum grid files.  The NAD  
grids are constructed at build-time from source ASCII tables, thus  
making them specific to an architecture for endianess.  I patched  
PROJ so that it will read little-endian grid files on both PPC and  
Intel Macs, and do byte-swapping on PPC Macs.

- GEOS framework - the default here is the C API, not C++.  The  
normal C++ library is available as well.  I need to look into the  
possibility of packaging both as an umbrella framework, like the  
UnixImageIO, then both would be available with a single -framework  
GEOS option.  I'm not sure if having C and C++ in the same library  
will cause problems or not.

- GDAL framework - This is similar in scope to the UnixImageIO  
'umbrella' framework, but not an umbrella FW.  All the support  
libraries for the various formats are embedded in the package and can  
be used in the normal library capacity by themselves.


To make them more easily used in Unix porting, there is a 'unix'  
subfolder in the package that will behave as a normal /usr/local sort  
of prefix, so most configure scripts should work without changes.

The exception would be the UnixImageIO framework.  Used as a  
framework, configure would have to be changed so that all tests for  
the various image libraries test the same '-framework UnixImageIO'.   
But in a pinch, the 'unix' subfolder could still be used to get the  
individual libraries.


To go along with these frameworks, there is a new GRASS build  
available.  First, it uses the frameworks above (installed  
separately).  And, it's a double-clickable, drag-n-drop installable,  
Mac application, and of course Universal.  It can be installed  
anywhere, it's not fixed to /Applications and nothing else is  
installed in other locations (like /usr/local).  I decided for now on  
using Abracode's OnMyCommand Droplet as the base for the  
application.  It simply fires up a Terminal to start GRASS in the  
standard CLI way, including starting the GUI (in X11 or Aqua, however  
you have your preference, but it defaults to X11).

One big problem I had to work out - the stroked font files.  Like the  
PROJ datum files, they are constructed at build time.  I did the same  
kind of patch - font files are fixed at little-endian, and the font  
loading routine byte-swaps on a PPC.


The frameworks are mostly movable, given the right processing.  They  
could be altered to be embeddable in another .app package.  Library  
locations are handled by using install_name_tool to change them to  
relative paths.  I'm not sure about GDAL plugins yet.  Other data  
paths have environment and funtion controls to set them.

But, I didn't do this for GRASS since that defeats part of the  
purpose of having libraries or frameworks in known, standard  
locations - reduced duplication, easier to update all applications.   
Why bloat BOTH GRASS and QGIS by 90MB?  And MapServer and PostGIS  
don't really have (and won't have) an application package to put them  
in.


All the utilities that come with the various libraries are also  
available in the Programs subfolder of the framework.  It may mean  
more in your shell PATH, but they're there.


Next, I'll work on rebuilding QGIS to make use of the frameworks.   
Which will make another good test to help iron out usability issues  
of the frameworks.

When they are stabilized, I intend to replace my current /usr/local- 
based installers with the frameworks and switch over Mapserver, PHP  
and Postgres+PostGIS to use them.  I may then work on making them  
Panther compatible if there is enough interest.


That's it for now, but I may have forgotten something.  Try them  
out.  They won't get in the way of the standard installers, and are  
easily removed if desired.  Comments welcome and encouraged.

Hi William

This is really excellent! Ill give it a try asap (as soon as I have
removed all the old libs I got from you cleanly etc).

Are the frameworks relocateable? IE if I want to stick the gdal & proj
frameworks into an app bundle, will i need to run otool rename on them
or not? Im guessing I will?

This is really good news...

Regards

Tim

Hi folks,

I just wanted to say that I've had a bit of a browse at the Qt4.2 docs,
and yes I too am salivating at the thought of getting Graphics View
integrated into the QGIS map view.

I personally think it would be good for:

1. Tool tips of features
2. Dragging around features
3. Rotating the map
4. Doing a pseudo "3D view", a bit like how some car satnavs do it (as
you can do an affine transform on the Graphics View).

Also we could convert our selection routine over to the Graphics View
routines.  If TrollTech have done their homework then it means less
headaches for us (and more time available to implement GISsy things).

One thing I would caution against is dumping all the contents of a
freshly-opened layer onto the QGraphicsScene at once, as I (for example)
have some layers with millions of objects on it.  A little bit of
thought may have to go on here to add more items on as you pan, and
maybe remove them when they go out of view.

Also, we will have to see if the speed tradeoff is worth it (-:

In other news, I think the new Undo framework will also be a great
benefit.  I'd been eyeing off the Qt Solutions undo framework for a
while (and wondering if it was worth replicating it), and so I am glad
that they've brought it from behind the shroud.

Finally I downloaded the Qt4 rsync and it's currently failing to compile
(red lava lamp goes on!), so maybe we're still dealing with vapourware.
(-:

OK, I discovered what causes the problem (but not why, as I don't know the GNU 
autotools very good).

in acinclude.m4, there are two lines:
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(QT, QtCore QtGui Qt3Support QtNetwork QtXml QtSvg QtTest >= 
$QT_MIN_VER)
...
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(QT_TEST, QtTest >= $QT_MIN_VER)

On the suse10.1 system, these lines are written into the configure script 
while on my system, PKG_CHECK_MODULES is not present in the configure script.

Could it be that on suse10.1, autoconf has a problem with those lines and 
therefore does not generate the needed shell script code but writes the lines 
into configure as they are?

cheers,
Marco

Hi

I think this error is related to some pkgconfig stuff that was added
to auto* for qgis. There was somediscussion about whether it was a
good idea or not and if I recall there was a way to disable use of
pkgconfig.

Here are a few configure options I would try:

export PKG_CONFIG=    #to invalidate the pkgconfig path

QT_TEST_CFLAGS
              C compiler flags for QT_TEST, overriding pkg-config
QT_TEST_LIBS
              linker flags for QT_TEST, overriding pkg-config

Also it might be worth googling the mailing list archives for
pkgconfig as I think ways to disable it were mentioned here before..

Sorry if above was no help at all :-(

Regards

Tim

I tried building some stuff (that compiles fine under 4.1.x) both
under win and linux with the qt4.2 snapshot it failed miserably... I
didnt have time to investigate why but it seems like you are right,
its not ready for prime time yet....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] LaTeX newbie questions
Message-ID: <1154054751.2781.27.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi folks,

Given my newbie experience with adding in documentation, I had a couple
of issues.  In each case, I am trying to get a nice presentation in the
PDF output of the User Guide:

1. How do I get tips, figures, etc. to be placed in-line?  Figure 5 (the
picture of England) now appears on PDF page 28 when its reference in the
text appears way back on page 25.

2. How can I get the index to appear in the bookmarks of the PDF viewer?
Currently it goes from "Building Plugins" to "Cited literature" (with
"Cited literature" bookmarking to the first page of the index!)


By the way, I consider my next task is to go back through my commit logs
and fill in the fine details of the User Guide accordingly.  (That's the
main reason my commit messages are so verbose, actually.)

Thanks!
Brendan

You can suggest [h] to place the picture 'here'. Sometimes the only  
way to get the picture to place close to your text is to use  
clearpage (but that can leave a half a blank page in the middle of no  
where so its not always desireable....

For me the index does appear....there

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS X frameworks beta 2
Message-ID: <7AD2E2F5-A92B-42CB-B537-042D6204D506@kyngchaos.com>

Fine tuned a few things.  For all frameworks, they should work in  
Panther now (10.3.9).  It was simpler than I made it sound ^_^  I  
also switched to disk images for distribution because I was having  
problems with Apple's zipping.

The GEOS framework includes both normal C++ and C APIs in one.  So,  
saying -framework GEOS is the same as saying -lgeos -lgeos_c, like I  
do with the UnixImageIO framework.

For the UnixImageIO framework, I linked the unix/lib/*.dylib's to the  
framework itself instead of the internal libraries, so no messing  
around with configure scripts should be needed now.  And that  
effectively hides the internal libraries.

Curl was added internally to the GDAL framework for the Panther  
compatibility.

I may have broken something else, and there may still be other issues  
to work out, but it's beta.


To go along with this (sorry for the cross-posting on this), another  
GRASS.app beta.  It now should work in Panther (but I haven't tested  
it much there).  I made it automatically start X11 if not running  
already.  Updated to today's CVS snapshot.


As an example to use the frameworks, here's part of my GRASS  
configure line:

./configure --enable-sysv --with-freetype --with-freetype-includes="/ 
Library/Frameworks/FreeType.framework/Headers/freetype2 \
/Library/Frameworks/FreeType.framework/Headers" \
--with-freetype-libs=/Library/Frameworks/FreeType.framework/unix/lib \
--with-gdal=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs/gdal-config \
--with-proj --with-proj-includes=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/ 
Headers \
--with-proj-libs=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/unix/lib \
--with-proj-share=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/Resources/proj \
--with-jpeg-includes=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/Headers \
--with-jpeg-libs=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/unix/lib \
--with-png-includes=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/Headers \
--with-png-libs=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/unix/lib \
--with-tiff-includes=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/Headers \
--with-tiff-libs=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/unix/lib \
--with-cxx --with-sqlite \
--with-sqlite-libs=/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/unix/lib \
--with-sqlite-includes=/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/Headers \
--with-fftw-includes=/Library/Frameworks/FFTW3.framework/Headers \
--with-fftw-libs=/Library/Frameworks/FFTW3.framework/unix/lib \
--with-tcltk-includes=/usr/local/grasslibs/include \
--with-tcltk-libs=/usr/local/grasslibs/lib \
--with-x --without-motif --without-glw --with-opengl=x11

The Tcl/Tk libs are an X11 build.  I left out the various DB options,  
you would use those as you normally would.

Notice how the includes point to the Headers folder in the  
frameworks, and the libs point to the unix/lib in the frameworks.   
Since the actual binary of the library is the framework name, the  
unix/lib has a normal lib*.dylib symlinked to the framework binary,  
so detecting and using -lfoo works.

If a *-config script is used, like for GDAL, the script will give you  
the correct -framework and include flags to use.

Regarding the bounces - we run rbl filters on the server where the  
mailing list is hosted. Unfortunately your ISP seems to have landed  
up on the black list - probably because one of their clients is  
sending spam through it (perhaps their machine has unwittingly turned  
into a spambot). You will need to ask your ISP to a) identify the  
culprit and b) afterwards apply for revocation from the rbl listing.  
Follow the link at http://www.spamcop.net/bl.shtml?193.17.41.7 for  
more details.

Has anybody compiled QGIS using Qt 4.1.4 on OS X? I'm getting a bunch  
of odd include errors and it appears that things are not in the usual  
place:

In file included from /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.1.4/lib/

Interestingly enough I only have one copy of it in my QTDIR:

I thought this looked familiar.  In rebuilding Qt today, therefore  
looking at my Qt notes, I found my note about this - Some (many?  
all?) of the headers in Qt assume a normal unix bin/lib/include  
structure, so the includes in the frameworks are not found.  So,  
#include <QtCore/qnamespace.h> looks in QTDIR/include/QtCore/, which  
doesn't exist.

Normally the framework mechanism takes care of this so <QtCore/ 
qnamespace.h> would get translated into QTDIR/lib/QtCore.framework/ 
Headers/qnamespace.h, but that doesn't seem to be happening with  
QGIS.  It needs the -F [dir] option to work, similar to the -I option  
for normal includes.  dir is the folder containing the frameworks,  
QTDIR/lib.  So maybe QGIS isn't adding this on a Mac build (I haven't  
got to Qgis yet today).

My quick-n-dirty solution was to add symlinks in QTDIR/include to the  
framework Headers folders:

include/QtCore -> ../lib/QtCore.framework/Headers
...

Hi

If you are a translator for QGIS we would like to acknowledge you in  
the about box in QGIS. To do that we need to get an up to date list  
of everyone who has contributed translations for QGIS.

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner

I have started the above wiki page, and it would be really great if  
all translators could add (or update out of date info) themselves  
there with an email address (in mangled form if you like e.g. tim  
[dontspamme at] linfiniti.com. Your name will also be included in the  
AUTHORS file that shups with the source code of  QGIS.

Having a central list will allow new translators to collaborate more  
easily with existing translation efforts.

Many thanks for all the hard (and often unacknowledged work done by  
the translators!)

Regards
