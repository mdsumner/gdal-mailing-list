It is feasible if QGIS exposes those algorithms and they are
documented. I tried myself to implement the GPS processes in QGIS, but
I could not find any docs about them, so I did not know how to call
them. As loong as there is a way of calling them, they can be wrapped
and included into SEXTANTE

Hi Larry.
Yes, this is what we were discussing about with Alessandro Pasotti. Unfortunately it
has not been implemented for the usual, cronic lack of time and support.
All the best.

It's an excellent idea. It would be great to be able to use those commands
via the Model Builder.

I have rule on view  to insert values in database. I noticed that something
change since version 1.7.4.

 

CREATE OR REPLACE RULE "_INSERT" AS

1.8 not save Default value to field id_upr defined
(nextval('gji_id_upr_seq'::regclass)) but 1.7.4 same job did OK.

 

Can anybody confirm that behaviour.

Subject: [Qgis-user] Query Layer / Rule Based Rendering Problem

I have created a query in the DB Manager SQL Window (data is in a
PostGIS database). The query is then added to the map as a layer.

I copy the style from another layer (rule based style), paste it to my
query layer and the polygons disappear from the map and QGIS gives a
nextFeature() without select() error. This also happens if I apply a qml
style file to the layer.

If I change the styles back to Single Symbol they do not come back. I
can see the records in the Attribute table, and I can select them and
zoom to them on the map, I just cannot see them. 

I have to re-add the query layer using the DB Manager SQL window again.

It only seems to be the polygon layers that cause problems at the
moment.

Does anyone know the cause of this?

The main issue right now with native QGIS algorithms is that they are
implemented in c++ (if not counting fTools and GdalTools), so binding
them to the python SEXTANTE interfaces would be cumbersome. A solution
would be to port the core SEXTANTE interfaces to c++ and add Python
wrappers to PyQGIS. I could help here if you are interested in doing
that.

Subject: [Qgis-user] Query Layer / Rule Based Rendering Problem

I have created a query in the DB Manager SQL Window (data is in a
PostGIS database). The query is then added to the map as a layer.

I copy the style from another layer (rule based style), paste it to my
query layer and the polygons disappear from the map and QGIS gives a
nextFeature() without select() error. This also happens if I apply a qml
style file to the layer.

If I change the styles back to Single Symbol they do not come back. I
can see the records in the Attribute table, and I can select them and
zoom to them on the map, I just cannot see them.

I have to re-add the query layer using the DB Manager SQL window again.

It only seems to be the polygon layers that cause problems at the
moment.

Does anyone know the cause of this?

Yes because SEXTANTE is written in Python :-)

but QGIS is only exposed via Python and C++ so it has to be called
that way.  Most of the other apps it calls are command line based apps
and hence calling the executable make sense.

It seems to me that the package is in good shape. All blocking issues are fixed,
apart from a dubious one:

I agree,

in the last days a few regressions have surfaced but thanks to the
effort of many people they have been fixed.

Today it has been reported #5692 that would need a check by OsX users
and packagers as it seem to occur only on Mac.

The list of the other "outstanding issues" (issues "causing crash or
data corruption" that are not regressions since 1.7.4) is also not too
bad. It would be nice to have look to this
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5239 (interpolation causes crash) that has
a patch attached and also to this http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4819
(identify causes freeze).

cheers

Hi!

It's just the translators would need a bit more time to finish the
translations ..
There were already some translations but I think we should at least
give them a week to work on ..
So please let's wait a few days more ..

kind regards

By "the package" are you referring to the GitHub master branch? Or is there
a separate 1.8 branch somewhere that is being prepped for release?

I have also been getting build errors from the master branch on several OS
X installations due to misconfigured library loading paths:

[ 39%] Building CXX object
src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_gui.dir/symbology-ng/qgssinglesymbolrendererv2widget.cpp.o
dyld: Library not loaded:
@executable_path/../Frameworks/qgis_core.framework/Versions/1.8/qgis_core
  Referenced from:
/private/tmp/homebrew-qgis-HEAD-MyK5/build/src/crssync/../../output/bin/crssync
  Reason: image not found

I'll try to dig in this weekend and nail the problem down.

It is not a regression or anything, but is there any chance someone could check this?:

It is a one line fix for a long-standing bug.

Thanks,

A simple question - how can I run qgis with a different language to
test the translations?

I tried to no avail
LANG=fr_FR qgis
LANG=fr qgis

Do I have to install any packages (Linum Mint 12 / Ubunu 10.10)

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to use sextante svn?
Message-ID: <1338629448583-4978712.post@n6.nabble.com>

is there a way to know which version of sextante dev. version qgis is using?
i have installed tortoiseSVN, assigned the right (?) url to
C:\Users\skampus\.qgis\python\plugins\sextante folder
(C:\Users\skampus\.qgis\python\plugins\sextante) and made first time the SVN
checkout and then SVN update.
all is ok and tortoise log tells me there is the r211 version, but qgis
doesn't seem to recognize the correction victor & c. made. 
for instance, the error in saga idw model, already fixed, for me still
exists.

do i have to do any other operation?

please check that in
C:\Users\skampus\.qgis\python\plugins\sextante
you have
about  core    fusion  grass  help    __init__.py   lastools	  mmqgisx  otb	
parameters	r     script		 SextantePlugin.pyc
algs   ftools  gdal    gui    images  __init__.pyc  metadata.txt  modeler  outputs
 pymorph	saga  SextantePlugin.py
and not a sextante subfolder.
Then it should work.
All the best.

Hi Evgeniy
Probably a stupid question, but have you looked at v.generalize code in GRASS?

Hi

Yes. But when I looked at the description and code I didn't
notice topology-related parts that I could use. Maybe I should
have another look, a deeper one. Thank you for the suggestion.

Message-ID: <4FCA5CC8.1090200@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

building for Debian Squeeze/Stable, I see that SIP is on 4.10 and PyQt4 
is on 4.7.
So if someone else can confirm, we can remove the note for Debian around 
line 200 in INSTALL text:

SNIP>>>

/!\ Note: For python language bindings SIP >= 4.5 and PyQt4 >= 4.1 is 
required! Some stable GNU/Linux
distributions (e.g. Debian or SuSE) only provide SIP < 4.5 and PyQt4 < 
4.1. To include support for python
language bindings you may need to build and install those packages from 
source.

Not sure for SuSE, but probably stable SuSE is also higher? Then the 
whole paragraph can be removed

Regards,

Richard

Topology is embedded in GRASS, so there should not be much spcific in the
v.generalize code itself.
Perhaps you can contact directly the original author of v.generalize.
All the best.

Hi all.
We recently noticed strange problems with the visualization of rasters.
Transparencies are applied automatically, some layers are not displayed even if no
custom color is selected, etc.
We'll inspect this deeper tomorrow, but in the meantime: did anybody see the same?
All the best.

Ok I am going to wait a few more days - please let me know when it
would be reasonable to close off the translation period and proceed
with the release.

AFAICS the "Control rendering order" checkbox is not checked.

Display the "Layer order" panel (View->Panel->Layer order) or tick
the checkbox to control the rendering order of layers by their
position in the TOC.

Anybody checked this http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5620 ?
It seems to me that compilation fails on a clean system (without
previous QGIS installed).

Also, there is a pull request:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/159
and a final check on raster styling, who is giving us trouble (I'm doing more checks).
All the best.

I noticed this also, but thought it was my messy environment. Funny 
thing is that if I build QGIS myself and install master somewhere in 
~/apps/qgis/master it is not finding the core lib (and I have to set 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH for it), but if I build branch 1.7.4 it is find the core 
lib without setting the PATH?

Yes I had, and after setting it to ON, if I compile I see the exact 
error message as in #5620

BUT.. actually I was talking about RUNNING QGIS from the install dir..., 
so maybe I'm having another issue then you talk about?

So I am glad that we have another few days to get that cleaned ..

Translators asked for some days more .. So from my point we can do a
call for packaging on wednesday .. If somebody finds this bug ..

The nightly builds apparently don't have that problem - and I suppose their
build environment can't be any cleaner. 

There's no RPATH fiddling, but the tests are run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
build/output/lib (see debian/rules).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] inheriting QgSGeometry with 3D,
	topology and CAD functionality
Message-ID: <033B262233FE9A4EA813A4F43F963515113EB33C@SRV362.tudelft.net>

Dear developers,

Thanks for the great efforts put into QGIS- the versatile and clear layout API and bindings to python help us greatly in the design of our custom (/academic) (structural) geologic field acquisition tool, DigiFract.

On behalf of Martijn, our c++ developer who currently seeks to implement some 3D geometry (/CAD) functionality, we have a few questions.

We want to extend QGIS with geometries that support two important features. The geometries should:
(a) 'live' in three dimensions and function both as a QgsGeometry and CAD object. For the CAD functionality we use OpenCascade (http://www.opencascade.org/).
(b) support the possibility to 'share' vertices.  Notice that  by 'sharing' we do not mean based on proximity by sharing vertices between different geometries.

We had the following design in mind:

We create a VertexSet that stores vertices in 2 or 3 dimensions. we want to create a XGeometry class that is derived from qgsGeometry. The XGeometry class has a reference to a VertexSet object. The geometries stored in a XGeometry object are actually indices of vertices that are stored in the VertexSet. So a line geometry is represented in the XGeometry object by: [1, 2, 3], indicating the indices of the vertices that span the line. Because the VertexSet can be shared by many geometries, vertices can easily be shared.

This would seem like an ok design (in my view), however, the qgisGeometry class is not designed as a base class. Unlike some other classes in the QGIS API, it contains no virtual functions for example. If it did, I would (re-) implement a few virtual functions (such as the ones that are used to read and write a geometry object to file for example) and it would almost seamlessly integrate into QGIS without too much effort (ok, this is extremely naive of course).
Our questions are:
(1) Since qgisGeometry is not designed with virtual function. Does anybody have any suggestions how we could tackle this problem in a nice and elegant way?
(2) QGIS build-and-install seem not to have an automake with configure. Is the most straightforward way for compiling our custom (QGIS derived) library by placing it in a QGIS_source and adjusting CMakeLists files? Is there a better way?
(3) QGIS shows well equipped to support our custom class and academic software design for structural geologic purpose, aiming at better integration of some GIS and 3D CAD functionality. We are interested to learn from and contribute  to those in QGIS community with similar aim. We notice how some 1.8-2.0 QGIS design aiming at, for instance, refined topology handling, but true 3D CAD is most probably not in the scope of QGIS development. Anyway, interested to learn who might have a similar development goal.

Kind regards,
Nico Hardebol, on behalf of Martijn Stroeven

Qgsmapcanvas class object takes a long while during its refresh specialy when there are more than thousand feature on the canvas, its look very ugly, what to do?

The nightly builds apparently don't have that problem - and I suppose their
build environment can't be any cleaner. 

There's no RPATH fiddling, but the tests are run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to
build/output/lib (see debian/rules).

Dear developers,

Thanks for the great efforts put into QGIS- the versatile and clear layout API and bindings to python help us greatly in the design of our custom (/academic) (structural) geologic field acquisition tool, DigiFract.

On behalf of Martijn, our c++ developer who currently seeks to implement some 3D geometry (/CAD) functionality, we have a few questions.

We want to extend QGIS with geometries that support two important features. The geometries should:
(a) 'live' in three dimensions and function both as a QgsGeometry and CAD object. For the CAD functionality we use OpenCascade (http://www.opencascade.org/).
(b) support the possibility to 'share' vertices.? Notice that? by 'sharing' we do not mean based on proximity by sharing vertices between different geometries.

We had the following design in mind:

We create a VertexSet that stores vertices in 2 or 3 dimensions. we want to create a XGeometry class that is derived from qgsGeometry. The XGeometry class has a reference to a VertexSet object. The geometries stored in a XGeometry object are actually indices of vertices that are stored in the VertexSet. So a line geometry is represented in the XGeometry object by: [1, 2, 3], indicating the indices of the vertices that span the line. Because the VertexSet can be shared by many geometries, vertices can easily be shared.

This would seem like an ok design (in my view), however, the qgisGeometry class is not designed as a base class. Unlike some other classes in the QGIS API, it contains no virtual functions for example. If it did, I would (re-) implement a few virtual functions (such as the ones that are used to read and write a geometry object to file for example) and it would almost seamlessly integrate into QGIS without too much effort (ok, this is extremely naive of course).
Our questions are:
(1) Since qgisGeometry is not designed with virtual function. Does anybody have any suggestions how we could tackle this problem in a nice and elegant way?
(2) QGIS build-and-install seem not to have an automake with configure. Is the most straightforward way for compiling our custom (QGIS derived) library by placing it in a QGIS_source and adjusting CMakeLists files? Is there a better way?
(3) QGIS shows well equipped to support our custom class and academic software design for structural geologic purpose, aiming at better integration of some GIS and 3D CAD functionality. We are interested to learn from and contribute? to those in QGIS community with similar aim. We notice how some 1.8-2.0 QGIS design aiming at, for instance, refined topology handling, but true 3D CAD is most probably not in the scope of QGIS development. Anyway, interested to learn who might have a similar development goal.

Kind regards,
Nico Hardebol, on behalf of Martijn Stroeven

Message-ID: <4FCC8E12.80203@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I run an analysis in sextante, then load the resulting tiff, which displays
correctly. If I open the properties, a 100% transparency is applied to both 0 and 1
values, so the layer is transparent. It is possible to revert this, but it is
nevertheless very annoying. If this is confirmed, it is a regression.
Anyone?
All the best.

It seems to happen only with sextante rasters, so it may be an option in the creation
of tiff.

rpath may be disabled, I thought it could be the problem.
(Un)fortunately I am not able to reproduce the problem anymore.

I suggest you make a fork of the qgis project github repository.
(https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS)

You can add new members and functions by simply subclassing
QgsGeometry. If you really need to re-implement some functions in
QgsGeometry (which would need to change the function's definitions
only), you could suggest this to the qgis developpers and it might be
included in qgis-2.0 . You can do this by issuing a "pull request"
(see github), and perhaps a documented entry in the issue tracker
amd/or discussions here.

You can always use the qgis api to make a custom application (and link
against qgis).

But in your case you might have to make a custom qgis (with
QgsGeometry virtual functions), so it might be easier to integrate
everything in the qgis sources and modify the CMakeLists  (as you
suggest) - this is probably the simplest initial approach.

Other options is to modify qgis to your needs, and then use the
modified qgis libs in your project.

Unless I am mistaken "save as default" is only aplied for the current
layer, not application-wide. ?Although perhaps it applies the default
style for the project only?

I'd be interested in helping out improving the "default styles"
management in qgis - for example having transparent instead of opaque
polygons by default (i.e. Fill Style = "No brush").

The style manager could be enhanced to include app-wide and
project-wide defaults for various layer types - rasters, polygons,
points, lines, etc... With a "restore default" option like Agustin
suggests.

I remember that this issue was raised by OsX users, and that was fixed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS and sextante
Message-ID: <4FCCCA17.9080508@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Now working on sextante interface to grass. One problem I'm finding is:
- GRASS raster can have labels (very convenient, e.g. r.param.scale saves feature
names along with categories)
- when saving to TIFF, these are stripped
- as a consequence, the flow DTM>Features raster>Feature vector strips the
categories, and data are lost.
Any way of keeping them? Of course we can Use raster values as categories, but
keeping the labels would be much better. One way would be to pipe directly the two
GRASS commands, without exporting in between, but this is not implemented yet.
All the best.

labels could be added as GTIFF metadata, which GDAL supports but I
don't know how/if this could be done in GRASS

If the export is using r.out.gdal there must be a way to put/get
metadata in a gtiff?

from r.out.gdal:

metaopt=string[,string,...]
Metadata key(s) and value(s) to include
In the form of "META-TAG=VALUE", separate multiple entries with a
comma. Not supported by all output format drivers.

it does not happen on 1.7.4 (at least on windows) so should be a

Hi all

Would it be possible to include the native QGIS algorithms to sextante 
via Python bindings of the analysis lib (adding sip files where they are 
missing)?

>A solution
>would be to port the core SEXTANTE interfaces to c++ and add Python
>wrappers to PyQGIS

This is a good idea. That way (c++), other plugins could use the core 
sextante functions, e.g. to automatically define process chains.

Regards,
Marco

+1

The Sextante processing pipe could be even plugged into core raster
drawing procedure.

An alternative would be to make use of the GDAL raster attribute table
in both GRASS and QGIS, with the benefit that reading labels for other
raster maps imported with GDAL would also be supported.

IIUC, QGIS is currently using GDALGetRasterCategoryNames() which has
very limited functionality and supports only integer maps. In a GDAL
raster attribute table, as with GRASS-internal categories, floating
point values and data ranges are supported, e.g.

min=358.5, max=359.5, name=359 degrees ccw from east

A GDAL raster attribute table would also solve the problem of
importing/exporting color rules for floating point data types.

Here the steps:

* Open the shapefile http://hub.qgis.org/attachments/4524/poli_estradas_shp.zip
* Turn `Avoid intersections` on
* Digitize a polygon that spans both sizes of a road (polygon)
* The digitized shape is not show, but a record is added to the dbf
* Click save
* Crash

However, the crash disappears when plugins are turned off, so it must be a plugin
error, not a QGIS one.
Sorry for the noise.

may well be:
* digitizing across a polygon generates a multigeom
* the shape does not get written, the non-geom record yes
* then we fall in case #5584.
Thanks.

This is what it looks like on Mac 10.6.8 [0]. A little cramped with no
means of making it bigger, since dialog's maximum size is set. Useable
as is, though.

Funny thing, it looks OK in Designer, but not when previewed or in QGIS.

Thanks Larry, quite similar to mine (with Gnome3).

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR9HP10Oa5YTPKEM+wZQeZG0xy+XMRF1s32N-1HCfTfhCQ@mail.gmail.com>

While attempting to fix issues with menu ordering, I noticed the new
version of fTools in master branch has same version as the one that
users may have installed recently: 0.6.1.

The version for fTools in master branch should be incremented, so that
the 'older plugin is masking new plugin' dialog can be shown to users
who install QGIS 1.8.

The new 0.6.1 plugin checks hasattr(self.iface,
"addPluginToVectorMenu") but the old 0.6.1 does not, and just adds the
menu. If there are other vector plugins using the new Vector category,
two Vector menus may be shown.

Hi Larry,

this is because some time ago, when QGIS has version around 0.11,
fTools was not core plugin, but 3rd part one. Later, it was accepted to
core, but also remain available in Carson's repo. Now all development
on fTools is done in master.

AFAIK, fTools bundled with QGIS has correct version, but in repository
we have an old version which have same number (0.6.1). I ask Carson
several times about fTools version from his repo but unfortunately get
no response.

Hi Alex et al.,

The version of fTools that is in my repository has not been updated in
some time. In fact, it is likely that the core version should have its
version number updated, as it is much more up-to-date than the one in
my repo. Unfortunately, I am unable to work on fTools these days, so
would hope that one of the devs could updated the core fTools plugin
version number to 0.6.2, or perhaps even just keep the version number
up-to-date with the current QGIS version number.
In short: Forget the version in my repo, it is only there for
posterity sake, the only relevant version is the one in core, and its
version number should likely reflect this.

@Alex: Apologies if I have ignored your past emails, this past year
has been a hectic one for me, and I haven't been keeping up with QGIS
business much :-(

I'm aware of this, but thank you for the clear explanation.

The version should still be updated in master, though, right? The same
problem exists for GdalTools, as well.

Incrementing the version number, at least for 1.8 release, would help
notify users who still have same (but outdated) versions of those
plugins installed in their user's plugin directory (like I did).

Larry

Ok, I just set fTools version to 0.6.2 in QGIS master.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS Server] print layout
Message-ID: <4FD0B33F.5020400@jena.de>

Dear all,

I noticed that QGIS Server's GetPrint request delivers a print in which 
none of my text elements are included, the scale bar is moved from the 
bottom to the top, the north arrow is swallowed, in other words: the 
printed map differs from the layout I defined.
anyone confirms?

QGIS 1.8.0 on OpenSUSE 64 bit

Yes,
I posted a message a few days ago reporting similar problems in the web
client, but still no feedback.

I am also using the WebClient but if I issue the GetPrint request 
directly in Firefox the same pdf is returned so it is a server question.

Hi all.
AFAIK, there is not yet a page for the HF:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Developer_Meetings
It is still very early, but I think it would be good to start, so we'll have more
time for fund requests and so on.
Could the local organizers start it?
Thanks.

Does it make sense for the core plugins to have own version numbers at all?
Couldn't they just have the same version as qgis?  IMHO that would be better...

And given that they currently have something below 1.8, that would even work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin SRTM import produces points with no data.
	Anyone Confirms ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6D6tzEBfCuqm4iwDia-TsmFdNjGP5E_qLSGVWLX1toWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I just tried the SRTMImport plugin.
Using it on a project in WGS84, centered in Montpellier, with on-the-fly
reprojection on, I managed to get a "grid" of vector points in my extent,
but the layer produced has no column. I excpected to have at least on
column for "elevation".

Anyone confirms ?

By the way, it could be good to create a raster layer instead of a vector
layer, or provide an option to choose the format.

Michael

 Hi,

 I discovered a few more bugs, most of them should be blockers or high 
 priority in my opinion:

 * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5766: Print Composer: Command history 
 panel of print composer cannot be displayed when invisible  - should be 
 a blocker in my opinion
 * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5767: Print composer: No history entry 
 when moving elements with the keyboard cursors - does not need to be a 
 blocker but should by high priority to fix
 * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5768: Print composer: No history entry 
 when moving elements with the keyboard cursors
 * http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5769: Test filter in old query builder 
 incorrect - should be a blocker in my opinion as I think that this 
 feature is used a lot and it is really embarrasing if this wrong.

 I let you decide which of them are real blockers, but most of them are 
 at least a bit embarassing if we release it like that.

 Thank you for having a look at them,

 Andreas

These SRTM hgt files can be opened as rasters directly. No need for
SRTMImport plugin.

http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/

Or is there something special about that plugin?

Best wishes,

Hi Anita,

Thanks for your quick reply.
I used to use the raw SRTM files you pointed out, but since I saw this
plugin, I was curious and tried it.
I think the author's aim was to make it easy to get the data corresponding
to your project extent for you : no need to go to some webpage, choose the
right file, etc.
I guess before Qgis raster OTF reprojection, it maked also sense to let the
plugin reproject the data in your project SRS.

This is why I was a bit surprised discovering it converted srtm into vector.

Michael

Curved labels seem to ignore "Line orientation dependent position".
Parallel seems to work fine.

Do you confirm?

Message-ID: <CAC8_qebCsbScJBJhK7TqS2u32hzUjuvpYm0AhnXq_VLrw5J7gQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi list

would like to know, why such an awful performance while opening a shpefile
(with just 800 polygon features)

in v1.7.4, the file opens just like that.

in v1.8.0, it takes few seconds to render the file, this is bad because if
I have 20 layers enabled, then ever time I move a it takes longer time to
render the files.


i'm using Windows 7 Pro x64 with 8Gb RAM.
latest v1.8.0 - QGIS code revision d77ce93 (26 may)

installed using osgeo4w installer.


thanks

Ted

Commit f01c6ad8 only fixes the issue as far as QGIS src code is concerned. It doesn't
keep plugins, that are added by user, from hijacking the About or Preferences... menu

Hi Ted!

QGIS 1.8.0 is still not officially released, but thanks for taking the
time and testing it ..
It would help a lot if you could provide the "slow" shape file to
developers and testers to confirm the issue you have and probably
solve them BEFORE the official 1.8 release ..

Regarding the Postgresql Provider .. Well I think there will also be
some changes in 1.8.0 so just be patient ..
And remember .. solving problems without knowing the problem (at my
computer everything is fast - even with a 3000 polygon shapefile) is
hard ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi Werner

since the earlier post with zip file is blocked, let me put it in youtube
for reference.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olLjxPjLNyM

this show the sluggishness.

if required, let me know whom to send the file to;

Yes, want the issue (if there is) to be fixed before the release. I'm just
a tester.


Thanks

Ted

Hi Ted!

Tested your files with 3 persons on 5 different computers .. no
performance problem so far ..
Maybe you should just wait for 1.8 final ..
As far as I can see the problem is not a QGIS one .. probably it's on
your side? (computer?)

Sorry to not confirm your problems here ..

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS choosing invalid primary key column
Message-ID: <4FD5BC41.9030900@gmail.com>

Hi friends,
I have found that QGIS is not choosing proper 'gid serial' primary key
column when integer column with unique constraint exists in table.

Example:
I have following table called 'vranov.v_budovy':
  - gid serial PRIMARY KEY,
  - id_cis_supisne_cisla integer REFERENCES
gisdata.t_cis_supisne_cisla(id) ON DELETE SET NULL UNIQUE,
  - the_geom geometry

I have the same tables in other database schemas with the same problem.


1. After loading this table, QGIS will incorrectly choose
'id_cis_supisne_cisla' column instead of proper PostGIS primary key 'gid'.

2. After removing unique constraint, 'gid' column will be correctly chosen.

Qgis debug log is attached.

Qgis 1.7, Debian Squeeze Linux. Can anybody confirm ?

That's removed in 1.8.  You have to choose the column there.  Having a unique
constraint on a column that is contained in view, doesn't mean it's unique in
the view anyway.

J?rgen, thanks for quick response. I am not sure if I understand
correctly - you mean that some kind of automatic detection of primary
key is removed in 1.8 ?


The problem is that I am not able to reproduce this problem for all
tables that contains unique on integer column. Does it makes a sense for
You ?

Do I have any chance to force 1.7 to choose correct column in this case?

Hi Giovanni

I think this is a precision problem (client side). At 1:50:000, the 
GetPrint request looks like that:

http://mapserver.uevora.pt/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/var/www/qgis-web-client/projects/helloworld.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3&REQUEST=GetPrint&FORMAT=pdf&EXCEPTIONS=application/vnd.ogc.se_inimage&TRANSPARENT=true&SRS=EPSG:4326&DPI=300&TEMPLATE=Composer%201&map0:extent=3.3,8,3.4,8&map0:rotation=0&map0:scale=50000&map0:grid_interval_x=2000&map0:grid_interval_y=2000&LAYERS=Country%2CHello

So the critical thing is map0:extent=3.3,8,3.4,8 which means the height 
of the map is 0.

Regards,
Marco

I am thinking about 1.7 fix to update column query
(QgsPostgresProvider::getPrimaryKey) to return primary key column first
by adding ordering by 'indisprimary' column:

select indkey from pg_index where indisunique and
indrelid=regclass('"vranov"."v_budovy"')::oid and indpred is null order
by indisprimary desc


Can this work ?

thanks for the answer,

it is not clear to me, is then a client issue or a local configuration

Hi Giovanni

It's something for the qgis-web-client bug tracker. The client needs to use more precise floats for the GetPrint request.

OK than we will stop accepting blockers for 1.8 and get on with it.

 I agree - this has to be fixed in the client. We should add a global 
 option for that.

 The original version was only done for meters, so we did not use more 
 than one digit after the comma for specifying the print extent.

 Can you please open a ticket in the qgis-web-client section?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

I think we should keep on accepting them: if it is possible we can always (working in
master) issue a last minute fix, or schedule a bugfix release for later).
All the best.

It seems that it fixed the problem. Patch attached for reference.
Is there any chance of releasing 1.7.5 ? Should I create pull request ?

Hi all,

I'd prefer to wait few days (e.g. 3 days) before releasing 1.8
to be sure the latest fixes haven't generated new issues.

After the 1.7.x series with a lot of problems just after the releases,
we should release a stable version of QGis.

Regards

"make check" is for GNU afficionados [1].
"make test" is for those who like to be different.

make test is provided my cmake
make check was added to keep Sandro 100% topologically happy :-)
make Experimental is if you want to share your test and keep me 100%
dashingly happy

Message-ID: <CALCNqka8Pj7KGLixJVDwGkOc_eWYa7TpuOQ1zWyKSkX+23AxkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and
release team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about
the release have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our
press material etc.

--- End note ---

I have branched QGIS 1.8.0 for release. The branch can be checked out
like this (as a tracking branch)

git clone git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git
git branch --track release-1_8 origin/release-1_8
git checkout release-1_8

Or (to check out the tag made immediately before branching)

git fetch
git checkout final-1_8_0


Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.8.0.tar.bz2
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.8.0.tar.bz2.md5

Some notes:

- Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks - we will be focussing our efforts on master towards an
upcoming 2.0 release. There are no 1.8.x point releases planned except
in the case of highly critical bugfixes being needed.
- If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download
wiki page at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of
your package.
- If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please discuss your plans on this thread so that we can avoid
duplication of effort.
- I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will
be great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.
- git master is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any
major code changes.
- Please accompany any updates to core with unit tests!

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality!

Lastly can I call on the release team (or any interested people) to
help to put together visual changelog (link below), press
announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will send you an
email when the packages are ready and you can start broadcasting
announcements.

Visual Changelog Wiki Page:

it is a known issue. There are rasters when you try to set transparent
the "nulls" qgis instead make transparent the pixels with 0 value.

I guess we would need to wait for the raster resampling commits (a new
feature for the next qgis release) and start from there to fix what need
to be fixed.

thank you for your reply.
i think that a such bug, problem, strange beahaviour (call it as you want),
is very limitating. 
maybe at the same level as a blocker bug, IMO

Got in same shoes today.
As far as I can see the problem arises when compiling against
libspatialite2: looks like you need libspatialite 3.
Remove libspatialite 2 (most likely with your package manager) and
then compile from source libspatialite 3 (at least in Mint 12 I don't
see packages for spatialite 3) and will work.

Thanks Etienne for the explanation!

We will proceed as we did and consider later how we may deal with virtual functions for QgsGeometry.

Kind regards, Nico

PS-- I will have another question (in another post) in regard to building of the source code as I keep having issues under Windows with Visual Studio 10.

there are a number of known issues about rasters, none of them was a
regression and so it was not possible to tag them as blockers. Recently
things got better after a few changes introduced by Alexander. In the
next dev release there will be the merging the resampling code (by
Marco) and a few more fixes by Radim, and so we will need to re-evaluate
the situation.

cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Raster resampler branch merged
Message-ID: <4FD9A83F.6090907@sourcepole.ch>

Hi all

The raster_resampler branch is now merged. The following things are new:

- For users: resampling functionality, changed GUI in the raster 
properties tab

- For developers: There is a new class QgsRasterRenderer which decides 
how a raster is drawn. Each renderer has its own dialog to enter the 
settings and it is possible to define new renderer classes in the core 
or in plugins (they need to register in QgsRasterRendererRegistry).

Note that the raster resampler branch changes the project file format. 
1.7 project files are automatically transformed into the new format by 
the function QgsProjectFileTransform::transform1700to1800. This means 
that project files from 1.8 are not automatically transformed. My 
suggestion is to define the current version as 1.8.1, then I may change 
the transform logic to also include 1.8 project files. Any objections?

There are a number of existing bug tracker tickets about raster 
symbology. Please check if they are still true with the current version 
and assign them to me. And of course I also expect new issues popping 
up, so fill new tickets for them.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Modifications to dissolve() in fTools
Message-ID: <4FDA618C.30305@gmail.com>

Hello,

Recently for a project I've needed to work with the fTools plugin. One 
of the thing I had to
do was to load a great number of points (over 1M) and bufferize them, 
then dissolve the
layer.

I've made several changes to dissolve, but since I'm new on this list 
and I don't know how
things work here I'm only submitting the first one:

Currently, when dissolving based on a field, fTools first makes the list 
of different values,
then for each value goes through the entire features, and for those 
matching the field value
combines them. If there is a large number of different values (for 
example 1000 different values)
it means that fTools will have to go through the whole layer 1000 times. 
(rewinding the provider
every time, etc.). For large layers it is too slow.

What I do instead is keep a dictionary of features, one feature per 
field value. For each feature
of the layer, I check if the field value is already associated to an 
open feature, and if so,
I combine the features (otherwise I create the feature and add it to the 
dictionnary). That way, I go through the layer only once.

Here is the patch (in the case when the "selection only" box is unchecked):

patch: http://osgeo.codepad.org/VNoUiMUu

I also have a .shp test file (58 MB) that I can upload, to compare the 
difference in speed (at least
a factor 10).

I hope I went through proper channels and didn't make a blunder with the 
code (it works fine here)

Dear Eliott,
thanks for this. Your work arrive at an unfortunate time, as it is probably too late
to include it in the upcoming QGIS 1.8, whereas it would have been nice to have your
fix in it.
Could you please issue a pull request, so your patch can be easily included in master?
Thanks.

Hi all.
As you know, we are releasing QGIS 1.8, where the only plugin repo available by
default is http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
May I ask all plugin developers to migrate their plugins there?
In the occasion, please check that you plugin has a bugtracker and a code repo listed
in its page; e.g. http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/AutoPlot/ does not have it, and an
user cannot open a ticket about it.
If you need help, do not hesitate asking on this list.

Just for reference, there are about 68 plugin that should possibly be migrated; some
of them are of important and general use.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unit tests failing - a heartfelt plea
Message-ID: <CALCNqkbF5EL3rMBjkgykWekuHQUReAk7yaO7c6Z1G0ErrAeOGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I just want to make a heartfelt plea that any new code pushed to Git
master should not break tests (at minimum on the platform on which you
are working). If you do radical changes, the test suite should be
updated to accommodate them so that the tests still pass for your
platform when you commit. I would like to see the test suite grow to
encompass  as much functionality of QGIS as possible, but it will be
very difficult to maintain them if we commit code that breaks them.
You can always view the state of the last nightly builds here:

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

You can test your work before pusing it to master by doing:

make test
make check

or (to share your test results)

make Experimental

Thanks!

Regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem building qgis_core under windows 7
Message-ID: <033B262233FE9A4EA813A4F43F963515113FA036@SRV362.tudelft.net>

Dear Developers,

Another questions concerning the Quantum-GIS source. I briefly described the project that Martijn and I are on in regard to combining QGIS with 3D geometry (/CAD) functionality.

I have compiled many softwares under linux, although for QGIS I almost always simply use the binaries and never build under windows.
Yet, since our customized QGIS is a geological field acquisition tool that runs on a Windows Tablet PC, I need to compile under windows.

First I tried to simply build from the latest github src tree (as of last week) and carefully followed the instructions as provided by http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc14

Tim Sutton already kindly pointed me to fact that QGIS should be built with Visual Studio (Express) v9 2008 and not with version 10, 2010 what I was using before.
As result, I no longer have the when building the qgis_core: "The system cannot find the batch label specified - VCReportError".

Instead,  I get the another error when building qgis_core that says: " ... Generating qgsexpressionparser.cpp ... The system cannot find the path specified.". I attached the corresponding BuildLog.htm file. Any idea what causes this new problem with building qgis_core?

I use a Windows 7 machine with Visual Studio 2008 (v9) and cmake(-gui) 2.8.8. Initially, I had various issues with the configure and generate in cmake-gui but, I think, I managed to resolve all of them. Except of one problem of which I am not sure if that may cause my issue with building QGIS to do with Windows SDK and the SetupAPI.Lib which I find on my system at C:/Progra~2/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v6.0A/Lib/SetupAPI.Lib which I linked in cmake-gui configure.

Should I have and link /v7/Lib/SetupAPI.Lib instead during the cmake configure? The QGIS instructions say that "You also need the Microsoft Windows Server(r) 2003 R2 Platform SDK (for setupapi)". On my Windows 7 machine I instead downloaded the corresponding Windows SDK from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/conf
The installation of  Windows SDK components through winsdk_web.exe gave the error problem as shown in WindowsSDK_installationError.txt

Could a v6.0A/Lib/SetupAPI.Lib be causing the problem with building qgis_core? Would an SDK for Windows 7 install a /v7/Lib/SetupAPI.Lib instead? How can I get a Windows 7 SetupAPI.Lib & Windows SDK installed on my system? All windows SDK installations give me the same error. A google search on Windows 7 SDK installation problem shows many reports and some suggestions. I tried several but none seem help. Anyone encountered this problem as well?


Any suggestions to resolve the issue with building qgis_core under Windows 7 are warmly welcomed!

Many thanks, Nico

Not sure that you need to use 2008 instead of 2010.   It's just that we
normally use 2008 and know OSGeo4W has the dependencies in place for that (ie.
Qt and a PyQt that goes with it).

2010 is probably fine too, if you take care of the dependencies yourself.

Sounds like your bison or flex setup doesn't work.

Recently, fTools (in master) had its version incremented up to 0.6.2,
to make sure it was higher than a version users might have installed
in their user-plugins directory. That helps users clean out their
versions of a user plugin that might be masking one in core, since
user plugins take precedence over a core one of the same package name.

The opposite makes for a good incremental update process between QGIS
releases. If fTools is put in the plugins.qgis.org repository, with
Eliott's tested changes, and incremented to version 0.6.3, users would
be notified of the update and can install the new version in their
user plugins directory.

This means that the plugin/version in master needs to be the same as
what's in the repository. Then, just before next release of QGIS, the
core plugin's version is bumped up again, and fTools at
plugins.qgis.org is removed or hidden from queries.

So, there is a means to get Elliot's work out to users, after 1.8
launch, after it has been tested. I suggest this type of update
process be standardized and/or written about somewhere in the
developer docs. It would aid developers who help maintain a core
plugin to push out fixes in between QGIS releases.

Another solution might be to have a small, separate plugin repository
that is transparently checked by Plugin Installer for incremental
updates to core plugins, instead of having core plugins repeatedly
listed and removed from plugins.qgis.org.

I'm +1 for this idea.  It would be good to be able to update core
plugins of QGIS via the plugin installer, then at each release force
update everyone by removing the one in the installer at release time.

I'm not sure I like this.  Either it's a core plugin or it's not.  IMHO core
plugins aren't supposed to be in the plugin repositories - and therefore don't
need an own version number.

Hi all,

Offering a choice to install a more recent "core" plugin is a good
thing I think - although perhaps interim updates should be in another
repository or marked as "experimental", until they are released in the
stable version of qgis.

I wanted to bisect the first wrong commit after 1.8 but I found that
final-1_8_0 also fails in qgis_rasterlayertest and qgis_rendererstest.
Is it possible? Release was made with broken tests? Is it my local
problem? Are the tests independent of user settings?

OTOH, the results for final-1_8_0 of qgis_rasterlayertest are much
better than latest master.

That's because of the raster_resampler merge. Something to look at for me.
No idea why they fail before (probably it depends on the GDAL you are 
using).

For me, there is also

11/20 Test #11: qgis_geometrytest ....................***Failed    0.44 sec

and the application hangs with qgis_ziplayertest :

Start 17: qgis_ziplayertest
*** glibc detected *** 
/home/marco/src/Quantum-GIS/build/output/bin/qgis_ziplayertest:

Marco

They were most probably not failing before 1.8 was released, see:

The autobuilds use a variety of gdal version (1-6 -> 1.9.1) so I think
most possibilities are covered - so it's probably a local problem.

This is after raster_resampler merge right? Which gdal version and OS
are you using?

Please send me a debug log of that test.

J?rgen, how else can update-able core functionality of QGIS be updated
between major releases?

If I had a plugin that might be considered a candidate for being a
core plugin (which I might, after a lot of work and testing), and, I
could not be responsive to its user-base by providing timely fixes and
updates between major QGIS releases, I would not view moving my plugin
from contributed to core as a good idea.

Hmm, I assumed more flexible and timely updates was one of the points
behind the idea to move parts of QGIS from C++ to Python, with its
core, stable code base remaining in C++. Then more developers could
help out with development and, like PyQGIS plugins, those modular
Python components could be updated via a web-updater between releases,
since Python code is byte-compiled on the user's machine.

Was I incorrect in this assumption?

It is now a common, maybe even expected, user experience to often
web-update part or all of a program, beyond components such as
contributed plugins. (I updated my git program, SourceTree, 3 times in
the last week, because they needed to adapt to the new github.com API
v.3.)

Sorry, a bit off topic.

Larry

Can you run make Experimental and then share the link to your uploaded
test for 1.8.0? Probably you have small rendering anomalies which
cause the tests to fail - we can add the test results to the anomalies
list if this is the case.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dissolve in a grid? (fTools)
Message-ID: <4FDBA189.7020800@gmail.com>

Hey,

This is the other change I made to the fTools plugin. When dealing with 
lots of shapes to dissolve (especially from a buffer), I have found it 
to be very slow to dissolve it all. It's much faster to dissolve using a 
grid: specify a width for the grid spacing, and shapes in the same part 
of the grid are dissolved together.

Then you can apply manually another dissolve to the whole result layer, 
or choose a wider grid. Overall for high-density buffers the gain in 
speed is enormous. (over a week -> 1h30 in a test case)

I added it to the fTools plugin for my own purposes (added a line with a 
checkbox and a grid spacing in the ui), but should I make a pull request 
to have it included in the standard fTools - since my need may not be 
universal?

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to best contribute small modifications?
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP41366DBCE19B212C60942F95FA0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

I use QGIS almost everyday in my job and I love it. However, I think 
there are a lot of little things to fix to have a more coherent and 
intuitive interface and I encounter a lot of frustrating small issues in 
my normal use. I already filed a few bug reports with a small patch to 
correct the issues I saw:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4453 (8 months ago)

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5641 (21 days ago)

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5718 (13 days ago)

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5726 (13 days ago)

However, these bug reports and patches did not elicit any answer, not 
even rejection or criticism. What is the reason ? I tried to explain the 
issue clearly and to provide a clean patch, but I may have botched 
something. Did they simply go through the cracks ? Did I do something 
wrong ? Should I provide more information ? Should I contribute in 
another way (pull request from git ? they seemed too small for that)

I still have other bugs and small features that I would like to work on 
(symbology is especially frustrating to work with), but I do not want to 
waste too much time if the contribution is never used. In my opinion, 
this kind of polishing is what QGIS lacks the most at the moment so I 
would really like to find a way to contribute back!

Regards,

Leyan

Hi Leyan,

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the project, sorry you haven't
received any feedback on your work.  It's not that people are ignoring
you it's normally just a matter of the patches getting lost in the
wave of things going on, or as you put it slipped though the cracks.
Sometimes it's just that all the developers are busy and have no time.
 I see there is a patch waiting for me to approve so I will take a
look at it over the next couple of days.

Small patches attached to the ticket are fine, anything that is large
I would recommend creating a pull request.

Provide as much information as you can in the ticket, things like,
screenshots, sample data, steps to reproduce, etc, all help us
evaluate the patch to make sure it is correct.

Regards,
Nathan

Here it is http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/viewTest.php?buildid=87438
it looks interesting. In the first raster test called 'raster', some
columns are wider, some others are narrower. In following raster
tests, the problem may be the same (columns and rows somehow shifted).

There is a lot of other fails but those seems to be false alarms,
tests pass ok, but then it crashes, probably.

Agreed, polishing is much needed. Please accept also my apologies.
I think the problem is rather general: could he have a patch/pull requests manager,
ensuring nothing will be forgotten from now on?
Of course it is the original author of that section who should ultimately deal with
the patch, but a manager could help us remembering.
Opinions?
All the best.

I'm wondering if we can set up redmine to auto email the dev list each
fortnight/month with a list of tickets that have patches that are not
closed.

Hi Leyan

Your procedure of contributing the modifications is correct. I'm sorry 
about the delay in answering the tickets. In the last few weeks, the dev 
effort was focused on fixing the blockers for the 1.8 release, therefore 
the other tickets did not get much attention.
An important thing is also to set the flag 'patch provided' to yes. If a 
ticket with a patch does not get attention within a week, send a 
friendly reminder to the qgis-developer list (like you did just now).

Regards,
Marco

More observations:
* test raster tenbytenraster.asc size is 10x10
* output device is set to expected_raster.png size 100 x 100
* QgsMapRenderer::render is using
     rasterScaleFactor = ( thePaintDevice->logicalDpiX() +
thePaintDevice->logicalDpiY() ) / 2.0 / sceneDpi;
   in this case:
     thePaintDevice->logicalDpiX() = 85 thePaintDevice->logicalDpiY() = 86
     sceneDpi = 96 rasterScaleFactor = 0.890625
* because of rasterScaleFactor, the raster is rendered as 90x90
instead of 100x100, doing such resampling, it may probably happen that
certain output column falls to a different data source column
depending on architecture - it is not clear to me however, how it
would be possible, it should be all IEEE 754, there is also IEEE
754-2008, but I have no idea if it can make difference or if it is
even implemented in new CPUs. Anyway, we should not usually reach such
problems.

Anybody has idea why rasterScaleFactor is used and how it should work?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GML axis order handling using OGR Vector Driver
Message-ID: <4FDC7F5E.6040103@Weichand.de>

Hello everyone,

The axis order in WFS 1.1 and WFS 2.0 is based on the input of the 
EPSG-Registry (http://www.epsg-registry.org). Please note that there may 
be different axis orders used by the reference systems.

Examples:
urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4258 (ETRS 89) ? Latitude, Longitude
http://geoserv.weichand.de:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeName=bvv:gmd_ex&count=1&srsName=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4258

urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:25832 (UTM 32 North) ? Easting, Northing
http://geoserv.weichand.de:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeName=bvv:gmd_ex&count=1&srsName=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:25832

urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:31468 (Gau? Kr?ger 4) ? Northing, Easting
http://geoserv.weichand.de:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeName=bvv:gmd_ex&count=1&srsName=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:31468

The OGR driver in QGIS is not able to detect the axis order, so the data 
will be handled wrong, if the axis order is Northing, Easting (or 
Latitude, Longitude). Is there a way to force the OGR driver to switch 
the axis order?

QgsVectorLayer(filename, title, "ogr") ?

The same problem exits if you loading GML files using ?Add Vector 
Layer?. There should be a switch to set the axis order.



The QGIS WFS 2.0 Plugin (0.7) is currently using the following 
(unofficial?) convention:

Using the deprecated srsName-Style ?EPSG:4326? instead of 
?urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4326? will force the WFS Server to use Easting, 
Northing (Longitude, Latitude) axis order.

http://geoserv.weichand.de:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeName=bvv:gmd_ex&count=1&srsName=EPSG:4258
vs.
http://geoserv.weichand.de:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&request=GetFeature&version=2.0.0&typeName=bvv:gmd_ex&count=1&srsName=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4258

This convention is supported by GeoServer and deegree, but could fail 
with other server.
http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wfs/basics.html#axis-ordering

Is there a better solution?

Best regards
Juergen Weichand

happy sunday to all!

i just made the update of qgis dev version from 1.8.x to 1.9.
the setup went ok, but i can't find qgis-dev.bat in bin directory and there
isn't proper icon in desktop.
where is it? :-)

Hi Radim

>      sceneDpi = 96 rasterScaleFactor = 0.890625

Looks like the problem is that, in QgsRenderChecker::runTest, myImage may have different DPI depending on the system (in your case, myImage seems to have 85/86 and myExpectedImage 96). Could you test if it works if you set the DPI of myImage programmatically to 96:

QImage myImage( myExpectedImage.width(),
                   myExpectedImage.height(),
                   QImage::Format_RGB32 );
myImage.setDotsPerMeterX( 96.0 / 25.4 * 1000.0 );
myImage.setDotsPerMeterY( 96.0 / 25.4 * 1000.0 );
...


Like that, rasterScaleFactor
  should be 1.0 on all systems.

>Anybody has idea why rasterScaleFactor is used and how it should work?

rasterScaleFactor is there because in the print composer, units are mm and so in this case, the raster images have more pixels than output units.
But for drawing to QImage, rasterScaleFactor is always 1.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions about symbology: ellipse marker,
 symbol layer properties, default increment
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP2972FCE0097C2469E31699A95F90@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

Now that I am confident that bug reports and patches are considered 
(good response time on the mailing-list by the way !) I started to look 
a bit more in the code.

I am currently mostly interested in the symbology code as it is central 
to my use of QGis and still has a lot of room for improvement in my 
opinion.

I have mainly three questions:
* Why is the ellipse marker separated from the simple marker?
* What is the logic behind the two level of properties? (global 
properties for the symbol and then for each symbol layer)
* Can we change the default values for increment?

Why is the ellipse marker separated from the simple marker ? Isn't it 
possible to just replace size by sizeX, sizeY (or keep size and add a 
ratio if it is judged more intuitive ?) and merge ellipse marker ? Right 
now, the situation is that both have advantages and drawbacks. Ellipse 
markers allow to control the outline width (but a 0 width does not 
work), to use data-defined color, but they do not obey the global color 
choice (before going into the symbol properties dialog. This means for 
example that they cannot be used for graduated symbology. They also have 
less shapes available and cannot be offset like simple symbols.

Is it a temporary situation and both will develop in different 
directions later ? Should we merge them ?

Second, what is the logic behind the symbol layers ? I like the concept 
as it allows to construct complex symbols easily, but right now the 
whole thing is a bit shaky: if I make a symbol with two layers using 
some offset and rotations (real-world use case : a valve symbol by using 
two triangles touching by one corner), the resulting symbol shape is 
affected when I manipulate the angle or the size:
* changing the main rotation will reset all the layers rotation (that 
was the object of my first patch http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4453)
* changing the size will scale all layers accordingly and respect their 
relative size, but the offset will not be modified so elements that were 
just touching each others will start overlapping.

Third, is it possible to change the values for increment of line width 
and border width? I know that when I want to increase a line width from 
the default 0.26, I very rarely want 1.26, 2.26, 3.26 ... I would love 
to have 0.26, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, etc.

Sorry for the long blurb ! Should I ask someone in particular if I have 
subsequent questions ?

Regards,

Leyan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GGL2 - QGIS integration
Message-ID: <CAJVPfbXrJpNqQ+L8RXYxRXCv3zm+dY7UwSfqaGUvkDCgB0UKtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Although I've already taken part in the list once, I want to briefly
introduce myself. I'm freelance developer, I started with GIS
development in the beginnings of gvSIG. I work mainly with Java and
I'm just a basic QGIS user... until now. My brother V?ctor (Gonz?lez)
and I are engaged in a new development that may be of interest for the
QGIS community.

One of the aims of this development is the integration of GGL2[1] in
QGIS. GGL2 is a geoprocessing specific language, which means that it
provides language constructions so that the user can specify and
combine geoprocessing operations easily. In other words: kind of SQL
but more GIS specific. As a small example, we have WKT literals in
GGL2:

a = POINT(10 10);

Another example: saving the previous point as a shapefile would be
something like this:

import ggl.shp;
a = POINT(10 10);
shape = [{the_geom=a}];
write SHP shape to '/tmp/result.shp';

There is raster support (limited so far) and more features. For more
examples, there is a "getting started" section[2] in the
documentation[3].

The integration with QGIS will make it possible to:
  (a) reference the layers in QGIS as if they were variables in the
GGL2 script and
  (b) show results with spatial component directly in QGIS. Thus, a
script to create a buffer on a QGIS layer and showing it in QGIS would
be something like:

import ggl.shp;
import ggl.geom;
buff = qgis_layer select(st_buffer(qgis_layer/the_geom)); // reference
to qgis layer
show buff in gis as SHP 'result'; // showing the result back in qgis

In the future I'd like to integrate it with SEXTANTE so that scripts
written in GGL2 can be reused through the SEXTANTE user interface.
This is out of budget though :( but I talked with V?ctor (Olaya) and
it doesn't seem like a big task once the development is finished.

I hope it's interesting for some of you and, of course, any comments
of such an active and skilful community are very welcome. Mainly
because it's our very first development in python!

Best regards.
Fernando

Hi Fernando,
it looks a very interesting development; thanks for this. Looking forward to test it.
How do you plan to integrate it into QGIS?
All the best.

Hi Paolo.

About the UI, we want to have a console so that the user can type the
script and hit a "play" button.  Similar to the "Consola GGL" panel
towards the end of this video[1]. That's the previous version of the
language, which was based in SQL.

Appart of the UI, a qgis plugin must be created that exchanges
messages with the GGL compiler in order to show results and inform the
compiler about the layers loaded in qgis, etc. This approach already
works in gvSIG. You can see how does it looks like from the user point
of view here[2] and the technical details here[3].

I hope I've answered your question.

AFAICS, GGL will be used as a server to which the Qgis plugin will talk
through kind of an XML-RPC protocol, is it right?

Hi all,

I'm V?ctor (Fernando's brother) and I also wanted to introduce myself. I
have been working with GGL for some time and I did the GGL2-GIS connection
system in the context of a GSoC last year. I have been working with Java
and C but never with Python, so this is a new experience for me.

Regarding your question, that is the idea. But actually the Qgis plugin
will be the server since all the communication is started by the GGL2
environment. This plugin can be seen as a layer server that provides and
"stores" (draws) layers: it opens a socket and manages the requests.

Regards,
V?ctor.

I just want to add that both Victor and Fernando are good friends of
mine and their work is impressive. If GGL2 can be implemented in QGIS
using SEXTANTE, That will be a very valuable addition. I, of course,
will be ready to help as much as needed.

Victor

Hi Victor,
I've just given a rapid look to the GGL2 site and docs. If I understand it
correctly, GGL2 will run in its own process, and the Qgis plugin will be
the intermediary to expose QGis to GGL2 (through socket communication) as a
"GIS provider".
The GGL2 commands will run on GGL2 which will be able to reference the
layers (and the drawing) on QGis through the plugin. Right?

Hi,

Yes, exactly. We plan to implement the same behavior as in gvSIG. You can
see this in some videos.

Referencing GIS layers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHJ3pFHHe6U
Adding new layers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcTTUMGuL5Q

We know that it could also be interesting to use GGL2 from within Qgis,
integrating with Sextante. But as Fernando said, it is out of the budget so
it will have to wait a little more.

V?ctor.

If output image DPI is also set to 96, then it works correctly.

I was curious how Qt gets DPI, it calculates it on X11:
    int widthMM = DisplayWidthMM(X11->display, s);
    screen->dpiX = (DisplayWidth(X11->display, s) * 254 + widthMM * 5)
/ (widthMM * 10);
In my case, if I change display resolution, both DisplayWidth and
DisplayWidthMM are changing, keeping the same DPI, which makes little
sense, I think.

In any case, the test myImage dpi depends on platform. Setting myImage
dpi to myExpectedImage dpi in all raster tests should be sufficient,
right?

> Like that, rasterScaleFactor
> ?should be 1.0 on all systems.

The formula
    rasterScaleFactor = ( thePaintDevice->logicalDpiX() +
              thePaintDevice->logicalDpiY() ) / 2.0 / sceneDpi;
ignores that dpiX and dpiY may be different, could it be a problem?

Thanks for explanation. Can we be sure, that rasterScaleFactor is
always 1.0 when it should be? Is it true, that if output format is
raster, then rasterScaleFactor should be 1.0? It would be maybe better
to test if output device is QImage or QPicture and force
rasterScaleFactor to 1.0, in that case?

Hi Radim

Yes, I think so. QImage is supposed to be independent of the graphics 
system (if the dpi is the same).

>Thanks for explanation. Can we be sure, that rasterScaleFactor is

Right, there is a rounding error detction, but I see the rasterScaleFactor should be set to 1.0 and it is not done (only the scaling of raster layer is avoided):

qgsmaprenderer.cpp:
if ( ml->type() == QgsMapLayer::RasterLayer&&  qAbs( rasterScaleFactor - 1.0 )>  0.000001 )

       {

         scaleRaster = true;

       }


Detecting the paint devince does not work because it is also possible to 
render QGraphicsScene to any paint device (e.g. in composer, the scene 
is rendered to QImage if save to image is clicked).

>The formula

They are averaged, but maybe it would be better to take just X?

Regards,
Marco

Hi V?ctor, thanks for the support.

My idea is to give the sextante integration a try once the basic
integration is done. We'll see :)

What do you mean with "SEXTABTE/QGis" integration? Do you mean launching
GGL2 commands from inside SEXTANTE (directed to the hosted GGL2 engine), or
porting GGL2 to Python?
I see on your repo a basic Python implementation to call GGL2 through
Popen. Do you mean something like that?

Sorry for so many questions, I ask them just to understand, because you're
project is very interesting and I like to think about possible future
applications.
I like very much domain languages. On this topic I also follow JEQL, from
Martin Davis, and OrbisGIS [2] with its GDMS and GRAP tools.

Yes, GGL2 scripts can be packaged and, as sextante is able to use
third party processes, it should be possible to launch them from
sextante.

We already got something with the previous implementation of GGL and
the sextante Java version.

That's the basic integration that will allow launching GGL2 scripts
from QGIS. We plan to create a very simple interactive console at
first, nothing to do with sextante.

Please. :)

There is also jiffle[1] from Michael Bedward. I've copied some
constructions from there. I've talked time ago with both of them
(Michael and Martin) to try to collaborate... but it's not easy.
Although the basic idea is the same, the approaches are very
different.

About OrbisGIS/Gearscape, some facts:

- GDMS started in gvSIG (called GDBMS), in a boring summer, at home,
at my home :)
- We improved it *a lot* during the first 1.5 years of OrbisGIS development.
- I forked it afterwards: Gearscape.
- GGL stands for Gearscape Geoprocessing Language.
- The GIS application (gearscape) and it's scripting language is no
longer supported and we focus on the new language version (GGL2) and
on the integration with other GIS applications (now is QGIS turn!).

I just tested with a vector and a raster and in my case it shows the
usual "handle bad layers" dialog, plus


ERROR 4:
`/media/436dc38a-c791-4a29-92e8-1506d42f2a9d/gio/UBC_filipe/dem_move_clipped.tif' does not exist in the file system,
and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.


or

ERROR 10: Pointer 'hDS' is NULL in 'OGR_DS_Destroy'.


in the terminal, but no crashes whatsoever.


cheers!

Hi Tim

The raster test passes now (at least on my machine).

I still have 2 failures as of a1cb7fdc:

   4 - qgis_regression992 (Failed)
   6 - qgis_rasterlayertest (Failed)
  
Do I need to do anything more than "git pull && make check" ?
I'm asking because the qgsversion.h doesn't seem to get updated...

On a clean build the failures go down to a single one:

     4 - qgis_regression992 (Failed)

I guess it could mean the raster thing was fixed, but:

 1. There's still a failing test
 2. There's a problem with build dependencies

Here (85/86 dpi) it also passes 100% OK.

I think it could be same problem. I also have it on several machines with different Linux distributions.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] gdal provider changes data type in the absence of
	nodata value
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMgXZvJ++F2fWS1R_E=uvM4tfFmEhiPHndWRkSxVeJveg@mail.gmail.com>

A raster that does not contain a nodata value, a default value is
selected that is outside of the range of the raster's data type.

This is fine and a requirement for many operations, explained in
gdaldataprovider.cpp

      // But we need a null value in case of reprojection and BTW also for
      // aligned margines

However, the data type is changed (to include the new nodata value)
which leads to unexpected results.

For example, calling QgsContrastEnhancement::minimumValuePossible() on
a raster with Byte data returns -32768 instead of 0.
You can see the effect of this if you load a 1-band Byte raster and
open the Layer Properties dialog (with no contrast enhancement),
min/max values are -32768/32767 - but they should be 0/255


Would it be possible to change this, perhaps adding a flag
"mNoDataSet" like in the GDAL GTiff driver, and keep the out-of-range
nodata value?

>Only one test failed here - qgis_regression992

Looking at the past dashboard results 
(http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS), there is a shift 
with qgis_regression992 even in the passed tests (with a pixel 
difference just under 300, so considered as 'valid').
It was essentially the dpi problem (image at 72 dpi, system dpi usually 
at 96). I wonder if it is okay to just replace the image with a 
not-shifted one. Opinions?

Regards,
Marco

Thanks for getting the tests to work again! Yes I think it would be
fine to just update the expected image.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Socket server freezes on Python plugin
Message-ID: <CAGVwcX6onqVjG5tuGKFcn+UUXE4a497Jf5sqG4nqfWXwpwK0AQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to create a plugin that opens a socket server in a separate
thread and handles requests. I create the server using
SocketServer.TCPServer and threading.Thread in the initGui method and the
plugin starts correctly, but if I try to get a response from a client, the
server freezes and does not respond.

The strange thing is that I have added a toolbar button that opens and
closes a file and, if I click that button, the server unfreezes and I get
the response as expected. However, if I create the socket server with the
same exact code as an standalone program, it works as expected without
freezing.

I have looked into the PyQgis cookbook [1] and the contributed plugins [2]
searching for an example or solution but I couldn't find anything. Does
anyone know what may be wrong? Any hint will be greatly appreciated. I
attach the Qgis plugin as well as the standalone server and client.

Thanks in advance,
V?ctor.

Hi Victor,

I happen to have done just that recently. I used QTcpServer, not sure if 
it is the best way to do it, but it works with QGIS 1.7.4 and 1.8. I 
think I used the PyQt examples. I hope it is of use.

from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui, QtSql, QtNetwork

class MyPlugin:
     def __init__(self, iface):
         self.startMyServer()
         app = QgsApplication.instance()
         QtCore.QObject.connect(app, QtCore.SIGNAL("aboutToQuit()"),
	self.stopListening)

     def stopListening(self):
         if self.tcpServer:
             self.tcpServer.close()

             if self.tcpSocket:
                 self.tcpSocket.close()

     def startMyServer(self):
         '''create the server'''

         self.tcpServer = QtNetwork.QTcpServer()
         self.tcpSocket = None # initialize

         if not self.tcpServer.listen(port=16500):
             QtGui.QMessageBox.critical(None, "Tcp Server",
                     "Could not start the server: %s." \
	    % self.tcpServer.errorString())
             return None

         QtCore.QObject.connect(self.tcpServer,
	QtCore.SIGNAL("newConnection()"), self.receiveMyData)

     def receiveMyData(self):
         '''slot to be called when a client connects to the server'''
         if self.tcpServer.hasPendingConnections():
             self.tcpSocket = self.tcpServer.nextPendingConnection()
             self.tcpSocket.readyRead.connect(self.readMyData)

     def readMyData(self):
         '''Slot to read the data sent to the server'''
         numbBytes = self.tcpSocket.bytesAvailable()
         data = self.tcpSocket.read(numbBytes)
         self.tcpSocket.close()

	# do something witht the data

I've tried it.
I seems it depends on QGis not giving the plugin thread the option to serve
while IDLE waiting for user interaction.
The plugin server unfreezes even if you simply move the mouse over QGis
(wihtout doing any action on it).
It must be investigated...

This happens only if you move the mouse over the Canvas, while the server
remains freezed while moving on other areas (TOC, toolbar, etc.)

Hi again,

I tried Bernhard's solution and it worked like charm. After digging a
little more into PyQt I found this thread [1] with some answers. Seems like
QtNetworking deals with all this networking and threading issues
internally, so my problem is solved that way.

Regarding Giovanni's comments, I confirm that behavior but I'm not familiar
with multithreading and networking in Python, so I cannot imagine what
could be the difference between using QtNetworking vs. threading/socket and
if that is the expected behavior or not.

Thanks for the help,
V?ctor.

No problems with your basic example with pure python threading. The problem
is the interaction with the Qt event loop. That's why PyQt threading is
there ;)

Message-ID: <CAHXrU-JqY=t+FjyurdjFJBSO7rTViVfCkehpiN09XWaYP4gkxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am using the following WMS-T layer without problems in OpenLayers
using EPSG:900913:

url: http://geohub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/forest/effis/effis_core?
layer: layer:effis:stats_temp

First: is it possible to specify in the QGIS 'Add WMS' dialog the time
parameter?
I tried to append it to the layer name, but without results.

Second: it seems that for some reasons there is a malfunction, as the
dataset is cut in corrispondence of the Scandinavian penisula, like
you can see here:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/512462/varie/wmst-qgis.jpg

Instead the layer is correctly rendered from other clients like
OpenLayers and ArcGIS Desktop:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/512462/varie/wmst-openlayers.png

Thanks for any feedback!

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_-DqY_sg30jM30HtyDNMnTAvQ76w_84rq1MoekdWEsyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As a resource for a plugin I'm working on, I generated standalone
archives of the API docs for 1.7.4 and 1.8.0 to aid in plugin
development, since the online API docs follow the master branch. This
helps developers to write compatible plugins relative to the user
install base (not everyone upgrades QGIS right away ;^). Also, call
descriptions in the API don't always note when it was added to the
API.

http://dakotacarto.com/qgis/QGIS-API_1.7.4.zip  (46 MB)
http://dakotacarto.com/qgis/QGIS-API_1.8.0.zip  (58 MB)

I also optimized ~2,290 pngs to reduce archive/expanded size by 25-30%.

Is there a place in the QGIS.org sites for showing these docs; or,
maybe just available as a download?


Additionally (or maybe alternatively), call descriptions could be
updated with appropriate info on what version of QGIS they originated
with. For example, with the 1.8.0 docs there is disparate info on when
calls were added (granted, probably not all of them are public):

23   'added in 1.8'
29   'added in 1.9'
38   'added in 2.0'

Should all of the 1.9 and 2.0 references be switched to 1.8 right now,
before new additions from 2.0 confuse it further?

My QGIS build version still shows '1.9.0-Master', but the new splash
screen references 2.0. Is 1.9 going to be skipped as a release?

Oh, good point.  qgis.org/api/1.8 added.  qgis.org/api/1.6 and qgis.org/api/1.7
are still available too.

Thanks! I did not know those older APIs were online. I can't find any
reference to them anywhere on qgis.org.

Should they be listed here [0] or here [1]?

Do you think the cleaning up of 'added in x.x' references I mentioned
should be done? (To source, not necessarily to the static API html
pages for 1.8.)

Hi,

Good to know that =) I'll keep working on my plugin with PyQt. Thanks again
for all the help!

Are there any plans to make a C++ or Python port of GGL? From looking

to use it?

AFAIU the plan are to keep it in Java, at now. The QGis integration idea
are:

1 - a plugin to "serve" QGis as a GIS to GGL2 (read/load layers)
2 - (if they're will be foundings) run GGL2 commands from Sextante.

It would be nice to have a C++/Python porting, but it would require a lot
of coding, I suppose...

I can confirm the issue if the missing datasource is a csv file. I will
file a ticket.

I guess its obvious why I asked, but in case it isn't, GGL seems
really cool, like something that we should ship with QGIS and SEXTANTE
but the java depency will probably always relegate it to a non-bundled
functionality (unless we can get broad agreement to make java a
dependency on your system when installing QGIS).

 Hi,

 I am developing a rather complex form init script. During development I 
 would like to reload the code for testing/debugging. However, I always 
 have to fully close and reopen QGIS until the code is refreshed.

 For plugins there is the plugin reloader. Is there similar refresh 
 functionality for the form init scripts?

 Thanks for any hints,
 Andreas

In case of linux systems, I would think that most (if not all)
installations include java, so it's not that much of a requirement.
It might be more complicated in the case of windows and mac.

It would be interesting to have a separate qgis-framework package (or
similar name) that includes sextante and its dependencies and modules
like GGL.
That way you can install qgis without these requirements.

Hi Leyan

 >Why is the ellipse marker separated from the simple marker ?

It was the original plan to merge the two approaches, but was never 
finished.

Btw., there is an ongoing Google summer of code project about improving 
the symbology system, mentored by Alexander Bruy and Martin Dobias 
(http://www.arunmozhi.in/devlog/june-2012/). Maybe it is of interest for 
you.

Marco

Did the same as you a while ago and couldn't find a solution :(
On the bright side it makes you pay attention to program well ;)

That's really not the case as far as the linux systems I use are concerned...
A java dependency for QGIS would really be a pain.

In any case, you will not want to have a dependency between sextante and all 
of its modules. 
They are numerous, and growing. It should be the responsibility of the user to 
install the modules by itself to enable the sextante support with this module.
Otherwise the next QGIS installer will be 1.5Gb and a nightmare to package.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changing the Filter of an existing layer
Message-ID: <59620198618d22f24259890595bfd1ce@carto.net>

 Hi,

 For an existing layer I would like to add/change/remove the WHERE 
 filter by script - the same that one would normally set by the query 
 builder.

 Do I need to change the QgsDataSourceURI() of that QgsVectorLayer and 
 then reload it or is there an easier/more elegant way to change the 
 filter of an existing layer?

 Thanks if you have any ideas or even sample code on how to achieve 
 this.

 Andreas

 I guess I meant most desktop systems, anyway it depends on the user.
 For example, linux mint 12 installs java by itself.

I was referring to a catch-all package that would simplify
installations, although perhaps it's overdoing it.

And I meant this as an additional package (say qgis-framework) which
is separate from the main installer and has a few dependencies - each
of which is an individual package.
This probably makes more sense in linux (.deb/rpm/whatever) and
osgeo4w though. But it would come at a cost for the maintainters.

Cheers
Etienne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New release of CAPS Scenario Builder
Message-ID: <1340204679097-4982747.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All,

I've released a new version of a standalone Windows installer for CAPS
Scenario Builder, tested on Win7, XP and Vista.  This version includes
project management and SFTP upload features.  It also incorporates many bug
fixes and is much more stable than the first release.  Downloads at
(https://github.com/EcoGIS/CAPS-Scenario-Builder/downloads).

In addition, Internet Success: A Study of Open-Source Software Commons is
now shipping from Amazon.com (http://tinyurl.com/d3e4545).  Chapter 6 in the
book is a case study of OSGeo, so some members of this list may be
particularly interested in that chapter.

Thanks all for your work on QGIS.
Bob

Hi Andreas,

layer.setSubsetString( subsetString ) seems the way to go. At least that's
what I use in Time Manager ;)

Best wishes,
Anita

yes, it's QgsVectorLayer::setSubsetString(QString subset)

 Thanks Anita - easier than I thought.

 Apparently one has to refresh the canvas after setting the 
 subsetString.

 Is that how you do it in Time Manager?

 Thanks,

"because it's our very first development in python!"

Adding a Java dependency is out of question IMHO, we have already declined several times.

All the best.

Message-ID: <5ea292e79f8e7f60001d61fdff053708@carto.net>

 Hi,

 Does QgsRubberband have a fixed alpha value for the fill?

 Changing the alpha value with QgsRubberband.setColor() only seems to 
 have an effect for the stroke - the fill seems to have a fixed 
 transparency.

 My goal is to have no fill (fully transparent fill) and a fully opaque 
 stroke with my rubberband, as the transparent fill changes the color of 
 the underlying feature representation.

 Thanks if you have any idea.

 Andreas

I really don't understand the point.
It's up to the user to provide the required packages, as it is with OTB,
SAGA, GRASS, etc.

If someone mean to mantain a big all-included package as a simplified
mega-plugin is onviously free to do it, but IMHO it would be served as a
third party package.

I think some packages are different that others. I discussed this with
Paolo, and my opinion is that GRASS and SAGA are the skeleton of
SEXTANTE for QGIS. GRASS is already included, and SAGA is small enough
to be added as well. They together will provide almost every algorithm
that a normal user might need.

Yes I understand the QGIS part is in python but as I understand the
backend is in Java and that probably won't change?

sorry for the silence, I'm traveling.

first, the ggl2 compiler is java, and second, it's task is to traduce ggl2
code to java code that actually does the job. this means that the
dependency in java is very strong. i know it is a problem and i don't like
it at all, but porting it to another language would be quite expensive so
we dont consider it at this stage.

I guess the best solution so far is to be content making users install qgis
and ggl separatedly. I don't know if this is a big problem.

regards.

Hi,

I mentioned this in my previous post about CAPS Scenario Builder, but
decided that some people may be interested in the book but never look at the
CAPS post.  Sorry about the duplication.

The book is now shipping from Amazon.com (http://tinyurl.com/d3e4545). 
Chapter 6 in the book is a case study of OSGeo, so some members of this list
may be particularly interested in that chapter.

Thanks,
Bob

Sure understood, I just wanted to clarify if this was the case.

I don't think it is a big problem, it just possibly precludes us from
shipping with GGL available 'out of the box' which reduces the
potential user base.

Yes, I counted on that :/

I'm thinking of making the python plugin download and install GGL2
(which includes de jvm) in order to make this step easier...

If there is not yet a package for your platform on the above page,
please check back regularly as packagers are still pushing out their
work and they will update the download page to reflect the new
packages. Along with the release of QGIS 1.8.0, the QGIS Community
Team is hard at work on an updated QGIS Users' Guide version 1.8.0.
The guide will be available in the near future - we will post
announcements when it is available.

Visual tour of the new release:
--------------------------------------------

You can find a list of highlighted changes and new features listed on
the detailed release announcement available here:

http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149

New features with this release:
---------------------------------------------
- QGIS Browser - a stand alone app and a new panel in QGIS. The
browser lets you easily navigate your file system and connection based
(PostGIS, WFS etc.) datasets, preview them and drag and drop items
into the canvas.
- DB Manager - the DB manager is now officially part of QGIS core. You
can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into DB Manager and it will
import your layer into your spatial database. Drag and drop tables
between spatial databases and they will get imported. You can use the
DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and
then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS
as a query layer.
- Action Tool - now there is a tool on the map tools toolbar that will
allow you to click on a vector feature and execute an action.
- MSSQL Spatial Support - you can now connect to your Microsoft SQL
Server spatial databases using QGIS.
- Customization - allows setting up simplified QGIS interface by
hiding various components of main window and widgets in dialogs.
- New symbol layer types - Line Pattern Fill, Point Pattern fill
- Composers - have multiple lines on legend items using a specified character
- Expression based labelling
- Heatmap tool - a new core plugin has been added for generating
raster heatmaps from point data. You may need to activate this plugin
using the plugin manager.
- GPS Tracking - The GPS live tracking user interface was overhauled
and many fixes and improvements were added to it.
- Menu Re-organisation - The menus were re-organised a little - we now
have separate menus for Vector and Raster and many plugins were
updated to place their menus in the new Vector and Raster top level
menus.
- Offset Curves - a new digitising tool for creating offset curves was added.
- Terrain Analysis Plugin - a new core plugin was added for doing
terrain analysis - and it can make really good looking coloured relief
maps.
- Ellipse renderer - symbollayer to render ellipse shapes (and also
rectangles, triangles, crosses by specifying width and height).
Moreover, the symbol layer allows to set all parameters (width,
height, colors, rotation, outline with) from data fields, in mm or map
units
- New scale selector with predefined scales
- Option to add layers to selected or active group
- Pan To Selected tool
- New tools in Vector menu - densify geoemtries, Build spatial index
- Export/add geometry column tool can export info using layer CRS,
project CRS or ellipsoidal measurements
- Model/view based tree for rules in rule-based renderer
- Updated CRS selector dialog
- Improvements in Spatial Bookmarks
- Plugin metadata in metadata.txt
- New plugin repository
- Refactored postgres data provider: support for arbitrary key
(including non-numeric and multi column), support for requesting a
certain geometry type and/or srid in QgsDataSourceURI
added gdal_fillnodata to GDALTools plugin
- Support for PostGIS TopoGeometry datatype
- Python bindings for vector field symbollayer and general updates to
the python bindings.
- New message log window
- Benchmark program
- Row cache for attribute table
- Legend independent drawing order
- UUID generation widget for attribute table
- Added support of editable views in SpatiaLite databases
- Expression based widget in field calculator
- Creation of event layers in analysis lib using linear referencing
- Group selected layers option added to the TOC context menu
- load/save layer style (new symbology) from/to SLD document
- WFS support in QGIS Server
- Option to skip WKT geometry when copying from attribute table
- upport for zipped and gzipped layers
- Test suite now passes all tests on major platforms and nightly tests
- Copy and paste styles between layers
- Set tile size for WMS layers
- Support for nesting projects within other projects

Happy QGIS'ing!

can you propose and attach a patch on the QGIS bug tracker?

I will more than happy (like many other) to give it a try and test it.
The dissolve tool is really crappy right now.

Hi all.
I remove my custom packaged qgis, and installed the official one, on debian unstable,
from qgis.org. It crashes on startup, but with --noplugin it is ok.
Reactivating plugins, it apparently crashes when activating EarthBeat or ValueTool
plugins. The same plugins were running fine in my self compiled version. No message
from the console, just "Errore di segmentazione".
Any hint?
All the best.

with value tool and not earthbeat works fine here on both Windows and
Ubuntu

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyQgis: How to create a map composition in 1:20
	scale
Message-ID: <CAHmdnV5yEuBoTEXH37P0kTpa9EJ7T1EnfePcg7P_cZViCraB1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,
I'm trying to pass to the map composition a layer, setting the scale at 1:20.

with this method I'm creating a bbox around my geometry, then I
convert the measures (in meters) into 1:20 scale to obtain the
dimension of my page.
For example: for a bbox of 1x2 meters I want print a page 5 cm x 10 cm.




	def converter_1_20(self, n):
		n *= 100
		res = n / 20
		return res

	def test_bbox(self):
		self.layerUS.select( [] ) # recuperi tutte le geometrie senza attributi
		featPoly = QgsFeature() # crei una feature vuota per il poligono

		dizionario_id_contains = {}
		lista_quote = []

		self.layerUS.nextFeature( featPoly ) # cicli sulle feature
recuperate, featPoly conterra la feature poligonale attuale
		bbox = featPoly.geometry().boundingBox() # recupera i punti nel bbox
del poligono

		self.height = self.converter_1_20(float(bbox.height()))
		self.width = self.converter_1_20(float(bbox.width()))


Then I try to pass this measures to map composition but I obtain a
different scale. I try to use the metod mapRenderer.setScale(1.20) but
this do nothing.

How can I pass to the printer system to obtain a 1:20 scale map?

Thanks a lot and best regards.
Luca


	def print_map(self):
		mapRenderer = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
		mapRenderer.setScale(1.20)
		mapRenderer.updateScale()
		c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
		c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)

		#map - this item tells the libraries where to put the map itself.
Here we create a map and stretch it over the whole paper size:
		x, y = 0,-4
		
		w, h = c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()
		composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, x, y, w, h)
		c.addItem(composerMap)

		#scale bar
		item = QgsComposerScaleBar(c)
		item.setStyle('Numeric') # optionally modify the style
		item.setComposerMap(composerMap)
		item.applyDefaultSize()
		c.addItem(item)

		width = self.height*10
		height = self.width*10
		dpi = 300

                ....

It may be the same problem as on OS X?  PyQwt needed by valueTool (and profileTool, others) is not compatible with the latest PyQt, and probably never will be.  Plugins using PyQwt need to find another toolbox.

I think you got it: libqwt6 6.0.0-1.2 + python-qwt5-qt4 5.2.1~cvs20091107+dfsg-6+b2
here. Does also EarthBeat use qwt?
Should the plugins be deprecated?
All the best.

I've found a small bug in the Georeferencer plugin.

When I tick the "Use 0 for transparency when needed" and click "Start
georeferencing" against an image that is rotated, I end up with a GeoTiff
that has 3 bands, and black triangles in each corner.  However, if I click
"Generate GDAL script" and manually run the generated commands, a 4 band
GeoTiff is created, with Band 4 as an alpha layer and the 4 corner
triangles marked as transparent.

It seems that Georeferencer is not applying the -dstalpha flag when running
gdalwarp (this is the only difference in the generated script when the "Use
0 for transparency when needed" is toggled).

Hello all (sorry for cross-posting),
As many of you might have noticed, there was a bit of discussion about 
people being scared away from the donate page because of the "Swiss QGIS 
User group" text on top of it.
The fact is that the Swiss QGIS User groupmanages the finances of the 
QGIS.org project (so like in any good movie QGIS has a Swiss bank account).
With immediate effect, we changed the page to replace the text with a 
big nice friendly QGIS logo so that you can all happily go back and 
donate for the awesome QGIS 2.0 :)

happy donating
Marco

Thanks Jurgen,

I decided for now to design and test our customized DigiFract_QGIS with 3D OpenCascade functionality under Ubuntu linux.
We foresaw some other challenges that are easier handled on a linux system.

Though, when having a chance to further debunk the compiling under windows-- I will give a look to the bison or flex setup...
... and report.

Kind regards, Nico

Message-ID: <033B262233FE9A4EA813A4F43F9635151140113E@SRV362.tudelft.net>

Dear developers,

Along with other major changes in fracture software that we design with using the QGIS API, we decided to switch to the master API  1.8/1.9.

Using the python interface, given that self.DigiSurfaceDataLayer.isUsingRendererV2() is True and with self.DigiSurfaceDataLayer.rendererV2().symbol() of type QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2:

how do I set FillStyle and LineWidth?

Previously with the old renderer I could do:
DigiSurfDataLayerSymbol = self.DigiSurfaceDataLayer.renderer().symbol()
DigiSurfDataLayerSymbol.setFillStyle( QtCore.Qt.NoBrush  )
DigiSurfDataLayerSymbol.setLineWidth( 1.0 )

With the new SymbolV2:
* Should I use createSimple() function?
* It asks for a QgsStringMap<http://qgis.org/api/qgsrendererv2_8h.html#ab13d4e9821da606b92748097c691b9dd>/QMap? How do I fill this? With what keys?

Kind regards, Nico

Hi,

Looks like the http://qgis.org/version.txt file, queried by
QgisApp::checkQgisVersion(), needs updated (i.e. Help->Check QGIS

Returns info on 1.7.4 as the latest.

Does this mean that qwt inside qgis core (c++) should be deprecated?

The histogram plot uses qwt, and I have made some modifications to use
a picker and a zoomer using qwt (in a pending pull request).

Qwt itself is good.

As I understand it, Qwt 6 has active development, but I haven't tried it with QGIS.  5.2 stills works fine in QGIS.  PyQwt uses Qwt 5.2 and will not be updated for Qwt 6, and it doesn't look like it will be fixed to work with recent PyQt versions.

If your script is contained just in one script, then it should be
sufficient to use this statement in python console each time you need
to reload the init script:
>>> reload(my_module_name)

Before calling the reload first time, make sure to import the module
also to the python console:

Hope that helps. Reloading in case your script consists of multiple
files might be tricky and a better idea would be to restart qgis. In
future there could be a feature for automatic reloads, but that would
require dependency and module timestamp checking...

Hi Larry

Hmm... are you aware of any reproducible crash? I would be interested
to see where it comes from. The unloader and import hook with
dependency tracking is not bullet-proof, but it should cover the
common cases quite well. You have probably seen that there is also
explicit logic for unloading resource data from pyrcc4-generated files
- without that reloaded plugins tend to crash due to dangling pointer
to resources - and that cannot be handled by a generic reloader.

There could be a module that does all the mandatory imports, so that
would create another branch in the dependency graph, not allowing
those modules to be unloaded, right?

Or eventually it could try to reload the other plugins that are
dependent of the shared python modules.

Yeah, the new python exception output would be very helpful. But the
reloader might be interesting as well :-)

"global" symbol properties are common for all layers: setting symbol's
size/angle/color will modify that property for all symbol layers.
There are various options that can be set only at the level of each
symbol layer.

Yes, where that would be appropriate.

We should definitely merge them.

I see that your patch has been applied already...

That's something that should be fixed, too... a patch to fix that

Yes, that could be changed, too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsRasterLayer::bandStatistics
Message-ID: <4FE81594.1040202@sourcepole.ch>

Hi

While fixing the raster issues (in a branch), I'm trying to clean out 
the raster layer class. Especially, I'm trying to remove symbology 
related elements from the raster layer (like mRedBandName etc.) and have 
the symbology only in the renderers .

Now I'm not sure what to do with the band statistics. QgsRasterLayer 
stores and caches QgsRasterBandStats. However I see in the gdal provider 
that GDAL caches the statistics as well. So my question is if it is ok 
to remove the statistics related members in QgsRasterLayer and go 
directly to the raster providers. Or is there a reason to have it on 
layer level that I missed?

Regards,
Marco

IIRC there is a slow stats gathering implementation in
QgsRasterProvider which is virtual and can overloaded by providers
that are able to get the stats more efficiently. I have some unmerged
code that cleans up the raster stats rendered output which I will
commit after you have done your changes, but no I can't think of any
reason why the provider should not be the canonical source for stats
and the stats calls in the raster layer class removed.


By the way I just noticed that the histogram tool in raster properties
is not working any more for me.

I have seen there is no 1.9.0 version nor a "master branch" version.
Is "Version

Dear core-developpers,

I'm developing the EarthBeat plugin, one of those that seem to crash with the next QGIS release (I could not try myself).
Can you (core-developers) reach an agreement about the libraries that will be maintained in QGIS that 
we can use in replacement of PyQwt5? I mean something you plan to support on long term?

thanks in advance for your recommendations and support,

Bruno

Is there not a QT + pyQT solution so that porting to/from c++/python
be made easier and an identical toolkit for plotting from core and
python plugins?

However, it seems tha matplotlib can be used from qt also (although
this might not be ideal)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using --snapshot option freezes QGis
Message-ID: <CAA6k8-Lj1=0Rg9RnEgNdNJP7aK10Kp=67_7i29eGgCrHUkmCLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

the latest QGis (90b02ecc8) executed with the --snapshot option freezes.
It seems a deadlock occurs in the QgsMapRenderer::render method.

The problem is not due to plugins, I get the sam behavior running it
adding the --noplugins option.

Here's the command:

qgis --snapshot ~/ ~/test.qgs

and here's the backtrace:

BTW the canvas looks resized and overlaps the status bar.
Probably the resizeEvent requests a new paintEvent and something goes
wrong with the maprenderer mutex.

Does anybody confirm?

Well, not for OS X - I already tried recompiling Qwt, PyQt and PyQwt5, no good.  

And as I said, PyQwt5 is known to not work with recent PyQt versions, so if it works it's probably luck.  I don't remember the details, I'd have to dig around again for the discussions about this problem (I think at least one reference was on their mailing list).

I don't know if you have heard from any others, but 2.0.0 is the current target for the master branch. This is a useful patch that will hopefully be applied soon.

Cheers,

I have not done much testing to isolate the crashes. Mostly I have
been consistently reloading my Plugin Editor plugin which has complex
imports and many modules. It tends to crash after ~4-5 reloads,
specifically when trying open the plugin's GUI after it has been
reloaded. Broken pointers to previously not-unloaded resources or
objects looks like the culprit.

I'm thinking to debug this, several specifically built test plugins
with different import and resource setups, and an auto-reloading
plugin that runs on a timer and inspects/logs aspects of the test
plugins' import dependency graphs during reloads would be at good
starting point. It's a little too complicated to debug without some
type of test harness.

Don't have time now, but will look into this after I release my
plugin, because I think it will be a source of instability for some
users when trying to use my Plugin Editor for development.

Yes, that might work. Also, I think there are few enough of the known
core-don't-reload modules to just skip them on a reload by comparison
of whether their package name is in a list, which is what has worked
with my use of reloader.py.

My patched reloader.py [0] chains with qgis.utils, instead of
replacing its __import__ function. Then, reloader is turned on for the
import of modules for testing/running/reloading inside the plugin.
Allows for editing and re-running code directly from within Plugin
Editor, without affecting the normal means of unloading/loading other
plugins.

Since I see reloading as really just a step in the development process
of a plugin, and not a regular user type of operation, I don't see an
issue with reloading other plugins with same dependencies. Maybe an
optional method to do this? Then a developer can choose to reload
other plugins or not.

Hi,

Ok. thanks John for the explanations. So 2.0.0 is considered as a target.
And we won't assign bugs and patches on a 1.9.0 version. One question
though : how will we be able to now with features/bugs will be part of the
next 1.9.0 version in Redmine when releasing it ? I mean keep track of what

version for all of them from 2.0.0 to 1.9.0, and go on targetting new
patches/features on 2.0.0 after the feature freeze ?

Thanks alexander. I did not mean you should review the patch right now,
especially if you are busy !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] label engin settings
Message-ID: <4FE95205.7040401@gmail.com>

Hi all,

When defining the label engine settings, I wonder if the "Show all 
labels" option should be a layer property rather than an engine setting.

Indeed, I'd like for some layer to force the labelling, but not for all 
of them.

What do you think? Did I miss something?

Greetings,

Denis

Hi all.
I have just read about Alex efforts[0] to bring taudem[1] into QGIS.
Quite interesting- Alex, can you tell us more about this?
Will the integration be a separate plugin, or integrated into sextante?
I have seen that taudem is not packaged for Debian - I guess this will be a major 
limitation for the usability of the plugin. Any plan to overcome this?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all.
Sorry to bother again about this. The plugin has wrong metadata:

should be (leading space removed):

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:

This is quite annoying, as the plugin asks always to be updated. Moreover, further 
data are missing. Not having a bug tracking system, there is no way of notifying the 
author directly.
How can we fix this? tjcolley, are you listening?

 Hi,

 I also agree that it should be a per layer option.

 I believe I discussed this with Marco H. already and he said there are 
 some technical (PAL?) issues with trying to do it per Layer only. Maybe 
 he can explain it - I don't remember.

 From a user point of view I would welcome a per layer option for 
 forcing to draw all labels within a layer.

 Andreas

Hi Paolo, hi all.

Right, I'm working on integrating TauDEM (hydrology analysis tools)
in QGIS. The work is almost done, only few minor things left and I
hope to release it this or next week.

As we now have great SEXTANTE framework I decide to integrate this
tools using SEXTANTE. This approach has several advantages, for
example it is easy to create models and run several analysises in one
pass.

Unfortunatelly precompiled TauDEM tools currently available only for
Windows platform. I contacted David (TauDEM author) but he uses
Windows and can't provide Linux binaries. Also to build tools under
Linux small patching is necessary (already submitted to David). I
already prepare SlackBuild scripts for Slackware and will be happy to
help with Debian packaging, but as I'm not Debian user I need some
assistance. Also I thinking about OSGeo4W package, but still unsure
about this as Windows binaries already available for TauDEM homepage.

If there are any additional questions, I'll try to answer.

Thanks a lot Alex - I think packaging is the main stumbling block, so any effort 
removing it will be most welcome.

Hi devs!

As there will be the harder feature freeze for debian 7.0(!) in a few
days I took a look at our server and saw that we are running

cat /etc/debian_version
5.0.10

What about upgrading to 6.0 ? Any objections against it (beside that
some things might not run afterwards) ;)
Usually debian does not make any problems while upgrading but who knows..
But especially the PHP Version running on the server is already not
supported any more ..

Who is brave to try an update?

kind regards
Werner

agree, better upgrading.
I can do it, but probably better if the current admin does it, as he should have a 
clear picture of potential pitfalls.
BTW, do I remember correctly that we planned to move all the site to the django app?
If so, perhaps better wait for this before upgrading?
All the best.

Is there already an django app?
I think we still have to stick to joomla for a while .. I'll try a
upgrade to latest joomla 2.5 once the server is up to some latest
versions. probably it will work (maybe not) .. but it is worth a try.
I can also try to bring debian to the latest version but I don't know
what else is running for different things on the machine .. I myself
only use mysql, php and apache .. but i think there are also some
postgres db and django and other things where i (currently) have no
clue of howto upgrade it ..

kind regards

Not really - but to be honest I hoped that we would already have a 6.0 ;)

Thats the things I am worrying about .. otherwise I think it would not
be a problem to upgrade ..
apache,php and mysql is not problem .. but who else installed
something which is not included in standard debian packages?

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvPopvBhjKLr=QAgrbMNb4sRR4QtEtYqPu8BkQdmDtjjLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am running qgis from the build directory (says build-debug inside
the source folder) with the command ./bin.output/qgis and I run into 2
issues.

First I get a pop-up window "Python Error" about missing sextante with
text below[1].
Disabling sextante did not help but uninstalling sextante resolves it.
No other plugins complain.

Second when I exit qgis I get a segfault :
*** glibc detected *** ./output/bin/qgis: corrupted double-linked
list: 0x000000000312e6f0 ***
======= Backtrace: =========
[...]

gdb backtrace below [2]

Is this supposed to happen, or should I do something to avoid this?
None of these happen if I do a 'make install' and run the installed
qgis.

thanks
Etienne

This is partly a problem of Sextante and partly QGIS problem:
- sextante should not try to do anything in __init__.py (e.g. imports)
- the imports should be moved into classFactory() so that nothing
happens unless the plugin is explicitly started. (this problem will go
away once we stop using metadata from __init__.py and only use them
from metadata.txt)
- when QGIS is run from build directory, it doesn't copy the internal
python plugins to the build output directory - that's why sextante is
complaining about missing plugin installer. We should probably fix
that in order to provide an environment that is as similar to the
installed one as possible

Not sure about that, if you are running latest main branch maybe that
is a side-effect of recent raster refactoring?

doesn't happen if I 'make install' and run the executable in the
install path though

Hi J?rgen
the whole django pipe on which django apps are running (plugins,
pootle, etc...) is configured with virtualenv, so this should not be
an issue as we are installing stuff using pip (but most likely we will
need to upgrade to newest Python versions)
But we will need to re-create the environments and install the applications
Alessandro and Tim could confirm this as well

Hi QGIS devs,


same question here but regarding rasters. I load a GDAL virtual raster that
is being overwritten every time a new raster is available in a raster
repository. Is there any way of reflecting the layer source updates
(changes in the vrt file) in the map?

In a more generic way, I'm attempting to visualize a tile-based raster,
from which I cannot get all tiles at once. Do you think it could be
possible in QGIS?

P.S. Loading each tile as a separate layer wouldn't be possible because of
performance.


Thanks in advance,

Germ?n Carrillo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release problem
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zouCwqFbE=Oi8x_GknoW5hH_L2ZFzeqhOx7_wFCzQsdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am sorry to insist a bit, but I am having problems releasing a new
version of SEXTANTE, due to a problem with the security of the release
system, which does not allow path information in zip files.

Can anyone bypass that somehow? I could send the package to a trusted
source (someone from PSC who might check things and see that there is
nothing wrong in the package), and he could publish it directly.

If not, I will probably upload without help files.

Thanks, and sorry again for repeating this email.

Regards

Victor

I think releasing without the help files would be a damage to our users (many 
analyses are quite complex, and the relative module is almost useless without proper 
documentation).
Could someone please have a look to this issue please, and find a stable solution?
Thanks a lot.

All, please coordinate this with OSGeo SAC. There are some potential
quirks to upgrading the OS on the virtual machines.

As for the websites, Django in a virtualenv will actually break on the
upgrade when the python version changes, a fresh virtualenv will need to
be created, the correct python packages re-added (pip makes this easy)
and the site files copied in.

Sphinx I think is from backports, redmine should continue to work as is
even if the ruby gets updated slightly.

Thanks,
Alex

if it's on a VM, why not reinstalling everything afresh on a different one, and 
switch when ready?

That option is possible, I'll need to verify we have enough disk space
1st and make the request to OSUOSL. Putting a ticket into trac.osgeo.org
would be good to keep track of the progress.

We have 2 choices, a blank or a clone. A clone might take a few minutes
of downtime (10 minutes I think). Clone would obviously save time long term.

Thanks,
Alex

Indeed it's something that PAL does not currently support. But I agree
that it is sometimes useful to label all features even though that
would produce overlaps.

We could improve PAL to place labels in two steps:
1. label features from layers where all features must be labeled,
without collision detection
2. label features from the rest of layers with usual placement
algorithm, labels from step 1 act as obstacles

Hey Victor,

What do you mean path information? Do you want to send me the package
and I'll see if I can upload it although, I suspect I won't be able
too.  I don't really know that much about the plugin site code itself
otherwise I would fix it for you. Tim Sutton should know/have
permission to change the code.

looking at the qgis-django webapp code seems that your zip file
has something wrong.

Here's the code of the webapp that accomplish that check:

    for zname in zip.namelist():
        if zname.find('..') != -1 or zname.find(os.path.sep) == 0 :
            raise ValidationError( _("For security reasons, zip file
cannot contain path informations") )

It seems that filenames within your zip contains also path
informations. I'm not sure I understood well what path information
is, but I suppose is something that defines where to put each file
when it's extracted.
So if you extract only one file (e.g. sextante/images/config.png)
the zip application want to put it within the sextante/images folder.
This could be a problem if you put files with path information
like "/usr" or just "/" of "../../../something".

Which command do you use to zip the plugin folder?
This is the command I run to zip my plugins:

zip -r PLUGIN_NAME.zip PLUGIN_FOLDER -x \*.svn* -x \*.pyc -x \*~ -x
\*entries\* -x \*.git\*

Hope this helps.
Regards.

Right what it's trying to prevent is full paths so that a zip doesn't
nefariously put stuff at / on a nix style system or C:/ on windows
system. Relative directory structure should not be effected by this. So
as Giuseppe points out it's a matter of finding the right zip options.

Enjoy,
Alex

If one of the QGIS folks bothers taking care of the custom add-ons, I'd
offer to upgrade the Debian distro.

Just a quick note that I have finished support for browsing, editing,
and reloading of custom feature forms and their init scripts, from
within QGIS, in my plugin, Plugin Editor [0]. I hope to do an early
release next week (Mac-, Linux-only).

I would appreciate any testing of editing/reloading of custom feature
forms init scripts, especially complex ones like you mention, Andreas.
I don't generally use them and need to do more testing.

*Does anyone have a project file with data, and a lot of forms and
init scripts that they could share?*

Currently the reloading method used is the same as what Martin
suggested. I will be trying to integrate a customized reloader.py
module, with dependency tracking, etc. [1] with this function as well.

Message-ID: <4FEAAC0C.4000702@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am (almost) a complete newbie in c++. I am trying to get into it, by 
adding a new edit type for vector layers. I am adding something similar 
to valuerelation to have multi-attribute edit type (using a join table 
and an attribute table).

Basically, I reused almost exactly the same code as valuerelation, at 
first. It won't give anything working, but it allows me to learn.

I can compile, but when I run qgis, I have this python error at launch:

ImportError: /home/denis/opt/builds2/share/qgis/python/qgis/core.so: 
undefined symbol: _ZN10QgsProject21setTopologicalEditingEb


Then, when I opened the layer properties dialog and I try to change the 
edit type, QGIS crashes and I have the following output in the terminal:
symbol lookup error: /home/denis/opt/builds2/bin/qgis: undefined symbol: 
_ZN14QgsVectorLayer14multiAttributeEi


I found a similar error on the list 
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-May/020401.html, 
but uninstalling and deleting the share directory did nothing.

Does someone has any idea on what could be going wrong?

Thanks

Denis

Hi,

No, I don't think so.

Here is what I did:

Fork on github
Clone on my pc
Edit some cpp, h and ui files.
Create a build-ma folder in the qgis directory as explained here 
http://www.qgis.org/api/INSTALL.html#toc10
Run ccmake ..
Set  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  to /home/denis/opt/builds2
And then, make, make install

Hi Denis

Could it be your qgis executable does not use the libqgis_core.so you 
compiled? If so, you may set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the 
location of your qgis libs.

Marco

Hi again,

I did export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/denis/opt/builds2/lib/ before running 
QGIS and it worked.

Thanks a lot!!!

One more thing, is there anyway to fix this permanently?
Is there anything I can change in make?

Hi Denis

 >One more thing, is there anyway to fix this permanently?

Either set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to /usr (but that's bad in case you have 
a parallel installation from package). Or set the library path into your 
bash configuration (.bashrc)

Marco

I would recommend to run QGIS from the build directory - like that you
will not have to do 'make install' after each compilation and it also
does not require you to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (the paths are handled
internally with rpath). You just need to run this from root source
directory: ./build-ma/output/bin/qgis

Done! Thanks for your help

With the suggestion from Giuseppe, I was able to locate the
problematic files (SAGA help files that included "...." in its name)
and fix the problem.

Version 1.0.7 is already available for download

Hopefully people will use it, find more bugs and have more ideas, and
soon we will have a new version and we will get closer to a final one
that can be directly integrated in the QGIS core

Regards

Victor

That is "normal" was discusses yesterday IIRC. Running from the build dir
has no python. But saves you make install all the time.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] full access to feature in createAttributeEditor
Message-ID: <4FEADA10.4070406@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Maybe still a newbie question, but I don't know how to go around this.

To perform 0-n relations, I need to access another attribute value of 
the current feature (basically its id) in createAttributeEditor.

And as far as I understand it, I only have access to the layer, the 
index of the attribute and its value. But not to the feature (or its id).

How can I do this?

Thanks a lot.

Denis

Hi. I'm trying to set up Qgis server on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise.

All went well including starting apache, downloading dependencies and Qgis
Server itself.
But after trying to get cap. I'm getting an error ('

Any ideas why it isn't working? I know that 12.04 is anew developement but
there has to be way out. Cheers.

Not sure it was characterized as "normal", because other plugins don't
complain, but it's "expected".  Filed bug reports about this.

Hi!

I would assist in upgrading - but reading what has to be done I wonder
if we should wait for debian 7.0 and upgrade/reinstall when the latest
version is here .. should not be such far away - considering debian
tradition I would say about a year ;)

It's not SUCH urgent but I think things will not get better (on the
other hand - never touch a running system) ..

So .. It was only a question .. some day we have to do it ..

kind regards
Werner

gnuplot latest release is from 03/2012.
Not sure the project is actively maintained.

I'd say this vastly depends on what you're actually planning to do - as
usual  :-)
If you're aiming at a complete reinstall, then it *might* be worthwhile
to wait for the next Debian stable, otherwise I'd highly recommend to
dist-upgrate from 5.x to 6.x first instead of going from 5.x to 7.x
directly.

Debian releases are usually delayed by a couple of months, thus if
you'd like to catch the latest security fixes, waiting for the next
stable might not be the first choice.

Cheers,
	Martin.

Hi, I notice qgis
use always INFO_FORMAT=text/plain wen do a GetFeatureInfo to a wms server.

I guess this is a bug so fill a ticket:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5887

Infact if the WMS server know only the XML (for example).
If qgis ask for a text/plain on the response qgis show poor information.

I try to do a test using this server:

http://web.regione.toscana.it/wmsraster/com.rt.wms.RTmap/wms?map=wmscastore&language=ita&&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&BBOX=668331.229488,4811465.357429,673510.586851,4815361.018647&CRS=EPSG:25832&WIDTH=581&HEIGHT=437&LAYERS=r_toscan_cst_delimitazione_fogli&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&QUERY_LAYERS=r_toscan_cst_delimitazione_fogli&INFO_FORMAT=text/xml&I=359&J=189

If try to query the "r_toscan_cst_delimitazione_fogli" layer using qgis I
see only the record number.

Message-ID: <769f8900e69c16c32f757d3633859f77@carto.net>

 Hi all,

 I am discussing with Oslandia (the authors of the Atlas plugin for 
 serial printing) an option to include Atlas into QGIS core.

 Currently it is a python plugin, the idea would be to port it to C++ 
 and include it with QGIS by default. It would also be an opportunity to 
 fix several bugs and maybe feature requests.

 To see what it does:
 see
 http://www.oslandia.com/tech/?p=1079
 and
 http://hub.qgis.org/projects/atlas
 and
 http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/atlas/

 Oslandia made me an offer/estimate on how much the C++ port and fixing 
 of some bugs would cost. We can only finance parts of it. If one or two 
 others are joining we could probably do it. If not, we will just go with 
 some bug fixing in the Python plugin.

 Please contact me offlist if you are interested in this functionality 
 and are able to contribute financially.

 Andreas

Good idea. Would the idea be to port it as a plugin or intergrate it
into the composer. The later would be very cool. Kind of like the data

Hi Nathan,

The idea would be to develop a first integration into the composer. The first 
version would probably look like the current python plugin, but according to 
the budget we have we will be able to do a full and seamless integration.

Contact Andreas and/or me if interested in funding.

I had the same problem, and it turned out being a packaging problem (different pyqt
versions). recompiling solved it.
All the best.

OK, so I tried to recompile qgis from an emptied build dir, but ccmake 
gives me this error while configuring:

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they 
are set to NOTFOUND.
  Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the 
CMake files:
  PYTHON_LIBRARY
      linked by target "qgispython" in directory 
/usr/local/src/qgis/src/python
      linked by target "python_module_qgis_analysis" in directory 
/usr/local/src/qgis/python
      linked by target "python_module_qgis_core" in directory 
/usr/local/src/qgis/python
      linked by target "python_module_qgis_gui" in directory 
/usr/local/src/qgis/python
      linked by target "python_module_qgis_networkanalysis" in directory 
/usr/local/src/qgis/python

could that have anything to do with it? Qgis used to build fine, and I 
definitely have python and pyqt installed. Or is this just because I 
have both python2.7 and python3.2 installed?

btw, the source folder was updated from git just yesterday.

best,
Vincent.

sorry to reply-to-self...

update:
I set cmake PYTHON_EXECUTABLE to /usr/bin/python2, and PYTHON_LIBRARY to 
/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so, as said in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5069 
(this is also on arch linux).
qgis builds fine.

however, when I try to install the valuetool plugin, it still crashes 
with a segmentation fault.

best,
Vincent.

I hope this is helpful. I did compile qgis in debug mode, but I think 
all my (py)qt stuff was not compiled for debugging...
If I can help more, please let me know.

Vincent.

 Hi,

 I will soon attend a workshop discussing the establishment of symbology 
 interchange between different GIS.

 Our idea is to suggest SLD with FE and SE.

 My question is if anyone has experience with the interoperability 
 between the QGIS exported SLD and other software like UMN Mapserver or 
 Geoserver or even some commercial GIS. Does it work interchangeably?

 Thanks for sharing your experiences,
 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

my only experience until now is just about a few shapefiles I have
downloaded and that were provided with a SLD symbology file. I don't
know how that SLD files were created but they worked just fine under
QGIS.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] vectorlayer new edit type: multi attribute
Message-ID: <4FEC86E6.4090609@gmail.com>

Hi all,

As I was very demanding these last 2 days, you probably know I was 
trying to add a new edit type for vector layers.
Suppose you have a table of options, and you can now select from 0 to n 
of this options in a field.
Maybe with an image, it's clearer:
http://postimage.org/image/43fu7kdbn/

I think my code is ok, it is available here 
https://github.com/3nids/Quantum-GIS and I made a pull request 
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/189.

However, due to my poor knowledge of QGIS and cpp, there's a few things 
I'm not sure:

1. I do not check the type of the field. Basically it should be either 
integer[] or string. My code is writing the field as a string :
'{optionid_a,optionid_b,etc}'
as explained here 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/arrays.html#ARRAYS-INPUT
I don't know if we're supposed to let the user check this or if I should 
code this.

2. There is a few lines I copied from the valuerelation edit type 
without understanding what it actually does...
https://github.com/3nids/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp#L5736 
<https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsvectorlayer.cpp#L5714>
Jurgen just fixed something in this one. I don't get what it's doing.

3. There is some redundancy in the code which updates the columns.
https://github.com/3nids/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/app/qgsattributetypedialog.cpp#L57
and
https://github.com/3nids/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/app/qgsattributetypedialog.cpp#L680
But, there might be something to be done with signal mapping but that's 
beyond my competences. I tried this once in python with no success.

4. More on the postgres side, there is something annoying: apparently 
the foreign key is not working: you can delete an option even if it's 
used in some features.

Please let me know what you think. Fill free to give me advice on coding 
as I am beginner.

Happy testing,

Denis

PS: a small sample set in postgis

CREATE SCHEMA test;
CREATE TABLE test.attributes (id serial NOT NULL);
ALTER TABLE test.attributes ADD COLUMN value varchar(30);

Nice work. Thanks for the contribution.

I took the liberty to commit the stuff with some modifications.

Instead of adding the MultipleAttribute struct I just added a "multiple
selection" flag to the value relations.  This removes all of the duplication
involved and also enables the "order by value" option for the list.

I also updated the SIP bindings and ran the code to scripts/prepare-commit.sh.

Indeed this sounds like a useful datatype. I am sure I will have some
use for it.

I already found a project I can improve with this new data type.

Thanks to both Denis and J?rgen!

Hi all.
To this list must be added all the plugins from 3rd parties repos.
Some of them, as pointed out by Primin, are quite important.
All the best.

Hi all,

I've just finished migrating all our plugins to new repo.
Only Metatools plugin still in GIS-Lab repo, because it
contains 3rd party binaries (FGDC editor and validator)

Oh, I didn't realize this. Not very good news - can you tell us more about this? Is
the dependency avoidable? Can the binary be replaced?

This binaries are temporarily used for FGDC metadata support. In future FGDC
support will be native, but I can't exactly say when.

This dependency can be removed and FGDC support disabled. Or alternatively
we can exclude binaries and add note to the documentation. So users will need
to download them and put into plugin folder

I would vote for removing the binaries, and provide users with a message about
installing them.
I guess it will be smoother than having to add a different repo, and more easily
manageable, especially because not all users need FGDC support.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] a few questions on qgis server/wfs
Message-ID: <1340994439.2520.7.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I have set up a fair large project to be used to serve wfs layers with
qgis server.

I'm noticing a few things and I would like to have feedback to
understand if are local issues or not.

*) the layer list in the qgis client is presented in reverse alphabetic order.

*) if in the "display name" attribute of a layer there are chars like "/", ":", "-", then the qgis wfs client
fails to download correctly such layers. Is this a standard problem that does not
allow such chars? 

No problems with such chars in the "title" and "abstract" fields of the "metadata" tab.

*) I noticed that a particular wfs layer was apparently loaded correctly with the qgis client
but then I discovered it had an empty table of attributes. Looking into the table of the original vector
(postgis) I discovered that a column name had garbled title because of some kind of encoding issue (probably
coming from the original shapefile rather then a import problem into postgis). I fixed the title
and the layer loaded correctly as wfs layer.


Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <CALuHMPAoAHz90fwbXRrWhpg1HJsMNowVghjXz0171R5fM8DzjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all and sorry for cross-posting.

I happy to announce TauDEM provider for QGIS.

TauDEM [0] is a set of of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for
the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography
as represented by a DEM

An this plugin is a SEXTANTE provider plugin and allows to run
TauDEM command line tools directly from QGIS using excellent
SEXTANTE framework [1].

Plugin available from QGIS Official repository [2]. Before running
it please install SEXTANTE plugin first. As this is only front-end
you also need working TauDEM command line tools. Windows
users can use precompiled binaries and installation instruction
from project homepage [0]. For Linux users I prepare small
instruction in README.TauDEM file [3], hope this helps a bit
until packages for major distributions will be available.

If you found a bug or want to leave feature request please use
plugin bugtracker [4]

Thanks a lot for this. Please do your best to have the debs included in debian main.
I not very happy with the idea of putting our Linux users at a disadvantage compared
to our Windows ones.
I'm ready to help if necessary.
All the best.

Hi!

regarding windows and linux users we have now a draw situation.
Windows users have it harder to install HomeRange plugin because of
rpy2 and now TauDEM is easier for them..

Of course this was only a joke ..
It would be fine to treat every operating system the same.
Lets hope it will be soon easy to install TauDEM on Linux as well as
some rpy2 substitute on Windows.

Well done Alex - I can't wait to try TauDEM
Thanks a lot for that

regards
Werner

IMHO the R scripts should be reimplemented as Sextante models, avoiding the
dependency on rpy2. This should be easy for HR plugin, more complex for SDA4PP, and
requires a different approach for ManageR.
All the best.

BTW, I see that many of the analyses in TauDEM are also available in GRASS: has
anyone checked the difference in results?
All the best, and thanks.

I didn't use an order toi pr?sente th? list

In WFS, the layer name and attribute name is used to set GML element name.
The layer name and attribute name has to respect XML ?l?ment naming.

"metadata" tab.

These informations are in the content of GML element.

The attribute name has to respect the XML element naming.

Thanks for your feed back.

I probably have to add some code to automatically change layer and
attribute naming ?

Merci Ren? for clarifying this.
BTW: any plan to implement WFS-T anytime soon?
All the best.

Hi Ren?,

thanks for the answer

so this could be a client issue,
anyone is seeing this?

>From a user point of view I would say "yes", that would be good. It
seems to me that is pretty common to rename layers in TOC of project,
and adding things like "-" or "(" does not seem unusual. 

I guess that this should also be documented in the user manual.


cheers!

I've already tested some code for implementing WFS-T
I hope to do it during the summer if I find times or money
