Subject: [Qgis-developer] Missing next() method in Python 3
	QgsFeatureIterator in master
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672De6aPqDQFZJgQaCvcroG9p7TTLUDoWE=_dgCz6P0WPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to adapt a test to Py3/Qt5 and I get this odd error:

AttributeError: 'QgsFeatureIterator' object has no attribute 'next'

The C++-like call works fine:

fit=layer.dataProvider().getFeatures(request)
f=QgsFeature()
fit.nextFeature(f)
True


the layer is a test layer:
layer.dataProvider().dataSourceUri()
"dbname='/tmp/tmp57y5_gmm/offlineDbFile.sqlite'
table='wfs_test_point20160701113316894'(Geometry) sql="

Same error in python console with a shapefile layer.

Any idea?

Message-ID: <5776456A.6040400@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm compiling QGIS master on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine (fresh installation) 
with the debian rules..

after the make running there are some test made, some of them reaches 
the timeout (1500 sec).. is that behavior normal? in this way it takes a 
a huge time to compile QGIS.. is it possible to reduce the timeout size? 
or is that my fault?

"incriminated" tests are:

  24/242 Test  #24: qgis_composermultiframetest .............***Timeout 
1500.04 sec
157/242 Test #157: PyQgsComposerHtml .......................***Timeout 
1500.09 sec



Thanks!

Matteo

I thought that the RefactoringTool: was taking care of that.

Isn't the 2to3 run automatically on the test python files too?

In my case the error was not directly in a test but in a file imported by a
test: offlineditingtestbase.py is that the reason why it was not refactored?

Hi Matthias,

I see that in debian/rules webkit is disabled for some distribution

ifneq (,$(findstring $(DISTRIBUTION),"sid stretch xenial"))
	CMAKE_OPTS += -DWITH_QTWEBKIT=FALSE


I'm on xenial right now.. but same thing happens on a debian stretch 
machine..

anyway it should be installed.. do I have to add also other packages?

I guess you are referring to -DPORT_PLUGINS=ON (which is enabled on
travis/py3).

No.
Actually it would be better if it wouldn't even run on plugins, but that
would mean that it would have to be run on their source and that might
potentially break them for python 2. Since plugins miss comprehensive
tests (and most of them miss tests at all) that would point out issues
and since python 2 is our current stable target that's too much risk.
Tests on the other hand have a pretty good test coverage inherently, so
they can be ported statically.

I don't want to misrepresent what Sandro is asking, but I think it's the
same as me. I think (and this is from memory), that we need to do this to
the QGIS app canvas instance, rather than a newly created one.

When I run canvas.resize() locally, it behaves as I expect. I can then run
qgis2web (this is my reason for wanting to solve this), to export a web map
of the same size as the canvas.

What I don't understand is that when testing under Travis, with the same
canvas.resize() in the test script, I get different bounds in the webmap to
what I get when resizing my client canvas and exporting.

This experience was a while ago, of course. Perhaps the qgis2web code has
evolved so that this now works - I'll look into it when I can. However, last
time around, it didn't work for me, hence my earlier message to this list.

I guess the problem lies in the fact that canvas widget has a frame at
its edge (it is drawn within the area of canvas widget). There may be
differences between the "internal" area of canvas due to different Qt
styles being used. To see the outer vs inner measurements:

>>> iface.mapCanvas().geometry()
PyQt4.QtCore.QRect(0, 0, 879, 390)
>>> iface.mapCanvas().viewport().geometry()
PyQt4.QtCore.QRect(3, 3, 873, 384)

Probably what you need to do is to remove the frame altogether:

>>> iface.mapCanvas().setFrameStyle(0)

Then you get:

>>> iface.mapCanvas().geometry()
PyQt4.QtCore.QRect(0, 0, 879, 390)
>>> iface.mapCanvas().viewport().geometry()
PyQt4.QtCore.QRect(0, 0, 879, 390)

Hope that helps!

Cheers
Martin

Ah, OK! I didn't know anything about a canvas frame. So, without doing
setFrameStyle(), does canvas.extent() give canvas.geometry() or
canvas.viewport().geometry()?

Thanks

Attempts to add a test for QgsMapToolNodeTool result
in failures due to the class not being exported.

Is there a policy about what to do in these cases ?
Should I just export the class or is there some other
test-oriented trick ?

Still, my problem is the following:

  QgsMapCanvas *mCanvas = new QgsMapCanvas();
  mCanvas->resize( QSize(50, 50) );
  mCanvas->setExtent( QgsRectangle( 0, 0, 50, 50 ) );
  QCOMPARE( mCanvas->scale(), 1.0 ); //<-- fails, returning 3.1631e+07

I think what you are up to is not to find out scale(), but actually
mapUnitsPerPixel(). Scale in QGIS is calculated as ( extent_width / (
canvas_width * dpi) ) with some extra conversions involved, see
QgsScaleCalculator class.

Try this in PyQGIS console:

>>> cx = QgsMapCanvas()
>>> cx.setFrameStyle(0)
>>> cx.resize(QSize(100,100))
>>> cx.setExtent(QgsRectangle(0,0,100,100))
>>> cx.show()
>>> cx.mapSettings().outputSize()
PyQt4.QtCore.QSize(100, 100)
>>> cx.mapSettings().mapUnitsPerPixel()
1.0

One caveat here is the fact you need to call show() method of canvas,
otherwise the resize event (that sets image output size) will not be
fired and thus the image output size not updated.

Cheers
Martin

With the frame, canvas.extent() is linked to size reported by
cavas.viewport().geometry().

Even better is to use canvas.mapSettings().outputSize() that gives you
the actual image size used for rendering (although it should be the
same as the size from canvas.viewport().geometry()).

Thanks, with the show() trick, mapUnitsPerPixel() works as expected
(while scale() still gives wild returns, maybe due to wild dpis..)

Another huge +1 in support of your efforts. Fantastic stuff!

My preference would be to the one redmine=one github comment version (#17).

Hi all,
I have been pointed out to a potentially useful function: removing
adjacent labels with the same content, giving a distance (in map units
or in canvas units) as a parameter. AFAIK this is currently not possible
in QGIS. Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

I think exporting is fine.

Hi,
in the interest of being prepared and get right to coding once at the code
sprint,
I was wondering, anyone has demo projects with complex styling that I could
use to perform style transfer tests?
Having them in Bonn would be nice, having them as downloads before the
conference
would be even better :-)

Cheers
Andrea

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map Composer "dinamic" number of pages based on
	attribute table
Message-ID: <DB5PR08MB0808950E171B0DAF0C21C847A7270@DB5PR08MB0808.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to understand if it is possible to dinamically set up
the number of pages of the Map Composer, i would like
to create some reports with a map and attribute table/tables
based on  query results, of course the resulting table can have
a variable number of items, requiring one or more pages;
so before trying to "reinvent the wheel" i'm looking for some
pyqgis function or method (if it exists) or some suggestion.
I found that "Reportlab" could handle such scenario but is
it possible to achieve something similar using only pyqgis?

Thanks, Roy.

Hi Andrea,

That sounds like a good plan, I certainly do have some projects. I'm
sure there are plenty of other people with interesting projects as well.

Have a look at the qgep_en Project here:

  https://github.com/QGEP/QGEP/tree/master/project

You can get the demo data (postgis) here:

  https://github.com/QGEP/data/archive/demodata.zip

Also something nice to check would be these styles by Anita Graser:

https://github.com/anitagraser/QGIS-resources/tree/master/qgis2/osm_spatialite

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build failure following qt creator setup
	instructions
Message-ID: <CA+nxMTukq2qXme51b-aktb5ZWTVOHS73ku=JUYDxUBwD7uT1QQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to setup qgis source code in QT creator on a freshly installed
Linux Mint 18 (released a few days ago).
The instructions seem to mostly work, except once building I get into this
error:

Generating pyqgis api file
[ 82%] Built target qsci-api
[ 82%] Built target pyfuture
[ 82%] Built target zzz-GdalTools-3-depend

Error while building/deploying project qgis2.15.0 (kit: Desktop)

I've installed the required dependencies following instructions in this
line of the INSTALL guide:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL#L190

and I've verified that pyuci4 and associated libraries are installed, e..g:

> sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools  pyqt4.qsci-dev
Lettura elenco dei pacchetti... Fatto
Generazione albero delle dipendenze
Lettura informazioni sullo stato... Fatto
pyqt4-dev-tools is already the newest version (4.11.4+dfsg-1build4).
pyqt4.qsci-dev is already the newest version (2.9.1+dfsg-4build1).
0 aggiornati, 0 installati, 0 da rimuovere e 14 non aggiornati.

Any clue as to why the build is failing?

I've also tried following the Ubuntu instructions inj
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL,
in that case ccmake fails to find qwtpolar, which does not seem to be a
package included in Mint 18
(I've found libqwt5-qt4 and installed it, but it did not help)... does one
has to hand build this package
in order to build qgis?

Cheers
Andrea

Do you have (an old version of) QGIS installed via package manager?

You can cmake it with -DWITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF or -DWITH_INTERNAL_QWTPOLAR=ON.

Hi,

I made a video to show what I did this week: https://youtu.be/f9u3-uWDNm0

OOT a bit, I think we can extend the current Plugin Manager to also be able
to install a plugin directly from Git repositories. It could be useful in
the plugin development life cycle. For example in InaSAFE, before releasing
the plugin, it should be tested by users (which are not familiar with GIT
or 'copying' directly the plugin into their local qgis2 directory). One of
the solution is to publish that version of the plugin in other repository.
But I think it would be handy if we can enable users to install the latest
version of the plugin (if we know the GIT repository of the plugin) in the
Plugin Manager itself.


*What did you get done this week?*

   - Move collections cache into a pickle file
   - Downloading the collection nicely with Dulwich.

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - I will start working on importing the resources available in the
   collection in to QGIS. I will implement it using the same pattern like
   Repository Handler. The resource handler is a base class and there will be
   some resource handler classes based on its type (whether it's SVG or
   colorramp/symbol). I will focus on the SVG first since I still have some
   missing pieces to implement the colorramp/symbols one :)
   - I will make a doc site using documentup and start writing
   documentation.

*Are you blocked on anything?*
No

Yes, QGis 2.8.6 Wien, as part of the standard packages of Mint.
Are you suggesting to remove it?  Was kind of hoping to have two
versions side by side, one stable for day to day work, and one built fresh
to test SLD generation changes.

I keep multiple versions side-by-side, running each from its build dir
(output/bin/qgis). It works fine that way.

I am not sure what causes the build failure, it's not the first time I
hear about it but I've never been able to properly trace it to its roots
(and it never happened for me).
In short: I'm trying to find the cause.

If you could remove the qgis-python package from the system and check
back if the build failure persists that would help to assess the problem.

Hey, I still haven't tried this but in the meantime the command line build
worked (after some fight with ccmake), I did not stumble into the
same error. So... well, I guess that gives me a way forward, but
I'll have a another look at the QT Creator build to see if the issue can be
traced, in order to add warnings/more directions into the dev guide.

Cheers

Hi all,
a frequent request from user is a better management of geotagged photos.
What most users expect is to:
1. be able to load geotagged photos
2. display the locations
3. display the photo clicking on the location
* possibly also to show a miniature.
Currently we have:
* an old and relatively complex C++ plugin, much more powerful than
this, and thus overkill for such a simple task
* the external plugin photo2shape, that only do #1 and #2, has issues
with py libraries, and leaves photos in an external path
* a plugin that helps georeferencing photos.
My suggestion would be to modify photo2shape to save on a
spatialite/geopackage db:
* the photos
* their locations
* the line joining consecutive points
* the photos themselves
* a form that will display the photo on click.
Such a plugin would be IMHO a good candidate for inclusion in core.
Is anyone working on something similar? Better ideas?
All the best.

GDAL also seems to support reading EXIF information if we want to use that
to avoid any extra libraries.

Oh, right, good suggestion, thanks Nathan. Moreover, it can also create
thumbnails:
http://www.gdal.org/frmt_jpeg.html
So the work from QGIS side seems considerably reduced.
In the far past, reading EXIF was a bit a black magic, beacuse vendors
implemented it with lots of variations, thus many exif readers failed
often: does anybody have recent experience, is GDAL driver working in
most or all cases?
Thanks again.

Hi, 

I also think that there is enough interest by many people/organizations
to have support for it in QGIS core. 

I would have the following (mostly additional) requirements: 

1. being able to read a whole folder with photos
2. Support for additional graphic file formats next to JPEG.
Professional photographers don't store their data in JPEG documents, but
in their RAW files(e.g. NEF (Nikon Raw format), CRW (Canon Raw format))
3. Support for GPSDestXX Tags to diplay the target point. The target
point is in my opinion more important than the point where the photo was
taken
4. Support for GPSDestBearing/GPSDestDistance to show the direction from
the photo standpoint to the target point
5. When clicking on a photo it would be nice if the view angle could be
visualized, taking into account the fov (field of view) of the lense,
GPSDestCoordinates or GPSDestBearing/Distance, based on whatever is
available in the EXIF data
6. Being able to interactively edit EXIF data in QGIS, esp.
GPSDestLongitude/GPSDestLatitude, GPSDestBearing/GPSDestDistance. 

See http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF and
http://www.geofoto.ch/geophotomap/ (when you click with the "i" Button
on a photo point, the view angle is displayed (see item 5 above)) 

Paolo: do you have funding for such improvements? I may be able to
contribute privately in autumn in a crowd-funding effort (esp. for items
2-6 above) 

Perhaps we should first write a complete specification of what we expect
from such a tool.

Let's talk about funding on the next PSC. Crowdfunding is certainly a
good option.

Agreed. Since you have lots of material, would you mind starting it?
IMHO better divide the tasks in basic and nice to have, so we can do it
in steps.
All the best.

I don't think I knew about show() either, so I have a couple of things to

Yes - I can start with a specification document. But not this week -

Hi Andrea,

I agree to a have a set of data and rendering project to have a
systematic way to test... a set of data and a set of rendering coupled
with the tool set by Alessandro Pasotti, would facilitate a systematic
code.

The best set of data and rendering I found is related witha a similar
work done for the rt_mapserver_plugin by Ádám Barancsuk
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_mapserver_exporter/pull/5

data and project are here:
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_mapserver_exporter/tree/2.0/test/data

I tried to implement a Qml2Sld converter using visitor patterns but I
failed because qml is a mixture of hierarchic structure mixed with
key/value flat organization with some interdependence among nodes...
btw another reason can be related with my technical limitations :) )
Btw I explored the test data above generating a couple of QMLs and
(actual qgis generated) SLDs for each "atomic" symbol used in this set
of test data.
https://github.com/luipir/qml2sld-plugin/tree/master/qml2sld/tests/testdata/rt_mapserver_exporter

The idea was to feed the Alessandro Pasotti geoserver/qgis renderer comparator.

would be fine if mathias can fragments their project and symbols to
some kind of "unit" symbols to replicate in both platforms

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

Done


Médéric Ribreux-2 wrote

This was not enough... at least in our case.

The solution came from granting rights specifically to the geometry column
("GEOM") with:
GRANT UPDATE ("GEOM") ON "MYSCHEMA"."MYTABLE" TO "OTHERSCHEMA_USER";

It seems that other software like MapInfo and MicroStation would not check
for rights on the geometry column since editing geometries in the Oracle
database worked withouth this right being set.

Thanks a lot Médéric!!

Yeah, I had the same idea some time ago, get a QGis project and add a
GeoServer Importer
plugin that would import the project fully, as a new workspace, including
data sources, layers,
and styles.
However that seemed a bit too large for a spare time project, and I am not
clear about what kind
of version to version compatibility rules there are for the project file
contents (e.g., how much
maintenance would one have to face in order to chase after QGis evolution
over the years).

Cheers
Andrea

FYI,

we are currently investigating the possibilities to link photos to
geometries in QField.

The idea is to use the ExternalResource widget with image flag as
indicator that photos are a suitable input for this field.
Then save them in a subfolder of the QGIS project + the relative path to
the file in the attribute.

It's only partially related, but it may be interesting nontheless.

​Work is being done in this area, intended to be an extension of the
RasterLite2 library (of the spatialite project), which will hopefully come
out this year.

The Raster-support in RasterLite2 supports Georeferenced images called
Raster-Coverage's.

The idea would be to add support for Geotaged images in the form of an
'Album'
- one Album containing images
- each Album could belong to another Album

For each Image, the Exif-Information would be extracted and stored in the
row together with the original image.
- spatialite already has reading capabilities for Exif-Information (but at
the moment no writing)
The GPS-Information is then stored in a MULTIPOINT Geometry
- 2 points if GPSDest* Information was found

Since the Exif-Information is stored in the row
- the idea would be that it could be changed and the image updated (and
exported)

Based in the existing RasterLite2 logic, where there is an extra TABLE
containing a summery of Information about for each Raster-Coverage
- there would be a corresponding 'Album-Coverage' would exist with one
entry per Album (as a summery), containing
-- the area the photos inside the Album contains --> to zoom to the area
-- a MULTILINE GEOMETRY which shows all the LINESTRING that exist in the
Album
-- a MULTIPOINT GEOMETRY which shows all the images that do not have
GPSDest* Information
-- an GEOMETRYCOLLECTION, containing both) also exists, but in my version
of QGIS at least,  GEOMETRYCOLLECTION cannot be displayed
- Bearing and distance being calculated when possible.

This had be developed about 2 years ago for a historical Database project
- about 600 images were at that time collected
- short (title) long (image description) where collected an added with the
exiftool
-- setting fields used by linux, mac and windows file explorers (each
system using different fields)
- the estimated position where the photo was shot from being set as the
GPSLat/Long value
- the main point of interest set as the GPSDest* value

The RasterLite2 tool 'rl2sniff' was initially used as a base
- which runs through a directory, searching for Georeferenced images

This tool was adapted (called 'rl2sniff_album') to also look for geotagged
images
- and add it to the Database
-- after a refresh in QGIS, the POINTS or LINESTRINGs show up so that
correction can be made when needed

So much of what of what is being requested, is being considered and at the
moment I am working
on moving the present logic from the rl2-tool into RasterLite2-Library so
that it can be SQL-Driven
- retrieve, Import, Export, update

My intention was to suggest this to Sandro after the first release of
RasterLite2
- but since this has been delayed, I am working on this now and will summit
the concept when completed
  (So Sandro has no idea about this concept of adding the 'poor cousin'
geotaged images to RasterLite2)

As for the importing of external 'RAW' files
- at the moment the idea was to support the exiftool-json format
-- so that when a non-geotaged image was found, but a exiftool-json
existed, that would be used
    (just as is done with a tif with a world file)
So adding a reading support for these RAW-files using the same logic would
be practicable

The present documentation is based on the code of 2 years ago, but will be
updated when the integration has been completed.

Thank you very much. Will this be Spatialite only, or you think of
extending it to Geopackage too?
All the best.

The intention is building this in to the RasterLite2 Library parallel to
(and not interfering with) the present Raster/Vector-Coverage logic and
utilizing the functionality that exist there already
- for the creation of a Geotagged Hierarchical Photo-Album

This would probably not fit into the Geopackage specification, which is
similar in the area of Vectors, but for Rasters is Tile based.

Since RasterLite2 is a Spatialite based system, adapting everything to work
also to the Geopackage specification had not occurred to me.

Will it easily be possible to extract such a photo from the spatialite file?

Thinking about QField (mobile application), I like the in-database
approach for its portability but fear that the photos will be locked in
there and that it will be quite hard to use them for a report written in
an application that does not support RasterLite2.

Hi devs,

the recently function to create customized menus and buttons for the

I'm just wondering if there is some way to share the script with ohter 
people so that even on their computer the same buttons or menu appears 
in the GUI.

Is there already a way to do that?

While developing the concept, the idea was to create a general Album-logic

Here the CREATE statement for a table containing the images of one Album:

CREATE TABLE "Alt_Berlin_album_data"

 num_bands INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
 compression TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NONE',
 nodata_pixel DOUBLE NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0,

 bearing DOUBLE  DEFAULT 0.0,
 image BLOB,
 image_thumbnail BLOB,
 exif_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
 , "album_geom" MULTIPOINT)

If an sqlite3 driver inserted a record, leaving the geometry field(s) NULL
- the spatialite logic would simply create the geometries either from
-- the extent_min* for GPS
-- the extent_max* for GPS_DEST
or by reading the image when it contains Exif-Gps Information

The goal was to make it useable for all
- with an extra for GIS aware software

--

Here the CREATE statement for the administration table
- the extents are calculated during an INSERT/UPDATE with spatialite, but
the result is readable by any sqlite3 driver
-- again the geometries would only useful for spatialite aware software

CREATE TABLE "album_coverages"
(
 id_album INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
 id_parent INTEGER DEFAULT 0 ,
 album_name TEXT NOT NULL,

Thanks Alex for the quick reply..

is there any plan to have this feature in future?

Should I open a feature request?

Thanks again!

Hello!

I see the storing of pictures inside the database as problematic - due 
to the pure file size to be expected, especially if it also possible to 
store RAW-files: Just an example from my own work (ecological study):
In a project I have 16 plots studying the development of vegetation, 
working there for three years, just if I make 5 photos per year (which 
is almost nothing), we end up with 16 * 3 * 5 = 240 pics. I own an 
Olympus E1, so a relatively old camera with "just" 5 Megapixel, the 
RAW-file has 10.2 MB, so that would be around 2.5 GB of Data overall in 
this theoretical case. Small project, old camera, meaning relatively 
small resolution...
Even if we take just the jpg (for me and my camera, most of the time 
something between 0.5 - 1.2 MB) still around 200 MB... so specially for 
mobile devices or portability between devices not ideal I'd say... Maybe 
storing just a thumbnail and defining a root-directory were the pictures 
are would be an option?

I hope, not being a developer, my thoughts are not taken as an offense! 
The features discussed are great and I would be very pleased if they are 
implemented, but storing big binary data in a database could be 
problematic, as I said...

Thank you all for your efforts!
Greetings,
Albin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changes to vector layers persist between python
	integration tests.
Message-ID: <9BEAE41C5F3C764E84B78481B4AC2D7EB74DF5@STGV-BUS01.thinkwhere.local>

Hi,

I am having trouble with integration tests that I am writing in a Python plugin.  The tests run correctly one at a time, but when I run them together only the first test works correctly.  It seems that changes it makes to the database are still present in the later tests.  How can I make sure that the vector layer / database is fully reset between tests?

My tests are based on unittest.TestCase.  The QGIS app is started with QGISAPP.initQGIS() as in the main QGIS tests and a Mock iface is used.

In the setUp, I make a temporary copy of a template spatialite file and run an SQL script on it to add features and other data.  I connect to the database and store a reference to it (self.db).  Then I load one of the tables as a QgsVectorLayer and store a reference to it (self.esu).

The first test uses self.esu.dataProvider().deleteFeatures() to remove features, the second uses self.esu.dataProvider().addFeatures() to add features.  They check that the features have been added and that other database changes have been made.

The teardown contains the following:

        if self.db:  # Just in case self.db doesn't get set
            self.db.close()
            del self.db
            QSqlDatabase.removeDatabase('integration_testing')

        self.esu = None
        reg = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance()
        reg.removeAllMapLayers()
        reg.clearAllLayerCaches()

        if os.path.exists(self.test_db_path):
            os.remove(self.test_db_path)

I thought that this would be enough to reset any references to the vector layer, but if I delete a feature in the first test, it is still gone when I run the second test.  Is QGIS holding any other references to the layers that I have missed?

Cheers
John

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6tvNH=QcNP6WkWy07YmsMhMW-SQfMq4+JN81+2-Vf7rA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am a bit curious about performances concerning the use of Spatial
expressions in QGIS, for example to select features like this

 intersects(
    $geometry,
    geom_from_wkt( 'MultiPolygon (((649308.28000000002793968
6978002.05999999959021807, 649295.32999999995809048
6977994.54999999981373549, 649235.92000000004190952
6978013.50999999977648258, 649182.53000000002793968
6978077.32000000029802322, 649212.34999999997671694
6978159.53000000026077032,  649308.28000000002793968
6978002.05999999959021807)))')
)

NB: I have simplified the WKT representation here

I am running this expression inside QGIS 2.14, for a layer containing
approx. 100 000 features ( buildings).
The WKT polygon represents a very small area compared to the whole layer:
500 features only are selected.

It seems to me no spatial index is used, because it takes some time to run
~ 3 minutes.

I have checked the option to run expressions server side, and all the
layers are PostGIS layers.

What could be done to improve this kind of expressions, which can be used
elsewhere in QGIS ( to toggle labels for example ) ?

Regards
Michaël

Hi Michaël,

There are a couple of possibilities to improve the performance of
operations in two ways (which both help here AFAICS)

 * Give QgsExpression::prepare() more power
 * Compile functions (where possible)

The send one depends to some degree on the first one.

Let me know if you have sponsors, I've got some experimental code
somewhere and I am very interested in working on this project.

FYI, a first test - only the prepare part - some months ago improved the
2.5D rendering by ~30%.

Matthias

Hello all

What attribution is required when using the data at
http://qgis.org/downloads/data/? I've just done a whole load of screenshots
of maps using that data, so I'd like to acknowledge it if appropriate.

Thanks

Tom

Agreed, seems a good idea, maybe better better idea than adding during
installation. A whole bunch of other resources couold be reachable in
the same way, e.g. the Gentle introduction, etc.).
All the best.

Hi Matthias,

Thanks a lot for your answer. Unfortunately, I have no sponsors for this. I
asked to improve my knowledge on this topic ;)
Perhaps we could raise a crowdfunding for this improvement ?

Cheers,
Michaël

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Changelog for 2.16
Message-ID: <D85706BE-F5A4-4E07-A2C6-940FF136467F@qgis.org>

Hi All

Could I ask anyone who has worked on new features (or who can help with documenting new features, taking screenshots etc) to take a little time to update any entries you can help with here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/ <http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/>

Note that you can now upload animated GIF's - it would be really helpful to use those where possible if they help to make new features more obvious. If you do not have the needed credentials to edit yourself, either sign up directly (you can authenticate with github now too) and let me know so that I can give you the needed permissions, or send me an email with your proposed changes.

Thank you very much to everyone who has already pitched in - its a massive amount of new stuff coming in 2.16 so we really appreciate your help in documenting everything!

Again please do not publicise this changelog until the release & changelog are ready.

Thanks

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <CAGZtxQyitRTxLr+yVzQ1cjXMvQZgTAQfJpJFE3Cvh71h06Sfhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

In order to test a bug-fix on Windows, I thought the easiest way for a
build would be to use the nightly packaging script to create an
installable build.

Well, it submits a report to orfeo-toolbox and apparently this is not
password-protected or anything like that.

So now I have accidentally submitted a "wrong" report. Is this a
problem and if so, can anyone delete it?

Kind regards,

Daan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Visual changelog and animated gifs
Message-ID: <c5d0369317186d01d33c483216d484fc@carto.net>

Hi, 

There are now more animated gifs in the visual changelog
(http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/). While I agree that
the animations are quite useful, I think they should only start playing
if the user klicks on it or hovers the mouse over it. Otherwise it looks
really horrible if there are too many animations going on on the same
page. 

There are javascript libraries available for this, e.g. freezeframe:
https://github.com/ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js/ 

I know, it is not super urgent, but it would greatly enhance usability -
maybe for 3.0. 

Webpages with too many animations let me freak out. It distracts from
the content the user is focusing on. 

Any other opinions on this? 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

I agree, I'm glad we're no longer in the 90's where people started to
realize that web content does not have to be static :)

Yup I agree - started to notice the same thing after I added the first couple. I will go the freeze frame route because IMHO it is very useful to see the animation if someone wants to figure out how to use the new feature.

As always please file issues at in the changelog tracker and we will happily implement good ideas...

Hi Tim, 

Can you please share what a recommended screen-recording tool would be
that can record a session to an animated gif? Or would I first create
another format and then convert to animated gif? 

So far, I did only static screenshots and overlayed them in Inkscape, so
I am new to this ... 

Thanks, 

Andreas

See Matthias's entry "New configuration options for attribute table" - I have added a small example there. It would be great if you could use your favourite gif tool to make little animations of new features. If you need any help getting logged in / entry creation permissions, please pop me a note.

Note that the 'final destination' of the Visual Changelog is not so much
the tracker, as it is the website. So probably it will end up at a page
like:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog214/index.html

of which the sources are here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/tree/master/source/site/forusers/visualchangelog214

No use to update the tracker I think?

We could off course add libraries to the website templates, but I would
prefer to add only animated gif's to changes if they are REALLY
benefitting what you want to show....

But as said: IF those are really needed please find a small library (or
just a few lines of javascript) which is safe to add to the javascripts
in the website.

Regards,

Richard

I meant to say above that if you need the changelog authoring site to do something different, it is better to file a ticket there (https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues). That could also cover issues relating to how the RST export is managed.

OK, I'll put more static images and less GIF's. We could also make the RST exporter just export static images from the GIF's - only thing then is that we need to be sure a relevant frame is used for the snapshot. For now lets bias ourselves towards static images and for the next release cycle we can figure out a 'best of both worlds' approach...

Ok thanks lets keep that as an option too for the few GIF's we do include.

Could it be a locking issue? Shouldn't you set self.esu to None *before* you
del self.db, and then finally os.remove(self.test_db_path)?

Clutching at straws...

Hi all,

I had a quick look at the download R script tool in Processing and I
noticed that some scripts that are in the gh repo (and merged months
ago) are not available for the download..

Is there something wrong or am I missing something?

Hi

Just for follow up, I added a bit of freeze logic to stop the GIFs. Its deployed on the live site...hope that makes things better?

If I'm correct you can add a directive to an image in rst, so they will
get certain (css-) classes in html output...

Have to dive into this:

http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#images-and-figures

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html

figclass : text
Set a "classes" attribute value on the figure element. See the class
directive below.

Could work, will see when we cross there

Ok great thanks Richard - and we can tweak it on our side too if needed to support that..

Hi,

We (titellus and camptocamp) are going to start working on adding a few
functionalities needed for INSPIRE to QGIS core.  Before starting, we’d
like to tell the community what we plan to do (maybe, some are optional)
and give a chance to everybody to comment.


   -

   Advanced attribute types support
   -

      Add support for viewing/editing maps (key/value) and arrays
      -

         Usage of native type for postgis
         -

         Usage of string representation for sqlite (for example JSON)
         -

      Add a few expression functions for accessing those types:
      array_get(idx), array_length, array_join(separator) / dict_get(key), etc
      -

      Add a few function to search in those types: array_search(),
      dict_search()
      -

      Detect a date column and use the proper widget for editing those
      -

      Same for other types
      -

      Allow plugins to provide custom widgets for specific types
      automatically.
      -

   Fix bug where null dates are shown as the current time instead of null
   in forms and saved like that, even for features that are not modified
   -

   Custom types widgets, per type
   -

   Auto discover database joins:
   -

      Add FK (Foreign Key) discovery to the postgis and spatialite specific
      code.
      -

      Improve QGIS when creating relations according to the FK in the DB:
      view existing relations in the DB and select those to add
automatically to
      the project.
      -

      Improve QGIS when creating joins in layers according to the FK in the
      DB: view existing relations with the current layer and select
those to add
      automatically.


If somebody is already working on one of those features or is having
recommendations/comments/questions, please tell us.

Is there any point that would require a QEP?

Thanks

Hi Patrick,

just a note, that I hope that there is also work (funds) spend on OGR
maybe to make GeoPackage driver work (even) better in QGIS?

because I see a lot of european 'national' organisations opt (sometimes
via a loop via esri) for fgdb's as exchange format here and there ....

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

There will be definitely a significant amount of work to do in OGR in that 
context to be able to read (and write) complex GML files such as found in 
Inspire datasets in a "lossless way", ie dealing with arbitrary nesting of 
elements based on the .xsd schemas and exposing them through relational tables 
when needed.

GeoPackage work isn't in the scope though.

Hi,

Good to know you will start this work.

What do you mean by "Custom types widgets, per type" ?

For those interested, we've been working on a QGIS plugin to import
Complex Features XML in QGIS in a similar way (but using a pure python
approach to convert from XSD to a relational model).
See http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/gml_application_schema_toolbox/

Great to hear this - it's been on my wishlist for a while! Can you
please file a QEP about this specific change, as I'd like to hear the
implementation you have planned and have some related ideas which may
help.

As much as possible, can we follow the postgres naming/usage for array
handling functions?

Also on this note - at this stage of QGIS development I'd expect
(actually, scratch that - it's a *requirement*!!) that adding a new
supported field type would be absolutely soaked in unit tests,
including thorough testing for each provider which handling of these
data types are added to. Make sure you factor that into your proposal

Nice - this is annoying. Ping me if you have questions, as again I've
got a few ideas on how this can be fixed.

In QGIS 2.16 there will be support for redlining which may do some of what you are after.

Message-ID: <CA+Bj0=rreinGLC_z7AAi8SSJw6zLAbRWsa_bsk4mZyzVKTCHYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm looking forward to the next wonderful release, and now testing
TileLayerPlugin with qgis-dev (OSGeo4W64), I sometimes encounter the
following error message while loading a project with a plugin layer.

NotImplementedError: QgsPluginLayer.writeStyle() is abstract and must
be overridden

According to the API doc [1], QgsMapLayer.writeStyle() has been added
in 2.16 and is reimplemented in QgsVectorLayer and QgsRasterLayer, but
does not seem to be reimplemented in QgsPluginLayer.

Can QGIS core avoid raising this error? Or should all the subclasses
of QgsPluginLayer override writeStyle()?

[1] https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapLayer.html

Minoru

Hi,

What is the version you are running.  I think that was patched by Martin at
one stage.

Hi Nathan and devs,

I've updated my installation (to cdf82a2), and the error has gone away. Great!


Many thanks,

Hi Tim, 

Nathan also recommended me LICEcap. It is easy to use and works well.
The only drawback is that sometimes it creates white artefacts when you
move the mouse (see f.e.
http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/4ac86473163c0b1e322343de1e4013262c2492ce.gif
or
http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/f8297ba9ee600c3d41114db96f56b00bb278ba4e.gif)
- not a big issue. Only minor annoyance. 

Thanks - btw - for the "Click to play" buttons. It is much better now!

The only drawback is that sometimes it creates white artefacts when you move the mouse (see f.e. http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/4ac86473163c0b1e322343de1e4013262c2492ce.gif <http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/4ac86473163c0b1e322343de1e4013262c2492ce.gif> or http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/f8297ba9ee600c3d41114db96f56b00bb278ba4e.gif <http://changelog.qgis.org/media/images/entries/f8297ba9ee600c3d41114db96f56b00bb278ba4e.gif>) - not a big issue.

Yes I saw those too but didn't spend any time trying to resolve them as they don't detract too much from the information being imparted I think.

Hello!

I'm the author of viewshed analysis plugin for QGIS (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ViewshedAnalysis/). I have recently
submitted the software to the fresh "Journal of open source software"
http://joss.theoj.org/  - but which is in pain to find a reviewer. Would
there be anyone interested ? (thread with comments :
https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/32,
<https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/32>paper :

<http://joss.theoj.org/papers/a8f76eeda4f92e7d641757dd0d7ed7f5>

The journal is "developer friendly" meaning that we publish the software
(with accompanying documentation), not a case study, algorithms,
performance testing, or what not.

Thanks community,

Thanks a lot : that was quick!

Yes, I would be glad to have a reviewer. I think the best would be that you
just announce at the comments thread :
https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/32 (you need a github
account..).

You can write to me, or you can just post comments over github - as with
other submissions.

Best regards,
Zoran

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to detect a categorized/graduated 2.5D layer
	in Python
Message-ID: <1467879137789-5275092.post@n6.nabble.com>

So you can use a 2.5D renderer, then change to eg categorized or graduated,
and the stack of geometry generators (shadow, walls, roof) remains in place.
I have to detect these latter types of renderers in Python. I do so by
looking for that signature stack of symbol layers. This works.

However, I loop through every feature in a layer when doing this check, my
vague thought being that some features might have different symbology, but
that others might still be derived from 2.5D. The problem I have is that
this slows things down to a crawl, with multiple layers and many features.

Therefore:

1. Is it overkill to loop through all features - should I just check the
first feature in each layer?

2. Does anyone have a more efficient way of detecting these "derived from
2.5D" renderers?

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <CAGZtxQxzzx3fMniS7Uo86TtFAHoox5-xh1kA2ASOgBhogZhknw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm not sure if this warrants a complete bug-report and/or PR thing,
but the current version of the release-2_14 branch crashes when you
right-click on a data layer. I think it is quite essential that this
is fixed before 2.14.4.

The following commit fixes this in master and should probably be back-ported:

054604b fix crash when right-clicking on geometryless layers

Kind regards,
Daan.

Or directly the symbols defined on the layer?
You could implemente the logic for graudated and rule based and if this
fails fallback to the current approach.

The other thing I can think of is taking the layer variables as hint but
that's really brittle.

Message-ID: <DB5PR08MB08087E35C9F3A6397828C658A73B0@DB5PR08MB0808.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Hi, I'm trying to print a map using pyqgis and an existing template:

# i already loaded a layer and zoomed to the layer:

qgis.utils.iface.zoomToActiveLayer()

# now i need to zoom to a "precise" scale
canvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
canvas.zoomScale(2500) # this works for the canvas not in the composer

# load the template
template_file = file(template_path)
template_content = template_file.read()
template_file.close()
document = QDomDocument()
document.setContent(template_content)
composition = QgsComposition(canvas.mapSettings())
composition.loadFromTemplate(document)
map_item = composition.getComposerItemById('map')
map_item.setMapCanvas(canvas)

# at this point i need to set the extent to fit the layer
map_item.zoomToExtent(canvas.extent()) # this will not be in scale 2500 
of course

now i need the scale to be say 2500 but i cannot find how to
set the value

thanks for any help, Roy

What do you mean? Can you retrieve all symbols used by a layer without
iterating through all the features? In the 2.5D renderer, if height is set
by an expression, and hence all features have different values, how many
symbols does this count as?

Thanks

Tom

I thought maybe it would be worth checking

    layer.rendererV2()

and then

for categorized iterate

    renderer.categories()

for graduated traverse

    renderer.rootRule()

for simple

    renderer.symbol()

and for the rest fallback to some generic code (or bail out).

As long as you are only interested in the definition and not in real,
calculated height values that should do I guess.

Well, sure I need to contact them, to have assistance about how to install
OpenCV (and others) python library.  Perhaps, you know this ?  I am
following infos in
.qgis2\python\plugins\sensum_eo_tools\QGIS Plugin - Installation Guide.txt

 but it reports  (amd64)  and   OSGeo4W64, and I have  standalone QGIS...

BTW, I will report you my results.

Great. I'll do something like that, perhaps preceded by "if QGIS version <
2.14, it's not 2.5D".

Thanks

We might be talking about different things. I have used that data for
instructional screenshots at https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/wiki.
I'd like to acknowledge the data if appropriate, and was wondering if there
was accepted attribution text for that dataset.

Depending on how you build the checks you can even skip the version test.

I.e. if somebody manages to put a GeometryGenerator into an older
project he has at least earned wizard-status.
And you wouldn't want to prevent a wizard from doing his job, would you?

if  they are in the repo, they should be available, sice Processing
connects directly to it

Maybe version numbers are wrong?

I just thought a version check would be even more efficient than the other
methods, so it would be good to try it first. If the user is in fact a
wizard, there's always `import antigravity`.

Hi All

Especially newer contributors - have you added yourself to our contributors map and lists? With 12 hours left to go before QGIS 2.16 gets branched, its not too late to get yourself in there!

* doc/contributors.json : a geojson doc with a list of anyone who has ever made a code / documentation or similar contribution to QGIS. Nice map view of this here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/contributors.json

* doc/CONTRIBUTORS : an alphabetical list of anyone who has ever materially contributed to the QGIS project

* doc/AUTHORS : a list of all people with Git commit rights (or who historically had in the past)


Have fun!

Regards

Tim

Hi Victor,

I have a direct link from the QGIS repo and the Processing plugin, so I
use always the last version of Processing.

A few weeks ago some scripts have been added to the Processing Repo..
but I cannot see them from the online collection..

Am I missing something?

Thanks Victor!

Matteo

Change of plans, I'll be there the Sunday before the conference, and due to

a place to start hacking)

	table-provider?
Message-ID: <e72c8ead-fca6-e128-ac9b-b6d44ce52876@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Raymond Nijssen had an (I think) intriguing idea:

QGIS can open different types of table-data: dbf, excel etc etc

But if the excel contains an x,y,wkt column, you have to save it to
csv/tsv first, to be able to use the delimited-text-provider to open it
as a layer.

His idea: can't we use the delimited-text-provider for all tables that
are open in QGIS immediately?

Had a look into the code

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/delimitedtext/qgsdelimitedtextfile.cpp#L583

which 'just' looks like a QTextStream:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/delimitedtext/qgsdelimitedtextfile.h#L352

And according to this:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/63310/how-to-save-a-treeview-as-csv-file-in-qt

It is easy to create a textstream from QModel (in which we have the data
I think???)...

So Question:
- (to devs): would this indeed be doable/easy?
- (to UI's): should the Delimited Text File dialog be updated then (or
only with a 'open excisting table button'?
- should we rename the provider to 'table' provider.

Comments/Opinions?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Agreed. There is a plugin doing this, but of course having it as a standard function is desirable.
Thanks for raising this.

Great idea! ;)

Question is where to implement it in the GUI. It overlaps the
functionality in the delimited text reader. Like pointing to the x and y
columns or choosing a column containing wkt.

Maybe it could be a 2 steps process? Step 1 is importing any table and
step 2 is creating a spatial layer from it. But we would loose the quick
"Add delimited text layer" functionality.

Any ideas?

@Paolo, which plugin can do this? XyTools?

Regards,
Raymond

Hi,

I think there are already 2 possibilities to show x,y /wkt or other
geometries for any kind of layers

 * Geometry generators

 * Virtual layers (no expert, but I guess that's possible)

So at least read-only this should be straightforward, read-write maybe
with virtual layers (?).

I'm just after some clarification on the status of master. Are we unfrozen
now?

(I realise the 2.x branch hasn't been created yet, so I'm guessing no API
breaks for now)

On that note, do you think we should now make a .qgis3 folder in home
driver to not mess with 2.x installs?

Sounds like a good plan. Or .qgis-master.

Hi,
cannot remember its name. Searched for it, but I couldn't find it - yes,
we obviously have to improve our tagging system :)
Perhaps the author is listening here?
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjyxwPMXvpvT10xLUiOcU9c8A8mOtFhJ4JKpjFRx74hWQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to raise an idea for discussion: should we *require* that all
3.0 API breaks are introduced via a PR?

Advantages I'd see are:
1. wider discussion about the nicest way the new/modified API could work
2. allows for discussion about whether the documentation for the API
break is sufficient for plugin developers

Disadvantages:
1. More work
2. Given that there's going to be a lot of breaks, it could slow
development down.

I'm a +0 on this.

I am in favor of this.

Sometimes it's nice to change some things and get other opinions.
Leaving it open for a few days should be enough to give it visibility.

Speaking of which... How are we documenting API changes?
Doxygen, website or documentation?

I thought we decided on doxygen?

Thanks - I haven't had a chance to try it out yet - when I do I will write back to you with my notes if I haven't heard from you yet!

Hi Tom

I think the data is public domain (referencing the Alaska dataset in particular). Perhaps it is enough for now to say, data can be freely obtained from http://qgis.org/downloads/data...

@paolo: which plugin are you thinking of?
Because for exampe xytools can open odt and excel, but via python, while
the idea here is to be able to load whatever (table) format ogr is able
to load. And not only given and x,y field but also a column containing
wkt polygons (as the csv-provider does that already)...
This would for example also work for a dbf containg x,y values

@mattias: mm, if I load a strict csv table (be it csv or excel),
containing an x and y column, according to this blogpost:
http://www.opengis.ch/2015/12/10/geometry-generator-symbology/
I should be able to select a geometry generator in styles.. but with a
table the styles is ... empty :-(

Tried to make a geometry using vectorcalc, but it will not 'morph' the
layer from a table (icon) in a geometry/point icon and the points (I
tried: make_point)

I am aware that this is probably readonly, but that is ok I think.

Regards,

Richard

I'm in favour of a different folder too, makes it also easier to test
python plugins in parallel...

I would go for .qgis3 :-)

But no strong feelings about it, it's just I'm a little conservative and
gong from .qgis to .qgis2 to.... qgis-master seems unnatural ;-)

Richard

If I may, I think .qgis3 would be better than .qgis-master, otherwise we
will have to change it again once qgis 3.0 becomes stable.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Report 7 - QGIS Symbology Sharing Tools
Message-ID: <CAOnR-iKFDpUVt_RShMUudajyRp1DY2FqvL5YL8MAYXn6UTWm9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is the report for the 7th week of my GSoC project

*What did you get done this week?*

   - Implemented resources handler (base class and the SVG handler). This
   classes are responsible to import resources in to QGIS.
   - Did some refactoring
   - Set up documentation here: www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_symbology_sharing

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - FIx some issues (#8
   <https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing/issues/8>, #9
   <https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_symbology_sharing/issues/9>) and
   minor stuffs (filter collections to only show collections compatible with
   user's QGIS version)
   - Step back and think again about the approach to import resources in to
   QGIS since I think the current approach won't work if we want all the
   resources in the collection to link correctly before and after
   installation. Before installation is when user prepares the collection
   (SVG, styles, and symbols) before pushing to the repository. After
   installation is when users install the collection through the plugin after
   the author shares the collection.

*Are you blocked on anything?*
I am blocked on:

   - How to import symbol and colorramp in to QGIS (was thinking to create
   a group for a collection, a child group for each xml file in a collection,
   and put all the symbols and colorramps in the child group in Style
   Manager). But the name of the symbol must be unique no matter what the
   group is (This is set as the constraint of the symbology-ng-style.db
   - Haven't figured out a way for the resources to link each other
   correctl (2nd point for what I will do next week). The problem is, when
   user sets up a collection (put SVG, create symbols and styles for that
   SVGs, and push to the repository), the symbols/styles that use that SVGs
   might use absolute path. If it's possible, I need to make it use relative
   path and ensure that before and after installation, the relative path works.

There is also a bug I believe in the QGIS for importing symbols and
colorramps from the xml file and directly save in the group (it doesn't add
the imported symbols/colorramps to the group).

Other things in Style Manager that is not intuitive right now:

   - Deleting a parent group doesn't delete child group(s)
   - Selecting a parent group doesn't show all the items from the child
   group(s)

Cheers

+1 for .qgis3 

I am assuming that .qgis4 will again have API breaks, which would
justify for separate folders again.

The advantage of a .dev folder would be that once a stable .qgis3 is
released, everybody who developed or tested before would start with a
clean setup for production work. Without any leftovers from leftovers
from early development versions which were almost equal to qgis 2 or
from temporarily added functionality which got removed again in the same
development cycle.

Hi, 

I would welcome an "easier" way to open Point or WKT data from formats
that do not store geometries natively, as you propose. Thanks for
bringing it to the table, Raymond and Richard! 

My suggestion would be to enhance the existing OGR "Add vector layer"
dialog with an option to choose columns to be used for geometry
creation. This way we don't have to "misuse" the delimited text layer
loader for other formats and the user could open the data all in one
step, without the need for postprocessing. OGR VRT provides all we need
to create geometries from columns - see http://www.gdal.org/drv_vrt.html


The drawback is that it would work only for OGR formats, not for all the
other databases. But I would assume that people using databases are
skilled enough to be able to use QGIS virtual layers, views, etc. to
build geometries from their databases. 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi All

Intriguing idea.

I would be reluctant to have the DL provider any more cumbersome as it serves very well for very quick visualisation of data exported by other programs/scripts.

OTOH the dialog for creating delimited text layers is very clumsy - it has a lot to do in one screen and still doesn't do everything we might want (eg selecting CRS).   The dialog does split very naturally into two parts, one defining the data source (ie filename, encoding, delimiters, headers, etc), and the second half defining the mapping of columns to geometry definition.  One option might be to more explicitly break it up, putting the geometry definition into a separate widget, which could be either be included in current window or placed in something more like a tabbed dialog or wizard type dialog (whatever fits best in QGIS).  With a bit of care the geometry definition widget and functions (eg testing data source for candidate geometry fields) could be encoded into a reusable widget that could be reused with other data sources.

Not sure how the implementation would go - it could be useful to implement as a virtual field, but how would this get encoded into URL and how would manual changes to field be managed.

Anyway, certainly an idea worth considering!

Cheers
Chris

The drawback is that it would work only for OGR formats, not for all the other databases. But I would assume that people using databases are skilled enough to be able to use QGIS virtual layers, views, etc. to build geometries from their databases.

Hi Devs,

Raymond Nijssen had an (I think) intriguing idea:

QGIS can open different types of table-data: dbf, excel etc etc

But if the excel contains an x,y,wkt column, you have to save it to
csv/tsv first, to be able to use the delimited-text-provider to open it
as a layer.

His idea: can't we use the delimited-text-provider for all tables that
are open in QGIS immediately?

Had a look into the code

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/delimitedtext/qgsdelimitedtextfile.cpp#L583

which 'just' looks like a QTextStream:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/delimitedtext/qgsdelimitedtextfile.h#L352

And according to this:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/63310/how-to-save-a-treeview-as-csv-file-in-qt

It is easy to create a textstream from QModel (in which we have the data
I think???)...

So Question:
- (to devs): would this indeed be doable/easy?
- (to UI's): should the Delimited Text File dialog be updated then (or
only with a 'open excisting table button'?
- should we rename the provider to 'table' provider.

Comments/Opinions?

Fixing that should be possible.

Extending the CSV provider would result in rewriting a lot of driver
code which is already present in OGR.

I'd rather use one of the two methods

 * Geometry generators
 * Virtual layer

To build this functionality on top of any existing provider.

Hi Andreas,

I'd just like to see a way to create a new layer from any (attribute)
table in QGIS. So, even a point shapefile containing a wkt column with
polygons or a database table containing x and y field or an opened xls
sheet containing json somewhere.

My suggestion:

- To strip the geometry stuff from the CSV importer.
- Have a new tool to create a geometry layer from any QGIS table.

I think this would be easy to understand for users, although some would
need both tools to import a csv with geometry.

Regards,
Raymond

Hi,

still the only way i found to set the composer
map is using

zoomToExtent(canvas.extent())

but not able to set a custom defined scale,
any hint to find some documentation
or some way to set the composer scale using pyQGIS?
thanks again

Another thought .. why not use a plugin (which could emulate geometry component of DLT provider) to add geometry virtual fields to an existing layer?
Sounds really straightforward and would be available immediately and on older versions of QGIS.

It's probably easier to fix that with a shortcut / setup wizard... than
creating the code to loop everything through the delimited text provider.

I still wonder if (in the ideal world) the delimited text provider be
retired and all the extra features it has (wkt, regex, etc) ported over to
OGRs csv reader. Then the provider would become just a user friendly front
end for configuring the OGR data source. Benefits would be less code for us
to maintain + write support, plus other projects could also take advantage
of these features.

Disadvantages? It'd take a bunch of work :p

Hi Patrick,

I did part of what you listed in my Plugin DataDrivenInputMask (Python), 
only available for PostGIS, though. Source code and documentation are on 
github.
The plugin provides suitable widgets for any supported data type (e.g. 
date, boolean, arrays types). You might also want to look at how NULL 
values are handled (if field has no NOT NULL constraint). Furthermore 
any relation type (1:1, 1:n, n:1 and n:m) is supported.

While I agree that the OGR-data dialogs could have a make-over, I think 
the point we want to make is missed in this way: create layer from 
whatever table is already loaded in QGIS (via whatever provider). 
Matthias is also right: you can probably do that via Generators (to be 
fixed first) or Virtual Layers... but I just tried and I could not 
easily figure out how to do this having loaded the an excel with the 
following columns:
name,x,y
a,0,0
b,10,10
c,20,20
d,30,30
Off course making the ui for this more user-friendly is maybe the best 
option.

Doing this via a plugin like Chris proposes is also possible but to us 
that looks like reimplementing the TD-gui again....

Richard

Hi,

for some reason my email client did not download
or received the answer to my question, sent by "boesiii",
that i find righ now browsing the mailing list archive.

So, using

map_item.setNewScale(canvas.scale())


i can surely set the scale for the map composer

thank you Boesiii

and sorry to the list for my second
message.

Hi, 

There are probably two different issues/use cases here: 

1. Enabling geometries for already loaded layers (what Richard and
Raymond initially suggested) 

2. Loading geometryless layers through OGR (or other providers) with the
option to define geometry columns. Ideally this could all be done in one
step - without having to first load the layer geometryless and then
having to do option 1) above as a separate step. 

The UI implications are different for the two cases. 2) should go
directly into the OGR loading dialogue, 1) perhaps in the layer
properties or maybe in addition in the attribute table.

Just a small note:

Travis tests for OSX are re-enabled with new dependencies.

Thanks a lot Larry for maintaining the homebrew side of things. It is
really highly appreciated and a job (like all packaging) that often
doesn't get noticed.

I had to disable some tests:

 * PyQgsOfflineEditingWFS (Alessandro, maybe the server doesn't work,
any idea?)
 * Grass7 Tests (Médéric, any idea from your side?)

Thanks. I delved a bit more, and it looks as though VMap0 is public domain,
so I've attributed thus:

Alaska vector data derived from  VMap0
<http://earth-info.nga.mil/publications/vmap0.html>   by  GIS-Lab
<http://gis-lab.info/qa/vmap0-eng.html>  

Hopefully that is good enough, until someone tells me otherwise.

Thanks

Tom

I need to detect whether a QGIS WMS layer is from QGIS Server, rather than
another WMS server:

What's my best method? Search for "qgis_mapserv" in the layer's URL? 
Something else?

Hi,

Just a quick note for python plugin devs.

I received an error report related to QGis.QGIS_VERSION constant [1].
In QGIS 2.16, QGis.GIS_RELEASE_NAME and QGis.QGIS_VERSION constants
have been changed to unicode type. I guess that the change is
necessary for unicode release name support.

With QGIS 2.16, encoding GIS_RELEASE_NAME/QGIS_VERSION with no
explicit character code specified causes UnicodeEncodeError (try
`str(QGis.QGIS_VERSION)`) and a few plugins seem to be affected (e.g.
profiletool, numericalVertexEdit, etc).

Message-ID: <1A7140E8-7E6E-4525-901B-C331F64DFF02@qgis.org>

Dear QGIS Lovers

Bonn is drawing close and we need to start getting organised for the hackfest.

Paolo has been petitioning to shut down the current wiki in anticipation of a future migration off Redmine and because the content there is not maintained. Thus for this hackfest I have started the wiki page on the QGIS GitHub wiki here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Hackfest---Bonn---August-2016


It is just a stub at the moment - I hope collaboratively we can get things organised. We really need a local organiser who can make sure everything is in place - are there any volunteers out there?

If you are not able to write to the wiki page, please contact me with your github name and I will see to it that you have the needed permissions.

Note that there are two FOSS4G2016 conference hacking sprints during Bonn - our plan was to make the first (Aug 21-23 2016) the 'official' QGIS one and if others wish to hack during the weekend after FOSS4G, you are welcome to do so.

@Astrid could you give us some help in terms of accommodation and hacking venue? I believe the camper van place is already full - can you recommend some other nearby and cheap places to stay?

Regards

Tim

That's not robust, with a rewrite you can easily hide/alter that path.

I suggest you to rely on a WMS getProjectSettings call.

AFAIK that call is unique to QGIS Server.

Hi Minoru,

this is probably done to handle 'Nødebo' name for 2.16...

though you could say it is a api-change... I think easiest is to fix it
in plugins? Which (while Python2) should maybe move all str() calls to
unicode() ones?

Not sure there is an easier solution now after 2.16.0 ....?

Regards,

Richard

I don't think the type has changed. Before python just converted it
silently because the conversion of a pure ascii unicode string was trivial.
Compare:

>>> str(u'Essen')
'Essen'
>>> str(u'Nødebo')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf8' in
position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

As a general rule of thumb: don't cast to other types if there is no
requirement, that will help to prevent such issues and make the upcoming
upgrade to python 3 much easier.

Yes, this should be Python 2.xx's developer haiku: *Bytes on the outside,
unicode on the inside. Encode/decode at the edges. *It's a bad habit in
Python 2.xx to cast to str when the string probably could contain accented
chars (e.g doing *str(layer.source()*). But in Python 3, str is unicode,
most of problem would probably be gone. For some strategies, perhaps what
we did in InaSAFE could be useful, see the 3rd comment in this PR:
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/pull/1674

What operating system/distribution are you using? Where did you install
the package from?

Unicode type release name (str type in python 3) must be compatible
with the saying.

Fixing the error would be easy for the relevant python devs. But if
the change was introduced in 3.0 (`type(QGis.QGIS_RELEASE_NAME)` gives
me `<type 'str'>` in QGIS 2.14. Not sure that it was technically
possible to keep str type for the constants), QGIS 2.16 users didn't
have to wait for the relevant plugin devs to release a modified
version.

Thanks,
Minoru

Thanks - I'll try it. What do I detect in the response to know it's QGIS
Server? In fact, does someone have a publicly accessible QGIS Server I can
issue that request to?

Thanks

I think that you could check that the server does not return an exception.

If REQUEST=GetProjectSettings does not return an exception it means that
it's QGIS.


Example:
QGIS:
http://demo.qgis.org/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/web/demos/south_perth/project.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings

Not QGIS:
http://demo.mapserver.org/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/osgeo/mapserver/msautotest/world/world.map&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetProjectSettings

I propose a new Olympic sport for athletes open source programmers: the
tracking of changes in the python code to get the new versions of QGIS.
The winner is who stays behind.

You have my deepest sympathy.

Hello,

Hi Marco,

on Ubuntu 16.04 and no ubuntugis. Same here..

But, after a second and a third attempt the core dump disappeared..

Another problem I'm experiencing is with all the plugins that use
QtWebKit; by activating them, I get a segmentation fault..

Cheers

Matteo

Matthias/we pinned it down to probably a race condition when running
make in 1 thread (not using -j4 or so), AND therefor not having a
__init_.py in qgis dir...

Matthias did a fix, I've just tested and seems to work:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/ae3db0a1bf9504b432e4553b94a56051576c053f

(and cherry picked to other branches)

Note: only if you run make without a -j4 option in a clean build/output
directory you hit this on,
else __init__.py is just available...

Regards,

Richard

Looks like it's compiled with -DWITH_QTWEBKIT=OFF
I don't think that should be required on Ubuntu...
But it shouldn't crash anyway, which plugin?

This problem remains now that 2.16 has been released:

Can anyone help fix this error?

Hi,
menu Settings --> Customize is supposed to help you remove icons from QGIS
interface. That said, I don't know if these buttons are available in the
list nor if there's an easier way to find them (except source code). There
are some issues reports with this dialog  at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues (category== customisation
framework)

Hi devs

Trying to report issue at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues/new, in the Target version
option, releases that are proposed are not only QGIS's. I have options from
plugins like BLN Exporter, Transectizer, QMarxan...
This might be a bug, I suppose.
Given that I don't know to whom I should report this....

Thanks,
Harrissou

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding symbols through API needs QGIS restarts to
	show up
Message-ID: <CAOnR-iLbJf5WMfM_KV5kTpi9khJtXMq4uYxTXDsWE=vwyiArEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to add symbols/colorramps through Python API and I have a
problem that after adding symbol/colorramps, the added symbols/colorramps
don't show up in Style Manager right away. The symbols are added in the
symbology-ng-style.db, but the added symbols show up once I restart QGIS

This is more or less the code:

style_manager = QgsStyleV2()
> style_manager.load(QgsApplication.userStyleV2Path())
> # Adding symbols here
> style_manager.addSymbol(symbol_name, symbol, True)
> # Perhaps this works, load the db again
> style_manager.load(QgsApplication.userStyleV2Path())


Is there something in the API that I could call to trigger the dialog to
show up the changes after adding the symbols?

Try this instead:

style = QgsStyleV2.defaultStyle()
style.addSymbol("ABC", my_symbol)

The default style is the one loaded on start and used throughout QGIS
application, so if you modify it, the changes will be immediately
visible in the GUI and will be saved automatically.

Hi Martin,

Thanks, seems to work. I read a bit the cpp code in Style Manager DIalog
that it will load the default style when showing up the dialog. So I
thought once it's written correctly to the database, it will not have this
problem. Thanks for the explanation, it's clear now what the API's are
meant to do.

OK, Travis seems to be installing GDAL 1.10. Is that the issue? 

Get:60 http://us-central1.gce.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/universe
gdal-bin amd64 1.10.1+dfsg-5ubuntu1 [208 kB]

What version is 2.16 hoping for, specifically for calling warp via
processing? Am I right in presuming 2.x? If so, is there a PPA I can
specify? 

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsVectorLayer's attributeValueChanged SIGNAL
	emitted when it should not
Message-ID: <CANaz7mybUiz7iH2pE2K725eKWp8n+g8UHP8vAwAP-6KQ-7cbKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm working on a plugin and trying to connect a SLOT to
layer.attributeValueChanged SIGNAL. However, I found that such SIGNAL is
(weirdly) emitted in the following scenario:

1. Load a vector file (I've tested this with a Shapefile and an SQLITE
file) with a numeric (int or real) field, whose value for the first feature
is NULL.
2. Open the attribute table of the vector layer.
3. Start an edit session cliking on "Toggle Edit Mode" button from the
Attribute table window.

As soon as the edit session starts, the SIGNAL is emitted. Now, if I click
on the "Toggle Edit Mode" button from the Attribute table window, I have to
choose among Save, Cancel, or Close Without Saving options, even without
changing any attribute value at all. Once I choose Close Without Saving,
the layer.attributeValueChanged SIGNAL is emitted once more.

Such behavior is hampering my plugin, which will depend on the
aforementioned SIGNAL.

Is this a bug? Do you know why layer.attributeValueChanged is being emitted
in such scenario? I've noticed that sometimes a blockSignals() method is
used in QGIS source code; couldn't we use blockSignals() to avoid emitting
the SIGNAL in this case?

######################################
Note: I use this code snippet in the QGIS Python console to be notified
when layer.attributeValueChanged is emitted:

##
def f(fid, idx, value):
  print fid,idx,value

l = iface.activeLayer()
l.attributeValueChanged.connect( f )
##

I'm getting these messages printed (4 is the index of the numeric field
whose value for the first feature is NULL):

0 4 NULL # When I open the edit session.
0 4 NULL # When I close the edit session.

If you want to reproduce the problem, you can use a sample Shapefile from
here: http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/tuxgis/tmp/test.zip

Regards,

Germán

Hi Germán,

I think some edit widgets have effects like this, when an unsupported
value is set on them, they will just convert it to a supported one and
change it.
Like some widgets may not support NULL values so they just change it to
something else.
Please check which field is affected, what edit type is set and what's
the value of the first (topmost) feature on the attribute table for this
field.

Thanks
Matthias

I think I got GDAL2 to install. But it seems to have uninstalled QGIS. I
really wasn't expecting that.

I've just installed QGIS 2.16 Windows 64 bit version from 
"http://qgis.org". The installation run smoothly, but when you start 
QGIS 2.16, It barfs with an python error and won't enable/start python 
plugins.

The error stems from the use of "ø" in the installation directory: 
"C:\Program Files\QGIS Nødebo".

The "ø" character is misrepresented in some of the path values in the 
"python-path" variable.

A quick workaround is to change the installation directory to ex. 
"C:\Program Files\QGIS Noedebo". In that case QGIS 2.16 starts without a 
hitch.

The error is reported as defect #23317

Hi Matthias,


thanks for the response.

In the first message I've included a link to a sample Shapefile. It has a
single field (called id) with these properties: type:int, type
name:Integer, length:10, precision:0, fieldIndex:0, edit widget:text edit.

The SIGNAL is emitted when the first feature has a NULL value for id field.
It happens only the first time I click on Toggle Edit Mode (after the
attribute table is open), the second time I start an edit session from the
same attribute table window, the SIGNAL is not emitted. To get the SIGNAL
emitted once more, I just need to close the attribute table window and open
it again, then starting an edit session emits the SIGNAL again.

What you say about edit widgets makes sense, what I'd like to discuss is
whether the SIGNAL should be emitted in such cases.


Regards,

Germán

I don't think this needs to be discussed. It simply should not be emitted.

Great. I'll open an issue in the QGIS issue tracker.
I'll see what I can do.

Hi Harrissou

I can't recreate this - I just get QGIS versions. You might want to look at
clearing out some hub.qgis.org cookies or web cache.

Hi,
Thanks Tom. I neither can reproduce it (but i'm not on the same computer
and won't have access to it for weeks). I could try your fix (if still
issued) when i'm back. And If it's a local issue (even though i changed
nothing on that computer and had often reported issue with it) then it's
fine. it's not enough to bother me :)

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,

I "fixed" it yesterday. For some reasons in Redmine control panel the
"QGIS Application" area was listed inside the "user plugins" one, now
is top level again.

cheers!

QGIS 2.16 is named ‘Nødebo’.



But why ‘Nødebo’ ?



At University of Copenhagen

Department of Geoscience and Natural Resource Management

Forest and Landscape College in Nødebo, the 1. st International QGIS conference and developer meeting was held.



How do you pronounce 'Nødebo' - Take a look and enjoy how people from all over the World pronounce 'Nødebo' and try it yourself :-)

Hi all,
known issue: new project go by default under the wrong dir. The fact
that it has never been fixed is another argument in favour of a move :)
All the best, and thanks.

I'm wrestling with GDAL at the moment, and thought I'd check the OSGeo4W
installer to see if it was up to date. I have GDAL 2.1.0-3. While vaguely
familiar with semantic versioning, I have no idea what the number after the
hyphen signifies - I've seen it change in QGIS as well. Can anyone tell me?

	svg/image
Message-ID: <CAOnR-iKBFA9AxVG2f8zNf9vJ0+Y6d3RTQv7syk2OHWAXHruhHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to comprehensively modify image/svg paths of any kind of vector
symbol that is possible to use svg/image (QgsFillSymbolV2, QgsLineSymbolV2,
QgsMarkerSymbolV2). With the symbol layers (QgsSymbolLayerV2) possibilities
of the symbol, I got this breakdown:

For SVG Marker

> - QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2
> -- QgsSVGMakerSymbolLayerV2
> --- .*path(), .setPath()*

For SVG marker line:

- QgsLineSymbolLayerV2
>  -- QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2

   --- *.subSymbol().symbolLayers()* -> *QgsSymbolLayerV2* (run this
breakdown again)

For Fill symbol:

- QgsFillSymbolLayerV2
> -- QgsImageFillSymbolLayer
> --- QgsRasterFillSymbolLayer
> ---- *.imageFilePath(), .setImageFilePath()*
> --- QgsSVGFillSymbolLayer
> ---- *.svgFilePath(), .setSvgFilePath()*


Do I miss other possibilities? or perhaps is there an easier way to modify
the path?

Cheers

Hi, confirmed here, but in QGIS already installed in C:/OSGEO4W64 . I
suppose we have other places where the ø breaks unhandled encoded
string.
Choosing that name was a good unit test :))

Message-ID: <5370AA8D-C019-4E0F-868F-5D62C200C466@kartoza.com>

Hi All

It seems like something broke in QgsComposition (in 2.16 and master) - we have some code like this:

logo = self.composition.getComposerItemById('logo')
logo.setPicturePath(self.logo_path)


Which fails saying that QgsCompositionItem has no method setPicturePath. This used to work fine in 2.14 - has anyone else encountered this? I know we are breaking API post 2.16 but it would be great if this still behaved right - or if someone could indicate the preferred way to do this now?

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi

Using Sip-4.18 by any chance? I'm seeing such issues also ever since
upgrading [1], didn't manage to find a solution up to now. (So if this is
indeed the issue, it is not related to QGIS 2.16 but rather to the sip
version.)

I don't think that was on purpose.

The method setPicturePath is still in QgsComposerPicture, but apparently
it's not properly converted to the subclass from QgsCompositionItem.

Might be related to sip like Sandro assumes. We could also check if
something broke with the %ConvertToSubclass code.

Hi Juergen

So it's the package number? And hence differs between platforms? 

Thanks

Hi all,

Just wondering - are we allowing use of c++11 features in master now?

Given qt 5.7 requires a c++11 compiler, it seems like the right time for us
to make this a requirement too.

Indeed I am using /usr/local/Cellar/sip/4.18/ (on OSX).

Do you know what the 'know good' version is?

@Larry do you know how to get different versions of SIP from brew? And do you happen to know which version of SIP was used by William's binary files (which don't have this issue)?

Thanks!

Thanks Matthias - I will have a poke around or see if I can upgrade my sip.

Hi

Did you look at the latest coverage reports :) ?

I don't think we require Qt 5.7, so from this side we still have a grace
period.
But at the same time I wouldn't mind, c++11 should be fairly common
these days.
GCC starting from 4.8 should have it which is shipped by default on
trusty and even 4.6 (precise) had a lot of support already.

We could also ask for specific features instead of full support which
might even give us more possibilities for early adoption of new compiler
features. [2]

Hi all,

Seems the name of the release is causing a few issues on Windows installs:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/202222/qgis-2-16-n%C3%B8debo-libintl-8-dll-missing
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/201657/problem-installing-new-version-of-qgis-under-windoss-10-64-bits/202200#202200
etc

Are we planning on keeping the unicode name for the folder name?  Could we
use something else with doesn't include unicode so we don't break too much.

Have we done an official release yet or still resolving some issues with
the packages?

Regards,
Nathan

No sure if I'm in favour of releasing the next 2.16.1 with an ascii path
'nodebo', it is probably 'work' as it is exception on the usual scripts..

Current situation 'forces' plugin authors (and us) to handle this in the
right way. I've fixed several plugins long time ago already because also
home-paths have often non-ascii chars in it (and I saved files in
home-paths....).
Having this fixed is a big plus for non-western users probably :-)

I think our release-manager must decide based on his workload/timeline.
We could add a big note on the qgis blog: "please change nødebo to
nodebo in install path if you have python/installation problems..."


> Have we done an official release yet or still resolving some issues with

At least on the website, the download page already linked to the 2.16.0 exe

We did not update website-banner, do blogpost, visual changelog etc etc

Are there other big issues which would require a new release? I read
something about ubuntu core dumps, and wm(t)s issues?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Not sure if that is related to the path.

That was fixed and had nothing to do with the path.

?

QGIS itself doesn't have issues with it, does it?   I didn't notice anything
when I test installed it (but w/o any plugins).

Anyway using the version number instead of the release name in the path
shouldn't be a problem.   But that's "just" a packaging issue of the
standalone.

 
> Have we done an official release yet or still resolving some issues with the

The release was branched and tagged and a new tarball was made.

The packages are available too.   I think there were some pending updates to
the website or visual changelog, but unfortunately got sidetracked by urgent
other stuff - otherwise I'd probably already had announced the release.

Hi Matthias,

A few weeks ago I asked a similar question here (titled: "custom
charts?"). You can store the filename and use a data defined svg image
in the styling tab:

---
with an SVG-marker the filename can be "data-defined", so you can for
instance use an expression like '/xxx/mymarker_' || id || '.svg'
---

QGIS cannot (yet) draw symbols using a piece of svg text in your table.
It would be great if it could though!

Good luck,

Raymond

BTW any idea why this wasn't an issue for Copiapó (1.6)?

Hey,

True, maybe it's just a bunch of unrelated package issues that look like
path issues

Matthias and Luca conclude that "Ubuntu packaging needs not be done without
QtWebkit". Examples of this issue from other plugins are here:

Hello

I am running "Warp (reproject)" in 2.16 on Ubuntu Trusty on the following

.qgis2\python\plugins\qgis2web\test\data\layer\test.png

It fails, logging the following:

Is this a local issue, possibly relating to GDAL versions, or am I getting

should we maybe try to add tests for Oracle provider too? Not sure if it

Nyall recently added tests.  But it requires a public oracle instance to run.

Hi Community,

while Tim tries to fix the rst export and I'm busy with Docs 2.14
branching, can some people please(!) have a look into the content of the
visual changelog:
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/2.16.0/

and provide some more text and or images for those items that have
minimal text:

The Processing Features
Feature: Support for DB2 databases
Feature: Refresh Postgres materialized views in db manager
Feature: Save styles in MS SQL and Oracle databases
Feature: Redlining support in GetMap and GetPrint
Feature: Default datum transformation for server
Feature: Plugins can add pages to vector layer properties

or look like it would be fun to have images:
Feature: Globe: Vector support
Feature: Globe: Extrude objects
Feature: Globe: Vertical exaggeration for DTM

Thanks!

Regards,

Richard

I *believe* this is because warp only takes the argument -te_srs if
GDAL>=2.0. I've submitted a PR, but I'm way out of my comfort zone here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3310

Thanks

Or it could just be a typo, checking for the wrong variable before adding it.
In that case, the fix could be as simple as:

On the Mac side of things, and with a focus on minimum OS support, the
first version of Xcode that 'fully' supports c++11 is 5.0, which puts the
minimum OS X at 10.8:
https://trac.macports.org/wiki/XcodeVersionInfo

This is based off the full c++11 support in Clang since 3.3:
http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html

OS X 10.8 is already the minimum OS for William's builds:
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis

I would like to go one further and put minimum OS X at 10.9 for QGIS 3.0,
due to current Homebrew pre-compiled binary support and full c++11 support,
prior to any compiler restrictions.

Hi,

I have compiled current master and run ctest after some time and 46
tests are failing here: 10 simply failed, 28 double free or
corruption, 4 corrupted double-linked list. Obviously, the problem is
local, so what is the trick to get less tests failing? Qt 4.8.6, clang
3.5.0, Debian Jessie 64 bit.

The error from QGIS says:

===============

    Couldn't load PyQGIS. Python support will be disabled.

    Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in ImportError:
    No module named qgis.core

    Python version: 2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:44:16) [MSC v.1500

(and more Python path statements...)

===================

QGIS then starts normally, but without Python support

AFAIK, the problem is the use of the character "ø" (o-slash) in the 
directory name for the QGIS program directory: "C:\Program Files\QGIS 
Nødebo". If you make a name change of the installation directory to ex. 
"C:\Program Files\QGIS Noedebo" it works without a hitch.

(As a Dane, I would never use local danish "æøå" or other accented 
character in file or directory names that might be installed on 
windows-pc's with different encoding than "Latin1", ex. slavic windows 
pc's., but that's another issue)

The specific problem might be the representation of "ø" in the Python 
path: There is 2 *different* versions: "N*\xc3\xb8*debo" and "N*\xf8*debo"

"\xf8" -> "ø" in Latin1 encoding.
"\xc3\xb8" -> UTF-8 "ø" -> "Ã¸" (if UTF8 "ø" is interpreted as a 2 
character Latin1 encoded string).

The cause is probably something like this: The python path is created 
using both UTF-8 encoding and Latin1 encoding. And later, the path is 
"decoded" using only Latin1 encoding.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with QgsVectorLayerUndoCommand class (QGIS
	crashes)
Message-ID: <CANaz7mxD4eKdryORVT9NMpjM0HiJAgoyv1GHs-5zibtBQwdWLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've discovered an issue with QgsVectorLayerUndoCommand class
(QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandChangeAttribute.undo() method) when updating an
attribute value after featureAdded SIGNAL is emitted.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open QGIS, load a sample vector layer like this (
http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/tuxgis/tmp/test_point.zip ) and select it in
the Layer List Widget (ToC).
2. Run the following code snippet into the QGIS Python Console to connect
featureAdded SIGNAL  to a custom SLOT that changes an attribute value:

##################
myLayer = iface.activeLayer()
field = 0   # Please use the test Shapefile provided, if not, adjust the
field index

def updateFeatureAttrs( fId ):
    f = myLayer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest( fId ) ).next()
    geom = f.geometry()
    myLayer.changeAttributeValue( fId, field, geom.asPoint().x() )

myLayer.featureAdded.connect( updateFeatureAttrs )
##################

3. Start editing. Add a new point. (If a form opens click on OK). Don't
save anything.
4. Stop editing and choose "Close without saving."
5. QGIS crashes and prints the following error message:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I've tested both Shapefiles and SpatiaLite layers, getting the same error.


Do you have an idea of what could be happening?

I'm using QGIS v.2.14.2 on a Linux Mint machine.

Hi,
This is probably a plugin raising the issue that triggers the
pyplugin_installer. We try to narrow it down..

That's because I have short path support on the filesystem an so "QGIS Nødebo"
is turned into "QGISND~1" and problems don't appear.

The second version of the installer now uses the version number in the path.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] morph delimited-text-provider to generic

Hi,
I have had that in mind for quite a while now:
- non spatial datasources that can be spatialized with XY / WKT  or adress
geocoding.
- Those non spatial datasources are most of the time untyped datasources.
Some try to autotype like Excel, some not like CSV.

Delimited text provider handles the text file sources, is very mature now,
except on casting some string to numeric types.
We also have OGR access to all text / excel / ods files. It works quite
well, especially with xlsx, and other formats storing some information on
data type. But we have no UI to help user choosing field format like in all
other softwares (excel/ calc / access...).
That situation leads to some cumbersome troubles like virtual layers trying
to access delimited text as OGR datasource, when sometimes it comes from
delimited text provider plugin. Obviously, this lead to a failing query.
Users also get confused too by those two datasource, each one stll with
drawbacks

What I had in mind was funding the unification of vector/spreadsheet
datasource GUI, and merge delimited text provider as a frontend to ogr csvt
/ vrt.  Nathan's old mockups were very interesting because we had an
overview of data and a UI to help user choose types / delimiters /
encoding, XY - WKT field.

Dragging a csv to QGIS woould then open that window to help importation.

Adding some memory of import schemas by file name could also gain a lot a
clicks also so that importing csv with same column names could assume using
last user choices and not default typing.  Anyway, not asking user for a
schema like excel does is a total mistake we must not reproduce.

We could maybe use the geometry generator, but if we do that, I'm afraid
that virtual layers seeing datasource through OGR will not see spatial
columns and lead to cumbersome failures. Many algorithms may also be
entroubled there.

I still see a drawback in ogr vrt / csvt approach, the same as Mapinfo back
in the old times, is that when user has readonly rights on the datasource,
vrt/csvt must be stored elsewhere that along the source file.  If we want a
user to be able to share the qgs project, I see no other places than the
qgs itself, and a mecanism to have OGR and virtual layers work seamlessly
with that.

My vote is then for a pure core way, not another plugin, with close
discussion with OGR-GDAL so that any tool sees datasources the same way in
QGIS. QGIS will do his part with a super easy import-preview window, pretty
close from current delimited text provider.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to fund that  since I'm leaving my job to go
working with Oslandia team ! If we agree on a plan, I'll try to convince
some funders :))

The series prior to 4.18, i.e. 4.17 and 4.16 were ok as far as I can

It would rather be about downgrading sip.
And that also means downgrading PyQt and other dependencies which you
will have to rebuild from old formulae.

Is this specific to composer items? Or does all sip casting fail? (ie,
try retrieving a symbol layer from a renderer... is it correctly cast
to QgsSimpleFillLayerV2/etc or just left at the generic
QgsSymbolLayerV2?)

Message-ID: <CALLUJBbz2FOeD_PTpRfgt5NU8v6Q3j+D-WauKP1jkYFMGKyGsg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have been working on how to speed up some raster processing  that require
long time when performed on large files. I wrote a script that use the
multiprocessing python module and it works well if I use PyCharm, reducing
more than the half the time necessary to process the image with my 4-cores
processor. I can see all my cores max out in the System Monitor and I don't
get any kind of error.

The problem comes up if I try to execute the same script as a Processing
Toolbox script, it never ends and after long time qgis crashes.. That's a
pity because it would be great to have and use it directly inside qgis!

Is there a way to fix this problem or another way to perform the same?

All the best

Hi All,

This is the report for the 8th week of my GSoC project.

*What did you get done this week?*

   - Implemented symbol handler and resolved the dependency problem to the
   image/svg used by the symbol. So in a symbol we can svg/image from the
   collection itself, from the other collections installed, from default
   package data, or from url.
   - Started implementing handler for processing scripts
   - Fixed some issues related to directory management

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Continue working on processing scripts handler so that we can put
   processing scripts in the resource directory (wondering now if we should
   rename the tools to something like 'QGIS Resource Sharing Tools'
   - Figure out a way to grab windows and test the tool
   - Create collection test data and implement some comprehensive unittests
   - Write documentation

*Are you blocked on anything?*
No. I think the tool is in a decent state that now importing symbol and svg
is working nicely.

Not for now (in this GSOC), but they are in the list of the resources that
could be shared by this system.

I'd suggest paths using version numbers is a better idea anyway and should be the default.
As well as avoiding these sorts of problems, they're also more understandable to users - is "Essen" newer of older than "Brighton"? What version was "Lyon"? I honestly have no idea the answers to any of those questions, but scattered around my machines I have versions of all of those. Version numbers are easy to compare though.

+1, I always struggle with this with Debian
(How to order: Sid, Weezy, Jessie?)

Having a fixed schedule, as QGIS does, it could be even better to
encode the date in the version (like Ubuntu does). Very easy to tell
that 16.04 is newer than 14.04, and you also know it came out in April
2016 (and <even>.04 is always LTR too!).

Sorry, didn't have much time on weekend. I'll make one this weekend :)

 What about plugins? Will they be included?

Installing plugin would from the collection would be easy if the intention,
for example, is just for testing the plugin. But the current plugin
management is already in a nice shape (versioning, etc). Would need to
investigate more if it's doable without changing the current plugin manager
architecture.

Right, I'll squeeze this one to my to-do list this week!

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Update i18n/qgis_*.ts from source and not transifex
Message-ID: <578CCAA4.8010403@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

To finish a DB Manager feature, I'd like to update i18n/qgis_*.ts from 
source and not from transifex.
I found some script to update i18n/qgis_*.ts files:
* update_ts.sh
* push_ts.sh
* pull_ts.sh

Which one can I use to update i18n/qgis_*.ts from source and not from 
transifex ?

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi René-Luc,

if I'm correct the transifex resources are updated via a github commit
hook... So committing your change should make your new strings show up
on transifex too (within some time...)

Plz Juergen/Werner correct me if I'm wrong...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Duiv,

I have found how to update i18n/qgis_*.ts without requesting transifex:
     ./scripts/update_ts.sh update

Is it the right way ?

Hi!

Yes you can use the script like that if you do not want to change
anything (pulling from or pushing to) transifex.

QGIS (master)$ ./scripts/update_ts.sh update ./

kind regards
Werner

Hello,

The problem seems come from c628c0f4345558a84834d429ff432f43b1b7d038

So you can do this to build QGIS:

git checkout 7b883e2edd0650521abc878e288c00c1f6bb1931

Ha, we did the same thing at the same time :-) I was just finished git bisecting and 
found the same offending commit, was just about to email.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Perfs: a lot of WKB conversions
Message-ID: <CAKOK4jjKi7iNELzvMCO+TR6nHbmtyL7moBi-J52kVHSRHvaRQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was looking at the perfs of qgis server and I did a small profiling of a
GetMap on a road layer (linestring) with QGIS configured with defaults. We
spend a lot of time converting to and from WKB. For example, for rending
67k features (3 GetMaps), we do this for each feature:

   - When reading the features from the DB, *we parse the WKB* and convert
   it to a QgsLineStringV2 (array of x and array of y)
   - Then, in QgsSymbolV2, we get the WKB from the QgsLineStringV2 (OK, no
   conversion, we kept the WKB)
   - Then QgsClipper::clippedLineWKB uses the QgsConstWkbSimplifierPtr
   which uses QgsMapToPixelSimplifier::simplifyPoints:
      - *Parse the WKB* to get the bounding box
      - *Parse the WKB* to read the points, simplify them and *write a new
      WKB* with the simplified geometry
      - *Parse the simplified WKB* to read the points into a QPolygonF

So that is 4 parsing of WKB and 1 write WKB instead of the single parse
that is really needed. I have trouble getting exact numbers but we spend
roughly 15% of our time doing just that. For example, we spend globally
4.3% of our time calling 1M times QgsConstWkbPtr::verifyBound.

A few numbers (% are relative to the caller and I show only the major
stuff):

   - QgsWMSServer::executeRequest
      - 83% in getMap ->QgsVectorLayerRenderer::drawRendererV2
         - 69% in renderFeature -> QgsSymbolV2::renderFeature
         - 52% in QgsLineSymbolV2::renderFeature (mostly Qt rendering stuff)
            - 35% in QgsSymbolV2::_getLineString ->
            QgsMapToPixelSimplifier::simplifyPoints
               - 46% simplifyWkbGeometry
               - 36% calculateBoundingBox
               - 11% QgsConstWkbPtr::operator>>
               - 25% in QgsFeatureIterator::nextFeature ->
         QgsPostgresFeatureIterator::fetchFeature
         - 79% in QgsPostgresFeatureIterator
            - 4% QgsPostgresConn::PGgetResult
            - others...
            - 17% in QgsHttpRequestHandler::setGetMapResponse

Now, simplifying all the WKB parse/write will gain maybe 10-15% in global
perfs for this case. But there are maybe reasons for that (memory usage or
I don't know)?
Why not avoiding simplifying a linestring if its bbox is in the same
ballpark as the bbox we are rendering? Or maybe this logic: if bboxLS.w /
nbPoints > pixelW*2 or bboxLS.h / nbPoints > pixelH*2, then we don't do
simplification. The idea being points are roughly equally spaced in a
linestring.

Why storing the points as two arrays in QgsLineStringV2 instead of directly
a QPolygonF?

I've been focusing only on linestrings for the moment. But I guess the same
applies to the other types of geometry.

I know it's a lot of questions for a single email. But I'm new to this code
and have no knowledge of its history and the choices/tradeoffs that were
made.

Thanks.


PS:

I think I've found what I'll do at Bonn's Hackfest ;-)

Hi to everybody,

I tried the script from Kartoza (and that from the first comment):

http://kartoza.com/how-to-create-a-qgis-pdf-report-with-a-few-lines-of-python/

using a simple project with one postgres layer and a  simple qpt print
template (consisting of one map composer item), it produces a PDF with
an empty map.

Can you help me in fixing the script?

I'm trying this with QGIS 2.14.4.

We can't use a QPolygonF, as it uses qreal for storage. For certain
architectures this is float, not double, and so is unsuitable for
storing coordinates.

I think the first logical step would be converting the clipper to work
directly with QgsAbstractGeometryV2, so that QgsSymbol can avoid one
of the to/from conversions at least.

Just curious - what did you use for profiling? Release or Debug build?

For a long time, WKB was the only way to store geometries in QGIS (it
started as PostGIS viewer after all :-). Later GEOS representation was
added and more recently the new geometry classes, so now the
geometries are stored natively in QgsLineStringV2 and others, but
there is still a fair amount of conversions going on in the background
as various parts still use WKB representation. So no reason really for
juggling with WKB apart from historical reasons...

It would be good to convert the code to use native representation
everywhere and use WKB only for import/export.

Sounds quite interesting - would be good to get some numbers how much
this would help.

Nyall has explained already...

Yes, but obviously the results from profiling vary quite a lot
depending on provider type and used symbology.

No problem!

Cool, that would force us to use the coordinates directly instead of the
WKB.

I was a bit sceptical, so I did a quick computation. A 32 bit float allows
an accuracy of 3mm with WGS84 for coordinates around 180°:
180 takes 8 bits out of the 23 bits of fraction.  The remaining 15 bits can
split the earth circumference into chunks of 3mm (40000/(2^15)). I'm maybe
off by +1 bit of precision (the fraction has an implicit 1 at MSB), so that
would be 1.5mm.

Other coordinate systems have offsets. For example CH1903+ which has an
offset of 2e6 that is reducing the precision of a float coordinate to 13cm.

Makes sense to use 64bits floats.

But then, we transform into screen coordinates after we converted to
QPolygonF. We loose the precision anyway. Isn't that a problem? But I'm
digressing and this is a problem only for ARM.

IMHO, implementing my proposed heuristic for not simplifying some
geometries would lead to better gains and is less changes to the code.
Usually, features that are around a few pixel of size are not rendered.
Their class should be filtered out by the scale range, if the layer style
is correctly tuned.

Thanks

Hi Martin,

When trying to optimize code like QGIS server, I tend to do that:

   1. Take a scenario that matches the realworld, run it with a RELEASE
   build on a machine matching somehow what is the usual production machine,
   then:
      1. do a warmup round to make sure the stuff as reached cruise speed
      and throw away the measurements.
      2. measuring global real times for several queries (2 minutes full
      speed) and look at the average response time and the distribution.
      2. I did the same measurements for other servers (MapServer and
   GeoServer), just for reference.
   3. When that is done, and only when that is done, I take a single query,
   that I run against QGIS compiled in DEBUG (to have symbols and to be able
   to follow what's happening) and run it under valgrind (callgrind mode).
   4. Then, after identifying trouble zones, I change the code and run step
   1 to see if there is any change. Keep the change if the improvement is
   measurable worth the added complexity.
   5. Repeat step 3 until you run out of budget and/or the improvements are
   becoming too small to be measured.

So yes, my per function numbers are not very accurate, but they are a very
good indication of where time is spent. But, I still have the global
numbers with a RELEASE build to see if changes are improving things.

My plan is to find some time to do that. It shouldn't take too much time.

The provider, at least PostGIS on the same machine, is not contributing too
much on the time spent to do a simple GetMap, from what I've seen. But yes,
when optimizing, you have to choose a scenario and it impacts a lot what
you see.

Thanks for the history lesson. It's always interesting to understand from
where a code comes from.

I'm not sure to have followed your computation, but it is wrong somewhere 
(must be a km vs m confusion). For example, OpenStreetMap .pbf format uses 
int32 to store longitudes (in a scaled way), and that enables a ~1cm accuracy.

Proof : 40e6 / 2^32 ~= 0.0093 m = 9.3 mm

In practice, they multiply longitudes in deegrees by 10 000 000, which offers 
40e6 / (2 * 180 * 10 000 000) = 1.1 cm accuracy

So for float32 given that you have only 23 bit for the mantissa, the precision 
should be much less than that in average and would not be uniform anyway.

But your conclusion that float32 cannot be used to store coordinates is right 
:-)

Yes indeed. Shame on me. The earth circumference is 40'000km, not 40'000m.

Cool. By the way, there is also a cmake build type "release with debug
info" which should bring the best of the both worlds.

If I remember correctly, the PostGIS provider actually spends quite
significant amount of time waiting for the response from server - the
wait is however not showing up in callgrind as the process is sleeping
during that time. PostGIS is also a case where parallel map rendering
helps a lot (when using multiple layers) as the waiting time is
reduced significantly.

​Thank you Richard! Maybe someone here on the dev list has an idea how to
fix this.

Any idea why? I have merged pull request with just GRASS config files

With the next commit the test on Mac is passing but PyQgsServerWFST
(which I certainly had not touched) failing on Linux / gcc. It looks
like random, but I see that it is not failing for others.

I similar issue:

     def __init__(self, canvas):
         QgsMapTool.__init__(self, canvas)

     def canvasReleaseEvent(self, e):

-> The canvasReleaseEvent of the base class is fired, the overriding

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrahXkD+6giVzGHe29pCLQW2ukwO-sJWifh531X1xOqOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
(sorry for the cross-posting)

A few days ago, 2.14 doc has been released and the issues for 2.16 are
being addressed now.
Thanks to the automatic [feature] webhook, we are able to build the list of
changes in doc as soon as features land. BUT but... Currently, the webhook
is set to tag newcoming issues as 3.0 milestone. And I remarked there are
some issues that are from master [0] or master_2 branch [1] (I must confess
I didn't check if these features were cherry-picked from master and
vice-versa) but if I'm not wrong:
master --> 3.0
master_2 --> a probable 2.18

So questions:
- Will we have a 2.18 (if ever) documentation?
- Are all features added to 2.18 also in 3.0 (and vice-versa)?
- Should the webhook set different milestions according to the branch used?

Hi Harrissou, 

I would say 99% of the new features in the 2.x branch should also land
in the 3.x branch - otherwise it would be a waste ... in the opposite
direction it will be less, since new features that depend on an API
break can't be present in the 2.x. branch. 

It is also very likely that a 2.18 release will happen - we are still
waiting for Jürgens DXF/DWG import, which should land in 2.18 and 3.x 

If there will be a 2.18 documentation? This question I can't answer. If
2.18 is really the latest 2.x version (noone really knows exactly until
we have proper progress in the 3.x branch) it would make sense to have
documentation and also treat it as a LT version with extended bug
fixing. That's just my personal opinion and may not be the position of
PSC or other project members. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

honestly, I think in 99% of the cases it's fine to just target one or
the other.

Thanks a lot for all your work on that!!

I think it would be good to plan 2.18 in general. Triggering the release
scripts should be trivial. Since some features end up in 2.18, I guess
it will happen.
Concerning docs and also pre-release fixing, I wonder if this effort
should be spent on the 3.0 migration instead?

> - Are all features added to 2.18 also in 3.0 (and vice-versa)?

master_2 features should all also end up in master.
master features are not necessarily ported to master_2.

> - Should the webhook set different milestions according to the branch used?

Yes, master_2 => 2.18, master => 3.0.

Has there ever been a documentation released for 2.10 and 2.12?
If non-LTR get no documentation, there's probably not much point in
doing one for 2.18 I think?
People can still refer to the "testing" doc from master instead which
should match in many points (and where not, some notes can be included).

So, either we can know which feature is in 2.18 and which in 3.0 and we can 
target the ticket (in the doc repository) in the two milestone and without 
much work, or we can't.

Anyway, as we are "still" working in the 2.16 release,  I guess we can aims to 
release it at the end of the year, not before.

Next, we should focus on 3.0 to get the doc ready for QGIS 3.0, at the 
beginning of 2017.

So +1 for your proposition.

Are you sure? 2.18 milestone doesn't exist in the QGIS doc repository.

Indeed, but this is more a consequence than a cause. In the mid term I prefer 
that we add new feature in the doc in the same time that the ticket is created 
and so get a documentation release for each QGIS release.

Both tests passed when I had manually relaunched the tests on Travis.
Do others also have to fiddle with Travis this way?

Unfortunately some tests do not run stable. E.g. PyQgsAppStartup seems
to freeze and runs into a 60 secods timeout every once in a while. But
it's some kind of race condition or other external factors triggering this.
Some tests have been disabled because they were unstable, but mainly the
ones depending on external services (e.g. osm). I don't really want to
do this with the app startup test because it often reveals python problems.

So in short, somebody needs to look into this (these?) issue(s). Until
then we are probably left with restarting or ignoring the tests if we
see it fail because of the timeout.

Message-ID: <1469008639037-5277278.post@n6.nabble.com>

I was retrieving the URL of a WFS layer, and formatting it for Leaflet as
follows:

layerSource = layer.source()
layerSource += "&outputFormat=text%2Fjavascript&"
layerSource += "format_options=callback%3AmyCallback"
wfsVars += ('' % layerSource)

This no longer works, because source() on a WFS layer now (2.16 Win7x64)
returns a string of the format:

retrictToRequestBBOX='1' srsname='EPSG:27700'
typename='yorkshire_dales:ydnpa_route_accessibility'
url='http://maps.nationalparks.gov.uk/geoserver/wfs' table="" sql=

When did this change? And can I retrieve the URL as I did before, or am I
going to have to hack this new string around to build the WFS URL?

Thanks

Tom

You can use QgsDataSourceURI.param("url") to retrieve the url parameter. You 
'll need to augment it with SERVICE, VERSION and REQUEST parameters to form a 
valid GetFeature request.

Not sure we can?  2.14 is bug fix only.  Given it's Python though you could
just patch their copy.

Hi René-Luc, 

There are no new features in past versions - only bug fixes. This also
applies to LT releases. 

Sometimes it is a bit of a discussion if something qualifies as bug fix
or a feature, e.g. if something really essential is missing. So if you
can sell it as a "bug fix" it may get in. 

But it is up to Jürgen to decide.

Perfect - thanks so much for the extremely thorough answer. I still don't
understand why my tests aren't failing with 2.16/master, but there we go...

Thanks again

Same thinking here, in general a release should receive bugfixes, not
features.

In the past we played with shipping updates through the plugin manager
(see processing) but it turned out, that suddenly certain features were
shipped via plugin manager to old installations without required APIs
available. Or core plugin being newer but shadowed by the custom
installed (plugin manager). This road might be possible but would
require proper versioning of core plugins and properly setting min- and
max- version on it (and probably also some logic in the plugin manager
to decide which one to load).

In short: If it cannot be called a bugfix, I'd say just ship it in a
custom repository to your customers and make them aware it needs to be
uninstalled on next QGIS update.

Many apologies, but how do I retrieve the QgsDataSourceURI of a layer? I'm
not managing to get it to work.

Something like QgsDataSourceURI(layer.provider().dataSourceUri())

Message-ID: <CABPxTTocXaw17cxicWXOz03FkhvLVA0GSLsCd=Lw060DSZUk8w@mail.gmail.com>

I am planning on submitting a new D3 plugin to the QGIS plugins repo. This
generates a circular heatmap D3 web page that has some similarities to the
ArcGIS data clock. This is the github link.

https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/qgis-d3datavis-plugin

I have done a write up that shows what it does. The question that I have is
when should a plugin be marked experimental? Are their advantages in
marking it experimental? I think what I have done so far is fairly solid
and the only changes will be to improve upon it and perhaps add some other
charts.

I would appreciate your thoughts before I submit the plugin.

Thanks,

Calvin

Thanks for that. IMHO the experimental flag is useful if you want to
have a first test from a restricted community of, possibly more skilled,
users before submitting it to a worlwide audience of potentially
hundreds of thousands users. It is imperative if you suspect your plugin
might mess up user data or cause other inconveniences.
Please note that other efforts are underway to use graphical js libs
from within QGIS, so you may find convenient to join forces.
Looking forward to see your plugin, and publish it.
All the best.

Hi, 

You can submit it as non-experimental right away, if you think it is
already mature enough. I think this flag is self-declared - up to the
developer to decide. Paolo, who checks new plugins may suggest to the
plugin author to mark it as experimental if he thinks it is not yet
mature enough. 

Reasons for experimental: 

- still under early development (initial version) 

- may fail in a lot of cases (unsuitable for production use) 

- no documentation at all - not obvious for the user how to use it 

It looks like a very nice plugin - thank you for developing and
submitting it! Definitely useful for people doing time analysis. I will
recommend it to my local police, who already is doing crime analysis
with QGIS. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

I don't know if it is possible, but it would be really nice if there were a
way to get feedback on what a user likes or especially what the user
dislikes when they vote on a QGIS plugin. If they give it a 1, 2, or 3 star
vote I would really like to know why. I would take the steps to try and fix
what they don't like. I know they could take the extra step of posting
something on the github page, but knowing that I am somewhat lazy I
wouldn't take that extra step unless I had a real compelling reason. Also I
think that unless a user is a developer they are not likely to post a
problem on github. I base this on the fact that I am new to github and
wouldn't have taken that step a year or more ago.

If there were a way to make giving feedback really easy as a part of the
clicking on the stars I think it would be quite beneficial to the
developers.

Hi,
agreed, this would be a very nice feature (even though we should be
careful about the potential implication - remember we have a potential
user base in the order of 100k users). Could you please open a feature
req, or much better help us coding it?
All the best.

There is a ticket related here https://hub.qgis.org/issues/6478. We had a
discussion whether we should have the feedbacks on our side or usea 3rd
party plugin such as disqus, but it did not go much further than that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS Provider Strategies
Message-ID: <8f024c78-f5e2-c3af-b8c4-d27faf05668c@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I am a bit confused by the WFS option *"Only request features
overlapping the view extent"*.

In general, that's what every provider does by default and is a safe
strategy to use. If this option is unchecked, QGIS will just start
downloading features randomly until it hits a server limit (or not).

The only reason why one would possibly want to do that is to warm a
cache on a layer where he know he will be getting all the features (in a
reasonable time). In this case, the option should probably be renamed
(to something containing the word "cache").

Question: *is **there anybody using WFS with this option unchecked?* And
if yes, for what reason?

Apart from this, Raymond noticed that cached features are not dismissed,
when they are re-downloaded so you end up with duplicated features after
multiple rendering cycles. Does that ring a bell for someone?

Best Regards

Matthias

Time to upgrade the servers to support WFS 2.0 paging :-)

The provider always cache (meaning keep in a temporary database the features 
retrieved), whatever you check or uncheck this option. For example with the 
default behaviour, zoom in in some region and wait for some or all features to 
be retrieved, and zoom out. The provider will use the already downloaded 
features first and then return the features coming from the background 
downloading of the new request (using gml:id/fid to make sure not to return 
already cached features).

Yes it is needed for some use cases. There are servers that have buggy 
behaviour with BBOX requests combined with other filters. Or the cost of 
solving a spatial request might be super high, making it more practical to 
issue a GetFeature without a BBOX.

That should be better explained to be sure. It might be an issue with the 
features returned by the server having not a stable gml:id (or even not a id 
at all). Richard raised a ticket about that.

Ok, so it should be a super well hidden checkbox with a big warning sign
next to it?

You get the feeling of a more responsive UI when you can reuse already 
downloaded features, but that's true that if the server content has changed in 
between, you won't get the new version. In which case you'll have to reload 
the layer with F5.

That really depend on servers. If the current default behaviour is OK for 
most, it might still be useful that the option is not too hidden if users have 
issues with some servers. They might have a better chance of trying to uncheck 
the option. Where would you hide it ?
Note: this is not new to 2.16 as far as I remember. The option was already 
there.

True... Although we could replace the features in the cache instead of
dropping the new ones for a tiny improvement.

Well, I was confused and I know of others which are confused.

At the moment it's really hard to tell which is the recommended option
and which one is the "try this if your sever is broken" option. We could
just add a warning if it's unchecked which says "only do this if there
are problems with the default" or put it into an advanced dialog or so.
Have you actually seen such servers? And if yes, can you name them?

That would indeed help for the next feature request

The issues were with multiple layer joins with GeoServer in some circumstances not very
clearly understood ( I don't want to particularly point fingers at
GeoServer, as server side joins is a pretty advanced feature rarely implemented by servers)

You need to get an API key at
 https://data.linz.govt.nz/group/owner-data-controlled-access-group/

And then try the following SQL request

 SELECT DISTINCT
       par.id,
       par.status,
       own.owner_type,
       own.prime_surname,
       own.prime_other_names,
       own.corporate_name,
        par.shape
FROM
       "layer-1571" AS par
       JOIN "table-1569" AS tpa ON par.id = tpa.par_id
       JOIN "table-1564" AS own ON tpa.title_no = own.title_no
WHERE
       ST_Within(par.shape, ST_MakeEnvelope(174.806, -41.347, 174.846, -41.285, 'EPSG:4167’))

The server will not like the extra addition of the BBOX.

There might be less complicated examples but this is the one I managed to find quickly in my mail box...

Ok, so it's really required... But I think the labelling of the checkbox
should somehow better reflect the situation.

I think already inverting the question to "Do not send bounding box
filter to server" would help to raise awareness. And with a tooltip
explaining that this only is used for certain server scenarios it would
be enough information for everyone.

My thinking now was "Of course I only want only features in the bbox.
But wait, why would I even have to opt-in? Is there something wrong with
it? Will other features be missing from the attribute table if I put a
check there?"

The WFS 2.0 joining implementation in GeoServer can certainly use some
love. Some fixes have been
made in the last year, but there is still a significant limitation, the
join has to be a "star" one,
with a central feature type joining with the others, while a list one
cannot be made, e.g.:
* ((T1 join T2) join T3) can always be made (by reshuffling thing so that
T2 is the center)
* ((T1 join T2) join T3) join T4) cannot be implemented without changing
the API down in GeoTools instead, that would be quite a bit of work
(sponsorship welcomed ;-) )

Cheers
Andrea

We tried in history, but the doc (and doc release-) team could just not
cope with all the releases. So we more or less decided to only build (at
least translated) the docs for LTR versions.

2.16 is non-ltr and 2.18 is a special case.. so I would also be OK to
concentrate on a docs build  for 3.0. So only pick features which will
be ported to 3.0 from 2.16 and 2.18 etcetc

But we can off course try to follow... currently '[FEATURE]' is
automatically labeled as 3.0 milestone...
IF we want to distinguish between those, we either have to fix the script:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Sysadmin/blob/master/webhooks/github_feature_tracker.cgi
Or do it by hand...

Richard

Tom,

I just commited a change that should fix this issue

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/df2ca2e60798315d816966f25aa024b93835f776

Could you try again and see if now you dont get that error?

 I'm not convinced the graphics are particularly honest. The innermost
cells are so much smaller than the outer ones, and this distorts our
perception of what is important. That might be fixable by varying the
radius non-linearly but that might look weird.

 A straightforward rectangular heat map with square cells doesn't have
this problem. I appreciate you lose the wraparound when plotting hours
of the day over many days, or days of the week over many weeks, but
this circular plot can only do that in one dimension anyway. For
instance in the examples on the plugin page I can't easily compare
Sunday to Monday - the inner ring should connect to the outer ring,
forming a doughnut in 3d!

 You can put a rectangular heatmap inside 8 copies of itself if you
want to emphasise the periodic repeating nature of a dimension, or
even make an interactive heatmap the user can drag infinitely, with
the image repeating - basically mapping the 3d doughnut onto a 2d
sqare!

Message-ID: <50FFCD4FD2A0A948A16AFC67888052C643359578@srsofaioi16256.verw.rootso.org>

Hi,

When I start QGIS 2.14 (self compiled) on Ubuntu 14.04, QGIS starts a child process which immediately turns into a zombie process and stays there until QGIS is closed.
Excerpt from a ps -ef:
myself 18895  5026 16 09:02 pts/0    00:00:03 /usr/local/qgis/bin/qgis
myself 18924 18895  0 09:02 pts/0    00:00:00 [sh] <defunct>

Any idea what could be the reason?
When I disable the Processing plugin, this doesn't happen.

Processing tries to figure out the version of SAGA you have installed,
and to do so it has to call SAGA. I guess that might be the source of
this issue. It should correctly close that process, but it seems it is
not doing so in your case...

Seems like a good guess, as I have no SAGA installed at all.
So far I have no plans to install it because I don't really need it. Is there any way I can make Processing handling better this kind of setup?

Ah, thanks so much - I'll try it once there's a nightly.

Thanks again!

Message-ID: <20160721120000.190c0cba@indien.Speedport_W_724V_Typ_A_05011602_00_001>

Hi,

we started to prepare our own QGIS wiki page to organize the upcoming
hackfest in Bonn and to make sure that our hackfest will be fun. Many of you
already registered at foss4g wiki page at

https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2016_Code_Sprint#Registered_Attendees

and I tried already to put it in sync this with our new internal page at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Hackfest---Bonn---August-2016

But I need your help and would like to ask you to do the following for us:

a) If you want to participate, please register twice in the FOSS4G Wiki and
in the QGIS Wiki. This is important to have a smooth organisation on QGIS
and FOSS4G side.

b) If you already registered at one of the pages, please check again and make
sure you appear in both lists.

To organize further accomodation and our well-known dinner, we need your
information as quick and as complete as possible.

Thanks a lot
Otto

Thanks so much for everyone who has commented. I like the idea of being
able to interactively move the position of the rings so that the inner
becomes the outer or any other ring for that matter.

There is always a trade off on how you visualize data. I plan on adding the
rectangular graph as well but I started with the circular graph because I
had a request to do so. There are several other items that I plan on adding.

1. Select the beginning and ending colors.
2. Use any color ramp and select the number of bins.
3. Rectangular chart.

I used an existing circular heatmap to get started, but will need to either
extend it or write something new because it doesn't do exactly what I will
need.

Message-ID: <CA+7ktcu1stF=qhjKxP9B3nnisq8WjR8HRWg=TK5epqDBw8XqrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm running OS X 10.11.5, QGis 2.14.2-Essen (binary from KyngChaos).
I'm trying to connect to this WMS service:

https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/wms/viirs/?VERSION=1.1.1&

I receive a message, "Failed to download capabilities: Download of
capabilities failed: SSL handshake failed."

To troubleshoot, I tried using the system openssl command like this:

/usr/bin/openssl s_client -connect firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov:443
CONNECTED(00000003)
44549:error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert
handshake
failure:/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/OpenSSL098/OpenSSL098-59.40.2/src/ssl/s23_clnt.c:593:

The system version of OpenSSL is OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016.

After installing a newer OpenSSL via brew, I could run the same s_client
command and the connection worked, so it appears that QGis is linked
against the system libraries and is unable to communicate with a server
with SSLv3 disabled.

Is there a remedy for this?  Can I provide additional information for
debugging?

Sincerely,
- Bruce

Hi,
I'm looking into improving the SLD export, and stumbled into a schema

that, if fixed, may cause other regression.
In particular, the root element StyledLayerDescriptor contains a "units"

   ...
</StyledLayerDescriptor>

It's in particular the units="mm" element. Checking the git history I found
it has been introduced by this commit:

---------------------

b54b159 - rldhont <rldhont at gmail.com> 23-ott-2015
[BUGFIX] Set default units to mm in exportSld

The default units in QgsMapRenderer is Millimeters. The default units in SLD
 is Pixel but exportSld does not convert all millimeters in pixels.

We notes this bug by comparing default QGS Server rendering and rendering
with
 the SLD generated by QGIS.

To resolve it, we just have to add units to the document element.

---------------------

The above comments seems to suggest something is actually using that
attribute, but I'm not sure what.

Mind, GeoServer can parse the file the same, but if users try to validate
it (there is a validation button in the style editor), they will get the
following error:

"ine 2: cvc-complex-type.3.2.2: Attribute 'units' is not allowed to appear
in element 'StyledLayerDescriptor'."

Also, the attribute per se does nothing in a compliant client, since SLD
1.1 lacks the very concept of "on screen unit", the uom allowed
are pixel (on screen), meter (on ground), feet (on ground).
A SLD export trying to be compliant should convert mm to pixels assuming
some DPI conversion factor (which means,
making many changes around... bummer). I see there is already a uomScale in
the conversion properties, but I see it's not
used for point symbol sizes (as the commit message says.. I actually don't
see it being used anywhere).

Would it be ok to remove that attribute and use uomScale to properly adapt
sizes from mm to px instead?

Cheers
Andrea

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iJhXG=cxDQMnXHXHZd5EwsCWTG1PZMZr0XeMnq7K9eKHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is the report for the 9th week of my GSoC project for QGIS. I also
made a video to explain the state of the tools, I hope it could help
https://youtu.be/77fglr3C2TU (especially for Richard :))

*What did you get done this week?*

   - Implemented processing scripts handler
   - Implemented another approach to deal with threads
   - Created collection test data
   - Moved documentation from documentup to jekyll github page (
   http://www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_resources_sharing/)
   - Implemented preview of the collection
   - Fixed some layout problem reported by Ale

*What do you plan on doing next week?*
I plan to:

   - Implement repository handler to deal with local file system
   - Implement style resource handler
   - Write tests
   - Write documentation

But I'll call Ale on Monday, if he's available, to talk about what I should
do this week

*Are you blocked on anything?*
No, but I think I need people testing the tool. So, if you're interested to
test it, you can clone the project right here
https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing to your local QGIS
directory. It would be helpful for me if there's someone testing on Windows
and Mac. I still have 4 weeks left to polish things up.

Cheers

Hi,

I noticed the same 'uom' mm problem when I tested the SLD converting
routines used by GeoServer Explorer plugin a couple of months ago, thank
for bringing up this issue.

Your proposed solution makes perfectly sense to me.

Did you check if is there already an issue on hub.qgis.org?

I did not, searched now, found one, but not in particular the one about
units attribute not being schema compliant,
more about the fact that units means nothing to a compliant client:

Hi Andrea,

I'm the author of the commits that add a 'units' attribute to 
StyleLayerDescriptor element.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b54b1598a6ba145a51aa266cde9282ae4d0378ad
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/f7ce8b94344e7a7dd12fac2a90bd84df30b7e82f

If you look at the code of these 2 commits, I didn't change anything 
about QGIS SLD interpretation. In the QGIS core, a 'units' attribute is 
used to defined the SLD default units for distance.
But I didn't add this 'units' attribute for QGIS and QGIS Server SLD 
interpretation, I add these 'units' for GeoServer.

I didn't used uomScale because of SLD has to be used for any DPI screen. 
So if a QGIS user made style in pixels, he has made the choice to have 
different rendering in different DPI screen. But if the user made style 
in mm on the screen, the stroke or line has to have the same size in 
different DPI screen.

Can QGIS extend SLD by added it's own schema for defining units attribute ?

Can we used a VendorOption, to specify mm on the screen like in GeoServer ?
http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/sld-extensions/label-obstacles.html

About uom in Symbolizer, I think QGIS has to add it like GeoServer 
http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/sld-extensions/uom.html#example

Regards,

René-Luc

GeoServer cannot make any use of that attribute, it's not part of the spec,
nor part of the GeoServer own extensions to SLD. It just makes people
wonder why the validation fails, and then
we get tickets on either qgis or geoserver side :-)
Also, unit management is already available, but at the symbolizer level, if
anything, it would make more sense to add a custom uom value in screen mm
that GeoServer would
understand (more on this later, read below).

This has often no meaning in a server side application, where the imagery
is built without knowing about the user
screen DPI, sometimes in advance of actual usage on a screen (tile caching).
GeoServer has a vendor option in GetMap to specify the DPI, but only custom
built clients use it (strictly standard clients won't), I see
QGis server has the same, but as a vendor option, it cannot be relied upon
in general.
The option to transform to pixels using OGC own standard DPI recommendation
(a value close to 91, in particular, 25.4 / 0.28, see the SLD/SE spec)
allows more software to understand the style file, and then if DPI is part
of the request, qgis/geoserver can adjust the pixel
values on the fly accounting for the difference between standard and actual
DPI.

Errr... in theory yes, but in practice it will likely not work. The
compliant way to do it would be to create your own schema, roll your own
custom element, e.g. QGisStyledLayerDescriptor, put
it in a substitution group with StyledLayerDescriptor, link to it from the
exported styles, and then in such element you can add your own attributes.
However, I don't know if clients would be able to figure this out, I
believe many would just break because they do not recognize it.
GeoServer own parser might even parse it anyways (it's schema driven, so it
might inspect your extended schema before starting the parse if you linked
to it), but it would still not know what to do with the units attribute
anyways.

VendorOption is one of GeoServer extra tags that are not part of the SLD/SE
schemas (so they are not compliant either).
Check the schemas:
http://schemas.opengis.net/se/1.1.0/Symbolizer.xsd
We normally warn people that the moment they start using vendor extensions,
the SLD cannot be exported out to other software anymore
(some clients will fail to parse, others will just ignore the extra
elements/attributes).

This brings me to a different topic... when you say in the UI "export to
SLD" the export should, imho, strictly be compliant, thus don't use the
VendorOption tag, or other extensions, or non
compliant mark names, and the like... it should be a best effort export
that ensures compatibility with whatever other software.

I would instead favor adding another export option, "export to GeoServer
SLD", in which the code would add VendorOption and know what specific
options GeoServer supports.
I see that QGis is already using VendorOption in some places, but with
values GeoServer does not understand... wondering, what would be the
software
that understands those extras? I am thinking maybe they have been added to
allow a "export and re-import in QGis" round trip, making them
a "export to QGis SLD" option?

uom is a standard attribute in SE 1.1, but GeoServer also allows its usage
in SLD 1.0, making it a vendor extension in that context.
When used in SE 1.1 GeoServer should understand it normally (within the
limits of the standard units, pixel, meter, feet, I'm open to
extend that list to include on screen mm within the context of a GeoServer
targeted SLD export).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cleaning up the QEP list
Message-ID: <e93f9ba4911da58460665dc1edc904ec@carto.net>

Hi all, Hi Nathan, 

I am looking at the QEPs from time to time that and I think it needs a
little attention. Quite a few proposals would be ready to make a
decision. Some QEPs are ready but lack funding. Perhaps we can introduce
a new label stating "Needs funds" or something similar? It would help
potential funders to pick things they like to see implemented. Quite a
few of the proposals are already implemented, sometimes even if they
don't have the "Accepted label" - i guess some of the implementations
had time pressure due to the 2.16 list and thus couldn't wait for
voting/acceptance. 

Devs want to start working on many of the issues mentioned in the QEPs -
so decisions need to be taken in a timely manner. 

Here are some of my personal suggestions for changes / closings: 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/42
(Compulsory Unit Tests for Core Changes) - discussion stalled - but I
think now would be the perfect timing to implement this proposal. 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/40 (Geometry
redesign) - was implemented already 2 or 3 versions ago - should be
accepted and closed 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/59
(aggregate functions) is accepted, implemented - it can be closed 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/58 (QGIS
Styles, Symbols ans SVG Markers Sharing Repository) - is currently being
implemented by Akbar - shouldn't it be voted on/accepted? 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/53 (WFS
provider enhancements) - is already implemented and should be closed 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/49 (Label
mask) - would be ready to implement, but lacks funding (add the new
"Needs funds" label?) 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/46 (Labling
path) - would be ready to implement, but lacks funding (add the new
"Needs funds" label?) 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/45 (Long
term releases) - implemented - should be closed 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/43 (Rename
Compositions to Print Layouts) - would be good to be addressed during
work for 3.x - can we continue discussion and vote on it? 

 - https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/39 (Layout
rework (composer v2)) - Nyall wants to start on this - so it should be
discussed and accepted 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/38
(Inheritable property collections) - unsure about the status here,
apparently it has a prototype implementation. How does this relate to
the variable system introduced recently? 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/37 (Fields
and Forms Redesign) - would be a good candidate to be implemented during
QGIS 3.x - probably lacks funding 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/35
(Authentication configuration system with master password) - already
implemented. Should be accetped and closed. 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/32 (Add QGIS
server access control interface for python plugins) - already
implemented. Should be accepted and closed: 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/31 (QGIS
Legal Entity) - accepted by Loomio vote and mostly implemented. Should
be acepted and closed. 

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/29 (QGIS
3.0) - discussion maybe a bit outdated? Close? 

It would be good, if we, as the project would take the QEPs a bit more
seriously and maintain them accordingly. Seems like some devs do, some
don't. Any comments? 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

agreed fully. Thanks for the cleanup. IMHO there should be one (member
of the PSC or of the community) clearly responsible for each piece of
the infrastructure, even when this (as for QEPs) does not require a
daily work. If responsibility is vague and spread, entropy accumulates.
All the best.

Hi Andreas and all, 
Being the funder for a few QEP's, here is the really last status from
the ex-funder point of view.

This needs fundings for sure ,  we lowered priority since mask plugin
does the job by now and we needed to focus on auxiliary storage, label
connnectors and curved label improvents.

That feature deserves love too, so that QGIS can be the total
cartographic tool, allowing to have curved labels even for points and
polygons. Same as label mask, we needed to achieve QEP 20 and 28 before
funding that, and money is missing.

The "needs funding" that is a great idea, +1.

We already delegated QEP maintenance work to Nathan...[1] so its probably better to focus on providing feedback to him on how we can potentially improve and streamline the process - I am sure he will take any suggestions on board...

Message-ID: <CAB28Asgem0mVh3PxJfZUdRFyTRteHQW9x2-kLKxnhPjWkHThOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just launched a new crowdfunding campaign to implement a
web-mapping style cluster renderer for QGIS:

http://north-road.com/qgis-cluster-renderer-crowdfunding/

Any assistance you can offer in spreading the word about this would be
greatly appreciated, and help make this cool new feature a reality!

So please reshare via twitter/facebook/etc, and if you've got any
contacts in the local user groups who might be interested please let
them know too...

Cheers,

Nyall

	projecta/osgeo
Message-ID: <445e2ec3-5871-9350-f16d-bdc012518509@duif.net>

After seeing Nyall cloudfunding campaign and finding out the minimal is
200 dollar when I wanted to do a small donation for fun, I thought that
it would be cool if we as QGIS or OSGEO would have our own micro
crowdfunding platform...

The idea is to make it easier for (core)-developers to launch such a
campaign..

First thing I thought is to make it part of 'projecta', maybe only
working with paypal or so?

But then I thought it would also be a benefit for OSGEO/other projects
and googled this list [0] of software to use. This [1] is even already a
django one...

I was thinking also about the 'tagged/labeled'-donations of Ubuntu,
where IF you do a (small) donation you can 'label' it to a certain
'piece of work'.... thinking about this... probably to much fuss/work to
administrate this...

Just wanted to share this, but as always: just do it :-)

Hi all,

keeping on exploring the Processing - R script capabilities, there are
some input parameters that I'm not able to use.

For example there is the multiple field option, as described in the code:

In a script you can use it with
##Fields=[optional] multiple field [number|string] Parentinput

but if I use it in a script like

##layer=vector
##fields=multiple field layer

I get this error:

NameError
global name 'QtCore' is not defined


am I missing something?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Richard, 

It would be definitely useful to have a crowd-funding tool for all devs
or even better, all OSGEO projects. 

------------------ 

There are already existing crowd-funding platforms, but usually they
keep a significant portion of the income. As an example, kickstarter
keeps 5% of all income. If it is a larger project (say 30k), that would
equal to 1500 EUR - enough to be significant and enough to implement
other small stuff for QGIS. 

Nyall decided to do things completely manually without a crowd-funding
platform, but to keep administration work low, avoid too small
micro-donations - for this project he set the minimum amount to EUR200.
For other bigger crowd-funding projects this may be a higher value. 

Maybe we can find a crowd-funding platform that only keeps 1-2 percent -
which would be reasonable in my opinion. Often, there is an additional
credit card or PayPal fee involved in addition.

We are planning something exactly like this on projects. It will be a while before it is ready though.

Oggetto: [Qgis-developer] Crowdfunding campaign for a Point Cluster Renderer 

Hi all, 

I've just launched a new crowdfunding campaign to implement a 
web-mapping style cluster renderer for QGIS: 

http://north-road.com/qgis-cluster-renderer-crowdfunding/ 

Any assistance you can offer in spreading the word about this would be 
greatly appreciated, and help make this cool new feature a reality! 

So please reshare via twitter/facebook/etc, and if you've got any 
contacts in the local user groups who might be interested please let 
them know too... 

Cheers, 

Nyall

Hi, 

Some more research dug up: 

http://www.selfstarter.us/ - OSGEO or QGIS.ORG could use this to set up
our own crowd funding site. Integrates with Amazon payments (credit card
fees apply) 

https://open.tilt.com/ - seems to only charge 2.5% plus credit cart
fees. Probably one of the cheapest hosted crowd funding services. 

------------------ 

One of the issues of a crowd-funding platform is that it should allow
"manual overrides" - e.g. a gov organization usually just can't do a
credit card transaction, but needs an invoice with wire transfer. So any
platform we choose has to allow such flexibility. 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi devs,

Is there any plan to add MS SQLServer support to DB manager?
I notice Oracle support was added in 2.14…
I don’t have any idea of kind of work such improvement represent…
Should it be funded?

I haven't seen anyone publicly working on this, but it sure would be nice!

Funding is just one way to ensure it's implemented in a way that suits your
needs and meets your desired timeline. Otherwise options are:

1. Wait for someone else to write/fund this. (Can take a long time for a
feature like this, or it could be tomorrow... There's no way of predicting!)
2. Implement it yourself. If you're comfortable working with python this
should be relatively straightforward. It's a matter of copying what was
done for the Oracle databases and adapting for mssql.
3. Proactively seek backers/crowd source the funding yourself - if you're
good at networking and social media this is a great option!
4. Find a developer who will donate the time to implement this.

Hope that helps!

I should have added: if you go with this option there's plenty of QGIS
developers who are happy to "mentor" and give advice if you get stuck.

I'd love this!

I spent a long time researching existing crowd funding platforms
before launching the current campaign and just couldn't find one which
was enterprise-friendly enough. When I ran the layer effects
kickstarter I had a LOT of feedback from people who wanted to be able
to donate but couldn't because of various reasons, like:
- could not get approval to finance projects via Kickstarter
- could not accept payments via paypal, direct donations, or other means
- could not get approval from their organisation to "fund in advance"

That's why in the end I decided just to run this all manually, and
invoice pledgers directly when the campaign ends. Unfortunately the
side effect of this approach is that it makes a lot more
administrative work, which is why the minimum amount is required.

I hate having to cut out the micro-donations (since they are very
important!), but just couldn't find a way to meet the needs of both
individuals doing micro donations and organisations wishing to
contribute larger amounts. None of the hosted services do this, and I
shied away from the self-hosted ones (even though some open source
ones look quite attractive!) as I can't afford the time investment
required to setup/maintain these.

So in short... I'd love to have access to a more flexible crowd
funding platform which is specifically tailored to funding open source
software development!

Hi

I'm not really well informed about all available crowdfunding
platforms, btw did youevaluate "goteo"?:

https://en.goteo.org/

it is a a platfomr similar to kickstarter, but oriented to Commons and
foss based.

cheers

Yes, it helps !

Thanks Nyall

I previously looked at DB manager plugin, but not for this. I imagined that there was some C++ stuff behind (just like for providers)

So I’m going to look deeper at the plugin…

Hi all,
in the status bar the cursor coordinates are shown, but the measure
units is not. Would it be reasonable to add "m" or "deg" to the
coordinates? Would this be complex?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi all: FYI as per [1], I'd like to update OWSLib to 0.11.2 in master
to support fixes and enhancements to MetaSearch.

Given master is bound to QGIS 3, are we moving towards system-wide
packages in QGIS?  If yes is there documentation on this change?

Please advise.

I'd add that in a web context pixels are now treated as Device Independent
Pixels, i.e. if you set a px value in a CSS you won't get it mapped to the
real pixel size but to a device dependent physical value, that makes
perfectly sense in the HiDPI screens age.

I agree that  the best option would be to convert the mm to px by using the
OGC recommended DPI conversion factor.

This would be an option. But I still miss the point why that is needed:
René will probably have an answer to this question.

We already are using system-wide package were available.  I think not for
owslib as that hasn't been uptodate enough anywhere - but there are a bunch of
other internal packages that are enabled/disabled using WITH_INTERNAL_SOMETHING
depending on the availability of system-wide packages on the various targets.

Hi,
Thanks for your comments

Richard, I'll be doing it by hand for the moment, meaning that I'll create
a 2.18 milestone and put issues from master_2 inside (often duplicated in
3.0, such as https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1208 vs
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/1207; i'll then remove
the copy from 3.0 milestone)

Do you agree with this process?
Even if we do not know now if a 2.18 doc will be released, at least we'd
have kept needed elements to write it if decision is made (will require
more writers involved).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbology dialog missing icon resources when
	called from python script
Message-ID: <CANVKczO=718nR9J7BcnAQ8pq1zKJzi81Eg1Xg3BKKL5hsdA8ow@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to run the Qgis symbology dialog from a standalone python
script, and there's some error messages about icons and the icons
under the symbol layer list are blank.

I can't find any difference between the various search paths in QGIS
(where it works fine) and my script.

Full details and test script are on gis.stackexchange:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/203663/missing-qgis-icon-resources-for-symbology-dialog

I'm guessing that a crucial bit of initialisation for the dialog has
gone missing, and the resources aren't being loaded. I can't actually
work out where the resources are coming from either, I guess its all
compiled into a resources.py file at build time...

Any responses to the question on gis.stackexchange would be appreciated thanks!

Yves, with the API break due to 3.x releases, there are now two branches in
qgis/QGIS repository:
- master for 3.0 commits
- and master_2 for 2.18 commits (where there's no API break)
As already mentioned earlier in this thread, all fixes or new features in
master_2 are also present in master.

Then, with the automatic creation of issues in QGIS-Documentation repo, we
can get features from master as well as master_2 (examples in my latest
message). By default, they are labeled 3.0. All we need to do is (re)label
some of them according to the branch they belong to in QGIS repo (master
--> 3.0, master_2 --> 2.18).
For the doc writing, I think that as usual, we'll be tackling 2.16 issues
for the moment (as it's the released version) in doc master branch. One
release at a moment. The other releases are not concerned for the moment.

Dear Group,
I have just installed QGIS 2.16.0 on Windows 10 and have problems using
GRASS analysis tools. It seems that the MinGW and MSYS is not
installed. 
It seems the problem was there before in 2.12:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/183261/qgis-2-14-standalone-grass-provider-missing-msys-folder-cant-execute-tools

Is this the problem? If yes, will this be fixed soon? Can I fix it
locally by installing MinGW and adjust the path?

Thank you!

Kind regards
Klaus

That's not required for GRASS anymore.

Hi jürgen,
Thank you for your reply. The message I get is "Missing dependency -
this algorithm cannot be run". Do you have any Idea how to fix it?

>From what I can tell, the missing icons seem to be contained within
qgis executable, so if that is not loaded, the icons are not
available. I would consider this as a bug as they should be built into
qgis gui library if they are used there. For the time being to work
around your problem, you could create a qrc file, take the missing
icons from qgis source tree, use pyrcc4 to build a python module with
those resources and import it from your script - the icons should load
fine.

Harrissou,

I am ok to add a new 2.18 milestone, but take care of the work needed to 
manage two release.

I am +1 to manage 3.0 as a normal doc release, just a +0 to manage 2.18.

Where the feature will be added? in doc master? Does it mean that we need to 
only add feature for 2.18, not for 3.0 in doc master?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Globe plugin missing on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiCrghOz8=JTJH4HbV02LgXDMcT8BQpLsU7=+-b7gTRYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

After updating to 2.16 on Ubuntu, there is no Globe plugin available
anymore. My package manager only shows Globe for 2.14 even though
everything else from QGIS 2.16 seems to have installed just fine:

Which package are you using, or did you build yourself? In short, 
osgearth-2.7 is needed or else the globe plugin in QGIS 2.16+ cannot be 
built.

Yes, I get it, no problem.

So why do we need to split the ticket of the doc in two milestone? The topic 
of the thread is "Managing a future 2.18 or 3.0 documentation", so why do we 
talk about 2.16? :) Let's focus to 2.18/3.0.

Spliting ticket in two milestone needs some work for the next 3-4 monthes, I 
am not against that you managed it ;) but I am wondering what is the final 
purpose of this work if at the end, we are only managing 3.0 release for the 
documentation.

I just want to understand your point of view.

Y.

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FhUaN36oC3y-GqAA+3oOj5U_XEkgBYZXATY19fhXnWkEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

According to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9492, WMTS layers should be listed
in the browser panel, but I cannot get it to work, neither with the server
listed in the ticket

http://maps.warwickshire.gov.uk/gs/gwc/service/wmts?service=WMTS

nor with a local one

http://www.basemap.at/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml

No layers are displayed in the browser, even though adding them through the
Add WM(T)S Layer dialog works just fine.

Time to reopen the ticket?

Best wishes,
Anita

Correct.  globe is only include where osgearth 2.7 is available (ie. debian
unstable has it, ubuntugis xenial has it IIRC).

For 2.14 it's inverse, there globe is only available where osgearth<2.7 is
available.

Sandro, how maintains the plugin, decided to drop support for earlier version
in >=2.16.

As discussed, I've merged with keeping the existing functionality.  The critical

Confirmed here.

Better to open a new one because within #9492 the support for WMTS was
indeed added, now it just looks broken. Also worth checking what is
the last version of QGIS where WMTS in browser worked...

Hi,

Compared to the Singleband gray GUI, the Singleband pseudocolor GUI for
raster styling is twice as wide. This makes it difficult to use in the
styling panel.

Is anyone working on this? Should I open a ticket?

And actually, as Andreas said earlier, when 2.18 is released and if it's
the last 2.x version, then I think it's more coherent to have a 2.18 doc
than a 2.16 doc.
If there is a need of a 2.x doc after 2.14 LTR, I think it should be for
the last release in 2.x. That means being able to identify 2.x commits from
3.x ones.

Spliting ticket in two milestone needs some work for the next 3-4 monthes, I

Most of 2.18 features are likely commited in 3.0 meaning that documenting
those features is not a waste of time. All is done in a single master
(testing) branch so that work will benefit to a 3.x documentation.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Singleband pseudocolor GUI is too wide for

Hey Anita,

Having worked on reducing the width of the rendering UIs in the last dev
cycle, I'm familiar with the issue raised here :)

Basically, the singleband pseudocolor renderer's minimum width is
determined (ATM) by the "Color [ramp]" row. More specifically, if you have
a color ramp with a long label, your combo box is going to eat a lot of
horizontal space. There's a lot that can be easily done to alleviate that

There's a long-term solution that might be nice to implement: get rid of
the combo box in favor of a new widget that'd emulate the color button
widget but instead of showing a plan color it'd show the gradient selected,
and the button drop down arrow would list the color ramps and allow for
editing (and creation). That's a significant undertaking, but might be nice
to have in 3.0 :)

Hi, well, writing(!) documentation for features which landed in 2.16 and
2.18 is never wrong :-) As they will be ported to 3.0 too, so will be
documented then for the 3.0 (or 3.2) LTR version of the docs ...

But IF we want to keep if possible to release a 2.1x version (I
hope/think we should make that a LTR too then) we cannot add stuff which
only lands in 3.0 branch (which hopefully will be the case too)...
But that is off course OK: we have enough to document from 2.16 and 2.18
(master_2) branches... if all those 2.16 and 2.18 issues (IF you label
them such) are closed, and there is nothing to do, we can decide what to
do next...?

Also on my wishlist (for 3.0) is to restructure docs, by (maybe) making
all text markdown (making it easier to write), and only the index pages
rst (because then we can make index pages, toc's etc ...)
We would loose the ability to do cross reference in texts, but... maybe
if we keep the docs as flat as possible, meaning just two layers dep:
- index (rst)
-    directory
-      text (markdown)
And do the text more like 'info cards' (having deep links to parts of
it), we can use those in QGIS itself too.
All this to make it possible/easier to show the images in github and
make it easier for people to write/fix/update documentation...

Ok with this?

Regards,

Richard

​Thank you for the insights! That makes sense. Maybe as a first simple step
we could just rearrange the Edit and Invert buttons and move them below the
color ramp combo box. The combo box itself could also have a maximum size
which truncates longer ramp names.

Should I open a ticket?

Richard, Harrissou,

Thanks both. Now I understand better what meant Harrissou.

Brainstorming a little bit, we may keep working on 2.16 from which we can make 
a 2.18 branch? And cherry pick some commit from master to this branch.

As soon as 2.18 is released, we can make the big bang to the master for the 
3.0 release (ie change structure, etc). That's way we can still work on 3.0 
feature in master and have a 2.18 release.

Harrissou, would you mind to take care of the cherry pick to 2.18 branch? 
Writer should contribute to master with a label '2.18' or so to let the "2.18 
manager" know which commit to cherry-pick to the PR.

Though?

Y.

The problem with moving the [ edit ] button and the [x] invert checkbox
below the combo box is that it'd end up eating vertical space, which is as
precious and needed as horizontal spacing :)

​I'd rather scroll vertically than horizontally.

Concerning vertical space: The Layer rendering and Resampling sections
should be collapsible like the Load min/max values section. Actually, I
think Layer rendering and Resampling are probably used less than Load
min/max.

Best wishes,
Anita

Message-ID: <CAL2wmQckTQOJ3sc6vWVzUfgYuMHaQxF4Eb3Cfd61jJ2r4R1myQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

my name is Manuel Grizonnet I am a contributor to the orfeo toolbox library
and I'll attend the first part of FOSS4G code sprint from Sunday to Tuesday
in August.

Just to let you know that I would like to take the opportunity of the code
sprint to continue to work on the improvement of the integration of orfeo
in QGIS.

What I plan to do during the sprint:

- Get more familiar about QGIS processing code and OTB integration :)
- Test and integration of last otb release (5.6) in QGIS
- Continue works initiated by V. Poughon during Paris code sprint in
February [1]
- Try to see how to improve automation and testing of otb applications
integration

Hope that some qgis developers could be able to find time to discuss and
give me advises about this during the sprint.

Thanks a lot in advance and hope to see you in Bonn.

Best regards,

[1] https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/blog/page/9/

Thanks, I'm interested, count on me. I think also adding some models to
have a complete workflow will improve the attractiveness and usability
of the package.
All the best.

Hi Manuel,

me and Victor Olaya will be in Bonn during first code sprint and some
conference days. Surely we can discuss OTB integration and work
together to improve it.

Manuel,

as Alex said, I will also be there, and I will be happy to help you.

Also, I am open to collaborate and help you in the integration of OTB,
not just during the code sprint. Feel free to ask if you have
questions anytime

Cheers

	breaks plugins
Message-ID: <2c91368e-23a6-ae9d-4f9b-0641d6222346@duif.net>


Hi,

This commit
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/1a2231f10c65c2bef992e02046baebf3bc4975f6

in master renames 'QGis' to 'Qgis', bringing more consistency in
capitalization, which is good \o/

But it breaks some Python plugins,  which (often to be backwards
compatible) check for: "QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT". These now all throw
exceptions that QGis is not available.

Some notable plugins:

plugin_reloader, some of mine, timemanager, qconsolidate, but a lot more...

Off course the plugins should be fixed (because of this and other api
breaks), but I still wonder how to proceed:
- try to make (my) plugins work for both (some 'import QGis as Qgis'
within a try clause.
- not update 2.x versions anymore, and focus on 3.0

Easiest for me/other plugin devs is the second option, BUT we need a
clear path then for the two different ('latest') versions which should
be available then at plugins.qgis.org
Not sure if plugins-site can handle this already (Alessandro?)?

Or is there another alternative, or plan?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I think we need to rename the .qgis2 folder to .qgis-dev or .qgs3 so we
don't break old plugins.

I will do this tonight.

Go .qgis-dev, so we can reset when 3 is finalised.

I'm suprised it's taken this long for things to break ;) But most
likely (non-core) plugins were broken before this, just in more subtle
ways...

I'd say it's probably still too early to start updating plugins for
3.0. These breaks are likely to be an iterative thing - ie if you
start updating now, you'll likely have to duplicate work as other
parts of the API breaks are implemented.

Better to instead keep an eye on the api break documentation so that
you're aware of what's changing (also my blog series at
http://north-road.com/blog/), but hold off on actually making any
changes yet.

I'd also say it's pointless to try to make a plugin compatible with
both 2.x and 3.0 - there'll be so many if/else branches that it'll
become unmaintable. When it's time to port to 3.0, i'd suggest forking
first.

Message-ID: <a977705a-4aaf-d7f4-6d83-73c3b3ae4802@duif.net>

Hi,

downloaded 2.16.1 Windows installer, to do a fresh install (to test
Akbar's resource sharing stuff on windows....).

And found that it tries to install in
C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.16.1

I'm happy with that, but was wondering: is this by accident or by purpose?

The good news off course is that you can install 2.16.0 2.16.1 2.16.2
etc etc on one machine, but we did not do that when the install path was
'QGIS Lyon' etc....

Plz ignore this if not relevant..

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I believe the installer was modified to use the release numbers, as 
there were issues with some characters in the release package name on 
Windows (such as "Nødebo"[1]).  Therefore we now have "C:/Program 
Files/QGIS 2.16.0"

Message-ID: <CAOnR-iJz5Aw5E2SpToW-oS28Lf749qdbnDoS9YyFfn4Rj_Yc=w@mail.gmail.com>

*What did you get done this week?*

   - *Implemented style resource handler*

User can now also put style (qml file) in the collection.


   - *Fixed issues on windows*

It should be testable now on Windows. There is an issue on windows while
downloading the repository using ssh. I haven't prevented that (e.g
restricting to use https only when adding a repository in the settings -
but I guess it's easier to do this rather than checking if the host has ssh
installed)


   - *Wrote some documentation* (
   http://www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_resources_sharing/)


   - *Implemented file system handler*

User can now use repository in the local file system. The URI should have
this format: file://<path to the repo root>. On Windows it looks something
like this *file://C:/home/akbar/repo. *On linux: *file:///home/akbar/repo*.
This could be useful for:


   - Testing if the repository works fine before pushing to
      github/bitbucket (user can try to add a repo in the stting
pointing to the
      filesystem)
      - In case someone wants to use private repo, they can pull it to
      their local machine, and just use that local clone
      - Sharing the repository on the network

*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Documentation and unittests
   - Using QGIS authentication system in the settings tab when adding a
   repository (this would be easy in the case of fetching metadata from the
   repository, but might be tricky for cloning/pulling repository itself)
   - Ale and I had a talk on friday and zip repository handler might be
   useful for users (i.e the author makes a zip of the repository on publish
   it somewhere online). With the current implementation of repository handler
   (the metadata must be inside the repository itself), this might take some
   effort to implement. We don't want to download the whole zip just to get
   the metadata file. Ale's idea is to separate the metadata and in the
   metadata, additional things has to be defined: the protocol (e.g git, file
   system handler, or ftp, scp maybe in the future), and the location of the
   repository itself. I am a bit hesitant with this idea from the beginning
   (Ale already suggested this before :)) as I think the metadata and the
   repository must be in the same directory. It's nice to not have the
   protocol and the location of the repository statically defined. As I
   mentioned earlier with file system handler, user now can clone private
   repository in github/bitbucket and use file system handler. There's no need
   to change the metadata of the repository before using it (this is needed if
   we want to take Ale's idea). Anyway, I'll think about this over the weekend
   and see if I could implement this on time and still have time to polish
   things up.


*Are you blocked on anything?*
No, just need to have more opinions on the situation I mentioned above.

Have a nice weekend. Cheers!

I ran into exactly the same issues when starting crowdfunding campaigns.

What I did in addition to emails was setup a paypal button for micro
donations from which I manually updated the status bar once in a while.
Paypal allows cancelling of operations for a certain time (30 d IIRC) so
if the deadline is not too far in the future this should work out.
Of course it would be nicer if it was automated but manual updating was
just faster than setup and maintenance.

Hey Andreas,

Thanks for raising it as a issue.  I will have a look this week and do some
clean up.  I think I will make some more labels to show better status.

Sorry for the lack of focus on them.

Regards,
Nathan
