Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Ellipse marker calculated offset
Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9322EA59C3A@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi and Happy New Year

I am trying to define a symbology using an ellipse marker with a calculated offset.  The ellipse marker contains an offset field defined by x and y values.  These can be set using an field calculator, which looks like it should evaluate to an array with x and y offsets.  However this doesn't seem to be working.  I've tried using an array expression, array(10.0,0.0), and a string '[10.0,0.0]'.  But neither seem to work - the ellipse marker is not offset.  If I enter x an y values manually as 10.0 and 0.0 the ellipse is offset.

I have the same issue using a field value for the offset of a label - entering this as an expression with array(10.0,0.0) doesn't create an offset.

Does anyone know how to enter these values as an expression?

Thanks
Chris

They must be a string value, e.g. "1,2".

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is it just me, or is sip totally broken?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgXKkAGD2yoOhretpbk1Y0wH8g69rrRzn9Nx_hJRh+MyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm at my wits end here, fighting with a sip issue I can't solve. And
honestly, I'm starting to think maybe there's something completely
broken in sip. (Or at least, in the version 4.19.7 provided by my
distro).

Here's what I'm currently hitting:

The validity check registry added this week has a method "addCheck",
which transfers ownership of the check to c++:

void addCheck( QgsAbstractValidityCheck *check SIP_TRANSFER );
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/validity/qgsvaliditycheckregistry.h#L65

But if I make a Python subclass of QgsAbstractValidityCheck, and add
it to the registry, it's immediately garbage collected by Python!

My test code looks like this:

class LayoutMapCrsCheck(QgsAbstractValidityCheck):

    def __del__(self):
        print('WTFFFFFFF!!!')

    def id(self):
        return 'map_crs_check'

    def checkType(self):
        return QgsAbstractValidityCheck.TypeLayoutCheck

    def prepareCheck(self,context, feedback):
        return True

    def runCheck(self,context, feedback):
        return []

def add_check():
    QgsApplication.validityCheckRegistry().addCheck(LayoutMapCrsCheck())

add_check()


So I create a Python subclass of the interface, and then add it to the
registry. And boom - it's immediately deleted.

If I make a global copy of the check, and then add to the registry,
everything works -- the check isn't garbage collected.

check_instance = LayoutMapCrsCheck()
QgsApplication.validityCheckRegistry().addCheck(check_instance)

But this leads me to believe that sip is broken somewhere, and is
ignoring the /Transfer/ annotation.

Indeed - I've also seen this in other classes. Specifically
QgsTaskManager.addTask() -- Python tasks must be stored globally in
order to avoid them being immediately deleted too.

Can anyone else reproduce using my above code? Does anyone have any
ideas what's happening here?

It's not just you, this is what I see when running your code:


WTFFFFFFF!!!

Same issue here with slightly newer PyQt5: 5.11.3 and same SIP version...

No Clue, sorry :(

Hi,

I have a new problem with building QGIS (release-3_4 branch) on Ubuntu 18.04

$ apt build-dep qgis
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/qgis3 \
          -D GRASS_PREFIX7=/usr/lib/grass74 \

          -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
          -D WITH_STAGED_PLUGINS=FALSE \
           ..

$make
(no error)
$make install
Make Error at python/plugins/db_manager/cmake_install.cmake:41 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find

Any idea what could be wrong? Thanks, Ma

looks like building didn't run pyrcc, can you try manually running:

pyrcc5 -o
/home/martin/src/QGIS/build/python/plugins/db_manager/resources_rc.py
/home/martin/src/QGIS/python/plugins/db_manager/resources.qrc

(I tried to guess your paths)

Hi Hugo

Are the issues you mentioned solved now by your PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8724 or that was some other separate
issue?

For your open question with "click first" behavior of vertex tool as
an option - I don't know. There has been some interest to address some
ergonomic issues in the new implementation, but I am not sure yet what
we would end up doing...

Cheers
Martin

Hi Nyall

I have seen that too with other QGIS registries, but I am not sure if
it is actually broken in SIP or if this should be simply handled in a
different way.

My understanding is that SIP for an object has the "c++ part" and
"python part". If we do not deal with subclasses, things seem to work
nicely: if you pass object of type X to function "myfunc(X* x
/Transfer/)" then the object gets ownership passed to C++, and then
when in python the object gets out of scope, its "python part" get
deleted because it is not necessary anymore and only the "c++ part"
keeps on living (and will be deleted in c++ code. The trouble is when
passing derived classes with /Transfer/ where the "python part" is
actually important, but it still gets deleted.

SIP also has /KeepReference/ annotation, but it's probably not that
useful here, because it is meant to keep reference to one python
object passed through API (if I had a function addCheck with
/KeepReference/ arg annotation then the first call to addCheck(a) will
keep the reference, but the second call addCheck(b) would drop
reference to "a"). The trouble is that if we want SIP hold reference
to the python object, we would need to give it extra information about
the object's life cycle (when is it safe to release the reference). So
we would probably need a /KeepReference/ variant with a matching
/ReleaseReference/ annotation for some other function - like this SIP
could track of multiple objects (which is the case of registries) and
handle their life cycle correctly. Maybe this registry pattern is not
used anywhere in Qt so SIP does not include support for it...

A simple "fix" is to just keep the reference to the object in the
python code. Not the nicest solution I know...

Cheers

Hi all,

I have observed the same in the past.

This explanation sounds very reasonable, Martin.

Are you convinced that the proper solution will be a /ReleaseReference/ 
annotation?

I would assume that the current information is sufficient for sip / 
sipify to generate proper bindings without a new annotation.

 From what I understand, sip creates an internal subclass that forwards 
virtual methods to their python implementations. I would assume that the 
destructor of this subclass can be used to trigger the garbage 
collection / decreasing the ref counter and the reference counter should 
be increased when the object is sent through a /Transfer/ annotated 
function parameter.

If that works, there's still work to be done, but the fix wouldn't 
affect the QGIS source itself.

Message-ID: <1546860853236-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

It appears to me that in QGIS 3.4.3 (Win7) the label engine only use the
integer part of sizes at least when it comes to size of buffer and the
distance for cartographic placement:

Increasing numbers from 1mm to 1.5 mm makes no difference, first when
reaching 2.0 mm a difference is seen

I am not convinced, but for now I do not have a better idea :-)

I agree that the virtual destructors could automatically release that
held reference, so /ReleaseReference/ would only be needed in cases
like take() method where the object is not being deleted, but c++
should not hold the reference anymore.

I am not sure if /Transfer/ should automatically increase reference
counter. It would add unnecessary extra memory footprint when not
passing a derived object (if you just want to pass some simple data
objects) - in such case it is not useful to keep python references
around if they will never be used again in Python code. But this is
probably best to discuss with Phil as I am by no means a SIP expert
and there are maybe other issues that we are not aware of.

Message-ID: <CAMCJChufw=9a_rVyojpb7ASe350T10ksi7y3OYhzC2gk73aw8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

QGIS batch files in OSGeo4W are still calling GRASS 7.4.2, instead of 7.4.4:

call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\grass\grass-7.4.2\etc\env.bat

path
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-ltr-dev\bin;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.4.2\lib;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.4.2\bin;%PATH%

This happens with all versions:
qgis-ltr-dev-g7.4.2.bat
qgis-rel-dev-g7.bat
etc.

Who should fix this?

Thank you very much!

even in these cases I am hoping for an automated version for anything 
that is annotated with /TransferBack/.

This would only work in cases where the destructor of the parent class 
is virtual anyway. For other scenarios the garbage collection cannot be 
automated (at least not without a /ReleaseReference/ annotation or some 
other magic I'm not aware of right now). For classes which already have 
a vtable it could be considered acceptable to have a slightly increased 
footprint if created in Python to ensure that the C++ part holds a 
reference to the corresponding Python part after a /Transfer/ operation.

Anyway, contacting Phil is certainly a good idea.

Unfortunately, this only solves a very small part of the problem. The
overall issue of wrong cache synchronization is still there.

I understand. I am still looking for a solution here.

So instead of resurrecting the old vertex tool, would it be possible to
make it work without index/cache ?
I understand a cache has been introduced to allow for edition when lots
of geometries are displayed on the current extent. But usually geometry
editions are made at a high level of details, when a few geometry
features are visible. Is a cache still needed if we somehow enforce the
edition to be allowed only at small scale ?

Hi,

I have a similar question to this that was asked some time ago, or I want
to include gdals polygonize in my plugin to convert a raster to polygons.

As a first approach I added following code to the plugin (where "db" is a
class containing all information required to connect to a database, "s_tbl"
is the name of new table to create and "file_name_with_path" is a text
string with the path).

run_text = """gdal_polygonize.bat {file_w_path} -f PostgreSQL
PG:"host='{host}' port='{port}' dbname='{dbname}' user='{username}'
password=
'{password}'" {s_tbl}
    """.format(host=self.db.dbhost, port=self.db.dbport,
               dbname=self.db.dbname, username=self.db.dbuser,
               password=self.db.dbpass, s_tbl=self.s_tbl,
               file_w_path=self.file_name_with_path)
run = subprocess.Popen(run_text)
run.wait()

It works fine for me, but as was pointed out gdal_polygonize.bat is the
"python 2 solution".

To understand how to run the command properly with python3 I tried to
install a fresh copy of QGIS (via osgeo4w and only choose to install
qgis:desktop version 3.4.3-2) and where "gdal_polygonize.bat" isn't located
in my "bin folder", when I now tries to run the polygonize tool I get
following error:
"GDAL command output:

'gdal_polygonize.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

operable program or batch file."


If I shall use GDAL functions in QGIS3 what would be the working solution
(that works on Windows, Linux and Mac)

Thanks,
Axel

I don't think this is by design though -- see
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2018-December/041177.html
, where Phil states that Transfer is *supposed* to work as we want it
to, and avoid the deletion of the Python part.

There's also this from today (same question):

https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2019-January/041226.html

But I don't believe this is the solution -- to me it seems that our
super types are already sip.wrapper, and that this is the default (see
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/sip4/directives.html#directive-%DefaultSupertype
)

This is very complex -- if you look at the logic the GDAL Processing
algorithm uses, there's lots of special handling to get it to work
correctly cross platform. My 2c: use processing's GDAL Polygonize
algorithm instead, and let the QGIS team ensure that it works
correctly cross platform ;)

Can you elaborate? Are you referring to the rendering of the buffer,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QField 1.0 Release Candidate 1 is out!
Message-ID: <4a742e73-83ff-dd9e-af93-906d1f9fb0d6@opengis.ch>

Dear QGIS community,

It was a long and winding road but we are very excited to announce the
General availability of QField 1.0 Release Candidate 1.

Packed with loads of useful features like online and offline features
digitizing, geometry and attributes editing, attribute search, powerful
forms, theme switching, GPS support, camera integration and much more,
QField is the powerful tool for those who need to edit on the go and
would like to avoid standing in the swamp with a laptop or paper charts.

With a slick user interface, QField allows using QGIS projects on
tablets and mobile devices. Thanks to the QGIS rendering engine, the
map-results are identical and come with the full range of styling
possibilities available on our beloved QGIS desktop and server.

We ask you to help us test as much as possible this Release Candidate so
that we can iron out as many bugs as possible before the final release
of QField 1.0. You can easily install QField using the playstore
(http://qfield.org/get), find out more on the documentation site
(http://qfield.org) and report problems to our issues tracking system
(http://qfield.org/issues)

QField, like QGIS, is an open source project. Everyone is welcome to
contribute to making the product even better - whether it is with
financial support, enthusiastic programming, translation and
documentation work or visionary ideas.

If you want to help us build a better QField don’t hesitate to contact us.

On behalf of the whole OPENGIS.ch team,
Cheers
Marco

Nice stuff Marco and OpenGIS team! How about setting up a changelog project for is so that we can nicely follow the new features added over time (happy to help get that set up for you)?

Also out of curiosity what makes it a 1.0 release? I mean is there a specific featureset that you have achieved or is it more about a feeling of ‘production readiness’ that gives it the 1.0 badge?

Regards

Tim

Hi All,

I have one stupid question: how can we know who is interested in being 
nominated and who prefers to rather keep away and not be burdened with the 
voting duties? :) Maybe it's because I missed a lot of hackfests, but I simply 
don't know who wants to join QGIS.ORG.

Some of you know I'm looking for a way to be able to also represent the 
QGIS.ORG somehow when I'm representing the QGIS project here in Poland, and 
unfortunately being the voting member seems to be the only bridge between 
them. I'm sure there is a bunch of us in similar situation, much more 
deserving this position than me, so if any of you wants/needs my nomination 
for fulfilling your representative duties or any other reasons, please let me 
know to help me making the right nominations! :)

Cheers,

Borys

I have one stupid question: how can we know who is interested in being 
nominated and who prefers to rather keep away and not be burdened with the 
voting duties? :) Maybe it's because I missed a lot of hackfests, but I simply 
don't know who wants to join QGIS.ORG.

Some of you know I'm looking for a way to be able to also represent the 
QGIS.ORG somehow when I'm representing the QGIS project here in Poland, and 
unfortunately being the voting member seems to be the only bridge between 
them. I'm sure there is a bunch of us in similar situation, much more 
deserving this position than me, so if any of you wants/needs my nomination 
for fulfilling your representative duties or any other reasons, please let me 
know to help me making the right nominations! :)

Cheers,

Borys

Hi Borys

Simple answer is just to chat to the person you plan to nominate first and see if they are willing.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS as desktop/server ETL tool
Message-ID: <1546981484201-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
I am interested in using QGIS (processing models) as our main tool for ETL
tasks, i.e. automate data extraction, processing and loading. Currently,
QGIS does not seem fit for the task, although it has improved a lot in QGIS
3. Basically, I would need:

a) Improved desktop functionality (there are several examples here,
https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=o&f%5B%5D=category_id&op%5Bcategory_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bcategory_id%5D%5B%5D=131&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=tracker&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=updated_on&group_by=)

b) A server component, including a graphical interface, so that I could
schedule some of these tasks and run them on a server without user input.

Currently, we use FME for all of these tasks, but since QGIS already is our
main tool for other GIS tasks, I think that making QGIS a first class ETL
citizen makes sense and would be of great value. How do other
users/developers see ETL is QGIS? Are there any plans on, say, a
crowdfunding initiative with an ETL focus? If so, our organization might be
able to provide some of the funding.

Regards,

Magnus

I am trying to compile the qgis code from the github link
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS> using visual studio 2015 32 bit in win 10

i was able to generate qgis.exe in output folder while clicking that iam
getting error like this.

I have followed the qgis instruction for creating solution build from github

Kindly suggest any solution it would be of great help, thank you in
advance.


Thanking you,

Hi Jurgen,

Can you please take a look at GRASS 7 (Geographic Resources Analysis
Support System) plugin?

It does not show to me, both in QGIS 2.18.27 or QGIS 3.4.3 (OSGeo4W64bits).

I checked the OSGeo4W64 installer, and qgis-grass-plugin7 and
qgis-grass-plugin-common (3.4.3-2 and 2.18.27-1) were not installed.

After installing them, QGIS still does not show GRASS plugin. But I see
that the batch files created are still calling grass 7.4.2 (call
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-7.4.2\etc\env.bat").

Can this issues be related to the same question?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi, I have seen this question appear on the QGIS-Users mailing list, but with no answer (also old posts from QGIS 2.14). I'm using QGIS 3.2.0. My problem is that I can move a features vertices, but not add. This is the error that I get:
[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user-defined routine or aggregate "geometry": 
 System.FormatException: 24142: Expected "NULL" at position 112. The input has "nan,".

 System.FormatException:

 . [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]The statement has been terminated. QODBC3: Unable to execute statement


I figured that this error (Expected "NULL" and got "nan") is an internal problem and that this would be the place to put this.This error is also present in the new 3.4.3.

Thank you for your time

Ok Jurgen,

I think it is just a matter of unmet dependencies in OSGeo4W:

qgis    (3.4.3-2)
    QGIS Desktop
    Required by: qgis-grass-plugin7

qgis-common    (3.4.3-2)
    QGIS (common)
    Required by: qgis

qgis-ltr    (2.18.27-1)
    QGIS Desktop (long term release)
    Required by: qgis-ltr-grass-plugin7

qgis-ltr-common    (2.18.27-1)
    QGIS (common; long term release)
    Required by: qgis-ltr

qgis-grass-plugin7 and qgis-grass-plugin-common requires specific nightly
builds.

Is this an easy to do fix?

Thanks again!

Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] categorize using postgis hstore
Message-ID: <c0c51b79-eba9-2891-018f-1524cd15f422@posteo.de>

Hi,

i'm using QGIS 3.4 on ubuntu and want to categorize some data using hstore.

i was told (*) to use *map_get(hstore_to_map("tags"),'entrance')*, but
that does not work (for me). the result is ony one category for all nodes.

psql:

select osm_id,tags->'entrance' "tags->'entrance'"
  from planet_osm_point
 where tags ? 'entrance'
 limit 10;
   osm_id   | tags->'entrance'

So that means you just verified that the batch files were updated, but not that
it actually changed anything?  Or did you just check grass in processing?

I at least didn't even look after I saw the above.  Sorry. ;)

Hi Jurgen,

That's correct! I found the problem using GRASS in Processing, and just
checked if it was fixed in Processing (and in the batch files)!

I just realized today that GRASS 7 plugin was not there.

Hope it can be solved easily!

Best regards,
Pedro

Saving the empty looking project as a new qgz file only using Ascii
characters and then reopening this new project brings back the content :-)

So you are right - using non Ascii characters seems to be the problem.

Il will file an issue on this.

Hi,

I wish to point to couple of issues regarding WFS for latest QGIS Server
that I think need to be fixed before it can be ready for production (next
LTR):

1. DescribeFeatureType not following TYPENAME parameter
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20198

2. Can't reset numeric field using WFS Update
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20961

3. WFS issue using the EXP_FILTER parameter

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qgis2web development
Message-ID: <1547124696747-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Since all the work to convert qgis2web for QGIS3, I've done very little work
on the plugin. There is a growing list of issues, and I can't guarantee that
I'll get back to the amount of time I used to be able to put into it. I put
a shout-out on Twitter
(https://twitter.com/tomchadwin/status/1080476149896175616) and wrote a blog
post about it (https://tom.chadw.in/wrote/WhereNextForqgis2web). That got a
little interest, and some offers of help.

The reason I'm writing is to float the idea of a proper refactor of the
plugin codebase. Here are some unstructured bullets including reasons for
this, and ways in which it might be done:

- my assumption is that the code is of low quality (I was a Python beginner
when I started it), and the fundamental reason for this possible refactor is
my concern that possible poor code quality makes it harder for others to
contribute (this doesn't apply to the remains of Victor's code and Nyall's
subsequent work, obviously)

- I don't think I'm the right person to do a refactor, so I would be trying
to find someone else to do it, and it would therefore need funding (I'd
happily continue to help out voluntarily)

- OSGeo:UK might be prepared to help fund such work (initial discussion
only, so absolutely no guarantee)

- I could apply to the PSC for a QGIS grant for someone else to do the work
(as non-core-QGIS, would this be appropriate?)

- crowd-funding *might* be an option, but raising funds from end-users for
something as invisible as refactoring could well be hard

- Jo Cook (OSGeo:UK Chair) suggested I get qgis2web adopted as an OSGeo
Community Project, which could make OSGeo funding a possibility

I firmly believe that export from QGIS to webmaps remains an important
feature, and I have concerns that the lack of work on the plugin means that
it will start to fail.

So, time for a couple of specific question:

- Is anyone prepared to take a look at the codebase
(https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/)to give a more authoritative
opinion on whether a refactor would benefit the plugin (specifically with a
view to making it easier for other devs to contribute)?

- If a refactor is valuable, are any devs interested in doing the work, if
funds can be found?

- If so, broad indicative costing is going to be necessary in order to set
funding targets.

I know this could be seen as peripheral to the normal business of this list,
so apologies if it is too off-topic for any of you. It's just something
which has been of concern to me for some time.

Thanks

Tom

Looking for candidates is not exactly what I mean. I rather wonder if public 
nominations and then voting on them wouldn't be more transparent and 
encouraging to participate.

Hi,

May I join the discussion?

The OSGeo does this same process [1] every year. I think we can take
advantage of the experience and use a similar procedure, which is
absolutely transparent.

Every year a CRO [2] is nominated to run the process as independent as
possible (from the board/PSC), the nominations are validated by the CRO
and published on the wiki, and afterwards, people allowed to vote can
review the motivations for each nominee and vote accordingly.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi Jurgen,

GRASS Plugin is back again to nightly builds! Checked in QGIS 3.4.3-12 and
2.18.27-4.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

I totally agree with you that we should keep this functionality in QGIS.
I think a reasonable amount of funds can be found to support the work on
it. My main concern is to find someone interested and available
All the best.

Hi all,
so are you suggesting that:
* the call for nominations should be done by a non PSC member (now it's
a PSC member doing this)
* make nominations public from the start (we currently disclose them
after collecting them).
For the first one I frankly don't see any issue.
For the second one, having a short buffer does not seem a real problem
for me; could you please elaborate?
Thanks.

Hello QGIS dev list,

This is a general question about attending the QGIS Developer Conference in
Coruña in March. I don't have any experience with C++, and so wanted to see
if that was the exclusive focus, or if there will be work being carried out
on in Python and on the Documentation where I would be able to contribute.

Having recently moved to Spain I wanted to take advantage of coming along.

All the best,
Will

the hackfests are by no means a developer-only gathering. If you are
willing to help, there are plenty of things to do, so you are definitely
welcome.
See you in A Coruña!

Hi Paolo,

I don't see this process as a problem, but as an opportunity to build a
better community. That's why this process exist, to recognize and reward
the most dedicated members.

I would put the question in the other way: why can't we make the
nominations public from the start? Is it a problem?

Marco had to send a reminder for the nominations. Why? In my opinion, if
the nominations started as a public process, more people were involved
from the beginning. Soon as the first nomination appeared, others
nominations would came.

In summary: I don't think this is a problem but we should take all
opportunities to foster collaboration, transparency and open communication.

See you soon,

Jorge

For me it's perfectly fine if the PSC member calls for the nominations. 

I prefer the nominations to be public, for the reason Jorge mentioned: 
encouraging more people to make nominations.

But first of all, I'd organize voting for nominated candidates instead of just 
counting private nominations. I believe it would involve much 
more committers to vote.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Proposal for QGIS Documentation
Message-ID: <6e28910e-47f1-5441-dbba-55d2ef80d5cc@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to raise some proposal for the documentation process of QGIS. I
think that we can all agree that the documentation is our weak part: no
matters if we have some budget or not, but even with sponsors, docs are
months away to be up to date with the code. We have an endless list of
issues that grows and grows.

BTW: this is nobody fault, we are just to few doc writers, that's it

Furthermore there are some PR stacked from months [0] (with and without
reviews).

What I want to propose is a system similar to the coding one: a kind of
stale bot that closes PR automatically after a while. Actually I'd like
to go a step further: if the PR is made by a person with writing rights
than the PR is automatically merged (if the Travis is happy) while if
the person has not commit rights, then the PR is closed automatically to
prevent really ugly docs (not sure if this is achievable).

I think we spent a lot of efforts on "appearance" of the docs rather
then contents (again, nobody fault, just me that prefers contents than
appearance).

Personally I'd prefer to have updated manuals and correct all the rest
in a second moment. With the fix me button on each page and with
Alexandre's features that allows to see images directly on the repo it
is definitely more easy also for not skilled people to correct some
mistake than to add new text from scratch.

I'm repeating again: this is not an attack on anyone, it is just what
came into my mind: AKA my 2 cents ;)

Hoping to start a discussion

Cheers

Matteo

I'm forwarding this thread to developer mailing list, as it seems more
apropriate.

I agree in accepting PRs, either automatically or manually, after a
reasonable delay. A week seems OK for me.

Hi!

I’d like to increase the size of the list in relation reference widget. Currently it shows only first 100 items, but in my case it’s quite far from enough. I’d like to set it to a bigger number, ideally to the whole range of available features in other layer. Is this possible?

Hi all,
I'm interested in seeing how our bugfixing and bug opening activity is
going. Would it be possible to install a statistics system, e.g.
https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_stats ?
Thanks.

Hi all again,

really nobody has some feedback to give on doc topic?

Cheers

It could be nice to have some pull requests hanging around for
a longer time.

Currently there are two documentation pull request that target
version 3.6.  They should be kept on hold until 3.4 (LTR) is
branched out.
So an automatic job should consider the milestone.

Merging should also be delayed while the pull request is being
discussed, so with a one week (or other) rule, the "timer"
should be restarted when there is input.

I had a look at that page, it is 4 years old, and updates the database
schema? Anybody experience with this or anybody wants to fix the
database if anything goes wrong ;-)
(Maybe try at the hackfest after a db backup, not we run Redmine 2.5.2)

thanks for your reply (and glad also Nyall is intersted - I really think
this should make part of our quality control strategy).
The plugin I mentioned was just an example. I see there are many, e.g.:
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=redmine+statistics&t=ffab&ia=images
Selecting the most appropriate is an important part of the job.
Unfortunately, many are not free, but I do not think we need very fancy
stuff- the rate of opening and closing tickets over time is probably the
most important thing. Any Redmine expert around?
All the best.

If for some reasons we want to keep a PR open we can just write a "ping"
comment to have some activity rather that a stale

So to make a brief summary:

* automatic merging if the PR author has write rights on the repo
* merging should consider milestone
* not merging if some activity?

other comments?

Cheers

Matteo

it makes sense to me. I'd add making sure the automatic merges are
echoed e.g. on qgis-doc ML, to make sure nothing is overlooked.
All the best.

Hi,

I found this:

seems pretty straightforward to use (I'll make some test on test
repositories).

Somebody has already experiences on this side?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] segmentSide and leftOfLine functions
Message-ID: <7421f423-a1d0-c50f-8814-fb26d9a59fe9@terglobo.nl>

Since 2 months there's a new function called leftOfLine() which 
calculates if a point is left or right from a line(segment). While using 
it I wondered why:

It returns
-1 if point is on left side
1 if point is on right side

cause I would expect the opposite result, or call the function 
rightOfLine().



When diving into this, I also found the function segmentSide() which 
calculates the exact same (but having a better name).


Here they are

segmentSide:

Am I missing something or should this be fixed?

Hello,
maybe I don't catch the right meaning of proposals, but I think we could
put in better use GitHub by using its API (
https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/).
Sorry for misunderstanding if it happens.

Hi,

I am sorry for the late reply, I have just noticed this discussion.

I agree that we have a long time issue with Documentation. To me, it can
only be solved with someone working on it "full-time", Which seems to be
the case if Larissa starts working on it.

On the other hand, we have the review part, which is something that even
fewer people participate (me included), and it takes forever...

I am not very enthusiast of the automatic merging and closing of PRs.
People have different velocities, and I don't think it's good to close a
someones PR (that put some good work on it) just because no one with merge
rights was able to review it. It is very discouraging.

On the other hand, if the person has commit rights, then technically he can
merge it himself , when he feels the work is ready (assuming that, like
Matteo said it's not breaking anything), without the need for a bot. I
still think that a review would be is required... Just like it happens in
the Code side. Maybe Larissa can also review PRs?! That would speed thing
up.

Now, I believe that we should not have opened tickets forever with hundreds
of comments in it.

The geoserver team uses the following rule:

- At least one review is needed (beg it to a friend if needed)
- After addressing all the ISSUES found on the first review, the committer
can merge. He should not wait for a second review to see if the new changes
are ok, and then again and again...
- Any "good to have" observations/comments, should be moved to a new ticket
for future improvements.

My 5 cents,

Alex Neto

Hi Alexandre,

thanks for the inputs.. :)

+0. We already have many many commits and PR each day since a lot of
time. Of course people are interested/involved in different topics and
anyone contributes in the way he/she thinks is better. Therefore, review
is of course not the most interesting part... (at least I prefer to
write new doc from scratch than reviewing)

> On the other hand, we have the review part, which is something that even

+10000

We had PR stacked fro months and as I said, merging clean PR (clean =
not breaking anything) is better: also new people can fix errors and/or
improve the docs with the Fix me button without dealing with
git/sphinx/compilation and so on..

I'm not happy too. But IMHO is worst to have PR with hundreds of
comments or PR left there for months. This could be also very
discouraging (not only for new people making the first step into the
project).

I'm digging into this github app topic and it seems that setting up one
or more bots is more or less straightforward. Some of them allows to
mark a PR not mergable if at least one review is made. I don't know what
workflow is better to make things NOT complicated AND to speed up the
process WITHOUT loosing documentation quality.

For sure it is a good chance to discuss in the next HF

My 10 cents :)

I think the suggestion was to automatically accept and merge them if nobody
with merge rights gets around to doing it.

No. the proposal was to automatically merge PRs from people with commit
rigths and close PR from people that have not.

Hi Devs,

As I see we are in a "Documentation crisis" and seeing the comment below
in a discussion (please do not take this personal!!!):

"""
No. From my side it's no documentation PR planned at the moment. Feel
free to do something and to take the stuff from my blogpost.
"""

I think our project has to do something. Even throwing money at people
(we did as PSC!) does not help...

I'm really afraid QGIS will end up with a lot of HIDDEN features and
possibilities. A lot of it's functionality is hiding because it isn't
mentioned in the QGIS docs or blogs (maybe in other (company) blogs),
but only in the code ...

I do not want to be a PITA, but can we maybe add a mandatory requirement
for a pull request that in case of a new feature the dev adds some
mandatory Text and Images about the feature IN the PR?

He/she can also ask a community member to do that by giving some interview.

It is really NO fun for doc writers to find a [FEATURE] issue in the doc
writing issues list. He/she has to start guessing how it was
implemented, try it out, or google for some blogpost or start talking to
the dev etcetc. Really NO fun if you want to work on the documenation
because it takes so much time!

I think implementing developer is just the best person to write one or
two paragraphs (and add some images, hey he has also tested during
coding isn't it?).
In this way doc writing could then be just 'copy and paste' the text, do
some grammar fixes and add images from the PR of the dev in the docs.

I know a project like MapProxy handles it's PR's even more rigid: if
Documentation is not part of the code PR, it is just nog pulled. It is
easier there because they have text only docs IN the src tree; that is
why I propose to do only text + images.

I know this is an old idea, but seeing one dev asking about already
implemented features to another dev was the drop...
And I'm aware that you cannot prevent this anyway.... as nobody likes to
RTFM :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

nope. What I'm suggesting is to automatic merge PR made by author having
commit rights on the repo after a while and to close (or putting into
stale) PR made by "external" people if there is not activity for a while.

This could speed up the cue of PR and prevent eventual breaking of docs.

Cheers

Matteo

Random idea: could we code up a test on Travis which checks if a PR
has the feature tag (or "feature" in the commit message), and rejects
if the commit message doesn't meet certain criteria?

Past experience has shown that policies which Travis enforces for us
are much more successful than ones we just decide.

Hi Richard,

It is something to consider - I agree that we have a documentation crisis.

On the other hand - I never see any QGIS user reading/consulting that 
manual we provide (because it is hard to read a manual) - that's why I 
sometimes - if a question from a user about feature x is raised - I 
don't answer directly but point to the chapter in the manual - just to 
show users, that they should first read that manual, then Google and 
consult stack exchange and then only ask if the other information 
sources don't help. Or attend a course ...

Perhaps there are also other forms to consider besides the manual to 
reveal hidden features?

The visual changelog is a good resource to find out about new and hidden 
features - but even that is often only a title and no text and screenshot.

Let's discuss it in A Coruna at the meeting. Perhaps we should try your 
proposal, even if I expect some resistance from some devs/customers.

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi Carlo,

unfortunately (personal opinion) the issue tracker is not on github but
on a redmine instance so we can't use the api stats nor the integrated
pulse dash board like in https://github.com/opengisch/QField/pulse

There have been endless discussion in that sense without ever reaching a
consensus, therefore at the last PSC meeting we decided that I should
take the lead on this discussion.

Cheers Marco

In case nobody objects, I'd suggest implementing this soon, during HF at
latest, better before.
All the best.

Totally agreed:
* pushing at least a minimal documentation has to be a requirement, just
like unit tests
* an automatic system is far preferable to a manual one.
Topic added to the TODO for the HF:

Thanks.

Since most seem to agree with the bot implementation, can we do it in a way
that:
- the PR owner (and other watchers) receive a message warning that the PR
is going to be closed with some time to act;
- Not automatically merging PRs, but warn the owner (and watchers) that the
owner (if with commit rights) can merge the PR because of not having active
reviews/comments for a while?

Can we also make possible to reactivate a PR once a new comment is done? I
am thinking about the new contributers that see their PR being closed and
have no way to Open it again. If they know no one, their work may be lost.

BTW, how much time of inactivity should trigger the bot? 2 weeks a warning,
3 weeks close?

Best regards,

Alex

Hi Marco,

Glad to know that you are taking the lead of this discussion to move
issues away from redmine.

Last year, in Madeira, we have (another) discussing about the subject.

Vincent strongly support the move to GitLab. As I remember, he already
did something on GitLab and was quite confident about the results. If
Vincent is able to come, better.

If you agree to discuss this again, may I open a "Move to GitLab" stream
in the Coruña meeting wiki? That would allow us to prepare a demo
related to issue management and CI (testing and deploy).

Thanks for raising this issue (again).

See you soon,

Jorge

well nobody agreed that "Move to GitLab" is what the plan should be. You
can open an "issue infrastructure" stream if you want.

Well to be fair, in this (and many) other cases, the "Naughty Dev"
provided an amazingly well written description of the feature. That can

But yes, I think minimal docs, or maybe a changelog entry or a link to a
blogpost would be good

Cheers

Marco

My 2 quick cents:

1 - new features or significant changes to existing features *must* provide
a description of the feature/changes or a link to it in some form (a QEP,
the PR text, a blog post an extensive commit message etc., suitable for
copy-paste into the documentation)
2 - little documentation is better than no documentation at all. I suggest
that the documentation team be less strict in accepting PRs and lower the
bar: we/they can always make it better later
3 - (speaking about the server) consider the audience: we do not need/want
to document the standard apache/nginx/fcgi/mod_rewrite/whatever web-server
setup, but we may provide pointers to upstream documentation

Hi

In QGIS 3.x we have the nice integration with the advanced digitising panel for lines and polygons. Do we have any capability to capture a point by entering coordinates? In 2.x we had the numerical vertex editor plugin but that isn’t available in 3.x yet.

Regards

Tim

The Lat Lon Tools plugin does this. Select a point layer that is editable
and then you use "Lat Lon Digitize"

With the vertex tool enabled, right click on a vertex and then you can
enter X and Y.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] confirmation message after plugin upload
Message-ID: <CAKAVu9TBPP3enH6KF0-DL9EDnR=9mBCmwq32NjViNVOh6_=dhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have just uploaded to the QGIS plugin repository my first plug-in.

After having read all the documentation, provided a LICENSE a README and
having filled the metadata.txt file I zipped it and uploaded via the upload
page.

As a confirmation I get a white page that says "You cannot modify this
plugin". White page with just a just this message on top.

Does this mean that the upload was successful or not? And if not, what
could I do to upload a plugin correctly?

Thanks

Alessandro

I'm +1 to the policy, BUT...

in reality this is just moving part of the workload from the
(overworked) documentation team to the (overworked) PR review team.
Instead of just reviewing the code we'll also be responsible for
ensuring that the commits have good documentation or that a
documentation PR has also been submitted. It may seem like a minor
thing, but every non-code thing we have to police results in less
stringent CODE reviews.

We used to see this with documentation and Python bindings. We (the PR
reviewers) would spend a lot of time just pushing submitters to add
code doxymentation and updating bindings (and running code styling
scripts). I (personally) would end up feel bad about picking apart
contributions based on all these other criteria, and as a result
wasn't as strict on code conventions and minor code improvements as
I'd have like to be.

Now that Travis is that "bad guy" with respect to doxymentation,
Python bindings, and code formatting, it leaves the PR review team
more space to be strict about code quality.

So again, I'm +1 to the policy, but only if it's enforced
automatically on Travis by an appropriate meta unit test.

**

I think we could do this by some rules like:
- if a commit message has [feature] or [needs-docs], then the body of
the message must contain at least 200(?) characters OR contain a link
to a PR on the documentation repo (detected via regex)
- feature commits must also contain a link to an image/video/blogpost
illustrating the feature (the test would just check to ensure that
there's at least one http(s):// link in the commit body). We can add a
specific [no-pic] tag for features which explicitly DON'T need a
picture (e.g. API feature additions, server specific features which
don't have any user-facing UI changes)

Should be fixed -- looks like needless duplication to me. One of the
methods should be deprecated and tagged for removal in QGIS 4.0.

(Don't deprecate the method which accepts double arguments -- we don't
want to force construction of QgsPoints if they aren't already
available)

Did you check if a plugin with the same name already exists?

I'd prefer having all the material in the manual. external links can
break anytime, and after a while we'll end up with lots of dead links.

all the best.

yep! we should find a way to make life easier for both teams without
loosing quality and features

That's seems a good strategy. Details can came up later but I really
like this approach

Can't leftOfLine() be removed before the 3.6 release? Hasn't been used 
too much yet, I think. Is it possible to find out who added it?

I tried git blame but I'm not much of a git guru.

Yes, a plugin with the same name already exists but it is not for version 3
and above (the name does not appear in the plugins list). I asked the
developer of the original plugin if I could use the same name, he agreed so
I did use it. The plugin contains indeed improvements respect to the
current version, so it made sense to call it the same. As it does not
appear in the official QGIS 3 repository I thought it should not have been
a problem. I will try to think about another name and upload it again.
Thanks

Hi,
it would be better to keep both versions in the same repo, if possible,
to avoid duplication and confusion among users.
Thanks.

Just a quick note to say that, after some discussion with (and help from)
Matteo, I've started to try to help out with English style and grammar. I'm
not an experienced enough QGIS user to create much new documentation, but
hopefully this will help. Other documentation contributors, please be
patient with me as I learn the workflow.

Tom

having native English speaker is super important for us. Thanks for the
availability!

P.S. I'll assign the review of my next PR to you ;)

Hi,

I would like to change theme in Lizmap. In particular, many of us doesn't
like the red icons (zoom in, out, pan, etc...).
It's possible?

Thank you in advance

Hi Luca,

In the back-office, you can change some images and colors.
If it's not enough you can write some CSS in this page.

You can also use media to define a specific theme for a directory or a map :
https://docs.lizmap.com/current/en/publish/advanced_lizmap_config.html#media-in-lizmap
https://docs.lizmap.com/current/en/publish/advanced_lizmap_config.html#creating-simple-themes

Finally, you can use Jelix themes to overwrite the whole theme :
* https://docs.jelix.org/en/manual/themes
* https://docs.jelix.org/en/manual/overloads

Regards,
René-Luc

Message-ID: <9faa14e6-2757-2a33-3e94-b599dde8fbba@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
after loading a grib, if I style the arrows in white, with the Layer
rendering: Fusion, the resulting PNG does not display the arrows,
whereas they are displayed correctly in the canvas.
Am I missing something, or this is a bug?
Thanks for comments.

Hi Paolo,

Did you try then option for arrows: Display Vectors on User Grid
You can have more arrows by decreasing the values on X and Y spacing (it is
done by interpolating the actual values).

Maybe having more arrows will result in something appearing in the output?

Regards
Saber

Hi Saber,
thanks for your reply. I did many tests, and to me the picture is clear:
the arrows are always displayed on the canvas. On the other hand, they
are not exported when the Layer rendering is set to Fusion and the
colour is white.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I can't see Fusion for rendering. I tested it with Addition:

and the result:

Hi Paolo,

For Multiply to work, it seems you need to have a Contour quantity
displayed. Not sure if it is a bug or a feature! :)

Thanks
Saber

Sorry, I can't confirm. In the images you can see the contour displayed.
IMHO it is a bug, because what is shown on canvas should be also
exported without missing an information.
Would you agree?
Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] connecting to QgsNetworkAccessManagers signals
Message-ID: <f8f6defe-8cc1-aae3-04a6-4dc187792cfd@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I'm doing a simple small proof of concept of a minimal plugin which
connects to the QgsNetworkAccesManager.instance()'s signals to log the
requests that are fired and show them in de message panel.

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgisnetworklogger

This is going fine for wms and wfs requests or python stuff which uses
the same instance.

But other parts of QGIS apparently use another instances?
Or can there another reason I do not connect to their signals?

Eg for a WMS I see the GetCapabilities en GetLegendGraphic, but not the
actual WMS requests, while you can see them in the debug messages if you
have debug enabled.

Same with WFS and WMTS tile requests.

I think for the average OGC-service-user it would be good to be able to
see /try out the requests that are fired.

Or is my poc too simple :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps WFS is showing the following in the Qt message tab:

WARNING    QObject: Cannot create children for a parent that is in a
different thread.
             (Parent is QgsWFSFeatureIterator(0x7f46ac05c7d0), parent's

I didn't look at the code but maybe it's because the NAM instance is
per-thread and WMS/WFS downloaders run within threads.

Yeah, that is what I'm afraid of...
I just do QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance() which get's it from current
thread.

And (from what I understand) most providers do not keep an handle to
some NAM :-(

There is no way to QgsNetworkAccessManager what instances are running in
different threads?

Hi devs

I face a (IMHO) an API limitation that I'm not sure is a limitation of a
feature :)

I'm working adding SLD export for rasters as new feature and some
stretching (QgsContrastEnhancement) should be mapped differently if the
min/max values has been modified from the real min/max of the image.

This can be simply asked to the raster with QgsRasterLayer.statistic(<band
number>). The main problem I'm faced is that if statistic is not present it
is ALWAYS calculated.
This means that if we have big images or a remote one (e.g. COG) this would
take long time!
I do not analysed any raster provider, but I suppose that min/max values
can be estimated asking to raster metadata.

IMHO we can have an API like
QgsRasterLayer.estimatedStatistic(<band number>)
or
QgsRasterLayer.statistic(<band number>, estimated=false)

that can return metadata values if available.

The proposal is valid if there is no a method to get estimated statistic,
but I could be wrong and that's the reason of this post.

Hi Luigi,

I cannot be of help, but I think I had exactly this problem then you,
when there is a OGC-WCS service with for example a huge DEM/height model.

And after that QGIS is requesting several times for one extent some
portion of the data (while this server is very slow on this)
I was thinking about a possibility to NOT do this everytime (or at least
give an option to do it ONLY on the real data available already by QGIS).

Does this fit your problem?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps anybody willing to play with such a dem:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Widget type

Hi devs,

 

How can I create or change a Field with the Widget type to "Text Edit"?

 

I had tried with code below:

 

pipeLyr = iface.activeLayer()

campo = "DNteste"

DNfld = QgsField(campo, QVariant.Int)

pipeLyr.addAttribute(DNfld)

pipeLyr.updateFields()

field_index=pipeLyr.fields().indexFromName(campo)

#pipeLyr.setEditorWidgetSetup(field_index,'Text Edit')

pipeLyr.editFormConfig().setWidgetConfig(field_index, 'EditText')

 

But I got:

 

QgsEditFormConfig.setWidgetConfig(): argument 1 has unexpected type 'int'

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Jorge Almerio

I there an API call in QGIS that will take a UTM formatted string (ie 11N
345567 432145) and convert it to a lat and lon as well as going the other
direction? It certainly supports the UTM projections but I don't see this
conversion. There are python libraries have have this in them.

The reason I ask is that there is interest in this being a part of Lat Lon
Tools and I would like to find the easiest way to do this.

Hi all,
I'm trying to make more automatic the download of grib files, e.g. from
https://marine.meteoconsult.fr/cartes-meteo-marine/fichiers-grib.php

I have various issues:

not shure if it's the same... not sure if the requests are for band
statistics or background image prefetch of an extended canvas view
(introduce 1y ago if I well remember)

you can simply check if bandSatatisti is available or triggered doing it
with (ir R is the QgsRasterLayer)

renderer = R.renderer()
renderer.hasStatistics(1) # True or Flase; 1 is the band number
stat = bandStatistics(1) # this would trigger remote reading if false step
before

bandStatistic is a QgsRasterInterface (e.g. the provider), so any provider
can implement statistic calc in different way...

You are right, but how to use "setEditorWidgetSetup" method?

>From doc reference:
QgsVectorLayer::setEditorWidgetSetup (int index, const QgsEditorWidgetSetup & setup) 	

The first argument is the field index, ok, it's easy.
But second is a QgsEditorWidgetSetup, I don't know how to create one.


My code:
pipeLyr = iface.activeLayer()
field_index = 3 #here just for test
pipeLyr.setEditorWidgetSetup(field_index,'EditText')

I got:
TypeError: QgsVectorLayer.setEditorWidgetSetup(): argument 2 has unexpected type 'str'

I'm not aware of any existing algorithms which do this - but it sounds
like a great idea!

Tech details:

I think we'd need to pair this with another algorithm which would
allow a list of files to be filtered by a file pattern, to find a
particular matching file. You'd need some way of getting the correct
output from the zip file (unless it was consistently named?)

Not that I'm aware of. I think you'd best be served by using a regex
to parse the particular input string you want and extract the zone,
easting and northing, and then setup a QgsCoordinateTransform to
convert from the detected UTM zone to WGS84. Should be ~5-10 lines of
code to do, without needing any additional Python libraries.

It'd need to be a change made in the core code -- the signals from the
background threads would need to be "bubbled up" to the main thread
instance of the manager.

But we aren't requiring that the code PR comes with a documentation
PR, are we? I was thinking more that if the original code commit has a
link to a blog post, the documentation team would have a detailed
write up (likely with pictures) which they could use as a basis for
the actual QGIS documentation to be written from.

Now that 2.18.28 is tagged and will be released soon, can we get
official confirmation that 2.18 is indeed done and no longer
officially supported?

If so, what's the plan with the website and removing download links,
etc? Will that happen after a month when 3.6 is released?

Yes, I think we developer should provide the documentation in any form
(text in the code PRs, blog posts, links to emails, QEP, whatever works
best).

The important part is that the source material for the documentation
writers must be easily available somewhere.

I don't think we are enforcing this requirement - I'm in favour of doing
it anyway. Surely blog post can be a good source to understand how a
function works, but maybe we should ask to provide at least a short
description of how the function works, and at least a screeshot where
appropriate?
All the best.

good idea too, would you like to open a ticket? Or maybe it's faster for
you to implement it than to note it down ;)

Meaning (?), that wherever now a signal of the nam
(NetworkAccessManager) is connected to some local method, it is also to
be connected to the nam of the parent/application thread?

I had a look into some providers, but do not understand where this
connection between signals is to be made?

Is it in the application main thread when you create some
downloader-class that you add some extra 'connect'-calls?

Or is it in the downloader-class that you can fetch the
parent/application thread and then get the nam-instance from there and
do the connection?

Or should I not even try :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

2.18 is officially no longer supported.

No, the links will be updated once the packages are ready.  The ltr package
repositories will have 3.4 and the latest release repositories 3.6.  The
download links will just reflect that.

Hi Alessandro,

THANKS !!!!

Works flawlessly!

Now you see all WMS/WFS/WMTS/WCS/Locator/version.txt/plugins.xml/plugins
itself etc etc http requests that QGIS fires to the servers! Much easier
to copy the url to your browser and test it. Eg in case a
getLegendRequest of a WMS is failing, or you see no data from a server
request.
No More Black Boxes ( NMBB :-) )

Two idea's that I hope somebody has an idea for:

-1- now the plugin creates html-links in the Log Messages Panel, and
they are rendered as links, but you cannot CLICK them and open them in a
browser. I was hoping to be able to test the links by just clicking on
them. Anybody a clue?

-2- it would be nice if you can 'lock' a tab in the Log Messages panels,
so if you are looking at one tab, others will not pop up in front of the
(in your view) most interesting tab...

Anyway, Thanks Alessandro! I'll do a Pull Request ASAP.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi list,

Given that we have finally dropped support for 2.18, I have a couple
of questions about redmine:

1. Can we remove the 2.x options from affected versions for new
tickets, so that users can no longer file bugs against these versions?

2. Is there anyway to mass-update bug reports? I'd like to see any
open bug which is has an affected version of 2.x changed to
"feedback", with a message "please test with QGIS 3.4 -- 2.18 is no
longer supported". Is this kind of thing possible? Potentially we can
mass close nearly 1000 bugs by doing this and then (automatically?)
closing after a month if no feedback is obtained.

In the issue list there is a context menu.  Done.

Not sure if there is a automatism for this.  Bu we can filter issues and mass
update them.

Unfortunately not in this case -- I think to do this properly we need
a new processing output type for a list of files, and a method to set
the file input parameter to accept multiple files (possible with layer
parameters, but not generic files at the moment). So there's a few
prerequisite steps to do first.

So can I safely do this for the 288 issues tagged as feedback which
haven't been updated since 2018-12-01?

At least that's a huge drop in the code maintenance burden for us all.

Sounds good! Now we just need to be diligent on redmine,
stackexchange, twitter etc to let users know that 2.18 is EOLed, and
they NEED to move to 3.4.

Agreed - this should make debugging a lot simpler.

Although -- I wonder if the log panel isn't the most appropriate here.
Maybe time to resurrect some of Nathan's ideas for a "dev mode"
switch, which opens a new set of chrome-style dev tools panels showing
stuff like this.

Could also integrate
https://gist.github.com/nyalldawson/6168df740d01ce667fdcf12ef946084d -
which is ripped from Martin's First Aid plugin and adds a dock showing
python local variables.

Yeah, I was just playing around a little with the possibilities. Logging
clickable links in the Message panels was just easiest to do (after
printing to python console :-) ).

I also tried to add (potentially) more info to the log, eg by showing
headers or the sent data if it is a POST, but my feeling is that a lot
of that isn't passed to either the QtReply or Response classes that we
receive via the signals?

I'm very much open to have a special 'debug' mode with firefox-style ;-)
panel (which potentially makes QGIS slower). And I really like Martin's
First Aid plugin too.

But have to dive into this a lot more then: mix the Python Console with
some advance html for the network logs? Or create our own qt based debug
window/panel?
Maybe create a QEP for it, so we can discuss this further in public? I
can do that (or Nathan if he thinks he already thought about this a lot).

I was hoping that the 3 linse of change in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8907 could be seen as a bug to land in
3.6 :-)
But this plugin is then a first step and can be obsolete when we have
more... for OWS-service users I think this simple setup already is a
cool start.

Thanks all for input and help!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <d760cca1c1200c9db7a22291ee543281@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have a requirement that our QGIS server has to serve WFS 1.1.x in the
future. 

At
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html
there is the statement that QGIS server support WFS 1.1.0 

I assume this is true for version 3.x of QGIS - server  - right? Version
2.x did not support WFS 1.1.0? 

How is version 3.x doing with OGC compliance regarding WFS 1.1.0? 

Thank you if you have any hints, 

Andreas

Strange stats though:

I think we have a classification or reporting issue.
All the best.

OK, thanks. Would you mind to open a ticket with these thoughts?

I just wanted to say a big thanks to Richard et al for this - I've very much
needed it in the past, and this would have made my life a whole lot easier.

Morning all

I wanted to check on this. If 2.18 is now "unsupported", and 3.4 is not yet
LTR (my understanding was that this happens when 3.6 is released), does that
not mean we have no current supported LTR? This is far from ideal for people
like me with a moderate LTR userbase. Should "old" LTR not continue to be
supported until new LTR is established? To put it another way, shouldn't the
last point release for old LTR happen on the day that new LTR comes into
existence?

I'm sure this is all just down to me misunderstanding things, but I don't
like the idea of having to choose between unsupported old LTR, or a version
which has not yet become LTR.

Thanks

Tom

It's just wording really. 2.18 is STILL the LTR until next month, and
will be "maintained" in that it will be available for install for that
month. But there's no point filing bugs against 2.18, because they'll
never be fixed now. So in that regard it's "unmaintained", and it's
better to file bugs against the future LTR (3.4).

OK, fine. I think "unsupported" is not the right term, and probably
shouldn't be used in this particular case. It's an occasion when more
explanation is probably required, in my opinion:

"Although 2.18 remains the LTR until [DATE], no further bugfixes are planned
for the QGIS2 branch. This is because the next LTR will be QGIS3.4. Bug
reports raised against QGIS2 will no longer be investigated, so please test
any problems you experience with QGIS3."

Something like that, anyway. I just don't like the possible implication that
we are knocking off a month early, by no longer "supporting" the LTR.

Thanks

Tom

Both are LTRs since their release.  But 2.18 has seen it's last point release -
so there won't any more fixes - in that sense it's now unsupported.

But it's still downloadable and installable until the current release 3.4,
which is also LTR, is replaced by the next release 3.6.

We run two package repositories (for Debian/Ubuntu and Windows) because we
usually have a current and a LTR release.  Currently the latest LTR and the
current release are identical.  It doesn't make much sense to me to put the
same version in two repositories and hence we keep the LTR that is different
from the current release in the long term package repositories, while the
latest LTR is also the current release.

But that doesn't make 3.4 less an LTR.

Right the opposite - we're already maintaining the LTR longer than we promised
to - as the original plan didn't include to maintain the previous LTR, while
there's already a new one.

Hi Juergen

I guess I've been misadvising people, then. My understanding was that 3.4
did not become LTR until 3.6 was released. I based this on explanations from
others, and also on my interpretation of
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule.

Anyway, as I say, I think it's just an occasion where choice of language is
important. I think that describing 2.18 as "unsupported" before 3.4 becomes
LTR (or the only LTR, according to your description), has the potential
needlessly to ring alarms.

Anyway, as always, thanks for the amazing work. It will be a relief to put
2.18 to bed.

Tom

Message-ID: <9d7cf36e7043fbb0814b4994d8b1a4e7@carto.net>

Hi, 

When migrating our version 2 to version 3 projects, most of our
symbology needs revision, because our data-defined properties used a lot
the "$scale" variable. 

What is the exact reason that $scale fails in version 3 and had been
replaced by @map_scale? 

Is there really no upgrade path for this? We have many, many projects,
and almost all of them need to be upgraded in version 3 to use
"@map_scale" instead of "$scale". 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

I think the easiest approach is to search and replace in the project files.

Expressions are in so many places in QGIS, it's close to impossible to
write code that finds them all and updates.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why is .qgz the default format?
Message-ID: <26360efc2b7558595ce6098bac164405@carto.net>

Hi QGIS devs, 

Am I the only QGIS user that finds it a bit annoying that .qgz is now
the default format instead of .qgs (plain text format)? 

I really often look into the .qgs files, or I create scripts that
process them or find and replace stuff in text editor. 

Now I always have to unzip first and then zip again. Quite annoying. 

Couldn't we switch back to .qgs as default? 

Or if the switch back to .qgs is no option - couldn't we introduce a new
global option that allows me to set my prefered way of storing .qgs
files? Zipped or unzipped? 

Andreas

Hi Matthias, 

Yes - I will do the find and replace in text editor. 

But what is the reason that behaviour was changed? 

Is there a technical reason to do this change? 

For the users such changes are always a bit annoying of course ... but
if there is a technical reason (and I understand why this was changed),
then I feel a bit better when I do all this find and replace work ;-)

Hi all,

No, Andreas, you are not alone. I was planning to write to the list for the
same reason. thanks.
I'm not sure how many users rely on qgd data yet, but I find it annoying
when using a simple and basic project to have it in qgz format by default
(and losing the so good "find and replace" in text editor).
Could we imagine to use by default the qgs format and when the user
connects to auxiliary data or anything that needs a qgd file, to propose to
either switch to qgz format or save the qgd file along?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi all,

The initial plan - discussed some years ago on the lists - was to have a
container so that we can embed resources along the project file, and open
the door to a lot of nice features for sharing qgis projects.
The auxiliary data work was the opportunity to add this optional format and
checks the associated issues.
Then the idea was to switch to qgz by default and add features to save
resources (svg, fonts, datasets, etc...) into the project file.

Unfortunately, the expected funding was discontinued and we are stuck now
with this default QGZ format, only storing the qgs and the qgd files.  (I
think one should not hire a QGIS funder and expect fundings keep coming
afterwards :) )

The timing was bad also, because we only start since a few weeks to have
user feedback on this, like this issue https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20828

We also have feeback that QGZ makes things more complicated for qgs
maintenance tasks.

I really don't know what to do:

- switch back to classical qgs and let qgz get maturity. (But I'm afraid
we'll have very few real feedback then, just like during 3.0-3.2 period)
- give up qgz and bet on another option to offer a container (geopackage )
- totally switch to qgz and offer a python lib for easing maintenance tasks
?

Any opinion welcome here !
Régis

I would vote for your 3rd proposition: replace xml hacking by something
that looks like calls to an API.
And adding an option for those who want to switch back to .qgs +
separated aux files, keeping the default to .qgz.

Hi all,

I like the qgz format for the possibilities it will offer in the future.
But have to agree at the moment we are missing many of the advantages
while the drawbacks become apparent.

I bet for most people it doesn't make a big difference, they use the GUI
as a frontend to configure their projects.

-1, I think we shouldn't turn into a road where we'll wonder how to
embed shapefiles and friends into a sqlite based format ;P

I wonder a bit how that could be done. For sysadmins, the editor of
their preference and (power-)shell scripts are normally the weapons of
choice, by doing that we'll force everyone to use python for these
tasks, without checking if it's the right tool for the job / for person
who does the job.


Currently I'm inclined to prefer Andreas' proposal to have a
(well-hidden advanced) setting to let power-users and admins switch the
default format.

My first reaction is "please KISS", the XML project is already complicated,
so I would stick to option 1.
About usability, I really don't mind it. Having a zipped file is convenient
when... I make a mess, editing the project file.
There is already an enhancement proposal to optionally save the project to
the database, it could be a good start for option 2, but the project is
stored as raw content to accomodate future changes in any direction.
Here are my two cents: don't try to automate everything, sometimes a touch
of vi saves your day, and above all don't make it overly complicated for
automation sake.

Well, qgz adressed a really common caveat: Users just didn't know anything
about auxiliary data qgd files (the same as for Memory Layer Saver plugin
.mldata files) and lost data when sharing projects.

>From a very newbie user, having files along the qgs is really not KISS.
I was aware that a qgz zip would make it a little harder for GIS admin that
do mass text editing with scripts, but I think they can live with it, when
losing data for average user was really something blocking to me.

I always tend to prefer solutions that make straightforward for common
users, so I'm with Matthias here.

Any more opinions ?

moreover, there are a number of issues deriving fom the qgz files, see

Hi all,

During training, I discourage to use .qgz and auxiliary storage. I force 
users to save project as .qgs to avoid issues.
It is not stable yet for me.

Hi René-Luc,
What issues did you face during training? I'm afraid we won't improve if we
advice to workaround this feature .

On windows, the user with an accent in the account name can create the 
project as a QGZ file but can't  save the updated project as a QGZ file.

In the list provided by 
Paolo,https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues?category_id=35&set_filter=1&sort=id%3Adesc&status_id=o&subproject_id=%21%2A 
, a number of issues deriving from accent and qgz file:
* all layers gone when reopen *.qgZ as User „Jörn“
* Project which are saved with special characters in the filename and 
with the qgz extension are blank
* Special Characters in Project-Names saved as Qgz-Files do not work 
/qgz as default

Hi Paolo,
I think you issue list is a bit pessimistic. Looking a issues mentionning
qgz in the subject, we find only 3-4 issues:

- One with user account names on windows with special characters  #20562
- probably to related to special characters in filename #19567 / #19446
- one for embbeded layers #20088


Do you identify others clearly with QGZ implementation?
Best regards
Régis

Ok thanks René Luc,
so we have three issues to solve. That's not something that deserves
killing qgz by itself. Let's push that into the bugfix run.

Sorry I was not clear: I meant that in the list you can find several
issues deriving from qgz, as already pointed out.
All the best.

Hi,

Just 0,20 € for editing the *.qgs file inside the *.qgz.

Windows users:

7zip is able to edit the file in place. By default, it uses Notepad,
which is not very useful. But you con configure a nice editor (notepad++
or another) in the 7zip options. I don't use Windows, but I've launched
one just to check this option and it works.

Linux users (or distributions using vim)

vim can open the *.qgz file and then edit the *.qgs in place. That's
what I do.

You just need to tell vim zip plugin that the *.qgz are also zipped files.

Edit once the ~/.vimrc and add the line:
au BufReadCmd *.qgz call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))

Afterwards, you just need to:
1) vim project.qgz
and it open the project. Hit enter on top of the project.qgs file and
make your changes.

sed (or for some kind of scripting)

Sometimes I need to use sed to do several find/replace. Do do that, I
have a folder /mnt/qgis owned by my user.

To change the project:
1) fuse-zip edicaoavancada.qgz /mnt/qgis

2) Do command line editing...
sed -i "s|<layername>\([^<]\+\)</layername>|<layername>\1
2017</layername>|g" /mnt/qgis/edicaoavancada.qgs

3) recreate the qgz file
fusermount -u /tmp/qgis

This does not solve any of the problems mentioned, but allows me to do
all kind of editing/scripting of top of the zipped project file.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi devs,

in QGIS 3 a shapefile is recognized as MultiLineString, while in QGIS 2
the same file is recognized as LineString. What could be the reason?

Moreover: is there and option to force to read a shapefile as LineString?

Cheers and thanks

Hi Matteo,

In shapefiles, there is no LineString or Polygon, all line layers are
MultiLineString and polygon layers MultiPolygon.

Only points come in multi and non-multi versions.

Cheers

Matthias

Apparently there is a declaration of multi vs simple:
https://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html
Shapefile of type SHPT_ARC, the corresponding layer will be reported as
of type wkbLineString, but depending on the number of parts of each
geometry, the actual type of the geometry for each feature can be either
OGRLineString or OGRMultiLineString

If I understand correctly, the page states that each *feature* can be
multi- or singletype, whereas the question here was why the whole
*layer* is detected as multitype.

good point. the problem remains: older software may accept only
linestrings, and apparently qgis is creating shp with multilinestrings
even in case of single lines. any way to force simple geom during creation?
Thanks.

So the question is how to write single part features to shapefiles?

I think it might work to use the processing alg "multipart to
singlepart" to write such a shapefile.

Hi Richard,

Feel free to write something!

We need people able to take advantage of the *.qgz format. As Matthias
said, I like the *.qgz format "for the possibilities it will offer in
the future".

But we need to solve the problems reported by users quickly.

See you in 41 days,

Jorge

Agreed, I'm very much against a switch back. Let's fix the issues instead.

I suspect these are the same underlying issue. I'll investigate
(pretty sure I already know the fix)

There is a technical reason behind this, but there's also no technical
reason we couldn't make $scale silently "alias" to @map_scale. My
original thinking was that I wanted to strip out some of these older
expression formats, and 3.0 was a good opportunity to do this. But I'm
happy to reverse this decision.

PR incoming.

"no further bugfixes WILL BE MADE for QGIS2." ;)

Otherwise there's a chance this can be read as "we don't PLAN on any
bug fixes, but if something big happens, we may fix it".

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks. It is not about myself - I can live with it - but I fear many
others who migrate might run into the same issue. 

Ideally the old code could still work through the alias, but the $scale
wouldn't be listed anymore in the expression editor - so it wouldn't be
advertised anymore. Is this the idea? 

Anyway - thanks a lot for adding this alias! 

I found projects in our organization where $scale was used >500 times
within the project - used in lots of CASE WHEN END statements for
defining stroke-widths and font-sizes depending on scale ranges in
various layer configuration.

That's exactly what the PR does. So new projects will be guided to the
@map_scale approach, but older ones will still work.

Another idea..

in the "Export as" dialog there is the chance to choose the geometry
type (no multi, only single) and a checkbox to "Force multi-type". So it
seems missing the option to "Force single-type"

What do you think?

Is it worth a ticket to remind it?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hi all,
installing from packages
deb     https://qgis.org/debian buster main
returns an error: the plugin qgis-plugin-grass depends on grass743 but
on sid we have grass 7.4.4-1
I imagine it is a temporary issue, and next recompilation will fix it.
Cheers.

See note on https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu

GRASS was updated to 7.4.4 in testing/unstable and to 7.6.0 in OSGeo4W right
after the release (the windows standalones were made prior to that - ie. still
include 7.4.4).

thanks for the clarification. So in short 3.4.5 will have the grass
plugin, right.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673fCOf_p1V5RCeQwfc=GWXCGckEfq=3-qXM4Sxc_3JSew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

while working on QGIS server I noticed that WFS GetFeature returns NULL
values as empty tags while according to the majority of the sources I've
found it should not include it in the XML response (GML2 at least, I'm not
sure about GML3 yet).

If it is a bug I can work on the fix, but maybe I'm missing something.

See:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Why-the-WFS-does-not-return-the-NULL-value-field-td3802398.html

apparently this is also what geoserver does.

Any opinion?

Hi Matteo,

What's the ultimate goal of this?

Being able to create shapefiles that are compatible with software that
only supports single-geometry-type features?

Best regards

Matthias

No, I haven't, thanks for pointing that out

I'm looking now at http://test.qgis.org/ogc_cite/wfs_110/latest/report.html
but I can't find the test about NULL values, do you remember exactly where
it is?

Hi Allessandro,

Do you speak about these PR:
* https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8536 [Server] Null field value in 
GML has to be empty string 2.18
* https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8537 [Server][WFS] Null field value 
in GML has to be empty string 3.4

I don't think it is a GML specific issue, but something about XSD and XML.

Regards,
René-Luc

Hi René-Luc,

thank you for you reply,

no, I'm talking about this:

image you have a field named "typ" with a NULL value, the XML should not
contain that value at all, currently we get this:

<qgs:fid>22</qgs:fid><qgs:typ></qgs:typ><qgs:name>Oebisfelder
Straße</qgs:name>

while I think that we should get that:

<qgs:fid>22</qgs:fid><qgs:name>Oebisfelder Straße</qgs:name>

In other words: if a field is NULL it should not be empty but completely
omitted from the resulting GML (I suppose this is to make a difference
between empty and null in case of not-numeric fields).

Recent versions of OGR make a difference between :

- a missing XML element, that will be represented in OGR as a "unset field") 
(allowed if the schema has minOccurs="0")
- and a XML element set to <foo xsi:nil="true"/>, that will be represented in 
OGR as a NULL field value (allowed if the schema has nillable="true")

( see https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc67_nullfieldvalues )

The same for JSon actually, between a property that doesn't appear at all, or 
which is set to null.

Example, given foo.json with

{ "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    { "type": "Feature", "properties": { "a": 1, "null_prop": null }, 
"geometry": null },
    { "type": "Feature", "properties": { "b": 2 }, "geometry": null }
  ]
}

$ ogr2ogr foo.gml foo.json -f gml

$ cat foo.gml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ogr:FeatureCollection
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://ogr.maptools.org/ foo.xsd"
     xmlns:ogr="http://ogr.maptools.org/"
     xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml">

  <gml:featureMember>
    <ogr:foo fid="foo.1">
      <ogr:b>2</ogr:b>
    </ogr:foo>
  </gml:featureMember>
</ogr:FeatureCollection>

$ ogr2ogr out.json foo.gml

$ ogrinfo foo.gml -al
INFO: Open of `foo.gml'

Layer name: foo

  fid (String) = foo.0
  a (Integer) = 1
  null_prop (String) = (null)

OGRFeature(foo):1

And yes this is not WFS or GML specific, but XML + XML-Schema generic.

Thanks for all the comments!

I understand that it depends on the schema, what confuses me is the
assertion by Andrea in the (quite old) cited email that  "GML and WFS
explicitly avoid the use of "xs:nil", I could not find any authoritative
support for that claim.

So, if that is not the case, we should probably fix QGIS Server's
DescribeFeatureType to return something like this (for a nillable element):

<element type="long" name="id_long" minOccours="0" />

And for the getFeature response, in case the value is NULL:

<qgs:id xsi:nil="true" />

How does it sounds?

If you want to be able to set xsi:nil="true", the XSD element declaration must 
have the nillable="true" attribute.
minOccurs="0" is to allow the element to be completely absent.

Wasn't me, Justin made that claim :-)
I think I've stumbled into that issue years later, here:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Nil-and-nillable-td5343643.html
But honestly I don't remember how that ended up, I believe the GeoServer
output was not modified in the end.

So what are the missing pieces of the puzzle? With data dependencies
defined in QGIS, I would expect that edit of a geometry in a layer
should trigger dataChanged() signal, so any piece of QGIS that caches
any data is notified that caches should be invalidated... isn't this
the case?

I am not sure I understand what is the problem with cache... attribute
table has its cache, vector joins have caches, snapping has its cache,
so vertex tool has its cache too to make things faster. As long as we
can detect that the cache needs to be invalidated, there should not be
a problem. Could you please shed some light where is the source of the
troubles you are having?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2 questions on saving rasters in 3.4
Message-ID: <2e04fcaf94e9bdc1af7feff4aacd9926@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have two questions about saving rasters in QGIS 3.4: 

1. 

If I use "Right-klick layer" --> "Export" --> "Save AS" then I can't
choose the ESRI ASCII Grid format described in "Settings" --> "Options"
--> "GDAL" as "AAIGrid". 

Any idea why this format is not available for exporting rasters? 

2. 

As an alternative I can use the "Raster" --> "Extraction" --> "Clip
raster by extent". This works fine, but I can't set the number of
decimal places after the comma. 

E.g. if I export a terrain model I would like to use 2-3 places after
the decimal, not the full 8 digits, which is a false accuracy. 

Any way I can set the accuracy for the export? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

It is, but snapping invalidation of indexes for a whole layer can take a
lot of time to rebuild, depending on the indexing strategy.

So the initial benefit of building an index once and querying it with
good performances afterwards is partly lost.

As discussed in a PR (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8862), we have
to find a way to speed up this index rebuilt to have an acceptable solution.

Moreover, it requires the user to declare dependencies between layers.

I am sure you know the quote "There are two hard things in computer
science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors." :-)

Caches are very nice until we find a situation where it gets complicated
to know what and when to invalidate.

So there are 3 general approaches I can see for the problem I have:
- avoid cache : the less intrusive one for the user, provided we
maintain good performances
- invalidate the whole layer at each edition: see above
- invalidate precisely at the level of each feature: should be signaled
by the data provider but seems (on first thought) hard to auto-detect,
so would require a lot of work by the user

The raster file writer only currently supports formats for which GDAL
has "creation" support, not "copy" . See
https://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html - AAIGrid supports copies only.

This should be fixable with moderate effort -- we could create a
temporary dataset in a supported format (possibly even in memory for
smaller rasters), and then use GDAL's createcopy to write the result.
This would open up support for all raster drivers with copy but not
create support, including AAigrid, and a whole lot of other useful
formats too.

I don't fully understand the issue here -- although the dialog is
showing that many decimal places, it doesn't affect the output file if
the extraneous digits are set to 0.

no particular reasons, just scratching the surface of this exportation

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Docs: Question about curves
Message-ID: <1548332653524-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

A question has come up in working on the manual
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/3392/files#r250391261). Can
someone give us a little authoritative help?

The section on the Identify Features tool and the Identify Result dialog
includes the following:

"in case you click on a curved line using the info tool, QGIS will also
display the radius of that section in the panel result"

What is the underlying functionality here? Is is limited to displaying the
radius of circular strings, or does it give the radius of a segment of any
curved geometry? Or is there a better description of this behaviour? Never
having worked with curves in GIS myself, I'm flying blind.

Thanks in advance

Tom

Thank you for the explanation. This is useful to know. It would be a
nice thing to have "Save AS" also for formats that have no GDAL creation
support.

Ok - I try to explain it better: 

My data is originally coming from an ESRI ascii grid. It had been many
hundred tiles of ascii grids which I merged into a single big GEOTIFF
file. The original data had up to 3 digits after the decimal point for
the terrain height (mm accuracy) per cell. After import to the Geotiff
the data has now many more (useless) digits after the comma, because the
number of the digits in the geotiff is now defined by the float32 data
type I chose. When I export that data back to ESRI ascii grid I get 15!
digits after the decimal point. I would like to round it back to 2
digits after the decimal point (cm accuracy). 

In addition, the header in the resulting asciigrid has now many useless
digits. It looks like this: 

ncols 233
nrows 189
xllcorner 2681471.893245012965
yllcorner 1224297.020738559077
dx 0.999927877238
dy 1.000035130719
NODATA_value 0 

Note that the resolution of the data is 1m. But in the export it comes
out as dx 0.999927877238 - dy 1.000035130719 

I wonder if I could force the resolution back to 1.0 (the original
resolution). 

So it is an issue of rounding/accuracy. 

Thanks again, 

Andreas

Hi devs, 

When I try to compile with a new source version of QGIS 3 I receive a error

But it says that in a previous commit it had beed fixed.

Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia Qt5 is too old - I guess it's 5.5 like xenial.  You need
meanwhile need 5.9 or above.

Great work Matteo -- you've certainly demonstrated the true open
source spirit of "JFDI" with your contributions to the documentation
team, and this is a recognition well deserved.

I might be missing something, but it sounds like this change in
precision has happened at the conversion to geotiff stage, not the
"clip raster by extent" stage?

Does converting the grids to a single vrt, and then using GDAL
translate to convert the combined vrt directly to an ascii grid help?

Hi Luke,

Excellent. I should have consulted the GDAL reference myself ;-) many 
thanks. This was exactly what I was looking for!

I can define the DECIMAL_PRECISION parameter as an advanced option when 
creating the raster. This works very well.

The only issue I see here is "user friendly-ness". While this works very 
well for an experienced user, we can't expect the average user or even 
novices to find out these parameters by themselves  by consulting the 
GDAL documentation.

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Nyall,


>> My data is originally coming from an ESRI ascii grid. It had been many hundred tiles of ascii grids which I merged into a single big GEOTIFF file. The original data had up to 3 digits after the decimal point for the terrain height (mm accuracy) per cell. After import to the Geotiff the data has now many more (useless) digits after the comma, because the number of the digits in the geotiff is now defined by the float32 data type I chose. When I export that data back to ESRI ascii grid I get 15! digits after the decimal point. I would like to round it back to 2 digits after the decimal point (cm accuracy).
> I might be missing something, but it sounds like this change in
> precision has happened at the conversion to geotiff stage, not the
> "clip raster by extent" stage?

I would assume the same. The useless (excess) prescision change happened 
when converting the asc files to GeoTIFF files. But is there a way to 
define a "precision" when creating a GeoTIFF other than choosing between 
Byte, UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, CInt16, CInt32, 
CFloat32 and CFloat64 ?

So if I want to store a meter-based terrain model with 2 digits after 
the decimal point I would have to choose Float32 which already results 
in a large number of digits behind the decimal point (useless ones, 
usually).

So really I need to use the DECIMAL_PRECISION creation option (co) when 
exporting the asc ESRI Ascii-Grid file. This was proposed by Luke 
Pinnter in cc and works very well.

Perhaps for the future, it could be an idea to store some 
DECIMAL_PRECISION meta-information in the header of the Geotiff file. 
Then the various tools that work on rasters in QGIS could know that they 
should never ever output more digits after the decimal point than what 
was defined with this parameter - This parameter could be used in all 
raster operations we do in QGIS (e.g. when querying raster values, when 
exporting data, zonal statistics, etc.)

Does that sound like a useful way forward to store such a 
meta-information parameter in the header of the GeoTIFF files in a 
future version of QGIS? If there is a "standard" way for setting a 
precision parameter in GeoTIFF files, we should use that, if not, we can 
invent something aligned with the "GDAL" way of doing things, such as 
the "DECIMAL_PRECISION" parameter.

Thanks and greetings,

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] stronger minor version parsing is required inside
	GeoNode request
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wzE05x7R2Ue-WnhTj2WgpRtgD341N7dPmpZ9P7J1K_SA@mail.gmail.com>

Currently QGIS parses GeoNode's version with a simple .toInt():
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/geocms/geonode/qgsgeonoderequest.cpp#L275
but GeoNode adds more informations to the minor version, for instance "rc"
for a release candidate. This makes the parsing fail and thus layers are
not fetched.

As an example look at the "geonode_version" field on the master demo
instance: http://master.demo.geonode.org/api/layers/

Probably a regex should be used to extract only the first numbers from the
minor version part.

Best,
Giovanni

Dear OSGeo community,

It is time for *GSoC* [1] this year, so this is our starting information to get involved!

If you are willing to act as a mentor [2], fill in this form:

< https://goo.gl/forms/njL27YLWBVensZ3m1 >

If you want to participate proposing ideas, you just need 
to send us (admins:  <gsoc-admin at osgeo.org>) the URL for your project's
ideas page.

Remember that every idea should indicate:

    • A title
    • A description
    • 2 mentors 
    • A test for the students to submit to your evaluation. The test aims at evaluating if the student is capable for the project, so please design the test having in mind the skills required to complete the project.

Time is short, we need to collect all URLs by Feb 4. Here the timeline [3].

Thanks and please forward to your project community.

Hi all,
can we also remove the "affected QGIS version" options for anything
that is QGIS 3 and below 3.4/master (that's it, leave only master and
3.4.4 and remove 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.2, etc.)? Anything below 3.4 is also
unsupported and users should always try the latest available version.

cheers

Dear OSGeo community,

the GRASS GIS dev team is working on a python 3-support/transition [1] of the source code in trunk [2].
 
winGRASS GIS 7.7svn daily builds with python 3 are already available as standalone installers [3] or in OSGeo4W [4]; see:

System Info

Build date: 2019-01-25

Platform: Windows-10-10.0.17763-SP0 (OSGeo4W)  

In [5] there are hints how to test it in e.g. Linux.

As the GRASS GIS transition to python 3 covers changes in many lines of code, a broader testing by the community is very welcome.

Problems and bugs can be reported in the GRASS GIS trac [6].
 
Thanks and kind regards
Helmut

Message-ID: <7c91f458aa4252b2c4fbbc5b4c23357d@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have two GetLegendGraphic questions which I couldn't find out with our
documentation: 

1. 

Can QGIS server produce a filtered GetLegendGraphic response where only
one or more categories are shown instead of the whole layer? 

If so - would this work with the RULE parameter? 

Would you have a sample request how to do this? 

2. 

Can I request the symbols only (e.g. only the box of a polygon layer),
without layer title and without the text next to the legend box? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

You can use RULE to get only one category as described in the standard.
You can request the symbols only with the QGIS Server extra parameters 
https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/services.html#getlegendgraphics

Message-ID: <8226550f35884747aff086bc532d689b@EXMBX-11.cg67.fr>

Hi dev,


I want to do some deep control when user edit data in a custom form. So when I want to test my script there's no feedback from python console. Even If I put some QMessageBox in my code, it's not displayed while some other instruction placed after effect.

So is there some way to get debug information when using a custom form init script?

Thanks

Sylvain

Hey all,

If anyone's interested in applying for the GSOC this year and is
looking for a QGIS project, I'm available for mentoring in any of the
following code areas:

- Processing, including vector/raster data processing algorithms,
optimisation of existing algorithms, and modelling improvements

- Print layouts and reports

- Vector/raster symbology, labeling

Let me know if you're interested!

Dear Madam/Sir,

I have installed QGIS 3.4 and would like to learn pyQIS as per this latest version in python3. The docs say that documentation is still in process. I sincerely acknowledge your hard work and would like to know by when will the pyQGIS 3.4 documentation be available.

[When you have moved on from python 2.7 to 3, we the users would also like to do that.]

Thanks for your response.

Hi ,
the globe plugin has not been ported to QGIS 3
ticket #15536 does not seem to have had any continuation to date.
according to https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/more-qgis-3d/
a globe functionality should be developed in QGIS 3 (earth as a globe).
what is the roadmap today to have this functionality that interests us 
for the use of fishing fleet management?

Regards,
Alain

Hi Alain,
i don't know if this answer to your question but in QGIS 3.4 you have a 3D
Map View.
Go to View > New 3D Map View.

Please check this link:
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2018/03/01/working-with-qgis-3d-part-1/


The coolest part is the option to integrate this 3D view in layout composer.

Cheers,
João

Hi Alain,

We are in process of adding the features to QGIS gradually. Unfortunately,
it is not possible to add all of the features all in one go, as 3D was
completely done from scratch in QGIS 3.
There will be some new features from the crowd-funding in 3.6. But globe is
likely to be included in 3.8.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

Kind regards
Saber

	in enclosing scope
Message-ID: <f7eeb6f4e52a446bb7bdc7e7d93c6cea@uib.no>

Dear QGIS community,

In the spirit of open-source I am trying to convert a set of scripts that ive designed in ArcMap to QGIS 3.x. I hope that this will enable a broader community of individuals to use the workflows ive designed. The original scripts can be found at https://github.com/BjornNyberg/NetworkGT/tree/master/Scripts

My problem is that in my first attempt to convert the scripts, QGIS either crashes or gives the following error. 

2019-01-30T16:51:27     WARNING    Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "C:/PROGRA~1/QGIS3~1.4/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\processing\gui\AlgorithmDialog.py", line 238, in on_complete
              self.feedback.pushInfo(self.tr('Execution completed in {0:0.2f} seconds').format(time.time() - start_time))
             NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before assignment in enclosing scope

I have established that this error occurs at the very end of the script when calling ' return {self.Branches:dest_id,self.Nodes:dest_id2}'. I do not believe that I have explicitly defined self  anywhere in the processAlgorithm function itself. The algorithms themselves work as intended and the shapefiles are created before the program crashes. 

I am not a programmer by trait so I'm not entirely sure how to problem solve this error and any help would be most appreciated. I can also provide a test dataset if that is helpful. 

Cheers,
Bjorn

Hi Bjorn,

What do you expect this

{self.Branches:dest_id,self.Nodes:dest_id2}

would result in? It doesn't look like python to me but I might be 
missing something.


What does the variable self.Branches contain?


"self" Refers to your Branches_Nodes class itself.


(By the way, it is a good habit to start variable names with a lower 
case character.)

Regards,
Raymond

Nevermind, that return line should work. The self.Branches and 
self.Nodes are variables containing the strings for your dict.

The problem is in the AlgorithmDialog code. Hope someone else can help 
you with that.

 Merge exception request for QGIS 3.6
Message-ID: <CAFO80_q94nG9fFqfprgqgMwvLiQxuFsp1YYa-dUVAcrpaKB53w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

with this I want to ask if it is possible to insert the new feature:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9049

in the next 3.6 LTR.

these are the technical reasons:
1) do not affect any existing feature. The only critical point could be the
change of some SLD export method from const to no const (I'll explain in
the PR the reason)
2) can be useful for any public institution using geoserver as backend when
public institutions suppose to install LTR version.

There are the personal reason:
0) I really do not like to force the rules and following ones are my
personal reason why I wasn't able to respect feature freeze.
1) busy organizing a complex (for me) conference
2) All family sick... I'm still sick!

let me know

Luigi Pirelli

Message-ID: <CAFcOn2-6mjzsnGqwkwEssGNj3LVACR6fiQCy_27EccyPV8DrKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

August 2017 Tim S. blogged about "Plotting the future of QGIS" [1] and
mentioned as no. 1. "We need to beef up the analytical capabilities in
QGIS". There he asked "why not provide both a Jupyter Notebook"
embedded into QGIS and pointed to options to integrate the Jupyter Qt
console [2]. QGIS/Jupyter integration has been mentioned 2017 as
possible GSoC but then can't see other activities.

So what is your opinion about writing a QGIS Python Plugin which
allows to run Python notebooks an accesses the QGIS processing power
(e.g. using Qt's  RichJupyterWidget).

Any developments or thoughts on this?

Stefan,

this is actually a very good idea, I've started something similar a few
years ago, but its scope was limited to embedding the IPython console
inside QGIS, the plugin is available here:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/IPyConsole/

It is based on QtConsole.

Perhaps it could be a starting point, IIRC Luigi also explored this
possibility while we were working together in Boundless.

3.6 will not be LTR.
It's 3.4 which was released October 2018.

I already wrote many times about QT Console limitations to interact with
external kernels... I dind't know about RichJupyterWidget and I'm not
updated about qt console evlution.

IMHO if it works would be great... since 1.5y ago it was not possible.

So you want to include in both 3.6 and then backport to 3.4?

I'm a +0 here. The code only touches SLD export, so I think it's low
risk outside of this area.

There was a bug fixed recently which mostly impacted network routing
when geographic coordinate systems were used. Could this apply to you?

Great!

This was a bug fixed already - are you on QGIS 3.4?

Anyone, the problem stems from this line:

    templines = st.run('native:splitwithlines',parameters)

This should be:

    templines =
st.run('native:splitwithlines',parameters,context=context,
feedback=feedback)

I.e. you need to pass the child algorithm the context and feedback
objects given to your algorithm, to allow that child algorithm to push
feedback messages and access existing map layers.


Two other suggestions:

            except Exception as e:

feedback.pushInfo(QCoreApplication.translate('Sample_Area','%s'%(e)))

Here this would be better as:

            except Exception as e:

feedback.reportError(QCoreApplication.translate('Sample_Area','%s'%(e)))

(reportError instead of pushInfo)

And

for part in geom: #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry

This should be

for part in geom.asGeometryCollection(): #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry

(or, nicer for 3.4):

for part in geom.parts(): #Check for multipart polyline
    parts.append(QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(part)) #intersected geometry


Hope that helps!

I do not believe that I have explicitly defined self  anywhere in the processAlgorithm function itself. The algorithms themselves work as intended and the shapefiles are created before the program crashes.

Dear Charlie, 

My advice is, that you are a bit more precise, what this is about. QGIS
developers have different expertise or skills within the QGIS universe. 

If you can tell what this plugin is going to achieve, you are more
likely to get the relevant devs to respond. 

Greetings, 

Andreas
