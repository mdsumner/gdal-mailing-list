 Keeping a similar color set and form make the transition easier as the 
 visual identity gap between the old and the new is shorter. Sylvain has 
 done more proposals, I'll add them tonight.

 I've replaced the old with this one on my local copy, the big 
 improvement is for the taskbar.

Good idea, I think a new logo will help launching QGIS 2.0.
I do not think we have to even keep the Q: we should leave the designer maximum
freedom. Some element (color, or arrow, whatever) could recall the current logo
anyway, so to keep some continuity.
All the best.

Hi all, after some stressfull/successful time, I finally took some time off.
I'll be in SW USA climbing. This mail is of course not ment to make
everybody hate me but to ask you to mail me directly if you have any android
qgis questions. I ll check this list very little. Thanks a lot and I look

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4Du5-cMyi5QZK74ktsOPQLGr_OFXt_9i4mzpw84TExFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

I would like to know if there was a dedicated api method to create a new
vector layer (and save it into a file) by copying a map canvas layer (which
could be postgis, shapefile, etc.).
I have read here
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#writing-shapefiles
how to write a new shapefile. But then I would need to  "manually" copy each
feature from the chosen layer to the new one.

I was thinking of a equivalent to the right-click "Save as" which brings an
ui to choose the targer layer format, srid, etc., but I am trying to do it
programatically.

Is there a proper way to do it ?

Thanks in advance
Kimaidou

without an error message and other details (qgis version, platform, tool

Don't know if it is 'proper', but I can write a vector layer with the
method writeAsVectorFormat from QgsVectorFileWriter, see

http://doc.qgis.org/head/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#3a4405a59d8f8ac147878cae5bd9bade

To test:

on an active vector layer (selected in legend), do the following in the
qgis python console:

i = qgis.utils.iface
l = i.activeLayer()
qgis.core.QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormat(l,
'/tmp/myjson.json', 'utf-8', l.crs(), 'GeoJson')

and you should find your json in /tmp :-)

(for more possibilities (like only saving selected features etc) see docs.

 I would assume the Q and the arrow represents a compass. The Q is the 
 compass rose and the arrow is the needle.

 Personally, I don't think that the current logo/icon is that bad, but I 
 am open to other proposals. I also don't think that the current logo is 
 too complex. Look at Apples logo (i.e. of Safari) - this is pretty 
 complex logo as well (I would say it is more complex than the QGIS logo) 
 and people seem to like it.

 I also think that there could be different versions (e.g. with or 
 without shadow or even with a different color). One could distinquish 
 certain sub-projects (such as QGIS Server, QGIS Android, QGIS webclient) 
 with a slightly modified QGIS logo.

Nice, it seems very modern.

+1 for logo competition.

If you install QGIS 1.7 from the installer on that machine, would it
crash too? If not then you have probably done something wrong when
compiling or preparing the installer.

Btw. what leads you to compile QGIS on windows yourself instead of
using standalone installer or osgeo4w packages?

Indeed it would be good to give QGIS logo a face lift, it lacks the
modern bright and shiny web 2.0 compatible colors :)
A logo competition would be great, anybody would like to organize it?
The designer of winning logo will obtain a free copy of QGIS ...maybe
even digitally signed by Gary? :-)

Hi Martin

I had the same idea with the free copy of QGIS but I was not brave 
enough the mention it at the list ;-)

That sounds like a bug to me. However, trying with master branch I get
the correct behavior - after adding a layer the project gets dirty as
expected.

As it seems to be the choice of the majority, let's do it the right way 
: so Simon, please set up this contest by the beginning of the next week 
so this matter is settled before the next hackfest (nobody wants a shirt 
with a deprecated logo).

Is anyone willing to pool a bit more money in to go with Simon's effort.
 The more money the better chance of getting some good logos.

The screenshots suggest that something went wrong with the python
path: there are several relative paths ('.\\DLLs' and others). Python
docs suggest [1] that you should set PYTHONHOME environment variable
to get correct paths. This may be reason why it works on your
development machine and not elsewhere.

Hi Martin,

Could you please point me where can I find packing Qgis document to include
the python path in environment variable using NSIS. (or)
any document where I can find how to configure *QGIS-Installer.nsi* file to
include all path into environment variable. Thanks.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Since I had to meet a deadline for the
CAPS app I'm working on, I just wrote my own "is.dirty()" check in Python. 
I thought maybe the QgsProject.instance().isDirty() function depended on the
layer list panel or some other part of QGIS that isn't part of my app.  I
looked through the developer list archives, but I didn't find anything
detailed about how the QgsProject class works.  I guess I'd have to read
through the C++ code, but my understanding of C++ is limited at this
point--something I intend to remedy in the near future.  If there is a good
intermediate level C++ book you know of, please let me know.

Also, thanks for your work on the Python documentation.  I would not been
able to develop the CAPS app without that help.  I will be posting my code
soon, and hopefully there will be some stuff in there that is useful for
creating documentation.  I am also willing to help out with some of the
PyQgis documentation if that is useful.

Thanks again,
Bob

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis Live historisation
Message-ID: <1314996247.2975.20.camel@mk-desktop-smh>

Hi,
I am trying to use Postgis Live historisation from QGIS, following:
http://www.kappasys.ch/pgtools/pghistory/#toc8

I ran into several problems.
------------------------
Main one is:
After initial import of dataset, the first modification to each single
feature does not add the archive date to it (hence the view does not
filter it). Subsequent modification of a feature which has been modified
at least once are correctly logged and the archive date is correctly
inserted.
Here is what I do:

1. Create data structure with:
 shp2pgsql -p -c -I points_test.shp | psql)
2. initialise historisation
SELECT add_history('public'::text, 'points_test'::text,
'public_view'::text,   'points_test_view'::text, true);
3. Load data
 shp2pgsql -a points_tests.shp public_view.points_test_view
4. Modify a feature in QGIS

Swapping steps 2 & 3 give same results.
As a workaround, I was thinking of making a simple "update" (updating a
field by setting it to its own value) and then deleting unnecessary rows
just after step 3, but I cold not find a way to have the desired effect.

------------------------
2nd problem is related to date attribute: I have dates as attributes to
my tables. The perl code seems to assume that if it's not a text, it's a
numeric and posgres complains about the trigger trying to insert a
numeric into a date field.
My workaround is to use only text field instead of date fields; I can
live with this.
-----------------------
Some other problems are related to documentation.

I had to find out that the following is necessary:


-- DROP TYPE IF EXISTS  change_type CASCADE;
CREATE TYPE change_type AS  ENUM ('insert', 'update', 'delete');
CREATE SCHEMA public_view AUTHORIZATION 
The doc says:
myaccount;add_history('name_schema','name_table','name_schema_view','name_view')
but looking at the code shows that a new (boolean) parameter was addded
at the end.

Finally, last problem: I could not simply load the functions from the
shell with:
psql
-f ~/postgis/insert_timegis_trigger_function.sql
It complained about an error near the end of the script, near <<>>
(double quotes with nothing in it?!)
I had to open the query in pgadmin3 to run it.

Thanks for any hint!

Hi Paolo,
I will try to support polygons in one of the future release. Now I'm adding
batch mode and new algorithms.
I don't see anything goes wrong with Chaiken's alg. Bigger 'weight' value
will band lines closer to vertex nad 'level' param sets number of iterations
of algorithms (more iter's -> more vertexes and smoother lines).
See
http://idav.ucdavis.edu/education/CAGDNotes/Chaikins-Algorithm/Chaikins-Algorithm.html
for details.

Regards
Peter

I see. However, results are different from GRASS; I tried e.g. with:

v.generalize input=t_fiumi_principali@PERMANENT type=line layer=1 -c method=chaiken
threshold=1.0 look_ahead=7 reduction=50 slide=0.5 angle_thresh=3 degree_thresh=0
closeness_thresh=0 betweeness_thresh=0 alpha=1.0 beta=1.0 iterations=1 layer=1
output=fiumi_chaik_1_grass

GRASS smooths lines more, whereas your plugin is much closer to oringinal line.
All the best.

Giving an higher number of iterations gives more similar results.

My chaiken algorithm differs from GRASS v.generalize. It's based on method
described here:
http://www.multires.caltech.edu/teaching/demos/java/chaikin.htm and uses
level and weight parameters to calculate output line while GRASS chaiken's
uses only threshold parameter.
If you play with demo on then site I linked above you will understand how my
algorithm works.

Peter

Yes, I have read it.
Perhaps you could add an About button, with links to the explanations of parameters
and algorithms?
All the best.

Yes, I'm planning to write some help for plugin (with algorithms
description), when I release 1.0 version.
So far I have done some work but I must translate it to english.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Change feature via Python
Message-ID: <4E648C10.2070900@jena.de>

Dear devs,

my situation is as follows:
I am working on some Python code. I have a non-spatial layer in the 
project created from a PostgreSQL table.
For this layer I can (via Python):
1) create a new feature, manipulate its attribute values and add it to 
the layer
2) access an existing feature and its attribute values by this code:
feat = QgsFeature()
ok = layer.featureAtId(fid, feat, False, True)
3) open the feature form and have the user manipulate the attribute 
values of either 1) or 2)

However I could not find a way to access an existing feature and 
manipulate its attribute values so that the changed values are written 
back to the layer just like the feature form does.
I understand that the feature is not part of the layer as soon as it is 
accessed by the code given above. Is there a way to replace a feature in 
a layer or change its attribute values other than via feature form?

To delete the original feature and add a new feature with changed values 
afterwards is not a solution because there are foreign keys defined on 
the feature's id. So deletion would not be allowed (foreign-key option 
RESTRICT) or related datasets in other tables would be deleted, too 
(foreign-key option CASCADE). So this is not viable.

any hints are welcome

regards

Bernhard

Sure. There are two options.

You can use layer's changeAttributeValue() method to tell the vector
layer about the changes. For this the layer has to be in editing mode
- either user can start it or you can start it from plugin with
startEditing() and stop with commitChanges() or rollBack(). In the
editing mode the changes are stored in memory and stored to a
file/database when editing mode is left with commitChanges() method.
This is equivalent to the use of feature form.

The other option is to use vector data provider's method
changeAttributeValues(). The difference is that the changes are
immediately written to the backend and the editing mode is not
considered. That method is actually called from vector layer when
committing changes from the editing mode.

Dear Martin,

thank you for your quick response. I knew I must be missing something...
will try layer.changeAttributeValue()

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Native MS SQL 2008 Driver for QGIS
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_8yC_+m1kRG28U_Nj61kCVMELUuPitHyzTFq-tEpqoNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There has been some interest from a company here in Australia to develop a
MS SQL driver/provider for QGIS. IMO this is a good move as most
local governments, where I work and where I push my QGIS agenda, pretty much
all use MS SQL 2008 spatial for storing spatial data.  Having a driver for
MS SQL would make QGIS more attractive to these and many more Windows users.

The thing I wanted to find out was if implementing a native/provider MS SQL
Driver in QGIS would be the correct way to go about this.  At current there
is already a MS SQL driver for OGR, which can be used to open layer from the
database in QGIS using the Python console.  However there is no UI and while
OGR is fine with opening database connections it seems strange to use OGR
for some database engines but not others.

My thoughts were

Implement a native QGIS driver for MS SQL inheriting from
QgsVectorDataProvider

   - Less program layers as your not going though OGR then wrapping it in
   the QgsFeature class (should be faster).
   - Implement QBrowser support like what Giuseppe has done with his
   improvements to the postgis provider.
   - Closer control over the code eg faster bug fixing and features. Don't
   need to wait for OGR packages to be updated.

I guess something that came to mind is that we have a native provider for
PostGIS but yet OGR supports it.

In my mind a native driver is the way to go as we can integrate it more
tightly into the QGIS code base and not rely on an other library for bug
fixes and updates.

What are other peoples thoughts?

Hi Nathan

I also think that a native QGIS provider (subclass of QgsVectorDataProvider) 
for MS SQL 2008 would be a great thing. The reason to go for a native driver 
(and not via OGR) are the same as with PostGIS:

- performance is better (less conversion)
- even with the  OGR driver, it needs work to be done for a good QGIS 
integration. E.g. QGIS is strict to have only one shapetype in a layer and it 
requires a unique identifiere for a feature (also in a db view)

Btw. a native oracle spatial provider would also be nice to have. Oracle 
spatial is (unfortunately) quite common here.

Regards,
Marco

I guess the main obstacle is with licencing: if QGIS has to be built against non-free
libraries, the resulting object may have an hybrid licence, unsuitable for distribution.

+1 for having these native spatial drivers.
I don't know about MS SQL, for Oracle you cannot distribute the required
proprietary lib, which is however freely downloadable from Oracle. In any
case this is required by the OGR driver too.

PS: The OGR Oracle driver is quite unusable at now. It's very slow, and
Frank told me that it's because it was developed for specific requirements,
and he's aware of the various potential improvements needed for a mor
generic, fast, use...

We shouldn't need any external libraries, Qt has a built in ODBC driver that
you can use to connect to MS SQL.  I tried it this arvo in PyQt.

Oh, if the library users have to read through the c++ then we are
really lacking some developer documentation.

I cannot recommend any intermediate level c++ books however there
should be plenty of online resources like tutorials on object-oriented
programming in c++ (that is what I would consider as intermediate
level of c++).

Any help with PyQGIS documentation would be highly appreciated!

The source code is self-documenting ;-)

I do have a similar problem now I think.

I added a new plugin both to hub.qgis.org and to the git there

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/xytools/

Everything went fine: adding a new project, initing git, uploading a key
following the instruction in the 'Repository'-tab:

  git init
  git add .
  git status
  git commit -m 'Initializing xytools repository'
  git remote add origin gitosis@qgis.org:xytools.git
  git push origin master

And I now see my initial commit:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/xytools/repository

But after that, I'm not able to push to the repository anymore...

Like Martin I get asked for a pass-phrase I do not know...

Maybe a hint: if I look in the http://hub.qgis.org/my/public_keys, I see
that it ends on richard@zwam (machine name) instead of richard@duif.net ...

Maybe this part of the ssh session is useful?

As said in the 'new plugin scenario' thread I had the ssh authentication
problem (AFTER succesfully being authenticated...).

Because I recently tried github also, I also tried the github test from
http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/ ('Having problems?' part):

Strange..
  $ ssh -T git@github.com
now failed in the same way as
  $ ssh -v gitosis@qgis.org
with my normal keys working...

Github thinks it is a Ubuntu problem (again: see the 'Having problems?'
and 'Agent admitted failure to sign using the key' part in that help
page), and pointing to an apparently bug in Ubuntu:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/201786

Thinking it had something to do with a locked keyring or so, I just
restarted... and then I'm able to both authenticate to qgis-gitosis AND
to github again. And I could push my commit to remote again :-)

So for the gitosis administrators: maybe gitosis on hub.qgis.org is just
ok, and it is a ubuntu issue??

Subject: [Qgis-developer] unable to upload fixed Valuetool
Message-ID: <4E675DAC.3020700@duif.net>

Hi devs,

I've put the (old) valuetool plugin of G. Picard now in hub.qgis.org.
Small fix for http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4253 (otf rasters not working).

But... I'm not allowed to update the zip for the valuetool (going from
0.3.2 to 0.3.3) in
http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/python_plugins/list?page=10
because I'm not the owner of the plugin

Who can fix this (? maybe by removing the old plugin, or otherwise make
me the 'Contributer' of it ?)

To be able to use it now, I also uploaded it to the new Qgis Plugin
Repo. So users can also go to

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/version/40/

and download the zip there

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <CALCNqkZNM_VoS0n+pSC5NtHyDBkobFXbo14MMzhizLoO74xWiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

I have created a branch for 1.7.1.

git branch --track release-1_7_1 origin/release-1_7_1

Origin being the main git repo. It would be great if folks would test
it compiles on their platform and generally behaves ok.

I have a few more things to change before we tag it for the 1.7.1 release.

Please consider the old 1_7_0 branch permanently frozen and apply any
backports to the 1.7.1 branch.

After the release, I will immediately branch 1.7.2 so that it is a bit
more obvious which branch should be on the receiving end of your
backports.

Best regards

You try to run qgis as a shell process after you tried to change the
window title. That doesnt make sense to me since to use iface, you
already need to have a qgis instance available.....

By the way, if you type

qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().setWindowTitle("ankur workhard")

In the qgis python console it does what you expect.

Paolo made a mistake while writing, he meant:
"the one in C:\WINDOWS *masked* the "good" one in the osgeo folder"
so you must rename c:\windows\iconv.dll to solve the problem.

Devi rinominare il file di windows, quello giusto ? distribuito con OSGEO4W.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Status of the qgis-grass plugin, esp. on Windows
Message-ID: <4E6A6A8E.6000307@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
As qgis-grass-windows user know, we had a couple of nasty bugs [0],[1] preventing a
proper use of GRASS within QGIS on Windows. One of the bugs seemed fixed upstream,
but we still missed an osgeo4w package for it. We (Faunalia) do not use Windows, but
we do a lot of courses, and many users have Windows machines, so we had the choice of
either removing GRASS from our courses or get our hands dirty and debug GRASS and its
QGIS plugin on Win. Of course we did the latter.
We believe now everything should be solved, so all well. However, we would like to
point out that:
- a grass-dev package, built overnight, is missing from osgeo4w; we think this is
quite bad, as testing on win lags very much behind in this way; of course grass-only
users can install the standalone, but we think a complete environment is better; IOHO
this should not be hard to set up, so we encourage GRASS maintainers to do so (AFAIK
Martin Landa is working on this); of course we're ready to help if necessary
- the qgis-grass plugin is receiving very little, if any, care; I think we (Faunalia)
did most of the work on it in the last few years; we're happy to do it, but we miss
the resource to do it on a regular basis (e.g. there is a number of bugs to be
fixed). Are we the only users, or there are more around? If so, please stand up and
help us, either patching the code or providing some resources, or even better
becoming the maintainer of the plugin, otherwise we're afraid the maintenance will
become more and more difficult.
All the best.

I am going to provide daily build packages for GRASS 6.4, 6.5 and 7.0
for OSGeo4W within few next days.

Don't forget OS X - the grass plugin is currently broken for OS X as a result of a "fix" for Windows:

Sorry, I missed that one. One more reason to find urgently a maintainer. I'm afraid
the only other option is to drop support for this important plugin, which IMHO would
be a major problem. Keeping it broken is a bad thing for the reputation of the project.
Please users help, if this plugin is useful for your work.
All the best.

Anyone know what is wrong and when the link be back up?

http://download.osgeo.org/ is down since few days. Just use

Now is back. BTW, I noticed that this dir:

The mapX/Y values seem sensible, but the pixelX/Y values are far too
large... and shouldn't they be integers?
It generates the following world file:

The raster loads but is about 10mm wide rather than about 200m.
I'm not sure exactly why certain images are a problem, but am starting to
wonder if it is linked to trying to transform into a relatively small target
area.
Has anyone else seen this type of problem or is there anyone who can suggest
where I may be going wrong... or should I just file a bug report?

So why not removing this old stuff? It could be confusing for new users.
All the best.

As far as I can tell, no. I'm aware that there are issues with a previously
georeferenced TIFF, but I'm using a BMP and didn't think that this can store
metadata.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS - the selected color ramp is not available
Message-ID: <4E6CE1C8.7060502@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the qgis 67dfd2e.

When I'm try to render a set of polygons with a graduated or categorized 
choose.
I have the message:
"the selected color ramp is not available".
And
in the combo "color ramp" is not possible to definy a new ramp.

Is a bug this ?

Andrea.

There was a .WLD for a file with a different name - I deleted it, the points
file... and tried again. No improvement.
The points have figures like srcX = 32749572.45. Given the source image is
only 4804 x 3084 pixels, why would I get a value four orders of magnitude
greater than the pixel count?

for  the  sake of experiment, try opening and saving your bmp in the graphic
editor   like  GIMP under different name and format (say TIF), load in
georeferencer. Will you still have projected coords?

Hi Tim,

Could you tell me how to correctly add this branch to my local repo ? 
I've been trying checkout/fetch/pull release-1_7_1 from origin or 
upstream but it always gets ugly when merging.

The changes I would like to make are already in master but as I didn't 
use properly the BACKPORT tag they're not in this branch, one could be 
directly merged from master (doc/TRANSLATORS).

Regards,
Jean Roc

git branch --track release-1_7_1 origin/release-1_7_1

Above should do it for you then after that:

git checkout release-1_7_1
git pull origin release-1_7_1

If you can identify the commit id of your original commit, you can
simply use cherry-pick to apply it (while inside the release branch):

git cherry-pick <hash>

Then push it up to the release branch:

git push origin release-1_7_1

Hope that helps!

Hi Andrew.  I think I have always got stupid results like that when
trying to use more than two control points with the linear
transformation.  Does it work if you only use two points?
I did think there was a bug report for this, but I can't see it now.

I have configured our Pbuilder for daily builds for Debian Squeeze.
Until now it builds fine.

Hi Alister
I find that before I define any points with a BMP loaded the georeferencer
window coordinates have no relationship to the pixel position. So it doesn't
work with zero points!
I then save the BMP as a TIFF and try again. This time the georeferencer
window coordinates are displayed in pixels as expected and the image can be
georeferenced as expected.
Can anyone else reproduce this behaviour?

Hi devs,
thinking to 2.0, we should uniform API by using the same name for these methods
QgsRasterLayer::providerKey() and QgsVectorLayer::providerType().

I think is better to use providerType() for both them.
Cheers.

Also QgsRasterLayer::usesProvider() should be deprecated
because file-based rasters use gdal provider now.

Hi Giuseppe

feel free to mark the such methods as deprecated - when we start
cleaning the API it will be handy.

Hi!

Probably a WIKI page with proposed API updates/cleanings?
Could be handy for Documentation afterwards too

FYI
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6596364/tracking-c-lib-public-api-changes

I asked a question on there on how we can generate a report with API
changes.  If we could weave this into the build process it would be even
better.

Another useful method:

   QgsDataProvider.searchForFeatures ( fieldIndex, searchString,
searchMethod = 0 )

      fieldIndex: search on idx-th field;
      searchString: search terms;
      searchMethod:
                         0x00001 = match whole searchString
                         0x00002 = search inside values;

 it returns an array of found features.

The table has only a single row. Normally it loads instantly. Suddenly
its taking a very long time. Here's the output from postgres:

Yes. Loading one postgis table causes a scan of data related to all
other tables in the database. The query below appears in the
postgresql log, but it is not the table loaded into qgis. The query
took more than 6 minutes.

Hi Tim,

It sounds to me like it is trying to determine the primary key.

Does it load quicker if you manually specify the primary key column?

It sounds strange to me though that a scan is already happening on the
other tables, unless they are connected (say through a join or foreign
key or something else).

Hi,

for who may be interested I compiled this plugin under Ubuntu 11.04
64bit

here is the binary 

http://ubuntuone.com/0Kl0mSeOWoUsddoQPWppFE

it needs OpenCv version 2.2 that I found available in this ppa
repository

https://launchpad.net/~gijzelaar/+archive/opencv2?field.series_filter=natty


cheers

It's trying to determine the geometry type at that particular query. 
Does the table have an entry in geometry_columns with a
geometrytype<>'GEOMETRY'?

There will likely be other file based rasters in the future - there is
some work to provide an OSSIM provider and I could envisage others in
the future.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Labeling:
Message-ID: <F4E6685DCA144554BF96B30C0E1C1169@amd64x2>

I'm trying to find a way to use data defined positioning with the new
labelling to replicate what is possible in the old labelling, namely
aligning and rotating about the point specified for a layer.
With the new labelling, fields have to be selected for label distance X & Y
coordinates before the horizontal & vertical alignment plus rotation are
enabled. Is there a logical reason why alignment and rotation aren't
available by default?
I tried creating a dummy field (always NULL values) and selecting it for
distance, X & Y. This enables the other fields (to the extent that I can
select them), but they seem to have no effect.
Am I missing something or do I need to file a bug report?

Hi Andrew,

The logic is that one often wants label positions separate from the
actual geometry. The new label tool allows x/y positions not only for
point geometries (where one can use the point geometry), but also for
line and area features. If x/y columns are empty, QGIS uses the featurue
geometry, if one manually moves the labels, x/y columns are used. This
way one can mix manual and automatic labeling.

If you want fully automatic labeling just create dummy x/y columns and
never manually move labels around.

Does it sound illogical to you?

I see that the output is not so helpful below because the log is not serialized.

Anyway, I think I have an answer. There is a table in the database
with >1.2 billion rows. Somehow loading any table from that database
is triggering a scan of the very large table, perhaps all tables in
the database. I dumped the smaller tables and made a new database and
it is quick again.

I will see if I can serialize the log output and report back.

Hi Andreas
Yes they way that you have described generally seems logical with the
exception that I don't understand why it should be necessary to specify
fields for distance, X & Y before rotation and position are enabled. 
I would have thought that all position options could be selected on a
case-by-case basis with the defaults used where options aren't specified -
that way there would be no need to create dummy fields. 
Is there a reason why this default solution is inappropriate?

I've been asked to create a custom qgis, to be distributed via CD/DVD along
with some data (vector and raster) that should be only visible and usable
thorugh the customized qgis and not by any other tool.
Has somebody in this list ever had to manage this kind of obfuscation?

I'd ask Microsoft or Apple or any other company with years of history
about obfuscating formats...

But seriously I'm curious about the use case, can you share it ?

@Sandro: it's a requirement I'm asked to implement, not an hypothesis to
discuss. We can debate on the choice, but that's not my problem at now ;)

@Niccol?: good point. Howevere one could write a non GPL piece of code (the
minimum to keep the data undisclosable) and link qgis to it. Is it forbidden
by GPL license? I don't think...

It will be an ineffective protection schema, by any means.

Who will receive the custom QGIS has the right to get the sources 
too, and then the obfuscation schema on geodata is easly 
expolitable.

I'm a free citizen and I can refuse a contract, but this is not the point of
my question Sandro. I've asked a technical opinion, not ethical.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DB Manager release
Message-ID: <4E71ED0C.1050701@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Thanks to the hard work of Giuseppe Sucameli, the supervision of Martin Dobias, and
the support of Google for its Summer of Code initiative, DB Manager is now available.
DBManager's aim is to merge together some QGis DB plugins, e.g. PGManager, SLManager,
RT_Sql_Layer.
In this moment it works with both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases and it displays the
list of tables, info about the selected table, table data and preview, but also
allows to rename/delete tables through its GUI and run query on the selected
database, so at this stage it replaces at all SLManager.
Thanks to Mauricio De Paulo (mauriciodev), now DB Manager also supports PostGIS Rasters!
The last DB Manager version has support to Import Vector Layer feature by drag'n'drop
a layer from the QGis browser (or even DB Manager) to a database in the DBManager
GUI. The Import Vector Layer feature allows to import/copy any vector layer QGis can
load between different datasources, i.e. PostGIS/SpatiaLite databases and OGR files.
It's available through the QgsVectorLayerImport class and it has just been merged in
master branch.
See [1] for an example of use.
Faunalia is committed to support the development of this tool, and other DB plugin
developers are welcome to join and merge their work, it this makes sense, to reduce
confusion for users.
Enjoy.

I just tried to upgrade the plugin (it just came up with the new version recently) and it crashed and said I was missing a dependency. I think it was something tinker (I have forgotten exactly what it was)?

I am using QGIS 1.8 from OSGEO4W on XP.

What's the version of DBManager?

I've added a lot of features in the last days/hours,
so the last (and stable) version is 0.1.0.

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

please, could you post the error message?

Anyway, DBManager uses "pyspatialite" and "psycopg2" libraries.
You can install them from the OsGeo4W setup -> Advanced install.

I cannot recreate the error now as the plugin manager is only finding version 0.1.0 of the plugin.

Hi Giovanni

 The simplest solution might be to encrypt the data and send the key to your 
clients.

I also believe it might be forbidden by the GPL.
I think there might be a way to reconcile ethics, respect for the GPL
and the client needs.
You would need to obfuscate the source code.
For example, you rename fonctions, classes, filenames etc according to
an encryption mechanism. The encryption is based on a key chosen by the
client.

You need to take care of many things, e.g. if:
qgsapplication.cpp  becomes qslghtygvr15ni189t.cpp
then:
qgsapplication.h  becomes qslghtygvr15ni189t.h
Naming conventions which are understood by the framework should be
respected as well (I do not know qgis's architecture well enough to be
precise here).
In one part of the code, you put your mechanism decoding the data.
You then release the whole thing as GPL.

Obviously, you work on the non-obfuscated code. You need to use or build
a software to obfuscate the code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_code says there are open-source
software to do so).

Then, for the ethic part: you also share any improvement you do in
non-obfuscated format (except maybe the data-decoding part). I wonder
though if the major part of the  data-decoding part could be generic
enough to be shared as (non-obfuscated) GPL code. Then other sensitive
projects may reuse it.
Is the whole approach ethical? I really don't know. Still, it would be
funny to receive a dataset with a notice: to read this geotiff, you must
use our version of QuantumGIS, not ArcGIS or Mapinfo! 


EDIT: not sure the approach above is OK, see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1086445/obfuscation-and-gpl
However GPL encryption software do exist. Maybe the data provider could
give the data with a key. Of course it makes the system much weaker.
However, the client should be aware that an external compiled piece of
code is not much less easy to crack than it is to change an open source
software.

A final note:
I believe in free software and in free geo data. I contribute to QGIS
and to OpenStreetMap. I've produced some of OSM icons and released them
in public domain.
However, piracy exists and I condemn it; some organizations may
rightfully search ways to protect themselves against unauthorized used
of their data. I prefer companies that share their data, but as long as
you contribute yourself to QGIS in other domains, then you would learn
something from this work and I would say it's better than if they pay
ESRI developers to do the same. 
Still, if you can find another client/boss which is more open source
minded, then I would encourage you to refuse this task. Otherwise, I'll
pray for you soul!

Hope this helps,
Mayeul

Great! What's the minimal QGIS version required?

if you meant what's the minimal version to use the Import Vector Layer
feature (and to do the same things I did in the video), then you need to
compile the latest master [1] or just wait for a nightly-build.

BTW, DBManager needs only psycopg2 and/or pyspatialite libs to work
with PG and SL databases.
I set QGis minimum version to 1.5 even if there's no a really required
version, if you have a newer version you can use more features,
it's easy! :)

I agree that obfuscated source code is against the spirit of the GPL- 'The
?source code? for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it'. There's also the remote possibility of a motivated
party working to de-obfuscate if the dataset is juicy enough.

I'd say that encryption is the answer here - hang the security on the key
rather than the code. If the requirement is explicitly "should be only
visible and usable through the customized qgis and not by any other tool.",
then use GPG[1] or something[2] and add a "File > Load Encrypted Dataset"
dialog or some such. I would imagine this to be a reasonable solution.

Hi,

I am just curious what is happening in FOSS4G 2011 Denver especially about QGIS.

http://twitter.com/#!/search/QGIS

http://twitter.com/#!/search/FOSS4G

Did Pirmin and Alex showed the latest DB Manager plugin capabilities
to these guys?

Anyway, here's the link of material of the QGIS workshop.

Sadly no, we did not show that plugin. I haven't even had a chance to
try it myself yet. Might have been a little too cutting edge for that
crowd. Maybe if I get a chance tonight I'll try to put it into a
lightning talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the update.

The drag and drop feature of the DB Manager plugin between canvas,
shapefile, postgis and spatialite would probably WOW the audience.

Please show it to them.

Thanks.

I think that this is not the case depicted by Giovanni; if I 
understand well he wants to prevent the letitimate user (which 
receives the datasets) from using them freely.

This is a sort of tivoization [1] on software + data.

Encryption prevents the use of data only from the non-legitimate 
users.

Even when the data is encrypted on disk, they are freely accessible
within QGIS. The user has many opportunities how to access raw data:
- save the layer to another format
- copy all features to another layer
- save the data in python console
- save the data in a plugin

will be chosen, and consequently the road to achieve them.

 Simplest, but if you send the key in plaintext then you might as well
send the data in plaintext - either could be intercepted!

 Better is for them to send you a public key, you encrypt the data
with that and send it to them, then they decrypt it with their private
half of the key. The data is always sent encrypted, and the decryption
key never travels.

 The keyphrase you are missing here is "DRM" - Digital Rights
Management - although I agree it essentially obfuscation. Its security
depends upon two things: the code having the cryptographic key to
decrypt the data, and the key not being accessible outside the code.

 The first part is easy - the second is impossible. I think every DRM
scheme has been cracked. The effort required varies. If you wrote a
Python plugin to do this, the user could look at your Python code and
see the decryption key (difficulty level: easy). If you wrote it in
C++, the user could disassemble the executable code and get the
encryption key (difficulty level: medium). If you put the code on a
circuit board, stuck it on a USB dongle, and made QGIS do calls to the
USB device to do the decryption, the user could take the USB device
apart, scrape off any epoxy covering your chips, stick digital logic
probes onto the chips, and get the keys out that way (difficulty
level: God-mode).

 The latter procedure, of digging into the hardware, has been done by
dedicated people working on cracking the DRM on games consoles,
primarily so they can run their own programs and operating systems on
them. You have to realise that an effective DRM scheme has to be
harder to crack than the gain obtained from cracking it. The guys who
crack games console DRM get the gains of massive respect from the
games community :)

 +1 for calling it obfuscation and not encryption though. The British
Library didn't get that right.

Got a question about the OSGeo4W nightly update builds.

I notice that the latest QGIS build version display is 1.8.0-78.

This has not changed in over a week.

I just want to make sure that this version is correct as I am use to seeing
updates as least every other day normally.

Thanks again for the hard work put into QGIS from all participants.

Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

Thanks,

That's a great point - I was envisioning a scenario in which end users are
to be (mostly) trusted not to take efforts to re-distribute the data.

 The simplest solution might be to encrypt the data and send the key to your

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9aBuv+jt59RhzsWh89s++DbsO_wEVEyj1AjaTJGUeZ8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Last night I thought it might be cool to try and implement auto saving for
layers that are in edit mode in QGIS.  There was a request [1] opened up a
while ago and while a plugin could have been made to fill the hole I think
that this kind of stuff is nice to have built in.

So I had a go at adding it myself.  The idea is that you can set the auto
save interval, in milliseconds (will change to seconds), for each layer.
 After that a timer fires at the interval and saves the layer for you.  I
thought a per-layer auto save feature is better then a blanket auto save for
all as it gives the user more control.

I added a checkable button in a dropdown style button (like measure tools)
under the normal save button, that when selected asks the user for a
interval and then enables autosaving.

The branch for my changes are at
https://github.com/NathanW2/Quantum-GIS/tree/autosave I would love if people
would be able to test it for me and make sure I haven't made any mistakes
while coding (still newish to Qt & C++).

 I wrote a plugin that autosaves projects (not layers) - instead of
firing a timer off I added a signal handler to the renderComplete
signal that checks to see if the project had been saved in the past N
minutes. If not, then the autosave happens.

 This means that the system isn't saving pointless changes every N
minutes if nothing has happened, and there's no possibility of
multiple timer events queueing up. It also means if the user has just
saved the project manually then the autosave doesn't bother doing it
again within N minutes.

Obviously it relies on renderComplete signals being emitted but these
happen every time you do almost anything that changes the project.

 Code is on google code for your perusal:
http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fautosave

 +1 for layer autosaves from me!

Thanks for the feedback Barry.

I did have a look at your code when I started working on the auto save layer
thing.  I didn't take that approach as I didn't think relying on renderComplete
would work with saving layers.  In my mind I would like QGIS to check for a
auto save every N minutes even if I'm not pan or rendering a map, say I'm
setting up a tool or messing with the composer.  Or I leave my workstation
and forget to save (of course auto saving is not an excuse for being lazy
and not hitting the save button).

I am able to add a check in the timeout method that will check to see if the
layer is modified and if it's not then don't bother saving.   Could even
reset the timer for that layer if the person saves the layer manually. That
way we don't get a save check right after a manual save.

Thoughts?

 Good point. With my system the most you'll lose is if an autosave
happens and then you work like mad for N-1 minutes and then go take a
break for a while and you trip over the power lead on the way back.
With a timer system you can still lose N-1 minutes work if you trip
over the power lead on the way out :)

 I think I may have initially tried the timer method, but possibly
switched to signals after having some isses with python and QTimers
and possibly threads. It will be interesting to see how its done with
timers.

Hi,

I think it would be very useful to have autosave - however, the one
drawback one will have is that you loose the ability to undo changes.

This is not primarily an autosave issue but an issue with "save" in
general. As a use it is very annoying that the undo queue is emptied
through a save. And other software (like OpenOffice, Inkscape, Gimp)
works differently - it still offers undo

Are there any major difficult problems to solve to allow an undo/redo
queue across multiple saves?

Hi

Just to update those waiting for 1.7.1, I was hoping to put it out
this weekend but got delayed with bug hunting on the backported raster
stuff. I'll hopefully get it out during the course of this week. Keep
applying non destabilising backports & fixes in the mean time if you
have them.

Tim,

Would we be able to get someone to have a look at and apply any patches that
are still pending on http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues There
are a few ready to be merged into master and backported to 1.7.1.

Mainly:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4290
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4283
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4155

and maybe:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4173

Regards,
Nathan

yes, it seems that for the ellipse marker the size scale field is not

Yes, I can confirm on Trunk (~ one week old) on Win7.

Now I click the layer name first then click the show/hide box. The present behaviour could be correct though because when you click on the show/hide box the focus is set to that layer anyway. 

What about leaving the focus on the layer it is on, say Layer1, when the show/hide box of, say Layer2, is clicked?

Cheers,
Benoit

I would like to point to one annoying issue, which can be taken to
account when implementing any autosave feature.

When editing layer (for example PostGIS) and adding some attribute data,
user can fill attribute table with some invalid values. After some time
(few object added, few modified) he wants to save (or autosave).

Just at this time, data storage starts to complain with invalid data,
which will result in unsuccessful saving. By my experience with PostGIS,
it is really impossible to find out which data is invalid, even if
database is logging all SQL commands.

Neverless, autosave can be nice feature.

I am not aware of any difficult problems preventing that - technically
we just need an option _not_ to clean the undo stack (and not to exit
the editing mode) when committing changes.

Looks an easy fix.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 64bit version for Windows
Message-ID: <5210a7142f9598fc185e0bc9d355fec8@carto.net>

 Hi,

 There are more and more 64bit Windows machines around me (luckily). As 
 a result I sometimes get the question if a 64bit QGIS Windows version 
 exists. I am personally also working on a Win7 64bit machine, but I am 
 using the OSGeo4W 32bit version - which works fine but doesn't profit 
 from an increased availability of memory, etc.

 Question:
 * how hard/how much work would it be to build a 64bit Windows version?
 * Would the benefits gained be worth the effort or would one hardly 
 note any difference between a 64bit version and the current 32bit 
 version?

 Thanks for your thoughts on this topic.

 Andreas

 Hi,

 I sometimes have the same annoying behavior. It appears more frequently 
 on Windows but sometimes also on Ubuntu Linux. This has been a problem 
 for a while, but only appears in some cases, not all cases. Hard to 
 replicate ... but annoying.

You want pyspatialite for QGIS Mac OS X?

Here is instruction how to patch / install pyspatialite for QGIS.

http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0-4/splite-python.html

Just follow the instruction spatialite and qspatialite will work in QGIS.

Hi everyone .
My problem is that I am unable to create a new postgis layer and also having
problem in saving the changes made on it.
I am able to open an already existing postgis layer but i don't know how to
create a postgis layer at runtime and also, suppose i
have opened a postgis layer and I am doing some kind of manipulation on it,
then how will I be able to save it

(presently I am doing it by connection python to the postgis using psycopg2
but I want to know whether there is any
qgis api available for it to happen)

 In QGIS you cannot create a new Postgis layer without the help of a 
 Plugin. You can use the Postgis manager plugin or the new db manager 
 plugin. Both are python plugins.

 Alternatively you can create a new empty Postgis layer in pgAdmin3 (I 
 usually go this route for maximum flexibility) or with the text-based 
 psql client. See 
 http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-1.5/ch04.html#Create_Spatial_Table

 Or are you looking at ways to create a new Postgis-Layer with Python? 
 Maybe have a look at the source code of the above mentioned plugins?

BTW, there is no pyspatialite package available for any platform, AFAIK.

You have to do the hack setup,py as mentioned in order for any
spatialite plugin to work in QGIS.

It should be in my Sqlite framework.  (It's really just a simple alias to pysqlite.)

I would also love to see a 64bit version, maybe this would make the jump
to a newer python in OSGeo4w somewhat simpler too by being able to leap
frog the 32bit version without having to wait for everything.

My users are power users and would benefit greatly from speed increases
of 64 bit. Is 32bit QGIS restricted to less than 4 GB of ram when on a
64bit Windows? If so my users would benefit here, all new machines in my
lab have 8 GB of ram or more.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Paolo,

I think it is a known bug when you launch the plugin for the second time
on the same raster. I was thinking I did fix it. Are you using the
latest version of the plugin?

A work around is to delete the file rastername.bccPAL1 located in the
same folder as the raster file.

Cheers,
Benoit

Then I will have to investigate further.

Is it happening with the same raster or with different ones?
Do users have write rights to the raster folder?

Hi all.
We're getting an error with:

I guess the plugin is trying to write to a non-writable format. In this
case, could we filter the list of formats to write to?
All the best.

Did QGIS crash while you were using the labels dialogue, when you closed it or a little while later? 

I have the same setup as you describe, except 64-bit and don't seem to be having problems with your test file. 

The filename looks weird. The projection is coming up as a custom CRS and is definitely weird. Labels fine.

-ramon.

Then I'm afraid I'm out of my depth, and you'll have wait for one of the more experienced folk.

A passing thought; I've had problems with the new symbology + print manager when it took exception to one polygon in my shape file (for no apparent reason). This showed up in DebugView, and Andreas spotted it for me. If you ran DebugView while playing with the new labels, it might tell you what was wrong a little more precisely. (or you could add bits of the log here, and that would help someone tell you what was wrong).

-ramon.

This does not backport - there are too many changes in qgisapp for it
to patch in it seems. I'll look and see if it can be manualy done.

Also does not apply cleanly to the relase branch. Will need more investigation.

Backported patches for above welcomed :-)

Hi Luca, Werner

@Luca : Good thanks have done.

@Werner : ok in this case since the fix is already a commit I simply do :

git cherry-pick 0d91c81f3dd211adadbe2f4929895088d529b69c

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem configuring own repository/plugins
Message-ID: <1786A86EC0804F37B416D90A967EC8F2@amd64x2>

I'm trying to load my second test plugin to my own repository. The first
installs into QGIS without difficulty, but I'm missing something with the
second. 
I get a message from the plugin installer that "Plugin has disappeared" -
actually it doesn't install in its own directory but puts its files and
sub-directory directly into python\plugins.
I've clearly got something wrong, but as far as I can see the plugins.xml
entries only differ by file name and the zip file structure looks the same.
What actually determines exactly where the files are written?

Hi all,

I made another one of those videos showing the QGIS version control history.
 This one shows all the changes between release 1.6 and 1.7.  The big influx
of activity in November is pretty interesting.

The OSGeo download server has been running on a backup copy since a
power outage in San Diego. We hope to have something up next week so
that regularly scheduled uploads of packages can resume. Until then
nightly builds probably can't be uploaded without changes to the
existing workflow.

I should also state, that source code and nightly builds for linux are
not affected, only OSGeo4w is affected. So if you want to build
yourself, now would be a chance to learn.

I knew that I had to have been stupid - what I'd missed was that the zip
file needs to hold the plugin's directory with all needed files within it.
My problem was a zip file that included all contained files, but not the top
directory.
So, to answer my original question, it seems that the zip gets unpacked "as
is" into python\plugins - the XML just defines where to find the zip file
initially.

Hi list

Sorry for the noise, but I just want to bring some attention to bug #4302.

Being able to visualize data using the GEOS projection would be a big
plus for people working with meteorological satellites, like me ;)

I guess I am hitting two separate issues, one of them seems to be
related to map canvas rendering and the other to raster OTF
reprojection.

Cheers

Message-ID: <CALCNqkar1dtkcxtNdZbURSmF-oWKfAUqK1pr+rPMX3G5Li1YUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Tonight I have tagged version QGIS final-1_7_1 - the first maintenance
release on the 1.7.x branch. The source tarball is here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.1.tar.bz2
and the md5 checksum is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.1.tar.bz2.md5

You can check out this tag using:

git fetch origin
git checkout final-1_7_1

If packagers would be so kind as to update http://download.qgis.org
with links to their latest wares, it will be appreciated. I'll give a
few days (and until we have Windows binaries at minimum) before making
the announcement to the world.

Please note that I have reinstated maintenance of the CHANGELOG file
in the root of the source tree, so consult that (or the
help->about->whats new? tab after building) to see what changes were
made. Some of the last minute commits will not be mentioned there.
There are no new features in the release, only bug fixes and small
tweaks.


I will continue to maintain the 1.7 branch for a future 1.7.2 release.
Those wishing to work against that branch should please do:

git fetch origin
git branch --track release-1_7 origin/release-1_7

1.7.2 will be branched off that closer to the time of release. If you
are working on master, please continue to label bugfixes and other
backportable (no gui changes / new features please) work using
[BACKPORT] in your commit message.


Best regards

Now that many core issues are solved, cosmetic issues are more apparent:

I have encountered an elusive problem: when digitizing, merging two

use the data from one of the objects. Concatenation, minimum, maximum

works well on another machine.

In my mind this will be very much the mission of 2.0 - as well as
making all the internals clutter free and consistent, we must work to
make the ui the same. I hope to spend the upcoming hackfest working to
build more re-usable widgets (as we have discussed and planned in
Lisbon). Building a good widget library I believe will be a key step
towards achieving this consistency and will have the benefit on
centralising fixes that then propogate themselves to all parts of the
UI that use that widget, The projection selector widget is a really
good example of the mileage we can get from this approach - it is used
in various parts of the ui and in many plugins.

There are some key things I think need to be done:

- adopt an activity based interface: e.g. the print composer,
georeferencing tool and other parts of the app that also implement a
main window ui are all kinds of wrong. There should only be one main
window and set of menus in any application, so we need to implement
the appropriate changes such that the menus etc update according to
the context of the work (activity) you are doing. In the courses I
give, people generally lose the composer window and it is not uncommon
to see them with ten instances of composers as they lose it and create
new ones in succession.

- Implementing the symbology ui better. We need some kind of tree
interface (we discussed this at the hackfest in Lisbon in some
detail). New symbology is very confusing when you have symbols
composed of symbols that are themselves composed of symbols. Managing
that causes many levels of windows to be spawned and novice users
(advanced users too I guess) can quickly lose track of where they are.

- We need to look at how simple interactions work and streamline them.
For example, label rotation is a nice new feature but its almost
impossible to get the alignment you want interactively.

- We need to identify parts of the user interface that are 'advanced'
and hide them away from casual users.

- We need to apply sensible defaults and work towards the element of
least surprise.

- We should start thinking about implementing a telemetry layer in
QGIS - with ~200 000 possible users out there, if even just 10% of
users allow us to collect telemetry data it will be a goldmine of
information (it will make a nice GSOC project). Know where users
click, how often, which dialogs they spend most time in, etc etc can
prove invaluable in targeting places that need improvement most.

I could keep on going all day about all the other things we need to
do. This hackfest I was thinking it would be nice to try to do the
planning and meeting stuff before the time as much as possible (via
wiki / mailing list) so we can come prepared in small teams ready to
reaaly focus on working. I enjoyed Lisbon very much but I felt we
spent too much time meeting and discussing stuff and not enough hands
on time so it would be great to address that. Anybody coming who is
interested in forming part of a GUI overhaul team lets get the ball
rolling and put our plans in place here

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Version2GuiRevision  (just a place holder
page for now  - we can flesh it out in the run up to Zurich).

Hi Benoit,

This workaround works.

A couple of questions: it would be very hard to apply directly the
colormap after clicking on "create"? It is not very handy to have to go
an pick the .txt file.

Why not saving the colormaps in .qml files?

I've updated the download page for OS X.

I wonder, can something be done about the css for the wiki?  It's very hard to distinguish header levels.  There are 2 groups, the top levels in plain text, the bottom levels in bold, and within each only a point or 2 difference in type size.

ie is Older releases a subsection of MacOS X or a new section - you can't tell without looking at the table of contents.

Maybe some indentation (would help keep track of long sections).  Or more difference in type sizes.

Yes, you can.... (a bit contrived perhaps!)

The selected colour palette name is added to the bottom drop-down
listbox after you click 'Create'. If you 'Create' more than one colour
table you end up with a list of colour palettes in that drop-down listbox.
Select one of them and then click 'Done'. Your raster should now be
'coloured' with that selected colour table, no need to load the .txt
file anymore...

P.S. The help page should explain the procedure....

Laziness & inexperience, surely! Still learning...

Hi Tim.
Thanks a lot for your thoughts - I found all of them really
enlightening.
All the best, and see you in Zurich.

Grr, I should have tried Firefox as a comparison before griping.  Safari is totally f'ing up the css.

Where the css says (ie for the "MacOS X" section and "Release" subsection):

h1 { font-size: 160%; font-weight: bold; }
h2 { font-size: 140%; font-weight: normal; padding-left: 30px;}

It's reading:

h1 { font-size: 160%; font-weight: normal; }
h2 { font-size: 150%; font-weight: normal; }

In Safari's element inspector it's referencing the correct line in the css, but using the wrong data.

Did you add the padding as well as changing font sizes?  Maybe safari's cache is still using the old css, even though it's downloading the updated css.

And I should try emptying caches before more griping.

Safari is now displaying the updated css.  Much better.  Maybe a bit much on the indent.

Hi,

I can confirm that on Windows works, but on Linux (Ubuntu and Debian) it doesn't with the error message that Paolo already described.

I don't think so. It would be hard to update the plugin in order to
delete this file when exiting the tool?

I have to give a training course starting from tomorrow and I would like
to show your plugin, that -for what it is worth- I still think should be
integrated into core QGIS.

Sorry, I missed it.

Another thing I noticed now is that when opening the tool it seems to
ignore the already available .txt colormaps (they do not show in the
dropdown).



thanks in advance

Noticed another bug:

when applying a colortable with QGIS now you see it in the TOC with
values beside colors. 

With colortables created with your plugin in the TOC are visible only
the colors but beside the values are not shown.

Yes, it was the behaviour before some changes have been made to the API.
I do have a version that add values (Labels) but is it not really
debugged for release as yet...

In fact the plugin is trying to read the bccPAL1 file to get the
histogram object. This was done before the changes to the raster API
committed not so long ago. I suppose this file is now obsolete as I can
read the xml (histogram) file generated when QGIS reads a raster file.
Still thinking how best to go about it...

Sorry, it is too late for me to provide an updated version of the
plugin, will see what I can do tomorrow.
I think Tim was working on a C++ equivalent but I do not know how far he
as gone on this path, Tim?

In fact the plugin does not remember what colour tables it has already
created and does not read the txt files either. This could be something
to add, thanks.
The dropdown listbox is filled every time you click 'Create' and emptied
when the plugin exits.

Benoit

The tricky thing is that I cannot find a general pattern as to when it
happens.

More or less, all self compiled in these days from git. The one with
more errors is rev #1a70ddd.

Dear all

In November this year I will be giving a talk on the social and
humanitarian impact of the QGIS project. As such I am looking for
examples and case studies where QGIS has been used to promote human
upliftment, aid in disaster management, improve the lives of people
and so on. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has been
involved in such projects or has knowledge of such activities would
contact me so that I can get more information. Accompanying resources
with photos of QGIS being applied in these projects and of situational
state out in the field at the time of these events would also be
awesome.

I hope to use my talk to show in a concrete way that QGIS is more than
just a toy - its really helping to change peoples lives.

I look forward to hearing from you!

I'm sure you will do anyway, but I might as well say it: Please think
carefully about this sort of major change, as the current system works
very well as soon as you understand about working with multiple windows.

It can be very useful to have a number of windows open at the same time,
especially attribute tables and composer windows.
1) it is good to be able to look at several windows side by side
2) it provides a way to quickly switch between a few that you are
actually working with, so you don't need to keep searching for them in a
very large list.

What will an "activity based interface" look like, and will it provide
for these situations?  Will it work with multiple screens (and virtual
desktops), e.g. so you can have an attribute table on one screen and the
main window on another?

Will it really be better?  It seems you could end up removing powerful
functionality, essentially using a sledgehammer to break an egg, and not
really improving much.

Maybe you could achieve the same benefits by minor improvements to the
existing gui, e.g.

- add one or more widgets which allow the user to switch which layout or
attribute table is shown in the current window (Menu?  List?  Spinbox).

- change how features are accessed, to make them more (or less?) easy to
find and use.  Currently the "New print composer" menu item stands out
more than the items in the "Print composers" submenu.  It might be good
to rename the "Print composers" submenu to "Open print composer" or
"Show print composer", and give it an icon.  An alternative might be to
move "New print composer" and "Composer manager" to the top of the
"Print composers" submenu, with a separator between them and the list of
composers.  Similarly, on the toolbar there is a button for "New print
composer", but to access an existing composer from the toolbar you need
to click the "composer manager" button, select a composer, click show,
and then close the manager.  It shouldn't be this much harder to open an
existing print composer, which is a much more common task than creating
a new one.  But this could be fixed by a small change to how you open
the print composer, without redesigning the way the whole thing actually
works.

I have to echo Alisters concerns with moving to a single window system.
 MapInfo (and Arc as far as I know)  currently use a single window system
and it's a pain if you do have multiple monitors and want to use them.

In my ideal QGIS world we could have a single window system (using tabs
to separate the windows) but have the ability to tear each tab off into it's
own main window for a different monitor.  This model could then
be adopted for 1+N map windows and 1+N composers.   I don't think this would
be overly hard to achieve but would just require some thinking with how the
UI behaviors in each situation.

Here is a idea using Visual Studio 2010 as an example
http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/zainnab/windowslivewriter/thebestofvisualstudio2010freeyourdocumen_761d/image_thumb.png


The window that is highlighted is normally docked in the main VS window
however you can break it out into its own window if you need in order to
use multiple monitors (very handy!).

This is a concept that I can up with the other day for handling the composer
list thing and tab interface http://imgur.com/8aA1W The idea is we just have
one list with the tabs (or windows) to handle the map canvas/es and
composers.  In the case of the tree view when clicking on a item header (eg
Map Window or Composer 1 etc) the tab would switch focus to that window/tab
and set up the controls for the tab/window.  Using this model would allow
you to also drag layers from a map window into a composer map frame as
technically the composer map frame and map window are not 1:1 always with
layers sets. Being able to see what layers are in what frame would also be
handy IMO.

Just my thoughts for this at the current time.

The proposal to work in small teams sounds good to me. That way, people can 
really work continuously on one topic.
For me, a 'geometry redesign working group' would be an interesting topic.

One thing to consider already during the developer meeting is a timeline that 
includes the time after the meeting. In a common situation, people don't 
easily find the time to finish what they begun during the meeting. Don't know 
how that can be avoided.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Tim,
moving 'Changelog' to 'doc/changelog.t2t' (commit
1590839f24985695c4a751da45947468965314f2) is making problems in Debian
packaging (dh_installchangelogs ChangeLog in debian/rules).
Debian packaging for Squeeze is failing now.

Sorry, I could point this sooner.

Hi again,
Some more comments.  In case anyone gets bored by the first lot (further
discussion of single/multiple windows), the second lot are regarding
Nathan's tree widget suggestion.

Maybe a little off-topic, but with QT, when you tear off two things, is
it _ever_ possible to dock them to each other, like it is with .NET?  It
isn't currently possible with the dockable panes in QGIS... but it would
be very handy.

Back on topic, if you can tear off a composer layout or an attribute
table, it will really need to take any relevant part of the menu with it
(if applicable - currently there is no menu for the attribute table).
Even if it was _possible_ to control it from a menu in the main window
(which might be hidden or on a different virtual desktop), it would be
confusing.  Likewise, the main window will need to show menus relevant
to whatever is displayed in it, not the menus relevant to the torn-off
window (even if that has focus).
And the torn-off window will need its own taskbar and alt-tab entries to
be really useful.  In which case it must be a separate main window after
all, surely?  This would be similar to opening a web site in Firefox in
a new window vs a new tab.

I like to e.g. edit features in an attribute table on one screen and
switch between looking at the main QGIS window, and something else
(Excel, firefox...) on the other screen.  If the attribute table isn't a
separate top-level window, I don't think this is possible* because when
the attribute table is focused, the main QGIS window will automatically
be raised above the other program.
Perhaps someone could enlighten me: _why_ should the application have a
"single main window and set of menus".  Is it simply to conform with HIG
guidelines for something like KDE?  Are those guidelines really
appropriate for a desktop GIS?  The components of a desktop GIS (map,
print composer, attribute table editor...) perform quite distinct tasks,
and the way I personally use them it is sort of like they are separate
applications.  Like you say, Nathan, this is one of the great advantages
of QGIS.  But it is more than simply being able to use several different
components at the same time, some on different screens.  It is good to
be able to manage them along with any other window, putting some on
different virtual desktops and having them at different places in the
stacking order, etc.

* unless using a window manager's "always on top" feature.

That's a fantastic concept.
Here are some thoughts (I guess you are already thinking them):
- Does there really need to be any difference between a "Map Window" and
a "Map Frame"?  They could be exactly the same.  You could click on a
"Map Frame" and choose to view it (which would behave like a "Map
Window" e.g. for zooming and panning), or you could click on the
composer which contains it, and choose to view that (which would behave
like a sheet of paper).
- You could add a map frame to a composer as a "link" (with a little
icon shown), so if you add or remove layers in the source map they would
be updated automatically.  You could choose to "unlink" the frame so
that they do not update.
- You could add a layer to a map frame as a "link", so that if the
symbology is changed in the source map it is updated automatically.  You
could choose to "unlink" the layer so that it does not update.

This would provide a sensible UI for what Mapinfo tries to achieve with
its ridiculous system of composer windows tied to map windows,
essentially:
(1) multiple map windows (which some people request for QGIS);
(2) different layers in different composer layouts / composer map
frames;
But with the improvements:
(3) you don't need to have every map window open all the time (in
Mapinfo if you close a map window you lose all the layouts connected to
it);
(4) zooming/panning in a map window would not ruin your composer; and
(5) layering and symbology in one map could be linked to another map.

I guess the other issue is that you might want to link map contents
(layers) to one map and link map extents to another map.  One way to
implement this would be to have in the tree a "map extents" entry for
each map frame.
And rather than using an icon to indicate linking I guess it would
probably make more sense simply to gray out the linked item.

I also would be concerned about a purely 1 window approach. 

Taking an example from my routine work, it is extremely useful to be able to retain the georeferencer window open as it allows me to visually confirm my control points are where I'm expecting them to be. 

-ramon.

The rest of this is some examples from a closed source program[1] that reflects some of what I think Nathan is suggesting. I'm not remotely saying it should look like or work like this - it's just an example.

On the left of a set of dialogue boxes that can be nested. As default the top half has three nested dialogues that show forms (approx saved styles), Properties (what the info tools creates), and Sections (approx map bookmarks).
Below that is a Display dialogue that shows windows that are open. These can also be reached and reordered by tabs across the top, just below the menus. 

I can't pull the main windows out onto a different screen, but I can pull the dialogue boxes out around the place, so top right shows the properties box being pulled around. If I drag onto one of the little arrow-like things, it docks against the edge of the window, e.g. Bottom right. Otherwise you can let it go somewhere, including a different screen and it stays there. 


1. I *think* this is the last piece of propietary software I have to use. If anyone can think of an OSS/FOSS equivalent, I'm curious to know.

Just to clarify, I was *not* suggesting a purely one window approach,
I was suggesting that should only be one *Main Window*.  That is only
one menu should exist in the application. Try this as an experiement:
open the georeferencer, enable dock mode in its settings and then dock
it into the main window. Now you get a dock with menus and the main
window with more windows. This is just plain wierd UI wise. My
suggestion was rather than we adopt an activity based view where the
main window menus update according to the context of what you are
doing. Just try opening openoffice and switching between normal view
and print preview to see what I had in mind - the toolbars adjust
themselves and menu items grey out based on your context. I would
expect that we will adopt a tabbed interface to QGIS (with possiblity
to tear of tabs as floating windows) and that based on the kind of tab
you have open, we would adjust the menus and toolbars and other
contextual information accordingly.

@Nathan and @Alister thanks for your comments - I'll formulate a more
detailed reply to your points tonight!

Tim

Interesting: why not adding a case study to
http://qgis.org/en/community/qgis-case-studies.html
To all users: please send us your case studies; it is good for the
project, and for all other users, to have a rich page showing the
variety of tasks that can be done.
All the best.

Marco,

I tried to create an account to add my name (yes I should be there for 
translating user doc) but the special page said "The action you have requested 
is limited to users in the group: Administrators."

I though I have an account but before the migration.

Thanks,

Y.

 Hi,

 When trying to checkout the recent src I get this error:

 error: gnutls_handshake() failed: Key usage violation in certificate 
 has been detected. while accessing 
 https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git/info/refs

 fatal: HTTP request failed

 My guess is that my proxy is blocking the checking of the certificate?

 Did anyone have a similar error message and knows how to resolve it?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Forget my previous email, using a correct username resolved the problem :)

I will be happy to work on french translation and meet QGIS dev!

Looks like Stefan had the same problem.

As we don't have strong rules here, consider it a personal favor to me.

 Hi,

 I read this thread from Stefan, but it seems to be a different issue. 
 It is complaining about the SSL key being invalid.

 It all started when the IT department of my employer installed a new 
 proxy. Some issues I could already resolve, some are still open. In this 
 case it looks like the proxy is somehow interfering with https 
 connections and the certificates.

 You don't know how I hate this proxy. Some day I will install my own 
 internet access at my work-place ...

Yes but maybe distilled down to a few simple points - that rfc is a
bit heavy to read. Rather something like:

- please disable html mode in your mail client
- please post inline, inserting your comments after each point in the
original poster's message
- please clip away extraneous / irrelevant content from the thread as
the conversation goes on
- please don't email posters offlist unless specifically invited to do so
- please refrain from using expletives and making inflammatory comments
- if you disagree with someone, please provide a considered and
logical response explaining why a different approach should be taken

etc

Maybe we can add a link at the bottom of each message using mailman
pointing to the page containing similar content to the above list.

Regards

Tim

Frankly I do not believe that posting these rules (or a link to them)
will improve the communication :-) ... mainly because the people who
do not respect the usual netiquette also tend to ask wrong questions,
do not read documentation or even forget to sign themselves at the end
of a mail.

That's why I proposed one-week-mailinglist-suspension!

Thanks for your help.
Just had reinstalled again (same repositories, using Synaptic) all
qgis related packages before lunch and it works fine now.
Cannot understand why, I have always upgraded using the Upgrade
Manager and never had this problem. Also,
no errors were reported after the first upgrade. Perhaps some of the
packages have actually been changed in the
ubuntugis-unstable repository between the two upgrades?

Anyway, I was kind of worried of not being able of going back to
1.7.0, as 1.7.0 was not on either ubuntugis stable or
unstable. Next time, could the previous version be kept somewhere
(stable, test, unstable)?

This is the output you were asking for, a pity I did not do it before
the second upgrade. Nevertheless, I did check with Synaptic
and the versions of all those marked here as ii were the same. Except
qgis-sqlanywhere1.7.1, that was not installed:

 I've looked at these sorts of wireframe mockup builders a bit - but
for Qgis, a Qt application, isn't it just easier to drag n drop stuff
around using QtDesigner? Then you not only know you are using widgets
from the right toolkit, but you can also directly test your interface,
you can write little python test harnesses, and you dont end up having
to redo your design in a different system once you've finalised it.

Indeed. From my own experience I'd say the only means for getting along
with annoying postings is simply to ignore these posts.  Maybe, as an
add-on, you might consider to occasionally reply with just a templated
pointer to your netiquette.

Hi All,
I am developing tiled vector rendering in OSSIM. I like the Qgis vector
rendering system

point.shp contains 9,99,999 points which are generated by grass for using
v.random and ~27MB in size
roads.shp contains 2,28,068 linestrings and is ~50MB in size

these point.shp and roads.shp data gets rendered in ~10 sec

When I read vector using ogr and parse feature and draw point/linestring my
application taking about 40 sec to render point.shp
and

I am using Qt4 with QPainter not QGraphicsView

How came this time gap?

i see Rtree and pal libs in src/core source code
Does they have any role in rendering?

Does QGIS Rendering uses threading?

How to get a minimal of QGIS code to hack it and build a new vector
rendering because I need it to make it tiled rendering vectors?

How to improve performance in rendering without qgis?

Most likely you have some inefficiencies in your implementation.

No - unless you also draw labels.

No - only in threading branch which has not yet been integrated.

You can use qgis_core library to do tiled drawing.

Learn how to profile programs - i.e. get time spent in individual
functions, analyze the results and fix the places where most of the
time is spent.

Hi Mohammed

> How came this time gap?

A possible reason could be the following:
In QGIS, most point renderers do some caching of the point symbols as QImage. 
So in case you invoke a QPainter->drawCircle/drawRectangle etc. command for 
every point, it helps a lot do do the rasterisation only once.

Marco

Message-ID: <CABqTJk8vFC=80LAr+Cak2sN_i4oBmqO8kNdnZktysFkM5vMokw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
actually the osgeo4w-setup on windows,
use as qgis-dev the
r1.8.0.78.
I see this from many days.
Is this really the last version available of qgis-dev ?

thx,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] RoadGraphPlugin and network-analysis annonce
Message-ID: <CAAVGT9dQveJ_Z0_nAwi7pBFsbmHO46L9UJCRTKaUE6jCE1p3uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

In my fork QGIS in the branch network-analysis is a new version RoadGraphPlugin.

Changes:
1. When the setting of "topological tolerance" value greater than zero
in the construction of the graph is almost as fast as with a parameter
equal to zero.

2. Reduced memory usage. If you are using big map of Moscow, then you
no longer need gigabytes of RAM. Only ~10 megabytes.

3. Core RoadGraph move into a separate library qgisnetworkanalysis.

4. Implemented a minimum set of python bindings. Now you can use
Python to find the shortest path.

To demonstrate the third and 4th items prepared (and well-commented) a
simple script (see attachment) and the screencast
(http://gis-lab.info/forum/download/file.php?id=3175).

What do you think? I think this is a good candidate for inclusion in
the master-branch qgis.

Thanks a lot ??????!
Any reasons why we should not include it straight away?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Copy and paste layers: sort of...
Message-ID: <CALQh+NrZTb1_zMVEif3Lp1cOPi74YWL2fsea5bsO7b2PmB+2ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
i wrote a small patch for importproject plugin (
http://code.google.com/p/bsrplugins/issues/detail?id=31) that unexpectedly
has the nice side effect of working like a copy and paste of layers.
That is you can import layers from the very same project you are working
with, with and effect equivalent to copying and pasting them.

At the moment i used it only with Postgis data source, that's what i'm
working with, and it didn't show yet any adverse effect, but i'd like that
someone more knowledgeable than me could examine it, since i'm going to need
it a lot for my projects. I don't know how it would behave with different
layer types.

If you find any problem please don't shot on the pianist. I had never seen
before neither python nor Qt nor Qgis api so i had absolutely no clue about
where i was going to end while writing it.
It was a trial and error process while trying to squeeze the needed info
from Qt and Qgis api doc as fast as possible, and by one of those incredible
chances for which you would need an infinite number of monkeys in front of
an infinite number of keyboards, with just one monkey it succeeded (at least
for my own scope).

Regards,
Gabriele

Message-ID: <1317239316.69635.YahooMailClassic@web160809.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Since I never heard from anyone. But I tried a few things and I resorted to using an "ESRI Shape File" provider (instead of "ogr") in the QgsVectorFileWriter instead of the QgsVectorLayer. The parameters are ill-defined and not properly documented. So I took the true and tired path of the past. I wrote the shapefiles to a directory using a piece of code that is shown below. It is not much different than the original but the provider is sure and it has worked for me in the past. 

void BNA::export2File(QgsVectorFileWriter* vr, FeatureMap&  mFeatureMap)
{

  if ( mFeatureMap.size()<=0)
    return;


  QgsFeature f;
 
  for ( FeatureMap::iterator it = mFeatureMap.begin(); it != mFeatureMap.end();it++)
  {
	  f = *it;
	  vr->addFeature( f );
  }
}


Can we do something to update the documentation? It is bugging me that I have to scratch my head and bang against the air and experiment to for so long before finding a solution. Is there a space for placing some sort of wiki documentation that anyone can contributes notes so that users benefit from the collective experiences of others. 

I posted the same question on the forum but that forum is not really very active except a few people who attempt to answer questions. Yet, it may be a good place to have the documentation if a wiki is not possible. 

What do you think?

Hi,
hat is your version of spatialite/QgIS.
The error message just say that the python code can't find the function
"VirtualSpatialIndex" .
I guess this is because you are using SpatiaLite <3 ... with a DB created
with SpatiaLite v3, whith the new VirtualSpatialIndex feature ?

that is not the provider name, but the output format.
QgsVectorLayer doesn't support to create new vector files, even Qgis
uses QgsVectorFileWriter to save shapefiles (and also other vector
file formats).

> The parameters are ill-defined and not properly documented.

The pyQGis cookbook contains snippets of code and well explained
examples (e.g. how to write a shapefile using QgsVectorFileWriter [1]).
Of course those are in python, but the C++ and Python API are
quite the same.

I recommend to have a look at the Qgis API [2], but IMHO many
times the pyQGIS cookbook [3] is the best way to understand how to
use some classes in your code.

> Can we do something to update the documentation?

Yes, you're welcome.
To help us in keeping documentation updated, please look at [4].

I didn't see any inconsistence in the current QgsVectorFileWriter and
QgsVectorLayer
documentation. If you have difficulties with reading API docs, look at
the PyQGIS
Developer Cookbook there are lots of well-commented code snippets in it.

Hello everyone,

in an earlier thread, the implementation of "analytical workflows"
--sets of modules with linked inputs and outputs-- was discussed.
While this can currently be attained using Python scripts, a GUI to
interactively construct these workflows would be a nice addition to
the userfriendliness of the processing framework.

Two main possible designs for this GUI came up:

Either, a "connect-the-boxes"-style GUI (a graph):

While the former seems to be a more popular choice among existing
software, I favor the latter option, because it would better handle
numerous I/Os.

Your opinion on this would be appreciated.

Hi Camilo

for me the former (a graph with boxes and arrows) is definitely much
better solution. The graph makes the structure pretty clear. With the
patchbay-style I feel quite lost how the overall data flow would look
like.

Anyway the implementation using a graph should not require a lot of
work - there is Qt graphics view framework that greatly simplifies the
whole task.

I understand the first one (graph) immediately.
I have no clue how the second one works with the lines across two
lists. From a usability perspective I'd choose the first one.

If the GUI interface is an issue, I think you can also generate a
similar tree structure from the DAGs :
Flow accumulation
+Watersheds
++Elevation: Raster layer1
++Channel Network
+++Elevation:...
+++Other option:...
++other input

In fact this is also the format you get in SAGA when you look to the
history of the file. I've attached a small example.

Perhaps this is what you ment with patchbay style, but I still don't
get what the lines mean, and why some properties would be on the left
or right.

Moreover, I think most users will be more familiar with the first
option. I would suggest following leading solutions in this area, and
having a look to GRASS Modeler:

Hi!

Working with those "workflow modellers" I found the Mathmap Plugin for 
Gimp very handy:

http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/

 From my point of view it implements all advantages of other samples 
here ..
Just to complete the list here ;)

kind regards

Hi Martin.
But AFAIK this has to be implemented in Python, not in Qt. Is there an
equivalent framework for Python?
Thanks.

Paolo,

You can access all the Qt stuff in Python via PyQt.  I'm pretty sure this is
what Martin is talking about:

Exactly - it is wrapped by PyQt since it is a regular part of QtGui
module. The graphics view framework is already being used in various
areas in QGIS: map canvas, map composer, grass raster calculator.

 HI

 If you are thinking about designing a GUI for a graphical workbench, I 
 would definitely have a look at the way FME is handling it. I think it 
 requires a combination of both approaches:

 Normally it is a graph-style (connect-the-boxes) GUI

 but often it requires in addition:

 multiple input/output, control flows, where elements from the 
 patch-style GUI would come in - eg when patching an attribute from one 
 source or transformer to a different attribute in a destination dataset 
 or transformer.

 I believe in FME (Safe software) - which is the most well-known GUI 
 modeler in GIS, it is a combination of both approaches with additional 
 flow controls transformers (e.g. tester with branches).

 I work a lot with FME - it would be very cool to have something similar 
 for QGIS workflows.

 FME workbench is also programmed with qt, by the way.

 Here is a sample screenshot from FME:

Andreas,

maybe I get it wrong, but isn't the purpose of FME somewhere else? As
far as I understand, FME is an extract-transform-load (ETL) tool for
spatial data, however here we aim for a tool for automating workflow
for analyses. Surely there is some overlap between these two, but for
now it would be better to focus on the analytical part - proceeding
one step at a time ensures that we are not designing something overly
complex.

Martin

 yes - you are right. FME is a ETL tool (like GeoKettle, Java based). I 
 still think it can be a source of inspiration. ETL may be something 
 different but it has a LOT in common with what you probably want to 
 achieve in a model builder for analytical workflows.

 I agree that we can start from something simpler and work to the more 
 complex, but maybe, for some design decisions it would be good to 
 consider later, more complex, requirements.

Hi Tim,

Between January and June 2011, I was one of the instructors for a course
that exclusively used QGIS to help high school teachers develop lesson plans
for teaching GIS to their students.  The course was called, "Putting Western
Mass. on the Map: A Course in GIS."  This may not be one of the most
glamorous uses you will come across, but I'd be glad to pass on more
information if it is useful.

Isn't this ultimatly just processing input to output - and deciding whether the
process is "analysis" or "transformation" is just a matter of one's point of
view?

Yes generally it is the same thing, but I guess they work at a
different conceptual level.

>From my point of view an analytical tool is typically a module that
expects one or more input layers, some parameters and returns one or
more output layers. The ETL tools typically work on a different level
of abstraction - parsing files, aggregating fields, joining fields of
other tables and maybe producing output in a different syntax...

Comparing GUIs for spatial analyses (esri model builder, sextante
etc.) and ETL (FME, GeoKettle) they show many similarities. ETL
software generally models more complex dependencies and the workflows
seem more like visual programming than just simple concatenation of
processing modules as with analyses.

Ok.

So it seems there is (almost) a consensus on the graph option, mostly
because of familiarity. Perhaps later with elements of patchbay for
complicated cases.

In terms of implementation difficulty, I think neither is too
complicated, as soon as we have the right underlying models. I have
been experimenting with the QGraphicsView/Model/Scene thing that
Martin mentions, while writing a prototype of the patchbay. I'll drop
that now, and see what the graph implementation could look like.

Thanks & best regards,

Camilo

	layers
Message-ID: <CAA5P-m1X7ENkOH01Ftp5VibKxV-Sagg9FWjrTcR_o37g-C0zKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,

there is another processing-framework-related issue I would like your
opinion on:
The input and output layers of modules are currently stored in the
/temp directory or its windows equivalent. These files are, of course,
not persistent between sessions. Or as Paolo wrote in the processing
bug tracker[1]:

"Users should be able to save the results outside tmp, and give a
meaningful name; for vectors this is not a big issue (one could always
Save as... after analysis), but for rasters is more cumbersome.
See GdalTools for examples.
Temp files should be left only for intermediate steps; users usually
want a file as a result."

The problem is that, as far as I know, QGIS doesn't provide something
like a project directory. So what should the default path be? The
current working path?

Regards,


Camilo

+1, IMHO a modeller GUI like the Sexante one is more user-friendly.

GRASS, Sextante and other proprietary softwares employ this kind of
modelling tools, and many customers confirm its usefulness.

Hi,
I planned to maintain my FOSS4G tutorial with new or advanced features 
(http://sourcepole.com/foss4g/) as a QGIS documentation subproject. It's 
Sphinx based and prepared for translation. All needed data is on the OSGeo-
Live 5.0 DVD or VM (http://live.osgeo.org/). Shall I push it to my github 
account, or is there a better place?
Regards,
Pirmin

We didnt yet migrate the docs from svn to git (its still on my todo
list - Otto is patiently waiting for me) so it might be better to host
it in your own repo to start and then we can merge it into the docs
tree as Otto thinks is appropriate.

Dear QGIS Developers, Users and Fans!

We are pleased to announce that QGIS 1.7.1 is now available. This is a
bugfix release over version 1.7.1. (change log here [1]). Binary
downloads (see [2]) are available some are still making their way to
the download page so if you don't see your preferred OS there please
check again in a day or two. We have another developer meeting coming
up in Zurich in November (see [3]) and hope to see you there to
participate in improving QGIS even further. If you would like to
support the QGIS project, please consider making a small (or large :-)
) donation using the PayPal link on the left of our home page ( see
[4]).

I think it is always better to keep all docs in one place, so my vote
goes for the github account, as soon as this is feasible.
Thanks.
