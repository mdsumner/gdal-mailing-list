Hi John

I also tried it today and applied the modification of ticket 5114 to Qt 4.6.2 
And it works for me now with vector pdf.

But I forgot to mention that it only works with svg fill in new symbology. So 
if you are using the normal hardcoded polygon fills, it will not work (because 
they are rasters and will appear pixelated in the print). However, you could 
generate svg files with similar patterns.

Regards,
Marco

Applied in r13221.  But again modified - we still don't want to loose cursors.

Hi,
is R still installed ... in the usual place (most probably /usr/lib/R) ?
libR.so should be found in the lib folder.
...

Apparently yes:
ls -l /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2622756 15 dic 04:51 /usr/lib/R/lib/libR.so
Maybe rpy2 is incompatible with this version of R?
I have 2.10.1-2 on debian testing.
Thanks.

 Take qgis out of the equation and see if Rpy works with Python, with
'from rpy2 import *' from the python command line.

 If that works:
   then check that qgis is using the same python as your command line.

 else:
   make it work :) It's not a qgis problem any more :)

have you build rpy2 by yourself? maybe a path was not set properly or
something like that?
Unformatunately I have rpy 2.0.4, so I can not reproduce that.
As far as I can follow the code and the error it stops connecting to the
R Binary. This one probably points not to the libR.so.
So maybe something went wrong While building rpy2. That is what this is
looking to me ...
have you used easy-install, or at least modified the setup.cfg to your
needs, when build yourself?

cheers

It works, both for py2.5.5 and 2.6 (I have both).

Qgis is using 2.6

Hi all.
What does prevent us from releasing 1.5, as a post-hackfest release? Can we
make a list of the blocking issues, to see how far are we? I think some of
the additions (eg the annotations) are worth the while distributing widely
to our users. Many bugs have also been fixed since 1.4 release.
All the best.

If there is a little delay to be left (1-2 weeks*) to the translators, 
why not ? The current state is fine for me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] inaccuracy with NAD27 UTM zone 10 projection
Message-ID: <4BB4F7C7.5020009@alt2is.com>

I have two layers I am trying to overlay. One is derived from the USGS 
NED, downloaded from the website with no reprojection - it's in NAD27 
UTM zone 10 (EPSG 26710). The other is a parcel layer that was 
originally in state plane NAD83 California zone 2 (ft) (EPSG: 2226). I 
used QGIS 1.4.0 to reproject the vector layer into EPSG 26710, but when 
I display them together on a map there is an offset of the parcels about 
150 m westward. I have checked the accuracy of the original data by 
reprojecting the vector layer in another GIS (Idrisi) and in that case 
there is no offset, the two layers match up well. So I have a workaround 
for my immediate needs, but I thought you might like to know about this 
issue.  Would anyone like to check to see if they can reproduce it, or 
should I go ahead and file a bug report?

Hmm, 150m westward sounds suspiciously like the datum conversion from
NAD27 to NAD83 isn't being handled correctly.

What happens if you actually reproject the dataset to a new file and
load them?

Also there are few really similar EPSG codes for state plan (though it
shouldn't have this big of an effect) check

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New labeling with print composer
Message-ID: <004801cad23d$e5fc5dc0$b1f51940$@com>

Question re the new labelling engine. It works well on the map canvas, but
rendering in print composer has a number of problems:

 

1.       Label placement is too low. For example, with line layers, if
'above line' is selected, the label appears almost over the line, and if
'below line' is selected, the label appears well below the line. With  point
layers where 'around point' is selected, then if the label is displayed
below the point it is so far below that it can appear to be associated with
another point when points are tightly clustered.

2.       Spacing between characters in labels is all over the place.
Characters can run into each other, other have unreasonably large
separations.

 

These may be known problems, or is it specific to particular operating
systems - Windows Vista 64 in this case?

 

Tony

Hi Steffen,

I tested your elevation plugin on OS X, but it appears to be completely non-functional. It installs without issue, but loading a point layer and clicking the plugin icon or selecting it from the menu generate no response in the application. I seem to recall that some of the fTools tasks had problems triggering on OS X in the past. There may be something in that code to borrow from in order to get this working on OS X.

If you have any suggestions or patches, I'd be happy to test. Sorry I do not have any additional information for debugging.

John

Message-ID: <2a8b08740e8193a5b420233c4e16cf8c@127.0.0.1>

hey all,

ESRI announced the other day, a group of basemaps that you can connect to
and use for free.

http://resources.esri.com/arcgisonlineservices/


For the most part these maps have sufficient details and data for some
users. They also have a multitude of ways to connect to the maps as
outlined below

http://resources.esri.com/arcgisonlineservices/index.cfm?fa=content_detail&contentID=050D638A-1422-2418-A0AAA313415C3B64


Can these links be used in QGIS and if not, would there be a plan to do so?

Cheers,
Ahmed

Message-ID: <w2y8af30f561004021305i73bf0c9ckb3d1c2a65508b739@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on the ability to create a new empty layer in a spatialite
database. It works when building QGIS with an external spatialite but
not when using the version in core.

The spatialite functions (e..g AddGeometryColumn) are reported as
being non-existent when trying to create the new layer from C++.

Any thoughts on how to get access to the spatial functions using the
qgis-internal spatialite?

I quick'n'dirty added spatialite support to the new vector layer function.  [1]
is the patch. [2] is a clean spatialite template that should be put into
the resources directory in our tree.

I tried both the system's and internal spatialite and didn't run into your
problem.  What did we do different?

My implementation is independent of the spatialite provider. Calling  
spatialite_init did the trick.

All right, now it's all clear: any C or C++ module using SpatiaLite
on its own has to invoke spatialite_init() before attempting to
use spatial SQL functions.

Rationale: spatialite_init() actually registers the extended set
of SQL functions within the SQLite main core.
Until this step isn't performed the SQL data engine is completely
unaware of any 'extended' SQL function.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbology NG - rendering of selected symbols
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E06529BF6C1@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I'm wondering if we could improve the way that Qgis renders selected symbols.  

Currently it seems that the rendering loop uses a standard renderer (defined in QgsVectorLayer::drawRendererV2Levels)  for this independent of the renderer used for the layer.  Where the actual renderer generates a very distinctive symbology (in my case an oriented arrow), selected symbols don't look anything like the orginal symbology, and don't carry any of the information of the original symbology.

I'm wanting to add the flexibility for the renderer to customise this.  I was thinking that perhaps the way to do this is to add a "renderSelectedFeature" virtual function to the QgsFeatureRendererV2 interface, and implement the default functions in the QgsFeatureRenderer (maybe by instantiating the standard renderer and passing the renderSelectedFeature onto its renderFeature function, and of course handling the start and stop render functions there too)

How does this sound as an approach?

Cheers
Chris

Hi Tony

Hi Chris,

right, the rendering of selected features is somehow suboptimal. Old
symbology simply changes color of the symbol which should be drawn as
selected. This is a problem e.g. with svg symbol where the color can't
be easily changed. New symbology indeed could do it better...

I think the support for selection should have two levels:
- symbols: it should be possible to tell the symbol (resp. symbol
layer) to be drawn in "selected" mode - maybe by passing a flag in
QgsSymbolV2RenderContext. Default implementation would only change
color of the symbol to the selected color. Custom implementation
should be possible (e.g. to allow svg symbol to draw a
circle/rectangle around the symbol)
- renderers: they should be aware whether the symbol should be
rendererd in normal or selected mode. Again, default implementation
would handle that automatically, special renderers that do additional
drawing should be able to customize what should be done.

The passing of selected/not selected flag could done either by adding
a new function as you propose, or by adding a new parameter to
existing renderFeature function...

Hi all

this year I'd like to participate as a student in Google Summer of
code. For the project, I would like to do various optimizations to
make QGIS a bit faster and more responsive.

My suggestions for improvements:
- do rendering in threads. This will allow QGIS to make use of
multiple processor cores and finish rendering faster.
- allow interaction with graphical interface while QGIS is rendering.
Currently one has to wait until the rendering is finished (or
interrupted) to continue. With this feature, QGIS canvas will keep
working when rendering and will stop/restart the rendering when the
canvas extent is changed.
- investigate where the bottlenecks are during rendering process and
propose solutions to make it faster. Implement improvements where the
scope of necessary work is feasible
- concurrent access to data providers: to allow more than one
iteration at once time on a vector layer. Not having concurrent access
limits the possible usage of threading as that might result in broken
outcomes
- optional caching of vector features in memory for faster drawing of
vector layers
- faster attribute table startup (indicator of loading, use caching)
- show load progress when adding layers?

I'm sure some of you will have some further suggestions for
improvements regarding speed ans responsiveness of QGIS. I would
appreciate any ideas. It's very likely that not everything could be
implemented during the summer, so I will try to order the items by
their importance, so the less important improvements will be
implemented only if the time will allow.

Hi Martin

This would be an excellent and much needed contribution to QGIS!

Perhaps it would be possible to also add 'over rendering' to your list (like google maps and openlayers do where they prefetch tiles around the map edge) so that pan operations are instantaneous?

Hi Tim

I'd like to implement that feature - actually it's second point in my
wish list (but in very vague terms). I consider it to be one of the
key improvements to make QGIS work nicely also with huge datasets that
otherwise take ages to render completely.

I have committed the changes needed to create a new Spatialite layer

This code has been compiled and tested on OS X and Linux. It does not

Choose Layer|New|New Spatilite Layer... from the main menu. See the

That would be great, it will be again a big step forward!

Please note that there are a couple of bugs in trunk that will probably
be seen as a step back since 1.4:

* rasters icons in legend are missing
* qgis raster properties for GRASS rasters are broken: it was already
briefly discussed. My point of view is that, to avoid confusion among
users, all the GRASS raster properties that are not working should be
removed/hidden (still working are transparency, scale dependency and not
much more).

AFAIK this is not possible. Both scale bar and north arrow are
plugins. Plugins are loaded by QGIS application and they're not
accessible within core/gui libraries. Adding support for python
plugins should be possible in 3rd party python applications,
unfortunately scale bar and north arrow are c++ plugins.

After trying to optimize my project that loads layers that fall into three categories:
 * A large number of static rasters (as a background)
 * A small number of PostGIS layers that change frequently (once every couple of seconds)
 * A large number of PostGIS layers that change infrequently (once every couple of minutes)
I seem to have hit a brick wall.

It appears that QGis boils all of the loaded layers down to a single QGraphicsRectItem (QgsMapCanvasMap).  This means that in my case, I must trigger a repaint on every layer every couple of seconds, yikes!

Qt's native Graphics View Framework (http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/graphicsview.html) supports just this type of situation and does all the heavy lifting for us.  Why are we not taking advantage of this?

Currently, QgsMapCanvas instantiates a QGraphicsScene but the only item added is our QgsMapCanvasMap.  Instead, it seems like there are performance advantages to be gained by having each layer inherit from QGraphicsItem and implement its own paint().  Then only the layers that need updating can be updated and only the segment of the scene that actually changes (and is in view) will be re-drawn.

Hi Jae

Isn't it possible to use the 'render cache' option to improve speed in such 
situations (options->rendering & svg -> use render caching...)? With this 
option, every layer stores and reuses its current image if possible (e.g. one 
layer changes symbology).

Marco

Martin,

This project sounds like a great idea!

I came across the following potential optimization while trying to optimize my map refreshing in a project where I had a large number of static rasters under a small number of vector layers that were changing frequently under a large number of vector layers that were changing infrequently.  Ideally this called for the ability to refresh each layer individually and the map to only redraw the pixels that were affected by the change.

Marco,

Thanks for this suggestion.  Unfortunately this is not an option for me as I am using 1.0.2 and upgrading represents too big of a risk at this time.

I think this is a good feature addition, but I wonder if we are just re-inventing the wheel here since this feature is already supported in the qgraphicsscene (i.e. each qgraphicsitem notifies the scene of a change to a small subset of the over-all scene).

I am just reading over the graphics view architecture and stumbled on another cool feature which is that multiple views can observe a single scene.  This doesn't work for us since qgsmapcanvas (our qgraphicsview) instantiates his own scene and doesn't allow access to it.  But it would be pretty sweet to be able to pop up multiple views all with completely independent zooms.

Hi Jae

Isn't it possible to use the 'render cache' option to improve speed in such
situations (options->rendering & svg -> use render caching...)? With this
option, every layer stores and reuses its current image if possible (e.g. one
layer changes symbology).

Regards,
Marco

How long does the rendering take now and what would be an acceptable

_all_ map layers have to be rendered again even if there were some
optimizations.

This optimization is surely possible. Render caching introduced
recently actually does a very similar thing. Personally, I think that
rendering all layers into one graphics item is a better option than
having one item per layer: the blending of layers is done just once
per redraw, I believe that when using "item per layer" approach, the
rendered images of layers will have to be blended together on every
update - that means also when drawing rubber bands on top of the map
(e.g. for measuring), when panning etc. And that could be much slower.
But I may be wrong...

Hi Martin

I suppose I was thinking that the changes would need to be made in a minimal, non-breaking way, why I was thinking of adding renderSelectedFeature rather than adding a parameter to the renderFeature function, and by implementing this so it works continues to work with minimal changes for renderers which don't implement this function.  However maybe it isn't too late to make more dramatic changes - as this isn't the stable version!  

The other reason I can see for creating a separate function and implementation is that it ensures that if a new renderer doesn't provide an implementation for selected features, then they will still be visibly selected.

I think you are right in that it would be good for symbol layers to know how to render themselves when selected, and I guess just using setColor as a default implementation would work well, and give a better implementation than the current one.

With the symbol layers potentially caching symbols in the start/stop functions I'm not sure how handling the selection flag at the symbol level would work.  I guess the ideal would be for the startRender function to be passed a flag to let the renderer/symbol/symbolLayer know that they may need a selected version. 

I'm not sure I follow your thinking about using the QgsSymbolV2RenderContext to pass a selected flag, as it looks to me as if this is only created within the QgsSymbolV2 startRender, stopRender, and renderFeature funtions, where the selected status isn't available.  

I guess a boolean field in the QgsRenderContext could be used.  In the startRender function it would be used that the the renderer/symbol/symbolLayer needed to have a selected version available, and in the renderFeature function it would mean that the feature to be rendered is selected. 

Alternatively the selected flag could be added as a parameter to the startRender and renderFeature functions for the renderer, symbol, and symbol layer. 

Certainly adding the flag to the context would be less work than changing function signatures through the symbology stack.  I'm not sure which would be the "more correct" implementation?

So I guess I'm leaning towards:

1) Adding a boolean selected flag to QgsRenderContext, which is only used by the V2 renderers, used in startRender to indicate a selected symbology will be required, and renderFeature to indicate that the current feature is selected.
2) Updating QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerV2 to optionally cache and use a selected version of the image (using setColor to set the colour to the selected colour ... Should this change the border colour too?)
3) Update QgsFontMarkerSymbolLayerV2 to use the selected colour if it is selected
4) Update QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2 to cache and use a selected version of the image. Not sure how to do this?  This should include an option for defining a selected version of the symbol (but maybe not yet implemented in GUI), and also some sort of default handling - perhaps creating a picture by rendering a larger background circle in the selected colour under the SVG image.
5) Update QgsSimpleLineSymbolLayerV2 and QgsLineDecorationSymbolLayerV2 to create and optionally use a mSelectedPen, and QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2 to pass the selected flag to its marker symbol
6) Update QgsMarkerLineSymbolLayerV2 to optionally use the selected colour, and QgsSVGFillSymbolLayer to optionally fill the polygon with the selected colour before applying the SVG fill.
2) Adding a renderSelectedFeature virtual function to the QgsFeatureRendererV2 which by default just sets the QgsRenderContext flag and calls the renderFeature function


Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris,

right, the rendering of selected features is somehow suboptimal. Old symbology simply changes color of the symbol which should be drawn as selected. This is a problem e.g. with svg symbol where the color can't be easily changed. New symbology indeed could do it better...

I think the support for selection should have two levels:
- symbols: it should be possible to tell the symbol (resp. symbol
layer) to be drawn in "selected" mode - maybe by passing a flag in QgsSymbolV2RenderContext. Default implementation would only change color of the symbol to the selected color. Custom implementation should be possible (e.g. to allow svg symbol to draw a circle/rectangle around the symbol)
- renderers: they should be aware whether the symbol should be rendererd in normal or selected mode. Again, default implementation would handle that automatically, special renderers that do additional drawing should be able to customize what should be done.

The passing of selected/not selected flag could done either by adding a new function as you propose, or by adding a new parameter to existing renderFeature function...

Martin

The second item 2 on the list of proposed changes is redundant! This is handled by the flag passed to the current renderFeature function.

Martin,

That's hard to say since one man's fast is another man's slow.  From an application point of view I think the right answer is, can it be faster?  For my situation where only one point is changing I would expect the fastest to be how fast can a single point be read from a database, the point drawn on the map, and the pixels vacated by the point be drawn on the map.  This should be blazing fast.  As it stands now this takes (depending on what else is loaded) upwards of a second to do.  Considering the gui is not accepting input during this second, it feels more like an eternity for the user.

I don't see why all the layers need to be refreshed on a pan/zoom.  Only the layers involved in the new map extents need to be refreshed.

Unfortunately, I don't have any experience with the new render caching and can't really upgrade at this point but it sounds cool.  I just wonder if that is re-inventing the wheel.

>From Qts docs, "it can visualize large scenes in real-time, even with millions of items".  It seems a shame to not use this since it seems to be designed almost specifically for gis.

From the licensing summary:
"ArcGIS Online has many services available at no cost to currently licensed 
ArcGIS customers (i.e., ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Explorer, ArcGIS Server and

Not one standard API seems to be supported. This means, that someone had to

He also built installation file for QGIS Korean version. Actually his efforts was supported by Korean Ministry of Land, Transportation & Maritime Affairs. 

The problem is that he don't know how to integrate his efforts with your development projects. Would anybody please let me know how he could contribute his efforts to your main development projects? Since I don't know much about development side, your help will be appreciated.

Anyway he's distributing his works through his download site as follows :

I suggest to fix this printing issue with symbology-ng and printing before
1.5 is released:

Dear Authors,

Due to removed qt3 support all plugin actions MUST send
a triggered() signal instead of the depreciated activated() one. 

Please update your plugins by renaming the catched signal.
There is the list of affected plugins I can find below.

Hi guys,
GdalTools is in the list but it's not affected..
Infact the deactivated() signal is an internal signal.

Cheers

 Oh joy...

 At what point release of Qt has the Qt3Support gone? It's still
listed in the 4.6 documentation. Or are you just saying 'Okay qgis
guys, time to grow up and be proper Qt 4.x programmers, ditch all the
Qt3 stuff now!'? Which is a good thing!

AFAIK the depreciated signal works on some platforms and at least on Mac 
doesn't. So it's sufficient reason for me :)

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] IMPORTANT NOTICE to all python plugin authors

Dear Authors,

Due to removed qt3 support all plugin actions MUST send
a triggered() signal instead of the depreciated activated() one. 

Please update your plugins by renaming the catched signal.
There is the list of affected plugins I can find below.

QuickSaveQml (can't access it's repository).

In RasterCalc there is a line with activated signal

rastercalc/rastercalcdialog.py:    QObject.connect( self.cmbPresets,
SIGNAL( "activated( QString )" ), self.insertPreset )

this is combobox signal and it must be skipped. Also I can't find file

rastercalc/rasterlang.py:    QObject.connect( self.action, SIGNAL(
"activated()" ), self.run )

maybe there is a mistake or superfluous file in your plugin dir.

Hi Boris,

Thanks for the notice.

Maybe this is worth a short blog entry on the qgis page? It would also be
important to fix wiki resources or sample plugins that people use to get
started with. I believe there is a plugin generators somewhere - from
Gary? This should be checked as well.

Thanks again and best greetings,
Andreas

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] IMPORTANT NOTICE to all python plugin authors

Dear Authors,

Due to removed qt3 support all plugin actions MUST send
a triggered() signal instead of the depreciated activated() one. 

Please update your plugins by renaming the catched signal.
There is the list of affected plugins I can find below.

Thanks Andreas!
There is no word about the depreciated signal in the Qt4's action 
documentation, so I believe we just need to remove it from any examples 
authors can follow.

The generator and the wiki are ok, the manuals will be updated.

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] IMPORTANT NOTICE to all python plugin authors

Dear Authors,

Due to removed qt3 support all plugin actions MUST send
a triggered() signal instead of the depreciated activated() one. 

Please update your plugins by renaming the catched signal.
There is the list of affected plugins I can find below.
For more details, see http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1743

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New by: compiling qgis on Windows XP
Message-ID: <4BBDA136.8040104@external.thalesgroup.com>

Hi,

I'm a newby in this mailing list, so, sorry if I ask for something that 
was laready discussed. In that case, please give me the paths to the 
posts I missed.

I'm trying to compile Qgis on Windows XP.
Since I can't use osgeo4w because of proxies of my company I have to 
download and compile everything by myself.

My dependancies are:

qgis 1.4 sources from qgis_1.4.0.tar.gz
GDal 1.7 (this is important for us)
Python 2.5
PostGreSQL 8.4
geos 3.2.0 (that I compile)
QT 4.6.2 LGPL (that I compile)
SIP 4.10.1 (that I compile)
PyQt4 4.7.2 GPL (that I compile)
libiconv 1.9.2
proj-4.7.0
gsl 1.13

Environment:
Windows XP Pro
Visual Studio 8 2005
CMake 2.8
bison 2.4.1
flex 2.5.4

I got qgis compiled in debug and release.
The debug version doesn't work for now but I didn't investigate it for 
the moment.
The release version starts and I can open rasters for examples.
But, it looks like a lot of tools or python dependencies are missing, 
for example, in the directory python there is only the directory 
plugins, no osgeo, no gdal.py and co., no logging, no OpenGL, etc.
So I'm asking myself what I forgot to do or download. Any ideas for me ?
Thanks a lot in advance,

Vincent

 Done, all my plugins should get 'triggered' now...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS svn packaged for Debian Stable and Debian
	Testing (Lenny and Squeeze)
Message-ID: <20100408095809.GA25045@rigacci.org>

For whom interested in the latest QGIS build, I packaged an SVN 
snapshot for Debian Lenny and Debian Squeeze, i386 and amd64 
architectures.

This is particuraly interesting for Lenny, where several packages 
were backported:

  * proj          4.7.0
  * geos          3.2.0
  * gdal          1.6.3
  * grass         6.4.0~rc6
  * libgdal-grass 1.6.3
  * qgis          1.5.0~svn20100406
  * mapserver     5.6.3

For Squeeze, only QGIS was packaged, because all the other 
packages are already in there, thanks to the Debian Mantainers!

The repository is apt-gettable here: http://debian.gfoss.it/

Please note that the repository was completely rebuild, so if you 
notice some problem report it to me. Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem in Connecting three different signals to
	the same event handler
Message-ID: <r2h78e951a61004080722h4c0bb22s3105b7810983017e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am struck with a problem while handling Signal and slot through pyqt

The problem is as follows:

I have three different menu items, each connected to the same event.
In side my event handling function , I want to find out which menu item was
clicked.

I tried self.sender().objectName(),

But I get the following error: ("TF is my class name")

*AttributeError: TF instance has no attribute 'sender'*

When I tried to inherit the QObject class in my class, the above error is
gone, but instead of getting the message "inside" it is not showing
anything. (Neither the error message nor the "inside" message).

The code is as follows:

QtCore.QObject.connect( self.Pch, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"),
self.CR_Clicked )
QtCore.QObject.connect( self.TFe, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"),
self.CR_Clicked )
QtCore.QObject.connect( self.IE, QtCore.SIGNAL("triggered()"),
self.CR_Clicked )

def CR_Clicked(self):
        eventName = self.sender().objectName()

        infoString = QString("inside")
        QMessageBox.information(self.iface.getMainWindow(),"SF",infoString)


It will be very kind of you if you can let me know as of where I am going
wrong, or direct me to any link.


With Warm Regards,
Bishwarup

+1

Otherwise, new developers will continue to create from the template using the deprecated signal.

Updating right now, after I remind myself how. A question that's been
bugging me for a while on pyqgis.org in the little form (which I assume
generates the xml description file) how do you set a plugin to
experimental. I had hoped I would have more time to make my plugin do
more (it still only has read capability) but realize that may not happen
anytime soon, so experimental flag might be a good idea to not mislead
people.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Chris

sorry for the lag, I'm too busy these days :-/

My idea is that the "V2" classes (which should replace the original
ones in qgis 2.0) shouldn't be regarded as a part of the stable 1.x
API. Such routines can be still a work in progress and not breaking
anything could limit the development. Of course, there should be
reasons for such breakage :)

Right, startRender() should take care of creating selected version of
the symbol. I was thinking that in order to keep things simple, the
symbol will always prepare itself to be able to draw also selected
version - the runtime and memory overhead will be probably very small
(one more cached image for markers) - but I have no strong opinion
about this.


> I'm not sure I follow your thinking about using the QgsSymbolV2RenderContext to pass a selected flag, as it looks to me as if this is only created within the QgsSymbolV2 startRender, stopRender, and renderFeature funtions, where the selected status isn't available.

Sorry I wasn't clear. I thought about creating instances of
QgsSymbolV2RenderContext already in the renderers and setting the
selected flag there (and QgsSymbolV2 would just add the output unit
and alpha). But that wouldn't be a nice approach either.


> I guess a boolean field in the QgsRenderContext could be used. ?In the startRender function it would be used that the the renderer/symbol/symbolLayer needed to have a selected version available, and in the renderFeature function it would mean that the feature to be rendered is selected.

QgsRenderContext is currently immutable during the rendering of a
layer: all information is set before rendering, then there's only read
access. It would be good to keep this semantics, that would be broken
if a flag would be changed prior to each renderFeature call. And
considering addition of parallelism (on the level of splitting a layer
into chunks) in future, the QgsRenderContext would have to be cloned
etc.


> Alternatively the selected flag could be added as a parameter to the startRender and renderFeature functions for the renderer, symbol, and symbol layer.

I like this approach currently at most. Only with the modification
that the symbol layer could receive this flag in
QgsSymbolV2RenderContext. Renderer and symbol would get an additional
"selected" parameter (with false as an implicit value). Renderer's
startRender doesn't need the flag because it gets pointer to the layer
and can find out whether there are any selected features. Finally,
symbol's startRender can receive the "layer has selected features"
flag and pass it to the symbol layer - but as I've written above,
maybe this isn't necessary and all symbol layers could fall back to
always prepare themselves for selected features.

I think I've covered this above...

I guess the border color should be kept, only the fill color should be
changed... but then there are symbols like + or X that have no fill...

Not sure how to do this? ?This should include an option for defining a selected version of the symbol (but maybe not yet implemented in GUI), and also some sort of default handling - perhaps creating a picture by rendering a larger background circle in the selected colour under the SVG image.

This is a bit tough. I'd avoid using a completely different svg symbol
for selected version. When doing raster output (i.e. not to
pdf/printer/svg) then we could colorize the image by directly
modifying the pixel colors. But I have no idea how to do that for pure
vector output. So we should probably stick with a circle around the
svg image as you suggest.

Makes sense.

I hope the answers were worth the waiting :-)

For me it worked like this:

settings.setValue('PythonPlugins/yourplugin', QVariant(True))

where you must replace "yourplugin" with the class name of your plugin
in lower case!

If I get accepted to SoC, this is one of the important things I'd like

Well, every time you zoom or pan, the map extents changes so there is
always a region that wasn't rendered previously (apart from zooming
in, but there could be scale-dependent rendering set up). So data
sources for all layers must be asked what features are in the new
extent so that the application can draw them.

I believe the reason for that statement is that they are using spatial
indexing (bsp tree) and caching. If we were going to represent each
feature by a graphics item, there would be new problems: all features
would have to be loaded into memory, if the symbology is modified, the
items might have to be repositioned (and reindexed) etc. Simply put,
the overall performance could suffer. Note that these are just my
hypotheses, I haven't actually tried it out.

Just to add, when the above code is run, it only stores in settings
that "yourplugin" should be loaded next time.

Development version (svn trunk, will be 1.5) has a better way to
directly load and start a plugin:

import qgis.utils
qgis.utils.loadPlugin("myplugin")
qgis.utils.startPlugin("myplugin")

The first call makes sure the plugin is loaded, the second one
actually starts it. There are few more methods for playing with
plugins, such as isPluginLoaded or unloadPlugin.

Thanks for the input Martin .. Worth waiting for as always.  Better that this sort of thing gets properly thought out than build a rushed implementation.  

I like the "hybrid" option for passing the selected status - ie passed as a parameter into the symbol but then stored and handled via the QgsSymbolV2RenderContext. 

Good point about symbols that don't have a fill.  Perhaps this can be handled when the cached symbols are created - if the selected and unselected version are identical then some sort of modification can be applied to the selected version...

Cheers
Chris

Hi all

i'm intersted to propone myself as student for the GSoc 2010 :-)

the idea is dedicated to develop a Tool for Ecological Toolbox, 
the aim of the project will be to provide geostatistical capabilities inside Qgis.    

This summer i'll go to the WHOI [1] institute in the USA to work as "guest student" 
At WHOI i'll work in a team that develops optical and acoustic tools for benthic habitat characterization. 
We will develop the capability for an image-based GIS database for temporal/spatial queries 
along with software for image processing, segmentation and classification of organisms 
and substrate composition from a rapidly growing library of images [2]. 

The data will be processed using and experimenting variouse interpolation tecnique like kriging 
and method to quantify the accuracy of the interpolation method.

[1] : http://www.whoi.edu/

[2] : http://habcam.whoi.edu

The main aim of the project will be to develop a tool in Python to perform data interpolation based on different kriging tecniques.
The tool will be based on a gui (as Qgis Python plug-in) to allow the user to choose between different kriging algorithms,
set parameters and input data to perform the calculation, adding the ability to store the results in a relational database (postgis) 
or also on more portable file-based data storage  as spatialite, shape-file and kml. 
The project will also have an accuracy evaluator to check the interpolation resutls and analize its error.

R seems to be a good choice but i?m also impressed by : HPGL (http://hpgl.sourceforge.net/)   
so the first step will be to evaluate and compare this two computational environment - choice will be done on speed and ability to handle huge dataset

This tool will be easily  integrated in Planet-Sasha (GSoC 2009), it will be released finally 
as a stable cross-platform tool (i can perform testing on Linux, MacOSX and Windows), 
to provide a fast and easy way to visualize data in a 3d gis-environment.

for further details and timeline i published the application on the GSoC site.

thanks to All, any comments is really welcome.

cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC 2010 , Ecological Toolbox
Message-ID: <E16AF6EA-422B-4958-9B82-91BF86DE65C1@yahoo.it>

Hi all

i'm intersted to propone myself as student for the GSoc 2010 :-)

the idea is dedicated to develop a Tool for Ecological Toolbox, 
the aim of the project will be to provide geostatistical capabilities inside Qgis.    

This summer i'll go to the WHOI [1] institute in the USA to work as "guest student" 
At WHOI i'll work in a team that develops optical and acoustic tools for benthic habitat characterization. 
We will develop the capability for an image-based GIS database for temporal/spatial queries 
along with software for image processing, segmentation and classification of organisms 
and substrate composition from a rapidly growing library of images [2]. 

The data will be processed using and experimenting variouse interpolation tecnique like kriging 
and method to quantify the accuracy of the interpolation method.

[1] : http://www.whoi.edu/

[2] : http://habcam.whoi.edu

The main aim of the project will be to develop a tool in Python to perform data interpolation based on different kriging tecniques.
The tool will be based on a gui (as Qgis Python plug-in) to allow the user to choose between different kriging algorithms,
set parameters and input data to perform the calculation, adding the ability to store the results in a relational database (postgis) 
or also on more portable file-based data storage  as spatialite, shape-file and kml. 
The project will also have an accuracy evaluator to check the interpolation resutls and analize its error.

R seems to be a good choice but i?m also impressed by : HPGL (http://hpgl.sourceforge.net/)   
so the first step will be to evaluate and compare this two computational environment - choice will be done on speed and ability to handle huge dataset

This tool will be easily  integrated in Planet-Sasha (GSoC 2009), it will be released finally 
as a stable cross-platform tool (i can perform testing on Linux, MacOSX and Windows), 
to provide a fast and easy way to visualize data in a 3d gis-environment.

for further details and timeline i published the application on the GSoC site.

thanks to All, any comments is really welcome.

cheers,

Massimo.

Great, Stefano, this seems a really interesting project. I will tighlty
follow it!
Will the log be mantained on the qgis wiky or on the SoC pages?

Hi,

it's a couple of days that I can't make to compile trunk code under
ubuntu 9.10/10.04

the error is here following, I'm missing something?

thanks in advance

I confirm building error on latest trunk on Debian  Lenny for few days.
My log looks similar to Giovanny's.

In the meantime, I tried with external spatialite, getting:

make[3]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib/libspatialite.so', needed by
`src/app/qgis'.  Stop.
make[3]: Leaving directory `/storage/build/qgis_unstable/debian/build'

Hi,

it seems that in qgis trunk (r13293) wfs support is broken.

The message is always

"The capabilities document could not be retrieved from the server"

regardless the wfs server being contacted.

Compiled OK on Debian Lenny i386.

But the WFS problem is still here ("The capabilities document 
could not be retrieved from the server").

Hi,

as a Qgis project i will be happy to use the Qgis infrastructure to document its development
uding qgis wiki as official public page about the project.

i'll also mantain a web site dedicated to the gsoc projects :
http://web.me.com/epiesasha/PlanetSasha/Py-Eco.html

thanks,

Massimo.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new geom function: combine cascaded
Message-ID: <u2k94b3c8441004111507ndc043b65ib64605aba26b0469@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devs,

I have recently added a new function to QgsGeometry which speeds
things up when combining (unioning) multiple geometries. It uses the
cascaded union function recently added to GEOS [1,2], and can provide
over 10 times speed-ups in many cases (my own tests [3] have shown a
14 times speed-up with even a relatively small polygon layer). Since
I'm not really a C++ developer, I haven't committed these changes yet.
Attached is a diff with the necessary changes. If some of you would
like to test and take a look at my code, it would be much appreciated.
As of now things compile and run nicely, but it's possible I've missed
something important.

Cheers,

Carson

anyone but advanced and involved users what the right thing to get is.

Suggestions:
Current version
Contains the latest features, but may not be bug-free. (If you're not
sure you probably want this version)

Long term support (LTS) version
Our long term support version with non-changing user interface and API.
(More common for corporate and organizational installs with software
restrictions or in-house custom development)

Drop Down to filter list based on Operating system so you're only
looking at options for the system you want to see. (There can be an all
option)

Anything older than the current 1.4, 1.0.2 should be in linked archive
or filtered out of the initial views. So maybe a version filter could
solve this with the defaults being current versions.

Simpler descriptions:
(Order Matters, Nightly build should not be the 1st on the list, ever)

Windows - Standalone : For novice users who need the basic GIS
functionality. More details(link to expand description, easy with js)

Windows - OSGeo4w : For intermediate/expert users who need additional
tools integrated, like GRASS and GDAL Tools. More details(link to expand
description) - For this type of install I think we need a wiki page
linked that walks people through the Advanced installer and explains
that "unstable" doesn't really mean it's going to crash all the time.

Nightly Trunk Builds : For Advanced users/Developers who want to
experiment with the latest features on a daily basis.


FYI: Formatting is messed up on
http://www.qgis.org/en/download/plugins.html
Besides that this page should say something like - QGIS contains several
tools to manage and download new plugin features. See ... for
instructions on downloading additional plugins (Or include how to use
python plugins directly on the page).

I'll be happy to help implement any of these.

Thanks,
Alex

I think there isn't a minimum SIP version you could assume.

I would wait with those changes until next qgis release (i.e. 1.6) to
give people some more time to upgrade. Windows and Mac installs should
be fine as SIP is bundled with them, but some linux distros might need
more time to catch up with newer versions of sip (>=4.9).

Hi all, and sorry for cross-posting,

the new version of the plugin contains a critical bugfix related to rpy2
dataframe handling - now all analyses are correctly performed. 
The odd bug about ade4 is very elusive and I'm presently unaware of a
pattern. All I can say now is that it doesn't happen on the tested
platforms.. [0]
Next TODO on the list is the multi-threading, as Python 2.6 is now on
Debian testing, my main development platform. 
Feedback is welcome!

All the best,
Anne Ghisla

Just some thoughts,

I think the best way to do things is to make it really easy for *new*
people to find the version they need immediately, and those who are
already using qgis, can click a link or two to get more specific or
more unstable versions. The table is extremely difficult to navigate
(I've just recently be told this by several of my colleagues), and
links to new pages would likely be easier to use. In my opinion,
current version should be right on the download page with links to
windows, linux, and mac right there. Then the LTS version should be a
separate page, with windows, linux, and mac. It would be relatively
easy to also have a 'quick' link which simply downloads the 'Current
Version' for whichever operating system the user is using to access
the page...

I don't if it's already available: is it possible to switch canvas
repainting to pause mode? This is a useful option available in various gis
systems, to allow setting symbology, moving layers, etc. without having the
canvas to be refreshed on every 'apply'.

I pushed for that idea the last time we did a major overhaul of the
pages. The problem we have right now though is that the main team
doesn't have a dedicated builder for a Windows Standalone with GRASS/
full python(including gdal-python) so we have to offer most people 2
windows downloads. Also Mac and linux installs are based on specific
versions and also have 2 options(of which frameworks is the preferred,
same way OSGeo4w usually works out better long run for Win). We don't
have universal single binaries so the autodetect business at most would
direct you to the right page but not actually start a download.

So following your idea I agree, put the buttons/link on the download
page and use them to filter the tables to 2-3 choices max maybe with a
drop down to toggle more options. Then simplify the info in the table
with a "more" link to the super details that only the super geeks
understand. On windows a Red link, saying you might also need a file
from Microsoft click to here to read, concerning the whole MSVC runtime.

Maybe that while make it easier, I can always find a few people to test
it on.

Thanks,
Alex

That's what the bottom right 'Render' checkbox is for.

But that's not on lenny.

AFAICS spatialite on is currently broken.  libspatialite-dev just contains a
dangling symlink to a shared library, which should be in libspatialite2.

Internal spatialite works here.

Hi Jurgen,

In my case, latest trunk (r13302) is failing now on Debian Lenny

Are there any stats regarding how many downloads there are of the LTS 
version vs. the current version? I'm just guessing, but I also think 
that putting the LTS version along with nightly "testing" builds  on a 
separate page would be a good way to simplify the page.

If you build for anything else but sid you need to add a debian/changelog entry
with the appropiate distribution.  Otherwise the sid dependencies kick in -
which is system spatialite - although that seems to be currently broken in sid
too.

I also get feedback from people that the pages are confusing. I post
my suggestions that might improve the usability (not limited to
downloads):

1. Main page
The text content is too dull to read it. People are in a hurry and
usually want to know a) what is qgis, b) how does it look like c) how
to get it.
Therefore I suggest:
- a short statement about QGIS in larger font + link: learn more
(leading to about QGIS page)
- big download button on the right side
- small screenshot below the download button + link: more screenshots
- below this there could be a news section (hackfests, releases, ...)

2. About page
I would suggest to merge it with "features" page and make the
screenshot smaller (again with link to more screenshots) because
otherwise it doesn't bring any news besides the short history.

3. Download page
For a good orientation, I would suggest to have these 4 options
(aligned in a 2x2 table, large font):
- Current version
- Long term support version
- Plugins
- Sample data
Each option would be a link to a separate page and could have a small
annotation text below the link.
Finally at the end of the page there could be a list of pages for
older releases.

4. Download page for any version
First a short introduction what the version is about (current release
/ LTS / older release).
No tables, just a section (ideally with a platform icon for easier orientation):
- WINDOWS
  - standalone - with/without grass
  - osgeo4w - instruction
- MAC - instructions
- LINUX - instructions for various distributions
- SOURCE


I believe this would make the first impression a bit better...

Regards
Martin

+1 from me for Martin's suggestions... very logical and neat. The
faster people can find what they need, the faster they can start
playing with QGIS, the faster they tell their friends about it!

Hi Carlos,

Have a look here for the list of people working on the various
translations of the manual:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Manual_Translation
Also, currently the only 'end-user' version of the manual is the PDF
version, however, there is currently work under way to provide an html
version as well. In terms of working on the manual translations,
information regarding this is available from here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Manual_Translation#Translating_the_english_documentation.
However, you're probably better off talking to the lead translator for
Portuguese first.

Regards,

Carson

Your class _must_ inherit from QObject (directly or by inheriting a
class derived from QObject) otherwise sender() method won't be
present.
When using the message box, it doesn't show up at all or it is
displayed but doesn't show any message?
Anyway, you can use some 'print' statements for debugging.

- I would prefer the combineCascaded to be a static function - it
makes more sense to pass all N geometries in the list, not N-1
geometries in the list and 1 geometry that triggers the operation.
- I believe the cascaded union has been added in geos 3.1, so we
should either make it conditional (and fall back to classical union
for geos 3.0) or rise the minimal geos version to 3.1.
- the typeId choice should be probably improved to check all input
geometries - if they're not of the same type, geometry collection will
be used

Anyway this looks like a good addition!

Hi all.
The googlelayer plugin seems broken, can anyone confirm?
===
The plugin seems to have been installed but I don't know where. Probably
the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.
Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find
the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It also
means that I won't be able to determine if this plugin is installed and
inform you about available updates. However the plugin may work. Please
contact the plugin author and submit this issue.
===
All the best.

Yes, I can, I've sent a mail to the author on Sunday, but without response 
yet. You can write too: yao@chu.url.com.tw

Btw. to all pyplugin authors: please remember to try the installation after 
each commit. I'm aware it can be boring, but it happens quite often that 
everybody but the author see a broken package, invalid metadata etc :-) And 
you wouldn't like to hear my grumbling everytime I'm looking for your address 
(needs some googling sometimes!) and sending an information ;-))

This post is directed to Anne, principally.
I've been pleased to see that an idea has been proposed for a SAGA GIS
toolbox. We've talked about it in some previous posts (some months ago), so
I would be interested in analyzing this proposal, having thought on it for
some time (python/C++ plugin, data wrappers, etc.).

Anne, what about opening a wiki page on this to share ideas?

Hi Giovanni!

good to hear interest on QGIS-SAGA integration. I started the wiki page:

http://www.qgis.org/qgis-wiki/index.php?title=SAGA_Toolbox_for_QGIS

contributions welcome! I hope to find time to follow it too.

Sorry Jurgen to bother, but I still cannot compile, even with internal splite. I keep
on getting

make[3]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib/libspatialite.so', needed by
`src/app/qgis'.  Stop.

This obviously depends on http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=577568
But I do not understand why I'm getting the same also  WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE
   ON
Any explanation?
Thanks a lot.

Then you are not building with internal spatialite.

Thanks, yes I always make entry to debian/changelog with  appropriate

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Evaluate the Spatial Query Plugin for 1.5
Message-ID: <4BC706BE.3040802@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I posted the source of Spatial Query Plugin in
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2634

More information about plugin see
http://n2.nabble.com/Spatial-Query-Plugin-td4643227.html#a4643227

I would like you guys to verify the code, and if it's in good shape, 
include it in the next version ( 1.5 )
of QGIS.

Thanks Tim for their suggestions.

Cheers,
Luiz Motta

Hi Paolo

do you get this all the time or in some specific cases? It looks like "d1" is zero which is the distance between two points. I can reproduce  it with a linestring layer but not with a polygon layer.

Message-ID: <k2ue12429641004161012x59381557rbce9bc4c842b7948@mail.gmail.com>

I have a problem while building a c++ plugin with msvc 9 (VS 2008) on
windows xp.

during linking I receive various errors referring to QMetaObject references
like

*public: static struct QMetaObject const QgisInterface::staticMetaObject"
(?staticMetaObject@QgisInterface@@2UQMetaObject@@B)*

I set the following lib folders
C:\Osgeo4w\apps\qgis_dev\lib
C:\Osgeo4w\lib

and the dipendencies (first trial was without the complete path for qt):
kernel32.lib
user32.lib
gdi32.lib
winspool.lib
shell32.lib
ole32.lib
oleaut32.lib
uuid.lib
comdlg32.lib
advapi32.lib
qgis_core.lib
qgis_gui.lib
geos_c_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\qtmain.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\QtXml4.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\QtCore4.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\QtGui4.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\QtNetwork4.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\QtSvg4.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\proj.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\geos_c_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\gdal_i.lib
C:\OSGeo4W\lib\iconv.lib


I don't understand what the linker needs to resolve that... I see that this
specific symbol is exported by qgis_gui.dll... and it's there.
The general configurations are the same as the one generated by cmake for
the other qgis dlls.

Has anybody faced this problem?
thanks,
giovanni

Somewhere I've read that this problem can be related to missing *.moc files.
The ones from the plugin I'm testing get compiled, but now I wonder if I'm
following the corect steps to link things together...

1 - I've set up a project for VS 2008, setting also the CORE_EXPORT and
GUI_EXPORT definitions.
2 - I've set the various include and lib folders and dependencies.
3 - it compiles everything, but link fails

I'm not expert with build systems, and I wonder wether this process is ok to
build a qgis plugin, or it's necessary to set the project inside the global
qgis build project to make it work. I thought that having the *.lib and the
headers from qgis would have been enough... Am I wrong?

I would appreciate your help. I'm right moving my first steps in the C++
environment...

thanks again,
Giovanni

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Integer instead of serial on gid column when using
	SPIT plugin to export shapefile
Message-ID: <l2o1ed604b81004170133vc6afb654w9fff177912ef77c7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
is there any good reason why SPIT plugin is assigning  'integer'  data
type to primary key column (gid) instead of 'serial' data type when
exporting shapefile to PostGIS?

Such created table is not usable for clients expecting auto increment
value on 'gid' column and it also differs from standard shp2pgsql
tool.
In QGIS both data types are working. If there is no serious reason for
'integer', is it possible to switch to 'serial' data type ?

hmm, right, well what do we think is the best way to go here? If we
fall back on a regular union, it could be 100s of times slower in some
cases!

ok, also a good point... done (hopefully my implementation is

It works for me on OS X. It will not halt an in-process render, to my knowledge. But it will stop all changes you make with layers, resizing, etc., until it is turned back on.

Hi all.
During a course I encountered a few problems on 1.4. I would appreciate
someone to confirm them, in order to open appropriate tickets (they may be
mostly inappropriate though, as they refer to external plugins).
===
DPSiplify: the resulting table is filled with NULLs, even if the field
names are correct.
GPS plugin: conversions are not possible (dropdown menu empty)
Split shapefiles: dropdown is better than radio buttons (for layers with 
many fields, buttons are really inconvenient)
Merge shapefiles: no options available on how to merge DBFs (the current
way is rather brutal)
Photo2Shape: GPS tags are not recognized for my photos (I can send a sample
if useful); opening the About throws an error: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/paolo/.qgis//python/plugins/photo2shape/photo2shape.py", line
124, in about
link.setOpenExternalLinks( True )
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'link' referenced before assignment
===
All the best.

Furthermore, the OnClick attribute tries to pen a wrong page when clicking

Hi Paolo,

Can you send me an sample photo with tags that are not recognized?
I'll try to fix this problem in Photo2Shape

Also I'll look at other GIS-Lab plugins and try to resolve issues

More issues:
* fTools
- Mean coordinates seems wrong when using a unique ID fields (Y coord much to North)
- Random points: min distance between points seems impossible to activate
- It should be possible to copy various results (e.g. from List unique values) to the
clipboard (or a file)

* OSM plugin
- downloaded layers should be given 4326 EPSG by default (otherwise they can get
wrong coord); same for GPX (ticket open)

All the best.

mmm, the 'version' is a leftover of a try to display the version name 
.... shouldn't have made it to the repo's..
Will fix this.

@devs: is there a way in python to get to the plugin-version as defined 
in __init__.py?

The OnClick attribute I have to think about what to do with that.

Thanks for reporting.

If I understand correctly, you need somethig like this

import sys
sys.path.append( <plugin_dir_name> )
from <plugin_dir_name>.__init__ import version

Message-ID: <91B41617-C8BC-4ECE-B5E0-139C1DEDED33@kyngchaos.com>

Kind of a bug/feature request for plugins in general, though it was brought to my attention for the GDAL tools plugin.

At least on OS X (maybe Windows?) applications (the GUI, bundle type, like Qgis) do not get anything from the shell environment, like the PATH.  For any use of external CLI programs, applications will fail to find them in the PATH as would happen when run from the Terminal.  There is one "official" way, but it's not well documented (if at all) or known, and is still clunky and un-Mac-like.

Plugins that use external programs, ie GDAL Tools using the GDAL programs, need a configuration option to set and save the path to those programs.

 So although a properly set PATH exists on both these platforms it
seems to not be passed through to applications that might want to make
use of it? Seems dumb to expect any application that is going to
launch executables to have to keep record of paths and rig up a dialog
to let the user change it... Operating Systems are supposed to sort
this out for us...

 Is this for executables launched via Qt (using maybe QProcess) and/or
things launched with the usual C++ or Python launch codes?

 Odd

This is the way OS X works.  Applications do not run from a shell, thus don't load any shell init files.

The environment still exists, and PATH and other items can be set and used by the application.  Non-OS-specific methods of starting programs from within an application should behave as expected, but when inheriting environment they'd be inheriting only what the app knows, unless you can tell it to init from a shell (I don't know all the exec's and popen's enough to know if this is possible).

Even if getting the shell environment is possible in some way for the application, or for processes started by the application, OS X (and Windows?) users generally don't want to muck around with editing .profiles (sure, us GIS folk are tech geeks, for now), but want a GUI to configure an option via a folder selection dialog.

Sorry, but I guess to don't understand. I talk about the red button with a
white X. The tooltip say: Stop map render, but, during the render the buttom
is unclickable.

Hi Luca,

You are correct about the stop render button. It is useless on OSX for whatever reason. If no bug exists, you should file one.

Sorry for the confusion,
John

Hi Python experts

I'm trying to connect to the signal QgisInterface::composerAdded( 
QgsComposerView* v ) with python. However, I only get a QGraphicsView object 
(so the parent class of composer view), not a QgsComposerView instance. Is 
there some sip magic that needs to be done? Or something else that I'm doing 
wrong?

My python code:

#connect to composerAdded signal from plugin
QObject.connect( self.iface,  SIGNAL("composerAdded( QgsComposerView* )"), 
self.onComposerAdded )

#and here the slot
def onComposerAdded(self,  composerview):
  print composerview

Marco

Indeed, some sip magic is needed: sip is informed about the subclasses
by using %ConvertToSubClassCode directive, see [1] for details. It has
been used within some PyQGIS classes and their derived classes, for
example QgsMapLayer, QgsMapTool, QgsMapCanvas and some others.

I think the best way how to discriminate between parent and derived
classes is by directly querying the instance which type it belongs to
(e.g. calling its type() or a similar function). If that is not
possible, dynamic_cast comes as a rescue, though it depends on RTTI
which may not be available and may cause some trouble.

It looks like the spatial query plugin is having problems finding geos on OS X:

Hopefully this is an easy fix, and possibly one that can be commented on in an email. It seems to crop up frequently.

And it needs to link the GEOS library.

My general comment would be, when adding plugins to make sure header paths and link libraries are explicitly included for extra libraries.  I think often developers on linux systems overlook that because libraries are included in default search paths and they don't get any errors. (sorry, no offense intended to linux folks)

Message-ID: <4BD28266.1070503@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm happily using the Value Tool plugin on a 686 machine (deb testing+qgis self
compiled). While installing the same plugin on an amd64 PC (deb unstable+qgis self
compiled) I get a Segmentation fault during installation, and qgis cannot be started
again:

$ qgis
Python support ENABLED :-)
Loaded : OpenStreetMap plugin (package: osm)
Loaded : MapServer Export (package: mapserver_export)
Segmentation fault

unless I rm the valuetool dir in the plugin dir.
Anyone has the same problem? Any hint?
All the best.

Hi Martin

Hm, but in my case this would mean to insert the %ConvertToSubClassCode 
directive into the sip file for QGraphicsView (that comes from PyQt). Is there 
a possibility to use  %ConvertToSubClassCode without changing PyQt?

Thanks,
Marco

This directive can be used either in the parent class or it can be in
the derived classes which were not previously known (as is the case of
QgsComposerView). I've added the code needed for correct conversion to
subclass in r13361.

changed into:

QGIS supports various capabilities for editing OGR, PostGIS and Spatialite
vector layers. Note - the procedure for editing GRASS layers is different -
see Section \ref{grass_digitising} for details.

it crashes on my Ubuntu too.
Seems that a check is missing, if an item was selected before the
user presses OK.
No filter value is required to reproduce it.
In fact it crashes just clicking OK without selecting an item.

Message-ID: <40904.193.246.86.39.1272285115.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

I am in the process of converting a Postgis/QGIS application into a
spatialite/QGIS in order to allow easier deployment for laptops without
the need to install Postgis.

So far I am very pleased. Performance is very good. Now I need to port a
QGIS-Plugin from Postgis to SpatiaLite but when I try "SELECT
load_extension('libspatialite-2.dll');" I get "no such function: load
extension"

I am on WindowsXP with a rather recent OSGeo4W installation from last
week. sqlite is on version 3.5.9 and qt is version 4.5.2.

So could it be that OSGeo4W distributes sqlite with load extensions
disallowed? see
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/spatialite-arch-2.3.1.html#trap - for a
discussion. If yes - could this be changed? If no - what else could I do
to enable spatialite in my QGIS plugin to work ok with QtSQL?

Thanks,
Andreas

Looks like Qt doesn't include loading sqlite extensions by default.

I found this: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=35074

Looks like I need to rebuild Qt again...

Hi list

I just tried to update my svn for qgis but I get the following:

$ svn up
U    mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
svn: In Verzeichnis ?mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj?
svn: Kann ?mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj/.svn/tmp/text-base/project.pbxproj.svn-base? nicht nach ?mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj/.svn/tmp/project.pbxproj.tmp.tmp? kopieren: Erfolg

The last one translates as: 

 svn: Couldnot copy ?mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj/.svn/tmp/text-base/project.pbxproj.svn-base? to ?mac/xcode/Qgis.xcodeproj/.svn/tmp/project.pbxproj.tmp.tmp?: Success

I tried to delete the whole directory  'mac' and updated then again, but still the same.

Any advice to get the things back to work would be great.

There isn't currently any way to do this from the UI.  But plugins can.

Hi J?rgen,

I keep getting the following message when trying to use this functionality:

Quantum GIS was unable to determine the type and srid of column  in

communication log was:

Any ideas why?

You still need to specify the key and a geometry column.  So it might be:

dbname='gis' host=localhost port=5432 user='cfarmer' password=xxxx key=id table="(select id,st_union from ireland_all_1)" (st_union) sql=

Message-ID: <4BD7132A.6090801@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I tested the loading of WFS layer using the option:
Only request features overlapping the current view extent
and I get:
The layer is not a valid layer and can not be added to the map
if the option is unchecked, the layer loads fine.
I tested:
http://webgis.regione.sardegna.it/geoserver/wfs?
With another WFS:
http://wms.pcn.minambiente.it/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms_ogc/wfs/aree_ramsar_wfs_f32.map
I do not get the error, a layer is loaded on the legend, but:
- the usual polygon icon is replaced by the photo icon
- no data is actually loaded.
Should I open a ticket?
All the best.

I forgot to say that there is an experimental plugin which help you to
do load a custom query, OpenGeo RT from the Faunalia Repository.

Hi,
I would like to improve qgis through developing. Is there a link on
specifications on how developers can improve qgis and contribute to open
souce qgis development? That is feature or bug fixing?

Try to run an svn clean at the top level of your checkout.
Deleting just that subfolder might not work because information about
that folder is stored in it's parent .svn too.

Hi all.
I have been giving several courses on QGIS recently, and I think we got to a point
where the current (dis) organization of plugins is no longer tenable. It is getting
very difficult to find the appropriate menu to start the plugin. the plugin bar is
often too big to fit into a 1280 screen.
Would it be feasible to add a tag <section> (or similar), with values: raster,
vector, web, general (more?) and make separate menus for the various sections? This
seems to me relatively easy, and not invasive. Plugin authors would not be forced to
use it, but all plugins without a tag could go in the "miscellaneous" menu, so
authors would find it advantageous to add the tag so their plugin will fit into the
right menu. I can help with the classification if necessary.
Thoughts?
All the best.

Great. I got stuck with the classification :) Classes as "raster", "vector", 
"web" can be insufficient. There still will be dozens of plugins in a few of 
them. I believe we also need a functional division: import, export, 
processing, statistics, display etc. What about a two-level classification: 
"raster/import", "raster/processing". I collected all plugins together, will 
update the list and post it here.

I have scheduled it for June. Will try to find a free Sunday earlier, but 
can't promise :/

What about using the same classification than the one shown in the grass toolbox ?

Hi Jude

new contributors are always very welcome! There are various resources
for developers scattered on qgis wiki [1] and qgis blog [2]. There are
various ways for contributing - if you're C++ developer, you can
develop new features or fix some bugs in QGIS. If you're a Python
developer, you could develop some plugins (or improve existing ones).
If you are not a programmer, there's still a lot of space for
contributing: translating QGIS user interface, documentation writing
or writing blog posts about the usage and development of QGIS.

Do you have any particular areas of intereset within QGIS? (e.g.
vector editing, map printing, raster support, 3D visualization)

Hi all,

Following the user meeting in Berne we are now doing a user survey. So far
we have 25 responses from the 80 participants.

We will share the complete results later.

Among the results people state that they find the plugins organization
partially confusing. They would expect many of the things that plugins
provide today "out of the box", within the core of QGIS.

Not only once there was a question in the audience - "can I do this and
that" and not only once the answer was "well, there is a plugin that can
do it ..."

Also, the plugin descriptions could often be more meaningful/complete.

I think for an upcoming version (1.6 or 2.0) one should consider
integrating some of the more popular plugins into the core, or delivering
them by default, like we did with fTools.

Andreas

 I'd like to see a user-centric design of the plugin menu, so that
users can arrange them as they like. I'd have a 'Frequently Used
Plugins' section myself, for stuff I use regularly, but I'd want to
keep everything somewhere so I can browse. Is there a nice Qt widget
that allows menu customisation by drag n drop?

 Ideally it wouldn't even be a menu, but some kind of keyword-based
interface with something like a tag cloud... But that's just some
wooly blue-sky thinking I haven't thought through yet...

I'd like to throw in my $0.02 worth. One of the attractions of QGIS 
compared to most other offerings (both proprietary and OSS) is its ease 
of use for experts as well as first timers. And all the fancier 
operations are accessible thru plugins.

I wouldn't want the core interface to be stuffed full of additional 
menus and buttons. But when activating a plugin I do expect the new 
functionality to appear as a new menu - just like it works now.  In 
other words, I'd prefer that most plugins do *not* become part of the 
core application.

On the other hand, +1 for categorizing plugins and splitting them into 
sub-menus.

This is a great idea. For each plugin we can set a main category for menu 
placement + a number of tags. In the next step we can make the gui 
customizable for users. As well menus and toolbars as a dockable toolboxes.
I don't know about user customizable menus, but at least we can enable user 
customizable toolbars.

So first I'll prepare a list of plugins, so we can see what we've got.

Micha,

I don't fully agree with you. I think at least one third of the plugins
should be moved into the core. Don't you think that a standard GIS should
offer:

* advanced labelling
* file format conversions
* geoprocessing
* raster operations (resampling, merging, reclassification, etc.)
* importing text files
* simple CAD functionality
* georeferencing
* dxf reading/conversion
* WFS support
* GPS support
* simple DEM calculations (aspect, slope, shading, curvature, etc.)

out of the box without having to search for a plugin at various
distributed resources?

I don't regard the above functionality as "obscure" or "rarely used". I
think they should belong to any GIS "out of the box" without having to
search for and enable plugins first hand.

I agree though, that some advanced analysis plugins, or specialized
environments, such as OSM, etc. could be handled by separate plugins.

Andreas

I noticed there was some work done in the past (GSOC) on labeling per feature for multipolygon features so that only a single label would be displayed. I thought that this was going to be merged into qgis 1.4 - why can't I find any reference to this functionality in any of the python API developer docs?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dealing with more sophisticated PostGIS table
	permissions
Message-ID: <hra6s8$ur0$1@osprey.mgras.de>

I'm trying to make use of the nice PostgreSQL feature which allows me
to grant different permissions on different columns of a table to the
user.

To be more precise, the table has a 'serial'-type "ogc_fid", a
'geometry'-type "wkb_geometry" plus a few more columns, of which a
'timestamp'-type column is filled via INSERT/UPDATE trigger.
SELECT/DELETE is granted to the user on the _entire_ record, but
INSERT/UPDATE is granted just on the "wkb_geometry" column.

Everything's fine as long as I'm filling the table via 'ogr2ogr'
("-append"), the geometries are getting in, the serial and the trigger
are filling their respective columns quite nicely. Thus I assume I've
set the grant's properly  :-)

Now, when trying to edit the layer in QGIS, we're permitted to move a
vertex of a polygon ....  Well, I didn't try to save the result to the
DB, but QGIS at least activates the note tool in edit mode - so I
simply believe it's going to work.

BUT we're not permitted to insert a new polygon (copied from a
different layer) via the paste feature, as long as the grant's are set
up as explained above. The paste item in the edit menu simply remains
greyed out and Ctrl-V doesn't insert anything.
The source layer of the planned copy-and-paste action is imported into
QGIS from a Shapefile, of which I've removed the .dbf-file, and thus
does _not_ contain any attributes which might conflict with the (write
protected columns in the) target PostGIS layer.

Granting INSERT/UPDATE on the entire record would serve as a
workaround, but contradicts my plan of preserving the non-geometry
columns agains unwanted edits.

Can anyone confirm ? Any chance to let QGIS focus on the geometry
column when retrieving table permissions from PostgreSQL while deciding
over the permitted actions ?

Best regards,
	Martin.

I agree with you that this (and other) functionality should be
available out of the box and requiring users to search for and enable
specific plugins for that functionality is not so user friendly.

Speaking for myself, I've planned to integrate advanced labeling into
core from day 1, I just don't want to do it until it has all features
and the old labeling code could be removed.

I think several plugins could be integrated into directly qgis
application. When thinking about integration of a plugin, the
following points should be considered:
1. language - if the plugin is in C++, the entry barrier is low and it
can be included easily. With python plugins, it's a bit different as
they should be rewritten into C++. However, I've started to play with
the idea that QGIS application could consist of mixture of C++ and
Python code, so the functionality that doesn't do heavy computation
could stay in Python. The advantages I see here is that potentially
new developers could start contributing to QGIS application and new
features/bugfixes could be done rapidly. I believe the plugin
installer from Borys and Carson's fTools are the obvious first
candidates for the mixed C++/Python approach.

2. consistency - a general problem with plugins is that their user
interface varies a lot since they're produced by various developers.
There is a number of plugins that do some kind of processing of data
and their needs are very similar - in a dialog, select input and
output layer(s), set few options and let it do the computation. The
plugin should ideally just provide a set of input values it needs and
GUI should be generated automatically in QGIS (as happens within
toolbox in grass plugin). Again, fTools is a good candidate for using
such unified dialogs for processing tools.

3. dependencies - some plugins have some special dependencies -
processing, plotting or other libraries. What do to with them?

4. maintenance - ideally, all functionality should have a maintainer
willing to fix the issues.

I'd like to see one coherent subsystem for opening (and saving) data - no 
matter if they are files, databases, web services or gps devices. 

No we have the main "Add vector layer" window with various sources unusable or 
with limited functionality (CSV, GRASS, PostGis) + separate plugins providing 
the same data source with full functionality. Also we have a big mess with 
SQLite/SpatiaLite: spatialite layer creation in core, spatialite layer adding 
in plugin, OGR's sqlite layer adding and saving in core. Do we really need the 
two sqlite formats?

So even if some providers would be pluggable, they should integrate with other 
providers, and not sink in the plugin menu.

Maybe it's an answer for the old question: should we rather keep all plugins 
in their menu, or deploy them into all existing menus. What about keeping 
providers all together and separately other plugins all together.

Greetings,

During the last year, I gave twice a 60 hours introductory course in
GIS where Quantum GIS was the primary Desktop user interface used.

I agree with Micha that minimal interface at the first start up is a
very, very important quality of QGis UI. It allows progressive
integration of functionalities. I believe it is easier to add
functionalities over a strong foundation then trying to hide
unnecessary tools for a specific use case.

If plugins organization is effective, there is not very much pain to
add plugins and navigate through them. A lot of plugins provide very
interesting features and it is important to make them easily
available. I'm not sure that putting many of them in the default menus
will deserve this very well. Power users can add plugins, newbies are
afraid by complex menus.

Maybe cloud tags as suggested by Barry could be interesting. Multiple
keywords seems to be a must as it is the base to allow multiple views
of the plugins organization.

I don't want to go to far away from the original topic, but I believe
that documentation must be a major concern for good availability and
usability of plugins. If we can find easily which plugins are
available, what are their detailed functionalities, how to use them
and how to find them, we make important points. Once it is done (or in
parallel), interaction design may be use to improve usability and
accessibility of plugins.

It's just my 2?. Thank you for your really good work!

Hi,

that is true, but as of now, this feature is available only within the
Labeling plugin which can do more advanced label placement. In future
it will be integrated into QGIS core.

I wonder if somebody removes bug >jumping legend item<? Is it possible to
know, when qGIS 1.5 final wil be ready?

 

Best regard, Joze

I realised that actionMoveVertex was replaced by actionNodeTool.
Unfortunatley this action has not been added to the python plugin
interface.

I opened a bug for it with the neccessary patch.
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2686

Please consider applying.

Thanks,
Chris
