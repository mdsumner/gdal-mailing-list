I think a beta release is a good compromise. A "final" release plenty of bugs
would be
the worst service that could be done to QGIS, as QGIS would be regarded by
users as an experimental toy for developers.
This question should be raised in the users list as well.

I'm clipping an srtm90 raster using a rectangular window and the
result is wrong:
1. Wrong window
2. The result has an additional layer with constant 255 value

I've put the input raster, input vector and output raster here:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/srtm_37_04.zip
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/FlxPyrAOI1.zip
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/srtm3704FP2.zip

Please give it a look before I actually fill a bug report.

Surprisingly, the srtm90 tile to the W gets clipped right with the
same vector (except that
the constant 255 band is also present).

Thanks

I think we should either remove the "Must Fix for Release" tag, or take it seriously.
I am downgrading some of these tickets.
We all know a bugfree program is something that exists only in the mind of some
marketer, but if we have blocking issues, they have to be blocking.
Another approach would be to release snapshots when we feel we're ready, not
pretending them to be "stable" versions. Many users just take us literally, and for
them a "stable" version with tens of "blocking" issues does not speak well for the
project.

This has been requested and raised a few times, but no developer appear to have time
for this (quite understandably - a boring job).
All the best.

Well, do we have a rule what should be a blocker?  AFAICS the tag is used
inflationary.  I think only issues that have a severe impact on QGIS as a whole
or frequently used parts should have it.

Then lets hope the don't read this list.   I suppose most of them won't hit any
of those issues.   And some protesters probably didn't look at the "blocking"
issues either.

+1. We even had enhancement requests that were marked as blockers. I removed
a number of those tags yesterday.

As an user/adopter/envangelist I agree very much with Markus. And the suggestion from Alex is very to the point. This is not the first time (or last) open source devs face this challenge... I remember why I abandoned gvSIG... too many bugs while pursuing more and more novel features. I could make a 3D view, but couldn't edit a bigger shapefile... and releases were so far apart bugs were almost perennial.

Having too few resources to handle all open bugs/new features must be thought through... the list of bugs with a request for donations is a very good idea IMVHO. Also, having a budget estimation for each one can also encourage people to donate. Also, there was an OSGeo quiz about future efforts/directions, and support to projects was one of those concerns. Maybe there is a model somewhere to support this kind of growing up hardships...

I'm a "corporate user" and it's not easy to authorize an expense (consider also I'm in Portugal). There are mind frames, and cultural difficulties (besides lack of money)... I first need to establish QGIS in the enterprise, and later on propose spending money... not the other way around.

I think it's fine to release it as is but do think we should call it
Beta, Testing or something similar. We should also consider a doing bug
fix only release (no new features), not a backport of fixes either and
try to steer developers towards that goal for the next couple of months.
This bug fix release could be the last release of the 1.x series if it's
really stable.

In the future maybe once every X (2-3, or .5-1 a year) releases we could
do a bug fix/bug hunt release where we just take time to clean up. If
it's just a couple of months of bug hunting with very little other
changes it should be easy to roll the release more quickly than usual.

Just some ideas...

Thanks,
Alex

Good point - a classic catch-22 situation. Anyway, there are already larger
institutions using QGIS, they just invest globally very little to nothing in crucial
issues like quality control, autotesting, bugfixing.
I encourage everybody in this situation to find one or more additional devs to deal
with these issues.
All the best.

Reading the discussion, I'm  more and more convinced, that we should release 
the 1.7-beta ASAP and then focus on bugfixing the 1.7.x line. 

We have many exciting features pending for the 2.0, so let's develop it in the 
meantime, apply patches from 1.7 and allow interested users to install it, but 
don't hurry to release it in September. I don't mean to stop the 2.0, just 
anybody who is happy to support 1.7 as well as 2.0, please consider to focus 
on the former. Nothing wrong will happen, if we release the 2.0 even in 
September 2012.

Paolo, that's very true. And something I feel is related to the problem of mind frames and cultural settings... It has to change somehow... one thing we are missing is the ability to sell QGIS in this manner. And I mean sell in the most commercial aspect. Having a commercial work force, not for licenses but for bugs, quality and overall long term sustainability. Now there's a challenge...

If QGIS would send a letter to known users to raise funds would this be a good/bad/so-so perspective? Or an annual fundraising appeal very much like what Wikipedia does (http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/WMFJA085/en)? Both?

Well, this is solved! (connecting to ArcSDE)

You have to include the VERSION name in the connection definition, even if it is the default, and also the table name.

So if you create a vrt like this:


It just loads perfectly in QGIS:
<OGRVRTDataSource>
   <OGRVRTLayer name="layer name in qgis">
       <SrcDataSource>SDE:servername,5151,,user,pwd,SCHEMA.TABLENAME,SDE.DEFAULT</SrcDataSource>
       <SrcLayer>SCHEMA.TABLENAME</SrcLayer>
       <GeometryType>wkbMultiPolygon</GeometryType>
       <LayerSRS>+proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66666666666666 +lon_0=-8.131906111111112 +k=1 +x_0=200180.598 +y_0=299913.01 +ellps=intl +units=m +towgs84=-223.237,110.193,36.649 +no_defs</LayerSRS>
   </OGRVRTLayer>
 </OGRVRTDataSource>

It works! See: http://bit.ly/l20tAp.

I have added this info to the wiki: User Corner, Hints and Tips:

Hi All


Nothing causes more debate than the whole release / don't release
topic. Maybe its good to lay out the plans for the medium term future:

- Release 1.7 as the last general point release in the 1.x series
- Make subsequent 1.7.x bug fixes while we work on 2.0
- Precede 2.0 with 1.9.x preview releases (which will not be publicised widely)
- Release 2.0  - our optimistic hope was for a September release but
(apologies to Gary) I suspect we will miss that target and year end
will be more likely.

@Markus I am going to try to maintain the 1.7 branch with bugfixes so
that we can release 1.7.1 etc

>From my usage, 1.7 is more stable and usable than 1.6. Almost all
software I know of ships with bugs and even crashes. Even gnome 3.0
which I love dies on me now and again. Of course we want to release
stable software, but we also want to put improvements out there
regularly so that others can benefit from ongoing improvements and new
features. I agree with Marco, Juergen and others - lets go on and
release so that we can focus our energies on 2.0.

Ubuntu and Debian both have active arm support/development. There also
appears to be a linux-arm mailing list. I would suggest looking into if
their methods might help for just getting stuff onto arm.

The following seems to provide the basics of getting a C/C++ app
compiled for android using an a pre-made toolchain.
http://android-tricks.blogspot.com/2009/02/hello-world-c-program-on-using-android.html

FYI, I just finished up a class on Android development and while we
stuck to making java apps I'm happy to help provide additional guidance
on the approach to device development (Did PDA stuff a few year back too).

Thanks,
Alex

Not for long. Wait until Meego tablets and phones. For sure end of the
year. Acer M500 tablet already showing the phototype of Meego in
Engadget.

Javascript in QT5 and QML is coming for Meego tablet. Right now, I am
developing JQuery, Xcode, Openlayers in ipad 2 next Android, Meego and
Window Phone Mango.

That I was talking about in my earlier post, when mobile discussion
started. It make a sense to port some good libraries, but GUI must be
completely different.
When starting any mobile project, one should ask a question, which
kind of libraries is need. First, one should look for some more native
libraries (Java in case of Android) and in case they are not suitable,
think about porting some foreign libs.

The question is, what kind of features we need in our mobile app ? Do
we need something which does not exists for example in Nutiteq Map
libs [1]?

Thanks for reporting. We've got the provider working on the machines now
to resolve the issues. I'll post again when it's back up. Hopefully
we'll find the cause of the issue (this is the 2nd time this week).

Hi All

Ok I will do the call for packaging this weekend. I would like to take
one more try at the redmine migration on friday night. I successfully
did it on my desktop pc today so I think it will work ok on the server
- I just need to get a fresh dump from Chris Schmidt tomorrow.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <5A44BB20-CB7D-4761-9628-114CD3DE7C1B@kyngchaos.com>

I've been working on some build stuff for OS X which includes general changes and cleanup in the cmake configuration.  So far it's OK on OS X, and I compiled on Ubuntu with no problems, though not with all optional dependencies and some older ones.  It's in my master fork on github and I'd like others to check it out to make sure I didn't mess up anything:

http://github.com/kyngchaos/Quantum-GIS

Mainly I found that a lot of general build options do not need conditionalizing for platforms.  Like a different install root and organization for Mac, *nix, and windows apps.  And platform-specific target properties.  There is also a handy automatic header install feature.

If there are no problems, I'll merge it into the qgis master, though it may be a bit much for the 1.7 release.

Agreed on both counts,

As someone that has worked extensively in the field with various Trimble,
Leica, ArcPad interfaces and versions, along with some latest GIS apps for
iPhone.

If there is a Push to get QGIS ported to Mobile, it has the chance (in these
early stages) to eclipse any of the offerings I have seen, used, or disposed
of.

1. Developer or User - Decide whether QGIS Mobile will be built for
developers or for end users.
                                 Dev's can handle quirks with the following
3 and 4, Users can and will not.

2. Tablet And/Or Phone - Each platform has their strengths and weakness.
 Developing for Both demands very thoughtful User Interface, or flexibility
to change to its new platform.

3. Stability - Stability is the hammer for the nail, without it, it can
cause more harm than good.

4. Usability - Find one, two or even three things desired for QGIS Mobile
and do it very very very well.

I would love to see a mobile version of a GIS app that could fill the void
that exists today. Leica and Trimble make good data collection units that
are both very expensive but very stable.  ArcPad is dangerous in my opinion
given it's horrendous stability issues.  Some of the GIS apps for iPhone
show promise but in their desire to add more features, some of their core
features have suffered with bugs, and app crashes. Added Features are great
when they work and do not pull down the original stable release, unless of
course as a developer and tinkerer stability does not matter as much.

Love to hear how QGIS Mobile evolves!

Mars

Ah, the bits in the code that I haven't gotten to yet in my framework-ization - this is looking for the library still.  Maybe those I should leave qgispython as a library, since it's not public.

But, shouldn't affect other platforms...

Indeed, I had to change qgispython back to a library - the runtime loading uses QLibrary, which looks for a dylib and would need an explicit path to find a framework, too much hassle.

Would you mind adding a page to the qgis wiki about "what should qgis mobile do?", so
we could jointly list reasonable use cases?
Thanks.

It should be the work of GIS developer Tibor Arpas from Slovakia. I know
him little from mailinglists and also from local business, since we are
from the same country.
I will add him to Cc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Plugin - Ovals
Message-ID: <005301cc21d3$1d6eabb0$584c0310$@co.uk>

Dear QGIS Developers,

 

I have long hoped for a plugin to create ovals based on a point layer. It
would ideally have the ability to select orientation in degrees, width and
length (with values contained in fields also available).

 

I notice that Pavol Kapusta created an excellent plugin called 'Rectangles'
in the contributed repo to do exactly what it describes, but has anyone
tried ovals?

 

I am not a python developer myself, so I am not used to the language.
However, if anyone is able to come up with a 'simple' (dare I say it)
plugin, or has created one before and it has not yet reached a repo, I would
be very grateful to hear from you.

 

Many thanks,

 

Rob

Hi Giovanni,

Thank you for your response.

Yes I have indeed thought about going down the line of sponsorship or sites like 'getafreelancer.com', but I use this for local community based projects, and therefore we hardly have much money as it is.

I guess if I had the money I would be on ArcGIS as this probably has a tool to do the job along with increased functionality, but unfortunately this is not the case. Besides, I get on well with QGIS and would prefer to stick with it.

I appreciate everyone has to work for a living and not all developers want to just give away their life's work for free, but if anyone has looked into this before as a test project, or part of another project, then I would be grateful to hear from them.

If funding were to be available for any development work, are there any systems in place to manage it, such as GAF, as referred to above?

Cheers,

Rob

with one difference:

Arc* costs you thousands/year, while qgis costs you nothing and the
development of the tool you need will costs you probably around just a
few hundred euros. ;) and at the same time you contribute to make qgis a
better software.


> Besides, I get on well with QGIS and would prefer to stick with it.


good!

I guess you can use this initiative also to ask develop something
missing.

In Martin's excellent python cookbook there is a part about the
appearance symbology of vector layers and how to do this in python:

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#appearance-symbology-of-vector-layers

The part of 'FooSymbolLayer' is an example for a red oval symbol. It's
not what you want, but it is a start for a developer.

Attached is the example from the cookbook, a little changed (apperently
the constructor for the Metadata has changed) always drawing a red oval
with a height which is two times the width.

To use it (only usable with New Symbology! tested in trunk here) is:
- put it in your python path somewhere (eg in your .qgis/python/plugins
directory)
- after starting qgis, open het python console and do (given the file is
still called foosymbol.py):
    from foosymbol import *
- now if you open your point layer in new symbology, clicking on the
'Change...' button below the
- symbol preview you will find a new 'symbol layer type': FooMarker
- this will draw a red elipse with a height of two times the width

Anyway: you will need a (I think pretty experienced) python programmer
to make it work exactly the way you want it.
Hopefully there is somebody with some free time...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all, this week i leaped more into the cross compile realm. Geos almost
done and started with proj4. I updated my necessitas infrastructure to
necessitas v 0.2 and we decide to target android 3.0 which is optimized for
tablets. I havent updated the wiki yet since i've been (and still am) mainly
offline at the moment.
On the dev list of Qgis tere have been interesting discussions about the
needs of qgis mobile. Pity they started only now. Next week I ll continue
crosscompiling and resume the list discussion on the wiki.
Ciao Marco

Hi yes thanks,
spatialite is not one of the core libs needed for qgis to run so i havent

I haven't looked at the Rectangles plugin (yet) but if it does 99% of
the work and you just need to change the formula to make ovals instead
that could be a project that only take a few hours.

Thanks for putting up the suggestion, maybe someone will get to it, but
as Paolo said if you really want to make sure a couple of hundred Euros
would probably be all it takes.

Thanks,
Alex

I have published a plugin called vectorfieldrenderer which plots arrows with orientation and scale based field values.  I wrote this for plotting deformation (eg ground moment as a result of an earthquake).  I've been thinking about adding ellipses to it for a while (to represent the measurement errors of the deformation) - and will probably be doing this in the next month or so.  However that may not be quite what you want (either the feature or the time frame!).  One feature of the plugin is that there is a toolbar to allow the user to rescale the arrows, something that is very useful when looking at deformation.

Pity I haven't put the ellipses in already!
 
Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Plugin - Ovals

Dear QGIS Developers,

I have long hoped for a plugin to create ovals based on a point layer. It would ideally have the ability to select orientation in degrees, width and length (with values contained in fields also available).

I notice that Pavol Kapusta created an excellent plugin called ?Rectangles? in the contributed repo to do exactly what it describes, but has anyone tried ovals?

I am not a python developer myself, so I am not used to the language. However, if anyone is able to come up with a ?simple? (dare I say it) plugin, or has created one before and it has not yet reached a repo, I would be very grateful to hear from you.

Many thanks,

Rob

Well not a total loss, the libraries you are working on compiling for
mobile devices need to be done no matter what.

I think the big question mark later will be what GUI get's put in front
of the libraries to provide an interface for users. But you'll need to
get the qgis core compiled on something like Android before that really
becomes an issue.

Qt if possible sounds good, but I can see how QT QML might be a better
choice and more likely to be transferable cross mobile platform.

In terms of focus on platforms, Ubuntu has already shown it can be
compiled for android tablets (Not much need to get QGIS on that once its
working good), Meego is still a ways off from the gates, Qt on iOS also
seems a bit behind too.
http://code.google.com/p/android-lighthouse/wiki/Compile

FYI, GPL code can't be put in the Apple App Store, ToS is incompatible
with the GPL.

I guess what I'm getting at is I think you should focus on Android for
now, and see how far you can get compiling all the required libs. Then
compare QT vs QT QML for implementing an interface.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi All, 

How can I stop extent modification when I resize qgis windows? I mean, I
focus on a given zoom (map extent) with qgis maximized and for some reason I
need to restore window and reduce size to see any other application back.
But Qgis modifies the view so I lost perspective. I don't care if I can't
see the hole map if I still can see the same area with same zoom.

Any help?

Hi William

I tested on ubuntu natty 64 bit and all seemed to build fine. I tested
both checking out your master branch and then building in my existing
build-master build dir (worked fine), and by creating a new build dir
and building everything from scratch and with all options enabled. All
seems to work fine. I can test on windows next week when I get back to
the office with my vmware setup if you like.

RE release branch, yeah its probaby a little last minute to add it there.

Good to verify - I dip into ubuntu (linux in general) only occassionally, with vbox on my Mac.  I'm on 10.10 right now, I tried to upgrade to 11.4 (natty?) but it rendered the system unbootable.

Yes, windows certainly needs checking.  Mac and windows are the ones that have platform-specific options that are supposed to be ignored on other platforms.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problems with RGB rasters under Windows
Message-ID: <1307185168.6152.18.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

a few users reported to me saying that they were having problems with
rasters under Windows (long time to open rasters, resulting image with
"funny" colors) so I started a few tests.

After a *lot* of tests, removing and re-installing form scratch both
qgis (osgeo4w and standalone, the latter created with creatensis.pl) and
Windows (XP and Seven, both 32 and 64 bit) on different machines, I can
confirm this issue:

On qgis-trunk (but probably also under 1.7) it takes a lot of time to
open RGB rasters (single band rasters are not affected), even small
TIFFs of 30mb. Then the resulting image renders with "wrong" colors.
After the raster is added to the canvas, zooming and panning the map
seems normal.

QGIS 1.6 is not affected as it isn't qgis-trunk under Linux.

I'll open a ticket about this issue with a couple of screenshots just to
show what I mean with "wrong" colors.

Odd enough, I have also a XP machine (I haven't reinstalled de OS on
this one) that already had qgis-trunk osgeo4w installed and doesn't show
the above issue and that is not replicable even removing and
re-installing qgis from scratch.

Anyone else is seeing this?


Cheers

Hello,

This week, I coded a GUI list of modules, sorted by tag (which in the
case of SAGA are determined programmatically), plus the basics of a
'run module' dialog. I have started working on the parameter passing
aspect of the framework.
I also set out to handle class generation for the GUI & installation
of python files from cmake. Being inexperienced in cmake, this wil
require further study & work.

Next week I intend to (as per the timeline), add GUI elements for the
simplest cases of parameters and get the build system working.

A screenshot, links & prior reports are available through [2]

Hello,

I am on my wife's computer (Snow Leopard) and am trying to remember if I
need to build Qt libraries as a static or dynamic library?

I seem to remember dynamic is preferred for dependancies but also seem to
remember that the auto-download/build installer for Qt for Mac builds the
libraries as static?

What is the smoothest download for Qt (and debugging) that I should be using
for Mac?

Thanks!

Don't compile Qt from source, just download the framework installer.  They also have debug libs as a separate download (it adds to the frameworks).  For most purposes the "Qt Libraries" downloads are enough, but if you need the dev tools, like Qt Designer and the Qt IDE you need the larger Qt SDK.

Looks like they changed their download page layout a bit - the SDK/Library section used to be side by side, now they're sequential and you need to scroll down to find the Library links.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bugs, release of 1.7 and release of 1.7 as beta
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=4j=PsTBLmyk0YWCYdgpECFWBLAg@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to bring up to the users list the thread on the release of
1.7 that was raised by Paolo in the developers list:
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/release-of-1-7-td6421690.html

I take the liberty of including here the two most relevant messages
(in my opinion):

Paolo Cavallini:
"Hi all.
Am I the only one to feel uncomfortable releasing 1.7 with 60 bugs
classified as blocking?
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/report/16
IMVHO we should examine them, and either reclassify them or solve them
before release. My feeling is that 1.7 at this stage has significantly more
issues than most previous versions, and could be disappointing for many of
our users.
I hope to be wrong, of course.
All the best.
"
Nathan Woodrow:
"I think releasing as a beta would be a good idea, that way we get 1.7
release out but users know it's not fully done.  This way it also
gives us more time to do bug fixing."

In my opinion, I think a beta release is a good compromise. A "final"
release plenty of bugs would be the worst service that could be done
to QGIS, as QGIS would be regarded by users as an experimental toy for
developers.
The worst scenario is a user thinking that a project can be performed
with QGIS  and then finding out that there are several important bugs
across the processing
chain. This leaves to frustration first and to loss of confidence soon
afterwards. A
totally different situation is that the user knows that he is using a
beta, with a clearly stated "known bugs" list. The same
product would raise admiration and expectation instead of frustration.

Message-ID: <1307216607791-6440007.post@n2.nabble.com>

hi,

QGIS 1.8 is still not able to acces postgresql databases with long (int*8)
primary keys.

In Openstreetmap, those tables have bigint/ int*8 primary keys.

At this time (4. june 2011) the bigges values are 1.311.718.773 for "nodes"
, 116.332.121 for "ways" and 1.611.666 for "relations", which are the
base-tables in that db.
Those tables don't have OIDs - they could be added by me but it won't help,
because the primary key of "nodes" will be bigger than 2G during this Year.

any ideas?

somebody posted, that this should be fixed in release 0.9 - 5 years ago :(

i found that ticket: https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/62 but that seems to
be still open.

Hi All

Please note that the http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ Trac instance has
been set to read only for now while we test migration of tickets to
redmine. This change will be made permanent if all is successful with
the migration. We wil post further updates over the course of the
weekend.

Note: Administrators can still make changes to trac but please hold
off from using it for now.

Thanks for your patience.

It's all in the INSTALL document in the QGIS source.

Looking good.  My hope onces this is all done is to be able to rewrite all
the tools in fTools  to use the framework. That way eventually everything
can be linked together and called in the same way.

i can't do that. i'm not a developer. 
but i'm not the only guy who needs that feature. 
there are a lot of openstreetmap-databases in the world and all of them
can't be used by qgis.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=y4asG1wHAju=8NcLvVwr_x_rR-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

The bulk of the migration has been carried out. The new tracker is
available at[1]. There are still quite a number of outstanding issues.
If you are logging in for the first time, I encourage you to first
peruse our redmine project ticket queue[2] to familiarise yourself
with known issues.  The trac project remains in a read only state, and
unless testing over the next day or so reveals a critical issue with
the redmine deployment, we will ask for automatic redirection of users
from the old trac site to the new redmine site. I have also
reorganised the projects a little more logically and made other
general cleanups to the redmine instance. If you do encounter issues,
please file at ticket in the redmine specific project [2] linked
below.


[1] http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis
[2] http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-redmine/issues

Once this is out of the way we will forge on with the QGIS 1.7 release!

Regards

Oops, looks like I can't.

I was confused by the fact that someone asked you to sponsor,
not develop, the functionality.

Hi,
I suggest you try osm2postgresql, which converts bigint into int4 to be
compatible with QGIS and works fine so far.

To simplify rendering with QGIS, the osm2postgresql script sets up a
PostgreSQL database, imports OSM data into it and process those data
(including multi-polygons with holes).

However, I've seen on the OSM dev list that some threshold for the
number of nodes will be reached soon and this might become an issue; if
so, I will adapt the script to have a primary key as only nodes with
tags are needed for rendering (in the structure created
byosm2postgresql, there is a table called nodes_with_tags, aimed at
this). 

See:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2postgresql

Hope this helps,
Mayeul

Thank's Mayeulk,

but that won't solve my problems :(

I'm using the osmosis  "Snapshot"-Schema und do my updates via the minutely
diff-files using osmosis too. That schema is fixed to int*8. 
The other often used database (fed by osm2pgsql) is still int*4 but they
must change soon to int*8.


However, I've seen on the OSM dev list that some threshold for the
> number of nodes will be reached soon and this might become an issue;
the threshhold will be exceeded this year when the node-id reaches the
32bit-limit of 2g - at the moment the highest key is about 1.400.000.00
(not the number of records - osm is never using an old key again)


if so, I will adapt the script to have a primary key as only nodes with
> tags are needed for rendering (in the structure created

that will not help, because many of us need ALL nodes - with and without
tags- because we don't render at all but do other stuff with the data
(routing, analysis,  navigation, Location-Finder like Nominatim (*),
POI-Finder on Mobiles, .... everything but rendering) 

To be honest: 
i'm not looking for a workaround to do some stuff using QGIS. I would like
QGIS to work with ANY data from ANY source with int*8-Keys.

Regards
walter

btw:  "Nominatim has run out of integers and the database is being updated
to use bigint. While this is processing there will be no updates. With the
software changes needed to support this the ETA for completing this work is
13th of June. Apart from updates the service will operate as normal. --
Twain 13:24, 3 June 2011 (BST)"

same Problem at all.

Yes of course William, a very incredibly helpful resource.

I likely am unable to follow instructions correctly, as I am finding (and
remember in my case) there were (are) special steps that I need to take to
build all the pre-req's... Have you ever tried building with two kids
hanging off your arms ^_^ ha ha!

There maybe something I am doing that is causing all our Intel Core 2 Duo's
to cause troubles with QGIS.

for instance:

ld: file not found: QtSvg.framework/Versions/4/QtSvg for architecture x86_64

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

make[1]: *** [plugins/designer/libqwt_designer_plugin.dylib] Error 1

make: *** [sub-designer-make_default] Error 2


Are these errors normal when making of QWT?

QtSvg for 64bit is missing, so this would suggest that I may have downloaded
the wrong Qt libraries for SnowLeopard?

Perhaps there is no 64bit QtSvg available?

 I downloaded the:
Cocoa: Mac binary package for Mac OS X 10.5 - 10.6 (32-bit and 64-bit)
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x

Thanks for the help, these issues so incredibly trivial for you I
understand.

Mars

Qt Cocoa should have 64bit for all the Qt frameworks.  You can check a framework archs with:

file /Library/Frameworks/QtSvg.framework/QtSvg

I don't know why it's failing on qwt designer.  It's not needed by QGIS really.  Try disabling it in the qwtconfig.pri - comment out the line to add it to the config.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GIT Branches and Tags
Message-ID: <BANLkTiniNCzCYBG6g9V7TX+y5mbJEhK=cQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I am trying to finish off some admin tasks relating to GIT. In our
previous discussions here on the mailing list it was suggested to
streamline the number of tags and branches, This afternoon I wrote
some scripts to create branches for some of the earliest releases
which were marked as tags rather than branches. I then remove all
other tags so that tags will now only contain checkpoints in oud
development - typically the points at which we issue Call For
Packaging requests. The other proposal (I think from Martin) was to
remove all the other non release branches. Currently the branch list
on the master QGIS repo looks like this:

  qgis-master/browser-and-customization
  qgis-master/dev-advanced-editing
  qgis-master/dev-advanced-printing
  qgis-master/dev-advanced-printing2
  qgis-master/dev-analysis
  qgis-master/dev-composer-redesign
  qgis-master/dev-dataprovider-overhaul
  qgis-master/dev-datasource
  qgis-master/dev-diagram
  qgis-master/dev-drag-and-drop
  qgis-master/dev-gdalogr-capi
  qgis-master/dev-generic-raster-datatype
  qgis-master/dev-grass-tidyup
  qgis-master/dev-lib-refactoring
  qgis-master/dev-mapcanvas
  qgis-master/dev-maptips
  qgis-master/dev-multiple-layers
  qgis-master/dev-ogr-plugin
  qgis-master/dev-projections-branch
  qgis-master/dev-provider0-9
  qgis-master/dev-qgis

  qgis-master/dev-sdts
  qgis-master/dev-start
  qgis-master/dev-symbology-ng
  qgis-master/dev-table-join
  qgis-master/dev-threading
  qgis-master/dev-trunk
  qgis-master/dev-ubuntu-dapper
  qgis-master/dev-vector-overlay
  qgis-master/dev-vendor
  qgis-master/dev-version-1-0
  qgis-master/dev-wfs
  qgis-master/master
  qgis-master/release-0_0_11
  qgis-master/release-0_0_12
  qgis-master/release-0_0_13
  qgis-master/release-0_10_0
  qgis-master/release-0_11_0
  qgis-master/release-0_5rc1
  qgis-master/release-0_6rc1
  qgis-master/release-0_7rc1
  qgis-master/release-0_8_0
  qgis-master/release-0_8_1
  qgis-master/release-0_9_0
  qgis-master/release-0_9_1
  qgis-master/release-0_9_2rc1
  qgis-master/release-1_0_0
  qgis-master/release-1_0_1
  qgis-master/release-1_0_2
  qgis-master/release-1_1_0
  qgis-master/release-1_2_0
  qgis-master/release-1_3_0
  qgis-master/release-1_4_0
  qgis-master/release-1_5_0
  qgis-master/release-1_6_0
  qgis-master/release-1_7_0


As you can see I have all the releases nice and consistently named. I
can go ahead and remove all other branches, I just wanted to double
check that that is ok for everyone. If I don't hear anything to the
contrary, I will go ahead and do so tomorrow so the final list will
look something like this:

  qgis-master/master
  qgis-master/release-0_0_11
  qgis-master/release-0_0_12
  qgis-master/release-0_0_13
  qgis-master/release-0_10_0
  qgis-master/release-0_11_0
  qgis-master/release-0_5rc1
  qgis-master/release-0_6rc1

  qgis-master/release-1_0_0
  qgis-master/release-1_0_1
  qgis-master/release-1_0_2
  qgis-master/release-1_1_0
  qgis-master/release-1_2_0

  qgis-master/release-1_4_0
  qgis-master/release-1_5_0
  qgis-master/release-1_6_0
  qgis-master/release-1_7_0

Cool! did not know that!

Yah, both arch's x86_64 and i386 installed as universal.

I'll keep grinding away at it.

I better keep notes this time!

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for packaging: QGIS 1.7.0 'Wroclaw'
Message-ID: <BANLkTin0zCHhd+A4hFjQty_YXwtMCicOiA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and
release team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about
the release have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our
press material etc.

--- End note ---

I have tagged QGIS 1.7.0 for release. The branch can be checked out
from git (QGIS official repo) on tag:

git checkout final-1_7_0

You may need to do a git fetch on the repo first before the tag is
available to you e.g.

git fetch qgis-upstream
git checkout final-1_7_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2.md5


It is my intention to maintain the 1.7.0 branch (probably I should
rename it to release-1_7) to backport bugfixes so that we can put out
1.7.x maintenance releases in the run up to the creation of 2.0. If
you are working in master and fix a bug, if you could be so kind as to
cherry-pick your commit into the 1.7 branch and push it over to the
main repo.


If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download wiki
page at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of your
package.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.

GIT master is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any
major code changes.

Obviously there is a lot of new stuff going on with GIT and Redmine,
so if packagers have particular issues we may need to adjust the
workflow. Please feel free to discuss on the thread started by this
email.


Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual
changelog, press announcements etc. ready for the release date? I will
send you an email when the packages are ready and you can start
broadcasting announcements.

Best regards

The Homebrew formulae may be of help:

For Qt:

    https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/qt.rb

For Qwt (note that you may need to downgrade Qwt from 6.0.0 to 5.2.1 to
compile QGIS):

    https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/qwt.rb

For QGIS (unreleased and under active development):

    https://github.com/Sharpie/homebrew/blob/qgis/Library/Formula/qgis.rb


The formula files are just Ruby scripts that calculate the required
arguments to configure, cmake, etc and then run the commands.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=3NQk0+=gkXZi39KEaQrJy-fhGEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
here [0] is my second weekly report.

Summary:
1. keep connections in a tree so can work on more databases at the same time
2. implemented the QgsDataItem for the postgres provider, it seems to work
with QBrowser (ASAP I will add the code to my QGis fork on GitHub [1]).

Cheers.

You can sponsor the fix by:
- hiring a developer
- make some money available to help motivating the current developers.
If others are interested, they can join the effort.
All the best.

PostGIS Raster seems to be doing pooled funding here:
http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster/PlanningAndFunding

I don't know how well the effort has been promoted and publicized, I
just learned about it from a recent email on the PostGIS list:

Hi All

Just a correction:

>
> http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2

Should have read:

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.gz
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.gz.md5

I think PostGIS has a very different user pool than QGIS, and the financing dynamics
are quite different.
Having said that, inspiration is always good ;)

Good point. In the longer term, it will be good to have a common framework for all
analytical tools:
- fTools
- GdalTools
- GRASS
- OTB
- SAGA
Am I missing some?
All the best.

hi, let's go:

gis=# select max(id) from nodes;
    max     
------------
 1314039345


bigint = int*8/64bit,  id is primary key getting bigger and bigger every
minute.

Add new layer:

http://wnordmann.homeunix.com/images/stories/osm/forum/screenshot-postgis-tabellen%20hinzufgen.png

and then 

http://wnordmann.homeunix.com/images/stories/osm/forum/screenshot-kann%20die%20schlsselspalte%20nicht%20finden.png

can be tested in about 60 seconds. just create a table with pk type bigint
and try.

creating oid's wont't help as those are even bigger. OSM ist a really BIG
database!

that's all.

Regards

walter

btw: max(id) is now 1314048177  (20 minutes later)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GIT Cleanup Completed
Message-ID: <BANLkTikvWbSodY_jr=ni3h0dcKp=Q4+3Hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Ok I have finished the cleanup of tags and branches in the GitHub main
repository for QGIS. If you have a clone, you may want to perform a
similar cleanup to your local repo. I strongly suggest making a backup
before doing this and checking that the script below does not trash
any of your valuable work. That said if you want a hint about how to
remove the pruned branches and tags from your github or other clone
you can use a variation of this bash script:

BRANCHLIST=$(git branch -r | grep origin | grep dev | sed
's/origin\///g' | grep -v threading)
for BRANCH in $BRANCHLIST
do
  echo "Deleting branch $BRANCH"
  git push origin :$BRANCH
done

TAGLIST=$(git tag -l | grep -v release-1-7-0)
for TAG in $TAGLIST
do
  echo "Deleting tag: $TAG"
  git push origin :refs/tags/$TAG
done

The above assumes that the main QGIS github is NOT your origin
repository, but rather a fork on github or a bare clone on another
server. Again, if https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS is your origin,
there is nothing to do.

I think the GIT repository is now in quite a neat clean and logical
state and ready for the whole world to get busy with when we announce
the upcoming release! We now have 34 branches (as opposed to around 70
before) and 1 tag.

Regards

 Hi,

 If this patch still works I would vote for applying it to trunk. It is 
 sad that one cannot load data with long id integer primary keys. OSM is 
 certainly an important enough community or data source to justify the 
 application of this patch.

 Or would it require a lot of additional work besides applying and 
 reviewing the patch?

That's the question.  IIRC the reason why I didn't apply the patch.  Currently
we don't have a feature id type so everything that is an int might actually be
a feature id - that needs to by changed to 64bit.

And that not only for variables and parameters, but also for signals and slots.
The former case would be picked up by the compiler, but the latter case won't.
So that needs quite an amount of testing.

The patch is likely to not apply cleanly anymore, but even if it did - there
might be new signals that it doesn't apply to yet.

So that probably means we'd apply it, break qgis here and there, test and train
to file redmine issues, git some more experience and end up with a fixed qgis
that has support for 64bit keys.

If that's ok, I'd revisit the issue.

But we have addVectorLayer/addRasterLayer, so QgisApp has to know
before the type of layer. Is it necessary? Could we have simply
addLayer() which adds correct layer type according to type returned by
provider for given URI?

Yes, QUrl probably is not sufficient, but it can be used for
encoding/decoding inside QgsDataSourceURI as suggested by Giuseppe.

Again, I would use QUrl methods for parsing and encoding as mentioned above.


I think, that we may forget about generic URI syntax
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme#Generic_syntax) or even about
registered schemes
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme#Official_IANA-registered_schemes).

I would suggest a QgsDataSourceURI with two types of params. One type
whould be set/recognized by a provider to set/get provider specific
data source URI params, for example setParam(key, val) and
getParam(key). All parts of URI would be stored as params so that for
example host name of WMS URI would be stored as "host" param not as a
special part of URI.

The second type of params would be known to QGIS but not to provider.
Methods like setStandardParam() / getStandardParam() would set / get
some standard parameters, for example setStandardParam("provider",
"WMS") would set provider key, which would be encoded in URI string as
"_provider=wms" (with underscore to distinguish standard params).
Layer type could also be a standard param if we find it necessary to
be a part of URI. Style hint or similar parameters could be add as
standard params to URI in future.

OK, problem solved. It seems there was an incomplete,
outdated and/or corrupt installation of QGIS on some
of the PCs involved.

Dear list --

I have had feedback from some QGIS (1.6) users at work
that a QGIS project saved on one PC fails to
open on another (in fact, it makes QGIS crash).

I have taken a good, long look at the project
file. It contains links to raster images (some
in GIF format), Shapefiles and spatial tables
in a PostGIS DBMS. But none of them look particularly
suspicious. I am baffled by this.

Does anyone here have a bright idea why there 
could be a problem with opening a QGIS project
file that was saved on a different PC (all of
them being Windows XP, and in the same local
network)?

Thanks,

Ben

If you shoot yourself in the foot with git (i.e. deleting a branch or
resetting a commit), git still has the "deleted" content. Content that has
been committed but then disconnected from a branch isn't destroyed unless an
aggressive garbage collection takes place or it is really, really old (like
a month or more).  You can use tools like `git reflog` and `git fsck` to
find the SHAs of "lost" content and then unshoot yourself in the foot using
`git checkout`, `git cherry-pick`, `git branch`, etc.

Of course, mounting a scratch monkey by copying the repo is more efficient
in terms of time than digging around in the reflog.  But in case you ever
find yourself with a toe missing...

 Hi J?rgen,

 I think it is acceptable to apply this to trunk, even with the risk of 
 breaking something major. At some point such bigger changes need to be 
 tested. The current trunk is still young and far away from the release 
 of version 1.8 or whatever the successor will be called.

 I'd be willing to test.

 +1 from me to try and apply the patch, given that it still works.

 Andreas

Thats the way gitbub generates the tarball. The hash at the end is the
exact revision for the release tag. Does it cause a problem for you
packaging wise? I guess its not so user friendly, so I could unpack it
rename it and repack it if you think it will be better.

No need to repack, just use git-archive to export a snapshot:

    # Sync with QGIS repo and pull down tags
    git fetch qgis-upstream
    git archive --format=tar --prefix=qgis-1.7.0/ final-1_7_0 | gzip >
qgis-1.7.0.tar.gz

Executive summary: yes.

It's impossible to crank a tarball like that on any sane build system
because there's no way to predict what the name of the top level
directory will be from the release version number alone -- all the
packagers will have to faff about hardcoding it whenever there's a new
release.  Look at the Arch Linux PKGBUILD or the Gentoo ebuild to see
what a pain that would be.

Meanwhile, Charlie:
> git archive --format=tar --prefix=qgis-1.7.0/ final-1_7_0 | gzip > qgis-1.7.0.tar.gz

Not like that, please.  Just --prefix=qgis-1.7.0/ (like every other
project on the planet and like every other previous qgis release)
would be much, much better.  And please use bzip2 like you always did
before.  Surprises are bad; they make work for everybody.

Another good solution is tar --exclude-vcs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Opening not spatial tables from SpatiaLite
Message-ID: <DUB108-w44D1579AE2E6F631E9096093630@phx.gbl>


Hi all,

I'm wondering if it is possible to implement the possibility of opening a non spatial table from a SqLite (SpatiaLite) file in QGIS.
As Paolo told me, a similar functionality for the PostGIS connector is already in place.
Actually, the only workaround I found is to create a geometry field set to null, turning a non spatial table in a fake spatial one, and declare the new field in geometry_columns table - not very neat.

Best!
Mauro

Hi,
Just a short remark , quoting one item of the "must needed list" posted
by Paolo C.  yesterday in the user list:
"automatic testing".

In agile programming, you write the tests before implementing new
features. Then you track the bugs at the source. Ideally, very few bugs
hit the beta-testers  (most remaining bugs are due to bugs in the
automated tests). The users test what they are good at: they do
usability tests only.

In the very short term, developing new features is more costly, though.
In the long term, everybody wins.

Hence I would slightly modify Paolo's list from:
- bigfixing
- bugfixing ;)
- automatic testing
- polishing
- infrastructure

into
- automatic testing
- bugfixing
- polishing
- infrastructure

(because if you test more, bugfixing becomes easier).

Just my 2 cents on things to keep in mind IMHO. Thanks all for the
wonderful work!!!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Web Client: problem with layers in different
	SRS
Message-ID: <20110607114619.GA28589@rigacci.org>

Hi,

I have a QGIS project with two layers: one is EPSG:3003 
(metric, Italy) and the other EPSG:900913 (metric, Google).
The whole project is in EPSG:3003.

QGIS Mapserver works well: layers are correctly overlapped.

The problem is with QGIS Web Client: the map extent is calculated 
without reprojecting, the 900913 layer prevails and "Zoom to the 
maximum map extent" gives a wrong result.

What is the supposed fix to this problem?

1) Do not mix different SRS in the project
2) Let QGIS Web Client do the proper reprojection
   (may be using OpenLayers.Map.displayProjection ?)
3) Force the map extent in GlobalOptions.js

I am fairly new to QGIS and to Python, although I have been in 
programming and GIS for several years. I need to write or customize a 
plugin that will act as an editor for a layer, with the addition of a 
table at the bottom showing related records from a join table that has a 
one-to-many relationship. There needs to be a way to edit and delete 
these records, as well as add new ones. Does anyone know of an existing 
plugin that does something similar to this, or have some sample code 
they would be willing to share to get me started?

 Hi Niccolo,

 I can explain how qgis webclient detects the max extent:

 * it picks the first layer it finds in the GetCapabilities and uses the 
 bounding box of this layer. In QGIS, in the WMS properties you can set 
 this bounding box and it means that all layers are written out in the 
 GetCapabilities with the same bounding box.

 When writing QGIS webclient I did not have to deal with different 
 projection in one QGIS project - so one could consider this a bug. QGIS 
 webclient should more intelligently calculate the bounding box.

 As a quick ugly fix, make sure that the first layer that appears in the 
 GetCapabilities is in the same CRS than the project CRS.

 You should also write a bug report at 
 http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-web-client/

Hi Michael,

here is some sample code to get the idea. The code lives in a QtDialog 
subclass; the dialog is designed using QtDesigner:

#I use a QTableWidget defined in QtDesigner with the name radweg (cyle 
path in English)
self.tblRadweg = self.ui.radweg

# I create a QSqlQuery to get all cycle paths related from my db
query = QtSql.QSqlQuery()
query.prepare(<SELECT string>)
query.exec_()
while query.next():
# returns false when all records are done
     self.tblRadwegAppendRow(query.value(0), \
     query.value(1).toString(), \
     query.value(2).toString(), \
     query.value(3).toString())

     # function to fill a row in the QTableWidget
     def tblRadwegFillRow(self, thisRow, radwegId, \
         artname, richtung, lage):

         radwegItem = QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(artname)
         radwegItem.radwegId = radwegId # the PK is attached here
         self.tblRadweg.setItem(thisRow, 0, radwegItem)
         self.tblRadweg.setItem(thisRow, 1, \
            QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(richtung))
         self.tblRadweg.setItem(thisRow, 2, QtGui.QTableWidgetItem(lage))

     # function to add  a row in the QTableWidget
     def tblRadwegAppendRow(self, radwegId, artname, richtung, lage):
         thisRow = self.tblRadweg.rowCount()
         # identical with index of row to be appended as
         # row indices are 0 based
         self.tblRadweg.setRowCount(thisRow + 1) # append a row
         self.tblRadwegFillRow(thisRow, radwegId, artname, \
             richtung, lage)

     # Slot when user double clicks on a row
     @QtCore.pyqtSlot()
     def on_radweg_itemDoubleClicked(self, radwegItem):
         thisRow = self.tblRadweg.currentRow()
         radwegItem = self.tblRadweg.item(thisRow, 0)
         radwegId = radwegItem.radwegId
         self.showRadweg(radwegId, thisRow)

     def showRadweg(self, radwegId, thisRow):
	# function to open another dialog where user can
         # input data for the cycle path


     # I have two buttons on the dialog one with "+" named "add"
     #the other with "-" named "remove"
     # here are their slots

     @QtCore.pyqtSlot()
     def on_btnAdd_clicked(self):
         self.showRadweg(-9999, -9999)
         # this opens the input form where the appropriate
         # INSERT statement is created
         # if user clicks OK there use self.tblRadwegAppendRow
         # to show the newly created dataset in your table

     @QtCore.pyqtSlot()
     def on_btnRemove_clicked(self):
         thisRow = self.tblRadweg.currentRow()
         radwegItem = self.tblRadweg.item(thisRow, 0)
         radwegId = radwegItem.radwegId
         # QtSqlQuery to delete the dataset
         query = QtSql.QSqlQuery(self.db)
         statement = QtCore.QString("DELETE FROM <radweg_table> \
         " WHERE id = :radwegId;")
         query.prepare(statement)
         query.bindValue(":radwegId", QtCore.QVariant(radwegId))
         query.exec_()

         if query.isActive():
             query.finish()
             # remove the row from the QTableWidget
             self.tblRadweg.removeRow(thisRow)
         else:
             self.showQueryError(query) # my error handler
             query.finish()

Two remarks:
1) More elegant IMHO would be a solution with a QTableModel and a QTableView
2) With QGIS' ability to load geometryless tables from a DB the hole 
thing could be done with QgsFeatures, too. Depending on how many records 
you have the DB solution with SQL will be faster, though.

hope this helps

Bernhard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Embedding of layers and legend groups from other
	projects
Message-ID: <201106071848.01502.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

Recently, I implemented support for embedding layers and legend groups from 
other project files. Like this, it is no longer necessary to repeat legend 
arrangements. Just embed groups and/or layers from other project files as 
references (Layer->embed layers and groups, then select a project file and mark 
the entities to embed). The reference can be absolute / relative depending on 
the project setting.

The code is contained in my github clone (git@github.com:mhugent/Quantum-
GIS.git). I'm planning to do some testing before pushing to the main repo. If 
you have some feedback, let me know.

One issue that I'm already aware of is the problem to embed several groups 
with the same name. Solution might be to generate a unique group id (similarly 
to the layer id), but this does not work for referencing old project files.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,
thanks for this feature.

This is huge!

It works regardless the type of datasource (vector or raster, shapes,
postgis, spatialite, etc.)?

cheers

Is this a coincidence?? Just last week we discussed this in #qgis and spacedman started a python plugin for this same functionality... it's great it's done already! I offer myself to test if you'd like... if I can get my hands on a compiled version that is.

Assunto: [Qgis-developer] Embedding of layers and legend groups from other projects

Hi devs

Recently, I implemented support for embedding layers and legend groups from
other project files. Like this, it is no longer necessary to repeat legend
arrangements. Just embed groups and/or layers from other project files as
references (Layer->embed layers and groups, then select a project file and mark
the entities to embed). The reference can be absolute / relative depending on
the project setting.

The code is contained in my github clone (git@github.com:mhugent/Quantum-
GIS.git). I'm planning to do some testing before pushing to the main repo. If
you have some feedback, let me know.

One issue that I'm already aware of is the problem to embed several groups
with the same name. Solution might be to generate a unique group id (similarly
to the layer id), but this does not work for referencing old project files.

Regards,
Marco

 Yeah, I just finished a pretty simple python plugin that basically
reads <maplayer> entries from a .qgs project file XML, then puts them
in a Qt table with the basic info (type, geometry, datasource) and a
check box. Check the layers you want, and they get loaded into Qgis.

 Doesn't handle groups (havent tried it with project files with
groups...) or anything else really... But it does load the layers in
with the styling.

 A simple extension would be to load all layers from a plugin in a
kind of 'include project' option.

Ok, we will take both the plugin and the core feature :)

thanks for your work.

Hi

Ok so first, my apologies - I don't want to make life hard for
packagers! I recreated the tarballs using:

cd ~/Quantum-GIS
git archive --format=tar --prefix=qgis-1.7.0/ final-1_7_0 | \
 bzip2 > /var/www/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2
md5sum /var/www/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2 > \
  /var/www/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2.md5

I removed the old source package and the new (hopefully acceptable) one is here:

http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.0.tar.bz2.md5

Thanks for your patience.

Regards

Tim

Hi Barry

Interesting, I didn't know about that plugin.

It seems the functionality is a bit different. The one in core embeds a 
reference into the project file (and QgsProject as well as QGIS server need to 
know how to handle referenced groups and layers). On every project load, you 
get updates if the original project has changed.

Whereas it sounds the plugin loads the layers from other projects (therefore 
copying those layer settings to the current project). Advantage here is that 
it is independant (no dependencies on external projects that could be removed 
or changed).

Depends on the use case which one to prefer.

Regards,
Marco

 Yes, it looks like it. Some people might want to have a library of
'base map' projects which other people reference as inclusions via the
core code, others might just want to pull some layers out of their own
projects with my plugin to save them having to find the source and set
up styling. Win win :)

 I suppose I should use this plugin of mine as an excuse to work out
how the new Qgis plugin repo system works...

Barry,

That sounds like a handy plugin.  I was going to writing something like that
ages ago but now I don't have to :).  Pretty please release it.

This sounds reasonable to me.

What do you mean with 'style hint' in that context? A feature style that comes 
from the provider (e.g. kml, dxf)?

Ok,  I just start using "Active tickets by component", "Active tickets

Thank you Andreas for your interest.

I opened this bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3964
I also posted a patch, which "works-for-me".

I think that there are (at least) two different types of testing that are
valuable for a project like QGIS and both play important roles. Different
people use different names, but here's my version...
1) White box: This is very much in the hands of the developer and is aimed
at proving the functionality of their code - stop the bug before it gets out
of your own hands. This type of testing knows how the code should work and
typically, among other things, explores the boundary conditions.
2) Black box: This has no special knowledge of how the internals works and
tests as a dumb user... that can be relied on to provide the same test
coverage every time. One obvious use of this is for regressions testing of
the finished build, but I would suggest that with minor enhancements it
could be used to help ease some of the user documentation tasks.
QGIS supports multiple languages and operating systems, is released
regularly but, consequently, it is hard to produce user manuals and
tutorials with the most appropriate screen shots, etc. 
If a "black box" type of test harness were developed that could be "trained"
(e.g. recording keystrokes and mouse commands with a way to edit them) plus
the ability to capture images of screen objects (windows, dialogs, buttons,
icons) and save them to named files, this would present further
opportunities. The same test (script?) could be run on builds for different
operating systems, languages and versions. A standard set of build specific
images would be generated and, assuming standard file names and locations,
could automatically be imported into the various user documents. There would
still need to be some manual text editing, but the labour intensive
screenshot processing would be removed.
This must be a common requirement across projects, has anyone come across
any tools that already exist?

I have a following question that is important for my understanding, and I would like to know what is the relationship between the data provider and the layer and if I set the setSubsetString in the provider of a layer does it propagate to the layer if I query the selection on the layer? As part of the inheritance rules, does the layer push down the selection to the provider or are they dynamically aware of selections between them.

Thank you,

Hello,

Do you know about Sikuli ?
http://sikuli.org/

I never tested it, but it seems very nice for the "black box" testing,  
and can probably handle the automatic screenshot generation.

Cheers,
Julien

I would be interested in participating as "dumb user",

The 'black box' sounds interesting and a way to organize dumb users for
debugging/edu/user docs/ergonomics

All-
   We are making some good progress on the ossim image provider (qgsossimprovider.cpp). Couple questions:

(1) Is there a way for users to specify which provider to use? It looks like QGIS is hard coded to use the GDAL provider. 

(2) Band statistics. QGIS is pretty inefficient when it comes to computing band statistics. Its looping through all the pixels multiple times (once for each band) to populate the viewport. For RGB data for example, its looping through the data 3 times. In OSSIM, we can provide the band statistics for you so you don't have to scan the data. This will speed things up dramatically. BTW, this is true for both the GDAL and OSSIM providers.

(3) Black pixels (0,0,0 RGB) are being flipped to transparent. Is there a way to override this behavior programatically? 

(4) In OSSIM we have a concept of image chains and connectable objects. You can wire up all kinds of filters and equations into a workflow to create an output image. The image chain can be represented using an array of key value pairs. Does the provider interface provide a mechanism for passing this type of information?

(5) Can we post our ossim image provider to your svn for others to play with?


Thanks,
Ming

Hi Tim-
   We are playing with 1.6. We'll download the 1.7 branch right away. I agree, use of gdal should be abstracted away into a gdal provider. Sounds like we would create an OSSIM provider.

And yes, we want to create/execute OSSIM image chains directly in QGIS! 

Thanks,
Peter

What version are you building against? Since the 1.7 branch and in
current master branch, Radim Blazek has done a great overhaul to cater
for proper raster providers. That means you should not find QGIS is
heavily intertwined with GDAL - the use of gdal should be abstracted
away into the gdal provider, and you should be able to implement ossim
raster support as a clean separate provider.

I would also really love to see OSSIM support in QGIS (and maybe some
of those nice processing chains making their way into QGIS :-).

Regards

Tim

It was just vague idea, I don't know yet how to use it exactly, CAD
symbology is one possibility. I was thinking more about drag-and-drop
of layers. Is there any plan how to encode layer info (including
style) for dragging between two QGIS instances? Does it make sense?

Another question, how to store parameters encoded in URI in project
file? Should everything be stored in one URI tag or separated into
attributes or tags?

Hi,
Some time ago I used xmacro (a Keyboard/mouse macro utility) to create a
set of screenshots for a software (GanttProject) in about 15 languages;
then it was integrated in OpenOffice documents with relative links.
In my experience only the keyboard part was reliable, which requires to
have unique and stable keyboard shortcuts for every single menu and
dialog box, which is currently very far to be the case (improvements
here will also improve usability and user productivity). Interaction in
the map canvas is more problematic here.

There is also this from the qt manual:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.8-snapshot/gettingstarted-develop.html#testing-qt-applications
including this which supports mouse and keyboard simulation:

I figured it out. I was assuming that the setSubsetString would do the querying and update the selection set, but I gather now after a few hours of hardwork that is not its purpose, it just limits the accessible features with out changing the selection set. 

How can I help update the documentation to reflect what the methods are meant to do?

Thank you,

Let me lay bare my hearts desire, is it alright to have a method that updates the selection set using the setSubString query? What is the reason that such a powerful way to query the data does not also have a means to update the selection set?

I know I am pushing my luck or my providence. But God is generous to the rich as well as to the poor and I am told to ask always and I am sure there will be answer soon. Or am I talking only to myself here?

I have learned from you how I can select all the features in a layer through code using extents and attribute lists. What I would like is to be able to use a simple command that says layer->selectall() or something like that. I think selection is very important method in GIS. 

I  think of Quantum GIS, which is in a league on its own as with Quantum Mechanics where one desperately tries to measure properties applying the Heisenberg Principle. 

We are in need of a way to select and measure the particles in as many ways as we can. 

What do you think?

I have a layer of simple lines (ie straight lines with no midpoint nodes), which I want rendered so that only lines with one of the endpoints within the extents are displayed and selectable.  Lines which cross the map window but do not terminate in it are omitted.

This is to display land survey data, where I'm only interested in observations relating to marks in the current view.

At the moment my best idea on implementation is to intercept the mapcanvas render starting and render ending events, and update the layer subset query on render starting and reset it on render ending.  But I suspect that changing the query will trigger a refresh, which will mess things up.  And even if it doesn't, subsequently selecting on the layer will find features not included in the canvas.

Perhaps better would be to update the layer subset query whenever the canvas extents change.  This is probably safer, and gets around the issue of selection.  It will be messy handling interations with user written layer subselects though.  Also I'm not sure that it will sit well with the map composer?

I think that the ideal solution is to have a custom data provider or vector layer that overrides the select() function (though again I suspect this would corrupt the user select functions).

I'm not really wanting to be writing C++ for this - hoping for a python solution.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgisSQL plugin
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=d20ekbuPM2CCP7uiarN8rLer1mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Qgis developers

I was working in a C++ plugin for interact with SQL databases and vector
layers,
the plugin is something like a "generic SQL" interpreter.

The interpreter language is created with the help of the C++ version of the
parser generator Coco/R,
and I hope that could be extended to a more rich and complex language.

At the moment the plugin capabilities are:
- Send any query to PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server (only in
windows, maybe in linux with UnixODBC) databases
- Persistent save of created connections and queries.
- Association of saved queries to a vector layer.
- Copy tables from a database to other (testing).

The project source and some precompiled libs are hosted at google code in
the girs project
http://code.google.com/p/girs/

Some features are not already enabled.

Please take a look
Observations are welcome

Pedro

Hi Aju,

How is your plugin different from e.g. RT SQL Layer plugin?

Are you aware that there is work going on in this year's Google Summer of
Code:
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/brushtyler/15001

It sounds like duplicated effort.

Best wishes,
Anita

Feel free to add this feature request to the bug tracker or to even write
the patch to add this function to the layer class.

is it alright to have a method that updates the selection set using the

Why not?

Imho, the query string has nothing to do with the selection set. If you
first set the query string, you can then select all features left in the
layer.

Anita

Hi Ming

This sounds interesting. What dependencies on external libraries does the 
provider have?

QGIS switched to git in the meantime. You could clone the QGIS repository 
(git@github.com:qgis/Quantum-GIS.git) and upload the changes to the cloned 
repo. Or just provide a patch against current master branch.

This needs changes in the GUI. If it is only about file based datasources, it 
is a possibility to add a combo box to the 'add rasterlayer' dialog. 

If database / web services should also be accessed, it might be necessary to 
add a new dialog.

Marco

Hi everybody,

no hints for this problem?
I have the same problem with the mapcomposer window.
When closing the mapcomposer window I want to get the close signal or close
event of the window.
I need this because I want to switch of some things in the map canvas
automatically which I switched on when the user clicked the "Map Button" in
the GUI.

thx in advance

Michael

That's fantastic Tim, many thanks, it's perfect.

Hi Marco-
    The new provider is based on ossim which at its core has relatively few dependencies (libtiff, geotiff, jpeg, openthreads, etc). Ming will push out the code next week after we shake a couple more things out. The band statistics is a real killer right now. We could really use your advice on that. It requires changes to one of the the base classes.

As for (1), I think the simplest thing to do is to have a global preference/getting to select an image provider. This would be an interim solution while we flesh out the ossim provider.

BTW, Ming figured out (5) last night - simple one liner. 

In summary, we're still exploring (2) Band Statistics and (4) method for passing in definitions for image chains. Any thoughts/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!


Best Regards,
Peter

Both are nice :-) 18 months ago I expressed a wish to do something like:

Hi all.
We are interested in an extension of current qgis-mapserver, allowing different users
(or groups of) to see different layers (or different projects).
Is anyone working on that, or willing to collaborate on a mainstream solution?
All the best.

This is a known issue. I have a branch where I have been replacing the

Its still unstable but maybe you can see where I am heading with this.

Currently not, but its an addition that we would love to see. The OTB

Since we are using GIT now, you can simply fork QGIS, apply your
patches and invite others to test it out. I look forward to doing so

Message-ID: <276050.97483.qm@web160807.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Thank you Anita for the suggestions. I would like to put a ticket out on the needed improvement for this issue. I feel it is highly inconsistent that even after applying the setSubsetString(qry) , if one selects all the data, the selection includes all the items in the layer. Is there another way to select what is only included on the layer as per the subsetString? 

When I execute a selection set of all the features on the layer, the sub-query appears to be invisible to the selection code, and it ends up telling me all the features are selected. This is misleading because I would think I have access to all the features as per what the selection size is reporting from Layername.selectedFeatureCount() number.

Thank you again for your help,

Maaza

I have learned from you how I can select all the features in a layer through code using extents and attribute lists. What I would like is to be able to use a simple command that says layer->selectall() or something like that

Feel free to add this feature request to the bug tracker or to even write the patch to add this function to the layer class.

is it alright to have a method that updates the selection set using the setSubString query??Why not??
What is the reason that such a powerful way to query the data does not also have a means to update the selection set??
Imho, the query string has nothing to do with the selection set. If you first set the query string, you can then select all features left in the layer.

Best wishes, Anita?

Hi All

How can I determine the group index of a group containing a layer?

Basically I'm creating a new layer, and wanting to add it to the same group as a new layer. It looks like the only way to add a layer to a group is via the group index.  But I can't see any way to determine the group index of an existing layer.  

The nearest I've got is 

  [i for i,x in enumerate(legend.groupLayerRelationship()) if layer.id() in x[1]]

But this doesn't work with nested groups.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks
Chris

I would like to implement drag-and-drop from QBrowser to QGIS soon.
Then if you implement dataItem() in your provider, it will be possible
to drag your layers directly from file tree in the QBrowser.

> (3) Black pixels (0,0,0 RGB) are being flipped to transparent. Is there a way to override this behavior programatically?

You should be able to set 'no data' reimplementing
isNoDataValueValid() and noDataValue(). I am not sure however if it
works with 3-bands rasters correctly. Note that it is also possible to
represent a raster as image using ARGBDataType which is probably also
faster then 3-bands because it does not have to read data 3 times.
Then however, the access to true data is lost and it is impossible to
switch bands etc.

We should probably add another data type similar to ARGBDataType,
something like ThreeBands or Byte3 which would allow to read 3 bands
in one call. The GDAL provider would also benefit from this.

> (4) In OSSIM we have a concept of image chains and connectable objects. You can wire up all kinds of filters and equations into a workflow to create an output image. The image chain can be represented using an array of key value pairs. Does the provider interface provide a mechanism for passing this type of information?

The concept of chains should be included in
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/QGIS-Processing-Framework in my
opinion. So that chains can be created using data and tools from
various providers and packages.  Or at least, the framework should be
designed so, that it will allow later addition of chains on some upper
level.

  have  a look at [0] it is the data loader for my temporal data plugin, It
     generates new groups and adds layers programmatically. Please note that
     it is not possible [yet] to nest groups deeper than a level due to the

Message-ID: <BANLkTimh5pNg0brnK3HRi+JYi_9YhHWF=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi (probably mainly to Marco)

1) I made some changes to the logging infrastructure in QGS Mapserver.
My pull request is here.

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/28

Could you take a look and tell me if you are ok for me to apply it?

2) I have this (big) problem with QGS Mapserver not rendering my
layers. I spent the day debugging and it seems that

in src/mapserver/qgswmsserver.cpp

1197     QList<QgsMapLayer*> layerList =
mConfigParser->mapLayerFromStyle( *llstIt, styleName, allowCaching );

always returns an empty list. My test map is very simple, three
postgis line layers all with default styling, epsg 32533 (UTM 33 N).
In all other respects, it seems to work fine (getCapabilities etc),
just the above line which cause no layers to be passed to maprenderer.
Do you have any ideas why this may be?

Thanks!

Hope you can get Proj 4.7 and GEOS 3.3.0 NDK libraries going, so we
can try Spatialite in Android as well.

Here's a link to Android Spatialite patch (below) without Proj and GEOS

http://groups.google.com/group/spatialite-users/browse_thread/thread/78332fc2b945d282/7f18d192ee4c72f4?lnk=gst&q=android#7f18d192ee4c72f4

(I understand Spatialite is not part of your project).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] From QGIS --> QGIS Mapserver--> Openlayers and Back
Message-ID: <BANLkTimtwDY=ZT8uC16WvG77wtk4R8GGzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Has someone implemented this already using QGIS.qgs (project),(i.e.
map style and layers, etc.) into QGIS Mapserver and Openlayers?

It seems Andreas Neumann has done QGIS Mapserver + Openlayers with
ExtJS for visualisation of data i.e pre-rendered vector layers.

Is the data for the QGIS Mapserver comes from the QGIS project (*.qgs)?

http://gis.uster.ch/webgis/

http://gis.uster.ch/webgis/production/index.shtml?map=/home/www/projekte/av/grundplan_av.qgs&format=image/png&visibleLayers=Raumplanung,Nomenklatur,Fixpunkte,Geb%C3%A4ude,Grenzen,Einzelobjekte,Bodenbedeckung,Liegenschaften%20Fl%C3%A4che,Einzelobjekte%20Unterst%C3%A4nde,Einzelobjekte%20Unterirdische%20Geb%C3%A4ude

Right now, I have ipad app (i.e. jQuery Mobile + OpenLayers)  and like
to connect to QGIS Mapserver. Any QGIS Mapserver that I can use, just
for testing?

At the moment, I want to do are:

1. Sync back my openlayers traces and drawings into remote database -
spatialite and or Postgis using WKT.
2. View vector traces  in QGIS desktop.

Hi,
I will let Andreas correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
http://gis.uster.ch is not "pre-rendered vector layers" but rendered on
the fly. The reason I believe so is that, if you try hard enough moving
street names near the page border, you'll see that the labels are
rendered on the fly.
(still, technically I guess it might be possible to pre-render part of
http://gis.uster.ch ).

Sorry for the slightly trolling message ;-) Still the distinction
matters in some cases, see this thread were I mention the same server:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.openstreetmap.devel/22768

Sorry, wrong chose of words. What I  meant, "prepare vector layers",
not a result of SQL queries from PostGIS / Spatialite Terminal on
Openlayer client.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis will only load WMS Layers in WGS84
Message-ID: <BANLkTim1mxpZCYZBv0czWE5pSA1LWvEtcw@mail.gmail.com>

I am using OSGeo4W qgis trunk revision 1b15528 on Windows 7 64-bit.

I have several geotiff layers on Geoserver 2.1 in native srs of EPSG:3375.
They display fine using Geoserver's preview layer.

When I try to load them using QGis wms, they will only load when the project
is set to EPSG: 4326. When I set the project to EPSG:3375, nothing is
loaded. Changing the crs in the wms dialog doesn't help.

Not sure if this is the same issue faced by Mike Leahy:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-May/012131.html

Thanks for any pointers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symbolForFeature in Python api?
Message-ID: <4DF3BC81.8010709@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

for an export plugin it would be handy to get to the symbol of every
feature in a layer.

There is a cpp-api method called 'symbolForFeature':

http://doc.qgis.org
/head/classQgsRenderer.html#e237fcfb16142298caaa27b62dc8614c

but apparently it is not available in the python object of a renderer?

Tried to add it myself by adding a line:
   virtual QgsSymbol* symbolForFeature( QgsFeature *f );
to
   python/core/qgsrenderer.sip

but that isn't working

-1- is there a reason to NOT add the symbolForFeature to the python api?
-2- what do I have to do to add it (temporarily in my own build)
-3- will there be problems with old and new symbology, if not: please
add :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Preparing for the release announcement
Message-ID: <BANLkTikoK1wZdhKW3=0-BG3uzmyQqnEWLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Along with the release announcement which I will send out this week (I
am just holding off while we try to figure out why windows rasters are
rendering funny - http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3867) and while we sort
out some other admin related things. Along with the release
announcement, I want to include in the release announcement a mention
of the huge updates we have been doing in the project infrastructure:

- Alessandro's new plugin manager site http://plugins.qgis.org
- The snippets site http://snippets.qgis.org
- The new users site http://users.qgis.org
- The new planet site at http://planet.qgis.org (let me know if you
want your blog added).
- The move to redmine with project hosting for 3rd party plugins
http://hub.qgis.org
- And of course the shift to GIT

If you have time, could you take a moment to test these sites by:

- Upload any plugins you want to share to the http://plugins.qgis.org
(Alessandro has made a big push to get everything ready over the last
week)
- Try posting some useful snippets (python or C++) to http://snippets.qgis.org
- Add yourself to the users map at http://users.qgis.org
- Add your plugins to hub.qgis.org if you need them hosted in a git repo
- Resyndicate the planet blog to appropriate places
etc.

It would be great to have some good content in these sites and also to
know that they are working well when we open the floodgates.

There are still a number of items to sort out in the shift to redmine.
Pirmin has updated all ticket -> commit references and setup syncing
for the QGIS repo browser which was probably the most urgent thing
needed. Other todo items are listed at
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-redmine - we will try to tackle them
as we get the time.

Hopefully the teething pains will be few as we get up and running with
all these nice new facilities.

Regards

Tim

the issue is confirmed also under Linux. At the beginning I though that
I had problem in my Ubuntu box because of conflicting gdal libraries.
But today I installed everything from scratch and it behave as already
noticed under Windows.

Applied your patches to my repo, Julien, thanks a lot!

What is your opinion on the function of the "QGIS Processing *plugin*"
-- just showing the panel? Or should perhaps everything gui-related be
moved into the plugin? Is it really necessary, couldn't the framework
singleton could just register the panel & associated menu items?

I intend to soon publish a prototype of the plugin(s) on the faunalia
repo, so that we'll hopefully have more feedback.

Regards,

Camilo

Did this. It is probably cleaner to keep gui code out of the framework.
Also removed the 'Library' class. Seems unnecessary to have that level
of hierarchy if we have tags.

Yes I have remembered! Anita is busy shifting the visual changelog
over from the wiki to the web site. I will then add some notes about
the new websites as described in this thread, and then I'll post a
note here for you and other translators so you can translate it.

What version of GDAL are you using? I can't replicate it under linux
here (but I have a svn trunk build of gdal).

it happens if I just add the nightly build repository (to install
trunk), so using gdal 1.6.3 available in of the Ubuntu repository.

It happens also if I add the ubuntugis repository and then install gdal
1.8 (compiling QGIS trunk myself against gdal 1.8). But If I install
qgis 1.6 available in the ubuntugis repo (compiled against gdal 1.8)
then no issue.

I tested the same gdal libraries to render rasters with other
applications, like mapserver and had no problems whatsoever. So my guess
is that the issue is in QGIS.

This is more or less the same it happens under Windows.

Sounds reasonable to me.

Hello list,

I was looking for pyqgis cookbook and on wms step, I'm stuck in my test.
I search in archives and see
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/Re-RE-Qgis-user-WMS-in-python-td2039236.htmland

for me.
It's related to my install? only my code ? Someone get clues to solve this,
please?
You will find below my tests both in command line and qgis python console.

Message-ID: <20110613161545.17371sht6rc5oyvl@messagerie.si.c-s.fr>

Hello,

Here are some remarks :

- It's good to have deleted the Library class. I had no use of it.  
This makes the code much more simpler.

- Is the Plugin class really necessary ? It does nothing now. Maybe  
it's better to remove it also, so each plugin can do what he wants  
during the import (maybe also create a specific gui for its own  
"general configuration"). The only thing important to be a "processing  
plugin" would be to register itself to the framework during initGui()  
and deregister itself in unload(). I think it would be more coherent  
with the way Qgis manages plugins (you could more easily  
enable/disable one of the implementations in the plugin manager,  
probably better for updates too)

- I think a lot currently happen in the constructors and during the  
different module imports (loading of all the modules with their  
description/params/etc), and it would be good to lower it down.
Currently we register "modules" to the framework.
Could we instead register one main object which can be queried for a  
list of available modules (their names, description, tags, docs,...),  
for a list of general info to keep track of its provenance (is it  
"Saga", "OTB", ..., so that the framework knows easily how to  
differenciate them), and can create actual ModuleInstance on demand ?  
The idea would be that the framework ask things to the different  
implementations when it needs to, and not the other way around (as it  
is a singleton, i think it is safer that way)
Also, IMHO the details of the different parameters of a module should  
not be taken into account as long as we don't create an instance of  
this module.

- about the gui part : should it be possible to create the specific  
widget for a parameter for which the framework does not provide a  
default ? i think so. Maybe it would make sense that each  
ModuleInstance can be queried for the widget, a default implementation  
being provided for all standard types. Even for the standard provided  
widgets, it could be nice to be able to simply subclass them to add  
our own things (not sure about this).

- is there a need for keeping 2 modules (processing and  
processingplugin) ? can a plugin depend on another plugin (in my otb  
plugin can I "import processingplugin") ? if yes, putting everything  
in one plugin will make it more easy to distribute a version of the  
code (as long as it is python...).

- the panel should be more tied to the framework singleton : when a  
new plugin is loaded/unloaded, it should be possible to update the  
Panel for example (putting the gui initialization outside of the Panel  
constructor may help)

- the panel does not provide an easy way to differenciate between the  
different implementations (saga/otb...). Maybe a tag could be used for  
it, or maybe it should be given a different meaning (like the "main  
tag"). For later, you might want to add an easy way to enable/disable  
all the OTB/Saga/Gdal/ by just clicking on an icon ?

- I/O : how will this be handled ? I'm asking this related to the  
recent mails with interest for providing ossim image chains in Qgis.
If it must support module chaining, then there is a need for an  
abstraction of the i/o mechanism. is it the qgis dataproviders ? a  
module can take a raster/vector dataprovider as input and can output a  
raster/vector dataprovider ?

Keep up the good work !
Julien

As a first step, it will be interesting to know how the independent  
ossim processing modules can fit into the processing framework which  
is currently being built.
The OrfeoToolbox has a similar pipeline concept which would be nice to  
make available from the framework. Having another software with the  
same need will be valuable, if not mandatory, to build the proper high  
level interface for this concept.
Also, are you aware of http://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/wiki/GsocPyOssim ?

Regards,
Julien

I think also the capability of piping together GRASS commands would be valuable.
Of course, piping all modules regardless of their origin would be *the* real killer.
All the best.

Hi,

Sorry to reply lately and thanks for your interest on this topic.
Nathan has done a good description of my request and reading from you make
me think it is not impossible.

Do you think this can be developed as plugin?
If yes, I would be happy to work with some of you interested but
unfortunetly I don't think I could handle that alone, since I don't know the
QGIS API yet, I don't speak  fluently python (but I can play with it) and I
don't have that much time.

Just let me know

Regards,
simon

Just wondering how the new plugins repository relates to the existing user contributed plugins repo.

Should we move plugins to the new one, and if so should we delete them from the existing repository, or is it fine to have two versions of the same plugin?

Yes, please move your plugin over.
No need to delete it off the current site, at least not at this time.
Eventually that site will get turned off once the all the plugins are
moved and QGIS ships with the correct url to the new site.

Thanks,
Alex

Yes, you are correct, the processing.Plugin class does nothing -- does
no harm either, but agree on removing it.

Also remove the arguments from the processing. Module constructor, and
have e.g. saga.Module override paramters(), name(), tags(), etc, so
that the relevant code only gets executed when necessary.
Each plugin would then be responsible for registering/deregistering
it's modules. Either passing a list or a callback to the framework.

On the provenance: I just had the saga implementation add a 'saga' tag
to every module. I think that's the simplest solution. It doesn't show
up currently, because, every module having that tag it is deemed
irrelevant by the framework.

Implement parameter.widget(value) in a subclass if you want custom
widgets. That function should get called by
processingplugin.Dialog.widgetByType(), if present. Haven't tried it
yet, though.

Open for discussion if you think this is not the best way to handle this.

But, YOU introduced 'processingplugin'! :D

I think it is a good idea to keep them both: QGIS plugins are
inherently GUI-related, they have a initGui method, after all. But,
the QGIS processing framework should work in a GUI agnostic way, so
that it will be useful in other environments, too. Having processing
for the logic & processingplugin for the GUI, forces us to keep both
aspects separated.

Perhaps the names are too similar, confusing... rename
processingplugin to processingPanel or processingGUI or something?

I am not sure of what you mean: I precisely tried to separate the
framework from the panel. What would be A Good Thing, I think, is
reimplementing the panel with QTreeView and the framework as a
ItemModel. That way the panel would get updated whenever the framework
changes.
What do you think?

Agree: tags. Standard tags for now, I think. If we see the need to
introduce 'special tags' we can always do that later.

Yes, qgis dataproviders, I think. Perhaps alternatives later. This is,
IMO, one of the most dificult aspects remaining to define.
Note that I had defined 'roles' for parameters: input, output &
option, feedback.
Input & output would contain dataproviders, while option & feedback
contain other variables, e.g. integers, strings, etc. The later are
read-only from the frameworks point of view, just a way to pass
messages or simple results to the user.

There also is the special 'state' option paramter, which controls the
ModuleInstance's, well, state (running, paused, stopped, etc.)

There is a new plugin - a console, Fast SQL Layer for QGIS.

Have you seen this?

Not really what Simon is getting at.  I guess not many people on here are
MapInfo users as well.  MapInfo's SQL allows you to query any datasource
using SQL, so you could do Select * From table1,Table2 where
table1.comecolumn > 10.

Where table2 is a shape file and table1 is a tab file.

@Simon Yes I think you "could" do it via a plugin although I'm not sure how
it would go on speed.  And stuff like this should really be built into the
program.  I'll investigate the plugin route if only as a prototype.

what we need to develop is quite simple (to explain). Users should be
able to register/login in the webclient (users data stored in a
geometryless table in the qgis project?), then, depending on what user
group the user belong, show certain layers/groups in the TOC of the web
client. User data (name, address, etc.) should be stored after the login
to allow use them in the print layouts.

One way or another we will have to develop something like that, so we
would prefer to do it the right way, upstream and in a way that can be
useful to as much people as possible.

If anyone is interested in collaborate please us know.

Cheers

Hi,

please copy or move your plugins to the new site (we are actively working on
the development of the new site) and file a ticket on
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues if you find any issue.

Please notice that if you are not a staff or "trusted" user your plugins
will not be immediately published and a notification email will be sent to
all staff members.

Once a staff member will flag you as "trusted" you will be able to publish
your plugins.

The new site also supports:

* plugins icons
* tags classification (will be available in QGIS desktop)
* revisions (experimental  and stable)

Hi,

I am not able to login to hub.qgis.org. If I try to login on
hub.qgis.org/login with my valid OSGEO login, it brings me to
'Register' page (still hub.qgis.org/login) and it tells me "Email has
already been taken". The first time I tried to login, it told me
something like "Your first name must not be empty" and I blindly
filled in the first name and clicked 'Submit'. So maybe I have created
on hub.qgis.org another login with the same email which is now in
conflict with that from OSGEO? I have not recieved any email from
hub.qgis.org however. If I created such account, how can I delete it?

The system seems to have picked a different login id for your email
address. I just changed it to match your osgeo-id. Try logging in now.

 Hi,

 I am not sure I fully understand the question. As Mayeul stated, QGIS 
 server always renders the live data, directly from the database. There 
 is no pre-rendering or caching involved. If you are looking for a 
 proxy/caching solution, you could try the Map-proxy open source project.

 Or are you looking for an offline vector data storage that a webclient 
 can use, edit and sync back in at a later stage? If yes, then I don't 
 think there is a solution yet. You may want to experiment with SQLite in 
 the webbrowser, but at the current stage neither QGIS server nor QGIS 
 webclient is of help for that.

 If you are just looking for a QGIS server that you can use to 
 experiment from a WMS client, you can use the services from 
 http://gis.uster.ch/ (see links to GetCapabilities files).

 Hi Giovanni,

 I would be interested in having a solution that works in a generic way 
 for many people/projects.

 There are several problems involved:

 * user authentification (also needs a secure connection (https)) - 
 could be handled by a python script?
 * user data storage (can be in a database table (e.g. Postgis, SQLite)) 
 - after the login, QGIS webclient could also store the basic user data, 
 such as name and address.
 * QGIS server should be made aware about table permissions 
 (roles/groups) and build the GetCapabilities tree accordingly.

 Also, I think permissions should be attached either to
 a) a whole .qgs project (one could use Apache permissions for that)
 b) or certain layers in a .qgs project

 How fast do you need that implemented? I think it would be useful to 
 include Pirmin, Marco and J?rgen into the discussion, or whoever else is 
 interested. Maybe something to discuss in a telcon/IRC?

That means your layer name / style was not found in the project file. What 
happens if you step into the function with the debugger? For a normal layer, 
it should find something in the first section of  
QgsProjectParser::mapLayerFromStyle (qgsprojectparser.cpp:321). If it does not 
help, could you prepare a sample project (maybe with spatialite layers to 
avoid db import) and send it to me?

How inputs are taken in charge for now? I guess there is already an
abstraction layer or something, no?

Simon,

I started working on a very rough (read: try to much and it will explode)
prototype in Python today, if I get something usable at some stage I will
throw it up on github .  It's not going to handle geometry stuff right away,
just basic Select {columns} from {tables} where {foo} = {bar}.  But for a
prototype it will do for now.

The abstraction layer is QgsVectorLayer and QgsFeature which means you can
just use those to classes to handle joining and comparing features for any
dataset.

Yes, this is what I am asking. Offline Tile might not be doable in
Openlayes or Webclient. Vectors layer can achieve.

I got spatialite running in ipad simulator in Webkit. OpenLayers is
running in Ipad/iphone simulator. I got Geometry as WKT from SQL query
from Spatialite database. However, I have not done yet, the WKT render
in Openlayer SVG from these queries.

The idea is to save WKT Openlayer traces into Spatialite database and
render WKT (Geometry) from SQL queries in the Openlayer SVG map
canvas. Then synch Spatialite Database into PostGIS / Spatialite
server.

What would be the right WMS entry, similar to this below?

~~~~~~~
var wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
  "OpenLayers WMS",
  "http://vmap0.tiles.osgeo.org/wms/vmap0",
  {'layers':'basic'} );
map.addLayer(wms);
~~~~~~~

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Web Client: layer visibility bug?
Message-ID: <20110614090440.GA14323@rigacci.org>

Hi to all,

May be there is a bug in the visibility checkbox (source code 
checkout 2011-05-19).

If a layer is at the top level of the project (i.e. outside of 
any group), it will be visible when ALL the visible checkboxes 
are off.

If you turn-on just one of the other layers, it will be correctly 
visible/unvisibile.

Or is it a feature?

If someone confirm it is a bug, I will open a ticket.

Here it is a demo (qgiswebclient code checkout 2011-05-19):

Hi again!

I have a QGIS project where a maplayer has the

It seems to me that the QGIS Web Client does not honour this tag 
and it will display the layer at any scale. Is it supposed to 
work?

 Hi Niccolo,

 The min/max scale are actually handled by QGIS server, not by the QGIS 
 web client. In my opinion/experience it seems to work.

 Maybe yet another problem with on-the-fly projection?

 Anyway, if it fails, it is probably a bug in QGIS or QGIS server, not 
 in QGIS webclient in this case. QGIS webclient does not deal with 
 min/max scales so far.

 Hi again,

 The layer-tree js code is a bit of a mess. It is patched and patched 
 from different sources. Unfortunately, Extjs does not provide a tree 
 widget with checkboxes that works out of the box ;-( So I am sure it 
 contains bugs. I have to admit that I do not fully understand the 
 js-code of the layertree. So if you know of a better ext component as a 
 replacement for the layer tree, please let me know.

 There is also a pending feature in QGIS server that should allow to 
 retrieve layer visibility from the GetCapabilities XML document, thus 
 eliminating the need to manually set layer visibility.

Thank you for your reply, I will investigate and give some

Wait wait wait :) In Lisbon we've decided to use the new repository for qgis 
2.0 only and to not include the new repository to the installer bundled with 
1.7. Are we changing the plans? If so, I can publish the installer update now 
or later. 

Anyway, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE plugins from the old repo in any case! :) Let's 
leave it for older Qgis (and installer) versions.

Correct:  better "copy" than "move" at this stage.

BTW, if nobody starts using the new plugin system we will never switch.

OK I did not understand this part of the code in the first place, now I

It's me there not being used to all the Python magic yet.

I was only mentioning the fact that there is now one part in a plugin, 
and one part in qgis core.
Could there be two plugins ? It will be more easy for others to give it 
a try.

This was my point : having a "two way" connection between those.

It was an error of mine: I manually edited the QGIS project, 
missing the "hasScaleBasedVisibilityFlag".

Now it seems that I have some bias between the scale displayed
by the Web Client and the scale computed by the QGIS Mapserver. 

Is there a way to let both have the same notion of pixel 
size?

 yeah - I saw that as well. The client uses OpenLayers to calculate the 
 scale. The QGIS Webclient tries to detect the dpi (there is a 
 dip-detection at the beginning of the intialization - I hope it works) 
 and forwards the dpi parameter to QGIS server. I don't know the 
 internals of OpenLayers and QGIS how they calculate their scales. I 
 checked the print outs from QGIS server - they seem to be on scale on 
 the printed paper. On screen it is always hard to verify ...

 You can open a bug report, but I can't promise that I can provide a 
 solution. Of course you are also welcome to investigate!

 Andreas

Hi Alessandro,

just copied verion 0.5 of my htmlimagemap-plugin into the new repo.

One thing I mention:

After uploading it was not shown in 'My plugins' immediatly, thought
something went wrong and tried to upload it again. But got the message
that there was already one ...
Doing a hard reload in browser (shift f5) shows it now for me..

So waiting for the judges no to approve it :-)
.. while writing, it was approved Whoopie!


Regards, and thanks for the hard work you did on the plugin repo!

Hi Richard,

we still have a strange cache issue... I'll try to solve it (it should
already be disabled for logged in users but something is not working as
expected).

You are now "trusted", you should be able to upload new plugins and have

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ellipse renderer
Message-ID: <201106141548.29243.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi QGIS devs

Recently, I was writing a symbollayer to render ellipse shapes (and also 
rectangles, triangles, crosses by specifying width and height). Moreover, the 
symbol layer allows to set all parameters (width, height, colors, rotation, 
outline with) from data fields, in mm or map units. 

The code is contained in my github clone int the branch 
'data_defined_symbollayer'. To give it a try, you can do the following:

git add remote add mhugent git://github.com/mhugent/Quantum-GIS.git
git checkout --track mhugent/data_defined_symbollayer

The reason it's in a branch is that data defined rendering in symbol layers 
needed some API changes. They are quite small:

- A pointer to the rendered QgsFeature* has been added to 
QgsSymbolV2RenderContext (such that the symbollayer has the possibility to 
check the data defined attribute values)

- A symbollayer has the possibility to specify which attribute fields it needs 
for rendering (by default, QgsSymbolLayerV2::usedAttributes returns an empty 
set).

- The symbollayer widgets receive a pointer to their vector layer. Normal 
symbol layer widgets don't use it, the widgets of  data defined symbol layers 
get the available fields through that pointer.

At first, I tried to achieve the data defined layer without API change by 
creating a new subclass of  QgsFeatureRendererV2 (as discussed with Martin in 
Lisbon. However, it turned out this approach would need a lot of duplication 
to provide graduated / unique / rule based classification and to provide a 
seamless  integration with the existing symbology(ng).

What do you think?

how do this work? It will allow to digitize that geometric shapes in the
canvas as we are used to draw points/lines/polygons?

Sorry, my git description does not work. It works with cloning my repository 
and checking out the branch (though there must be some magic to add the branch 
to a cloned main repository).

git clone git://github.com/mhugent/Quantum-GIS.git
cd Quantum-GIS
git checkout --track origin/data_defined_symbollayer

Thanks to everyone who helped me out with this - The original developer of
the rectangles plugin, Pavol Kapusta, along with Banjamin Bohard, have now
created 'Rectangles, Ovals and Diamonds'.

This does the job with perfection. Thank you Gentlemen!

Hi Rob,

this is just coincidence (maybe fluke :-) ), but your interest is 
encouraging.

My first version (few days ago) was very clumsy, but Benjamin Bohard 
added to the main function of plugin the right pythonic feel and look.

Pavol

Hi Marco

I realise I've been very slow to reply.  Thanks for the pointer to this .. I see that you are using the same approach, basically the group id is the index of the group name in the groupLayerRelationship() list.  

This seems to work, but from an API point of view it does seem very indirect.  I haven't looked at the underlying code but I'd have thought it better for groups to have a unique id in the same way as layers, and to be able to use this to assign layers (and other groups?) to groups.  Not something I have time to consider at the moment :-(

Thanks
Chris

Hi 
 
The repository looks good, but I couldn't upload the plugin - it failed with the message
 
    "File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed archive. Cannot find valid metadata in VectorFieldRenderer/__init__.py"

I suspect that this is because my __init__.py is structured as 

   from Plugin import Plugin

   def name():
       return Plugin.LongName
 
   ...

rather than just being specified as 

   def name():
       return "VectorFieldRenderer"

Is there a document which describes how a plugin needs to be coded to be uploadable to the repository? 

Also some while ago I proposed a convention of putting plugin documentation in an index.html file in the plugin directory (which is now supported by the showPluginHelp function in utils.py).  I wonder if it would be good provide access to this from the plugin repository (ie make it available for viewing if it is included in the zip file).

Also I'm wondering how to specify plugin tags?

Thanks
Chris

	Hi,
	
	please copy or move your plugins to the new site (we are actively working on the development of the new site) and file a ticket on http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues if you find any issue.
	
	Please notice that if you are not a staff or "trusted" user your plugins will not be immediately published and a notification email will be sent to all staff members.
	
	Once a staff member will flag you as "trusted" you will be able to publish your plugins.
	
	The new site also supports:
	
	* plugins icons
	* tags classification (will be available in QGIS desktop)
	* revisions (experimental  and stable)

Sorry I don't seem to get any email notifications so I didn't see your

I'll try to autofix it if I can figure out the rules of the road.

Hi guys,
I'm also interested. Some of my comments below.

I would prefer storing in the database, as it allows connectivity with
other applications and user cases that we cannot even think about.

>  * QGIS server should be made aware about table permissions 
>  (roles/groups) and build the GetCapabilities tree accordingly.
Here you seem to say: let's use the permissions of the db backend for
everything. I find this brilliant: there are plenty of tools to manage
those and the this is widely tested (which is important when security
matters). The positive side effect is that you can give direct database
access to some power users, and you still have to set the rights only
once.
My understanding is that this cannot work for SQLite (from the manual:
"the only access permissions that can be applied are the normal file
access permissions of the underlying operating system").
Second comment on this: Is the above idea about table permissions meant
only for vector data, or for PostGIS Raster? (not as widely tested).

What follows is: maybe this should be implemented only for a limited
number of RDBMS backends.
Anyway: Sure, SQLite is much easier for the desktop than Postgres
+postgis. Still, if you use https and can buy a certificate, then you
have the resources to configure Postgres+postgis.

May I ask what do you use for vector backend for QGIS server?

Hope this helps,

Mayeul

I haven't looked at the underlying code but I'd have thought it better for groups to have a unique id in the same way as layers, and to be able to use this to assign layers (and other groups?) to groups.  Not something I have time to consider at the moment :-(
I know, when I added the support for adding nested groups, I asked Marco

I don't think that authentication should be built into a WMS server. There are 
many solutions around, doing authentication and authorisation transparently on 
top of a WMS server:
* http://52north.org/communities/security/index.html
* http://geoprisma.org/site/index.php
* https://sites.google.com/site/geoshieldproject/home
* http://www.secureows.org/

Integration into QGIS Webclient will need some work, I suppose, but there 
should be no change in QGIS Server.

Pirmin

Ok, so let's make some decision :) If we are going to encourage authors to put 
new plugins to the new repo, I should update all old installer versions and 
actually we can move the existing plugins, instead of copying. I can see two 
possibilities only:

1. Make the new repo valid for both qgis 1.x and 2.x. I'll update installers 
in all qgises 1.x, so the authors can put updates to the new repo only and 
don't care about outdated plugins in the old one.

2. Keep the new repo for qgis 2.x only and maintain plugins for qgis 1.x in 
the old repository.

IMHO it doesn't make any sense to mix the two approaches and force authors to 
update their plugins in both repositories.

Yes, this is probably the reason.

For security reasons there is no "eval" on the python code, a simple regexp
is used instead to extract the strings from the __init__ file.

This is one of the docs:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Writing_Python_Plugins#__init__.py

while developing the new repo, some variations were introduced, like the
icon (IIRC this has been discussed on the list).

Tags were introduced in Lisbon, at this time, they are only editable through
the plugin web interface, there is currently no way to put them in the
__init__ and have them automatically imported in the repo.


Thanks for your feedback.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS MapServer and jQuery OpenLayer Client for
	Mobile Devices
Message-ID: <BANLkTin20nZhcD9sO9mHJghUTpYj8UM1Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The current QGIS  webclient is for PC (i.e. desktop, laptop, netbook).
I understand it is built using ExtJS, Geoexplorer hack.

http://projects.opengeo.org/geoext/wiki/GeoExplorer
http://blog.opengeo.org/2009/06/17/geoexplorer-preview/
http://suite.opengeo.org/geoexplorer/composer

I like to use QGIS Mapserver as server for Mobile Devices (i.e. iPad,
Android tablet, Meego tablet, HP WebOS tablet, etc) using jQuery, not
ExtJS (Sencha Touch) since I need local Spatialite support for these
devices.

Again, I like to use jQuery instead of ExtJS as webclient for QGIS Mapser.

Now, how can I utilise QGIS Mapserver for these mobile webclients?

Andreas, what would be the right access to WMS layer in QGIS Mapserver (WMS)?

~~~~~~~
var base = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
                "Medford Streets & Buildings",
                "/geoserver/wms",
                {layers: "medford"}
~~~~~~~~

http://workshops.opengeo.org/openlayers-intro/vector/style.html

Generic
~~~~~~~~
map = new OpenLayers.Map('map');
    var wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
    "OpenLayers WMS",
    "http://labs.metacarta.com/wms/vmap0",
        {layers: 'basic,ground_01'}
    );
~~~~~~~~
http://vasir.net/blog/openlayers/openlayers-tutorial-part-2-layers/

For example, this ZonePlan layer in http://gis.uster.ch/webgis/?

http://gis.uster.ch/webgis/production/index.shtml?map=/home/www/projekte/raumplanung/raumplanung.qgs&format=image/jpeg&visibleLayers=Gestaltungspl%C3%A4ne%20Beschriftung,Gemeindegrenze,Sondernutzungen,Sondernutzungen%20Bauzonen%20mit%20Gestaltungsplanpflicht,Differenzierte%20L%C3%A4rmempfindlichkeitsstufe,Nutzungszonen,UEP%20%282009%29

I just like to know the WMS layers, not the windowing ExtJS toolkit to
render the whole thing.

Thanks.

Thanks for this ... I'll recode the __init__.py to comply with this.

The stuff about the index.html is on the same wiki page you referenced (under documentation).  I'll look at filing a feature request for that.

Cheers
Chris

Hi

The repository looks good, but I couldn't upload the plugin - it failed with the message

   "File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed archive. Cannot find valid metadata in VectorFieldRenderer/__init__.py"

I suspect that this is because my __init__.py is structured as

  from Plugin import Plugin

  def name():
      return Plugin.LongName

  ...

rather than just being specified as

  def name():
      return "VectorFieldRenderer"


Yes, this is probably the reason.

For security reasons there is no "eval" on the python code, a simple regexp is used instead to extract the strings from the __init__ file.



Is there a document which describes how a plugin needs to be coded to be uploadable to the repository?



This is one of the docs: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Writing_Python_Plugins#__init__.py

while developing the new repo, some variations were introduced, like the icon (IIRC this has been discussed on the list).


Also some while ago I proposed a convention of putting plugin documentation in an index.html file in the plugin directory (which is now supported by the showPluginHelp function in utils.py).  I wonder if it would be good provide access to this from the plugin repository (ie make it available for viewing if it is included in the zip file).

Hi Pimin,

Yes, I have been working on it and I heavily modified even to support
Spatialite query and it is running in Xcode (i.e compile in Xcode iOS
4.2 to run local spatialite). I got the spatialite Geometry using
AsText / WKT but not display the WKT in OL yet.

I got all the base maps in it i.e. Cloudmade, Google, Bing, Yahoo,
Mapbox, ArcGISRest + the Edit (navigate, point, lines, polygons,
modify, drag).

Now,  Just lacking the QGIS Mapserver side as server:-).

 Hi Noli,

 QGIS server and QGIS webclient can be regarded as two separate 
 projects. While we try to integrate the two better, there is no reason 
 why you cannot develop something in parallel with a different framework.

 The reason why I went with ExtJS, GeoExt and OpenLayers is that there 
 is a community of governmental organizations around these frameworks in 
 Switzerland, where I work. This way we can share costs and knowledge.

 As to mobile frameworks the same group decided to sponsor OpenLayers to 
 improve mobile device support. This is now available as part of 
 OpenLayers 2.11. We decided that we will be using the Sencha framework 
 (instead of jquery mobile), because it is from the same 
 company/community like ExtJS and also GeoExt will most likely be using 
 the Sencha framework.

 I expect to start working on a mobile client in parallel to QGIS 
 webclient (we could name it QGIS mobile client) in autumn this year if 
 someone wants to join the effort.

 Regarding the WMS layer of gis.uster.ch: you should see all you need in 
 the GetCapabilities request listed at http://gis.uster.ch/ - it really 
 contains all the information you need to later issue GetMap, 
 GetFeatureInfo, GetLegendGraphic or GetPrint requests. Note that this is 
 a raster based WMS - it is not a WFS. Here is one link to a 
 GetCapbilities request: 
 http://gis.uster.ch/cgi/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/home/www/projekte/av/grundplan_av.qgs&service=WMS&Request=GetCapabilities

 Hope this helps,
 Andreas

Hi all

After some thinking and discussions, it seems to me integrating the 
authentication directly in QGIS server does not have the same flexibility 
compared to a component that sits between webserver and WMS. 

E.g. if there is a WFS integration into QGIS webclient (as we discussed in 
Lisbon), authentication inside the WMS does not help.

I'm not experienced with the software listed in Pirmins mail (e.g. if 
everything requires a Java server). If there is a lightweight component for 
access restriction, it could be an approach to bundle it together with QGIS 
server to make it easier for the user.


Regards,
Marco

For sure I will go for ExtJS, GeoExt and Openlayers for PC. No
question about that. In fact,
I like to use ExtJS or Sencha Touch in the mobile as well.

The only reason at the moment for I am using jQuery mobile is, I am
able to use Spatialite local server with DOM and WebKit in iOS device
(hopefully in Android, etc as well, Meego tablet is probably easier).
It is hybrid application. It is OL script is enclosed in an Native
app.

I could do the same with Sencha Touch but again no Spatialite or
Sqlite full support, just local web storage.

OK. I will help you on package it, making it a Native app in iOS,
Android and Meego.

Sencha touch - kitchen sink demo runs as a Native app in iOS SDK 4.3.
I am using iOS 4.2 at moment.

Ich habe keine anhung, how to use this. OK. I will look at it later on.

At the moment, I am concentrating in getting my WKT from Spatilalite
queries to render to OL. I have problem isolating the WKT data column
so I can pass it to textarea then to WKT passer for OL map render.

Thanks a lot.

Sounds quite reasonable to me (and yes, avoiding java would be a must).
So, if there are no different opinions, let's start selecting the best
sw among those listed by Pirmin.
All the best.

Ok, it works like this:

git fetch mhugent
git checkout --track mhugent/data_defined_symbollayer

Here it is my opinion about WMS access control (not only QGIS 
Mapserver). This is mainly to Giovanni Manghi, which has to solve 
the problem: I think you can choose between solution #1 (short 
term) and solution #3 (mid term).

Three different approaches:

1) Authentication and redirect by the web server: users with
different privileges will be redirected to different backends
(different QGIS projects, in QGIS Mapserver case). All the work
is to make different projects with different views of the data.

2) QGIS Mapserver will implement some sort of Access Control: it
will give diffferent results for the same project/query, based on
the authenticated user. This seems simple, but an alarm bell is
that no WMS server exists which do that (except for Geoserver,
but I did not investigated how).
This approach is hard: whe have a standard protocol (WMS) and we
want to add some out-of-standard features (Access Control). As
far as I understand UMN-MapServer developers have avoided this at
all, will QGIS Mapserver developers endorse it instead?
Is not so simple even to define what is access control: layer
access? Attribute access? Vector? Raster? Read/Write? All of this
will be buried intimately into the WMS code: I don't like it
very much.

3) A "proxy" approach can leave the WMS code intact: an http
proxy will receive the query, parses it, apply Access Control and
pass the (eventually modified) query to the WMS. The response
will be eventually modified (e.g. stripping data from the XML
GetCapabilities response) and passes it to the client.
The granularity of the Access Control will be very rude, because 
the WMS protocol has a rude query syntax (layer on/off, not much 
more), but proxying is the only "right" way to filter a protocol 
without rewriting it.

All the software cited by Pirim uses the third approach, as far I 
can understand.

Hello,
I am not sure I understand the question correctly, but:

Do none of the provided signals work for you, like
QMainWindow::destroyed() or QgsComposerView::finished() perhaps?
Or just QDialog::finished(int) in the case of the Layer Properties dialog?

You can get a pointer to those structures through QgsAppInterface, I
think. There is the activeComposers list, and, of course, the
mainWindow pointer.

Camilo

Most of security stuff is in Java :-(
Swisstopo plans to use 52north for securing their OGC services.

Belongs to the UMN MapServer "project stack".

But is in production use, AFAIK.

One advantage I didn't mention is that you delegate the in-depth security 
tests to these frameworks.

Hi,

I wrote a PYTHON plugin that does a simple feature select on a
QgsVectorLayer:

  pnt = <coordinates of mouse click on map >
  myLayer= <QgsVectorLayer Object>
  tolerance = 1
  rectangle = QgsRectangle()
  rectangle.setXMinimum (pnt.x() - tolerance)
  rectangle.setXMaximum (pnt.x() + tolerance)
  rectangle.setYMinimum (pnt.y() - tolerance)
  rectangle.setYMaximum (pnt.y() + tolerance)
  myLayer.select(rectangle , True)

in QGIS 1.6 this code works with both shapefiles and postgis layers,
in QGIS 1.7 it works ONLY in postgis layers, on shapefile layers it always
returns 0 features.

Pirmin.

Thanks a lot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
var wms = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
  "WMS",
  "http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi",
  {
  'map': '/usr/local/share/qgis/QGIS-NaturalEarth-Example.qgs',
  'layers':'HYP_50M_SR_W,10m_lakes,10m_rivers_lake_centerline'} );
map.addLayer(wms);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I hope we can have 1 live QGIS Mapserver running even just to serve
the above example.

Probably we can ask OSGeo to sponsor WMS QGIS Mapserver running in
OSGeo host network.

Thanks.

Noli

Hi all.

This Bug is partial solved. The fact that a similar problem in the measuring angles tool (corrected only tool of measurement of distances and areas). Look at call QgsMapToolMeasureAngle::configureDistanceArea() in QgsMapToolMeastureAngle::canvasMouseMove() [1]

I've added comments [2] and path [3], but there was no response. Must I create a new issue or copy #3866?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Python console idea: Expanding the Python
 console to handle DSLs for plugins eg CADTools
Message-ID: <BANLkTikW5qOJ=jdeMaBHnb905yJz64hugg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I had a idea today that I would like to get peoples feedback on.  I have
drafted up some code and  wiki on github to keep it all together.

Link: https://github.com/madmanwoo/Custom-QGIS-Python-hooks-idea
Wiki: https://github.com/madmanwoo/Custom-QGIS-Python-hooks-idea/wiki

The general idea is handling custom commands (DSLs) from plugins but in the
python console to save on plugins having to reinvent the console dock just
have a simple command line style interface.  Have a look at my github repo
and wiki above I think you will get the idea pretty quick.
 The default action for the Python console is still running Python commands
unless told otherwise.

I would appreciated any feedback anyone has.  I'm not a python expert so the
code could be done better if done for real but at the moment it's just rough
to get the idea out there.

Regards,
Nathan Woodrow

I'd like to 'second' this observation. No matter what combination of
PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc I try, I can't seem to get this
working either. I'm forwarding this thread to the developers mailing
list as well. Any suggestions? I've never had this problem before,
though I'm sure its something I'm doing :-p

Carson

#####################################################

Hello,

I know this problem has been discussed many times, but the usual
remedies are not working.

First I run the following commands from the shell:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qgis/lib
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/qgis/share/qgis/python


Then I run the following program:

from qgis.core import *

qgis_prefix = '/usr/local/qgis/'

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('/usr/local/qgis/', True)
QgsApplication.initQgis()

vlayer=QgsVectorLayer('./tl_2009_09001_faces.shp','tl_2009_09001_faces','ogr')
print vlayer.isValid()


I get the error message "Failed to load".

I am using the 1.18 debian packages. ?It works fine if I run these
commands from the python console in qgis. ?Any suggestions? ?Thanks.

Hi Marco

I would be happy to look at and discuss the changes, but I will not be
able to do so until the end of June.

I am wondering whether it would not be possible to abstract the
functionality of simple / categorized / graduated renderers into some
reusable code and thus keeping the symbol layers simple...

Hi Carson, I had a similar problem but launching qgis (I still have to 
start it by using a script) and solved it by doing:

LIBUTIL=$(locate -r libutil.so$)
LD_PRELOAD=$LIBUTIL #use locate libutil to find the path
export LD_PRELOAD

maybe it helps (was suggested in this list a while ago).

BTW anybody has an idea why this would happen?

ciao
Marco

 I like the idea of supplying console functionality for plugins.

 I don't like the idea of piggybacking via "PREFIX: foo" syntax onto Python.

 People might think they can mix python variables with variables in
other DSLs. Which would be tricky.

 What might be nice would be if the Python console could exist in a
tabbed window, and plugins could have an 'open console' option, which
would add a tab to the python console. This would provide standard
console functionality and then feed the lines to a handler registered
by the plugin.

 Maybe you could even have seventeen python console tabs open at once
next to four SQL command tabs and one interface to the QGIS API
written in perl?

That sounds like a pretty good idea too.  Shoudn't be too hard to whip up a
prototype for that.

Message-ID: <BANLkTinkqOW_MgmG_3ehudqQ6mwcYP2Jsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've fixed a couple of bugs and added email notifications on plugins
approval and user trust/untrust.

I noticed that in the list views like http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ there
is no space for all that columns given the current table layout, any hint ?

The problem becomes evident only if you are logged in, since you will see an
additional "Manage" column at the end.

I was thinking about removing the "Featured" column and maybe changing
"Downloads" to something shorter ("Dl" ?).

Suggestions welcome!

Thanks.

How about Icons with hover over tooltips, ex a down arrow for downloads?

Suggestions:
-Contract Approved, Featured, downloads in "A", "F", "D"-Delete "Date" and leave "Last Modified"-change dates to short format: "01/01/11"-put the description in the same color of the title.

Regards,
Pablo.

You may want to look at the IPython console---they have a very nice
syntax for adding new domain-specific commands which they call "magic
commands":

    http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/reference.html#magic-command-system

For example, say you want to run a Python function as a command:

    def say_hello(self, arg):
      print("Hello, world!")

    # Grab a hook to the currently running IPython instance:
    import IPython.ipapi
    ip = IPython.ipapi.get()

    # Register a new magic function:
    ip.expose_magic("hello", say_hello)


Users can they run magic commands directly at the console level using
a "%command" syntax:

In [1]: %hello
Hello, world!


IPython 0.11 is scheduled to be released at the end of this month and
has a slightly different api for registering new magic functions:

    # Grab a hook to the currently running IPython instance
    ip = get_ipython()

    # Register a new magic function
    ip.define_magic("hello", say_hello)


I have always thought IPython would be a good replacement for the
current QGIS console as it has a lot of features such as
tab-completion, inline help and interactive object inspection that
saves users a lot of running back and forth between manual pages and
their workspace. The 0.11 version even has a frontend that is built in
PyQt which would make it easy to integrate into QGIS as a plugin.
IPython 0.11 also provides a parallel and distributed computing
framework that could have very interesting applications for GIS
algorithms. I was even working on such a plugin a couple of months
ago.

Unfortunately I had to shelve the project as IPython decided to
migrate to Version 2 of the SIP API in order to be compatible with
PySide as well as PyQt and to be compatible with the rest of the
Enthought tools for scientific computing in Python. QGIS uses Version
1 of the SIP API which is incompatible with Version 2. QGIS could
migrate to Version 2, but all plugins that use QString or QVariant in
their Python code would need to replace these with plain Python
strings and objects as the QString and QVariant classes are no longer
needed or defined with the Version 2 API.

Migrating QGIS to the latest version of the SIP API might be a good
idea in the long run as I think it may have better support for Python
3.  Some of the issues were discussed when PySide decided which API to
support:

Currently Ipython is not compatible with any programe importing Qt stuff. It is 
related to the way they manage threads if I remember well. But everything I 
read regarding this issue lead to a deadend.
So you would have to run it outside of QGIS main program, which in turns leads 
to more issues.
If someone has got some hints about this, they are welcome !

Well would that be such a bad thing? The DSLs can return a object from the
evaluated string so why not let them be mixed.  This would mean you can do
things like:

mypythonVar = (SQL:Select Sum(column) From Table)
#Some more python code to assign the value to a QgsFeature


Just a thought.

Hi all.
OSGeo is currently unable to provide polling facilities. I would like to avoid qgis
and grass websites, not to bias the results, and woldn't like too much to use an
external service: any better idea?
All the best.

 Oh I didnt say it was bad, just tricky! Done right it would be good -
Python in Qgis is getting variable values from C++ all the time.

 For example, someone might think they can do:

 > foo = 1 + 2 # python
 > SQL: select * from table where x=foo

In fact, I'd be quite frustrated if I couldn't do that in a single
console. So to implement this, you've got to have some way of getting
variables from one interpreter into another, so you might end up with:

 > SQL: select * from table where x=PYTHON:foo

but now you are parsing everything before it gets to the destination
parser, but that could be ambiguous with the destination language. So
then the console becomes a macro language all of its own...

why not allow the user to force the contents of the console with a python mode 
and other one called DSL via a checkbox or a combo box?

Hi devs,
I'm going to copy Faunalia's plugins to the new plugins site, but in this
moment
I cannot do it because once I upload them the site displays that I'm the
author.

Why don't change it from Author to Maintainer?
So who upload a plugin become its maintainer and not its author.

I think would be good to distinguish between these 2 roles.

What's your opinion?
Cheers.

After a bit more research, I would vote for this one.

Dear all,
I'm not sure where I should have posted my problem, but I can't get

I'm not a developer, but I think I should still be able to get it to work -
but at the moment I've run out of ideas and would really appreciate it if
someone could at least point me into the right direction. Or tell me what
information is needed in order to help. 

thanks for any ideas,

We have also seen the same error occasionally, but I could not track it down, as I do
not have Windows.
Please install qgis 1.7 (to be released really soon) and see if it has been solved.
All the bets.

Barry,

I think it could be a pretty powerful and cool thing to at least try out
with the prototype.   I'm a ex MapInfo user and in MapBasic we were able to
call a user defined function in SQL for a update, insert, etc etc.   So you
could do:

Function MyFunction(someStringVar) as String
   Return "Foo Bar " + someStringVar
End Function

And then in the SQL statement.

UPDATE table SET column = MyFunction("Hello World") where column > 100

This would call MyFunction() for each feature and call a update.  However
one shortfall of this is that you couldn't define functions in the
interactive Mapbasic shell inside MapInfo, meaning that you had to write a
custom script just to do the above.

If we could do something like this in the python console and pass functions
and variables to custom DSLs I think it would be quite handy.  Of course the
DSL would have to know how to handle the variables or it would just return a
error.

I know it might not be a easy thing to do but I'm willing to give it a go in
my prototype to flesh it out.

Like you said we should just have to find way to say "this is a python
variable" and "this is part of the string to send to the DSL".   You might
be able to use something like %%variableName or %%functionName. The console
would parse the string that goes to the DSL and build a dictionary with
%%variableName = realPythonVariable and then sends the string and the
dictionary to the DSL which at that point it's up it to worry about
evaluating and replacing the values and functions.

Thoughts?

 Yes, but I think once you get beyond three-liners you are going to
want to save these things in a file anyway. In python you'd just stuck
them in a .py file and import them. I don't really see typing at the
console as a good place for doing program development to any great
amount.

Yup, if you restrict yourself to putting python variable values into
other languages then that's a possibility. Not sure how you'll be
evaluating python functions with SQL variable argument though? Are you
expecting to be able to do:

 import math
 SQL: select years,months from foo where years > %%math.sqrt(months)

 - since that would mean getting SQL values (months) passed to Python...

 Even simple replacement of python variables us going to be tricky
since python variables can evaluate to all sorts of things - are you
just going to use the 'str' representation?

 A nice list of use cases would be interesting.

 Of course if you are willing to develop this then you can do what you
want :) There doesn't seem to be a lot of interest from the devs...

Hi

I think it is fine to introduce API changes as long as you don't need
your changes to enter into the 1.7.x releases. We are going to break
API with remove of old symbology and old labelling and deprecated API
elements anyway so if there ever was a good time to break (hopefully
with improvements) API it would seem to me this is it.

Regards

Tim

This week the Framework's design saw many changes. Julien has started
to experiment with interfacing it to the Orfeo Toolbox, and from the
ensuing discussion the conclusions of creating a separate plugin for
the framwork's gui, sort of a "module manager", now called
processingplugin and removing some unnecessary classes were drawn.
These things were implemented.
Also, a model-view interface will be used for the module list.

Some bugs were also fixed. A few new parameter types introduced.
(String, Boolean, Choice). The UI has imporved a bit.

Apropos, no screenshot this week, but, the good news is you can see
for yourself how it is coming along, since the **very experimental**
plugins are now available through the faunalia.it repo[1]. Note that
you have to install "processingplugin" for the SAGA plugin to work.
Many thanks to Giuseppe & Paolo for their help.

Any comments welcome!

Next week I hope to catch up with validators, and move the module list
to model-view.

As always, past reports are available at the project's wiki.[2]

Camilo

Hi,
after the long discussion when we clarified how to manage URIs well, I
have enabled drag-and-drop from QBrowser to QGIS using the 1) minimal
solution, because of total lack of time. I take the ideas still into
account and I'll return to that later. The feature seems to me quite
important and useful to wait too long for QgsDataSourceURI etc.
Current implementation is quite simple and does not introduce any API
which should have been changed in future.

You can drag layers from QBrowser to QGIS legend except WMS, because
it still does not support encoding all data in URI. There can be a
little difference in default layer labels between d'n'd and standard
dialog, because d'n'd is using QgsDataItem::name() and standard
dialogs may use a different name.

If I get time today I'll try to add also WMS.

Message-ID: <7139021A-88FE-4E45-BD3A-475FC107640C@westnet.com.au>

Hello all (developers and non-developers both),
Consider this a reaction to "have you considered sponsoring development". From a non-developer. Who is still trying to understand how the sponsoring development idea works.

It is likely to be a bit long. If you have time, I'd appreciate it if you could read and comment on the long version. If not, this is a short version:
1. For me it would be easier to sponsor development, if I knew what it would cost.
2. Numbers of people are asking for the same features, and numbers of people are saying they're small and can't afford development.

I've had a bit of a conversation with Paolo, and now realise that 1. is a chicken and egg situation, and hence awkward, but 2. could be helped by making groups of people who want a feature to sponsor it.

So I'm wondering, from those who've had experience;
a.) how does one get around, the "I'd like a cost estimate but the cost estimate takes time and about half the work" problem?
b.) has anyone tried putting groups of sponsors together? If so, how did it go?




----
This is the long version. 
It's mostly what I'd been through with Paolo, but expanded a bit more so my thought process is (hopefully) a bit clearer.[*]

I'm attached to one of the many small companies that make use of QGIS. I had thought that it would be good to provide support to QGIS, and I had been thinking in the form of sponsoring development to go after either a few annoying bugs or one or two features that I'd like. While I was thinking about this a few thoughts occurred.
1. For me, and I suspect many others, it would be very useful to be able to go my boss and say, "I'd like us to support QGIS develop <a useful feature>, and it will cost this much." ie, have a good estimate.[!]
2. I'm also noticing;
  a. a number of features have been requested by a number of different people. A good example of this is multi-column legends in the composer.[@]
  b. a number of different people have (essentially) said, "we're really small and can't afford to sponsor development."

I remember reading on one of the QGIS lists that many feature developments were not as expensive as most people thought, I recall ?2-300 being mentioned.[#]

Somehow I've put these together and bits together and realised that if there were 10 users who wanted <a useful feature> then suddenly they only need to provide ?20-30, which is much more manageable.

I've asked Paolo for some thoughts and Paolo pointed out that:
3. There have previously been problems with payment after the development was done, and
4. To get a really good estimate, this often costs about half the total cost of the project so they may unwilling to work through to that point with out some certainty of payment.

----
So from my non-developer stand point this makes 1. and 4. a problem. But for the purposes of going forward, there are two ways of short-circuiting this that might work:
5. Developer takes initiative - to attract development, features wanting sponsorship get worked to a point where an estimate of total cost can be made. (Probably not viable - see [%])
6. Users take initiative - For the purposes of getting a group of sponsors running, start with an assumed cost, which can be refined later. 


So, from the User Initiative end (6.) a work-flow might work like this:
7. A feature is nominated for work. A bunch of people that want that feature get together and work out the following:
  a. A minimal set of things the feature must do.
  b. A nominated lead for the group.
  c. A contribution that each member of the group makes, based on an assumed cost. (Say ?300). 
  d. Decide on what to do if the development cost more than expected.
  e. Decide on what to do if the development costs less than expected.

8. Find a willing developer.
  a. Sound developer out on scope, and adjust according to what is actually achievable.

9. Once, we have developer available and willing, then each member of the group contributes at least half of their total commitment to a nominated place. No development until money in bank.
  So, hypothetically, if there was a group with 10 members and a ?300 project, then each contributes ?15 now. This should be enough to make people feel committed to seeing something out of the development.

10. From there, the group would need to be able to see progress. In my industry it is normal to see weekly status reports from contractors doing projects over more than a couple of weeks, and I'd like to see that happen. Nothing fancy, just "this is what I did this week, this is what I'm going to do next week, this is what's left to do," style of thing.

11. Then I suppose the group would need something they could test.


----
If we can get to a point where there's a process that people thing might work, then yes, I'm prepared to help trial it.

Any thoughts?
Particularly I'm curious if there are thoughts on:
1. Getting around the "a cost estimate makes it easier for me to get funds" against "a good cost estimate is most of the work" problem.
2. Viability of this idea.
3. Thoughts on managing groups of sponsors.

______
[*] For the record, I was asking for advice, and we rapidly got to the point where it was getting complex (as you can see) and Paolo suggested that it be brought out on the the mailing list. Please don't think that this is a final-ish suggestion.
[!] In my industry a good estimate is within about 10%. So, I'm not expecting dollar perfect.
[@] I had heard that some of the Swiss users might be getting together on this one, so this is just an example. On that thought, big swiss users or little swiss users?
[#] but I can't find it, so I could be hallucinating. Either way, I'll run with these numbers.
[%] Yes I do know there are a limited number of developers, who are already over-loaded. If this way did happen, then the cost estimate would include work to the point of estimate, work to finish (and I think it would also be reasonable to include an "I'm taking the initiative" fee here too).

Just a quick thought, which is sort of based on the 'groupon' concept
that appears to be quite popular at the moment:

Say a user/group/company wants a feature/bug fix/whatever; they could
nominate this work on the QGIS website, where developers could take a
look (perhaps there could also be an automated email to the developers
list or a separate list so developers don't have to manually check the
page all the time). If a developer decided it was something they might
like to work on, they could provide an estimate of cost, including the
cost of a proper estimate. This would then be added to the nominated
task on the website, and would open up the task for 'bidding', such
that any similarly interested groups could offer up as much as they
were wiling to offer (perhaps some minimum here could be established).
Eventually, if the task was popular enough, the suggested cost would
be reached, and at that stage the developer could begin development.
If the minimum cost was not reached (perhaps within a certain time
limit), then the task would be dropped from the page, and all parties
who had initially 'bid' on the task would get their 'bid' back. This
whole process is then quite open and transparent, and if users see
that a task it close to reaching the desired cost, they might be more
inclined to put forward that final bid to get it started!
This suggestion still doesn't really address the issue of an initial
estimate, but perhaps the initial estimate cost could be shouldered by
the original nominating group/user?

Just a thought,

Carson

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Developing a custom PyQGIS desktop application
Message-ID: <1308403153675-6490724.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi All,

First, I'd like to thank all those who have contributed to the QGIS
application.  It is a wonderful piece of work, and besides my personal use,
we have recently used it in a course to help high school teachers teach
their students GIS.

I have been investigating whether it is feasible for me to create a PyQGIS
desktop application to serve as a "scenario builder" for an environmental
computer modeling program.  There is grant money available to create this
application, and I would really like to do it and make the code available to
others when it is finished.  

I managed to use the available documentation to create a main window and
load some layers.  I also was able to integrate the GeoTux layer list widget
into the application.  I thought these were very impressive results for such
a relatively short investment of my time.  Next, I tried to create a
"select" tool using QgsMapToolEmitPoint.  I created a "select" button and
successfully activated the tool, but the connect function doesn't seem to
emit the point or call the slot.  Here is some sample code:

def printHello(p):
    z = PyQt4.QtGui.QMessageBox()
    z.setText('hello')
    z.show()

emitPoint = qgis.gui.QgsMapToolEmitPoint(w.canvas)
w.canvas.setMapTool(emitPoint)
w.connect(emitPoint, PyQt4.QtCore.SIGNAL("canvasClicked(QgsPoint)"),
printHello)

I've done a Google search and searched this list's archives and tried many
variations of the above with no success.  Any help on this particular
problem would be appreciated.  It is making me wonder if creating this
application in a reasonable time (i.e. 6 months) is feasible.

Also:

(1) would anyone be interested in collaborating on developing this
application?
(2) I have looked for existing PyQGIS custom applications without success. 
Do any exist?
(3) Does anyone have suggestions for how best to proceed (i.e. is there a
good book on the QGIS and QT APIs?)

Thanks all!
Bob

Hello,

Some clues

(2) I have looked for existing PyQGIS custom applications without success.
Do any exist?
>> Quantum navigator http://www.mapserver.sk/~wonder/qnavigator/
>> OpenOceanMap https://launchpad.net/openoceanmap
The two examples are listed from the "Desktop GIS" book (see below for
reference)

(3) Does anyone have suggestions for how best to proceed (i.e. is there a
good book on the QGIS and QT APIs?)
>> Desktop GIS: Mapping the Planet with Open Source Tools
http://pragprog.com/titles/gsdgis/desktop-gis
Some infos about Qgis plugin programming (some pages about, see table of
contents to make choice)

Hi Bob,Here is an working connection that I use in one of my plugins:

self.point=gui.QgsMapToolEmitPoint(self.canvas)QObject.connect(self.point, SIGNAL("canvasClicked(const QgsPoint &,Qt::MouseButton)"), self.export)

Pay attention to "canvasClicked(const QgsPoint &,Qt::MouseButton)" it has to be exactly like that otherwise you will get no signal.
Regards,
Pablo.

hi all, i remember having coming across a website where you could say "i
pledge to give x money if other x peoples do the same". Unfortunately i
can't remember the url, but it might be an idea to solve the cost sharing
problem.

I think most people (including myself) prefer to go the other way round:
adding functionalities to QGIS through plugins, rather then building ad
hoc apps.
All the best.

Yes, we have sent the links to a couple of services for this. We also
had a moderately successful initiative:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Bugs
The problems are IMHO:
- the cost for the estimate (it is sometimes cheaper to do the job than
to do the estimate)
- the administrative work for this (for very simple fixes, taking care
of payments and infrastructure can be heavier, and more boring, than the
fix itself)
- the reliability: we had (just one case) people promising money for a
fix, that was done quickly and effectively, and never paid.
Having said that, I agree that finding a simple and effective solution
for this would be important for the future of QGIS.
All the best.

Hi Ramon.
I appreciate your thoughts; the proposed route seems to me rather
complex to implement, but if you think you can manage it, I do not see
anybody stopping you.
Let's work out a modus operandi.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 1.7.0, the next in
our development release series. This release contains new features and
extends the programmatic interface over QGIS 1.0.x and QGIS 1.6.0. As
with any software, there may be bugs and issues that we were not able
to fix in time for the release. We therefore recommend that you test
this version before rolling it out en-masse to your users. You can
find a list of hightlighted changes and new features listed on the
detailed release announcement available here:

http://qgis.org/component/content/article/127-qgis-1-7-release.html

Binary and source code packages are available at:

http://download.qgis.org

If there is not yet a package for your platform on the above page,
please check back regularly as packagers are still pushing out their
work and they will update the download page to reflect the new
packages. Along with the release of QGIS 1.7.0, the QGIS Community
Team is hard at work on an updated QGIS Users' Guide version 1.7.0.
The guide will be available in the near future - we will post
announcements when it is available.

QGIS is a completely volunteer driven project, and is the work of a
dedicated team of developers, documenters and supporters. We extend
our thanks and gratitude for the many, many hours people have
contributed to make this release happen. We would also like to thank
our sponsors and donors for helping to promote our work through their
financial contributions. A current list of sponsors and donors can be
seen here:

http://qgis.org/en/sponsorship/sponsors.html
http://qgis.org/en/sponsorship/donors.html

If you would like to make a donation or sponsor our project, please
visit http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html . QGIS is Free software
and you are under no obligation to do so.

Happy QGIS'ing!

Message-ID: <0201C1BBF66143739A13C2AEB9C50173@amd64x2>

Sorry - this is a long post!
This discussion so far has focused primarily on the QGIS developers'
viewpoint, but I think it may be worth considering the situation from the
perspective of those with the money. There seem to be (at least) four major
groups that could help, each with their own agendas/motivators.
1) National and governmental. These organisations potentially have access to
very large amounts of money with decisions being driven (probably) by a mix
of political agenda and perceived national benefit. I think money from this
group (if gained) would be in relatively large amounts (in the UK, projects
would be unlikely to be less than ?10k and could lead to much larger
amounts), with quite broad targets and little or no day to day overseeing.
To get such money I think we need to have increased use of GIS seen as
important to national success and QGIS perceived as the best solution to
support. Not only do we want to encourage use of QGIS directly but also we
need to publicise it wherever possible and try to get it added to government
software lists.
2) Medium to large organisations. These organisations typically will have a
specific and (hopefully) well-defined requirement and would see the
developers as external consultants. The solution could possibly be at two
levels with QGIS consultants helping deliver overall solutions that have
additional work sub-contracted within the developer group.
Typically, before any formal quote is requested, someone would be asked for
an order of magnitude estimate of likely cost and timescales. I've spent
decades on both sides of this fence working as a consultant and managing a
variety of sub-contract projects - if someone cannot quickly answer the
basic questions at this stage (availability of competent people, range of
daily rates, complexity and risk/uncertainty, very rough estimate of likely
effort required) then the project dies at birth.
The next stage would be a formal specification and quotation phase, neither
of which should be overly complex. If there is a lot of uncertainty, I've
usually run a small pre-project to remove the uncertainty and reduce
development risks.
3) Small organisations and individual users. These people generally have
little money... but there are lots of them. The main voluntary payments that
they make are to charities so, while not going as far as suggesting that
QGIS become a registered charity, could we try to convince people to make
small regular payments? 1,000 people giving ?50 each on average per year
would pay for a useful amount of bug fixing etc.
4) Current and potential developers. Developers put a lot of their time and
often personal money into QGIS. The easier it is for new developers to
contribute, the more everyone benefits. Can we make it easier for potential
new developers to get started? Could we have an OSGeo4 type of installer to
create a working development environment for plugins and/or trunk? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Group (1) needs marketing effort. Pete Wells, Saber Razmjooei (both Faunalia
UK) and I have been doing this in the UK with Ordnance Survey, national and
local government for about three months and progress is looking promising. 
Group (2) is also part of our marketing, but there is a clear problem in
that even the first "order of magnitude cost" question would be difficult to
answer... although in reality I would come up with a number based on what I
know of QGIS and lots of years making educated guesses.
Group (3) we could have gentle encouragement to make payments... but it must
be easy! My experience making a donation for hackfest was that it was hard
work and has resulted in a rash of Italian spam. We would need foolproof way
to make local currency payments including by cheque.
And finally, don't forget the documentation. User manuals and tutorials are
as much part of "selling" QGIS to users as its functionality.

As you probably noticed, I sent out the release announcement for 1.7.
If you have made packages, please update the download page accordingly
to reflect the latest page.

I will start planning 1.7.1 now :-)

Did you get a chance to try a Windows build on my fork?  I realize you've probably been busy with 1.7 release stuff ;)

Actually we just announced a new release today so you may want to
visit the download page to get that. Either way, try right clicking on
the installer and choose 'install as administrator' or similar.

Is there you have any updated download numbers available for qgis 1.6 ?

I'm writing a french article about qgis 1.7 and it is always good to 
boast a little about our gigormous userbase :)

I wrote some thoughts on funding here:

It would be really nice to find some benefactor to sponsor the project
as a whole for the unglamarous stuff as mentioned in the above
article) too.

I just did some long-overdue catching up on my webserver logs.  I can put together counts of OS X downloads if you like.

 HI Pedro,

 Are you sure this is really a problem? Any special reasons why QGIS 
 server should refuse to deliver GetMap when the version parameter is 
 omitted? Are there any interoperability problems with it?

 To me it seems that QGIS server is just more tolerant here - and I 
 personally do not care. But there may be reasons that I am unaware of.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Request: WFS Add Layer Plugin enhancement
Message-ID: <BANLkTinu1ja=kRjCv0AMMZ9RtP-kNUtmCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

First of all congratulations on the release of QGIS 1.7.0.

I just finished a whole week with 50 state and federal agencies using QGIS
trunk to show the current state of fundamental gis data which we are
developing. An unexpected and consensus comment was that QGIS was so much
easier to use than mapinfo and the like. Note that this was not a QGIS
training. I merely used QGIS to view the various layers we had in geoserver
through wfs. The release of QGIS 1.7.0 is timely.

One comment we had was that when a layer was added using the wfs add layer
plugin, the *name *of the layer appears in the layers panel rather than the
*title *which they used to search for particular layers in the plugin
dialog. Our layer names are rather cryptic, using feature codes. Once
several layers are loaded into QGIS, it is very difficult to distinguish
from one layer and another.

Would it be possible to show the title of the layer rather than the name,
perhaps as an option? This goes the same for the wms add layer. I know we
can rename the layers in the panel but this gets rather tedious.

Thanks in advance for your consideration. If this requires funding, please
let me know.

*Hilmy*

Good. Here Archlinux has seen the release package for 1.7.0. However, I am  
going to have a presentation on using QGIS GRASS plugin for my classmates  
tomorrow. So I decide to delay the upgrading for the concerning about  
integration of QGIS and GRASS.

That means I will see the perfect QGIS 1.7 after days. Excited!

Hello Andreas,

For me, as a user, this is even good! However, as the standard states that the VERSION parameter is required, I thought this could be a server glitch.

Like you, at first sight, this does not seem a problem to me, quite the opposite, but there may be some inconvenience, since it does not conform to the standard.

Best regards,
Pedro

HI Pedro,

Are you sure this is really a problem? Any special reasons why QGIS server should refuse to deliver GetMap when the version parameter is omitted? Are there any interoperability problems with it?

To me it seems that QGIS server is just more tolerant here - and I personally do not care. But there may be reasons that I am unaware of.

Hi Pedro

QGIS server is intentionally more tolerant than the standard. Because it 
officially supports version 1.3. However, most clients use 1.1.1 or even a 
different version. Therefore, QGIS server replies to all versions (with a few 
slight changes if 1.1.1). In general, this works well. 

With a strict version check, most clients would just see a 'version not 
supported' exception.

Regards,
Marco

Hello Marco,

Yes, this way it becomes much more practical and easy! Actually, I noticed this detail because I was adding a layer served by QGISMapserver in another mapfile using Mapserver v. <6.0, with wms_server_version1.3.0, and gave error because MapServer does not support WMS 1.3.0 (maybe version 6.0 already supports, I have not checked yet). Just put the wms_server_version1.1.1 to work perfectly!



Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python - recreate the exact Legend in a QTreeWidget
Message-ID: <BANLkTikEd5k35t36=zjheU+x_LBAxkhBBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I am a bit stuck here....
I would like to recreate the complete legend tree inside a python plugin. I
have chosen to use a QtreeWidget to do so.

Imagine I have:
*****************
group 0 (empty)

group 1
|-- group 11
   |-- layer 11a
   |-- layer 11b
|-- layer 1a

layer a

group 2
|-- group 21
|-- layer 2a
***********************

I have seen the

iface.legendInterface().groupLayerRelationship()

returns usefull information, but in a flat "C-style" way like :


[
  ['group 0', [] ],
  ['group 1', ['group 11', 'layer_1a_10020100526085601790'] ],
  ['', ['layer_a_20110617181245226'] ],
  ['group 2', ['groupe21', 'layer_2a_20110616121558434'] ],
  ['group 11', ['layer_11a_20100526085601799',
'layer_11b_gen20100526100356932'] ],
  ['groupe21', []]
]


I would like to loop though this result and create my own hierarchical
representation such as :
[
    'name' : 'group 0' , 'type' : 'group', 'children' : [],
    'name' : 'group 1' , 'type' : 'group', 'children' : [
        'name' : 'group 11' , 'type' : 'group', 'children' : [
            'name' : 'layer 11a' , 'type' : 'layer', 'children' : [],
            'name' : 'layer 11b' , 'type' : 'layer', 'children' : []
        ],
        'name' : 'layer 1a' , 'type' : 'layer', 'children' : []
    ],
    'name' : 'layer a' , 'type' : 'layer', 'children' : [],
    'name' : 'group 2' , 'type' : 'group', 'children' : [
        'name' : 'group 21' , 'type' : 'group', 'children' : [],
        'name' : 'layer 2a' , 'type' : 'layer', 'children' : []
    ]
]

I have tried hard since yesterday, but have not succeeded... Has anyone
already encoutered this need ?

Thanks in advance,
kimaidou

Hi,

it's possible! Take a look at [1] (in Spanish). I have also implemented that
in the pgAdmin's PostGIS viewer [2] (in English), where you can find a zip
file [3] with the code. Basically you need to expose your application's
functionality through a QgisInterface class. I've created another class
called Plugins to read and load existing plugins from a specific directory.

Regards,

Germ?n

However, upon launching 1.7, I get the following error message:

 

"Qgis.exe - Entry Point Not Found

 

The procedure entry point

?append2@QListData@@QAEPAPAXABU1@@Z could not be located in

the dynamic link library QtCore4.dll."

 

I have tried copying bin\QtCore4.dll to the system32 directory, without
success. Does anyone have any suggestions?

 

Cheers,

 

Rob

You should remove all Qt libraries vom system32 or replace all of them - but I
wouldn't recommend the latter.

Confirming. I have another plugin that simulates the Move Vertex C++ code
in Python, and when it invokes rubberBand.movePoint(), QGIS 1.7 crashes.

On QGIS 1.6 this doesn't happen.

Hi all

I managed to reconstruct my legend in my QTreeWidget by using a dictionary
to store the item I have already added in the tree while looping through
groupLayerRelationship !

Hi Jurgen,

 

I did not receive your original e-mail unfortunately, but saw it in the
digest.

 

Your suggestion worked! Copied all qt*.dll files from \Quantum GIS
Wroclaw\bin to Windows\system32\

 

Many thanks for your help. 

 

Perhaps this could be added to the downloads page or FAQs to assist others?

 

Regards,

 

Rob

I would search all system folders for other instances of QtCore4.dll.
You may find something in \Windows.

Message-ID: <1308574785.2375.92.camel@fox>

Hi all.
In recent versions of QGIS, EPSG:3003 have the +towgs parameters, which
IMHO should be absent (that's why we added the 40000 non-standard
projection). I guess this derived from this:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/42831e606737997d1de91003a4fc2e2e34dbc8bb#resources/srs.db
Anyone has a clear view of why this was added?
Thanks.

I would say you have some other directory in your system path that holds other qt dll's.

In the past I have moved System32 qt dll's to the application's directory, but you have to know which application copied them there in the first place during installation.

Ok sorry - idiot factor at work here - I had renamed my c:\osgeo4w dir
for testing my installer and forgot to move it back to its proper
place. Now I get this:

CMake Error at C:/Program Files/CMake
2.8/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:1225 (MESSAGE):
  Qt qmake not found!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] change to new symbology and set symbol
	transparency + color
Message-ID: <1308600331.1582.15.camel@marlon-laptop>

Hello all, 

Recently i started a new job. I introduced QGis to my collague's and
they where very enthousiastic. I'm encouraged to use QGis instead of
ArcGis.

I wrote a simple script that generates >50 maps (png) automatically from
shapefiles. 
But i want to finetune the proces and make the map more appealing. 
For this i need to change the symbol transparency. But i haven't found a
way to do it. sym.setTransparency(75) doesn't work. 

Furthermore, i want to change the color of the symbols. I can change the
inner part of the symbol, but not the edge. Whatever i do, it stays
yellow (of all colors). The strange thing is that the edge of the
symbols in the legend do change to the color i want (and the color of
the symbols on the legend and map if i want to).
Swapping the lines so renderer.addSymbol is last didn't solve the issue

I believe i am still working with the old symbology as i have not found
a way to move over to the new symbology using PyQgis. In the cookbook is
only a reference to check what you use, not to switch.

A snapshot of the symbol creation:

   color = QColor(255*i/numberOfClasses, 255-255*i/numberOfClasses, 0) #
from green to red
   sym = QgsSymbol( layer.geometryType(), lower, upper, label, Qt.red )
# why a red edge in legend but not on the map?
   renderer.addSymbol( sym )
   sym.setFillColor(color)
   sym.setPointSize(4)
   #sym.setTransparency(75)

On both Qgis 1.7 on ubuntu and Qgis 1.6 on windows xp i get the same
problems.

Regards,
Michiel

Hi Tim,

We are done ossim image provider and are ready to commit. 

1) Since QGIS is hard coded to use the GDAL provider, we added the QgisAppSettings class to load the global settings (which is a plain text file with key/value pair) to select provider.

2) We also implemented the band statistics function in ossim provider, but the code requires the changes in the base class which is not part of 1.7.0 release. It will be nice if you can review the changes to the base class and let us know if we can commit our files with the band statistics function.

Thanks,

Ming

This is a known issue. I have a branch where I have been replacing the
stats routines to use native stats from providers. You can clone it
from here:

https://github.com/timlinux/Quantum-GIS/tree/raster-stats

Its still unstable but maybe you can see where I am heading with this.

Currently not, but its an addition that we would love to see. The OTB
folks would appreciate this too.

Since we are using GIT now, you can simply fork QGIS, apply your
patches and invite others to test it out. I look forward to doing so
myself.

I totally agree it's complex.

I think most of the complexity comes from trying to get around the "I can get money out of the boss easier if he knows what the cost is", against the "we don't know until we start" part of the problem. If as Tim suggests most of the developers are willing to provide a number up front, then most of the complexity just disappears.

-ramon.

Hi all,
sorry about the delay. I just updated the wiki [1] adding the report about
the last week.

Good news, this week I would create and make available a mockup so who want
can test it.
In fact the basic functionalities was developed yet, I'm talking about
displaying info
about the selected item in the connection tree and run queries.

Cheers.

maybe I miss something in discussion but is this new
class (QgisAppSettings) is neccessary and why not use
QSettings for this? There is a qgsoptions.h/cpp files to
read and write QGIS setting

You are probably correct though its hard to discuss it without seeing
the code yet.

Hi all,

Reading a thread on qgis-users from yesterday ("Sextante library"), I 
discovered the existence of a Python library called Traits : 
http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/

I read 
http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/docs/html/tutorials/traits_ui_scientific_app.html
and came out with a "Are we reinventing the wheel ?" feeling.

Has anybody some experience in using this library ?
Is it usable in QGis (it already has a PyQt GUI backend) ? Any 
limitation coming to mind ?
Could it be the background on which the QGis Processing Framework is built ?

I don't know at what point it can be customized, if it will fit to all 
the requirements, but it surely adresses the same needs.

Julien

Hi Julien.
I had the same feeling, but I do not know that project.
Any stronger opinions?

It seems that PyQT is probably just new. Hence, we have not heard about this,

"Currently, the supported GUI toolkits are wxPython and PyQt. While
both toolkits funtion with Traits, integration with wxPython is
currently more complete. All future development, however, will focus
on supporting PyQt."

I think we would mostly interact with trait's GUI abstraction,
anyways. So we could start development & hope that later PyQt support
will improve (so that we don't depend on wxWidgets).

I don't think it would be to hard to switch to traits (looks quite
similar to our design), I'll wait a few days to see if someone more
experienced chimes before taking a decision. There may be hidden
limitations or complexities we are not considering.

In the meanwhile focus on converting the module tree to MVC.

One point somewhere in this thread was about having (in the future) the 
framework in core, implemented in C++, with a Python binding on top of it.

This would go against it, but I'm not sure now whether the C++ side is a 
must-have or not.

All the tools listed for possible inclusion in this framework are either 
in Python or have Python wrapper on top of them (I was claiming for C++ 
support in the past, this is now history, and the OTB-Qgis glue can and 
will be done in Python).

Hi guys,

I'd like to know if there is a project for hydraulic modelling using
QGIS, like InfoWater or WaterGEMS or EPANET???

Thanks in advance,

Same for me-- wanted to interface to SAGA with C++ first. Now I am
happy I am doing it in Python. :)
Don't think C++ is a requisite. Good thing about traits is, it does
not depend on any GUI.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Access map bookmarks from python plugin
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Y+q+mOh9Cw3OWzaeXHgAitHY0mg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I have not found any "getBookmarks" method in Qgis head api. I also scaned
the project XML file, but could not find the bookmarks neither. Is there a
way to get the bookmarks list from a python plugin ?

Thanks in advance
Kimaidou

We are using QSetting within the QgisAppSettings class. I will take a look to see if we can use qgsoptions.

Thanks,

Ming

maybe I miss something in discussion but is this new
class (QgisAppSettings) is neccessary and why not use
QSettings for this? There is a qgsoptions.h/cpp files to
read and write QGIS setting

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for your reply.  In my case, the specifications call for an
interface that includes only the functions needed by the users.  As
far as I know, someone needs to be running the full GUI of QGIS in
order to use a plugin.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, most
of the plugins I have used are focused on providing one added
functionality to QGIS.  Can you point me to some plugins that are more
complex?

Thanks again,
Bob

I received it thanks. I am busy building now. Could I point you to the
CODING document in the top level of master

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/CODING

Section 2.7 explains the 'nice' way to share patches etc. Your changes
are out of date with master and as they are not in a patch, they
remove various changes that have been made upstream. Basically if you
follow our guidelines of submitting patches (or creating a fork on
github), it makes it much easier to evaluate your changes.


I got some an error when running cmake:

 CMake Error at src/app/CMakeLists.txt:407 (ADD_EXECUTABLE):
  Cannot find source file "qgsnewvectorlayerdialog.cpp".  Tried extensions .c
  .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp .hxx .in .txx

I had a quick look at your settings class QgisAppSettings and as Alex
suggests, it would be much better to use the QgsOptions and / or
QSettings to manage this (or even QgsProject if you want to store the
setting per-project).

I'm going to be travelling the next few days, but I will try to test
any updated patches you make available.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer - Legend items
Message-ID: <011301cc30d9$af6eea60$0e4cbf20$@co.uk>

Hi,

 

I have long had an issue with the legend items in the print composer.

 

Using a point layer, when a size of a point symbol is NOT in map units, the
layer displays correctly. However, when map units is selected and, for
example, a 1000m entry is used, the legend becomes enormous and completely
unusable.

 

Although this displays correctly on the map, the legend extends to somewhere
in the region of A0 size! I cannot find a way of reducing the size of the
individual point in the legend settings.

 

Does anyone know a solution to this?

 

Many thanks,

 

Rob

Dear all,

I've just tried installing the standalone version of Qgis 1.7 on XP, and

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Printing 25k raster maps
Message-ID: <01a201cc30f1$2ebad6f0$8c3084d0$@co.uk>

Hi All,

 

Since changing to v1.7 Wroclaw, I can no longer print 1:25k raster mapping
data.

 

The data I have is currently in PNG format, and worked fine in v1.6 Copiapo.
It displays fine in the QGIS main window, but will not display in the print
composer or actually print onto a page.

 

I have tried re-downloading the raster file, re-importing it, starting a new
project with it, re-installing QGIS, and even trying it on another PC, but
all have the same problem.

 

Has anyone else come across this? I desperately need a solution, otherwise
i'm going to have to go back to v1.6, which is a real shame.

 

Thanks,

 

Rob

Hi Rob


Just tested here and I can print my 1:25k maps here (geotiff though).

Do you have the possibility to make an example available (or send it to me 
privately)? Please open a bug ticket with exact description of steps (e.g. if 
you print to printer, export as pdf, export as image, operating system used).

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Latest GRASS with QGIS
Message-ID: <4E020D8A.2030200@comcast.net>

Hi,

Just fyi, I just built the latest grass from svn and I'm now seeing two 
issues.

1) In the FindGRASS.cmake it looks like the library grass_vect is now 
grass_vector or libgrass_vector.so(on linux).  Changing:
   SET (GRASS_LIB_NAMES gis vect dig2 dbmiclient dbmibase shape dgl 
rtree datetime linkm form gproj)
To:
   SET (GRASS_LIB_NAMES gis vector dig2 dbmiclient dbmibase shape dgl 
rtree datetime linkm form gproj)

Fixes that.

2) Then it looks like version 7.0 is not supported.

CMake Error at src/plugins/grass/CMakeLists.txt:8 (MESSAGE):
   Your GRASS version is not supported
   (/work/osgeo/qgis/Quantum-GIS/src/plugins/grass/modules-7.0 is not 
found).

Are there plans to support 7.0?  I'll pull a 6.4 version in the mean time.

Take care,
Dave

Unless there are tools in GRASS relating to this, I think there is currently only the ghydraulic plugin: "a simple Quantum GIS plugin that adds a function to calculate economic diameters based on given flowrates".

Hopefully what you want will be available in the future, as the ghydraulic homepage does say this: 
"Roadmap
GHydraulic should fully integrate the EPANET engine into Quantum GIS" [1]
But I don't know whether it is being actively developed or not.

Also, the developer of inpPINS (which is a program for converting shapefiles to and from SWMM input/output files [2]) says that it in the future is intended to support EPANET as well as SWMM [3].

Has 7.0 been released yet? If not, are there any release dates set?

A debian plugin is under preparation. Otherwise you'll have to build it yourself.

Hi all.
We (faunalia.uk) have recently been at: http://www.opensourcegis.org.uk/
Interesting experience:
- qgis featured prominently in many, if not most, talks
- we had an apparently very successful (overbooked, people looked happy
even if, being British, did not express themselves) workshop on qgis
- I could compare qgis with gvsig (more on a separate mail).
MOre comments and feedback welcome.
The quote of the day, by a prominent speaker, was:
"QGIS consistently blows me away".
Compliments to all.

Hi there

I reckon it will be great to have a set of plugins for hydrology and
hydraulic modelling in QGIS.


To develop a new hydraulic engine for QGIS is not an ideal and we will
be re-inventing the wheel. So, the ideal situation is to take an
existing tool and use QGI to pre-process or post-process the
inputs/outputs.


Most of the hydraulic/hydrology model I have come across are for Windows
only, which is not ideal. 


The only one which is very powerful and really multi-platform is AnuGA
http://sourceforge.net/projects/anuga/

AnuGA can be used for modelling: coastal, fluvial, surface water and
urban drainage system. 

We have developed a plugin for QGIS so that you can prepare your model
GIS files (boundary files, mesh, etc). It is a bit out of date and
requires lots of tweaking.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/anuga-gai/

Will be good find a fund from those who are interested and develop this
further. We have several ideas to improve the plugin further (mesh
editor, result viewer, etc) but extremely busy atm.

Cheers
Saber

Message-ID: <1308815186.2525.29.camel@fox>

Hi all.
I attended the "gvSIG day", embedded in http://www.opensourcegis.org.uk/
to compare their results with ours. Overall, I'm quite happy with the
results of the comparison, and I still prefer QGIS after that ;) .
They have done a few interesting things:
- WCS support (we need this one, should be very easy using GDAL)
- SOS support (sensors)
- gazetteer support
- they can export the data of the raster histogram (should be very easy)
- they have built in color tables for rasters, and can import/export
GIMP color tables
- raster filters can be applied OTF, or saved to a new raster
- they use potrace for raster to vect operations (it could be an
interesting option to explore)
- I found their 3D part rather confusing, but it has some interesting
features, including animation.
I didn't like their development model: AFAICT, there is a commercial
association of all gvsig devs; this has a strong potential for a
monopoly. I could not see anywhere, in OSGeo material, a difference
between graduated projects (like us) and incubating ones (like gvsig). I
was not happy with that - there is a difference after all.
All the best.

No for both question, the release will be in the next years :-)
There will be a lot of changes so it's difficult to establish a

That's precisely why a number of users and external developers, 
including myself, have now forked off the gvSIG Community Edition (CE).

We are still in the process of building up the web infrastructure,
but the mailing lists are already active and you can read up on
progress in the list archives (the most active one is currently 
the "community" list):

 Is this fork going to stay in sync with gvsig's trunk or is it going 
 its own seperate path ? I thought that after last year's talks about 
 differences between your OA edition and the official (but not public) 
 tree the situation would have improved.

What are you referring to with the "not public" tree?
Benjamin will answer officially, but the CE edition will try to keep the
sync with the official trunk. At now the CE trunk contains a gvSIG 1.9
snapshot (the same of the OADE edition), but will be upgraded soon to gvSIG
1.11, which is the latest release.
A critical moment will be the release of gvSIG 2.0, which will be a deep
refactoring of the core code structure. When it will happen the development
and maintanance forces should be split between the 1.1x series and the
new... I cross my fingers!

It now has turned into a gvsig mailing list :)
From Qgis community's point of view, it will be great to absorb gvsig users and developers:
Developers: qgis provides a more open approach to its development and its totally a community driven project.
Users: qgis can potentially provide all the functions gvsig does. I have not used gvsig and can't say more about it.

Paolo's email should be interpreted in ways qgis can be improved to replace gvsig. 
Both projects are free and open source but one is more! :)

Cheers
Saber

Dear Paolo (and others),

I've managed to install 1.7 with osgeo, and indeed that works when 
setting the gdal path to C:/OSGeo4W/bin.

I've now tried to install 1.7 using the stand alone installer on XP. 
Initially that didn't work (couldn't load PyQgis), but after 
uninstalling 1.5 that is also working. Even after re-installing 1.6 
(which I'd like to keep as a fall back option).

Thanks for everyones help,
Janneke

Turning the discussion to a "differences game" there should be a lot to say,
with pros and cons for both the softwares and communities.
>From my experience I would say that:

 - Qgis community processes are way much "open" then gvSIG. I think this
depends on the fact that gvSIG was born with a public funding that has been
won by a private agency (IVER company), and released as GPL. The result was
a fast, black-box development that haven't given the right wieght to the
community involvment. Many from the gvSIG community are aware that this has
to be solved now, and while the TSC is working on this, others has chosen to
fork it (fist as OADE and noe as CE)

 - gvSIG's (huge!) code base is changing quite rapidly, so some of its
important extensions, provided by private companies, are not aligned to the
latest release, and the next big refactoring (gvSIG 2.0) will need the
extensions interface to gvSIG to be almost completely refactored. QGis API
has reached much more stability, and this will help its maintance...

 - Two gvSIG pros: it's Java, so it's development is (from my point of view)
easier then C++ for many power users and developers. And it's
cross-platform. Ok, Java has its problems, we knoe, and it's under the
Oracle brand. But I'm not sure Qt would make me sleep more relaxed...
  The second pro is that some of its features respond very well to some
enterprise needs: Oracle Spatial works very fine, the Network extension
(which needs to be updated now to the latest gvSIG) brings very good
algorithms, the Sextante integration opens gvSIG to hundreds of processing
algorithms and let users write scripts and models in an easy way...

 - Two QGis pros: the user experience is "smoother" then gvSIG's. I feel the
UI more reactive and comfortable. The Python interface is powerful and
permit everyone to write its own plugin easily, even if data processing can
become unfeasible with big datas! But working at a lower level requires much
more skills then Java...

I think gvSIG commercial approach has lead to a bigger involvment of the
private companies, bringing to the development of enterprise ready features
(eg Oracle driver), so its approach is a double knife...
Qgis is much more closer to the users, but it seems it hasn't been able
(yet) to attract similar volumes of private companies in a virtuous process
of collaboration to develop some of the features that makes gvSIG more
acctractive for the enterprise level.

There should be a lot more to write, but I stop here.
I would like this "cross project" face to face discussion to continue. It
can be of help for both the communities ;)

OK, folks, let this be the last email to the QGIS list
on this topic! We should really continue the discussion 
on the gvSIG CE community list, which is the right
forum for this.

I am copying this reply to the gvSIG CE list, so we can 
pick up this conversation where we left.

For those who are interested from a general open source
GIS point of view (btw., I strongly believe that the
open source GIS community will benefit more from diversity
than from one project taking the lead over all other),
here's a quick summary:

- gvSIG OADE was created because the "official" gvSIG
development had stalled for the 1.x branch at version 
1.9 in 2009, a disastrously buggy version, and 
resources were reassigned to 2.0, which until this day 
has failed to materialize.

- gvSIG CE (release 1.0) will be based on the last
release of gvSIG OADE (2010), plus all relevant
patches for gvSIG 1.11/1.12 that have accumulated
in the meantime, plus whatever the gvSIG CE devs
contribute.

- gvSIG CE will be completely open source and follow
the same principles and practices as e.g. QGIS and
GRASS GIS

- There is strong cooperation with SEXTANTE, which
is by now an integral part of gvSIG, and we do our
best to synchronize releases.

- A sync of gvSIG CE with gvSIG 2.0 might happen if
and when a stable release of the 2.x branch gets out
that is up to par with 1.x in terms of user visible
features/advantages.

Best (and apologies to the QGIS people who had
to put up with all this gvSIG talk on their list),

Ben

Hi Marco,

Interestingly, I have done some research on this last night and this
morning, and it appears to be an issue with the rendering of the print.

For some reason, the 25k raster layer is only filling the top 1/3 of the
print, with the 250k raster layer underneath then becoming visible for the
other 2/3.

I have created a new project, put the 25k raster in, created a new print
composer and printing the map alone works fine.

However, I have just created my current project again from scratch to ensure
no project file errors occurred when moving from 1.6 to 1.7, and the same
happens!

If I remove the underlying 250k raster layer, the lower 2/3 of the print
becomes blank, with only the vector shapefiles displayed.

When I export this to a PDF, it turns out fine, but you can see Acrobat
Reader rendering the first 250k layer, then the overlaying 25k layer, so I
wonder..

I printed another project fine, so I just don't know what to do with this
one!

Cheers,

Rob

Just tested here and I can print my 1:25k maps here (geotiff though).

Do you have the possibility to make an example available (or send it to me 
privately)? Please open a bug ticket with exact description of steps (e.g.
if 
you print to printer, export as pdf, export as image, operating system
used).

Hi Rob

Point symbols in map units are supported now in the newest developer version:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-
GIS/commit/576b05c12feda555604c9f01d6011e36e6fae7d2

It works only with the new symbology.

Further to my last,

When I open the print composer, it will display either of the following at
random:

- The 250k raster layer with no overlaying 25k layers or vector layers;
- The map as displayed in the QGIS main screen, which shows the 25k raster
layers, overlayed with vector layers;
- Part of the 250k raster layer with part of the 25k raster layers,
overlayed with vector layers.

This normally sorts itself out when 'move item content' is selected and the
map is moved.

Is there anything in the print composer which was changed from v1.6 to v1.7?
As I say, it used to work flawlessly, but now i'm really struggling with it.

Cheers,

Rob

Hi Rob


Just tested here and I can print my 1:25k maps here (geotiff though).

Do you have the possibility to make an example available (or send it to me 
privately)? Please open a bug ticket with exact description of steps (e.g.
if 
you print to printer, export as pdf, export as image, operating system
used).

I have the next issue: I can print all maps A1 format with resolution less
then 100 dpi on larger formats (A0) missing stripes of raster with qgis 1.7,
same job qgis 1.6 crash.
I thing that is memory leak problem.  Maybe lower resolution settings solve
your problem.

Best regard, Jo?e.

Further to my last,

When I open the print composer, it will display either of the following at
random:

- The 250k raster layer with no overlaying 25k layers or vector layers;
- The map as displayed in the QGIS main screen, which shows the 25k raster

Hi Joze

The problem you describe occurs with the windows version only. I think it is a 
32bit problem, probably Qt writes the file before compressing and that could 
hit the maximum file limit.

Marco

Hi,
why pyspatialite module is not included in Qgis 1.7 under mac os x. Pyhton
modules not installed are very boring for a new user that can't understand
how to install it.

It's possible to consider a poll where the users requires their own
favourite modules that could be included by default on qgis: reportlab,
sqlalchemy, shapely, ecc. ecc. or a plugin to download the python modules
directly inside qgis?

Thanks a lot!!

What would be really nice to have would be an open source alternative to
software like SMS:

    http://www.aquaveo.com/sms

That is, a framework that is not specific to a single modle, but could be
used to prepare input for multiple different models and visualize their
output. A good mesh editing plugin would be an ideal start, something that
could handle:

    - Structured meshes
    - Unstructured meshes
    - Quadtree meshes

Perhaps if QGIS embedded its own Python installation such as is done by the
Blender folks. But as long as QGIS is using Python distributions that comes
with the system, I think I would get annoyed and confused if there were two
different versions of a module running around---one of which I did not
install myself.

The Pip package manager makes it easy to install, remove and manage Python
modules:

    http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html

Perhaps you would find it helpful.

I guess the installation python modules it's a work for developer. I guess a
simple user could feel himself demotivated.
I use easy_install but not always I can install the modules.

I noticed also psycopg2 is disappeared from qgis...

The pysqlite2 framework included in the SQLite framework from KyngChaos is built against spatialite and is therefore equivalent to pyspatialite. I am able to run the spatialite_manager plugin by replacing:
from pyspatialite import dbapi2 as sqlite
with
from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite

William, would it be possible to change the name (add an alias) in the framework so that it is compatible with some of the QGIS  plugins? Alternative, can plugin developers test on OS X if pysqlite2 exists.

Hi,

Following a news on qgis 1.7.0, Mathias Bavay asked if we would be 
interested by a C++/LGPL lib they're are working on :

https://slfsmm.indefero.net/p/meteoio/

"The MeteoIO library aims at making data access easy and safe for 
numerical simulations in environmental sciences requiring general 
meteorological data."

I've asked him to join the list as it would be a nice addition to the 
growing geoprocessing framework :)

Hi Tim,

We already installed GIT and checked out the master code. We also created a branch on my machine, I am wondering if I need to get permission from you to push our branch over to community.

Thanks,

I received it thanks. I am busy building now. Could I point you to the
CODING document in the top level of master

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/CODING

Section 2.7 explains the 'nice' way to share patches etc. Your changes
are out of date with master and as they are not in a patch, they
remove various changes that have been made upstream. Basically if you
follow our guidelines of submitting patches (or creating a fork on
github), it makes it much easier to evaluate your changes.


I got some an error when running cmake:

  Cannot find source file "qgsnewvectorlayerdialog.cpp".  Tried extensions .c
  .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp .hxx .in .txx

I had a quick look at your settings class QgisAppSettings and as Alex
suggests, it would be much better to use the QgsOptions and / or
QSettings to manage this (or even QgsProject if you want to store the
setting per-project).

I'm going to be travelling the next few days, but I will try to test
any updated patches you make available.

Best regards

Hi there!

I am very interested in this topic too..
I played around with ANUGA a bit and I use SMS very often ..
To be honest since Bricsys released their BricsCAD for linux SMS is the 
last software that keeps me bound to Windows.

But the 3D Component is still missing in QGIS and a tin creation 
algorythm which is not ignoring breaklines is also a big point for me.

But I like the idea of probably using QGIS for modeling ..

I also like to integrate the GRASS topmodel for hydrology  - we'll see 
if i am able to do this ;)

regards
Werner

 Hi Mingjie, a quick and easy way to make your code available for 
 community review would be to create a fork of qgis on github and then 
 create a branch on this fork.

 This way it will be easier for you to keep it in sync with master and 
 for the devs to have a look and pull your changes.

 Hi,

 I guess this library would be interesting as a base for meteorological 
 analysis tools. Without some tools I am not sure how useful it would be 
 within QGIS?

 Any ideas who would be the users/developers if the library would be 
 integrated? Do we have QGIS users dealing wtih meteo data? Or would 
 there be other use cases for it?

 Andreas

 PS: I know Mathias from SLF in Davos ;-)

Hi Werner

The interpolation plugin provides constrained delaunay triangulation. You can 
add layers and mark them as breaklines or structure lines.
Though the numerical robustnes of the code might not be good enough for 
enterprise usage (was developed as part of a phd project).

Marco

The 3D view and time varying rasters are probably a bit beyond QGIS and
can be done in ParaView.

Hi,

on  http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3987

I've attached a sample plugin that permits an user to make a selection on
any feature, so you can test it yourself.

It demonstrates that QgsVectorLayer.select() function works only on PostGIS
layer,

on RasterLite / ShapeFile layers  you cannot select polygons.

Select() is broken on 1.7, while 1.6 worked perfectly.

... though this is generally a good idea for any system (they'd also have to test within pysqlite2 for the availability of spatialite).  But it's harder to get many developers to change habits than it is for one packager ;)

Hello,

I am working on a hiking site and I would like to find a list of parks in
the US where people can hike.  How could I go about doing that using the
qgis libraries?

Do I need to download anything or can I just query the api and get results
back?

Thanks!

1st this is more appropriate for discussion on the qgis-user list.
2nd QGIS is a data viewer and analysis tool not a data source.

You will need to find a data source for your site. I don't actually
think there is any one single source for the information you're looking
for. A good start would be National Parks, State Parks and Public lands
layers. You might also want to look at products offered by SimpleGeo.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Jo?e,

is easy, you need to install one package/script available in the
ubuntugis repository and then use this script to compile (with the ecw
sdk) the support for ecw into gdal. It is just one command and it takes
a few seconds.

http://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/UserTutorials


The real problem is to have the SDK for Linux, that is no more available
on the ERDAS site.


For a long time I believed that this was not redistributable software
(the erdas sdk), but recently I spent a few minutes reading both the
licences of the new SDK -the one with just binaries for Windows- and the
one of the old SDK (the one that was in the form of source code and that
was still named after "ER mapper").

I'm not into licences matters, so I would like to know what do you think
about.

To my understanding the .dlls of the new SDK are clearly
redistributable. This binaries have indeed limitations, as are only read
only and cannot be used in servers, but it seems to me that the could be
included in desktop software.

+++++++++++++++
"this Agreement does not permit You to (a)
use the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK
Desktop Read-Only to create or distribute Server Applications or SDKs;
(b) use the ERDAS ECW/JP2
SDK Desktop Read-Only to create Libraries; or (c) distribute header
files or .lib Library files included in
the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK Desktop Read-Only"

You may distribute with your End Application any
dynamically loadable object Libraries (.dll files) that are included in
the ?redistributables? directory of
the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK Desktop Read-Only, and are used by your End
Application.
+++++++++++++++


If the old SDK licence was not voided somehow by ERDAS it seems to me
that it is pretty permissive. The document describes three different
licences, apparently the user had the chance to choose among them. The
two more interesting are:


+++++++++++++++
*) ECW JPEG 2000 SDK FREE USE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

b) You may install and use an unlimited number of copies of the ECW JPEG
2000 Runtime, which consists of files contained in the "runtime"
directory for use in "Client Software". You may reproduce and distribute
an unlimited number of copies of the ECW JPEG 2000 Runtime for use in
"Client Software"; provided that each copy shall be a true and complete
copy, including all copyright and trademark notices, and that you comply
with the Distribution Requirements described below.  You may not use
Software Product for development or distribution of "Server Software".
+++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++

*) ECW JPEG 2000 SDK PUBLIC USE LICENSE AGREEMENT

"The intent of this license is to establish freedom to share and change
the software regulated by this license under the open source model and
is applicable to the use of the ECW JPEG 2000 SDK with Unlimited
Decompressing and Unlimited Compression for applications licensed under
a GNU General Public style license ("GPL") as set out below."
+++++++++++++++

Both seem to me to allow include the libraries in desktop software, the
second one even to server software.

It is indeed software that was last developed in early 2006... but still
working ok.


Cheers

Took me a while... I found that the web logs counted requests and bytes, but not necessarily completed downloads (didn't account for aborted downloads), and had to do it over using downloaded byte counts and lookups to file sizes.  The * below was very exaggerated at over 8000 hits, most others were exaggerated approx 2x.

Very crude table:

'snow' and 'leo' are the 2 main OS X systems, 10.6 and 10.5 respectively.  'ssnow' and 'sleo' are the standalone packages. 'ppc' is when I split the leo package because the new Qt Cocoa builds don't do PPC.

I personal prefer email to RSS, and I believe I'm not alone.
Could this function be reenabled?

Could someone from wiki admin group kindly set up an account for me?
I am trying to create an account and here is the message:

Message-ID: <BANLkTimuxv3AJnBLCrfBZ_s=85eymAe8tw@mail.gmail.com>

The srs database in qgis trunk is updated by crssync after each build so
that it has the correct set of parameters, at least in the crs I'm using, eg
EPSG:3375 and the like. It looks like the srs database in the released 1.7
Wroclaw is not updated. It's missing the +gamma parameter in EPSG:3375.

Can the srs database be updated in the next 1.7.x release please?

Thanks

Message-ID: <1309184877.23355.57.camel@ioio>

Dear lists

I have added a wiki page for hydrology and hydraulic (fluvial, coastal
and urban drainage) modelling with QGIS:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Hydrology_%26_Hydraulic_modelling#Hydraulics

Feel free to add the software (proprietary or open source) you are using
to carry out your water related modelling. 

Once we have a list, we can look into ways of developing plugins/tools
to be able to use QGIS as platform to pre and post process GIS elements.


Cheers

Hi,

When I posted here the topic about Water was for Water/Wastewater
distribution

There's no tools for creating and manipulating Networks/Graphs in QGIS
like EPANET does

Hi!

I think that would also fit onto the WIKI Page - just crate a new headline ..
We could collect anything which has to do with water - wether it is
wastewater, highwater or powerplant-water ;)

feel free to add

Hi Saber and Werner,

I like this initiative, however an alternative to pure QGIS-oriented 
approach could be what I presented recently on GRASS meeting in Prague 
[1]. There is also brief pdf from presentation. I hope to present draft 
hydrological framework this Autumn.

Concerning existing hydrological software and projects I found big 
diversity of solutions [2].

regards,
Robert

I'm very glad to know that some steps have been made to implement the OpenMI
framework in Python. It will also help to share and integrate models with
JGrass, which is OpenMI compliant too.
I hope we will be able to read your full draft ;)

Thanksm

Hi Robert

Hopefully OpenMI will take off soon. Most of the none-Europe modelling
tools I have come across  do not comply with OpenMI standards yet. The
modelling tools developed by the EPA are often free (and for Windows
only) but not sure about their licenses. 

As you know, the software packages are very diverse for water modelling.
What will be great to see, in short term, to offer QGIS as a platform
for model building, post processing, etc. The intention, at least at
this stage, is not to write yet another modelling package.

There are several organizations/companies stuck with ESRI/Mapinfo/etc
products to deal with their GIS input/output files. I guess to start
with,  will be good to persuade these types of users to migrate their
GIS platform to QGIS by offering some simple set of tools to deal with
their modelling packages.


Cheers
Saber

Maybe OMS could be a better route?

+1 from your forum mod ;)

Anything that reduces complexity in our web infrastructure is a plus. The
forums attract a lot of spam (= work cleaning up) and I feel like there's a
much bigger audience following the mailing list anyway.

Best wishes,
Anita

You are right. I was talking already about it with Andrea from 
HydroloGIS. This alternative must be considered.

My goal is not related to import/export routines, which for sure are 
also important. I don't treat QGIS just as GIS environment, but as 
potential modelling environment.
Very seldom products you are talking are comprehensive. What I propose, 
is to implement common interface on top of those products. This way 
implementation will be much easier, or not ;).

There might be unwanted consequences if this were to happen. The forum
has evolved into a friendly first port of call for newcomers with
problems and I think that some new users might find the mailing-list
intimidating (I'm taking here about, say, a lad who might have
installed QGIS yesterday and now finds that his GPS tracks won't fit
properly on his map). At present we have the forum, which I think does
a good job for newcomers; the mailing-list, which is pitched more
towards those with greater experience; and we have the developer list,
which is where the world-class experts live.

I don't think this is a bad hierarchy.

Regards, Nick.

I had reports of people disappointed from not having a response through the forum (I
understand few devs and power users hang out there).
If true, this would not be a positive thing for qgis.
What are from your point of view the differences between a ML and a forum?
All the best.

Feel free to add your ideas on the wiki page. It's an early start and

For example, a person willing to work on SVG but with no return from a 
dev : http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=8773

It would be more honest to redirect to the list rather than keeping an 
unloved forum.

Message-ID: <4E08CE92.4010200@slf.ch>

Hi!

[sorry I missed the beginning of the discussion: I was not registered yet]

So, when I proposed you to talk about things from MeteoIO that could 
possibly be interesting for QGIS, I had the following in mind:
     *the calculation of solar irradiance on the ground, with terrain 
shadowing. Here, we are not talking about the (unfortunately) standard 
(pseudo)shading that is usually done in GIS (ie: adding shadows to 
highlight the terrain contours), but real shading. The radiation would 
only be valid for clear sky (we can not easily get the cloud 
information), but it would provide a valid potential solar irradiance 
information for a given date+time. We could easily also provide a 
yearly/montly/daily potential average solar irradiance layer.
     *we also offer a bunch of spatial interpolation algorithms (the 
kriging is not yet 100% finished, but almost). These are the tools that 
you need to transform point measurements in distributed values over a 
DEM (we use it for meteorological parameters, the whole thing was 
initially invented for mining)

Our library already provides meteorological data access, but is still 
focused on the research community (ie: labs exchanging data that is not 
necessarily publicly accessible).We are currently working on a proposal 
for the next 3 years, to provide more "end user" data sources and 
interconnect with general public data sources (like SRTM DEMs, weather 
services, etc). In such a context, we could then provide transparent 
access to lots of meteorological+DEM data. This could for example allow 
a user to simply define his base layer, select a meteorological 
parameter (like air temperature) and get spatially interpolated values 
on his DEM... I think that it would potentially be very nice. But we 
would need publicly accessible data first (which is slowly coming and I 
hope would be fully usable in 3 years).

Anyway, for now, I would propose the solar radiation code (that I would 
copy/past in place, not to depend on MeteoIO), that would bring a 
self-contained feature that I have never seen in GIS.

I think we have to be careful here, there are a lot of users out there who don't use mailing lists as a general rule. Mailing lists tend to be a bit more of a 'commitment' than forums, and I think we'd be alienating a lot of users if we drop the forums completely... Is there anyway to set it up so that forum questions are routed to the mailing list, while still appearing to be within the forums for those that prefer this? A new forum structure would probably be fine/nice, but mailing lists tend to be quite 'developer-centric'... I prefer mailing lists myself... But many of my students are 'afraid' or weary of them...

On the other hand, the mailing list format works well for the R project...

Just some thoughts to throw around before we completely abandon the forums... And possibly some users...

In the french-speaking community there is two big forums where users 
come to get support for qgis, they are better referenced than our forum 
on google so it is often their first stop. I'm sure that there must be 
an equivalent place for english speakers, if so it would better to 
redirect non-ML people to these forums rather than keeping our own with 
a lower reply rate.

Some forum users are already cross-posting on gis.stackexchange. Maybe that

Given that there are no objections & I have studied the traits docs
without finding any reason against it, I'll start migration of the
framework.

I don't know if it has hit the international news, but most of Chile's
"public" universities, including mine, are on strike now, so it's been
a very busy week, but I hope to catch up soon. A reschedule of the
project is necessary anyways, I think, as the goals have changed.

Camilo

This week I ported the module list to a MVC model using
QStandardItemModel/QTreeView. I'll test it a bit more before pushing
to faunalia's repo.

Traits[1] came up as an alternative to replace the parameter/validator
system. Traits also provides methods for GUI creation (with a Qt
backend).
This migration was suggested on the list and, so far, seems to be accepted.

I have studied the Traits documentation and started implementing
relevant changes. This will consume most of my time next week.

Your project looks nice and could be very valuable especially with 
respect to current "QGIS for water" discussion on this list.
Interpolation procedures, solar radiation and meteo data access sounds 
great.

Hi Mathias,

The solar irradiance example and the interpolation algorithms sound like
interesting additions to QGIS.

I also like the idea as a possibility to make QGIS more attractive to
scientists (next to the more common GIS tasks like data acquisition, map
publishing, simple analysis). It would help QGIS to gain foothold in
certain scientific communities.

Note, that I am not a developer (just a user) and cannot judge the
technical consequences and maintenance issues that come with such a code
addition. It would be important that a community would evolve around
this library and related tools/algorithms for support and maintenance.

There are also related efforts around SAGA and GRASS that may have some
overlaps with the envisaged goals of your library/tools - but it may be
that your code would be faster/more optimized for certain tasks?

Andreas

PS: Mathias: we use QGIS along with Postgis, gdal/ogr and others in the
administration of the City of Uster. We use it in a mix with other
commercial products. See our case study at
http://www.qgis.org/en/community/qgis-case-studies/uster-switzerland.html -
the goal is to move and more and more projects to the OS GIS platform
over time as the tools evolve. We also help to test and finance certain
improvements/new features along with other public administrations.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimvfxaUhUov22y8=bC=CdV3u3bQug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using windows XP and QGIS 1.7 (classic installation, python 2.5, grass
6.4.1 ). My Goal is to create a QGIS plugin for complex network analysis
(TSP,steinman tree,...), using GRASS capabilities. It aims to be very
user-friendly, and cross-platform.
I'm trying to call GRASS from within a QGIS python plugin, but I get the
following error (python console module):

I am pretty sure this is due to the Python Path, because the same code works
well in a classic python console (outside QGIS). But I'm not able to resolve
this issue. I haven't test yet, but I'm pretty sure it's working on ubuntu.

Another Question:

Does anyone know how to import QGIS  vector layer directly into GRASS ( as
v.in.ogr.qgis.loc from the GRASS Plugin)


Any help is welcome.

Romain,

Rather than routing forum posts to the existing mailing list, how about
sending them to a new read-only mailing list?

The problem is probably related to the way the Subprocess module handles the
I/O inside the QGis python console. It's a problem I've read about various
times, and is specific of the Windows environemnt.
Two thread I recently read about this are [1] and [2], and both consider it
a Subprocess bug.
I hope to find some time to reproduce it...

Sounds like the code for terrain shadowing and interpolation would be a nice 
addition to the analysis library of QGIS (code under src/analysis). Currently 
this library contains code for raster calculation, zonal statistics, some 
vector analysis and a bit of spatial interpolation (IDW and TIN). It would be 
great to have more content inside this library and especially more people 
maintaining it.

Code inside the analysis library will be accessible from all the plugins (C++ 
and python) and if needed also from the server.

Marco

Having trouble with that.. QGIS segfaults when I try to load any of
the modules in enthought.traits, e.g.:

import enthought.traits.api

When running the import through pdb it seems to hang. Can someone
please confirm?

Thanks,
Camilo

I support using gis.stackexchange instead of phpBB forum as well. It does
not fullfill the ultimate wish to have only one place for user support, but
gis.stackechange at least adds some quality to an old-school forum. I like
especially that you don't have to create another account and can login with
OpenID instead.

AFAIK the only difference between Nabble and phpBB forum is, that Nabble
requires you to subscribe to the mailing list as well, before you can post a
message. Subscribing can be done with one button click. But maybe this is
realla too much 'commitment' for a new user.

Good point. I do not like (nobody likes it, I guess) having I do not
know how many IDs to access the various parts of QGIS infrastructure
(wiki, redmine, git, joomla, ...).
Anybody interested in helping to develop a simpler solution?
Thanks.

Agreed, it would be good to have it.
Mathias, do you expect major problems in merging it as suggested by
Marco?
All the best, and thanks.

I know from personal experience that this is correct.

Agreed.

> What are from your point of view the differences between a ML and a forum?

These things are a matter of personal preference. In my case, I feel
more at home in a forum, but that said I could live happily enough
with the mailing list. There are problems with the forum, it does go
down sometimes, it can be slow to respond and of course it also
attracts spam. The upside is that it provides a friendly place of
first resort for newcomers to QGIS.

I'm ancient and as a result wary about talk of rationalisation and
simplification <g>. Very often all that happens is that things become
vastly more complex and difficult to manage (there is a law of
unexpected consequences).

Regards, Nick.

BTW: the registration to the wiki currently AFAIK requires manual
intervention. Wouldn't it be better to move the content to redmine
integrated wiki, so to have one less piece to maintain, one more login
etc.?
All the best.

yes, that would make sense. We need to find out, if and how a migration could
work.

There is only an old migration script, which is not working anymore  
(http://www.redmine.org/issues/1224). So migrating MediaWiki 1.15 to the 
Redmine Wiki will require some work (from my side e.g.).

Advantages:
-Same (OSGEO)-Login as for bug tracker
-Direct Wiki links from Bug trackers

Disadvantages:
-Different Wiki Syntax
-Some Media wiki features will be missing (Tab menu?, Categories?, HTML 
embedding?, What links here?, Maintenance reports?)

+1 for moving to redmine for wiki.  Having everything in one place would be
a good thing, less logins; one syntax; good time to clean up dead links and
old info; etc etc

Thanks Pirmin for the analysis. IMHO the only serious drawback is the
migration cost; I think we can live without the Mediawiki fancies, and
we are all used to more than one wiki sintax, I guess (no unification in
wikis, rather surprising and disappointing).
All the best.

I'm currently busy uploading the new versions. After uploading it will take
approximately one hour to compile.
Once this is done the package you are looking for is called: python-saga


Also, while I do have the ubuntugis-unstable repository in the

Because it was uploaded but (for some reason) did not compile. Not your
fault.

Thanks for the stats - very interesting. Hopefully the numbers support
the effort you put into building mac packages. I wonder how linux
fares against that. Alex Mandel was working on ubuntu download stats
once - I see if I can find the link to get them. Its a pity that the
useage of QGIS is so skewed towards windows, but hopefully that will
change over time to a more even spread.

Yes. Same here. No idea what those _speedups.so could be... Any ideas?
Can't continue if we don't solve this.

Hello,

Same here on Ubuntu Maverick.
The package can be imported in a standalone interpreter (python or ipython)
I start qgis, runs the "Python console", do the "import 
enthought.traits.api" : crash.

Hi guys,

Is there a way for developing in QGIS using Jython or Java?

Thanks,

Johan,

Problem solved by adding your repository:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/johanvdw/sagacvs/ubuntu lucid main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/johanvdw/sagacvs/ubuntu lucid main

Unfortunately, this does not entirely solve the problem of the saga
plugin in QGIS, but this is
another story.

Thanks!

Agus

QGIS is written in C++, and supports (C)Python scripting. Even if a C++/Java
binding is technically possible, IMHO it isn't a advisable.
Natural softwares for Jyhon/Java development can be gvSIG, uDig, OpenJump,
and the rest of the Java gfoss tools..

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis crash with qwt
Message-ID: <4E09BCF8.4000805@gmail.com>

Hi all,

i have create a new plugin in python and in my code when i can use a 
specific qwt function like "setAxisScaleDraw" qgis crash.

This is the error message :

qgis: 
/build/buildd-sip4-qt3_4.10.2-1-i386-SoYLd5/sip4-qt3-4.10.2/siplib/siplib.c :2600 : sip_api_parse_result: 
  L'assertion ? assign_helper != ((void *)0) ? a ?chou?.

I use qgis 1.6 on a debian squeeze. Perhaps a problem with package sip ?
I have rebuild my packages :
python-qwt5-qt4 and python-qwt5-qt3 but same result qgis crash


thanks a lot for helping

Cheers

Ludovic

Hi,

I can confirm the crash on Fedora 15, QGIS 1.6 and ETS 3.5. However, 
after installing the fresh ETS 4.0 from Github 
(http://code.enthought.com/source/) I can import traits.api (namespace 
'enthought' has been removed in 4.0) through QGIS Python console. Same 
applies to openSUSE 11.4 (64-bit) with QGIS 1.7. Official RPMs seem to 
be available at least for openSUSE.

Cheers,

Joona

The saga-qgis interface is pretty much non-functional yet. Could you specify
which problems you have encountered?

Are you using the faunalia version?

Just a quick note: both (real shading, kriging) are already implemented in
SAGA GIS. If a good plugin is available for saga, perhaps better to focus on
other functionality.
Anyway, let's hope that a processing framework leads to less duplicated code
in the long term.

yes the QMainWindow::destroyed() Signal does work but the problem is it is
only sending the signal when closing QGIS and not when closing the composer
Window.
Here is the code for this:

/beforeList = self.iface.activeComposers()
    comp = self.iface.actionPrintComposer()
    comp.trigger()
    afterList = self.iface.activeComposers()
        
    self.diffList = []
    for item in afterList:
       if not item in  beforeList:
          self.diffList.append(item)

    self.composerView = self.diffList[0]
    composerWindow = self.composerView.composerWindow()
    print self.composerView.composerWindow()

    QObject.connect(composerWindow, SIGNAL("destroyed()"), self.test) 

    def test(self):
       print "it works"
/

So I need a kind of signal which is sent when you close the mapcomposer
window with the x.
I know that composerView must be still present after closing the mapcomposer
window for the composer list.
But where builts QGIS the UI you need for the mapcomposer window?
And how can I get it for listening on the close Event?

regards,

Michael

Please notice: the plugin is under development, and it is published
mostly for coordinating the work of developers; we'll announce when it
is ready for the first test. The tag "experimental" has a meaning after
all.
All the best.

Hi Michael

The composer window is not destroyed on close (only if it is deleted 
explicitely in the composer manager).

One possible solution would be to add a signal to the composer window class 
which is emited in the close event.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

When trying to open the GML file from QGIS sample data, I get:

Warning: OGR[3] error 1: Unable to create Xerces C++ based GML reader,

Warning: OGR[3] error 1: File
/home/agraser/map/qgis_sample_data/gml/lakes.gml appears to be GML but the

Critical: File /home/agraser/map/qgis_sample_data/gml/lakes.gml appears to

I'm running QGIS nightly builds on Ubuntu Natty.

Could this also cause the WFS troubles? http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3991

Hi,

Anybody using QGIS 1.7.0.1 Mac OS X 10.6?

Is your select features working?

I think this bug was not fixed. it was reported before that select
feature is partly working. Now, it is not totally not working.

I don't select any features (0 features(0) on layer Italy. This layer
is created using com2001_s in Spatialite Cookbook data.

Hi All,

 the European Space Agency has announced a "Summer Of Code" project,
much like (but independent of) Google's SOC project:

 http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2011/

 just thought maybe someone out there has some spacey ideas for Qgis -
perhaps a tool to load Martian DEMs from the NASA web site, or an
implementation of Martian Coordinate Systems or satellite tracking...
The call for proposals isn't that specific (but it does say 'open
source' lots).

Hi Camilo

I hope I am not coming too late to join the discussion... I have not
studied the Traits documentation yet, but from what I read in the
intro it seems that the framework is tightly bound to Python. Earlier
I have suggested to start prototyping the framework in Python, though
it would be really bad to skip support for modules in C++ by offering
only Python interface for the processing framework.

Maybe Traits could be merely considered as a source of inspiration
rather than basing our processing framework on it?

Regards
Martin

 one idea that comes to my mind which is missing in QGIS rasters:

 Support of resampling methods for the display of the raster data 
 (bilinear,cubic,cubicspline,lanczos). Gdal supports these, but QGIS does 
 not use them.

 QGIS currently only supports nearest, as far as I know, which results 
 in very ugly display. It is the main reason I am still also using UMN 
 mapserver next to QGIS server.

 Do you think that the ESA summer of code project could sponsor this?

Hi,

Any pointers how to build and install QGIS Server on Mac OS X 10.6 platform?

How do a git clone (i.e qgis server only) from
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git ?

What is needed ( e.g.  libfcgi-dev ) where you get it for Mac OS X?

Any homebrew for qgis server or binary?

I want to use it as a server for my iPad Openlayers app and jQuery
webclient i.e. MapQuery (not done yet).

Thanks.

 Ugly? Interpolation of rasters at low resolution looks even more ugly
to me. At least the 'nearest' algorithm, showing grid cells as cells,
is honest to the data, unlike interpolation algorithms which don't
have statistical weight behind them.... Anyway, your mileage may vary
:)

 Really don't know - there's no hints or examples of what might be
accepted, and since this is the first year, there's no previous
examples either...

Select works for me.  Make sure you have the latest Sqlite framework (from GDAL Complete).

 it really depends on the nature of the raster. color-table based 
 rasters or 1bit rasters cannot be resampled of course - but the display 
 quality of scanned rgb maps, aerial images or 8bit grayscale maps would 
 benefit.

Also satellite data that is being ortho-rectified on the fly will have a 
rotation, in which case nearest neighbor is a bad option.  Note Ming's 
new ossim provider will be able to do this(ortho) once pushed out.

William, thanks again.

After installing GDAL 1.8 complete, it is working now.

Anyway, this should be an easy task, within the GdalTools plugin.
Any takers?

 no - I am not suggesting to implement this in the GdalTools plugin. 
 QGIS uses gdal to load the raster, doesn't it? The QGIS raster loader 
 should have an option to specify the resampling method used for the 
 raster display. It is not the idea to generate new files with a 
 different resampling method (like gdal_warp/gdal_translate do).

 It is probably a gdal option when loading the raster into QGIS and when 
 redrawing the raster.

Hi Andreas

It would be great to have a GDAL option for resampling. However, I don't think 
there is one.
UMN mapserver seems to do the resampling in 'mapresample.c' (so on top of 
GDAL).

Marco

Message-ID: <BANLkTinnbOeh_j0arm9HXbDyTuZm25F7OA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Anybody got a copy of QGIS-NaturalEarth-Example.qgs,
10m_admin_0_countries.shp, etc use in Live.Osgeo Qgis (map) server?

http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/qgis_mapserver_quickstart.html

I don't want to download the Live-OSGEO DVD. It is big.

I think it would good to have these sample files as one of the project
in Qgis github so we can easily clone it. We can add some more as well
in the future (just like ESRI ArcGIS it comes with some projects
examples for the new users to kickstart).

Probably, a "KickStart_QGIS_Projects" in Qgis github, not a bad title
for this sample.

Thanks.

That file is maintained in the OSGeo Live svn
http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/livedvd/gisvm/trunk/app-data/qgis/QGIS-NaturalEarth-Example.qgs

As for the data that comes directly from NaturalEarthData.com , details
are in the gisdata script:
http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/livedvd/gisvm/trunk/bin/install_gisdata.sh

Note: there are 3 example qgis project files on the DVD currently.

Yup, they are all in the same svn folder. The other 2 examples are
dependent on I believe the Spearfish (might by NC) dataset from GRASS
and the Mapserver Itasca example that ships with mapserver.

We are including an OSM (.osm) file now (location changes yearly to
match FOSS4G), and a populated Postgis database (OSM and NaturalEarth).
It might be good to create a couple more examples using that data.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

The qgis projects are unusable without the data set.

Any further instruction how get the date set synch with the project?
If I download the natural earth data?

Any possible download link with copy of the data set that comes with
the qgis project e.g. NaturalEarth?

I am trying to figure out the install_gisdata.sh. I am using the a Mac
OS X. The script is bit tricky for Mac OS X since it design for linux.
I see "POSTGRES_USER="user" ? It needs Postgresql?

Thanks.

Noli

No you don't need postgres, we happen to duplicate the data into a
postgis copy as well as the native shp.

Basically the script makes a folder called:
/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth

Into that folder the various selected layer are downloaded from:
BASE_URL="http://www.naturalearthdata.com"

LAYERS="
cultural/$SCALE-populated-places-simple
cultural/$SCALE-admin-0-countries
cultural/$SCALE-admin-1-states-provinces-shp
cultural/$SCALE-urban-area
physical/$SCALE-geography-regions-polys
physical/$SCALE-geography-regions-points
physical/$SCALE-geography-regions-elevation-points
physical/$SCALE-geography-marine-polys
physical/$SCALE-land
physical/$SCALE-ocean
physical/$SCALE-lakes
physical/$SCALE-rivers-lake-centerlines
"

Where scale in this case is 10m.
To put an example together:
http://www.naturalearthdata.com/cultural/10m/10m-populated-places-simple.zip

You really only need about line 57-131, plus a couple of the variables
set at the top.

You could also probably get away with just looking at the example file
and seeing which layers it wants and just download those directly from
the Natural Earth website.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

Would be possible to get a copies of the 6 files i.e. data set for
Natural Earth**.qgis?

1. 10m_lakes.shp
2. 10m_land.shp
3. 10m_oceans.shp
4.********.shp
5.*******.shp
6. ************.tif

Probably you can zip this project and these layers and send me the URL
to download it.

Thanks.

Noli

Forget about the request for the 6 files.

I am downloading the natural earth zip file. It says it has Qgis project in it.

http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
