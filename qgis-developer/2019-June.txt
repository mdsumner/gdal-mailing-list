Wow, this is more or less what I want to do also. In my case, I want to use
QGIS docker image and add a python script to handle the input. I put my
code in https://github.com/ismailsunni/docker-qgis3-model. It's still in
exploration mode, and still not working with dynamically using a model from
the user. Hopefully, it will be done soon (at least at the end of my course
semester :D ). This for my school project actually, but perhaps it can be
useful for other people.

I use a YAML  file to define the input and output since I feel it's not
easy to put the long parameter after the command.

After reading the QEP and another QEP about official docker image [1], so
this Docker image [2] is not yet an official one?

It's mostly done at

The implementation seems will be easier to use in Windows. Since by using
Docker, Windows user needs to install Docker first, and it's really not
straight forward unless you have Win 10 Pro.

Thanks for sharing Nyall. My search engine did not show the QEP or your
branch to me :)

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtF42CvOvnuC=yDjmGqknU1E9CpHRDCB+Hi3mOmQ+PTL3w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

Here is my 1st-week report for my GSoC Project. You can also check it on
the wiki page [3][4]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

Best regards

GSoC 3D Improvement Week 1 Report

*Period*: 27 May 2019 - 2 June 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   * Trying to implement floating widget above Q3DWindow --> Not possible
   * Decide with the mentors to implement it as a normal widget next to the
Q3DWindow
   * Implement the navigation widget and add the functionality (zoom
in/out, tilt up/down, rotating)
     ![QGIS 3D Navigation Widget](https://i.imgur.com/CBhu4PT.jpg)
   * Add the button to show and hide the widget (still using random icon)

2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   * Make the rotating button sync with the map (currently it can rotate
the map, but when the map rotate it doesn't move)
   * Create better icons for the buttons and make the rotation widget looks

   * Testing
   * Make a pull request to merge the works

3. Is there any blocking issue?
   * Previously yes, with the Q3DWindow, after discussing with mentors, we
will go to the normal widget. Another option: using QtQuick (needs to add
dependencies), render the control manually (too much work)

4. Code
   * For the initial works, my mentors asked me to work on my small project
[1] so that it is faster to developer
   * For the QGIS implementation [2]

5. Misc
   * We have daily text stand up in a slack channel

*References*

Ok now I see, I was missing the "github" portion of the URL.

This works: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/github/30003
This works: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14885

This does NOT work: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/30003

Any way to make that system smart enough to tell if a ticket
is a github one or a redmine one ? Or is there an overlap
between GitHub PR numbers and Redmine numbers?

No. It's https://issues.qgis.org/github/30003

Yes.  Every redmine ticket number is mapped to it's corresponding
github ticket number - all other numbers are passed throught to github
unchanged.

> Or is there an overlap between GitHub PR numbers and Redmine numbers?

Yes.  Redmine tickets range from 10 to 22134 and github tickets from 10094 to
29945.

Ok so I changed the Gitea template so it always links to
issues.qgis.org/github/[index]

Seems to work from a couple of tests.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Security Question - Is location included in file
 when save an image file?
Message-ID: <1724846404.62878.1559461353224@office.mailbox.org>

I'm a little out of my league here, I'm not a developer, but was pointed here from the QGIS-user list.

My question is: Does any coordinate or location data get embedded in the image file if I use Project > Save as Image or Composer > Export as Image/PDF/SVG (other than what is literally seen in the image)?

My question is primarily for 2.14.3 now, but later will have the same concern for the 3.x series when we upgrade.

(I know about the option to check "World file on" and create a separate world file. What I need is to make sure there is no identifying info whatsoever from the project file in the image file itself.)

Eg, say I have a basemap like OpenStreetMap open for a country and I load points in another layer that are inside that country. Then I zoom in on a group of points from my data layer, I turn off the basemap layer, and make a map with just my data points. I want to preserve the relative spatial relationships between my points but not reveal where in the world the map came from. If I publish this image file, might the metadata or anything else embedded in the file reveal the location?

So far, the QGIS-user members who've responded and I have found no indications that this type of data is included, but I'm posting here in case anyone who is familiar with that code could confirm that. Sorry I'm not able to read the code myself.

For the work we do, it's critically important we don't unknowingly publish specific locations. For now I'm taking screenshots to be sure nothing is transmitted, but that's a limiting workaround.

Thank you, as I said in my first post to the QGIS-user list, I very much appreciate QGIS and its community!

Fwiw, thread on the user list starts here: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2019-May/043218.html

yes - regardless of that setting, the outputs are georeferenced and
have coordinates baked in*

(* depending on format support. SVG doesn't, certain raster formats
may not -- check with GDAL whether embedded georeferencing of these is
possible. It is for all the common ones at least).

Just a thought -- did you try splitting this navigation widget off
into it's own tool-style window? Maybe doing so and letting the window
manager force it to sit above the 3d window would help. That giant
amount of wasted space on the right is certainly a downer.

I'm happy with either. To be honest, I suspect a lot of users would
"move on"/forget after 6 months, so that would be the maximum I'd like
to see.

Well, I figure it's an accurate reflection of the situation. A feature
request older than this will likely NEVER get implemented without
funding. If we don't go for a specific label, I'd suggest we make the
bot message say something like:

"Hey, your feature request hasn't been implemented in the 2 months
since you suggested it. That doesn't mean it's not a great idea! (more
likely, our developers are just busy with other priorities). The good
news is that YOU can still see this feature become a reality! Some
possible suggestions are:
- Dive into the QGIS code, and implement it yourself. If you've got
coding experience, QGIS is a fantastic, friendly open-source community
to contribute to.
- Pay one of the QGIS core developers to implement it for you.
Developers aren't necessarily volunteers, and often require payment to
justify the time they invest into the QGIS project. Our developers
LOVE working on QGIS, but they also like to eat and pay their rents!
- Run your own crowd funding or co-funding campaign and raise funds to
see the feature sponsored.
If you've any questions regarding how to approach any of these
suggestions, just ask below, and one of our team members will assist."

Great news -- thanks to the extended deadline, and dozens of fantastic
sponsors, this campaign hit its target and the work will proceed as
planned!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS and Proj 6
Message-ID: <CAB28AshfJ+J19PvsDbAL_n5Ji7po5=HLcAGPujNAL48bz7bkAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following the merge of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30040 , I now
consider QGIS' port to the Proj 6 API complete. Here's a bit of a
summary of what's been done here (on builds based on proj 6.1 and
later only, more on that later[1])

- The Proj CRS database is now used to populate QGIS' internal CRS
database. We no longer use the combination of GDAL CSV files and
manual QGIS overrides we've used till now. This means that ALL
responsibility for CRS definitions and updating these sit were they
belong, upstream in the proj library. It also means we'll be an exact
match wrt projections as other tools which have completed the port,
such as GDAL 3.0. (All this goodness is thanks to the GDAL barn
raising effort). We still HAVE an internal projection database, in
order not to break existing 3.x API, so we'll need to revisit that at
4.0 and see if it can be safely removed then.

- We rely entirely on Proj 6's wonderful logic for generating the best
coordinate operation to transform between CRS pairs now. This means
(amongst other stuff), we correctly support complex things like
operations which require a "pivot datum", e.g. transformation to and
from GDA2020 coordinate systems. Again, this is thanks to the GDAL
barn raising effort... if it wasn't for that, we'd be... YEARS away
from even dreaming about supporting these correctly. Seriously, hats
off to the proj/GDAL teams here, they've done a brilliant effort, and
have been tirelessly answering tons of questions on their mailing
lists.

- Instead of the older approach QGIS used for datum transformations
(carrying around our own table of when grid shift files can be used),
we now use proj to determine these. This considerably changes the user
interface shown when a user has opted into selecting manually a
transform to use when multiple transforms exist, and we now show a
simplified list of available (and non-available) pathways.

- We also use proj's database to populate lists of available
ellipsoids for use in distance and area calculations. This has cleaned
up the ellipsoid choices considerably, and added many additional
ellipsoid definitions as a result. (woohoo... no more duplicate
"WGS84"/"WGS 84" entries!)

- The UX for notifying users about issues in coordinate transforms is
greatly improved, e.g. users are now alerted when a more accurate
transform is possible, but not usable on their system (e.g. due to
missing .gsb grid shift files). Wherever possible, we present users
with direct download links to obtain these required/desired grid shift
files. The intention here is to ensure users are informed when
transforms can be improved, instead of silently falling back to less
accurate options.

- Users also now have the option of placing grid shift files in "proj"
folder off their user profile. This means users can install grid shift
files and make them available in QGIS without requiring administrative
rights (possibly in future we could make QGIS fire up a background
task which automatically downloads and installs grids on demand...)

- We've also completed a project which began back in the lead-up to
3.0, which ensures that project-specific transformation pathway
settings are correctly respected EVERYWHERE a coordinate transform is
performed. This also means we're ready for the next stage in handling
4d coordinate transforms (when these start to land in 2020 and beyond)

As noted above, a lot of this is only possible thanks to improvements
in the proj and gdal libraries, which landed as a result of the GDAL
barn raising effort. On the QGIS side, it was ONLY possible thanks to
funding from the Australian ICSM. It's been a HUGE undertaking, so I'm
extremely grateful that the ICSM has had the foresight to invest into
QGIS and open source software development in this way.

[1] Note that building 3.8 using the Proj 6 library requires a minimum
of Proj 6.1 -- it's not possible to build using Proj 6.0. There was an
API call added in 6.1 which we require, and I couldn't work around.
Sorry for any inconveniences this causes!

Thank you, that's super helpful. I will post your answer to the original thread on the qgis-user list.

I wonder how much effort would be involved (just a very quick ballpark guess) in adding an option to turn off georeferencing or coordinates when saving image files. Granted, I assume it's not something most users would need, but not sure how small or big it would be. It sounds like it might be bigger than I'd originally imagined in case it requires making adjustments for each file type.

Let me strongly second Calvin here.
I followed your work on the PROJ mailing lists and it's a big hat off for
you Nyall. Understanding the geodesic issues and making it available into
QGIS so soon is brilliant.
I'd also like to thank your funder whoever it is, because he allowed a huge
step forward. Not so many funders are able to invest into such low level
stuff.
And I don't forget the PROJ team, we all rely on the shoulders of giants,
truly.
Big up, you rock!

It takes the version status from QGIS.org not from the repositories. When the actual package arrives depends on your package repo etc.

	Server
Message-ID: <1DB09436-7DB3-4AE0-BC64-8E0B23F07BAF@kartoza.com>

Hi All

As explained by the subject line, I would like to reply a QGIS 3.x server based site where the project uses the QGIS authentication framework to store user names and password for the database connection in an encrypted manner.

I have used the authentication manager before on my desktop, but what do I need to do to set things up in a server environment?

Also the list of supported services in ’Settings->Authentication->Installed Plugins’ does not currently include Oracle. Did anyone use  the authentication manager against an Oracle database before?

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Ubercool Nyall! Thanks!

I've build QGIS with GDAL3 and proj6.1 here.

Both with an my (old) profile or with a crisp fresh one, I get a lot of
debug output with 'failed' in it... See below

Wondering if my build is wrong or it is just 'normal' output
(QGIS_DEBUG=5...)

But: thanks for all this. Though, let's be honest, I only understand
half of it :-)   Nobody with such knowledge willing to write a thorough
"QGIS with proj magic" intro in our docs?

Richard Duivenvoorde

This is "just" noise, it's not actually indicating anything is wrong.
I'll see what I can do to reduce this, because it annoys me too!

This was thanks to sponsorship from ICSM (https://www.icsm.gov.au/),
an Australian committee responsible for introducing a new system of
projections to Australia (GDA2020). They are also behind the
(scary/exciting) new world of 4d coordinate transformations, where a
future Australian reference system will be dynamic and have a temporal
component modelling the tectonic movements of the Australian
continent. When this lands it'll be time for a lot of us to hit the
textbooks again ;) We (Australians, that is) are extremely fortunate
to have such a forward thinking team behind this -- not only are they
tackling some fundamental changes in how projections are handled, they
also had the foresight to recognise the need for strong support for
this in open source software and invest their funds into seeing it
happen.

Totally. This team is amazing!

Thanks Nyall. You Australians should be proud of this forward thinking (as well as giving birth to Nyall, of course ;) ).

Great work! I know that has been a massive project and I'm sure it's well
worth it (except for the grey hairs now).

Thanks, heaps to ICSM for the funding to make this happen.

On that occasion:

how can I deactivate the new version information? I get frequent calls 
from my users asking if they need to do something. It's kind of annoying 
because we use LTS.

In QGIS Settings -> "General", you can disable "Check QGIS version".

If you are deploying QGIS with an INI file, you can do it programmatically.
You can hide this checkbox because QGIS version is managed by the system
administrator.

In my view, this should be DISabled by default, and being asked (at
startup?) if the user wants this.

It is actually a 'phone home' mechanisme, which I personally dislike
(even if developers developed it as 'service for users').

Quickmapservices plugin does the same (and stalls QGIS till timeout if
you network/proxy issues).

Hi all,
it seems that I and a few others lost our issue manager rights when
migrating from Redmine to Github.
So I can't help as much in bug triaging, adding tags, changing assignees
etc..
It seems the "triaging" role can be assigned at the organisation level in
github:

Thanks for your help

Hi Régis, hi Saber,

You are right. There was no proposal to migrate/update roles in GitHub.
It is really necessary, I think.

The "triage" role is quite adequate to give to active users that are
willing to help bug triage. This role does not have write permission, so
I think it can be granted with a less formal approach. All issue actions
are traceable and can be reverted/fixed if necessary.

The PSC could add a small rule to make clear how this triage role should
be granted.

In my opinion, it could be granted automatically for contributors (with
commits) or on demand for non contributors asking for it and showing
prior active participation (documentation, local groups, ...).

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Interestingly our web stats tracker shows version.txt being hit 57.5 million times in 2018 - which is a pretty useful indication of the amount of usage QGIS gets. Even if you divide that by 365 it would reflect around 157428 daily active users*.


* Assuming awstats can be believed to be a true reflection of users using QGIS and not bots etc.


Downloads	Hits	206 Hits	Bandwidth	Average size
	/version.txt <http://www.qgis.org/version.txt>	57,461,449	12	120.99 GB	2.21 KB


For me I am fine making it opt-in if that is what others prefer….

Tim

Hi!

Could we know more about those downloads, like for example their OS? I
believe that is probably a better guess of our user base than the downloads.

Thanks

Hi

Those are just pings against version.txt - we could probably trawl the apache logs to get OS etc….

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Why does the QGIS 3 OSGeo4W Shell Default to
	Python 2
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqSY1fTHrbk3sMBX8B7rR0zHfA7vZz5+oSmMfuY7809yg@mail.gmail.com>

Why does the QGIS 3 OSGeo4W shell default to python 2 when QGIS is running
python 3? I have had users get confused with this and it makes no sense to
me. For that matter why is python 2 still a part of the QGIS 3 application?

Thanks,

Calvin

The installer is built directly from OSGeo4w which supports both Python
2 and 3, it is not customized for QGIS 3 other than to drop non-required
files that QGIS doesn't use. I suppose you could say that python 2 is
one of those things that shouldn't be required.

I also ran into a minor issue that python3 didn't work until running the
python3_env.bat in a session.

So I'm +1 for making python3 the default in osgeo4w, we should probably
forward that request to osgeo4w.

Perhaps the builders have a different nifty work around when building
the QGIS installer (a custom osgeo4w bat file might suffice).

Thanks,
Alex

Nope, just the version:

… [05/Jun/2019:08:33:23 +0200] "GET /version.txt HTTP/1.1" 304 3602 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/2.18.28"

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How can I find the tickets that I reported?
Message-ID: <8e03d08b6455bfb0086b06822f47c71d@carto.net>

Hi, 

After the issue migration, I am trying to find my way around the new
issue system. I have a very hard time finding stuff. 

If I use the filter "your issues" - nothing shows up. But I sure had a
number of open issues in the old system. 

I would appreciate a bit of assistance here. 

F.e. how can I find all the tickets that I reported myself? 

Or is there some help/documentation available how to query the issues? 

Thanks a lot for your help! 

Andreas

Hi, 

Ah - I found out that I need to filter by "tickets mentioning you". 

However, that also includes tickets that were not opened by myself, but
someone cc-ed me - right? 

Also - is it normal that all tickets that I reported by myself are now
owned by qgib? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Yes - qgib could not impersonate the reporter when creating the issues.

You can still go to redmine to find your tickets - and use the links from there
to go to the github version.

Looking for "Author Name: Andreas Neumann (@andreasneumann) Original" 
produces 249 tickets - which matches the count on redmine.

Hi all,
thanks for the hints. I really think we need an how-to, and possibly shortcuts for the common queries like this.
Cheers.

Hi all, 

Thanks for your help and tips! 

Is there a way to manually re-assign the author of the migrated ticket
from qgib back to myself? 

Personally I just have to get used to the new issue system on github. Of
course, it takes some time to learn a new system. And no - not
everything is easy and self-explaining on github. I would say, because
it is a really open system, that it might even be harder to use than
Redmine for new users who never used github before (except for the
Mantra of course ;-) ). And I hope that the open nature of GitHub
doesn't lead to a big mess. For developers, the github integration is
definitely very nice though. 

But everything will be easier when we move from Github to Gitlab ;-) 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Not from the UI, and not sure GitHub will allow this (would imply
rewriting history?).

Right, and all that time will be capitalized by GitHub as customers
retention (nobody likes to learn new things, so people would feel
more comfortable in staying there, rather than moving elsewhere).

What do you mean here ?

Just for the record: Redmine also allowed OpenID login, and could have
easily allowed github login as well (plugins did exist).

You mean commit logs linking back to tickes ?

Except learning curve will need to be taken once again...

And the many 10's of 1000s of $$ it will cost to migrate all the CI
and integration scripts. The values of those should never be
understated.

IMO now that's dockerized it should not be that hard to move to another CI
infrastructure (not that I'm proposing that now).

I think Nyall was talking about more than the CI, there are many scripts 
and integrations running in the background on which we rely from day to 
day, not just the CI.

The hours to migrate them would be immense. And the hours lost by people 
because service X is no longer working although they had relied on it 
must also not be ignored. It's just outsourced costs in the end.

Oh yeah - silly me - I forgot QGIS was the user agent.

No, I don't you can claim other people's (or bot's ;)) work either.

Once again:  the mantra was not necessary for redmine - shortly after getting
osgeo ids was requiring the mantra, we enabled direct registration in redmine
available (and openid was available too).

And for the open nature of github: you cannot assign owners (see above) - and
you cannot integrate an external ticket system.

But you can use tons of other services, that make you more dependent on github
(like travis) ;)

As if that ever would happen - but I was hoping the same for the redmine
migration - so you never know ;)

But hey - that stupid qgib bot claimed my work to be his work during the
migration! And now he can't give it back to me? 

Not a big issue. I can live with it. As long as the core developers have
some benefit from the issue migration, then I'm fine.

you are right of course. And the Mantra is still required for
plugin-authors. So nothing really improved by the move to Github
regarding the Mantra.

Sorry - I wasn't very clear what I meant with "open nature" of GitHub: i
mean the "open" (unstructured) way of categorizing issues in Github.
Labels being the only way of structuring anything in the issues, whereas
we had versions, code areas, state, feature vs bug and more in Redmine.
If people don't use the label system consciously we quickly end up with
a big mess. That is my concern.

Hi Developers list,

A long time user, budding contributor here. Thanks so much for building 
QGIS to what it is today! :)

Does anyone know whether it is a plan to port the QGIS Resource Sharing 
plugin to a core plugin?

I have read a mention of this among the issues+comments on the plugin's 
github, see here:
https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing/issues/51#issuecomment-344397441

I have asked the developer of the plugin a while ago but received no 
response. I thought perhaps someone here knows whether this is (was) 
indeed the plan?
Otherwise, would there be a plan to implement its functionality? And if 
so, do you need help doing that?

Best Regards,
Áron Gergely

For the record, https://dronie.osgeo.org (login with OSGeo credentials)
is already docker-based, and is currently used by both GEOS and PostGIS.
See https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/postgis/postgis/commits/branch/svn-trunk
and https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos/commits/branch/master for
examples (those green-or-red tiny icons near each commit).

NOTE that an externally hosted instance of Drone (the open source software
used for https://dronie.osgeo.org) can be pointed to github.com for
getting used to it. See examples of that here:
https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/403
In the case above, the _same_ CI configuration is read by both the
OSGeo hosted instance (building PRs opened on https://git.osgeo.org)
_and_ by the externally hosted instance (building PRs opened on github)

Hi, that was indeed the original plan.

But some developers raised general concerns against including other plugins
in the core, that's why the idea was abandoned.

The plugin has been ported to  QGIS 3 a few months ago, so it is now
available.

Thank you for Alessandro!

I am aware of the plugin being available in QGIS 3 -  I am just 
exploring possibilities.

We are looking to create a plugin that would use external resources
to create map layouts.

Then the current solution is either replicating the functionality of the 
resource sharing plugin or instructing the users to get the resources 
via the resource sharing plugin.

...or finding a way to embed these resources in the project file.

Thanks again,

Best regards,
Aron Gergely

Except I got the package from QGIS's *own* repo, as I indicated. If QGIS is
going to be alerting me that there is a new version, shouldn't that new
version be available in the QGIS repo?

See these env vars for setting up access to an authentication database from
within Server:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/server/qgsserver.cpp#L234-L238

I have not tested this with recent QGIS versions, but maybe someone who has
worked with Server and the auth system may have (Alessandro?).

Most non-interactive auth method plugins should work, e.g. Basic, PKI, etc.
The OAuth2 auth plugin will not work if using a grant flow that requires
interaction; instead, use Resource Owner (the plugin doesn't support Client
Credentials grant flow).

Of course, this means the qgis-auth.db will need pre-populated using QGIS
Desktop prior to use by Server. You will probably want to create a new
profile, so that no other credentials are stored in the SQLite qgis-auth.db
file, or restart QGIS specifically to work on a specific qgis-auth.db file
(using option --authdbdirectory <dir>).

I have investigated adding auth support to Oracle in the past, but did have
the chance to implement it. Generally, since it uses a
QgsDataSourceURI object for configurations, at least the Basic auth method
plugin's update function should be easy to adapt:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blame/master/src/auth/basic/qgsauthbasicmethod.cpp#L87

This means probably adding a conditional branch based upon oracle provider,
similar to what was done for ogr/gdal:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blame/master/src/auth/basic/qgsauthbasicmethod.cpp#L201-L202

Then, it is a matter of just integrating the auth updating during Oracle
connections (and its pool), and adding the auth widget into the Oracle
connection GUI. This would be similar to how Postgres provider was updated
to support the auth system.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] macOS installs -- Lutra
Message-ID: <CAAQFaFLYFfzdhbjnSBUA=wtozin4G7Dn_XSDpJMqU77n8srPgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, folks,

I notice that the excellent installer for macOS from Lutra now says
"deprecated" on its page.
https://lutraconsulting.github.io/qgis-mac-packager/

I liked using that installer as it didn't require me to install Python 3.6
from Python.org, which has proven to conflict with my Python 3 homebrew
setup.

I remember hearing that there might be some updates to QGIS macOS
packaging. Can someone share the latest info?

Thanks,
Anthony DeBarros

Hi Anthony,
it doesn't seem to be available from direct download on qgis.org but,
please see https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/ (hoping that someone will
summarize the info and link at a more discoverable place)

Depends.  If you're using a distribution that doesn't have the necessary
dependencies for the newer version, the newer version will never reach the repo
for that distribution.

But you'll still get the notification about the latest version and in this case
it just means that you not only have to upgrade QGIS to get it.

you can also install qgis from the osgeo homebrew repositories which uses
homebrews python

brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
brew install osgeo-qgis

be aware that the installation takes a long time (> 2 hours on my laptop) to
install and uses plenty of packages

I might do it, for the OSGeo hosted drone setup. But we need more
build slaves to allow for that as I know QGIS tests are very heavy
to run for our poor little drone agents.

How about this deal: I'll setup Dronie for QGIS Gitea mirror IFF
you guys provide one or two Drone agents.
See https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Dronie#Drone_agents

We had a discussion about this and since the tool-style window will be on
top and the 3D map view is also on top, they will "fight". I tried a little
experiment with another tool window, and the result is the window is merged
in a tab style window.

We also feel the same, but it seems for this GSoC project, that's the best
way I can go since we have time limitation. Hopefully, we can make it
better later.


Nice progress Ismail, keep up the great work!


Thanks, Nyall

Best regards.

And for that reason, just use docker, and you don't have that problem. 
 ( instead, you might have others ;)   )

Works fine for me with MSSQL-Server 2017 & Viber on Ubuntu 19.04, with OpenSSL 1.1.

Depends.  If you're using a distribution that doesn't have the necessary dependencies for the newer version, the newer version will never reach the repo for that distribution.

But you'll still get the notification about the latest version and in this case it just means that you not only have to upgrade QGIS to get it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pb QGIS 2.18 / pyuic4
Message-ID: <65234900-8f78-64b0-77c3-c5d67307ea36@espaces-naturels.fr>

Hello,

I've got problems with an old development environment, that I use to 
maintain my plugins.

I want to compile a QGIS plugin that I created myself.

I'm working with QGIS 2.18 and I've got an error with pyuic4 and a UI file :

My version of pyuic4_ : 4.12.1

*The message error**: *

Makefile:52: recipe for target 'ui_bdtravaux_sortie.py' failed
make: *** [ui_bdtravaux_sortie.py] Error 1


And *the **debug text*: (pyuic4 -d ui_bdtravaux_sortie.ui)

*************************************************

ValueError: API 'QDate' has already been set to version 1

**************************************************


I've use my plugin for years, but I have recently changed my computer 
(and reinstalled all my development environment), and the error appeared.

I wrote to pyuic4 support, and this is their answer :

/"//This is a qgis bug. They change the API version which is unsupported 
in production code."/

Is there a way to bypass this bug with these pyuuic4 and QGIS versions?

Thanks for advance

Vincent Damoy

Hi Tim,

With Raymond we are planning on using your great ester egg data in the 
overview box within map layouts.
I am looking for the license of the data,  do you perhaps know it / know 
where to find it?
Or does it fall under QGIS' license?

Thanks,

Best Regards,
Aron Gergely

I am also a fan of the ester egg, learned it from Raymond.

Hello all

We all know that migrating to Github was a big decision. We know there were
significant pros and cons, and that various core devs strongly disagreed
with the decision. A clearer case of pragmatism versus idealism is not easy
to find...

However, the decision *was* made. Can we all now concentrate our efforts on
helping each other get used to the new environment, rather than
accusing/defending Redmine, or raking over the arguments about proprietary
services?

I say this with all due respect. I very much see both sides on this one. But
the decision has been made.

Thanks

Tom

Hi

If I am not mistaken, the world map comes from Nathan Woodrow (he added it for the projection selector widget):

[timlinux at sandstone ~/dev/cpp/QGIS/resources/data (master)]$ git log world_map.shp
commit cf241f51ae2ae4ae225c9af65690aa2a5524df04
Author: Nathan Woodrow <madmanwoo at gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 16 10:40:05 2017 +1000

    [FEATURE][needs-docs] Show projection bounds in projection widget (#5356)
    
    - Script to pull bounds from EPSG.org Postgres dump
    - Add resources/data/world_map.shp for reference
    - Show canvas bounds for reference

I’m guessing it comes from Natural Earth, but he would need to confirm. Nathan can you add a license for that file?

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] XYZ Tile source url from TOC
Message-ID: <531db508-e4e5-426a-0e6e-0731b84a544f@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

if I don't get wrong Tile Layers are QgsRasterLayers objects.

Is there any method to grab from the loaded raster layer in the legend
the same url that is used to create the Tile in the Browser?

rl.source() gives the full url

'crs=EPSG:3857&format&type=xyz&url=http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png&zmax=19&zmin=0'

Thanks for any hint

Matteo

Where you see pragmatism and idealism is not obvious to me - nor why it's one
or the other.

github's ticket system is better integrated into github for sure, but whether
it's the better ticket system still needs to be proven.  And if it isn't, we
cannot integrated anything better - even if we wanted.  Still a lot of work was
invested to migrate from a ticket system, that was also working.

If you think the migration to github is pragmatic and sticking with the
previous working solution would have been "just" idealistic - which would be my
interpretation - then I disagree.

It's true: the decision has been taken and the migration has been done.  We
have to live it whether we like it or not - and maybe those who don't like it,
will learn to - we'll see.

There were pros and cons and even different opinions on what's what.  The
easiest way to end this discussion is to stop adding fuel to the fire by
unnecessarily reiterating still disputable or wrong arguments (eg. mantra,
pragmatism versus idealism).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Bug Squash party
Message-ID: <ac4596e1-1a23-3255-df83-594d961f54ca@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

We changed our bug tracking tool. One of the goals is to have more
people doing bug triage, confirming bug reports, providing examples,
screenshots and so on. We need more [power] users involved and more
developers on the “bug triage” team.

Let’s take advantage of all these discussions around the tool and the
changes introduced, to focus on what is really important: to have more
people involved in QGIS testing to provide more stable releases. To tool
is not the goal.

We need to clean up our bug/feature request queue. We already had good
proposals here on the list, regarding cleaning old issues and pointing
to new policies regarding issue lifetime. We just need more action!

Proposal

My proposal is to publish a post on our blog calling for a huge QGIS Bug
Squash party, for two days, making all users aware of this new tool and
calling them for this activity. We can ask them (for example) to
selected 5 issues they can improve, by providing more feedback
(confirming a bug report in current 3.x version, for example) or by
subscribing a feature request they found important.

To provide live support for all users involved in the party, I would
like to create a Doodle to make sure we have at least one developer
available on IRC/Gitter (for the all 48 hours) where people can discuss
what to do with ticket X. Each developer would subscribe a 4 hour period
(that’s the usual watchkeeping period for sailors).

I also would like to propose to the PSC/this developer list that current
committers can have the “triage” role on qgis/QGIS - upon request - to
have more people doing bug triage. Régis and Saber already mentioned
this limitation regarding issue management and both are well known
contributors (and Saber can follow 3D tickets ;-)) For those seeking to
join the “bug triage” team, they just need to have a PR committed (and
they will be rewarded).

QGIS Bug Squash party goal

If we need to define a goal, it would be: cleanup 2/3 of the queue (and
keep the queue below 1000 issues).

Comments

Please provide comments about this proposal. For the exact dates for the
party, I suggest 14 and 15 (next week) to have a regular working day
(for those able to work on QGIS on their daily jobs) and Saturday, for
the ones only working on their spare time.

Regards,

J. Gustavo

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtGQD+90QZF34MCcx8gSMgJDJCm97A_fO04aku0tDbnXbA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

Here is my 2st-week report for my GSoC Project. You can read this report
better with image and GIF in the weekly report wiki [4]. You can also check
the project wiki page [3]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 2 Report

*Period*: 3 June 2019 - 9 June 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Implement all functionalities of the on-screen navigation
   - Screenshot

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1421861/59020256-e788c080-8849-11e9-9d66-a2be03365e8f.png

   - Make a PR  [1] for it (and update it according to the PR review,
thanks Nyall for reviewing it)

2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Starting working on the measurement tool, already discuss with mentors
for the initial steps:
      - implement a concrete class of 3D map tool to understand how it can
get the clicked position
      - use a temporary line layer to store the clicked position then we
can render it to show in the 3D map view.
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Previously yes, regarding customizing QDial. Fortunately, I found
QwtDial that has an easier way to customize. Even better, there is
QwtCompas that offers what I wanted.
4. Code
   - My code for this feature is in this PR [1]
   - Branch in my repo [2]
5. Misc
   - N/A

Olá Jorge,
I fully agree with your proposal. Limited attempts in the past have
given good results. I think more time should be allowed to let people
organize.
Cheers.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for the feedback. You are right. The time is short, for sure. I
was trying to do it before our next release on June, 21th.

What do you think? Should we do it before the 3.8 release? Maybe on
June, 18-19? Or should we postpone it to prepare it more carefully and
get more visibility?

Regards,

Jorge

Hi Ismail


Looking great! I was wondering: Couldn’t you render 3d objects in the scene that act as the controls? My idea was that you have them anchored e.g. in the bottom right of the screen and always fixed in position even when you are rotating etc. the rest of the scene. Then when you click on one of the navigation objects you just send the same signals you would be sending from your Qt widget based approach?

Regards

Tim

Hi Jorge,
I understand your aim. I think it is important to mage distributed bug
squashing parties a regular feature of our community, so better start
now, even if ideally I would wait one month after announcement. Maybe we
can have a calendar of future BSPs just after freeze for each version?
Or just for LTR, not to wear out volunteers too early?
Cheers.

Hi Aron, Alessandro,
I agree this would be an useful addition to qgis. Alessandro, I don't
remember the details of the reasons why this should not be included: do
you have a pointer to the discussion?
Thanks.

Nice progress.

I feel it'd be really important to figure out a way to creating some
floating controls here, the current approach eats so much space it'll
likely be unusable with docked 3d maps.

Hi Tim and Mathieu,

Yes, that issue was a blocker in week 1 [1]. I have discussed with Martin
and Peter. Martin suggests 3 alternatives for it:

   1. Using QtQuick --> Adding dependencies, it will need to go through QEP
   and so on
   2. Render it as a 3D object (like Tim said) --> too much work
   3. Doing as normal QWidget (like current implementation, the alternative
   that we chose)

I also feel that the current implementation is not what I expect. The first
proposal was also a floating widget. Unfortunately, I didn't know that it's
not possible by using QWidget on top of Qt3DWindow at that time I wrote the
proposal.

Here I am not sure what will happen (e.g. is current work mergeable or
not). Perhaps if I had some extra time left at the end of the GSoC project
timeline (I put some small buffer time) I can try to go with the 2nd
alternative.

Maybe Martin or Peter have some comments about this?

Anyway, thanks for the feedbacks, Tim and Mathieu!

Hi,
Good idea Jorge. But I also find next week too short. And think it would be better after release; there are likely more users that could update to 3.8 than 3.7 Dev version, most appropriate versions to test issues.
So we make the call, we spread in language communities and all channels, we help and ensure that all main OSs have updated to 3.8 quickly and a week or two after release, let's massively test. And 3.10 as LTR can be an interesting and hearable argument. So I'm not fond of doing for each release and let's see how this one plays yet.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,

I have a SpatiaLite (
https://www.dropbox.com/s/4dtkpmlyhs741bn/geolife-beijing.sqlite?dl=0) with
string fields that contain timestamps in %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S format. However,
if I access the min or max values through the provider, the format changes
to  %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S

p = l.dataProvider()
p.minimumValue(2)
'2008/11/11 00:38:00'


This messed up TimeManager
https://github.com/anitagraser/TimeManager/issues/218

Would you consider that a bug? Should I open a ticket?

Anita

Funnily enough, I was thinking of a similar thing shortly after the
github transition and also came to the same figure as an achievable
goal.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to update change the datasource of already
	existing layer
Message-ID: <CACb3BPysfDowMtEpJu72g9K_NtSeTxdp2hHoiKBC+=rOW12MWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


Can you give me some idea why I'm getting two uids in the layer's source?
And also how I can fix this because now the layer just disappears from the
map canvas. (all layers are isValid() = True)

oldLayer.source()
#
MultiLineString?crs=EPSG:32737&field=fid:integer(0,0)&uid={6cd1f176-9c05-4d2a-961a-3143a8fa422b}

newLayer = processing.run('save:selectedfeatures', {
    'INPUT': oldLayer,
    'OUTPUT': 'memory:newLayer'
)

oldLayer.setDataSource(newLayer.source(), oldLayer.name(),
newLayer.dataProvider().name())

newLayer.source()
#
MultiLineString?crs=EPSG:32737&field=fid:integer(0,0)&uid={d36aff88-4248-4ffb-be2f-2ac1891ac26d}
oldLayer.source()

# WRONG, I would expect the same as above. Also, the uid is completely new.
#
MultiLineString?crs=EPSG:32737&field=fid:integer(0,0)&uid={d36aff88-4248-4ffb-be2f-2ac1891ac26d}&uid={3422de07-cf38-4249-af55-23c7d9779daf}

As Ismail says, we have discussed that but couldn't come up with a simple
solution that would not take a lot of time. Both alternatives (rendering
controls with Qt3D / rendering controls with QtQuick) would be heavy on
extra code changes. 3D windows are quite special because they are being
rendered in a different way, so one can't just easily embed other QWidgets
on top of 3D window (and this will be probably OS-specific as well).

For the time being we could maybe make a good use of the space - e.g. show
coordinates of the points towards which the camera is looking or optionally
show some debugging information.

Cheers
Martin

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ2+-fkbu36Y3076vicE-Sv7Ne+UAtq=UfJbJuE_gcDOGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to make this python 3 code with OwsLib working.
In particular, I'm searching a road with the name starting by "VIA F.", but
QGIS Server returns me a road named VIA MATTEOTTI...

Does QGIS Server support PropertyIsLike in WFS?


#!/usr/bim/python3

wfs = WebFeatureService(url='https://cartografia.comunelavis.it/wms/cbase')

filt = PropertyIsLike(propertyname='nome_via', literal='VIA F.%',
wildCard='%', matchCase=False)
filterxml = etree.tostring(filt.toXML()).decode("utf-8")

feature = wfs.getfeature(typename=['Civici'], maxfeatures=1,

Addendum.

I discovered what problem was.

OWSLib generates an URL like this:

http:// ....WFSHOST .../&FILTER=<ogc:PropertyIsLike  wildCard="%"
singleChar="_" escapeChar="\"
matchCase="false"><ogc:PropertyName>nome_via</ogc:PropertyName><ogc:Literal>VIA
A%</ogc:Literal></ogc:PropertyIsLike>

but it seems that QGIS Server doesn't like this. We should add <ogc:Filter>
and </ogc:Filter> at start and the end of the FILTER value:

http:// ....WFSHOST .../&FILTER=<ogc:Filter><ogc:PropertyIsLike
 wildCard="%" singleChar="_" escapeChar="\"
matchCase="false"><ogc:PropertyName>nome_via</ogc:PropertyName><ogc:Literal>VIA
A%</ogc:Literal></ogc:PropertyIsLike></ogc:Filter>

with the last URL, the WFS query works!

This is a really nice easter egg and could be of great use for quickly
showing new users the differences of different crs in a course, if the
shape wastn't that full of topology errors :(

Isn't there maybe a less buggy shape available?

Message-ID: <d638636b9b0ce9b3e1b3f0c97b090967@carto.net>

Hi all, 

At my new work place we are running a 2.x QGIS server  which in two
projects behaves very strange: sometimes colors display in the color we
expected, sometimes really light. Then my colleagues discovered that
more than rules share the same UUID identifier, because the QGS files
have been copy pasted into a anew project and then aggregated again into
the same single project. 

Not knowing about the internals of QGIS server 2x (and 3x) I wonder if
this something we need to avoid? Are the UUID identifiers of a symbology
rule relevant and absolutely need to be unique? Do we have to avoid such
id clashes? 

The "human readable" nature of qgs/qml files naturally seduce people to
copy / paste and mix project stuff together in text editors ... 

Thank you for your feedback on this topic. 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,
Wow good catch finding the causes of such an issue!
I can't answer myself on the technical part.

> The "human readable" nature of qgs/qml files naturally seduce people to

Well, I don't quite agree here. Doing copy paste with our wml structure is
not human, it's a proof that human can be very ingenious :) !  I wouldn't
ever recommend that. I have just tried to play with git and diff for a long
time with QGS project files, and I wouldn't ever recommand to do that.
Replacing datasources is probably the only safe thing to do in this XML
file.
I would just wait to see if we see that ever again before tackling this.
Best regards
Régis

Hi Ivan,

Your code seems incomplete and has some syntax errors -- maybe it

I fixed it. Sorry for the inconvenience:

layer1 = QgsVectorLayer('Polygon?crs=epsg:32612', 'layer2', 'memory')
layer2 = QgsVectorLayer('Polygon?crs=epsg:32612', 'layer1', 'memory')

print(layer1.source())
print(layer2.source())
layer1.setDataSource(layer2.source(), layer2.name(),
layer2.dataProvider().name())
print(layer1.source())

If you can find a better one or want to clean it I will be happy to replace it. Just provide some metadata with it this time so we know the provenance.

Thanks!

A topologically more correct map is not easily to find, especially not 
in a tiny (shp) file size. Here are some links to examples:

http://www.statsilk.com/maps/download-free-shapefile-maps

But for educating CRS, for quickly finding out where your just opened 
dataset is, and for layout overview maps the current one is already very 
useful.

To improve it we could:
1. Generalize a correct map in a topological way
2. Remove all administrative boundaries from the current map to avoid 
people getting offended by disputed territories for example.

We should also watch out not to start shipping data packages with the 
software! Before we know there might be world boundaries at different 
scales and people starting to wonder why we do not provide cities, 
rivers, roads, coffee corners, ... :)

But a good resource platform (for data, svg, png, styles) in QGIS could 
make it easy to ship this kind of data in plugins and make it work for 
all users. Which was my original question.

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hey Tim,

Yes I yanked that file from Natural Earth and I think it might have
simplified it a little bit to reduce the file size but it's the same file.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Andreas,

It's a known issue. It is not easy to understand because it's due to 
SHADOW layers...
Some times, QGIS keeps some undisplayed layers with the same UUID and 
stored it in the QGIS project.

You can use Layer Board plugin to remove them.

Regards,
René-Luc

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How important are rule ids (keys) in QGIS project
	files?
Message-ID: <d08ce3210ed746b9641afbd74e0d09a6@carto.net>

Hi again, 

During our tests and investigations around rendering problems in QGIS we
found the following issue, which is really easy to reproduce: 

1. Create a layer (any vector source) 

2. Create a rule based symbology (e.g. by going through a
classification) 

3. Save qgs file 

4. Export style file of first layer 

5. Load the same layer as above in the project, so that the same layer
is loaded twice 

6. import the style from from point 4 and assign it to the second layer 

7. save qgis project file 

8. open the project file in text editor --> all rule keys now exist
twice. 

Now my question: will we run into problems because of these duplicated
rule keys? If this is a problem - why is QGIS not taking care about
making the rule ids unique by generating new uuid keys on importing the
qml style file? Is this a bug in QGIS? Or are all of these rule keys
totally irrelevant? If they are irrelevant, why do they exist in the
project? 

Thanks for the discussion, 

Andreas

Hi René-Luc, 

Thanks for the reply. Good to know that we are not the only ones
struggling with such issues. 

Is this known issue in QGIS 2.x only or also in QGIS 3.x? 

I will also have a look at the Layer Board plugin and see what it does
and how it could help us. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

We didn't yet find shadow layers in QGIS 3, but I don't think it has 
been fixed because it's a silent issue for desktop users.

agreed fully, the existing Resource Sharing plugin is the base for this.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Use of ORS tools and OSM in QGIS for an
	accessibility and mobility project
Message-ID: <CAPqKU2xYf82AC3DRgngHi-c_J+SWV4RUtQZOfXD=2f+sUhydsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
 I am working on a university project based on the use of funiculars and
elevators to create routes for people with mobility problems, such as a
wheelchair user. To implement well the funiculars I am using a data layer
of Open Street Maps, for the routes I am using the API of Open Route
Service, but I would like to know if this can be done, open route service
offers the functionality of routes for people in wheelchairs, but the
elevators are not used in the routes because they are not well implemented.
I've seen some video tutorials for QGIS but they are deprecated, they use
the OSM tools plugin which is now called ORS tools and they change a lot of
things.

Message-ID: <B3874F330966F240B6BE9E50B80742FB018B51F3FC@SRV-EXCH-DAG-02.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

Am I able to catch Python exceptions in Python console?

I'm trying to debug a DB Manager related issue [1] using pg_services. I have the following piece of code, that runs fine in my computer, but fails on any other computer, within a specific intranet.

import psycopg2
print (psycopg2.__version__)
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(service='pg_trabalho')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    print ( connection.get_dsn_parameters(),"\n")
    cursor.execute("SELECT version();")
    record = cursor.fetchone()
    print("Connected to - ", record,"\n")
except:
    print( psycopg2.InterfaceError )
    print( psycopg2.OperationalError )

When I run it, QGIS crashes [2]. I would prefer to handle the exception myself. How can I catch the exception without crashing QGIS?

This crash isn't caused by a Python exception -- it's something
deeper. If it was just a Python exception you'd see exactly the same
results as something like

    a = [1]
    print(a[2])

Unfortunately, these kinds of crashes can be extremely difficult to
diagnose (especially if they are only reproducible on Windows). If you
can reproduce on Linux, I'd suggest running under valgrind and looking
for clues.

I agree that the results of this output look odd - but what exactly
are you trying to achieve here?

Hi, Nyall,

I'm developing a plugin with a lot of internal layers, that are being
(re)created on user interaction.

There are multiple event listeners attached to a layer, as well as passed
around to different functions and might have custom styles. At some point,
I want to replace the layer entirely with another one (result from an
algorithm).

To solve this, I came up with three solutions, maybe there are more:
One option to achieve this is to copy all the features from the new layer
and put them in the first one, but the layers might be very big and I'm
afraid it would be a problem.
The second option that I'm currently using is to recreate all the event
listeners on the new layer and replace it from the layer tree. This is
okayish and it works.
The third option is to set a new data source, as I thought it's the most
optimal one, however, when the layer has two uids it's practically broken.

I got some inspiration from here:
https://github.com/enricofer/changeDataSource/blob/master/setdatasource.py#L175-L206
directly editing the XML but the result is the same - double ids. I checked
this plugin because I'm sure it used to work in 3.2 (currently having 3.6.3
on Ubuntu).

Best,
Ivan

Hi Nyall,

This problem only happens in Windows. In Linux, everything is running fine.

I was convinced that it was a Python exception, but for some reason, it
was not caught.

I will investigate this issue further. It makes me crazy!

Thank you for the feedback,

Jorge

Well, this approach will work perfectly fine for everything BUT memory
layers. The features from memory layers can't be shared between two
layers, so resetting the data source here really doesn't have any
meaning. There's just no way to duplicate a memory layer except for
copy all the features and adding to a new layer.

Welcome to the wonderful world of Python bindings. When they work --
it's magic. When they don't -- get ready to kiss goodbye two weeks of
wasted time and half your remaining hair.

Okay, thanks, all clear now.

Maybe documenting that setDataSource is useless in case of memory layers
would prevent future questions like this.
Thanks again!

Sure -- pull requests with code documentation notes like this will
always be very welcome! (Send them in *whenever* you hit anything you
think "that should have been mentioned in the API docs")

Hello list,

I submitted a new plugin about two weeks ago to the plugin portal, that one: 
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/coordinator/
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/coordinator/>  

I was somehow hoping this would have been approved by now, but it isn't. Is
there an estimate when new plugins are approved? I totally understand that
the approval process is run by volunteers and if it just takes its time
thats perfectly fine! But i just want to make sure everything is OK and i
didn't do something wrong or missed a step.

Thanks
Jonas

Escuse me, on June 2, 2019 I uploaded a new version of Spatial
Sustainability Assessment Model (SSAM)plugin but It's still not approved.
Are there problems I haven't seen?
Thanks you

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] CRS troubles (QGIS 3.6.3, Proj 6.1.0)
Message-ID: <855dd255-45fd-441c-2dd5-d1ed0f858041@comhem.se>

Hi QGIS developers

I am writing to this list in the hope of finding some clues about the 
following problem. This has also been presented in the user list (*).

I have built 3.6.3 from source against proj 6.1.0 and GDAL 3.0.0. None 
of which had any problems during build. Even Proj 6.1.0 test suite 
passes perfectly. However, the newly built QGIS has troubles with the 
CRS list in that a lot of the usual systems are either missing or have 
changed names. For example, the usual EPSG:4326 is called IGNF:WGS84G. 
Others are just plainly missing and those in my projects are replaced by 
some "user defined" designation. There are also problems when trying to 
display a WMS service since the CRS available at the service seem to go 
unrecognized. This is regrettable since this turns QGIS large unusable 
for me.

It might be interesting to note that both QGIS "make" and  "make 
install" complain that

proj_create: crs not found

On the other hand, both GDAL and GRASS, that are dependent on Proj do 
not seem to have any problems with Proj 6.1.0.

I have compiled many times, both 3.6.2. and 3.6.3 and I am having the 
same problem everytime. I wonder if this is happening due to some local 
problem in my installation (fresh openSUSE 15.1 install) or some glitch 
due to recent changes in proj.

Is this a known issue?

Any hint will be appreciated!

Thanks in advance, and thanks for your efforts in developing this great 
tool!

H.

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtG4DPbGqPEdY=sQ3iJeFd-ytg+2rVMLT9-y77whoyyntA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

Here is my 3rd-week report for my GSoC Project. You can read this report
better with image and GIF in the weekly report wiki [4]. You can also check
the project wiki page [3]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

# GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 3 Report

*Period*: 10 June 2019 - 16 June 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Implement a concrete class of 3D map tool to understand how it can get
the clicked position
   - Use a temporary line layer to store the clicked position
   - Render the line but still has some problem (see blocker)
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Fixing the rendering issue
   - Implement measurement tool window (re-use the 2D version if possible)
   - Polish the functionalities
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Yes, the line is rendered but the color is random and rendered as 2D.
The line will be gone if I hide/show another line [2].
     ![Rendering Problem](

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] SSL Performance Overhead
Message-ID: <b8080fff-d68b-c83e-aa8e-02612bdf1d22@opengis.ch>

Hi,

The documentation currently promises "massive speed-ups in PostGIS layer 
rendering" with SSL disabled. [1]

I find some references to performance cost of SSL but they should be 
compensated for with connection pooling which we use for quite some time 
already.

Recently, the web is more and more encrypted - and that is very good! - 
so I think we should also start to encourage people to encrypt their SSL 
connections. Or at least certainly not discourage them from using 
encryption by promising performance benefits.

Is there anyone who knows why this sentence was introduced? And if there 
is (still) an issue with performance when using SSL?

Best regards

Matthias

Hi, 

I would say, that the use of SSL should be encouraged if the connection
goes through public networks. If the Postgis connection is within the
company LAN I don't see a strong reason for enabling SSL, unless the
company LAN is designed in an "unsafe" way, or if sensitive data must be
hidden from other employees in the same company. 

Personally, I never had good results (performance wise) if Postgis
connections went through the public Internet, unless it is some "toy
data". 

For this reason, I usually used streaming replication to replicate
Postgis, so it is as close as possible to the users who need the data.
The streaming replication, if it goes through the public internet, of
course should use SSL (or often it goes through an SSH tunnel). 

Sorry, I don't have any data on the overhead of SSL connections though.

The "Package Layers" Processing algorithm is a nice tool to pack and store a

But I really miss, to have the styles saved in the Geopackage too - will it
be possible?

It's your lucky day! (Well, lucky week). When 3.8.0 comes out later
this week it has this added functionality already.

As Jurgen has commented on the pull request already, we have figured
out that QGIS was taking a lot more time to access features from a
local PostgreSQL database compared to some other app (uDig?). I have
dug out an old mail with the measurement - the difference was ~12
seconds to fetch data in QGIS vs ~4 seconds to fetch data in the other
app. In the end we figured out that disabling encryption removed that
penalization. All that was back in 2009 :-)

Unless there have been some improvements in the server/client lib, I
think the promise of massive speed up is still valid... And as Andreas
mentions, most(?) of the time people use the DB on a local network, so
it should not be a big deal to send data on local network unencrypted.

For the record, sending unencrypted data over a local network isn't safe as
soon as WIFI is part of said local network.

If this is a problem - why is QGIS not taking care about making the rule ids unique by generating new uuid keys on importing the qml style file? Is this a bug in QGIS? Or are all of these rule keys totally irrelevant? If they are irrelevant, why do they exist in the project?

Rule key IDs are there to identify rules within a single layer. A rule
key being repeated in a different layer should do no harm. From what I
recall, the reason behind having rule keys is mainly to be able to
have unique identification for legend - e.g. if user enables or
disables a rule, we know which one it is based on the rule key
(otherwise we would need to use indexes of rules which are likely to
change when rules get added/removed/rearranged).

Hope that helps....

Wouldn't connection pooling be such a change. That certainly was

Pooling was introduced to deal with multi-threaded rendering and
should not affect that. There always was a connection that was kept
alive while layer(s) using that connection existed.

Interesting.

I still can't see any good explanation for the overhead detected 10 
years ago, do you have an idea what this could be caused by?

I just can't imagine that an enterprise level database like postgres 
would suffer from such an issue on the security side.

Hey all,
sorry to intrude, but I have a bit of related information.
GeoServer uses the same underlying stack as QGIS, at one point we noticed
that the
reading performance went down, upon investigation it turned out the JDBC
driver
started using SSL by default when available.

So we added a flag to turn off SSL and it indeed helped performance (but
not 10 times mind,
maybe 20-30% on OSM like map like the one rendering at geoserver.org, did
not try on simpler/smaller maps).
This was a few months ago, not 10 years ago, so yes, SSL encrypt/decrypt is
still indeed taking a toll.

Cheers
Andrea

One of our customers (Swiss National Bank) mandates the use of SSL in their internal LAN, even for DB connections.
Using anything but SSL is an insecure mode of communication, even in LAN.
RSA/DSA Accepted key-length is 2048 bit, recommended is 3072, ECC is 160 Bit, recommended 256.


-          Only latest version of OpenSSL allowed

-          Accepted TLS 1.1+, recommended TLS 1.2+

-          SSL Version 3.0 or older are explicitly forbidden

-          Sha-1 is disallowed, sha2/3 accepted @ hash length 256 Bit

-          Extended Validation certificates have to be used

Hi,

I would say, that the use of SSL should be encouraged if the connection goes through public networks. If the Postgis connection is within the company LAN I don't see a strong reason for enabling SSL, unless the company LAN is designed in an "unsafe" way, or if sensitive data must be hidden from other employees in the same company.

Personally, I never had good results (performance wise) if Postgis connections went through the public Internet, unless it is some "toy data".

For this reason, I usually used streaming replication to replicate Postgis, so it is as close as possible to the users who need the data. The streaming replication, if it goes through the public internet, of course should use SSL (or often it goes through an SSH tunnel).

Sorry, I don't have any data on the overhead of SSL connections though.

I find some references to performance cost of SSL but they should be compensated for with connection pooling which we use for quite some time already.

Recently, the web is more and more encrypted - and that is very good! - so I think we should also start to encourage people to encrypt their SSL connections. Or at least certainly not discourage them from using encryption by promising performance benefits.

Is there anyone who knows why this sentence was introduced? And if there is (still) an issue with performance when using SSL?

Hi Stefan, 

Yes, sure. If I were a bank or the national bank I would also mandate
use of SSL. Also, when personal data is involved. But many gov
authorities have primarily publically available geoinformation (object
data, no personal data) in their DBs and no sensitive data. 

We are just discussing the defaults, anyone can enable SSL if it is
useful or required in their usage scenario.

Great progress again Ismail!

Do you think you'll bump into the same widget-over-3d issue as you
encountered earlier here?

How are you planning on doing the actual 3d length calculation? AFAIK
there's no API in core for this yet (but there really should be!).

	(QtWebKitWidgets vs QtWebEngineWidgets)
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3MN+aRj9emSx797V-odcoZ6iDVnjRO69F+wWReAF8-Pw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

As far as I understood :
- qgis.PyQt.QtWebKitWidgets is not available for some users (e.g. on mac),
as it is was deprecated from Qt, and is only provided through qgis's Qt
which apparently isn't the case on all platforms (see
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-qgis2web-and-qtwebkit-td5378226.html
and
many others reports)
- PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets is not always available either, and even when
available, it is unusable (see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/26048 ->
recommends to use QtWebKitWidgets )

So I am correct understand this leaves us with no cross-platform and
reliable way to display browser widgets in PyQGIS ?
Or did I miss something?

Thanks !!

Olivier

Uh, ah, yea, also, sending a password for a DB-user over the intranet-network in plain text is rather bad. 
While the data retrieved from the DB might not be confidential, maybe there is confidential data in the db. 
Also, the login used could have permissions onto another DB that has confidential data inside. 

In my opinion, the default should be SSL, including in intranet.  
If anybody changes the default for performance reasons, they can, and correspondingly, the blame will be theirs if anything happens. 
Nowadays, we use SSL even in development. 
Just my 0.05 $

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Suggestion to integrate MCG image segmentation in
	QGIS
Message-ID: <CACJcZHs6nmz50EVU7+sn1yDGD1Vqg6_CJ5vbY9EtQMnU0JaJ=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

For my PhD research, I have developed the BoundaryDelineation QGIS plugin
that aims to facilitate manual digitization from remote sensing imagery. As
an input, it requires object outlines obtained through image segmentation.
I have tested different image segmentations in QGIS, but found that
external approaches from computer vision provide better object outlines.
For the purpose of cadastral mapping that requires to digitize along roads,
buildings, rivers, fences, etc., I obtained accurate contours around
visible objects from drone, aerial and satellite imagery with Multiscale
Combinatorial Grouping (MCG) from Berkeley University. The code is open
source (
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/mcg/#).
However, it is partly pre-compiled for Matlab and does not work under
Windows. In order to keep the geo-reference of input images, I have added
two small scripts (
https://github.com/SCrommelinck/Delineation-Tool/tree/master/v3.0/1_image_segmentation).
Here is a video that shows MCG results on rural aerial imagery as well as
the use of the plugin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrDv8fW53Fs. MCG
results on peri-urban drone imagery can be seen here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12586

If this image segmentation would be included in QGIS, a user would not rely
on processing input data externally before being able to use the
BoundaryDelineation plugin. Furthermore, QGIS would incorporate and
facilitate the use of a state of the art computer vision image
segmentation. Segmenting an image into larger objects is an often applied
first step in many mapping and classification procedures.

My question is how to check whether someone would be interested to
implement MCG in QGIS. My own programming skills are not elaborated enough.
Should I open a feature request here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues,
or is posting my suggestion to this mailing list the way to go?

Best,

Sophie

Thanks, Nyall, Tim, and Luca

Do you think you'll bump into the same widget-over-3d issue as you
> encountered earlier here?


Yes, but I think the measurement dialog does not need to be always on top
(not like the navigation widget).  The difference :

- Both the navigation widget and the 3D map view must be seen when using
the navigation widget
- Measurement dialog can be below the 3D map view while using it, and the
user can see it after that.

So, it the limitation of QWidget on 3DWindows won't be a problem in this
case.

How are you planning on doing the actual 3d length calculation? AFAIK
> there's no API in core for this yet (but there really should be!).


Yeah, I stumble on that one. There is no measure between QgsPoint (but QGIS
has for QgsPointXY). I think I found another missing stuff related to
QgsPoint, but I forget.

I agree that we need to have this feature (it's natural to have one). I
tried to implement it actually. But, after the discussion with Martin, we
will do a simpler approach first by calculating the euclidean distance in
the map unit. From here, we will convert to another unit.

Thanks for the feedback Nyall

Best regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] translate plugin gui and log messages
Message-ID: <CAFFLmW+KcnDqkb3-BrQ4kBi8jG5LtdVvSYA=YWLaEf4pj=Gpbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I want to translate both the gui and all the log messages of my plugin in a
certain language (e.g. Italian). I'm using Qt Creator and Qt Linguist.
I created a plugin.pro file which contains all the file with text strings
that have to be translated (i.e. my .ui and .py files). Then I used Qt
Creator to generate the plugin_it.ts file and I modified this file with Qt
Linguist generating at the end a .qm file.
The translation of the gui (file .ui) works fine but I have problems with
the translation of the log messages in the .py file.
I marked all the strings that I want to translate putting them inside the
tr() function but Qt Linguist does not seem to recognize them as strings to
be translated.
Messages are simple text string appended to a QTextBrowser widget.

The plugin was initially created with the Plugin Builder, therefore I have
a tr() function, I have imported QTranslator and all the rows created by
Plugin Builder regarding translation have not been modified.

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance,
Roberta

Hi Roberta,

You do not mention using the pylupdate program, you should use that to 
create the ts files, because only this way you extract the text strings 
from the python files. Qt Creator does not care about the python scripts 
at all.

see
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html?highlight=plugin#ts-file
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/i18n.html


Cheers

Jonas

Hi Roberta,

well the process is pretty easy and straightforward.

I use the Makefile to manage all the process [0].

Basically the steps are:

* adding a list to locales in the Makefile, like: LOCALES = en it nl
* always in the Makefile add all the paths to the files that contains
the string you want to translate (managed by the self.tr() method):

SOURCES = \
	__init__.py \
	plugin.py plugin_dialog.py

UI_FILES = plugin_base.ui

* now you can use make transup to create the ts file in all the languages
* translate using the software you prefer
* compile the ts in qm using make transcompile

That's it. Whenever you add/change something in the files/UI you have to
run make transup again, translate, recompile

Cheers

Hi Sophie

Interesting and useful work, congratulation!
About computer vision integration libraries, IMHO a good solution is that
used by https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/enmapboxplugin/ pluign that
integrate scikit in a flexible way. IMHO can be the architecture to
integrate opencv algs and more.

Not clear to me what would be the best strategy to attract developer to
integrate MCG in qgis... IMHO can be integrated as in EnMap plugin via
processing provider => QEP wouldn't the best option because I do not feel
the alg could be a core algorithm more than a useful tool added via a
processing provider plugin.

IMHO your work is really useful for a lot of companies I hope your email
can move their interest to contribute to QGIS.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Preferred way to set startup options on Windows
 and is qgis_global_settings.ini used or not
Message-ID: <b33b744e-59cc-4f80-b047-ab4f7daedc29@duif.net>

Investigating a way to install QGIS in a large organisation, I'm looking
into the options to centrally setup some options.

As QGIS has a lot of configuration options, see:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html

it is pretty easy on a linux computer to set these options (either as
alias or just from the command line).

BUT: I miss (or I cannot find it) in our docs the best way to do this on
Windows? In qgis2 there was the qgis.bat file in which you could add
stuff, but nowadays (at least in the msi installer) the startup seems to
point to a qgis-bin.exe or qgis-bin-g7.exe file?
OR should I not use the options but the environment variables? And then
put them in qgis-bin.env?
I see there is still a qgis.bat ?? Is that used in the msi install (or
for the osgeo4w install)?
Or should I edit "Target" in the Window start thingie properties?

( a pointer to the docs is also ok :-) )

About qgis_global_settings.ini, in the above mentioned docs it is written:

--globalsettingsfile option
Using this option, you can specify the path for a Global Settings file
(.ini), also known as the Default Settings. The settings in the
specified file replace the original inline default ones, but the user
profiles’ settings will be set on top of those. The default global
settings is located in
your_QGIS_PKG_path/resources/qgis_global_settings.ini.

But what is this qgis_global_settings.ini in my install folder?
Is it used? (I do not think so, as if I change the content of it and
start a new profile, I cannot find my edits)
Or is it only meant as a 'template' for admins to use WHEN then use the
--globalsettingsfile option?

If the first: how?
If the last: I will then proably add some comments into this ini file,
and maybe rephrase the docs which talks about 'inline default ones'??

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

In preparation for a release of Boundless Desktop 2, which would be based
on QGIS 3 (I don't know nothing about it now) we prepared some
documentation for system administrators. See if any of this helps:

https://github.com/boundlessgeo/desktop-documentation/tree/master/docs/source/system_admins

BTW, I am not sure if any of this was specific of the product or if it
should work with any version of QGIS.

Hope it helps.

Alex

PS: Let me know if any of this is valid for our the official QGIS release.
If so, I would love to put it on our docs. (I think we miss a section like
this, just for system administrators)

This has been covered a few times on StackOverflow.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/548029/how-much-overhead-does-ssl-impose
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149274/http-vs-https-performance

Basically, the expensive part is creating the connection (handshaking). 
After that, when using the connection the overhead should be minimal. 
Given this I'd suggest the obvious starting point for investigating is 
to confirm it's not recreating the connection over-and-over.

Because it's a database connection it's unlikely there's a slow-down due 
to a lack of caching.

Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi Alexandre,

>From that docs, I think only the globalsetting.rst is still relevant.
And there is already info about it in the docs.

But I agree we should have more info for sysadmins, who have to deploy
QGIS in large scale environments, and have to set certain
connections/plugins/defaults etc etc

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] ProcessingAlgorithm: get filename of the INPUT
	param
Message-ID: <39892fbe-ba8f-f3d7-a361-8cfef1aa5723@duif.net>

Hi,

got a question from somebody who needed to find the filename of an input
param in a ProcessingAlgorithm
(because he is going to read that file again or something like that).

He adds the INPUT via the initAlgorithm function:

        self.addParameter(
            QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource(
                self.INPUT,
                self.tr('Input layer (.geojson)'),
                [QgsProcessing.TypeVectorLine]
            )
        )

And then tried to get the filename in the
processAlgorithm-implementation from the source via
self.parameterAsSource, but then could not find an uri/filename.

Via:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/280667/using-a-selected-layer-with-processing-in-qgis-3
I gave him:
l = self.parameterAsVectorLayer(parameters, 'INPUT', context)
feedback.pushInfo('l = {}'.format(l))
feedback.pushInfo('l.dataProvider() = {}'.format(l.dataProvider()))
feedback.pushInfo('l.dataProvider().uri() =
{}'.format(l.dataProvider().uri()))
feedback.pushInfo('l.dataProvider().uri().uri() =
{}'.format(l.dataProvider().uri().uri()))

which at least gives him the dataprovider uri WITH the filename.

Question:
1) isn't there an easier way, or is this the preferred way?
2) if the filename contains a space, then the uri().uri() only shows the
part AFTER the space (as if it was a relative path, but then the wrong
path...). Using a filename from a dir WITHOUT a space the uri().uri()
shows you the full file path.

TIA & Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I'm migrating a plugin to QGIS 3.x
I have this line of code that works in previous versions:
QgsProject.instance().snapSettingsChanged.emit()

But I cannot find this signal anymore in the new API.
I've been looking for another signal that does the same but didn't find.
Anyone can tell me how can I achieve the same with the new API?

Thanks

Nope,

SOURCE = <qgis._core.QgsProcessingFeatureSource object at 0x7fff684dcee8>

which (I think) does not bring you any further:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsProcessingFeatureSource.html

unless you 'materialize' it to a layer:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureSource.html

which is what I actually do below

Richard

l.source() perhaps?

Hi Matteo,
thank you for the help, your solution works fine in linux. Do you know if
something similar exists for Windows?

Thanks
Roberta

I am also interested in how you do this on Windows because I had a request
to add translation ability to the Shape Tools plugin, but these
instructions don't seem to include anything for Windows.

Thanks,

Calvin

You can just use the pylupdate5 script, its in 
%OSGeo4Win%\apps\Python37\Scripts

It loads your .pro file and creates the .ts files which you can open in 
QtLinguist. After translating you release within QtLinguist to a .qm file.

Hi All,

Of note from the Boundless docs repo is this little script I wrote to dump
existing settings to an .ini file:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/desktop-documentation/blob/master/docs/source/system_admins/qgis-settings-to-ini.py

Just load it into the Python Console's editor and run. It may need updated
a bit to be purely Python 3, for installs that don't have Python 2 around.

I think it should be added to QGIS src code repo, maybe under 'resources,'
and linked-to from QGIS docs. It is already GPLv2+ licensed.

Short answer -- it's not possible, and if you DO find a workaround, DON'T do it.

By design feature sources aren't layers, and the features coming from
a feature source may not even be associated with any layer at all. If
you need to get the path to a input file, you should be using a vector
layer parameter instead (but be very careful of thread safety issues,
and consider returning the FlagNoThreading flag for your algorithm to
ensure it's not crashy)

make transup and make transcompile just call bash scripts..... not sure
what the workaround could be in Windows. Doesn't Windows have a kind of
linux bash integrated?

Hello,

Perhaps it's overkill, but we can use Docker to run the script for managing
the translation (update, compile, and see how many untranslated strings).
You can find an example
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe/blob/develop/Makefile#L346

I find it easier even if I use Linux since I don't need to install the
required package to run the scripts one by one.

Unfortunately, installing Docker on Windows is not easy AFAIK, unless it's
Windows 10 Pro.

Best regards

But I think the osgeo4w.bat file under the osgeo4w install folder should be
enough. From what I can see, I can run bash commands inside (at least it
recognize "make" commands that the usual Windows cmd.exe ignores).

Hello all

I'm resurrecting this thread to find out whether there have been any
developments.

My situation: I'd like to tidy qgis2web's output via BeautifulSoup, lsxml,
or some such, but they are not installed (in my case under OSGeo4W). Is
there any cross-platform way of installing Python modules in a QGIS plugin?

Thanks

Tom

Hi all,
following Jonas suggestion to use pylupdate5 script, I finally found a
possible solution.
I have created a .bat file with the following lines (probably are obvious
for most of the dev community ;-)):

@echo off
call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\o4w_env.bat"
call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qt5_env.bat"
call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\py3_env.bat"

@echo on
pylupdate5 myPlugin.pro

The .bat file creates the .ts file correctly and then I modified and
released it with Qt Linguist.

Hope this helps!

Roberta

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changelog for 3.8! ARgh!
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj_SKF42SyMjOoA5LhhztzhSGDGiTbAjrArQzSrsVEtpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

It just struck me that we're finalizing 3.8 in < 24 hours, and our
visual changelog is.... completely non-existent. As in, we have NO
entries, and not even a version number created yet.

This is far from ideal, since the visual changelog is basically the
only way we have of informing users of all the lovely new toys we've
spent the last 4 months slaving away at making. If users don't even
know these exist, there's basically no point in writing them :(

In the past I've spent considerable time in the lead up to a release
trawling through the git logs and adding dummy entries for all new
features/stuff to highlight, which a handful of others have then spent
HOURS fleshing out into pretty/nicely readable entries. Unfortunately
I have no spare time to do that this round.

Suffice to say, I think it's clear that this process was never great,
and has totally broken down this time.

It seems to me like Matthias' grant proposal covering documentation
Pull Requests would tie in very nicely here. If that proposal is
successful, and he can get the contents of feature pull requests
pushed to documentation PRs, then it's a natural step to extend this
and also push the same feature PR descriptions automatically to the
changelog.

So I have some questions:
1. Matthias: Do you think this would be a possible extension of your
proposal? How much extra would you need to cover it?
2. Tim: Does the changelog API already exist which would make this
possible? OR if not, would it be tricky/costly to develop?
3. How can we make this a reality? Who needs payment, and who can make
this payment happen?

-- OR --

4. Who is going to take this on for future releases and ensure we have
a changelog ready to go at launch time?

and finally, the most pertinent question right now:

5. Who the heck can get a changelog in place for 3.8.0? Who has 2-3
days spare they want to volunteer into getting this in place?

Nyall

There's no blocking reason -- just no-one has coded it yet. It would
be a great starting point to contributing to QGIS code, as the changes
required are very self-contained and there's many developers who could
mentor this.

Alternatively, it's possible to extend QGIS expressions through
Python, so that's a possible approach too!

Hi Nyall,

Ouch, that's a real pity. Releasing the version without a changelog is a 
communication-GAU we should try to avoid.

As a first step I have just added the new version to projecta 
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/

I'll try to fill it up at least with some basics, but I won't be able to 
do it all on my own, so anyone else with a bit of spare time please jump 
in and fill the gaps!

If we ship the next release towards mid next week we should be able to 
put together something if everyone spends some time.


Now that this is sorted out:

Yes, I think it would make a lot of sense to integrate the changelog 
creation directly with labels into pull requests.

Since projecta is also based on markdown this should all play nicely 
together. And we could even add an (optional) #Changelog section to the 
pull requests and some other tags to automatically set funder etc. so 
one could already write the whole changelog entry during the development 
cycle. That should easily pay back with all the volunteer time that is 
saved during the already busy run up time to release!

Resource wise, most the allocated time in the grant proposal is for 
getting the service up and running and integrating with all the 
notification hooks. Parsing the content and sending it to another API 
should be pretty much straightforward. The main question would rather be 
if creation of new versions can also be automated and how to decide to 
which version a new feature should be sent (i.e. find out the "current" 
version). The best match for this would probably be to use github 
milestones. In the end I would say that this should increase the offer 
by 20%.

Tim, is everything ready on your end for that?

Best regards

Matthias

Yeah doing something like this was on our feature wish list. We could definitely add a githook to pop a new entry in - perhaps even get a screenshot if one was included in the PR message….

It would be great if we could get some financial support to do this, but otherwise Kartoza can donate some time. I’ve CC’d in Anita (Hapsari) who is the changelog maintainer so that she is aware of the discussion.

I think we can “volunteer” Admire from our company (who already helps Paolo as backup plugin repo admin) to get onto this.

So yes we would be happy to pitch in to help here. Admire can help more immediately by getting this changelog ready and we can work with Anita (Hapsari) to get things in place to support PR githook thing-a-me-doodahs. (See my reply to OP)

Hi Tom,

I totally agree. Having a nice way to install external packages would be
a great addition.

Some times ago I was involved in a project that needed external packages
and we developed an "in house" prototype, but it was far from ideal

Cheers

Matteo

Great! I started with the changelog, but it's not even close to 
finished, so whatever Admire gets too on Monday will be appreciated. And 
of course whatever others get to meanwhile!

Concerning the changelog, I think there are too possibilities:

   * Integrate it into the service we are going to set up if the grant 
proposal is accepted. This will already have some logic builtin to cover 
things like also reacting to labels added after the PR is merged etc.

   * Bypass the grant proposal service and directly hook into the github 
webhooks, which I think is what you propose.

I think the main advantage of the first one would be that it could be 
integrated in a single tool and since we would be working on it already 
it would be less effort. The second one would add some value to projecta 
if it can be used for other projects too.

I'm happy to step back if the second one is preferred.

Regards

Matthias

Hi Andrea,

Thanks a lot for this additional information. How many new connections 
are established in your scenario? I.e. can this be introduced by the 
additional roundtrips for handshake?


I just tried to reproduce this on QGIS here. And in my scenario I could 
not find any evidence for a performance impact. Without SSL I got 110 
seconds, with SSL I got 108 seconds (100 iterations). So even more 
performance (probably not on a statistically relevant level).

The only thing I can think of that I didn't measure in my tests were 
roundtrips (because the server was run locally).

I would like to raise this topic on stackexchange or the postgres 
mailing list to get some more insights. But it would be much easier to 
argue if I could provide a real world example of degraded performance.


Scenario:

   Docker container from the QGIS tests 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/travis/linux/docker-compose.travis.yml)

   docker-compose -f .ci/travis/linux/docker-compose.travis.yml up 
--build postgres

   # wget 
https://github.com/QGEP/datamodel/releases/download/1.3.0/qgep_v1.3.0_structure_and_demo_data.backup

   pg_restore -U docker -d gis -h 172.19.0.2 -1 
qgep_v1.3.0_structure_and_demo_data.backup

   Restart QGIS with ~/.pg_service.conf with

     - `sslmode=require`

     - `sslmode=disabled`

   Running the following snippet

import timeit
def get_features():
     for f in iface.activeLayer().getFeatures():
         pass print(timeit.timeit(get_features, number=100))

Best regards
Matthias

This seemed to work, but I have a question about translation. I first
created the english .ts file. I assume that someone then does a translation
of that file, but I notice in the XML that it has it tied to a line number.
What happens when I make a change to the code and the line number changes?
How is this all managed?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] KMZ Embedded Ground Overlays to QGIS
Message-ID: <CABPxTTo4HZVyP_3nXP7kYmhfCFYNY+F+1JUgsy1Kuo5VnBD1BQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am thinking about adding support for KML ground overlays in my KML Tools
plugin. The ground overlay specifies the latitude and longitude of each of
the 4 corners of the image being overlaid. I think that in order to make
this work I would need to extract the images from the KMZ file and come up
with the proper transformation to use with GDAL and create a GeoTIFF of
each file. The GeoTIFFs could then be loaded into QGIS

Do you have any suggestions on how to specify the transformation for GDAL?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bug triaging in github
Message-ID: <CABgOYCfcKTjwXfd1nDPPi0RemEbc3ftjHQiG=LmkpyC+BEJY=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I finally found time to spend half a day on bug triaging and have some
feedback and suggestions.

As expected, searching is faster and contributing to issues is a lot
faster. Searching is fast but less powerfull due to the need of playing
with label a lot. It quickly becomes necessary to store searches as browser
bookmarks, which was handled by redmine before.

Just like in gitlab, bug triaging is made a lot easier using kanban views,
which allow a more panoramic view, and helps with workflows, and
efflortless tag assignation just by dragging issues between columns.

As an illustration, we use this free addon for QWAT :
https://huboard.com/qwat/QWAT/#/
I never really used GitHub's project and found them less effective thant
gitlab's boards.
Huboard has some nice features like aggregating several repositories, or
saving the order of issues in columns, which does not requires additional
tags.

I think we could test  the following possible views (if the tools allow it)

- by priority
- by working state.
    - For features: wishlist / staged / doing / review / done
    - For bug:  raised / feedback / confirmed / low priority / high
priority / worked planned / work in progress / solved
- by milestone (for features) : not sure about this one assuming our fixed
release policy.


If our workflow tags are well designed, that shouldn't lead in adding too
much labels.

One last point, this does not tighten us more to github because gitlab
offers the same or more, and it relies almost only on tags and milestones
(except for issue ordering).

I'd like to play a bit with projects somewhere in a sandbox, what
permission level would that require?

Best regards

Régis

GDAL has a KMLSuperOverlay driver that can read *some* KML/KMZ formulations 
with ground overlays.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.8.0 on FreeBSD: build takes several hours
Message-ID: <46fd110e-b435-ce3f-359f-b7d460e74db4@gwdg.de>

As the maintainer of the QGIS port for FreeBSD, I am preparing a port
for the recent update to QGIS 3.8.0.

The build process takes a very long pause of several hours(!) at about
21% of the code, before it proceeds:

This seems to happen since #18fb3f2 [1] (committed 2019-05-13, submitted
2019-04-30). Before the commit, the build process takes a normal
duration on FreeBSD.

As far as I can say, the problem occurs with both proj-5.1.0 and
proj-6.1.0. GDAL version is 2.4.1, the OS is FreeBSD 13-0 CURRENT amd64.

Does anyone else observes something like this? I suspect, that the long
pause has do with a conversion problem into the proj db. What do you think?

Thanks for any help. And please let me know, if I should provide more
information or test something.

Best wishes,
Rainer Hurling

Hello Calvin,

take a look of GEarthView plugin, where I define all the four corners of image.
Normally, by default, KML ground overlay defines only minX,minY and maxX,maxY two points, but this is not enough for geo reference images that are not in 4326. 
So, you need to use the other settings of KML that permits to declare all the four corners. 
If you have not just done, install GEarthView plugin, and see what is the syntax of my doc.kml saved file. 

Best regards

Hi,

Big +1 for this.

I think it should come with clear guidelines for devs though (esp. how
to correctly specify versions to avoid conflicting requirements with
unnecessary pins).

If we want to support this, what about using a requirements.txt file
rather than the metadata file?

It's more or less a standard which has some benefits such as automatic
vulnerability alerts or dependency graph on GitHub.

Cheers,

Olivier

    Hi Tom,

    I totally agree. Having a nice way to install external packages would be
    a great addition.

    Some times ago I was involved in a project that needed external packages
    and we developed an "in house" prototype, but it was far from ideal

    Cheers

Message-ID: <CAEh5jtGRS9fH=WuwB-CYq29cLF_hPSVm7VXkY8eKbpkg54DNCA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers,

Here is my 3rd-week report for my GSoC Project. You can read this report
better with image and GIF in the weekly report wiki [6]. You can also check
the project wiki page [3]. Comments and suggestions are welcome :)

GSoC QGIS 3D Improvement Week 4 Report

*Period*: 17 June 2019 - 23 June 2019

*Report*
1. What did I complete this week?
   - Replicate UI from 2D measurement tool to the 3D measurement tool
dialog.
     Almost all functionalities are replicated, except:
     - Show help (the behavior is added, but since there is no chapter for
it currently. It's disabled for now)
     - Configuration (already started working on it, but time is quite
limited last week since I feel a little bit unwell last week)

     List of implemented behaviors can be found in [4]. You can see it on a
GIF [5].

)
   - Adding map tool for camera control in 3D view (similar to the Pan tool
in 2D view) to make it more consistent and easier to see what's the active
tool.
   - Change the cursor for 3D identify tool for consistency with 2D one.
   - Adding missing `QgsDistanceArea::MeasureLine3D` for `QgsPoint`, unit
test is added.
   - Trying to fix the rendering issue, but still no luck.
2. What am I going to achieve for next week?
   - Finish the configuration
   - Try again with the rendering issue
   - Wrap up PR if the all is finished (currently a draft)
   - Some testing
   - Start working on the 3rd feature, point as a billboard.
3. Is there any blocking issue?
   - Yes, the line is rendered but the color is random and rendered as 2D.
The line will be gone if I hide/show another line [2].

Thanks for the update Sunni! Do measurements happen in 3d too? For example if you measure to the top of a building do you get a different measurement compared to the base? Maybe you could show the Z elevation change at each measurement row and the total elevation change  in the total box?

Hope you are feeling better now!

Regards

Tim

Can you share the link again to your proposal?

Yes I was leaning towards a generic approach if possible, but let me read your proposal again and see how that fits in…

Thanks Toto

Its great that you want to help but a few screenshots without documentation will make the work more rather than less I fear. If you want to contribute, create an account on the changelog site and pop me a note and I will give you the needed permissions.

Also it will be better to have screenshots in English I think as the changelog gets pulled over to the documentation project where translations happen.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hmm - perplexing. Most of that commit should be ifdefed out for proj <
6 builds. I wonder if you tried trimming the contents of
qgscoordinatereferencesystem_legacy.h to just a couple of sample lines
as a test? Maybe there's something in the compiler which doesn't like
the large static QMap...

that is he job of the update_strings.sh script (at least, I think so).

Basically when you update something (code withing the self.tr() function
or UI), you should run the update_strings.sh script so that the old
string will stay translate and untouched while the new ones (or the
updated ones) will be available for translation.

The script can be run with make transup.

So the workflow should be:

* make transup
* translate
* make transcompile

updates in your plugin? Run the same commands again

BTW: you can mix this with transifex to mangage the translations only in
tx and pulling/pushing the strings from there.

Cheers

Matteo

Many thanks for your response.

After trimming the contents of qgscoordinatereferencesystem_legacy.h
(about 10 lines left), it builds in a normal time again.

So it is likely, that the problem on FreeBSD has something to do with
its compiler suite? I am using FreeBSD clang version 8.0.1
(branches/release_80 363030) (based on LLVM 8.0.1).

Is there any workaround, which lets me use the whole contents again?

You could try swapping the QMap for a std::unordered_map and see if
there's any benefit.

I am afraid I have no clue how to do this, because I am not a c++ coder.

Is it within qgscoordinatereferencesystem_legacy.h
(sAuthIdToQgisSrsIdMap?) or better in qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp
(at lines:386-405?).

As I said in my initial posting, the build duration problem exists on
both, proj 5.1.0 and 6.1.0 on FreeBSD ...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] grant proposal
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+YWdV6QFBU92G_-oPSoXjTFa+Ki6j2sMFRYukk_M8Sj_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to share my concern about the grant proposal and voting process. I
believe we have some serious weaknesses in this process, but sadly I don't
have perfect solutions to propose.

First, I felt not completely honest while voting: I had 2 proposals and one
of my colleagues had another one. Can I be neutral and objective? Probably
not.
The only solution which came to my mind is to prevent people from voting on
their own or voting at all if they anything submitted. But looking at the
people actually writing the proposals, it would be a non-sense to prevent
them from voting as they are the most aware of the QGIS core code.

It made me think of how voting modifications of the constitution happens in
Switzerland: the executive is sending out voting recommendations. This
could be an approach, that someone (PSC? a dedicated group?) gives a
technical advice on the proposals. But here again, it might be difficult to
be objective and mostly politically quite risky.

This brings me to another issue: some proposal don't leave room for
technical discussion. On this part, I think that we should make writing a
QEP mandatory as it should be the place to discuss the proposal and to
raise concerns. What happens if a grant proposal is accepted but not its
implementation?

Cheers,

Denis

Oh good - thought I was going crazy with deja vu here. Turns out it's

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 4.0 - let's start some early discussions!
Message-ID: <CAB28AshafJuUex3SxYdqFhJPxQGCc9HQZg=B=w-=2xqWfu4znw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following conversation from https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30234, I
think it would be beneficial if we start the conversation happening
about QGIS 4.0, and to throw some thoughts about timelines out there.

**Before anyone panics -- I'm expecting multi-year time frames here!
But I think we should START this discussion, and have at least some
idea of the time frames we're all aiming toward for a future 4.0
release.**

For reference: Qt upstream has previously hinted at November 2020 for
Qt 6, at which stage support for 5.x will be dropped. Discussions so
far are moving toward Qt 6 being a "gentle" cleaning, so there's
likely (hopefully?) not a lot we'll be forced to do to adapt to this.

I think we should aim for a similar goal -- a "gentle" API break, as
opposed to the huge-clean-and-break-everything-we-possibly-can
approach we took for 3.x (with good reason!).

Thoughts?

Personally, I'm a bit uncomfortable with any kind of API break if we can
avoid it which means we don't need to call it 4.0 as that marks a major API
break when bumping that version number?  Any reason we need to make it 4.0
and not just continue down the 3.x stream until we are forced to break APIS?

We should be able to migrate away from any API breaks in theory right? We
couldn't for 3.0 because of all the SIP and Python 3 stuff but that
shouldn't be the case in Qt 6 hopefully.

That is just my take.  We need to maintain a stable API for as long as
possible if we can which I know you know I'm just double voicing it.

If the Qt6 is broken (even gently :-P) and we plan to base QGIS 4 on it then even if our stuff is API compatible, the surrounding things that plugin authors have used may be broken, which would for me still justify calling it 4.0 instead of 3.x.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS documentation build is failing and is making

Message-ID: <CAECJsSpR9mFNxDxwaLeT2SVh_gYEg0=pJ+skKqUijiJcrQH4uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

For days now, master in QGIS-Documentation is failing [0]. For the same
reason, which has nothing to do with the writing system but the testing
framework for pyQGIS code. Issue is that the failure does not seeem to be
constantly reproducible.
In the link above, havatv-climbalongline and havatv-pointtolayer are both
based on master HEAD and none provides changes to code testing. One is
passing and the other one is failing. Actually both are reported failing in
doc repository [1]
The fixFailingTest2 branch, also based on master, provides a fix based on
the suggestion in Travis message. But it failed, and the suggested solution
would be ..... the current master state.

I'm getting crazy so if someone wants to give it a look and bring the
repository to green, it would be nice.

Personaly, I'd like to decide wether we stick to PyQt6 or move to Python
for Qt and its shiboken for QGIS 4.
That would be the occasion to drop sipify for something a bit more robust
(hum).
Investigations shall be pursued to see if we can safely move to Qt without
any issue, but I guess that's hard to tell without trying.

Indeed going a bit crazy ;)

Looking at the document mentioned in the thread [0], it would be good if we
could at least get the QEP requirement written in stone.

For the rest, I am a bit puzzled on the solutions. Maybe having only QEP
already accepted would be an option, although being other issues such as
timing for review.

Cheers,
Denis

Any reason we need to make it 4.0 and not just continue down the 3.x stream until we are forced to break APIS?

Eventually, at some time we'll have to break API, and release 4.0. I'd
like us to start **thinking** and planning for that now, even if the
actual release doesn't happen for 2+ years (as is likely).

I mean, I think we'd all agree that there is things we could improve
upon from the 3.0 experience. If we leave this discussion for another
22 months, and then are forced to make a bunch of tricky decisions in
a matter of days, it's not exactly ideal :P Long term planning is
**always** going to beneficial!

Yeah it would make sense to align QGIS 4 with a jump in technology
(i.e. Qt5 -> Qt6). Maybe we could also investigate the option to use
Qt for Python (which is now a fully supported part of Qt) and free us
from PyQt and SIP (but the question still to be answered is whether Qt
for Python is at least as good as PyQt implementation).

For timing how about something like "not earlier than in 2 years and
not later than in 4 years" :-)

My observation is that lots of people are still using 2.x as we kind
of made people scared of upgrading (due to the API changes, missing
plugins etc.) and they got quite conservative. As people only now
slowly move to 3.x I think that's another reason why we should not
push for a 4.0 release too early.

In any case, this is a very useful discussion to have - and get
everyone on the same page.

Cheers
Martin

Not sure about the changes in QT 6 but I think if the API breaks we 
should call it QGIS 4.

And when the API breaks anyway, I would love to have the geometry model 
improved and am willing to help.

Hi,

There's already a wishlist of what could be done there:

   https://github.com/qgis/qgis4.0_api/issues

Maybe you can add your ideas to this list, Raymond (and others).

I am also in favor of waiting at least 2+ more years before doing a 
major upgrade to give users some investment security when migrating and 
deploying their systems.

And with a good communication about a "gentle" break I'm confident that 
we'll have it easier this time.

Furthermore, it would be nice to go over this list of issues and see 
what we can actually already can make happen before and deprecate, so 
pyqgis devs can even have a smoother experience by being able to develop 
against a future API even before. (Thinking about 
https://github.com/qgis/qgis4.0_api/issues/90 and smilar here)

Regards

Matthias

Hi,

I have tried locally, and I got no failures on the 51 tests.

There error is:

Document: docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/cheat_sheet

Application path not initialized

Got:

It seems that the 'Companies' layer is added to the TOC in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/6234bdcece8d5d94eb5acf7802dac13b289d65db/source/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/expressions.rst#L151

I bet the reason why sometimes it fails, and sometimes it doesn't is
because doctest may not always follow the same order. Since we only want to
test RST by RST, I think we should do some kind of sanitization at the end
of each file.

In the commit you mention, which aimed to fix that issue (PR with
discussion at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/3869), I put
the codes in a .. testcode:: group, thinking that will bound the
'Companies' layer creation to that group only. Obviously a fail (though the
build succeeded locally and failed on travis the first time before
succeeding two times after close/reopen steps).
What's the purpose of group, then (
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html)?
The order of doctest may indeed be random since providing the suggested fix
also fails (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/3880) with
suggesting the current situation. :mad:

Deleting all variables in the end of each pycookbook file? or in the
begining?  in a testcleanup directive.

That would make sure no variable is reused on other tests.

agreed fully, good communication on these matters is of crucial
importance to let people accept new versions at move at the appropriate
time, to minimize noise.
Given the wide variety of networks, it will be difficult to properly
spread the tight word. Maybe we should have *official announcements* in
these occasions.
Also, I think the already proposed dynamic qgis access page could help a
lot here.

Let me share my experience with the jump from QGIS 2 to QGIS 3. I have been
trying to get QGIS used by the US Government and make it an option rather
than just relying on ESRI. This has been very difficult but I was making
progress. I had offices that were primarily using QGIS and who were
developing scripts to handle their work flow. When QGIS 3 came out they got
so frustrated with the lack of documentation and the complete break of the
API, with no program that would take their scripts and make them QGIS 3
compatible, that they completely abandoned QGIS and went back to ESRI.
Despite the fact that I love QGIS 3 and think it is better than QGIS 2, I
find there is now less interest in using QGIS. I have less customers then I
used to have and it will probably take at least another year or two to get
back to where I was at.

I know that as developers we want to continue to improve the code, add new
features, and have a fun time. Fun tends not to be associated with
documentation. I cannot tell you how important the documentation and
training materials are. I would prefer seeing less new features but make
sure the documentation is excellent and up-to-date. The PyQGIS
documentation really needs a lot of work. It is not sufficient to let the
functions and variable names explain what they do. Each variable needs to
explained in such a way that the programmer will understand what effect it
will have when they change the values. This is one thing that ESRI has done
well - provide tons of documentation and training.

I hope these observations will be helpful to you as you plan QGIS 4. I
don't want to go through what I have been going through with QGIS 3.

Cheers,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingParameterField with parent layer
 based on a QgsProcessingParameterString
Message-ID: <PS1PR03MB3607EFAD421F1149F66A831DA1E30@PS1PR03MB3607.apcprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello folks,

I am writing a processing script where I need to select multiple fields from a loaded project layer. Normally I would use QgsProcessingParameterField and a parent QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource to directly select the parent layer.

However, in my use case I can only specify a substring of the parent layer name.

e.g. Assume that the layers loaded in the current project are:

xyz_proj1
xyz_proj2

I need a processing algorithm which takes two parameters:
   1. substring: which is a layer name substring:  e.g. "proj1"
   2. field selector: which must be based on the fields of "xyz_proj1"

How could I go about doing this?

Thanks,
Tej

I don't agree with the implied solution (i.e. slowing down development to
focus on documentation) because I don't see how this is economically
feasible.

If those offices that switched back from QGIS to ESRI would have invested
the money they are now paying for licenses into QGIS, we could probably
have fulfilled Tim's vision of having someone working full-time on QGIS
documentation and Q&A.

They could also have hired a developer to write the missing documentation.
Or hired someone to port their scripts. Or stayed with QGIS 2 until more
documentation is ready ...

This story is sad and frustrating but we need to find an economically
feasible solution and I think that involved educating users about how open
source projects work.

Regards,
Anita

Most of out QGIS users are using it because they have the interest and want
to use open source. Management is tolerating its use and in this situation
the users are not in a position to either hire a developer nor pay someone
to write the documentation. That has to come form above. There are
government entities that are supporting QGIS who have contributed
significantly, but that doesn't necessarily translate down to individual
offices and users.

I don't know what the solution is, but just know that this is what some
face and the less API breaks, better documentation, and better transition
methods can make a huge difference for these offices.

In the government users normally do not see the actual cost of ESRI
licenses so if QGIS does not work out they just go back to ArcGIS. There
are real benefits to QGIS. Users of ArcGIS occasionally feel the impact of
the licenses being exhausted or the license server going down. QGIS does
not have this problem. Additionally, QGIS normally runs faster, crashes,
less, and can work with larger amounts of data.

The one thing I see with many users is that they just want to do their job.
They don't like redoing scripts they worked so hard on. They just want to
run the software year after year and have it work.

Hi,

Personally on my build machine [1] I've never had a problem to build 
QGIS master.

Rainer, some questions:

  - did you compile from scratch or via our infrastructure 
(ports/poudriere/synth?)?

- did you have the same problem with FreeBSD 11 or 12?

- can you try with llvm 6 or 7 from ports (I think that FreeBSD 13 have 
llvm 8 by default)?

Regards,

Loïc

[1] A jail with clang 6, qt 5.12, gdal 2.4.1, proj 5.1.0

You'll need to make a custom parameter type or widget. If you're using
a string as just a short cut GUI method to set a full layer, I'd
suggest writing your own GUI widget wrapper for this and keep on using
the feature source parameter. It's much less work, and will still work
correctly in models etc. If, on the other hand, there's more
complexity here then you'll probably need to resort to creating your
own parameter type.

This seems like a recurring theme. Let's add it to our api break
tracker so we've got a record.

For me, the biggest pain point in current API relates to all the use
of CRS database id values. These are redundant, fragile, and block us
from some nice features we should have through proj 6. I'd very much
like to kill these and require AUTH:ID codes everywhere, but that's a
break. I've hacked around it as best I can for now, but it IS limiting
the extent we can utilise the new world of projections.

Works for me. Especially if Qt 6 is targeted for end of next year,
that would give us ~1 year to hold off a transition. (Although,
potentially if Qt6 is a minor break we'll likely be able to get qgis
building on both 5/6. It's just... plugins... which are the issue.
again.).

This has been very difficult but I was making progress. I had offices that were primarily using QGIS and who were developing scripts to handle their work flow. When QGIS 3 came out they got so frustrated with the lack of documentation and the complete break of the API, with no program that would take their scripts and make them QGIS 3 compatible, that they completely abandoned QGIS and went back to ESRI. Despite the fact that I love QGIS 3 and think it is better than QGIS 2, I find there is now less interest in using QGIS. I have less customers then I used to have and it will probably take at least another year or two to get back to where I was at.

I cannot tell you how important the documentation and training materials are. I would prefer seeing less new features but make sure the documentation is excellent and up-to-date. The PyQGIS documentation really needs a lot of work. It is not sufficient to let the functions and variable names explain what they do. Each variable needs to explained in such a way that the programmer will understand what effect it will have when they change the values. This is one thing that ESRI has done well - provide tons of documentation and training.

Hey Calvin,

This feedback is SO invaluable to the project, thanks for submitting it!

** SNARK: for what it's worth, we're not the only ones with crap API
migration docs. I recently had the extreme misfortune of having to
port some javascript from the ESRI ArcGIS JS library v3 to v4. Apart
from a handful of scattered notes, the migration docs are effectively
one paragraph: "Version 4.x is a substantial overhaul of the ArcGIS
API for JavaScript and its mapping components. Consider rewriting
applications instead of simply trying to update them.". In comparison,
the QGIS 3 api break documentation are pure gold.

Hi Calvin,
thanks for your feedback from "out in the field", it's very valuable for
the project. I understand very well your frustration.

The solution can only be investing more in documentation and in
migration tools. We held migration for as long as it was reasonably
possible, a move to Qt5 and Py3 was necessary at that stage.
The point is who is going to put these resources (money and, more
importantly, manpower).
I think QGIS.ORG and the whole community is doing miracles with our
limited budget, one could hardly do more.

Do you have hard evidence of these facts? It would be very useful to
share and to show it in the open.

so why they don't just keep on using 2.18 then? Of course it's
unsupported, and we recommend migrating, but we are not forcing users in
any way.
Cheers.

Hi,

Would we not end up with a code in the code? That is, if we add layers, we
add fields, we rename fields for a chapter purpose, we'd need to have a
testcleanup section in which we revert each of the changes? Or do I
misunderstand what a testcleanup should look like?

I've seen that a file has been added when the framework was set up. What I
thought at that time is that it would be a file tests would call (if
needed) and process with and at the end of the page, it's reverted to its
initial state (and so are data), maybe within a testcleanup (should be a
smaller "same" code, right?) or a configuration in the framework (we
initialize the file before/after running each group/file). But i don't know
if that's possible, I'm not sure there's a code that uses it and I don't
know how accessible is this file from the test codes. Does anyone remember
what this file was created for?

I build from the ports system, with an updated graphics/qgis port, 
prepared for the change from QGIS 3.6.0 to 3.8.0.

The behaviour is the same on my real life boxes and on Poudriere.

Until now, I only tested with FreeBSD 13.0-CURRENT. Will try on 
Poudriere with FreeBSD 11 or 12 in the next days.

>

Loïc, this seems to be the right approach. With llvm 8 and 7 the build 
fails, with llvm 6 all builts fine!

As a fallback (workaround), I could enforce the port to use llvm 6, 
until the real cause is found.

The problem seems to be with 
src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem_legacy.h and its long table, 
handled via QMap. Obviously, newer llvm versions (7 and 8) are not able 
to create the code correctly.

Thanks for your answer and hints,
Rainer

You should fill an issue to our bugzilla. Maybe llvm or core dev can 
take a look at this bug? AFAIK, Ed found already an error (not 
reproduced?) in FreeBSD devel with newest llvm version.

I'll test with newer llvm version but on FreeBSD 12.

It doesn't seem to affect Linux, since Docker is based on Ubuntu 19.04 
and clang 8 if I'm not mistaken. Nyall, Denis, can you confirm?

Hi Harrissou,

I think you are over thinking it. We don't need to revert everything, We
just need to make sure that certain variables are initialized or fully
replaced in each rst file to be tested. For example, if we have a project
instance where layers are added in different rst files, it will be hard to
guess the status of that project everytime.

I will try to have a look at it later. I am not an experienced PyQGIS guy,
but I think I can stab it.

Thanks,

Alex

How would you handle custom CRS (for example WKT definitions) that aren't 
registered by a authority ?

I'd keep the existing custom-user srs db, and the current approach of
assigning these "USER:10001" type codes. It's anything relying on the
internal srsId (db row id) and srid (postgis id?!?!?!) which need to
be killed.

Message-ID: <CADsfgKOFsKU6e8c_4iDFRtwtMr+7AUuZtDF3tsN-k5Q_V1TBVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have installed QGIS 3.8. OTB plugin which was working fine with QGIS 3.6
is not working now.

I have read in some place that starting from QGIS 3.8 OTB plugin will
become core plugin of QGIS.

Any update on this?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.8 Transformations dialog
Message-ID: <f398a2cc-1fbd-c710-b668-49b03b37e907@duif.net>

Hi,

Starting up a fresh 3.8 and loading a EPSG:28992 (our national crs)
layer I got a dialog questioning me which Transformation to use.

I wrote something down here:

http://www.qgis.nl/2019/06/27/english-proj-select-datum-transformations-for-epsg28992/?lang=en

Question to devs: what is the meaning of the 'green' item in this
dialog? Is it the old one? Or a default one?
Because reading the texts there, it appears that the last item is to be
used?

Question 2: IF somebody makes a mistake, how do you get this dialog back
to choose another one?

Cannot find something in docs or changelog about it (besides:
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/#much-improved-coordinate-transform-handling)

Hoping that this question and writing this down in a blog will help
others too.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Looks like something/someone has changed a setting on your QGIS.
(Options - CRS - "Ask for datum transformation if several are
available"). The default is off.

It's just the first, non-deprecated one. I.e. - more or less random.
On proj < 6.1 builds treat any transformations with great suspicion.

> Is it the old one? Or a default one?

Well - (don't read this as snark, I'm just trying to accurately convey
the situation): if you want to make the correct choice, fire up proj
6.1's projinfo tool and see what it suggest for transforming between
the two systems. On QGIS < 3.8 or proj <  6.1, this dialog is using a
custom database of "transformations", which was ad hoc, unreliable,
and basically untrustworthy.

The good news is that the solution is already done -- you just need a
QGIS 3.8 build based on Proj 6.1. And then you can trust QGIS'
transformation capabilities as being the best there are available
anywhere (thanks entirely to the proj team).

> Question 2: IF somebody makes a mistake, how do you get this dialog back

The setting is saved in the project properties (or in the options, CRS
tab if you clicked "make default").

> Cannot find something in docs or changelog about it (besides:
> http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/version/3.8/#much-improved-coordinate-transform-handling)

On proj < 6.1 builds none of this is new. It's been cleaned up a bit,
and some bugs fixed, but it's been relatively unchanged since 3.0.

Hi Stefano,

I don't know if you have noticed it (since I did not see any official
announcement, yet) but 3.4 and 3.8 are now available in Transifex for
translation, next to master. Big thanks to Jürgen Fischer.

All should be good and easy now to update translations in released versions.

Greetings,
Harrissou

Ok, by accident I have a QGIS with proj6 here :-)

That one shows 'just' 2 options (added to the qgis.nl post)
IF the green line is just the first one, but we are not sure if it is
the right one... should we make it green anyway?

Other remark (again, see qgis.nl post): in the new transformation
dialog, I do not see the information that I saw in the other (proj5)
dialog, information like:

EPSG Transformation Code: 1672
Source CRS: Amersfoort
Destination CRS: WGS 84
Remarks: Parameter values from Amersfoort to ETRS89(1) (code 1751)
assuming that ETRS89 is equivalent to WGS84 within the accuracy of the
transformation.
Replaces Amersfoort to WGS84 (1) (code 1112).
Replaced by Amersfoort to WGS84 (3) (code 15934).

Is that info not available (any more?), or did we conclude that it was
not valuable? Because I think it gives some context about the validity
of the given transformations? I'd be ok to still show this (if available)?

Will have to compile proj6 again to make projinfo work to check (proj6
was patched to work with QGIS).

Plz do not see this as critiques: I understand that actually QGIS and
proj are getting better and better, and we just are getting more
precise! Thanks all for this work!

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing alg - best solution for a "value
	relation" form input ?
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7DsBgMRFAkxxfZERAzxpErhrwxyCx-UeuHQ=wcvK5X2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to propose a QgsProcessingParameterEnum automatically filled
with data from a layer, exactly in the same way QGIS does with the form
value relation widget.
Basically, the alg author would choose the layer, the key field, the value
field, to order or not by value, and an optionnal filter.

I would like to know if someone had already done it, and if so, I there is
some example code online.

If not, I think I would do this:

* create a new QgsProcessingParameterValueRelationEnum inherited from
QgsProcessingParameterEnum
* use the input metadata to gather the parameters of the datasource. For
example for PostgreSQL, I would add the connection parameters (service) and
the schema and table name. An filter option would be great too.
* add methods (or override existing one ?) to gather the data and then use
the setConditions methods to fill in the combobox.
* I should also add a new method parameterAsValueRelationEnum to get the
code based on the selected item

I could also just call the setOptions method inside the alg, but it would
be harder to maintain accross algs, and it does not seem to be the right
"processing" way of doing it.

Or I could also use the setMetadata method with a widget_wrapper, such as
done for the ConnectionWidgetWrapper ?
        db_param.setMetadata({
            'widget_wrapper': {
                'class':
'processing.gui.wrappers_postgis.ConnectionWidgetWrapper'
            }
        })
and then do the magic inside a dedicated class ? How ?

Any help appreciated.

Regards,
Michaël

	"Feature"
Message-ID: <d7afac0be66ebf762f1b9ff7f26785b9@carto.net>

Hi, 

Since 2-3 versions (I think) there is, next to html and text, now a
third "format" in GetFeatureInfo with the name "Feature". 

I wonder why this new format was introduced? What is the idea and what
are the advantages? 

I noticed that not all of the data types work well in this new format.
For some (e.g. Postgis data types) data is shown in mode text and html,
but nothing in "Feature". One such data type are "json" and "jsonb". The
display either an empty string when a text widet is assigned or NULL
when a List or Key/Value widget is assigned. 

Thanks for clarifying the purpose of the third format "Feature". 

Andreas

hi, just a question.
what is the difference between "qgis-application" and
"release-3-8-qgis-application" in transifex?
they a different number of total strings and I don't know which branch I
have to translate.
thank you

qgis-application is master, the release-3-8-qgis-application is for 3.8 and
the release-3-4-qgis-application for 3.4 ltr. Depending on the language,
the strings may not yet been uploaded totally, reason why percentage of
translations may greatly differ.
About what to translate, might be worth checking transifex documentation. I
don't know whether there are pipelines between the different branches and
if you translate something in A, it will fill B and C. I wouldn' bet on it.
But since Transifex keeps memory of translations, i suppose you'll get the
suggestions when translating B or C. IOW, I think you have to translate
each branch you are interested in (once they are fully loaded).

HI Andreas,

I've no idea about the reason why it was added, I just know for sure that
it generates a JSON request to the server by sending
INFO_FORMAT=application/json.

I'll have a look, it seems like a server issue.

Wow, this is great news for LTR users.

I wonder if 3.4 translations can be reused for 3.8? If people put their
focus on the LTR, will they have to redo everything on 3.8 or master, even
if the string is equal?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Question on POI Exporter ColorHash
Message-ID: <CABPxTTrRGgsvVUZ2Np7jOAd_=p499eOhpoi34isZ5=up7RV_ag@mail.gmail.com>

I'd had the request to do this color hash for POI Exporter, but didn't get
around to it so tnguessan released his own version. I think ideally it
would have been better for tnguessan to have made the modifications to POI
Exporter then do a pull request. I don't mind if he wants to take over this
project, but we now have two POI Exporters. Should mine be deprecated?
Would it be better for tnguessan to take over the 'POI Exporter' name?
Would it be better to just keep the POI Exporter and have a pull request
done? I could make him a part of the POI Exporter team.

I really don't want to see two plugins that are diverging but basically
doing the same thing. The plugin repo really only needs one. What is the
best approach?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi!

IMHO people should focus on master as this will always be used for new
releases.
With all the backports been done this is now a really great opportunity to
"correct" missing(or updated) strings in the LTR releases.

As Harrissou already said, there will be the need to accept the "new"
translations done in master in the LTR translations, but that should be
possible with only on click and not entering the whole sentence again.

regards
Werner

P.S: probably we should move translation related discussions to the
translation list?

thank you for your explication.
sometimes it happens that a string is first translated and then later
corrected.
it is clear that now the correction of a string present in the three
branches must propagate both towards the ltr and towards the master.
and at the moment this must be done by hand.

now it's all a bit more complicated, since you have to keep the three
branches under control, but at least you can do everything in transifex.
I believe that if someone were able to design the control between the
versions it would be something that really deserves to be funded directly by
qgis.org.

thank you all for help and now it's time to translate :-)
ciao!
s.

I should also say that this person only contacted me about adding a
feature, but never suggested making code modifications and then doing a
pull request.

I don't think it is a good policy to take an existing plugin, add a
feature, and release it as a new plugin unless the original plugin has been
abandoned.

I await your guidance on this matter.

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi,
We use the feature option in getfeatureinfo in qgis to allow the users to
retrieve the geometry from a feature on the map.
This really useful rather than wfs because wfs is inefficient and we often
dont want allow the downloading of the featureset.
So we disable the wfs and suggest to the users to retrieve one single
geometry using the feature option in getfeatureinfo in qgis wns client.

Regards,
A.

Hi,
Forget to add other explanations:
The retrieve geometry from wms is useful also because is in any available
srs.
So the user can have one single geometry in an srs reprojected on server
rather than on qgis.
This is better because the wms server can reproject using proprietary grids
.
Meanwhile the reprojection on qgis is without proprietary grid and so less
exact.

A

How much interested would there be for a plugin to display sunrise and
sunset information for a particular location on the earth's surface. Is
anyone already working on this? There doesn't seem to be a capability for
this, but perhaps I have missed it. Are there other astronomical
calculations that would be worth while in QGIS? (Moon asimuth/position,
phase)

I a trying to get a sense of interest and also make sure I am not
duplicating a capability someone is already working on.

Thanks,

Hi,

What's the current state of QtWebKit dependency within the main source code?

I have seen this post and am curious if it is still true:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Developer-qgis2web-and-qtwebkit-tp5378226p5378445.html

I'm assuming that if there is still a dependency on QtWebKit there is also
a need for the PyQt bindings for its modules as well.

Side note, we are working on getting the conda-forge qgis recipe fully
functional:

+1 it would be useful

In particular when planning drone flights users often want solar noon,
not whatever local time is. It's also a good reference for lots of other
analysis.

As Chris mentioned there may be python libraries out there that just
need a QGIS interface.

Thanks,
Alex

This would be super-handy. I've needed this value in the past on
different projects, and would love to see an easy way to calculate it
in QGIS.

Can I suggest that the best form this would take would be a new
expression function? E.g. sunrise(point_in_wgs_84, target_date) ->
gives a time value in return. That would give maximum flexibility in
terms of use (mmmm, i like the idea of dynamically styling event
points using a different icon whether they occurred at night or day! I
could imagine this being used heavily alongside Time Manager) .

I'd love to see it in core, if you want to contribute it as a c++
function. I'm happy to mentor here, and writing new expression
functions is a great, self-contained way to dive into the QGIS code
base.

Nothing's changed on either side, unfortunately. We still NEED
qtwebkit, and the situation upstream is still a confusing pile of
excrement and misinformation.

> I'm assuming that if there is still a dependency on QtWebKit there is also a need for the PyQt bindings for its modules as well.

Yes. You can build without it, but that's really just a hack to allow
a build to proceed. The resulting QGIS app will be crippled and
missing core functionality.

Me either -- this is bad form in my opinion too.

Ah, on proj 6 builds, we ARE sure that the first/green one is the most
recommended one :) That's because proj gives us an ordered list of
possible operations in order of preference (calculated using all
proj's internal smarts and knowledge about the accuracy of different
transform operations).

Unfortunately not -- proj doesn't expose this information. I'm not
actually sure where it even came from in the first place. It was
present in the QGIS custom db, but with no provenance or source.
I would love to see this properly handled and exposed, but it's a
discussion you'll need to bring up with the proj team to resolve.

Not at all! This is all relatively new territory for QGIS, so your
feedback is invaluable.

Do you mean the layer is hardcoded here? How would that work? You'd
need to guarantee somehow that the layer is always available wherever
your algorithm is used. (That would be ok for a plugin I guess, where
you could package up a layer with the algorithm)

I think there's two use cases to consider here.

1. Some predefined list of values which you want to expose through the
GUI, but you don't want to hardcode these, and instead want to
populate them from a SPECIFIC layer instead. In this case, I'd say you
could just do this using the existing api and reading through that
layer to populate the choices exposed in QgsProcessingParameterEnum
(but be wary of performance costs... algorithm parameters are read at
the same time your algorithm is registered with Processing, so this
could potentially impact QGIS launch speed).

2. Expose a list of field values based on a dynamic choice of layer
and field. I.e. your algorithm has a vector layer/feature source
parameter and a field parameter, and you want to show values from this
layer/field choice. It's like an extension of the existing field
parameter, where the listed fields are dependant on another
parameter's (the layer parameter's) value. It's just another level
deep, because the choices would depend on both the layer parameter AND
field parameters values. In this case this does sound like a new
parameter type would be warranted to address this use case, something
like QgsProcessingParameterExistingFieldValue. Potentially, this
parameter type could have options for either taking the layer (and
field name) choices from other parameters OR you could hard code a
value for them instead. Similarly, you could have a setting for the
parameter for overriding the "display field" choice, allowing
value/code type handling.

I'd steer away from using metadata as much as possible. It's extremely
fragile and ill-defined.

Another note: If you're writing this as a candidate for inclusion in
master, please do so in c++ and ensure that any gui widgets use the
new c++ classes and api (not the deprecated Python WidgetWrapper api).
Time and time again Python has proved its fragility in handling core
Processing functionality, and we're never going to avoid future bugs
like https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/30406 unless we stop using it
for ALL core Processing code.

QtWebKit 5.9.0 builds with Qt 5.13.0 on macOS 10.14.

Using Qt 5.12, the QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENGL path in 
clang_64/mkspecs/modules/qt_lib_gui_private.pri needs to be fixed. Qt 
5.11 and earlier are ok.

The latest QScintilla and PyQt5 also compile ok with Qt 5.13.0 and macOS

Hi Shiva,

What is QGIS 3.8 distribution / platform that is not working with OTB plugin?

QGIS 3.8 for windows?
QGIS 3.8 for Linux (Ubuntu xx.xxx)?

Hopefully, QGIS 3.8 for macOS would be available soon.

I'm wondering what need there was in changing the names of the functions to
call in the api qgis 3.

Was it not easier to leave a formal compatibility with the past?

No one should have rewritten everything. porting would have been easier.

Can you indicate the discussion thread where this choice was approved?

thank you.

Hi Shiva,

Why it is not running? What is the problem.

Is your python working with plugin?

I got problem with QGIS 3.7 nightly for macOS. The python 3 seems not
working installation with QGIS 3.7 plugins.

QGIS 3.7 macos the python plugin is disabled in my install.

Hi,

I think the QGIS 3.7 for macOS (qgis_nightly_master_20190626_121009)
has problem finding python3.6 installation when it is not using
Homebrew (i.e. Cellar) installation.

Hence, the QGIS plugin is disable.

I use the standard approach of installation python3.x in macOS as mentioned.
https://www.macobserver.com/analysis/how-to-upgrade-your-mac-to-python-3-2017-update/

How do we fix this problem QGIS 3.7 (3.8) in macOS installation?

Thanks,

Noli

I agree, it can be useful. As a reference, also GRASS has since ages
similar calculations:
https://grass.osgeo.org/grass77/manuals/r.sun.html
and related commands.

that would be extremely useful! In the past I used:

https://pypi.org/project/astral/

simple and clear. But as Nyall suggested, having some expression would
be incredibly much more powerful

Mmm, then my last question, after this I'll move to proj ;-)

See:

http://www.qgis.nl/media/2019/06/Screenshot-20190627104509-716x467.png

This is QGIS with proj6: As you see there are 2 options. The first one
being green 'numbered' (3). But the bottom one having a higher number
between brackets having a (4) between brackets?

Now /me wondering what these numbers are: because given your answer
above, the green one being 'THE one' :-) I wonder what this other
numbers are (I was wondering ordered by date/relevance or so)??

These are how proj identifies the coordinate operation -- I'm not
entirely sure what they represent, but I assume they are just indexes.

Just adding another +1 vote to have something like this in QGIS :-) At
some point I would like to look into rendering of shadows of buildings
in QGIS 3D - and for this it would be important to have the ability to
calculate sun position.

Hi QGIS PSC (in cc Users and Devs)

Because QGIS is a team effort and as announced during the end of QGIS
UserConf 2019 in A Coruña we (The Spanish QGIS User Association - QGIS.es)
want to give back to the project half of the financial surplus of the
conference. e.g. 3000€.

As we are a new association with a lot of work to do, we though to retain
1500€ to approach some (possible) costs to setup associacion webpage (pus
marketing actions) to attract new association subscriptions that are
growing (too) slowly also because we really opened subscriptions last May.
so we planned to:
1) transfer 1500€ now (already done)
2) transfer remaining 1500€ basing on our financial buffer (at least
3000€). E.g. every 3 month, starting form January 2020, we will check if we
have 3000€ in the bank account, if so we will trigger the remaining 1500€.

We would like, as association, to appear as sponsor, not clear if a flat
bronze sponsorship plan for 3/6 years or one shot Silver sponsorship at the
end of the complete payment.

Thank you for all the comments. To summarize.

1. Having this capability would be useful.
2. Take a look at pvlib.
3. Add it to expression functions and possibly add it as a core C++
function.
4. Take a look at GRASS r.sun and related commands.
5. Take a look at the astral library.
6. Take a look at GEarthView

My philosophy is that QGIS is a professional GIS application and as such
its algorithms used need to be the most accurate that are available. The
Sun and Lunar algorithms are not trivial and I would want to use an
existing library. I know there are some simplified approximation algorithms
that you find used on the web particularly in JavaScript mapping
applications. I would prefer the more accurate algorithms, but will be
limited somewhat with what I can easily include.

If this capability were to be added as core C functions, then I think you
would need to link it to one of the astronomical libraries. I think all of
the python libraries are probably in part derived from the C libraries. Is
adding an astronomical library to QGIS of interest? I don't think we should
use the simplified algorithms. I have not looked into C libraries, but I
know that the author of Skyfield (formerly PyEphem which is now deprecated)
based his code on the US Naval Observatory NOVAS library. I can see that
having astronomical calculations in QGIS would be beneficial to some and
could even open it up to other uses, but I don't know how much you would be
interested in making these core functions, but lets start the discussion as
it might affect my approach.

I have already been looking at possibly using one of the python libraries:
astral, skyfield, astroplan, and astropy. I know some in the community
disagree with including libraries with the plugin, but in my experience
most of my users do not have root privileges and if the plugin requires the
extra step of having system administrators pip install additional packages
then it eliminates most users from being able to use the plugin. (Part of
this is due to laziness.) So if I do this I will include the libraries with
the plugin unless the QGIS community decides they would like to support
astronomical calculations as a part of core QGIS.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Global settings in QGIS-Server
Message-ID: <afa222aafff8447ebd2faf03ac827b6b@carto.net>

Hi, 

In the context of evaluating the benefit (or not) of geometry
simplification, triggered by the findings of Oslandia
(https://oslandia.com/en/2019/06/21/qgis-3-and-performance-analysis/) I
wonder how one enables simplification in QGIS server? 

On QGIS Desktop, it is a global setting per each user profile. How do I
enable this setting in QGIS-Server? Do I need to specify an .ini-File
with the "QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH" variable? If yes, how do I create such an
ini-file? Do you have an example? 

I had a look at
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/config.html#advanced-configuration
but couldn't find how I would do this. 

Thanks for your help! 

Andreas

These seem to be basically what I am looking for, but they are an external
process that saves the results to a file. It would be nice to simply have a
method that returns the result. So now I am not quite sure how to proceed.
GRASS probably has the functionality, but not in the form I would like.

Cheers,

Calvin

Hi Calvin,
I don't think adding a Py lib to the standard osgeo installer would be
an issue, I believe you can help with this if necessary. A cleaner end
more robust solution than including libs in the plugin IMHO.

The global settings are not available for the server (and they are not
needed), but you can use  QGIS_OPTIONS_PATH to define a full path to an
ini-file with your own settings for the server, the format is the same of
the Desktop settings, meaning you can just define you settings using a
(possibly clean) profile in the desktop and copy them (the file QGIS3.ini)
to the server.

Kind regards


If yes, how do I create such an ini-file? Do you have an example?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Save layer metadata to global datasource
Message-ID: <46f71f5d-f297-70ee-9664-4e8acf39b012@servus.at>

Hi ppl,

Layer metadata currently is saved either as a .qmd file on disk or as a
record in the users personal "qgis.qmldb" (tbl_metadata).

We now have the problem that metadata gets lost when using a Postgis
layer by a different user/user profile. So we miss the option to save
the metadata together with the layer.

I imagine a solution similar to styles, where you choose between Local
Database or Datasource Database when "Save as Default".

So in Postgres we would need a additional table "public.layer_metadata"
with column "metadata" to save the URI (text) and column "qmd" to save
the XML.

Any thoughts on that, would that make sense?

thanks
Gerald

GRASS does not seem to have lunar calculations. If it does it has not been
exposed in QGIS.

I agree this is helpful feedback, and I can vouch that, at least in the
USA, government agencies are often set up to favor the "security" of a
license arrangement with a large corporation over the unknowns presented by
a project like QGIS.

I wanted to offer a different take from the other side of the equation in
the USA. I work for a firm that consults with government agencies, so the
dynamics are a bit different. In my case, we've adopted QGIS pretty
heavily--not exclusively, but nearly so. The big sell to our users had very
little to do with documentation or the cleanliness of the API. The greatest
selling point for us was the huge improvement in usability and features
over ESRI products. In other words, my experience leads me to the exact
opposite conclusion from Calvin: more and better features has proven the
worth of QGIS to our users regardless of documentation issues.

That's not to say documentation doesn't matter. Improvements to
documentation would be a great thing. But the transition from 2.x to 3.x
for us was an easy sell because of the huge improvements in usability and
stability.

I guess the takeaway is that some user groups are more affected by
technical changes like an API break than other user groups.

Lastly, I can vouch for the poor quality of documentation from the
proprietary GIS option(s) out there. Inertia seems to be the biggest
problem QGIS faces at this point.

Thanks all for consistently putting out great software!
Spencer

Hi 
Sorry for the delay, bad internet connection, and for this misunderstanding; I've retired the package from the qgis plugin repo, as I realize it's a bad form too. 
I had collaborated on poi exporter plugin adding "comment field" to the dialog form.

SAGA GIS also has a tool for it since 2015:

  Climate -> Tools -> Sunrise and Sunset

It is raster data based: "This tool calculates the time of sunrise and
sunset and the resulting day length for each cell of the target grid.
The target grid needs to provide information about its coordinate system."

Hi Tim,

Sorry, I missed this email from you.

Thanks for the update Sunni! Do measurements happen in 3d too? For example
> if you measure to the top of a building do you get a different measurement
> compared to the base?


Yes, the measurements happen in 3D. You can measure the building height now
:)


> Maybe you could show the Z elevation change at each measurement row and
> the total elevation change  in the total box?


Hmm, that's a good idea. I will keep it on my list, and I will try to
implement it after the other 2 features finished. Thanks!

Hope you are feeling better now!


Thanks, I am feeling better indeed now :)

Best regards

The Sun and Lunar algorithms are not trivial and I would want to use an existing library. I know there are some simplified approximation algorithms that you find used on the web particularly in JavaScript mapping applications. I would prefer the more accurate algorithms, but will be limited somewhat with what I can easily include.

I think all of the python libraries are probably in part derived from the C libraries. Is adding an astronomical library to QGIS of interest? I don't think we should use the simplified algorithms. I have not looked into C libraries, but I know that the author of Skyfield (formerly PyEphem which is now deprecated) based his code on the US Naval Observatory NOVAS library. I can see that having astronomical calculations in QGIS would be beneficial to some and could even open it up to other uses, but I don't know how much you would be interested in making these core functions, but lets start the discussion as it might affect my approach.

I think (given Martin's desire to add this capability to the 3d
engine) that yes, there's a valid use case for this. And I'd MUCH
prefer to have this out of the box vs a 3rd party plugin. I'd suggest
doing a review of the available libraries, in order to determine which
are possible candidates wrt to features and license, and also
determine how actively maintained upstream is, and then we can make an
informed decision from there...

Just for followers of this thread - conversation moved to the proj
mailing list, and looks like it will result in improved descriptive
strings coming as a result...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Projects without a CRS

Hi, 

I am wondering about projects without a CRS. While a new project now
always comes with a CRS (depending on the global CRS settings), the user
can still explicitly disable a definition of a CRS in Menu "Project" -->
"Properties" --> "CRS" 

I have the following questions about projects without a CRS: 

- what are the restrictions/limitations of projects without a CRS? 

- assuming that a layer has a CRS (e.g. a Postgis layer that has a CRS)
is loaded into a project that explictly has no CRS set - does QGIS still
know the CRS of the Postgis layer or would it treat it as a CRS-less
layer? 

- does it still make sense to support projects without a CRS? If yes,
what are the use cases? 

- will it still be possible to have projects without a CRS or will this
one day be deprecated 

I personally do understand that it is not a good idea to have projects
with no CRS defined, but I am trying to understand and convince my
colleagues at my workplace that projects without a CRS are an absolute
nogo. But maybe I am wrong and it still makes sense to support projects
without a CRS. 

One use case I could think of for projects without a CRS, is using QGIS
for something that is planar, but not geographic in nature, e.g. a
non-GIS topic, such as examining an image (let's say the enlarged view
of an electron microscope of some small thing) where the user might want
to "map" certain characteristics of the image, but the object itself is
"mobile" (can move around) and is not fixed to a fixed position of the
earth. 

What are your thoughts about projects without a CRS? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas

I think there are some (partial?) answers in docs, in case you didn't read it yet.
