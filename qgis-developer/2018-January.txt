Subject: [QGIS-Developer] text in textboxes scrambled when qgis opened in
	external display.
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMKq82Oxq+Q_24cwnnCDjNmqXNU2qKktaQ-WK=3D7q6xnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm asking if this is already a known bug or should I create an issue to
the bug tracker. At least I didn't find any existing issues. Btw. Should I
first verify bugs here or should I just create issues to the tracker?

I have text unreadable in textboxes for example on expression dialog or
python console. Characters go over each other and cursor is located in
wrong place. Here's an image:
https://1drv.ms/i/s!An1LdKsV1v_9m_gyLCA4wyoa4lQUIQ

This happens only if QGIS is opened on an external display.
The external display has display scaling 100%. My HiDPI laptop screen has
scaling 150%. And I'm running Windows 10 fall creator update.
And QGIS is latest 2.99.0-252 (626781a63a
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/626781a63a>) from OSGeo4W.


Thanks,

Lauri

Hi,
I wish everybody a good start in 2018!

We have -again- a problem mirroring the QGIS repos locally, see [1]. The 
ubuntu subdomain is not accessible anymore and going directly to 
qgis.org results in the same error as two years ago.

best regards

Bernhard

Hi all,
for the first time, a good part of developers are uncertain about the
need to postpone the freeze. IMHO it is better to discuss about his in
the list. From my point of view, we should postpone it only if there is
a real, strong necessity, which does not seem the case now.
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi

For my part I think we can go ahead and set a date for the freeze (e.g. Friday) - Etienne still needs to commit the last metadata serialisation stuff but he has kindly come back from leave for a day to finish that. Stephané wanted to merge the OGC filters stuff which is fine for me. 

Do we want  have some additional bug fix only time before we make the actual release - perhaps targeting the release for the end of Jan? I haven't looked in detail what blocking issues there are but from Mac point of view the GRASS processing tools still don’t work which is a bit of a blocker IMHO.

Regards

Tim

I think we really need some more bug fixing time.  I noticed all the
layouts stuff from Nyall is now there but given the large amount of work
more time would be good IMO.

+1 to set a release date for the last week of January. That'll give us 2
weeks of freeze period (assuming the vote turns out not to extend the soft
freeze) which can be used to focus on fixes only. The soft freeze period
saw a nice set of fixes too, which was nice.

I'm in favour of hard freezing this time (assuming we can get those
last couple of PRs reviewed quickly and merged).

But I'm against setting a hard deadline for the final release yet.
That said truth is that IMO 3.0 still feels very buggy, and there's
lots of open high priority regressions against it. I think we've got
two options:

1. Move to a regular "are we ready for final release?" vote

or

2. Just decide that 3.0.0 will have bugs, and that we should "release
early, release often" and hope that we stabilise things quickly for
3.0.1/3.0.2/...

Just a quick followup: the issue with no-data value should be fixed
now in the nightly builds - please feel free to test again.

Hi Bernhard,

Can you provide some more information on what you exactly want to see?

http://ubuntu.qgis.org ?

That one was still pointing to our old server (which since... I think 3
weeks does not have a webserver running anymore).

I let it point to our new qgis2 server now (144.76.174.102).
(note that this one is NOT being cached by cloudflare, so I doubt it is
'the same problem' as earlier)

And I see now:
http://ubuntu.qgis.org/ubuntugis/
which is a repo.

Fixed like this?

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

thank you for your answer. Our goal is the same as two years ago: We 
want to mirror the repo locally, i.e. we want to see all the files.

This command currently works:
debmirror --dist=xenial --section=main --arch=i386,amd64 --cleanup 
--host=144.76.174.102 --root=ubuntugis-ltr --method=http --rsync-extra=none

BUT:
1) if the IP changes we will have to call again
2) if http is shut off we cannot access via https because the SSL 
certificate does not contain the address 144.76.174.102 (certificate 
verification fails)

regards
Bernhard

qgis.org is the domain.  ubuntu.qgis.org was just one of the catch alls.

Ok, (more) clear :-)

Easiest (for me now) is if you could use this url:
https://qgis.org/ubuntugis/

The (letsencrypt) certificate there is valid for
qgis.org (going via cache)
version.qgis.org (NOT going via cache)
and download.qgis.org (not even a DNS entry)

So IF
https://qgis.org/ubuntugis/
gives cloudflare/certificate problems,
you could use
https://version.qgis.org/ubuntugis/

Note that 144.76.174.102 will be the ip address for the upcoming future.
It is not that we will change back to the other one.

If all this is not working, I could add ubuntu.qgis.org to the
certificate too (and probably debian.qgis.org then too???)

Let me know what you preference is.

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

I have juste seen this blog post
https://bl.ocks.org/rpgove/210f679b1087b517ce654b717e8247ac

I know nothing about this kind of algs, nore about the QGIS rendering
internals, but I thought it could be a possible way to speed up the heatmap
renderer ?

Just passing the info ;)

Hi
Trying to use ‘Save As’ in 2.99 (Coderevision b59bd94e87<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/b59bd94e87>)

In 2.18 there are a button ‘Map View Extent’ which is Excellent when I save from a WMS layer. But it´s gone ??

Anywhere else to look for a view extent ?

I think on balance I prefer option #2 as it will get more people using QGIS 3 - we must just be careful to tell people that it is ‘next-gen’ and that the LTR is still 2.18….

Ok, let me re-word option 2 as:

"2. Carefully manage release expectations, with detailed explanations
of known issues and regressions in the release notes. Stress in press
releases/release notes that 3.0 is a new major release and that the
QGIS team do not consider it a suitable replacement for the current
stable LTR release, and that it is highly recommended that
organisations do not replace their existing QGIS 2.x installations
before careful in-house testing and evaluation of its suitability for
their workplace. The next stable LTR QGIS release will be QGIS 3.2."

I agree on release asap knowing it might not be the most stable release
ever.
But, I would make sure
* we have a serious effort on bugfixing prior to the release and following
it
* we do not release with severe AND prominent known issue
* we have a shorter dot release cycle (maybe once a week or switch to
nightly builds) to avoid waiting too long for fixes

Best regards,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Rename Style manager to Symbol manager in 3.0?
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EFuYnLiq3xm7-7WG9qCOrUxu8+W8sEvxTZ06Yv8wB=pg@mail.gmail.com>

While writing some tutorials, I have noticed some possible nomenclature
confusion between Symbols (as compounds of stacked markers, lines, fills
outlines and color ramps) and Styles (a vector layer symbols and labels
settings).

We currently have to places we call "Style manager":
1. The symbols library that we open by going to Options > Style Manager;
2. The Style manager tab in the Layer Styling panel.

I think that the first one should be renamed to "Symbols manager", since it
exclusively allows to create, edit, group, import and export symbols, and
not styles.

On the other hand, the Style manager in the Layer Styling panel allows to
create, manage, load, save as default the layers' styles (unfortunatly it
does not allow to save styles as we can do in properties).

Any strong opinions about this?

Thanks.

Alexandre Neto

The "style manager" dialog shows non-symbol objects also (specifically
color ramps). And in future, I'd like to see this extended to include
font style presets, preset colors schemes, and other non-symbol
objects.

Ok, based on the results of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5974 ,
we'll have to defer this until 4.0 when (hopefully) we have much fewer
QgsProject::instance() calls in core/gui/providers.

I like all your elaborated wordings, but couldn't you just brand 3.0 with  
a huge red BETA mark, and nearly everyone should know what this means:  
Evaluation: Yes!, Production: Maybe, on yout own risk.

I'm -1 to label 3.0 a "beta" product. I'd argue that in many respects, 3.0
is a more stable and reliable product than 2.18.

Hi, 
Looks like this issue is back again (for reference, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2765 for a related issue) and at some point, still from a doc writer perspective, it's not easy to be sure that you are clear enough for the reader, using same namings.
We need to find two different names for these two dialogs, whatever plans we have. These are two really different features. Given that the issue is raised in ML (as requested in the PR discussion), maybe the time has come.

Guys,

libdummy.so does not link properly on OS X. It binds to non-existent dylibs (well, TBH, it binds to actual dylibs, but the path to them is wrong). As a stopgap measure, can I simply delete this lib before packaging the app? I’m not sure what this library is used for.

Thanks, happy new year to all the team!

Happy new year to you too! Can you share some more info on what you are doing in terms of packaging QGIS on MacOS? Are you packaging based on brew builds or using some other workflow? I’m interested in making sure that Mac packaging efforts are unified and shared as much as possible.

With specific reference to lib dummy - I am not sure what it is used for / if it is used - hopefully someone else on the list can help with that…

The bug fixing programme already started - I believe there are still funds to support bug fixing so those interested should register with Andreas (who can also confirm if there are still funds available). Agreed it will be good to step it up over this month as we ramp up to release.

Sure if it is corrupting your data or what have you it should be held back.

-1 from me for this. I think this is really going to screw around with Jürgen’s workflow - lets try to minimise churn and just slot into the standard workflows as much as possible.

Hi Chris (cc to dev list),

Your QGIS is requesting 'https://ubuntu.qgis.org/version.txt'.
Problem is that ubuntu.qgis.org does not have a valid certificate (yet).

Not sure since when that url is used, but in my view it should be just
'https://qgis.org/version.txt'.
(Well, in my personal opinion, it should not even phone back anyway,
unless people press a button to do this)

Anybody knows how ubuntu.qgis.org ended up in this builds?

Because there was also a question recently about a ubuntu.qgis.org repo,
I just added it as ALT-name to the certificate.

So Chris, it should now 'just work' :-) .
Let me know if not.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Alexandre,

I agree with you that at least the Title of the dialog which opens with
the button 'Open Library' should be named 'Symbol Manager'.

In my memory we also had a discussion about these definitions when Akbar
Gumbira did his QGIS SOC work on the Styling Repo work:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/58

I see that the actual tab name is also 'Symbology'. Is that the word
normally used for it (myself I always call this 'Styling'...).
On the other hand, I think we should stick to naming conventions that
are used by other GIS-software packages.

Regards,

Richard

FYI: because apparently ubuntu.qgis.org is also used to request
version.txt I just added ubuntu.qgis.org as alt name in the qgis.org
certificate: https://ubuntu.qgis.org/ubuntugis/

yes - and we already spent approx. 2/3 of our dedicated 3.0 bug fixing 
funds (including some expected pending invoices which I should receive 
in the next couple days). See also 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F6v4g8Ayb3wIt73rxFKD8h4B95MaTwt-eDit8YvReB0/edit?usp=sharing 
for what was done regarding the paid bug fixing programme.

Funds are not unlimited, unfortunately, so if you want to work on behalf 
of this bug fixing initiative, please contact me upfront to check if 
funds are still available. I am going to publish the financial report 
next week - it is almost finished. Still waiting for some invoices from 
work done last year.

crashes are just as bad as one usually looses project configuration

I agree. Better stick with Jürgens schedule. I think our releases are 
already often enough. Besides for those who really need them there are 
nightly and weeklies. No need for extra releases.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing plugin - Set style on resulting layer
Message-ID: <1514987944132-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I'm building a Processing plugin used as an interface between QGIS and a
geological PostGIS database. 

The resulting layer is as standard loaded automatically (Processing best
practices). This resulting load (shapefile) happens after method
processAlgorithm of GeoAlgorithm has run. 

This gives me no chance of setting the resulting layer style. Is there any
post-processingAlgorithm method or anything else I can use? I'm aware of
"qgis:setstyleforvectorlayer" but my script is not meant for the modeller
and would like the algorithm to be run in one step not two steps. 

I may be out of scoop for what a Processing plugin is meant for - but like
the non ui and direct algorithm approach.

Jakob

Message-ID: <ce67c074026498d9e34e225424f5574a.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there!

I've read your discussion about the soft freeze for QGIS3 and the
idea of "release once, update often".

Right now, OSGeo4W's installer for QGIS3 (on Windows) redownloads
a whole bunch of packages on every update of a nightly build.
The amount of data transmitted is not negligible.

There are plenty of users worldwide who do not have unlimited access
to the Internet. Some users access updates via the mobile network,
etc.

Could you agree with OSGeo4W how to improve the process? It would be
useful to transfer only the changed files and not the complete QGIS
package, which may contain only one or two updated files.


Best regards,
Tobias

Hi Tobias,

That is not entirely true. You can have a local package cache (part of 
the advanced installer settings). If you have that, OSGeo4W only 
downloads the new/updated packages.

BTW: the local package cache is also good practice if you want to 
install using OSGeo4W Nightlies on multiple machine on the same network. 
Just put the package cache on a network-drive, point the installer to 
the shared package cache and it is available to several PCs.

Hi Andreas,

it's true for QGIS. I'm not talking about additional packages (
like GDAL and others).

http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/qgis/qgis-dev/
As you can see, each build has 60 MB.

Equal to
http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/qgis/qgis-rel-dev/
Each build is about 65 MB.

So ten seperate bugfixes aka 10 new builds will result in 650 MB rx.

Please do not forget that QGIS is also used in emerging markets
where the network infrastructure is not as optimal as in Western
countries.

Best regards,
Tobias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Master is now only compatible with plugins for 3.0
Message-ID: <3144615.lP0i22kER6@debian>

Hi Lists,

Please note a small change in plugin compatibility behavior:

>From now, 2.99 is explicitly compatible with plugins for 3.0, 
same as 3.99 will be compatible with 4.0 plugins etc. 

So you no longer need to declare the bizarre 2.99 - 3.99 compatibility range 
for your plugins. Just set QgisMinimumVersion to 3.0 in order to make them 
compatible with QGIS 2.99 - 3.98.

See the change and a short discussion: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5904/

If you definitely disagree but you missed the discussion, feel free to raise 
it now, while we still can revert it.

Regards,

Borys

The builds only happen once a day - not on each commit.  And the packages only
cover qgis.  The dependencies are only updated the those package change - which
doesn't happen (that) often.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Freeze exemption for feature duplication PRs
Message-ID: <9f2b32529a72428a4e4cad01aec4a387@carto.net>

Dear devs, 

As the hard freeze of master is coming soon I would like to ask for an
additional exemption for three PRs developed by David Signer (OpenGIS),
with some assistance/advice from Matthias. 

The PRs deal with feature duplication: 

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5922 (duplicate feature redigitized) 

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5925 (duplicate child feature in
relationwidget of attributeform) 

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5961 (Contextmenu with individual
actions (in form view side column)) 

I know, we are late with this functionality, but we (as customers) need
this functionality really soon and I think the code should be in good
shape by now. It would be kind of sad having to wait another couple
months for this functionality. It would also make the handling of
features with relations (duplicate, redigitize, link and unlink) more
pleasant for many applications and users. 

Should you have any technical questions, you can ask David and/or
Matthias. 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

Thanks. Can we have a review of the PR, and an idea of the risk involved?
All the best.

The main risk is that something in the relation reference widget is
broken. Something that we as users (Province of Zug) would find out
first, because we use it a lot in many of our projects. We are already
using QGIS master a lot and would find out issues around relation
reference widgets. 

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5925/ is low risk, since it is mainly
UI changes (only 2 files changed). 

The other two PRs are a bit more complex, but still manageable to review
for a core dev. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5961/ is introducing a
new context menu (also mainly UI).
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5922/ is probably the one of the three
PRs that needs most review. 

Just my own view of course.

Message-ID: <7208D119001E804CA9A367B852EF63A05644C755@POSEIDON.eftasgmbh.local>

Hi everybody,

i found a mysterious behaviour during a shapefile editing session. Using qgis 2.8.14(15).
I have some shapefiles which I want to edit. I create a filter on it, editing is possible.
I save the project and after reopening it, there is no more editing possible. Even if I remove the filter it can't be edited anymore.
I tried the same with a postgis layer which doesn't have this problem.So this might be shapefile specific!?

Can anyone confirm this? Is this a bug? Should I open an report. Or maybe is there a solution/workaround?

Kind regards
Christian

The pull requests were reviewed and discussed internally extensively,
except for the last one (#5961 "Contextmenu with individual actions").

> and an idea of the risk involved?

Hard to tell, we never can exclude all the risks. On the pro side I
would mention that these are new buttons/menus/actions so code is only
executed on user interaction and only a minimal amount of bootstrap code
is executed silently to create the buttons and menus.

Matthias

This reminds me of a similar bug (that should have been fixed), please have
a look to

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17507
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5741

If you think that the scenario is different please file a separate ticket
and link to the original ticket (they are related for sure), if you don't
think it is a separate issue just re-open #17507 and add a note with the
exact procedure to reroduce your issue, please also attach a minimal simple
project and data to allow me to quickly reproduce the issue...

Make sure you are testing a build that is newer than 27 Nov 2017, that is
the date when the patch landed into 2.x code base.

Thanks

Message-ID: <EBDBC9BF-DA78-41B7-A901-B3055998A419@macports.org>

Folks,

Apparently there are recurring bug with the UI under OS X when using OS X 10.13 / Qt 5.10 : some dialog box closure crash (I just tried to close the project dialogue box and it crashed right away), and also the small colour dialog with predefined hues that appears when you click on the right of the standard colour picker.

Just to say, sorry I can’t be of any more help because I only have so much time these days (TBH, I’m currently writing a review of QGIS 3 for the January issue of my magazine).

Good luck!

Vincent

if developers of QGIS3 will switch to "release once - update often",
there will/should be more updates. See Firefox or Chrome... they
are updating very often (even silently).

Seems like I am the only one seeing a problem here... so it doesn't
seem to matter. Ignore it please :)

Just to make it clear, nobody is proposing to make any changes to the frequency of releases. Point releases will be every 4 months, bug fix releases still monthly on the LTR versions (if there are any fixes), weekly and nightly builds etc. will just continue exactly as they do at the moment.

BTW I also live in a bandwidth impoverished society and share your desire for minimising bandwidth, but short of delta updates (which we don't have the resources to implement at the moment) there isn’t much room for optimising in my opinion.

I just did a small comparism of what changed between the latest
nightly builds and packed the files with changes only.

While a normal packed nightly release is about 61-65 MB, the changed
files only (no delta) is about 40 MB. So we're saving 25 MB only.
Facebook's zStandard packager can bring the diff to 36 MB (30 MB saving).

Maybe it's better to switch to XZ. It can bring the full release to
40 MB only, while zStandard is 52 MB and bzip2 is 62 MB?

Best regards,
Tobias

Just to make that clear: Point releases are the bug fix releases and happen
every month.  Regular releases happen every 4 months.

Hey Vincent,

How do you build QGIS? This looks very much like a local build issue.

Hi there!

Just to make that clear: I really like your work (QGIS & OSGeo4W).
I just want to give some hints to make it even better ;)

Since OSGeo4W is OpenSource, I could create a "slimmed down"
variante for users with limited access to the internet.

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi All,

Is there a reason for the QGIS 2.18.X builds of UbuntuGIS builds having a
dependency on GDAL ABI 2.2.2? linking to a patch release seems very weird.
I know the GDAL team tries to ensure ABI compatibility within a minor
version.

I don't believe this is possible in 2.x, nor currently in 3.0 either.
BUT - the API has changed significantly in 3.0 and could be expanded
to allow for this type of approach in future 3.x releases.

Because the C++ ABI was not stable in the past, see:

 https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=756867#40

> I know the GDAL team tries to ensure ABI compatibility within a minor

Maybe it is now, but it was not in the past.

GDAL 2.3.0 will be the first release for which I'll try not to bump the
virtual ABI dependency (keeping it at gdal-abi-2-3-0) to see if C++ ABI
is now actually stable. If that fails, the virtual ABI dependency will
be changed for every patch release again.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Processing allows to define styles for outpus on the per-algorithm basis.
Just open algorithm context menu by right-clicking on it and select "Edit
rendering styles for outputs". In the dialog you can assign styles for each
algorithm output. These styles will be applied to outputs automatically
after algorithm execution.

Hope this helps.

That works for a user, but I think Jakob is after a way for an
algorithm to define a style which is always used for the output for
that algorithm.

Is this correct?

Ok thanks Bas.

So this is the ABI for the c++ and C API? Doesn't QGIS only use the C API?
If so should gdal-abi-2-2-2 even be a dependancy, or is libgdal20 (>=
2.2.0) enough?

Cheers
Jeremy

The C++ and C API are provided by the same shared library, so the
virtual ABI dependency reflects both.

The fact that the qgis package depends on the gdal-abi virtual package
means that it does not only use the C API. All packages that use one or
more of the C++ symbols also get the gdal-abi dependency in addition to
the libgdal dependency.

Most reverse dependencies of gdal use (some of) the C++ API, only a few
packages like gmt, grass, mapserver, mapcache, postgis and few others
only use the C API, and don't need rebuilds for every new gdal release.

Hi,

I started a QGIS C++ app some years ago and wrote a blog post about it
https://3nids.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/build-and-deploy-c-qgis-app-on-windows/

Things have changed since, but I guess it's a good start.

Best wishes,
Denis

Yes, I would like to control the styling from my processing plugin code not
by context menu. The end user is not to worry about where to find a qml
style file.

Because that's what the GDAL package provides.  But why is that a problem?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3D: Support for 3DM (x,y,z,m)
Message-ID: <1515159116536-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Is it correct that the 3D engine currently does not understand measurement
values in 3DM format.
When having four numbers in a coordinate the z (and m) value is skipped
rendering the geometry af terrain = 0 meter (any 2d layer in 3D map is
default rendered at z=0).

Example:

/SELECT 
	1 AS id, 
	ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOINT(505105 6305783 100 111, 504809 6305233 200

M values are ignored as their meaning is application specific. How
would you like to use M values in the 3D view?

All visible layers are rendered as a 2D map image for the terrain 3D
entity. Here the Z coordinate is ignored. But if you enable 3D
renderer for your layer, it will create a 3D entity that will respect
Z values. If you do not want your layer to be displayed on the
terrain's texture, you can set layer's symbology to "no symbols" and
that will disable rendering of it in 2D map.

Cheers
Martin

M values is not for rendering in 3D, but just residing as part of my
existing 4D data. When the M value is present the Z value is reset to 0 -
and not rendered correct. Right now I would have to strip the M value from
my data before rendering in the QGIS 3D map. 

It could actually be useful rendering the M value as a label in the 3D map.
It could be age or velocity of a particle in groundwater particle flowmodel.

You 3D terrain model work with 2D draping works just fine. As I stated in
the qgis issue log - having rendering of negative Z values could be fine for
subsurface data.

Anyways a very good job done yet.

Folks,

sorry if I bug you with my multiple (scattershot) messages.

When I display a 3D view on OS X / Qt 5.10 with a reasonably recent MacBook Pro 13" (i5-5257U CPU - integrated graphics), even when I don’t interact with the view, the fan ramps up and top reports a CPU usage around 50% for QGis. Other applications slow down perceptibly.

In my experiment, I use a 25x25 m DEM as terrain model and display around 40,000 3D vector features (extruded buildings models).

Is this CPU load expected? Do you get a similar phenomenon on your own hardware?

Thanks,
Vincent

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrg+LTccSGYT9J8mGUb=QSLu2RYi2HrCF2LoEhva1dtow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm sure we had this discussion in the past but couldn't find a discussion
with outcomes. I'm doing some digitizing these days, using master and still
fail to know how i should proceed for some actions:
- how do I add a simple vertex on a line? with the click-click system, it
wants me to move the vertex. However, while writing the message, found out
that doing three simultaneous clicks does the job (as well as a
double-click combined to snapping on the line). Am I correct or is there an
easier process?

- How do I add nodes to selected ones? ie, I made a click and drag with the
node tool and got too much nodes (sometimes from other features) or not
enough nodes. How do I update the selection?
Btw opening the vertex editor panel for a feature does not show selected
vertices (see https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17806)

I have other questions but let's fix these ones and I think answers may
help me deal with the rest.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Thanks. I wasn’t aware a ticket had already been opened. Sorry for the noise, but then you know now it also plagues OS X and is not solved in Qt 5.10, apparently.

Cheers, have a nice weekend!

Message-ID: <CABPxTTpMWO0kxkvquNMf+5Ff6VYptdLzxB1G9Kck6WRqrO5SdQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've asked about this several time and have never gotten a real response.
The following code creates two memory layer polygons that overlap.

from qgis.core import (QgsFeature,
    QgsVectorLayer, QgsPoint, QgsFeature,
    QgsMapLayerRegistry)

poly1 = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon?crs=epsg:4326", "Polygon 1", "memory")
dp = poly1.dataProvider()

pts = [QgsPoint(-117.9031, 44.4169), QgsPoint(-103.86080, 44.700146),
QgsPoint(-104.655656, 38.257599), QgsPoint(-117.9031, 44.4169)]
f = QgsFeature()
f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon([pts]))
dp.addFeatures([f])
poly1.updateExtents()
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(poly1)

poly2 = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon?crs=epsg:4326", "Polygon 2", "memory")
dp = poly2.dataProvider()

pts = [QgsPoint(-115.27676, 40.242037), QgsPoint(-101.32007, 41.387353),
QgsPoint(-102.1608432, 33.314810), QgsPoint(-115.27676, 40.242037)]
f = QgsFeature()
f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygon([pts]))
dp.addFeatures([f])
poly2.updateExtents()
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(poly2)

>From the QGIS menu if you run the Geoprocessing tools such as Intersection
or Difference on the two polygons the algorithms fail to return the correct
results. Are memory layers no longer supported in QGIS or is this a bug in
the Processing code? In QGIS 14 this code works fine, but with QGIS 18.x
and QGIS 2.99 it fails.

Calvin

I think in theory the GDAL packages could have a patch release (e.g 2.2.2->
2.2.3), but that upgrade wouldn't be allowed as it would break the QGIS
packages hard dependency. If the GDAL c++ API is stable going forward and
Bas/Debian maintainer do change the ABI package to align with the minor
point releases then the problem would be gone I think.

These examples are very old - the general workflows are the same still probably but I think the code won’t work against recent QGIS versions.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geoprocessing Tools Fail with Memory Layers

Hi Calvin,

Confirmed here:

- creating the two memory(!) layers using Calvin's python code, and
running intersection returns one of the two polygons
- saving the same layers to gpkg and run intersection just works
(I thought that it would have something to do with OTF, but with or
without it it returns wrong).

Please create an issue for this.

I adapted your code to run in 2.99, and then with me it seems to work:
http://pix.toile-libre.org/?img=1515181793.png

The red part is the intersection?

What kind of (wrong) result do you get?
Maybe create an issue for it too, with some more screendumps with your
result and the expected result?

from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsVectorLayer, QgsPoint, QgsFeature

poly1 = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon?crs=epsg:4326", "Polygon 1", "memory")
dp = poly1.dataProvider()

pts = [QgsPointXY(-117.9031, 44.4169), QgsPointXY(-103.86080,
44.700146), QgsPointXY(-104.655656, 38.257599), QgsPointXY(-117.9031,
44.4169)]
f = QgsFeature()
f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygonXY([pts]))
dp.addFeatures([f])
poly1.updateExtents()
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(poly1)

poly2 = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon?crs=epsg:4326", "Polygon 2", "memory")
dp = poly2.dataProvider()

pts = [QgsPointXY(-115.27676, 40.242037), QgsPointXY(-101.32007,
41.387353), QgsPointXY(-102.1608432, 33.314810), QgsPointXY(-115.27676,
40.242037)]
f = QgsFeature()
f.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPolygonXY([pts]))
dp.addFeatures([f])
poly2.updateExtents()
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(poly2)


Regards,

Richard

Hi Harrissou,

Check this blog post, day 13. You add a new vertex by click and drag the
cross between two vertexes.

Not sure about the node selection.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsComposition.getComposerItemById returns wrong
	object
Message-ID: <CAJy=XtfreNz00fCTUdkf=0GuPQNhoQVE938LT=BUFV_UbhnZ-Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to set programmatically a QgsComposerPicture content in QGIS2.99:

1) I create a new print composition and I name it 'test'
2) I create a picture frame in the composition and I call it 'picture'
3) I run the following code:

from qgis.core import QgsProject
myComposition =
QgsProject.instance().layoutManager().compositionByName('test')
myComposerPicture = myComposition.getComposerItemById("picture")
myComposerPicture.setPicturePath("[path to an image]")

and I get the following Exception:
AttributeError: 'QgsComposerItem' object has no attribute 'setPicturePath'

If I inspect myComposerPicture object I found it is a
qgis._core.QgsComposerItem not a QgsComposerPicture

Is this a correct behaviour or is it an issue?
Should I open a issue ticket?

If your script is targeting QGIS 3.0, please don't file bugs against
composer. You need to use the newer layouts engine instead (QgsLayout
and associated classes).

Over the coming week all composer code will be removed from QGIS.

There's a few workflow regressions associated with the new node tool,
but nothing we can't sort out before release.

For me https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17782 is a blocker and fixing it
would address a number of the open issues against the node tool.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsivxV7ni9YqKO-sBZ8qXcw79OBVCKuHe1UbQqXDepwb-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just looking for some clarification re freeze/release.

My understanding is that the last loomio "extend freeze" vote was
blocked, and that all the freeze exempted PRs are now merged (I
consider https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5913 is a bug fix, not a
feature).

This would hint that me that we are now in hard freeze, but I'm not
sure how that relates to the voting occuring in
https://www.loomio.org/d/38Aiya0q/3-0-soft-freeze-exemptions?utm_campaign=missed_yesterday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=user_mailer
to grant exemptions to 3 more PRs.

Just for clarification, is this a correct summary of the freeze situation?
- hard freeze is coming
- those 3 PRs may be merged, if the voting for each passes
- after the voting period expires we enter hard freeze regardless

And following hard freeze, did we agree to a month of bug fixing
before release? Or 2 weeks?

Nyall

I thought it was 1 month but I can't recall a decision. I would vote for a
month.

Hi,

I would also prefer:

 1. to go into freeze soon
 2. if possible merge the 3 PRs that were recently voted on for
    duplicating features
 3. have 1 month of bug fixing - 2 weeks seems to short for me.

Note that we already had a couple of weeks bug fixing from some core 
devs in parallel with the soft freeze, but as this is a major release 
with so many changes I would prefer 1 month after the hard freeze.

Andreas

If these PR’s are all ready we should just merge them straight away. If there is pending work still I think they should hold over till 3.2

Yes my understanding was that is is now in effect (assuming those 3 get merged today) and that only bug fixes should happen now.

Yes - the voting is closed on all and they all passed.

Yes

I had proposed that we do bug fixing until end Jan 2018. I think there was general agreement to that time frame although we did not make a formal vote.

+1 for 1 month from me - that would peg the release date as something like 8 Feb then….

Looks like you have found a bug in postgres provider - I have filed it
here: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17814

Indeed - support for labels in 3D view would be nice to have. The kind
of labels like place names in Google Earth where they are always
facing the camera and their size does not change as the camera moves.

There are already people interested in working with subsurface data in
the 3D view, so hopefully we will get some improvements in that
direction in the following releases.

Dear members of the community,

while we're still very busy in Google Code-in, which is, by the way, a big
success so far, it's already time to apply for Google Summer of Code 2018!
In fact, the admins team is making shifts to cope with all these energetic
pre-school students and meanwhile preparing the application for next GSoC..

*We need you!*

At this time of the year, software communities should brush up their list
of ideas, create a new ideas page and send the URL to us admins at  <
gsoc-admin at osgeo.org>. We need to receive your URLs by *Jan 20*.  If you
are willing to act as a mentor, fill in this form: https://goo.gl/forms/
jMvPl7ns2NG1BL6Q2

Please, forward this email to your developer mailing list.

Here [1] is the timeline.

Looking forward to another great GSoC edition!
Let's keep fingers crossed for our application!

Cheers

-The GSoC / GCI admins team

Richard,

Thanks for verifying this. It appears that the bug is with 2.18 and is not
in 2.99.

The wrong result that I get is dependent on the function run. I either get
one of the original layers or no result.

Regards,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] The need for intuitive complex feature edit
	support in QGIS 3+
Message-ID: <CAJf0-jrQ8_PjQ-R9aOsgovUEGGomHPmC2iOfkSRKYtwhgbfOxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list.

My name is Rui Cavaco, a supporter for OSGeo Portugal, and I see the need
for some future major changes in desktop GIS user interfaces in order to
facilitate complex features editing and querying.

GML and INSPIRE are about complex features but so are fiber optic networks.
Complex features could be also very productive in simpler cases like the
management of city road signs and indications and other municipality
themes.
In order to properly support complex features I think we need to go further
than the simple and old three-part GUI comprising TOC, map and attribute
table. For example, attribute and form views must have "drill down"
capabilities. As for the TOC, subdivding layers, as the GMLAS extension
does, is not enough. Something like tree-view windows showing object
hierarchies and complex objects' internal contents must exist. This is the
exact same as schematics / synoptic views provided by specialized "closed
source" GIS tools provided for telecom and other utilities management. Also
I think the TOC should be very interactive and adaptive, in order to make
possible to expose the intrincacies of sublayers without cluttering the
whole layer tree with details uneeded for the current user context.

Me and others discussing this subject in OSGeo-PT chat, we are convinced
that without a largely available and intuitive editing support for complex
features INSPIRE will soon be (some say already is) dead, despite all the
the EU legal obligations.

I suppose this is not a job for a single developer or a small team. I
imagine this might require some profound changes in QGIS. I don't think
that all these GUI changes mentioned could be "compacted" in just an
extension.

Funding for this effort could be raised from INSPIRE-interested EU
organizations and member state government agencies. Also telecom companies
and other utilities managers can be interested. Dedicated "closed source"
GIS solutions for utilities are so absurdly expensive that this can open an
opportunity window for Open Source based solutions.

I would like to join efforts with others sharing this vision in order to
help make it happen in future releases of QGIS.

Let that person with authority also lock in the release date.

Very last day of this month, Jan 31? While Feb 8 isn't that far, it'd still
be great to deliver our product by the end of this month. Either way we
need to settle on a date.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Ubuntu Package Releases and GDAL Dependancies
Message-ID: <CAA5WJYneamACDsq-d0QkfmFZrdtZm5r+xTeFvEkd=mxtVU6=_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've been taking a close look at a way to install QGIS with >= GDAL 2 on
64bit Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 for production desktops.

It's not possible to install QGIS using the https://qgis.org/debian package
archive as the ubuntu  14.04 archives only supports GDAL 1.10.1 and 16.04
only supports GDAL 1.11.3.

With https://qgis.org/ubuntugis it is possible to install QGIS with >= GDAL
2.2 as this archive requires ubuntugis-unstable which currently supports
GDAL 2.2.2.

The issue I have is I'm reluctant to use ubuntugis-unstable for production
use. I would rather use ubuntugis-stable. However this archive only
supports GDAL 2.1 and doesn't provide the minimum dependency of GDAL 2.2.2
for https://qgis.org/ubuntugis requires.

I was wondering why ubuntugis stable isn't used as the debian archive for
https://qgis.org/ubuntugis and ubuntugis-unstable is only used for the
development (e.g 2.99) nightly builds? This makes more sense to me.

I've also noted that the 2.18 binaries produced for the 14.04 and 16.04
packaging has inconsistent dependency requirements. e.g 2.18.15 14.04
64bit :

qgis - gdal-abi-2-2-2, libgdal20 (>= 1.8.0)
qgis-providers = libgdal20 (>= 2.2.0)
qgis-server - libgdal20 (>= 1.8.0)
libqgis-dev - libgdal-dev (>= 1.10.1-0~)
libqgis-core - libgdal20 (>= 2.2.0)
libqgis-app2 libgdal20 (>= 2.0.1)

Thanks,
Jeremy

You should have a look at UbuntuGIS development to see that it is mostly
the work of one person now. Packages are updated for OSGeo-Live and
copied to ubuntugis-unstable, after a while (no policy or guidelines)
the packages from ubuntugis-unstable get copied to ubuntugis-stable.
This generally happens during an Ubuntu releases lifecycle, not ideal
for production systems.

For production systems one should not rely on 3rd party repositories,
other than the one the company maintains itself where it does all the
integration work.

The version requirement for libgdal20 are determined based on which
symbols the code in the dependent package uses, qgis & qgis-servers
don't use any symbols introduced after GDAL 1.8.0, libqgis-dev does but
no symbols introduced after GDAL 1.10.1, etc.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi, 

I would prefer Feb 8 over Jan 31. Still quite a few unsolved issues. It
would be nice to have packages ready before the dev meeting in Funchal
(second half of February). 

As an example I still get error messages about the authentication
manager not able to open password files or reading/storing information
about passwords. Seems pretty serious to me - we should not ship in such
a state.

Hi all,
given the small impacts and the benefit of emptying the PR queue, can we go
for a merge of https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5663 (named transactions
in executeSQL)?
I know we voted to not add it in the freeze exemptions, but that was in the
target of keeping a release date in end 2017. Now that time is passing, and
the hypothesis of a QGIS 3.0 "beta" being advertised, I think we should
have it in the release.
Any objection if I ask Paul to merge that?
Cheers
Régis

@Bernd, I don't want to open any can of worm :) . Reading again the
discussion where you ask for it, I realize that no decision was taken on
that BETA branding.

@Borys, thanks for the pointer. I'll see if Paul is available to merge
that.

A small correction: we definitely voted to add it (11:2), just Paul was opposed.

Message-ID: <169e47d3-d2c1-ba67-674e-16d07e5efcc3@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
now that QGIS 3 is in freeze, one priority is migrating as many plugins
as possible before release. To speed up the process I believe it is
important to provide a clear guide for plugin devs. There are already
info scattered around, but is scattered and lacks consistency.
I would therefore ask those who already migrated some plugin, and
everybody who has knowledge on this, to add the necessary info at the page:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3
I'll invite plugin developers to provide feedback on it.
All the best, and thanks.

Thank you Werner. Any help will be useful, both in writing the guide and
in testing and streamlining it.
All the best.

I'm a big -1 for this "beta" idea, and I really don't think we should aim
at any date beyond Feb 8.

Andreas, yep, we still need to fix some issues but none that can't be
addressed during the two (three? :'( ;) ) week of hard freeze. As for the
auth manager error, a fix has just been submitted:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6020

Cheers

Hi Régis

We have discussed beta versions many times through the years and consensus is always not to make a beta. We have nightly builds and an overloaded release manager, lets keep things simple and follow regular procedures as much as possible.

We discussed this (conveying to our users that the 3.0.0 may not be the most stable software on the planet) last night at the PSC meeting and our recommendation is that we will tweak the splash to include a message that this is an early version with a lot of big changes, use only after testing (Anita will come up with better wording). In a subsequent bug fix release (e.g. 3.0.x) we can remove that message from the splash. We felt this was the highest visibility way to message this to our users on all platforms regardless of the installation mode.

Also for the bug fixing, lets give it a full month - there are a lot of other things that need to happen - like giving plugin authors time to port their work now that the API is fixed, getting the release visual changelog written, fixing bugs, packing for Mac etc.

I’d also like to suggest that we move to using loomio more when an unequivocal decision is needed on these things so that we can all be clear on what was decided.

Regards

Tim

If the project settled on Feb. 8, can we have an official acknowledgement
on this? Maybe a simple mail to the dev list stating "QGIS 3.0 will be
released on Feb. 8, 2018".

Thanks,

Math

Sorry to bring this one up again - has this changed yet again? I thought I
had my code working, but I'm getting Travis failures.

Thanks

Feb 8 sounds like a sensible date to me, some time left for fixing but
still in a reasonable timeframe.

Yep, that sounds good for taking decisions after fleshing out a/the
proposal(s) on the list first.

Hi all,
loading a GRIB file does not work properly, because of a projection and
extent issue (mentioned in https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17219).
The issue may reside in GDAL. Has anyone already worked on this?
Thanks.

Hi Tom,

See
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsCoordinateTransform.html#a0716e11c2d1e92d50286210aee6f2800

One should use QgsCoordinateTransform( sourceCrs, destinationCrs,
QgsProject.instance() )

Hope this helps,

Denis

Thanks, Denis. That is what I am using:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/qgis2web/olwriter.py#L271

It works locally with the OSGeo4W nightly, but it fails in Travis:

https://travis-ci.org/tomchadwin/qgis2web/jobs/326777382#L1129

I don't yet understand what is causing this mismatch in behaviour.

Thanks

Tom

Hi Tom,

Sadly, the build of the container you're using has been turned of for 2
months, hence it does not had the datum changes.
This was due to docker cloud failing at building QGIS at every commit.
I just manually triggered a build, let's see what comes out.

We still have to find a proper approach for this.

Denis

Ah, thanks so much, Denis! I would not have worked that out, as I've only
just implemented testing via Docker, and have not used Docker before -
thanks also are very much due to Matthias for his help with this. I'm really
grateful to you both.

Yes, I agree that some resilient method for CI against nightlies/master is
required. I'm very grateful for this image, and it has got me a long way
with my tests and QGIS3 plugin migration, but I was certainly unaware that
the image was out of date.

I just hope there's not a load more breakage with the updated QGIS image - I
thought I was nearly there with my fixes.

Thanks again

Tom

Actually, I did a trick to trigger a build once a day. But the issue is
that the cloud cannot compile in less than 4 hours and the build is
canceled.

We'll have to find another solution to build the image!

Or find a way to export and reload ccache on docker cloud.

If QGIS.org has some budget we could build on AWS and push it to docker
daily.

​How much budget would be needed? We're currently working on the 2018
budget so that would be valuable input.

Hi,

Yes - if you can propose how much this would require, please let us know.

However, we would also need a plan how sustainable this piece of 
infrastructure would be. Who would look after it if things fail? How 
would this fit in with the rest of our infrastructure, etc, etc.

Also, is AWS the only option, or are there other alternatives?

Andreas

Hi all,

I am also looking at this issue at the moment to have an automated build of
the Python API docs (based on the QGIS Docker image).
I'll be sending a report by end of next week with hopefully some solutions
for this.

Cheers,
Denis

I'd opt for the next set point release dates.  19.1. is probably to early, so
23.2. would be up next.

3.0.0 would be release then. 2.14.22 would be the last release of the old LTR
on 19.1. and would be replaced by 2.18.17 when 3.0.0 is released.

Hmm a choice between too early and "too late", ;)

While a sync with ongoing point release would be nice, Feb 23 seems really
far down the road. I think there's an expectation we'd release sooner. At
least, there's a lot of excitement and anticipation.

Cool, excitement and anticipation is good - then they can all test PRIOR
!!!!!!!!! to the release (the nightlies and weeklies) and help make the
release better! 

We did not promise any date. We should release when we think it is in a
good shape.

According to AWS cost calculator, an AWS t2.xlarge for 2 hrs/day 100GB I/O
monthly cost approximately $ 160 / year

We would probably benefit from a jenkins to control the builds and report
failures.

BTW, the boundless nightlies are apparently still available:
https://hub.docker.com/r/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment/tags/master/
and they are suitable for automated CI python testing as explained in
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment-docker

If we also want to build 2.x just double it.

Hi Rui,
did you have a look at this project ?

I think you purchase the very same goal, a common approach seems a good

Well, maintenance will be an issue whatever infrastructure we opt for.

There are for sure, but the Vagrant setup for the AWS build is already done
and tested in production for plugins CI, I don't know if anybody is still
maintaining it though, I'm not looking at it since I left Boundless.

BTW, I'd recommend to check and use the Boundless nightlies while they are
still available, they might need updates for 3D though, I'm pretty sure
it's not using Qt 9.x but the stock Qt from trusty64

Hi Paolo,

It works fine for me.
Have you tried to open it with Crayfish as it will handle the bands
properly?

Just saying...

We could release 3.0.0 on Feb 8, then 3.0.1 on Feb 23 and follow the
regular path afterwards.
I think having a first bugfix release 2 weeks after the official release
makes a lot of sense...

My 2 cents.

+1 with Denis,
in the past releases, we have had at least twice that scenario.

+1 to this proposition. I am sure this will be done this way finally. We
are sure to find some issue and needs a new release soon after the 1st
release. Release often ... :)

Hi Alessandro, 

Thanks for your information. 

I just want to hear other core devs' opinions if this would be useful
for QGIS.ORG. QGIS.ORG infrastructure is already complex and mainly only
Jürgen, Richard and partially Tim understand the infrastructure
partially. If we start something new I would like to see a long-term
commitment from someone to maintain it (lets say at least for the
upcoming year from the start on). 

Just my two cents from a financial point of view.

I'm just wondering how it will happen for windows users using Osgeo4W
installer.

I think we should avoid that a user having the last non LTR release
(2.18.x) gets automatically updated to 3.0 and would have to install LTR to
get his 2.18.x available again on his system.

Jürgen, am I missing something?

2.18 is not even a non LTR release.

No, that's what's going to happen.

I totally agree, I'm not pushing for AWS expecially because the nightlies
are still available, just trying to offer a solution to a problem, and the
solution is still available (as long as Boundless doesn't switch off the
nightlies), when I was in Boundless we went through the same problem 2
years ago, we tried automated docker builds and they timed out (like Denis
said) so we went for AWS and it has been working reliably for 2 years, it
may just require small adjustments when new dependencies are added (like
with Qt 9.1 for 3D).

BTW, I believe that a publicly available nightly docker for Python plugins
Travis-CI testing is beneficial for everybody and increases plugins
quality, I'm just sad when I see people reinventing the wheel.

I would be happier if a company committed to sponsor and long-term maintain
this part of the infrastructure, today it's up and running and QGIS master
nightly docker images for CI are generated and publicly available, but we
don't know about tomorrow.

Thanks for your response Régis.

Yes, I read the documentation for that project. I think that's a good, but
small, starting point. Anyway the docs mention that "the aim is to develop
tools to manipulate Complex Features streams in a GIS desktop
application.". So they might be seeking for something bigger.

It seems that there are now some solutions, including that extension you
mentioned,   to consume complex data. But we see little, or none, efforts
on  how to produce such data. I think current user interfaces are not
adapted to the complex feature universe.

Thanks for your suggestion. I should directly contact the GMLAS project
team.


Best regards

Rui Cavaco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] set unspecified precision -1 on double in
	spatiaLite and org providers
Message-ID: <1515508442-1be59fa2f8f455ff5e7582365eff3cf3@opengis.ch>


Hi all  
  
We found different behaviors in qgsorgprovider and qgsspatialiteprovider regarding the field with the type double.  
In  `QgsSpatiaLiteProvider::convertField` it's set to -1 when it's 0 : [https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/spatialite/qgsspatialiteprovider.cpp#L82-L88](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/spatialite/qgsspatialiteprovider.cpp#L82-L88)  
That's why I decided to change it in `QgsSpatiaLiteProvider::loadFieldsAbstractInterface` as well. The advantage would be, that we could recognize a field with type double when the precision is not zero.  
But when I checked qgsorgprovider, in  `QgsOgrProvider::convertField` the precision is not set (stays what it is) in case of double: [https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L143-L145](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L143-L145)  
I wonder why it's different and I ask you, if you mind, when we just set the precision in any case to -1 when  it's a double value and it's not specified (means 0)?  
  
Thanks   
Dave

Dear members of the Community,

this is a reminder that to participate in GSoC also this year we need
you to send us (admins:  <gsoc-admin at osgeo.org>) the URL for your
project's ideas page.

Every idea should indicate a title, a description, 2 mentors and a
test for the students to submit to your evaluation. The test aims at
evaluating if the student is capable for the project, so please design
the test having in mind the skills required to complete the project.

Time is short, we need to collect all URLs by Jan 20.

Thanks and please forward to your project community.

Cheers,

Rui, I would formulate that differently.
I have been working with INSPIRE datasets tooand a bit involved in some
hydrography model workgroups.

IMO, gml is nice because it allows to fully respect the UML design and
offer theoretical interoperability. Seems become darker when trying to use
it for real interoperability and everyday's use.
 It is not meant to be a physical implementation for editing. It is
extremely hard to work with, with because of cascaded schema dependencies,
XML heaviness, lack of index,  very wide possibilities of spatial object
modeling (so much ways to describe a simple box is crazy).
So to me, the GML is a exchange format, and should be implemented in a
transactional DB for editing , or simply for fast reading. That's why BRGM
approach relying on a spatial DB for real use sounds a goopd strategy to
me.
A bit like UML model of database can be used directly and needs to
implemented in a physical model in a relational database for real work.

Regards,
régis

I would much appreciate if we could setup this kind of infrastructure in
a way that it's maintainable via scripts (in the qgis repo or another
one). Just like with a .travis.yml file and similar.

This will allow to spread the load between different developers. E.g.
when new dependencies are added (see libzip for auxiliary storage and
similar, qca, ...), we shouldn't need a maintainer to update this dep,
the one opening the pull request should be able to do this himself.

I guess AWS would be fine for this kind of setup where we only have a
minimal maintenance effort directly on the infrastructure (as opposed to
managing physical servers or virtual machines).

I haven't been working a lot with Inspire but we recently started to
work more and more with Interlis, which is a Swiss standard but should
be quite similar. After all it's an object oriented modelling language,
also with a UML designer.

The workflow in general is:

- Take a model (interlis)
- Import it into a postgis database (ili2pg)
- Create QGIS project to work with this database (QGIS configuration)
- Use QGIS to work with the data
- Export it into an .xtf interlis exchange file (ili2pg)

We have been working on a plugin called "project generator" which reads
postgis database schemas and preconfigures QGIS projects with relations,
field configuration and more [1]. It reads any kind of postgis database
and reads meta information. If additional Interlis meta information is
around (ili2db creates additional tables) it will also take this into
account.

I could very well imagine that a similar approach is possible with
Inspire data. It's a matter of bringing the data into a postgis
database, extracting additional meta information and exposing this to a
QGIS project (possibly also integrating this into the projectgenerator
plugin which is built quite modular).

And then, there's still plenty of things left to do concerning
enhancements to sublayers, forms and plenty of other things which can
potentially reside under the same umbrella but can be implemented step
by step.

I think it is already: the whole thing is a bunch of scripts (part of the
docker recipe) and a Vagrant file on a github repo, the purpose of the
vagrant is to build the docker on AWS and push it to docker hub when done.

It's all public so if you want you can just copy it into the main QGIS repo.

But as I said, there is no need to do it now because Boundless is still
building the dockers on AWS every night, unless/until we want to change
something and the PR is not accepted.

Hi Rui,

Co-author of the mentioned "GML application schema toolbox" plugin here :)

The people who first launched this plugin have similar goals I think (I
added Sylvain from BRGM in cc).
Even if this is still small (we are at a second iteration where the
first was a proof of concept), some interest is now raised among
possible users in Europe.

It was chosen in this first step to focus on a transformation from an
object model (GML) to a relational database model in order to fit QGIS'
data model. This is a hard exercise (I've done a first shot and Even
Rouault a bigger one in GDAL) but already gives interesting results.

The QGIS plugin is a graphical interface over this GDAL driver. It also
creates QGIS layers and relations and forms between them from metadata.

Moreover, the GDAL driver is already able to be used in "writing mode",
meaning that you can not only read complex features content, but modify
an existing one. This is a first step toward "producing" INSPIRE data as
you said.

This gives something usable, even if apart from simple toy examples, the
number of layers, fields and relations become very hard to follow. There
should still be a way to represent data and relations in a more
"hierarchical way" sometime I think.

If you have experience with telecom software that have more advanced
features and some funding to enhance QGIS in this field, I am sure we
can come with enhancements that make this kind of projects more and more
useable.

Am I the only one thinking it's not a good idea that 2.18.x is
automatically replaced by 3.x ?

Hi Denis,

As to my understanding, 2.18 is not automatically replaced by 3.x

2.18 will remain LTR until 3.6 is released, because 3.4 will be the next 
LTR - right Jürgen?

Andreas

To my understanding: if you have 2.18.x in Osgeo4W, it's not the LTR. And
this branch will then receive 3.0

So to keep 2.18.x, one will have to check a new entry in Osgeo4W installer.

qgis-ltr in OSGeo4W is 2.14.  qgis is 2.18.  qgis-dev is 2.99.

When 3.0 is released:

qgis-ltr will be 2.18.  qgis will be 3.0  and qgis-dev will be 3.1.

Just like one every other release that follows an ltr release.

Same for the debian/ubuntu repositories:

debian-ltr currently carries 2.14
debian carries 2.18
debian-nightly carries 2.99

After the 3.0 release .0:

debian-ltr will have 2.18
debian will have 3.0
debian-nightly 3.1

qgis-ltr is the current ltr that is not also the current release (ie. never a
brand new release),
qgis is the current release,
qgis-dev is current master.

Version numbers change - that definition doesn't.

I'm just wondering if it makes sense to release a new major version under
the same "branches".

If I take Qt's example, there's 2 distinct package name.

But if it's just me who is worried about such a change, then forget about
it.

I like this timeline. We've got a LOT of work to do to bring stability
to 3.0, and I'd prefer for users to have a great first impression of
this release.

Given how big a release it is, we're going to get a lot of new and
return users (who have previously used and moved away from QGIS)
installing and evaluating 3.0. For the sake of a couple of weeks I'd
prefer squash a few more of these bugs and give a great initial
impression of QGIS 3.0 to these users.

Hi Saber,
thanks for checking. The sample mentioned in the ticket loads fine, but
its SRS is not recognized correctly (it appears as a custom EPSG,
whereas it should be 4326, I guess).
Further tests reveal that other gribs (downloaded with ZyGrib) have an
incorrect extent, and there fore are not loaded correctly. You can check
yourself or use this sample:
http://www.faunalia.eu/~paolo/grib2.bz2
As for crayfish, I'd need a solution using plain QGIS, as I'd like to
build a plugin based on grib. Furthermore, I would not like to use
non-Debian binaries on my system.
All the best.

Moreover, bands do not seem to come with the appropriate metadata in
this sample. These could be effects of Zygrip downloads, however.
Thanks for any hint.

Hi Paolo,

You can download the files directly from ECMWF. Maybe it is a bug with the
ZyGrib data processing.

For Crayfish you can compile it yourself:

Hi Régis.

I want to make clear that my concern is the world of complex features and
not GML by itself. I fully agree with you that complex features are best
handled in a relational database.

Don't you think that something is missing in our graphical user interfaces
to help data creators/editors/maintainers deal with such complexity?

Regards,

Rui

I know there is excitement, and I'm sure all the devs want the release done.
However, I think Juergen's proposal is the best (release 23 Feb):

- more debugging time
- tallies with established release cycle
- respects the advice and plans of the Release Manager

I 100% prioritise stability over early release. As you know, I'm not a QGIS
dev, so I'm speaking to you both as a user and as the manager of an
organization's installation base (about 30 seats). 

Yes, I know you will say we have LTR, but a significant aim of the QGIS
project is to increase our user base. As Nyall says, many people will hear
about the 3 release and try QGIS out. Stability is absolutely critical for
those first-timers. Their point of comparison is everyone's favourite
proprietary GIS. I imagine they also prioritise stability.

Hope this makes sense

Tom

+1 for this timeline. This will allow us to fix more bugs and provide users
with more stable 3.0 release.

+1 for more stable release even if it's a few more weeks

If feature freeze is confirmed, I would also suggest to send an email to
all plugin devs to say that no plugin will work anymore and to give some
pointers as to how to migrate the plugins to python/qgis 3. Most devs are
probably well aware of upcomming QGIS3, but this may still wake up some of
us, and centralizing the info about how to migrate to QGIS3 would be nice
for all of us anyway.

Another email to both dev and uses mailing lists to encourage people to
test extensively with actual projects and to remind people on best
practices to report bugs (especially concerning whether a bug should be
flagged as blocker or not) would also probably be very useful to have
better feedback from testing.

Thank you very much and happy new year :)

Olivier

Thanks everyone for the great work!
As a power user, plugin developer and (Q)GIS teacher (I face dozens of
professional users frequently) I'm totally in favour to post-pone release
and gain reliability and stability.

I don't think there's such a compulsive need to release sooner. Release
often, release soon, will probably be necessary for the next minors (bug
fixing).

@Denis I was worried as you, but I believe an Osgeo4W user is a kind of
user with enough skills to manage the switch. Most users will probably use
the standalone installer.... I guess.

Hi Rui,

Thanks for your interest in our work.
Indeed, as Hugo mentioned, we are just at the beginning of the process on GMLAS toolbox.
GUI aspects were initially left a bit on the side so that we could focus on solving various technical issues.

We presented our work in many places last year (FOSS4G-E, OGC workshops, INSPIRE conf). It validated the approach but also confirmed that now is the time to work on the GUI.
I have planned to focus a bit more on it this year.
I'd be more than happy to share efforts and ideas on this.

FYI: you can have a glimpse at the way we seek to use the toolbox for the French GroundWater Information Network in the presentation I gave at the OGC HydroDWG Workshop last year:
https://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/HydrologyDWG/WorkshopTuscaloosa2017  (powepoint and audio).
 
Best,
Sylvain

Objet : Re: [QGIS-Developer] The need for intuitive complex feature edit support in QGIS 3+

Hi Rui,

Co-author of the mentioned "GML application schema toolbox" plugin here :)

The people who first launched this plugin have similar goals I think (I added Sylvain from BRGM in cc).
Even if this is still small (we are at a second iteration where the first was a proof of concept), some interest is now raised among possible users in Europe.

It was chosen in this first step to focus on a transformation from an object model (GML) to a relational database model in order to fit QGIS'
data model. This is a hard exercise (I've done a first shot and Even Rouault a bigger one in GDAL) but already gives interesting results.

The QGIS plugin is a graphical interface over this GDAL driver. It also creates QGIS layers and relations and forms between them from metadata.

Moreover, the GDAL driver is already able to be used in "writing mode", meaning that you can not only read complex features content, but modify an existing one. This is a first step toward "producing" INSPIRE data as you said.

This gives something usable, even if apart from simple toy examples, the number of layers, fields and relations become very hard to follow. There should still be a way to represent data and relations in a more "hierarchical way" sometime I think.

If you have experience with telecom software that have more advanced features and some funding to enhance QGIS in this field, I am sure we can come with enhancements that make this kind of projects more and more useable.

Hi Denis

The container still seems to be showing as two months old
(https://hub.docker.com/r/qgis/qgis/). Did your build time out again?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Paolo,

If you open grib files in QGIS, off course it is GDAL who is responsible
for that :-)

I played a bit with netcdf/grib files recently, found some problems and
reported these in trac.osgeo.org/gdal and those were picked up/fixed by
Even Rouault pretty good:

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/7103

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/7104

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/7086

Not sure if your problem is one of those, but maybe you just have to
wait for a newer gdal version ;-)
Or create issues for it?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thank you all for your replies.

Matthias, the "project generator" seems very interesting, I would like to
know more about it.

Don't take me wrong Hugo, when I say "small" I didn't want to diminish your
work, surely developing those schema construction features is not an easy
task.  As I think you all understood, my primary concern is for GUI and
interactivity.

Now I see you Hugo and Sylvain and the GMLAS team are on a extremely
interesting path. I must go deeper into your work and see how I can
participate. I will now check the presentation links you suggested.

When I mention funding from telecoms, I still don't have any contacts for
that. But I think that there is an open window of opportunity and this
might be of huge "customer" interest, specially for medium / smaller
companies in all kinds of utilities management.

If the result will be of real value for INSPIRE work, INSPIRE - interested
agencies should also come forward in support, given the present
difficulties found in many member states to implement INSPIRE.

Best regards

Rui Cavaco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Fresh QGIS3 misses all kind of 'default' options
	on first start
Message-ID: <892283c1-e389-36db-963a-bc8463d09668@duif.net>


Hi Devs,

Currently if you start QGIS3 for the first time, all kind of default
options (from the Options Dialog) are not yet 'saved' to QgsSettings().

To test:
- remove ~/.share/local/QGIS
- start QGIS
- choose 'I want a clean start. Don't import my QGIS 2 settings.'

Now in Python console type:

QgsSettings().value( "help/helpSearchPath" )
which will return an emtpy list (of search paths)

Open Settings/Options/System properties and see there is:
https://docs.qgis.org/$qgis_short_version/$qgis_locale/docs/user_manual/
in Documentation paths there.

NOW click OK and

>>> QgsSettings().value( "help/helpSearchPath" )
['https://docs.qgis.org/$qgis_short_version/$qgis_locale/docs/user_manual/']

So Question: is there a way to 'silently' save all those options for a
fresh user? I'm not so familiar with how those dialogs are constructed,
so can we 'submit' all tabs in one? Or should we submit them one by one?

Ah, it appears that clicking OK once from whatever tab will 'save' (at
least this path) to QgsSettings()...

Otherwise, current situation will be that a new user upon clicking
any(!) help button will always be shown with the daft "Oops! QGIS help
is currently not available. This is likely because: ... " message.

Hi Olivier

Thanks for your suggestion - we discussed this at the PSC meeting on Monday night and Paolo Cavallini  is going to be putting together a resource page for plugins developers and then putting out a call for them to start their plugin migration work.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Fresh QGIS3 misses all kind of 'default'

Hi Richard,

Good point!

We have in QGIS3 a new qgis_global_settings.ini file where we can put
global default settings. These global settings can be override later by
the users.

I think we need to start populating this file with reasonable settings.

You might suggest some of those settings to start with.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

thanks for your feedback. I'm using gdal 2.2.3, so your bugs should be
fixed already. I wanted to check with others before opening tickets.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS3 - Processing : display the HTML outputs
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7jRP+HvRQ4=RRM+C96yVhTDXuSnoKWbXnW5oWYxDEjLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying QGIS 3 these days. In the processing toolbox, when I run some
algs with an HTML output, the processing dialog is closed just after the
results are produced, and not displayed.

You can test this behaviour with the Raster statistics algs.

What is the python way to tell QGIS to display the HTML results ? I tried
this
https://github.com/ghtmtt/DataPlotly/pull/65/files#diff-c2089b16fcc7b309bc3bf9e5a9f6e114R110

Should I add an HTML output ?

Regards
Michaël

I seem to remember seeing something that said that QgsDockWidget should be

Has anyone had problems with this or should I not use QgsDockWidget and
stick with QDockWiget? I'm trying this on QGIS 2.99.

It's not a PyQt class - it's in the QGIS gui library:

from qgis.gui import QgsDockWidget

Hi Michaël,

HTML outputs does not open automatically. You need to open Results panel
to see them. Double-clicking on the result item will open it in the
default browser.

Hope this helps

Hi Alexander,

It helps a lot thanks. It solves the "display outputs" issue.

Another issue I notice : IMHO I think the "auto-close after run" behaviour
is a bit cumbersome for the user. It means the user need to reopen the alg
dialog each time after a successfull run. Imagine you would like to test
different values for inputs. Instead of run / go back to the form to change
an input / run, you need to run / reopen the alg / re-enter all inputs (you
have lost the previous values) / run / reopen ...

We should have an option to let the user decide "Keep the alg dialog open"
which make it possible to run the same alg more than once. Perhaps there is
an hidden option or setting to do so ?

Regards
Michaël

Ok, I have found the option in QGIS Options dialog / Tab Processing / Check
"Keep dialog open after running an algorithm". I think this option should
be checked as a default value. Any opinion on this ?

I trie the Result panel : for the "Raster layer statistics" alg. I can see
the run listed in the Processing result viewer. I think we should propose a
way to display the result directly inside QGIS for the text, html and other
"readable" output format.

I agree. I would prefer to have the "Keep dialog open after running an
algorithm" on by default.

No sure why it was decided to have it like that...but I also think
that keepping it open by default is a better option.

+1 from me.

things are proceeding well:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3

Please check. I think we should also add something about Python API docs
and QGIS3 compat module, then we can start promoting it.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Project migration 2.18 > 3.0 - QGIS Server GetMap
 output very big images compared to a "from scratch" project
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7N=_g0vBz=FJU00p97LGFt=fDZBwqvcRz==XbaLGxUAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am testing QGIS 3 Server.
When I create a project from scratch in QGIS 3, and use it to publish WMS
service, the getMap requests return correct PNG images :
~ 100 ko for a size of ~ 1500 X 800 pixels

When I open a project made with 2.18 and save it with QGIS 3, and publish
it, I get huge PNG files :
~ 4,5 Mo (!) for the same layer, configuration and getMap request.

I am wondering what is happening. Here are the files and projects :
https://framadrop.org/r/JpTgir91jk#ZHFXi6ejrGQ/1NA2TbV4rD/HEfeqqbzA5XaVjrK+aqQ=

I have not been able to see any major difference explaining this behaviour.

Thanks in advance

Michaël

Hi,

I have seen a difference :
* in the migrated file, the property <WMSImageQuality
type="int">90</WMSImageQuality> is kept inside the QGS.
* in a QGIS 3 project from scratch, this flag is not written if the default
value is used : menu Project / QGIS Server / WMS Capabilities / Qualite for
JPEG images. The flag is written only if the value is not the default one,
for example if value = 80

This means there is a regression in QGIS 3 Server, which uses this
parameter for PNG and not only for JPEG !

I will search deeper in the code

regards
Michaël

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for the effort of setting up the wiki page, we have started 
migrating some plugins and missed some kind of "standard" 
guidelines/best practices.

  I was not able to find a way to contribute to the wiki, and could not 
find an issue/forum associated with it - I do not know much about QGis' 
team development workflow, so that there may be resources I am not aware 
of (in that case, it might be a good idea to link them from the wiki?).

So I guess this list is the way to go at the moment, I will share my two 
cents based on our experience migrating to QGis3 (we have recently made 
a pull request to complete the migration of profiletool plugin to QGis3 
https://github.com/PANOimagen/profiletool/commit/2631bc4600938d7beeaf6281bcb8de16a6de912c 
and are working on other internal plugins):

-We iniatially thought on creating a compatibility layer to allow Qgis2 
plugins to run (mostly?) unmodified on QGis3; however that seems like a 
bad idea in the long term, and followed the monkey-patching strategy set 
forth by opengis.ch in their qgis2compat plugin 
(https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2compat). This means, we make all the 
code qgis3 compatible, and patch QGis2 on runtime to provide Qgis3 api 
compatibility. In the long term, dropping support for QGis2 should be as 
simple as removing the apicompat module, the plugin's code would remain 
unmodified to keep on running on QGis3.

-Unfortunately qgis2compat has not been updated in the last 10 months, 
and we do not want to add an additional dependency to the plugins, so 
that we have included their apicompat files as needed and completed the 
missing bits we found (e.g. QgsPointXY). We can contribute our additions 
to Qgis2compat if someone is interested.

-There are however some modifications that we have not been able to 
manage with monkeypatching, for instance 
PyQt4.QFileDialog.getOpenFilenames returns a list of files and 
PyQt5.QFileDialog.getOpenFilenames returns a tuple with the list of 
files and the extensions (i.e. PyQt5.QFileDialog.getOpenFilenames == 
PyQt4.QFileDialog.getOpenFilenamesAndFilter); modifying PyQt4's 
behaviour can lead to other plugins, who expect the proper PyQt4 api, to 
stop working. We prefer not to introduce 'new' functions (i.e. 
PyQtx.QFileDialog.getOpenFilenames5) that would not be neither PyQt4 nor 
PyQt5, and the best option we have found is to check PyQt version or use 
a try/except to manage compatibility. We do not like it, but it is the 
least ugly solution we could find. If someone has a nicer/more 
elegant/more pythonic solution we are willing to hear from you :)

Hi Javier,

The wiki is 'just' a github wiki. Can you try to edit it with your
github credentials? Or create a github account for it?

If that fails, I'll try to copy your info in it.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

I think this is not currently feasible with PyQt5 at the moment (using
QgsDockWidget as a top class for a UI and loading it with uic.loadUiType)

Here is a description of the issue on PyQt mailing list
https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2017-October/039647.html

Here is a part of the reply from Phil Thomson:

> I can confirm it is a bug, however the fix is non-trivial so it won't get
fixed quickly. The fundamental problem is that the code has the assumption
that all custom widgets will reside in the PyQt5 package hard-coded (but
even then it's not quite as simple as that).

I just pinged Phil to get an update on this as he said he would fix it.

Best wishes,

Denis

Hi Richard,

My bad, I did not notice that I was logged in in a different browser, I 
just assumed I did not have the proper rights to edit it. When logged in 
I see the edit button properly ;)

I will add it to the wiki myself.

Thanks, and sorry for the noise...

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Ubuntu Package Releases and GDAL Dependencies
Message-ID: <454591AE08FDD64E8B82954659BC1BEA520E05D3@COR-EXCHANGE.cor.local>


Stable isn't necessarely more "unstable" than unstable - since "stable" is almost never really well tested.
Maybe that depends on your definition of "really well", but anyway, just saying.
Also, stable doesn't mean bug-free, it just mean stable, that ist o say, staying as is. 

If you have issues with default-packages/dependecies, why don't you just containerize it and create a snapcraft-package ? 
Maybe someone also wants to have 2 different applications that both use the GDAL of a (different) specific version each on the same system ...
That could never be stable since one oft he two would probably not work. 

Snappycraft also has the advantage that you need to create only ONE package for all the major distros, such as Ubuntu&Derivates., Debian, Fedora/CentOS, Arch, Suse, ScientificLinux, Gentoo, etc.

Then you can test that one package, and then you know it works or doesn't, and dependencies only get updated when your snapcraft package gets updated.
This would be my definition of "stable". 

Also, snapcraft would make it possible to distribute commercial packages, e.g. with google-maps material, through snapcraft-store
https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/snap-command  
snap buy <package name>


https://snapcraft.io 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/743068/how-to-install-snapcraft-on-14-04  
https://developer.ubuntu.com/core  
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/goodbye-apt-and-yum-ubuntus-snap-apps-are-coming-to-distros-everywhere/ 

You can also get snapcraft on 14.04:
sudo apt install snapcraft snapd

to install package:
sudo snap install <package name>

to update package:
sudo snap refresh <package name>

to remove package: 
sudo snap remove <package name>

search for package:
snap find <package name>

list installed packages:
sudo snap list

e.g. 
sudo snap install nmap 
sudo snap refresh nmap

You should have a look at UbuntuGIS development to see that it is mostly the work of one person now. Packages are updated for OSGeo-Live and copied to ubuntugis-unstable, after a while (no policy or guidelines) the packages from ubuntugis-unstable get copied to ubuntugis-stable.
This generally happens during an Ubuntu releases lifecycle, not ideal for production systems.

For production systems one should not rely on 3rd party repositories, other than the one the company maintains itself where it does all the integration work.

> libqgis-app2 libgdal20 (>= 2.0.1)

The version requirement for libgdal20 are determined based on which symbols the code in the dependent package uses, qgis & qgis-servers don't use any symbols introduced after GDAL 1.8.0, libqgis-dev does but no symbols introduced after GDAL 1.10.1, etc.

Hi,

I run script in python console as shown below. It Works fine if you select a
polygon layer and make it activeLayer.

I am actually trying to connect the script with a pushButton

Therefore, if I run same sctipt in a function then QGIS always crash.

Am I doing something wrong or there is a bug in QGIS3.0

Thanks,

Olcay Ebcin

 

WORKS

 

myLayer=iface.activeLayer()

slyr = QgsShapeburstFillSymbolLayer()

slyr.setColorType(QgsShapeburstFillSymbolLayer.SimpleTwoColor)

slyr.setColor = QColor(181, 123, 169, 255)

slyr.setColor2 = QColor(0, 0, 255, 255)

slyr.setBlurRadius(0)

slyr.setEnabled(True)

slyr.setLocked(False)

slyr.setUseWholeShape(False)

This is where I'm a little on the fence. I would much rather do it well for
all of the community, than just for my organisation. At the end of the day
my organisation doesn't need to apply special patches for our desktop
usage. But I agree applications that are developed using these libraries or
require core customisation definitely need a in-house managed repository.

Our organisation needs to have a QGIS LTS release supported that works on a
Ubuntu LTS release. Correct me if I'm wrong, but QGIS.org seems to provide
this now with the current release/LTS Debian repositories. It's the QGIS
critical dependencies which have varying policies of support that are the
problem. This seems to be a problem of resources/volunteers at the project
and the distribution packaging level. For example in the GDAL project, 1.10
and 1.11, which are the current GDAL versions in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04
haven't been maintained for many years. Only 2.2.X seems to be getting any
current support currently (thanks Even!). I guess this is part of the wider
problem that was identified by Paul Ramsey in
http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2017/08/foss4g-keynote.html. Somehow we need
to solve this for the wider geospatial OS community.

I'm not sure if this problem is something that can be done by OSGEO or some
other alliance of companies. My feeling is no one company can currently
provide this service as it requires expertise across the full stack, or
enough scale in business to centralise support for the whole stack.

Ok thanks. What's the practical use of this approach if it's tied to
gdal-abi-2-2-2 anyway?

I guess what I'm really looking for is a set of modern packages which are
maintained and aligned with Ubuntu LTS. But from Bas' comments UbuntuGIS
doesn't provide this.

Yes! Actually this is one idea we have been thinking about since Bas'
reply. This approach is what the MacOSX and Windows packages do now. Along
with the overall benefits of a package to install everywhere for LINUX, a
QGIS snap package would enable the use of the latest supported packages,
without dependency hell, and provide all the QGIS features that might not
be available due to standard distro packaging e.g upcoming QGIS 3.0 3D, or
new GDAL format driver, or QT features. Maybe with funding or community
support this PR could be finished https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3545?

Thanks,
Jeremy

When you need newer versions of the core geospatial libraries like GEOS
& GDAL than what is provided in the Ubuntu LTS releases, you'll need
some 3rd party repository because Ubuntu doesn't provide backports. The
geospatial packages in Ubuntu are actually not actively maintained at
all, active maintenance only happens in Debian and Ubuntu just copies
its packages from Debian.

The nature of LTS releases is that they don't change the versions of the
packages they provide, Debian stable, Ubuntu LTS and RedHat/CentOS don't
differ much in the respect.

When the users of those distributions do have a need for newer packages
they need to get backports somehow, either through some 3rd party
repository over which they have no control, or their own in-house
repository which they do control. The latter is the best option to
prevent any surprises when the repository gets new versions, it does
require integration work to rebuild all related packages to work with
the new versions of the libraries in question.

As long as the geospatial packages in Debian and UbuntuGIS are
maintained by volunteers the users of those packages can't expect more
than work on a best effort basis. No one is employed to maintain these
packages for the wider community, although there seems to be a need at
least for corporate Ubuntu users. Mapgears sponsored work on UbuntuGIS
in the past, but that was apparently not successful enough to continue.

One of the benefits of open source is that companies are not dependent
on suppliers, and can employ people to the needed work in-house. This
work can be shared with the community, but generally corporate needs
differ quite a bit from community needs and its cheaper to just keep it
all in-house.

I don't understand the question.

The version requirement in the dependencies reflect the minimum version
the code in the dependent package requires to work with the library.
Some parts of qgis use features introduced in GDAL 2.x whereas other
parts don't use features introduced after GDAL 1.8.0. Because the
various parts of qgis are split into separate packages you get the
different version requirement for gdal for those parts.

There is generally only a single gdal package in the repositories like
in Debian and Ubuntu. Only when one adds a 3rd party repository like
UbuntuGIS is another version of the gdal package available, and you get
integration issues like qgis being uninstallable with the UbuntuGIS
dependencies after gdal is updated there but qgis hasn't been rebuilt
with the new version yet.

Thanks to everyone for confirming that this is not just me and that it is a
bug. So the question I now have is whether it is better to use
uic.loadUiType or to compile the ui to python code from a best practice
point of view?

Best wishes,

Well, I think using pyuic is the only way at the moment to use
QgsDockWidget as top widget.
But for any other case, using uic.loadUiType is eaiser since there no
Python path to deal with when using pyuic.

Cheers,

Understood. Maybe Snaps is the solution to all of this, as it provides
binaries for a larger user base. I'm interested on the community view on
this.

One of the benefits of open source is that companies are not dependent

on suppliers, and can employ people to the needed work in-house.


In regards to not being locked into companies, I don't see that providing
more robust community packaging is going to change this siutation.

I'm not really clear what the community vs corporate difference are. What
are they? I would say that it's a very grey area between who's community
and who's corporate.

IMHO I don't think this is the case, at least for software with a large
user base. I also think this approach means that the QGIS LINUX desktop
uptake for anything other than very large organisations or software
developers will be low. Look at the Windows and MacOSX environment (even in
personal home usage), packaging is done once by the provider of the product
then users will use that packaging without modification. I think many small
to medium size organisation couldn't justify the resources to employ
someone to do packaging.

I think I understand better now. But if the package name includes the
version number e.g libgdal20 or abi-2-2-2 and that's package is a QGIS
dependency, how can having a lower ABI version requirement below the
package version name make any difference? I do except that libgdal20
(>=2.1) does make some sense, but libgdal20 (>=1.8) seems to be silly.

Jeremy

Yes, but has not happened yet. It seems that people need to be employed
to work on Ubuntu, no one has volunteered to do so.

And this makes sense, Ubuntu is a corporate backed distribution unlike
Debian. And many corporate users choose Ubuntu over Debian because of
that. Why volunteer to do work in that environment when you could be
paid to do so?

Snaps and containers just complicate maintenance, you'll have many more
images to update to fix security issues in the packages they contain.

That's the major downside of the isolation they provide.

Corporate users have schedules, deadlines and financial interests (e.g.
selling support/training), community users (e.g. volunteers and
hobbyists) generally don't.

Participating in open source projects for a company generally pays off
when they can share the burden. When a single company supports an open
source project they don't have the benefit of many shoulders lessening
the burden.

I don't know any Windows & OSX users that only use the software included
in Windows & OSX. They all use additional software from elsewhere, and
in the case of OSX generally from open source projects like MacPorts and
Homebrew.

Most users of any software are just that, users. They don't need to
modify it for their needs, they make do with what they have. For the
other users there is open source to adapt to their needs.

In house packaging is not a full time job, it will be among the tasks
for someone doing system engineering or development most likely.

The "20" in the libgdal20 package name is not the version number, it's
the SOVERSION of the library which is independent of the software version.

Shared library packages need to reflect the library SONAME to have the
package dependencies reflect the required library SONAME. A SONAME
consists of the library name and its SOVERSION, like libgdal.so.20 which
is translated to the package name libgdal20.

Not all libraries do versioning properly, and not all library packages
do naming correctly. Take libarmadillo for example, the maintainer does
not use symbols files nor shlibs to set the version requirements for
packages that link to libarmadillo, which results in segfaults like this:

 https://bugs.debian.org/885971

The minimum required version of the library package was not represented
in the dependencies, so upgrading libgdal20 which was compiled with a
newer version of armadillo did not also cause the upgrade of the
libarmadillo package as it should have.

The version requirements in dependencies are there to help apt do the
right thing when its upgrading packages.

Bas

Hi Dave,

the proposal is that

QgsFields::precision() always returns -1 for doubles, correct?

Sounds fine to me, 0 might be a real value (0 digits after the decimal
point) while -1 clearly indicates an arbitrary precision (as in double).

Message-ID: <181eeacd-d65c-bb7c-92a7-fa1d3247adb3@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

thought to look at
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17812
which is about showing 2 tabs of a QStackedWidget when you search in the
layer properties

It is showing both widgetUnsupported and another tab:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/3d/qgsvectorlayer3drendererwidget.cpp#L49

I try to understand 'searchText':

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsoptionsdialogbase.cpp#L212

But I do not understand if the problem is in the searching or the use of
the QStackedWidget....

Anybody can give me a pointer on how this searching in all the widgets
should work?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Last call for switching to github issue tracker
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+ZtwRCdAJtByJ8C0XsKi3ctiJM8jXGmDVWdXSV7Tgv2cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'ld like to raise a last call to switch to github issue tracker before the
release.
I'd like to summarize briefly why.

Pros (to me):
- integration with code and mainly with PR
- avoid multiplication of platforms
- so much more powerful (attachment, text formatting, referecing issue/PR,
pinging people, fitlering/searching/tagging, possibility to plugin external
issue management such as zenhub or others)
- so much more responsive, mobile friendy and easy to use
- lower infrstructure management on QGIS team (would be available for other
stuff)
- opportunity to clean the list

A proof that current situation is sub-optimal:
- people are pointing to code issues directly in comments of commits on
github rather than creating an issue (high chance of getting lost)
- people send mail to the mailing saying they have created an issue (sic)
- people creates new gitub repo for creating issue lists (sic again): see
qgis 3 API or UX changes
- mantra thing is a nightmare for new comers

Why I don't agree on the raised issues to not to move to github:
- migration of existing issues: we have migrated a to a new redmine which
should make migration easier [0].
- Github has a close-source: there is an API and existing tools to migrate
to other issue tracker [1]. I guess it leads down to pragmatic vs ethical
matters.

I would be in favor of using a semi-automatic migration:
- move all open tickets
- propose a tool to migrate others on demand: like a one-click process to
move the features.
But this can be decided afterwards.

I know PSC is (was?) against it, but I feel the majority of devs (and new
issue posters) are for it.
Sorry to hassle on the topic. Let me know if I shall shut-up forever. Or
raise your hand :)

Or can we setup a loomio vote directly???

Best wishes,
Denis

Again: osgeo ids are not a requirement to use our redmine.

Well, I have reconciled myself with the fact we're stuck in the darks of 
Redmine forever, but if there is still any chance for the migration, I'd not 
hesitate for a moment of course.

Hi, 

I think the biggest question: who does all the work to migrate from
Redmine to Github while not loosing all our history? 

The migration attempts so far haven't been very convincing. 

And I don't think that Redmine is so bad usability wise. I agree, the UI
is not as sexy as Github, but it does its job well. It is much more
powerful for finding and filtering. The issues we had with the slow
performance was fixed when moving to a new Machine at Hetzner. The main
argument for github is in my opinion not ease of use - but the
integration with the code base - that is definitely a strength of github
issue reporting. 

To undermine that github is not easy to use for non-dev users: last
Wednesday at the Swiss QGIS user meeting I was in the meeting for QWC2.
Users had no idea at all how Github works and could be used for issue
reporting. One had to explain it to them and teach them how to use it.
To assume that using github is self-explanatory for non-tech users is a
wrong assumption.

A huge +1 from me. I was too intimidated to add issues to Redmine for some
time through not understanding what some fields meant.

I started working on it some time ago and thought it looked quite
promising. I stopped the work because of lack of conviction that there's
a perspective for this.

Agreed, it's better than before.
Because no more mantra, usable performance.
On the other hand I don't prefer it's search and filtering options.

I wouldn't claim that for either of the two platforms. There's a
learning curve for both. Myself, I happen to meanwhile embrace markdown
but struggle with the redmine syntax. Not because it's worse, just
because I am too lazy to learn another one.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Shouldn't $area return values in the measument
	units of the project
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GGRnE8hXjniDBCgM+8UeBE-NdVtK4jZVUTPYSxkimiSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am fighting this again. Looking at the $area function description it says:

"Returns the area of the current feature. The area calculated by this
function respects both the current project's ellipsoid setting and area
unit settings. For example, if an ellipsoid has been set for the project
then the calculated area will be ellipsoidal, and if no ellipsoid is set
then the calculated area will be planimetric."

But whatever I do in the project properties, $area always returns me the
results in the same unit, the layer's units. But if I check the measurement
tools and the derived area in the feature identify results, the values are
converted to the unit I have chosen.

The project and the layer are at the same CRS which is in feet.

What is wrong?
- the $area function?
- It's description?
- Or me?

thanks!

Alexandre Neto

Hi,

Good point, Denis!

Mathias already have done a lot to support the migration.
I volunteer to help on this task.

Hi all,
+1 too.
My main concern is that I now fail to search efficiently for redmine
issues, because there are so many now. And this leads to duplicates, or
even worst, no declaring the issue because the process is too long.
Github issues are very well indexed by google, which doesn't seem to be the
case for redmine. (but this probably can be improved - not sure how)

When I show in formations where you have to / can make reports, ask 
questions, etc., the users - who are not all power users, far from it... 
- prefer user-friendly interfaces and a single source easily googleable.
Apart from the different forums or stackexchange, GitHub is the best 
place to do this.

Open question: How do you feel, (Have you ever had any thoughts), about 
migrate to gitlab (and using github as a mirror)?

Hi Loïc,
using both gitlab and github, I'd definitly would be in favor of gitlab,
which would allow us to host our own servers. That would imply a big task
switching travis to gitlab-ci.
Cheers

For me as a simple user, the main obstacle of posting issues in redmine  
is, that I fear to produce a duplicate, cause I didn't even learn over the  
years how to efficiently track an issue down if it already exists.
No idea if github or any other solution is better, but redmine just sucks.

My 2 cents,
Bernd

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] map_id variable of 3d view?
Message-ID: <fa3a9fbd-1c31-1819-c0cf-480be0b6a80c@carto.net>

Hi,

There is a variable called @map_id - which is 'canvas' for the main QGIS 
map canvas. In map composer it can have a user-defined id. I wonder, 
what is the map_id of a 3D canvas? And what are the map_ids of 
additional 2D canvases besides the main one?

The reason I ask is that I want to create symbology rules for 2d only. 
The same symbology rule should be supressed in the 3d view, because in 
3d there are other representations (cylinder, spheres, models). So I 
thought I could make a symbology rule that says "@map_id != '3dcanvas'"

Thanks for your help,

Andreas

Hi there,

here [1], Kristian informs that the new (long awaited) new version of
PROJ.4 will be out soon.

Will its new version be supported by QGIS3 or isn't a support planned
right now?

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi Tobias,

Thanks for the pointer.

I have pretty much no idea of the implications, but I guess it's a mjor
topic.
I open an issue on qgis_3.0 API to discuss it
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/82

Hi Tom,

I manually build the image and pushed it to the docker.
That should hopefully solve your issue while waiting for a better solution.
Sorry for the troubles!

This is the main reason why I'd fighting for people to have an
alternative to GitHub. Learning is an hard process. Finding yourself
with knowledge about a closed software at the end of that process is
a huge disservice to yourself (IMHO). You'll be stuck with that
dependency.

How about learning something you can keep using, sharing and
adapt to your needs ?

How about *adding* gitlab-ci, rather than *switching* ?
With PostGIS and GEOS we have both Travis adn Gitlab-CI
and Drone and Jenkins watching after the code...

Hi All

> [QGIS-Developer] Last call for switching to github issue tracker

Given our history on the topic, I doubt very much this is true :-P

> I know PSC is (was?) against it, but I feel the majority of devs (and new issue posters) are for it.

Actually this is not true (correct me if I am wrong PSC): the PSC was against two things:

1) losing all history in issue manager. I think this is reasonable since there is a lot of very useful history in the issue tracker and it was felt that a 'clean slate start ‘ would be a disservice to all those who have raised issues in the past.
2) calling for a migration without a fully tested, fully fleshed out plan to manage the migration from start to finish. This means someone taking responsibility for the *whole* process which so far hasn’t been forthcoming.

In Essen we voted against migrating to GitHub issues (even though many of use were in favour of to idea) because of these reasons. If items 1 and 2 above can be resolved, I don’t think you will find too much resistance from the PSC (though I will let other PSC members speak for themselves if this is the case or not).


@sandro: the wiki markup of GitHub is Markdown (an open format) which is widely used in many places so it is definitely a re-useable skill beyond GitHub. The converse is true for Redmine’s markup language which seems pretty arcane after using Markdown.

Regards

Tim

That is exactly what it was in my memory too.

Mathias and Juergen both tried some of those migrating scripts OR
created something else. Hitting for example Github-thresholds for max nr
of requests etc, loosing comments and inner linking, had problems with
user mapping etc
Myself I also tried something, and besides this tried to invent some
tag-system to be a alternative for the 'categories' we have now
(https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/temp/issues/18).

Some conclusions (at that time):
- our Redmine version was (at that time) too old to be used for newer
migrate scripts
- Github was not very friendly for migrating our huge issue list
- Some dev's wanted to hold full history, while others were ok with
starting from 3/scratch
- Nobody took the time to further investigate, and people told us that
speed was the main issue on the old Redmine, so we upgraded Redmine AND
put it on a dedicated fast server now.

But I'm pretty sure that IF somebody takes lead and:
- migrates all our current issues with history and comments and users
- convinces all/most devs (it is not a PSC descision in my view)

That we can move to Github or Gitlab or Gitea

First step would be to try out one of those scripts, see if you get
those to work...
OR
convince people that we should start with an empty slate for 3.0...

Hi all,

This move from redmine to gitlab (and from transifex to weblate) is not
a technological decision. It's a move towards a more open source
project, open to more people to participate and contribute.

If the argument against this move is "we don't want to lose anything
from the previous workflow" we will never move on. This is an easy
argument to keep the things as they are. It is an argument just based on
tools and technology. We should be more concerned about the community.
QGIS is the community. A dynamic and inclusive worldwide QGIS community
will keep an awesome QGIS application.

We need to decide if we prefer to loose something in favour of a much
more open source project. We all know to be "open source" is more than
release the sources. If it is difficult for users to report bugs, the
most basic thing in a open source project, the project is not so open.
Being an open source also means be dependent on other open source
projects. If there are things we can contribute to gitlab, to weblate,
etc, we will do it, as we already do with FOSS4G related projects.
Others are also dependent on QGIS and trust QGIS community to keep the
project up and running.

This is mostly a PSC decision. To be less or more open is a major
decision, related with principles. That is why PSC members don't have to
be developers, because this is not a technological decision.

If we want to move, we will move and there will be no technological
constraints we can't solve.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

I can confirm. I Still believe loosing all our history of open and
closed issues would be a serious damage to the project.

I see the first a a serious problem, the second will be far easier or
even non existent IMHO.

Message-ID: <ac2daf7b3bf321dbdf7eb2252afe4664.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Dear developers!

Just before the upcoming freeze and the release of QGIS3, I would like
to remind you of a bug: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/571

Summary:
As part of the conversion to ETRS89 for national surveying within the
European Union, for example, the projection EPSG:25832 was used for
most of Germany. Unfortunately, the definition in the QGIS or PROJ.4
database shares the same parameters as EPSG:3044, so that shapefiles
(and maybe other formats, which don't have an explicite EPSG-tag)
that do not come from QGIS and are in EPSG:25832 are incorrectly
interpreted as EPSG:3044.

I was able to observe many users over the year, which do not correct
the projection neither for work within QGIS, nor for saving (they are
not aware of the problem) Worse still: when saving, EPSG:3044 is
written to the PRJ file (for shapefiles). Thus, the error manifests
itself permanently. There are also other

This, of course, also causes other problems: If a file has been
loaded into EPSG:3044 but a WMS does not know this projection, the
content  will not be displayed and/or there is an error message
(I had this several times in office).

This is probably related to the acutal (nearly outdated) PROJ.4 API
and might disappear when it is being updated (and integrated into
QGIS). Since EPSG:3044 comes earlier in the definition lists, QGIS
(or PROJ.4) machtes the first result and breaks.

Resulting problems:
On the one hand, this bug makes it difficult to interact with QGIS
and  other GIS (data exchange between different offices, authorities
and  companies) on a daily basis. On the other hand, it casts a bad
light  on QGIS itself... I am sure that the majority of QGIS users
do not understand that QGIS actually consists of many small libraries
(GDAL, PROJ. 4 etc.). Haters's will say: "priceless is useless".

Possible workaround:
We should check all SRS/CRS, where the parameters overlap. Then we
should order those "duplicates" by the frequency of use (for exaple
official projections first, follwed by historical projections).
Maybe  there's only a handful of projections that are affected.

Best regards,
Tobias

Sounds as a really good idea (for me). Especially in the processing  
toolbox, some algos silently change the CRS, so you have to check the  
outcome each and every time, cause you never know when this bug will hit  
you. I'm giving a course in some days, and having to teach such a  
behaviour in a course feels somehow awkward, leaving a bad taste.

And the gdal-filegdb package containing that driver is not installed by default
in OSGeo4W (ie. not a dependency of qgis-full(-dev) and in turn not in the
standalones).

Once it's installed FileGDB appears in the "Save as..." dialog.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What is SAGA LTR?
Message-ID: <1A0F30E9-222D-4013-B05E-E316E3AD0146@kyngchaos.com>

I just noticed that QGIS 2.18 now only supports SAGA "LTR" (after QGIS 2.18.7).  I didn't find anything about a LTR version on the SAGA website or sourceforge site.

I see in the processing code that it's checking for version 2.3.x, is this the LTR version?

That's my understanding. However "LTR" seems loosely respected here -
e.g. last time I tried, it's unusable on Fedora as SAGA LTR segfaults
with newer gcc builds. (I believe [1] is related, but the debian patch
alone isn't enough to fix it).

I've looked - and for 3d canvases it's not defined (e.g. NULL). That's
because it's assigned by the map settings scope, which is not used in
the 3d renderer. It'd be easy to add a 3d counterpart to this though.
Can you open a bug report?

Additionally 2d canvases will still use "canvas" as the id.

That's a valid use case. But I think it may be better served if the 3d
canvas allowed for use of map themes. This would also bring
consistency between additional 2d canvases and the 3d views.

I agree. I'd find this a very very sore loss. Personally, I'm
referring to historic issues almost on a daily basis, both for
checking what closed issues actually were and also checking for open
issues before working on an area of code.

I'm sure if someone volunteers to set this up and maintain it (****AS

It's all about managing available manpower.

Hi William,

SAGA devs said that SAGA 2.3.0 will be an LTR version without any API breaks
(e.g. parameters renamings etc). So we decided to stick only to this version to
avod numerous issues with the corresponding Processing provider. However
this was announced only in the mailing list and there is no information about it
on the SAGA website.

Additionally, we should try latest gdalsrsinfo from dev. It's a little
bit of work to build the database needed, but we could write a small
plugin, which corrects the SRS after loading it init QGIS (hacky, I know).

Hi Anita,
I’m using Eclipse with QGIS API without problems (with Essen old release) . Import works.
Did you set a PATH variable in the Environment tab? (for me value is: C:\Program Files\QGIS Essen;C:\Program Files\QGIS Essen\bin;C:\Program Files\QGIS Essen\apps\qgis-ltr\bin;C:\Program Files\QGIS Essen\apps\python27\DLLs)

Hi,

I've been following https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/ide_debugging.html to set up Eclipse including "Making eclipse understand the [QGIS] API"

When I import from qgis.core:

from qgis.core import qgsfunction, QgsExpression

qgsfunction is recognized but QgsExpression is not:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3D needs a 2D profile windows
Message-ID: <1516015421012-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

For future consideration and funding I would like to list a feature request
for a 2D profile window in conjunction with the QGIS 3D map I just entered
at:  https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17856
<https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17856>  

Description

If the 3D windows reaches a point where data like subsurface geological
layers can be visualized - need will come for a 2D profile window. Working
with geological 3D models requires a lot of input like boreholes and
geophysical data. This massive input will obfuscate the 3D windows making it
almost useless. When we make 3D geological models at work with software like
Geoscene-3D nobody really use the 3D windows for anything. The 2D profile
window - defined from a buffered polyline in a 2D map window - is where you
model layers and add points in 2D. The points converts automatically to 3D
points in relation to either profile line or if they are snapped to an
existing 3D geometry in the 2D profile map. Interpolation on 3D points
delivers the resulting 3D layer.

Also other 3D subsurface data like drinking water pipes, sewer networks and
power lines could benefit from a 2D profile window.

Regards,
Jakob

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Cannot load WMS capabilities from WMS provider in
	QGIS3 from python
Message-ID: <0F7ACDF8-FEBF-4E29-9EFC-492143461663@3liz.com>

Hi,

We hit a very nasty problem when trying to load projects with wms layer defined from python: loading capabilities fail with timeout error, thus preventing creating any project or layer from python.

The problem has been verified in Debian, Ubuntu and fresh OSX build from master branch.

We have somehow been able to reduce the problem to the loading of the wmsprovider. The following python code provide a minimal example for reproducing the problem:

===================8<==============================
import os
import logging

from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsMessageLog
from qgis.core import QgsProject, QgsProviderRegistry

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# No Display
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM'] = 'offscreen'

qgis_application = QgsApplication([], False )
qgis_application.setPrefixPath('/usr/local', True)
qgis_application.initQgis()

# Log any messages
def writelogmessage(message, tag, level):
    arg = '{}: {}'.format( tag, message )
    if level == QgsMessageLog.WARNING:
        logger.warning(arg)
    elif level == QgsMessageLog.CRITICAL:
        logger.error(arg)
    else:
        logger.info(arg)

messageLog = QgsApplication.messageLog()
messageLog.messageReceived.connect( writelogmessage )


wmsuri = ("contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:4326&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10&format=image/jpeg"
          "&layers=s2cloudless&styles&amp;tileMatrixSet=s2cloudless-wmsc-14"
          "&url=http://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms?" )

# Request Timeout
provider = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().createProvider( "wms", wmsuri )

qgis_application.exitQgis()
del qgis_application
====================8<=============================

This fail with the following qgis errors

WMS: Download of capabilities failed: Operation canceled
Network: Network request https://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities <https://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities> timed out

Note that the following piece of code work perfectly and proceed the request without problems:

==============================================================
from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl, QEventLoop
from PyQt5.QtNetwork import QNetworkRequest

url = QUrl("https://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities")

request = QNetworkRequest()
request.setUrl(url)
manager = QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()
replyObject = manager.get(request)

loop = QEventLoop()
def onfinish(  ):
    print("Qt Return Code:",replyObject.attribute(QNetworkRequest.HttpStatusCodeAttribute))
    answer = replyObject.readAll();
    print(answer[:200],"\n")
    loop.quit()

replyObject.finished.connect( onfinish )
loop.exec()
==============================================================

So this is not fundamentally a problem with the network manager.

At this point we are stuck because the provider do not do something fundamentally different from the last piece of code, 

In qgis code the request execution stall at: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/wms/qgswmscapabilities.cpp#L1964
 
The problem does not occur if we run the project from the Desktop application: we think that there is a problem with the QEventLoop execution but we have no clue atm to check this assumption.

So if anybody have any idea on the subject…...

Regards
David

Nothing that couldn't be fixed, see [https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS-Test/issues](https://github.com/m-kuhn/QGIS-Test/issues) .  
  
The only real limitation (on the technological side) is that we'll not be able to preserve comments as such under the original user account. Noneteless, attribution can be preserved (by adding @name references next to comment quotes).

With current master I cannot find a way to access the "advanced snapping 
configuration" - the panel or dialogue that allow to set snapping 
settings for multiple layers at once.

There is a drop-down button labeled "Advanced configuration" - but 
nothing happens. No dialogue or panel opens.

Is this a bug or do I not understand how this works?

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

This is not really a bug.

The dialog can still be open from application menu -> snapping config.

The toolbar only allows to switch between already configured mode.

Although, I am working on a "bugfix" to show the snapping config under the
tool bar.

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,
Andreas, there was recently a regression, the advanced panel not listing
layers. Should be fixed by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6026 if you
have a more recent build.

Hi Denis,

oh - it is in the project menu. I was searching for it in the settings 
menu ;-)

All these changes ... why was it moved from the settings to the Project 
menu?

Anyway. Thanks for the hint! Much appreciated!

Hi Andreas,

You're not the first one hitting this.
See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16596

The snapping config is mainly application wise before being project
specified.

Message-ID: <4d5c4ede-3d5e-5368-e527-7413bb639e93@carto.net>

Hi,

Every once in a while I change from the english language (my personal 
favourite) to german language, because some of my users prefer the 
german interface and I need to explain the german terms. Switching the 
master version to german I was a bit surprised to see a lot of english 
terms in the german UI. Is translation something that will happen now, 
meaning in the time between feature freeze and release?

Should I assist in the german translation process or is someone already 
working on it?

Yet another reason not to release too soon, I think ...

Thanks and greetings,
Andreas

Hi David,

You  need an event loop to use a Q(qg)NetworkAccessManager, it's
asynchronous.

Hi Alessandro,

Yes, we know that (see the second code in previous mail  ):  the  QgsNetworkAccessManager works perfeclty in python, this is not the point.

The point is: trying to instanciate  a  wmsprovider will issue a timeout when trying to request the capabilities: the code responsible for that creates its own QEventLoop and manage to do a blocking call (which is expected here). 
Please have a look at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/wms/qgswmscapabilities.cpp#L1964 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/wms/qgswmscapabilities.cpp#L1964>.  What we do not understand is why, despite the call of loop.exec() in the c++ code, the request is not processed (my example with the  Q(gs)etworkAccessManager
shows that it should processed)

Actually you cannot instanciate properly a QgsProject with a WMS layer.

To convince yourself, try to instanciate a QgsProject in python (in a standalone python script) from a .qgs project having a single wms layer: it will fail to instanciate the layer.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python question: QgsVectorLayer object has no
 attribute 'pendingFields'
Message-ID: <da390efd7a79ff362f7940ea4822d276@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am trying to fix some Python code that worked before, but not anymore
due to API changes in master meanwhile. 

I am getting a reference to a layer by name and then want to query the
'pendingFields'. Here is the code I use: 

--------------------- 

LayerParcels=
QgsProject.instance().layerStore().mapLayersByName('Parcels')[0] 

newParcel = QgsFeature() 

newParcel .setFields(LayerParcels.pendingFields()) 

------------------------- 

The first two lines seem to work, but the third line triggers an error: 

AttributeError: 'QgsVectorLayer' object has no attribute 'pendingFields'


Why is that? 

This code worked a few weeks before and the 'pendingFields' - according
to https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html still exists? 

What is wrong with my code? 

Thanks for any hints! 

Andreas

Hi Andreas, I believe you should just use  LayerParcels.fields()
pendingFields is gone.

pendingFields is gone this morning: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6050
Maybe just use `fields()` ?

Hi, 

oh - thanks, Etienne and Alessandro. If this change is that recent, than
it explains why the API doc and the API break document doesn't mention
it: https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html 

But - aren't we in hard freeze (no more API changes) now since a few
days already? 

Being confused ....

While I'm porting my plugin, I'm usually opening this doc
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/api_break.dox

Then I search for every new exception I have, I often find a solution there.

Here is a test script that illustrate the problem a bit further: if we run createProvider() twice, the first time 
the getCapbabilities will fail with a timeout. The second time, it will succeed. 

If you run this script, clear the Qgis network cache between two invocations. 

===================8<==============================
import os
import logging

from qgis.core import QgsApplication, QgsMessageLog
from qgis.core import QgsProject, QgsProviderRegistry

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# No Display
os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM'] = 'offscreen'

qgis_application = QgsApplication([], False )
qgis_application.setPrefixPath('/usr/local', True)
qgis_application.initQgis()

# Log any messages
def writelogmessage(message, tag, level):
    arg = '{}: {}'.format( tag, message )
    if level == QgsMessageLog.WARNING:
        logger.warning(arg)
    elif level == QgsMessageLog.CRITICAL:
        logger.error(arg)
    else:
        logger.info <http://logger.info/>(arg)

messageLog = QgsApplication.messageLog()
messageLog.messageReceived.connect( writelogmessage )

wmsuri = ("contextualWMSLegend=0&crs=EPSG:4326&dpiMode=7&featureCount=10&format=image/jpeg"
          "&layers=s2cloudless&styles&amp;tileMatrixSet=s2cloudless-wmsc-14"
          "&url=http://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms? <http://tiles.maps.eox.at/wms?>" )

# GetCapabilities Fail with Request Timeout !!!
provider = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().createProvider( "wms", wmsuri )

# Run again => works !!!
provider = QgsProviderRegistry.instance().createProvider( "wms", wmsuri )

qgis_application.exitQgis()
del qgis_application
====================8<=============================

We have also tested simple QgsNetwork invocation from c++: tests shows that event loops have the running status, but the 
request is not processed at the  first invocation.

Hi,

For reference, https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6050

As pointed out, Feature freeze != API freeze.

Many issues are still open here
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues

Best,

Denis

Hi Andreas,

Could you give an example of what it not translated to german?
Because according to transifex master is translated 100%.

Is it a self compiled QGIS and you did not pull the translations from
transifex in?
Is it an old master compilation with old translations?
Probably it is even a test-master without the newest translations pulled in.

I think Jürgen can tell when exactly the translations get pulled in for the
release.

regards
Werner

Hi Werner, 

Thanks for your reply. 

Yes, it is self-compiled. 

That would explain it. I wasn't aware that git pull of master repo does
not fetch current translations. How do I get them? Is there a docu
somewhere? 

Sorry for the fuss then ... so many things to learn!

Hi Andreas,

I am not sure if you first need to setup your .transifexrc but the script
to pull the translations is in

./scripts/pull_ts.sh

Usually - if everything is setup correctly you can just call the script
like above.

regards
Werner

Thanks Andreas for raising this problem.

Werner, I'd say it more clearly: since we started using Transifex, the 
translations are stuck there, and only rarely they land in qit. Last time it 
was in June 2016 in QGIS 2.16, so QGIS 2.18 and 3.0 still contain the 2.16 
translations.

I still don't understand why we keep the translations away from QGIS, but what 
about pulling them to master asap, so early testers have a chance to find 
mistakes? 

I believe it's not only Polish problem that Transifex introduced tons of 
embarrassing mistakes and disinformations. People are now translating without 
seeing the context, so the quality of translation in Transifex is ridiculous 
(subjects swapped with predicates and attributes - say 'layer style' with 
'style layer', a raster confused with a net etc). I guess we should give it as 
long testing period before the release as possible...

Regards,
Borys

Hi Sylvain,

Thank you for your tipps! I've added a PATH to the Environment. Had to
adjust for an OSGeo4W install:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/57ywuz4mt65gy1e/Screenshot%202018-01-15%2019.46.55.png?dl=0

Also, my eclipse.bat looks like this:

call "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\o4w_env.bat"
set
PATH=%PATH%;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-rel-dev;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-rel-dev\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\DLLs;C:\Program

Unfortunately, imports are still unresolved.

Hi Borys,
Not pushing the translations with every update to git has its purpose.
It is not necessary to blow up git because they can be pulled from
transifex at any time.

Regarding the quality you are maybe right - but in fact transifex gave us a
big boost in translations (because it is easy to handle) and a lot of new
people are now participating in the translation.

>From my point of view it is not necessary to store the translations in
git,but you are right that there should be a few releases with translations
before the final release, but IIRC the nightly releases are built with
freshly pulled translations.
But again this is a part to ask Jürgen which binary is with the most recent
translations.

regards
Werner

often repeats to people that requested same thing in the past (mostly in
qgis-community or qgis-translation list if i'm not wrong), translations are
pulled in QGIS at the time of release, not in github repo but directly in
the released version. So you should have updated translations, and that is
true in eg Windows version (either 2.18 and 2.99).
To be correct, remember that 2.18.0 had not been pulled to transifex
(because of multiple version at that time (2.16, 2.18, master)) and unless
polish community made an effort to translate through github/linguist... it
is normal to still have 2.16 translations.

I still don't understand why we keep the translations away from QGIS, but

I think there might be an issue only for self-compiled. And I agree that
having the translations pulled in "automatically" or with documented
commands to do it would be helpful. I just hit the same issue yesterday,
finding bits of English where it shouldn't be.

> Personally, I'm not sure I'd have come to QGIS contributions if it was
still using Linguist or any developer oriented tool. I joined QGIS
contributor as a translator because Transifex looked easy and user-friendly
and didn't need a particular client installation. I'm not sure GitHub is
easier despite recent discussion (and anyway it's not possible to translate
in its web interface) nor Qt Linguist attracts more people.

But I fully share your concerns about translations not being contextualized
and I'm not sure that all translators know how to translate (this is
particularly true with docs and sphinx stuffs) and what to care about when
translating. I'm afraid this undermines the quality of the application.
I don't know if moving back to a "more complicated" tool will help to
maintain same level of translations (for docs and application) but as a
first step we should make our translators aware of these issues (do not
translate when you don't know) and call for their vigilance?

Harrissou

hmm,
maybe we should clean out the i18n subtree on github so that it is more
obvious that you have to pull the translations..

Hi Anita,

after some headaches I managed to enable full code-completion in 
eclipse/pydev for pyqgis and PyQt5 for the current development version. 
I hope sharing my setup (similar to yours on OSGeo4W64) with you may help:

-) First I configured my PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH environment variables 
in the Windows configuration:

PYTHONHOME="C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\python.exe"
PYTHONPATH="C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGe‌​o4W64\apps\qgis\‌​bin;%Path%"

-) In the windows Path variable I entered following paths to all the libs:

C:\OSGeo4W64\bin
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\bin
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\bin
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\python
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\‌​qgis-dev\python\plug‌​ins
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\‌​qgis-dev\python\plug‌​ins\processing

With this system-side setup you can start eclipse even without .bat file 
and finish the configuration with the following steps:
-) Window>Preferences>Pydev>Interpreters>Python Interpreter
-) Add your Python interpreter at C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\python.exe
-) Configure the interpreters environment variables at the tab 
"Environment" and there again set (yet) another variable named PATH with 
the following values:

PATH="C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Qt5\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\python\plugins\processing"

-) Then enter two new "Forced Builtins" under the respective tab. Enter 
"qgis" and "PyQt5".
-) Finish by applying all your changes.

The code-completion should now work - maybe reload eclipse by using File 
 > Restart (sometimes simple closing doesn't help...).
I hope there are no typos in this guide, however I wish you good luck 
with the setup!

Regards,
Clemens

Werner, Harrissou, 

Thanks a lot for the clarification. Werner, I was bothering you about it so 
many times - why didn't you ever tell me how it works? :D Another funny thing 
is I never realized the nightly builds are translated - it seems I was so sure 
they aren't...

Just tested with nightly and weekly - it really works! Sorry for the buzz.

> hmm,
> maybe we should clean out the i18n subtree on github so that it is more
> obvious that you have to pull the translations..

It would cut the confusion and it would also supress git-status notifying 
about a modified file (either the .ts or .gitignore). As I understand, when a 
new release branch is created (2.16, 3.0, 3.2...; the 2.18 was exceptional), 
translations are pulled from Transifex anyway, so removing them from master 
will only simplify the situation, and won't cause any side effects.

Well, my personal feelings are completely opposite... I find Linguist a nice 
wysiwyg tool (with its GUI previews), while Transifex requires so much effort 
and skills to fix any single typo. First, its GUI is so unfriendly and slow 
that I'm forced to manually type URLs whenever possible, e.g. for searching. 
Second, if I want to translate anything, I have to copy the string origin to 
clipboard, open a file manager, find the source file, the line and finally 
guess its context. Of course most people don't do it, but it just moves the 
labour to a person who will fix their mistake.

It's just my 2 cents to express the Transifex superiority isn't unanimous - of 
course I've reconciled with the fact we need to live with it :)

Hi Anita,

My eclipse starter bat look like this:
----------
@echo off
set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W64
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\py3_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qt5_env.bat"

set
PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\python;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\python\plugins
set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH%

start "eclipse" C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe
-----------

And then I have added 'qgis' and 'PyQt5' to the Forced Builtins in eclipse
interpreter settings.
Of course if you are developing on 2.18 you need to remove from the bat
py3_env.bat and qt5_env.bat calls and add to the forcedbuiltins PyQt4
instead PyQt5

I have always used python.exe found
from C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\python.exe as a pydev interpreter. Don't
know if that matters.


Let's hope this helps!

I miss good old Qt Linguist. Well, maybe I don't. I miss the context that
it provided to translate string, but not how lonely it was because no one
was translating anything.

While I was reading this thread, I was wondering... For Docs and website we
have a very nice link at the bottom of the page that points us to the
translation strings of a current page (Thank Richard!) It would be great if
we could do the same for QGIS GUI (using a plugin for example). This would
help a lot to fix strange strings, and to review translated strings.

Denis,

Actually, all of the settings in the snapping config dialog are
project-specific and do not persist across projects. The application-wide
snapping settings are found in the options dialog (under the digitizing
tab).

That got my SAGA back in QGIS.  This should be clarified somewhere in the QGIS docs.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Downloading qgis_de.ts file
Message-ID: <489d1ea9-cb94-0c4d-aa66-11aaedb290b6@carto.net>

Hi devs,

Can someone provide me please access to a current qgis_de.ts file?

I tried to join QGIS Transifex, but miserably failed. First, it did not 
let me login with my github login (don't know why they offer this option 
then), then after creating a user it did not let me join the QGIS 
organization and apparently it does require me to have a login just for 
downloading a ts file - not so nice!

Also, it doesn't fit the "open" mentality of QGIS, if one has to first 
create a login just to download a file!è

I would really appreciate if someone could just send me a current 
version of the file or a download link to it.

Thanks a lot!

Andreas

Thanks for the thanks ;-)

But it is not so easy for GUI currently, because GUI is just one ts
file. I'm not sure if there is any order in that.

Besides there is not structure in it, or the html-anchors do not show
any grouping possibilities:

https://www.transifex.com/qgis/QGIS/translate/#nl/qgis-application/23587585

Is an id/anchor of a string.

For Desktop I like Linguist better too, but for docs and website I think
Transifex is easier (because you can click from context to translation).

Another reason to move to Transifex was that it was hard to do
translation in a group, as there is just 1 ts file. So doing some fast
group translations was impossible without clear coordination about WHO
was now translating.
If we could split up the ts file in more files ( I don't know, maybe
something along the line: gui/core/vector/raster/web, but preferably
some more ) it would be easier to let people fast start to translate a
language in a group (in  case of a new language for example) again using
Linguist if they prefer. If I am right, the coordinator can 'block' some
resource for offline translating?

Regards,

Richard

Hi Andreas,

you were not yet a 'member' of the translation team.

I just approved your request, so now you can see/translate/download if
you want.

Note that if you download / translate / upload again, that you overwrite
translations done in that time frame, unless there is some blocking
possibility. Which I can not find on this moment...

Richard Duivenvoorde

IMHO this is not true. Using Linguist together with git you get wonderful
hostory tracking and conflict resolution which is not possible at all with
transifex.  I'd say that this is transifex who can not be used without
huge coordination efforts. For example, if two persons translate same
string in transifex only last translation will be saved, while using Linguist
and Git you will get conflict and can choose more correct version.
Also it is not very easy to split stings in blocks for each translator as in
transifex we lost not only visual context but also logical contex, it is not
possible to see which string belongs to which class/widget. With Linguist
I can easily split text into blocks, e.g. by classes/widgest or in alphabetical
order.

Personally we, Ukrainian team, don't use transifex because of its terrible
interface, missed context and unability to work in group. Instead we use
own Git repo with ts file and Linguist for translations. Final file uploaded
to transifex time from time.

I don't think that agrument about transifex attracting more people can be
seriosly taken into account, as most of these new people just reguster, join
team and do nothing.

Just my 2c.

Hi,

Apparently someone accepted me joining the QGIS translation project - 
thanks!

Now the script to download the ts files works flawlessly.

Phew - did not expect it to be so complicated just to download a ts file!

Thanks to all who helped (esp. Werner) and for letting me join the 
transifex team!

Andreas

Hi David,

I verified this issue, I'm sorry but I don't have an explanation right away
and it looks like a bug, please file a ticket.

Hi Alessandro

This is a weird bug, I have also found that once the first request failed, others requests succeed wathever the url or the provider is (tried with wcs and wms).
When failing, looking on what append wms server  side when we found that no request is sent.

I fill a ticket on this.

I must agree with Alex - Transifex attracts people, but just to 
translate few random phrases or just to make an account. That's why I 
asked recently on [qgis-tr] about project policy on updating translators 
list.

We spend now more time correcting buggy translations made 
unintentionally due to lack of context in Transifex and/or due to 
autotranslations. But still have no idea how to find the best 
compromise, between attracting new people to the project and keeping 
translation quality at the same time.

I also tend to agree, based on IT translation history.
All the best.

According to http://www.redmine.org/issues/15520 Markdown formatting
support was added in Redmine, using a plugin:
https://github.com/alminium/redmine_redcarpet_formatter

Supposedly working since 2.4.2dev (what version are we running?)

BTW: we don't use the _wiki_ of redmine, do we ? Is it really
     just for ticket submisison and comments that you want
     Markdown ?

Yes just for submissions - wiki is not used. Since you are solving all problems here, the other nice thing to have would be the ability to drag and drop screenshots into the issue like you can on GH. Richard are you able to deploy that plugin?

I'm not so powerful to solve all problems, but it's surely something
that can be done as a community when the problems are with using
free software tools. Note the only use I have for Redmine is for
reviewing and submitting bugs to QGIS. Many other OSGeo projects
still use Trac (PostGIS and GEOS included) which as I'm findinig out
now have both Markdown *and* Drag&Drop plugins:

  https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MarkDown
  https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracDragDropPlugin

I know QGIS won't get from Redmine to Trac, but it's a pity for it
to be on a lonely infrastructure isn't it ? It's one of the reason
a few want to move to GitHub, right ? Because that's where people
are !

Hi,
I aim to release a QGIS3-version of my QGIS plugin "GPX Segment 
Importer". I would like to ask you if there exists a common approach for 
releasing versions for both QGIS2 and QGIS3? Should I create a new 
plugin for QGIS3 or can I somehow use the existing plugin for both?

The translations are pulled into the release branch in git on release (part of
scripts/release.pl).   And for each nightly of master the translations are
pulled into the source tree and build with it (running
scripts/pull_ts.sh - just like release.pl does).

So you'll find the current translations for the respective release branch and
it's the tar ball (which other packages should be based upon).

Interesting. I though this was just the Portuguese reality. I am the
coordinator of the PT_pt translation, and I usually accept everyone's
request, but I have no way of understanding how much each translator
contributes, or if it ever contributed anything. I would love to get some
statistics and be able to clean up that list a bit...

I know that using transifex it's possible to lock a string translation
marking it as reviewed. Maybe some experienced translators could use Qt
Linguist to review and then lock the translation on transifex. But
searching the strings threre takes ages...

now got it working.

Let's see how long it lasts :)

Hi Richard,

Thanks for approving the request. I can now download the ts files fine. 
Learning bit by bit about the QGIS infrastructure ;-)

I had no idea that Transifex is so restrictive with read-only access to 
ts_file - What is the reason for the secrecy? Why can't the ts_file be 
available for download without a registration and joining of a team? I 
assume this is a decision from Transifex and not from QGIS - right?

Thanks a lot to all who helped!

Andreas

IIRC we graduated from trac to Redmine….I don’t see any point in going back to Trac,

I think there are a bunch of reasons, the people being there is certainly one of them. Having less infrastructure to manage is another. Having tight integration with the source code another, easy commenting, quick and easy adding gifs and images, etc….but we have covered all this before in similar threads….

Thanks for looking into the markdown support!

Hi Simon,

We have used the approach of qgis2compat: we get our code running on 
QGis3 with new API calls, and use a small compatibility layer to get 
that same code running on QGis2. It is a bit of work, but seems to be 
working fine.

However the wiki 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3) now says 
that qgis2compat has been deprecated; I do not know if it is because 
that route is a dead-end, if other people are just making two different 
versions of the plugin.

Regards,

Javier

I both migrate plugin keeping qgis2 compatibility (
https://github.com/enricofer/attributepainter) or branching to qgis3 only (
https://github.com/enricofer/go2streetview)
Having to carry out 3 migrations in one: python2 to python3, QT4 to QT5,
PyQt2 to PyQt3,  in my experience I strongly suggest you to branch to Qgis3
only, leaving the qgis2 compatibility to simpler plugins.
You will get a more readable and efficient code, and you'll get the
opportunity to understand and exploit the api breaks benefits.

What does v.overlap actually do with 2 vector layers of areas?
How to make sure that attributes are in the output file?

There's a Redmine plugin which would let users login with their
GitHub account: https://github.com/gpstogis/redmine_oauth2_login

Given that the current https://hub.qgis.org site already allows
people to login via OpenID or via custom-registered accounts, it
could be not too different to _also_ allow login via GitHub ?

NOTE: an OSGeo UserID (single login) gives you access to many
      services, so for some people it is the GitHub account
      being the "additional" login to remember...

Hi all,

I'd like to move on a bit the discussion.

I'll try to summarize (and to be fair and honest):

* The desire to switch to Github is strong
1 against: Sandro
5 neutral (or did not pronounce): Jürgen, Andreas, Richard, Paolo, Nyall
9 for: Borys, Matthias, Tom, Jorge, Régis, Bernard (says Redmine sucks),
Loic, Tisharm and myself

* But among those who spoke. I was hoping for a broader response.

* I think we shouldn't mix switching to github (for technical reason) with
switching to gitlab or so (for ethical reason). My original call was mainly
for technical reasons and I believe, the end-users should decide on this.

* As stated, ethical reason should rely on the PSC. Feel free to call for
it.

* I believe that we should first decide on what to do and next find the
technical (and financial) solutions. And not the other way around.

* Jorge volunteered to work on the topic.

Additional **personal** notes:

* I would be against moving all issues to github. That doesn't mean losing
our history: let's just keep redmine online but locked. This has to be
discussed and decided after deciding to move to github.

* Another upcoming issue we HAVE to take care of: soon the PR number in GH
will catch up with the issue number in Redmine....so bugfix commits will
link to an unrelated PR... Keeping things untouched by fear of losing
history is a suicide!


Can we make a decision, and in this order:
1. decide to move (but to be applied if following questions are made
possible)
2. what/when to move (empty list or everything or open issues, before the
release, etc.)
3. how to move (volunteer, grant proposal, etc)

And if we realize the decision is not feasible: we start again the
procedure by stating we cannot do it.
It would be useless to spend hours on trying to migrate the issues if we
decide to start with an empty list -- just to illustrate.

What is next?
A loomio vote for this?

Cheers,

Denis

Another vote to move to git*, people may want to defend redmine, but it's
just not friendly for new users to come in and get engaged. And I realize
that QGIS may not want this, but I think it's a big user satisfaction win
if we could upvote issues-

Well - I did say that for me losing the ticket history in any form is
a blocker. But it's true - I'm neutral on this change. Personally
since the redmine upgrade I've no strong issues with it. (Reactivation
of the mantra would totally change this opinion though!!)

I cant speak for everyone, but I can guess that most people don't really care about Redmine specifically, they just care about the information it contains.

So I would suggest raising a vote on the motion:

“We should adopt GitHub issues for reporting issues in 3.0 and restrict Redmine for the management of issues in QGIS 2.x”.

After there are no more active 2.x releases, we make the Redmine tracker read only and keep it around as an archive. We could put into the GitHub issue template: “Only use this tracker for 3.x related issues” and similar message on Redmine indicating that it should only be used for 2.x issues. It will unfortunately leave us in the position where you need to check to issue trackers for your issue which is going to suck a bit.

Tim

I'm a bit unclear where 2.18 fits in - would Redmine be open for new
2.18 bugs? Or would they be reported on github?

I just didn't have anything new to add.  Everything has been broadly discussed
already and led to the decision to stay with redmine.

Huh?  Tickets and PRs are just different things and that we aren't free to fix
that (eg. by using different notation for issues and PRs or by renumbering
tickets & PRs) is a argument against github to me.  But I think that's nothing
new either.

to clarify:
* I'm not neutral: I'm in favour of any system user find useful,
*provided* we don't miss the history; this is a blocker for me
* I would prefer a 100% free solution, and to to get stuck with a
proprietary one; this is not a blocker for me, but I wuold advise having
a reasonably way out, to avoid being locked in; this is a strategic, not
an ethical reason
* I'm not 100% sure "normal" people will find GH much easier than
redmine. we obviously have a bieased, non representative opinion on
this; perhaps better asking among regular user; I'm doing this in
qgis-it, I suggest to do the same for other QUGs
* I find interesting the idea of leaving Redmine for the 2 series, and
starting afresh with GH for 3; however, I'm really worried that this
will cause a lot of entropy, with users being confused on what to do,
duplicated tickets in both systems, etc.; e.g. an old ticket, from 2, is
fixed in 3, but not 2: should we leave it open in Redmine? I can see a
number of such puzzling cases.
All the best.

Note that the mantra is currentcly active.

Incidentally, many recent people asking for a mantra are coming
to upload plugins to the official QGIS plugin repository.
That's another service authenticated trough the OSGeo UserID so switching

Hi all,

Tim's proposal seems a interesting compromise.

We keeping the redmine active to support 2.x version and we start a new
development workflow for 3.x. based on git[hub|lab].
As Paolo, Nyall and other pointed out, we will have some noise regarding
duplication of issues, out of sync issues (closed for 3.x but not for
2.x), etc, but after a while, issues will became much more integrated
and traceable on top of a git based platform. We must remember that
redmine issues are working well because there are developers taking care
of the issues, tagging, etc. There is a lot of human effort on top of
redmine issues.

Another nice thing in Tim's proposal is to avoid (more than one)
disruptive changes. I would prefer to move to gitlab. But to keep the
process less disruptive, we can continue in github for now. Regarding
Paolo concern about lock in, we can switch from github to gitlab more
easily if necessary.

After this discussion about the development workflow, I would prefer to
start another "disruptive" change and move from Transifex to Weblate.
End users are blaming about translations. Free version of Transifex does
not allow translators to use more sophisticated tools to support the
process, as Alexandre and others said recently. That's a major issue
bothering both end users and translators we need to solve.

As Heraclitus said (a former developer from Ancient Greece Inc.) "The
Only Thing That Is Constant Is Change". That’s what we have in QGIS :-)

See you all in Madeira, within a month!

It will unfortunately leave us in the position where you need to check to issue trackers for your issue which is going to suck a bit.

As OSGeo system administrators we were considering adding a Weblate
instance on translate.osgeo.org, would you be interested in that or
do you want to go your own route for that ?

Hello,

I would like to publicly thanks Paul for his work on the documentation
ofauxiliary storage [1]. This is the second time that Paul wrote a PR
for documentation linked to a feature he added in QGIS. This really
helps much the documentation quality.

I will be really happy if this could occur more often. I know that
developer don't like writing documentation, but I am quiet sure that
writing documentation is as important as writing unit test! Who is the
most skilled to write documentation on a feature that the developer :)

May be a new concept should be created after the DevOps concept, the
DevDoc! If in the future we could take in account in our commercial
offers and in QEP about writing documentation, it will be a great help
to improve and speed up the documentation.

Thank you, also, Harrissou to take time to make the review!

Happy new year all!

Y.

My bad ...

Actually I was not using the output.getVectorWriter object the correct way.
After fixing it the layer extracting from postgis by uri resulted in the
default layer style from postgis to be add automatically using the
getVectorWriter of the processing.core.outputs.OutputVector object.

If would still be smart if one could have an after processAlgorithm signal
for setting other stuff like adding feature count in TOC.

Hi Sandro,

I would prefer to use translate.osgeo.org. The first advantage would be
the authentication support and the unified OSGeo user profile.
Translators working on QGIS and other OSGeo projects would love to stay
on the same platform.

Our translation requirements are similar to other OSGeo projects. We
would benefit from improvements in the platform supported any OSGeo project.

It would be amazing if we could share things among OSGeo projects. We
could dream with common resources, like glossaries, for example.

If you have any news about this, let us know. It would be nice to make a
testing platform available to reviews for example before deciding to
move to Weblate.

Regards,

Much appreciated, thanks to all involved.
I agree that including doc writing into commercial offers is the best
way to go in the future.
All the best.

What a brilliant idea. Do we work with gvSIG to share translation resource?
There must be considerable overlap.

Hello,

A bit late to the party, and I think for such an important matter it is
good to wait a bit to hear more voices.

I have mixed feelings about switching to a new issue manager without the
history for QGIS3, and will not argue here for a specific roadmap.


But I think the GitHub vs GitLab debate in case of switching is still open.

I would rather tend to go to GitLab for the following reasons :
- interface quite similar to GitHub
- login on GitLab.com is possible with a GitHub account
- (personal opinion) much more pleasant to use than GitHub
- Full OpenSource Community edition ( no vendor lock-in)
- Faster development than GitHub
- Much better CI management

Concerning last point, we are currently working at Oslandia on GitLab CI
for QGIS on Windows, and generally for OSGeo4W packages, in order to be
able to deliver better packages for QGIS and related softwares.

There is still a lot to do, but we see GitLab as being much more
powerful than GitHub in this area, and it would be much easier to
publish our CI work for the community if QGIS were hosted on GitLab.

Regards,

Vincent

For sure there is a huge overlap with GRASS project. We use many phrases 
from GRASS project.
Big +1 for this idea.

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6n4G0dXhTReFsLe0E4fjT1wY-_kJx5N+=2yYiQJt3e5w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

I am looking at Processing for QGIS3, and would like to share some bugs I
discovered while playing with models. I have not found related issues in
the hub. I will add them after some feedback. Please point me the the
issues if they do exists in Redmine

* Number input is not proposed in algorithms. For example, after adding an
input of type Number, you cannot anymore use this input as a value for the
buffer size in the QGIS fixed buffer alg : no combobox is shown to the
user, just a standard text input.

* Grid alg : the user can choose the extent of one of the vector layers (
inputs or results of alg), bug when you run the model, the extent is empty
and the grid alg failed.

Regards,
Michaël

Hi,

my 2cts (and I have a partial view of what is discussed here)

Who actually are the target of this desire of move: developers (who are
missing ability to do some magics in the backend) or issue reporters (who
would find Redmine difficult and Github better/easier)?

As an issue reporter I agree that Redmine may not obvious at the beginning
(i've been lost many times), not sexy and missed the ability to ping
people. Now that i'm used to it and given the latest changes, it does what
I need to do (and I agree that my needs may be lower than developers').
Apart from Github design being more appealing, and once again regarding
what I do with it, i fail to see what it offers more than Redmine (from an
issue report management perspective of course). I even wonder if it's
possible in github (fail to find such a repo) for the reporter to label/tag
the issue he is reporting or will we deploy a team to do things the
reporter currently does himself in Redmine (set category, release...). so I
personally have no problem to stay there.
What I however really find not obvious is to have two different platforms
to report bugs (application vs website/docs).

>From a developer's perspective, I do not feel comfortable to express an
opinion.

I also think that if we have to move, it should not be only for technical
reason; as some have already pointed out, there might be strategy but also
ethics. If there are tools fully open source that do the job (and used by
OSGeo members), we should really consider moving to them (and contribute to
improve them) rather than staying (only) on a proprietary tool (even though
there are tools to migrate). Better do the move once than twice (do not
forget that we would surely lose contributors in the move).

About Loomio votes, while some voters express their own convictions, I'd
like to remind that half of the voting members are representing their
national user group (whose members do not all/always follow this thread)
and from what I understand (but maybe I misunderstand this role) they are
their voice. So before any vote is proposed, it'd be nice to know what
would be the question(s) to vote on and give time to those voting members
to get some feedback from "their community". Thanks.

Regards,
Harrissou

I also have mixed feelings about the two options given (stay on redmine and
switch to github), I see pros and cons in both options.

What I'd probably miss in github are categories (tags are not categories)
and the stored queries (like, "Regressions + Master + HighPriority +
Server").

I might be wrong and perhaps github also offers the a.m. features.

>From the ethical point of view, I like the proposal by Vicent in this email
because of the open source nature of gitlab and vendor lock-in parachute.

Additionally, if we have to make a switch it would be probably better to
explore if gitlab offers CI technical advantages over gihub+travis that has
proven to be the most unreliable piece of our development stack (random
failures for unknown reasons).

That said, if we need to choose between staying on redmine and moving to
github, I would be (very) slightly in favour of moving to github, mainly
because of the advantages of a better integration with PRs and code
comments, but the best move IMO would be to explore if gitlab is viable and
better option and perhaps wait a bit and eventually move to gitlab, the
reason is that if we move to github now, we won't be able to move to
another platform in a reasonable amount of time.

I'd count the bug reporters *and* the bug queue maintainers - so in fact 
Giovanni, who does enormous work keeping an eye and clearing the bug queue 
constantly... and nobody asked him for his opinion :p

My preference for Github is mainly for three reasons:
 - Redmine doesn't look inviting and may scary potential reporters
 - Many power users I know (and all devs of course, but it's not a point) 
already have a github account and are familiar with filling issues. 
 - Would be nice to have the bug tracker integrated with the code repository, 
and in general: more consistent enviroment.

Good point. I was just about to write that before making any voting, we should 
test it and present an example how it's going to work (creating issues, 
assigning category tags, filtering...). Your example shows it's necessary.

Another thing: I believe the migration effort must be paid - no one will find 
this work sexy enough to do it in her/his spare time.

> Better do the move once than twice (do not

This is something I realized during this discussion. If we'll move to Gitlab 
in reasonable future, than we'll have two migrations in a row, what obviously 
not our goal. So maybe... (I'm really sorry to raise this question right now) 
shouldn't we decide it prior to further discussion about Github? Like that:

Do we move to another repo with QGIS 4 release (or earlier)?
 |
 +--	Yes: stay with Redmine for now, but be prepared for the migrations.
 +--	No: continue the Github migration discussion.

Borys

Hi all,
I've asked the Italian community, and surprisingly most bug reporters
find Redmine easier that GitHub.
No idea whether this is a generalized opinion, but IMHO we should hear
bug reporters at first place.
I agree with Borys that the opinion of bug managers counts a lot as well.
All the best.

(about GH) IMHO tech decision and user experience are nothing that can
be fixed for more than 3y => I shouldn't decide focusing on user
experience (now oauth login is widely supported), but basing on:

1) FOSS tool
2) opt-out ability

I should be for a -1, but I prefer for an honest 0, because I can't work on it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to load WMS/WFS/WMTS capabilities in PyQGIS ?
Message-ID: <CAPS5vm2apYnQjY1ZdoY8sLK5CsNMiOMv1ABy4eB0VQ1J+ErFhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to load services capabilities (layers, SRCs, styles...)
using PyQGIS ?

Until now I'm using OWSLib because I knew the lib and it's included in
QGIS, but I'm looking for a proper way and I can't find it. I would expect
a behavior similar to the UI widget:

wms = provider.provider("wms",  "
https://geobretagne.fr/geoserver/lorientagglo/wms?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS
")
wms.subLayers()
> [layer1, layer2...]
wms_lyr = wms.getLayer("layer1")
lyr = QgsRasterLayer(wms_lyr.uri(), "wms_lyr.title", "wms")
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(lyr)

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Does QGIS 3.0 have a search capability across all
	layers and all fields
Message-ID: <CABPxTTo3s6WD0QC38oHS6FtAFiS_i2GAoOFs1U6kTh56iD7pzQ@mail.gmail.com>

When I created my "Search Layers" plugin that does a textual search across
all vector layers and all fields, I was led to believe that this capability
would be in QGIS 3.0 and so "Search Layers" was only important for 2.x. The
only problem is that I cannot seem to find this type of capability. 3.0
certainly has powerful selection capabilities on a single layer, but I
can't find a function that works across all vector layers.

Is the capability there and I am just missing it? If so then it should be
easier to find and if not then I will convert "Search Layers" for QGIS 3.0.

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi C,

Is the 'locate'-field in the lower left corner not almost what you need?
The so called Locator interface.

It is at least possible to go through all fields/values for current
layer, using 'f'.
So loaded a world layer, you can search for The Netherlands by start to
type: "f net"

This interface is also relative easy to implement, see my experimental
setup for a Geocoder for Nomatim/OSM and a national Geocoder:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/pdoklocatorplugin

So I think(!) that it would be easy to go all layers to search?

Richard Duivenvoorde

I'm sorry to push this post again, but this could be quite a blocker
for the use in Europe (especially in Germany).

Clearly, a workaround is to inform and sensitize people that a library
misinterprets the projection and passes it on to QGIS in the wrong way.
But this will not reach all affected users.

Could someone perhaps tell me who is responsible for the database of
projections or at least give me an impetus on how to do it myself?
I will then gladly make a patch out of it.

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi Tobias,

(others please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not authorative on this!),

I found a script which to me looks like it creates the

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/scripts/qgis_srs.sh

which can apparently create qgis.db or src.db:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/scripts/qgis_srs.sh#L266

--qgis Create a database to be used as the 'qgis.db' upgraded replacement.
--srs  Create a database to be used as the 'srs.db' upgraded replacement.

I am not sure if this is used nowadays. But IF it is, it would be good
if we could document the whole chain of tools and descisions which have
been taken to give QGIS it's crs's...

In the default profile:

.share/local/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default there is a qgis.db sqlite
database which has a table tbl_src and a view vw_srs

and references to both of these in the code:

I just tried and the EPSG is only written to the qpj, but not to the prj.
That's why we write .qpj, because otherwise we may run into the same problem
even within QGIS.  GDAL doesn't write the full WKT into the prj - it "morphs to
ESRI" for compatibility reason.  The qpj carries it.

If there is no qpj, we rely on GDAL to detect the correct CRS from the prj,
which can have issues with some prjs (if there is a qpj too - but we feed it
the full WKT from the qpj).

GDAL does detect the correct EPSG from prj it wrote itself. Apparently from the
different name of the projection, because the rest of the prj is the same.
There is no information about the different axis order in the prj (ie. the only
actual difference between EPSG:3044 and EPSG:25832).

I guess you see the problem with prj from third parties that use different
projection names.  And hence there may be no clue left in the prj that could
help with identifying whether it's EPSG:3044 or EPSG:25832.  How do your .prj
actually look like?

Unfortunately not.

6759|1633

1633/6759 crs have duplicates.

sqlite> select count(*),parameters from tbl_srs group by parameters having count(*)>1 order by count(*) desc limit 10;
138|+proj=geocent +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs
62|+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +no_defs
51|+proj=longlat +ellps=intl +no_defs
36|+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs
25|+proj=geocent +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs

9|+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +vunits=m +no_defs

So some even have 138 duplicates.

sqlite> select srid,description from tbl_srs where parameters='+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs';

25832|ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N
6707|RDN2008 / UTM zone 32N (N-E)
7791|RDN2008 / UTM zone 32N

The parameters of EPSG:25832 exists 4 times.

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4345 looks relevant.  With GDAL trunk
gdalsrsinfo -e on a EPSG:25832/3044 prj with the projection name changed to
unknown finds EPSG:25832 and EPSG:3044 with a confidence of each 90%.

I guess we better let the user decide with CRS to use, when we don't find an
accurate match.  Even if there wouldn't be so many duplicates, the frequency of
use may be different for different areas of application and any automatism might
still fail and appear as a bug.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pyqgis zoom using list widget
Message-ID: <1516563867634-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

hello i have create a layer filter Expression to get specific results query
from my layer and i add this results in list widget using pyqt.

my Expression and my add to list widget work fine(i take correct ids numbers
in the print and i see that ids in list widget).

but if i want to zoom feature using double click signal in list widget then
i take zoom
in the wrong features(features where my Expression is False).Any idea where
i have wrong in my code and to take wrong features zoom?


my code :

__init__
self.connect(self.ui.listWidget, SIGNAL("itemDoubleClicked (QListWidgetItem
*)"), self.Zoomt)


my filter :
	     def myfilter(self):
		layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName("mylayrt")[0]
		request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression('"name" =
\'{0}\''.format(myname))
			 for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
				print str(feature.attribute("myid"))
				self.ui.listWidget.addItem(str(feature.attribute("myid")))


result print :

1
42
43
44
45
96
111
304
458
508
579
602
606
646


that is ids add correct in list widget (14 ids).


zoom button .

	def Zoomt(self):
		Vl_Gs = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName("mylayer")[0]
		Vl_Gs.removeSelection
		Vl_Gs.setSelectedFeatures([self.ui.listWidget.currentRow()])
		self.mapCanvas.zoomToSelected(Vl_Gs)

zoom ids (take first 14 from my layer)  :

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14

is len number is correct but the ids zoom is wrong,why?

Hi all,
I have a large shp with a number of repeated strings, and I'd like to
refactor it replacing strings with a numeric code. I have found a
Processing alg that does it, creating a new file each time, which is
cumbersome; moreover, the alg apparently changes field type, adding
decimals to reals. Of course I could create a CASE statement, but this
is also cumbersome.
Is there a more straightforward way?
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

A possible insight can be this:
- Create a table with two columns:  'string from SHP' and 'respective
number code'.
- In SHP create the Union with the table above.
- Use Calculator for populate the new field in SHP with value of code.

Good lucky.

Hi, maybe the field refactor alg' with a "replace()" mixed with a
attribute(get_feature , etc...) looking in the reclassification table could
do?
Cheers

sure, thanks Régis and Luiz. Both approaches however are still
cumbersome; I guess this could evolve in a feature request, probably
extending the exixting `Add unique value index field` alg.
All the best.

Any error message?

Yes it should be possible but you need two different starter bat files and
you can't use those at the same time.

When working with QGIS 2.18 plugins my starter bat look like this:
--- qgis2-eclipse.bat
@echo off
set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W64
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"

set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\
python;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\python\plugins
set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\bin;%PATH%

start "eclipse" C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe
-----------

And for QGIS3 plugins:
--- qgis3-eclipse.bat
@echo off
set OSGEO4W_ROOT=C:\OSGeo4W64
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\o4w_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\py3_env.bat"
call "%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\bin\qt5_env.bat"

set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\
python;%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\python\plugins;C:\
Users\lauri\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins
set PATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis-dev\bin;%PATH%

start "eclipse" C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe
----------

When adding the interpreters. Try to add the same version python
interpreter that was defined in the starter bat that was used to start
eclipse.
Your python 3 interpreter error message looks like that you tried to add it
when python 2.7 environment was active.



I don't know if it makes any difference but I always have used a bare
Eclipse Platform Runtime Binary (that is without any plugins or development
tools) and then added just Pydev. You also need to install JRE separately.

Two ideas (both based on master, because qgis 2.18 is painful to use now!):

Option 1:
Run the "Add unique value field index" algorithm to add an
autogenerated code for each unique category. Then, run the "List
unique values" algorithm selecting both the original field and the
newly created field for the "target fields" in order to get a summary
table mapping the new categories to their original values (or wait
until https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6132 is merged, which adds
creation of this summary table as an option to the alg... then you can
do this with a single algorithm execution)

Option 2:
Run the "List unique values" algorithm on your table, selecting the
field to reclass as the "target field". In the returned table (which
contains all the unique categories), add a new field for your
reclassed codes, and populate this in some way that makes sense for
you (e.g. manually, or via field calculator, etc). Then, run the "join
attributes table" algorithm and join your original table to the class
table, joining by your original field value and adding the new code
field as the "layer 2 field to copy".

It is - I actually originally wrote the feature search this way, but
decided in practice that it wasn't a good idea so in the end
restricted it to just the active layer.

Issues I had were:
- good results tended to be flooded out with results from unwanted tables
- a single slow table source can hold up the results from wanted tables

The interface here isn't fantastic - but you need to hit the '...'
button to the right of the numeric parameter and then you'll see the
input exposed as a variable for use.

We need https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/84
in order to improve this.

​Thank you for the pointer Nyall. That's certainly a start but as you
mention correctly, it still seems incomplete. For example, it currently
doesn't help me figure out how to fix

This script has a syntax errors. Problem with line: ##output=output vector

There is a line in the PR about vector outputs but ​it's a bit cryptic:

- OutputVector ->
- processAlgorithm has a new signature....
Use parameterAsSink instead of getOutputFromName

​Regards,
Anita

There's also https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/scripts/Keep_n_biggest_parts.py
, although I'd ideally like to port this script to a proper algorithm
before release.

Hi Nyall,
scripts seem way more complex then before. I guess it is the simplest way
that could be found to accomodate Processing scripts to the refactored code.
Some questions from the previous scripts examples:

1) Is automatic output / sink parameter conversion impossible to obtain? In
[1] self.parameterAsSink is used, and it's not very clear to me what the
second method output (Biggest_parts) represent. Input / source (Polygons)
is used directly instead, as it was in QGIS 2.x

2) There are some global vars that appear to be automagically injected by
the script execution context, like "parameters" and "context". Are they
documented somewhere?

3) The test scripts use different approaches. Centroids.py use source /
sink, while the others two define vector / vectorDestination. Are they
supposed to work?

Thanks!
Giovanni

Message-ID: <CAJy=Xtf0GUDHCedD_0NSGN2Oe5YzH7CTdMfg8B+MVrbkNj-EBA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to programmatically set a QgsLayoutPicture content in QGIS3.0:

1) I create a new print composition and I name it 'test'
2) I create a picture frame in the composition and I call it 'picture'
3) I run the following code:

from qgis.core import QgsProject
myLayout = QgsProject.instance().layoutManager().layoutByName('test')
myLayoutPicture = myLayout.itemById("picture")
myLayoutPicture.setPicturePath("path to an image")

and I get the following Exception:
AttributeError: 'QgsLayoutItem' object has no attribute 'setPicturePath'

If I inspect myLayoutPicture object I found it is a
qgis._core.QgsLayoutItem not a QgsLayoutPicture

Is this a correct behaviour or is it an issue? How can I get the right
Layout object?

Regards.

Yes, it is the correct behavior, the method returns  a pointer to the base
class which is QgsLayoutItem.

In the C++ API there is a template method to retrieve all objects of a
certain type but it's not exposed to Python (that's not even possible with
current SIP I think):

template<class T> void layoutItems( QList<T *> &itemList ) const SIP_SKIP

Sorry but I don't have an answer to your last question.

Which QGIS revision do you use? I can not reproduce your issue on master,
all works as expected.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing CRS Warnings useless?
Message-ID: <0a092323-49c7-4572-31e8-90caf9f9f791@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

testing the new release I notice that in the Processing options there
are still the 2 options to warn the user if the CRS among layers don't
match.

Processing is correctly not warning me with 2 layers with different CRS
during a normal difference and intersection operation.

Isn't it useless to have this option with the new auto-reprojecting system?

Thanks!

Cheers

Matteo

Dear all,

I am experiencing a very painful issue I wasn't able to fix up to now.

I cannot use the vector layer properties as it freezes the application when
exiting the dialog, either by apply or cancel.
It does not affect the raster layer dialog.
I am on mac, but the original reporter is on linux.

Is anyone else experiencing it?

great, thanks for the improvement! this solves things brilliantly.
what would be great is the possibility of doing the same thing for more
than a column in the same execution. it is cumbersome to do it over and
over for a large table.
one further improvement would be to automatically add in the layer
property style the summary table as Value map.
should I open feature reqs for this?
All the best, and thanks again.

How would you see this working within processing? I guess you could
select all the desired columns, and then an auto-generated field name
could be made for each new field based on the original column. It's
probably best left to a separate algorithm though.

> one further improvement would be to automatically add in the layer

Good idea. This relates to a request on this list a week or so ago,
where someone wanted an algorithm to be able to specifically set the
style of generated layers. There's currently no support for this in
processing algorithms, but there's no reason (well... apart from
time/cost) we can't add it in for >= 3.2.

Yes

this is the way GRASS has worked from years; very practical, I miss that
in QGIS.

That's because well behaved algorithms now handle this automatically
for users... helping them not want to smash their screens.

Well, algorithms which CAN'T transparently reproject (for whatever
reasons) can return the QgsProcessingAlgorithm.FlagRequiresMatchingCrs
flag. If this is encountered then the CRS warning will be still shown.

This became an issue after a certain sip version. It affects QGIS 2.x
also, and seems to be caused by sip being unable to automatically cast
classes which use multiple inheritance (like QgsComposerItem,
QgsLayoutItem). The consequence is that Python is only aware of the
base class, not the actual item subclass.

I can't find anyway to fix this properly. So I hack around by forcing
sip to manually cast to the correct item type, e.g. by inserting two
lines* which look like this:

        # screw you sip, I'll just manually cast
        real_item = sip.cast(item, QgsLayoutItemPicture)

It's not pretty, but it works...

ok, I didn't know that there could still be chances to face misleading
CRS, now all make sense!

Is-it possible to remove this function from SIP bindings? According to SIP
version?

It's a common issue, already raised on the mailing list and in plugin issue
trackers.

I'm copy/pasting another message/snippet from Martin which works perfectly:

Not sure if that is related, was just looking into code of a plugin we
use with QGIS 2.18 and there for getting composer items we have this
helper method:

    @staticmethod
    def get_composition_item(comp, item_id, item_class):
        for item in comp.items():
            if isinstance(item, item_class):
                if item.id() == item_id:
                    return item

And you would call it e.g.:
ver_label = self.get_composition_item(self.oview_compn, 'version',
QgsComposerLabel)

Not sure if that is to work around the same problem as you have - I
didn't write that code. And to get composer map items, we use
composition.getComposerMapById(id)

I'm testing the code under QGIS3, but I fear that
isinstance(item, item_class), in my case: isinstance(item,
QgsLayoutItemPicture)
returns always false because item is of QgsLayoutItem generic class

Nyall's workaround works for me without exceptions:

from qgis.core import QgsProject, QgsLayoutItemPicture
import sip
myLayout = QgsProject.instance().layoutManager().layoutByName('test')
myLayoutPicture =
sip.cast(myLayout.itemById("picture"),QgsLayoutItemPicture)
myLayoutPicture.setPicturePath("path to an image")

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Not able to build QGIS with 3D on Ubuntu 16.04
Message-ID: <98a2adf1-7bf2-f55f-e8f4-952140aa948c@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to build QGIS with 3D support on a Mint 18 (so Ubuntu 16.04)
machine, but, even if I've followed exactly Martin's guide [0] I'm
facing many errors.

I successfully compiled in /opt all the required Qt libraries, the
problems arise when setting up ccmake and cmake

* mkdir build-3d-qgis
* ccmake ../QGIS
* then just configuring as usual without touching anything

* when setting up the cmake options as written in the guide

 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/qt59/lib/cmake cmake ../QGIS \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/apps \
   -DWITH_3D=TRUE \
   -DWITH_QTWEBKIT=FALSE \
   -DENABLE_TESTS=FALSE \
   -DWITH_QWTPOLAR=FALSE \
   -DWITH_BINDINGS=FALSE \
   -DQWT_LIBRARY=/opt/qt59_libs/qwt-6.1.3/lib/libqwt.so \
   -DQWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/qt59_libs/qwt-6.1.3/include \
   -DQSCINTILLA_LIBRARY=/opt/qt59/lib/libqscintilla2_qt5.so \
   -DQSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/qt59/include


cmake tells me:

-- Found Qt version: 5.5.1


so it does not find the correct Qt version and then a lot of warnings, like:


Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target qgis_gui because
  files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libQt5Xml.so.5] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be
hidden by files in:
      /opt/qt59/lib

.... and many many others ....


I tried to compile anyway, but of course at around 40% I get an error
and the compilation stops..


Are there some Ubuntu 16.04 users that have successfully compiled QGIS
that can give some hints? It would be awesome to test the 3D framework..


Thanks for any suggestion

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geometry operations in Python
Message-ID: <CAGZtxQxR6pq=vKExVpoucSYOHSab4JkRGaysoQ8HQ_LuAAGp+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm updating my plugin to QGIS 3.

It sometimes needs to reverse line directions. I used to do it like this:

return QgsGeometry.fromPolyline(geom.asPolyline().reverse())

Q1. Do I understand it correctly, that fromPolyline returns a
QgsPointXY list, thus destroying any M/Z values?

What I do now, and what seems to work, is this:

return QgsGeometry(geom.constGet().reversed())

Q2. Is this the preferred way?
Q3. Is it better to use constGet() or normal get()?

The second issue are multi-part geometries. I have tried something
like this, after selecting a simple line in a .shp layer:

>> qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry().constGet().wkbType()
5 (note: multipart line. I don't understand why, but ok)
>> qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry().constGet().numGeometries()
0
>> qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry().constGet().geometryN(0)
<crashes QGIS entirely>

So apparently this doesn't work. So now I use an approach like this:

list = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry().asGeometryCollection()
mls = QgsMultiLineString()
for line in list:
   mls.addGeometry(line.constGet().reversed())
newgeom = QgsGeometry(mls)

Q4. Is this the recommended way of doing things?

Can someone shed a light on this?

Kind regards,
Daan

I merged it, but why does Luigi not have merge privileges ?
What's the procedure to candidate him to have them, if it's not
just a technical issue ?

Hi Ginetto,

that is exactly the guide I've tried to followed that gives me the
errors listed before..

Hi,

I think you need to reference CMake modules path from your QT installation,
e.g. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/5.9.2/gcc_64/lib/cmake or similar.

Cheers,
Peter

Hello,

I just noticed that this issue apparently also surfaces when opening
projects from QGIS 2.18 in QGIS 3.0

E.g. a project with the CRS set to 25833 (ETRS89/UTM zone 33N) in 2.18
will open with CRS 3006 (SWEREF99 TM) in the current QGIS 3.0.

Kind regards,

Daan

Isn't

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/qt59/lib/cmake cmake ../QGIS \
etc.......

doing exactly this thing?

Hi Matteo,

if you have your Qt installation in /opt/qt59, it does. But I have it in
/opt/Qt/5.9.2/gcc_64/lib/cmake. I depends on how/where you installed Qt.

Cheers,
P.

Hey Pete,

I followed exactly what Martin wrote. So it should be installed in
/opt/... or not?

That a project is also affected is unexpected.  Sample data?

Hi guys,

sorry to insist on this topic but I did not find a solution. With a
custom rater loaded, when hitting on the buttons User Defined,
Cumulative, Min/Max, Mean +- sd to calculate the minimum and maximum
values nothing changes.

Is there a hidden button to look for or the values should change
automatically?

Thanks for any hint

Cheers

Matteo

This is strange, now both Apply and Ok button should to update the min/max
values. At current master works for me.
(Although, I'd like see the values being updated automatically.)

Ciao.

I missed that commit ;)

ok some other tests with the same layer:

* pseudocolor works as you said
* singleband grey not working with OK and Apply button

the same result (pseudocolor working greyscale not) happens with bot
Layer properties dialog and Style Panel

> (Although, I'd like see the values being updated automatically.)

Actually with the Layer Panel and pseudocolor, when hitting on the
different calculation type values are automatically updated in the boxes ;)

Should I open a ticket for the greyscale?

Thanks for the feedback

Cheers

Matteo

That's a different case - apparently introduces with the fix for #17257.
It's misdetecting the project CRS.    Should be fixed in 8c96eec2.

Thanks Jürgen! The new unit test is appreciated too... this logic is
getting very tricky to balance.

Unfortunately I don't think this would help - we'd have to remove
every method which returns a QgsLayoutItem to do so - and there's some
things in API which are only possible with these methods. It's also
proven to be an issue even in the most recent Qt and SIP versions, so
we'd have to just remove these methods from the bindings full stop.
There's also underlying Qt base classes which returns these items
which we can't control (eg QGraphicsScene::items() ).

I think the real solution is to get it fixed upstream.

I don't see how this helps though - unless some magic in the
isinstance call forces sip to correctly cast the item type? Martin?

That's gone in 3.0 ;) Map ids where old and crufty, and now everything
is done with the uuids. But unfortunately the methods for retrieving
items by uuid all return a QgsLayoutItem pointer, so will suffer the
same sip casting bug.

It's bad all round. That's why I think we need to try as hard as
possible to get this resolved upstream so we can do away with all the
hacks.

Yes. Avoid these as much as possible. asPolyline() is also quite slow,
so that's another good reason to avoid it.

Yes. It's very fast, will work for Circular Strings and Compound
Curves, and will maintain Z/M values.

> Q3. Is it better to use constGet() or normal get()?

Use constGet() wherever possible (i.e. you're not modifying the
returned value). The rationale here is:

- QgsGeometry objects are implicitly shared, so copying them is very
fast and performs only a shallow copy.
- Calling constGet() on a QgsGeometry returns the underlying geometry
primitive without forcing a slow "detach" (deep copy) of the geometry.
So use that if you can.
- Call get() only when you need to modify the geometry primitive, e.g.
geometry.get().transform( my_coord_transform ). It'll force the deep
copy, but you'll need to do this anyway since you're modifying the
copy.

It's probably a MultiLineString layer type.

I *think* you're unlucky here and that the feature's geometry is a
multi line string consisting of 0 parts. That's why numGeometries()
returns 0, and geometryN( 0 ) tries to access an out-of-range object
and crashes (which we should fix and throw a Python exception
instead).

Try calling .asWkt() on your geometry to see what it actually is.

Yes  - looks good to me. asGeometryCollection() is nice and efficient,
and won't lose curves or Z/M types. I'm not sure if it's any quicker
or any more readable, but a slightly different approach would be:

list = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry().asGeometryCollection()
reversed_lines = []
for line in list:
   reversed_lines .append(QgsGeometry(line.constGet().reversed())
newgeom = QgsGeometry.collectGeometry(reversed_lines )

(QgsGeometry.collectGeometry() is nice and fast too)

Hopefully that does!

Hi Jürgen,

thanks for your research.

Yes, this is true for GDAL, but as soon as the QPJ is missing,
QGIS switches back to 3044.

I figured out that adding AUTHORITY["EPSG","25832"] to the PRJ
makes QGIS parse it correctly. I'll write a small tool for my
co-workers. Or maybe even a QGIS plugin, which forces 25832
whenever 3044 is being detected. No good work-around :(

What about a feature to QGIS to force a CRS, if another one has
been detected? :)

Yeah, see blow.

Axis order will matter with new Proj4. Many things will change/break
here in future. Also scripts might fail because of different CRS.

> How do your .prj actually look like?

I don't have ArcGIS PRJs at the moment. I can add them tomorrow.
I've completely switched from ArcGIS to QGIS some years ago.

Take this example from Geodatenzentrum:
http://www.geodatenzentrum.de/projektion/utm32s.prj

Funny, three names for the same projection:
- QPJ: ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N
- PRJ (QGIS): ETRS89_UTM_zone_32N
- PRJ (Geodatenzentrum): ETRS_1989_UTM_Zone_32N

But even then, the user must be aware of which is the correct CRS.
I bet, it's complicated to code a notice to point out whether it
is a CRS of  national surveying or another...

Best regards,
Tobias

	Repository
Message-ID: <0EB9FD367992B34989FE637458DB2D692B55371F@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi all

I am currently involved in rolling QGIS 2.18 out in a corporate environment. The security risk of a user installing a malicious plugin from the Official Plugin Repository has come up.

While we can ensure our corporate plugin repository is immediately visible to all corporate users via a startup.py script, it appears that we:
- cannot remove the Official Plugin Repository from the repository list (due to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_18/python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py#L316-L326)
- cannot disable the Official Plugin Repository via Python API (and the user would just be able to enable via the Plugin Manager interface anyway)
- cannot set the Plugin Manager interface to only show trusted plugins
- cannot set the url parameters to include trusted=true as the url params are hardcoded: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_18/python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py#L228

So is there any other way to remove the Official Plugin Repository or limit the plugins that we allow users to view and install?

Thanks
Daniel

Hi all,
IMHO the name of the Versioning manu un DB Manager is not appropriate;
in my view, this add a history to the table, rather than versioning
(provided by more sophisticated plugins).
This could be the time to change it in Q£. Any objection?
All the best.

Hi all,

I really like the new buttons in the Processing panel, a small change
with a lot of benefits for the users.

There is a small problems: when changing something in the Processing
options (so Processing is reloading itself) the model and script buttons
are replicated over and over again in the Processing toolbar.

Hi Daniel

as you can see reading the code in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_18/python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py#L316-L326

repos are get from Settings (that you can install a custom one via
custom post install scripts) and repos are compared with officialRepo
array that is global scope var that you can and set via python

import pyplugin_installer
print pyplugin_installer.installer_data.officialRepo
(u'QGIS Official Plugin Repository',
'https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml',
'https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins')

because it's python you can overload/alias almost everithing, also
that function that have hardcoded params

btw If you find useful an enhancement, please file a PR with you
general solution that can be useful to other users.

just my 2c because I never approached this problem...

Not for QGIS 2.x sorry, QGIS 3 QgsSettings global settings allow to
customize installations for deployment on organizations but it was
introduced in QGIS 3 only.

I reported a serious QGIS 3 data corruption bug that occurs when the Toggle
Editing toolbar button is clicked. See

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17878

Additionally, when in editing mode, if you select a row from the Attribute
Table and click the "Delete selected features" icon, it actually deletes
two rows and not just the selected row.

I know that there is a lot of work you are all doing to get QGIS 3 ready
but I wanted to bring this issue to your attention because it is a serious
bug.

Thanks,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bug in DB Manager > Versioning?
Message-ID: <3167d95e-675e-470a-7af8-1952e84d73f3@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
the Versioning menu replaces the original primary key with a new one,
leaving the original id as a non PK field:

ALTER TABLE "public"."province_hist" ADD "id_hist" serial, ADD
"time_start" timestamp, ADD "time_end" timestamp;

ALTER TABLE "public"."province_hist" DROP CONSTRAINT
"province_hist_pkey", ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id_hist");

Then it adds only the original id, no PK, and not the new PK to the view:

CREATE VIEW "public"."province_hist_current" AS SELECT
"geom","provincia","id" FROM "public"."province_hist" WHERE "time_end"
IS NULL;

As a result, the view does not have an unique field, and cannot be loaded.
The fix is simple, just adding id_hist to view definition. Am I missing
something, or should I go ahead and fix it?

All the best, and thanks.

id should still be unique for all current rows, shouldn't it?  So you just have
to specify that id is the key (would be the same with id_hist).

Hi all,
dropping a shp with a strange prj (attached, recognized as EPSG:102091)
into a gpkg results in an error [0].
What is worse, the db becomes apparently unusable.
Data available, I can do further tests if useful.
Thanks.

Hi all,
after a long time, this evening I went through the queue of old tickets,
and quickly found a number that are still open, whereas the issue has
been fixed, sometimes since long. I think devoting more resources to
triaging is important.
I'm planning to do more triaging from now to the HF, anyone wants to join?
All the best.

Thanks Luigi,

If I do:

import pyplugin_installer

pyplugin_installer.installer_data.officialRepo = (
    QCoreApplication.translate(
        'QgsPluginInstaller',
        'QGIS Official Plugin Repository'),
    new_url,
    deprecated_url,
)

and also:

QSettings().setValue('Qgis/plugin-repos/QGIS Official Plugin Repository/url', new_url)

in my startup script then the official repository is successfully
replaced by our internal repository. Great!

If I submitted a PR that added a filter for trusted plugins similar to
the filters for experimental and deprecated plugins, could that only
be added to QGIS 3.2 (as a new feature)? Not 2.18?

Cheers
Daniel

good question that can be discussed in the PR. IMHO it's not a heavy
feature request that could affect usability, but it's the opinion of a
dev with low UX capabilities.

Yes, I did this in my startup script:

import pyplugin_installer

repos = pyplugin_installer.installer_data.Repositories

def trusted_url_params(self):
    """Add trusted parameter to be included in every request"""
    v = str(QGis.QGIS_VERSION_INT)
    return "?qgis={}.{}&trusted=true".format(int(v[0]), int(v[1:3]))

repos.urlParams = trusted_url_params

and while trusted=true then appeared in the plugin manager interface,
it did not filter the repository list. So looks like that parameter wasn't
supported after all.

IIRC this stubborn overwriting your URL by the plugin installer was added in 
QGIS 1.8, when we changed the official URL. So now I don't see any reasons to 
not remove it from master. I mean the URL would be added only if doesn't 
exist.

Last time when I submitted such PR (#5484), it ended up with removing the 
distinction of trusted status from the manager ;)

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4b0607a71fb9f981bf50a 

For more info, see the conclusions of this discussion: https://
lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2017-September/049695.html

So I'm afraid the trusted status won't be useful any more.

I'm of course available, but in general I tend to focus on recent
tickets, and since we had a clear roadmap for QGiS 3 I had focused
more on them in addition to the ones tagged as affecting our actual
LTR release.

Note: in Essen last year I prepared (and sent it to you) a list of
unique email addresses of users that had filed tickets that had no
activity for more than 3 years (I think it was 3 years). The plan we
agreed while there was that someone with a qgis.org mail address would
have mailied this persons asking to review that old tickets. As far as
I know this mass mailing wasn't done yet.

I cannot recover that email or the attached files. I surely sent it
during the hackfest in Essen, I also added in CC Richard and/or Jurgen
and/or Tim (can't recall now who exactly I added in CC).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changes to processing gdal:translate?
Message-ID: <1516980259257-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I'm trying to migrate the raster processing parts of qgis2web, and I'm
finding it hard working out all the processing changes. I think I've made
progress, but I'm now getting the following when I do
"processing.run("gdal:translate", {params})":

Incorrect parameter value for INPUT

In QGIS2, running translate without params gives the list of params and
types, including:

INPUT <ParameterRaster>

So I've set INPUT to the path to a raster file.In QGIS3, algorithmHelp now
says:

INPUT:  <QgsProcessingParameterRasterLayer>

What is a QgsProcessingParameterRasterLayer? Is a raster file (path) no
longer what is required? Or is my error elsewhere?

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <1516985931803-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

No, my mistake. I think there might be an issue with the processing wrapper
for gdal:warp. It takes the argument TARGET_EXTENT, and uses that for the
GDAL arg "-te". However, it then tries to add in extent details, and I think
there might be an incorrect variable name. In warp.py from line 190:

arguments.append(rasterExtent.xMinimum())
arguments.append(rasterExtent.yMinimum())
arguments.append(rasterExtent.xMaximum())
arguments.append(rasterExtent.yMaximum())

I'm not sure "rasterExtents" is defined, but substituting the more plausible
"extent" gets no extent value out.

Is this an issue, or are the Python bindings for Processing's
gdal:warpreproject working for others?

Thanks

Tom

​I'd like to second Giovanni's questions. ​The current situation is a bit
confusing and looks considerably more complex than the previous
implementation.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Defining GeoAlgorithm processing characteristics
 not working like I think it should
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqsrGew1UMZhEUt2dOrsYW+isz_nfLxUcYHee=uhTRfCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on making some of my QGIS plugin capabilities into processing
algorithms. When defining input parameter characteristics for the
GeoAlgorithm I want to do something like this:

self.addParameter(ParameterVector(self.LAYER, 'Line or polygon layer',
ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_LINE | ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_POLYGON))

I would like it to accept both a LINE and POLYGON layers. I was guessing
that ORing the two together would work. It does not and when I try it I
don't see any of my vector layers. If I use
ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_LINE or ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_POLYGON
alone then I get the respective line or polygon layers listed in my input
vector selection drop down.

I would use VECTOR_TYPE_ALL, but I don't want points listed. Do I need make
two geo algorithms, one of lines and the other for polygons or am I doing
something wrong?

I am using QGIS 2.18.16 on Windows.

Thanks,

Calvin

It requires a list, rather than bit flags.

self.addParameter(ParameterVector(self.LAYER, 'Line or polygon layer',
[ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_LINE,
ParameterVector.VECTOR_TYPE_POLYGON]))

I struggled with this API, and it's the best I could come up with at
the time. I'm more than happy if someone submits a PR to improve this.

(Same with https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/4841 - can we get a
volunteer to take over this and get it merged? Honestly, our
regression list is still long and I think my remaining time before
release is better spent tackling that. We have plenty of community
members who can write quality guides and who could chip in here -- but
the list of community members who can fix
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17364 is rather short.)

But -- while we're at it -- am I the only one who finds processing
script files in general to be full of a lot of black magic? (Note that
I'm referring to script files here, not proper algorithms). When
refactoring processing to c++ I kept the script syntax unchanged from
2.x as much as possible (with the exception of the sinks, which I
cannot work out how to improve - save for re-creating a dummy
VectorWriter object that wraps a bunch of stuff up). But to me it's
*always* been rather un-python-like how parameters and outputs are
defined in comments, how some variables are automatically created, how
some output variables are expected, etc.

It's not too late to improve this for 3.x. Why don't we get the daily
Python users and experts involved here and come up with a more
Python-like approach to processing scripts?

I suspect what's happening here is that the feature is being garbage
collected early, deleting the geometry and causing the unpredictable
behavior - try this:

f = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0]
f.geometry().constGet()...... etc

Message-ID: <23916c3c-4a4a-33cd-778b-8c4319db7f00@terglobo.nl>

Dear developers,

Today I suddenly wondered: Why can pgAdmin have a connection to a 
database *server* and automatically list all databases that are present 
while in QGIS I need to create a new connection for every individual 
postgresql/postgis database?

It would be very handy if QGIS could remember, for example, my 
localhost-postgres:postgres connection and update the available 
databases for me.

Would that be possible? (Or is it but am I doing something wrong here?)

Kind regards,
Raymond

Very good point! Does anyone know the rationale behind the script syntax?
Is there any big advantage over the nicely pythonic way of implementing
regular Processing algorithms like
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/SpatialIndex.py
?

Should we get rid of scripts with their special syntax and just have a way
to write
QgisAlgorithm
​s?​

Anita

IMHO this is worth a wider announcement and call for help, if possible
with some kickoff instructions.

agreed, I always wondered why we chose this approach. Of course, to use
services we have to ave single connections to individual DBs.

Hi,

I agree that it would be desirable that all available DBs would be 
listed. As to services: the pg_service.conf file also contains several 
entries, so it would also be possible to list all available service 
configurations.

Just a wish: if we go this route, please, please, don't open all DBs at 
once. Just list the available DBs, let the user choose one of the 
available ones and then open only the DB the user is interested in. 
Otherwise it would be a performance issue. We have DBs with serveral 
hundred tables, sometimes > 1000. If they would be opened all at once, 
it would be really slow.

agreed; this is also the approachof other clients (pgAdmin3, phppgadmin).

Hi,

Technically, we always need to connect to a database :-)

What we can do is to connect to the 'postgres' database using the user
credentials to query all the available databases, and then use something
like "DECLARE alldbs CURSOR FOR select * from pg_database" to retrieve
the list of available databases.

The user then chooses the database he wants to connect to.

Maybe we need some additional logic/configuration parameters for cases
when there are different roles to access different databases. Roles and
role permissions are the only issue related to this approach.

I think we can change the QGIS logic just by changing the interface.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Honestly I think script syntax wasn't that bad. At least it was quite easy
for a set of power users, as I could verift during my past courses.
Anyway I agree with the rationale: having a unified, pythonic way, to write
both algorithms and scripts... well, might be the case to ultimately drop
scripts?

Whatever the choice, we should make users aware of the current unclear
situation, that things are being discussed and still evolving. This will
prevent confusion and maybe encourage participation.

How could this discussion be brought forward? My first question would be:
do we still need scripts?

In any case thanks to Nyall and the others for the great work! ;)

It is possible to write algorithms using same approach as in core. Just create
"provider plugin" and that's it. This functionality was here almost
from the very
beginning of the Processing.

Thank you for your help Lauri!

Motivated by your recommendations and the post
https://gisforthought.com/updating-a-plugin-from-qgis-2-to-qgis-3/, I
figured it out:

I copied python-qgis-dev.bat and appended

set
PATH=%PATH%;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-rel-dev;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-rel-dev\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\bin;C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\DLLs;C:\Program
Files\Java\jre1.8.0_91\bin
C:\Users\anita\ide-latest-released\eclipse\eclipse.exe

This way, eclipse starts and I can add the OSGeo4W Python3 interpreter.

Regards,
Anita

I know Alexander. The point was processing scripts and their future...

I've decided to go the algorithm provider plugin route for my scripts:
https://anitagraser.com/2018/01/28/porting-processing-scripts-to-qgis3/

But I'm also thinking of my students whom I want to show how to write tools
for QGIS. For many of them, it's their first contact with Python, so
starting a provider plugin is well out of their comfort zone. On the other
hand, the scripts are not very pythonic. Many beginners already had issues
with the QGIS2 version of scripts. I think, they would have an easier time
if they would only have to implement a QgsProcessingAlgorithm with the rest
of the provider plugin complexity hidden from their sight. If that's
possible.

Regards,
Anita

Subject: [QGIS-Developer]  Web based admin interface for processing models
Message-ID: <1517217205794-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
My employer has a growing need for spatial ETL. A few examples of tasks:

- Pull adress data text files from FTP, process, validate and load into
PostGIS. This should be done every night.
- Pull data from a number of sources, process it, zip and and publish to
FTP. Also every night.
- Pull data from internal PostGIS and publish externally. Also every night.
- Using a web map, let users select type of data, area of interest, file
format, SRID and download data upon request.

I would prefer to use a web based interface for managing, scheduling and
running these tasks. Our main tool for spatial ETL is FME, so using FME
Server/Cloud is an obvious option. However, given the steady advances in
Processing models in QGIS, I wonder if this option is a more suitable
alternative in the long run, especially since we use QGIS heavily for
desktop tasks.

Are there any plans on adding this kind of functionality (a web based admin
interface) to QGIS? Is anyone thinking of creating the basis for this in a
suggestion for the next round of the QGIS grant programme?

Best regards,

Magnus

Change committed. Thanks Tim for suggestions about naming.
All the best.

Hi Anita,
that's exactly what I also was thinking about. What about dropping scripts
in favour of "on the fly"  QgsProcessingAlgorithms?
A single, unified, way of defining them, without the special parameters
syntax of scripts...

Rephrasing what I wrote before, what about dropping ScriptAlgorithm and
make ScriptAlgorithmProvider simply provide its algorithms from the special
scripts folder?

And when we create a new script from the toolbox, it's providing us a
python template more or less like this
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/exampleprovider/ExampleAlgorithm.py
?
With some comments to help script writers, it will be nice, yes.

BTW, I just noticed that this file hasn't been updated.

Message-ID: <CAH9Vc8tLeKZ1Ttq9n2u53G3Q3tT0qAv8WPiQn6gqJrGuhAKKDg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to grab the pixels that intersect with my polygon shapefile and
apply transparency to them (that is, I'm trying to create a hole in my
raster)

For that, I get all the pixels that are in the footprint of the shapefile
in a list (see code below)

Then I used the QgsRasterTransparency.TransparentThreeValuePixel () class
to apply transparency, but I get an error message:

Error message: AttributeError: 'Dataset' object has no attribute 'renderer'

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Get rid of Processing scripts in favour of plain
	alogrithms
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=y6+eXG=XH9PKPa+xTF0bt1nZdmz7ssGyYgLSpXff70fA@mail.gmail.com>

I raise this topic with a new thread, because I think it's worth a
dedicated discussion.
Some questions were asked in another thread [1] about the status of
Processing scripts. It was noticed that the scripts are a "chimera", with a
special syntax and not very pythonic. The current implementation accentuate
it, because API refactoring poured necessarely into scripts too...

In short my proposal is to get rid of scripts as we know them, and make
ScriptAlgorithmProvider a simpler option to create GeoProcessingAlgorithms,
without the burden of implementing a brand new GeoAlgorithmProvider and /
or a plugin to ship it.

ScriptAlgorithmProvider could load GeoProcessingAlgorithms from the same
special folder as it is for scripts now, maybe using the features offered
by Python's imp module (e.g. for module reloading while testing in the
script editor).
As suggested by Etienne Trimaille, an alogrithm skeleton could also be
offered to start developing the algorithm, similar to what can be found
here [2].

The gain would a unified way for writing (Python) algorithms, less code
(and bugs) to mantain, and a pure pythonic approach in coding.

What's your opinion?

All the best,
Giovanni

I'm still having problems. In warp.py, line 198, the following is added as an
argument:

extentCrs.authid()

I've confirmed that extentCrs is a QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem. However,
authid() seems to be returning an empty string. I don't understand why.

Can anyone confirm?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Rashad,
unclear to me how do you want to manage binaries for the many OS and
versions QGIS supports.
Thanks for clarifications.

Perhaps I'm using this wrong, but is it outputting empty strings?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bringing back a *highly curated* blocker tag on
	redmine?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashv=iJbQU16=9NnD0qCU0Y0ZrSw+7t3vBFTnC0BR9VswA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to raise the idea of resurrecting the "blocker" tag on
redmine. I understand the reasons behind its original removal, and
fully agree that the new process is working much better.

BUT...

We have two extremely serious issues open against QGIS 3.0, which I
think SHOULD block the release. These are:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17985 : Huge memory leak with NULL
attributes in Python
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17916 : Crashes and instability with Qt 5.10

I don't think we can proceed with any 3.0 release while these two
issues are unsolved.

That's why I'd like to see the blocker tag brought back, but with it
actually BLOCKING the release (vs the previous definition, which
ultimately just meant "hey please fix this because it impacts me a
lot!"). And I'd like to see it highly curated to avoid users tagging
their own pet bugs with it.

Thoughts?


Side note: These two bugs are very tricky. Numerous developers have
looked into them without luck. They may be upstream library issues, or
something we cause in QGIS code. Please, if you have any developer
hours available and any insights into them it would be very much
appreciated!

Hi All,

I am an avid supporter to OTB and would love to see the plugin brought more in line with latest developments in OTB. The binaries issue will always exist and I believe OTB should support the same ones for which Qgis binaries are available already. The other platforms should have a clear build from source documentation. These should be listed in the RFC.

Confirmed - fixed by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6216. Currently
it's only working for gdal drivers with the GDAL_DCAP_RASTER
capability, which excludes common ones like JPEG.

I agree we should not release in case of very serious problems. The
points are: what is the threshold? Who decides?
IMHO is the release manager who ultimately has to decide.

All the best.

I think that a carefully used BLOCKER tag makes a lot of sense.

There are some bugs that we should definitely not be part of a release or
this will seriously impact user's trust in QGIS both as a software and as a
community.

I also suggest that the ones who take care of the bug queue (kind of QA
managers) should be in charge of managing and lifting the blocker tag.

Hello Paolo,

OTB provides a full bundle of all libs, apps and dependencies for three OS
platforms (windows, linux and macos) for every release[1] and every day[2]
These packages are tested on dashboard[3] with list of tests passing.
[1] https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org//packages/
[2] https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org//packages/nightly/latest/
[3] https://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=OTB

what I was implying was the qgis descriptor files will be included in this
packages for ease install/change of otb versions.

For instance, if you have OTB 6.4 already working with plugin. An update of
otb to 6.8 will be
1. download package
2. update otb install prefix in the plugin configuration. (in sed world
s/6.4/6.8/g :)

Regarding qgis versions, there is nothing much to do if you don't change
OTB.

Hope that helps,

I'm also very much in favor of bringing it back.

Just a note: when we added the "blocker" tag (circa 2011) it wasn't
because of the "hey please fix this because it impacts me a lot!" kind
of tickets. It was added at a point we decided to enforce fixing all
the regressions before releasing a new version. During that time the
program improved *a lot*, in fact its development and adoption started
snowballing, new tickets started rain in and everything become more
complicated (and since a while it is even more complicated with both
LTR that needs to keep going and QGIS3 to be developed).

I agree that we must decide what should be tagged a blocker without
any doubt (other than obvious issues as the ones pointed by Nyall).

Examples of what, in my opinion, should be a always a real blocker:

* a regression that causes data corruption (like the one that caused
to compute wrong area in several 2.* releases)
* a regression that causes qgis to crash (and it wasn't the case in
previous releases)

else?

cheers!

Hell Tisham,

Can you explain the part of binaries issue?

The documentation of build from source is already there for OTB. The new
module which if merged into Modules/Wrappers/QGIS will be like any other
otb module.
Since there are no external dependencies, this could be enabled by default.
So need to specific documentation to build it is not required.

But once the coding work is done, there will be another (RFC) and in that i
will include the usage, builds options etc..

Hi,

It seems that QGIS 2.99 weekly snapshot is only available in 32 bits 
version.
Does anyone know why the 64 bits version isn't available anymore ?

It currently exceeds NSIS' 2GB limit (GRASS needs py2 - so we have to include
py2 & 3).

Is the OSGeo4W installer an option for you?

Thanks again, Nyall. I'm not confident enough to log these on Redmine, as
I've not looked into the Processing code before.

I think _every_ regression should be marked as a blocker.
Finding out that something broke on upgrade is a very frustrating
experience for users (us included). If such degradation was known
in advance (was in the bug tracker) it suggests release managers
did not care about such announced frustrating experience.

I still don't understand this obsession with regressions ;)

Any bug that is severe should block the release.  Whether it's a regression or
not doesn't matter.

If it's an unavoidable bug in some heavy used thing that is new, it's just as
blocking as a big bug in known territory.

IMHO a bug in some remote, hardly used function shouldn't block a release -
even if it's a regression that corrupts data and causes qgis to crash in some
edge cases.  We'll probably have plenty of those that we don't know of anyway.

To me it's just a matter of the impact on usablity a bug has.  I'd opt for
common sense instead of setting strict rules.


Jürgen

Hello Jürgen,

apparently the open bugs which are regressions and cause data
corruption or crashes are only 10 in number at the moment (of which I
reported one). I think they are important because they can catch you
by surprise in tested and established workflows. New things will
probably only be used heavily in serious contexts after some testing,
so I feel that problems there are not quite as important.

Kind regards,

Daan

Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9322B24BAE9@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I am looking for suggestions on how to debug a plugin that is crashing QGIS3

I am trying to port the contour plugin to QGIS3.  The port is largely done but there is one outstanding issue that causes QGIS to die.

The plugin uses the python matplotlib library to do the contouring.  It has two modes of operating.  If the source data is gridded it will use the plt.contour function, and this is working as it should.  If the data is not gridded it uses the plt.tricontour function, which builds a triangulation and then uses that to do the contouring.   When the plugin calls this function it crashes QGIS.  I've extracted the data used in the function call from QGIS and run the tricontour function from a simple python program and it runs without error.  So something in the QGIS plugin environment is causing this to fail.

Can you suggest approaches to debugging this, or getting more information about where it is failing (or for that matter fixing it).   The code in question is in

https://github.com/ccrook/QGIS-Contour-Plugin/blob/qgis3_wip/contour/contour.py#L846

I am running on ubuntu 16.04 using the ubuntugis-nightly distribution.  Details are

Hi Chris

Have you attached a debugger, and therefore can you get a backtrace? I think
that's what you'll need.

Message-ID: <ca142a9176dbc15ac9a4a4435a6d6abe@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have a QGIS project with a history (started in QGIS 2.x) that we
carried over to QGIS 3. 

Since some time (some weeks) for every redraw I get several times
(probably for every layer) the following warning message in the "Qt" log
message panel: 

2018-01-30T13:51:13 WARNING No QgsCoordinateTransformContext context set
for transform
2018-01-30T13:51:13 WARNING No QgsCoordinateTransformContext context set

for transform
2018-01-30T13:51:13 WARNING No QgsCoordinateTransformContext context set
for transform 

I believe this has to do with the recent changes in datum handling. 

But how would I fix the issue to get rid of the flood of warning
messages? After a few redraws there are thousands iterations of the same
warning message. 

Thank you for your help!

Andreas,

I've dealt with two sources of such warnings today, one which caused one
warning on every canvas redraw (the north arrow decoration), the other
caused many warnings upon (re-)drawing the content of the overview panel.

One of the few remaining sources of warnings is with the WMS/XYZ raster
provider. But that's unlikely to be tackled prior to release of 3.0.
Fortunatelly, the warnings are harmless, and won't show on non-debug builds.

Hi,

The issue is not PyQGIS but rather unfixed call to QgsCoordinateTransform
constructors.

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5535 and the "future work" part.
According to Nyall, some are quite complex to fix and not in the first
priority (like map rendering, copy/paste, etc).

Cheers,
Denis

I have been seeing the chatter about Processing scripts and plugins. I just

possibility that the way processing scripts may be changed, should I hold
off in developing further processing routines in my plugins or is this only
going to apply to processing scripts and not processing plugins?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] plugin causes 2.99 to crash - help?
Message-ID: <1517325672568-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I'm converting qgis2web for QGIS3, and a lot of the work is done. However,
the following steps cause QGIS to crash:

1. start qgis2web (Github master)
2. if Leaflet is selected, click "Update preview", otherwise select Leaflet
3. close the plugin dialog

This crashes QGIS (latest nightly), and has done with the nightlies for a
long time (issue raised here on 13 December:
https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/590). I therefore assume it's
something in the plugin code which causes the crash, not in QGIS.

Points to note - the issue does *NOT* occur:

1. with QGIS2 (with compatible qgis2web version)
2. if no preview has been triggered
3. if only an OpenLayers preview has been triggered (instead of a Leaflet
one)
4. if a Leaflet export is triggered without a preview

Nathan's crash handler gives this:

*Crash ID*: 02cceb1e82fb35298845d686d09e3e52b108ee1b

As Nathan points out on the plugin issue thread linked to above, the crash
seems to occur in QtWebkit, but beyond that, I have no clues on the cause,
or how to fix.

So:

1. Do others confirm this issue on Windows?
2. How about other OSes
3. Any ideas on solving the problem?

Many thanks for any help anyone can offer. I'm very close to finishing the
conversion, so I really want to try to solve this.

Many thanks

(see nabble link for context)

i've run this with a debugger.  It does indeed identify the location of the
crash as in the matplotlib triangulation function, and specifically within
qh_initstatistics which is called to construct the convex hull of the
points.  Which I guess means there is an issue with matplotlib.  But the
same function call outside QGIS works, so I'm wondering if the python3
runtime environment in QGIS could in some way be different to the command
line run time environment.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How are Featured Plugins Chosen?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTps6+s6VJA6Y_uoeh4RVjAkRHhWe9DCVbc1E9GwWcAdCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am curious about how he so called Featured Plugins are chosen and I know
it is very subjective so I apologize if this is a bad question. I think
there are some very good choices on that list and then I think there might
be some better choices put on. Do these change? I haven't really monitored
them, but when ever I look they seem like they are about the same set.

The important ones in my opinion are:
qgis2web
QucikMapServices
Qgis2threejs - Although with QGIS3 this may not be as important of a plugin
Quick Finder
TimeManager
Geocoding

The others listed will only be used by a small set of users and some by a
very small set of user. I'm sure there are other plugins that would be
better to feature. I think some of the new plugins, if they are evaluated
to work well, have a unique capability, and have good documentation on how
to use it, should occasionally be featured.

Thanks,

Calvin

Interesting question.

Many websites advertise the number of downloads, which I consider to
be total nonsense. Interesting would be a rating like "usage per month".
Even installations per month don't make sense to me, because I have
installed some plugins that I don't use - I'm just too lazy to
uninstall them :)

BUT this would make some plugins stay on the top forever...

Maybe you should also consider how well a plugin is documented and
whether there are examples. This could give a more positive assessment,
With many plugins I have no idea how to use them at all.

Best regards,
Tobias

It's a list manually curated by the devs. The idea is that there are lots of
other objective stats on the plugins website to give people quantitative
data about different plugins, so this is some kind of qualitative judgement.

That said, I guess the list needs consideration. Should plugins only
available for QGIS 2 be in the list, once QGIS 3 has been launched?

I know there are much more important priorities in view of the QGIS 3.0
release.
I will try to implement the idea of Geoalgorithms served by the script
provider and, in case, I'll commit a PR for testing and comments.

Hi Rashad,

I meant pre-built OTB binaries rather than plugin binaries. I believe QGIS builds on more platforms than OTB does.

Regards,

Tisham.

Hell Tisham,

Can you explain the part of binaries issue?

The documentation of build from source is already there for OTB. The new module which if merged into Modules/Wrappers/QGIS will be like any other otb module.
Since there are no external dependencies, this could be enabled by default. So need to specific documentation to build it is not required.

But once the coding work is done, there will be another (RFC) and in that i will include the usage, builds options etc..

Hi All,

I am an avid supporter to OTB and would love to see the plugin brought more in line with latest developments in OTB. The binaries issue will always exist and I believe OTB should support the same ones for which Qgis binaries are available already. The other platforms should have a clear build from source documentation. These should be listed in the RFC.

I like the idea, but i dont think it will mean less code, specially
for defining the parameters and outputs. Why not keeping it for those
that want to use it this way?

Before removing this (in case it's decided to do so), two things to notice:

-- There were algorithms (built-in ones) defined this way, so they
should be rewritten
-- There is a little-known functionality that creates a new plugin
from a set of scripts. It should be adapted as well, or removed.

Thanks!

I understand your point Victor, and I agree that scripts was a clever idea.
But:

 - with the current shape of Processing (QGIS 3.0) I think the "syntactic
sugar" provided by scripts has less relevance. As I can see from the
refactoring, there's less automation in parameters conversions and
management, and a few new "magic" context variables have been introduced. I
think scripts now are too similar to plain geoalgorithms, and consequently
the differences can become misleading and not easily understood.

 - syntactic sugar requires maintanance: if a new parameter is introduced,
i parameters are added or changed, the corresponding translation method for
scripts must be updated.

 - syntactic sugar requires doc maintanance, while Processing APIs
documentation can be mostly automated.

Anyway, this is a proposal to be discussed. Meanwhile I will try to
estimate the work needed to drop (and adapt) the current implementations.

PS: @Victor, it's nice to follow Processing's history! C++ (SAGA) -> Java
(Sextante) -> Python (Processing) -> C++ (QGIS 3.0)  :D

All the best,
Giovanni

Hi all,

I'm writing this mail hoping to help somebody else that experienced the
same problem with Ubuntu 16.04 and the build of QGIS with Qt 5.9

Following the instructions on Martin's website I had to adjust some
small parameter:

1. **after** running ccmake and generating all the files I had to export
the variable

export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/qt59/lib/cmake/

2. then I could run cmake with all the flags

and finally QGIS has been compiled against Qt 5.9 version and I can use
the 3D ;)

Hope this could help other people

Cheers

Matteo

plugin code is in python. so nothing much to worry on binaries part and
they depend on qgis processing code.
QGIS had removed otb plugin from processing and kept others. So there is
another stuff to work on user side and developer side.

Right, I see you your point.

I havent been able to follow the recent developments in Processing,
and i have to admit i am a little bit lost (Nyall has been working too
fast!!). So this is just my opinion, but it might not make sense in
the current situation.

I will try to get up to date as soon as possible :-)

Thanks for your collaboration!

I think I understood better now, thanks. In practice, you
mean adding to OTB a small package who would act as a wrapper for OTB
algs withing QGIS? So only OTB-specific stuff, nothing that can be
generalized to other backend?
All the best.

+1
IMHO, responsability for this is shared between Release Manager and QA
manager. I think a review of high priority bugs (178 now) before release
by the two managers, possibly helped by other devs as Nyall has pointed
out, would be a good approach.
A very important point, thanks for raising it.
All the best.

Hi all,
thanks for this question. I confirm that the choice is subjective, done
by the many people included in the staff of plugin management. As
pointed out, this has been neglected in recent times. I'd welcome any
suggestion on plugins to include in or remove from the list.
One related issue is how to give more emphasis on user ratings: this
could be a useful guide for others, but has been underutilized, and not
prominently exposed. Ideas and contributions on this also welcomed.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Keeping OTB algorithm in qgis processing
Message-ID: <CANNqv9epnPfbhyPODTXdNnDJXX9OeHqXRJ8=KOrvpiuCRj2CWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I would like to check the pros and cons of keeping otb in qgis processing
like others.  SAGA, GRASS, GDAL etc..

one or only argument, I found interesting is the fixes to otb plugin can be
done independent of qgis release and versions. But how does other
algorithms won't get this cool feature and only OTB?

One of the reasons why otb plugin got outdated was the separate maintenance
issue. otb team were not involved in maintaining this code
(processing/algs/otb) on a regular basis. And I don't think putting work on
otb team is interesting here. The plugin code works closely with qgis
processing with some specifics for running otb. So someone from otb team
needs to track changes in qgis code to keep users from running into
problems (installation or running of plugins itself)

For one thing, this didn't worked out well in the past. All  algorithms now
in qgis master is updated for qgis3 except for OTB because it's an external
plugin. Well, it not like other plugins it depends on qgis processing
plugin.

And due to this change code got left out by both teams. so the argument
that updates are independently managed is easy didn't worked here. the
problem is solved by creation of another one.

The old code has lot of hack among other issues. So fixing that is a
priority for otb. By that I mean no specific hacks and easy to maintain
like SAGA, GRASS etc...
With that change coming, are you folks interested to put back otb algo into
processing/algs/otb.?

yes. the wrapper will provide necessary descriptor file for otb application
that qgis processing can use.

Surely Victor and Alex can provide further details.
All the best.

The original idea was to have most providers removed...which included
R, GRASS and SAGA as well. Finally, only certain providers were
removed, mostly those that require dependencies not provided with QGIS
(LiDAR tools, R...and OTB)

If maintaining the plugin is complicated and no work is done on that,
then definitely it is better to keep it as core. But we have to make
sure that the user knows that the provider by itself is useless, and
that OTB has to be installed separately. Otherwise, we will see
confusion and i think it will not be a good idea

My 2 cents

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issues with Postgis transactions and save points
Message-ID: <52a596f4e3dbe442073ac5726f756126@carto.net>

Hi, 

Since a few days I have a lot of troubles with Postgis transactions. 

In the Postgis log section I get messages like: 

--------------------- 

2018-01-31T11:15:28 WARNING Erroneous query: SAVEPOINT
"{241d5071-f646-4fde-9c5d-7fc8de8f72b8}" returned 7 [ERROR: SAVEPOINT
can only be used in transaction blocks] 

2018-01-31T11:15:28 WARNING Erroneous query: SAVEPOINT
"{f29b5a18-0d47-4ebc-a29e-1c43e60b0ab8}" returned 7 [ERROR: SAVEPOINT
can only be used in transaction blocks] 

--------------------- 

As a consequence data is not saved correctly. 

The same project worked fine 2-3 weeks ago. Any idea what might have
changed in the last couple days regarding Postgis transactions that
Postgis with transactions is now failing? 

Thanks if you have any ideas how to find out what is wrong here, 

Andreas

Another reason to remove providers is that algorithms descriptions
were not updated and maintained. Even now both SAGA and GRASS
providers are not updated to latest stable versions of the corresponding
software.

We just simply does not have enough resources to maintain more than
600 algorithms from GRASS and SAGA. Situation with OTB, was even
worse, it requires special handling of the parameters.

I still think that Processing should be in core with minimal set of algorithms
(native and GDAL), all other providers should be plugins and installed by
users. Ideally these providers also should be maintained by interested groups
of devs/users, not by QGIS devs.

Okay.
I propose the following change.
an otb provider without much complication to maintain for qgis and is not
tied to specific otb version
A provider will allow to download && install latest otb binary packages
(optional) for user's who don't have OTB.
Ofcourse, a download of otb isn't just download, it will configure itself
for qgis processing.
So the provider itself is usable in a way without otb, because it can
handle installation if one needs to.

OTB is included in the standalone for win (at least for 32 bit, IMHO it
should be also in 64 bit). In Debian this is not an issue.
All the best.

I understand the point all too well; the big risk here is these
providers will fall into oblivion, with a big damage to QGIS as a whole.
Overall, I'm in favour of keeping these as a part of the project,
supported by it.
All the best.

we can seek additional resources to maintain it. Perhaps OTB team is

the old plugin code had lot of issue like maintain list of supported
version, keeping a backlist and whilelist for supported applications (don't
ask),
splitting of apps because groups aren't supported to name a few.
And I think this one of the blocking point for qgis and also otb. It need
to put a lot of efforts to maintain otb provider and cost is triple
compared to others
 If the plugin code was simply generic, qgis would have done maintain it
like old way. Because you only need to change plugin if there is are API
changes,
or some stuff that is made into processing itself. This one will be easy
because all source is in tree you can find places where it needs to change
like:

-from processing.core.AlgorithmProvider import AlgorithmProvider
+from qgis.core import QgsProcessingProvider

And this are back normal.

What I can propose is to lower the burden on maintenance but the code
should be put back to qgis if possible.
So qgis can focus on issue related only to that and after a while things
will stabilize.

Indeed, if there is something broken in this algo otb team will help fix it.

All the best.

Here are my suggestions taking into account that this is highly subjective
and different users are going to have their favorite plugins. I think
featured plugins should include...
1. Semi-permanent plugins in the list that are used by a broad user
community. The ones on the current list that I would place in this category
are:

Ignore that last e-mail. It was fat fingered and automatically sent. I am
going to prepare the e-mail outside of firefox so I don't do that again.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Any work done around flatpak/snap/appimage?
Message-ID: <72efd9cf16ba476618434153274969b3@carto.net>

Hi, 

A member from the German QGIS user group asked me whether QGIS.ORG plans
to provide flatpak/snap or appimage versions of QGIS to allow
simultaneous installations of different versions on the same machine,
e.g. for testing purposes. 

Is someone working on it? I know there have been discussions around it
already. 

Greetings,
Andreas

Here are my suggestions taking into account that this is highly subjective
and different users are going to have their favorite plugins. Featured
plugins should be bug free and have good documentation/tutorials on how to
use them. Featured plugins should fall into one of several categories.

1. Semi-permanent plugins that are used by a broad user community. (I wish
there were a way to know what plugins people actually use - not just
download.) The ones on the current list that I would place in this category
are:
    a. qgis2web
    b. QuickMapServices - It may be that is becoming less important because
of the XYZ Tile Server
    c. Quick Finder
    d. Time Manager - Perhaps this should be in category 2 although I use
it.

2. Plugins that have a high value to a part of the user community and I
think they should be featured but not all the time. The ones currently in
the list that I would place in this category are:
    a. LRS - Useful to a small set of users
    b. Qgis2threejs - Really cool visualization, but once again I think it
is a smaller set of users
    c. ScriptRunner - Useful for programmers.
    d. Plugin Builder - Useful for beginning plugin developers.

3. Plugins that are new that have some unique capability or have been
evaluated to have a big impact.

The following plugins that are on the Featured plugin list I would suggest
removing or perhaps occasionally rotating them through. I am not suggesting
that they are not important. I'm sure that those who developed them use
them, but I think they have a smaller user community so perhaps others
should be highlighted. These include:
    a. Layer Board
    b. QConsolidate - Note that its plugin home page link is broken.
    c. lizmap
    d. Item Browser
    e. GeoCoding - I like Quick Finder better

The following plugins could be candidates for occasional inclusion as least
on a rotating bases.
    a. Copy Canvas to Clipboard - This is a small set of people but useful
if you want a snapshot of the canvas.
    b. Data Plotly - QGIS 3 plugin so perhaps it should not be included
until QGIS 3 becomes more mainstream, but it has great potential.
    c. Lat Lon Tools - One of my most used plugins, but I am kind of biased.
    d. Profile tool - I have used this on a number of occasions, but it
needs better documentation
    e. Split Features On Steroids - This is a newer plugin that I have
found to be quite useful.
    f. QGIS Resource Sharing - Should at least be featured sometime.
    g. pgRoutingLayer - Important for those doing map routing.
    h. Shape Tools - Another one I use, but once again I am very biased.
    i. Other analysis plugins, but I am not sure which ones should be
placed on this list. 'Hotspot Analysis' could be cool if it ever gets out
of the experimental stage.

Quite frankly I am not sure how to judge candidates for inclusion because I
am not looking at all of them and my interests and needs are going to be
different from the next user, but it would be nice to feature different
plugins that are unique to a set of the user community or different
categories of plugins, why they are useful, and to have a nice write up
about them.

Best wishes,

Calvin

apply transparency, but I get an error message:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Question about Mac Installer
Message-ID: <26e20af7-e78b-4ea4-62cf-1d093a5c0ce8@wildintellect.com>

Question 1.
The QGIS.org download page
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html says:
"This version requires separate installation of dependency framework
(GDAL Complete) , also found at the download link below."

Kyngchaos says http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis
"All required items are included on the disk image."

Which is it? I don't actually have a Mac to test, trying to download
files to take to others who need it.

Question 2.
Kyngchaos page states
"Install Note: OS X security may block installation, as I'm not an
"identified developer" (ie not paying Apple to develop software)."

Didn't OSGeo buy an Apple Signing cert just for issues like this?

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Kernel density of SAGA broken?
Message-ID: <6dda4903-1a73-f5a3-8a99-1947a605fb43@gmail.com>

Hi,

sorry for continuing bombing the mailing list.

I'm testing some random algorithms and it seems that the Kernel density
of SAGA is broken. Or worst, it seems working, a kind of output is
created (but it is not visible) and no error or stack traces.

But from the shell I can read:

ERROR 1:
/tmp/processing_7ef0f968a47545ab860059bd3fe312b1/80a5870e495c4905a5775f0d08d1b395/TARGET_OUT_GRID.sdat,
band 1: Failed to compute statistics, no valid pixels found in sampling.

I tried with the Heatmap algorithm (same layer, same parameters) and
works like a charm.

Tested also with different data but same result

BTW: one set of data I used is the one of John Snow of the Processing
training manual with the parameters suggested [0]

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks

Matteo

Looks like outdated information.

I'd follow the advice next to the download.

We don't have own packages for OSX yet.  IIRC the cert was initiated by Larry
Shaffer and there was a grant to update the installer scripts and produce a
signed installer[0] - but AFAIK that didn't happen yet.

We only signed the OSGeo4W installer and the Windows standalones so far.

Message-ID: <A87E66F06E86F14B857F2EB047CDF9322B250C35@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

I am updating some plugins which use QgsExpression, and I'm wondering about the best way to use expressions in QGIS3.  It in the past I used a pattern like:

  exp=QgsExpression(expressionText)
  exp.prepare(fields)
  request=QgsFeatureRequest()
  request.setSubsetOfAttributes( expression.referencedColumns(), fields )
  for feat in layer.getFeatures(request)
      value=expression.evaluate(feat)

However with QGIS3 this has clearly changed!  QgsExpression is not included in the QGIS3 API https://qgis.org/api/annotated.html.  The prepare and referencedColumns are no longer defined. I did have a look at the C++ code for QgsExpression, but I find I'm still looking for guidance.

I've searched the QEP issues  been able to locate a QEP, or other documentation.  Can anyone point me to some documentation or provide an example of current best practice please.

Correction: prepare and referencedColumns are still present, prepare takes
QgsExpressionContext rather than fields.  So I think the pattern is very
little changed

Its kind of both. For convenience, Willian (Kyngchaos) has included all needed installer packages in the QGIS download archive. So simply download it, open the DMG and install each package as indicated by the README inside the DMG.

Defer to Jürgen’s answer on this.

That's a bug with the generated docs (fix incoming ) - it's still
around. BTW you may prefer the work-in-progress Python API docs here:
http://python.qgis.org/api/

Best place to check first is the API breaks docs:

https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html

This details the changes in QgsExpression (amongst all the other classes).

Hope that helps!

A big +1 to everything Alex said above, and a strong -1 to
reintroducing any of these providers back to master (and also a +1 to
shifting the SAGA provider to a non-default plugin).

My reasons:

- we have a very strong plugin infrastructure designed EXACTLY for
these use cases. Having these providers as separate plugins, free from
the QGIS release cycle makes a ton of sense. Plugins devs can then
push new versions of their providers whenever new versions of the
underlying libraries are available, and not be constrained by waiting
until the next QGIS release.

- years of experience has PROVEN that we do not have the capacity to
maintain these providers ourselves. Numerous developers have tried,
and just been swamped by the amount of work required to keep the
providers stable while the underlying libraries change. The QGIS team
is running at capacity just keeping QGIS maintained and stable - we
CANNOT take on this extra work.

- regardless of the approach taken, things just don't stay stable for
us. E.g. we tried to make the SAGA provider more stable by only
targeting the SAGA LTR release.... yet the SAGA upstream seem to have
abandoned the LTR, leaving it totally broken on newer build chains. I
cannot get SAGA LTR to run on my development platform (Fedora) as it
constantly segfaults. End result - even if I had the time to maintain
this provider, I would be totally unable to. (For this reason I think
SAGA should also be moved to a separate QGIS plugin, leaving on QGIS,
GDAL and GRASS provided in the default install. GDAL and GRASS
(mostly) are always available wherever QGIS is.).

- While QGIS 3.0 has introduced big changes for processing, these are
likely to be the last big changes processing providers will see for
the future. At least for the next 3-4 years (or lifetime of 3.x) the
API will be fixed. And even following that, I'd envision any breaks
introduced in 4.0 to be much less extreme. So while it's painful for
plugins to update their providers for 3.0, it's a one-time pain. In
contrast, expecting QGIS devs to follow the numerous underlying
library changes and version breaks for multiple 3rd party dependancies
is exhausting, ongoing work. It's much more sensible for someone
intimately familiar with those libraries to maintain a plugin which
closely tracks the library development and follow best-practice API
use for that library.

I'm a bit late to this discussion, but my 2c:

- I actually like the idea of single file script algorithms, and don't
want to see them go. I can see lots of valid use cases for why they
are needed. (In particular - I'd love to extend models in future to
allow embedded script algorithms which are contained just within a
single model, and not exposed elsewhere).

- It's just the syntax of scripts which I'm not a fan of (for reasons
well covered above)

Alex has a WIP PR already at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6225  -
stakeholder comments would be welcome here!

Cool! Probably it wasn't clear my suggestion, but that's exactly what I
meant: keep "scripts" but get rid of the special syntax and implement
QgsProcessingAlgorithm subclasses.

+1 from me. This is exactly the reasoning behind my original proposal
of removing providers from core. Whether the plugin is easy to
maintain or not, it is better to do it outside. People responsible of
the plugin can release whenever they want, and they can do changes
without having to do PRs to the main repo (so less burden for core
devs)

A plugin with a provider has much more to do with the provider app
than with QGIS, and it makes sense to maintain it as a separate thing,
and, if possible, done by the people that better know the external app
(like the OTB team in the case of OTB)

Cheers
