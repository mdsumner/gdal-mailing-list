Hi users and devs,

I just created a very simple function [1] to create all the missing spatial
indexes on your table geometry columns.

It is the 1st version, has no fancy parameter to choose tables or schemas,
nor return anything usefull (only notices).

Use it with a simple
SELECT create_missing_spatial_indexes();

I have improved my function.

Now it returns a table containing the schema, table name and column name.
You need to use it with
SELECT * FROM create_missing_spatial_indexes();

If you would like to only get the informations about missing indexes, there
is a new "simulate" parameter.
SELECT * FROM create_missing_spatial_indexes(True);

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python27 still main version in Osgeo4W Shell?
	(QGIS 2.99)
Message-ID: <23DC76E788B5AE46BF97C68F781B7C2522CF70C0@OVEKBG.ove.at>

Hi folks!

I have a question regarding the Python version in QGIS 3.
I installed the latest nightly build of Qgis 2.99 on Windows 64bit and wanted to start porting self-written QGIS 2 plugins to be QGIS 3 compatible!

My approach would have been to redo the conversion steps with pyuic5 and pyrcc5 (for PyQt5) and then correcting for removed classes.

Now I faced quite exactly the same problem as here:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/260743/how-to-compile-qtdesigner-user-interface-ui-and-resource-qrc-files-with-qg
though, I was not yet successful to get the suggested solution to work, because it is really painful on windows with environment variables. And since I have another independent Python installed, this sometimes becomes a big mess. [Side note: because of that very reason, I will go for NixOS very soon]

So my questions now are:

*) Do you think, that being unable to run pyrcc5.bat properly is caused by the fact that it is searching for Python27 instead of Python36? And as soon as I change the etc\ini\python-core.bat to point to Python36 instead, there seem to be problems with the PATH / PYTHONPATH environment varibles.

*) What is Python27 doing there in first place? Because from my understanding, one major change in QGis3 is to step from 2.7 to 3.6, removing 2.7 completely. Or why is it still there?

The reason of the quite vague formulation of my question might be, that I am not sure, whether the problem caused by me (w.r.t. the environment variables PATH/PYTHONPATH, which is usually the solution to problems with import errors of dlls, modules, etc. under Win) or is it still some early version issue of the Win-Version of QGis 2.99, as Python 2.7 seems still to be there? Or is it a mixture of both? About 15-20 hours of online research have contributed rather to my confusion than to insight :)

If anyone happens to have had similar issues with developing for QGis3 (2.99) on Win + working solutions (e.g. hints regarding the system setup when multiple QGis versions are installed and maybe even another independent Python36 exists), I would really appreciate some help.

Thank you all in advance and best regards,
Hannes

Nice contribution, MichaÃ«l! Tested and approved :-)

We might use this query to offer the option "Check missing spatial
indexes" in DB Manager, with an additional checkbox to "Add missing
indexes". Initially just for the Postgis provider, but it can be
implemented for other providers.

What do you think?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python and ExpressionContext question
Message-ID: <09358187d3b306f75e8b7cea507e80b4@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am trying to evaluate an expression on a selected feature in my Python
code. 

Here is my code: 

----------------- 

selFeature = selectedFeatures[0]
context = QgsExpressionContext()
scope = QgsExpressionContextScope()
scope.setFeature(selFeature)
context.appendScope(scope)
exp = QgsExpression('represent_value(routenr)')
routenNameNr = exp.evaluate(context) 

------------------ 

The code above works fine for a "normal" expression, like e.g.
"$length", but it fails for "represent_value(fieldname)". I guess this
is because represent_value involves another layer (relation reference
widget). How could I enhance my code so that
"represent_value(fieldname)" would also work? 

Thanks a lot for your hints! 

Andreas

I dont get the specific errors you list above, but I have the same issue you have when trying to run a grass algâ¦.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 2.99 nightly: profiles folder location
Message-ID: <CAChuB-Ztodpc2VPvo97-CBUVuGidOoFde4xxmSHMEEw4ViPAYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

first post of mine, am a software support engineer without much QGIS
knowhow but "figure-it-out" drive. Here I have:


1) some kind of a bug report
2) request for guidance


ad 1)

I have installed (and updated) the nightly build on a clean Ubuntu 16.04
(container with systemd-nspawn) with these apt sources:
$  cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.list
deb http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly xenial main
deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-nightly xenial main
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu xenial main


I get this debug message for a simple PyQGIS script:
../../src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp: 924: (getRecord) [6ms]
user qgis.db not found

Not being familiar with the QGIS codebase it seems to me that there are two
competing settings:

- qgisSettingsDirPath() gives me '/home/user/.local/share/profiles/default'
- but https://qgis.org/api/qgsapplication_8cpp_source.html#l00127 checks
for the environment variable (which is empty on my system) and falls back
to which is accorrding to http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html
 "~/.local/share/<APPNAME>", "/usr/local/share/<APPNAME>",
"/usr/share/<APPNAME>"

Indeed I have a qgis.db in  /home/user/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default
and if I create via the GUI "Settings > Profile > New profile" another one
it shows up in /home/user/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/ .

This is is clearly different from what qgisSettingsDirPath() returns.


PyQGIS code to reproduce the debug message "user qgis.db not found":
In [1]: from qgis.core import *
In [2]: crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
In [3]: crs.createFromProj4("+proj=ortho +lat_0=20 +lon_0=20 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+a=6370997 +b=6370997 +units=m +no_defs")
../../src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp: 883: (getRecord) [0ms]
failed : /resources/srs.db does not exist!
../../src/core/qgscoordinatereferencesystem.cpp: 883: (getRecord) [0ms]
failed : /resources/srs.db does not exist!
Out[3]: True



ad 2)
Not sure if the above warrants a bug report, or if it is a package problem
of the xenial ubuntugis-nightly packages. So:

I am looking for guidance in my quest to contribute to the PyQGIS docs.
Being new to QGIS (I need maps for a mobile app of mine) I would appreciate
if someone experienced could guide me.

Right now I am
a) learning PyQGIS
b) documenting working examples as Python unittest modules in
https://github.com/cprior/sunlightmap/tree/master/application/physical/GIS/
qgis3-tests
(whole repo under MIT, so no effort would be "lost")

Started to poke around on https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/87254/cprior but
I would be glad to have a speedier onboarding process than looking at
"badges earned"... ;)

I am willing to spend an hour each weekday for 4-6 weeks and think I could
contribute something helpful to the PyQGIS docs.


BR,
Christian Prior-Mamulyan

Yes this looks like a bug to me.  I will take a look.

Hi Jorge

This feature would be good to have in the DB manager, but I do not think we
should create a function in any database without warning the user.

Inside QGIS, we should be less intrusive and only run the SELECT SQL inside
the function to get all missing indexes, show them in a QGIS table view
with checkboxes, and a button to create selected indexes.
I could propose a PR for this if I find time (heavy workload this end of
year...)

Regards
MichaÃ«l

Good morning MichaÃ«l, LoÃ¯c,

Add PostGIS Table(s) dialogue already shows our spatial enabled tables.

We might just add another column to show if that geometry column is
already indexed or not. We can add another action button to create it,
enabled if missing.

I've added a very simple mockup in this gist [1].

This approach is more simple to implement, I think. It can be applied to
other providers as well.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Like the answer says (although with more words).  You need to run py3_env.bat
if you want python3 and qt5_env.bat if you want Qt5 - o4w_env.bat is not enough
(that's also what qgis-dev.bat and python-qgis-dev.bat do).

Because OSGeo4W has QGIS 2.14, 2.18 and master - GRASS also AFAIK still needs
python2 (the OSGeo4W packages certainly do).  If you leave out GRASS and QGIS
2.14 and 2.18 it probably won't install python2 - but you'll still need to run
the batch files to set the environment up.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Developing a plugin and a Python library at the
	same time
Message-ID: <CAP=p+YtJBFonqNkztyehHMF6d62TBSv-YBKdw4e0-NGddRCxWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello developers,

   This question might not be exactly for this forum (maybe
StackOverflow!?!), but since I am doing the development for QGIS, I guess
it makes sense being here.

Some background:

   A while ago, I started developing AequilibraE, which is a plugin for
transportation modelers/forecasters (plus some additional GIS tools that
help in that type of work).

As time progressed, I have re-factored all the GUI to work on a threaded
fashion when running algorithms and have worked on releasing the GIL for
the transportation-specific algorithms, which allows me to multi-thread the
procedures.

I have also worked quite a bit on the underlying library that contains the
transportation-specific procedures, which allows people to just integrate
those procedures in other workflows.

Lastly, I have started developing a large number of unittests for that
underlying library

The problem:

   I want to use the same (multi-threaded) API calls I provide for the
Python users through the underlying library in the GUI, so I don't have to
duplicate the same threading procedure, but at the same time I do want to
keep the GUI being updated.

Has somebody worked on a problem like this?  I would really appreciate some
reference I could study from, as I have not found a good solution for this
problem yet.

Cheers,
Pedro

recently Nyall started to move (in 3.x) some Processing base GUI
classes to C++ to avoid GUI lock in case of MT context when the Python
interpreter is locked... check this PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5761
fits your problem... as far as I understood.

Hi Luigi,
                My problem goes a little beyond that, as I want to have the
underlying API call capable of updating my GUI, while also able to run from
a Python shell outside QGIS (and with possibly no PyQt installed).

Cheers,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Backporting crash handler into 2.18
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_s+ics7jBAqYyUm7MKrZzqy+m8UAneKSwdoxeDEWxr3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just wanted to see how everyone would feel if I was thinking about
backporting the crash handler we have in QGIS 3 back into 2.18.

Given a lot of people will be running 2.18 for a long time and we want to
continue to make it a stable release I thought this might help to aid in
that.  So far the crash handler in 3 has helped quite a lot already from
what I have seen to track down crashes so I think having it in 2.18 would
be a big benefit.

I'm ok if people are a -1 on this but keen to get thoughts and if it's
generally something people are happy to have done I will get it sorted.

I will also open a QEP on it so there are notes on implementation in both
versions (although the code should be the same really)

Regards,
Nathan

I think it is a good idea...

As you say, 2.18 will be here for some time (especially for educational
and governmental institutions probably, all running windows).
Indeed then people can at least report back something (as I think our
normal stacktrace-sources: Linux devs, will probably move on to 3.x).

While it looks like if we want to say that QGIS ever crashes on Windows,
maybe name it Windows or Data Crash Handler  ;-) ....

Needs to be tested thoroughly though, as it is a new 'feature' in LTR...
Is it testable?

Regards,

Richard

Hi

A huge +1 from me - as a Windows user, it's frustrating not to be able to
investigate the occasional times PyQGIS causes a Windows minidump.

This is certainly true and a clear justification for the backport. Those
enterprises may keep using QGIS 2.18, possibly up to a year from now (with
respect to next LTR release and adoption), or longer. Horrifying to
consider, but at least this crash handler will help.

Hi Gary,

Which CMake version are you using? There is a flaw with CMake 3.9.0 thru
3.9.3 that affects automoc targets, which gave me similar errors:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17278

Works for me with CMake 3.9.4+, using Homebrew dependencies.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New QGIS user groups registered in 2017?
Message-ID: <FE50A3E6-C39F-4A7E-B5A3-413844E9EE51@qgis.org>

Hi all

Have you started a country level QGIS user group in the last year? I will shortly be putting out a call for nominations for new voting members and we need to know about any new user groups that were formed in this year as under our governance system we appoint a voting member from the community for every country user group representative. This process is explained somewhat in this older blog post:

http://blog.qgis.org/2016/05/04/call-for-nominations-for-voting-members-of-the-qgis-org-board/

If you have registered a new country group, please forward me details of:

* The country your user group represents
* The URL for your country user groupâs web site
* The name of your country user groupâs representative
* The email address of your country user groupâs representative

Currently I am aware of the new groups created for Norway, South Africa, France, Sweden and Georgia.

Thank you

Regards

I currently use 2.18 to work around some bugs in 3.0, and it is possible 
even with the difference in project file formats as there is enough 
compatibility. Although lately the CRS translation has been broken when 
opening a 3.0 project in 2.18 and I have been told there is no 
guaranteed backwards compatibility.

Personally I would advocate for engineering a little bit of backporting 
into 2.18 to allow it to recognise the CRS from the project file which 
is currently challenging, as it seems to be able to recognise everything 
else well enough to be able to view a map on opening the project file 
and I have done this many times while running the development masters on 
my live maps during the past year or so.

The main thing that is not translated is layer styles and whilst this is 
a big part at the moment I can work around that well enough to not make 
a big issue out of that which would probably be a much more significant 
effort to backport.

As it stands, 2.18 will be maintained as the last version LTR for many 
years yet until 3.2 is released and we haven't even got to 3.0 yet. In 
fact I do have some doubt that the 3.0 release date is going to be met 
(but of course I have no real insight into the process so it is just an 
informed opinion at best)

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G6Zs8Bfvjho7HWC97DuMuBugdXScCZUkZAQNiMkXkcNg@mail.gmail.com>

I was trying to test the new 3D functionalities, and I realized that I
haven't been building QGIS master with 3D on.

I have tried turning it on, but the configuration starts complaining about
Qt53DCore.

Do I have to install something that is not listed in the INSTALL file?

Thanks,

Hi Alexandre,
some information at
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2017/08/06/qgis3d-build/

The INSTALL file might need to be updated...

Hi Alexandre,

I'm very interested in this issue. I think that the problem is related
to the missing correct version of Qt 5.9.1 in Ubuntu system (are you on
a Ubuntu machine?).

In my machine (Mint 18) the default version of Qt is 5.5.1. Would be
great to know is there are some plans to update the Qt5 version in the
default Ubuntu repository.

Cheers

Matteo

If you use Mint it is based on the LTR version of Ubuntu. Currently this 
is Ubuntu 16.04 and so suffers from the same problem of out of date 
libraries as people using Ubuntu 16.04 natively get.

In this case you need to use the ubuntugis build of Qgis, however you 
may run into problems with the LTR version of Qgis (2.18) when using the 
ubuntugis repository as they are updated out of sync with each other. 
However using a nightly build shouldn't have issues with ubuntugis.

Hi Patrick,

thanks for the clarification. Actually I don't have any external
repository activated because I'm building QGIS from scratch and I never
had to add external sources.

Eventually, by activating the nightly repository Qt should be upgradable
to the last version required for 3D?

Thanks a lot

Matteo

Is there a way to erase all messages from a Log Messages Panel? I tried 
closing it, but when it reopens with a new message, all old ones are 
still visible.

Also, a little 'clear' button would be nice, maybe in a right click on

Ubuntugis is needed to ensure all the dependencies are met for all 
versions of Ubuntu up to and including 16.04. For later versions it is 
not required.

So I believe it should have the files needed to build a version of the 
development master.

However please be aware that Mint is not listed in the distros that are 
directly supported by the Qgis project (the ones that are listed on the 
downloads page). It is not beyond the possibility that a problem could 
occur if Mint uses different versions of packages than one of the 
supported distros uses, because this kind of variation is not unknown in 
derivative distros, compared to the experience when using the natively 
supported distro it is based on. I know for example the Gimp project has 
had problems like this with some distros using different versions of a 
key package than what the Gimp developers were expecting, causing 
unexpected behaviour with their software.

In other words because Mint is not Ubuntu but is only based on it, there 
could potentially be some unexpected issues building packages on it.

Best option is use a supported distro, perhaps running in a virtual 
machine if you don't have a computer running it.

It's a known issue that Ubuntu Xenial by itself does not include a 
required version of a key package that is needed by masters later than 
about January 2017. Attempting to build without this package will 
presumably fail. This is why Ubuntugis based versions of Qgis are needed 
to install on Xenial or supported earlier editions of Ubuntu.

However as per my other comment it is possible the Mint developers have 
updated this package in Mint. We have no way of predicting this without 
in depth knowledge of the distro.

Hi,
Maybe I miss something but I fail to fully understand the link between
Matteo needs and your explanation, Patrick. it doesn't look like Matteo has
issues to build QGIS. He already does it, he compiles from source himself (
master or any other branch).
What he wants is simply a way to build QGIS with 3D enabled, thing that by
default requires an upgraded version of QT (and not available in even known
and supported distro like Ubuntu 16.04). Unless I misunderstood...

Btw, which key package is missing in Xenial since january? I also do build
with Xenial and never felt that i'm missing some key features (except 3D
but i chose to not upgrade for that - worried to break a working
environment)

Matteo, have you seen the link I sent earlier (https://www.lutraconsulting.
co.uk/blog/2017/08/06/qgis3d-build/)? Looks like there's a way to have two
versions of qt and build different QGIS depending on what's enabled....

Oh it might be the prequisite packages for the build environment, these 
usually are the ones that are listed in the INSTALL file.

that's exactly the point. I don't have any problem to build QGIS master
(and other versions).

yep I saw the link (actually also when Martin posted it a few months ago
;) ). Ok, then if this is currently the only way to have 3D enabled I'll
try to do that, hoping to not breaking some Qt or other stuff..

Thanks!

Hi Gary,

Upon a clean build with CMake 3.10.0 (latest in Homebrew since end of
November), I get the same error as you reported. I did the following to get
back to a working compilation toolchain (assuming you are using CMake from
Homebrew):

brew rm -f cmake

# the following is CMake at 3.9.6, with available 'bottled' binaries, i.e.
no need to build from source:
brew install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/33ed355cfc5ae6c64bb70f80b74876b58d6d413a/Formula/cmake.rb

# this brings 3.10.0 in again
brew upgrade cmake

This leaves you with 3.10.0 'cmake' utility discoverable on PATH (assuming
/usr/local/bin is on PATH) and 3.9.6 available from:
/usr/local/Cellar/cmake/3.9.6/bin/cmake

You can use `brew switch cmake 3.9.6` if you want 3.9.6 on PATH. I didn't
do that, but instead created a new CMake configuration in Qt Creator
(assuming you are using that) and applied it to the kit I am using to build
QGIS 3.

I reported upstream at CMake that this issue has returned:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17278

Hi

We donât have and +1 to see it added some time - I also some times wish for thisâ¦

Another big +1 from me. The log is hard to read as it is, so clearing before
an expected message would help a great deal.

Thanks

You can close any tab - except for the last left - and it'll reappear clean
once another message arrives.

Closing the last would leave the widget in an unusable state - maybe instead of
preventing to close the last, we should make close clean it.

I can confirm. If I close one tab, it will come back empty when new
messages are coming.

Morning all
I have to migrate my plugin to the new processing API, and I'm having
difficulty understanding some errors during the process. Does someone have a
simple example of adding a provider and algorithm with the new API? For what
it's worth, the current error is:
Traceback (most recent call last):  File

Ah, thanks Jurgen! I thought I found the opposite yesterday..

Still a clear button would be cooler, but I can live with workaround. :)

Thank you all,

Dear Devs,

With QGIS 3D is becoming more and more stable and usable, do you think it
is a sensible idea to remove the Globe plugin from the core?

I remember a discussion earlier this year about reducing the number of core
plugins.

Regards
Saber

Hi Tom,

thanks to Nyall I made some experiment with DataPlotly plugin. You can
have a look at the code here:

https://github.com/ghtmtt/DataPlotly/tree/processing

and especially here:

https://github.com/ghtmtt/DataPlotly/tree/processing/dataplotly_processing

Hoping this helps!

Cheers

Hi! Sorry if I'm late to the party but I've regularly been able to build
2.99 with 3D support using the instructions from (a)
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL supplemented by (b)
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2017/08/06/qgis3d-build/ on my
Xubuntu 16.04 machine. I didn't encounter any problems with building Qt5.9,
Qwt, etc though.

The only problem/issue I've had was that plugins are unavailable when
running the built QGIS. The Settings tab of "Manage and Install Plugins"
says "No Python support detected thus no settings available." I don't know
if that's normal because I've only tried building QGIS recently. If you're
able to build with 3D support or if you know whether this is normal, maybe
you can also help a brother out.

Thanks!

directories: one for Qt 5.x (comes with your system) and one for Qt 5.9.

Regards
Saber

Did you also build PyQt for the custom installed Qt 5.9?

I haven't done this yet. Will try it. Thanks! I do hope this is just a
problem with my system or some lacking dependency that I don't know of,
it'd be a bit of a hassle to have multiple build directories just to test
3D and then other stuff.


 @Matthias

Did you also build PyQt for the custom installed Qt 5.9?


I don't remember doing so. Should I build it myself or will installing it
via pip suffice? I'm thinking if I can build using a virtual env with all
the python dependencies installed there. Thanks!

Hi Matteo,

The DataPlotly plugin is really cool. It is one outstanding plugin and a 
very welcome extension to the QGIS/FOSSGIS eco system.

It is cool that you explore the combination with processing models.

Question: do you plan integration with the new layouts, once the work 
from Nyall is stable? I guess many people would like to include these 
charts in their layouts!

I know, it is possible to save out the result to a file and then load it 
in a HTML frame - but a more direct approach in the future would be 
desirable, without the need to save everything to intermediate files - 
perhaps something with an integrated local web server on some special port?

I know it is a bit early to discuss, because Nyalls layout work is still 
in the flux - but it would be interesting!

Greetings,
Andreas

I remember seeing pyqt in pypi, but I think this ships with yet another
set of Qt libraries (besides the system and the ones from the SDK), so
I'm not sure about the compatibility.

It might be easiest to switch to a distro, where everything is available
out of the box already.
If you want to give it a try, I once wrote some scripts that compiles
all the dependencies on a really old system, which you can use for reference

Message-ID: <DC8D7258-A31A-469A-B4B3-6639651D5E82@macports.org>

Guys,

sorry to butt in this list, but I was officially invited to by Giovanni Manghi (yeah, Iâm a snitch. Boo!).

Anyways, here is my riddle:

Iâve written a Portfile to plug QGIS3 into the Portfile packaging system for OS X.

Fine. It builds and works, even the 3D!

Big self-satisfaction spreeâ¦

â¦except that I canât get any Python support. The Plug-in dialogue reports âno Python support foundâ despite setting PYTHON_EXECUTABLE to a correct value (/opt/local/bin/python3.6).

As it seems to be an isolated case (though everyone who uses MacPorts does report the same problem), does anyone know where I should poke my nose to try and find whatâs wrong?

Thanks a bunch!

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

Welcome!

Some other CMake variables to check

- WITH_BINDINGS

- PYTHON_LIBRARY

... and check if pyqt development libraries are available

Good luck!

Matthias

Another way to try QGIS 3D:

docker run --rm -ti -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} -v
/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v ${HOME}:${HOME}
camptocamp/qgis-server:3 /usr/local/bin/start-client.sh

You can add "--add-host osm.tatras:172.18.0.1" to create an host to your
local system or so.

Y.

Coming back to your question, Saber... It's no pleasure to drop stuff someone

Is anybody here using Globe at all?

Matthias,

Okay, Iâve got Python plugged in now.

However, the compilation fails because sip-3.6 lacks a -I spec in command line (it doesnât find the PyQt5 modules).

Is there a way to specify it as a cmake parameter or do I have to patch the CMakeLists.txt?

Vielen Dank im voraus!

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

are you sure sip-3.6 is the version? sip-4.0 was released in 2004 and we
are now at 4.19.6.

Yeah, I mean, on Macports, you can have more than one Python version installed, so everything get tagged according to the Python version itâs attached to. sip-3.6 simply means that itâs the sip version that runs with Python 3.6

Air > sip-3.6 -V
4.19.6

But I think I figured it out: PYQT5_SIP_DIR. Trying now to recompile.

Danke sehr fÃ¼r deine schnelle Antwort!

Matthias,

okay seems to be a bug in Macports. Sipconfig returns a wrong default path, and thus compilation fails.

Sorry for the noise,

Viel SpaÃ!

Message-ID: <46aedbc3-65d0-1b9d-a026-37018cd96e74@opengis.ch>

Hi all,

QGIS suppors querying features from a WMS. Among the supported response
formats is JSON.

The current code is based on QScript, which is deprecated.

I've written some code that removes this dependency, so we can stick to
maintained Qt code and can remove a dependency from QGIS.

Now the state is as follows, the code is written, but I couldn't test it
because I don't know a WMS server with this behavior.

If someone could point me towards a server that responds with JSON
formatted feature information, I can make sure, the new code behaves the
way it should.

If not, I'll just keep the old code around on any system that has
QScript available (which should be almost any system out there) and only
resort to the untested code when QScript is not available in the build
environment.

Thanks a lot in advance

Matthias

Message-ID: <9AC477C1-B911-4C46-B845-5AAE394D8673@macports.org>

Hey guys,

Iâm not sure this has been brought up yet, so here it is:

The fix #11399 doesnât seem to work on OS X 10.13 anymore or needs further patching:

qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:948:11: error: use of undeclared identifier 'kCFAllocatorDefault'
         kCFAllocatorDefault,
         ^
qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:950:11: error: use of undeclared identifier 'kCFStringEncodingUTF8'
         kCFStringEncodingUTF8
         ^

         kCFAllocatorDefault,
         ^

         kCFURLPOSIXPathStyle,
         ^
qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:962:11: error: use of undeclared identifier 'kCFAllocatorDefault'
         kCFAllocatorDefault,
         ^
qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:968:22: error: unknown type name 'CFIndex'
       static const CFIndex maxAbsPathCStrBufLen = 4096;
                    ^
qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:973:33: error: unknown type name 'UInt8'
              reinterpret_cast<UInt8 *>( &absPathCStr[0] ),
                               ^
qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:980:7: error: use of undeclared identifier 'CFRelease'
     CFRelease( relCFURL );
     ^

Also I get this error, in the same file, later:

qgslayoutdesignerdialog.cpp:1263:3: error: use of undeclared identifier 'mQgis'
 mQgis->activateWindow();
 ^


If I disable these patches for MacOS (#if 0 â¦) the build works, of course. Since the first patch is supposed to target a Qt4 bug, can it be safely disabled when linking against Qt5?

Thanks,
Vincent

The patch has been added this week according to git blame (maybe a
copy/paste)
In the QT issue tracker, they said the issue has been fixed in Qt 5.4.1
only https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40449 so we might keep this code.

I made a PR already in QGIS: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5822

Swell. Since MacPorts runs with Qt 5.9, this is fine for me to comment out. Thanks for your input.

A finer approach in the code would be to enable/disable the patch according to the Qt version QGis gets compiled with, but Iâm still skeptical the patch would compile with, say Qt 5.3 on OS X 10.13 (has Core Foundation API been changed?).

Bonne soirÃ©e et merci !

Hi Nathan

Though QGIS 2.x is end of life soon, can you publish the plugin now
with Simran's fancy new functions (as documented here
https://github.com/NathanW2/qgsexpressionsplus )?

Hi !

I think the migration should be optional (eg. by displaying a message on
first start if there's a QGIS2 conf). I'd say this is what most programs do
for major updates. This would allow users who are a bit messy (like me) to
take advantage of QGIS3 to make a clean start.

Also, you'd be able to easily reset to factory settings by wiping the whole
QGIS3 directory (actually it's by trying to do that and not understanding
why the browser kept my providers that I learned that config was migrated).

What do you think ? Should I open a feature request ?

Still the feature will definitely be very useful for most users ! Thank you
very much for developing it :)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Qt 5.10 for QGIS devs - the short story
Message-ID: <CAB28AshVVasXsUYqoRnQrgu6_AWZfSfeMoPNSOGHcFWxXj9DYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

Can't be bothered reading the full changelog of Qt 5.10 which was
released today??! No problem!! Here's the 2 second rundown on changes
which are relevant to us:

- The new QStringView class: cool stuff, but it's no use to us until
we require >= 5.10 and it works correctly with the sip bindings. Let's
revisit in 10 years when debian gets updated.

- QRandomGenerator: useful for us. Maybe we can #ifdef this in for our
various random number generation routines (like in expression
functions) to get better quality random numbers, falling back to the
current routines for < 5.10

- "QImages can now use more than 2GByte of pixel data.". This could
potentially be very good for us, but I can't find any info on whether
the pixel dimension limits have also been lifted (these are what's
blocking us from higher-res/larger composer/map exports).

- "Added AA_DisableWindowContextHelpButton attribute that prevents the
automatic" What's this" button on dialogs on Windows". Woohoo! I
remember discussing somewhere (Nodebo?) about how we could get rid of
all these useless "what's this" buttons on windows dialogs which give
no useful information at all. At the time there wasn't a solution.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/15e7d57f adds support for this,
but requires Qt 5.10 windows builds.

- "QDockWidget acquired the ability to be dropped together side by
side". Sounds like a nice little UI benefit we get for free after
moving to 5.10 builds. I'm not sure how useful it will be for QGIS in
practice (I think most users would tend to want less docks visible at
once and more room for the actual map), but it's a nice option to have
available given that it takes no effort on our behalf.

- QtQuick/QML changes: meh. I'll let Matthias get excited about those.
I'm just glad that for once there's a Qt release that includes changes
outside of these modules...

- Qt3D changes: looks like some good stuff here, now that it's of use to us!

Mmmm... I'd honestly hope that we don't have that reaction when
dropping code. Every contribution shapes the future codebase, so all
the work done in globe has helped set the direction and framework for
the new 3d stuff. Code churn is natural in a project of this size, and
doesn't reflect lack of value in anyone's past contributions.

> Is anybody here using Globe at all?

I don't -- purely because the build dependencies have never been
satisfied on my OS of choice. However - I don't think removing it is
an option until we have feature parity here, and I'd be reluctant to
remove it even then before having the Qt based 3d stuff exposed to the
wider testing of being included in a stable release.

Martin - do you have a checklist of features in globe which still
require porting to QGIS 3d?

Add to that

with the new profiles it's super-easy to get a clean slate any time.

It is great to see there is constantly so much work going into Qt
Quick - hopefully at some point soon we will be able to use it for
QGIS desktop as well where it is appropriate - e.g. welcome page or
plugin manager.


> - Qt3D changes: looks like some good stuff here, now that it's of use to us!

Oh yeah, plenty of new stuff and they are also moving the focus on
making the framework even faster and more robust! For the time being
even 5.9 brought plenty of goodies that we can try to integrate:
https://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/05/24/qt3d/


Another exciting thing on the list of 5.10 features is the technical
preview of "Qt WebGL Streaming Plugin" - a way to stream applications
to browsers over network - QGIS in the cloud!

Cheers

Hi all,

QGIS suppors querying features from a WMS. Among the supported response formats is JSON.

The current code is based on QScript, which is deprecated.

I've written some code that removes this dependency, so we can stick to maintained Qt code and can remove a dependency from QGIS.

Now the state is as follows, the code is written, but I couldn't test it because I don't know a WMS server with this behavior.

If someone could point me towards a server that responds with JSON formatted feature information, I can make sure, the new code behaves the way it should.

If not, I'll just keep the old code around on any system that has QScript available (which should be almost any system out there) and only resort to the untested code when QScript is not available in the build environment.

Thanks a lot in advance

Matthias

There is a bunch of features not supported by QGIS 3D compared to the
globe plugin - from the top of my head:
- "globe" world view in addition to having a "local" 3D scene
- integration of a data provider for terrain data (e.g. [1])
- lights / skybox configuration
- stereo mode

Some users may consider some of the features above critical, while
others may easily live without them, depending on their use case. I
agree with Nyall we should not remove the plugin until we get close to
feature parity (but not necessarily 100% parity). Since the globe
plugin is not a part of the public API, I think currently we do not
need to push towards its removal for 3.0 (unless we wanted to get rid
of the dependencies it adds).

I would like to start a crowd-funding sometime soon to further improve
QGIS 3D, so I would be also interested to hear some feedback from
others who have already played with QGIS 3D to understand what
functionality they would like to see added next and what are the
biggest shortcomings right now.

Cheers
Martin

"qgis3" is not distributable because its license "gpl" conflicts with license "OpenSSL" of dependency Â« openssl"



Besides, when I try and turn on the server option, I get a slew of linking errors caused by âlibdummy.soâ. What gives?

â

Could not open /Applications/MacPorts/Qgis3.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/qgis/server/../../Frameworks/qgis_native.framework/qgis_native: Error opening or reading file (referenced from /Applications/MacPorts/Qgis3.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/qgis/server/libdummy.so)

Can I delete that libdummy.so before packaging the software?

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)

Thanks a bunch and cheers!
Vincent

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qgis-ltr-bin.exe has stopped working
Message-ID: <a6e845e6fdec489ba88b49c8ce88f66e@ble.de>

Dear QGIS collegues,

after a few days of installing the version QGIS 2.14.19, whenever I use the properties of a layer (Right click on the layer and select Properties), an error appears as you can see attached (qgis-ltr-bin.exe has stopped working).
I did some research but... no results! I also uninstalled QGIS and reinstalled...

Suggestions?
Thank you very much!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Custom CRS parameters plugin
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpKBx27LUK1sUNuMeJ0jdB2DHexrj_u4g6nNYQj6Y2xkg@mail.gmail.com>

I have an organization request for a  dialog box that edits custom CRS
properties without using the Proj4 text string. Some users are
uncomfortable with defining a Proj4 text string. Basically what they want
is an ArcMap equivalent of the "Data Frame Properties->Coordinate System,"
"New Projected Coordinate System" dialog.

As far as I can tell this is not a part of QGIS nor in any of the plugins.
Am I missing this capability in QGIS, is anyone working on it, or should I
consider creating a plugin to do this?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi

As far as I know, nobody is working on this - It sounds like a very good core feature for QGIS.

Regards

Yes, that would be great. I could already now imagine we can do welcome
page and settings migration with Quick Controls, is there something in
particular that prevents us from doing this (apart from the usual human
resources to spend on ;) )?

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjuijoToTp6EwjhNykQ06JOog4aGMFtW05esBwQy7C38w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm testing the 3D view for PostGIS 3D gemetries. I create a cube using

  'POLYHEDRALSURFACE Z (    ((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 0 0)),
((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 0 0 1, 0 0 0)),    ((0 0 0, 1 0 0, 1 0 1, 0 0
1, 0 0 0)),    ((1 1 1, 1 0 1, 0 0 1, 0 1 1, 1 1 1)),    ((1 1 1, 1 0
1, 1 0 0, 1 1 0, 1 1 1)),    ((1 1 1, 1 1 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 1 1 1))
)'::geometry,


but if I enable the 3D renderer, only the bottom and the top (the two
horizontal faces) are drawn. The vertical faces are invisible.

Should I be creating the cube in some other way? Or is this an issue with
the rendering?

Regards,
Anita

Hi Anita,

Have you tried changing the "Culling" settings in the 3D rendering 
properties of the layer

It might solve your issue. Some systems use clockwise, some 
counter-clockwise ordering of vertices describing a face. For that 
reason you can change the culling setting per layer.

It is, however, a relatively new enhancement and may not be available in 
your build, if it is several days old.

Greetings,

Andreas

How old is your QGIS build? At some point I have managed to break
display of vertical walls in 3D view [1] and only fixed it several
days ago, so maybe you are using one of the broken builds?

I guess nothing more :) Actually I started working on QtQuick-based manager 
before the Brighton Hackfest, but it was too early to introduce Qt 4.7 
dependency. Next year I'm going to give it as second try :)

Hi All,

Just to throw my hat in the ring. I am very excited about the 3D pathway QGIS is embarking on and I am happy to support crowdfunding and provide code. I have written QT and GL enabled applications in openscenegraph for work purposes with OSGB outputs from our 3D city models. If anyone can see how to integrate this I would like to add OSGB/OpenScenegraph support in the 3D view.

Here is the manual showing some basic capabilities: https://aerometrex-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tisham_dhar_aerometrex_com_au/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=081dcdd99f7ca41f7947d097a30260d99&authkey=Af4G9PptUSzf2wwbgeajK64&e=43367f9bd64d4cc1a450f2d11416b922

OK, I'll admit I was a bit hasty here :) I'm just jaded as I'm sick of
reading about long standing critical bugs in Qt core modules, of which
Qt's only response is "this module is unmaintained".

Unfortunately it's QtQuick only - so basically no use for us for now.

Last month I did an osgeo.nl presentation "QGIS behind the scenes" to 
show people how the organisation is set up and how they can (and 
should!) help.

I would not mind giving it at Madeira as an introduction to our new 
attendants.

It is here (in dutch):

Well just for the record, the QGIS Globe plugin is actually based on 
osgEarth, which is built on OpenSceneGraph. So there it should be fairly 
easy to integrate.

Hi Ben

The blog post https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/
2017/08/06/qgis3d-build/  uses CMake flag `-DWITH_BINDINGS=FALSE \`. If you
want to have python bindings/plugins, turn it on.

I remember bumping into an error when I turned that option on last time.
Will try again. Thanks!

Thanks also for your awesome work with QGIS 3D, I used it in one my
research projects in grad school this semester and people have been
pleasantly surprised that I could do 3D with Q. I'm doing my best to get
more people here to use Q and showcasing the new features in the upcoming
QGIS 3 release (like 3D support) is one of the ways I thought of.

Cheers!

Message-ID: <677e05cd-1edc-d9cb-3092-5da008402520@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

see: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17667

QGIS is loading
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/nohelp.html
from it's install dir if not help is found (I'm also trying to fix
current problem that master does not find the pages...).

BUT the nohelp.html is plain html, which to my googling-knowledge cannot
be used as source file for lupdate (to generate translatable strings in
our qgis.ts file).

So question: is there a way to not use this html file, but maybe
generate a translatable(!) html file in the code. Or maybe use the html
as some template in which QGIS itself 'injects' those (then)
translateble strings?

Any pointers?
I hope this is possible without too much magic :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <c7de65d9a73618e5fb2b2b46b596b9ba@carto.net>

Hi, 

In QGIS master (version 3), with a Vector Layer input, I am failing to
find the option to run a processing model only on the selected features.


Can you please help me find the setting? I looked in the "Options" -->
"Settings" --> "Processing" or watched out for a checkbox in the "Run
model dialog" - but both did not show an option to restrict on selected
features only. 

Thanks for a hint, 

Andreas

The global use only selected features option is gone (yay) in favor of a
checkbox which can be activated on a per-use basis. I believe iterating
through selected features only requires a vector source input.

Hi Mathieu, 

Thanks for the information. Unfortunately I cannot use "Feature Source"
as an input in my model. 

Matthias told me that I have to use "Vector layer" as an input, because
my model relies on certain features that aren't available on "feature
source" inputs. I need to use refactor fields in a model with
expressions support for relation_aggregates and represent_value (which
requires information on widget configuration).  

Is there any chance this checkbox could also be introduced for "Vector
layer" inputs? Should I open an issue? 

------------------- 

I also find it quite confusing that the inputs come with zero
documentation. I think for probably 99% of the users who are not devs it
isn't obvious when to use which input. Could we introduce a very simple
tooltip that explains with 1 or 2 sentences what the input implies -
esp. for the "Vector layer" vs. "Feature Source" vs. "Layer field" ? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi Mathieu, 

If I run "Save selected features" before the rest of my model I also
loose the whole context of widgets and relations, because it is a new
virgin layer then with no link to the original layer configuration
(widgets, relations) - right? 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Apply a preset (Layer Combination with style) in
	QGIS API
Message-ID: <CAGfc75maVHCvDwVzhG8LYYkh9bt2s0-yJ+z59+XfofZBWFnDAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a plugin that, amongst other things, generates maps
automatically.

I have two presets :
- one which is relative to the current map visualization, the standard one,
named "main"
- and another one, which is relative to the atlas generation, embedding the
styles of masks, named "atlas"

Each preset checks a different combination of layers.

The problem is that I don't really know which class to use : I noticed the
QgsVisibilityPresetCollection class and used the method
applyPresetCheckedLegendNodesToLayer(presetName, layerId), but it doesn't
affect the layer panel, nor the layer styles.

Here, I want to apply the "main" preset to a layer named Cities

layerName = 'Cities'
layer = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayersByName(layerName)[0]
QgsProject.instance().visibilityPresetCollection().applyPresetCheckedLegendNodesToLayer('main',
layer.id())


(Doesn't work)

Could you tell me how to achieve the preset selection ?

Any help would be appreciated,

Mathieu

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Madeira developer meeting room reservation
Message-ID: <CACfnYnTmr+OKdpvHBo2+UTMis1tTYud18Qkd=gxDgjWiN9+R0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi developers,

this is just a reminder that the accommodation reservation for the
developer meeting in Madeira is up to you.

I'm remembering it because in the participants lists

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingMadeira2018#register

there are a lot of "room" beside your name, but no indication if you
already booked and in what hotel.

People does not have necessarily to stay at the "Hotel Four Views
Monumental" where the meeting will take place, but if you want to take
advantage of the special fares we have negotiated for the event be
sure make the reservation by email as stated here

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingMadeira2018#accommodation

In general try make your reservation asap (also for flights), Madeira
is a touristic place and "last minute" bookings can be more expensive.

I will soon add in the wiki page more accommodation alternatives
nearby the meeting venue.

I have also noticed that some of the developers that usually never
miss a meeting are not yet in the participants list, hope is just a
matter of time before seeing the name pop in the page! Let me know if
I can do anything for you.

with regards

Hi All,

Iâm interested in a way for our IT department to know when there have been
new point releases for Windows builds. e.g 2.18.X Can anyone provide advice?

Cheers,
Jeremy

Hi Jeremy,

Here are two channels:

https://twitter.com/JuergenEFischer

and https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/release-2_18 (watch out for 
Release xx messages).

In general, the dates are announced at 
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html?highlight=roadmap#release-schedule 
- except for 3.x releases where we still wait for some features to be 
added to the code base. Once 3.0 is released, JÃ¼rgen will also publish 
dates for the 3x point releases.

Hope this helps - or do you have a good suggestion for another channel?

Greetings,

Andreas

Andreas,

You could also use is_selected() it your refactor fields' expressions.

if( is_selected(), <new value>, <retain old value>)

And there is

which is the file which is picked up by QGIS itself to check if there is
a newer version.
The clue is
#QGIS Version 21815 in it
As soon as this is 21816 ... there is one new point release :-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] srs.db
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdyN=QunfiJ3h-80LyGCXgmh9ZARggAWXCuu_+Zbhk+Rw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs!

Today I have been helping a QGIS user with a strange reprojection
error with misaligned layers. It turned out that their proj4
definition for EPSG:27700 (British National Grid) was having wrong
"towgs84" parameter ([1] instead of [2]). The incorrect definition is
stored in the srs.db in the github sources, obviously it gets
corrected when crssync is run. In the Arch Linux build recipe it seems
that crssync is not being run at all. Now I am wondering:

1. is there any reason why we need to keep srs.db in the sources,
rather than generating it during the build?
2. if there is any reason for it, would it make sense to replace the
binary DB by a text files with SQL commands so it is possible to track
changes in it?
3. going even further, maybe we should not ship srs.db at all and
build it on the first run and store it in the user's profile? From
what I understand it is essentially a cache of GDAL's CRS database...

The mechanism for running crssync seems a bit fragile - it is run as a
dependency of a unit test, so if tests are not enabled, it won't be
run automatically... It would be great if we could simplify the CRS db
generation somehow (as said above, ideally move it out of the build
completely).

Cheers
Martin

Hi Martin

Just for info, there was an incorrect EPSG:27700 definition doing the rounds
a few years back. I don't know where it came from, but it was about 200m
out, as far as I could tell:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/WMS-layer-offset-200m-SW-of-true-location-td3790769.html

Thanks

There's more in the srs.db than crssync handles.  There may be entries, that
are not present in GDAL/PROJ.4 at all.  We only update where the two intersect
and even have means to avoid the update for some.

It's supposed to be run on install (and is in the debian and windows
packaging).

I agree that srs.db is not ideal and tracking changes is not nice (there are
quite a few commits that have the SQL for the change in the commit message).

Hi John

Note I switched your email thread over from the community list (which is used to manage documentation efforts) to the developer list (perhaps you might like to subscribe to it rather) which is a more appropriate audience.

I have used Whitebox in the past - its a nice app! Hopefully someone in the community will be interested to work with you to get your tools included in the processing framework - it would be a really nice addition!


Regards

Tim

I frequently get requests from users who want to access Whitebox GAT's plugin tools from outside of the software and to incorporate these tools into other geospatial projects.

This small library already contains about 250 tools for processing raster and LiDAR data sets (Whitebox GAT has about 450 tools--much work remains). I have developed WhiteboxTools using the Rust programming language, a low-level systems language that is efficient and safe (without use of garbage collection). The project uses a permissive MIT open-source license. I'm not sure if there is any interest in incorporating any or all of the tools contained in WhiteboxTools as a toolbox in QGIS, but I thought that I would make you aware of the possibility. I welcome any feedback or questions you may have.

Hi John,

sounds interesting and IMHO havig such tools in QGIS will be very useful
for users.
Now, with Processing framework it should be possible to integrate Whitebox
tools
into QGIS by developing provider plugin. I will try to find time and look
into it.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS nightly - snap shortcut
Message-ID: <1513152207775-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I have noticed, that snap default shortcut (Shift+Alt+S) works when I'm
editing attributes. 

It is problem with Polish letter "Å", because if you want to write "Å" you
have to combine keys Shift+Alt+S... and then you turn the snapping function
on...

My test was on virtual machine with Ubuntu 17.10 and nightly snapshot form
debian repo.


Best regards,
SÅawomir

Hi SÅawomir,

you can override the default QGIS keyboard shortcuts, see:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#keyboard-shortcuts

Note that with me the shortcut is a simple capital S.

I do not think we can make everybody happy with the chosen shortcuts :-)


Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi, thanks!

Yes, I know I can change default shortcut. But the problem is not the
shortcut - it is ok and it is great to turn on/off snap by shortcut. 

I see the problem, because this shortcut works when I'm editing attributes
in the dialog box after create a feature in text field. Is there any chance
to "repair" this?

In attribute table and expression fields "Å" works fine.


Regards, 
SÅawomir Bienias

It seems to be a bit more complicated...

Usually we can translate shortcuts in the PL translation, but this one seems 
to be generated automagically by QT - I can't find any place in the code where 
it could be defined. 

Does anybody know how it's being generated? Probably we should define it 
explicitly so we can translate it.

Borys

PS. As Richard said, it's listed as simple "s", so you can't use it when 
you're in any text edit widget. It seems the Shift+Alt+S is an alias for such 
situations - with inverted priority, what causes the problem. So the only fast 
fix is to change it to e.g. "p".

Hi Andreas,

yesterday on IRC strk had the same problem:

http://irclogs.geoapt.com/qgis/%23qgis.2017-12-12.log

something with different selfbuild GDAL's?

I've had the same problem yesterday, make sure to drop any gdal header
from older releases and re-install a clean GDAL from current trunk.

Just to expand on Sandro's answer: I've been implementing some changes
in upstream GDAL to allow us to remove some hardcoded format handling
in QGIS. These changes have been merged in gdal dev and will be
included in 2.3, but in meantime they have also been utilised in qgis
code for gdal >= 2.3 builds.

So basically you need to update to a newer svn build which includes
these latest changes (or use a stable gdal build, which will also
work, and just fall back to the hardcoded format handling).

Thanks John,
adding your toolbox to Processing seems a very good idea, and it should
be a reasonable task. One thing that would speed up and facilitate the
adoption, at least for Linux users, would be to have proper offical
packages for it. I'd be interested in helping with the Debian packaging.
All the best, and thanks for sharing.

Ah, found it! I'm changing it in the PL translation from S to P (so Shift+Alt
+P will also work), unless you have a better idea.

Please note nightly builds don't contain the recent translations, so it won't 
be effective before the release. Or...

@Werner, what about:
1. pulling recent string changes to Transifex (there are tons of them I guess)
2. pushing translations to master, so we all can enjoy and test them early.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3D: navigation questions
Message-ID: <251f1130-b299-2cbd-8ee7-cd482e4630a5@carto.net>

Hi,

I think I heard several people stating that the navigation in QGIS 3D is 
too fast. Nyall has a PR to slow down navigation when holding the 
Ctrl-key - which unfortunately hadn't been merged to master yet.

To me the question is: when the majority of users think that navigation 
is too fast, shouldn't the default already be slower?

Other navigation issues I have:

* I did not find a way to lower or raise the altitude of the "camera" 
while staying it the same positions and not changing all the viewing 
angles (like taking the helicopter up and down at the same position). Is 
there a hidden shortcut for that?

* When rotating the whole model (middle mouse button) - how can I 
determine the rotation point? What is the rule for rotating the whole model?

Is there any documentation somewhere about how the navigation should 
work? I read something about support for keyboard (arrow keys) - but if 
I use the arrow keys, only the main 2D canvas is panned, not the 3D 
view. Also the Shift key, which should be used according to 
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2017/10/16/buildings-in-qgis3d/ 
has no effect on my machine - maybe another KDE/Plasma issue?

Thanks for your reply.

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3D: looking below the terrain model
Message-ID: <cf73e64a-2a17-661b-4061-1f9b5f650416@carto.net>

Hi,

Being a caver, I have a lot of underground data. Thanks to the support 
from Martin I got them to load correctly as 3D polygondata.

However, one issue I have is that the terrain rendering disappears when 
I look below the terrain model surface - which isn't so nice for a caver 
or geologist. Is this also an issue about culling? Would it be possible 
to enable the rendering of the backside of the terrain surface?

The other issue I have is that tilting is somehow locked at the horizon. 
I can look down on the terrain and then rotate the whole model until I 
look sideway into the model, but than the rotation is blocked. I cannot 
rotate any further so that my camera gets below the surface and that I 
could move below the surface and look up towards the terrain. I guess 
this makes a lot of sense for people who do not need to explore things 
below the terrain surface, but for geologists or cavers, it would be 
great if this rotation/tilting blocking could be disabled somehow.

Thanks,

Andreas

I agree that this is desirable. Geotechs will also very quickly be
demanding this feature in order to visualise boreholes correctly!

I'd suggest this should be an option in the 3d view configuration. I
agree it's a valid use case, but for most users it may be unwanted.

Not that I can find, but we need this too. Maybe page up/page down could work?

I also think we need a way to modify the camera rotation without
altering its position. See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17653

I believe this is a bug on all platforms when the canvas is docked.
Try undocking it.

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for your feedback while testing the new processing modeler...
it's very valuable information!

I need to improve how this is exposed in the modeler, but the
difference between "Feature sources" and "vector layers" is that
feature sources are used wherever *features* from a layer are being
processed, vs "vector layer" parameters which are for processes which
alter the whole layer (e.g changing its style, adding a field in
place, deleting/renaming it, etc)

Accordingly, all algorithms which edit features should be made to work
fully with "feature sources". In this case, we need to fix the
refactor fields algorithm to handle the relation/represent value use
cases somehow. But the proper solution here isn't to require a vector
layer parameter.

(Note that ALL algorithms which use feature source parameters will
happily accept a vector layer parameter and operate on the all the
features in that layer... but that's just done to make the modeler as
flexible as possible).

I plan on renaming "Feature Source" -> "Vector layer features" in the
modeler to help clarify this (also "layer field" -> "vector layer
field"), and I'll add some tooltips too. (also sort that list)

> Is there any chance this checkbox could also be introduced for "Vector
> layer" inputs? Should I open an issue?

Based on the above - no. Vector Layer parameters operate on a whole
layer... so what would a "selected features" checkbox mean for an
algorithm like "rename layer"? Or for setting layer styles? It's just
opening up a can of worms....

Another (related) question. I've been thinking model input UI should
be reworked. My proposal:
- remove the list of input types
- change it to a dock with a list of inputs present in the current
model, with an "add" (and remove) button to add new inputs to the
model (at which point the input type selection will be asked)
- add up/down reordering controls for inputs (supported in the backed,
but in the frontend there's no way to set the ordering. Which is a
pain for making end-user usable models)

Thoughts?

Hi all,

Anyone know what changed on Travis yesterday? All of a sudden we're
seeing a shapefile test failing with no changes which account for
this.

Was there a GDAL library update applied?

Nyall,

I have had today issues on Travis GDAL too (new warnings popping up whereas the code was 
unchanged), and finally tracked that down to an upgrade of the Trusty image from clang 3.9 
to clang 5.0
But in the QGIS case, this is weird since according to the cmake report it seems to use a clang 
3.8 in both cases (probably coming from the docker image)

But this seems definitely correlated with the change of the Travis image since the last good 
build ( https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/315460942/log.txt ) is with the old image (with clang 
3.9), and the first bad one 
( https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/315604790/log.txt ) is with the new image (with clang 5.0)

I see they've pubished a blog post about the change:
https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-12-12-new-trusty-images-q4-launch
and the updated packages:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-environment-updates/2017-12-12/

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Improving usability of "Project Home" in browser?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshESAx2kRPU42TJaKdOZDEkP4TzLMJqnEQx8pQZPM0UBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm seeking ideas on how we can improve the usefulness of the "Project
Home" item in the browser panel.

Currently, this item is shown after opening a project, and consists of
a directory item showing the contents of the same folder in which the
.qgs project file is stored.

I really like the idea of this Project Home item, but I can't make use
of it because at none of my current workplaces are the .qgs project
files stored in the root directory of a project. A more common
structure is something like:

project_001\
project_001\incoming_data\
project_001\reports
project_001\outgoing
project_001\data
project_001\projects\my_qgis_file.qgs

In this case the shortcut to the .qgs folder doesn't help - because
none of the interesting stuff is located there. I suspect this isn't
an uncommon scenario, and that a lot of workplaces don't store .qgs
files in the root directory of projects.

Has anyone got any ideas of how we could improve the Project Home item
to meet this scenario? Best I can come up with is to add a new setting
(booo) in Project Properties to manually set the project home
folder...

(Note - In an ideal world, ALL file open/save dialogs would have a
shortcut to this project home folder available too. It's possible in
Windows (see e.g.
http://www.pbjzone.com/images/VS2010_open_dialog.png) - but not
exposed via Qt (yet) )

One option might be to scan all folders used in the profile file and add
each one to the project home folder so you have quick access to all folders
that are currently used.

I'm guessing you mean "scan all folders used in the project file". If
so, good idea! Unfortunately non-trivial... but something we
could/should do as a future enhancement to the Project Home item.

I also don't think it fully addresses my use case, since it would only
show utilised folders. So e.g. if I get new data and place it in a new
folder under "incoming", it won't be shown there.

Isn't project home only set after the project is loaded?  So we will know
the folders used as the project loads...

Hi,

I think that the dependency docker image got updated with latest gdal
version (possibly other libs as well) due to Qt Script removal (which
updated the Dockerfile,  hence the image).

When I set up a project I have a base folder (PROJECT) with subfolders 
like: scripts, data, pdf, temp, qgs

Could I right click that folder and set it as HOME. Hence that becomes 
the default workspace for that session.

Pro:

  * Everything references home - like geoproccessing scripts etc. I open
    up a tool/script/whatever and it starts there.

Con:

  * I might change the name of the project and something breaks
  * not everyone loves storing a project in one folder structure
  * Slow QGIS at start (?)

I find the project home node brilliant, but I've not used it so far (the
way I structure my data isn't compatible with this concept).

That said, testing it this morning, the behavior was not was I was
expecting. IMHO, this node should essentially act as a symlink, and
maintain the sub-directory structure.

This is good. But can we get a platform release feed? From my understanding
windows and MacOSX releases take time to package from the time the tag is
released. Or another option is just a mail list.

Again this doesn't mean a binary is released for a specific platform - Just
that code is ready for packaging

Hi Nyall, 

nice that we agree on both ;-) 

I will start collecting a wish-list on 3D and we can do a crowd funding
to address selected issues. Or we could do another QGIS grant on 3D
improvements.

When relations are involved, there needs to be a vector layer around to
work with these as far as I can see.
If this vector layer is promoted from a feature source parameter or
provided as vector layer input is a different question (I can live with
both).

For a really nice UX, the expressions in the algorithms would be
analyzed for if they require only attributes/geometries or other layer
specific information and complain if they get an input that's
incompatible with their expectations. But that's quite a bit of work for
probably not so many use cases so I wouldn't put that on high priority.

On the contrary, in most cases I believe this is unwanted. In
qgis2threejs I originally found it rather annoying.

seems a good change; IMHO we have to be carefl here, as this may prove
complicated and confusing to users. I believe more checks and comments
from "normal users" will be useful.

What I've been wondering is whether we need some concept of "original
layer id" in outputs generated by processing models. This could allow
us to retrieve relation information and additionally editor widget
config from the original source layer.

It's bound to be requested soon that someone wants to run a model that
does something like take a vector layer with a relation, change its
geometry in some way, and then do something with related features.
Regardless of whether we use vector layers or feature sources, that
just isn't possible in models currently since the output from any
other algorithms is a new layer, which has no knowledge of the
original layer's relations or editor widget config. (Also layer
metadata, which in some future release I'd like to see retained with
every step of a model)

I'm not sure the best way to handle this, but if it was available for
the output layers it would be trivial to make it also available for
feature sources, and through it allow models which use feature sources
to take advantage of relations/editor widget config/etc.

What do you think?

I think there are a couple of tricky things to solve here

- An algorithm can have multiple input parameters, which one would be
the original layer in this case
- Many things can change, on purpose or not. E.g. if the intermediate
layer is a shapefile, field names are corrupted and much of the original
layer meta information becomes useless

It might be better to bring interesting meta information into the
feature source, this already happens e.g. for fields (see
QgsField::editorWidgetSetup()). This keeps information under control and
in context.

Then some rules, like "using Relations with relation_aggregate is only
allowed directly on layer input". In other contexts, one will have to
resort to other aggregate constructs where one specifies involved layers
and fields explicitly and doesn't rely on project configuration.

I am easy here - we can make the defaults slower.  To which parts of
navigation do you refer to when you say too fast?
- zooming with mouse wheel
- zooming with right mouse button
- rotating camera with middle mouse button
- moving camera with left mouse button
- moving camera with arrow keys
- rotating camera with shift+arrow keys

Different controls have different constants - or all of them are too fast?

As Nyall has already pointed out, this is currently not possible and
there is a ticket to add that.

At some point I would like to do a larger overhaul of the current
camera controller as I do not really like how the camera state is
represented now (camera pointing towards point X,Y at zero elevation
with distance D and given pitch and yaw angles). The current
representation does not make it very easy to implement camera rotation
while not changing its position and other kinds of movements. Another
issue is the assumption that user looks towards a point at zero
elevation, which is not true when using a real terrain, making the
camera rotation behavior far from ideal. It is probably too late to do
some significant changes to the camera controller for 3.0, but it is
on my to-do list for the next release.

I was also thinking of having an advanced mode for controlling camera
- something like a first-person shooter game camera where user could
fly in any direction. Any ideas about how camera controls are welcome!


> * When rotating the whole model (middle mouse button) - how can I determine

As said above, the camera rotates around point (X, Y, 0) towards which
the camera is looking (keeping the same distance). Currently it does
not use the true terrain altitude for the rotation center.


> Is there any documentation somewhere about how the navigation should work? I

The navigation is described in the 3D QEP in "Camera Control" section:

The issue with Shift key when docked has been reported already - I
looked into it briefly but haven't found the culprit yet:

The fact that terrain from below is not rendered is a very common
optimization in 3D rendering called back-face culling - it makes
rendering faster by only rendering triangles that are facing camera.
It is not difficult to turn it off, but I am not sure if the culling
should be turned off by default...

Yes this is intentionally locked (for now) as most users would
probably complain if the camera went below the horizon. I understand
you use case though - maybe we can have a underground/caver/geologist
mode for the 3D view that would both disable back-side culling of
terrain and also unlock camera rotation...

Hi Martin, 

Thanks a lot for your reply. 

I would be fine if both of these wouldn't be defaults but configurable.

The pointers on the website are updated when the binary packages are available
(debian/ubuntu and windows).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Soft Freeze, Next Voting
Message-ID: <80254a3f-ccb3-1258-5271-63d4dfbc10b2@opengis.ch>

Devs,

It's time to vote again on starting the final countdown for QGIS 3.0
with feature freeze.

Since the last voting, various outstanding things have been merged and
we should be a good step closer to a next release.
Please speak up now if you have good reasons to require another
extension of this development round. If not, get into pole position for
fine tuning and polishing things that are in.

Tim, can you open another Loomio voting for feature freeze or X-mas freeze?

Thanks
Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Support to loading GIS projects from an extended
 OWC geopackage in the QGIS core
Message-ID: <1513255791658-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

Maybe some of you are aware of the  "geopackage" plugin
<https://eos.geocat.net/gitlab/joana.simoes/foss4g_gpkg/blob/master/foss4g_gpkg.pdf> 
.The initial goal of this plugin was to enable users to save their QGIS
projects, including style and associated resources
 in a extended geopackage -  the qgis geopackage extension
<https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/qgis_geopackage_extension.md>   -,
and load it onto another QGIS installation; on this approach, the project is
encoded as qgs, in a database table. Later the plugin was forked to support
a different geopackage exension -  the owc geopackage extension
<https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/owc_geopackage_extension.md>   - ,
which is standards-based; in this  approach
<https://www.geocat.net/announcing-the-extended-geopackage-qgis-plugin/>  ,
the style is encoded as OGC:SLD and the project as OGC:OWS context. The goal
of this approach is to support the migration of GIS projects, as we can
implement this extension in any desktop or server side GIS (e.g.: ArcGIS
Desktop).

The fork was merged in August this year, and the latest release of the 
plugin <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QgisGeopackage/>   already contains
both extensions, covering both use cases of porting QGIS projects and
migrating GIS projects. Recently, it was added  support in the core to the 
"qgis geopackage extension"
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L762> 
, in the qgsogrprovider class. This means that if a user loads a geopackage
which was encoded using the "qgis geopackage extension", it will
automatically load the QGIS project from it. We think that it makes sense to
also add the  "ows geopackage extension" to the core; in that case, users
could load projects exported from other GIS software seamlessly, without
having to load the plugin. The mechanism would be very similar to what was
already implemented for the  "qgis geopackage extension".

Before preparing any Pull Request, we would like to understand first what is
the general feeling of the community about this feature; is this something
which seems useful and interesting to add to the QGIS core? If yes, we would
also appreciate any comments regarding any details the implementation.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback :-)

                                     Joana

Hi Joana,

I think this would be a great addition to QGIS.

Big +1 from me, and thanks for the proposal.

The package release file for stretch currently lists several 
incompatible package versions that are dependencies of mentioned packages.

I assume the build team for some reason did not build all the packages 
overnight. Hopefully they will fix this with the next build.

Hello,

Maybe some of you are aware of theÂ  "geopackage" plugin
<https://eos.geocat.net/gitlab/joana.simoes/foss4g_gpkg/blob/master/foss4g_gpkg.pdf> 
.The initial goal of this plugin was to enable users to save their QGIS
projects, including style and associated resources
 in a extended geopackage -Â  the qgis geopackage extension
<https://github.com/pka/qgpkg/blob/master/qgis_geopackage_extension.md>Â Â  -,
and load it onto another QGIS installation; on this approach, the project is

which is standards-based; in thisÂ  approach
<https://www.geocat.net/announcing-the-extended-geopackage-qgis-plugin/>Â  ,
the style is encoded as OGC:SLD and the project as OGC:OWS context. The goal
of this approach is to support the migration of GIS projects, as we can
implement this extension in any desktop or server side GIS (e.g.: ArcGIS
Desktop).

The fork was merged in August this year, and the latest release of the 
plugin <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QgisGeopackage/>Â Â  already contains
both extensions, covering both use cases of porting QGIS projects and
migrating GIS projects. Recently, it was addedÂ  support in the core to the 
"qgis geopackage extension"
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L762> 
, in the qgsogrprovider class. This means that if a user loads a geopackage
which was encoded using the "qgis geopackage extension", it will
automatically load the QGIS project from it. We think that it makes sense to
also add theÂ  "ows geopackage extension" to the core; in that case, users
could load projects exported from other GIS software seamlessly, without
having to load the plugin. The mechanism would be very similar to what was
already implemented for theÂ  "qgis geopackage extension".

Before preparing any Pull Request, we would like to understand first what is
the general feeling of the community about this feature; is this something
which seems useful and interesting to add to the QGIS core? If yes, we would
also appreciate any comments regarding any details the implementation.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback :-)

The build machine ran out of space - should be resolved in the next nightly.

Also big +1 from me! One question - what about projects that use the new ancillary storage? Is there a way for that data to be included in the package too?

Yes I wanted to do it tomorrow evening as some helper elves are squirrelling away nuts for winter in the metadata PR and I was hoping we would have one less thing to vote on by thenâ¦.:-)

Martin

As a geologist and geophysicist it is extremely important for us to be 
able to see below topography and inside (slice and dice) volumes as in 
NVIZ in grass.

I have always thought that only being able to view topography form the 
top or volumes form the outside not inside was called 2.5D.

I am wandering if you should differentiate between them.

it would be extremely useful for us to ab able to render 3D raster from 
grass. Basically the same as in NVIZ of Paraview

thanks

Syd

Just wanted to say thanks for this again! I've struggled in the past
to find the magic formula for this, but using your instructions helped
me fix that annoying travis failure which has been hitting us over the

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Long running Python script running a model -
 moving it to background task?
Message-ID: <3721e8ba12a1617c01221c72f2ea4e96@carto.net>

Hi, 

I have a Python script that runs a Processing Model that takes about
20-30 seconds to run. 

Here is my code: 

---------------------- 

def exportAnlagenAlsExcel():
  # Prepare processing framework
  from qgis.core import QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition
  from processing.core.Processing import Processing
  Processing.initialize()
  import processing
  #run processing model
  processing.run("model:Anlagen-Export", { 'ewsanlagelayer' :
'service=\'zg_produktion\' user=\'ews\' password=\'xxx\' sslmode=disable
key=\'t_id\' srid=2056 type=Point table=\'ews\'.\'ews_anlage\'
(geometrie) sql=', 'native:orderbyexpression_1:Ausgabedatei' :
'C:/temp/ews_anlagen.xlsx' })
  #open result file in MS Excel
  command = 'start C:\\temp\\ews_anlagen.xlsx'
  os.system(command)
  iface.messageBar().pushMessage(u"Processing ExcelExport fertig",
level=QgsMessageBar.INFO) 

----------------- 

While this code runs fine, the model also runs for half a minute and I
would like to use a processing background task, if this is feasible for
my code. Currently, my code is blocking the UI - a progress bar appears
in the map canvas (see
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_running_model_from_python_code.png
- this was a bit surprising to me - why is this progress bar appearing ?
My code is not asking for this progress bar?) - and if it appears,
shouldn't the progress bar be displayed in the status bar instead? 

Anyway, I guess my code needs to be improved so that it runs as a
background task utilizing the new QGIS task manager. Are there any "easy
to understand" Python code examples available that show how to run
Python code as a background task using QGIS task manager? 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Thanks a lot for the support!

Tim,

Forgive my ignorance, but what would the ancillary storage be, exactly?
Could you give me an example or perhaps point me to a code file, so that I
can have a better idea?

Yes, please! I think there was an issue about not being able to load an
extended gpkg:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17698

so it looks like fixing a bug

Hi,

I am having problem with attributes which have defined precision, eg.

QgsField("ader_microsvh", QVariant.Double, prec=4),

The values are displayed correctly when loading layer to the memory
(see left part of screenshot), but after exporting such layer to SHP,
the values are lost (zero value with given precision), see right part
of screenshot. Tested with QGIS 2.14 and 2.18. Do you have any idea
how to fix this issue without dropping precision? Thanks, Martin

I would rather spend QGIS.ORG money on important bugfixing for QGIS 3.
QGIS Grant applications should be directed to the work nobody wants to
fund initially, or for proof-of-concept or kickstart of new features.

I have no doubt we will find people and organizations willing to fund
features for 3D improvement.

Perhaps - or maybe not. 3D is the kind of thing that many think is cool,
but they wouldn't spend money on it, because it isn't helping their
business case. As an example, the crowd funding from Lutra on 3D for
Crayfish go close to zero support from QGIS users up to now. See
https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/qgis-crayfish-3/  

It is not a coincidence that it took so long to get 3D started in QGIS.
Would it be a priority to the QGIS funders, then it would have started,
much, much earlier ... no one, except the QGIS grants money (and Martins
additional spare time) invested a cent so far in QGIS 3D. 

But it is anyway up to the voting members to decide what grants will be
supported. You are one of them I think ;-)

Hi there,

Iâm boarding a bit late on the train but:

> Perhaps - or maybe not. 3D is the kind of thing that many think is cool, but they wouldn't spend money on it, because it isn't helping their business case. As an example, the crowd funding from Lutra on 3D for Crayfish go close to zero support from QGIS users up to now. See https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/qgis-crayfish-3/ 

My experience as a journalist who speaks to quite a lot of people using GIS in local governments and elsewhere is that 3D is rarely, if ever used, and for the time being is more a gadget than a real useful tool.

However, that is probably going to change in the near future as a result of three separate trends:

1. LiDAR point clouds (Iâd say that integrating point clouds viz into QGis is as important as being able to represent 3D volumes). 

2. BIM - SIG convergence.

3. Utility network management (which raises the point of underground representation). 


Besides, is QGIS 3D powered by the 3D functions of Qt? Because I heard about the Globe plugin being underpinned by Open Scene Graph, and Iâd hate, as a packager, to see the number of dependencies barrel out of control just because the 3D support hasnât be harmonised to a single API.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] DLL load failed with PyDev
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMK2k7yK+v1Yf_eKgFX=0BM7Wbbbp2CDxjRM0DTH7nJ-Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
The great news is that I have already solved the problem.
I'm just writing to ask if anybody understands the reason behind this
phenomenon and to give advice for those how must struggle with the same
problem.

I have an eclipse startup bat as instructed in qgis documentation and
still, I got the DLL load failed error when trying to import something from
qgis.core.

The reason for this is the way I defined a jvm for Eclipse in eclipse.ini
(I don't have JRE bundled in eclipse installation).
At the first, I had in my eclipse.ini
-vm
C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath
and I got the ImportError
when I changed that to the real JRE path
-vm
C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_152\bin\javaw.exe
everything work as supposed to.

The javapath folder is a "new" way to define used java version. It has
symlinks (yes, on windows) to the real java installation. This is the
folder that java installation appends to the PATH environment variable.

In both ways, the sys.path is the same.
When eclipse is started with -vm C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath
os.environ['PATH'] is:
C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_152/bin/server;C:/Program
Files/Java/jre1.8.0_152/bin;C:/Program
Files/Java/jre1.8.0_152/lib/amd64;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qt5\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python36;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python36\Scripts;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python27\Scripts;C:\OSGEO4~1\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\system32\WBem;C:\OSGeo4W64;
and when with -vm C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_152\bin\javaw.exe
the os.environ['PATH'] is:
C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qt5\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python36;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python36\Scripts;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python27\Scripts;C:\OSGEO4~1\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\system32\WBem

I don't understand this because of the qgis_core.dll folder
C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis-dev\bin is in the PATH with both ways but it on the
other way it gives an error.

I'm just happy now that I found the solution for this even I don't
understand the reason.


Should we add this to the documentation also?

P.S.
Is there a reason for C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python27\Scripts to be still on the
PATH when using py3 environment?


Thanks,

-Lauri

Message-ID: <fb2e3e7711e25.5a33cf9c@ufz.de>

Dear All,

 I use Qgis with Grass plugin, but the r.stream.distance function isnÂ´t shown in my toolbox. Is it anyway possible to add it there?
In the modulelist, which is shown in the following link, it is even not mentioned.  (https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-QGIS_relevant_module_list)
 
The attempt to get it in through adding the r.strem.distance.exe- file in the folder where all modules are, failed.

What have I done wrong or what is moreover necessary to do?

I tried to figure it out a long time without any solution.

Hope to hear from you soon and thanks in advance.

Hi all,

some years ago, we discussed of a new project file format able to store
data and other ressources has been discussed.

We finally had the opportunity to make one step forward when working on the
auxiliary data storage stuff.

What's the current status in QGIS 3:

- we now have an optional format ".qgz" that is a zipped file
- the auxiliary data storage is a sqlite database ".qgd" storing additional
informations joined to classical layers (for manual labeling purposes for
instance). It is NOT a spatialite database that could be the container for
spatial data
- when zip fil format is chosen, the qgd file is stored inside the qgz.

So, the path is opened to modify the offline editing tools or other
equivalent features to store their local datasource (either gpkg or sqlite)
inside the qgz too.

We also now have a container for storing SVG, color ramps, pictures or any
additionnal ressource that should be shipped within the project.

Now my opinion on the proposal about storing all inside a GPKG:

- I think we should first have a native "packaging" format using native qgs
file, to adress what offline editing, Qconsolidate, or QFieldSync use cases
requires.
- The "interoperability" use case should be adressed only as an option, not
a default solution, since SLD conversion (and things that don't stick to
standards) will alter the project.

I am in favor of discussing all that after QGIS3 is out so that we keep
focused on that,  and then discuss that at the Madeyra hackfest. I'd be
pleased to animate a workgroup to reach common agreement, guidelines, and
find a plan for that.

Best regards !
RÃ©gis

Just from curiosity was there any particular reason for doing this? Is there an issue with the plugin repo we can help to resolve?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Support to loading GIS projects from an
 extended OWC geopackage in the QGIS core
In-Reply-To: <mailman.0.1513343452.22950.qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>
References: <mailman.0.1513343452.22950.qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>

Hi list, great to see so much enthusiasm for the suggested feature.
As you may know the GeoPackage standard itself by now already has quite a number of extensions. 

http://www.geopackage.org/extensions.html <http://www.geopackage.org/extensions.html>

It is to be expected that quite some of these extensions will also require a qgis plugin to access the extended data. Some of these extensions may act optimally if they are notified of a geopackage being opened (and are allowed to take over control of the thread). By allowing such a mechanism, developers may even write plugins that allow formats to be opened using qgis of which qgis before was not aware.

The suggested  plugin falls in this category, the functionality to open OWC-geopackage is either moved to core (check if the geopackage contains a qgis-projects table else check if it contains an OWC table else â¦ finally open as plain tables). Alternatively core could provide a mechanism that allows plugins to hook in the file-open event.

I have no clue of the impact of such a change, just wanted to raise the topic to hear your thoughts.

Related to the auxiliary storage discussion. This sounds like a cool feature for which I sure see a use case. OGC is working on a similar initiative called the âtable joining serviceâ (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/tjs/ <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/tjs/>) and I even recently read a thread about someone suggesting to put queries (with joins and filters) as a base for an OWS Context layer. However since auxiliary storage currently is very specific for QGIS, this will not be in the scope of our work, which is targeting moving full GIS projects between GIS environments by using standards. However I invite everyone to join in the initiative and create an extension that specifically targets this use case.

We have to consider that the QGIS project file has a lot of fancy things which will not be present anymore after being converted to an OWS Context. So when users are exporting their project the interface should guide them in selecting the best format for their use case.

Regards, Paul.

Message-ID: <7266ecb7527b4303a7b312822891245a@ex1.vhi.ie>

Hi guys,

Has anyone information on a secure Portal for QGIS so I can share webmaps with colleagues within my organisation?

To give a bit of background, I have been brought into a Data Analysis team for a fairly large organisation (1,000 employees) to give advice on how they could get more out of GIS. I came from an ESRI background but they were using MapInfo at the time. I have since persuaded them to move over to QGIS and all GIS analysis is now done through this.

As more and more people are seeing what value GIS can bring to their department the demand for webmaps for presentation purposes and as information reference point has increased.

I have been using the 'qgis2web' plugin (which is an excellent plugin) to create webmaps but with new data regulations coming into play now (GDPR) and efficiency purposes I would prefer to move to a portal environment where users have to sign in to an online portal to access the maps. Something along the lines of Portal for ArcGIS equivalent would be great!

Any info would be great!
Regards
Finbar

Dear Eva, 

Since r.stream.distance is a C addon, the process of getting it to work in qgis is a bit involved.
If the GRASS command line is available in qgis you could run it from there... 

Cheers

Betreff: [QGIS-Developer] Qgis r.stream.distance

Dear All,

I use Qgis with Grass plugin, but the r.stream.distance function isnÂ´t shown in my toolbox. Is it anyway possible to add it there?
In the modulelist, which is shown in the following link, it is even not mentioned. (https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS-QGIS_relevant_module_list)

The attempt to get it in through adding the r.strem.distance.exe- file in the folder where all modules are, failed.

What have I done wrong or what is moreover necessary to do?

I tried to figure it out a long time without any solution.

Hope to hear from you soon and thanks in advance.

Hi Finbar, 

QGIS perhaps doesn't offer a cloud solution as versatile as ArcGIS or
CartoDB. 

But there are two types of QGIS webclients that you could use for
self-hosting (if you want that): 

 	* QGIS Web Client 2: https://github.com/qgis/qwc2-demo-app
 	* LizMap: https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client

If you want a QGIS hosted solution, there is, as far as I know only QGIS
Cloud (https://qgiscloud.com/), which uses the above mentioned QGIS Web
Client 2. 

Or is there a hosted LizMap cloud services also available? Can someone
chime in if it is available? 

If you are a large organization, as you mention (1000 employees) than
you may want to self host your QGIS server with a web client of your
choice (see above) and some support from the two companies who develop
the two web clients primarily. Or you want to dive in yourself and do it
all yourself - this would also be possible. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Could you put the webmaps on a file share? 

Alternatively, how about installing QGIS itself throughout the organization?
There are various ways to lock it down and simplify it for non-specialist
use.

Hi

Alternatively there is GeoNode with QGIS Server backend that allows you to easily upload layers with QGIS Styles and share them within your organisation as OGC services or via download.

QGIS 3D has a lot of potential and works well with small DEM data sets, but
when ever I try it with a large DTM image I just get a white screen. I tend
to work with large DEMs (50000 x 50000 pixels and larger) and I would love
for this to work with it properly.

Do you have any ideas why this is the case? I have tried this with an
AIG/Arc/Info Binary Grid image as well as a GeoTIFF with overviews.

Hi Calvin

Could you please point me to such a DEM to try it out myself? Or even
better, file a ticket on issues.qgis.org so that we do not forget
about it. Not sure from the top of my head what could go wrong there -
the raster size should not be the reason really as the raster data
access is using the same code paths as 2D rendering would. Maybe there
is something in the data that causes the problem. If you resize the
large DEM to e.g. 5000x5000 pixels, does that help?

Regards
Martin

Could we give the terrain some small "thickness", and add a duplicate,
slightly lower surface facing downwards below the existing DEM?

One thing I would really like to see added in the 3D support before
3.0 release would be to add a "save as image" option. Currently it's
great to be able to play with data in 3d, but adding the option to
export the camera view to an image file would take take the 3D support
from being purely "exploratory" to instead becoming a "visualisation"
tool.

Totally agree with all the above. Personally, I'd love to see some
group of users start to take charge of extending QGIS' BIM
functionality/integration abilities. Is this something you'd (or any
other readers) be interested in doing? I'd suggest starting with a
thread on the user list, and start collating documents (e.g. via
google drive) for requirements/desires to make QGIS a first class
player in the BIM world.

> Besides, is QGIS 3D powered by the 3D functions of Qt? Because I heard about the Globe plugin being underpinned by Open Scene Graph, and Iâd hate, as a packager, to see the number of dependencies barrel out of control just because the 3D support hasnât be harmonised to a single API.

Yes, it uses the Qt 3D module, not OSG. There's another thread on this
list from last week discussing what future the globe plugin has.

Here's my status report:

- datum transform work: merged!
- layouts: PR open restoring raster and PDF exports. TODO: svg export,
atlas, translation of 2.x compositions -> layouts (I've brought
Alessandro onboard to handle this component)
- metadata storage: PR still needs review comments addressed (as far
as i'm aware)

It's just the normal behavior of processing.run - unchanged from 2.x.
You can disable the progress bar by overridding the feedback object to
use one which discards all feedback. E.g.:

f = QgsProcessingFeedback()
processing.run('algid',{parameters},feedback=f)

There's QgsProcessingAlgRunnerTask, but it takes a few lines of setup
code to utilise. I've been meaning to find time to make an equivalent
of processing.run which runs in the background (only if the algorithm
is safe to do so - see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5807). But
that will also be a few lines of code to utilise, since it's non
blocking, you'll need to connect to signals on completion/failure and
continue your script logic from these.

Will try and do this after finalising layout work.

Message-ID: <c79b75c9-4582-60be-2c5e-94b980d65ce8@gmail.com>

With a recent change in masters the project file format has been broken 
yet again (it seems) and now instead of recognising EPSG:3857 on project 
files that are not very old, it comes up as USER:100029

Now ordinarily this wouldn't be an issue, just open project properties 
and change the CRS. Except there is a well documented bug that makes the 
software crash when you try to do this.

As it's not possible in any way for me to fix this latest inability to 
recognise the CRS from the previous project file from a slightly earlier 
version of master, maybe it would be helpful to document how we could 
actually insert the CRS into the project file by hand so it is correct.

thanks

Hi Calvin

I have tested with your layer and the problem is with the no-data
values - right now the terrain generator does not have a concept of
no-data values so they are interpreted as valid values, which in this
case is a very high number (around 1e38) and that breaks the 3D view.
Best to keep an eye on https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17558 as that is
essentially the same problem. As a temporary workaround, you could try
to change your layer's no-data values closer to the valid range (e.g.
zero or 500).

Cheers
Martin

Great news! So it seems we only have a few things left:

1. Layouts: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5486
The work is going full ahead

2. Metadata: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5379
As far as I understand, it's almost done

3. Named transactions: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5663
Doesn't actually block the release, just would be nice to have it in 3.0

4. Spatialite 4.5: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5751
Under active discussion, not really voted yet

5. Welcome page: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/102
Just a proposal, not sure if anyone is working on it, doesn't seem to be a 
blocker (just an extremely nice addition for 3.0).

It really looks good! :)

Thanks for laying everything out so clearly RÃ©gis! One other thing I wondered about ancillary data is the ability to store images or other external resources linked to a layer - there was some discussion about how to manage this in NÃ¸debo tooâ¦.

Hello Tim and others,
I wanted to announce that we've created the Romanian User group under the name "AsociaÈia Utilizatorilor QGIS". We are in the last steps of creating a legal non-profit in Romania with the same name (although I know it's not a requirement).Although qgis.ro is up for several days the specific content will be ready in the following weeks.
Required details:
* The country your user group represents: Romania
* The URL for your country user groupâs web site: qgis.ro
* The name of your country user groupâs representative: Tudor BÄrÄscu
* The email address of your country user groupâs representative: tudor.barascu (at) qtibia (dot) ro
We've been functioning for some time in Romania (QGIS workshops at the geo-spatial.org meetings,Â  Romanian translation, etc.) and it was time to make in official.
Do we have to do anything else?
All the best,
Tudor

 Hi all
Have you started a country level QGIS user group in the last year? I will shortly be putting out a call for nominations for new voting members and we need to know about any new user groups that were formed in this year as under our governance system we appoint a voting member from the community for every country user group representative. This process is explained somewhat in this older blog post:
http://blog.qgis.org/2016/05/04/call-for-nominations-for-voting-members-of-the-qgis-org-board/
If you have registered a new country group, please forward me details of:
* The country your user group represents* The URL for your country user groupâs web site* The name of your country user groupâs representative* The email address of your country user groupâs representative
Currently I am aware of the new groups created for Norway, South Africa, France, Sweden and Georgia.
Thank you
Regards

Hi Tudor

Great to hear this! I have made a note on my master list of QGIS user groups and will include your group in the 2018 voting member elections (at the end of next year). You might also want to make a patch against:

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/usergroups.html

To add your group.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,
I missed that discussion sorry. I don't see why we couldn't use the sqlite
DB as a blob container, as it is a supported type.
However, like in all electronic document storage stories, the cardinalities
will probaby not fit well with the current use of simple joined layers
where one layer as one joined auxiliary table.
Storing many pictures linked to one feature might require a "document"
table and a relation table between layers and documents.
All this reminds me of the QEP  79 "Document Management Systems" a lot!

Cheers
RÃ©gis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New API - Easier restore of dialog positions.
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8hnZdthwCh-Xi_wmUwxKFAf8J=J9TfWTTU2F41Nn2kMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just thought I would make everyone aware of a quick time saver for
restoring dialog/widget positions added in master.  This is mainly to
remove the pain of having to do restoreGeometry()/saveGeometry() in every
widget and remembering the naming we use for settings keys.  It's also
about fixing consistency inside the application so every dialog remembers
their state correctly.

The new API is:

  QgsGui::instance()->enableAutoGeometryRestore( this );

This should go just after   setupUi( this );

Here is an example:

<goog_1212792088>
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsexpressionbuilderdialog.cpp#L26

You can then remove any calls to restoreGeometry() and saveGeometry() in
your widget. Diff of an example:

<goog_1212792089>
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/57dc9deb06a8f4474429b2956008188292588a1b#diff-b4d61d74d8a5b5319106d746b54d378bL21

Unless there is a good reason not, all new widgets should be using this
code when you write them. I would like to ask if people can start to port
existing widgets if they are already editing that code.  I will be doing a
bulk update when I can but I suspect I will miss some and group effort is
better in case I run out of time.

Regards,
Nathan

Patrick,

Your bug testing is very much appreciated - the way you word your
email subjects, not so.

Sorry. I have appreciated since writing this email that you guys could 
not have foreseen how the project properties dialog box crashes because 
no one else reported that as a bug.

There's a paradox (or tension) here: to get the best testing you have to 
be using this software every day to do as many things as possible. That 
creates issues when something breaks in a project file, if it's hard to 
fix easily.

Every time the CRS changed I changed it back but now it crashes when I 
try to do that. The changes in layer styles that don't migrate was small 
compared to being unable to set the correct CRS on a project because the 
CRS gui crashes.

Hey,

What OS are you running your testing on? If you are on Windows grab the
qgis-dev-pdb package so the crash will give you more info and we can get it
fixed.

It's not so much that - you've reported a valid bug, and for that
we're grateful.

Just please, remember that we're all REAL people here, we can keep
emails and bug reports courteous and professional. It just makes it a
nicer work environment for all of us. In the end we WANT to give you a
stable, bug free software... but it's also nice to be able to do this
without feeling attacked.

Just a quick heads up that anyone running master will now see some
duplicate toolbar buttons for new composer/composer manager.

This is intentional - the second set of these utilise the new layouts
engine. The first set will be removed when layouts is stripped out.

Message-ID: <1513585312106-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

Just to elaborate a bit more some ideas about the geopackage as a format to
support to ancillary storage:

- From the mere technical point of view, geopackage is very convenient for
storing QGIS projects. This is because we can actually store *everything*
within the geopackage: project information, data, metadata, style and other
data such as the information about labelling.

- However, in my opinion, the added value of the OWC geopackage extension,
which differentiates it from a common sqlite or spatialite db, is the fact
that it relies on* OGC standards*. This is what enables us to port
information to other GIS software which is no necessarily QGIS-aware. 

- Our proposal for the OWC geopackage extension is to keep it
standards-based, which means that we could support use cases such as the
ancilliary storage, if we would use mechanisms such as the tjs standard.
Although the support to queries in the OWC context which Paul mentioned is
still at the level of discussion, standards do evolve and I think that we
(as QGIS community) could also get involved in this evolution, whenever we
are pushing for generic and abstract mechanisms which could be reused by the
whole geopackage community. So to wrap it up, the answer is "yes", we could
support the ancillary storage, but we need to find out exactly how.

- Another interesting feature which arises from this discussion, is the
ability to support QGIS geopackage extensions in the core. Right now, the
core reader is aware of the "standard" geopackage format (through OGR) and
of the "qgis extension". If we implement it, it would also be aware of the
"owc extension". But what if we could create a more abstract reader, which
would look for extension tables and relate them to a certain "type" of
plugin? This would allow people to implement reading support to different
"flavours" of geopackages without much effort. I did not made a risk
anaysis, so I am not sure if there are security (or other) issues associated
to this, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this topic.

Hi again,

two sidenotes:

- we called "auxiliary storage" the new QGIS 3 feature. I realize everyone
uses "Ancillary storage" words. Should we rename that in the GUI?

- we HAD to use SQLITE and not spatialite, even though we wanted to use a
spatially enabled db. It turned out that init time to create a spatialite
with current provider was way too long, and having a default empty DB
storing more than 4Mo of SRS, functions and various metadata was not a good
idea for QGIS project file. Can anyone give us imputs if GPKG, relying on
spatialite implementation could suffer from the same drawbacks?

And more largely on pushing hard on OWC standard, I think it is always a
good idea that OpenSource is the leader on standards.
The feature could be exposed in "project" menu entry. "Save / Save As /
Export As OWC" for instance

Hi

First, thanks for sharing your thoughts, Joana.

To make sure I understand the approach proposed here. It will preserve
any style information and labeling which can be converted to SLD, but
not other qgis specific ones (which I think is an implication of the
term "standard" which doesn't apply to the qgis project file xml
format)? In explicit having maximum cross-compatibility while
sacrificing some of the advanced QGIS rendering possibilities.

RÃ©gis, I remember Even Rouault had some inputs how to create a
spatialite db without all this information (some flag on creation). I
would enjoy seeing the gpkg approach though (and wonder why your message
sounds like accessing it via spatialite is a key requirement).

Cheers

Matthias

Hi,

Nyall, If I may :"No! you are not overreacting". I felt the same way few
hours ago after I read https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17712 (an many others
before) and and was preparing the same kind of reply when I saw your mail.
Imho bug reporting can be done in a much better way, in a friendly way.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Regis,

As far as I know, geopackage uses a *sqlite* container, so it should not be
affected by the drawbacks you pointed out, although I never did nor I'm
aware of any benchmarking.

                                                            Joana

About the 4 Mo of SRS in the DB, check this discussion on Twitter last week

True, there are ways to make this smaller, but if this is to be a GPKG a
spatialite Database should be avoided

 Can anyone give us imputs if GPKG, relying on spatialite implementation
> could suffer from the same drawbacks?

With a Spatialite connection it is very easy to create an empty pure GPKG
Database (106.5 Kb) with:
SELECT gpkgCreateBaseTables();

It would contain only 3 SRS (-1,0 and 4326) in 'gpkg_spatial_ref_sys' with
all of the other GPKG admin-tables (including 'gpkg_extensions') empty.

If ever you feel that conversation is slipping away from the polite and courteous side of things, it might be good to point the conversation participants to our code of conduct (e.g. as a comment in a ticket):

https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/codeofconduct/codeofconduct.html

Thanks for helping to keep our community a friendly and pleasant place to be in!

Message-ID: <1513594820383-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Morning

How do I submit a plugin to the QGIS 3 repo? I've uploaded a new
experimental version of my plugin to the main repo with QGIS min version set
to 2.99 and max to 3.99 in metadata.txt, but it doesn't seem to have
appeared. Or are things not yet set up to except QGIS3 plugins?

Thanks

Tom

Thanks for all your pointers.

Discussing with Paul Blottiere and Hugo Mercier, we can give some global
aswers:

- We didn't think about GPKG, because in the end there was no need to
spatial data. Please remember that more than 6 months ago, GPKG wasn't as
promoted and tested than now.

- Changing the OGR SQLITE provider to GOKG OGR provider shouldn't be too
much work. The hardest part was synchronizing ancillary data with source
layer.

- Spatialite provider is absolutely not a requirement. We tried to use it
and it appeared too messy concerning featureId's and Primary keys too. Init
creation option were not exposed in API to be able to quickly create a
small DB. More largely on spatialite provider, and seeing Luigi's pointer
to current Spatialite Pull Request, we really think we should only use OGR
and mutualize all efforts there to have a unique and robust provider.

Sorry, I don't want to hijack the thread but I couldn't agree more on your
last point!
I'm convinced that we should use OGR/GDAL whenever possible, and when it's
not: try hard to contribute to OGR/GDAL to remove the blocker.

Hi Tom,

Are we talking about qgis2web? As (seen screenshot), there is a version
2.99 there.
Only thing I see is that it is experimental. Did you check the checkbox
to also show experimental plugins?

Or are you having troubles with other plugins or versions?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard

Yes, I can see it on the website, but if I click uninstall in my plugins
manager, I get the warning "this plugin isn't available in any accessible
repository". I do have experimental plugins enabled in the manager. Can you
see it in the QGIS3 plugins manager?

Thanks

Tom

Hi Tom,

Nope, not yet...

Note that to keep plugins.qgis.org running we had to enable some
caching... Which may be(?) that your new version is not in the cached
plugins.xml yet.

If I'm correct we recreate it every 30 minutes....

When did you upload it?

Richard

Sorry I think this was more a question of me using the wrong term earlier in the thread. I would not switch between the two terms, but using a simpler term (e.g. "Project storageâ) might be a good ideaâ¦.

Hi Tom,

Do you mean this version?
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/version/2.99.0/

It's set to min=2.99 and max=2.99! Not 3.99. In the metadata.txt, there is 
only the min tag, not the max one.

Master seems to be a bit broken at the moment: it requests plugins for 3.0 
(see the link in the Plugin Manager -> Settings: [1]), but when filtering the 
received document, it finds itself 2.99. 

So, for now the only solution is to add the missing max tag, and I'll try to 
fix the installer to accept plugins for min=3.0 as well.

Master is not broken, it was a deliberate choice to request 3.0 after
some discussion some time ago. Because most plugins had max version 2.99
already, we would not have been able to distinguis 2.99 (for 2.x) and
3.0 (for 3.x) versions without changing the django/plugin website.
Asking for 3.0 was the easiest way :-)

BUT if you do not add a max version it defaults to the same version as
the min version (or at least the *.99 version of the major version
number)....
So qgis2web has (see the url above on the bottom of the page) now has
2.99 min and 2.99 max

I would not try to fix this I think?
It is a temporarily thing

Richard

My thanks and apologies to you both - I thought I had set the max version.
I've set it now and republished, so I'll wait to see if it appears once my
XML refreshes. I don't see any problem with the behaviour as it stands until
we launch. Plugin authors should change the *min* version to 3 when it is
available, I guess.

Thanks again

Tom

Now master's plugin compatibility is fully hardcoded as 3.0:

The problem is you only set the request url, and the main compatibility check 
was still looking for 2.99 plugins. As a result, only plugins compatible for 
both version could pass the filtering :)

For now I completed your fix [1], and I'm thinking about something better - 
I'll make a PR for further discussion.

It's my fault - the installer is still not covered by tests!

Martin,

Thanks. That is the issue. I'm sure the 3D support is going to continuously
evolve and get better and hopefully sometime in the near future it will
handle no-data values. In the meantime I will use your suggestion of
remapping the no-data values.

Happy holidays,

Calvin

Not yet. After I wrote it, I realized there is also a third test: even if 
master downloads plugins>=3.0, the loading code still thinks it's 2.99 and  
won't load them. So Richard's fix just declutters the list of available 
plugins and speeds up fetching, but plugins still need to be compatible with 
both versions.

Take a look at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5904 please.

Borys

I am in the process of making some of my plugins accessible to the
Processing Toolbox. I have it working from the processing toolbox, but how
do I launch the processing algorithm GUI from my plugin menu as if I were
double clicking on it in the toolbox?

Thanks,

Hi Calvin,

In the processing options, there is a Menus (requires restart) section. In
there, all processing algorithms should be listed, including yours. For
each tool, you can set a menu path (separated by slashes If I recall), and
if you what a button to show in the toolbars.

Hi,

since the latest Update to QGIS 2.18.15, the Package networkx raises an
exception on import.

networkx problem: cannot import name 'release'

The most promising lead I quickly found is the following one, claiming
that it's caused by the missing "docorator" package which was previously
included directly in networkx and dropped in favor of using the
standalone package as dependency.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/networkx-discuss/ob5PkO-nMbQ/tcaoGo8JZXQJ

Does anyone else experience the same?

Thanks a lot
Matthias

If so, this is the first report.  Not reproducable here.

networkx was updated - introducing python3?-decorator - which as dependency of
python-networkx it's also included in the standalones.

I can't import it from the 2.18.15 console, but I just get a plain
"ImportError: No module named networkx".

OSGeo4W qgis (2.18.15-1). I believe it's 64-bit - easy way to check?

Hi Tom, 

The window/dialogue title of the "About" dialogue shows 64bit or

Thanks, Andreas - 64-bit confirmed. I was uncertain because one of our
departments uses a plugin which is 32-bit only, and I couldn't remember if I
had installed that version instead.

I tried getting more precision for printing doubles in a qDebug() with
std::setprecision (which works on iostream) but failed:

  error: no match for âoperator<<â (operand types are âQDebugâ and âstd::_Setprecisionâ)

This double-double comparison is driving me nuts so would love to read
more about the actual difference in those to QgsIntervals:

How do you raise precision in a qDebug ?

QEP#16 is https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/22

so QEP#17 could be:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/23

which lead to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/42

So it should be the good answer :)

What I am asking is for the API call to display a particular Processing
algorithm dialog box. For example in the processing documentation at:

https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/console.html

there are the following calls:

processing.alglist()
processing.runalg(name_of_the_algorithm, param1, param2, ..., paramN,
       Output1, Output2, ..., OutputN)
processing.algoptions("saga:slopeaspectcurvature")

The documentation does not mention any call to display the associated
dialog box and that is what I am looking for.

Incidentally, is there processing API documentation? It doesn't appear to
be a part of the QGIS python API.

Thanks!!!

Stepping back for a second, if your algorithms are already working, and your
plugin has its own GUI, why would you want to script opening the processing
GUI?

mmm why not? ;)
having your algorithm in Processing makes them accessible also in the
Processing Modeler.

I agree that depends on what your plugin makes

Message-ID: <362e770d-59ab-e086-ac81-464b4b7e6cea@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

maybe the question can sound trivial but I didn't find a solution.

Simply I would like to iterate only on selected features of a vector
layer features with an expression.

I know that the QgsFeatureRequest can be used with `setFilterExpression`
and `setFilterFids`.

Is it possible to combine them, so merging the following example in an
unique request?

exp = ''' "PH" > 7 '''
request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression(exp)
l = [i.id() for i in vl.selectedFeatures()]
request = QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFids(l)

for i in vl.getFeatures(request):
    ......


Thanks for all the suggestions!

Cheers

Matteo

No, I meant: if your algorithms are already working *in processing* - ie you
have them set up as processing algorithms, and you also have your own GUI,
why would you need to trigger the processing algorithm GUI?

Hi Matteo,

No, it's not possible to combine the two in the query itself.

But sending the request with the filter expression and then checking if
each feature's id is in selectedFeatureIds() should be straightforward.

selcted_ids = layer.selectedFeatureIds()
for feature in layer.getFeatures(request):
    if feature.id() in selected_ids:
        do_amazing_stuff_with(feature)

Hi,

You should have a look to the blog post from Nyall:
http://nyalldawson.net/2016/10/speeding-up-your-pyqgis-scripts/
So you can still use your `setFilterExpression`

1

request =
QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFids(vector_layer.selectedFeaturesIds())
for feature in vector_layer.getFeatures(request):
    # do something with the feature

But you installed python-networkx?   It's not a dependency of qgis (but
qgis-full - with a bunch of other stuff).

OK, no, that is be the explanation. I've neither installed python-networkx
nor qgis-full. Apologies for the noise.

Tow parties confirmed this on independent systems.
One just replied

Installed with OSGeo4W-setup-work.exe

As far as I know the systems were upgraded (and not clean
installations), could this be caused by leftovers?

Maybe.  They should have networkx 2.0-1 installed,  which is the old name of
the package and is empty, but depends on python-networkx, which is the new
package with the actual content.

Maybe there are circumstances where the previous version of networkx, that had
content, is removed after the new version of python-networkx is installed.

Hi Anita et al,

How did you get the geometry into QGIS. I have tried running a sql from
within the db manager plugin on a postgis datebase like:

SELECT
'POLYHEDRALSURFACE Z (
    ((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 0 0)),
    ((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 0 0 1, 0 0 0)),
    ((0 0 0, 1 0 0, 1 0 1, 0 0 1, 0 0 0)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 0 1, 0 0 1, 0 1 1, 1 1 1)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 0 1, 1 0 0, 1 1 0, 1 1 1)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 1 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 1 1 1))
  )'::geometry

It show the polyhedral in 2D in both QGIS 2D and 3D window, but crashes QGIS
when changing properties.

I have also tried creating a view in postgis like:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW test.polyhedraltest AS (
  SELECT
    row_number() OVER () AS row_id,
    'POLYHEDRALSURFACE Z (
    ((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 1 0 0, 0 0 0)),
    ((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 0 0 1, 0 0 0)),
    ((0 0 0, 1 0 0, 1 0 1, 0 0 1, 0 0 0)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 0 1, 0 0 1, 0 1 1, 1 1 1)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 0 1, 1 0 0, 1 1 0, 1 1 1)),
    ((1 1 1, 1 1 0, 0 1 0, 0 1 1, 1 1 1))
  )'::geometry AS geom
);

This just loades an empty layer in QGIS.

regards
Jakob

âThe crashes are a general issue reported here:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17416

On some machines it crashes, on others it doesn't. If you find a
non-crashing machine, you'll see the cube.

After digging around a bit more, the first error is about a missing
package pkg_resources (the other one seems to have been a follow up
error). This pointed towards the *python setuptools* package, which,
once installed on an affected osgeo4w-x64 machine, fixed things.

I've just updated to the latest nightly build from osgeo4w on my Dell XPS13
with Windows 10 Home Edition.
The result is:

 - flat geometry inside 3d view
 - cannot zoom more then what can be seen in the following image

There is an intentional zoom limit to protect users from zooming in
too much and getting strange rendering results. We could probably
extend it a bit more if needed.

For the flat geometry, have you enabled 3D renderer for the layer? (in
vector layer properties or in layer styling panel) If not, the layer
will be only rendered as a texture (together with other layers) on the
terrain.

My bad Martin, I thought 3d renderer was on. Now I can see the cube
correctly.

For the zoom limit, I can understand the rationale, but it should be at
least configurable.
In this case we have a cube with a unit face and this will probably hit the
current limit, but in case of man made artifacts (buildings, etc.) these
tiny dimensions will happen frequently....

My purpose is with my Shape Tools plugin. Currently I have several
functions that have a GUI and are launched from the Shape Tools menu. With
Victor's help I have one of them as a processing module and I will convert
more. I still want to be able to launch the functions from the Shape Tools
menu, but I see no reason to have two different GUI instances if I can run
the processing GUI. There is one advantage with the processing GUI in that
it automatically handles saving the output to various formats which my GUI
does not.

I agree that this is a valid use case. I can also see user PyQGIS
scripts wanting to show the dialog, especially pre-populated with some
non default values. (Not to mention that we should be able to
double-click an entry in the processing history and see this
prepopulated dialog, instead of immediately running the alg with the
previous values).

I'll see what I can do.

this left me curious, as there is no code revision for 3rd party

... any chance this can be introduced as a dependency to fix things also
on standalone and avoid manual steps on OSGeo4W?

False.  And you know. 
Example ?  This:
https://github.com/geodrinx/gearthview/issues/11

So, for what reason you tell something you know is not true ?  This is not a code revision ?  What is the name for this ?

> and why about this specific plugin and

False.  My develops continue outside qgis official repository. 
Also for gearthview.

Message-ID: <ae455ab7-51e9-08b6-2c18-d250d2ea293e@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

since ages, I use like the following to create/get 2
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem's , then create a QgsCoordinateTransform
from those and transform geoms or points:

crs = iface.mapCanvas().mapSettings().destinationCrs()
print(type(crs))
print(crs.srsid())
print(crs.toWkt())

crs2 = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem()
crs2.createFromId(4326)
print(type(crs2))
print(crs2.srsid())
print(crs2.toWkt())

crsTransform = QgsCoordinateTransform(crs2, crs)

But since some time (test in python console):

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/code.py", line 91, in runcode
    exec(code, self.locals)
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 10, in <module>
TypeError: QgsCoordinateTransform(): arguments did not match any
overloaded call:
  overload 1: too many arguments
  overload 2: not enough arguments
  overload 3: not enough arguments
  overload 4: not enough arguments
  overload 5: argument 1 has unexpected type 'QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem'

While the api

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsCoordinateTransform.html#a8c036726885d51e9fdfe1478a063dfcd

still notes this constructor?

Do I miss info? Or is something wrong with my sip stuff?

Hi,

I had the same problem.

I looked in the source, this constructor is not available anymore in Python
Bindings:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgscoordinatetransform.h#L75

You need to give a QgsCoordinateTransformContext in the constructor:

transform = QgsCoordinateTransform(crs, crs_4326,
QgsCoordinateTransformContext())

I hope it's the right way to do it.
But I guess, like you and me, a lot of users will wonder the same question
about this new parameter and how to configure it so it would be nice to
provide some snippet or to update the QGIS Cookbook.

Regards
Etienne

Ah, Thanks Etienne

ok. It is clear in the source indeed:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgscoordinatetransform.h#L75

  * \note Not available in Python bindings.

Beautifull docs in the source by the way!!!

What is plan/status to show this (also?) in the qgis.org/api docs?
I know there has been talk about it.

Would be a shame to show this very helpful documentation (thanks to the
writers) only in code?

Regards,

Richard

Just for reference, I think (but please correct me if otherwise) that
for plugins this is then the easiest one?

crsTransform = QgsCoordinateTransform(crs2, crs, QgsProject.instance())

as even with a non saved project this will provide the necessary
QgsCoordinateTransformContext ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] round function not working
Message-ID: <d677bf7b-8e2e-54bd-e2b9-82259b87d603@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I just compiled QGIS and it seems that the round function in the field
calculator is not working properly.

Without any decimal number it works nice (round(7.34562) -> 7) but when
specifying how many decimals have to be used (round(7.34562, 2) ->
7.34562) there are not taken into account and no rounding operation is
performed.

I tried with different layers and field and it seems it happens anywhere.

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS's python as a virtualenv
Message-ID: <CAExk7p0DiPqRL0bf3rS8__rQQO21rxvxQOrgcHBtMBYn4zqtng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I always have trouble when I need to use QGIS/OSGeo's python environment
from outside of QGIS (e.g. setting up an IDE, running some custom scripts
that need access to the same libraries than QGIS, etc...). Suggested
solutions are to create some batch file, but I never really manage to make
this work in a reasonable amount of time.

This contrasts very much with my experience with virtualenv (in non QGIS
related python work), where switching from one python environment to
another is extremely straightforward (source path_to_venv/bin/activate on
linux or path_to_venv\Scripts\activate.bat on windows). With those
commands, everything works : python, pip, all libraries, etc... I think
most python IDEs support virtualenvs.

I'm not sure if this is possible or not, but would it be possible to have
QGIS/OSGeo's python environment configured as a virtual environment ?

Thanks !

Olivier

Yes, please do so.
If you call with an empty context, this will not use project settings into
account.

Just a side question, can't we make a default constructor like the one in
qgis 2 and take the project instance context automatically in the
constructor itself?
Most of plugin writers won't know exactly what is the third parameter. And
it's better to always use the project context if I understand.

An easy way to do so is to add the path to the QGIS python packages in a PYTHONPATH env variable and the packages will be reachable from your virtual env.

Another (better) to do so would be having QGIS package packaged as pip/setuptools package so that they can be installed in any virtualenv - assuming that qgis libraires are already installed on
your platform.

This work well on Linux/OSX since QGis can rely on the python installed on your platform. On windows, this can be painful because of the way python interpreter is packaged, but I know very 
little about Qgis on Windows) .

Hi Matteo,

Just tested on both Linux (latest master) and Windows (a bit older).

Both work fine with

round(7.34562, 2)

Result is as expected (7.35).

I'm not sure what to do with this API break for my QGIS 3 plugin. Can

This showed up with QGIS 3 version 2.99.0-245. In my code I have  the

        transform = QgsCoordinateTransform(epsg4326, canvasCrs)
        x, y = transform.transform(float(lon), float(lat))

I get this error:

        transform = QgsCoordinateTransform(

Message-ID: <CABPxTTro5nwa-bguJ732h+axSTxk24=jQ50w=D_sWx7XvmueNw@mail.gmail.com>

I have attached a script that creates two polygon layers in QGIS 2.18. Run
the script to create the polygons and then run one of the Geoprocessing
Tools such as Difference, Symmetrical Difference, or Clip and you get the
wrong results. If you do the same thing in QGIS 2.14 you get the correct
results.

I suspect that the issue is related to the fact that these algorithms have
been moved to Processing and that it is more strict on how polygons need to
be created.

The question is how do polygons need to be created so that they work with
the processing algorithms.

Next my concern is that if one has a polygon layer that does not conform to
the proper standard and the user runs one of these algorithms, then the
user may be getting back invalid results and may not know that they are
invalid.

Regards,

Calvin

Hi all,
I noticed the new plugin has been published by Alexander Bruy:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_whitebox/
an impressive piece of work, I'm astonished.
Once installed from zipfile it appears correctly. However, I do not see
it in the list of plugins available for install in a recent (7037c2936b)
QGIS3 version. Experimentals activated. Anything wrong here?
All the best, and thanks.

It makes my plugin development efforts look insignificant.

As a side note, I quickly tried the slope command, and no output is
produced, without warning.

Dear developers,

OSGeo Code Sprint will come to Bonn (Germany) in March 2018 [1]. You are 
invited to join us.

When:

- Sun 2018-â â 03-â â 19 12:00 noon -â â  Sun 2018-â â 03-â â 25 12:00 noon

http://www.basecamp-bonn.com/)

- Accomodation Booking System: 
http://www.bonn-region.de/events/fossgis.html

Interested? So read more about why & where & when...

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) has a long tradition of 
organizing code sprints for developers of Open Source GIS software.

For several years the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) [1] has 
been organizing a yearly Code Sprint, a come-together of the "C Tribe" 
OSGeo projects - now we call it OSGeo Code Sprint. Leading developers of 
projects like GDAL, PostGIS, MapServer, QGIS, PDAL, and many more get 
together to discuss new ideas, hack, decide, tackle large geospatial 
problems & more & simply to have fun.

In 2018 the OSGeo Code Sprint will come again to Europe after Vienna 
(2014) [6] and Paris in (2016) [4]. This makes is possible to embed 
European developers and users.
The tradition started in 2011 with Toronto [11], then New York [10], 
Montreal [9], Island Wood [8] and Boston [7]. And went to Philadelphia 
in 2015 [5] and last year to Daytona Beach (2017) [3]. Find a list of 
code sprints at [12].

OSGeo Code Sprint 2018 in Bonn
------------------------------
This year the international code sprint of the OSGeo will take place 
from 19 to 25 March 2018 simultaneously with the FOSSGIS Conference 2018 
in Bonn. We offer a setting so that individual projects can meet for 
their code sprint.

The code sprint will take place at BaseCamp in Bonn. During the FOSS4G 
2016 in Bonn we have already organized a code sprint at this location, 
in which about 100 developers worked on the open source projects every 
day. (https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2016_Code_Sprint). It is a 
really awesome location. Codesprint and accommodations are combined in 
one hall and you will live in a caravan, bus or cabin.

Check out http://www.basecamp-bonn.com/ for details about the venue.

Acommodations
-------------
Working zones will be created for you in the breakfast area and 
hallways. Healthy and not-so-healthy catering of drinks and snacks will 
be provided by us. Participation in codesprint is free of charge. 
However, overnight stays will have to be reserved and paid for by 
yourself.

BaseCamp is an indoor campground and offers different caravans, night 
sleepers, Airstreams, a Trabant, Volkswagen transporter and other places 
to stay.

If you prefer to stay in a hotel - no problem. Bonnox Boardinghouse is 
close-by. And you also find many great hotels in Bonn.

Book your room soon
-------------------
As the accommodations are as well available to FOSSGIS 2018 participants 
we will make an effort to make advance booking possible for you a few 
days ahead, to ensure you have the opportunity to sleep on-site and wrap 
up the evenings jointly.
Therefore, please book your accomondation as soon as possible via the 
booking system http://www.bonn-region.de/events/fossgis.html


Register for the OSGeo Code Sprint
-------------------------------------
And don't forget to sign up in the OSGeo wiki at our OSGeo Code Spint 
2018 page:
  https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Code_Sprint_2018

This is important for us, not only for the planning of snacks and 
drinks.


The OSGeo Code Sprint is open to all who wish to participate in one or 
more projects. There is always plenty to do â itâs not all about 
programming. Translation, documentation, feedback, discussions, testing 
â all this is also important for projects so everyone is cordially 
invited to attend the codesprint!

The Codesprint Organizing Team is looking forward to your coming!

Summarily:

When:

  Sun 2018-â â 03-â â 19 12:00 noon -â â  Sun 2018-â â 03-â â 25 12:00 noon

Nope, as Denis has noted those website API docs are out of date and
should be updated... maybe something is broken in the script to do
this? Note that https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5944/files expands
the dox based on this discussion.

Denis has been doing fantastic work lately in auto converting the c++
doxygen into standard Python docs. I'd love to see us add this to our
website too. I'm sure this would be another great feature to launch
with 3.0 - real Python documentation for our classes!

Mostly, but depends on the context. There's some code paths where the
project is explicitly available and that project should be used
instead of the catch-all "QgsProject.instance()" call. E.g. a
processing algorithm should use the project specified in the
QgsProcessingContext, not QgsProject.instance(). That's also why I
don't think auto-inserting this argument for Python is appropriate.

	bindings?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg5wDav0c4_KZb7WorQR2N2YEp02=4PXWAP6yc6of1VQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wondering... before 3.0 launch, should we remove
QgsProject.instance() from the Python bindings, in favour of something
like iface.activeProject()?

Sometime in the future (4.0?) we'll end up killing
QgsProject.instance(), but in the meantime is it a good move to push
people away from relying on this method?

I'd say yes, given that the 2.x -> 3.0 api break is so huge anyway and
will generally result in substantial plugin rewriting (vs just
modifying a few methods), maybe we're better off to get PyQGIS
developers to deal with this now and factor it into their new
designs?*

+1 from me too. This also will bring more consistency with other methods.
We already have iface.activeLayer() instead of currentLayer()

the more intuitive names the better

and thanks for your explanation earlier about when not to use the
'activeProject'

for the advantage, that when we go MultiProject we can just add a
activeProjectChanged signal

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Color ramp issues
Message-ID: <f2306a8e-faec-68a5-4bfa-da657a50fc81@gmail.com>

Hi all,

don't know if the behavior is correct or not.

When copying or importing a color ramp from one raster to another (color
ramp created by the user) in the Raster style option dialog it is not
possible (or I cannot figure out how to do it) to edit that color ramp.

The button that displays the colors is not updated with the
imported/copied color ramp.

Am I missing something?

Thanks to all!

Cheers

Matteo

with QGIS 2.18.15 (https://qgis.org/ubuntugis repo) on Linux Mint 18 (based
on Ubuntu 16.04).

I traced the problem and the cause is the Value Tool plugin.

The bug tracker of the plugin seems to be offline [0].

Richard, are you still the maintainer?

Thanks!

Thanks a lot to all the people in this community,

It is a great pleasure to work with you and bring this project ahead. A
lot has been achieved this year.
This was only possible due to the huge commitment of all the people in
the QGIS community.

Thanks a lot for

. keeping the webpage running
. joining hackfests
. developing
. answering questions on stackoverflow
. doing release management

Hi,

I can only second Matthias' statements! It is a pleasure to work with 
the QGIS community!

I'd like to add our donors and sponsors to the list. We had a good year 
in 2017, regarding donations and sponsorships, which helps to run our 
infrastructure, contribute to developer meetings and hire devs to fix 
bugs. The 2017 financial report will be published soon, to reflect the 
previous sentence.

I also really enjoyed the meetings at the Linux hotel and in Nodebo.

Now I am really looking forward to the QGIS 3.0 release - whenever it is 
going to be released ;-)

Greetings and happy new year!

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS: Execute NNJoin-Plugin within the Python
	console
Message-ID: <384F3A25F608C04089E0D747A4EB5B2705DD48@doug.risc.local>

Good morning everyone!

I want to write a python script which I can execute from within QGIS (from the python console).
The python script should calculate the nearest line (out of a set of lines) of a given point (out of a set of points)
and I have already accomplished this task by manually using the NNJoin-Plugin. Now I want to automize this
process within a python script, but I do not know how to run the NNJoin plugin within a Python script.

Is this even possible? If yes, could you give me some advice on how to accomplish this?
Thank you in advance!

Hi Guys,

Recently, I received the issue about Catalog Planet Labs Plugin, and I

This year is ending, then, I desire for you a new year "easier" for you.

Hi

I also want to echo the sentiment from Matthias and others in this thread. QGIS has taken all of us on an amazing journey, and by far the best part of the journey has not been what we built, but how we built it - in a spirit of collaboration and âcan doâ with help from many amazing people. I can only say thank you! I am looking forward to great things happening in our project next year and in years to come!

Happy New Year everyone!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] newbie questions re: exe or dll to batch-process
	shapefiles
Message-ID: <CAFWU1Q0g=M95gRBC6S8SU1GxbSGNbjxib5-V+amS2LnO3XLFEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm a newbie to QGIS, with several years of experience with other GIS
software, particularly ESRI MapObjects and Atlas GIS.

I've also been a software developer (mainly Windows desktop applications)
for many years. I'm concurrently learning Python in order to interact with
the QGIS API.

My latest direction from my employer is to create software that
batch-processes spatial data (for now, ESRI shapefiles) non-interactively,
with "Python and QGIS".

(I don't actually know yet whether I should be looking at QGIS's API for
purely non-interactive processing, or at GDAL/OGR, as suggested by someone
on Twitter.)

I'd like to ask some questions in order to guide my learning. I ask for
your pardon in advance as some of my terminology may still be ESRI-centric.

I have been tasked with creating a routine that does the following:

    1) reads in as parameters (i) the filename of one shapefile,
representing an overlay layer; (ii) one or more filenames of shapefiles,
representing target layers; and (iii) an output folder name;
    2) loads the overlay and target layers, reprojecting each as necessary
into a common projection (we're expecting to convert Albers
projection-NAD1983 to Transverse_Mercator-NAD_1927_UTM_Zone_10N);
    3) for each target layer, find all features that touch any feature in
the overlay layer, and export all of these to a new shapefile in the output
folder.
    4) This would be called by another Windows desktop application.

The ideal solution that my employer and I are seeking would be a Windows
executable or DLL, with minimal additional installation overhead. I am
aware of py2exe and cx_Freeze, and I've seen the "Python on Windows FAQ".

Is this a feasible project? Is it a wise project?

Does accessing the QGIS API launch a separate window / do I have to launch
a new and visible process in order to access QGIS via API calls?

Should I be looking at GDAL/OGR for non-interactive background work instead?

What other considerations should I be aware of?

Thanks for your time and attention.

Regards,
Willson de Veas

Hi Willson,

1. Following the "Keep it Simple" principle, I would recommend just a
script based on OGR. QGIS will not add any value to this simple
transformation.

2. Check every geometry to make sure it is valid.

3. If you have large amounts of data, you might consider Postgresql with
PostGIS. Databases are better than the file system to store and process
data.

Just one opinion.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] WFS vs WMS data types
Message-ID: <9de936ef-8dfe-13e6-6d8e-f6f103428245@duif.net>

Hi Dev's,

(talking about 2.18 here)

WFS and WMS of the same service seem to create different attribute
data-types?

Going to this WFS:

https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/ows?

there is a layer with 'panden' (houses), which have a column
'identification' which is (should be) a long integer (up to about 15
positions long).

On a WMS GetFeatureInfo request (same url) you will see those id's as
nice long integers/strings:
1598100000022426

BUT if you request the same house in a WFS layer, you will see floats:
1.59810000002243e+15
for example in the attribute table, or if you use the info-tool.

This is a problem if you need that id to create joints/relations.

I had a look into the sqlite file which is created in:
~/.qgis2/cache/wfsprovider/pid_16544
and indeed see this create table sql:

CREATE TABLE 'features' ( "__ogc_fid" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
'identificatie' FLOAT, 'bouwjaar' FLOAT, 'status' VARCHAR(255),
'gebruiksdoel' VARCHAR(255), 'oppervlakte_min' FLOAT, 'oppervlakte_max'
FLOAT, 'aantal_verblijfsobjecten' BIGINT, 'actualiteitsdatum' BIGINT,
'__qgis_gen_counter' INTEGER, '__qgis_gmlid' VARCHAR(255),
'__qgis_hexwkb_geom' VARCHAR(255), "__spatialite_geometry" POLYGON)

Is this a fixable (hopefully 2.18 only) problem?
As 2.18 will be LTR for some time.

Happy to create an issue for this. I also attache a 2.18 project file
which has these 2 layers zoomed in on a place with those long ids.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Problems accessing Dockwidget Features
Message-ID: <CAPqby8ntJ2d8dozM-birZYrdBFQa-cs5WbM+1Z43FGcpe3AXFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm writing a QGIS plugin but I'm facing some basic problems. The
plugin is a dockwidget. I've built it with plugin Builder and then compiled
the resources file.

When I try to access the comboBox to populate it with values, an error
happens:

*self.dockwidget.comboBox.clear() AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
attribute 'comboBox'*

I checked in the Qt _Designer the object name and it's comboBox. When I do
the same with a dialog plugin, instead a dockwidget, everything seems to be
right, and the comboBox is populated. This is the code for the run method.

def run(self):
    """Run method that loads and starts the plugin"""
    self.dockwidget.comboBox.clear()
    for i in range(9):
        self.dockwidget.comboBox.addItem(str(i))

    if not self.pluginIsActive:
        self.pluginIsActive = True

        #print "** STARTING PruebaExp"

        # dockwidget may not exist if:
        #    first run of plugin
        #    removed on close (see self.onClosePlugin method)
        if self.dockwidget == None:
            # Create the dockwidget (after translation) and keep reference
            self.dockwidget = PruebaExpDockWidget()

        # connect to provide cleanup on closing of dockwidget
        self.dockwidget.closingPlugin.connect(self.onClosePlugin)

        # show the dockwidget
        # TODO: fix to allow choice of dock location
        self.iface.addDockWidget(Qt.LeftDockWidgetArea, self.dockwidget)
        self.dockwidget.show()

I don't know if it's related, but when I try to create a signal this error
is show:

*File "XXXXXXXXXXX/PruebaExp.py", line 176, in initGui
self.dockwidget.signalBox.connect(self.enviadato) AttributeError:
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'signalBox'*

Same error when I try to acces a pushButton:

*File "/home/luismi/.qgis2/python/plugins/PruebaExp/PruebaExp.py", line
221, in run*

* self.dockwidget.pushButton.clicked.connect(self.enviadato)*

* AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'pushButton'*

Maybe is due to something I missed during the building of the plugin. I'm
using QGIS 2.18.14.

Hi,

Apparently you do not declare the self.dockwidget anywhere?
As everwhere where you try to USE that it appears to be None.

Normally in the 'initGui' function you create your dialog or dockwidget
using something like:

self.dlg = MyDialog(self.iface)
or in your case there should be:
self.dockwidget = MyDockWidget(self.iface)   <= your constructor

my feeling is that you miss that step (or have a small naming error)

Message-ID: <fa3115a6812f8917f4333cb2f47e43c2.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there!

In QGIS3, The tooltip for "Automatically create transaction groups
where possible" informs that group transactions (=GT) would only
possible in PostGIS right now.

Are there plans to add GT support on SQLite-based databases, like
GPKG? The benefit is a much faster writing of datasets.

It's already supported by OGR since v1.11 and earlier.

Best regards,
Tobias

Hi,

Ok for this change, but please take the Server into account, where iface is
not usable, but serverIface instead. Please add the activeProject method to
the server interface too, as server plugins shall use the project

 It worked!

self.dockwidget = MyDockWidget()

That's the way it worked for me!

Thanks a lot !! ^^

It's already done transparently for operations which would benefit
from this, such as adding many features at once.

Hmm, so the switch is only fÃ¼r PostgreSQL? ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Dynamic linking a new PROJ.4 problem
Message-ID: <CANVKczOY-=T=4nsG63bBzT7cJ17hpJSXTfnPRCY0TZwSFogmsg@mail.gmail.com>

Someone on the GIS stackexchange site wants to use the "Authagraph"
projection for maps (its a bit like a Dymaxion):

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/266581/how-can-i-use-the-authagraph-projection-in-qgis

I thought this might be as easy as recompiling PROJ.4 with the patches
given in a link on that question, then pointing LD_LIBRARY_PATH on my Linux
box to dynamically link with that instead of my system PROJ.4

My QGIS reports its using PROJ.4 version "493", so I got version 4.9.3
sources and patched it, I can run the newly built `proj` on the command
line and it works:

$ ./proj  +proj=augr +ellps=WGS84
0 0
1408004.57    8254540.11

If I set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH I can see that QGIS has linked to my new
libproj.*.so file, and if I try and create a Custom CRS I can specify
"+proj=augr +ellps=WGS84" and it will convert coordinates in the "Test" box
as it did on the command line, so I know its linking correctly and it
understands the "augr" projection.

BUT... when I hit "OK" on the Custom CRS dialog, I get "The proj4
definition of 'my augr' is not valid" dialog.

Does QGIS have some idea of what is a valid CRS independently of the linked
PROJ.4? Do I actually need to rebuild QGIS with my patched PROJ.4 to get
this to work?

QGIS version is 2.18.14, running on Ubuntu Linux.

Thanks

Barry
