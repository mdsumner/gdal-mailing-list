Matteo

The ability to save to a DB is not dependent on the output itself, but
on the algorithm. Since models can have 3rd party algs, models are not
capable ,by default, of outputing to a DB. That can be fixed, and
yours is a very good idea. Can you open a feature request so we do not
forget about it? sounds like something interesting to work on at the
next HF :-)

Thanks!

Hi guys

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/03/ubuntu-on-windows.html

Could this have an impact on how QGIS is run on Windows? Maybe moving
python to the Ubuntu part?

Just wondering....

Hi,

I suspect not. Not from a users point of view, no GUI for a start.

However it does open some good options for cross platform testing without
leaving your box.

Hi Pieter, 

It only supports commandline tools so far - so nothing graphical. 

For things like bash, apt-get, rsync, find, grep, sed, perl, ruby, php,
python, vi, ssh, wget, etc. 

It comes with a totally separate Linux file system. The Windows drives
are mounted in /mnt/c for the C drive and so on ... 

So no - it won't have much imparct for QGIS on Windows ... 

------------ 

But hey - finally it will be the year of Linux on the Desktop!

Hi,
With QGIS 2.12.1:
Where can I set QGIS processing script repos?
When I want to load R script from toolbox I get a python error like this : http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12515
Bug seems to be fix, but…

Repos is located here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing/tree/master/rscripts
But I don’t know where I can set it in QGIS

Thanks

yes, I was thinking about that. I will create local repo for my
OSGeoREL at the CTU. No problem with hosting I am working at the
university. Plugins (student projects) which will pass requirements
for QGIS repo will be moved there after some testing.

Thanks to all for feedback, Martin

Our nightly builds for wily use cmake from vivid and the new cmake 3.5.1 in
xenial is not affected anymore.

We only build packages with ubuntugis dependencies for precise and trusty.
Packages for wily are in http://qgis.org/debian/

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding new color ramps using python
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FggtU5s_6XjqPY3LCVCra3JGWCRRP9Z4pPpz54vsGkadg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to directly add new color ramps to QGIS using Python?
I know that it's possible to write style xml files for color ramps which
can then be imported but a more direct solution would be great.

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Untested, but something like

ramp = QgsVectorGradientColorRampV2( color1, color2 )
tags=[]
QgsStyleV2.defaultStyle().saveColorRamp( 'my ramp', ramp, 0, tags )

should work.

See https://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorGradientColorRampV2.html and
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsStyleV2.html#a14a66fbd382fa858cbc8cd73d394724d

​Thanks Nyall, that worked great! I used both saveColorRamp() and
addColorRamp() to save permanently but still have the new ramp appear
without having to restart QGIS.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal: removing Processing from plugins repo
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7z+_V=41AZRF-qLb0fp6sadCJKJxwYp9QFworMrT1xgOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I would like to know your opinion about this idea: removing Processing
from the QGIS plugins repo.

Rationale for this: we have always tried to release new version of
Processing between releases of QGIS, to provide more updates when
important fixes are made or interesting functionality is added. This
sounds good in theory, but it has proven to be difficult to handle.
The main reason for this is that having the same plugin in the
installation folder and the user folder leads to strange behaviour
sometimes, and confusion for users. The Plugin Manager doesn't seem to
be prepared for this circumstance, and sometimes fails when updating.

I think that maybe is a good idea to handle processing as a core
plugin, and forget about releasing it outside of QGIS releases.
Processing should not be in the plugins repo, to avoid confusion.
Basically, what other core plugins do.

I still see a lot of messages with installation issues and failures,
and I think it is not a good thing.

What are your thoughts on this?

Thanks!

Given that we have monthly point releases, I don't think it's worth the hassle.

A big +1 from me. This would help avoid a lot of user confusion.

A big +1 from me too. There is another reason to adopt this approach - it is hard to build something relying that if the user has QGIS version X they will also have processing algorithm Y - which is something we are running into here with our plugin development.

+1.  Originally I thought it was a good idea to have it there too but it
seems it's worse that way.  Live and learn.

On that note can we remove it as a plugin and just make it a core feature
like Python console is, e.g no way to enable or disable it and is always on.

+1 I agree - it would be nice to be able to rely on in being installed and available.

I like the idea of it not being a plugin that can be enabled or
disabled. How is that done? :-)

BTW, another issue: currently a subplugin can be deactivated (and should
be activated) both from plugin manager and from Processing.
IMHO the second step should be skipped.
All the best.

Since the latest UI changes, deactivating a plugin in the Processing
options doesnt mean disabling it, only not showing it in the toolbox,
so it's not the same thing. The algorithms are "active" if the plugin
that contributes those algorithms is enabled (can be run from console
or as part of a model), but they dont show up on the toolbox

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Doubt regarding release schedule
Message-ID: <CANFg2AWODbTN-tU=eXKFOXMbiagn4e_4VQ7Gk+HVhGXE9U-1JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

 We have a doubt regarding release schedule:

 On February QGIS version 2.14 was released and we expected it to be a Long
Term Release as it was announced in the release schedule
<https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule>.
However, in the main page <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html>, the
2.8.x version is still being labelled as the LTR and not the 2.14.x.

 In this case we are not really sure what to expect regarding QGIS LTRs: is
any future 2.14.x release going to be considered LTR or will 2.8.x remain
as LTR until version 3.0?

 Thank you very much for your time!

 Kind regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing algoritm/script button?
Message-ID: <57024363.70902@duif.net>

Hi,

tried to Google this but did not find anything yet. But having a
(custom, complex) processing script, what is the best/easiest way to
give it it's own button on the toolbar?

I could write a minimal plugin to call the algorithm?

OR does processing already have this?

And if not: this is the feature request:   ;-)

Given one or more Processing scripts, make it possible to place a button
in the processing toolbar (not yet there...) for it.
Maybe via some syntax like

##button=foo.jpeg

Where foo.jpeg is an image next to the script? Or full path to it
As a tooltip you could see the name of the user script?
If not already there it could create a 'processing scripts button
toolbar' and add the button to it.
Upon clicking the button it would run the script.
One script can have one button.

In this way the user-friendly-ness of a plugin could be combined with
the (for end users sometimes) rather 'technical' view of a processing
script. Especially for those users who only run a couple of specialized
scripts this would be nice.

Regards,

Richard

there is an option in Processing to add any algorithm as a menu (see
in the Processing options menu), but not as a button,

The "custom toolbar" plugin has that option, and will allow you to add
a new toolbar and button with any Processing algorithm

Hope this helps

Hi Richard,

as Victor already mentioned, you can add menu entry for any
Processing algoroithm via Options dialog.

If you want to do this programmatically you can use
addAlgorithmEntry() function from processing.gui.menus
package.

Right, and, as Alex points out, doint it programatically you have the
option to add a button as well (using the UI, not)

see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/menus.py#L138

2.14 will enter the LTR repositories and replace 2.8 when 2.16 is released.

Hi Victor,
thanks for the explanation. However, I'm not sure this is immediately
understandable for the user. I believe if one installs a plugin, he
expects to find it activated straight away. Currently he has sometimes
to activate it in plugin manager and also in Processing providers.
All the best.

But that's an option in the provider. Some providers should be by
default disabled in Processing (for instance if they require an extra
setup -R- or there is another that is similar -GRASS and GRASS 7-).
For providers that come from a plugin, they should be active by
default, if they want users to have it enabled without going to
Processing and checking the correspodning box. So, in short, that is
an issue of the Provider plugin itself, since you can tell Processing
to have it enabled by default.

Hope this helps

It does indeed, thanks again. Apparently some developers fid it
difficult to grasp, as not all Processing plugins are enabled by
default, nor even these who do not require special setup.
Could you please pont me to an explanation of this, so I can help plugin
writers to fix it?
All the best.

I guess it's somehow my fault, since that is not documented

See here for the GRASS provider

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/GrassAlgorithmProvider.py#L47

and here for the GRASS 7 one

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7AlgorithmProvider.py#L47

that should help understand

Sure, sorry I was unclear: I meant general documentation about Python
plugins, not just processing.
A good theme for HF, right.

Hi all,
I find it very difficult to "click" with my fingers on individual points
on a web map done by qgis server, e.g.:
http://lizmap.faunalia.eu/index.php/view/map/?repository=faunalia&project=faunalia_it
On the desktop it's ok, because the pointer is much more precise than my
fingers.
Perhaps we should have a parameter of the cliackable area surrounding
the point?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo, 

A FI_XX_TOLERANCE parameter already exists, separate for POINTs,
LINESTRINGs and POLYGONS. It is up to the client to use it. See
http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog210/#feature-support-for-tolerance-parameter-in-wms-getfeatureinfo-requests
 

The ol3-mobile-viewer uses these tolerances already:
https://github.com/sourcepole/ol3-mobile-viewer/commit/3ecc228519dc2bd91402624a7f26232a26475d9d


Greetings,

This feature was apparently undocumented :(

I've added these info to the docs:

Thanks Alessandro for adding it to the documentation! 

Perhaps we can further work on QGIS server documentation in Girona? I
guess there is more undocumented stuff around. Is everything from
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/QGIS_Server_Tutorial
already in the QGIS manual (at first glance it looks like)? And all of
the recent improvements from 3Liz? 

Something to double check ... and then perhaps remove the old wiki page
about QGIS server. 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hello Andreas,

I've ported the old wiki page to the doc page [1] a few month ago but I
could have missed something.

+1 for removing the old wiki page or make RO and add a link to the doc page.

For any new feature that is added to the server code we should ask the
developers to complete the documentation, at least the vendor parameters
should be fully documented in the doc page.

Yes, please remove it as soon as possible.
I was looking for some informations two weeks ago about QGIS server and I
saw that page only. I've updated a few informations on the wiki page (about
GetPrint) ...

	Processing deadly slow
Message-ID: <5703D4BD.1050303@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
on several installation of 2.14.1 on Windows 10, the msys folder is
apparently missing. As a result (?), Processing is deadly slow when one
tries to filter alg names.
Is this a known issue?
Thanks.

The Processing being slow may be issue #14517 [1].  Some algorithms are executed with dummy values by the search and try to write empty "0" and "1" files into the folder QGIS is run from. Windows 10 users may not have write permissions on that folder (I guess QGIS is run from C:\wherever\bin?) , resulting in many tries before giving up. Setting write permissions to the folder, or running QGIS from another folder resolves the issue. (The issue is already fixed in master).

Not sure if that is a result as missing msys.  msys is not required anymore
(see [0]).

is it possible to provide `download_url` which links directly to
github, or do I need to create zip file manually?

Here is example of my repo [1]. Installing the plugin fails:

"""

Probably it's broken or missing from the repository. You may also want
to make sure that you have write permission to the plugin directory:

Hi Martin,

fyi, I just downloaded your
http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/osgeorel/qgis-plugins.xml?qgis=2.15
put in in my local /var/www/
added http://localhost/qgis-plugins.xml as a repo named 'test'
and just installed it flawlessly (having 4 buttons now in my toolbar)...

I first looked at the metadata of the plugin in the zip, and thought
that maybe the encoding/diacretic chars could be a problem.
But then I just tried to install as above and it worked..

So: not sure what exactly your issue is.
Are you in an proxied environment?
Do other plugins (from qgis repo) just install?

Regards,

Richard

Is there any way how to determine if the zip file is downloaded, where

No.

Yes. Thanks for your feedback, Martin

As in:
- downloading the qgis-plugins.xml and save it as a file in a local
webfolder
- then add the url to the xml as a repo url in qgis
- find the repo in the 'new plugins' list
- installed your plugin

This error comes from the plugin installer stuff:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/qgsplugininstallerinstallingdialog.py#L126

it looks like it is downloaded succesfully but failes to unzip?

From:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/pyplugin_installer/qgsplugininstallerinstallingdialog.py#L54-L57

it looks like it should be in your /tmp directory

maybe you can add some debug lines yourself in
qgsplugininstallerinstallingdialog.py ?

Regards,

Richard

Yes - this is a known issue.

Claus Sørensen wrote about this last month. I have had the same problems and did follow his recommendation. I wonder why QGIS want writing access to a program folder?.

I copy his mail here.

Hi everyone

On a QGIS workshop march 9. in Silkeborg, Denmark with 30+ enthusiastic newcomers to QGIS, we encountered 3 pc’s with extremely slow – tending to non-functional – search box in “Processing -> Toolbox”.

OS’es ranging from Win7, Win8.1 and Win10. Win7 and Win10 unknown version but with 2.14.0 also unknown bit  flavour.

My Win8.1 Pro in 64-bit with QGIS version 2.14.0  in 64 bit and no administrative rights.

By elevating security on the installation folder – in my case c:\Program Files\QGIS Essen\ - to allow users “change” rights, the search box became functional again – on every pc.

Emne: [Qgis-developer] Installation on Win10: msys missing? Then Processing deadly slow



Hi all,

on several installation of 2.14.1 on Windows 10, the msys folder is apparently missing. As a result (?), Processing is deadly slow when one tries to filter alg names.

Is this a known issue?

Thanks.

Thanks Lene, that worked.
IMHO we should publish an update ASAP (either of Processing or of QGIS), the issue is serious enough.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Save Vector Layer in QGIS through OGR with Value
	Relations
Message-ID: <653b29fbfe73b91ac44fb3b79e3fb067@carto.net>

Hi, 

Our users frequently ask for Spreadsheet export (xlsx, ods). This works
well with GDAL 2.x. 

However, we have the problem with value relations. For a traditional
value relation, in the main table we use integer codes, while the
textual values are in a linked table. In QGIS this is nicely replaced
with a readable text by the widget and in the attribute table. In print
composer we can use the get_feature() and attribute() expressions to get
to the text values. 

Could the OGR based export to spreadsheets be improved to optionally
replace the original integer codes with their text based values at
export, for columns where there are value relations? Would this be
feasible to implement as an option in QGIS? Would we need to change OGR
for that? 

Thanks for any ideas on that issue, 

Andreas

Hi paolo,

I remember I created a python script (in git repository) to change some
properties of a vector layer.

You could probably use it to assign projection.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Save Vector Layer in QGIS through OGR with
 Value Relations

Maybe QGIS could automatically create a VRT file or temporary virtual
layer in the background that automatically replaces the content of the
columns that have value relation widgets with the corresponding text
values? 

Would this be a solution or are there more elegant ways to solve that
problem? 

Thanks,

Hi Paolo,

"Assign projection" is a tool from GDALTools. Similar tool
from fTools was called "Define current projection". And this
tool also available in Processing.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zJ_5CLokfMAi4g+gsFh3drQbOuBDBMopxvR0q4LYL=Qg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I am trying to add support for QGIS variables in Processing, since
that can be a useful functionality. To start with, I want to add it to
scripts, so you can use the @variable syntax in Processing scripts as
well

It is easy to implement that, but the scope here is not so clear as in
other places in QGIS where variables are used. It would be nice to
have the project scope, but also the layer scope of the layers that
are used are input. I was thinking of using @variable for the project
scope and layername at variable for the layer scope, but before
introducing a new notation, I would like to get ideas and feedback
from you.

Of course, people writing scripts can get variables using the
QgsExpressionContextScope class...but i want to make it easier and
have it documented for script developers that do not want to  having
to dive in the QGIS API docs...

Please, feel free to comment and tell me what you think of this idea,
and how you think it would be better to implement it. In a second
step, support might be added to the algorithm dialogs, so inputs such
as numbers or strings can be entered using variables.

Thanks in advance!

That sounds like an interesting integration.

One question I have is if it's required to see variables as an isolated
topic outside of expressions. Or if whenever a variable is required, a
complete expression would offer much more flexibility.

I also think that it's often implicitly clear from the context an
expression appears in, which layer should be the source of the variables.

What are the use cases you have in mind?

Cheers
Matthias

That's actually a very good idea. As I said, now I am just trying to
start with this, and integration is scripts seems an easy first step,
but eventually, I would like to have support for variables (or even
better, full expressions) in the textboxes of the algorithm dialog

If an algorithm uses several layers, the algorithm context contains
those layers, and it should be possible to use variables from all of
them to set the other parameters of the algorithm.


> What are the use cases you have in mind?

No particular case for now. I am just trying to make Processing more
useful for automating all sort of operations within QGIS :-)

When populating text boxes which are layer independent in 90% global or
project variables will be what is required.

When populating text boxes which are layer dependent, the scope can be
appropriately populated and forcing the user to explicitly specify the
source layer wouldn't be very userfriendly.

For the other cases where a variable from an independent layer is
required, a new function layer_var('layername', 'varname') could be
introduced that does the background work and could also be used from
other expressions outside processing.

Hi all,
if I select one polygon and clip raster with polygon, saga clips only
the selected polygon, whereas gdal clips on the whole vector (not only
the selected item).
This is unexpected, but it is unclear whether it is a Processing problem
or a backend limitation: any hint?

Thanks Michael. However, I think this should be a core feature,

Matthias is right. If a user is trying to access a layer variable *outside*
of a single layer's context then they are doing things wrong and should be
using a project variable instead.

There really shouldn't be any need to access a layer variable outside of
the layer's scope (even via a function). Effectively they are like
protected variables in a c++ class. So layer dependant contexts (eg
labelling, symbology) can access them, but higher contexts (map canvas,
composer) can't.

I'd suggest just using the global and project scopes, and then adding the
layer scope only when the expression/value is used in a single layer
context.

Cool idea btw!

Maybe you could add a processing model scope that an individual model run
will temporarily store its own variables in. Then a new set variable
algorithm added, and also the option to store non spatial calculation
results in a variables. That + ability to use variables/expressions in
parameters would add a *ton* of new possibilities to models!

Message-ID: <CAFO80_oOV=w=au41mO_87BnYz_abfuD_aNS9r+zvv5VwD-ziWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

since 2.10 there is supprt to curves and Z/M... but some methods still
remain managing geometries in 2d way implicitly, eventually causing
incorrect calculations.

the realised the problem reading a Nyall commit
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4c704be60636b8f9994cb7aabb7d9da64c5093ab
There you can read comments.

in this commit (and probably in a lot other places) all vertex
distances are calculated as proyected in 2d, obviously creating error
if Z is present => routing algs could be affected.

as Nyall suggests, there are some questions related to this commit...
but IMHO wider questions related with the complete V2 geometry
support.

"""
Could we move this discussion to the dev list for wider exposure? I
don't work with 3d geometries often enough to have a strong opinion
about what the correct behaviour is. I figure there's 4 options:

always do 2d calculations
always use 3d calculations if z present
rename these methods to distanceToVertex2d and add seperate 3d methods
(clutters API)
add an extra bool parameter for ignoring/considering z values (more
confusing API)
"""

let us know your opinion

Message-ID: <57064B02.7060100@opengis.ch>

Hi,

We experience more travis timeouts (for qt4 builds) recently.

With respect to reducing false alarms to a minimum I think it would be
good to fix things.

I think there are two approaches, removing some components from the
build process, but I cannot see what.

Use ccache like we do for Qt5 builds. That would require recompiling
some deps (currently taken from ubuntugis) so they can be put into the
home directory, since for ccache we need to run container based builds.

Other ideas?

Hi,

Sorry for double posting, but my first message is waiting for moderation 
because of attach file size...

I am trying to import a PostGis layer into a SpatiaLite database, using 
QGIS Database Manager import function.

The PostGis layer has a string primary key, and I want to keep that 
primary key.

To keep the primary key, I check "Primary key" option and type the name 
of the PostGis primary key field, but the result is an empty column...
I tried to workaround this problem by keeping primary key values in a 
second column and getting them back after the import, this used to work 
with QGIS V2.8, but doesn't anymore with QGIS V2.14.

Here is the result I get :
- When opened in QGIS Database Manager, I can see correct values in the 
id column.
- When opened in QGIS, every record has the same id value.

So my questions are :
- Why isn't it possible to keep PostGis primary key when importing to 
SpatiaLite with QGIS Database Manager ?
- How to workaround this problem ?

Thank you for helping,

	produces an error
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMLpSCj=5Z5ku2Swo_JzpMdYUqngoZm14FucyLYRzxhxjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to digitize new features to a multipolygon PostGIS table which
geometry column is defined as geometry(multipolygon, 3067).

When I create a new feature and digitize one polygon, add some data to
fields and finally click save layer edits button I get the following error
message:
PostGIS error while adding features: ERROR: Geometry type
(GeometryCollection) does not match column type (MultiPolygon).

Am I doing something wrong or should I file a ticket?

I'm working on QGIS 2.14.1., PostgreSQL 9.3.12 an PostGIS 2.1.7 combo.


Thanks,

-Lauri

I think I had an issue with my snapping options.
I had "avoid intersections" checked for wrong layers so actually I got null
geometries that were geometrycollections.

Sorry for the noise!

Use docker to avoid deps builds ? Not sure if/how travis supports
this. Pretty sure gitlab-ci does (in case you plan to add a mirror
there).

Docker is supported but not on container based builds

Can't you chose the docker to use as the base, for container based
builds ? What I was suggesting is that you prepare "qgis testing"
dockers to use as base.

Hi all,
sorry if I'm repeating known issues. I just finished a course, and I
found some things I do not understand (of course, it's Windows!):
* why do we have two desktops, one with and one without grass?
* Processing asks for a msys folder, and gives an error until the path
is removed from config; as Juergen explained, msys is no longer
required, so why is Processing asking for it?
* AFAIK now on Windows we only have grass 6: why then we still have a
grass (assumed 6) in Processing?
* the links in the grass help from Processing do not seem to work.
I understand these are all minor issues, but can be pretty confusing
especially for newbies.
All the best, and thanks for an explanation.

Looking at this right now.

Already fixed. GRASS 7 is default now, and GRASS 6 can be enabled
if necessary.

If I'm not wrong, support for GRASS help was added only for GRASS 7
as it is the default GRASS version now.

Do we really need to have it? Shouldn't we deprecate it? I think it
confuses the users, and at least on windows it is pointless to support it.

>>> * the links in the grass help from Processing do not seem to work.
>>

Sorry I was unclear: grass help is there. However, in the man pages
there are many links to further documentation (very useful stuff for
professional work), that used to be working, but now are clickable but
apparently go nowhere (do not open a browser, nor a page).

One more issue:

* creating slope and other rasters from the exercise
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/tree/master/source/docs/training_manual/exercise_data/processing/more_backends
results in a custom projection (10921 or something similar) on Windows,
whereas it's the correct 3003 on Debian. I recall an old problem, that
was fixed - any explanation why it resurfaced?

I suppose this one is for Juergen, I repeat there for completeness:

>> * why do we have two desktops, one with and one without grass?

Thanks to all.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Zonal statistics generates wrong numbers?
Message-ID: <570699BD.2090705@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
generating zonal stats from processing (the qgis command) results in
numbers that are not correctly sorted (see attached).
I'm puzzled, any explanation?
All the best, and thanks.

if you are speking about GRASS then is an old outstanding issue in Processing:
+towgs84 parameters are always stripped from output CRSs.

I think we should keep it at least until it is available via OSGeo4W and
installed by default in some distributions like Debian stable.

Hmm, now Processing uses local files and if they are not available starts
browser with internet help. Maybe issue in help files itself, not in the
Processing. I will try to look at this.

Hello Paolo,

for GRASS7 I have made a (merged) Pull-Request 
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2872) to use local help whenever it 
is installed on the system.
But it was only for GRASS7, not GRASS6...

I have made some tests on MS-Windows (at least XP and 7) and I had to 
use a Qurl, just to be sure to open a local link (file:///).

On Debian Stretch, I have no problem either: whenever grass-doc package 
is installed, Processing use the local documentation files and when you 
click on a link, it opens the local file.

What is the URI of the link in the local help page (you can retrieve it 
with a right-click and copy link) ?

Cheers...

correct: so why on Debian I do not see the issue, and the layer is
correctly produced as EPSG:3003?

a good reason to keep grass6 in processing is because there is
r.mapcalculator, that is gone in grass7. Now in master we have
r.mapcalc, but the last time I tried there were still a few issues,
maybe fixed already. Using QGIS raster calc is almost not an option.

Hi Giovanni,
I understand this, but we do *not* have g6 on windows at least, only the
Processing provider, right?
All the best, and thanks.

I was unaware it is still available in Osgeo4w; then it makes sense to
keep it, thanks for clarifying.

You can build on any docker image but I don't know which dependencies we
could put in there that would reduce build time notably.

The "container based builds" happen on a standard container but have the
advantage that ccache can be persisted between builds (without us taking
care of storage).

In OSGeo4W there is a QGIS package that comes with a shortcut and doesn't
require GRASS.  And there a packages for the GRASS plugin for GRASS6 and 7 that
both come with a shortcut that uses the corresponding GRASS version.

No, 6 & 7.  But we have builds for Linux that have either GRASS version.

Thanks Juergen for the explanation. I have seen users find this
confusing. Wouldn't it be easier to have just one package with grass7?
All the best.

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A280570D18BF1@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi!

I have a user who constantly get a yellow warning from QGIS when he enables editing on set of specific shape files. The message is:

DigitizingTools: Amend Line is disabled because layer CRS and project CRS do not match!

The project CRS is EPSG:25832. The shape file has the following .prj file:

PROJCS["ETRS_1989_UTM_Zone_32N",GEOGCS["GCS_ETRS_1989",DATUM["D_ETRS_1989",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",500000.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",9.0],PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",0.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

In "layer properties/General/Coordinate reference system", QGIS displays "Selected CRS (EPSG: 3044, ETRS89 / ETRS-TM32".

If he enables editing on a shape file with the following .prj file, it doesn't happen:

PROJCS["ETRS89_UTM_zone_32N",GEOGCS["GCS_ETRS_1989",DATUM["D_ETRS_1989",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

The strange thing is that this only happens on his computer not on a couple of other machines we have tried on.

If there indeed is a CRS mismatch it make sense, but he is the only of our users experiencing this.

Hi Casper,

DigitizingTools compares _only_ the SRS-id (SRS = 
SpatialReferenceSystem) of the project and the layer. If they missmatch 
the warning is thrown so the user gets a hint why certain functions are 
greyed out.
Thus relevant is not the prj file but the SRS assigned to the layer and 
the project in their properties. To solve this issue: if they share a 
common projection, go in the layer properties and choose the same SRS as 
the project's from the list of projections.
Background (AFAIK): In Shapefiles the data do not carry information on 
their SRS (like e.g. in PostGIS or gml). This information is contained 
in the (optional) prj file. QGIS reads the prj file and assigns the 
first matching SRS to the data (matching = definition is identical). If 
there is none matching, a USER-SRS is created with the projection 
information given in the prj file.

Hi Bernhard

Thanks for your answer.

Yes I know that QGIS tries hard to determine the SRS-id which matches the values of the PRJ file. But my main issue is why it displays the warning only on one computer and not the others (same QGIS project with same data)?

Which mechanisms could trigger the difference in whether the warning should be shown or not?

We are running QGIS 2.14.0 64 bit on Windows 7.

Hi Casper,

DigitizingTools compares _only_ the SRS-id (SRS =
SpatialReferenceSystem) of the project and the layer. If they missmatch the warning is thrown so the user gets a hint why certain functions are greyed out.
Thus relevant is not the prj file but the SRS assigned to the layer and the project in their properties. To solve this issue: if they share a common projection, go in the layer properties and choose the same SRS as the project's from the list of projections.
Background (AFAIK): In Shapefiles the data do not carry information on their SRS (like e.g. in PostGIS or gml). This information is contained in the (optional) prj file. QGIS reads the prj file and assigns the first matching SRS to the data (matching = definition is identical). If there is none matching, a USER-SRS is created with the projection information given in the prj file.

Hi Casper,

no idea why they behave differently. Are the settings for the layer's 
SRS on both machines the same?
As I wrote, the warning is shown if there is a missmatch in the 
project's and the layer's SRS-id.

Hi Bernhard

Since its the same QGIS project were opening on the different computers, I would expect them to behave the same. The current CRS (as stated in the bottom right of the QGIS window) is EPSG:25832 (OTF).

I tried replacing the PRJ file of problematic shape file with the PRJ from the working shape file (see the first mail), but QGIS still displays the warning.

Hi Casper,

I meant the CRS set in the layer's properties for the layer in question. 
As you said both are using the same project so the project's CRS should 
be the same in both cases.
In your first mail you state that the project's CRS is EPSG:25832 and 
the layer's is EPSG:3044. There is the missmatch. Change this to 
EPSG:25832 and all is fine. Check if the layer's CRS has been set to 
EPSG:25832 on the working computer.
If the very same layer loads into the very same project with different 
CRS on different machines then this is a question of QGIS in general and 
has nothing to do with DigitizingTools (which is just pointing out the 
difference).

Hi Bernhard

I do follow your suggestions and they make perfectly sense. This is a warning and I can probably safely disregard it in this case. I'm more curious to discover why two computers using the same OS and QGIS version seems to handle the CRS difference differently. My initial mail was not specifically directed at DigitizingTools but it is (from the user point of view) the source of the warning.

What I suspect is that some setting somewhere, inside or outside QGIS, might lead QGIS to behave differently - and I am curious to know :)


Regards Casper

Hi Casper,

I meant the CRS set in the layer's properties for the layer in question. 
As you said both are using the same project so the project's CRS should be the same in both cases.
In your first mail you state that the project's CRS is EPSG:25832 and the layer's is EPSG:3044. There is the missmatch. Change this to
EPSG:25832 and all is fine. Check if the layer's CRS has been set to
EPSG:25832 on the working computer.
If the very same layer loads into the very same project with different CRS on different machines then this is a question of QGIS in general and has nothing to do with DigitizingTools (which is just pointing out the difference).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add a WHERE clause to field calculator
Message-ID: <27d4dcc55fd83232fc202019a9e4d612@carto.net>

Hi, 

Would it be possible to add a "WHERE" clause to the field calculator?
Currently, if you want to update a subset of the records you would have
to do a two-step producedure: 

1. Make a selection 

2. Open field calculator and use the checkbox "only update selected
features". 

I think, in some workflows it would be more efficient if one had a text
input area where one can enter a WHERE clause and the field calculator
would respect the WHERE clause, if filled in. It would reduce the
two-step operation into a one or 1.5 step operation, so more efficient.
If you have to update based on multiple different subsets it would be
even more efficient. 

Would this be a useful enhancement to more users? Esp. for those who
know SQL ;-) ? 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

Yeah - I know about the CASE WHEN possibility, which is great if you
want to do it all in one statement, but I think the WHERE section would
still be useful for people familiar with databases and who want to set
different values to different subsets one by one, without having to
leave the field calculator.

Can't use the field calc bar without having to leave the attribute table?

Run the selection
Use the bar
Run different selection
etc

Hi guys,
Hi Richard and Matthias,

as you suggested I have managed and integrate the Makefile that updates 
the strings and compile them in the qm file.

However I'm experience a very weird behavior. Some string (I'm sure that 
are translatable) that I have translated in the ts file are not 
translated. That is that for some string the compilation from ts to qm 
"fails".

That is weird because it happens not with all the strings. I noticed 
that it happens with **all** the QTextBrowser object (again I'm sure 
that the html are translated) and with some QLabel.

I tried also to simply run lrelease (hoping the problem was with the 
Makefile) but again, some strings are compiled some not.

Do you have an idea why this could happen?

Many thanks

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PostGIS queries slow when in edit mode
Message-ID: <9C9E35A883C74941B55C4798458F250206D5B8955B@WSMAILBOX.egmasa.es>

Hi!
I'm developing a plugin for QGIS. When the user selects a feature, it queries a few other layers from Postgis to fill in a form with related data.
The queries are slow, unless I check the option to run queries server-side. After that, the queries run instantaneously. Yay!
However, if the layers are put in edit mode, the queries are slow again! :(
After checking the Postgis logs it seems that the run queries server-side option has no effect when the layers are in edit mode.
Does anyone know whether it is a known, well-founded limitation or a bug?

Regards, Manuel

Hi Manuel, 

QGIS already has built-in relation support (1:n and n:m) - they should
support server side queries. Do you really need to write your own
plugin? Are the built-in relations not good enough?

Hi Casper -

AFAIK,  All QGIS projection-definitions is stored in in a Sqlite 
database <qgis maindir>\apps\qgis\resources\srs.db

This database is initialized at the time of QGIS installation. This 
process might have been slightly different for the computers involved, 
so the different srs.db's have a sligthly different content (ex. 
different sort order or different content in some of the tables..)

You could try to copy the srs db from one the computers, that's working 
OK and overwrite the srs.db on the malfunctioning computer. I assume the 
QGIS version is the same for all the computer involved.

DISCLAIMER !

  * This might not have any kind of influence!
  * This might destroy your QGIS installation!
  * You might be struck by lightning from the QGIS gods (or whatnot;-)

So use it with caution and have a backup of the original srs.db handy

Regards

Bo Victor Thomsen

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing: gdal_translate fails on Windows if no
 output filename is chosen
Message-ID: <5708AE92.3060705@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
on Windows (both 7 and 10), Clip layer by extent fails if no explicit
output filename is given. The problem seems the output file type:

gdal_translate -of "ESRI Shapefile" -ot Float32 -projwin 323590.0
4698482.5 326815.0 4696072.5 D:/dtm_20m_32/w001001.adf

GDAL command output:
ERROR 6: Source driver is raster-only whereas output driver is vector-only
Input file size is 52281, 67098
Computed -srcwin 684 28640 161 121 from projected window.

Same command on Debian runs soothly:

gdal_translate -of GTiff -ot Float32 -projwin 1622806.32194
4869136.67909 1658315.41285 4833134.40636 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co

Anyone confirms? Should I open a ticket?

All the best.

A futher note..

The two projections 3044 and 25832 are *identical* regarding the proj4 
parameterdefinitions in the srs.db database, so QGIS might get confused 
when it opens a datasource, where the projection definition for the 
datasource is based on proj4.

See 
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/115690/difference-between-etrs89-etrs-tm32-and-etrs89-utm-zone-32n 


You could do some kind of "cowboy" trick and remove the reference to 
3044 from the srs.db database, table tbl_srs. The warnings from last 
post still apply :-)

OK, better check, it works - I just hit a broken link, by bad luck, in
the original manual.
Sorry for the noise, and thanks for the help.

yes, I know. My question was if you are planning to package QGIS with
ubuntugis dependecies also for newer Ubuntu, at least upcoming Xenial?
The ubuntugis-unstable now contains up-to-date GRASS. Thanks, Martin

Sure, if there are some rewarding dependencies - so far there's only saga for
xenial, which isn't even a build dependency.  And for wily there's also only
is GRASS 7.0.3 (which ubuntu already includes), ossim and saga (which are no
build dependencies).

I looked at this issue more closely, and you are right, the plugin
manager downloads from [1] a HTML with redirection message:

<html><body>You are being <a
href="https://codeload.github.com/ctu-osgeorel-proj/bp-pesek-2016/zip/master">redirected</a>.</body></html>

I fixed the issue by using
`https://codeload.github.com/ctu-osgeorel-proj/bp-pesek-2016/zip/master`.

Cheers, Ma

It seems that g.copy is not avalilable in GRASS Plugin, QGIS 2.14.1
is this a "bug" or am i missing something?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using app MessageBar from providers ?
Message-ID: <201604101512.21487.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

For the WFS provider, I'd like some messages, like a partial feature download, 
to be emitted in a more prominent way than just in the message log. The 
MessageBar would be appropriate for that, but from what I can see, it is not 
currently possible for a provider to use it. A search in src/providers shows 
that the same need was at least encountered once in the GRASS provider but the 
code is commented out as the provider doesn't link against qgis_app.

So unless there's a good reason for a provider not to be able to use the 
message bar, I was thinking to the following mechanism to implement it :
- QgsMessageLog would be extended to have 2 extra arguments bool 
displayInMessagerBar = false, int duration = 0 in logMessage() / 
messageReceived()
- QgisApp would connect on messageReceived() and when the boolean is set, it 
would push the message to the main message bar.

Any thoughts ?

Even

Yes I know. Hence my proposal. The provider would continue using the message 
log interface, so with its current behaviour still preserved, but with an 
extra hint when the message is also aimed at being prominently displayed, if 
possible. In the case qgis_app is started it would listen for that and 
redirect the message to the message bar too.

It does not but this is not the problem, i notice
that i cannot start g.copy from GRASS itself using
the shell, so it's not a "GRASS Plugin" issue but more
a GRASS GIS issue,

sorry and thaks anyway, roy

Hi,

I just tested the Browser in QGIS. It has indeed no "Copy" in the context menu, just "Rename",  "Delete" or New vector layer.
However, Drag and Drop works fine. So if you want to copy a GRASS map, just drag it from the source to destination Mapset. Source and destination can be the same. If a map exists you are asked to specify a name...

Hence, g.copy is not present in the GRASS plugin in QGIS.

For me (QGIS 2.14.0, GRASS 7.0.3, OSGeo4W), g.copy starts also on the commandline. However, if you want to open the module GUI like that you have to run:
g.copy --ui

Cheers
Stefan

Hey Even,

I think this solution is fine. The other option I thought of in the past
was to have some kind of signal on the provider that gets passed up and
connected at a higher level.
Using QgsMessageLog is a good idea as it's generic and can be used by
everyone.

Hi,

That sounds a bit weird to me.

Shouldn't it be the application which decide (filter) what to show from
core log messages?
Couldn't we use some error levels or tags to achieve this?

That just doesn't sound like a good API to have core function with
displayMessage as argument.

But maybe I'm missing a part of the picture.

Hi,

it might be even easier to completely delete the prj file and either 
manually or by default set the layer's projection to the project's 
projection (as I understood they are both identical).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Developing original spatial database : retrieving
 geometry column information via ODBC connection
Message-ID: <CA+_nsP+FHEyBm9orC6rvbb1dgQiMuFgdR_XrFvu29aJtmd1ONA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there.

I have a question while adding retrieving vector layer from a spatial
database.
Actually our company has its own spatial DBMS product, name's Kairos.
Problem is, we want to make our product working with QGIS.

Here's the question:
When adding vector layer via odbc connection, the list of tables is shown
after setting information for odbc connection.
But in the list, the column 'geometry types' says 'Unknown' although table
has geometry column in it.

I want to fix this by modifying our own DBMS or QGIS itself if it's needed.
I set debugging environment for QGIS in Visual Studio 2010, Windows.

Where can I start?
Does anyone know which code is involved in retrieving geometry information
from database?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <570B4C1B.6040304@oslandia.com>

Announcing WIP for a slider providing a way to zoom the canvas, like a
magnifier does.

A use case is for example to facilitate the manual placement of small
labels.

A way to set up this tool is planned too (minimum, maximum and step).

Let me know if you have any comments.

Hey Paul,

Interesting.  Have you considering something that follows the cursor as
well?

Sounds fantastic!

I'm curious what approach you are taking with this -  can you provide some
details?

Hi Nathan,

> as well?

Yes, we thought about it. However, after discussion, we conclude that it
would be
easier for the user to work on the zoomed canvas (like moving a label)
if he has a global point
of view,instead of having a local zoom.

What do you think?

Regards,
Paul

I'd agree. Zooming with the canvas might be useful for quickly seeing
more detail, but I don't think it would work very well for interaction
with the map.

Just realised I hadn't announced this work on the list yet....

You can see some work in progress videos here:

and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mkqUXeOnc&nohtml5=False

Still to add is a preview of how the gradient will look as discrete

so any suggestions on the layout would be appreciated!

Message-ID: <20160411081818.GA16040@localhost>

FYI, I've pushed an .editorconfig file in qgis master branch.
The file is a generic editor configuration supported by many
editors, either implicitly or via some plugin.

See http://editorconfig.org/ for info about supported syntax
and how to enable support for it in your editor.

The configuration I pushed requests LF line endings,
a final newline, utf8 encoding and space indent.

I know scripts/prepare-commit.sh already takes care of style
and this is not meant as a replacement, but it might be
helpful to get some of that _while_ editing a file.

Note that this feature would also include a default global value, so
that users on 4K+ screens can set it to avoid pixel-sized element being
too small.

Hi, Andreas, thanks for your help.
We tried the built-in relation support, combined with the edit widgets and form view. Is that what you mean? Powerful features as they are, they don’t fit our needs, however. There are quite a few tables, with two-level relationships; the generated forms and the workflow using the built-in solution is still too complex for our digitizers daily work. We also had doubts regarding to how to handle referential integrity constraints in edit mode. That’s why we finally decided to build our own plugin.
In any case, I have taken a look at it again; it feels somewhat slower than our solution when not editing, and roughly the same in edit mode (no measures, though, just my first subjective impressions).

Hi Manuel,

QGIS already has built-in relation support (1:n and n:m) - they should support server side queries. Do you really need to write your own plugin? Are the built-in relations not good enough?

Hi!
I'm developing a plugin for QGIS. When the user selects a feature, it queries a few other layers from Postgis to fill in a form with related data.
The queries are slow, unless I check the option to run queries server-side. After that, the queries run instantaneously. Yay!
However, if the layers are put in edit mode, the queries are slow again! :(
After checking the Postgis logs it seems that the run queries server-side option has no effect when the layers are in edit mode.
Does anyone know whether it is a known, well-founded limitation or a bug?

Hi Manuel,

instead of developping a new plugin my plugin DataDrivenInputMask [1] 
might suit your needs. It handles all kinds of relations and referential 
integrity out of the box (if thoroughly defined in the DB). Tickets, 
feedback, feature requests welcome.

Bernhard

QgsMessageLog has the following error levels : INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL. (I couldn't really find a description of the semantics behind by the way)
QgsMessageBar has the same + SUCCESS.
The default level of QgsMessageLog::logMessage() is WARNING, and greping in the source shows that in most cases, it is let to the default.

Tags (as defined in QgsMessageLog) indicate the component from which the messages comes from, so I don't think they can be used for redirect to message bar.

CRITICAL is very rarely used, as shown by the following grep in src/ , so if we don't want
to have an explicit displayMessage argument, potentially the app could decide to redirect only CRITICAL messages to the MessageBar ?

$ grep -r QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL ../src/ | grep -v "src/server"
../src/core/qgsproject.cpp:      QgsMessageLog::logMessage( errorString, QString::null, QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL );
../src/core/qgsgml.cpp:        QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL
../src/core/qgsgml.cpp:      QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL
../src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp:      QgsMessageLog::logMessage( tr( "Possible corruption after REPACK detected. %1 still exists. This may point to a permission or locking problem of the original 
DBF." ).arg( packedDbf ), tr( "OGR" ), QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL );
../src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp:          QgsMessageLog::logMessage( tr( "Original layer could not be reopened." ), tr( "OGR" ), QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL );
../src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp:        QgsMessageLog::logMessage( tr( "Original datasource could not be reopened." ), tr( "OGR" ), QgsMessageLog::CRITICAL );

The precise use case is when the download of a WFS layer fails for some reason (network timeout, invalid server response),
it is not always obvious for the user to realize so. A prominent message saying that
the layer content is truncated would be helpful so he can decide for example to reload
the layer, etc...

Message-ID: <CALuHMPDMBMF884dPKvq2asWwuH5c7XeQTT9pw=s3D9F8uvVn3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

and sorry for cross-posting.

When cleaning Processing bug queue I found issue [0] about preserving
joined fields in Procesing outputs. Before implementing this I want to hear
opinions, does it makes sense at all or better to leave things as is: output
layer contains only provider (non-joined, not virtual) fields from input layer?

Thanks

Yes, it would be easier, but can be done only if all QGIS/GRASS users
switched already to GRASS 7.

Yes, drag-and-drop in the browser is g.copy replacement, hopefully
sufficient. It calls g.copy BTW.

Hi all,
My QGIS 2.14.1 started abruptly to replace
<datasource>dbname='
with
<datasource>../../../dbname='
For all layers but the last one I added.
Anyone has an explanation for this?
Thanks a lot.

Hi,

This functionality is "offered" by ESRI with a different approach (not sure
if it's better or worst tho). The user can set/lock a reference scale to be
used in the map canvas, after that, the normal zoom tools will work just as
before (follow the cursor, drag to zoom a certain area, etc) but the
symbols will enlarge/reduce in proportion to "current scale" vs "reference
scale ratio". This provides a very good way to edit features and set styles
with the output scale in mind.

Hi,

We are getting the same experience as Manuel on 2.14.1 and we are using
only standard relations.
Feature forms open instantly when not in edit mode and takes 10 seconds
when edit mode is toggled on.

Hi Bo

I tried the opposite of your suggestion and replaced my srs.db with the srs.db from the computer which displays the warning. I didn’t get any warnings, but I will try your suggestion when I get the chance.

The QGIS versions are the same, v. 2.14.0.

Hi Casper -

AFAIK,  All QGIS projection-definitions is stored in in a Sqlite database <qgis maindir>\apps\qgis\resources\srs.db

This database is initialized at the time of QGIS installation. This process might have been slightly different for the computers involved, so the different srs.db's have a sligthly different content (ex. different sort order or different content in some of the tables..)

You could try to copy the srs db from one the computers, that's working OK and overwrite the srs.db on the malfunctioning computer. I assume the QGIS version is the same for all the computer involved.

DISCLAIMER !

  *   This might not have any kind of influence!
  *   This might destroy your QGIS installation!
  *   You might be struck by lightning from the QGIS gods (or whatnot;-)
So use it with caution and have a backup of the original srs.db handy

Hi Bernhard



I do follow your suggestions and they make perfectly sense. This is a warning and I can probably safely disregard it in this case. I'm more curious to discover why two computers using the same OS and QGIS version seems to handle the CRS difference differently. My initial mail was not specifically directed at DigitizingTools but it is (from the user point of view) the source of the warning.



What I suspect is that some setting somewhere, inside or outside QGIS, might lead QGIS to behave differently - and I am curious to know :)

Hi Casper,



I meant the CRS set in the layer's properties for the layer in question.

As you said both are using the same project so the project's CRS should be the same in both cases.

In your first mail you state that the project's CRS is EPSG:25832 and the layer's is EPSG:3044. There is the missmatch. Change this to

EPSG:25832 and all is fine. Check if the layer's CRS has been set to

EPSG:25832 on the working computer.

If the very same layer loads into the very same project with different CRS on different machines then this is a question of QGIS in general and has nothing to do with DigitizingTools (which is just pointing out the difference).

Hi Bernhard



Since its the same QGIS project were opening on the different computers, I would expect them to behave the same. The current CRS (as stated in the bottom right of the QGIS window) is EPSG:25832 (OTF).



I tried replacing the PRJ file of problematic shape file with the PRJ from the working shape file (see the first mail), but QGIS still displays the warning.

Hi Casper,



no idea why they behave differently. Are the settings for the layer's SRS on both machines the same?

As I wrote, the warning is shown if there is a missmatch in the project's and the layer's SRS-id.



Bernhard

Hi Bernhard



Thanks for your answer.



Yes I know that QGIS tries hard to determine the SRS-id which matches the values of the PRJ file. But my main issue is why it displays the warning only on one computer and not the others (same QGIS project with same data)?



Which mechanisms could trigger the difference in whether the warning should be shown or not?



We are running QGIS 2.14.0 64 bit on Windows 7.

Hi Casper,



DigitizingTools compares _only_ the SRS-id (SRS =

SpatialReferenceSystem) of the project and the layer. If they missmatch the warning is thrown so the user gets a hint why certain functions are greyed out.

Thus relevant is not the prj file but the SRS assigned to the layer and the project in their properties. To solve this issue: if they share a common projection, go in the layer properties and choose the same SRS as the project's from the list of projections.

Background (AFAIK): In Shapefiles the data do not carry information on their SRS (like e.g. in PostGIS or gml). This information is contained in the (optional) prj file. QGIS reads the prj file and assigns the first matching SRS to the data (matching = definition is identical). If there is none matching, a USER-SRS is created with the projection information given in the prj file.

Hi!



I have a user who constantly get a yellow warning from QGIS when he enables editing on set of specific shape files. The message is:



DigitizingTools: Amend Line is disabled because layer CRS and project CRS do not match!



The project CRS is EPSG:25832. The shape file has the following .prj file:



PROJCS["ETRS_1989_UTM_Zone_32N",GEOGCS["GCS_ETRS_1989",DATUM["D_ETRS

In "layer properties/General/Coordinate reference system", QGIS displays "Selected CRS (EPSG: 3044, ETRS89 / ETRS-TM32".



If he enables editing on a shape file with the following .prj file, it doesn't happen:



PROJCS["ETRS89_UTM_zone_32N",GEOGCS["GCS_ETRS_1989",DATUM["D_ETRS_19

The strange thing is that this only happens on his computer not on a couple of other machines we have tried on.



If there indeed is a CRS mismatch it make sense, but he is the only of our users experiencing this.

Thanks, Bernhard

I didn’t know about your plugin, I’m taking a look at it.
However, in this particular case, we are going to stick to our decision. There are many features, such as validation and templating, that we would likely add in the future, and I don’t think that any generic 3rd party solution will fit all our requirements.

My main concern was about the difference in performance. Does anyone know whether it is a known, well-founded limitation or a bug?

I just felt the right thing to do was to ask here before opening a bug ticket, just in case it was unnecessary or there was a workaround.

This happens if the project paths are set to relative. changing it to
absolute "fixes" it.
if somenone could check, I can open a ticket.

Oh, I didn't realize that existed. Thanks ! I'll have to do some signal 
forwarding since the error is emitted from an object that is a bit 
disconnected from the provider itself, but that should be doable.

Testing quickly, I see that pushError() only pushes to the message bar and not 
the message log. Is it really intended ?

Another potential issue with the current implementation, that isn't a problem 
in my current use case, is that pushError() is without effect if called from 
the provider constructor, since the raiseError() signal of the provider can of 
course be forwarded to the layer raiseError() only after construction. 
Probably that QgsVectorLayer::setDataProvider() should examine the list of 
errors just after constructing the data provider and raise them.

It appears that a clean configpath does not have the same issue, so it
may be a plugin.
Hunting it down will not be easy, as I istall most of them for testing.

Hi all

I think we could have an option to allow keeping the joined fields, uncheck
by default.
This way the user will be able to choose.

Hi all,

this happens also on a clean config, deb package from our repo, so I
cannot understand how it can be a local issue: anyone confirms or
denies? Any hint on how I can debug it?

Got it! I start from a clean --configpath, so I assumed to have no
additional svg folders. In fact, there is my homedir, which explains the
huge time to scan it.
IMHO --configpath should not add a custom svg dir, so this should be a
bug in itself, am I right?
Thanks Mathieu!

Hm, I thought I saw 7.0.3 last time - but 7.0.1 isn't all different, is it?

Message-ID: <607310642.1455.1460468632231@office.mailbox.org>

Hi devs!

Within the German user community there is a discussion going on about how to effectively support the fixing of several issues with some essential vector geo-processing tools (e.g. intersection, clip, join attributes) that we think have to work without flaws. [0]
But because of the modular structure of processing and tools in QGIS in general, this topic can also be seen in a broader context. The ftools for example have just been removed in favour of the processing tool box (QEP 36) [1]. 
So in order to make a good investment decision we would like to know, if there are already further plans on your side to consolidate, rewrite or replace (some) geo-processing tools in/for QGIS, which eventually also solve these issues. Would it then make (more) sense to start a crowd funding campaign for this - instead of funding short term fixes on maybe soon deprecated code?

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,
thanks for this. May I suggest to invest, first and foremost, in a
complete set of tests for Processing? Having this will make it possible
to constantly rely on Processing across versions; without it we always
risk to get wrong or no results from our analyses.
A testing infrastructure is already in place for some algs, what we need
is a better coverage. The nice thing is that part of this job can be
daone by power users, without have to rely uniquely on core developers.
Sounds attractive?
All the best.

Message-ID: <1460473833344-5260900.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
I´m merging a few thousand features and QGIS has been working on it for a
while now, which brought me to think of CUDA/OpenCL support. Are there any
plans on implementing OpenCL or CUDA in QGIS? I have only found a few older
discussions on this matter.

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Using-the-power-of-GPU-OpenCL-td4101642.html

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Very-slow-performance-with-large-SHP-files-with-over-200k-objects-td4132665.html#a4132679

I guess this is a rather complex task, but speeding up data processing in
QGIS would of course be beneficial when working with large data sets.

Best regards,

Magnus

Can I just add a BBOX querystring variable to the URL? Does that disable

Yes, adding BBOX does the trick. Sorry for the noise.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Insert/Update in existing layers using Processing
Message-ID: <570D1901.5080404@camptocamp.com>


Hello,

Actually in QGIS, updating an existing layer with data coming from other 
layers, files or processing output is not trivial.
=> It is possible to copy/paste features from one layer to another, but 
no user friendly possibility to define fields mapping.
=> Processing algorithms always create new layers, but do not give the 
possibility to update an existing one.
=> "Import to Postgis" algorithm can be used for table creation too, no 
updating options.
=> DB Manager have the same limitations.

We want to improve this in QGIS and we have some propositions (see below).
Let me know what you think about this. Should we create a QEP ?


        1 - Create a new processing algorithm "Import into existing layer"

This algorithm would give the possibility to update / insert into an 
existing layer,
with data coming from file, loaded layer or processing output .
This would give the possibility to wrote, from processing, to any type 
of datasource that support writing.

     Here's the inputs :
         Source layer (vector): Vector layer for reading
         Source identifier (field): Primary key in source layer

         Destination layer (vector) : Vector layer for writing
         Destination identifier (field) : Primary key in destination layer

         Insert new features (checkbox) : Insert new features in 
destination layer.
         Update existing features (checkbox) : Update existing features 
in destination layer.
         Delete features (checkbox) : Should features, that do not exits 
in source, be deleted from destination ?

     No output, as a result, inserted and updated features could be 
selected.

The identifier fields give a one/one relationship between source and 
destination layer.

Regarding the writing method, I see two possibilities :

     * Use the edition buffer, the user could see the result before 
saving to disk or database.
         Note that this could use a lot of memory in case of treating a 
lot of data.

     * Use directly the provider methods.

Maybe we could propose a choice between this two methods.

Thereafter, the user should expect a field mapper from the source to the 
destination (possibly with the use of expressions).
For exporting, we can use the refactorfield as an final output algorithm.
For importing, fields already exists on destination, here it should be 
simpler than refactorfield mapper.
Note that we will not have source/destination fields definition in all 
cases, only for loaded layers.


        2 - Update input layer with "Import into existing layer" after
        existing algorithms


As a second time, we could add an option on some existing algorithm,
     with only one input layer,
     that do not change fields definition,
that add a checkbox or output option in algorithm dialog, to update the 
input layer as an output.

For example, I want to make a buffer on a selection in a loaded vector 
layer.
In most case, I want this to be done on the source layer, not in a new 
layer.
Processing do not give this possibility for now.

What I propose is not to change existing algorithms, but to add an 
output option in the dialog.
As a result, after running the base algorithm, an import would be done 
using the feature Id as a primary key to update the input layer using 
edition buffer.

This would be user friendly for common operations on existing layers.


        3 - Propose a field mapping for paste operation

This take place on the c++ part of QGIS, in the Edit / Paste features 
(Ctrl+V) action in main menu.
Actually, when we paste features from one layer to another, fields that 
do not exists on destination layer are lost without warning.
We should expect a field mapper dialog here, close to the one in 
previous proposition.

Best regards.

Hi,

Using the advanced osgeo4w installer to get qgis-dev, the most recent
package proposed is 965cef2 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/965cef2>
which is four days old now.

Something needs to be fixed, I think.

Hi Arnaud, 
very nice roadmap, ETL features are really missing. 

I use FME and Talend a lot and my guess is that what is really comfortable
to user is the graphical mapping tool (TMap component in Talend) that helps
user doing field pairing, combined with an auto-pair feature that tries to
guess pairing based on field name proximity + order. 
See here for Talend : 
https://www.talendforge.org/tutorials/data/tuto008/130off.png
<https://www.talendforge.org/tutorials/data/tuto008/130off.png>  

And here for FME  http://hpics.li/b34ba99 <http://hpics.li/b34ba99>  

That would be a nice addition to a copy-paste mapping popup window or
refactor field algorithm. I bet this is not an easy work, but it's worth
trying it. 

Cheers
Régis

There was a stale lock in the osgeo4w setup.ini update process - fixed.

	a workaround?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_qO_6ap3AwRYpOKTbpvo-WMY7WvQ80TYcyaZu_UxNztow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've this problem, I want to know the number of listeners connected to a signal.
In c++ this is possibile using QObject.receivers method.

this seems not possibile for c++ binded object to python... or I can't
find how to do.

for example in python console

iface.receivers(SIGNAL("initializationCompleted"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
RuntimeError: no access to protected functions or signals for objects
not created from Python

and the error comes from:
https://github.com/ifwe/sip/blob/master/siplib/siplib.c#L5717

there is some workaround to this limitation?

the reason of this check is to write tests that can check if a method
register a slot to a specific signal.

Hi,




I'm trying to access the GPS data in QGIS on Windows tablets/laptops, but it's a known issue that since Windows 8 the GPS data is no longer sent to a COM port but is bundled in the Windows Location Provider. Now it seems that the only possibility to get the GPS running with QGIS is to use a third-party app like Centrafuse or GPSComplete, but is there a open source solution out there? And is a fix (having QGIS read the GPS data directly from the location provider in Windows) planned or in the works?


Sincerely,


-Tariq Al-Sadoon

There's an open ticket for that: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7878.  I'd never
had that requirement yet (nor got my hands on anything with such hardware; hm,
is there and inverse thing to centrafuse?   ie. use a "regular" gps via a
windows 8 location provider).  Otherwise that might already exists...

Use an external GPS based on USB or Bluetooth.

My experience (installing and using MapInfo :-/ as the program receiving 
GPS data on at least 50 devices) is, that integrated GPS devices always 
is outclassed in a very short timeframe by even low cost external GPS.

You can buy an USB based GNNS receiver for 60$ that can use both GPS and 
GLONASS. When this device either breaks or is outclassed quality-wise by 
newer devices, then buy a new 60$ receiver without buying a new tablet.

Hi,

it's seems that GRASS plugin ignores GRASS-defined variables defined
in .grass7/bashrc. Even when I export them explicitly in the terminal
and launch QGIS they are ignored.

I solved issue locally by direct patching the GRASS plugin:

+    // GIS.lab hacks
+    environment.insert( "TMPDIR", "/mnt/booster" );
+    environment.insert( "GRASS_VECTOR_TEMPORARY", "move" );
+    environment.insert( "GRASS_VECTOR_TMPDIR_MAPSET", "0" );
+
     if ( mDirect )
     {
       QStringList variables;
diff --git a/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassshell.cpp
b/src/plugins/grass/qgsgrassshell.cpp
index adedbcb..8e51634 100644

GRASS plugin should read environmental variables from
$HOME/.grass7/bashrc or %APPDIR%/GRASS7/env.bat.

If you start the shortcut "QGIS Desktop @version@ with GRASS @grassversion@" it
should (actually it reads
"%OSGEO4W_ROOT%"\apps\grass\grass- at grassversion@\etc\env.bat).

hm, not sure. I tried on Linux to export these variables, launch QGIS
from the terminal. But GRASS plugin ignored it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] debian testing/Linux: yellow non-readable tooltips
	except for gtk+
Message-ID: <570FF244.7020803@duif.net>

Hi,

since some days I have these yellow background/white character
(unreadable) tooltips in my self compiled QGIS:

http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1460662225.png

Tried to change the 5 availabl style options, and actually ALL but GTK+
had this strange colors. GTK+ is white on black: which is actually nice.

Is this a gnome3 thingie?

Regards,

Richard

I've seen this before, and i've never used Gnome3. Probably i used Unity
at that time, but i'm not sure.

Unfortunately I never found the reason, so I cannot tell you how to
solve it. It worked again after a fresh install.

Yes  i can confirm, since some years in ubuntu,
sometimes if you close&restart QGIS things get almost normal...
it's a bit annoying because the gtk theme take up
to much screen space

Message-ID: <57110233.6030202@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
loading a raster from PostGIS crashes QGIS with:

Warning 1: Cannot find (valid) information about public.reclass_rast
table in raster_columns view. The raster table load would take a lot of
time. Please, execute AddRasterConstraints PostGIS function to register
this table as raster table in raster_columns view. This will save a lot
of time.

the raster however has been imported with the -C option: any hint on
what might be wrong?
All the best, and thanks.

I will fix it up.

How can I change the language used by QGIS Browser application?
In QGIS Desktop, I set the locale to use language other than the system's.
It works well but not for the QGIS Browser. I thought this change applied

language?

Thanks for any help

Yes I would consider it an unofficial channel given the rather heated discussion it caused last time it was raised…

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS Plugin Delete vector issue in windows
Message-ID: <VI1PR08MB108595B64BB1748CD4BB2B5FA76B0@VI1PR08MB1085.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Can anyone confirm this issue with GRASS Plugin on:

Windows 64/32bit with QGIS 2.14.1 and Master

GRASS 7.0.3 GRASS Plugin

If you load a vector layer from GRASS DB in QGIS Layers Panel,
then you remove it from the panel, still it is impossible to
delete the vector from GRASS DB using the Browser Panel delete function.

Step to reproduce:

- Load a vector file in a GRASS mapset using "v.in.ogr",
- press "View output" to load the vector in QGIS,
- remove the vector from QGIS Layers Panel
- In the Browser panel right click the vector and choose "delete"

the vector file is not deleted (or partially deleted?) and the geometry is corrupted
making the file unusable.

also: if you close QGIS and reopen it (before trying to delete the

vector file, the file in deleted without errors.

BTW This does not happens on Linux so it seems specific

to windows NTFS(?)

Thanks, Roy.

I can confirm - this happened to me last week on a Windows build.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS pointslayerfromtable on MS Access table
Message-ID: <1460983378434-5261703.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, as a pyton dummy user, i'm trying to create a shp layer from an ms
access table through command line in QGIS. Target is to insert the following
code in macro 

section of a QGIS project file in order to create at any project opening the
shp file avoiding to recreate manually it in case of mdb updates. Here the
code where i 

replace sensitive information with opoortune tag:


/import processing 

def openProject(): 
       
pts=processing.runalg("qgis:pointslayerfromtable","ODBC:<UserDSNname>|layername=<tablename>|subset="and"fieldX"and"=
'ValueX'","X","Y","EPSG:32633", None) 
        processing.load(pts['OUTPUT'])/

Obviously it doesn't work :-(. I tried to manually compile the code above
(excluding "def openProject():") in pyton console in order to understand
which is the 

problem. Following the output:


/Console Python 
Usa iface per accedere all'interfaccia API QGIS oppure digita help(iface)
per le informazioni 
import processing 
pts=processing.runalg("qgis:pointslayerfromtable","ODBC:<UserDSNname>|layername=<tablename>|subset="and"fieldX"and"=
'ValueX'","X","Y","EPSG:32633", None) 
Error: Wrong parameter value: = 'ValueX'/

excluding the fieldX filter condition, the result doen't change:

/pts=processing.runalg("qgis:pointslayerfromtable","ODBC:<UserDSNname>|layername=<tablename>","X","Y","EPSG:32633",
None) 
Error: Wrong parameter value: ODBC:<UserDSNname>|layername=<tablename>/

The same error appears if i change the USERDSNname with mdb pathfile:

/Console Python 
Usa iface per accedere all'interfaccia API QGIS oppure digita help(iface)
per le informazioni 
import processing 
pts=processing.runalg("qgis:pointslayerfromtable","<pathfolder>\<DBname>.mdb|layername=<tablename>|subset="and"fieldX"and"=
'ValueX'","X","Y","EPSG:32633", None) 
Error: Wrong parameter value: = 'ValueX' 
pts=processing.runalg("qgis:pointslayerfromtable","<pathfolder>\<DBname>.mdb|layername=<tablename>","X","Y","EPSG:32633",
None) 
Error: Wrong parameter value:
<pathfolder>\<DBname>.mdb|layername=<tablename>/

I understand that ODBC connection or db access pathfile doesn't work
properly...Someone can help me?
In the web i don't find any information that can help me.
As said i am a pyton dummy user and therfore hope that there is a simple
correction to apply in the code above to make it work .
Another observation: applying the command with a csv file instead of mdb
file, all works well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DB2 provider environment
Message-ID: <571614F4.7060708@adtechgeospatial.com>

The QGIS startup batch files reset the Windows environment. This causes 
a problem for the DB2 provider as we need the DB2 libraries to be 
included in the path.

Is there a straightforward way to handle this?  Is this an issue for 
other database providers?

We've handled this by hacking the QGIS batch file but this isn't a very 
pleasant end-user solution.

No, because for those the dependencies are included.  You could package
the dependencies and/or just add a batch file in %OSGEO4W_ROOT%/etc/ini
to add what you need.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Browser Panel: how do the filtering options work?
	and other questions...
Message-ID: <CAECJsSqpUnrgnTQW9OkkVggQCbLzyEVKuxZn3xk+Q5+HmPP71Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

For the documentation purposes [0], I'm trying to understand how does work
the filter tool in the browser panel. I get some behaviour I don't know if
it's what's expected, a local bug or a code related. Let's activate the
filter tool, case insensitive.

1/ Performing a search returns only folders that match at the root of the
tree, unless you had already clicked on one of these folders/DB in which
case direct contents of this one are also fetched. Sub-folders are not
taken into account if not already opened. This imho makes the search tool
less useful given that you need to open a folder/schema to have its
contents available in the search. Can anyone confirm?

2/ If I use the _joker_ option: _ca*_ returns items like cadastre,
cavity... but while writing in the search field, _c_ nor _ca_ (without
using the joker character) return a result. User must use a wildcard before
any result is returned. Is this an expected behaviour? Shouldn't this
option be a special case of the _normal_ search option and thus return
files as the user goes along typing and fine tune the results when the
special character is added?

3/ How is the regular expression search supposed to work? Any help?

4/ When does someone need to use the "Fast scan" option available in the
context menu of a folder?

5/ I'm unable to drag-and-drop file between the two browser panels. Has
this option been removed, if ever available? How do I move files?

6/ This one might be a feature request: I think that the context menu
should be adapted to the concerned item: not only file vs table vs folder
vs schema as currently done. It should:
- show "Add selected layers" only for multiselection, avoiding duplicate
tools when a single file is selected
- not show "add Layer" for unreadable file (.doc, .pdf, .ai ...) - nor, a
bit debatable, show properties for them (currently, you get a widget with
light message 'Error')
- being able to sort the list returned in the properties of a folder will
add some values to this widget

Are there valid points, requiring a feature request open? Let me know.


Thanks to anyone who can provide me some answers in order to complete
documentation.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with label alignement
Message-ID: <5717279C.9010904@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I noticed some problems with label alignement.

I have a symbol in map units (a circle), within which I place a label
with font size in map units too.
It used to be centered in the circle, it is not anymore with QGIS master
81744ec.

See attached image.

I checked the label properties everything is fine (alignment: center,
placement: center quadrant), same for symbol (anchor point: center).

Does this speak to anyone?
Do you have an idea which change broke this?


Thanks a lot for your help,
Denis

I currently use a couple of random layers out there (one WFS, one WMS) for
Travis testing. One went wrong recently. What services does QGIS Travis
testing use? Presumably the devs have faith in those servers' and layers'
availability?

Hi Tom,

There is something (but it's for WCS) here:

The problem with external services is that they need to be very stable.
For this reason, the osm test is excluded on CI, it was producing many
false alarms while never pointing to real issues.

The best thing one can do is to bring up a server on localhost which
responds (statically or with some simple logic) to the requests. See
e.g. test_qgsnetworkcontentfetcher.py for how that can look.

Message-ID: <1461166641271-5262115.post@n6.nabble.com>

My system (QGIS 2.14.1 Win7x64):

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "ID": "1" }, "geometry": { "type":
"Point", "coordinates": [ -162.97528075057517, 67.562080385426 ] } }

Travis (QGIS ?2.8.?, Ubuntu Trusty):

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "ID": 1.000000 }, "geometry": { "type":
"Point", "coordinates": [ -162.975280750575166, 67.562080385426 ] } }

The ID field in QGIS says it is:

Type: qlonglong
Type name: Integer64
Length: 10
Precision: 0

What could cause one system to export as an int delimited by quotes, and the
other to generate 6 decimal places, but not delimit with quotes?

Seems one system (Windows) treated it as a string not a number. Could
this be locale related?

Ah so you're saying it's the GDAL version, Windows being 2.0+ and Linux
being likely 1.11.x?

Ah, thank you. The Travis install is QGIS 2.8.1, so two questions:

1. Will GDAL 2 work with this?

2. Can I bump GDAL on Ubuntu with apt-get?

Thanks for explaining so quickly - much appreciated

Tom

2.8 didn't have support for writing OFTInteger64 (was added in master 7de0757).
So there it's always OFTString regardless of the GDAL version. Only in master
it different depending on the GDAL version.


Jürgen

PS: except if the source file is also read by OGR and different GDAL versions
    consider the type of the input field differently.

...or any other simple way which can be easily implemented in Travis.
Current Travis config is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/.travis.yml

So I guess pip is an alternative, though I don't know much about it.

What's my best approach?

Same on my Ubuntu machine. The Windows nightly from yesterday also
crashes on start. And Travis on Github says "Build Failing". 

There must be something wrong in the last commits.

Ok thanks Nyall,

so what do you suggest to do about this,

i think it's really quite a issue although it

happens only on windows ...

I can confirm - this happened to me last week on a Windows build.

Sorry about the warning you had to fix ;)   I quickly pushed and triggered
another windows nightly.

Apologies, Juergen - messages crossed. So are you saying, given SHP input and
QGIS 2.8.1, that it's not possible to replicate the 2.14.1 output? If so,
I'll have to generate my test control files from a 2.8 installation.

Well, I'm just saying that it depends on OGR what QGIS sees in the source file
and if it's OFTInteger64 it will be written as OFTString in 2.8 and in master
depending on the OGR version either as OFTInteger64 or OFTString.

Because I don't know if and if so when OGR reports OFTInteger64 from shapes and
that is might have changed is just guess work from the fact that writing 64bit
ints was added.   So this is just giving pointers to more things to consider...

Thanks for the comprehensive response, Jürgen. Given that Travis (using
ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable) installs QGIS 2.8.1 at the moment, I don't
think I can get that to generate the OFTInteger64 output. Not a big problem
- I'll just use 2.8 for this.

Thanks again for all the help

Tom

OK, I found a 2.8.6 install, and that has solved that specific problem -
thanks!

However, there is one other inconsistency. I should have said that the data
is qgis_sample_data\shapefiles\airports.shp from
https://qgis.org/downloads/data/qgis_sample_data.zip.

2.8.6 Win7x64:

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "ID": 1.000000 }, "geometry": { "type":
"Point", "coordinates": [ -162.97528075057517, 67.562080385426 ] } }

2.8.1 Ubuntu:

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "ID": 1.000000 }, "geometry": { "type":
"Point", "coordinates": [ -162.975280750575166, 67.562080385426 ] } }

The precision differs between the two. What causes that?

Is there a Windows 2.8.1 package I can download from somewhere to see if
that makes a difference? http://qgis.org/downloads/ only has 2.8.3+ (or
pre-2.8, which I really don't want).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [solved] DLL load failed on PyDev
Message-ID: <CAKWoFM+9+fQG1KKHG-KnSX-7BQNEPCWzCVtH-tohCSQwWjZiEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'll just post an answer to my own question before even asking it. I
struggled with this just too long to want anybody else to hit to the same
problem.

When trying to import qgis in Eclipse I got an error:
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

That was weird because I thought the environment was set up right.
The problem was that I had also C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath in the
PATH environment variable. Do not do that it messes the Eclipse up!

Let me explain little better.
I started Eclipse with a bat file that called the o4w_env.bat and set the
PATH environment to include C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\bin. I had included
also C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath to the PATH so Eclipse could find
javaw.exe. This javapath folder updates on every java update to include
shortcuts to the newest java install.

When running python from cmd.exe that was started with the same bat
everything worked great. I even looked dependencies of _core.pyd with
Dependency Walker and it found all the deps. Only the import inside Eclipse
didn't work.

When checking os.environ['path'] in Eclipse everything looked good and all
the necessary paths were there except it had also three extra paths in the
start of the string that I didn't set anywhere:
C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_77/bin/server
C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_77/bin
C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_77/lib/amd64
I don't know if these matter of not but import didn't work.

Finally I solved this by removing the javapath folder from the PATH and
configured the -vm in eclipse.ini to be
C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath\javaw.exe


This is probably a bug in Eclipse or PyDev or something. Why it didn't find
dlls even when all the folders were in PATH?


Finally I can start working with my plugins which are going to be big
someday!


Hopefully someone finds this helpful.
Thanks,

-Lauri

Hi,

How did you land on this page?

The URL to access is supposed to be
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/crs.html

In your link, in the js

if (langPlusPage==undefined){
            currentPage = currentPage.replace('index.html','')
            search = new RegExp('\/[a-zA-Z_]{2,8}\/'+ currentPage, 'gi');
            langPlusPage = window.location.href.match(search);
}

but currentPage contains currentPage value is
"docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/crs.html"

As your url is
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/crs,
window.location.href.match(search); failed and you get your alert popup.


Cheers

I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and QGIS master. Can anyone confirm this? The
Geopackage can be displayed in QGIS when using the standard vector file
dialog.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questions about QgsEditorWidgetWrapper value() /
	setValue()
Message-ID: <201604221438.43459.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to understand the abstraction of QgsEditorWidgetWrapper.

1) Semantics question
Am I right that there's no guarantee (and that's actually intended) that the 
following pseudo-code is true :
	setValue(v)
	assert value() == v 

For example in the QgsValueRelationWidgetWrapper(), value() returns the value 
of the value column of the referenced layer, which corresponds to the key 
provided to setValue().
And that's value() that is used when displaying the attribute table in table 
view mode.
So this value() method is more a displayValue(), right ? And setValue() would 
be setRawValue() / setSourceValue() ?

2) Implementation of QgsRelationReferenceWidgetWrapper.
The value() method in that case actually returns the foreign key set by 
setValue(). Is that intended ? To have similar behaviour as 
QgsValueRelationWidgetWrapper, one could rather expect value() to return the 
evaluation of the display expression, no ?
If the current behaviour is intended, is there something in the abstraction of 
QgsEditorWidgetWrapper that could return the evaluation of the display 
expression for a QgsRelationReferenceWidgetWrapper ?

Thanks

Even

Hi Andreas, dear list,

sorry for the warm up of this old topic.

There is in deed a need to enable multi threading in Qgis-Server.

In our company we use around 60 different layer to lay some topics on
the map. This may be an extreme example to read, but quite common in our
environment, i.e. we can not lower this number significantly.

A warmed up QGis-Server process which already read and cached the
Configuration file qgis-xy.conf still needs around 20 seconds to
calculate the complete resulting map picture.

During this calculation there is only one thread working, serializing
the DB-requests, calculation the layer picture and mapping the picture
on the resulting picture.
The process is running on a multi core server. If we can utilize the
idle cores to do useful work, this can be an easy example to speed up
the process (significant).

I'd like to share my developing experience to do this change, but I
would need further information and some support to do some useful patches.

I have scanned the git-Qgis sources (commit
81744ecf90a8f6c1e2e94fdacb07e3dca6987dcc) for a suitable multithreading
entry. Found QgsMapRenderer::render() because of the line "while (
li.hasPrevious() )". It seems in this loop the layers are painted in
serial onto the resulting picture.
If I can build an auto parallel computing with QtConcurrent in this
place there seems to be the most gain. I mean to parallelize the loop
with concurrent DB requests, concurrent painting in separate pictures
and in serial map the single pictures onto the result picture.

Right now I don't know if I can do DB requests in parallel, or where the
code for database requests is buried.
And how about the calls inside the loop, are there side effects
preventing multi threading?


Do you got hints, flames or suggestions?

There is no shared cache, because Apache spawns QGis-Processes with its
own memory layout. these Processes know nothing about its neighbor, and
you have a hard time to exchange data between all processes.
How about a scheduler, which assigns requests to warmed up Qgis-processes?

It should in theory either return the same value or an invalid QVariant 
which should be interpreted by the outside world as "no change". But I 
admit that I doubt that all widgets effectively follow this rule.

value() should return the real/raw value. Returning the display value is 
wrong.

For this there is QgsEditorWidgetFactory::representString 
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsEditorWidgetFactory.html#a6805c62cc859478b4d4715b3819ce24f

OK, looking closer, my below comment about 
QgsRelationReferenceWidgetWrapper::value() returning the displayed values was 
actually wrong.

Thanks, that make sense. And it is actually implemented by 
QgsRelationReferenceWidgetWrapper.

Wouldn't make it sense then for QgsRelationReferenceWidgetWrapper to implement 
it and return the evaluation of the display expression ?

Arg, I meant QgsValueRelationWidgetFactory. It is *not* by 
QgsRelationReferenceFactory, hence my question about the appropriatness of 
doing so.

Hi Jörg, 

Unfortunately I am not the suitable person to ask. In only occasionally
develop Python and don't know C/C++. However, I am a long-time QGIS
server user. I have big projects as well (with 80/90 layers). They
usually render in 1-2 seconds, not 20 seconds like you cite. So maybe
there are other issues/bottlenecks? Do you have an exceptional number of
features in your layers? Do you use scale thresholds to filter features.
Typically it doesn't make any sense to render too many features at small
scales, because you can't depict them anyway if there are too many. 

I assume you use Postgis as a data source - since you talk about DB
queries. Do you have the proper spatial index and other indexes? Do you
have a recent version of QGIS server? I think version 2.10 and later
introduced filtering inside the DB (instead of filtering in QGIS), which
should come with a performance improvement. 

20 seconds is definitely too long a wait for a map rendering, but I
guess you can bring this down to 1-2 seconds if properly optimized (both
in DB and in QGIS). 

It may well be that there is room for improvements in rendering speed of
QGIS server, but multi-threading is probaby the most complicated way of
improving performance in QGIS server. When I asked Marco Hugentobler,
the main QGIS Server developer, he told me it would be almost impossible
to make QGIS server multi-threaded. 3LIZ is also into QGIS server
development since some time. So these are the guys to ask. 

And then - the other issue is that you want to reserve your other CPU
cores for parallel requests as well. You usually don't want to dedicate
all your CPU power to a single http request. 

But if there is a way to improve speed in QGIS server I am all for it
... 

Greetings, 

Andreas

I guess a more time consuming parameter is the number of vertex in the
feature involved in the map rather than the layer numbers.

Yes, sounds reasonable to me. And I think it would also make sense to 
implement a shorthand QgsEditorWidgetWrapper::displayValue() for this 
functionality.
That's where one would expect such a method and it reduces boilerplate 
code, the best demonstration for this is this thread I guess.

Hi,

I don't know the server code very well, so I may be wrong, but I think 
that making the server multithreaded rendering (MTR) capable should be 
possible. And while it is certainly often possible to increase the 
performance with filtering, rules and caching there are certainly also 
situations where MTR can help a server to generate quick responses (many 
layers, few requests).

As far as I can see, the main task would be porting the code from 
QgsMapRenderer to QgsMapRendererJob and QgsMapSettings. A first step 
into this direction can be found in a recently closed pull request [1], 
in particular this commit [2].

Concerning parallel DB connection, there's no difference between server 
and desktop use. This code is already in production use and should be 
fairly robust already.

I hope I didn't base this message on wrong assumptions and hope someone 
of the server developers can shed more light onto this.

Regards
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving the install instructions to a more sexy,
 visible, coherent and translatable page in qgis.org
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrp6hP6JhPH9QV95x98nhyf_MYmoNFx-izyeAqbx25rwg@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,

Currently, when someone is looking for steps to compile a QGIS release,
he'll will find them in the QGIS repo [0]

I personally don't like that page and from a non-english speaker and
non-developer looking for a howto, I didn't like it not being translated.
And there are pages from the translated website that directly link to this
page (leaving a fully translated page to a specialized page totally in
english from within the QGIS project doesn't really sound good to me).

Then, reading the introduction of this notice, you'll find assertions such
as:
- "You can download this document as part of the QGIS 'User and
Installation Guide' in HTML and PDF format via http://qgis.org."
- "Translations of this document can also be downloaded at the
documentation area of the QGIS project at http://qgis.org."
AFAICS, this text is available nowhere in the manuals and there's no
translated version.

SO, does it make sense to move it to somewhere like
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html?
It'll complete all other chapters on development matters, will be more
visible, sexy and translatable.

The issues I can't figure out how they can be solved are:
- what will be the status of the current page, in the QGIS repo?
- how will update be managed?

Comments are welcome. I'd have loved to show you this chapter in context
but I'm unable to build the website [1] so you may need to review the PR
#343 [2](I've RSTed the text)

<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/pull/343>
Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi

Yes, rendering multithreaded in the server is possible (but needs some 
work of course).

What I said was that the effect is probably not that big, because the 
fcgi module already distributes concurrent requests to different 
processes. In the special case of very rare requests to the server, it 
might have a considerable effect. But even then it is very unlikely that 
a 20sec request will render in 1-2 sec (what you need for interactive 
web maps).

Regards,
Marco

I'll have a look.
It seems to me I have to extract the code inside the loop (in
QgsMapRenderer::render(), "while ( li.hasPrevious() )") into a separate
method and call QtConcurrent on that.

we already got this technology, but in those cases described below the
work distribution does not help. Currently we got around 10
clicks/second at max, but the user has to wait an awful long time for
the map to update in his/her session.

We have measured the average response time which is around 1 second. But
using FCGI and parallel QGis-server processes does not help in this case.

I'd estimate it to be nearly linear for painting the pictures (and maybe
also for calling the DB). On your server we can see one core to be fully
utilized calculating with low IO and all others idling around.

I'd like to give it a try in the below mentioned method. Do I have to
expect serious side effects? Do I have to consider something I forgot in
my design?

Hi,

This might be a consequence of
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8bda5c00a5c67f7a4b83c389d805b8ba06f1c568#diff-3bbec1fb15b14150a2f360af9842278e

I've already fixed some of those errors with
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/1e6dceb7d25d0634f9f452dff2f360bcf901bd2f#diff-3bbec1fb15b14150a2f360af9842278e

but there are probably other errors still to be addressed.

Please file a ticket.

You shouldn't have to deal directly with QtConcurrent, this code is 
alredy present.

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMapRendererJob.html#details

Have a look at QgsMapCanvas::refreshMap() which sets up a job and 
connects the signal finished() to a local slot and continues execution.
On the server instead you probably want to use a QFutureWatcher with 
waitForFinished() to wait for the painting job (with its threads) finish 
before responding with the freshly painted image.

Hi,

during last hackfest I actually also did this, point was that currently
there is some 'magic' if I understand correct from Juergen, which would
be broken if be bring those pages to rst...

I agree with you that rst would be the preferred format, but feel that
as Juergen is actually keeping those notes up to date, he has to ok with
that.

@jef: maybe you can elaborate a little more on this?

Richard

I’m popping in here a bit because some of this is my legacy. The INSTALL is built using text2tags (a markup language before markdown became popular). We could probably migrate to using RST sometime but the attraction of t2tags is that it is very light weight (single simple small binary to compile the doc) and the INSTALL docs in the source code means it usually will match whatever version of QGIS you checkout from GIT. If we move the management out of the code tree and into the docs tree then we create a cross dependency on the two repos meaning that when we e.g. do a release we need to be sure to compile the INSTALL docs in the docs tree and copy the generated file over to the code source tree - and be sure we are compiling the right docs sources to match the the version of the code sources. That all sounds a little complicated to me compared to the current system…

What about we maintain a small sphinx project inside the code tree and then do some git submodule magic to include that into the docs repo. Can you use submodules to include only a directory from another repo? I agree it would be nice to be able to have the INSTALL docs translated, though I don’t know if it is worth the effort (i.e. how many people will actually use them).

Tim

Hi,

Thanks for your comments. You both are pointing what I was afraid of and
mentionned at the end of my message: how to keep up to date the install
instructions?
And to be honest I'd prefer an up to date instruction in english only
(though not easy to use) to a translated but deprecated one. My intention
wasn't to move the INSTALL instruction itself from the QGIS repo. I agree
that we should keep an INSTALL doc near every QGIS release.
My concern is should we and how do we get back its contents into website
(or maybe, documentation?) repo. I don't know about magic tools that can be
used so can't be of any help. Sorry!

The INSTALL doc is imho one other and big advocate of QGIS being an
inclusive project, cross-platform, accessible to _any_ newcomer  and that
developers care about that.  For such reasons, I think it deserves more
exposure. The current generated preview is somehow hidden (though you can
find links to it in the website), isolated from QGIS doc and not that funny
to read. These last months a lot of work has been done on documenting how
people can get involved in the project, from writer, bug reporter,
translator to developer, newbie or not (which repo for which issue, how to
use git, qt, rst, code and doc writing rules...) . And I feel that "how to
compile QGIS" is a missing gap.

About potential users, I think a documented feature has more chance/is
easier to be used than not documented. For having tried unsuccessfully to
build QGIS on Windows 8 about a year ago, I wasn't able to decide if it was
because I didn't well understand the steps or if it was because I hadn't
the same version of applications used in the instructions. So, shame on me,
I gave up!
In a more exposed situation, we can expect feedback of community (and not
only Juergen and few people- thanks to you) about potential changes/updates
on third-party tools used, comments on the quality of the description
(e.g., while converting the text into rst, I found that there are some
broken links under 4.3.2.2, 4.3.2.3, 4.3.2.7 - just other dependencies
btw)...
I may be too much optimistic but I think if there's a somehow easy and
long-term clean way to have these instructions available near our other
official documents and accessible to our wider community, let's do it.
Otherwise, let's update the INSTALL doc to remove mention of availability
in our website/documentation, in any translated language (at that time I
spent time lookig for the translated version).

Sorry for a so long post

Harrissou

On a (somewhat) related note - I'd love to get the coding guidelines
updated and add in documentation for how to correctly use QGIS' unit
testing infrastructure. But I'm unsure where these guidelines now exist and
why they were removed. The website and wiki reference them, but they've
been deleted from the repo.

@m-kuhn I know you were doing some work in this regard a while back. What's
the status with that?

Hi,

Nyall, are you talking about this link
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/qgisdevelopersguide/index.html
?
NB: a 'fix Me' at the bottom of each page directly brings you to the
corresponding file in the repo

Hi guys.

I was searching for an open source project to contribute to, and somebody
pointed out to me that you need(?) RTL support, and asked me if I'm
interested it. I should note that my programing skills come from my
scientific work (I wrote simulation and calculation codes) and not from
'traditional" programing background (e.g. company). Naturally, I'll follow
your development guidelines (hence, announcing I intend to work on this
feature).

Hi Yotam, 

Can you clarify what you mean by RTL? Do you mean right-to-left text
support for arabic, hebrew, etc?

Yes, right-to-left languages support.

Message-ID: <CAJvo+18M9GMVigU2muxWKPkdOLPLEWDawy8NPHjyDKfVu5HLOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I cannot add any new feature with the "Add feature" button in attribute
table or form view. The form for a new feature opens but the OK button is
always greyed out. I can add new features when starting with digitizing the
feature.

Happens with Shapefiles and PostGIS layers. Ubuntu 16.04 and QGIS master.

Can anyone confirm?

best regards
Stefan

A warm welcome to Akbar Gumbira whose GSOC project [1] has officially been
accepted!

​Akbar will be mentored by Alessandro Pasotti and me.

​Here's a short p
roject summary:

This project will focus on making styles (.qml), symbols definition (.xml),
and SVG markers sharing possible through web services that later can be
accessed and used in QGIS. The work includes:

   - Developing a web application to allow QGIS users (through OSGeo LDAP
   account) upload their styles, symbols, and SVG’s.
   - Integration in QGIS to allow users to fetch those resources and use
   them

​Best wishes,
Anita

Thanks Anita and Tim,

A bit of introduction, I am a master's student in Artificial Intelligence
in Poland (currently enrolled in Wrocław University of Technology for
preparation year and will be enrolled in Warsaw University of Technology
next semester). My experience with QGIS is mostly only as plugin developer
and did some hack for QGIS Plugin Django repository.

As Anita mentioned earlier, I will be working on the Symbol, Style, and SVG
markers sharing repository over this summer. Coding time officially starts
from May 23rd and before that is community bonding period. This community
bonding period is for me to know better the community, set up the necessary
development environment, get the implementation plan detailed, and
prioritize which requirements that I should finish first for this GSoC. To
do so, I will create a QEP and I hope I could get feedback by the end of
the community bonding period (May 22nd).

I hope I could learn a lot from this GSoC project and get to know more QGIS
community as a whole :)

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removal of labeling search methods??
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjhfBsLGm9CcPZkDY1XfxF-mYeyP+nk8FuC3c_9HA0jtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just floating an idea out there... does anyone think there'd be major
objections if I removed all the labeling "search methods" and just
left the default one ("chain") as a hardcoded method?

I'm referring to the choice between Chain/Popmusic tabu/Popmusic
Chain/Popmusic Tabu Chain/FALP which you can get to from the global
label settings. I"m 99.99% sure there's no-one around the QGIS
community who has any idea what all these different methods mean, and
googling for them only leads to the QGIS manual (which just mentions
them, no details) and the original PAL journal article (with scant
detail).

Could we just pick one and remove the rest? My motivation is that
there's a ton of duplicated code here, and if I want to add something
to the label selection routines (namely mutually exclusive labels) I'd
currently have to implement it multiple times in a huge mash of
undocumented, obscure code.

I'd love to kill all this duplicated, unmaintained code and
consolidate it all into a single pathway.

Any ideas/objections/clarifications to this?

I test against LTR in Travis via the following in .travis.yml:

I'd also like to test against 2.14 with:

Travis obviously support matrix builds, but I can't figure out how to build
a matrix of two builds which differ only in this one way.

Seems quite reasonable to me.
Any difference between methods, performance-wise? Labeling on slow machines is sometimes problematic.
Thanks Nyall!

Hello Andreas,

It seems so.

Ah yes, correct.

We do have indices installed along the tables, sometimes more than one.
We did not analyse each and every table, but the handling should perform
sufficiently.

Fairly recent, version 9.4

No, we dont use DB server filtering.

Oh yes certainly I want to.
If an eight core server uses only one core to calculate the result, we
could have a speed improvement factor 2-6 (my guess) for the single
answer. With negligible slowdown of the application because of the
additional handling of multi threading. So in this case the server
delivers the resulting picture faster than before.
And if the same server already has a multi threaded request running on
eight cores, then the linux kernel divides the cpu calculation. So that
a single request still gains an estimated improvement of 1-3.
So in the result we have no significant speed loss in case of a fully
loaded server. But much gain in case of an idle server.

You're probably referring to scripts/scandeps.pl.  That updates the apt-get
install lines in doc/linux.t2t from the packaging files in debian/

But that's about it.  I'm not sure those are actually necessary - I'd try to
keep specific versions from the descriptions if possible.  As that's what tend
to outdate quickly and point to the packaging files instead, because those are
actually used and maintained.

BTW I for instance don't go through manually setting up the build with cmake
for development, but produce packages once (or sometimes even kill the build
half way) and keep using that build directory for development (both on linux
and windows).

On Debian that complains about what dependencies are missing anyway - so having
the apt-get install list above isn't necessary.  You could also just add the
nightly repository for the distribution you target and run apt-get build-dep
qgis and achieve the same.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] GDAL - Clip raster by extent : is
 NODATA param optional ?
Message-ID: <571E386C.9020807@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I encountered some trouble to integrate 'GDAL - Clip raster by extent' 
in a model.

The NODATA param is described as 'Nodata value, leave blank to take the 
nodata value from input' and it is not optional. There is no problem if 
the algorithm is executed alone. But when we integrated 'GDAL - Clip 
raster by extent' in a model with an empty value for NODATA, because the 
field is empty, the algorithm can't be added.

The easy way to fix it is to decalre NODATA param as optional. What do 
you think about it ?

Do you know other potential optional parameters ?

There should be no problem declaring it as optional (it is actually
optional, so it fixed the decalration)

What surprises me a bit is that when running from the toolbox, an
empty string is accepted as a valid value...if it is not optional, it
should complain

Anyway, that's a different thing :-) Feel free to update the paramter
in the algorithm to fix that

Thanks!

Hi Tom,

Just setup a matrix with two different environment variables and check
for these in a bash script, that should be the easiest way.

Hi,

I made a PR to fix it.

By the way, recently in this GDAL gdal_translate (used to clip by
extent) has been added the parameter

-wo OPTIMIZE_SIZE=TRUE

but this is not documented

http://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html

and in fact the command run from Processing fails on master because of it.

Can I remove it?

cheers

Hi,

 

The unknown exception (geos::util::IllegalArgumentException) is thrown when
I call any geos function from QgsGeometry (asGeos(), isGeosValid(),
isGeosEmpty() 
), in Qgis an error message is shown Unknown exception and
it crashes.

 

Best regards

Nejia

Just for info, writeAsVectorFormat exports to GeoJSON differ between Windows
2.8.8 and Debian/Ubuntu 2.8.8. The upside is that this has finally forced me
to get Virtualbox up and running so I have a QGIS Linux environment.

Thanks again for the help.

The most simple approach will be

env:
    - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian-ltr
    - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian

  - sudo add-apt-repository ${QGIS_REPO}

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis-bin crashes accessing relations
Message-ID: <571F828F.9070207@gmail.com>

Dear fellows,

My QGIS, on Windows 7, is crashing when I'm trying to access a relation 
within a field form layout built with drag-and-drop designer.
I don't know if my particular use case is doing this, so I briefly 
report it here:

I have 5 Postgis tables (Appartment, Building, Land, Registration and 
Deed) related like this:

Apartment --- many-to-one ---> Building --- many-to-one ---> Land
Registration --- many-to-one ---> Deed
Registration --- many-to-one ---> Land
Registration --- many-to-one ---> Building
Registration --- many-to-one ---> Apartment

With all the relations being set accordingly in QGIS, I end up having 
the Registrations list within Land, Building, Apartment and Deed field 
forms (each with a tab, for convenience).
I began adding the relations and testing in the above order, starting 
with Registration - Deed. Everything was fine, until I added the last 
relation.
This point forward, QGIS crashes when I try to access the tab were the 
Registration relation fields are lying, no matter which table I'm in.

The dump summary extracted from the dump file with VS is:

The funny thing is that I am able to reproduce the use case in a fresh

prevent this from happening in production so any hint on this is highly 
appreciated.


All the best,
Mihai Terente

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-LnAqoF_-M_Y-ufzGzssUx=ucRWYGTt9+DWjxdnzmPjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been working on a presentation for FOSS4G-NA (North America), to be
presented next Tuesday morning in Raleigh, North Carolina:

https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/state-qgis-project

Since this presentation is not only on the current release, but also
focusing on the upcoming move to 3.0, I would greatly appreciate any
updates or insights you have to share on the following (since it can be a
full time job just trying to keep up with what everyone is working on):

* Major features you may be working on for 2.x or 3.x (e.g. live map
styling dock)

* Current and planned support of Python 3

* Current and planned support of Qt5/PyQt5

* What Qt5 support might offer QGIS in the way of new features or
platform/device support

* Prospective timeline for 3.0 (even wild guesses, since no release date is
set)

* Suggestions on how the community can best help accelerate the move to 3.0
(example: test early beta releases or nightlies)

* What might happen when 2.14 LTR is end-of-life and there is no 3.x LTR
(will latest 2.x branch become defacto LTR?)

Although I have found some information on most of this already, I think it
would be great to hear what developers are most excited about when looking
toward the future of QGIS.

Also, is there a current template for QGIS project slide presentations?

Please note: other than acknowledging and thanking my employer, Boundless,
in one slide of the presentation where I introduce myself, this is not in
any way a "Boundless" presentation, nor even mildly branded as such (all
graphics are from QGIS project). I am solely doing this presentation on the
state of the QGIS project and objectively presenting it as a member of the
QGIS community, with no allusion of representing the project itself.

Thank you for any help or suggestions you can provide.

Sounds like a good idea. From my testing long time ago there was never
a significant difference between those methods anyway. IIRC in case of
heavy coverage of map by labels, the more advanced methods may end up
displaying few more labels in total, but it is not really worth it as
that's an edge case.

Hi,

Googling I found this

https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/72

and there they say:

In case someone else is looking at this, make sure "C:\[PythonDir]\DLLs"
is in your pythonpath environment variable, NOT your path variable.

In your case maybe the problem is maybe two python installs? One normal
one and one in osgeo4w?

Another option would be to try the 'Docker'-way.

I just build both docs and website (and translations) on a Windows 10
machine, following the instructions from:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website#building-the-website-using-docker

Only change is that boot2docker is not 'depricated', and you should use
this docker-product:

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox

let me know if you need further help.

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding custom symbols
Message-ID: <5720F218.20801@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
what is the recommended solution for distributing custom symbols for a
specific project, without having the user to set up a custom symbol dir?
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] projection selector in standalone api
Message-ID: <CAG26uNtbrCEeO1gDavVxYS-bFocb4EAKmBA3C1TNTDRkLtaiPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm developping a standalone application in pyqgis in order to visualize
and explore data in netcdf files.
I would like to have the possibility to change the projection of basemaps (
raster in .tiff and coastal outline in vector) with the
QgsGenericProjectionSelector() class but it doesn't work. I think I'm quiet
close to succeed but i miss something and I don't know what.
Please, does anyone can help me to resolve my problem?
(I use QGis 2.10 on windows)
Here is my code snippet:

self.connect(self.basemap_img,
SIGNAL("clicked()"),self.on_basemapImg_triggered)
self.connect(self.basemap_shp,
SIGNAL("clicked()"),self.on_basemapShp_triggered)

def on_basemapShp_triggered (self):
        statics_dir=str(self.homepath)+"/statics/ne_50m_land/"
        name="ne_50m_land.shp"
        print name
        ll_color=True
        print "ok new crs shapefile"
        dialog = CreateModelDialog(name, self.canvas)
        dialog.projSelector
        print "projSelector"
        print "ok shapefile"
        self.updateFileVector(statics_dir+name,ll_color)

 def on_basemapImg_triggered (self):
        statics_dir=str(self.homepath)+"/statics/NE1_HR_LC_SR/"
        fileName_tif="NE1_HR_LC_SR.tif"
        print fileName_tif
        dialog = CreateModelDialog(fileName_tif, self.canvas)
        dialog.projSelector
        print "projSelector"
        self.updatetif(statics_dir+fileName_tif)

class CreateModelDialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self, layer, canvas):
        QDialog.__init__(self)
        self.projSelector = QgsGenericProjectionSelector()
        self.projSelector.exec_()
        self.projSelector.selectedAuthId()
        self.projSelector.selectedCrsId()
        print self.projSelector.selectedAuthId()
        print "ok projection dialog box"

def updatetif(self, fileName_tif):
        fileInfo = QFileInfo(fileName_tif)
        print fileInfo
        baseName = fileInfo.baseName()
        print baseName
        rlayer = QgsRasterLayer(fileName_tif, baseName)
        if not rlayer.isValid():
            print "Layer failed to load!"
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([rlayer])
        print "ok crs image"

    def updateFileVector(self,name, ll_color):

self.layer2=QgsVectorLayer(name,os.path.basename(str(name)),"ogr")
        if not self.layer2.isValid():
            print "Layer failed to load!"
        if ll_color :
            props = { 'color' : '192,192,192', 'style' : 'no', 'style' :
'solid' }
            s = QgsFillSymbolV2.createSimple(props)
            self.layer2.setRendererV2( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2( s ) )
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayers([self.layer2])
        print "Add vector layer to registry"

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Nightly & OS X Log Messages Panel - Python and QT
Message-ID: <CABnS6Y0WcZjEbwM3OMXk5_CJh58rcGVKAri=M16+7LNWNa+e1A@mail.gmail.com>

HI All,

I have been using the nightly builds for quite some time with OS X 10.11.4.

Couple of questions regarding errors I am seeing in the 'Log Messages
Panel':

1) Are QT Painter errors due to work with 3.0? Should they be disregarded
or reported? Lots of the following after a change in zoom level:

QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3

2016-04-28T11:31:54 1 QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to
set rendering hints

2016-04-28T11:31:54 1 QPainter::translate: Painter not active

2016-04-28T11:31:54 1 QPainter::end: Painter not active, aborted


2) Ever since I can remember I have had the following appear in the 'Python
warning' tab:

2016-04-28T11:27:20 1

Hey Anita,

I'm pretty happy to stick to GitHub (and also tickets once we move them)
for now and let them manage all the details so we can get on with making
QGIS better.

Regards,
Nathan

I don't think a move off GitHub is even being considered, is it?

Anyway, I'm all for a readonly osgeo git mirror of the GitHub
repository, on the condition that we can disallow contributors from
submitting pull requests via osgeo git. If that was allowed there'd
just be too much fragmentation, and reviewing and maintaining the PR
queue would be even more difficult then it currently is.

No it's not ;) Just making my position clear up front.

I'm not sure I see a need for a mirror, that is really annoying when I
search for projects and can't find the main code repo.
We all have enough copies of the git repo to push up a mirror if GitHub
went bad.

Message-ID: <CAKyBeSkDpJuw4PG7pPPjs5vyvPhN7_opLyNkwD--vbfty4zGyg@mail.gmail.com>

Info needed, time to develop. Estimate price / python preferred





Hello everybody I am looking for a developer in qsig or arcgis that would
be able to generate a plugin or window on the app or external application
that synchronize video/map/database



1The ability to link videos to a path in such a way that the video will
play in the same time the location will be shown in the map. This will work
both ways , if I move the time of the movie the display in the map will
change.. so its interactive (kind of google maps – street view)



Map –video or video –map, the file that will be importer would be an mp4
and gpx , there is a plug in similar to what I am looking for reference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXM3yB5is1A . but this one has to be
synchronized as with the other points written below , the mp4 can be
converted to images only and then be worked form there and create an
interactive motion that seems like video.



2  The plug in will have an easy way insert pictures and information that
will show more like a FORM/GUI  rather than a table and would let add
fields . this project is for traffic sings inventory

And  I would like it to be display something like this
http://brudis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Harford-Couny-Sign-Inventory.jpg .
The important thing is the ability to add fields with these will
automatically be added in the shape GIS file.



Finally, this would have a way to compare the values impute with a database
of standard values to see if they fail to comply. So create a way to insert
standards and be able to compare the values.



3.the ability to create a video display with the video mentioned above but
this will show any field set as label like a mask. In other words, when I
upload the video I set the field to display an these will show in the video
like a top layer which will show any values I want and this will be able to
change colors as well. The idea is to show in red or green whether a sign
has complied with the standards or not, but I don’t want it to be static on
the video, I want the info to be pulled straight from the shape file. And
be able to change with values to display and de location. I imagine like an
array of 3x3 and the video be broken in an imaginary grid so the labels can
appear in any of the nine cells. I forgot  it would be great to be able to
load some  image with transparencies like watermarks to show more intuitive
illustration that something failed or not and this can be set the path in
the shape file.



4 some statistics tab that will display some info like how many passed  and
some graphics that can be done by selecting which fields of interest, again
I know this is already created on sig programs but I wish them to be shown
internally i9n the  plug in..

5 print report. General and unique record again the field would be selected
by the user



I am open to suggestions this is not fixed, there could be better ways to
get the idea through. This could be a software itself.

This is a bug somewhere that is trying to set a property on a non-existent
QPainter. That might be tricky to track down. Doesn't seem to be hurting
anything, though.

This is a system-installed module (not part of the QGIS packaging). You can
just ignore the warning.

You could try the following to get rid of the warning:

sudo touch /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/
Extras/lib/python/mpl_toolkits/__init__.py

Just creating a blank __init__.py may do the trick. However, due to SIP
security on 10.11.x , you may not be 'allowed' to create the file (even
with sudo). If so, you can temporarily turn off SIP, create the file, test,
then turn SIP back on [0].

Alternatively, you could try installing matplotlib Python package from
Kyngchaos.com or the official package somewhere on sys.path that will be
picked up before the system install of matplotlib. I don't think this will
really get rid of the warning, which may happen whenever the system paths
are parsed.

I totally agree, I am happy with the git(hub) infrastructure and do not
see a reason why a move should be considered.

I'll be happy to look into an osgeo git repo when I start a new project.

I'm also happy with github, but I do see one good reason to move: AFAIK
github is not completely free (as in speech) and I'd prefer to use a
completely free platform under OSGEO umbrella if it offers the same
service.
SSO with OSGEO id would also be a plus.

But we should be realistic and unless we allocate some serious resources or
someone volunteers to move all the stuff to a new platform and maintain it
in the future I'd stick to github for the time being.

If we had a usable qgis.dtd, that should have been changed long ago.

But as we don't there's not much point in changing the dead link to something
else that just fails for a different reason.

IMVHO a page explaining why the dtd is not available is better than a 404.

Why don't we remove the link from the files?

Thanks for the info - for people smarter than I, here are the first lines
from the Qt tab in the 'Log Messages Panel' after launching a nightly QGIS
build and opening a project - the last 4 lines repeat a few hundred times:

This did the trick! Now QGIS launches clean. I forgot to mention that I
already tried a re-install of the matplotlib Python package from
Kyngchaos.com which did not help.

Thanks again Larry - super appreciated!

Not sure if validation tools would show that page - and those are probably one
of the few that hit that dead link.

IMHO would make sense to have, soon or later a DTD for project and QML
(expecially QML)... otherwise we are reduce interoperability.

we can remove it now, because it is not a reliable document... but
IMHO we would focus resources on that.

Do you have something specific in mind?

I'm not sure how we would actually maintain a dtd (or xsd) with as
little overhead as possible. Do you have ideas?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS Segmentation fault when reading from
	Spatialite data source
Message-ID: <CAMM2+YovY6R+dr9jJVdLSLbPk+GKkPwrO6uZePkAwXKNJ9pLSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm working on a sync script for use with IntraMaps Roam for offline
editing. My QGIS version is 2.14.1 (Tested on Fedora 23, Ubuntu 14.04,
and Windows 7 x64). I'm using a standalone pyqgis script that creates
the connection to the postgis data source and the spatialite
datasource that roam uses locally. At this step I've just checked that
each layer is valid, which they are, but after calling the exitQgis()
method at the end of the script I get a segmentation fault. I think it
is related to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2944, but that
specifically says for invalid layers.

I tried removing the layer from the QgsMapLayerRegistry, but that
doesn't help. Is there another way I can try to explicitly close the
connection to avoid the segmentation fault? Technically everything
will complete before the crash, but I don't know how IntraMaps roam
will respond to the sync script crashing, and I would (obviously)
prefer my script to not crash every time it runs. The code is below.

import os
import sys
from qgis.core import *

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("C:/OsGeo4W/apps/qgis", True)
qgs = QgsApplication(sys.argv, False)
qgis.initQgis()

sp_uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
sp_uri.setDatabase('_data/csis.sqlite')
schema = ''
table = 'facilities_envt'
geom_column = 'Geometry'
sp_uri.setDataSource(schema, table, geom_column)
sp_layer = QgsVectorLayer(sp_uri.uri(), "Disconnected Layer", "spatialite")

print sp_layer.isValid() # Prints True

qgs.exitQgis() # segfault :(

Thanks!
Eric

All the best.

I do have this in my matplotlib package, so I don't know why it didn't work for you.  Maybe you have some other python module that is messing with the sys.path and breaking my matplotlib (or maybe something in QGIS)?  My matplotlib uses an insert to make sure it loads before the system copy.

What's your sys.path from within a QGIS python terminal (with my matplotlib installed)?

Does my matplotlib load without noise from python in a Terminal (not QGIS)?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proper way to get the path to gdal's executables
	from a python plugin
Message-ID: <CAExk7p2Lq1crhNZZZJreY4xog_2O=LcHxbcVLngdNgB5dZbzVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I'm updating the RasterBender plugin and need to use the gdalwarp and
gdal_translate command line tools from within Python. What is the
recommended way to run gdal command line tools from within a QGIS plugin ?

Here under Windows it works with :

subprocess.check_call(''C:\\OSGeo4W\\bin\\gdalwarp...

But obviously that won't work on other setups.

Surprisingly it works too with :

subprocess.check_call('gdalwarp...

Will this work on all setups ? I have no Mac to test on, and am not
completely aware of the differences between standalone installs and osgeo4w
installs..

I looked into the GdalTools plugin and the Processing plugin, but their
method to get the GdalTool seems excessively complex (the rely on some user
settings which don't seem to be set here, and/or do some voodoo about
environment variables which I don't really understand...).


Thanks !

Olivier

There are better ways than subprocess. You can try:

import processing
processing.runalg("gdalogr:warpreproject", list, of, params)

This depends on the Processing plugin being enabled, though. Or you can try:

from osgeo import gdal

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DIVI QGIS Plugin approval
Message-ID: <1462021563710-5263657.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

Week ago I was added DIVI QGIS Plugin to official repository. After that
there was e-mail notification with information that plugin was approved but
it's not present on list in QGIS Plugin Manager.

I've upload new version two days ago but it's still not accessible by Plugin
Manager. On repository site both versions are marked as not approved with is
strange, because there was approving e-mail.

Does anyone can help with that problem?

Regards
Piotr Pociask
