Yeah this case when georeferencing aerial imagery on top of other
aerial imagery is a valid concern. This could be possibly addressed by
having a switch (with a keyboard shortcut) that would toggle opacity
of the georeferenced layer to 0% and 100% (or some other values).

Another option would be to have an action to open a new map canvas
dock widget containing just the georeferenced layer (with live warp as
well) that could be either docked on the side of QGIS main window or
even moved to a second display. Closing this map canvas dock widget
would make the georeferenced layer appear again in the main map
canvas...

What do you think? In this way, with single canvas by default and with
optional "pop out" georeferencing canvas we could probably address the
issue nicely.

Ok, this makes sense. I just tried to trace the use of this flag and -
as far as I can tell - it's only being looked at in
`QgsPythonUtilsImpl::pluginHasProcessingProvider` in
`/src/python/qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp`, which is not called at all (as of
today's master, at least). So just to be clear: The flag is not being
used *at the moment*?

With respect to my last remaining question:

What's the story behind `zip_repository`?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <fc3f6850-63cb-8cf6-8f7d-ea447b853680@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

just seeking some clarification: There are plenty of places in QGIS
where Boolean values are derived from strings or converted to strings. I
have been mainly looking at the use in QgsSettings and plugin meta data.

So there are a few formats ... "yes"/"no", "1"/"0", "true"/"false",
"True"/"False" ...

When I touch a value, I usually stick to whatever form of serialization
the previous "owner" of this value has chosen (for backwards
compatibility). Though, is there some consensus on what to use and how
far backwards compatibility should go? (E.g. should QGIS 3.10 be able to
flawlessly work with a profile folder that was touched by QGIS 3.12 before?)

Best regards,
Sebastian

I like the option of a switch and keyboard shortcut. I think that 
programmatically it would be much easier to implement than having a dock 
widget. It is currently possible to assign shortcuts to the *Show 
Selected Layers* and *Hide Selected Layers* commands but these have to 
be different key combinations. It would be nice to have the same 
shortcut toggling the selected layer on/off.

Hi

Thank you for this useful plugin. 

However it's not currently working in QGIS v3.10 (LTE). Is there a reason
for this? I just get a PDF with the map canvas blank. I've followed the same
method that you've shown in the sample data.

Any help on this would be great!

Thanks
Sri

It's certainly not a hard requirement. We don't make any claims for
backward compatibility for projects or settings. That said, backward
compatibility *is* nice, so the usual practice is that we only break
backward compatibility when it's really needed (i.e. to enable a new
feature, vs cleanups like you've described).

Hope that clarifies!

Right -- but #34617 will land soon (for 3.14) , so it's soon to be
actively used. And there's a handful of plugins out there which
already expose this metadata in prep for #34617.

Message-ID: <85e4d6e0-eee5-5e98-3174-1b8b3f65d6f9@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

yet another question on plugins: `plugins.qgis.org` has an API which
lists all available plugins for a specific version of QGIS. Query syntax:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=x.y.y

It appears that this API will always return information on *the latest*
release of a plugin that is compatible with a specific version of QGIS.
It does not list (older) releases of plugins that may also be
compatible. The web app technically has the capability, though only in
HTML (targeting human users). E.g. the "versions" tab on
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/ will show all releases of
QuickOSM - while multiple of those should be compatible with e.g. QGIS
3.10.0.

Is there an XML (or similar kind of API) end point that would allow me
to fetch a list of available releases of an individual plugin? Either
for one version of QGIS or for all (so I can filter it myself locally)?

Thanks,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

I fear it is not possible with the current infrastructure. As per the documentation in QGIS-Django this plugin.xml API only accept two parameters i.e. qgis: qgis_Version and stable_only: 0/1, default to 0.



More information is here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/introduction.rst#plugins-xml



Hope this helps.

@FS,

thanks for your reply.

I already expected that I had to parse the HTML ...

@all,

How hard is it to patch this feature into the current infrastructure? Is
it more a coding issue or a server resource issue (i.e. handling such
requests)? Reading `/qgis-app/plugins/urls.py` and
`/qgis-app/plugins/views.py` (from QGIS-Django), it appears that "all"
that would be required is a new view of `PluginsList`. Disclaimer: I
have very little experience with Django and your infrastructure.

Best regards,
Sebastian

@Sebastian

I had a look into django app and found that its possible to get the information of all the plugins.
The xml_plugin function in orginal django app takes 3 parameters as below,



def xml_plugins(request, qg_version=None, stable_only=None, package_name=None):


Looking at this, I thought to try passing a package_name and this seems to work.

I guess that's what you are looking for. Try this for qgist workbench plugin

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?package_name=workbench&qgis=3.10



Hope this helps,

Dear list,

@Jeff: Thanks for the tip. But I need a programmatic way using the 
Python API how to extract the "GetMap" URL.

Currently I fixed my problem with OWSlib:


```
d = parse_qs(source)
url_get_capabilities = d['url'][0]
layers = d['layers'][0]
# request getMap URL via OWSLib
wms = WebMapService(url_get_capabilities)
url_get_map = wms.getOperationByName('GetMap').methods[0]['url'] ``` 
However, I am not that happy with this approach, because OWSlib makes 
another request to the server. I mean, QGIS obviously knows the URL 
already, but I cannot easily access it Python. Does anyone else have an 
idea how the retrieve the "GetMap" URL? Thanks and best wishes, Jakob

Dear Devs,

I am currently working on some processing algorithms and wanted to 
rebase my branch on master. But since yesterdays pull of the latest 
commits (some also concerning a fix of the windows build), cmake 
complains that 'Protobuf library's 'protoc' tool was not found!'. Does 
anyone know the cause for this problem or how to fix it? I am working on 
Ubuntu 18.04.4.

Thanks!

Hi Clemens,

I had the same problem.
Installing the libprotobuf-dev and protobuf-compiler package helped.
(Thanks to Martin Dobias for the hint)

Cause seems to be this commit:

 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/2cfd69929539cb8642446e187d735ff833fface7

The fix is to install the protobuf-compiler package which provides the
protoc executable.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Werner,

thanks for the hint (also @Martin Dobias) - it solved the build problem. 
I was missing the protobuf-compiler package.

Hi List -

I remember (very vaguely) an blog-article describing how to make a 
custom pyqt widget to use in QGIS attribute forms.

I'm not talking about designing a custom form with python logic (I know 
how do that) but making a custom widget as a replacement for one of the 
build-in widget like calendar or value-relation widgets a.o.

My goal is to make a widget based on a qtreeview or qtreewidget that is 
populated using a layer with three columns "parent", "key" and "value", 
where "parent" is used to build the tree structure.

Something like the existing value-relation widget but with a treewidget 
instead of a combobox, that can be used to create multi step 
"drill-down" functionality.

However, I can't find the article. Is there anyone on this mailing-list, 
that can point me in the right direction ?

(The correct course of action would be to program it in C++. However I 
can't find the time - or intellectual energy -  to brush up my very 
rusty knowledge of C++ :-/)

You can try QgsSpatialIndex.  Look around for examples.

Johannes -

The actual intersection code can contain a pre-check of bounding box 
intersection. This will probably  decrease computation time 
significantly for the check:

for i, geom_i in enumerate(geoms):
     for j, geom_j in enumerate(geoms):
         if j > i:

             # Check bounding box first...
             result = geom_i.boundingBoxIntersects(geom_j)

             if result:

                 # Bounding box intersects, check actual geometry...
                 result = geom_i.intersects(geom_j)

             # Do something with result...

Hi Bo,

I once wrote an article (7 years ago) but it has disappeared from the 
earth surface unfortunately. And the internet archive "is having issues 
momentarily".

What you need to do is to:

- subclass QgsEditorWidgetWrapper --> 
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.0/gui/Editor/QgsEditorWidgetWrapper.html

- and create a subclass of QgsEditorWidgetFactory and register it in the 
editor widget registry --> 
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.0/gui/Editor/QgsEditorWidgetFactory.html

- let yourself inspire from the existing implementations - although C++ 
(e.g. a simple text edit widget 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/editorwidgets/qgstexteditwrapper.cpp)

Hope this helps and have fun

Matthias

Hi List,
I need to export the layers to a geopackage file, which also includes the

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjncicLqLiVyeW-RQWv-GyOxcoiarnUB5r2R-Gv1E2RjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just wanted to give a heads up on a document I've recently completed,
which maps existing FME functionality across to the equivalent QGIS
Processing or Expression equivalent:

https://github.com/nyalldawson/qgis-processing-hitlist/blob/master/fme.md

Since FME transformers are both algorithm-like and expression-like
functionality, the document splits the QGIS equivalents into columns
for both algorithms and expressions. Wherever the transformer
functionality doesn't apply, a "N/A" is entered in the corresponding
column (e.g. the "StringCaseChanger" transformer doesn't make sense
the implement as a QGIS Processing algorithm -- it's equivalent is
instead the expression functions "lower", "upper" and "title". And
conversely the "DuplicateFilter" transformer maps to the Processing
algorithms "Delete Duplicate Geometries" and "Delete duplicates by
attribute", but doesn't make sense to have an expression function
equivalent!)

There's also Transformers in FME which really don't need an equivalent
in QGIS -- e.g. those relating to styling features.

Overall we have a good level of coverage of the most important
functionality. There's a LOT of low-hanging fruit which could easily
be addressed in small PRs (e.g. things like the
"CharacterCodeExtractor" transformer would be a trivial task to
implement as a new QGIS expression function ... a GREAT task for
someone getting started with QGIS development!).

(and just for completeness - QGIS offers hundreds of processing
algorithms and expression functionality which **doesn't** have
equivalents in FME. I suspect the reverse document would have just as
many "missing" cells!)

Feedback welcome! At some stage I think it would be nice to move this
document across to the QGIS repo, and possibly pull into the QGIS
documentation itself (along with similar documents for Arc/...
functionality!)

Hi Nyall,

Thank you for sharing this interesting document.

I have questions and remarks:

1. One fundamental difference between FME and QGIS modeler, as far as I 
understand it, is the fact that FME data sources are much more tightly 
coupled with the model than in QGIS modeler. This has the advantage, 
that the data readers, transformers and writers always know what 
geometry types and attributes they have. The disadvantage is that it is 
harder to exchange data sources with sources that have other attributes. 
In my experience the FME approach is what most users prefer. They like 
the fact that they can always see at each transformer what attributes 
are available at this stage. Would you see an improvement - perhaps 
another modeler mode - where also QGIS modeler would be more tightly 
coupled with the data sources and that the model and algorithms would 
always know at any step what attributes are available at this stage? Or 
is this a fundamental difference between the two approaches that 
couldn't be bridged?

2. One aspect where FME shines is the ability to graphically debug 
models. One can at every step in the model get the view (map and table) 
of the intermediate step. One can also see at each branch in the model 
how many features take this route and how many the other route. I know 
this doesn't have anything to do with the transformer list you shared, 
but this an aspect that I think, many users like about FME.

I agree that there would a lot of "low hanging" fruits and I'm looking 
forward to more feature parity between the two. And to the discussion 
around it.

Greetings,

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAL5Q67361VF_mjfc1TT4yrERupzhCQqCbjLCc+uk6fQeVoZi6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Unless anybody objects I'm going to remove MXE cross builds from
GitHub workflows and all the relative code in ms-windows/mxe folder.

I still think it is a useful feature for quick testing on windows but
it breaks from times to times (see the protobuf recent introduction)
and I don't have the time to be the only one responsible to maintain
it.

So, either we make it a mandatory check for merging or I'm going to drop it.

Cheers

I think it's totally possible -- we just need to know how each
algorithm transforms its inputs into an output data set in advance
(i.e. the crs, wkb type, and fields).  API which permits this was
recently added, but it's not yet hooked into the modeler.  There's
still considerable work to do for that, but it's far from impossible!

A recent improvement is that after running a model in the designer,
you can now see the actual values of inputs and outputs which were
used for each child algorithm in the model. It's a partial step
towards the FME approach. To get the rest of the way we'd need:
1. to ensure that every algorithm has numeric outputs for the number
of features processed
2. ideally to allow the model to run on a background thread inside the
designer, so that you'd see these input/output values populate
instantly as the model runs (would also allow us to color-code child
algorithms by state, e.g. completed/running/pending/skipped).

1. is pretty straightforward, just a lot of grunt work. 2. is more
complex (and I suspect only achievable in builds based on qt 5.10+
(since we'd need to invoke the child algorithm prepare steps on the
main thread)... but its probably time to bump the minimum anyway).

Anyway, definitely achievable in the near future.

Me too! When 3.14 is released the model capabilities in QGIS will be
much much improved vs previous releases. Just the fact that **every**
parameter for child algorithms (including input and output layers) can
now be defined using qgis expressions opens up a WHOLE new world of
possibilities alone...

Greetings,

I'm possibly the only one using them but I find them useful. I was
wondering if it was possible to make vector tiles toggleable. If I recall
this is done with Oracle and this would prevent dealing with protobuf when
not needed.

Thanks and have a nice day!

Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] No Projection Issue on QGIS
Message-ID: <CAEh5jtG2HRkRLRoPHyZyYXpY+FseqczXsq=bGf3rRZLqHjZn5g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I built QGIS from source (master branch), it was working fine a few days
ago. Then I need to build other versions (LTR and LR). Now, my master
branch QGIS get this problem:

I can't set the projection. The symbol for projection just the crossed
projection logo. I tried to open a project, it said "Unknown CRS". And I
got this warning in the CRS log message:

"2020-04-08T17:34:25     WARNING    Saved user CRS [+proj=longlat
> +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs]".


I tried to set the projection from the Project Properties | CRS, but it
keeps saying "Unknown CRS".

I checked with my QGIS from the official release, it works fine. So, it
must be the building process. But, unfortunately, I don't have any clue,
since there is no error message. The only I got is these warnings:

../src/core/qgsmessagelog.cpp:29 : (logMessage) [176ms] 2020-04-08T17:35:12

Any pointer to solve this problem is appreciated.

In the documentation I found the method to check if the algorithm

There are a few python core algorithms with

Hello Matteo,

As far as I know, if your algorithm :

     does not change the table structure (geometry type, fields list and 
their types)

     is an instance of QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm (output one 
feature for each input feature)

In brief:

     - If your algorithm output one feature for each input feature:

        => your should inherit from QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm.

     - If your outputs features have same geometry type and same fields 
with same types:

        => you can put the flag on your algorithm as it can be used for 
in place editing.

When in place editing is checked in dialog, output features replace 
input features in source instead of being appended to an output.

Note that when heriting form QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm,

you do not have to implement processAlgorithm method which is already 
implemented in QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm

but should implement the processFeature method.

Hi devs,

I have found an issue in QGIS Server and I am not able to fix it.
I have firstly create the test to confirm the bug 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/35060

The issue is that the anchored point of a legend layout item is reset 
when the QGIS Server performs a print.
I cannot reproduce the issue with QGIS Desktop. The anchored point is 
never reset whatever the options and configurations of the associated map.
I did not find how the anchored point can be reset for a layout item.

Thanks in advanced for your help.

René-Luc

Message-ID: <3f5499b6-7aa4-3424-4df6-9e377dac379b@duif.net>

Hi,

I have a osgeo4w install somewhere with QGIS-dev on it.
The (manual) update today failed because: libprotobuf-lite.dll was not
found.

After searching in the lib part of the osgeo4w installer I found a lib
protobuf and installed that one.
After that QGIS installed fine.

Is this a missing dependency maybe?
Or is it an artifact because of the manual updates?

Message-ID: <8b543ad2-f6e0-9541-5746-af76ce77a767@oslandia.com>

Hi all, PSC,

Olaf Schmidt-Wishhöfer from KDE project has made a statement yesterday about a
really concerning situation regarding the OpenSource state of Qt.

https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2020q2/006098.html

TL;DR : using the argument of COVID-19 crisis, The Qt Company wants to restrict
a lot the opensource version of Qt, with a 12 months publishing delay even for
security patches.


Relations between The Qt Company and the OpenSource community degraded vastly
over the last month, and what was a balanced governance and economical situation
tends towards a stuck situation, with all OpenSource Qt users at risk of being
deeply affected.

The KDE Free Qt foundation is currently the organization defending free and
opensource access to Qt.

https://kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php

Given that QGIS is probably one of the most distributed Qt-based software
solution in the world, I think that we should take position in this situation.

My Opinion is that QGIS.org should clearly express a full support to the KDE
Free Qt Foundation, and send them an official public message.

I also think that if the situation evolves to a point where a Qt Fork becomes
the only viable solution to continue to have a free and opensource Qt project
with a balanced and open governance, then QGIS.org should also contribute to
financing the KDE Free Qt foundation yearly, so that they are able to hire
maintainers for the library.

I think that these points are decisions to be made by the PSC, and that there is
a certain urgency to do it.

Best regards,
Vincent Picavet

thanks a lot for the detailed report. As you descripe it the situation
is surely concerning us. Please those who had already contacts with Qt
and who follows the situation closely give their opinion.

Hi Paolo,

We didn't have any contact with the QT Company, but with KDAB in 
Germany, which is a different company that does QT development, as far 
as I know.

The Qt Company has published a short blog post today saying that those
discussions do not reflect their views and plans:
https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-and-open-source

So maybe better to wait for some clarifications to make sure we are not
rushing to spread claims that may not be correct...?

That's true, but it seems The QT Company has been lately testing the open source side of the 
QT community, with this recent event and the announcement in January to keep the LTS 
branches closed for 12 months, to apparently try getting more concessions in the contract 
with the KDE Free Qt foundation.
And even in their above correction post, they remain super vague and don't answer the 
points that would be wrong in Olaf Schmidt-Wishhöfer post

I doubt that the QT company would decide to go for the plan of delaying the open source 
version by 12 months, as the consequence (the last version of QT being potentially released 
as BSD) could actually quite harm their own business by allowing other commercial forks!

But whatever the outcome of the apparently cool discussions within the board of the KDE 
Free Qt foundation between the KDE e.v and QT Company representatives, I don't think a 
statement of support from QGIS.org to the open source side of the QT project would hurt.

As far as which body to officially support, this is a bit difficult. As the board of the KDE Free 
Qt foundation is made of 2 representatives from KDE e.V and 2 from The QT Company, it 
seems difficult to imagine that it would continue to exist as such, or be still relevant, in the 
event The QT company would execute their 12-month-delay plan. And before financially 
supporting the KDE Free Qt foundation or whatever other body would represent best the 
interests of a FOSS QT (I guess a new body gathering together KDE, KDAB and all other 
parties would be more relevant in the event a FOSS QT fork would be needed), we should 
probably have a look at its current finances/budget (from a quick search, couldn't find one 
regarding KDE Free Qt foundation, apart from the 200 000 KRO founding capital mentionned 
in their status [1])

In the discussion thread, I see a message from the KDE e.V vice president ([2]) opening 
discussion lines.

+1 to this. I've already had one customer contact me concerned about
this news, and wondering what it meant for QGIS. A blog post showing
our support for the open-source/KDE side of Qt + stating the impact on
QGIS would be helpful all round I think.

My 2c (regarding the impact on QGIS, if this went ahead): Honestly,
it's likely to be minimal. Because:

1. Qt Company really do very little maintenance on the parts of Qt the
QGIS desktop/server applications use. The changelogs for the
core/gui/widget libraries for new Qt releases + patches are very
minimal, and bug reports filed against these components get basically
no attention from Qt Company. Their priorities over the recent years
have been elsewhere (in the embedded + automotive + mobile space), and
all the interesting changes coming into core/gui/widgets are coming
from elsewhere (e.g. KDAB were/are behind the whole qt 3d framework,
and they've already stated that they'd follow a community driven fork
[1])

2. Despite one initial reply on the KDE list stating that there's
insufficient manpower to support a community fork [2], the rest of the
discussion on the qt mailing list is quite positive about the
community's ability to maintain a fork

3. A community fork would likely end up being great for Qt (my
opinion). It certainly had a huge positive impact on
OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Qt is currently REALLY difficult for new
contributors to contribute to, so it's possible a community driven
fork with more of a collaborative focus would see a bunch of new
contributors coming in. Certainly the talk on the Qt mailing lists
over the last 1-2 years has shown a huge amount of dissatisfaction
with the leadership and direction taken by the Qt Company, and
complaints about how out of touch they are with their user's needs.

4. Our releases are generally quite slow to adopt new Qt library
versions anyway, so a 12 month delay from a new release is likely to
have minimal impact (e.g. our Windows builds are based on a version of
qt which is nearly 2 years old). It'd be nice if we updated more
often, but the current situation is reflective of the fact that
there's no particular compelling reasons to upgrade to a more recent
Qt version! Let me rephrase that for emphasis: **in the last 2 years,
there hasn't been ANY change made in Qt which would have had big
enough impact on QGIS users to warrant the effort required for the
package update**.   (Compare that with how far QGIS has come in the
same time frame... I certainly wouldn't recommend that ANYONE even
THINK of running QGIS 3.2 today!!!)

The biggest impact it would have would be on the Qfield and Input
mobile apps, which rely heavily on QML. Qt company **is** actively
working on QML, and these updates are useful -- partly because QML
still has huge feature gaps preventing it being used as a real
alternative to Qt widgets, and partly because it's still buggy and
they are still fixing their messes ;).

Thanks for raising this point, this would indeed be something to look at
carefully. I agree in case of a fork, the governance model would be transformed,
and I hope the new organization and related awaited transparency would make the
financing choice easy to do.

But we are not there yet.

I also agree with Nyall that technically, impacts on QGIS would not necessarily
be big. Having a more open Qt project, with easier contributions and bugfixing
could help QGIS though.
But generally speaking QGIS, as a big and successful opensource project, now
also has the responsibility to voice opinions and defend Opensource / libre
software models of organization whenever they are at stake in its ecosystem.

It seems like this is a good time to do it.

Best regards,

Vincent

I think the CLA issue is a huge one, and I'm commenting only because you
didn't explicitly say "proprietary relicensing CLA".

I am uncomfortable with signing a CLA with an entity that is not a Free
Software charity (definitions vary by country, but the point is that
charities are legally obligated to act in the public interest).  I also
don't think that free software developers should have to grant
permission for proprietary relicensing.  While these views are certainly
not universal, I think they are reasonably mainstream.

Even among those who do not have conceptual objections, many would be
cautious about signing a formal agreement.  (I'd want to get legal
advice before doing that, and I certainly don't want to pay a lawyer in
order to give a company the right to engage in proprietary relicensing!)

If Qt were forked to continue as an Free Software project (as opposed to
a joint proprietary/Free project), then I would expect participation
from people who didn't before because of either a distaste for
proprietary relicensing or discomfort with a corporate CLA.

This happens to new builds, both master and older versions and the 3.10.3
that gets installed from the debian repository.
The recent update included proj 7.0.0 which is a major difference since the
issues appeared.
I was hoping to avoid building everything from source, but if I am to build
an older proj version, what other packages should I look into rebuilding?
Any other debian testing users having such issues?

Toggling selected layers has been recently added to master and can be
assigned to a key.

Regarding the georeference window, if the live preview is implemented, it
would be useful to track mouse movement on the image window and display a
transformed pointer on the main map with the live preview.
For usability with many repeated georeferences, the option to preload only
gcp world coords without image coords from a file will be great. This could
be useful for grids too, though a way to define grids on the fly and only
having to click for image coordinates while the grid progresses from point
to point, panning to the next expected image location would be better.

I tested tonight and got the same issue, so maybe it is still ‘is’ :-)

Everything that depends on libproj19, you can find those with:

 apt-cache rdepends libproj19

But that lacks the order in which they need to be rebuilt, for the qgis
dependency chain it's:

 * proj

 * libgeotiff
 * python-pyproj
 * spatialite

 * gdal

 * pdal
 * saga

 * grass

 * qgis

Or consult the transition tracker:

 https://linuxminded.nl/debian/gis-transitions/html/proj.html

Kind Regards,

Bas

Are you using the ftp.osuosl.org mirror?  That one is mirroring all of
download.osgeo.org, but on a fixed daily schedule - the other ones are
triggered on uploads.

I was using the norbit.de server. So it means I need to wait for another
package to be pushed somewhere before it will updated your norbit server?

Thanks Bas,
I completely removed libproj19 and its dependents and built from source the
following chain:
-proj 6.3.1
-libgeotiff master
-libspatialite 4.3.0a (with
CFLAGS="-DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H=1")
-gdal master
-qgis (a few days old master)

Unfortunately, things have not changed for the better.
Instead of the freezes I now get normal crashes and stability has not
improved. I also got a new stack trace I hadn't seen before downgrading:

Is anyone using qgis on Debian testing without issues? What else could I
try?

Thanks

Hi uclaros,

I'm on master/bulseye too, and I do not encounter frequent crashes.
Is it possible that one of your plugins is creating havoc? Also because
it is with all you versions on the same machine (sharing your profile)

Maybe create a fresh profile with no plugins in it?

You are compiling against distro proj and gdal, yes?

If you encounter still crashes, you can compile 'with debug', and using
gdb maybe can debug the crash?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Understanding plugin dependencies (and plugins.xml)
Message-ID: <6635fbc9-30a5-0b59-af13-78a315b1bfd6@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

still working on plugin management, I came across another question
regarding meta data.

Plugins can have "plugin dependencies" as detailed in the change log for
3.8:
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog38/#feature-support-for-plugin-dependencies

The name of the field in `metadata.txt` is `plugin_dependencies`. Those
are *inter-plugin dependencies*, i.e. one plugin requiring another plugin.

Looking at `plugins.xml` though I became a bit confused.
`plugin_dependencies` is missing. However, there is
`external_dependencies` (which is empty for every plugin as far as I can
tell). I traced it back on the server side and came across this:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/33b7786e5201f14e9a80f512da9e76f7b94ad772/qgis-app/plugins/views.py#L332
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/4507e84a961ed6b877d6ccb5eec017d173b61b23/qgis-app/plugins/models.py#L466

On the server side, the field is called `external_deps` and labeled "PIP
install string" (while the string `plugin_dependencies` does not appear
a single time in the server-side code).

Just to be absolutely sure: `external_deps`/`external_dependencies` is
an unimplemented stub and has *nothing* to do with
`plugin_dependencies`, right?

If the above is true, inter-plugin dependencies can not be extracted
from `plugins.xml`. Actually resolving a full dependency tree on a
client then involves downloading the entire plugin, unpacking at least
its `metadata.txt` and then recursively repeating the process for all of
its dependencies. The current (client) implementation even appears to be
doing this in the actual plugin installation folder, right next to other
scary procedures. This puts unnecessary stress on servers and increases
the risk of broken installations on clients - considering that
inter-plugin dependencies are becoming more widely adopted. I'd like to
suggest to expose `plugin_dependencies` in `plugins.xml`. This would
allow the package manager on the client to tell the user *before any
harm is done* whether or not the tree can actually be resolved or not
(just like virtually all modern package managers do).

Best regards,
Sebastian

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Failing to install QGIS-dev/nightly with osgeo4w:
Message-ID: <0cd22a77-facd-71ba-2ae4-7f09f143ad43@duif.net>

Hi,

I'm failing to install QGIS-nightly through osgeo4w64 on my Windooz VM

downloaded a fresh osgeo4w-setup-x86_64

Using norbit repo I started of by installing qgis-dev (and because that
failed earlier, I started of with a clean sheet, and also added
qgis-dev-pdb)

Installed all in c:\OSGeo4W64 dir

Using 'advanced' install I ticked the following from the Desktop group:

qgis-dev 3.13.0-26
qgis-dev-pdb 3.13.0-25

After this installation I open the osgeo4w terminal and with 'o-help' I
see there is a 'qgis-dev-bin' command.

Calling that shows: Oops.... Could not load qgis_app.dll
Check C:\..\bin\qgis-dev-bin.env for correct env paths

There IS a qgis_app.dll:

c:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-dev\bin\qgis_app.dll

But NOT the env file, there is a tmpl file though:

c:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-dev.bat.tmpl

Ah... copying that and saving to qgis-dev.bat, then run it works!
Ah, now also running 'qgis-dev-bin' works.

So, is there a step missing? If I just install qgis-dev?
Or should  I call another script (first)?

I also tried to install Package 'qgis-full-dev', but that one shows
version number 2.99.0-2 ?

Anyway, I do have a working nightly now
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/7a9c3c621a)

But thought to let others now.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks fro the suggestion,
it is not a plugin issue, nor profile related. I could replicate on a clean
VM, fresh debian install apt upgrade to testing.
The strange thing is the freezes can't be reproduced at will so debugging is
difficult. Sometimes it happens right away, sometimes it takes a couple of
minutes of zoom/pan/vertex editing. They always seem to be related with
rendering. Sometimes, while moving vertices with the vertex tool, rendering
of all layers stop so I'm left with a white screen and the rubberbands of
the modified layer. Moving the mouse to a new feature updates the
rubberbands. Then the complete freeze is triggered by hovering over a vertex
circle mark.

The only way I could 100% reliably reproduce a crash was by opening a
project and selecting "keep unavailable layers" on missing oracle layers.
QGIS always crashes then, but since the debian build is without oracle
support this might be a different unrelated crash.

 Hi Richard,
There are steps for you to reproduce at QGIS Desktop and Server crash on labeling of postgresql layer with many points next to eachother · Issue #35526 · qgis/QGIS and they should work for you too as I tested on 3 different machines and I can replicate immediately.
All the best,Tudor

	function
Message-ID: <565f234c-dc04-62b5-47a0-00b78d001ed8@di.uminho.pt>

Hi,

Travis tests are failing. It already happened in my PR, but I've checked
other PR and the error is the same.

There is no problem running the same tests locally.

The failure is like this:

======================================================================

ERROR: testValidateNative (__main__.TestQgsLayerMetadata)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SystemError: ../Objects/dictobject.c:1561: bad argument to internal function

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/root/QGIS/tests/src/python/test_qgslayermetadata.py", line 417,
in testValidateNative

    self.assertEqual(list[0].identifier, 0)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/unittest/case.py", line 828, in assertEqual

    assertion_func = self._getAssertEqualityFunc(first, second)

  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/unittest/case.py", line 808, in
_getAssertEqualityFunc

    if type(first) is type(second):

SystemError: <class 'type'> returned a result with an error set

Does anybody know why this is happening?

Hi Jorge,


I've got the same (unrelated) failure in my PRs but I didn't have time
to investigate it yet.

It's unrelated to any QGIS change -- it must be a change in the Travis
python/sip environment...

Hi Arnaud,

I explored the QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm but unfortunately is
not the case of what I'm looking for. From what I understood
QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm is the class to use when the
algorithm performs "feature-by-feature" operations like buffers.

In my case I would like to "change" the geometry of the input layer
(union and dissolve).

Cheers and thanks for the input anyway!

Matteo

Part of my problems seem to be caused by the fact that intersections between
a polygon or linestring and a point cause QGIS to crash...
eg. the following python code:

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))

Hi uclaros,

No crash here, running your PyQGIS code, on Ubuntu. Even if you compile
Proj 6.3.1 + GDAL 3.x + QGIS properly, we can have problems with Python.

For example, I recently changed to Python 3.7 and I had to:
sudo pip3 install pyproj --no-binary pyproj
sudo pip3 install owslib
and recompile PROJ+GDAL+QGIS to have it working again.

Don't forget that after compiling GDAL, you have to:
cd swig/python
python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install

After compiling QGIS, you also have to take care of your Python path
environment.

The problem with the code you mentioned, might be related to the Python
environment and not with QGIS itself, but this is just a wild guess. Are
you running the code in the Python console?

Have you run QgsApplication.showSettings() and checked the output?

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Thanks for the reply,
the python code was just an easy way to trigger the crash. The problem is
not python related, it's reproducible on a fresh debian testing vm, fully
upgraded, ie proj 7.0.0, gdal 3.4, geos 3.8.1. The issue does not exist on
debian stable, maybe your ubuntu is based on the stable debian branch.
I will try rebuilding everything with geos 3.8.0 and report back.

No issues while installing?  %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\etc\postinstall\qgis-dev.bat should
have been run (and now be named qgis-dev.bat.done).

That should have been created by running "bin\qgis-dev.bat --postinstall" from
the postinstall batch job.

And that should have been used to create qgis-dev.bat - also from postinstall.

That package is empty, but has dependencies - eg. qgis-dev.  The version number
doesn't matter.

Ok, THIS is a good test!!

I can confirm/crash with this one :-(

BUT on 3.10, 3.12 AND current master!!

I also tested on current Windows nightly, there  QGIS does not crash but

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))

shows me:

QgsGeometry: PointZ (0 0 nan)

which also is a little strange...?

should this be valid anyway?

I also ran this on Debian in gdb:

(Note that I recompiled all yesterday because bullseye had now python 3.8)

If I run QGIS in gdb (it stops in a thread, but 'continue'-ing for a
couple of times QGIS just starts.
Then copying your python script above in the python console, QGIS
crashes. 'bt' in gdb then shows:

Should I create an issue?

Hi Juergen,

Thanks for answering.

Nope, no issues during installing. I tested again just now.
ONLY ticking qgis-dev in the Desktop group

BUT after the successful install there is NO qgis-dev.* in the
etc/postinstall dir. All other 12 files there indeed have .done.

So apparently when ONLY ticking qgis-dev, that post-install script is
not (yet?) installed?

What would be the right choice to install if I only would want the
nightlies on my win-VM?

Regards,

Richard

Hi uclaros,

Can you check just GEOS without QGIS? Does this works?

from shapely import wkt
a = wkt.loads('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0 0))')
b = wkt.loads('Point (42 0)')
print(a.intersection(b))

My answer is just:
POINT EMPTY

Best regards,

Hi all,

has someone by any chance been trying or even successfully using
`coverage.py` (1) inside QGIS' Python code and/or plugins and could
share some experience?

For me, it works, sometimes, with plenty of edge cases ... I am
basically running into all sorts of wired issues - presumably due to
threads and race conditions.

Thanks,
Sebastian

I've already tested with shapely and it was working as expected. But the
shapely installed with pip install shapely has geos 3.8.0 and not geos 3.8.1
installed by apt.

I now built geos 3.8.0 from source and the rest of the chain (proj 7.0.0,
libgeotiff master, libspatialite from fossil, gdal master, qgis almost
master) and all my problems seem solved! I'll use it in production tomorrow
to check if it's indeed crash free.

Hi Matteo,

yes, it's possible to write custom Processing scripts for editing layers
in-place.

Here you can find an example (buffer):
https://github.com/gacarrillor/QGIS-Resources/blob/master/collections/processing_scripts/processing/processing_script_edit_in_place.py

>From the example we can see:

   - We need to set the QgsProcessingAlgorithm.FlagSupportsInPlaceEdits
   flag for our algorithm.
   - It's not required that our algorithm inherits from
   QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm for it to support edit-in-place[*].
   - The supportInPlaceEdit() method allows us to specify for which layers
   our algorithm can be offered as edit-in-place.

Regards,

Germán
--------------------
[*] As a demo, the buffer example is OK. However, since each feature
generates a new feature without needing other source features, the buffer
example could also be written as a QgsProcessingFeatureBasedAlgorithm. :)

Hi,

Comment mostly for Jürgen (and Windows devs/users)...

I recommend OSGeo4W's Qt packages be updated to 5.12.4 or latest LTR,
specifically for this OpenSSL v1.1.1 reason:
https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/06/17/qt-5-12-4-released-support-openssl-1-1-1

I think it is a security concern to rely upon an OpenSSL version that is 3+
years old, as is the case with official Qt < 5.12.4 releases. For one
example, there is no TLS 1.3 support in OpenSSL 1.0.2.

I've also recently encountered this strange behavior and I was just trying

On Windows 7 64 bit,

using QGIS 3.10.1 (ef24c526da), QGIS 3.10.3 (0e1f846438) and QGIS 3.12.0
(cd141490ec), all with GEOS 3.8.0-CAPI-1.13.1:

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersects(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))
returns False
QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))
returns <QgsGeometry: Point (0 0)>
print(wkt.loads('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(wkt.loads('Point (42 0)')))
returns POINT EMPTY

using QGIS 3.4.9 (b64ef50d0e) with GEOS 3.7.0-CAPI-1.11.0 673b9939:

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersects(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))
returns False
QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0

returns <QgsGeometry: GeometryCollection ()>
print(wkt.loads('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(wkt.loads('Point (42 0)')))
returns GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY

using QGIS 2.18.23 (33e81905f4) with GEOS 3.6.1-CAPI-1.10.1 r0:
QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] A new way to build QGIS and all its dependencies
 from scratch in Linux and MacOS
Message-ID: <CAEme7YYTH3jZff1nrLEMspaH-FoHKdL5G3pFCS2ynghWAXohhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I am a volunteer contributor for the software project [Spack](
https://github.com/spack), an HPC package manager. Using this tool, it is
possible to build QGIS and all of its direct and indirect dependencies from
scratch using a single line of command as shown below. I thought this might
be useful to some, especially to QGIS developers, and accordingly it might
be considered to be added to the list of QGIS build/installation methods.

Once Spack is setup like:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    $ source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

One can build QGIS and all its dependencies via a single line of command
like

    $ spack install qgis

In practice, one might need to issue a command involving some hints for
dependency resolution:

    $ spack install qgis ^gdal at 2.4.2 ^libgeotiff at 1.4.3 ^py-pyproj at 1.9.6
^netcdf-c+mpi ^mesa~llvm

This will not be necessary in the upcoming releases of Spack.

Once it is built, one can use the package like

    $ spack find qgis
    ==> 7 installed packages
    -- linux-centos7-skylake / gcc at 7.4.0 ----------------------------
    qgis at 3.8.1  qgis at 3.10.3  qgis at 3.10.3  qgis at 3.10.3  qgis at 3.10.4

    -- linux-centos7-x86_64 / gcc at 8.2.0 -----------------------------
    qgis at 3.8.1  qgis at 3.8.1

    $ spack load qgis at 3.10.4

    $ which qgis

/mnt/local/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-skylake/gcc-7.4.0/qgis-3.10.4-hc7uhdochwjmx4v2dzy2zzewit2vr2ov/bin/qgis

Hope this will be useful to some.

Thanks.


   - The pyQGIS cookbook

contains
   a section on developing plugins and is an ongoing effort to collect tips
   and tricks about QGIS python programming generaly.
   - The QGIS Python API <https://www.qgis.org/pyqgis/> and the QGIS C++ API
   <https://www.qgis.org/api/> are the ultimate references for plugins
   creators.

Hello,

I would like to load an Satellite image from the sensor Pleiades in Qgis. Linked with the image there is an RPC (rational polynomial coefficient) file which give geolocation information.
I would like to load this image with the RPC information in the QGIS viewer.
Has someone already try to develop something about loading an image in QGIS viewer with RPC geolocation of any satellite sensor?

Hello,

Last time I check, if the RPC file is in the same folder than your
Pleiades image, QGIS will load it automatically when you open your
Pleiades images. Your image will be displayed according to its RPC then.

I think that Gdal (used by QGIS to open the file) looks for a file starting with RPC_

Julien

Thanks for you answer.
which version of QGIS do you use and how do you know that it's displayed according to RPC ?

Does it also fix the following problem?

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))
returns <QgsGeometry: Point (0 0)>

Hi Andrea,

Yes, Nyall added a test using exactly uclaros's expression and it must
return NULL.

uclaros, nice work!

Message-ID: <CAFO80_oz1oY8LBJpXyvZBWzCExR-CEpQFOQRrvdQMCP-Ys_26A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm looking for a way to get qgis settings values using teh graphical
modeler, e.g. without using any python, or custom expression function.

I'm preparing a processing provider that just add some models (in the same
way as done by resource sharing plugin) and some provider specific
settings. But I can't find the way I can read this settings other that
creating a custom script.

Am I missing something?

is there a way?

Luigi Pirelli

p.s. I suppose is simple to add a new expression operator in core to add
the feature to read settings, but my target is LTR, so any new feature
can't be used.
p.p.s. or just add provider settings as new expression scope?

Hi Sebastian,

In the past, I co-developed this repo: https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe-headless and mainly involved with the testing architecture. It is a legacy code which we haven’t maintain for quite some time and haven’t been migrated to python 3/ QGIS 3. But I imagine the concept is similar.

I’m going to share you some information about the repo, so you can determine if the use case is similar. The repositories has the following characteristic:


• It tests a python application, that uses functions from a QGIS plugin (python code), that is running headlessly, on top of headless QGIS, on top of docker container
• The code heavily uses horizontal scaling and threading via Python Celery module. But since mainly the purpose is to generate reports, it is best to run it as single threaded app and the scaling is done by horizontally increase the scale of worker containers (not Linux process inside a container)
• There are two main part of the codes the master node and worker node. Worker node will always run in a different thread from master node. So the coverage.py scripts needs to be “injected” in the python’s “sitecustomize.py” file in it’s dist dir.
• You can not generate one coverage report in this scenario, since part of the code runs in different contexts. Leverage coverage.py to gather multiple reports from different process, and aggregate the report.
• Bug that happens usually caused by race condition due to the constraint that there should be one running UI thread and you need to properly switch the context. All the resources also needs to be carefully deallocated if you deal with UI (in my case, the QgsComposer functionality).


I’ve managed to do this in QGIS 2, so it is not impossible :).
If you have race condition, there are two possible cause:

1. You didn’t respect the threading constraint (background tasks should not update UI tasks directly)
2. The functionality you use, simply doesn’t support multi threading or not designed to be multi threading

When I encounter case 2, my workaround is to not go against it, but rather horizontally scale in container contexts, instead of native threads. But this might not apply in your case. It depends on how you are planning to use multithreading in your app.

You can directly check how we test it by navigating into the .travis.yml file to see how the architecture is built and used.

Free software git hoster have been supporting that since a long time
(gitlab, gitea). It reminds me when Windows finally got a proper TCP
connection and its users could finally stop installing user-level
software to get on the Internet (trumpet socket anyone ?).

Hi Laurene,

QGIS should be able to read images with RPC files. There is an issue with
parsing some of the parameters, which we are going to address:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35796

Let me know if you have any other issues.

Saber

Sure, but this has to do with QGIS using an outdated SSL library, by way of
Qt. Since upgrading Qt to 5.12.4+ may be a concern for QGIS developers, as
it is a huge dependency with potential for issues upon any upgrade (even
between minor versions), I felt it was worth bringing up here first.

If anyone here knows of a reason why Qt for OSGeo4W should not be upgraded
from 5.11 to 5.12.4+, because of issues this may present in QGIS, please
describe them.

Of course, there may still be packaging reasons or issues blocking an
upgrade of Qt packages (they can be quite time consuming to work with),
However, if there is a significant issue with regards to QGIS, then it
should probably be discussed first.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Raster pipeline issues
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFesBF=PijdDcp+muV7S=9aLriWvrvbewkojKLXdK5CRvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

With the recent addition of contour renderer of rasters I have
realized there are artifacts coming to the renderer from the earlier
stages (the raster data provider mainly). Another issue is that raster
resampling (nearest neighbor / bilinear / bicubic) is only applied at
the end of raster processing pipeline (i.e. after the contour renderer
has been run), which does not really help for contours to get smooth
contour lines (rather one gets some pixelated blurry output).
Moreover, hopefully I am not the only one seeing occasional subtle
"jumps" of raster data when zooming/panning map, which I would account
to some small math errors in the QGIS raster code.

Looking at the GDAL raster data provider in QGIS, there's quite some
code complexity, with copying of data between temporary buffers and
dealing with limitations that existed in GDAL < 2.0 (e.g. non-integer
source windows).

I am wondering what people think about simplifying the QGIS raster pipeline:
- get rid of the last stage of the pipeline - resampling - and make it
responsibility of data providers (i.e. GDAL) to return resampled data
- get rid of the reprojector stage of the pipeline - and again make it
responsibility of data providers (i.e. GDAL) to return already warped
data
- any other raster data provider not being able to do it internally
would just use GDAL routines

My hope is that we could get rid of a lot of raster related code and
at the same time use GDAL's optimized code even more. I am not saying
I will be working on this anytime soon, but I would be interested to
hear what others think about the current state of the raster pipeline
:-)

Cheers
Martin

If in doing so we could unlock resampling for reprojected rasters, woupidou.

I agree that the current approach has issues. I'm glad to see this
getting wider attention!

Frustratingly, we've actually got 3 different sources of resampling
happening during raster rendering:
1. Internal resampling happening inside gdal
2. A very coarse resampling run happening inside QgsGdalProvider::readBlock
3. The raster pipeline resampling, which happens **after** the renderer.

It's important to note that these are two very different things. I
recently did some work on the resampler to avoid edge effects, and in
my initial experiments I attempted moving the resampling right up to
the provider level, exactly as you describe. The results however are
HUGELY different vs the current resample-after-rendering approach.
Unfortunately I junked the code from this early approach or I could
show screenshots, but I'll try to describe it in words :p

Imagine a lower-resolution float raster being resampled up to a higher
resolution (e.g. zoomed in past 1:1). You might be taking 100x100
pixels from the gdal provider, then applying a discrete color ramp to
these, before resampling up to 1000x1000 for render. The results will
be a blurry version of the discrete colors - i.e. the "Hard"
boundaries between color mapped pixels are "softened" when enlarging
this 100x100 colored block out to 1000x1000.

The other approach is to do the resampling first, in gdal. What we get
then is 1000x1000 pixels of resampled float values to begin with,
smoothly interpolated from the 100x100 original pixels. This is then
rendered using the discrete color ramp, and then rendered without
further resampling or smoothing. What you get here looks more like
smoothed contours of the discrete color bands, with NO color smoothing
of the rendered pixels. The result looks much higher resolution
(because we are interpolating the floating point values on a 1000x1000
grid), but the "boundaries" between the discrete color values are
"hard" and have no antialiasing.

I honestly think there's valid use cases for both pre-render vs
post-render resampling as a result. We can't directly replace the
current post-render approach with a forced pre-render approach without
people getting VERY different rendering of their existing projects.

That said, the benefits of pre-render are huge, including that we can
instantly expose all of GDAL's inbuilt resampling mechanisms (adding
average, mode, max, min, median, q1, q3 mechanisms). The results are
also more accurate, because we are doing a single resampling run vs 3.
And, for some purposes, it results in a more visually pleasing render.

This sounds like a good idea, BUT we'd need to be very careful that
any transformation happening inside GDAL correctly uses the same
coordinate operation as you'd get if the transformation was done on
the QGIS side. I.e. you'd have to evaluate the coordinate operation
using the transform context, pass this to GDAL, and make sure that
GDAL also has access to the same proj search paths as QGIS does.

Ok, so we expect to see this done by May then? :D

Hi,

Sorry for the delay.

In the case of ST_Intersects, which is symmetric, there is no particular
order to follow. Both orders should work.

where st_intersects(lie.geometry, tbap.Geometry) AND lie._search_frame_
= tbap.geometry means:

"for each geometry of tbap, compute its bounding box, select only
geometries of 'lie' that are inside this box and then test for the
actual intersection"

Inverting lie and tbap would not change the result (and not even
performances I think)

I tested with development version [0] but I think it's already working
with previous one.

To check if it's displayed according to RPC, you could display
OpenStreetMap XYZ tiles beneath your image and check if your image is at
the right place.

The SCR (in QGIS right bottom corner) should default to 4326 and your
coordinate should be lat/long in degrees. If the RPC isn't read, you
should have coordinate in pixel instead.

Indeed - and one more optional resampling in the raster reprojector :-)

Yeah I know what you mean, and you are right, we will probably need to
live with both resample-before-rendering and resample-after-rendering
because of the different results... At least because everyone now is
used to resample-after-rendering approach. But apart from that, I am
not sure if I can see what is the use case where one would prefer
resample-after-rendering - do you have any use case in mind?

Good point - but I am optimistic here that it should not be difficult.

:-)

As Tim suggested, if this kind of rework is something that QGIS
developers would find useful, it may be interesting to have that done
within a grant - I suspect this can be a long journey with many edge
cases, but it would be worth it (better visual quality, less code,
faster). Especially I would love to see if someone with much better
raster skills (looking at Even now :-) ) would be up for this
challenge - and maybe to do a critical review of other parts of the
raster pipeline too...

I agree: QGIS grants. eventually supplemented by an ad hoc crowdfunding
campaign, is a good way to go here.

Message-ID: <CAOM0XWB8K0Co8ACD91Qa2jSNJ7sV6H-90UAh_muT8XcWE8+NDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings everyone,

I would like to know if there is a way to disable indexing when doing
topological editing. These days I must use a vpn to access our project and
data (some in shapefiles and geopackages), and whenever I try to do
topological edits QGIS tend to freeze during the indexing steps. Sometimes
randomly and in some project it simply never resumes even if the data is in
a small geopackage.

I know that indexing is supposed to be helpful but when QGIS spend 80% of
its time frozen during the indexing step, I'd rather not have it enabled.

Maybe I missed something or maybe I should add a way to disable
QgsPointLocator, or simply not use snapping?

Thanks,

Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Refresh Layer at interval functionality: data or
	repaint?
Message-ID: <313c4ed5-62c4-2e23-bca5-c18ab7d3c6ad@duif.net>

Hi,

on the User-mailing list:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2020-April/045348.html

there was a question about the 'Refresh Layer at interval' checkbox in
the Properties/Rendering tab.

I was wondering what the idea was behind it, as apparently it is only
repainting a layer?
While F5 (menu 'View/Refresh') is actually refreshing the data to (shown
by retrieving a geojson layer from a mini service).

Is this by design? Or could it be an issue?

To me a real refresh checkbox (a la F5) would be useful to users.
As this opens the use-case to for example hand an geojson-url to a
vector layer which could retrieve a 'live data' containing the latest
position of cars, or the latest measurements of a set of measuring
points etc etc.
And to be honest I do not see so much the value of repainting the canvas
(other then when you want moving features created by an expression or so).
And IF the repainting is valuable for a certain use-case: fine.
Then: what about adding a second checkbox then there...?

Anybody has an idea about this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hola Germàn,

thanks for the hint. While it is perfectly working on QGIS 3.10
installed from repository. QGIS is crashing with the same data and the
same script in QGIS master (compiled yesterday). Are there any API problems?

Cheers and thanks!

Hmm no it should be doing a complete redraw,

I think it is an issue. The original intent was to support applications like fleet tracking where you have the layer redraw every few seconds to update the current position of your fleet vehicles.

Well the value of the refresh interval option is only there if the underlying data has changed, so maybe there was a regression. I wasn’t clear about the second check box you mentioned, but if the layer is not reloading it sounds like a bug. I think we mainly tested with a PG provided when Nyall added it. Note there is also some not so exposed magic by Nyall under the hood to optimise label redrawing so that the labels don’t ‘flash’ everytime the layer updates. I think you can only access it via python at the moment though given all the new temporal stuff it might be nice to surface that logic to the UI some time Nyall?

Tim

Hi all,
I'm working ont he server section of the manual:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/getting_started.html
and I'm finding a number of inconsistencies which I'm fixing. More
generally, I find it rather confusing. I'd suggest to reorganize it by
first showing the very basic setup, with a minimal set of
configurations, and adding more sophisticated configs after that. I
found this approach very effective in our training.
Is there an agreement on that? Anyone interested in cooperating?
Thanks in advance.
All the best.

Hi,

Yes it's not easy, between what is the minimum to do, what is highly
recommended, between Apache/NGinx etc.
So I think you can go ahead, we will follow your PR.

I'm also keeping some notes, I will try to make a PR next week to
incorporate them.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Next user survey proposal
Message-ID: <fe2dc2d6-6bad-3c24-b7cf-ffb92f1a55b1@gmail.com>

Hi all,

giving some recent threads (and/or github comments [0]) I think that it
could be useful for QGIS to know from users which algorithms of thirdly
part algorithms they use and because:

* are not available in QGIS
* are available in QGIS but don't have that specific(s) parameter(s)
* are faster
* ...

recently I collaborated with an Italian student that tested and ran a
few algorithms (intersection, difference, etc) on the same machine with
the different providers. I will share a link soon with the results

Ideas or feedback?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi!

As I am about to test and setup QGIS Server I will follow the changes
too and look what I can contribute.
As far as I can see there is few to no documentation about setting up
spawn-fcgi. Maybe I can contribute to that (once I figured it out ;) )

regards
Werner

IMHO we should document the various ways to setup a server: fcgi,

Thanks everybody for the feedback.
I could then:
* create a new file (let's call it server_new.rst)
* migrate and reorganize the content
* when ready, with all your contributes, we can replace the existing
ones, splitting as appropriate.
How does it sound?
(Ale: yes, I agree, the new standalone should be added).
Cheers.

this is covered:

and it worked smoothly for me.

Hi all,
I noticed that there is anple overlap and duplication between the user
manual:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/
and the training manual:
https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_server/index.html#training-qgis-server
I think this should be cleaned up, as is confusing: those who are more
familiar with the layout of manuals can please direct me?
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks a lot, I overlooked that small part, but as far as I see it
covers "only" nginx. 

regards
Werner

Hi,

I think that this is a great Idea! The way I experience it is, that 
there are large fields of geospatial analysis which (currently) can only 
be worked on using third party providers in QGIS (eg. cost distance 
analysis or raster analysis in general). Many of those workflows turn 
out to be not very stable (at least thats the case for me).

I would like to further  work on the collection of native QGIS 
processing algorithms and knowing which algorithms are used most 
frequently would make it easier to focus the development of new algorithms.
I'm already very interested in the comparison/test-results you are going 
to post!

Best,
Clemens

AFAICT, it seems better to incorporate content from the Training Manual
into the User Manual, rather than the reverse. In this case, however,
the TM section would become useless.
I'm waiting for an authoritative response before proceeding.
Cheers.

I'm not your authorative response :-)

I agree that there is overlap, but that is with all info in the Training
Manual?
But I think setting up server is probably not the same group of users as
the average Training Manual user?
Also to just make it easier to decide...

Hi Richard,

I assume the approach is different: description of functionality vs
howto. In the case of the server they are almost the same.

Exactly, unless the training manual is conceived as as assemblage of
HowTo's.
I'd be in favour of putting everything in the User Manual, but I'd
appreciate if documentation gurus would give their advice.

Cheers.

Hi,

for me +1 to remove it from the training manual and move it only to the
user manual. If the content is duplicated and the information in the
training manual fits in the user one, let's keep doc clean

Objections?

              	    	Hi all,
I don’t see how the training manual server part could go into the user manual as they have different styles. One is for teaching and one for presenting most of/all the options.I could be wrong though.All the best,    	
    	Tudor

Hi Tudor,
thanks for your reply. I agree styles are different, but the information
are essentially the same. Currently some info present in TM are missing
from UM. I'm going to add them so that the UM will be complete, then
I'll leave the decision about the TM to you. I'm not in favour of
duplicating info, as it is very easy to get out of sync, but I don't
want to step on your feet.
Cheers.

Hi all,
I have reviewed
docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/getting_started.rst
I could not test all the combination, so an independent test, better if
on a fresh machine, will be appreciated.
Also help on the best way to configure a `qgis-server.service`` and
``spawn-fcgi.service`` will be useful.
Thanks in advance.
Cheers.

Hi again
sorry for the flood. I also revised other qgis server sections for
consistence, using uniform paths and commands. To me it looks more
usable. Tests and comments welcome. I'm available for further fixes if
noticed.
Cheers.

Hi all,

MapAction have developed a plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mapexport/) which packages up a jpg, pdf
and XML metadata file of a defined metadata set into a zip which is passed
to our Map Catalogue for publishing (https://maps.mapaction.org/). We've
submitted this to the repository, and Paolo made the useful suggestion that
we should start a conversation with developers of other plugins which deal
with printing to see if there is scope for merging. and/or developing a
plugin with wider scope, hence this email (
https://github.com/mapaction/mapexport-qgis3/issues/2).

Our plugin borrows heavily from the MapsPrinter plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MapsPrinter/ for which huge thanks), but
also adds some metadata creation and editing, with the values stored as
custom variables at an appropriate level (project, layout) before being
collected up for export to XML, and are also used to populate a standard
set of layout templates using expressions.

The functionality replicates a longstanding tool which we've developed for
Arc, with a goal of enabling QGIS to be used in deployments if required. So
while the requirements are MapAction-specific, there are elements which
could have a more generic application - specifically generating outputs for
a selected layout (which MapsPrinter already largely does), and creating
and generating editing UIs for custom variables.

Are there any thoughts on how this could be taken forward, and is there any
interest in doing so? To be honest my limited dev skills are not going to
be a big asset in this, but I really like the ability to use custom
variables, and the area where I see most scope for development is the
ability to specify a set of metadata items in config which could generate
variables, UI widgets in an editing dialogue, XML output etc, so as to
allow easy customisation.

Interested to hear reactions/questions on what we've done.

many thanks
Ant

 Re: Server manual
I noticed that the instructions need to be completed for Windows
environments, most important for Windows server environments.

Hi Mats,
right, I did not touch that section, as I do not have experience on
Windows. Thanks for checking.
Cheers.

Hi Matteo,
not sure what exactly you want to achieve, but you can do a union and
dissolve by doing a buffer with zero buffer distance and enabling the
dissolve result checkbox.

Regards,
Stefanos

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GetFeatureInfo, difference between JSON/XML
Message-ID: <1725a928dcaa6f530265f525451e84ece647cfa1.camel@palan.at>

Hi,

could somebody please explain why the fetching of a GetFeatureInfo
request in application/json format instead of text/xml does need to
query the layer again to get the feature values, again?

I am talking about qgswmsrenderer.cpp, method convertFeatureInfoToJson,
around line 2167. The conversion to json is the only one that needs to
re-fetch the feature data instead of using the "result" (QDomDocument)
directly.

Is this because we need to get the correct field types for json
conversion instead of returning just string values? Is this a real
necessity?
I noticed this because a postgis layer had problems with its id-column, 
and the json request failed while the xml request worked just fine. Of
course the id-column will be fixed, but the re-fetching of every
feature are also means that in the best case the db-query count goes up
from 1 to 1+<feature-cnt>.

Thanks for your input,
Tom

AFAICS there is no good reason, the dom document is only used to get
the layers list, if you are on it I would recommend you to skip the
line

QDomDocument result = featureInfoDocument( layers, mapSettings,
outputImage.get(), version );

in case the format is json and pass in the list of layers to render
instead of the doc to QgsRenderer::convertFeatureInfoToJson.

To give you some more context, json export format was implemented
recently, after the server refactoring that happened in 3.0, perhaps
this is the reason why it was added as another "switch" in the format
list.

Hi,

I found couple of minor issues in QGIS Server 3.10 and wanted to make some
test requests before posting issue, so it will be possible to replicate
issue.

So I build QGIS master and tried Development server, which I think is
really cool to try and test things.

For building I used this parameters
cmake -DWITH_SERVER=true -DWITH_GEOREFERENCER=false -DWITH_GRASS7=false ..

and then sudo make install

I can start development server. Output from start:

Any ideas what's wrong, something with my build?

I will try now with standard QGIS Server setup and see if it's working.

this is normally not required, you can install your build in your user
space with no sudo.

I'm probably missing something but you are NOT launching the binary
you have installed (globally as root)  a few lines above.

There is definitely something wrong with your build (probably the
paths), custom builds use custom paths and QGIS server needs to know
from where to load its services (WMS, WFS etc.) and APIs (OAPIF/WFS3).

The default path is /usr on Linux, but in your case I see that the
prefix path is correctly set to
/home/uros/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master/output where you should find
lib/qgis/server/libwms.so & C.

But your configuration is totally broken: no auth plugins, no Python
and no modules (you should see them listed in the server logs but they
are not there), my output is for example:

"Loading native module

You should check your paths.

What I do is:

- set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in cmake to the build directory
- never make install, just make
- prepare the environment by setting QGIS_PREFIX_PATH to the "output"
directory under your build directory (so: ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/output)
- run qgis binaries located in the ${QGIS_PREFIX_PATH}/bin directory
from the script that sets the correct environment

Hope this helps.

Hi Uroš,

QGIS Server is complaining about the missing
output/lib/libqgispython.so. That library should be generated by your
compilation. Can you check the compilation output? Make sure that
library exist (and the other libraries). You should have:

ls output/lib/lib*.0

output/lib/libqgis_analysis.so.3.13.0  output/lib/libqgis_core.so.3.13.0
 output/lib/libqgis_native.so.3.13.0  output/lib/libqgis_server.so.3.13.0
output/lib/libqgis_app.so.3.13.0       output/lib/libqgis_gui.so.3.13.0
  output/lib/libqgispython.so.3.13.0

I don't know if that is the problem, but there is something missing in
your build step.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Hi,

Thanks for responding and sorry for the mess. I tried again without
install, just "make" so I'm only using output directory from build_master.
So this now works. I understand I need only build folder so installing was
just messing everything. Response from development server is now

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Memory Leak / Slowdown?
Message-ID: <075ee04aee8a4617a4eec47ba1a2af67@vorarlberg.at>

Hi,
I use a Python-Script to load all shapefiles in a directory tree one by one and export the sld-files.
It works fine, but slows down incredible after ~100 files.
So I tried the following barebone script with just the essentials  (load shapefile, add it to the map canvas, remove it again and then clear the project) in a loop and I get the same behavior...

from datetime import datetime
for i in range(1, 1000):
                vlayer=QgsVectorLayer ("aShapeFile.shp" ,"run  " + str(i) + " at " + datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S') ,"ogr")
                QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
                QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(vlayer.id())
                QgsProject.instance().clear()

Same result,  the Script slows down after every iteration in the loop AND QGIS-memory consumption goes up!
Do I need to do some garbage cleaning / what am I doing wrong / is this a Memory leak?

Thanks everybody for any hints / help!

Peter

Hi,

please could the "ownership" of the following plugins be transferred to my OSGeo username "ejn" so that I can upload new releases:
* ComplexGmlInfo
* inspireatomclient
* wfsclient

The original author / maintainer (Jürgen Weichand) has already transferred the repositories to a new GitHub organisation to allow us to maintain these plugins from now on:
https://github.com/qgisinspiretools/

Many thanks in advance,

Edward

I agree it is :)

and honestly I think setting up a qgis server is not something many
people do. and the one who do, are probably ok with the language in the
user manual.

no you don't. apache has it's own mod_fcgi

Yeah it is why docker was invented, so nobody has to deal with this low level stuff :-P

Thanks, Jorge Gustavo.

Testing the latest QGIS 3.13.0-Master (8b61e24e96) on Windows, with GEOS
3.8.1-CAPI-1.13.3, it seems to me there is an inconsistency:

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)'))
returns
<QgsGeometry: null>

but

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Linestring (42 0, 43 0)'))
returns
<QgsGeometry: LineString EMPTY>

and

QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 2, 1 3, 1 2, 0
2))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((42 0, 43 1, 43 0, 42
0))'))
returns
<QgsGeometry: Polygon EMPTY>

Should QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon ((0 0, 1 1, 1 0, 0
0))').intersection(QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Point (42 0)')) return <QgsGeometry:
Point EMPTY>?


Regards.

Andrea

Hi Edward,
sure, I can do that. Just for the record, could you please ask the
original author to write me confiming the transfer?
Thanks.

Ok,

Ownership transferred after consulting Juergen

Please test.

There are more possible fields to update in the admin interface, it is
not fully clear to me which are nessecary.
One thin: while I updated the Author and Authors email (to reflect the
current contact), the 'Maintainer' is still set to the (non excisting?)
user JuergenWeichand, and I'm not able to update that...

Anyway, please test and report back if in trouble.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Peter,

Did you try this on a clean new profile with no plugins installed?

Hi,
I use a Python-Script to load all shapefiles in a directory tree one by one and export the sld-files.
It works fine, but slows down incredible after ~100 files.
So I tried the following barebone script with just the essentials  (load shapefile, add it to the map canvas, remove it again and then clear the project) in a loop and I get the same behavior…

from datetime import datetime
for i in range(1, 1000):
                vlayer=QgsVectorLayer ("aShapeFile.shp" ,"run  " + str(i) + " at " + datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S') ,"ogr")
                QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
                QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(vlayer.id())
                QgsProject.instance().clear()

Same result,  the Script slows down after every iteration in the loop AND QGIS-memory consumption goes up!
Do I need to do some garbage cleaning / what am I doing wrong / is this a Memory leak?

Thanks everybody for any hints / help!

Peter

Message-ID: <d6199dc7-6c20-5712-88ce-4eb4b90df82f@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Probably not important, but I get the following output when running my
build:

$ ninja install
[0/1] Re-running CMake...
-- QGIS version: 3.13.0 Master (31300)
...
-- Found Proj: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so version 7 (7.0.0)
...
-- Using PROJ 6 srs database.
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done

As you see I have libproj7 but 'using PROJ 6 srs db'?

I was wondering if I'm mixing proj6/7 stuff, or that the output is in
some way wrong?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Peter,  
  
It's possible that a part of the cleanup only happens on the next event loop run.  
  
Questions / things to try:  
  
- Do you really need to add them to the project or is a layer without adding it to the project good enough for your purpose?  
- Can you run this in batches of ~100 (or even 1) each and then trigger the next batch on a new event loop invocation, e.g. by using QTimer.singleShot()  
- The easiest thing would be calling QgsApplication.processEvents(), but be warned that using this is known for introducing instabilities, depending on the context in which it is called

Hi Matthias,
Thanks to your hints I found a way:
The script also works if I do not add the Layer to the Project but directly save the Sld-Style. So I can also skip clearing the QgsProject.instance.

vlayer=QgsVectorLayer (pfad ,sfileOhneExt,"ogr")
#QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
vlayer.saveSldStyle (sldpfad)
#QgsProject.instance().clear()

But besides my personal “success”: including the 2 Lines should not lead to rising time /memory consumption or am I wrong?
Should I make a ticket?

Peter

Hi Matthias,
Thanks to your hints I found a way:
The script also works if I do not add the Layer to the Project but directly save the Sld-Style. So I can also skip clearing the QgsProject.instance.

vlayer=QgsVectorLayer (pfad ,sfileOhneExt,"ogr")
#QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
vlayer.saveSldStyle (sldpfad)
#QgsProject.instance().clear()

But besides my personal “success”: including the 2 Lines should not lead to rising time /memory consumption or am I wrong?
Should I make a ticket?

Hi Peter,

It's possible that a part of the cleanup only happens on the next event loop run.

Questions / things to try:

- Do you really need to add them to the project or is a layer without adding it to the project good enough for your purpose?
- Can you run this in batches of ~100 (or even 1) each and then trigger the next batch on a new event loop invocation, e.g. by using QTimer.singleShot()
- The easiest thing would be calling QgsApplication.processEvents(), but be warned that using this is known for introducing instabilities, depending on the context in which it is called

Hi,
I use a Python-Script to load all shapefiles in a directory tree one by one and export the sld-files.
It works fine, but slows down incredible after ~100 files.
So I tried the following barebone script with just the essentials  (load shapefile, add it to the map canvas, remove it again and then clear the project) in a loop and I get the same behavior…

from datetime import datetime
for i in range(1, 1000):
                vlayer=QgsVectorLayer ("aShapeFile.shp" ,"run  " + str(i) + " at " + datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S') ,"ogr")
                QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)
                QgsProject.instance().removeMapLayer(vlayer.id())
                QgsProject.instance().clear()

Same result,  the Script slows down after every iteration in the loop AND QGIS-memory consumption goes up!
Do I need to do some garbage cleaning / what am I doing wrong / is this a Memory leak?

Thanks everybody for any hints / help!

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the hint with qgisserver-caddy I am going to take a look at
it ASAP.

And of course mod-fcgi in apache is available.
The question is: which way is the fastest and uses the least
ressources. So I wanted to try different webserver with different ways
of starting qgisserver.
There must be a reason why fastcgi and spawn-cgi and some others exist
;)

regards
Werner

Well,
Hard question depending a lot on your connection use cases. From the
benchmark E have been doing in production, NGINX seems to be better in most
situations.
I never tested caddy though.

Message-ID: <CAGKduJ2VC2RZJrhRb8GCbDDy-+4Q3ZW5CooTOhwfhZpF8ffPMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

see the comments below the answer this question:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/274148/setting-print-layout-to-portrait-using-qgis-3

I admit that the option is rather "hidden".

As as user, I tried to:

 1) go to Layout -> Layout Properties and I cannot see the page orientation
options in the Layout Properties;
 2) go to Layout -> Page setting, changed the orientation here but the
layout doesn't change.

In qgis 2, it was more easy and intuitive to set the page orientation

Would it be worth to also mention systemd as described here?
https://oslandia.com/en/2018/11/23/deploying-qgis-server-with-systemd/

I use this approach in production and it works nice.

Hi Gerald,
I also thought about this, I think it would be useful.
Would you  mind adding a pull request for it?
Cheers.

Message-ID: <9bf30a8a-ae43-b973-8c6b-ede728d5a9b1@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I noticed that if in one layout I remove one of the maps that has
depending objects (specifically a table, possibly anything) when I save
back the layout I get a crash. Anyone confirms? QGIS 3.10.
Cheers.

Great Paolo, I'll add a pull request with the systemd approach in the
next days.

I have a doubt about copyright issues so: My setup is heavily inspired
by the Oslandia tutorial, and they have copyright on it. Should I make a
short description and link to their tutorial for further information so?
I don't see any hints about the common approach in the Documentation
Guidelines.

Thanks

Maybe I should ask them to donate this post to QGIS Documentation? Or
better to make a short resume and link to their post?

Hi all,
further tests seem to confirm that the crash does not happen for local
files, but only when a project is opened through a sftp service,
admittedly a corner case.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Feature's secondary geometry columns in
	expressions and python
Message-ID: <CAExk7p2xKz3Q-s3i_tJOaOER6eRXR=+Q73t4jK=UBjCzJVxuUw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

It's not exactly clear how secondary geometry columns are to be used from
QgsExpressions or Python code.

Just to be clear, by secondary geometry columns, I mean geometries stored
in other columns that the one that is used to display the features on the
map, typically a "center_point" field storing a Point on a Polygon layer.

When accessing them both in expression or Python, it seems it returns a
string with the ewkt representation (at least for postgis layers). This is
not really nice, as the only way to use it with functions such as make_line
is to strip the SRID from the text to get proper wkt, then to make the
create the feature using from_wkt.

This means instead of the nice and clear :
make_line( closest_point( $geometry, "center_point"), "center_point" )
You need :
make_line( closest_point( $geometry, geom_from_wkt( substr( "center_point",
strpos("center_point", ';') + 1) )), geom_from_wkt( substr( "center_point",
strpos("center_point", ';') + 1) ) )

It's also probably quite inefficient, which is an issue when used for
geometry generators.

Is there a limitation preventing to return QgsGeometries directly ? If not,
would it make sense to change QGIS to do so ? Does anyone have an efficient
workaround in the mean time ?

Thanks :-)

You didn't include the postinstall batch files (at least).  Either check
package-nightly.cmd / package.cmd to see which other files are created or run
package-nightly.cmd, extract the resulting package to addons and run
creatensis.pl thereafter (excluding qgis-dev - as you would get two QGIS' in
your installer otherwise).

Subject: QGIS installation error from own build
To: <qgis-developer at lists.osgeo.org>, <qgis-user at lists.osgeo.org>, <
qgis-community-team at lists.osgeo.org>


I am building *QGIS 3.10.5* on Windows 10 Pro and Visual Studio 2015.
Everything is going right and solution build successful and installed in
OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-test folder. After that I had run perl creatensis.pl in
command prompt and it create a package with name
*“QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.5-1-Setup-x86_64”* with is default download, which run
successful after installation.

When I copied my build files from qgis-test folder to
“..\ms-windows\osgeo4w\unpacked-x86_64\apps\qgis” and copied
“OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-test/bin/qgis.exe” to
“..\ms-windows\osgeo4w\unpacked-x86_64\bin and rename *qgis.exe*to
*qgis-bin*”. After that run perl creatensis.pl I get
“QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.5-2-Setup-x86_64.exe”.

After installation I get following error:

Error loading QGIS
Oops, looks like an error loading QGIS
Details:
Could not load qgis_app.dll
Windows Error: The specified module could not be found.
Help:
Check C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.10\bin\qgis-bin.env for correct environment
paths


[image: error.PNG]

Earlier I also get the same error hence I format my system and install
fresh Window 10 Pro, but now again I am getting the same error. Is there
any bug during packaging? Any solution

Good discussion! This has bothered me for a long time too. Quite some
time ago I submitted a PR which exposed secondary geometry columns as
proper QgsGeometry values, which meant that they could be used
directly in expressions (just like you want). You can see this and
some discussion at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3950

The difficulties came in handling CRS for these secondary columns, because:
1. there's no guarantee that they match the layer's CRS
2. while we're handling (1), we should consider the case that
individual values in the same field for different features MAY have
different CRS to each other.

This discussion was never really resolved in the PR, and it ended up
getting closed as stale. There's also work required to ensure that
editing features with these secondary geom columns works as expected,
and doesn't corrupt the secondary geometry values.

When we've worked out the overall design, we'd then need to implement
this handling on a provider-by-provider basis (at least, for those
providers which do support additional geometry columns).

I'd love to see someone pick up my initial work (or fund its
completion). I think it's a sore point in QGIS currently which would
be great to address.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Stale PRs best practice
Message-ID: <1587633399761-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
I would like to ask what would be considered best practice for an issuer to
handle stale pull requests. In the cases that a review was made and further
changes are expected from the contributor, it is obvious that unless the
changes are applied the PR should be closed. My question is about PRs that
have received no suggestions or no comments whatsoever. I don't want in any
way to sound pushy, I can see the length of the PR list and I know most (if
not all) are just donating time to the project, that's why I ask here.
Should I just close and reopen the PR to reset the stale timer and wait?
Should I add an "up" comment to reset stale timer or a comment asking for
attention?
Should I ask someone specific for a review? (who?)

Best regards,
Stefanos

Hi Patrick,

If you want to run processing algorithm in qgis server you will need to 
write a dedicated server plugin for that, if may fullfill your

needs if you are not too much demanding. If you intend to run Qgis 
processing as a service then I strongly suggest to look at the WPS 
protocol in a dedicated

server.

Hi,

Can you elaborate what do you mean with "how to run processing algorithms
in Qqis server?" ?

Do you mean providing an WPS service on your server?
Or do you mean to run Processing algorithms with a standalone application?
Look what has been done in QGIS 3.13 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34617
Before 3.13, there are some scripts on the internet to launch Processing
algs as a small executable.

Hi,

Yes, I want to provide a WPS service based on qgis processing algorithm 
in a web app


Thank you

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Understanding inter-plugin dependencies and plugin
 loading - what can a plugin expect from a dependency?
Message-ID: <f333939e-feed-89b4-70a6-9064bf81832e@pleiszenburg.de>

Hi all,

working my way through the current plugin (dependency) installer
mechanism, I have a few questions.

Bottom line: What kind of assumptions can a plugin safely make about its
dependencies and their initialization (from QGIS' perspective)?

Imagine two plugins: "PluginA" and "PluginB". PluginA depends on
PluginB, i.e. if a user was installing PluginA, current QGIS would ask
him to install PluginB as well.

Now the plugin system in QGIS does three things actually:

- Installing and uninstalling plugins
- Loading (i.e. importing, in Python terms) and unloading plugins
- Starting and stopping (`initGui` + friends and `unload`)

In comparison, typical package managers usually do not care about the
loading and starting part. This is because usually a package installer
does run outside of the scope of the stuff that is using the packages.

So if a user was installing PluginA in QGIS, the following sequence
would be triggered:

- Install PluginA
- Find dependencies of PluginA: PluginB
- Install PluginB
- Load PluginB
- Start PluginB
- Load PluginA
- Start PluginA

PluginB would be loaded (imported) and started before PluginA. Depending
on the use-case, this can make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, if a user
was restarting QGIS, the loading and starting sequence would depend on
(as it appears) the order of plugin folders on the filesystem which can
be more or less "random". So here, PluginA can not rely on PluginB to
have been loaded and/or started in advance at the moment.

This leads to many potential problems, some of which were discussed here
(Nyall's comment being the most interesting one for me):

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/132#issuecomment-460136324

So the question now is: How is PluginA supposed to interact with PluginB?

Thanks to the way `sys.path` is configured in QGIS, PluginA could easily
run `import PluginB` and it would actually work. QGIS has a modified
`builtins.__import__` method which would even track this import. This
would sort of allow to treat PluginB as a "normal" Python package and be
equivalent to `qgis.utils.loadPlugin("PliginB")`, for better or for worse.

A possible alternative is that PluginA requires PluginB to initialize
itself through `classFactory` (or `serverClassFactory`). PluginA's best
(and probably safest) option then would be to run
`qgis.utils.startPlugin("PluginB")` (or `startProcessingPlugin` /
`startServerPlugin`). PluginA could now basically access the instance of
PluginB's class through `qgis.utils.plugins["PluginB"]` (or
`server_plugins`).

All of the above is fragile in many ways and - as far as I can tell -
more or less undocumented. How much of the described API in `qgis.utils`
is supposed to be available to "the public", i.e. to plugins?

As far as I can see, only one plugin (for QGIS 3.8 or later) in the
plugin repository actually uses inter-plugin dependencies (properly), so
there are not many examples of how things should look like. QEP 132 also
is not really detailed about the exact behavior and assumptions a
plugin's author can make. Fortunately, the current lack of "downstream"
users and the lack of "established" documentation opens the option to
"fix" the system without breaking too much stuff if desired.

Final questions:

- How is the *current* plugin-dependency system supposed to be used /
not supposed to be used from your perspective?
- How do you envision an actual plugin-dependency system to work (with
respect to interactions between plugins)?
- Does it make sense to care about plugin dependencies when QGIS is
loading and starting plugins (so dependencies are loaded & started first)?

Best regards,
Sebastian

I'd say:
1. Do everything you can to make the PR easy to review first -- make
sure all tests are passing, the commit log is clean (free of merge
commits and squashed to logic commits), and that there's no merge
conflicts

2. Then, if someone has already reviewed:
    - make sure ALL comments have been resolved. Then do a gentle
"ping @person this is ready for re-review now"
    - if you haven't resolved all outstanding comments (e.g. because
you disagree with something), then:
          a) if it's "just" a question of coding style, API choice, or
use of QGIS/Qt APIs: trust the reviewer. Better to take a step back on
your arguments and make the QGIS maintainers/reviewers happy and see
your work merged, then fight because you think QGIS coding
conventions/established API style is "wrong".
          b) If the reviewer is wrong (e.g. they've misinterpreted
what the change does) you'll need to present your counterarguments
politely (don't get the reviewers off-side! We all make mistakes, but
are MUCH more likely to return to review a PR if the submitter is
polite and working WITH you!)

If no one has reviewed yet, it's probably the case that an initial PR
was submitted in a partially complete state or which was failing units
tests, and we're just not aware that the work is now ready for review.
Do a gentle bump "This PR is ready for review"

Hope that helps!

I am building *QGIS 3.10.5* on Windows 10 Pro and Visual Studio 2015.
Everything is going right and solution build successful and installed in
OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-test folder. After that I had run perl creatensis.pl in
command prompt and it create a package with name
*“QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.5-1-Setup-x86_64”* with is default download, which run
successful after installation.

When I copied my build files from qgis-test folder to
“..\ms-windows\osgeo4w\unpacked-x86_64\apps\qgis” and copied
“OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-test/bin/qgis.exe” to
“..\ms-windows\osgeo4w\unpacked-x86_64\bin and rename *qgis.exe*to
*qgis-bin*”. After that run perl creatensis.pl I get
“QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.5-2-Setup-x86_64.exe”.

After installation I get following error:

Error loading QGIS
Oops, looks like an error loading QGIS
Details:
Could not load qgis_app.dll
Windows Error: The specified module could not be found.
Help:
Check C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.10\bin\qgis-bin.env for correct environment

Earlier I also get the same error hence I format my system and install
fresh Window 10 Pro, but now again I am getting the same error. Is there
any bug during packaging? Any solution

Hi,

We submitted this plugin for the repository a little while ago (
https://github.com/mapaction/mapexport-qgis3), and Paolo suggested looking
into merging with other plugins covering similar ground. We're happy to do
this (see earlier thread), but in the meantime we'd like the plugin to go
into the repository in its current form if that's possible - this would
help us in managing it, and our users in installing/keeping up to date. Let
us know if  there's anything else we need to do.

many thanks
Ant

It was removed. This functionality should be in the Resource Sharing plugin.

thanks a lot for insisting. Did you also write directly to the original
auhtors of similar plugins as well? I'm not sure they are reading this list.
I'm available for help.

Message-ID: <001601d61b16$b72fc540$258f4fc0$@yahoo.com.br>

Hi everyone,

Sometimes I got "NaN" return when trying to get scalar value to a point from a Mesh layer. I guess the reason is that it was not rendered previously as said in the documentation.

<https://qgis.org/api/classQgsMeshLayer.html#a07cb62f04b64979500d3873afb580216>
QgsMeshDatasetValue:
"Note:
    It uses previously cached and indexed triangular mesh and so if the layer has not been rendered previously (e.g. when used in a script) it returns NaN value"

When I turn ON and OFF the loaded mesh layer in the active project it Works!

I would like to know if there is a proper way to render the mesh layer, before get values.

Below is my code:

proj = QgsProject.instance()
layerPto = iface.activeLayer() # a Point layer
layer = proj.mapLayersByName("mesh01")[0] # a Mesh layer
dataset = QgsMeshDatasetIndex(0,0)
for feat in layerPto.getSelectedFeatures():
    ptoGeo = feat.geometry()
    pt = ptoGeo.asPoint()
    value = layer.datasetValue(dataset, pt).scalar()
    print('elevation={}'.format(value))

Hi devs,
it is possible or integrate the roadmap of releases in a shared calendar?

The idea is to receive in the Calendar the releases dates through calendar

I don't know if this make sense please let me know if I need to clarify

Hi,

With QGIS master you can use updateTriangularMesh.
<https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsMeshLayer.html#qgis.core.QgsMeshLayer.updateTriangularMesh>
Before, there is a workaround that consists to just call createMapRenderer
<https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.12/core/QgsMeshLayer.html#qgis.core.QgsMeshLayer.createMapRenderer>
without using the renderer.

Hi everyone,

Sometimes I got "NaN" return when trying to get scalar value to a point from a Mesh layer. I guess the reason is that it was not rendered previously as said in the documentation.

QgsMeshDatasetValue:
"Note:
    It uses previously cached and indexed triangular mesh and so if the layer has not been rendered previously (e.g. when used in a script) it returns NaN value"

When I turn ON and OFF the loaded mesh layer in the active project it Works!

I would like to know if there is a proper way to render the mesh layer, before get values.

Below is my code:

proj = QgsProject.instance()
layerPto = iface.activeLayer() # a Point layer
layer = proj.mapLayersByName("mesh01")[0] # a Mesh layer
dataset = QgsMeshDatasetIndex(0,0)
for feat in layerPto.getSelectedFeatures():
    ptoGeo = feat.geometry()
    pt = ptoGeo.asPoint()
    value = layer.datasetValue(dataset, pt).scalar()
    print('elevation={}'.format(value))

Thanks Vincent for the document donation.

I just submitted a pull request with the systemd approach (#5356). It's
mainly taken from the mentioned tutorial from oslandia. Feel free to
make the adaptations you consider appropriate.

thanks
Gerald

Yes, please! That would be super handy.

I have also though about a display like this

Good idea indeed.
I'd leave the implementation to the Release Manager, but I think a
simple and good option would be:
https://nextcloud.osgeo.org/apps/calendar/
In fact, all Osgeo projects could add their schedule here.
I'm available for help if necessary.
Cheers.

 Hi again,

I did a little search and the QGIS Roadmap from the QGIS website is based
on Google Sheets that is updated and then upload to the website through
python scripting. We can use this Google sheets and try to sync as calendar
events

I've check this if we use the Google Sheets approach:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/source/site/getinvolved/development/schedule.inc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOggwSls7xQ - Using google sheets to add
calendar events in a calendar
We need to create a Google Calendar with a name QGIS Roadmap (for example)
and point the Google sheets to this Calendar. Then is necessary to share in
ics format. See ics format export help:
https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/15813833?hl=en


By the other hand based on what Paolo and Angelos said I've check this and
if we adopt the OSGeo nextcloud approach:
https://help.nextcloud.com/t/download-ics-file-by-script/15086/2 (quick
search to see if is compatible with ics export link.)

If I not wrong the open standard calendar is .ics (https://icalendar.org/)
so I guess It useful to have this format to be interoperable with everyone
and create a way to share this data in a graphic plot and/or table as
Nathan suggests.

In terms of permissions to the users, in both approaches, it's necessary to
create a global user with reading permissions to get access to the .ics
file and add to their Calendar's provider. And have a visual look as a
table or graphic plot.

I identify these two approaches base in this little talk if you have more
ideas you're welcome. Please correct me if I said some mistake or don't
consider something that I didn't aware.

Best regards,
João

There's now a calendar at https://qgis.org/schedule.ics

Hi Jurgen,

thank you for your fast reply and change. Amazing.

I did tests integration in MS Outlook, Gmail Calendar and Thunderbird and
works like a charm so I guess this can work well for the rest apps.

@Nathan you are thinking about the plot roadmap and table schedule in the
sphinx side where is the roadmap. Is this the idea?

Best regards,
João

Hi all,

sorry for my lengthy email last week - but this issue is still spinning
in my head and blocking progress in my test-bed plugin installer
re-implementation.

PR#9619 actually has two interesting comments ...

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9619#issuecomment-476499538
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/9619#issuecomment-476550817

... in terms of use-cases for inter-plugin dependencies, their current
limitations and their (potential) correct use. The second comment is
interesting in terms of how one plugin should correctly expose a
"stable" API to other plugins: By injecting code into `qgis.plugins` *at
runtime* and exposing something like for instance
`qgis.plugins.QuickWkt`. The idea is interesting but it essentially
suffers from what I described: The absolutely non-deterministic loading
sequence. So it is not an actual, reliable solution at the moment -
unless the plugin requiring this API does some serious checking prior to
accessing its desired API and calls into the mostly undocumented API of
`qgis.utils` as a fallback solution.

How should a plugin author handle this at the moment (with QGIS 3.8 to
3.12)?

Best regards,
Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

it's not entirely clear to me what problem you are trying to solve,
but as far as loading of python modules is concerned, it is probably
useful to distinguish two situations:

1. installation of a plugin that depends on another one
2. plugin loading when QGIS application start

For (1) there is not much you can do except try/except and/or warn the
user that a QGIS application restart might be required for the plugin
to work after the dependencies have been installed.
For (2) you can have a plugin listen to initializationCompleted, at
that point in time all your plugins will be loaded, and the plugin can
make its own "post-initialization".


Hope this helps.

Kind regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Default action when layer is double-clicked - GUI
	behavior discussion
Message-ID: <CAL9iSMGkxB-QxtpWeJNKCpuk-1++7RXa6bMT9XVup=mJUAADgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have one big annoyance in QGIS UI which is already programmed so it's not
a feature request, and It's not a bug either, so I'm posting it here for
discussion and not on github.

The thing is when you actually use QGIS to get some answers from data, not
when you set up project, and that is, I believe well over 50% QGIS usage in
practice (real life). For example, you open up project, filter some data
from attribute data, overlap it with other data, again open up attribute
data, calculate something (do many other steps...) and in the end you
export data to some format that you need for your job.

The thing is, that I expect that when you double click on layer (and I
suppose everyone else who is using QGIS) is to open up attribute data
table, because that is where the bigger part of data is.
My assumption is based on the fact that almost every other program on your
computer uses this approach to get to properties panel: "right click > menu
> properties". That is a standard procedure that's baked in to operating
systems, and almost all GUI programs follow it. In QGIS we have, by
default, different approach, double click opens up properties panel, and to
get to features data you have to go to "right click > open attribute data".
Think of this as when you use file manager if you want to open folder you
have to "right click -> open folder" and if you double-click it, it opens
up properties of that folder.
Additional problem is that there is no icon to open attribute data table
just above list of layers, you have to go all to the other way of screen
just to show attribute table. (I'm talking from beginners perspective -
from someone who is using the program for the first time, and that is not
intuitive if you ask me).

So, my proposal is to change default behavior upon installation in
"Settings > Canvas & Legend > Layer legend > Double-click action in legend"
to "Open attribute table" instead of "Open layers properties". This would
satisfy most of regular users, program will be a little bit more user
friendly, and "project managers" (who is working a lot with setting up
projects) can always return to old behavior in settings.

Hi Alessandro,

thanks for the answer!

> [...] it is probably useful to distinguish two situations:
> 
> 1. installation of a plugin that depends on another one
> 2. plugin loading when QGIS application start

Yes, exactly. I am interested in situation 2 and all of its associated
edge cases.

> For (2) you can have a plugin listen to initializationCompleted, at
> that point in time all your plugins will be loaded, and the plugin can
> make its own "post-initialization".

I'd agree to that. Let's just say PluginA depends on functionality of
PluginB. PluginB could be a "library" for PluginA (and other plugins)
but also potentially offer some functionality to a user directly.

Scenario A: If PluginB was not waiting for `initializationCompleted`
then all of its stuff would be present by the time PluginA has waited
for `initializationCompleted`. Ok, this would solve a few (edge?) cases.

Scenario B: Both plugins wait for `initializationCompleted` (or both do
not). It is either PluginA which gets to go first or PluginB. It's not
deterministic which plugin "receives" `initializationCompleted` first.
You're again stuck in a situation where there is no guarantee for
PluginA to work as expected - unless its author taps into `qgis.utils`
and does some non-trivial error handling.

I am not trying to solve a specific problem (yet). I am more interested
in how this mechanism is supposed to be correctly used by plugins like
PluginA and PluginB at the moment ... as in the kind of recommendations
or "best practices" that should be encouraged (and documented). Once I
have understood that, I'd like to figure out what kind of potential
subsequent problems have to be addressed then (or whether there are any
problems at all).

I'd also (more or less independently) like to know how much of the API
in `qgis.utils` is a "fair target" for plugin authors and how much of
this API is entirely meant to be "private" (and should not be touched by
plugins).

Best regards,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <B1BDA7B93091A044A4878A686846FDB7021E48893D@SRVEXMB12.master.local>

Hi All,
   is it possible to have the postgres connection used  by a vector layer using python with qgis 3 ?
In qgis 2 I read the layer connection properties where I found login and password.
A simple example to create a postgres connection used by a vector layer:
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(layer.dataProvider().dataSourceUri())

Now in layer.dataProvider().dataSourceUri() I find authConfigId property instead of login and password but I don’t know how to use it.
This is because the new authorization system in qgis which permits to avoid to write login and password in the qgis project file.

Thank you for help

Roberto Poltini

Hi list,

Just a heads up that unless someone fixes the recently flaky
PyQgsServerWMSGetPrint test I'll be adding this test to the travis
blacklist shortly.

This test is randomly crashing with no clues -- see e.g.
https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=18996963&build=40255

I've spent some time trying to diagnose the cause with no luck, and
cannot afford to spend more time on this.

You've 24 hours to respond/fix.. ;)

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

I agree, but today is holiday in most countries and and I would
probably wait until monday.

That test is quite important, it saved our day a few times in the past.

(note that this is not a commitment from me to to fix it).

Hi Nyall,

I have opened an issue about it and tried to fix it with no clue.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/35973
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/35984

The segfault appears randomly since I tried to fix a regression and added
more PyQgsServerWMSGetPrint tests.

Before deactivate the PyQgsServerWMSGetPrint test, it will be great to
merge the pull request to provide better QGIS Server code.

Regards,
René-Luc
