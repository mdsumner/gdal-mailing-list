OK, so it must be a local problem. I'll investigate further.
Which kind of HW do you have?

You can set a ticket as bounty, and put an amount on it.
However, we would be happy of exploring eLance, if you suggest is feasible.
Can you let us know more about it?
Thanks.

Hi all, i dont know elance but i was thinkig that setting bounty would
adress more usual qgis dev than others. I think this is good since it is an
opportunity for qgis devs to find contractors.
Using an extra service will target more people which might be good (new
devs) or bad (maybe just "hit and run" devs).
Ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer: font-size regression
Message-ID: <e572edd3c8e8d7afeab8d63062e41ae6@carto.net>

 Hi,

 With the recent improvements to allow font-size adjustments in 
 menus/dialogues there is a small new regression:

 In Print composer the font-size of a label element is now restricted to 
 the font-size one selects in the global settings for menu/dialogue 
 font-sizes (Settings --> Options --> Menu Size).

 I tried to open a ticket, but currently I can't reach hub.qgis.org from 
 my workplace.

 Thank you for looking into this issue!

 Andreas

As sip creates the files that cmake expects before the crash, so cmake doesn't
re-run sip.  But the header file that sip didn't create is still necessary to
compile the output...

Interestingly in the nightly builds sip only crashes on Ubuntu Natty 32bit.  It
works find on Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, Natty 64bit and Debian squeeze.  Debian
unstable is probably fine too - but the build script didn't cope with natty
producing just one of two architectures.

On Windows it crashed too, but I patched sip on osgeo4w with [1].

Hallo J?rgen und Marco,

Bez?glich diesem Problem habe ich nun das Ticket erfasst:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4937

Wen von euch beiden darf ich bitten das Problem mal anzusehen.

Ich mache im Moment ziemlich viel Print Layouts und da ist das schon
ziemlich einschr?nkend, wenn man die Fontgr?sse des Labels nicht ?ndern
kann.

Bei der Legende klappt die Font-Gr?sse, aber bei normalen Textlabeln nicht.

Danke falls ihr mal Zeit f?r dieses Problem findet!

Hi

This is caused by the call to setStyleSheet in the composer:

(qgscomposer.cpp: 323) setStyleSheet( QString( "font-size: %1pt; " 
).arg( fontSize ) );

It seems this is propagated through all children down to the 
QFontDialogs. With a quick google, I only found this:

http://lists.qt.nokia.com/pipermail/qt-interest/2011-January/030939.html

So easiest solution is probably to have the QFontDialogs with 0 parents 
to avoid propagation.
Any better solutions?

Regards,
Marco

Hi Alex,

that didn't worked for me, but I'm not sure I have made it the right
way.

anyway, anybody knows is rpy2 was updated in osgeo4w? I'm being mailed
by people who uses R under QGIS and it stopped working.

Cheers

rpy was updated from the project's binaries.  rpy2 doesn't have windows builds
and therefore wasn't updated.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/256.

 Hi,

 Is there WMTS?support in QGIS or anything planned in this direction?

 Thanks for letting me know,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer redesign
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9tf-yifBYJ6VC28ASoSZ+VFxNL_PvWCRTs=Jm34VqhWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Tonight I did some tweaking to the composer window.  A few things had been
bugging me a for a while now and I decided I would have a go at fixing some
of them, or at least try to anyway.

The general changes are:

   - Redesign the composition (general) tab to remove the need
   to vertical scroll, in most cases. (Not a perfect redesign but it works IMO
   much better then the old layout)
   - Remove wasted space around paper area and widget (see picture[1] vs
   your install to see the difference)
   - Convert the split widget + tab widget to QDockWidgets. 1) The splitter
   didn't remember its last position or state 2) Could only view one tab at a
   time 3) The main QGIS window uses dock widgets to allow flexibility in
   screen layout, composer should too. 4) Can't hide tabs if you don't need to
   see them all the time e.g. command history . Using dock widgets solves all
   of these issues.

The current working branch can be found at
https://github.com/NathanW2/Quantum-GIS/tree/composer-redesign

I have also attached [1] an annotated screen shot if you don't want
to compile the branch.

If I could get some general feeback and testing that would be good, keep in
mind it's not a final copy and I will tweak things as I go.

I'm currently adding it so the dock windows remember the state, just like
the main QGIS dock widgets, but that isn't in the branch yet.

Thanks,
Nathan

 Hi Nathan,

 In general I like your redesign.

 Regarding the vertical scrollbars: they aren't removed, are they? When 
 redesigning the print composer, please think about small netbook and 
 smartphone screens where the vertical scrollbars and tabs are the only 
 means of reaching all UI elements. Those are the reasons why they were 
 introduced in the first place.

 One thing I don't like currently is the drawing of the basic shapes 
 (rects, circles, triangles). In normal drawing applications one selects 
 the shape first and then draws it. In Print Composer you always draw a 
 circle first (even if you usually want a rect) and later change the 
 shape to what you want. This is not very streamlined. I would prefer to 
 have a drop-down button that allows to select the shape first (like the 
 align and order buttons) and then start drawing.

 I did not test your branch though.

 Andreas

Message-ID: <4F2ABA9B.90007@faunalia.it>

Hi all.

While converting to an offline project, I'm getting:

ERRORE: 29 geometrie non aggiunte.

Errori del provider:

SQLite error: constraint failed

SQL: INSERT INTO 
"Province"("Geometry","gid","area","perimeter","provincia","ettari","label_dim","label_ang","color","bold","x","y","centroid") 
VALUES (GeomFromWKB(?, 3003),?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)

This seems to be due to an unrecognized CRS (it appears as custom in SL, 
it is 3003 in the original table).

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 1.7.4 Beta - removed projection EPSG:102067
Message-ID: <4F2AC41C.9050703@gmail.com>

Hi,

In Slovak and Czech republic, we are mostly using S-JTSK East/North
projection, which is not standardized by any official authority (EPSG,
..) We use ESRI code 102067 for that.
This projection was removed in 1.7.4 (was in 1.7.3 as EPSG:102067).
It seems, that it was done in 42e02d82c05b4da370be77ef71345ba62457cc66
as the result of #4652.

If we want to clean EPSG database, the solution could be to add this
projection under some other authority (ESRI or OSGEO ..).
It is essential, because currently we are not able to load any WMS layer
in that projection, which is issue affecting all CzechoSlovak users
(QGIS is not able to correctly load WMS layer in unknown projection).

spatialreference.org is currently down. Here are projection parameters:

PROJ4:
+proj=krovak +lat_0=49.5 +lon_0=24.83333333333333
+alpha=30.28813975277778 +k=0.9999 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel +units=m

Hi all

I just successfully compiled 1_7 on ubuntu 11.10.
Qgis Server seems to work smoothly, and Qgis Desktop too wich my projects.

One question though : how can I know the changes (commits and solved bugs)
between says 1.7.3 and this release ? A redmine query will surely do the
trick, but I do not know which parameters to choose.

Thanks anyway !
Michael

Nevertheless 1.7.4 will be the "strk" release anyway. :)

Hello,

The doodle [1] showed that most people would prefer 13-15 april, even if it is 
not so clear. But in fact we find a location for this period.

Could we go ahead and formalized the location? Do we need a PSC/dev vote?

Thanks,

Y.

Hi all

I'm getting the same error trying to compile latest trunk on Ubuntu
11.10 (Oneiric) 32 bit. Is there some way to solve this without
messing around with sip source? Borys, did you solve it?

No rush though, I can wait until the release :)

I was just wondering "how" and with which tool you do this kind of
changelog : I hope you do not need to do it manually each time ?

Hi guys, still no success on Wheezy.
Seems the problem began after SIP update to 4.13.1-3
Sid repository contains exactly the same version, so I expect the same 
problem. Probably downgrading to Squeeze's SIP 4.10 should help, unfortunately 
it's going to break a lot of dependences and I can't risk these days...

Don't panic :) The vertical scroll bars are still there, it's just designed
to reduce the need to use them in most cases.

Message-ID: <4F2B7994.1070401@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry to come again with the same problem.
( http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-January/018047.html )

I'll try to ask a different question:
Is there anyway to access the QCursor within QgsMapToolEmitPoint. I see 
there is a mCursor, but it's protected.

Any help will be really appreciated!

Greetings,

Denis

Hey Denis,

The QCursor setPos<http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/qcursor.html#setPos>
methods are static so you shouldn't need to get access to the instance to
move the cursor position.

In ohloh we have something similar (but unfortunately we lost our

I was going to get a csv dump out redmine and generate something like this
at one stage (a simple version anyway).

The current problem is the the redmine export limit is too low so you can't
export all the issue out, only get about 500 when there a lot more.
There is a limit variable that you can increase, can we get that increased
to allow a bigger dump out?

Hi all.
I'm intersecting a polygon (one IT region) with a complex layer 
(corine), with fTools.
The operation is extremely long, but what is worst is that when it gets 
to 100%, it keeps on running without stopping.
Data can be downloaded from wfs:

Anyone confirms?
Thanks.

I'v had similar experiences with the intersect tool and dissolve tool with
large shapefiles (Windows 7 64 bits). Sometimes QGIS just crashes before
the processing ends.

There's this ticket about "Dissolve", that is similar in nature

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3828

There's a general problem with vector geoprocessing in QGIS, which is very
slow. Arcgis, Grass and SAGA are considerably faster.

It's actually not a QGIS problem, but a problem in SIP (and apparently only on
some 32bit platforms).   And it might not be tied to an sip upgrade, but to
exception support in SIP that QGIS now uses.

Hi Nathan

The changes to the composer UI look great.
+1 for integrating into master branch.

Follow-up : two new drivers to read and write ODS and XLSX files have been 
incorporated into GDAL/OGR trunk. I've blogged about it at

Giovanni, maybe we should take this question to the rpy mailing list to
figure out what's needed to build rpy2 on windows.

The good news I think we've identified that particular issue and have at
least started down the road to solving. See the osgeo graphics email
list. Iconography is somewhere even non coders can easily help.

FYI, I +others converted over 100 icons from pdf/font to svg in a 2 hour
sprint a few months back. We should add something to pull them into QGIS
source for inclusion. Only hold up was that I couldn't get the svg fill
stuff worked out.

Very cool - are these icons the ones that you can access already
via the style manager SVG options?

No these icons are converted from public domain US government sets, as
of Oct 2011. They have not been incorporated into QGIS yet, but will be
shortly. After talking with Nathan and Gary I think we can find a way to
pull a copy from the osgeo svn every once in a while, say when building
a new release, so maybe they'll be in QGIS 1.7.4

Alternately maybe a plugin should be made to pull them in as an optional
thing.

Thanks,

Hey Andreas,

I have changed the add shape to now behave like this.  In the future it
might be best to create a whole toolbar just for drawing stuff but for now
this will do.

I did have some ideas about creating a way to have custom objects so that
you could create a title block from an image, a legend and a label, then
save it as its own object you can drop onto the canvas pre-built. However
that is a little out of my skills and time at the moment so I'll leave that
up to someone else to play with if they are game.

Hi,

This discussion came up already, but just in case this was forgotten:
I generated a set of about 1000 svg color icons for QGIS, based on OSM
icons.
Available here as public domain:

http://www.mediafire.com/?jiooxkbmyzgr0

Sample use visible in this video:

(Customizing OSM map with osm2postgresql & QGIS )

Hope this helps,
Mayeul

Hi, at the moment I don't think it woulb be wise to include that much 
symbols without changing the way they are presented to user. They have 
to be sorted in categories and never loaded all at once.

Agreed; this has been discussed several times, I think there is a ticket opened on it.
I think we should:
- divide the symbols into categories
- avoid re-rendering the preview (very slow for hundreds of symbols), possibly caching it
- add a plugin, similar to the plugin installer, to download (better also upload)
sets of symbols from a common repo.
It should not be a lot of work, any taker? Any sponsor?
All the best.

Hey All,

Changes have been integrated into master at
da2d7db41<https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/da2d7db41a1cace3bbdf22305f581e93c8107603>

I have made some changes to some of the item property widgets to reduce
scrolling; layout the controls; and reduce visual clutter e.g unneeded
group boxes.

Let me know if you run into any issue with the refactor. None of
the behavior should have changed as it was mostly all cosmetic stuff.

Hi,

I second that - please do not add additional SVG symbols without
previously improving the tool to organize the symbols. We will only end
up with tons of symbols (that only a minority needs) slowing down QGIS
considerably when dealing with point or patterns.

Also, we should distinguish between SVG suitable for point symbolization
and pattern fills. Not all of the symbols are suitable for both ...

In addition, many single color SVG symbols should be changed to allow
for easy change of stroke, fill and stroke-width - see
http://www.sourcepole.com/svg-symbols-in-qgis-with-modifiable-colors

---------------

As to the criticism: when reading this, I was quite annoyed - while it
is true, that the situation with SVG symbols, and the lack of quality
symbols should be improved - but the second part of the criticism -
having to learn three tools instead of just one, is so out of context
and plain wrong.

How is ESRI any better in this respect? If you want to use a spatial
database with ESRI you also have to learn how to maintain the database -
on the other hand you can also work with QGIS without having to learn
Postgis (using spatialite or SHP-files) - and since when is tilemill a
necessity to publish a map? And since when does plain ESRI arcview
include a functionality similar to Postgis and Tilemill without having
to pay for extra modules? Last time I checked, it didn't.

People should really help to improve the situation rather than complaining.

Just my opinion,
Andreas

I agree Andreas.  Gray, Alex and I had a bit of a rant on IRC about this,
well I did anyway ;)

Another point to add is: Even if you do want to use tilemill, PostGIS is
not needed. Tilemill takes shape, kml, postgis and a host of different
formats.

Saying "I just give ESRI money so I don't have to learn PostGIS" isn't very
professional, more lazy.  If you don't want to learn another tech that's
fine but just thinking that paying someone is the answer to that is
lazyness.

cool thanks! yeah - of course one can improve the drawing tools - but
the question is how far one should go. There are more powerful tools for
drawing complex elements, like Inkscape.

Currently one can use the templates. This works fine for my purpose.

Thanks for the improvements. No issues so far - I will send a bug-report

Hello,

I have just built QGIS from master (up to date on the 5/02 15h56) to test qgis 
server.

I already have this message:
> Configuration file problem : perhaps you left off the .qgs extension?

I checked that my filepath to my qgis project is correct, "chmod" it to a+rwx 
but I have no more idea.

The good news  is that my flipped raster which I talked in another thread this 
week is now correct.

Thanks,

Hello,

The Francophone local chapter of OSGeo organized in April the next developer 
meeting of the QGIS project in Lyon.
 
This is several days during which the developers have the opportunity to share 
and work together on various features of QGIS. This contributors meeting 
(developers, but also translators, users) will make significant progress on the 
project.

The OSGeo-fr, organizer of the event, looking for sponsors to fund the event. 
Three levels of sponsorship (gold, silver and bronze) were established for 
each organization to attend the event at his level. Each level allows the 
sponsor to be displayed in different ways at the meeting.

The three levels are:
* Gold - ? 3000, two gold sponsors maximum : totem, logo and presentation on 
the website, quoting on the press releases
* Silver - ? 1000, five silver sponsors maximum : presentation and the logo on 
the website
* Bronze - ? 500, Unlimited: logo on the website

If you use QGIS on a regular basis, sponsorship of this meeting is an 
opportunity to advance the project and get involved in the community.

Your organization wants to provide financial support for OSGeo-fr to set up the 
meeting?

Do you want more information? Contact us at conferences osgeo.asso.fr.

That method is unfortunately incompatible with Inkscape. I tried to make
the edits to the xml in the Inkscape xml editor and every time I closed
the window it would get reverted back to clean xml.

Also when I put in such edits to the xml via text editor they didn't
seem to work in QGIS 1.7.x
Maybe I'll give it another shot, but whatever the method turns out to be
it needs to be compatible with common svg editors.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Alex,

The problem is that the SVG specification to date does not contain any
method for replacing values with parameters. The way Marco implemented
it is inspired by the SVG parameters specification:
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGParam/
and
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGParamPrimer/

but since this is only a draft, none of the SVG editors implement this
functionality so far - which is a pity - since the functionality is much
needed. So unfortunately we can't find a solution that works fine in
current SVG editors. The way is to draw the symbol in an SVG editor like
Inkscape and then change the markup in a text editor.

Andreas

QGIS server from trunk works for me (at least with some test projects). 
Are you sure the map-Parameter of the request is correct?
If yes, could you paste the request url and maybe send a small set of

Thanks Marco I will send you in private some test file tonight. I really 
checked several time the map parameter :)

I have an another issue. It seems that the GetCapabilities is not correct:

* MapServer's GetCapabilities:
<WMS_Capabilities version="1.3.0" [..]>
<Service>
  <Name>WMS</Name>
  <Title>OpenOcean_WMS_T</Title>
  <Abstract>OpenOcean_WMS_T</Abstract>
  <OnlineResource xlink:href="localhost?"/>
  <ContactInformation></ContactInformation>

  <MaxHeight>4000</MaxHeight>
</Service>

* QGIS' Capabilities:
<WMS_Capabilities version="1.3.0" [..]>
<Name>WMS</Name>
<Title>Facilities</Title>
<Abstract/>
<ContactInformation></ContactInformation>
<Capability>
[..]

As you can see <Service> tag is not used in QGIS server (1.7.0). I will test 
it tonigh with my datraset on QGIS master.

thanks,

Y.

Hi all,
We've got dates and location !
The next community meeting will take place in Lyon, France during April.

Final dates are from 12th of april to the 16th (both included).

The meeting will take place at the university of Lyon 1.

We will provide you more informations on hotels, how to come, where to stay 
and all in the following days on qgis wiki :

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/7_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Lyon_2012

We currently have two bronze sponsors, which will cover for the location and 
are actively looking for more, to support your appetites :)

We hope to see you there all, hopefully with a weather a bit warmer than 
current -10?C.

Do not hesitate to contact us at conferences@osgeo.asso.fr or through this 
mailing list for any information.

Vincent, for OSGeo-fr

	Composer
Message-ID: <60157eba62838338e4c0e203a2fd71bc@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I just discovered that the SVG symbol choice in print composer - the 
 list with symbols that is shown after you place an image with the "Add 
 Image" button scrolls both vertically and horizontally. This is 
 suboptimal. I think it would be better if the symbol list scrolls only 
 vertically and the images are re-aligned when the width of the parent 
 widget changes. This has nothing to do with Nathans redesign, the 
 behavior was the same before.

 In the "Symbol properties" dialogue of the symbolization settings, the 
 behavior seems like I expect it. Symbols are realigned and there is only 
 a vertical scrollbar.

 How hard would it be to make the symbol choice in print composer behave 
 like the symbol properties of the symbolization?

The new composer works fine for me. Nice changes - I like the new layout. It's really good to see the composer getting some work on it.

Nathan, just out of interest do you know how much effort it would take to implement the following:

1)	Text over two lines for legend item text
2)	Tick boxes to allow you to turn off the following in the vector legend on a composer:
	a.	Title text
	b.	Group text
	c.	Layer text

Number 1 above is really holding us back from producing our maps straight from QGIS. Some of the text that we have to put in legends is too long to go on one line, and just goes off the edge of the page.

2c above, we do not always want to show text for a layer name (Layer Text) but would rather show the text next to the swatch sample on the legend (i.e. Item Text in the legend). At the moment to work around this we have to set the layer name to nothing and use one of the rule based renderers to get text into the item text. The downside with this is that if you want to do anything with the layers (i.e. use them in any of the tools within QGIS); you cannot see the layer name in any of the drop down menus as we have set this to nothing. Having the ability to turn off the Layer text in the legend would enable us to give layers names, but not have them show up on the legend.

cool thanks! yeah - of course one can improve the drawing tools - but
the question is how far one should go. There are more powerful tools for
drawing complex elements, like Inkscape.

Currently one can use the templates. This works fine for my purpose.

Thanks for the improvements. No issues so far - I will send a bug-report
if I come across problems.

 yes - both would be very nice enhancements to the legend. Esp. Option 
 2. I don't always want to display a text for a legend or layer. So it 
 would be very nice being able to hide the headings (title/group/layer).

Hey James,

Not sure how much would be involved with 1) I can look into for you and see
what I can do.  It would be a handy thing to have.

For 2) I normally just delete the text in the Legend Items tab for each
item I don't want to show including layer names or group names.  Does this
do what you need? or have I missed something.

 At least with the "Title" you also have to set the font to something 
 really small (1pt), otherwise you would still get an empty row at the 
 top of the legend. This is obvious if you also use a frame around the 
 legend. Event with setting the font-very small you would still get more 
 margin on top of the legend than on the bottom or the sides.

 For the groups or layernames - yes, you can delete them manually. But 
 it would be more handy if one could suppress all of them with a 
 checkbox. Whereas for groups and layers there is a manual workaround, 
 for the "Title" there is no satisfying workaround in my opinion.

Nathan that would be really good if you could take a look at whether multi line item labels are possible.

That does do it for 2 but it then reverts back to what it was originally if you update the layer in the legend doesn?t it or have I missed something? 

I want to be able to update all legend items in one go and not have to tweak the legend text each time. Clients can be very good at changing the styles a lot (even when a map is pretty much finished) and if I update then I have to change the text again in the legend. It's very easy to forget to make the legend as it was before you updated it to reflect the style change.

Andreas, I use the following workaround for the 'Legend' Title text issue.

1) Place a rectangle on your composer as the boundary of your legend area.
2) Place a legend within the rectangle
3) For the legend, delete the text 'Legend'
4) On General Options for the legend, set it to have no frame and make it completely opaque (slide the opacity slider right to the left).
5) Then realign your legend on the composer so that the top item in the legend is just below the frame of the rectangle.

This will then make it look like there isn't a gap at the top of the legend.

Jamas and Andreas,

I see what you mean.  It is a bit of a pain, not very ideal.

I'll see what I can do to improve this. Can't promise anything yes but I'll
have look anyway.

I suspect a redesign of the legend widget to allow more finer control of
each item is in order.  One thing I have thought of is control what gets
updated when you click update e.g. only update style; only update text;
update style and text.  Things like that.

- Nathan

 Hi James,

 I came across the same solution to the problem - but I think it is 
 cumbersome and it should be fixed in the legend item. Every time the 
 legend changes in size you would have to manually adjust the box ...

Thank you Nathan that would be great if any of those things could happen. Controlling what updates would be one way around it.

 

I did have another thought with regards to multi line legend items, it could possibly be useful to allow the use of a character which signifies the need to use a new line, like in the new labelling where you can 'Wrap label on character'.

 

Andreas - good point, we always have a standard legend panel so it doesn't affect us - the legend always stays the same dimensions.

Jamas and Andreas,

 

I see what you mean.  It is a bit of a pain, not very ideal.

 

I'll see what I can do to improve this. Can't promise anything yes but I'll have look anyway. 

 

I suspect a redesign of the legend widget to allow more finer control of each item is in order.  One thing I have thought of is control what gets updated when you click update e.g. only update style; only update text; update style and text.  Things like that.

That does do it for 2 but it then reverts back to what it was originally if you update the layer in the legend doesn't it or have I missed something?

I want to be able to update all legend items in one go and not have to tweak the legend text each time. Clients can be very good at changing the styles a lot (even when a map is pretty much finished) and if I update then I have to change the text again in the legend. It's very easy to forget to make the legend as it was before you updated it to reflect the style change.

Andreas, I use the following workaround for the 'Legend' Title text issue.

1) Place a rectangle on your composer as the boundary of your legend area.
2) Place a legend within the rectangle
3) For the legend, delete the text 'Legend'
4) On General Options for the legend, set it to have no frame and make it completely opaque (slide the opacity slider right to the left).
5) Then realign your legend on the composer so that the top item in the legend is just below the frame of the rectangle.

This will then make it look like there isn't a gap at the top of the legend.

 At least with the "Title" you also have to set the font to something
 really small (1pt), otherwise you would still get an empty row at the
 top of the legend. This is obvious if you also use a frame around the
 legend. Event with setting the font-very small you would still get more
 margin on top of the legend than on the bottom or the sides.

 For the groups or layernames - yes, you can delete them manually. But
 it would be more handy if one could suppress all of them with a
 checkbox. Whereas for groups and layers there is a manual workaround,
 for the "Title" there is no satisfying workaround in my opinion.

Hi Nathan,

Thanks for your reply.
I am a little bit confused as I do not really know how to set the mouse 
position. I have a solution, but it is not giving the same experience as 
when you create a new feature in a layer:

I use the canvasMoveEvent, I get the point in pixels in the canvas using
    result,snappingResults = 
QgsMapCanvasSnapper(self.canvas).snapToBackgroundLayers(pixPoint,[])

The best I could do is calculating the difference in pixels:
     self.transform = self.canvas.getCoordinateTransform()
     snappedPoint = QgsPoint(snappingResults[0].snappedVertex)
     startPoint = self.transform.toMapCoordinates(pixPoint.x(),pixPoint.y())
     dx  = 
(snappedPoint.x()-startPoint.x())/self.transform.mapUnitsPerPixel()
     dy  = 
(snappedPoint.y()-startPoint.y())/self.transform.mapUnitsPerPixel()

And then setting the cursor by applying this difference:
     qcur = QCursor.pos()
     QCursor().setPos(qcur.x()+dx,qcur.y()-dy)

I am quite sure there is a smarter way, but I cannot find it!
Also the problem is that the mouse is oscillating using this method. The 
only reason I can give is that canvasMoveEvent is sent again before the 
previously called method has returning, could it be true?

I am a little bit lost in this. I would really appreciate your help!

Thanks again,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Embedded Plugin Editor Plugin - Input Welcome
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8WKRqN=hYPN75o4U6Yj=vLjxJw+8Woq7WWF-D7KkOw+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So over the past week I've put together a new plugin for QGIS, for which I
would like input from anyone with an opinion about its functionality[1].
When I started writing plugins, I found the documentation OK, but a bit
dispersed, and the learning curve a touch steep and bit tricky. This has
gotten much better, with Alessandro Pasotti's new plugin repository app and
the work on moving documentation solely to the PyQGIS Cookbook. To further
help potential plugin developers, I decided to make a plugin to help
develop plugins, essentially what I wish I had available when I started
down the path of having fun with PyQt and QGIS.


'Plugin Editor' Embedded QGIS Plugin Development Plugin:

The main focus of the plugin is not to replace a true IDE. Real development
editors are great coding gurus, but can be a bit daunting to learn while
also trying to be a productive at writing your first QGIS plugin. Plugin
Editor is intended specifically to fill the needs of new plugin developers,
some (more than some?) of whom might have no understanding of even the
Python language.

The interface focus is on 'learning by example.' With features like
generating a new plugin from a template (only one now), to duplicating an
existing plugin to play with, having basic features enough to write the
entire plugin from scratch, to lending a helping hand with packaging and
distribution of the final work -- all from within QGIS -- the Editor
strives to be a central point of learning plugin development. All current
documentation and PyQGIS plugin development resources should be accessible
via the interface. Other features may help seasoned plugin creators with
common tasks, like incidental editing, browsing other's work, and plugin
distribution and updates.

However, I'm still a bit new to plugin development myself; so, I would
really like any input from other developers on what they would like to see
(or not) in this plugin before I do the first feature freeze. Feel free to
voice your opinion, but please be gentle to my oh-so-delicate ego. I have
many other features in the works, but am trying to keep the focus on
simplicity and clean functionality, inline with other QGIS development and
the understanding that the plugin is mostly for beginners.

I don't have a github repo set up yet as the plugin is still alpha; plus, I
would only embarrass myself if I released the code under its current state.
I have the basic embedded editor (newly released Eric4 4.5.0 'Mini' Editor
- GPL license) functioning and about a third of the other features done
(see annotated screen snap from Mac OS X [1]). Plugin works great in
Ubuntu, too -- actually, better. Not tested on Windows yet.


This plugin brings up another development consideration I would like to
hear some opinions on. I have incorporated the QScintilla2 [2] PyQt widget
into the QGIS app stack to accomplish this plugin. On Ubuntu, this was as
simple as apt-get of libqscintilla2 and python-qscintilla2. On the Mac,
it's another story. It requires adjustment of the CMake build steps and
bundling of the PyQt Qsci.so and libqscintilla2.8.dylib into the resultant
.app, like other PyQt resources. Not sure what to do on Windows, yet. My
opinion is that releasing QGIS with the pre-built addition of Qsci.so (~1
MB compressed, GPL license) for use by future plugin developers, to add
embedded text editors, would be very beneficial.

If I load a layer with incorrect projection I get an error with OL plugin.
Of course the problem is with the user, but the plugin should intercept the exception

Hi all.
Since several days, loading an OSM layer from the plugin locks the canvas, with QGIS
using 100% of the CPU. This happens with master on a couple of Debian machines,
apparently not on windows. Might this have something to do with current changes in
reprojection behaviour?
Thanks a lot.

I see (thanks Giovanni): http://hub.qgis.org/projects >
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/openlayers
But why this is not listed (the same is true for many others) in the very handy top
right menu "Jump to a project"?

Yes, the Battle of Hastings ticket :)
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1066
We should probably close my ticket as a duplicate: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4055
I don't think there is a significant difference between the two...

I guess there would need to be a default folder to add symbols to in the user's profile*, and the gui would need to merge categories that are duplicated in more than one of the SVG search paths.

* Wouldn't it be nice if there could be a standard location to install symbols that was _shared with other software_, rather than each program saving them in its own folders?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer right click menu
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-U645JGvtHXucN5m9852KJA92byJq6+ZOq00s+wYfcyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Playing around with some ideas I have for the print composer and I was
thinking it might be handy to add a right click context menu.for items.
 Nothing in the menus would be context menu only stuff mainly just
shortcuts to existing functions. Stuff like:

   - Align
   - Group
   - Ungroup
   - Lock

I have also had ideas for a menu item called "Save Item as Template..."
which will save the settings of the selected composer item out which you
can then do a "Load Item From Template.." which will load the settings back
again.  Could be handy if you have a legend that you use on different
composers, but can't really use a full template for as you already have
other stuff on the composer.

Thoughts?  Yay or Nay?

Regards,
Nathan

I have got a patch for Plugin-Builder plugins which adds a plugin_upload.py 
script (using repo API), and a Makefile entry so that you can just type :

make upload

and your plugin gets compiled (ui, i18n?), deployed (to local plugin 
directory), zipped, and uploaded to the repository.
I'll try to clean it up and send a pull request to plugin builder source repo 
asap.

Hi all.
The plugin Zonal Statistics accepts as input and output files also 
formats where it apparently cannot operate (e.g. GRASS rasters & 
vectors), but then the analysis does not proceed.
Does anybody confirm? If yes, I can open a ticket on it.
Thanks.

Hey Davide,

I'm currently not aware of a high DPI icon for QGIS.  However we are going
to be getting a revamp of our icon done soon and I'll include that it
should be made for high DPI.

- it is important (and does not look too difficult) to add a plot of the profile, which is what users want.

Should I open tickets?

Hei Vincent

Thanks for that hint. Now I managed to upload my repository.

My next question is: Is my repository somehow linked to the QGIS Contributed
Plugin repository or do I have to update new versions there as well (via
uploading a zip-file)?

I uploaded a new zip-file for the GarminCustomMap-plugin (Version 0.75) to
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/. But this version has not been approved
yet.
Can those who have the permission, approve the new version. It contains
important changes for the stabiliy of the plugin. 

Cheers
Stefan

You have to upload new versions to the plugin repository. There is a source 
code repository (for development), and a plugin repository (for plugin 
distribution).

Hi Paolo

Thanks for your reports, I am the author of this plugin. I'll be
looking into the mentioned issues in a short while.

I am using hub.qgis.org for this plugin, so feel free to open new
tickets there in the future. For these issues I will do it myself.

>> - it is important (and does not look too difficult) to add a plot of the
>> profile, which is what users want.

This is a new feature request. I guess I can try to add this feature,
although the really cool thing would be a shiny new plugin for
plotting all kinds of charts using vector and raster values - any
takers? I've been wanting to do something like this for ages (see my
infant chartMaker plugin for a start) but haven't been able to focus
on it.

Best regards

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Again a call for testing and translation.. aim for
	1.7.4
Message-ID: <1328633407.5780.14.camel@lost>

Hi devs and translators!

This is just a short reminder (as I assume it is most important to
developers and translators) that my time plan for the next release in
the 1.7.x branch is as follows:

Aim is targeting at about 2-3 week - so having the translation
finished in about 2 weeks (18th Feb) would be fine for the release ..
so...

18th February 2012: Branching date for release-1_7_4 branch

I'll do the call for packaging on 18th February and hope to have
finished packages ready within 25th February .. 
That would be also the release date of 1.7.4.

That should be the date of the release announcement..

25th February 2012: Release date for QGIS 1.7.4

There are still some bugs left - Alex and me are working and trying to
fix as much as possible - for some bugfixes we would definitely need
help from a developer - and for other bugs that are reported in redmine
there is still no bugfix present in master branch - so there is nothing
to backport.. :)

Please help us to make this release another great step forward in
stability and usability (well - I know there are already big
improvements in master branch but this release is still 1.7.x)

Thanks a lot to all of you working hard on reporting and fixing.
And a personal big thanks to Alexander Bruy who is doing a lot of work
in the release-1_7 branch.

I hope to get a lot of translation improvements and bugfixes ..

kind regards
Werner

Thanks to Marco I successfully tested my qgis-server.

The issue below (getCapabilities) is not anymore in master. I didn't test it 
on QGIS 1.7 branch as it failed to build at this moment (libqwt issue).

Thanks,

Hi,

Sorry to come again with this stuff, but I am really puzzled.

I am wondering why I have a constant 9 pixels shift between
QCursor.pos().x()
and
mouseEvent.pos().x() + self.canvas.pos().x() + 
self.iface.mainWindow().pos().x()

Can someone explain this to me?

Also I am still looking for a smart way to perform a snap with the 
QgsMapTool...
Do you think it could be easily added as an option?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Message-ID: <CANaz7mwnLk6J2hLsByCnGXJzRFuYEJdFF4aV3fOkKDjmNu+bJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear qgis users and devs,

this is just to inform you about the addition of an SQL console to the
pgAdmin plugin called "PostGIS viewer" [1]. It allows you to filter your
PostGIS data as well as run spatial functions visualizing the results.

The SQL console was taken from the QGIS plugin "Fast SQL Layer" by Pablo T.
Carreira.

I hope you enjoy it.

Regards,

Germ?n

This crash is refering to the 'Profile tool' plugin, not 'Profile from line'.

I guess the name of my plugin is kind of unfortunate... it could
probably be changed to something like 'sample along line'...

Message-ID: <CACw3ADgWmSLjkdBqXLhbrgk-LFc51EYp_bnhJe_zLoS8-nEOpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm on git master up-to-date (last commit
aaddc4f914dc750afeb4395c6f1254f584161f4f).


Versione di QGIS               1.9.90-Alpha
QGIS code revision            3f50017
Compiled against Qt          4.7.4
Running against Qt            4.7.4
GDAL/OGR Version           1.9.0
GEOS Version                   3.4.dev
PostgreSQL Client Version  9.1.2
SpatiaLite Version              2.4.0
QWT Version                     5.2.2


Starting from a couple of days QGIS flicker evidently when moving the
cursor in and out map canvas.

There is no log from QGIS, no log from Xorg, nor entries in syslog.
Toggling the checkbox "Update" does not have any effect, so flickering
is not due to updating the view.

My video card is a Radeon HD 3450, with radeon driver.
I'm on kubuntu oneiric.

Toggling desktop effects in my desktop manager (kdm) also does not
have any effects.
Toggling compositing type from OpenGL and Xrender also does not have
any effects.

I cannot remember if this problem was present also in kde 4.7 (I've
updated to kde 4.8 a few days ago).

Can anyone confirm this?

Message-ID: <CALcLSfrt3iC2mAXe4c7JjvkxBXEfRzFxb7k5m9QKj07wj9FB=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGis developers


We have just installed QGis on 4 Windows machines in our office to explore
its potential for sustainable capacity building in an international
government aid context.
We installed from the QGIS website the option OSGeo4W Installer because we
are also doing development.
However, when attempting to run QGIS we all get the same error:

*This application has failed to start because ippqj-5.3.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.*

However, we cannot re-install  without first un-installing and have not
been able to find a method for un-installing the faulty QGIS installation.

As an aside, we noticed that both QGIS 1.7.3 and QGIS 1.9.90 appear as
icons.


Can someone please help us

   - Uninstall QGIS
   - Let us know how to install a working version

This is important for the QGIS project because the lack of good
installation/uninstallation procedures fuel the perception that Open Source
projects aren't serious contenders to the traditional commercial products.

Many thanks for you help
Ole Nielsen

Hi,

Use the standalone installer, is less risky to have something get wrong.
About the osgeo4w installer you must not install every package it makes
available, because you can get errors like the one you are seeing (probably
lack of some external library). Stop the services you may have installed (
Apache) and remove the osgeo4w folder, then I usually clean the registry
with ccleaner. Then re-install just what you need, qgis and/or qgis-device.

The ippqj-5.3.dll error is a known bug which can be solved by
reinstalling the one package in osgeo4w that relates to it.

No un-installation is required when working with OSGeo4w normally.
However if you wish to uninstall simply delete the C:\OSGeo4w folder.
OSGeo4w has very few registry entries (1-4 I think)

If you got QGIS 1.7.3 and QGIS 1.9.90 you probably did a full install of
everything in OSGeo4w. Which means you got the stable and the
development versions of QGIS and a whole lot of other stuff. It also
means you got a lot of other stuff that sometimes doesn't behave right
all together (an unsolved puzzle).

The suggested method would be to use the Quick/Simple setup option to
start, and then re-run the setup.exe as you discover you need additional
libraries for programming purposes.

I'll make sure to post a guide I wrote up for my students doing QGIS
python development later this week which will give a good sense of what
else you might want.

Thanks,
Alex

Is that because you installed the libjpeg-ipp package?   That doesn't ship
with all dependencies - see [1]

If you just select qgis(-full) or qgis-dev in the installer you should get all
needed dependencies.

Are you sure?  I thought that is caused by a missing external depencency (that
OSGeo4W isn't allowed to ship; [1]).

Hi guys,
Two things:


> No un-installation is required when working with OSGeo4w normally.
> However if you wish to uninstall simply delete the C:\OSGeo4w folder.
> OSGeo4w has very few registry entries (1-4 I think)

1. But if you only want to uninstall certain things, just run through the OSGeo4W "setup" program again, and unselect them.  "Setup" is used for everything, like a Linux package manager - adding/removing/upgrading/downgrading packages.


> Use the standalone installer, is less risky to have something get wrong.

2. Is it really so necessary to dissuade people from using the OSGeo4W "Setup"?
- It is much quicker and easier.  E.g. when a new version of QGIS is released you only need to click through setup again to update.  You don't need to go to the QGIS website, download a new installer (which will waste time and bandwidth because it is bigger - especially since it includes GRASS, which many people would never use), run the installer, and separately run the uninstaller for the old version.  
- The OSGeo4W setup also provides easy access to other software you might want to use with QGIS (and nightlies in case you need them :) )
- I'm not convinced the OSGeo4W installer is very risky.  Are people having problems with it without doing an "advanced install" and choosing weird things?  IMO the only good reason for recommending the standalone installer is that OSGeo4W doesn't provide ECW libs (but the standalone installer isn't actually respecting the license on these, anyway...)

> This is important for the QGIS project because the lack of good

I believe the OSGeo4W installer is a much better system than a standard Windows installer.  But maybe its labelling and public profile could be improved.  Some possibilities:
- always install "setup" - make it a dependency of every other package.
- change the label of "setup" in the start menu to something which makes it really obvious that this is how you add/remove/upgrade/rollback packages.  (Note that this is explained on the first page of the setup program.  If people choose not to install the standalone package recommended for beginners, and don't bother to read the instructions in the OSGeo4w installer, well...).
- Relabel the three options in the first screen of the installer to explain more fully what each does.
- Rewrite the explanation above these options - try and make it more concise so people read it and take it in.
- Mention on the download page that you just run "setup" again to add/remove/upgrade/rollback something.  Maybe repeating this information here will help ;)
- Explain that if you want to remove _everything_ you can just delete the main OSGeo4W folder.

I guess it would be _possible_ to make the osgeo4w installer automatically install "setup", and put something in the Windows "add remove programs" to launch it, but it would require more work...

Does anybody think those changes would be worthwhile?

+1 I always recommend OSGeo4W installer. It has many advantages over the
stand-alone installer.
Unfortunately, for many users, if something doesn't look like a "normal
setup.exe", they simply give up because it looks different.

Is there a way to make the installer look like any other setup tool on
Windows?

+1 for a new name instead of "setup". Maybe "OSGeo4W Manager/Center/...."

+1 That's easy to do, but we all know that people just don't read the
instructions ....

The usual argument is that people are used to (<bias>huge and bloated</bias>)
standalone installers.  And those are easier for places with slow connectivity
(or off-net).  I'm not sure about that either - especially when updates are
considered.

I don't recommend the standalone installer either - I just make it ;)
But that's done from the osgeo4w packages anyway.

Me neither - and yes, I think that installing stuff, that the (documented) need
of third party dependencies was the trouble maker again.

Sounds good and easy.

That's probably not that difficult - just needs some googling - and some time
;)

A problem with the osgeo-setup is that the newbye user could run an
"install all"  and so install on its machine the web softwares.
When this was happened , the machine begin to run slow. And the remove of
the web software was a bit of panic, expecially from the services.

Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_OBNCRJCzi5f9W+dKzZGvQ7DiBjsiLvFUVHhW+bWKyNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have incorporated the GPL-licensed QScintilla2 [1] PyQt text editor
widget into my QGIS app stack to accomplish a plugin I am almost ready
to release[2]. Adding support for QScintilla2 on Ubuntu was as simple
as apt-get of libqscintilla2 and python-qscintilla2. On the Mac, It
requires adjustment of the CMake build steps and bundling of the PyQt
Qsci.so and libqscintilla2.8.dylib into the resultant .app (which I
have done, as I built and tested the plugin on a Mac). Not sure what
to do on Windows, as I don't develop on that platform.

What would it entail to get the QScintilla2 PyQt module added to QGIS
distributions? I can submit my build notes for Mac OS X adjustments as
a pull request for review. What about the other distributions?

My opinion is that releasing QGIS with the pre-built addition of this
PyQt editor widget (~1 MB compressed) for use by developers, to add
embedded text editors, would be very beneficial.

Actually the standalone is widely used by people with low bandwidth
because the typical pattern is for one person to sacrifice the time /
money to download it and then share it widely saving others the
expense and time of doing the same.

Secondly, we did have an agreement with ERMapper to redistribute the
ECW libs (I believe the agreement should be in the installer bundle),
although I am unclear as to whether the acquisition of ERMapper by
Erdas has impacted on that agreement. We had a similar agreement in
place for shipping MrSid binaries. Although these are both proprietary
formats, not having them is a show stopper for many people working
with remote sensing data.

Hi Alexander, hi all,

today (last revision 2cea3494ebdd0777211b7abac53c86a8f40bca71) the

Still in the context of trying to understand what Martin proposes
without necessarily endorsing the idea...

Martin how would you see python integration working in the context of
keeping our existing C++ code base for src/app and extending it with
python? I assume you are thinking to provide a way to add e.g. a new
dialog, etc to the app without having to write a plugin? So how did
you see that working? Would the python layer load after the main app
is loaded and python elements of the app just attach themselves to the
mainwindow as a plugin would?

Regards

Tim

Computing stats should be a once off event since I adapted the gdal
provider to use gdal native stats. Is your experience on first load or
on subsequent loads too?

I am not sure it is so easy to avoid collecting stats. We used to have
some logic that set stats to be only collected when they were needed,
I'll need to check if that is still the case or not (but I suspect
not).

That makes sense to me.

I would suggest that we wait until after Marco's resampling branch is
merged before looking at these things as many parts of raster
implementation are changing with it.

Tim,

IMO we would should really thread these operations, and report the progress
to the user in a friendly cancel-able way.  If the user doesn't care about
stats, which to me when loading something that is just for viewing is most
of the time, QGIS should just say "stats not loaded" and show the file
anyway. If you want to get the stats again we should have a recalculate
stats button, with threading and progress bar.

I had a person email me today (a council trying to me to QGIS) about trying
to load a 2gb ecw and it just locks up the UI with no idea of how much is
left to be done or what is going on. I have experienced the same thing but
managed to get around it by making a fake stats file, QGIS then just opens
thinking the stats are fine.

There is a difference between evaluation (eval) and execution (exec)
of some code. When evaluating you only want a result of an expression.
When executing you actually run one or more statements in the current
context.

>>> eval("1+2")
3
>>> exec "x=1"
>>> x
1

Also note that exec is a statement (no parentheses) while eval is a
builtin function.

Hey Denis,

By the looks of it you have the quotes in the wrong spot.  Try this:

eval(" myvar ='3' ")

or

eval(" myvar =\'3\' ")

Hi Martin, Hi Nathan,

Thank you both for your replies.

The solution was effectively using exec. The difference is not very 
straightforward but I think I got it!

Btw, I am using this to save list in a layer custom property, and the 
way I found is playing with repr and eval exec.

Thanks again! You save me a lot of time, I was not looking in the right 
direction!

Denis

You can/could only select the primary key for views.  The primary keys of
tables are detected.

Hi,

switching to the developer list:

I tried the same with current QGIS trunk, too.

at the moment I can say, that QGIS (1.7.3 and trunk) can visualize my data
in projection (EPSG 4326 and EPSG 25832) but not in EPSG 31466, EPSG 31467,
EPSG 31468 or EPSG 3035 from mapserver 6.0.1. With Openlayers and ArcGIS
there is no problem.

When I use QGIS Server or mapserver < 6, I can also visualize data in EPSG
31466 and EPSG 31467 in QGIS. 

Could this have something to do with a different projection handling in
mapserver 6 and QGIS? Hope someone has an idea, where to look at next.

Regards
Otto

Hi Otto,

Can you check this issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4946 if it is not
Your problem.

If not, these are my usual steps:

1. Is QGIS indicating in status bar that it is loading some image ? If
not, it can be some problem with extent detection done when loading list
of layers (GetCapabilities request). QGIS is loading images only for
detected extent.

2. If it looks like that QGIS is loading something, but You see only
blank images, you can check WMS server access logs to manually verify
WMS requests send by QGIS (you can paste them here if You are not sure.)

3. Also the usual problem is that WMS server is providing incorrect
GetMap URL or GetFeatureInfo URL. You can set to ignore it in 'Create a
new WMS connection dialog.'

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2009-August/007384.html

I would like to add sub-menus to the plugin menu, is this easily feasible?

Thanks

Denis

I noticed a difference:
action tooltip is: Add PostGIS Layer
dialog title is: Add PostGIS Table(s)

This is not a major problem, but still...

 I think "Add PostGIS Layer" is better - since it can also be a view - 
 not restricted to physical tables.

QGIS is loading something.

yes, it loads something and QGIS zooms to the correct extend (I can see
that when I load the same map as shapefile) when I zoom to layer.

logfile output for blank image in epsg 32467 is (not working in QGIS):

I don't see any error here.

Did that but nothing changed.

In QGSWFSPlugin there is:

shouldn't it be

Also, in QGSWFSPlugin

Data provider is invalid (layers %1, styles %2, formats: %3)

shouldn't it be

Hello,

if we are on typos, there is one in the *german* GUI, in the Menu for 
the Plugins ("Erweiterungen"), under the item "Download plugins":

In the dialogue to download and install the plugins several times it 
reads "repositorys" (also in the tooltips), correct is "repositories", 
as far as I know, even if it is in the german version...

Maybe an alternative to "repository" would be "Quelle", similar/analogue 
as in Debian-based Linux distributions...

Thank you,
regards, Albin

That's not an typo - I think you don't use the English way to make plural forms
even if you use English terms.

But I didn't like "Repositorys" either - so in master it's a bit better with
"Repositorium" and "Repositorien" (for about 5 months)

Hi

The kmz-files the GarminCustomMap-plugin produces look good in Google Earth,
but unfortunately, it seems like the GPSmap 62s series (it is the only one I
have available) does not read rgba-Jpegs.

Now I updated the GarminCustomMap version to 0.8 where only rgb-Jpegs are
produced. And the CustomMaps are now displayed propperly...

Could one of those who approve the plugins please approve the new version?

Cheers
Stefan

Oh I'm often getting a similar kind of report : the user opens the 
properties, clicks on the wrong tab -> too bad the file is a huge pct 
raster, kill your project.

The upgrade of:

Would it be possible to open a bugtracker for it?

But there is no option to "install all".  Am I missing something?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Resizing the properties dialog in small screens
Message-ID: <CACbtZwQK=0GP2S21akOUZ6s-Sdu3jk7X198XW_utfKhN8c=6iw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using QGIS in my netbook which has a screen resolution of 1024x600. It
runs Windows 7. The height of the properties dialog seems too big for the
screen. I have to hide mt taskbar to make them visible. even then only half
of the bottom row of the buttons become visible. I tried resizing it from a
corner, on the top. It seems there is a minimum value set and it doesn't
get small for me.

So, is there a way to get the thing visible on the screen . Can the size of
the dialog be decided dynamically depending on the screen size?

Hi Arun, welcome to to small screen world :) the idea is that it should
work, but it is still a work in progress, andriod and tablets need that a
lot. Jef just pushed Yesterday to master two improvements that improved the
layer properties dialogs. Still Problematic are now the raster calculatior
and the attribute table. I hopefully look into it soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Scale bar problems with 2 maps on 1 composer
Message-ID: <B398947DCAB85D46809151E678999F21047EAE04@srv01.NPA.LOCAL>

I am getting a problem where if I have two maps on a composer. When I
reopen a project the scale bar is reverting to the wrong one (map 1
which is my inset map rather than map 0 which is my main map). 

To reproduce, place two maps on a composer (set the 2nd one to a
different scale to the first one - in my project the maps are at 1:40000
and 1:10000). 
Tell the scale bar to be linked to map 0.
Save project, close QGIS then reopen and load project again.
Open composer
Scale bar now is linked to map 1 not map 0 and the size of the bar will
have changed. 

It seems to remember all the other settings (e.g. segment size stays the
same which leads the scale bar to be very wide).

Can anyone else confirm?

Using OSGEO4W qgis-dev.

An update on flickering I'm experiencing, since the problem is a bit
more complicated than I've described in previous mail.

The flickering happens when:

* qgis window grab/lost the focus
* mouse enter/exit map canvas but ONLY if qgis window does not have
the focus (and this is the reason that in my previous mail I've
wrongly said that it was no more present, I was indeed trying with
qgis window having the focus)
* dragging content as of ticket 4011 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4011)

Are more info needed?
Is there anything I can try to see if it is really a bug or just
something in my setup?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] popups informing that transformation failed should
 happen once, not for each point
Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMeW9RiS8uKPndLUca_66Zi+wGSYoesYopuuGymPtFFNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

sometimes with on-the fly reprojection enabled, I get a very large
number of popups with the message "forward transformation of ...
failed with error : latitude or longitude exceeded limits".

I have to press ESC for about a minute or so, until all popups have
been shown, and then pan the map or disable on-the-fly reprojection.


There are 2 issues here:

1) there should only be one pop-up happening, not once for each point
that fails to transform (perhaps keep a counter and show that in a
single pop-up)
2) why does the transformation fail, which is a little trickier. This
happens when mixing lon/lat data with UTM-projected layers and
reprojecting to WGS84.

I am using a slightly old master (0a17ad5), don't know if more recent
versions behave differently.

regards,
Etienne

Hi Paolo

At the moment, there is no gui for it. It is however possible to use it 
via python bindings.
A plugin for it is in work. I'll keep you updated.

Hi all,

I noticed that when a custom property is set on a layer, if nothing else 
changed in the project, you can quit QGIS without being asked to save 
the project.

This is very unlikely to happen, but still...with some plugins, it can...

hi,

The bugtracker is created:

The metadata file has been modified a little (in version 0.2.1), maybe that
will fix the problem ?

This is from a bug in the metadata.txt file generated by the PluginBuilder. I believe the following line in metadata.txt is the problem:

 # Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:

The parser is ignoring the # because of a leading space. Remove the leading space and it should correct the problem. 

I am working on an update to the PluginBuilder which will correct this  issue.

Another known problem - from IRC ;)

You're probably also trying to transform invalid coordinates without catching
the associated exception.

Sorry - I should have checked.

A more general question :  what is the status of Master WRT plugin
support?  I have been holding off updating my QGis installation from
master because but I don't want things to break, especially plugins
because of API changes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac app bundling - all-in-one
Message-ID: <859742CA-C294-4098-B5C8-277F6CA22EFC@gmail.com>

Hi William,

I was looking at comments on QGIS at macupdate:
http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25428/quantum-gis

Unfortunately, there are some negative reviews that seem to be tied to inexperienced users not following install directions. Considering that the installation of frameworks is likely unfamiliar for most casual users of OSX, I wondered if it would be possible to provide the all-in-one bundled application like you used to do? Having a unified application with frameworks bundled, although quite massive, would alleviate the most likely cause for failure on new installs being reported in the comments.

Cheers,
John

Can we add also a (dummy) icon for the tool?

Hi,

FYI, I agree that the osgeo4w is better for many reasons, and at our
training courses I always show both ways to install QGIS on Windows.
What I see is that the common users are sometimes not willingly to leave
the "next -> next -> next -> finish" paradigm on Windows. This is why
trying osgeo4w in many cases they fall in the "trap" of selecting every
package available, a case that as we know can generate a few error
messages.

As far as I knew were were still shipping the 'old' ecw libs I still
use them myself under linux so that I can write the odd ecw out too.
Paolo was the contact point with ERMapper so I will defer this
discussion to him, but yes it seems we may need to update what we are
shipping / double check our compliance (PITA I know....).

subsequent loads are fast, with the exception of GRASS rasters, probably
because stats are not written anywhere.

computing rasterlite stats is very slow if compared with all other
formats.

I agree with others that when computing stats should at least show a
progress bar, but (also) having them computed optionally would be even
better.

When stretching is active standard deviation is enabled is set to 2 by
default. In my experience this is causing to render rasters with
"strange" colormaps, while a smaller value (1.7) seems to give better
results.

The integration of python with c++ within application code would be
very simple: there would be a qgis.app python module containing
various parts of application functionality. Stuff implemented in
python would have access to qgis.utils.iface (instance of
QgisInterface) like python plugins and console do. Such code would be
triggered directly from c++ code, e.g. slot responsible for showing a
dialog would do just something like
QgisApp::featureXYZ() { runPythonCode("qgis.app.featureXYZ"); }

The only difference from python plugins would be that such
functionality would be always enabled and impossible to remove by user
(just like with other code from src/app).

I don't know what others think, but I for one would love to see your
plugin ship with QGIS by default (ie. have it incorporated into core).
Doing so would of course simultaneously resolve your request above.

By the way we have been mulling over updating the plugin template to
do the following:

- pep8 compliance
- pylint friendly
- ship with a unit test framework
- ship with a ready to roll sphinx project

Regards

Tim

Thanks for the kind words. It's been an enjoyable learning experience
for me. I should have a limited experimental version out sometime next
week.

I'm working on the .ui, .ts, and .qrc compiling tools now, and have
some more documentation to write. Things that will be missing in the
initial release will be: plugin duplication, new plugins from
templates, packaging and uploading to repository, and the tutorial.
Everything else is working fairly well.

Right now I need others to beta-test the core functionality before
spending anymore time on extra features. I've had it running on my new
iMac at work and under Ubuntu Oneiric with 30+ tabs open, without
crashing, albeit the editor gets too glitchy to use.

The interface is intended specifically for reducing the learning curve
to writing plugins. Then, after a small project or two, users might
migrate to a real external IDE and debugging, etc., coming back to the
editor for the packaging tools and user-space
tweaking/testing/browsing.

The editor can always get better, since Detlev's Eric IDE has a
seemingly endless selection of well-coded, modular features written in
PyQt. (QScintilla support is key, though.)

Some of those sound like good verifications to add to the packaging
tool in the editor as well. The packaging and uploading tools are
intended to ease the repository maintainers' and plugin developers'
burden by helping to ensure proper metadata and file structure/content
prior to submission.

I'm hoping that some other plugin developers will help add new 'use
case' templates, either to the repository or to be included with the
editor. This way, a new user can choose a semi-close template to what
they are thinking of undertaking (e.g. raster manipulation, working
with legend layers, composer usage, etc.)... basically, starter
plugins inline with the conceptual sections of the cookbook.

+1 from me.  Sounds like a great idea.  Plugin writing is something that
new users tend to stuggle with and it would be good to have a nice setup to
get them started.

I didn't check back on this after I saw it added to MacUpdate, and strangely I don't recall seeing updates listed (I check daily).

For all the complaints about the requirements missing from the readme - bogus, they are there.  And starting with 1.7.1, an installer is used that will not install without the frameworks.

But, for the all-in-one, a bug affecting this was only recently fixed, and I've been too busy to work out the packaging details.  I got a start, but it's a complex thing to do.

And you lose GRASS support in the all-in-one.  Once you need GRASS support (when the GRASS provider bug is finally fixed), you're back to installing the frameworks.

Considering that the installation of frameworks is likely unfamiliar for most casual users of OSX, I wondered if it would be possible to provide the all-in-one bundled application like you used to do? Having a unified application with frameworks bundled, although quite massive, would alleviate the most likely cause for failure on new installs being reported in the comments.

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

So many things have changed from the ERDAS side that I think we should seek their
advice before proceeding further.
All the best.

+1 from me too,

please don't forget to add recommended metadata (homepage, tracker,
repository) to the plugin's metadata.

Also, plugin upload to the new repo will be a great feature!

That too - the sphinx project would be for api documentation etc. and

Trying to install on HTC Desire HD..
Installation running fine - but starting causes a segfault ..
recent versions were running fine ..

Is there a howto for cleanly uninstallation anywhere?
Probably I should clean my mobile and try it again ..

in my case, on a clean HD, installation fails, as described a couple of months ago.

More info: the installer apparently does not check for the presence of Qt (maestro).
However, after installing Maestro, I still get the same error: perhaps some more deps
are missing?
Thanks.

Hi all.

Np, there are other apps that have better user feedback. "redmine 
client" connects but that's all for me.
here others:
- [1] redmine (the one you tried, looks best but needs REST api [2]: 
"Most of the time, the API requires authentication. To enable the 
API-style authentication, you have to check Enable REST API in 
Administration -> Settings -> Authentication." is this possible Pirmin_k?)
- [2] redminerdroid

I know I shouldn't, but I'm testing it on  a small screen, so a lot of them in fact.

Do you have a FAQ for the project? I guess I'll not be the only one asking :).

Do you mean the plugin template in plugin builder ?
I've got some improvement to it as well :
* i18n-ready with Makefile rules
* help directory (should include a sphinx project indeed)
* a few other Makefile rules (package, upload to repo)

I'll push that to my plugin-builder github fork asap.

Hi Schaffer,

One thing that bothers me a bit is that you directly edit your local plugin in 
plugin's directory and not in code repository.
The packaged and deployed plugin content is often different from the 
plugin 
code repository. For example, .git files, translation files, ui files do not 
have 
to be distributed, while they are in the source directory.

I give a lot of training sessions on QGIS and especially on plugin 
development.The workflow I am using is the following :

* Generate the plugin start code with plugin builder in a dev directory
* init git on this directory
* edit code
* compile (ui to py, i18n)
* deploy to local plugin dir (make deploy)
* commit
* package and upload (make upload)

While your plugin is great for editing, it lacks a simple way to do the 
following steps :
* git management (init, commit)
* compile and deploy (make commands)

Maybe integrating a little terminal dock panel could be enough to let the 
user 
achieve these steps.

Making the learning curve easier for users to write plugins is great, but 
we 
should be careful to keep constraints on them, or at least good habits in 
plugin development, or we will end up with a lot of bad-quality plugins, 
which 
is clearly a problem. There is of course a balance to find between 
constraints and ease of development, but it should be well thought in 
order 
not to create more problems than it solves.

Hello Vincent,

Thank you for your reply and valuable input. I will try to address each of
your comments, as you bring up important points.

Agreed. The last thing I want to do is make it fast and efficient for new
plugin developers to make bad-quality plugins. That would be a burden upon
both developers and users.

Finding the right balance between a comfortable learning curve while
maintaining some control over making sure new developers write quality code
under best practice techniques is part of why I started this plugin project.

When I release my plugin's source (on github), I would welcome anyone to
fork the project and help add anything they think will help new plugin
developers. I would especially appreciate any input on the plugin's
embedded tutorial, as it will be the focus point where current QGIS
developers can pass on best practice techniques.

I want my plugin to just solve problems, not create any. Towards this end,
I will not be releasing the plugin to the public QGIS repository, even
under 'experimental,' until other developers have had a chance to download
it from github and send me any corrections they think will help.

Locally deploying to QGIS from a development directory is something I find
an unnecessary step, especially once you have the ability to edit directly
in QGIS. During plugin development, I found I only need a method of
compiling PyQt/Qt resources and the 'plugin reloader' script.

However, deploying the plugin for use by users is another matter. The
package and upload tools I intend to make (still developing their logic and
workflow now) could include a deployment step and toolbar icon. This could
generate a duplicate plugin, but one that has been fully deployed. This
would allow the developer to see how their plugin would look and work after
deployment. That temp plugin could then be deleted, as the packager tool
would auto-deploy as part of the packaging process.

Compiling will be built in (working on it now), including individual
compiling of files, to one-click whole project compiling (recursive
directory search for compileable resources).

Adding a new 'temp deployment' step I noted above.

SCM, like git, is certainly a best practice in any software development.
However, I feel this should be optional, but have available builtin support
in the editor for setting up local repo and firing off commits.

I developed this plugin, up until yesterday, only relying upon my hourly
Time Machine backups (rsync on a Mac). I didn't feel the need for a repo
until I thought other developers might want to get involved, or once I had
enough stable code base, and didn't want to break it trying out new ideas
(i.e. start doing forks and merges). It's my opinion that most new
dvelopers won't even need it for most small projects.

I still want to see git as part of the Editor plugin. It certianly should
be part of the tutorial and an available option for users to choose, from
the start of a project.

Here are the development steps I see right now, when a new developer starts
using the Editor plugin:

* Open Editor and read help docs, explaining how to use the editor, what
steps they should anticipate during development, and where QGIS plugin
development resources are located.

* Read part 1 of the tutorial, installing the tutorial's demo plugin to
follow along; editing the demo, reloading and running it, all from within
QGIS. An introduction to the QGIS Python Console would also be included.
Best practices are introduced and discussed.

There are further parts to the tutorial, including all steps leading up to
releasing. On first relese of the plugin, anyone is welcome to fork the
Editor's embedded tutorial document and add to it.

Thank you for your comments and making me think more about the design of my
plugin.

Thanks William,

It sounds like you have some good checks in place with the installer. With that worked out, I agree that there is not a lot of value in creating another build for you to manage and host.

John

-1: I think an SCM is a necessity, to speed up collaboration. E.g., in 
case of API breakage, a dev can go round all the plugins and fix them 
quickly, whereas waiting for all authors to understand and apply the fix 
can be very long.
All the best.

I share Larry's opinion - for a small one man show project SCM is not
necessary. Of course at some stage it is useful to introduce it.

Regarding API breakage and fixing plugins by someone else - I do not
support that. Even though plugin code may be hosted at hub.qgis, only
the plugin author is the real owner of the code - it is not in public
domain. Therefore doing some changes without author's permission (and
releasing new version on his/her behalf) does not sound good to me.
Also from the practical point of view - core developers doing some API
breakage will surely not going to update dozens of contributed plugins
in order to make them work again.

Martin, I couldn't agree more with you.

We've already seen all the troubles and confusion that were introduced
by trying to push plugin authors to have a GIT instance on redmine, I
would keep this as a soft suggestion (even softer than it is now),
nothing more.

If an author doesn't want to maintain a public code repository it's
his right to do it, and this is not a good reason for not hosting his
plugins on plugins.qgis.org, IMHO we should implement other methods to
evaluate the quality of a plugin, a voting system is already in the
pipeline and could be implemented during the next code sprint in Lyon.

You'll find the new Makefile rules (with zip upload) in 
https://github.com/vpicavet/Qgis-Plugin-
Builder/commit/20b46c00740c06d6f2840f534b5d8eb92f0112ec

Other improvements, including a first try at a default sphinx project are 
pushed in my plugin builder fork :
https://github.com/vpicavet/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/

I've sent a pull request to gary, but some parts need testing and 
polishing (the sphinx part for example).

I'm still working on it (pep8/pylint) and i'll commit to this fork as soon as 
possible, do not hesitate to test, and to merge to master.

Hi,

@Alessandro: Would you consider writing, or scaffolding, a Python
class that assumes a correctly written and prepared plugin (i.e.
properly packaged plugin) and the necessary extra textual information
that is needed for the repository listing, and interfaces an upload to
the repository app using its API? This is the first plugin I will be
releasing, and I have not gone through the process of uploading to the
new repo app yet. I could take your class and add a GUI onto it for
the upload to plugins.qgis.org part of the Editor's upload tool.

After completing the Plugin Editor's tool set, I would like to wrap
its packaging and uploading tools into two Eric4 plugins, so plugin
developer's who move to (or start with) that IDE can have those tools
available to them as well.


@Paolo: What about the Editor plugin offering to auto-setup a Redmine
git repo upon upload to the plugins.qgis.org repo app, if the plugin
author hasn't set one up until then? Part of the package and upload
tools' logic should be to verify and offer as much best practice
functionality as possible, as this directly affects how the plugin is
released to (seen by) the public.


@all (sorry, this is a bit long-winded): After reading this discussion
on requisites and best practice techniques, I'm noticing a need to
define the anticipated base user for the Editor plugin.

To do this I tried (incompletely, no doubt) to put together what is
needed by a potential new plugin dev to create an 'ideal' QGIS plugin.
I have also tried to put these requisites in some sense of functional
order, i.e. what should be known first to produce an actual working
plugin, not necessarily in any best practices order:

* Read other plugin devs Python code and discern the logic. I think
this is the root level of starting to learn any new coding technique,
and the Editor is built around this principle.

* Understand Python, and how to write procedural functions with it.
OOP and PEPs are something many coders new to Python don't do right
away.

* Understand how the QGIS Python API works, i.e. what a Python binding
is. This includes learning to read C++ class docs, an undertaking not
usually associated with learning a single scripting language API.

* How to use the Python Console to test code snippets.

* Know how the parts of a plugin work (__init__.py, factory class, etc.).

* How to test/debug the plugin. Plugin Editor has no debugging (though
it could); but since it has the simple reload functionality (based on
Richard Duivenvoorde's work), getting to QGIS's Python error traces is
pretty quick. For example, I have not really needed to use a command
line debugger when writing the Editor plugin (yet), just Richard's
reloader plugin.

* Understand how to build a GUI with PyQt. I think this is a big
hurdle for many new devs (it was for me, since I didn't learn PyQt/Qt
until needing to make a QGIS plugin). Learning PyQt, Qt,
signals/slots, and Designer alone takes some time and head-scratching.

* Creating a proper QGIS plugin deployment for use by others (not
necessarily the public). Using 'make' to aid deployment seems fine to
many devs, but most scripters have never had to learn how to write
make files when working with an interpreted language. The
functionality of a make file could be replaced with simple check-boxed
include/exclude listing of project files in the GUI for stripping out
unneeded resources. Compiling will already be done during
deployment/packaging.

* Learn how to use the new plugin repo for a plugin release. This may
be the first time a coder has had to use or need a SCM. Having git
available on hub.qgis.org will be a definite boon to those new to such
things.

* Learn how to work with users via a bug tracker, etc. and respond
with fixes or new releases.

* Learn QtWebKit, or similar tool, for creating good, embedded user
documentation.

* Learn how to internationalize the visible strings of the plugin. A
cursory examination of currently available plugins shows this is not
always at the top of most devs list.

* Learn Sphynx to generate plugin documentation, especially if the
pugin has public methods, etc.

* Learn to write proper code (PEP adherence, use of PyLint, etc.).

* Learn to work with other devs who may want to fork the plugin and
introduce new code.

* Learn to create unit tests (if they care about stability and not
breaking code).

* I'm sure there are others


Let's assume some realistic, but proficient QGIS users who may want to
try to develop a plugin...

A) Know none of the above requisites.

B) Know some Python, but never created plugins or GUIs with it before.

C) Know some Python, created some plugins for other software, but no
GUIs with it before. (<-- I started here)

D) Know quite a bit of Python and have written some GUIs before (maybe
with wxPython or PyQt)

E) Know more than users A thru D.


Given the above noted requisites for crafting a QGIS plugin, which
should be considered the base user for my plugin? I'm designing for
user A), for whom I think the Plugin Editor should a least offer a
clear understanding of how to achieve not only writing a plugin, but
also how to eventually meet the best practice requisites noted above,
and offer the tools or links to resources to do so.

The QGIS project has first-class, clearly written code and support
documentation, created by driven developers and authors who try to
meet high-quality OS standards. It would be good to gently push new
plugin developers to strive to meet similar standards, but not at the
price of the learning curve becoming a wall. I'm hoping that Plugin
Editor will help new plugin developers enjoy their path to writing
quality plugins by reducing learning obstacles to manageable steps.
Any help with breaking down the requisites, and when they should be
introduced to the neophyte developer (in the embedded tutorial) would
be greatly appreciated.

I'm striving to have the Plugin Editor qualify for 'user-friendly,' a
status already achieved by QGIS, which is why I use it.

I'm not sure I understand what you are asking, but probably you can
find all you need here:

validation, you can easily remove Django dependencies
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/validator.py

upload script:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/utils/plugin_upload.py

specifications:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] a search plugin
Message-ID: <4F3A1220.1040803@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just published a plugin to perform searches in a layer.

I know that for many of you this plugin is just a waste of time since 
there is already the SQL advanced search.

I did this plugin for end-users who have pretty much no idea about SQL. 
With this plugin, you select a layer, and you can add constraints to 
your search using usual vocabulary and also the aliases instead of the 
field names.

The unique values are listed in an editable combo box for each search item.

You can also save your search to run it later again.

See also the menu to define settings.

Please feel free to comment, and suggest improvements.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qsearch/

Btw, I cannot fetch plugin repo 1 in qgis today...

Cheers,

Denis

There is no specialized algorithm, the procedure in which pixel values are
computed is explained in the Context Help. Its just a linear assignment,
say for a buffer of 10 pixels, and decay of 0, the central pixel has a
value of 1, 2nd from center pixel has 0.9 and so n upto the 10th pixel with
value 0.  Its then added along for point by point. So the more the number
of points, the more the pixels' value.
http://idvux.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/heat-maps/ has a nice explanation of
various types of heatmaps (value interpolated, frequency). This tool
generated a frequency heatmap. So there is not much of algo space left.

Somethings like smoothing of boundaries can be done, but that would be more
of visual appeal without mathematical basis I think (correct me if wrong).

The code is completely self contained, hence cannot be accessed from
outside.

Simply put its a "radial gradient".

Hi all,

most functions of Dxf2Shp Converter plugin now in core. QGIS opens *.dxf
file using OGR provider and can save them to shapefile or other OGR
supported format from layer context menu. Converting lines to polygons
and polygons to lines possible with fTools, same with extracting nodes.
Maybe we can drop this plugin?

Thanks

This plugin is deprecated in regard of the functions of the ogr's 
driver but its ui offers some useful features not available with the 
standard tool such geom's choice

Hi Arunmozhi, nice job!

I would suggest apply a default colormap (instead of greyscale or as
option) for the plugin output.

cheers

Agreed, but geometry can be converted using fTools (Lines to polygons,
Polygons to lines and Extract Nodes)

 Hi,

 Until QGIS offers a way to select the geometry type (POINT, LINE, 
 POLYGON) I would like to keep the dxf2shp plugin. Currently QGIS only 
 picks the geometry type that OGR reports first, correct? This can be at 
 random. There is no way to control which geometries are loaded 
 currently.

 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] layers in qgs project saved
Message-ID: <1329226960006-4468882.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
I have a little problem with the latest release master (even with the
previous one).

When run QGIS the map window does not show my layers to how they were saved
in the project. To view the layers I do zoom to layer or zoom to extension.

this a bug?
or is it a local problem?

regards

SL

You can always go the properties and apply "Pseudo Color" color map I hope.

I stopped including QGIS mapserver because in OS X 10.7 (Lion) Apple dropped fastcgi (required by mapserver) from their Apache distribution.

When I have time I plan to figure out a way to include it.  While it is possible to compile fastcgi for Apache on Lion, this creates a packaging complexity because Snow Leopard does have fastcgi, and my package is supposed to work on both systems.

FYI, as soon as code is released as a Plugin it's GPL. That does mean
that anyone is allowed to take it change it and republish it, though
when republishing it would not be on behalf of the original author nor
would they necessarily endorse the release and in some cases need to
change the name if it's something Trademarked.

That said, it's not our 1st choice to make fixes in people's plugins. In
this scenario Hub was seen as a way to rescue abandoned plugins, one's
in which the author becomes unreachable or has not interest in working
on their code anymore. History has shown this to happen to some plugins
that are quite popular.

I'll state again, there is 0 requirement to host a plugin on hub. Anyone
can upload to plugins.qgis.org. As an FYI someone else may create a hub
project for you in order to allow the filing of tickets against your
plugin, but rarely would anyone create a repo for you unless the
community decides it's abandoned and wants to continue it's development.

Alex

Thanks. That's exactly what I was looking for.


In 'introduction.rst' there is a note:

Am I to understand that auto-creation of a repository/tracker is
possibly a future feature of the app?

Hi,

 

Very usable plugin. I tested and for me is missing >Zoom to< function which
position search result  and maybe a good aproach will be >Show table<
representing a table with result.

 

Best wishes, Joze.

Hi all,

I just published a plugin to perform searches in a layer.

I know that for many of you this plugin is just a waste of time since there
is already the SQL advanced search.

I did this plugin for end-users who have pretty much no idea about SQL. With
this plugin, you select a layer, and you can add constraints to your search
using usual vocabulary and also the aliases instead of the field names.

The unique values are listed in an editable combo box for each search item.

You can also save your search to run it later again.

See also the menu to define settings.

Please feel free to comment, and suggest improvements.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qsearch/

Btw, I cannot fetch plugin repo 1 in qgis today...

Cheers,

Denis

Hi Larry,

This topic has been discussed some times in the past: there was a
proposal to make the creation of a project+tracker+GIT-repo on redmine
happen automatically or semi-automatically (on plugin author's
request) when a plugin is uploaded on plugins.qgis.org.

This is not on my priority list, but maybe it will be eventually implemented.

Regards.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvMk6MVhZ=rhKQ1ihx2uB46F-8Szt=3apV9sTQeh-zYFiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to activate debug output (sent by QgsDebugMsg), and
setting the environment variable "QGIS_DEBUG" has no effect:

QGIS_DEBUG=1 qgis
Warning: loading of qgis translation failed
[/home/softdev/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
[no debug output at all]


I also tried activating QGISDEBUG with cmake, but no success:

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SOFT_PREFIX  -D
PYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so -D QGISDEBUG=1 ..
[...]
CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    QGISDEBUG

What is the proper way of compiling and running QGis with debug
messages enabled?

thanks
Etienne

Hi Denis,

any thanks for the plugin, pretty cool.


I'm getting this error



An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

when unchecking the option "display only fields with aliases"

Hi Giovanni,

I think that version 1.0.1 should have fixed this, can you check you 
have the last version?

Thanks a lot!

Thanks!

I am working on these.

First one is happening when you have no aliases defined in layer. I will 
define things more strictly here.

Thanks also for second. Hopefully, I'll fix these today.

Denis,

You don't happen to know C++ do you?  I would love to see this as a core
function of QGIS (with some tweaking).  I really like the style you have
taken with this.

Thanks!

I overlooked, this information is available at
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Building_QGIS_with_CMake#Important-variables

for reference, debugging can be disabled by setting QGIS_DEBUG=-1

thanks,

Hi Giovanni,

Fixing was not really easy, but it's done with version 1.1

For first bug:
- I added a confirmation dialog. When you enable "only field with 
aliases", if it exists fields without aliases, it will ask you before 
deleting these fields.
- Also, if you add a field to a layer without any alias and if you have 
"only aliases" checked, the field combo box is empty. If you switch to 
all fields, this line will be removed (it was empty, so no need for 
confirmation).

I also fixed the bug when you don't have any layer.

Debugging is not really easy as there's a few situations possible. I did 
my best, hopefully, this release is more stable.
Thanks again for testing!

Greetings

Denis

Hi Nathan,

Thanks a lot for your comment.
It's a pity but I have pretty much no idea about C++.
If someone has time and competence, I can discuss the behavior and he 
could add it to Qgis core.

At the same time, I think this plugin doesn't meet yet the requirements 
in terms of stability and GUI to be in core.

Please let me know if someone's interested, otherwise I might do this in 
a few months (or years...).

cheers

Denis

Hi Paolo, Tim

>Marco, any idea about when this will happen?

I've pushed the raster_resampler branch into the qgis/Quantum-GIS 
repository. Like this, developers can directly make changes in it.
I think it is important to do enough testing before integrating into 
master branch. Tim already found and fixed an issue, I'm sure there are 
more issues around.

On the other hand, once people are used to the average resampling for 
zoomed-out rasters, I'm sure they don't like to go back to 'nearest 
neighbour'.

Regards,
Marco

Hello experts,

I've been trying to configure PyCharm to remotely debug Quantum GIS
plugins. Can anyone help me on how to do it? I tried to do this:
http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2010/12/python-remote-debug-with-pycharm/ but
no luck.

Also, what are the best practices on how to deploy/test a new plugin? The
biggest problem I've seem is that my project (that it's located elsewhere)
needs to be transfered to .qgis/plugins to work. How can I circumvent this
need? Or should I build a "pre build" script?

Thanks for all the help,

Consider setting up a Makfile or other script that compiles your Qt
resources and strips the plugin of unnecessary files and deposits a
working, deployed copy in the <user dir>/.qgis/python/plugins/
directory. See other plugin's Makefiles for examples on how to do
this. The Plugin Builder plugin also has an example Makefile.

During development, you can use the Plugin Reloader plugin to reload
and test the plugin without restarting QGIS.


I use a slightly different approach, which works on Unix-like
machines, where I create a symbolic link from my project dir into
<user dir>/.qgis/python/plugins/

For example on my Mac I use:

ln -s /Users/larrys/QGIS/PluginProjects/my_plugin
/Users/larrys/.qgis/python/plugins/my_plugin

The plugin will then be available to load in QGIS. Then I use Plugin
Reloader during development. This method skips the need to run make
every time I want to test the plugin in QGIS.

When I'm ready to release the plugin, I run make on my Makefile which
deploys to a different, test plugin folder, e.g. <user
dir>/.qgis/python/plugins/my_plugin_test. After restarting QGIS and
testing that the deployment works OK, I quit QGIS and move the test
plugin from the plugins directory, renaming it appropriately.


For PyQt development, I prefer Eric4 [1], as it has good tools for
compiling and working specifically with PyQt. Also, it is entirely
built using PyQt. So, if you want to know how something can be done,
just open up Eric's files and take a look. The code is very well
documented. It also has good support for custom and remote debugging.
Eric5 is built for Python 3.x, but QGIS is probably most stable when
using Python 2.x, so I recommend trying Eric4 (4.5.x).

Hi everyone,
The bug reporting guidelines at http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Bugreports define "low" priority as "a problem which doesn't affect QGIS usefulness, and is presumably trivial to fix".
I think this description is a little confusing and we should delete the second part.
Something can be low priority but non-trivial to fix.  The definitions for the other levels of priority do not say anything about how easy something is to fix.
Does anyone disagree with changing this?

+1 to change.  Most people reporting bugs would also not know how trivial
or non trivial the fix would be.

Hi all,

I would like to come back to Nathan's idea of integrating qSearch plugin 
in the core.
I don't think this the right way to go.

As discussed already with Andreas Neuman, I think that a good way is to 
have an "edit form" dialog that can do everything:

- If you have a multiple selection, arrows added in the bottom of dialog 
allow you to browse the selection, item per item (replacing Item Browser 
plugin).

- you can edit the fields as you browse, but you can also apply the 
changes for the whole selection (replacing QuickMultiAttribute plugin - 
great btw)

- you can search features in the layer using the same edit form. Maybe 
by adding checkboxes in front of each field, you can select which would 
be used in the search. You would browse your result in the same window. 
(replacing qSearch plugin)

I heard that some of these changes might be made by J?rgen. Don't really 
know what part.

Just wanted to say that these plugins are just bridging a gap which 
hopefully will not remain long and that the search/browse/edit should be 
considered as one thing.

I don't really know right now if it's possible as a unique plugin. I 
don't think it is worth the time I would spend on this, if this is added 
to the core a few months later.

Greetings,

Denis

Yes they are.
You'll find more information on QGIS wiki :

Lyon airport has some low-cost flight connections. You can find very cheap flight 
if you book in advance.

Do not hesitate to send emails on this list or at conferences@osgeo.asso.fr 
for any question regarding the hackfest's organization.

Can't help you on this.

I sent pull requests to the plugin builder github repository to integrate new 
makefile rules, including deploy and upload to official plugin repository.
This and the plugin reloader plugin lets you test a new plugin version with a 
few keystrokes (make deploy, switch to qgis, F5).
You can find it at :

Builder/commit/20b46c00740c06d6f2840f534b5d8eb92f0112ec

Hope that helps,
Vincent

-1 Mainly because this might be confusing to what mode you are in and
confuse the user.  I would have to see the UI design first.

Hi,

how can I change to the tool "Select features by rectangle" per python? Is
it possible with qgis.gui/QgisInterface?

There is an actionSelectRectangle() in QgisInterface.

Thanks 3nids! But how do I call it?

"self.iface.actionSelectRectangle()" does not work/ nothing happens.

I never tried this.
Maybe, you can look in the mapCanvas() to the setMapTool()
But I don't know if this is a mapTool.

Maybe someone more aware than me could be more precise!

Just an update on this issue I found, it seems that postigis tables
that are not in the "public" schema are not available in the browser,
but they are visible in the "Add PostGIS Layer" dialog.

Something must have changed recently in the browser or the postgis
driver - any ideas?

Bug entry is here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5022

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Mac OS Build Architecture Setting?
Message-ID: <16EF6A13-3BD1-4ED2-96D5-707EDE0F2D23@dandittmann.org>

I have been attempting to build theversion 1.9 of QGIS for Mac OS 10.7.3 and have been unable to complete the compile.

I suspect the problem likely is an architecture setting which I am overlooking. Based on the errors pasted below, is it an architecture setting or something else? The output from cmake appears to imply everything is ok dependency wise. The log from cmake is at the bottom.


I am attempting the build with a mix of William Kyngesburye's libraries and MacPorts Libraries. Below I have included what I am using for cmake and the build.

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Applications -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -D WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE -D WITH_MAPSERVER=TRUE -D SIP_BINARY_PATH=/opt/local/bin/sip-2.7 QWT_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libqwt.dylib -D QWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/include/qwt -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64  ..

make -j 2	(I have a dual core processor)


 While attempting the build I receive the following errors.

Thanks,
Dan

The _OGR_L_* symbols are part of libgdal. Looks like you have a 32-bit
version of GDAL running around that is getting in the way of the build.

Maybe.  But if so, then qgis_core would have failed also, since that links GDAL also and is compiled first.

One thing to try is a simple "make".  Sometimes the parallel compilation can get ahead of itself (maybe some dependency isn't properly waited for?) and you get errors.

Also, to see all the gory details of the compilation (may help figure out if some other GDAL is linking), add this to the cmake configuration:

-D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true

That's the problem with having more than one copy of a library running
around---you never know when it will work its way into the build system.

It is entirely possible that the linker got fed one set of paths that
listed the 64 bit version when compiling qgis_core and another set of paths
that listed the 32 bit version when compiling the OGR Provider.

I am now able to build QGIS. As far as I can tell, there were two issues affecting the build.

1) Mistakes in my cmake command. I ended up going with:
(Broken up to make it easier to read.)

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Applications \
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE= MinSizeRel \
-D WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE \
-D WITH_MAPSERVER=TRUE \
-D SIP_BINARY_PATH=/opt/local/bin/sip-2.7 \
-D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 \
-D QWT_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libqwt.dylib \
-D QWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/include/qwt \
-D GDAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/include \
-D GDAL_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libgdal.dylib ..


2) The portion of the script FindGDAL.cmake script which verifies the GDAL version does not play nice with libraries which are not structured as OS X style frameworks (as is the case for many frameworks installed by MacPorts). To rectify this, I commented out lines 56 through 64 of the script ./cmake/FindGDAL.cmake. 

I suspect I maybe over simplifying or even overlooking something, but wouldn't it make more sense to attempt parsing the output from running
gdal-config --version
rather than grabbing it from a plist file?



=== Lines 56 through 64 of ./cmake/FindGDAL.cmake ===

#          GET_VERSION_PLIST (${GDAL_LIBRARY}/Resources/Info.plist GDAL_VERSION)
#          IF (NOT GDAL_VERSION)
#            MESSAGE (FATAL_ERROR "Could not determine GDAL version from framework.")
#          ENDIF (NOT GDAL_VERSION)
#          STRING(REGEX REPLACE "([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)" "\\1" GDAL_VERSION_MAJOR "${GDAL_VERSION}")
#          STRING(REGEX REPLACE "([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)" "\\2" GDAL_VERSION_MINOR "${GDAL_VERSION}")
#          IF (GDAL_VERSION_MAJOR LESS 1 OR GDAL_VERSION_MINOR LESS 4)
#            MESSAGE (FATAL_ERROR "GDAL version is too old (${GDAL_VERSION}). Use 1.4.0 or higher.")
#          ENDIF (GDAL_VERSION_MAJOR LESS 1 OR GDAL_VERSION_MINOR LESS 4)

I didn't see this post as I was in the process of running a few test compiles as a sanity check prior to posting what I found as a resolution. 

I ran cmake with the suggested verbose flag as well as a simple make and received similar output as before. (That has been pasted at the bottom of this message.) When finished, the output indicated GDAL was at /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework as it did before.

Ultimately, as long as I am able to build a current version, I am happy. It makes little difference which set libraries I build against.

Hi all yesterday I pushed a new alpha version of qgis for android on
android.qgis.org

This release includes all the goodies that I got to implement lately
including:
- right click support through longClick
- shape file support
- gps
- compass
- android 4 support
- partial hardware optimization for armV7a (most newish devices have it)
- no debug symbols

I m very happy with this release because it adresses and fixes all high
priority bugs.
Adding support for a armv7a optimized whit no debug symbols build increased
greatly the speed of the app. The package you need to install is the same
and includes both armv5 and armv7a code. Android will take care of using
the correct version. Gdal and geos are not available yet in v7a code so the
v5 versions will be loaded.
I couldn't test much the v7 code so I hope you can help me testing it.
As well, on www.opengis.ch I published many videos and screenshots  of qgis.
As usual, please remember if you can (or if you know anybody that could)
that sponsoring would help a lot implementing some more great features.

Ciao

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the note - sounds encouraging.

I have a strange issue with the install. The Master 5 downloads file and
then installs for a while. At the end I get a message "Anwendung nicht
installiert" (application not installed), but with a green checkmark. To
me the green checkmark looks ok, but why is saying "Anwendung nicht
installiert"?

How can I check if the application is equivalent with master5?

In the about dialogue I don't get a version number. QGIS code revision
reports as "exported".

Regarding right-click: where is right click supported? Everywhere where
it should work (e.g. layer manager) or just for digitizing?

Thanks,
Andreas

I got the same message.  I uninstalled the older version and re-installed
the latest alpha and the install was ok.

Mmm the installation is taken care of by the android installer.
Try uninstalling qgis, I started signing the packages from this release and
they might conflict.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to Use Qgis API to Collapse or Expand a Layer?
Message-ID: <1329482314336-4479915.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi All:
    I try to use qgis pyton api to collapse/expand a layer.
    I found that In legendInterface class, there's a method
"refreshLayerSymbology"
    can make the layer expand.
    But I can find method to let layer Collapsed.
    Is there a method to do it? thanks a lot.

    KSJ

Hi

An uninstall of the old version helped. Works fine now - thanks!
Right-click works.

Cool.

Hi,

on my Android phone the CRS database is missing/empty. I cannot select a
CRS.

Can someone confirm if the CRS db is present on Master 5?

Thanks,
Andreas

sorry - I did not run "First run" after the removal/new installation
which seems to populate the CRS database.

All fine now. Sorry the false alarm.

The QGIS findGDAL.cmake is designed to prefer the framework GDAL.  If it is present and you want to use a library GDAL (ie Macports), add to your cmake config:

-D CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST

The only problem is that ALL frameworks (except Qt and system) will be skipped completely.

But your verbose compile still looks good:

> /usr/bin/c++   -arch x86_64 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk -bundle -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names   -o ../../../PlugIns/qgis/libogrprovider.so CMakeFiles/ogrprovider.dir/qgsogrprovider.cpp.o CMakeFiles/ogrprovider.dir/qgsogrdataitems.cpp.o CMakeFiles/ogrprovider.dir/moc_qgsogrprovider.cxx.o CMakeFiles/ogrprovider.dir/moc_qgsogrdataitems.cxx.o -L/Users/dandittmann/Desktop/qgis-Quantum-GIS/build/src/core -L/Users/dandittmann/Desktop/qgis-Quantum-GIS/build/src/gui ../../../output/lib/qgis_core.framework/Versions/1.9/qgis_core -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit /opt/local/lib/libQtXml.dylib /opt/local/lib/libQtCore.dylib /opt/local/lib/libQtGui.dylib /opt/local/lib/libQtNetwork.dylib /opt/local/lib/libQtSvg.dylib -framework PROJ -framework GEOS -framework GDAL -framework SQLite3 

From this, I don't see any way that it can accidentally find a different GDAL than intended.  Cmake is very explicit with linking to avoid accidental linking.

So it's still a mystery.  Probably something wierd in Macports.  Personally I don't care for Macports (or Fink), and my ultimate advice would be to uninstall it completely and follow the QGIS install instructions for compiling cmake and the other dependencies manually and installing the stock Qt.  But it's your choice...

returns:

So I tried:

Thank you, Salvatore Larosa.
        I read the link you give, it looks like build a PyQGIS applications
( Without QGIS Application ).
        Although I just want to build a Qgis plugin using python ( Within
QGIS Application ),
    I learn "the legend" ( like qgis.utils.iface.legendInterface() ) is a
kind of  QTreeWidget.
    It can process layers ( eg. QTreeWidgetItem or QgsLegendModel ??).
    But I still not found using API to collapse/expand a layer or get legend
object.
        I Think If I can get QGIS application's legend object,
    I can use the QTreeWidget's method collapseItem/expandItem to get what I
want (Maybe...).

I will try my best and thank you again.

Personally I don't care for Macports (or Fink), and my ultimate advice would be to uninstall it completely and follow the QGIS install instructions for compiling cmake and the other dependencies manually and installing the stock Qt.  But it's your choice?

Unfortunately I do use MacPorts for a few other things so it's not going anywhere especially considering I was able to work out a solution. Out of curiousity, I made a few additional attempts/test compiles last night and I think part of the mystery comes down how my $PATH is set.  In my case, the usual system stuff (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin) is processed last so it is fair to assume there is an interaction going on there.

(Trying again as I accidentally sent a reply from the wrong email account causing the message to get bounced.)

It probably is less work to go with the Windows version, but I thought I would point out, if you have MacPorts installed already, you might consider going with that version. A look at the dependencies does show fcgi listed. Unfortunately however, that version does not appear to be getting maintained as it is only at 1.7.0. Given the scenario, I'd probably go with the Windows version as well.


$ port deps qgis
Full Name: qgis @1.7.0_0+postgis+python27

I have QGIS with Server (qgis_mapserv.fcgi) running on Snow Leopard
and Lion. I also have a fix for the Lion Apache server's lack of
fastcgi, though it is beta. My QGIS source builds strictly use Mr.
Kyngesburye's installed frameworks, with no MacPorts support. You will
need to ensure /opt/local is not in your PATH (or at least at its
end). My additions to the front end of PATH are:

#Kyng Frameworks
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/FFTW3.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/cairo.framework/Programs:$PATH

I also have PostgreSQL and GRASS from his installers on the Macs I
build on, which will be bundled if using the #1 bundling option. You
can follow my build setup using the references listed below ([2] is a
bit scrappy and hard to follow, and you can ignore the QScintilla
stuff, if not interested in using Eric4). Let me know if you have any
success. I have had problems compiling the 1_7_3 branch, but have been
successful with the 1_7 (RC) and master branches.

After building, I use MacPort-installed Nginx as a reverse proxy to
MapProxy running via uWSGI to QGIS Server running via
MacPort-installed spawn-fcgi. I find that setup more modular and less
demanding on resources than putting everything under Apache's parent
process.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Sip flag to generate docstrings
Message-ID: <F603EF8F-9A28-41F9-92CD-1155C7C5F18F@geoapt.com>

I would like to propose that we add the -o flag to this line in CMakeLists.txt:

SET(SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS ${PYQT4_SIP_FLAGS} -o)

This tells sip to automatically generate docstrings for all classes and methods. These in turn can be accessed from Python. 

When using the IPython plugin this provides valuable information when constructing a statement.

I have tested this on Linux (Ubuntu) and OS X and it works fine. 

The -o flag was added to sip at 4.10. Currently the INSTALL instructions specify sip 4.8 as the minimum version so that would have to be changed.

Can someone test this on the Windows build? Any downsides to adding the flag?

I think any option to help when accessing PyQGIS the better.

On a similar side note, not sure what Python editor you use, but with Eric4
(and its mini editor) you could also have auto-completion of the PyQGIS
methods, etc if there was a QScintilla API file generated with the sip '-a
<output api file>' option as well. I don't believe QScintilla even needs to
be installed.

However, I have not been able to get the -a option to work when adding to
the SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS, fails on compile. Have you (or anyone else) tried
this in addtion to the -o flag?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for packaging: QGIS 1.7.4
Message-ID: <1329687564.6763.9.camel@lost>

Hi Developers and packet assemblers!

Thanks to the hard work of all developers and thanks to Alexander Bruy
for backporting a lot of bugfixes I am able to branch the fourth
maintenance release on the 1.7.x branch "release-1_7_4" as of today
(19th Feb. 2012).

The source tarball is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.4.tar.bz2
and the md5 checksum is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.4.tar.bz2.md5

You can check out this branch (depending on your git configuration)
using:

git fetch origin
git branch --track release-1_7_4 origin/release-1_7_4

If packagers would be so kind as to update http://download.qgis.org
with links to their latest wares, it will be appreciated. I'll give a
few days (and until we have Windows binaries at minimum) before making
the announcement to the world. (So I assume a week should be good to go
to announce the release next Sunday 26th Feb. 2012)

Please note that I have reinstated maintenance of the CHANGELOG file
in the root of the source tree, so consult that (or the
help->about->whats new? tab after building) to see what changes were
made.
There are no new features in the release, only bug fixes and small
tweaks.

This seems to be now the famous "strk"-release - And yes - I am going to
implement the NEWS file and adjust the CHANGELOG file to its "original"
meaning by GNU. But I'll rather implement that in master and probably in
1.8.0 release. So please forgive me for not doing it right now - very
busy days here :)

As this is the second release I do now - there are probably some
glitches that i've not seen.. If there is something wrong with the
repository or the source package - please report as soon as possible so
that I can correct the mistakes before any packagers have completed
their packages.

Special thanks as always to Alexander Bruy for supporting me in any way
and doing most of the backports.
There are surely still some bugs but we have done our best to backport
every available and possible fix.

Best regards and happy packaging.
Werner

This line in CMakeLists.txt (top-level of source tree) works for me:
SET(SIP_EXTRA_OPTIONS ${PYQT4_SIP_FLAGS} -o -a ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/python/qscintilla_api)

Not sure where to place the resulting file though...

Looks like the data is just sitting in the HTML ~line 104 as an array of
WKT points. Copy, paste, run through jsonpretty and rock out.

That's good to hear! Thank you for trying it out. Was that on Mac or
Linux? Master or 1_7_x branch? Qt 4.7.4 or 4.8? What version of sip?

> Not sure where to place the resulting file though...

Does the resultant file have contents? Like (from PyQt's api file):

PyQt4.QtCore.qInstallMsgHandler?4(callable) -> callable
PyQt4.QtCore.qRegisterResourceData?4(int, str, str, str) -> bool
PyQt4.QtCore.qUnregisterResourceData?4(int, str, str, str) -> bool

I have gotten empty files before. If yours is OK, then, on the Mac, it goes in:

/usr/local/Qt4.[7|8]/qsci/api/python/

as per default open source Qt install. For Eric to use the API files
they need to be statically linked in by compiling via the Eric API
preference dialog (which should automatically compile the APIs in that
default directory) [1]. Other options for Eric4's use of the API files
are in the Autocompletion and Call Tips dialogs.

Could you post a link to the generated PyQGIS API file? (In case I
miserably fail at compiling it again.) Like to test it out.

The other APIs you may notice in my prefs are from a custom
out-of-sys.path Eric4 install that I do for testing QGIS plugins with
the copied mini editor, so the test plugin doesn't accidentally
reference some installed Eric4 module. My notes on doing that [2].

Unfortunately sip is run in three passes (I think) so the file is getting overwritten. It only contains the results of the last run. Not sure how to manage that since there is one flag setting in CMake.

Thanks! It works great. Even though it is only part of the API, at
least it's the GUI calls, a real time saver on typing and looking up,
once you have a clue about them.

I thought that might be a problem but never got to your success with
it. Now I see that my compiles of QGIS are flawed in a different way,
which made me think it was the sip -a option. Can now test this
further sometime.

I see the creation timestamp of the python modules (in bundled Mac
builds) as follows, last built to first:

gui.so
core.so
analysis.so
utils.py
console.py
__init__.py

This makes sense why the gui.api overwrote the previous modules.
utils.py and console.py are just copied and can have their APIs built
with a direct command line sip call, after their copy, and from their
parent 'python/qgis/' directory.

If it was possible to slip in a name variable for analysis.so,
core.so, and gui.so during their sip build to produce
pyqgis_analysis.api, pyqgis_core.api, and pyqgis_gui.api,
respectively, that would solve the overwrite issue.

Post build you would end up with the following individual API files:

pyqgis_analysis.api
pyqgis_core.api
pyqgis_gui.api
pyqgis_console.api
pyqgis_utils.api

which I think you can just 'cat' those together and create pyqgis.api,
since there appears to be no metadata in the API files.

Referencing the built pyqgis.api you sent, it looks like everything
will work fine if users stick with the module import convention of:

from qgis import core, gui  (etc)

as the API lines started with 'qui.Qg..'.

I'm by no means a CMake wizard, but this seems fairly possible. Maybe
Phil Thompson could be consulted? Maybe the API files can be generated
using the .so files directly, after their creation, like regular
Python modules? (I saw no command line option for that.)

Thanks for the help, Gary.

When building 1_7_4 from archive, on Mac, with a locally installed
libfcgi.dylib, the build errors at the very end due to a typo in
'mac/cmake/2lib.cmake.in' [1]:

CMake Warning at mac/2lib.cmake:114 (IF):
  given arguments:

    "/usr/local/lib/libfcgi.dylib MATCHES" ".*libfcgi.dylib" "AND"

  Unknown arguments specified
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  mac/cmake_install.cmake:43 (INCLUDE)
  cmake_install.cmake:46 (INCLUDE)


Mr. Kyngesburye appears to have fixed this in the master branch
'2lib.cmake.in' file, but it still remains in the 1_7_4 branch.

[1] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/master-to-1_7_4-2lib.cmake.in.diff


Also, I can only build from the ZIP archive, not the git fetch (errors
after '[ 43%] Built target qgis_gui'). Will investigate further to see
if it is my setup only.

Message-ID: <4F41F369.1070801@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am missing the ability of removing temporarly from display one rule of 
a rule-based style.

It might be too heavy to add checkboxes in the layers panel, but in the 
style tab of layer properties dialog, would it be ok to add checkboxes 
to easily enable/disable the rules?

Is anyone intersted by this?

Greetings,

Hi devs,

  I would like to inform the list that we finally found time to publish our
Lizmap plugin and web client.

* Lizmap Web Client is an alternative to Qgis Web Client : it aims to
dynamically create a full featured web map from Qgis projects. It is an web
application based on PHP / Jquery / OpenLayers / HTML / CSS. Qgis Server is
used by Lizmap as the WMS server.
* Lizmap Plugin is a python plugin which help the user to configure global
map options (scales, base layers, etc.) and layers options (basic metadata,
group as layer, etc.). before sending files from local computer to the
server via FTP. Basically it collects and save all the user configuration
in a file "project.qgs.cfg" (if the project is named e.g. "project.qgs"),
and uses external librairies (lftp in linux, winscp in Windows, nothing yet
in mac) to mirror the data in the user computer and in the server folder.

To create a web map, you need to install and configure the Web Client on a
server, give an FTP access to one or more users so that they can
add/modifiy files in some server folder. The users must use Lizmap Plugin
to publish their project. It is possible to manually send the modified
files (qgis projects, data, and config file) to the server, with other
tools and other protocols (sftp, rsync, etc.), but only FTP is available
from the plugin at the moment.

Some interested features :
* Full CSS/html/Javascript web application : web designers/developpers can
easily change the look and feel of the web maps (change color, windows
placements, etc.)
* web map features : full screen map, layer tree with integrated layer
legend, popup with getFeatureInfo, overview map, navigation tools (zoom,
pan, etc.)
* Scale visibility : if the layers/group are not visible at one scale, they
are deactivated and greyed out (and you can decide to hide them by changing
one CSS line)
* With the "title" field, it is easy to set a human readable name for the
layers in the web application, and keeping original layer name in the
project. For example a layer called "xy_foobar" can be viewed as "Foo bar".
* Group layers as one web layer : you can choose to use a Qgis group of
layers as a single layer in Lizmap Web Application
* Decide which scales you want to have in the web map
* Optional Overview map : if a group "Overview" containing layers exists in
your project, its layers will be shown in a small miniature map, called
"overview"
* external baselayers : if your project has no good candidate layers for
base layers, you can add Google or OpenStreetMap layers (you must activate
on the fly reprojection so that Qgis Server can send the layers in
EPSG:900913
* multi-project and multi-repository : one single lizmap web application
can use several projects stored in several server folders.
* ftp synchronisation : with the plugin, you can easily send all the
modified files in the server. For example, in the first sync, the plugin
will send the project "project.qgs", lizmap config file "project.qgs.cfg"
and all the data files (raster, vector, etc.). The next time you modified
your project and/or the configuration and/or the data files, only modified
files will be sent.
* Optionnaly use a cache server (mapcache, tilecache) for layers. If you
have installed and configured a cache server, with names for layers
corresponding as the name of the layers in you qgis project, you can tell
the plugin to use the cache instead of Qgis server.
* ...

Documentation is in progress. You can have some installation and use guide
in the Qgis hub  :
* Lizmap Plugin : http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lizmapplugin  (See related
wiki page)
* Lizmap Web Client : http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lizmapwebclient (see
wiki page )

We are very excited in 3liz about Lizmap. We think using a PHP application
between the client (web map) and Qgis Server will bring many opportunities
to developp interesting features such as rights management (per project,
per layers, etc.), dynamic list of projects availables, etc.

Jurgen, what can be a solution to these libqgis versions conflicts?
Adding old versions to debian/control.Conflicts seems not to be a
solution since we would finish with never ending list of versions.

Does it make a sense to build it as versioned library if it is not
possible to successfully run multiple version together ?

Hi!

No, I just run the upgrade, which is supposed to remove whatever has
to be removed.
Once I removed  libqgis1.7.3, both problems were solved but had
problems with python-gdal.
I have had to downgrade python-gdal from 1.9.0.1 to 1.8.0-2, do not
know why (I thought this problem had been solved).

So, before upgrading to qgis 1.7.4 at least on ubuntu 10.04 64bits,
1. Remove  libqgis1.7.3
2. Do not upgrade to python-gdal 1.9.0.1, or, if you do, downgrade to
python-gdal 1.8.0-2 in Synaptic by
2.1. Select pyton-gdal in the package list
2.2. Click on Packages/Force version and select 1.8.0-2

Thanks

Agus

Hey Denis,

Sure.  This is a great idea. Martin Dobias (the guy that wrote the rule
based rendering) has thought about adding this.  Not sure if/when it is
getting worked on.

Indeed this would be a big step forward.
What does the libqgis1.7.3 library advertises self as ?
It sounds like there's a SONAME equivalence or similar ...

Hi,
In master version (5099c70) on debian machine, I get a wrong scale.
For an area that should be displayed to scale 1:578.000, in qgis I get
1:41.727.804.283

Any hint to resolve this issue?

Hi Nathan,

Thanks for the answer.
I might try to this on my own if I have time, it could be a good way to 
learn c++ and qgis ;)

I agree with Ivan and Sandro.

In master, file debian/control.oneiric contains
Package: libqgis{QGIS_ABI}

The package name should be libqgis1.7 instead of libqgis1.7.3 , with
new versions as packages get updated.

This issue pops up every single release here or in the ubuntu gis
mailing list...

Etienne

Well, depends on your POV.

The problem is that the libraries currently can't coexist.  That's a bug, as
the should be able to - otherwise there's not much point in having separate
libraries at all. 

Unless we have a stable ABI (which we don't have - and maybe never will have),
the package needs to contain the version in it's name.  Removing that would
probably introduce another bug.

Packages depending on libqgis1.7 might break on upgrade.  Yes, I know that
there currently aren't any.

So the packaging is in a sense ok, it just doesn't contain a workaround for the
bug.  But the bug should already be fixed in master and backported to 1.8, but
not to 1.7 (9e21b175 / 813609fe - agreed, not really just a debugging
improvement).   And IIRC the bug only appears when you have stuff still linked
to the old library around (eg. an old grass plugin).

I did take a look in the release-1_7_4 AND release-1_7 branch - both
have the patch included .. 
As I do not have any building environment to test on Mac..
But I am quite sure that the final Mac build will work .. 

Thanks a lot for reporting

kind regards
Werner

Sorry, Werner, my mistake. I created the diff backwards, from master
to 1_7_4. There is definitely an error with quotes on line 114 of
'mac/cmake/2lib.cmake.in' in both 1_7 and 1_7_4 that keeps
libfcgi.dylib from being bundled on a Mac build.

Corrected patch:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4058089/qgis/1_7_4-to-master_2lib.cmake.in.diff

When the patch is applied to 1_7_4, it compiles without error,
bundling the libfcgi.dylib into the Mac QGIS.app.

Hi Larry,

Ok got it ;) should have thought of that ..
If there will be a 1.7.5 - it will be solved .. but I assume the Mac
packages to be correctly produced .. 

In 1.8 and master it is already solved .. 

Thanks for the hint
kind regards
Werner

Hi all,
release time again... happens that just couple of hours after i pushed 
alpha5, the necessitas framework received a new update [1] that 
addresses some important issues.

Meanwhile I managed to compile GEOS and GDAL with armeabi-v7a 
optimizations and updated the wiki [2].

As well, I got some feedbacks that the alpha5 release 
(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release) versions are not as stable (mainly crashes 
loading any vectorial data) as the older ones, so for the moment the 
also the alpha packages are build with Debug symbols.
There are packages with a -armeabi suffix which only include the generic 
armv5 code and packges without which include v5 and v7a code.

furthermore, I started testing signing the nightly packages as well, so 
there should be no unmatched signature problem issue when switching 
between nightly and release packages. please test and report.

I'm sorry for the quick change, but I think at the moment stability is 
way more important than performance.

ciao Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Support for Complex Features
Message-ID: <4F43081E.5010305@yahoo-inc.com>

Hi,

I am new to GIS world recently started using QGIS. It's a wonderful 
tool, and is an excellent example of a good open-source tool.

We are developing a solution that stores spatial data (along with 
attributes) in normalized database tables. This data is exposed via 
GeoServer WFS. A Geotools plugin was developed to convert the data into 
features. We have attributes which can take multiple value and have a 
complex structure. Take this as an example structure of a feature:
<Feature>
<ID>1234</ID>
<Shape>shape</Shape>
<FeatureNames>
<FeatureName>
<Language>en</Language>
<Name>New York</Name>
</FeatureName>
<FeatureName>
<Language>es</Language>
<Name>Nueva York</Name>
</FeatureName>
</FeatureNames>
</Feature>

As I understand WFS specification has support for Complex Features 
(attributes with multiple occurrences, and which are of complex type). 
Does QGIS support either multiplicity or complex types or both? If not, 
can you please give me some information of how I could  customize QGIS 
to enable support for them? Can it be done as a plugin or should the 
core itself be changed?

Thanks,
Sunil

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Transaction in WFS Plugin
Message-ID: <4F430AC9.6020503@yahoo-inc.com>

Hi,

We are exposing some spatial data using GeoServer WFS. This data is 
being rendered and edited using QGIS. We ran a small packet-capture test 
to see how are transactions handled. The observations were as below:

  * 4 separate requests were sent to WFS server
  * The 4 requests have no common handle/identifier to signal they are
    part of the same transaction
  * The requests are for:
      o Update Attributes for all features where attributes were changed
      o Insert new features
      o Update geometry for all features where geometry were changed
      o Delete features
  * WFS specification for Transaction operation supports combination of
    Update, Insert and Delete as part of a single request

Are our inferences correct? If so, can the WFS plugin be customized to 
send all changes in a single Transaction request?

Thanks,
Sunil

The problem is in ccmake configuration. The parameter

Hi!

As I can see you are using version 1.7.2 .. there is already 1.7.4 (not
official right now - but soon official) out there ..
Can you try this version to compile or are you bound to 1.7.2 ..

kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geotiff export using print composer
Message-ID: <1329811713278-4490408.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear all

For the GarminCustomMap plugin I use the print composer (through python) to
export a (high resolution) geotiff.

Because the mapRenderer does not fill the entire paper in the composer
(although the paper size is set according to the mapRenderer size), there is
a reasonable offset / displacement of the resulting geotiff when using the
output of the print composer directly in combination with the coordinates of
the mapRenderer.

In a workaround I managed to improve the precision of the georeferencing by
removing the empty cells around the mapRenderer (remove cells starting from
bottom / right border, until the black/grey pixels of border line of the
mapRenderer are reached). See code here: 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/garmincustommap/repository
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/garmincustommap/repository 

This approach has (mainly) three backdraws:
1) The border is not always rendered identically. E.g. the color (which is
used to identify the border line) can vary depending on the color of nearby
objects in the map (border gets grey when there are no objects close to the
border).
2) Depending on the output DPI the number of pixels in the border lines
varys, resulting in less precision in georeferencing with increased output
DPI.
3) The resulting image has a black borderline which can be disturbing when
geotifs are exported as tiles...

My question is now: do you have any suggestions for tackling these issues?
Solutions I`ld very much appreciate are (starting with the favourits):
1) Make the mapRenderer rectangle cover the entire paper in the composer
(with exactly matching corners). (Any Ideas how to do that?)
2) Having the border of the mapRenderer rendered always in 100% black and
with a fixed number of pixels (regardless output DPI). Are there any
possibilities to define this in the settings for the composer/mapRenderer?
3) Having the border of the mapRenderer rendered always in 100% black and
with the number of pixels in a fixed relation to the output DPI. Would it be
possible to define that?

Thanks for helping!

Cheers
Stefan

If you're not trying to build the trunk version, may I suggest to just rebuild 
the Fedora package or use the package from ELGIS? This approach is a lot 
easier and cleaner.

Hi Stefan

>1) Make the mapRenderer rectangle cover the entire paper in the composer

In your case where you need only the map for the printout (no scalebar, 
legend, ...) and you use programming anyway, I think it would be better 
to do the rendering directly with QgsMapRenderer and not using the 
composer classes.

Marco

The problem occurs if the reference system is not defined, but is this

The orginal message mentioned 1.7.2.
Just an hour ago I have compiled 1.9.90-Alpha with same error message 
(on Fedora 14 x64). Full path for GDAL_LIBRARY has to be used.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 1.7.4
Message-ID: <1329819065.2997.3.camel@lost>

Dear QGIS Developers, Users and Supporters! 

We are pleased to announce that QGIS 1.7.4 is now available. This is a 
bugfix release over version 1.7.3 with a huge amount of fixes.
A detailed changelog is available on our home page[1]. 

Binary downloads[2] are already available but some are still making 
their way to the download page so if you don't see your preferred OS 
there please check again in a day or two. 

Thanks to bug reporters who have reported bugs using upgraded issue 
tracker[3] and special thanks to all developers who fixed those reported
bugs. 

As always, if you find a bug please report it on [3]. 

QGIS is the collaborative effort of many coders, translators, 
documentors, bug reporters and other community members. 

QGIS continues to have great momentum - we recently branched the code 
base for an upcoming release of QGIS 1.8.0 and we are about to break API
compatibility in our 'master' branch to start us down the road towards 
the eventual release of QGIS 2.0. If you enjoy using QGIS and are able 
to, please consider sponsoring our project - the money you donate helps 
us to run our developer meetings and generally keep the project moving 
forward. You can find more details on how to sponsor QGIS on our home 
page[4].

Hi,

I have just compiled qgis 1.9.90-Alpha from
git clone git@github.com:qgis/Quantum-GIS.git

QGIS works fine, but I am not able to find ?QGIS Browser?:

http://planet.qgis.org/planet/tag/qgis browser/

Should it be compiled some how separately?

Thanks,
Z.

Normally its in the bin dir.
Maybe u meed to set a cmake flag.
Check ccmake if you use itit

Hi devs,
I recently started creating release android packages using
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release instead of debug to reduce the packages size. The
problem is that qgis from these packages crashes when loading vector data.
The exact  same code base compiled with debug works perfectly.
Anybody has a pointer?
How can I "translate" a srack dump?
Thanks a lot

There is no special flag for Browser
(from file CMakeLists.txt):

IF (WITH_DESKTOP)
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(app)
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(helpviewer)
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(browser)
   ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(plugins)
ENDIF(WITH_DESKTOP)


'WITH_DESKTOP' has been turned on. What else could  be done?

I hope Browser is not Windos / Mac only?

Hi Marco

Thanks! That did it!
I was not aware of that possibility...
But with a litte try and error how that works in detail, the result looks
better than ever!

Cheers
Stefan

P.S.: This is my approach now (usable in the Python Console within QGIS):

Hi all,

Google Summer of Code 2012 is announced few weeks ago and as far as
I know OSGeo will participate. Hope QGIS will participate too. I started
wiki page for collecting ideas [0]

Maybe we should announce also to the user list asking for ideas too

Thanks Alex. One first thing we have to decide is whether to participate 
within the OSGeo framework. This seems a natural choice, but there are 
possible shortcomings:
- it is possible that we'll have more chances (an higher number of 
accepted projects) running alone, due to Google priorities
- less motivation by mentors (they do not receive any financial 
incentive, that goes to OSGeo instead).
Opinions?

Shame on me! I rebuild QGIS due to WMS problem. Afterwards I inspect the 
bin directory more carefully. Up to now I was looking for wrong binary ? 
qbrowser is the correct one :)

Hi Marco.
Still no joy for me: the installer comes up with an empty list, and the 
main package refuses to install, as usual. But I understand you have 
more urgent issues, I'll be patient :)

Mmm empty list interesting... which icon has your installer? An android

due to my storage being unmounted. Do uou have an sd card in the phone?
Where is the qgis installed?
Did you try to install via pc? Get android sdk, Get the apk, then adb

Hello all, 

I wish to see QGIS participate this year, after many successful
editions!

Let me add some more elements for the decision:

> - it is possible that we'll have more chances (an higher number of 
> accepted projects) running alone, due to Google priorities

It is also possible that QGIS as separate organisation won't get
accepted, thus will have no students, whereas under OSGeo umbrella, one
or two students are almost certain. Well, also OSGeo could not get
accepted, but as umbrella organisations are especially welcome in
participate and OSGeo participated successfully in former editions, it
is less likely than QGIS not getting accepted.

> - less motivation by mentors (they do not receive any financial 
> incentive, that goes to OSGeo instead).

The payment for mentors in this edition of Summer of Code will be
discussed shortly. It has been a point of debate in past editions, and I
will see what can be done about it for this year.

Of course as a separate organisation QGIS will need a organisation
administrator and will be required to complete some bureaucracy on its
own. See
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs#mentoring_apply
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/org_admin_agreement

> Opinions?

QGIS is fully entitled to participate to GSoC, alone or with OSGeo.
If you look for more information about org administration, feel free to
ask me.

All the best,

Anne

I think that QGIS would not be accepted alone (it already got rejected
few years ago). Also participating with OSGeo offloads some program
administration work.

I hope that is something that can still be discussed within OSGeo. I
would be much happier if destination of most of the money would go to
participating project - e.g. 20% for OSGeo and the rest for QGIS
sounds like a sensible choice.

Hi,

Just recently upgraded my QGIS python plugin development environment
on my Macs to Lion (10.7.3) and found that Designer.app, installed via
the Qt 4.8.0 open source libraries dmg, segfaults on launch (all
Macs). I reported the bug [1], which also includes a workaround to get
it to launch, for now, if you aren't using the Phonon designer plugin.
Seems Phonon has several other problems on Lion.

Hi.
Please have a look to git - work was done recently by Marco Hugentobler 
and Bill Williamson.

The code for WFS editing (and also for reading) is in the WFS provider, 
the plugin is only for the GUI.
Edits are sent in the 4 requests because those are the basic edit 
operations of the QGIS vector provider interface. So each data provider 
class implements addFeatures(), deleteFeatures(), etc. if it supports 
that operation. QGIS itself does not have a mechanism to support 
transaction over multiple edit operations.

Ideally, there would be methods like startTransaction(), 
commitTransaction(), discardTransaction() in the provider interface. 
Such methods would allow the WFS provider to send everything in a single 
transaction (and the methods could be ignored by other datasources 
without transaction support).

Maybe it would also be useful to send edits in a single transaction for 
PostGIS edits?

 >Please have a look to git - work was done recently by Marco 
Hugentobler and Bill Williamson.

This was about improving support for WFS filters and for incremental 
reading of features (not about editing).


Regards,
Marco

Hi,

There is no GRAS plug-in in Quantum GIS 1.9.90 (OSGeo4w, as well as 
built from source for Linux). Is it should be so?

Its great that GSOC discussion is happening. I wanted to write to the list,
but was away for a work.

I am currently doing my Masters in Remote Sensing, and GIS is a integral
part of my curriculum. So I have been working with Qgis for quite sometime
and even have got a few things done like the heatmaps plugin. I am going to
apply for QGIS this GSOC.

It would be great if people could add the ideas to the page, anyways I am
looking at the previous years' projects also, but it seems that some things
have been worked out. Looking for a great mentor-ship and a fruitful summer.

The version 0.85 is unfortuately missing one updated file.

In the meantime I created a new version.

The new and (Thanks to Marco!) improved version 0.95 is waiting for
approval...

Message-ID: <CA+RWO7R9o4HRx6k+0Q2BTVdxKgQ_SHyJ-4vndzZcgduGVV+=2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to QGIS. I was able to compile GDAL 1.8.1 with ecw support on
ubuntu, then I built QGIS from source and now I'm able to load ECW file
types.
To create my own gis application I started looking into code examples
available at https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/code_examples/
I tried 1_hello_world_qgis_style and it worked fine for SHP file types.
Then I tried 4_adding_rasters_to_canvas and built it from source in
QtCreator.
I'm able to load TIFF and DEM file types but I can't load ECW file types. I
traced QGIS source code but I couldn't find any special difference between
QGIS and the example code. Should I add some extra code to the example
project to enable ECW support?!
I really appreciate your help in advance.

PS: I'm sending this email to both user and developer mailing list, so I'm
sorry if you receive this email more than once.

Hi,
for windows, you must enter in environment variables 
the folder that contains the libraries of grass (i.e.
"C:\OSGeo4W\path\to\grasslib")

in linux you must put /usr/local/grass-6.4.2/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf and run
ldconfig as root,
this is for debian environment!

I'm not sure it works in windows!

all the best!

Dear Users and Developers,

Due to the fact that the qgis-1.7.4.tar.bz2 tarball had some problems 
which leads to being not able to build QGIS on some Systems the problems 
were solved and QGIS now should build on any System.

As there were only some small changes in the build system, the packages 
which have already been built are not affected.

To provide a source tarball to all people out there who prefer to build 
QGIS out of the tarball I reuploaded the fixed version of the tarball.
It is available from the usual download adress 
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.4.tar.bz2

sorry for the problems that this tarball might have caused to some people

kind regards
Werner

Hi,

how about these projects :

1. Update and merge the multithread branch

2. QGIS, Valgrind & Co

Both would get the student to put its hand in all the dark corners of 
QGIS and both would produce a positive and visible impact.

Hi Alex

The methods to get width and height are defined in the parent class 
QGraphicsRectItem. Just use QgsGraphicsItem::rect().width() and 
QGraphicsRectItem::height().
To set width and height, you may use QgsComposerItem::setItemPosition()

Marco

Message-ID: <CAGyPVTuKZeN9O0-UoqXCAFoU7o8JN2XprzUUfkf9xs=RdNNiUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devs!

Is it possible using python to customize the "save feature" behavior of
QGIS?

This is my use case:

I want to use the built in digitizer functions to create some segments.
After the user finishes a certain segment, I need to validate that record
and perform some extra actions on it.

This is somewhat similar to what ArcGIS have, and they call it Tasks in
ArcObjects. A custom task will perform that custom behavior with that
finished sketch.

How much work will I have to implement something like that? Can it be done
with Python?

Cheers!

Something that has been mentioned by a few people, and would probably be very popular, I described like this:

"Vector editing/geoprocessing tools or whatever they are called, like the ones found in the Mapinfo 'Object' menu - i.e. similar to ftools, but taking sets of selected features as inputs, instead of whole layers."
http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-things-i-would-like-to-see-in-qgis-what-are-yours/
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-May/012041.html

Later in that second thread someone also mentioned the following; I think other people have also made similar requests/suggestions:

"I guess implementing topology rules and visualizing the existing errors would be a way to identify and correct problems like polygon overlapping.  It might already exist some code."

This second idea would probably require more research and thinking about exactly what to do.  

I think both these ideas are complementary, and could perhaps be done in a single project.  But I guess they are also features that might be able to attract other sponsors - you might think it is better to use Google money to do something which is unlikely to get sponsorship otherwise.

Regards,
Alister


Somebody started working on a plugin similar to this (early last year I think), but it didn't get very far.

I'm a +1 to Alisters ideas.  I think it would be good to have a full suite
of tools for manipulating vector objects and layers.  These tools should be
ports of fTools to C++ and live in the analysis lib so that they can be
used in C++, Python and UI (Carson and I have talked about this before).

I think this project would be good as it is tightly scoped and would be
easy to mange in chunks. Merging would also be easy, even merging as the
project moves along as each tool is independent.

Would should be careful not to start a GSoC project that is too large, has
wide scope, vague goals, or is to hard to mange in a summer.

Hi,
+1 for Alister ideas too!
I just finished a topological reference dataset for hydrology, and both
functionnalities would be have been wonderful . I had to switch a lot 
between GRASS, FME  and  postgis to build some geometries by hand (copy
obecjt in qgis, paste wkt in pgadmin, finish work using postgis functions,
updating in postgis.. ). 

Visualising topology errors could be generic, as we have two models for
topology: grass and postgis 2.0.. Or shouldn't we just focus on postgis as
the reference topology model for qgis , and let GRASS visualisation as it is
in GRASS UI. Is topology in Postgis a OGC standard?  
IMHO we should keep sticking to standards.. 

Regis

Hi Marco,

thanks for your help. Tried to get composer legend width using
rect().width() and always get 4.0 for different legends. In same
time seems that height is reported correctly. For tests I use
several layers with categorized legend and different number of
classes (from 2 to 40) and next code from Python console

r = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
c = QgsComposition( r )
c.setPlotStyle( QgsComposition.Print )
l = QgsComposerLegend( c )
l.model().setLayerSet( r.layerSet() )
print l.rect().width(), l.rect.height()

Any ideas what's wrong?

I fully agree. Porting the analysis code of fTools to the analysis lib 
would be a great gsoc project.

Hi again,

I could solve my problem. After commenting these three lines ECW file type
loaded successfully, however DEM file type will be shown in gray.

//  myLayer->setDrawingStyle( QgsRasterLayer::SingleBandPseudoColor );
//  myLayer->setColorShadingAlgorithm( QgsRasterLayer::PseudoColorShader );
//
myLayer->setContrastEnhancementAlgorithm(QgsContrastEnhancement::StretchToMinimumMaximum,
false );

hope this help somebody in future.

Cheers,

-Sam

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OS X 1.7.4... bomb
Message-ID: <0FCF111E-A7EC-4012-8CC0-BD3F7899D378@kyngchaos.com>

So I finally packaged QGIS 1.7.4 (I was waiting on a GRASS 6.4.2 problem, but that may take a while).  And...

WARNING #1: serious Qt packaging bug

Nokia screwed up compiling their "official" binaries.  Everything BUT QtWebKit works on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  QtWebKit appears to use a OS X 10.7-only system function.  This breaks QGIS help and some plugins on OS X 10.6.

It's possible it's not really Nokia's fault.  I'll have to compile Qt myself and package a new QGIS, but there is a bug in Apple's SDK mechanism that could be the problem.

WARNING #2: delete existing plugins before running QGIS 1.7.4.  If you can do it before installing QGIS, disable them in the old QGIS, then update and re-enable them one at a time after upgrading QGIS.  If you have already installed 1.7.4, you need to manually delete them from ~/.qgis/python/plugins.

I've had a report of plugins directly using a specific GDAL version like 1.8 (I don't know how this is possible), which will crash QGIS 1.7.4 which uses GDAL 1.9.  There also appears to be a problem with PyQwt so the profile plugin will crash QGIS.


Sorry for the breakage.  I'll try to fix things as quickly as I can.

GUI digitizer is broken - you can't stop digitizing a line.  Similar problem appeared in GRASS 7 but was fixed.

GDALTools perhaps, as I recall on Mac often times the path to GDAL has
to be manually set and on upgrade could easily still refer to the old
version in it's settings. Does manually editing the setting before
trying to run a Raster tool solve the issue? (Please pass that on to

One culprit I have seen with Python is that the `*.py` files will be
updated, but a set of old bytecode-compiled `*.pyc` files will be hanging
around somewhere on the PYTHONPATH. The interpreter will prefer these files
and get stuck using an older version of the plugin until they are removed.

On these two machines...

* Hackintosh laptop, with clean OS X 10.7.3 install (last week), with
Qt open source 4.8.0 and PyQt 4.9.1

* Mac Pro, upgraded from 10.6.8 to 10.7.2, with no Qt or PyQt installed

(both have had your latest GDAL 1.9.0 and QGIS 1.7.4-1 installed, today)

QtWebKit widgets don't show any HTML content in plugins (like you
would expect in 10.6.x). I don't get any errors, though, via QGIS's
python or in Mac's Console.app. I did clean (re)installs of plugins
being tested, as well.

Hopefully, Nokia fixes this issue with an update soon.


BTW, thank you VERY much for including the QGIS Server again. I tested
it on the Mac Pro setup and it worked fine, excepting the issue with
GetMap image/jpeg returning 500 internal server error (image/png
returns requested map). Not sure what's going on there, because I
thought that error recently went away with 1_7_4RC and master. Maybe
it was working with my source builds. Will do more testing on the
issue...

I had the same problem trying to compile Qt 4.8 on OS X 10.5.8. QtWebKit 
does not build (compiler error because of reference to 10.7 function) 
and QGIS needs Webkit.
How did you solve the problem? Disable the help menu?

Marco

Haven't solved it yet i QGIS compiles and runs, you just can't open any help.  I'm setting up a spare 10.6 Mac to compile Qt from source so it shouldn't reference anything from 10.7.  Odd that you'd get a 10.7 reference compiling on 10.5, time warp?

I think this might explain why Marco's compiling was referencing 10.7
components:

Sorry, I meant when compiling Qt on 10.5, that it would be odd to get a reference to a future OS version.  I realized right after sending that he meant compiling QGIS with the stock Qt.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible funded QGIS development
Message-ID: <1330220246.88454.YahooMailClassic@web160706.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I figure someone here might be interested in some paid QGIS development... no promises, but it seems very likely.

Essentially I'm looking for a customised version of QGIS, which is reasonably easily maintained & kept up to date with core QGIS development.

A simplified tool, with no analytical or editing capabilities, but with a custom plugin or two.

The organisation I work for is developing a set of WMS & WFS services as a data delivery capability. The new tool is to be a simple desktop mapping application able to access and interact with these data, as well as with the user's local data. 

The extra functionality/plugins include:

1. harvesting a list of WMS/WFS services from a CSW service to be cached locally. The user can enter the CSW URL, retrieve the WMS/WFS service URL's from this & store them locally. Also enter new ones manually.

2. Upon the user selecting a service from the local list, display the available layers (via capabilities document) just as the current QGIS WMS/WFS capabilities work.

3. Provide the ability to cache/harvest WMS & WFS service data layers locally, for later offline use. I believe ogr2ogr can do this from v1.8 for WFS, some relatively crude WMS caching will be needed, but obviously for large datasets, the high res data cannot be cached for the entire dataset. Even just the "save as image" facility for a specified layer may be adequate as a first cut, given a world file is saved with it, with the option to grab & save the 8 screens around the current extent like tiles, or perhaps one large image.

4. Allow users to display their own data overlaid on these datasets (whether live web service or locally cached). If online, the user should be able to select whether cached or remote data is used.

Some level of branding will be required for the funding agencies. I figure it might be useful to brand this something like Xxxx Quantum Map (Xxxx QMAP), to retain the Quantum brand, but emphasise the mapping rather the GIS capability, but this is totally up for discussion.


I figure QGIS provides an ideal basis for such an application, & I'd like to work with existing QGIS developers to do this if possible. We have no issues with the plugins being developed in a generic way, under an open licence & being available via the standard repositories. Indeed, we see the fully functional QGIS application as a standard "upgrade" for users who outgrow this application & seek to be able to do more than just view their data. I do have an indicative price from a local FOSS development company, but would like this to involve the QGIS development community if possible.

One other note: we are also looking to provide extensive climate and hydrometric data via SOS, so as a stage 2 of this development, it is very likely that we'll be interested in supporting the (further) development of an SOS client some time in the future.



Can anyone interested please reply & if there is enough background here, provide a rough estimate of the cost to build this?


Thanks,

?? Brent Wood

Sure, you are welcome to apply for a summer project (given that OSGeo
will be accepted and thus QGIS will participate under its umbrella).

Keep an eye on the wiki page with ideas - I am sure that more ideas
will be coming in following weeks. Of course you are free to come up
with your own ideas for a project - at the end it is always better
when you work on something you really care about, right? :)

Nathan,

fTools should probably experience some core/gui decoupling first - I
remember the individual tools contained a mixture of algorithm logic
and gui stuff handling (progress bar etc). After that, the tools
should ideally implement a common interface, to allow easy running of
the tools from API (instead of having to use slightly different calls
for each tool). For that we need a simple processing framework -
during last year's GSoC such framework has been developed as a side
effect - but it still lacks various important things such as: show job
progress, cancel running job or asynchronous job execution. Therefore
a summer project could involve adding missing functionality, porting
from python to c++ for inclusion in qgis_analysis library and possibly
adding few modules from fTools to demonstrate the capabilities.

Or maybe you did mean compiling Qt from source.  But I didn't see any problem in what that qtcentre forum thread mentioned - the referenced pro file does not force a source file for later system version, it starts from the lower versions and works up.

Anyways - I compiled Qt on 10.6 (just to be sure the Lion SDK bug doesn't bite) and all is OK with QtWebKit.

New package online for OS X QGIS 1.7.4.  I compiled Qt 4.8 from source and the QtWebKit bug is gone.

There is still a problem with PyQwt.  I don't think it works with PyQt 4.9.  Qwt works.  Odd because I thought it was working in January.

It looks like PyQwt is basically dead - the last changes were for a 5.2.1 release that never happened, and there are no plans to support Qwt 6 as far as I can tell.

(PyQt 4.9 is needed to support Qt 4.8.  Qt 4.8 is needed to support OS X 10.7.)

Hi William

Yes, I got a compile error with Qt (not QGIS). The error looked like 
that one:

http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/47207-Missing-files-when-building-Qt-4-8-mac-against-10-5

But maybe editing the .pro file works also here. Going to try that tonight.

Marco

As I can see some algorithms already ported to C++, see QgsGeometryAnalyzer
class. But currently this implementation don't uses threads and memory
layers.

Hmm... If I remember correctly, when Processing Framework project
was started we also have discussion which language to use Python or
C++. And decision was to use Python...

Anyway, I agree that porting fTools to analysis lib with or without processing
framework will be great.

Hi all,

I'm a new comer on Quantum gis.
At first look, it's sound good for me.

1/ I would like to know if some of you have already load ASTER GDEM datas.
(available on http://www.gdem.aster.ersdac.or.jp/search.jsp )

2/ I would like to integrate Qgis in my own QWidget using QtCreator. Is it possible?
Where can I found some documentation about Qgis Qt lib?


Regards,
Olivier.

I think the goal was to use Python to get the design fleshed out and
running, with the idea to port it to C++ in the future.

Yes. Any specific questions ?

Here is the doxygen API for QGIS, these function can be used with Qt 
C++ or PyQt :
http://qgis.org/api/

Btw, the online doxygen version is at 1.5.6, an update to 1.7.x would 
be great as the default template now comes with nice things like search 
auto-completion.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPCWpjq4-AzV72B9+voLc9vF2wGzo3SwAhqBS_6okQu+ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

just tested SpatiaLite DB in QGIS and found that allmost all geoprocessing
tools don't work with SpatiaLite layers: some of them crashes QGIS [0] while
other returns empty datasets. When SpatiaLite layer exported to shapefile,
all geoprocessing operations returns correct results.

This is very annoying bug, because currently SpatiaLite is much faster on
large complex datasets both in loading and renedering than shapefiles.

Should I file ticket or this is known issue with SpatiaLite provider?

You need to set the color ramp, have a look to the manual (p.86 in the 
fr version). There also is a plugin called 1-band raster which can 
generates one with predefined paramaters, you can also use gdaldem from 
the raster menu. you can also read tim's linfiniti blog ->

I'm not a windows/Qt creator user so I'll let someone else reply for 
this one, qgis is shipped with its lib which class/functions can be 
called without recompilation.

I can confirm QtWebKit is working fine with your 1.7.4-2 build, both
on 10.7.3 and 10.6.8, on all my Macs, regardless of installed (or no)
system Qt SDK version. Thank you for getting this to work.

The problem I had while testing the QtWebKit function of some QGIS
plugins was how the loading of a local file URL was coded.

This worked under Qt 4.7.4, but fails with a blank page, due to lack
of a protocol, on 4.8.0:

self.helpviewer.setUrl(QUrl(
    os.path.join(plugin_dir, "html", "help.html")))

It needs to have the file:// protocol expressly added:

self.helpviewer.setUrl(QUrl(
    "file://%s"
    % (os.path.join(plugin_dir, "html", "help.html"))))

This error is present in some currently distributed QGIS plugins. The
resultant blank web pages made me think your builds weren't working. I
could find no documentation of this change at Qt's site.


I'd like to compile nightly builds of QGIS under Snow Leopard, was
there anything you edited or changed when compiling Qt 4.8.0 to get
WebKit to work?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Patch : QGIS Server Web Feature Service
	capabilities
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO5m-iJcPz+OeWM-SPA5XLVT3cRqm5E-jGxpBupFuarDbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

Ren?-Luc D'Hont (my colleague) has just asked me to add a redmine issue
with his patch :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5094

Description

Adding the Web Feature Service capabilities Version 1.0.0 to QGIS Server.
The WFS service will then be able to answer the following requests :
    GetCapabilities, which provides the WFS Service capabilities
    DescribeFeatureType, which provides the XML features schema
    GetFeature, which provides the features

The request GetFeature accepts parameters to filter features :
    BBOX, a bounding box in the features SRS
    FEATUREID, a feature id
    FILTER, a filter in Filter Encoding 1.0

The request GetFeature provides the feature in an XML format, GML2.

The WFS service (GetCapapbilities and GetFeature) has been tested with
QGIS. The GetFeature output formats have been tested with OpenLayers (GML2
and GeoJSON).
2 patches are proposed in this redmine issue :
    one for the trunk and branch 1.8
    one for the 1.7

Each patch
    adds a public method to get QgsGeometry in GeoJSON format
    adds WFS 1.0.0 service capabilities to QGIS Server
    extends WFS 1.0.0 service capabilities with GeoJSON output format.


Feel free to test and report.

Michael

Hi again,

seems it is impossible to get real width and height of the legend
until composition is not rendered. When legend added to composition
it always reports width == 4.0 and some height (different for different
layersets). And only after rendering composition I can get real legend
width and height.

Maybe there is some trick to get this info without rendering composition?

Thanks

That's right. Personally I find it much easier to prototype API in
Python and then move it to C++. Like this it is possible save a lot of
development time when designing and doing lots of modifications in API
- typing, compiling, fixing compilation errors, synchronizing .h and
.cpp files etc.

Hi Alex

It might be possible to get the legend size by calling the method 
QgsComposerLegend::paintAndDetermineSize with a 0 pointer as argument to 
get the size:

/**Paints the legend and calculates its size. If painter is 0, only size 
is calculated*/
     QSizeF paintAndDetermineSize( QPainter* painter );

Regards,
Marco

Though the no-prefix-install option seems to be a bit off (still compiling to verify).  When prefix-install is disabled, Qt installs in OSX paths, like the binary downloads - /Developer and Frameworks.  But the framework path appears to be /Libraries/Frameworks, not /Library/Frameworks.

Most of them were inside of pdf, some of them were fonts. Copy and Paste
was mostly what was needed. A little more work would need to be done to
get the fill parameter working.

Hi all,

I could not find any signal emitted when the current layer of the map

I only found the currentlayer() function in mapCanvas and nothing in the 
legendInterface.

Did I miss something, is there a lack or is there a reason for this?

Hi all.
When calculating the area of polygons with the field calculator, the units are those
of the current projection. This is pointless in case of degrees (e.g. EPSG:4326). Of
course one can reproject the layer, but it would be good to be able to choose the
unit during calculations.
Opinions?

I suppose it uses layer's units rather then projection units.

we've  added  calculation  of  ellipsoidal areas as
well as projected ones (using project CRS) to fTools recently.

Along the same lines ultimately, it would be nice if operators from geometry group ($area,
$perimeter...etc)   are accompanied with $area_ellps,  $area_prj,
$perimeter_ellps, $x_prj...etc.

Message-ID: <4F4CB01E.8050001@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Loading a raster is in certain conditions unacceptably slow, and as we have seen this
is largely due to stats collections. At least for GRASS rasters, gdal knows he cannot
compute stats; e.g. in R:

Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 1.8.1, released 2011/07/09
Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal/1.8
Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.7.1, 23 September 2009, [PJ_VERSION: 470]
Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected)
Warning message:
statistics not supported by this driver

Is it possible that QGIS is trying to calculate stats, and this is a reason for the
slowdown?
All the best.

I think you can still use it, disabling the stretch.
But we obviously have a problem here.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Menu contet
Message-ID: <4F4CBEEE.6010401@lanet.lv>

Hi,

Is it possible without changing the source to modify menu content (QGIS 
1.9.90)? The item "Project properties" is locates under " Files". I want 
to access the project properties under "Settings" menu as well.

Thank you,
Karlis

thanks, that solved the problem for me now.
a more comprehensive solution would be nice.

Right currently stretching is off by default. But collecting stats
is necessary not only for stretching. For example some plugins
needs raster statistics for their work.

Yes, but with stretch off all greyscales are flat, so most users set it to stretch or
clip & stretch.
There is room for improvement here.
All the best.

 Hi,

 The location of the "Project properties" in the menu depends on the 
 platform. On Windows it is under settings. On OSX I think it is on the 
 very left menu. On Linux KDE it is under settings like in Windows, on 
 Gnome it is in File menu.

 I know that you can extend the menu with Python. I don't know if you 
 can also reorder the menu. But people are discouraged to reorganized 
 standard menus.

I have built it from source under Xfce. The previous QGIS versions uses 
the same menu layout as for MS Windows or KDE. Now this has been changed :(

are you talking about approximated stats, isn't it? Because in this moment
the QgsRasterProvider compute full stats only, so the process can require
a lot of time.

In addition, I think we should re-style the piece of the raster Layer Property
dialog to set min/max (I know there's a ticket yet):

- the checkboxs are not checked whenever at least one should be,

- "Estimated (faster)" compute only approximated max/min, instead "Actual
(slower)" compute full stats (why? shouldn't compute min/max either)?

- the "Load" button is far away from the checkboxes (I thought them was
unrelated).

Werner,

As far as I can see,
#4567 Fix Union tool to produce correct attribute table
has not been fixed despite the claim in
http://www.qgis.org/en/about-qgis/qgis-releases.html
1. On ubuntu, I get an empty table including the fields of both layers
(i.e, id for one and id_2 for the other)
2. On windows, the table is populated, but the fields are not merged
(i.e, id for one and id_2 for the other),

Should I reopen #4567 ?
Could some body else verify?
This is the kind of error users must be warned about

(btw, "Merge Shapefiles to one" works fine on ubuntu 10.04, but not on windows)

I agree with Giuseppe, stats by default should be calculated in at
most 5% of pixels,
although there should be a tool to calculate full stats and save them.
A random 5% sample is actually a better estimate of the real min,max,
because most of the time
you do not hit outliers because they a re rare by definition.

Is it possible to force the menu structure to be the same on any 
available desktop? Now KDE is the only one were "Project Properties" are 
placed in "Settings" menu. In other deksktops (Xfce, xmonad, IceVM, 
LXDE)  it is placed  in "File" menu :(

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Remove Feature
Message-ID: <CALQBTK-F5UeiuWqYm_h5YAD5BP8QNOaZQP6uSNfiSiMapgHZgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm coding a plugin in python and I would like to understand what
append during this:
    self._layer.dataProvider().deleteFeatures([v.id() for v in
self._object_map.itervalues()])
and
    self._layer.dataProvider().addFeatures([v for v in
self._object_map.itervalues()])
because features are not delete...

So... I get a look in the C++ code.. here is what I've found in
src/core/qgsvectordataprovider.cpp.
    bool QgsVectorDataProvider::addFeatures( QgsFeatureList &flist )
    {
       Q_UNUSED( flist );
       return false;
    }

    bool QgsVectorDataProvider::deleteFeatures( const QgsFeatureIds &ids )
    {
       Q_UNUSED( ids );
       return false;
    }


Well... the data provider do not seems to do anything really useful...

So I get a look to the QgsVectorLayer:

Code: Select all
    bool QgsVectorLayer::addFeature( QgsFeature& f, bool alsoUpdateExtent )
    {
      // does a lot of things
    }


So here is my questions:

    * My python code hat use the data provider "work" as expected (it
display something) but if I do this:
        self._layer.addFeatures([v for v in self._object_map.itervalues()])
    it do not work (do not display anything).
    Why ??

    * The deleteFeature do not seems to work neither on the data
provider nor on the layer... why ? Is it a bug ?

    * What am I missing, or doing wrong ?

By the way, I also check the code on SVN, (qgsvectorlayer v15857 and
qgsvectordataprovider v15197) and the code is similar to the one on
doxygen.

probably hit&runs will be more of a harm for us than a good, as integrating and
maintaining their code can be a pain.
BTW, I am searching for a solution to this problem since long, but I never found
something really simple (so that overhead are not more than the actual coding work)
and reliable (so that both payers and devs can feel comfortable). Anyone has good
experiences to share?
All the best.

If I load a SL layer from the browser (from the files list, not from the SL submenu),
the layer is loaded, and can be exported, but is not displayed: anyone confirms?

+1 for random % (even better if parametrizable)

I don't confirm. It works for me with both GDAL 1.9.0 and GDAL trunk, at least 
on the simple example that I've sent to Paolo.

Does anyone have any plans to add support for layer import into PostGIS
databases in the QBrowser.  Like we currently have for SpataiLite.

You can use DB Manager for this. We aim at making it core ASAP.
Please let us know if it fits.

Yeah I have tried the DBManger, although it seems to require third party
Python libs to get Python support.

I think for constancy, and a non plugin way, it would be good to have
import in the QBrowser.

Yes, python-psycopg2 (included in osgeo4w and all major Linux distros).
We have many functionalities in core py plugins (e.g. GDALTools), I do not see a
problem here.

I was not aware python-psycopg2 was in osgeo4w. That does make things
better.

Still think drag and drop support in QBrowser would be good.

On windows XP PRO the QGIS browser does not recognized test-2.3.sqlite 
as a map. QGIS adds this file as SpatiaLite layers without any problems.
(OSGeo4W QGIS version 1.9.90-Alpha / 371d7fe; GDAL/OGR Version
1.8.1; SpatiaLite Version 2.4.0)

On Fedora 14?64 it works as expected. No problems recognized.
(QGIS version 1.9.90-Alpha / 927dcbd (self compiled); GDAL/OGR Version 
1.7.3; SpatiaLite Version 2.4.0)

The domain has expired by a mistake. It should be online in few days -
however the repository is not going to receive further updates -
plugins.qgis.org is the place where plugins should go.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Offset curve tool
Message-ID: <4F4DF9DF.1080809@sourcepole.ch>

Hi all

There is a new editing tool in the master branch.
The offset curve tool creates parallel shifts of linestrings and polygon 
rings ( single sided buffers with the geos function 
GEOSSingleSidedBuffer ). The tool can be applied to the edited layer 
(the geometries are modified) or also to background layers (creates 
copies of the lines / rings and adds it to the the edited layer). It is 
thus ideally suited for the creation of distance line layers.

Let me know about issues, suggestions, comments.

The work was kindly funded by the city of Uster (Switzerland).

Regards,
Marco

A suggestion I would have is to not put the Offset spin box in the status
bar area.  IMO it would be better in a floating dialog like the measure
tool.  This would allow more options, or info, to be added to the tool
later.

Also if editing the value doesn't change the result of the tool I would
think it would be good as read-only. I tried to edit it in order to order
to supply a offset of 3 and nothing happened.

Note that GEOSSingleSidedBuffer was deprecated in 3.3.0 in favor
of the GEOSOffsetCurve function. To be honest I dubt it'll ever
be really dropped, but I'd recomend using the new API nonetheless
(when available). Only difference in API is that GEOSOffsetCurve
deduces side by sign of distance (positive means left, negative
means right).

On Mac OS and Windows, the spin box is placed next to the cursor and 
moves with it. On X11, I had to disable that because there is a problem 
embedding widget items if the flag Qt::WA_PaintOnScreen is set on the 
canvas.
But yes, it might be better to have a separate window on X11.

 >Also if editing the value doesn't change the result of the tool I

It is intended that editing changes the result. After pressing the 
return key, the offset line should move to the new distance (but the 
mouse should not be moved, otherwise it will be overriden by the 
following mouse move position). Doesn't this work for you?

Regards,
Marco

Ahh this makes sense.  Having the tool follow the mouse cursor is something
that I was thinking about trying with some other tools, now I have
something to model that off.  Bugger about the bug on X11, in that case it
would be best to have a window.

Is it possible to do a frameless modeless dialog with the widget inside and
have it follow the cursor?  Or does this have the same issue.

Message-ID: <70b080b7e5329eb5b9191dcf6d2de0d3@carto.net>

 Hi,

 Every once in a while I get a dll version conflict when starting QGIS. 
 Seems like Windows has a newer version of libeay32.dll in 
 \winnt\system32 whereas OSGeo4W has a different (older?) version in 
 C:\Programme\OSGeo4W\bin

 Anybody knows why there is this version conflict? The system wide 
 libeay32.dll - does it have priority over the one in OSGeo4W? Or is 
 there some setting I can use?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

That could work, afaik only QGraphicsProxyWidgets are affected. If the 
widget is on top of the graphics scene, there should be no problem.

On the other hand, having a floating widget (like measuring tools) would 
allow to present the options which are now in the digitizing tab of the 
options dialog. So I'm thinking about implementing it that way.

Marco

Hi Marco,

I noticed a bug and Qgis crashes.

Here is a video http://youtu.be/DBbMg5rO8fU

The geometry of the line I played with is:

LINESTRING(554235.01669295 145547.73137862,554242.99020772 
145548.76938867,554245.33776182 145545.30016923,554245.49416371 
145544.76210759)

Greetings,

Denis

Hi Denis

In certain cases, geos trunk throws an exception (version 3.2 crashes):

ERROR 1: IllegalArgumentException: RobustDeterminant encountered 
non-finite numbers

I noticed it happens often with lines with dense vertex distributions 
(e.g. segmented curves). Maybe Sandro (strk) knows more about the details?

Marco

Seems possible, as the bug appears when one segment of the line is 
getting very very small.

Hi again,

As there are three settings for this tool in the digitizing tab, I 
suggest to have a distinct category: just write Curve offset as a title 
and indent the 3 settings, as this is for the rest of the tab. What do 
you think?

There is a small typo: Mitre in the combobox and Miter in the label.

It's also non evident to understand what these settings do.

Regards,

Denis

The DLL doesn't belong to Windows, but to some other software that also uses
OpenSSL and put the DLL there.

Unfortunately the system32 directory has priority and is processed before PATH
is searched (see also [1]).  AFAIK the only way is to (re)move the DLL from
system32 or to put the OSGeo4W version into each osgeo4w directory where
executables that load it are.

Hi all.
From: http://demo.3liz.fr/ the link: http://178.32.101.237/qgismapserver/
does not seem to be working properly.
In general, it would be good to have a working demo to be linked from the plugin
page: http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lizmapwebclient
Merci bien.

Hi Paolo,

Hum, I have to change the apache configuration of demo.3liz.fr . People are
not supposed to read the content...

Lizmap Web Application demo link is in the wiki here :
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lizmapwebclient/wiki#Demonstration

It is :
http://178.32.101.237/lizmap/index.php/view/map/?project=montpellier

I will add this link in the presentation here :
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/lizmapwebclient

Cheers,

Michael

All I know is I turned it into an EXCEPTION.
Was entering an infinite loop before.
A good start is catching the exception...
If you feel you could also file a ticket on trac.osgeo.org/geos
with a description of the issue and a link to the video.
It's intereting to see how to _obtain_ infinite values during
computation of the offset curve.

I also reproduce the error with the test-2.3 database. The difference with the 
poly.sqlite that I sent before is that test-2.3 contains no spatial index.

The console has interesting error messages :

ERROR 1: In ResetStatement(): sqlite3_prepare(SELECT _rowid_, * FROM 'Towns' 
WHERE MBRIntersects("Geometry", BuildMBR(-213552396.323174118996, 
-167417043.364000141621, 215180205.733174085617, 176566090.844000160694, 
32632))):
  no such function: BuildMBR

I'd note that you get the same behaviour when opening from "Open a Vector 
Layer" (which uses the OGR driver)

What is more interesting is that the same request run from ogrinfo works 
perfectly....

I'm afraid the reason why it does not work in QGIS is that it has the bad idea 
of embedding directly libspatialite in /usr/lib/libqgis_core.so.1.9.90 instead 
of dynamically linking to the one provided by the system. So I highly suspect 
a conflict between the libspatialite linked by libgdal.so and the one linked by 
libqgis_core, especially if they are not the same version ....

Another point is  that the QGIS File Browser only displays the first OGR layer, 
whereas when opening with "Open a Vector Layer", you can choose among all OGR 
layers.

Hi all, just to let you know that I implemented pinch zooming, fixed 
some minor stuff and created alpha7. all details here:
