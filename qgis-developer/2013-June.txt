Hi Etienne,

Thank you very much for your help!

I usually do not compile directly, I use the alternative of creating .deb packages with dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -d -j4

In fact, it can be a local problem, maybe with some update, because it began to happen in the past weekend.

To test, I did a clean install on a virtual machine and it passes the 48%, even after applying all updates, but gives error at 83%...

Hi,

Users of TimeManager have been reporting issues, which I think we trapped
down to empty fieldmap objects.

https://github.com/anitagraser/TimeManager/issues/39#issuecomment-18790341

On both my Win7 and Ubuntu systems, I cannot reproduce the problem. Have
you seen anything like this before and know how to fix it?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

I checked the queue and cleaned it as much as possible.

There is a small list of tickets that probably can be closed(*), but
the other 71 are pretty much confirmed (almost all regressions). There
is a bit of everything, big issues with edit tools, wfs client, ftools
(many with memory leaks), printing, etc.

Hi

I still cannot configure a repository for this project on hub.qgis.org

When running git remote -v I get:

ricardo at portatil:~/.qgis2/python/plugins/coneforinputs$ git remote -v
origin    gitosis at qgis.org:coneforinputs.git (fetch)
origin    gitosis at qgis.org:coneforinputs.git (push)

I think this is the expected result.

I've added myself as a developer on the project's settings. And configured
git to be the SCM.
When accessing the 'Repository' tab on redmine I am shown a page that says:

Repository does not exist. Create one using the instructions below.
...

Following the instructions, I've added my SSH public key again (and again)
to my redmine profile. I've tried various combinations appending my e-mail
address to it and not. The result is always the same. git asks me for a
passowrd when I try to git push to the remote and then fails with
permission denied.

What could be the problem?

Hi

Thanks very much Giovanni. We are holding a PSC meeting tomorrow to
plan the release strategy and your revisions will come in handy for
that.

Glad to hear you guys will meet on the 2.0 release. In the hope it can help
your meeting, I'd like to share my 2 cents as a QGIS evangelist in
Southeast Asia. Note, I'm running on QGIS master, so the argument below
isn't out of self-interest ;o)

In the beginning of March 2013, Tim announced a proposed release schedule
over the mailing list [1] which stated June 7, 2012 as date of release.
Developers generally agreed around this schedule and process moved forward.
In the meantime, QGIS end users and evangelists who keep track of
development were left with a general sense of mid-2013 as QGIS 2.0 release,
with all its glorious new features and fixes.

When doing workshops, presentation on QGIS  and discussing about it, "by
end of June" was the best answer I - and surely many other QGIS evangelists
praising QGIS out there - could give to people both excited about what's
coming.

But more importantly, this was a tentative dates when technical limitations
and issues would be dealt with when planning forward. For e.g. in Southeast
Asia, the broken state of Unicode shapefile encoding in QGIS 1.8 got many
people to think twice about adoption. These issues were balanced out with
an estimated date of delivery for 2.0 and plans have been drawn for QGIS
adoptions in NGOs, ministries, public offices, etc.

And this brings us to now. It seems inevitable that QGIS will have to be
delayed. IMO, QGIS must insure the delay is as short as possible, to avoid
negative impact on current end users expecting new features and issues
fixed, as well as not being an obstacle to further adoption by missing an
important deadline.

Beyond the 80+ blockers currently listed, which could be dealt with in
relatively short amount of time and focus, a SIP upgrade proposal is the
other main "delayer". The argument for a delay to include the SIP upgrade
is that, since the needed new vector API broke the plugins, and the SIP
upgrade would also break plugins, the two should occur at the same time not
to piss off plugin developers with too many breakages along the line.
That's a valid argument, no question there, but shouldn?t be the only
weighting factor, nor should it open the door to an absence of hard
deadlines.

I feel that for the SIP upgrade to be considered so late in the release
process, it should be considered within _reasonable confines_ to avoid
un-managed, harmful delays. Ideally, something along the lines of "merged
by this coming Sunday or delayed to post 2.0". If the attempt at upgrading
SIP is turning out to be more complex and take longer than a hard
commit-to-master deadline, it IMO should be postponed on practical grounds
of avoiding impact on QGIS end users and adoption.

Alright, I don't claim having a perfect understanding of the bigger picture
at play here, and I'm not intimately familiar with the source code, so
disregard what's not proper. :) Still hope the above point of view, from a
person trying to push for more QGIS adoption, can be of help.

Regards

Mathieu

This is the current plan.  Victor is working on updating sextante this
week, and Alex is working on fTools, noone has put their hands up for the
others (DBManger, mapserver export) yet but I will try my hand at them if I
get time.

The SIP update must happen now or it can't happen in the future without
breaking everything yet again, and that will do more damage to the project
then some slight breakages in plugins while they update to 2.0.  The SIP
update is a easy one, for the core code base and plugin authors, and I only
have to check one thing with Martin before I will merge it into master
(after most of the core plugins are done).

A password will never work, so don't bother trying that. Based on the 
information you've provided we will go into the server config and check 
if the permissions were properly added from Redmine to gitosis.

Hi all.
It would be nice to add symbol sets to the default distribution, e.g.
http://blog.gvsig.org/2013/06/03/gvsig-2-0-forestry-symbol-library/
http://gfoss.it/drupal/simboli (trees, geology, etc.).
Anyone objects?
All the best.

Hi,

maybe also make sence to add this symbols [0] too? Package includes
SVG symbols and large set of the QGIS styles and useful for creating
topographic maps.

Hi all,

I just noticed that quick search now missed from attribute table and I need
to open Query Builder and create expression even if I want simply to find
feature using only one field and zoom to it. IMO this is very common usecase.

Seems this happens after merging dual-view stuff. Any reason for this removal?
Is it possible to put quick search field back?

Thanks

Hi,

I would object to add more SVG symbols until we have a proper
infrastructure in place that would allow to add certain topics/themes
of symbols.

Adding lots of SVG symbols slows down QGIS considerably.

It would be better to have a website or repository where people can
have a preview of the symbols and download zip-files (as a first
step). If they like the symbols it is very easy to extract the
zip-file and make it available in the symbol path.

Adding tons of symbols slows down QGIS for all people - which is bad,
considering that people usually only need a small number of symbols.

Isn't there a GSOC project that will work on a SVG symbol repository?
If yes - I would propose to wait until this project finishes and then
work to add more symbols.

Andreas

Yes there is.  Arun is working on that this year, continuing his work from
last year.  I will be his mentor this summer (positions open for a
co-mentor)

Hi,

ok - good. I would be available to discuss things and test the work.

I would propose to delay adding more SVG symbols to the main QGIS
project until Arun's work is done (QGIS 2.1 or 2.0x) and users can
selectively check out certain symbol groups/topics.

Having symbols immediately at hand is not critical for QGIS adoption and
adding symbols manually is relatively easy.

Hi,


JNCC's 'Phase 1' colour mapping and symbology
palettes are used in the UK. These can be found via links from:
?http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4258



Worth considering for QGIS users based
in the UK?

Hi,

maybe also make sence to add this symbols [0] too? Package includes
SVG symbols and large set of the QGIS styles and useful for creating
topographic maps.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SRS DB maintenance
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYrt+TUOr4yLcWrMJ45yW88-wcX=Y026GLaUab4Ahro4ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Could somebody clarify how the crs.db is maintained? I am a bit lost. There are:
- scripts/qgis_srs.sh - it seems that it was used for initial import
to resources/srs.db but it is not used anymore?
- scripts/postprocess_srs.sql - it was probably called once after
scripts/qgis_srs.sh but it is not used anymore?
- resources/srs.db - occasionally updated add hoc by hand correcting
wrong params or adding missing EPSG
- src/crssync/main.cpp which calls
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::syncDb() and updates resources/srs.db
during compilation with latest CRS from GDAL

If I got it, the srs.db was created once by qgis_srs.sh and
postprocess_srs.sql, now it is maintained by hand but also
automatically updated (records are overwritten!?) by data from GDAL
during compilation, right?

If it really works like that, it seams to me that:
- the result is a mix of CRS from various sources which are
difficult/impossible to trace down
- the changes applied to resources/srs.db may be overwritten by data from GDAL

My question/proposal: should not it all work vice versa? I.e. fill an
empty srs.db with the latest data from GDAL first and then to add the
missing projections/params? All the additional projections added by
QGIS should be maintained in a readable text file (not in an sqlite
binary).

I proposed something similar some time ago [0], but this was rejected after
discussion. Maybe now this proposal will have more sence.

And on package install - to match the local GDAL and probably proj.4. IIRC only
the existing entries get updated and none gets deleted or added.

No sure, in the past nobody was actually really capable of maintaining that
database.  People usually tend to known only the few projections they use and
hardly can judge projections others supply.   Moreover there were issues with
CRS coming from GDAL/OGR when the database didn't match their definition.

So "we" "outsourced" that to GDAL by introducing crssync.

But in fact, at this moment, we do maintain 3906 records in tbl_srs in
resources/srs.db and occasionally we add requested missing records but
it is difficult to trace down what/why/when was changed and it is not
clear which records from resources/srs.db are necessary addition to
GDAL and what is just duplication.

If we decide to fully rely on GDAL we should do it 100%, that means we
should delete everything from resources/srs.db but that means that
QGIS becomes suddenly unusable for people who contributed missing CRS
to QGIS but not to GDAL.

I don't say that we should maintain the whole database but we should
have an option to add what is missing. My suggestion is to fill empty
srs.db by data from GDAL during compilation/installation and then add
missing CRS from a text file. The initial version of the file with
additional CRS could be created as difference of current
resources/srs.db and GDAL if it gives reasonable data (not too many
records).

it would be nice that svg library should be available as for cpt-city
gradients for color ramp manager plugin.
it's up to user to decide to use base library or to download more.

OK, in that case let us throw away everything from srs.db. What I am
worrying about is that GDAL developers will be reluctant to accept new
CRS. It took years to convince Frank to add a single switch to krovak
projection without which it was completely unusable in GIS
applications.

At least it makes confusion.

I was suggesting to overwrite the data from GDAL if necessary (towgs84
missing/wrong in GDAL), but it is problematic to decide which value is
better.

Which cases exactly? Are there important the values we added manually
to the srs.db or is it important to have full srs.db in cases when
GDAL data are not available or crssync cannot be run?

Well, still it is not clear to me if we maintain something or not. My
impression is that we do it half way. Either don't keep any addition
in to CRS DB in QGIS at all or do it transparently.

sorry, I don't build .deb packages.

looks like your are missing the python-devel package or similar, or there
is a version mismatch in your python packages... (missing
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so)

We have produced a complete set of geological symbols [0] that follow
the american FDCG standard and the Italian CARG/ISPRA standard.
It would be nice to add them to the future repository.

The following core plugins do not load properly:

plugin_installer
GdalTools

Do the respective devs plan to fix this? I could help out a bit with
GdalTools, but I don't know anything about the plugin_installer plugin to
really help.

Cheers
Etienne

Either Nathan or me will care about the plugin installer (strictly speaking: 
about the new pyplugin_installer module, as the old plugin_installer plugin 
will be removed as soon as the new manager is reviewed by Marco and merged to 
master)

Yeah Borys or myself will take care of the plugin installer.  Marco is
going to review the C++ part of the installer and merge that into master.
Once that is done I will merge SIP v2 into master and update the plugin
installer. Matthias has a patch that he started for gdal tools.  I'm going
to merge that into sip update now and we can go from there.

Thanks to everyone for lending a hand.

The next task is handling this from a PR point of view.  As soon as we have
the update in master I'll put out a blog post on how to update plugins, if
you have a blog please do the same.  I know Victor was thinking of putting
together an update guide. If we could coordinate this effort it would be
good, so we can have one place to look for how to update a plugin.

Regards,
Nathan

I can lend a hand in testing gdaltools as well as ftools.

I had forgotten about the old plugin installer, no need to update it of
course...

great! It would be nice to have all information in one spot regarding
upgrade to qgis api 2.0 as well as sip api v2. There is already a wiki page
for qgis api 2.0, perhaps it could all go there and be linked from your
blog(s).

Maybe I'm wrong, bit there is no sense to upgrade Plugin installer as it will be
replaced by new one

Does the georeferencing plugin requires porting to new SIP version? If so
it should be put on radar asap, that's a pretty fundamental function.

No.  Only Python plugins need updating.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Regression in opening ArcGIS personal geodatabase
Message-ID: <1370331034567-5057647.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,
There is a regression between QGIS master 1.9.0-294 (00a9a7de) and 1.9.0-295
(24bffbf262) in opening ArcGIS personal geodatabase files (mdb). When I'm
trying to open file window for choosing layer popups but Number of features
isn't correct and after choosing layer it's apear in QGIS but nowhting is
shown. In properties there are fields but metadata are empty.

I think this is related with commit af0f61e6 (OGR provider - virtual
sublayers for each geometry type in 
multi geometry layers). 

Anyone can confirm that?

Win7 64 bit, QGIS master from OSGeo4W installer

Regards
Piotr

IMHO, this would put an additional burden (supporting Yet Another
standard), being at disadvantage with the proprietary equivalent,
without any possible advantage. An arms race among standards in which
we (and I believe the GFOSS world at large) would only have to lose.
If we agree with this, I believe we should raise our voice with OSGeo.
All the best.

Hi Etienne,

You were right, I created a symlink to the file /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so

ln -sf /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so

and it passed that stage.

But stopped again almost at the end:

sorry, I don't build .deb packages.

looks like your are missing the python-devel package or similar, or there is a version mismatch in your python packages... (missing /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server: about cache management of a layer in
	two different projects
Message-ID: <76139184bf3330080e4d4409e1562ea7@imap.gis3w.it>

Hi all,

I have a problem about cache management of different styles associadet
with a layer present in two, or more, different QGIS projects.

I see that the WMS results for this layers is the same for the two project
if the layers have the same id.

This for the control of the cache layer made by QGis Server:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/mapserver/qgsmslayercache.cpp

No problem if the layers have different id.


But in a classic workflow is possible that fot the preparation of a
project we start with a template project.
So, in this case, the layers of the template project have the same id in
all the derived projects.
If I change the associated style of one of this layers in a derived
projects I don't have change in the WMS result.


Anyone had the same problem and know the way to resolve it?

A solution may be the association layer id / project at Qgis Server level?

I have opened a tiket about it:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7956

thanks for comments
All the best.

Not sure if it helps, but maybe just disabling the cmake option 
WITH_APIDOC would overcome this. It's not necessary for a working 
binary.

Or a change of your workflow to create unique layer ids?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Open a form of a linked table
Message-ID: <51ADFD4A.6060709@carto.net>

Hi,

I have two tables with a 1:n to relation from table A to B.

In the form of table "B" I want to display a button that opens the
corresponding record in a form of table A (in a separate window).

I know that Matthias Kuhn is working on such functionality for QGIS 2.1
- but I would need a script-based solution now - this project cannot
wait for QGIS 2.1

Does someone have a python script that does something like that or
similar things?

The idea is to have a Python action with a few lines of code that does
this and can be associated to a button.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi ,

I did not test, but adding a python action to the layer B should work:

layerA = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayer("layerAid")

featureAid = [% "layerAid_column_name" %]

f = QgsFeature()

layerA.getFeatures(QgsFeatureRequest().setFilterFid(featureAid)).nextFeature(f)

iface.openFeatureForm(layerA, f)


If the layerA has no geometry, you might need to add NoGeometry as a 
flag to the feature request.

Also, you might need to test if f is found.

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Form widgets: decouple widget type from "hidden"
	or not
Message-ID: <51AE0466.5070809@carto.net>

Hi,

I have projects where I want to define a widget type (for QGIS web
client projects) but want to hide the field in QGIS desktop. I know - it
sounds strange, but it is a requirement.

I therefore want to discuss whether we could have a separate column next
to the WMS and WFS column, labeled "Desktop" with a checkbox that
defines if the field is visible in QGIS desktop or not.

Then we could still define a widget type (for QGIS web client) but hide
the field in QGIS desktop. We could then remove the "Hidden" widget
type, which isn't a widget anyway.

This is kind of similar to the "editable" status we introduced a couple
of weeks/months ago - where we initially had the separate "immutable"
widget type where only line input widgets were supported.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi

If I understand correctly, you want to show a different form in QGIS 
desktop and the QGIS web client.
I'm not familiar with the code that generates the forms for the web 
client, but reading your question, I guess that it generates it's form 
based on the definition made in the vector layer properties / field 
tab. As far as I remember, there was no support for ui files or drag 
and drop designed forms in the web client (unless this changed 
meanwhile), so if you generate a drag and drop form and skip the field 
you mentioned, does this not lead to the desired result?

There are a couple of other discussions or ideas related to this. One 
being brought up by J?rgen IIRC, which involved being able to define 
multiple form layouts for a layer which could then be used based on the 
context, in which a form is being shown (e.g. feature identify, 
attribute table => form view, embedded form and this list could be 
expanded with web services, involved user etc.)
The other discussion I remember was by Denis or Nathan (not sure) and 
it's more about the organization of the fields tab in the layer 
properties. My main concern about your idea is that it will add yet 
another field to an already overly crowded table which defines the 
representation of the fields. Instead of a table, there should be group 
boxes which will make it a lot easier to manage the fields.

Under the hood, I've been writing a new API for the widgets which will 
make maintenance for all the widgets a lot easier and providing custom 
widgets should be straightforward (also from python). I'll integrate 
this API into 2.1 but will probably not yet port the old widgets to the 
new API but the relations widget will be based on the new API.
Maybe webclient widgets could be ported to the same new API? I didn't 
think about it yet, but it could be worth a thought. As mentioned, I 
don't know the webclient code, so I'm not sure if this is feasible.

I just ran into another problem... how do you pass a list (of strings) to a
QT function which requires a QStringList (which is not available anymore).

line 208, in getRasterFiles
    workDir.setNameFilters( filter )
TypeError: QDir.setNameFilters(QStringList): argument 1 has unexpected type

How do we handle translated strings with arguments? QString::arg() is not
available.

Not sure if the following would work? The string syntax is slightly
different and would require re-translation, but at least works in English

before:
self.tr( "%1 not created." ).arg( outFn )
after:
self.tr( "%s not created." ) % outFn

Traceback (most recent call last):

Hi Matthias,

I probably took a wrong timing for such a discussion. We should
re-discuss this again then 2.0 is out.

QGIS web client does not display different widgets or forms so far. But
we plan to add such functionality, starting from the simple ones ;-)

The GetProjectSettings command delivers widget type information but may
not yet provide all necessary details. I can later ask Marco to add
missing bits.

I know about the already crowded GUI situation. On the other hand, the
table also has its advantages - quick overview over everything and ease
of use.

Maybe the september meeting would be a good time to rediscuss the form
issues again. J?rgen will be there and Nathan will be there, hopefully
you as well.

I'll be patient and wait for version 2.1 ;-)

Andreas,

you can try my new plugin DataDrivenInputMask (tables need to be in 
PostgreSql database, though)
It is not accepted yet (it's been waiting for almost a month now) but 
you can check it out from github [1]

Hi Andreas,

which are the difference from the standard editing forms ?
are there some new features ?
The first useful thing I saw is that I can copy the attribute without go in
start editing mode.

thanks

Hey Andreas,

Just to add to Denis's code example.  You can also use:

d = iface.getFeatureForm(layer,feature)
...some other code..
d.exec_()

which means you can get the dialog without opening it and open it later.

Hi Borys

I tested the newpluginmanager branch and I must say the new plugin 
manager / installer is really a great user experience. And it is good 
that the plugin manager also works without the python bindings (handy 
e.g. in the server case).
Codewise, I have few suggestion on detail level:

QgsPluginRegistry: isLoaded(), isPythonPlugin(), isPluginCompatible() 
can be const

QgsPluginManager: pluginMetadata() returns a pointer to the map. This 
function should be const and return either const pointer or a copy (kind 
of similar issue like recently with the layer registry)

It might be worth thinking if QgsPluginRegistry should be in core and 
accessible by third party apps / plugins. Like that it would e.g. be 
possible to use functions from one plugin in another and load the 
required plugin if not already there. The plugin registry could also 
emit an unload signal to notify the dependent plugin. I'm not 100% sure 
it is a good idea, but maybe it would be handy for sextante (e.g. WPS 
plugin requires a loaded sextante)?

All in all great work. I'm proposing that you merge the branch to master.

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

As Borys is away would you be able to merge it tonight.  I can then merge
the SIP update once that is done, just need to check the status.  I'll take
care of updating the python part of the installer to the new API once it's
merged into master.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Nathan

I'm away today and can merge earliest late evening or probably in the 
morning.
Alternatively, to not block your progress with the new API, you could do 
the plugin manager merge / SIP update / python part update and the const 
things can be easily added later.

Regards,
Marco

Marco,

I can merge the new plugin installer tonight if your happy with that.  I'm

Hi,

We have the following error

File "C:/Documents and
settings/xxxxxxxx/.qgis//Python/plugins\imagemap_plugin\imagemapplugin.py",
line 218, in handleGeom geom.transform(crsTransform)
NameError: global name 'crsTransform' is not defined

when 'on the fly' CRS transformation is enabled and the CRS is different.

Hi All

I have been asked about a C++/Python programmer to work on integrating
LiDAR and Thermal data processing tools into QGIS-SEXTANTE, and I
think this is a good place to look for one.

The project is part of a larger european project called Thermolidar
(www.thermolidar.com).

Salary would be between ?22,883 - ?24,979 / year, depending on
experience. 25 days of vacations. The contract might be extended to
several years

The project is based in Edimburgh

If anyone is interested, you can get in contact with Juan Suarez at

Please file a bug report:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/imagemapplugin/issues

I had already ported the plugin to QGIS2 api, but maybe something else 
changed (OR it is a real bug :-) )

Thanks,

Hi !

Bernhard , your plugin sounds great !

Could you show a screenshot of the editing form to edit the data contained
in related tables ? Having no PostGIS database setup, I can't test it...

Do you think the plugin would be easily adaptable to work with spatialite
databases too ?

Thanks !

Olivier

Hi Matthias,

Thank you for the tip, but this problem was simply lack of space in the virtual machine. My fault, sorry...


Hi J?rgen,

I was using the -d option because initially it was always rising errors with some libreoffice packages, and I did not remember to remove it at this time. The truth is that I was having some problems and conflicts with some dependencies: grass-dev, qgis-dev and python-central.

And sorry for the crossposting, I initially thought it was a general error, and sent to the devs list, but there was no answer, and tried in the users list. After all, it seems that it is a local problem, although it occurs on multiple machines. I leave here the record for those who are faced with the same problems.

Thank you and sorry for the noise.

Best regards,
Pedro

Hum, yes and no....
Basically yes, the sqls are currently written for PostgreSQL's internal 
structure so they must be redone. Moreover to avoid loading too many 
tables into QGIS, changes in simple and advanced n2m relations are 
currently directly written into the DB in a transaction. This has to be 
handled for spatialite. If there is an effective handling of layer 
groups I would prefer to load all tables into QGIS and thus be able to 
add undo/redo actions, too.

See [2] and the docs in help.

Message-ID: <40AF8FBE93A3794B931241921F19BC6E06D7C0D1@WMUCROEXC01.wm.local>

I am updating a number of locally developed plugins to work with QGIS 1.9.  I am having trouble getting QgsVectorLayer.loadNamedStyle() to work.  I wish to use it from within a python plugin.

In troubleshooting the issue I have the following code which works from the python console in QGIS 1.8 but not in 1.9.

from qgis.utils import iface # redundant in QGIS 1.9 but doesn't hurt
layers = iface.legendInterface().layers()
style = QgsApplication.prefixPath() + "/python/plugins/Gopher2QGIS/styles/SourceLineVertice_Style.qml"
layer.loadNamedStyle(style)
layer.triggerRepaint()

At the loadNamedStyle point QGIS 1.8 returns:
(PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u''), True)

QGIS 1.9 returns:
(PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'Loaded from Provider'), True)

Both appear to have loaded a style layer (returning a 'True' flag if I understand correctly) but the style of the layer in QGIS 1.9 is unchanged.

The style file referenced by each has been created by that version of qgis and loads correctly from the properties dialogue.  Any help that can be provided would be greatly appreciated.

Regards
Adam Bioletti

Hi all.
I have real life instance of Oracle to play with. I'm finding several
minor issues:
* when a SRID is not selected, the error message is misleading (select
a table instead of select a srid)
* clicking on the case srid, the text is editable; better to erase it
and leave it empty (it is easy to leave some extra characters, so the
srid is not recognised)
* wouldn't it be better to remember the SRID used for each table?
* it would be better to put the last used SRID as a default for new tables
* the order of the fields for selecting the PK is not always the same
as in the table
* when widening the column (too small by default BTW) for selecting
the PK, the content is no longer displayed until one closes the window
and reopens it
* indices (MBR) are displayed as geometry tables; this is confusing,
if possible better avoiding it
* if a wrong PK is selected, the error message does not refer to the
PK (I understand it is probably not possible to know what exactly is
wrong), and the cursor indicates wrongly that something is being
processed.
More later - thanks.

This happens with multipolygons, not with points.

nor with lines.
We also noticed that one extra line is listed for most or all geom
tables, without the type of geometry. Also, many tables have both a
polygon and a multipolygon layer (or line and multiline).
Is this a known phenomenon? Any explanation?
Thanks, and sorry for the flood of email.

With the new SIP API, we should find the best way to publish plugins for 
various QGIS versions in one repository. It's no problem in small 
repositories, where all multiple versions may exist side by side, because the 
plugin installer (both: old and new) can filter the best availale version. But 
the new central repository contains hundrets plugin versions, so for 
performance reasons it only exposes the most recent version of each plugin in 
the xml. If QGIS version is explicitly pass in the url (e.g. 
http://blahblahblah.xml?qgis=1.9), the repository returns the most recent 
*compatible* version. Otherwise - just the most recent. The new installer 
includes current QGIS version to the URL, old one doesn't. So if there is an 
old plugin version for QGIS 1.x, and a newer for QGIS 2.0+ , Qgis 1.8 won't 
show it at all - because the repository will only return the latter, what will 
incompatible.

There is a few solutions I see:

0. Don't change anything, just say to plugin maintainers to make all existing 
plugins compatible with both API. IMHO unacceptable solution; it was possible 
for small API improvements during 1.x API, but forcing people to maintain 
completely old API in complex plugins can only discourage them from further 
maintaining.

1. Release an update for the the old plugin_installer, with the current 
version added to the url. Fast and easy, however I see some downsides:
- Generally I'm not very keen to mess user's dicertory with core plugin 
updates unless it's really justified.
- Either 1.8 packages will be updated too or it will require immediate 
plugin_manager upgrade right after installation.
- Unless the plugin_manager is upgraded, many plugins dissapear. Looks like a 
nasty and surprising regression during using the stable 1.8. This is probably 
disqualifying.

2. Change the new repository policy: let it returns plugins for QGIS 1.8 when 
called without the ?qgis= url parameter. This means: the ?qgis= parameter is 
required, and the lack of it is a depreciated exception, only designed for 
QGIS 1.8. With this reservation it looks reasonable for me. Please note the 
new pyplugin_installer (it's a part of the manager working usually under the 
hood) adds this ?qgis=$CURRENT_VERSION parameter anyway.

3. Like 2, but return the full list of plugins when called without the 
parameter. Advantage: more clear than 2. Disadvantage: more server load and 
longer (maybe much longer?) repository fetching in QGIS 1.8


I vote for the solution 2.

Hi Borys, I just had a look at the plugin manager. Big thumbs up, this 
is good stuff!!

To your question: version 2 sounds reasonable to me as well. We can 
easily control the future parameters and append the qgis version always.

Am I correct, that in the future, there is no (easy) way of installing 
an older version of a plugin?
If yes, I'm not really a fan. If the plugin maintainer releases a buggy 
version, there is no way to revert to an old working version until the 
maintainer releases a bugfixed version.

All in all, what are we talking about in terms of size? With a 
compression enabled HTTP connection, I don't expect the plugin xml to 
be too large to pass through any internet connection in a timely manner.
Also, this request can easily happen asynchronously, so we don't even 
have to interrupt the UI.

Best
Matthias

Hey Borys,

I think option 2 is the best.  Anything we can do server side is the best
option to reduce any hider on the users.  As long as this is noted with the
plugin repo API then I see no issue.

Hey all,

Would I be able to get an update on where everyone is at with updating the
core plugins.  I have started updating the plugin installer and should have
that done tomorrow.

Hi Nathan,

fTools part is mostly done, but unfortunatelly I have to time for intensive
testing, so maybe there are some minor issues.

Hi,

Am I correct that classification in QGIS is only done at the moment the
user presses the "Classify" button?

What if I have dynamic data that changes every day (e.g. a population
register) and I want to display this up-to-date data with Quantiles
where the class borders should always match the current data?

Is there any solution for that? E.g. a dynamic classification on project
load?

Same here for SEXTANTE. You already merged the PR I made, but there
might be still some issues. I think that, anyway, the new SIP API
branch it should be merged into master so users can test, and I will
be ready for fixing all issues ASAP if they appear.

thanks again for you great work!

Hi Andreas, 
what about a python script on load of your project? 
Do you need that at layer level?
I agree, that would ne nice

I have fixed a few of the GdalTools algorithms (and most of the generic
code that is used by all algos), but quite a few remain. Most of the work
left is rather simple, i.e. argument processing and string comparison.
But I don't have much time until next week. If someone can step in it would
be great.

Thanks. Alessandro, what is your opinion? This version is all on your side.

I think about implementing it in 2.1. Of course it would either require 
sending the whole plugin set in the xml or aditinal API requests for "get 
other versions" (I prefr the former, as the latter would raise a number of new 
problems).

The size is now ~300kB, so the full set would be probably 1-2MB. You're right, 
it's rather a matter of better hardware. If you look at the download progress, 
the new central repo downloading time is a few times longer than any other 
repo, but most of the time is the response lag, not data transfer.

It is done asynchronously already. Otherwise QGIS would load maybe two times 
longer :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] manageR update for 2.0
Message-ID: <9A9C4907-0F32-46AE-B622-B9F20760E318@gmail.com>

Hi all,

The manageR plugin developed by Carson Farmer is an excellent tool and brings incredible integration between QGIS and the R statistical analyses package in a native R environment. I was wanting to ask the developer community if there is any chance of seeing it updated for 2.0 compatibility? I don't know if it needs work for the new sip API or if it has more complex needs to make it work in 2.0, but I'm holding out hope that others would like to see this plugin make it through the 2.0 transition. Carson? Are you still out there and able to take a peek at the code needs? Am I the only user that recognizes and will miss the value of this plugin in QGIS?

Regards,
John

I also miss it. AFAIK there are additional problems in Windows,
because of rpy2, right?
All the best.

Message-ID: <C5A9AA3BD0FFB848B2E000C6D3B4A8BE43205B54@EXCSRVGAV02.tri.lan>

Hi,

Is there any way to call Sextante functions in a python script, but outside from QGIS? I'm trying to do "import sextante" and it gives me an error. Am i missing anything? Maybe environment variables such as PYTHONPATH...
However, if i do the same thing into the python console of QGIS, the import works OK. I would very much appreciate if someone could provide an example.

Thanks in advance,
Be?at

SEXTANTE depends on QGIS, so you need QGIS to run it

Yes, rpy2 binaries are not regularly built for Windows. That's the only 
issue I'm aware of.

I too love the power of this plugin.

I am glad I am not alone. I only wish I possessed the skills to bring it up to date. Here's to hoping someone else does and can.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python application
Message-ID: <1370586888123-5058598.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to create a pygis-application with a code found in the "quantum
gis coding and application guide". I've programmed before but I'm new to
python as such, so right now I'm basically just trying to break this down
and understand how it works.

To the issue: I'm using the code below but I get the "invalid syntax" error
on the line of:
self.connect(self.actionAddLayer, SIGNAL("activated()"), self.addLayer) 
where "..actionAddLayer" is marked.

What is wrong here?

cheers

Another possibility is to search for funding to sponsor one developer.

This seems to be related to the (possibly messy) way the tables have been managed, so
probably a local phenomenon.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug working with size in data-defined properties?
Message-ID: <CAM4StfBU=ggAXhRWWikU0c9RxG_K=Sa-She=JhuX3rfOpo9TJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm getting not expected results when working with data-defined size on
symbols. I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong or maybe it's a bug.

The test it's quite simple:

1. Create a point layer with a sizeT table .
2. Create a point and give sizeT=10 .
3  Go to symbol layer (simpleMarker) and set size = 10  and see the result
3. Now active size in data-defined properties and pick the column sizeT.

The result is not the same (I was expecting that). Neither in
milimeters/map units.

I'm working against master, and other fields as rotation are running as
expected.

I have had a look to the bug tracker but I haven't seen this one reported.
It seems a pretty obvious bug so I rather to ask first here, because maybe
I'm doing something wrong or maybe I'm expecting something erroneous.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks.

Hi,Confirmed for me. 
It looks like size is multiplid by a factor 0.2.
6 value in data defined looks like 1,2 on screen. 1 look like 0,2. 

BTW behaviour is not clear since old advanced properties (proportion /
rotation) have not been removed AND have a different behaviour. They do not
use actual value, but act as a modifier of symbol size. New behaviour is by
far better! (still lacks options to use non linear fonctions.. but it still
is very nice)
Can anybody explains that newbehaviour and it interfers with data defined
style? 

R?gis

just checked and I confirm that there are no Windows binaries for rpy2
and recent versions of python/R.

Hi R?gis,

Thanks for the testing. I think it's not multiplied by a defined factor at
all, divide by 0.2 and you still won't get the desired size.

Cheers.

Using R via Sextante is also a good alternative. Shapefiles and Rasters are
exported into R and it's possible to apply all sorts of R tools to them.
There are a few good examples already in the algorithms tree.

Hi

Check if you have activated Advanced -> Size scale Field -> Scale area / 
scale diameter
In the first case, size means actually area with data defined symbology.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

You are right, it seems that slecting scale diameter does the trick. I
don't recall to change this, anyway thanks for the pointer.

Cheers.

Thanks marco, that's it. 
It's not easy to understand that advanced option are applied even if no
field is selected, since it was previous behaviour. Any idea how to make gui
more consistent for 2.1?

Hi Paolo,

I would like to know if you have some trouble to select Oracle layer in 
the Oracle connection dialog ?

I have tested the Oracle Connection for a customer and I didn't be able 
to add Oracle Layer to my project because I can't select it.

Hi Ren?,

Did you get the table listing?

If yes, you have to choose the geometry type and the primary key column
- otherwise you cannot select and add the layer. Same with Postgis, but
with Postgis there is some good autodetection (depending on the QGIS
version).

Hi Andreas,

Thanks for this information.

I have the table listing but I don't that I have to choose the geometry 
type and the primary key column. Do I have to select  the SRS ?

Yes, that's the point. Apart from a few small Oracle-related quirks, and very minor
issues I have mentioned, it works very well.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,

QGIS needs a specific CRS (ie. SRID) and a defined geometry type (point, line,
polygon) for each layer and offers what it finds in the database or requires to
enter what is undefined.  You can only select the lines that are fully defined.

That's very similar in the PostGIS and Oracle dialogs.  It's just that Oracle
doesn't have "standard" constraints, that limit the usable geometry types and
SRIDs in a column and therefore also doesn't have a metadata table that carries
that information, while PostGIS tables are usually quite constrainted.

So for Oracle everything except the geometry columns themselves need to be
scanned, while for PostGIS that can be taken from the metadata table in the
usual case with applied constraints.

If you create geometry column in PostGIS 2 with SRID 0 (meaning any) and type
GEOMETRY (any geometry type) the outcome might be quite similar and you get a
couple of lines for that column, each with a different combination of available
geometry type and SRID combinations in the table plus another line where you
can enter geometry types and SRIDs that you don't already have.

But the oracle provider isn't very widely used, so there are probably still
things that could use attention.

Hi Ted

At the moment the release looks like it will be delayed by at least
3-4 weeks - there are still around 80 blocker tickets and we had some
last minute changes we wanted to incorporate into the 2.0 relelase. I
will be posting a new release timeline early next week.

Regards

Hi.
I think these notes should be added to the User Manual.
Otto, do you agree?

I will have to test this. The value of manageR is the familiar R console and the simple import/export of raster and vector layers into the workspace. Although manageR is marked as incompatible with 2.0, I have gotten it to run after a fresh installation in QGIS, but the import function is broken, so it is of little use. I'll look into the example R scripts and see how that works out.

Cheers,
John

558909
Hi,

I'm using these two pages to get an actual download count of qgis 1.8 
and by cumuling all the page views on the *.exe, the number is 558909.

Am I doing a mistake (counting twice) or is it the real number ?

regards,
jean-roc

It's a real number, not necessarily real people (some may be bots). Also 
not necessarily unique. I've read that awstats tends to overestimate up 
to 10%. Its also hard to tell of those hits, how many actually 
downloaded the whole file and installed.

Keep in mind that only reflects windows installs too.

I've actually been looking for research papers on how to get better 
numbers out of download logs but haven't found much yet.

Thanks,
Alex

On the other hand, many organizations download just one copy, and distribute it
within their network.
I think a guesstimate of around one million users is not too far from reality.
Of course, trends are probably mor informative than actual numbers.
All the best.

I know about these details but I've seen the qgis' moon releases rise 
and fall into oblivion and I'm still amazed by the amount of progress of 
this software. So 558909 ?

Just Awesome. :)

Yeah I know the difference, if everybody was doing like me you ahve to 
multiply by x50 ^^

Is there a possibility to have a map of these downloads ?

Yes it is possible to map, the GEOIP extension in awstats just needs to 
be enabled (with a free db from Maxmind).

And, what is very strange, over 94% of the 558909 users don't use plugins... 

The most populat plugin (kudos to Victor) has 34k downloads:

Hi !

So I've been working a little bit about that "deprecated folder" idea.
It's not ready yet, but I have some questions since I'm not familiar at all
with QgsProjectFileTransform nor with how SVG search paths work.

https://github.com/olivierdalang/Quantum-GIS/tree/SvgLibraryRetroCompatibility

*Here's what it does :*

1. Installation
It creates a new "svg_deprecated" folder containing all original 1.8's
symbols (alongside the normal "svg" folder, right in the installation root)

2. Project file conversion
In the QgsProjectFileTransform::transform1800to1900() method, it updates
the svg paths.
- if the path starts with a "/" (which seems to correspond to the svg
folder path), it prepends "QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/svg_deprecated"
- if not, it does nothing (since it's an absolute path)


*Questions :*

A. Is it always right that a path starting with a "/" is a file inside the
QGIS's svg folder ? (I never used SVGs search paths, if such a thing exists
in 1.8)
B. Is it okay to refer to the deprecated folder using an absolute path (
starting with QGIS_PREFIX_PATH ) ? I tried to prepend "/../svg_deprecated"
instead, but with no success... (using absolute path has the major
disadvantage of making the project file unportable). Any idea ?
C. The file paths for SVGs in the print composer are absolute... So they
still link to the 1.8 installation's svg folder. This works, but only until
the user uninstalls 1.8... Is that OK ?
D. Are there other places where SVGs from the library can appear in QGIS
1.8's projects ? (I've thought of SvgMarker, SVGFill and as images in the
print composer)

(E: is it better to already open a pull request for this kind of questions,
even if the branch is not ready to merge ?)


Thanks !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS defaulting to no ellipsoid - Bug #7441,
	opinions needed
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash-VJnQc0V9e8x8mmwuExPKA7pR36awoOUoyzQo32fYzg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm posting this comment to the list to hopefully get some more
opinions about bug 7741 - "Measurements in degrees even when meters
are chosen as map units"

I think this bug is caused by QGIS defaulting to "None / planimetric"
for the ellipsoid for new projects. In 1.8 QGIS defaulted to WGS84.
IMO The correct behaviour should be to restore this as the default
setting.

However -- I'm having lots of trouble understanding how this is
supposed to work. The option to choose a canvas unit for a project is
under the "Canvas units (CRS transformation: OFF)" group in the
project properties dialog. If you hover over an option the tooltip
states "Used when CRS transformation is turned off". I'm pretty sure
this tooltip is wrong -- since the choice DOES apply even if CRS
transformation is turned on. HOWEVER, the choice is reset when the
project properties window is opened UNLESS CRS transformation is
off.... very confusing!!

To add to the confusion there's 2 "WGS84" ellipsoids listed - one is
"WGS84" and one is "WGS 84". Choosing "WGS84" actually results in
"Clarke 1986" being saved for the project!

My gut feeling is that:
- Ellipsoid should default to "WGS 84"
- The duplicate/bad "WGS84" ellipsiod needs to be removed
- The tooltip for canvas units needs to be fixed/reworded
- The choice of canvas unit should save even if CRS transformation is enabled

I'd like a second opinion on this though, since there may have been
discussion around this behaviour which I'm not aware of.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Some QSettings not ported to the new QGIS2.conf yet
Message-ID: <201306081246.37783.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi

Some settings are now in ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf
and some are still in the the old ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf

First, I see three files that still sets ApplicationName to QGIS:

src/app/main.cpp:  QCoreApplication::setApplicationName( "QGIS2" );
src/browser/main.cpp:  QCoreApplication::setApplicationName( "QGIS" );
src/helpviewer/main.cpp:  QCoreApplication::setApplicationName( "QGIS" );
src/plugins/spit/main.cpp:  QCoreApplication::setApplicationName( "QGIS" );

Second, the OrganizationName is still set to QuantumGIS (instead of just QGIS) 
everywhere.

Is it ok to switch it everywtere to QGIS/QGIS2 ?

So on linux the path would be ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SIP API Update merged. Attention plugin authors
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8WieaPgCptBD-p7CD6SPPoJ0kyBzrrsxvpKJykK-7Otw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

The new SIP API has been merged now.  There are still a few things to clean
up in some of the core plugins but it is merged for wider testing.   I
don't expect to find any major issues.

I have written a conversion guide here:
https://gist.github.com/NathanW2/5734767

Plugin authors could you take some time to update you plugins so they will
be ready for 2.0 once it is released _however_ please don't upload the new
2.0 version of your new plugin to the QGIS plugin repo until I give you the
go ahead as we need to do a update on the server so that 1.8 will not get
the 2.0 plugins because they will not run in 1.8.

I would recommend creating a branch in git with your new 2.0 version and be
ready to upload it when I give the go ahead.

Note: 1.8 plugins will not run in 2.0 without being updated to the new API
syntax. 2.0 plugins will not work in 1.8.

Users who live on the edge by running the dev build please just bare with
us while we get this sorted out, shouldn't take too long.

Email me if you have any issue.

Regards,
Nathan

Ah, the impossible metric of knowing how many users there are.

Myself I'd guess that the number is (far?) too high for number of users.
I've probably downloaded 1.8 at least 10 times myself.
While Paulo is right organisations do only download one copy, this is
countered by the countless people who download it and:
1) Find it doesn't do what they want how they want - immediate delete.
2) Use it for their one-off task and delete it a few days later.

Number (1) in particular I think has a lot of people in it.
But the user count is probably still very high, so well-done to all the
devs!

If QGIS had a "check for update weekly" kind of feature, that'd give a much
better (though still not complete) count of number of users.

Regards,
Jonathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error compiling qgis-server with internal
	spatialite support
Message-ID: <CABqTJk8W0yux1pO=CMp2P1recMRLaZ+=djDLMOrAXOrai-s8Qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I try to enable the internal spatialite support in the cmake phase.
After this in compiling phase I'm having an error.
I report the log with the errors.

Is the spatialite-internal option still supported in qgis-dev ?

Is it not 'better' to branch your old version in the 1.8.x branch, and 
do further work in master (for future releases)?

If I understand correctly, there is some (more) work and clean up 
possible for all 2.0 plugins:

- sip2 stuff Nathans lists in https://gist.github.com/NathanW2/5734767 
(from which the new SIGNAL stuff is most scary for me)
- remove old symbology related code, because 2.0 has only new symbology
- remove the 1.8/2.0 switches that were needed for being able to run 
both api-versions (not needed anymore because a 2.0 version is now 
incompatible with 1.8).

right?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] v2.0 and core mapserver export plugin
Message-ID: <51B436B7.8040308@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

with old symbology removed from 2.0, I'm wondering if the (old) 
mapserver plugin should still be available in 2.0?

It was fully based on the (project file part) of the old symbology 
system (Gary?), and we even added a message when the user was using new 
symbology.

So unless someone is willing to do a (I think major) rewrite of this 
plugin, I think it is not usable for 2.0.

There is the rt_mapserver_exporter available isn't it? Though I havent 
used it, I think it has some dependencies which we do not want to put in 
QGIS.

Regards,

Richard

I believe Nathan meens to not upload the new version of plugin to the cental 
repository unless everything is ready. We're in a difficult moment now (I guess 
this weekend only), when uploading new plugins to the central repossitory will 
mask the older versions for 1.8 users.

Don't be scarry, it's quite simple. Finding and replacing all QString methods 
to unicode methods was much worse for me :D

Actually no breaking change happened now, there would be just MUCH more 
switches (assuming that e.g. each formerly QString-type variable may be either 
QString or unicode). So in the simplest plugins you can still use them and 
make the plugin dual-API-compatible. Just remember to explicitly set both 
qgisMinimumVersion and qgisMaximumVersion, otherwise QGIS assumes 
qgisMaximumVersion at 1.999.

For more complex plugins it would be crazy to introduce billions of switches, 
so in practice it's much better to create separate versions.

Technically this can be done for smaller plugins like Borys said.
 Something like:

import sip
if sip.getapi("QVariant") > 1:
    # Use the new API style
else:
    # Use the old API style

Unless you have a small amount of code, say a small script, I would avoid
this because you would have to do it around every method that returns
QString or QVariant, which would not be nice and make your life harder.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] formal QGIS Version
Message-ID: <201306091107.18878.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Hi Tim, Hi All,

I have a quite urgent question due to our abeyance between 1.x and 2.x: when 
the formal version number is expected to be switched to 2.0? Just before the 
release? I'll temporarily hardcode "2.0" in the managing/installing and 
loading stuff unless you're going to switch the version globally very soon.

It's important because currently the manager, installer and loader 
(QgsPluginRegistry) accept plugins for 1.x and reject those with 
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0 what is pretty unclear, confuses and discourages 
authors, forces them to inroduce temporarily workarounds and blocks testing.

And by the why, a big thank you for all the great work and decisions

The only thing I *REALLY* miss in the new labelling is an optional FAST method 
to put labels just in poligon centroids with ommiting any expensive collision 
algorithms. When just browsing data the speed is priority, I don't need 
beautiful map, I need to FAST put ANY labels to see what is in polygons. 

Unless it's not available in the new labelling, we make a regression, removing 
one of the most fundamental features. Please correct me if I'm missed some PAL 
option that I can disable to achieve a significant boost.

If nobody objects for this, can a core dev remove the plugin please (for 
me it would end up in a pull request).

Some other 'ancient' (or at least the image shows QGIS 0.1 :-) ) popped 
up when I was looking for the contexthelp of the plugin manager:
Quantum-GIS/doc/plugins/geoprocessing/*
I would think it can be removed also?

Marco Hugentobler is currently working on optimizing the labeling of
area features. Because it is feature-freeze I don't know if this will be
added to 2.0 or delayed for 2.1 - maybe the PSC can make a decision
about this.

Personally I would recommend to get rid of the old labeling now.

I am checking the SEXTANTE adaptation to the new SIP API, and
everything is fine. The only "strange" thing that I found is how null
values are handled when they appear in a vector layer field. It seems
that, in that case, a QVariant is still returned (particularly a
QPyNullVariant object). Wouldn't it be better to return a Python None
instead, so in all cases Python values are returned?

Cheers

Victor,

Which code is returning a QVariant null?

feat['myAttribute']
returns QPyNullVariant for all features which have a NULL value in the 
field myAttribute.

None would work for me as well. But I'm not sure, why PyQt introduced 
this new type. Maybe there is a reason?

I find that same behaviour that Matthias confirms.

I guess it should be fixed, since it forces developers to add extra
code to handle that case, and it can be very confusing (all other
Qvariants are removed, except in this case...)

Hopefully it will be easy to fix.

Thanks in advance!
Victor

Just found another case which requires special attention:

Given a feature with myInt=5

Old API:
> feat['myInt'].toFloat() / 10
> 0.5

New API:
> feat['myInt'] / 10
> 0

Better:
> float( feat['myInt'] ) / 10
> 0.5

Or:
> feat['myInt'] / 10.0
> 0.5

I guess that's not something we can fix in a generic way, but something 
to keep in mind when updating a plugin.

I think it is a good idea to force the data type using str(),
unicode(), int(), float(), etc... Maybe a bit redundant, but probably
a safer strategy now

And the NULL values?

try:
   a = float(b['c'])
except TypeError:
   a = None

Do you have a more elegant idea?

There isn't a fix for this because it's not a bug. You column is a int
and python is giving you a int. The correct 1:1 conversion is
float(touring) / 10

Just found another case which requires special attention:

Given a feature with myInt=5

Old API:
> feat['myInt'].toFloat() / 10
> 0.5

New API:
> feat['myInt'] / 10
> 0

Better:
> float( feat['myInt'] ) / 10
> 0.5

Or:
> feat['myInt'] / 10.0
> 0.5

I guess that's not something we can fix in a generic way, but something
to keep in mind when updating a plugin.

Ok, I've renamed the ApplicationName from QGIS to QGIS2.

I leave QuantumGIS as OrganizationName for JEF, as I see it's also used in 
three files ms-windows/*nsh and I don't want to desynchronize it.

agreed, this is badly needed; I have mixed feelings:
* on one side I would also, with Andreas, get rid of the old labelling
* on the other, new labelling is simply too slow on old, less powerful PC to be
really usable; please remember that many of our users have oldish machines.
All the best.

Confirmed, it depends on mapscript, and it inclusion may njot be 100% appropriate, as
this is of rather special usage.
All the best.

Hi

I also think we should hide the old labelling dialog. I think Larry
was working on migration logic that would allow old labels to be
converted to new. I cant remember if he kept this back for 2.1 though.
Assuming its not ready, we should follow Nathan's suggestion of hiding
the old labels tab unless the project file indicates it is needed.

PS optimisation wise couldnt we just have a 'quick' mode that draws a
maximum of n labels pre render?

Regards

Tim

Hi Borys

>I need to FAST put ANY labels to see what is in polygons.

Couldn't you just use 'around center' then? Afaik the old labeling 
engine also does placement just on polygon centroid.

If the label has to be inside the polygon (horizontal and free placement 
mode):
The problem here is not the collision detection. It is the calculation 
of cost for the candiated positions that takes most of the time. I have 
an open pull request that simplifies the approach and increases speed 
(https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/640). Still it is of course 
slower than centroid placement, but the middle point of the label 
position is guaranteed to be inside the polygon.

To improve  the speed of label drawing (especially with buffer), I'm 
working on a label cache (characters cached as images). But that one is 
too risky for 2.0 and I still need to do various bugfixes before 
publishing it.

Regards,
Marco

I thought there also was the target or wish making QGIS able to
read/interpret the old labels (e.g. when opening a 1.8 qgs project
file). My experiences are that this does not work. (Even using the old
label dialog in qgis-master does not work properly) Therefore IMHO the
old labeling is useless.

This is also my experience. Importing a 1.8 project, the default label of "Label" is displayed. I tried using the old labeling in a new project with shape files, postgres and SpatialLite tables. Labeling works for the first field in the attribute table. Any other field and the default label is displayed. Unless this is fixed there is no reason to keep the old labeling. Using Friday's nightly build from Dakota Cartography on OS X 10.8.3.

I think the following need addressed before old labeling can be removed:

1) Method to do quick labeling (i.e., maybe bypass PAL's candidate creation
and collision management).

As Borys pointed out, this is very important, even if not 'pretty,' for
quick visualization of data. There are a couple of ways doing this that I
see:

1a) Remove old labeling GUI, but *not* its functionality for 2.0 release.
Instead, update the new GUI components to also be an interface for
configuring old labeling, with a single parent combobox (a la symbology) to
switch between Simple and Advanced. Then for 2.1, find a way to accomplish
1b). From the user's standpoint, the GUI doesn't necessarily change in this
regard, i.e. there remains a 'simple' labeling option for layers.

1b) Update QgsPalLabeling/QgsPalLayerSettings and PAL to allow some form of
bypassing of PAL, i.e. mimic old labeling's direct-to-paint text drawing,
to offer a 'simple' labeling mode. GUI would then be updated to offer a
'simple' GUI mode as noted in 1a). Updating old projects is required, and
old labeling can be totally dropped.

1c) Figure out the absolute fastest current settings to use to migrate old
labeling over to. Do 2) and remove old labeling. Still introduce a 'simple'
labeling mode, but it will not be as fast as old labeling until 1b) is
implemented.

1d) Show old labeling dialog, when project uses it.

Any other options for 1) anyone can think of?

2) Migration routine for projects <= 1.8 to similar 'simple' drawing setup.
For 1a) this would be done at the GUI-level. For 1b) and 1c) this means
creating a migration routine to permanently move those old settings to
new-style labeling (I have not worked on this yet).


My feelings/opinions for 1) and 2) are:

Having a 'Simple,' fast labeling mode will always have its advantages,
regardless of how the labels are actually rendered by the backend, and
especially as labeling becomes even more advanced and possibly even slower.
The simple mode could just be a GUI filter that removes all but options
similar to old labeling: text, buffer, and point-only placement. Behind the
scenes, the method of painting the labels could eventually involve PAL, but
probably initially just paint as per old labeling, under Advanced labeling
(as is the case now).

Such a 'simple' mode should probably be the default when going to Vector
Layer Properties -> Labels. Then, users can reasonably expect, or be
appropriately warned, that Advanced options may be slower.

Option 1a) preserves old labeling speed and much of its GUI work is not
necessarily a dead end, but it does postpone the removal of old labeling
(which shouldn't happen unless there is an equal replacement, right?). 2)
migration to labeling-ng settings could still happen and the changes shown
to user could still appear to have removed old labeling.

Option 1b) should be done, regardless. If done now, 2) is more of a
permanent update process, rather than also having to do more in 2.1
release. This option will take the most time and it will require an unknown
delay to 2.0 release, though maybe needs at least a week.

Option 1c) will result in unhappy users, especially on older hardware.
Marco H's, and any further, PAL optimizations will definitely help here.

Option 1d) the easiest for 2.0 release, but pushes issue of removal of old
labeling to 2.1, and (probably?) defaults to not using a fast labeling
method for new projects, unless optimizations are done.

I would appreciate any PSC guidance, and any developer help, with regards
to this 2.0 release issue.


3) Painting of text so that vector exports preserve text as text [0].

This is an important feature of old labeling that needs to exist in new
labeling if old is to be removed. I have worked on this and have it
exporting text again to SVG and PDF, though some issues with scale and
resolution remain. Need to finish what I am currently working on first (see
below).



> PS optimisation wise couldnt we just have a 'quick' mode that draws a

This was recently suggested here as well [1]. I see it as working like so:

* Divide number of to-be-labeled layers into desired absolute label limit.
* Set each layer's 'Number of features to label..' limit to the new
absolute per-layer amount, unless it is already set lower.
* Maybe introduce a fast means of randomly choosing which features get
labeled (a bit tricky because layers are labeled sequentially).

I think this should be on by default, and set to a reasonable limit
(5000?), then the user can change it later, as a per-app and per-project
setting. A message log notice can also be generated when the limit is
reached.


What I am currently working on for labeling:

Fix for issue #8003, "Font is not written to table when using change label
properties tool" [2]. Along the way to fixing that, I found a nasty
undocumented bug that accidentally allowed font substitutions (when defined
font is missing) to be saved to project. So, I've finally added
notifications to the user when a substitution has occurred.

Then, on to a serious attempt at finishing 3) [0]. Then, work on 1) and 2).
Any help greatly appreciated, especially since my wife could have our
second child any day now.  :^)

Please create an issue ticket for this. I don't think anyone has worked on
old labeling for a while. Not sure if it has even been updated to work with
the new vector API.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] The new Plugin Manager in master and plugins for
	1.8 and 2.0
Message-ID: <201306092352.02633.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

This mail is only related to the nightly builds and developer master branch. 
If you use the stable QGIS 1.8, you can ignore it.

Hi Devs and developer branch Users,

From yesterday the master branch uses plugin API 2.0, so old plugins for QGIS 
1.x don't work anymore. We (their authors) need some time to update them to 
the new API. Because formally the current developer version is still 1.9, I 
just hardcoded 2.0.0 as the current version number in the plugin managing stuff 
until it's officially switched. For that reason QGIS only accepts plugins 
compatible with version 2.0 now!

Don't be surprised the plugin manager has become blind and shows empty 
repositories. It just properly recognizes all the the old 1.8 plugins as 
incompatible and doesn't display them. As the plugins will be updated to the 
2.0 API, they should start to appear in the Manager again.


For plugin authors:

Because QGIS assumes plugin is only compatible with one major version, so you 
need to set qgisMinimumVersion to 2.0 in order to make it compatible with QGIS 
2.0.0 - 2.999.999. If you set qgisMinimumVersion to 1.x, it will assume that 
MAXIMUM version is 1.999.999.

In case you want to create a plugin compatible with both API, you need to 
explicitly set both qgisMinimumVersion and qgisMaximumVersion tags. However, 
it's only reasonable for very simple plugins, because the changes are maybe 
not numerous, but quite fundamental.

Done. Bug #8030. I set as a blocker as this worked in 1.8 and creates problems importing 1.8 projects into 2.0.

I guess it is about time to start porting plugins to the new API?

Is there a summary of the significant API changes or conversion guidelines available anywhere?  I've seen Nathan's summary of the SIP changes at https://gist.github.com/NathanW2/5734767, but I'm wondering if there is a more comprehensive page anywhere.

If not is there a preferred wiki type place where we could put one together?

Thanks

I've started a page for building a list of python API changes at

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20

So far this only contains Nathans notes on the SIP API change, plus some headings.  Feel free to add to it :)

Hey everyone,

You are now free to upload your new 2.0 API version of your plugins to the
QGIS plugin repo. Remember to set qgisMinimumVersion and qgisMaximumVersion
in your metadata.txt so that plugin repo and installer get the right
version of the plugin.

An updated conversion guide is at

bear with me I have a really basic question concerning you mail and 
advice [1]. I use quite a lot of QtSql.QSqlQuerys in my plugins to 
retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database. The value() method currently 
returns a QVariant. What is it supposed to return in the future or are 
only QGIS methods affected by what you describe? In the latter case your 
advice in [1] can be very misleading telling people to remove all 
toString(), toInt() etc.

TypeError: QSettings.value(QString, QVariant defaultValue=QVariant()):

I have qt 4.6.3,  python-qt4  4.7.3, python-sip4 4.10.2. Form INSTALL:

Required build deps:

Optional dependencies:
- for python support - SIP >= 4.8, PyQt >= must match Qt version, Qscintilla2

so it should be sufficient.

Let me precise.

Only the qgisMinimumVersion is required.

QGIS assumes, that a usual plugin is compatible with that version and higher 
WITHIN one major version. So you set the minimum to 1.6, and the maximum is 
assumed to 1.99. You set the minimum to 2.0, and the maximum is 2.99. Etc.

There are two cases however, you could want to set the qgisMaximumVersion 
explicitly:

1. Set it lower than default. E.g. min=2.0 and max=2.3. Hardly useful, as we 
don't break API within one major version, so plugins for 2.0 should work with 
any 2.x. Also if you want to publish one version for QGIS 2.0-2.3 and a second 
for 2.4-2.99, you shouldn't use the qgisMaximumVersion. Instead, you can bump 
up the version of the second plugin. QGIS will always choose *the most recent* 
version with matching qgisMinimumVersion. So the higher version will go to 
QGIS>=2.4, and the lower to QGIS 2.0 - 2.3.

2. Set it higher than default. If your plugin is very simple and you want to 
maintain one dual-API version instead of two separate, you can set:
qgisMinimumVersion to 1.6
qgisMaximumVersion to 2.99

Please note "99" is the highest allowed value, so if you use a longer number, 
QGIS will either reject your plugin because of unclear version number or 
fallback to default.


Hmmm, can we write it down somewhere in the documentation?

I have been working on a fix for this today, which is open as a pull
request at the moment [1]

We have been discussing this on IRC today, Main points:
On the C++ side, there are "invalid" and "NULL" QVariants. On the python
side there is only "None", therefore "QPyNullVariant" has been
introduced. As we could not see a reason for returning an invalid
attribute (if it's set it's a valid value or NULL) and QPyNullVariant
does not integrate nicely with other python code (e.g. python json
module maps None to NULL, put complains on QPyNullVariant) we decided to
map a "NULL" QVariant to "None" ( An Invalid QVariant would be mapped to
the same, but as that should not be returned anyway, that should not
happen )

Apart from this, it also updates the attribute related (set /get/
delete) methods to raise KeyErrors if a key is not available (the
getters returned an invalid QVariant so something had to happen here and
this behaviour seems appropriate).

I'm by no means a SIP expert, but it works fine here and I think it
looks good. If somebody with appropriate knowledge could have a look at
these changes I am glad.
If there is no objection I'm going to merge this soon.

Cheers
Matthias

Did you experience any other problems? I must admit when I uploaded my plugins 
to the central repo, I had similar problems and an impession that something is 
cached on the way.

There was a bug in the installer that could sometimes mask valid plugins if 
there was another incompatible version of the same plugin around (installed 
locally or available in another repo). Your issue looks a bit different 
however... Anyway it's fixed in the recent commit and I don't see any other 
problems after loooong tests with localhost as well as a remote static .xml 
file. All refreshing goes smooth.

Message-ID: <CAC8_qeZ+Gth3GY-q8769vbD_Sdd4v6fz0izttPcpzT-9gAGW2Q@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Spatialite 4.1 released recently. As far as I understand, the proposed
OGC's GeoPackage is based on spatialite.

For long time, I notice that spatiliate is kind of ignored (may be due to
interest level) and never got the full attention of the developer. Even
today, the only version supported is sptialite 3.8 in spite of v4.0 having
some great features.

Is it possible to have a full support for spatialite in upcoming releases,
if not v2.0. This will give put QGIS in ahead in race. Really like to see
v4.1 supported out of the box in QGIS 2.0 is possible.

Then, when GeoPakage nears approval, QGIS can become a reference
implementation (with modification)

Cross fingers :)


regards
ted

 Hi,

 Unfortunately I cannot start the new plugin manager if a proxy is set.

 Here is my bug report:

 Borys - can you please have a look at it? Maybe a side-effect of the 
 recent modifications that you can only see if the proxy is active?

 Thank you,

Hi,

I compiled current master and upon startup I get the following error:

symbol lookup error: /opt/qgis-2.0.0/bin/qgis: undefined symbol:

Am I missing something? How can I fix this?

Just one note more: you can safely set qgisMinimumVersion to 2.0 and it will 
work in master. Plugin managing and loading stuff thinks it is 2.0 already.

Hello!

 

I study on university of science and technology in Cracow Poland and i'm just finishing my BSc THESIS.

My BSc THESIS is about scalable vector graphics, inkscape, svg in quantum gis and also include synoptic symbols that i made.

I made 100 meteorological synoptic icons in svg. Are you interested in release them with new version of quantum GIS 2.0 ??

Hi Damian,

Thank you for your offer to contribute these symbols to the QGIS project.

We plan to release more SVG symbols with QGIS 2.1, after a Google summer
of code project finishes. Arjun will be working on a central symbol
repository where people can contribute and check out symbols.

We do not want to publish them with version 2.0, because too many SVG
symbols slow down QGIS considerably. Often people need a specific symbol
set only (e.g. morphologic icons, meteorologic icons, sports/leisure
activities) - it makes no sense to publish all icons to everyone.

Here is an open feature request: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7981 - if
you could add your icons there (e.g. as a download link or zip-file),
they will be considered with QGIS 2.1

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0 Timeline updates
Message-ID: <CALCNqkaTF7sNjqz8hPdEjK+QEhUtGKkdasWodBWttYAQpq9+bA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Just an updated timeline for the release:

* Hard feature freeze effective today (11 June 2013) - this means no
new features will make their way into the final QGIS 2.0 release.
* String freeze 25 June 2013 (only critical string changes needed for
bug fixing will be allowed after that point)

The actual release date will be determined when we have dealt with the
blocker tickets in the ticket queue.

I know many of you have been patiently waiting for the 2.0 release but
there were many features that needed polishing and inclusion and this
has caused some delays. Right now we have a lot of work to do to make
QGIS 2.0 stable and usable for everyone. As a general appeal could I
encourage you to:

* take the master builds (snapshots of the codebase that will become
QGIS 2.0) for a test drive and report issues you encounter using it
with your favourite datasets. Master builds are freely downloadable at
 [1] (there is a standalone windows build here : [2])
* if you have the financial means to do so, sponsor the fixing of one
or more blocker issues [3]. The best way to do this is to make direct
contact with a QGIS developer and negotiate a small contract with them
to do the work. There are also a number of commercial support
providers who may be able to offer this service for you listed on our
web site [4]

Lastly here are some frequently asked questions and answers:

Q: Why dont you make alpha / beta releases?

A: We have nightly builds of master for all major platforms - its a
waste of effort to also make alpha etc releases.

Q: You said the release would be ready last week / month / year /
century. What gives?

A: We are an open source project dependent largely on volunteer effort
and the sponsored contributions from a number of companies. We don't
have any dedicated team focused entirely on stabilisation and bug
fixing. This means that we can't just pour more staff / resources into
making sure a release comes out on time, instead we release when the
software is ready.

Q: So QGIS 2.0 is going to be perfect?

A: Probably not, but you can help us to make it as close to perfect as
humanly feasible. We highly recommend that you test with the master
build and help to identify issues by means of carefully lodged tickets
in our issue tracker [5]. Even with all the QA we can do, you should
still expect to encounter some issues since the code base has had a
massive overhaul and it is not possible for us to test all scenarios
that our hundreds of thousands of users use QGIS for.

Q: Is QGIS 2.0 going to break all my styling / projects / plugins?

A: While we are trying to preserve backwards compatibility where
possible, in some cases we couldn't / don't want to preserve
compatibility due to architectural changes in the code base.

Q: Is it true that the name 'Quantum GIS' is changing?

A: Yes, from 2.0 on, Quantum GIS will be called QGIS (note is all
upper case) and we will drop the 'auntum' part from the name.

Q: How do I be awesome like Asia Air Survey (our Gold Sponsor - see
their home page at http://www.asiaairsurvey.com/) and sponsor QGIS?

A: We would be more than happy to welcome any new sponsors wishing to
support our project. If you would like to sponsor QGIS, please contact
Paolo Cavallini <cavallini AT faunalia.it> for more information. As
well as helping to make QGIS 2.0 a reality, sponsors well receive
prominent placement on the front page of our web site.

Q: I hear the Queen of England uses QGIS to keep track of model the
movement of Corgi dogs around Windsor Castle - it is true?

A: This is purely a rumour, though I am sure there must be a grain of
truth to it...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] sorting order indicator?
Message-ID: <51B73390.3040504@terglobo.nl>

When sorting a vector attribute table by pressing a column header, a 
little triangle appears to indicate the order (ascending / descending). 
I would expect this triangle to be the other way around. Is this a bug 
or is it a problem in my (Dutch) logic?

I would say:

^ = ascending
v = descending

I discovered this today in a recent 1.9 but it appears to be the same in 
1.8.0...

Hi Raymond,

It works the same way my mail application and some other tables (no 
custom sorting methods applied there) such as the fields tab in the 
vector layer properties. So I think the current way it's fine and 
coherent. Other people feeling the same way as Raymond?

Hi Matthias,

I checked a few applications and discovered these icons are used mixed.

Spotify, Ext and our own bug list 
(http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=23) do it "my 
way".
QGIS, Skype and Thunderbird the other way around.

Wonder what others think...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin "category" - do we need it?
Message-ID: <201306111709.10112.lists@borysjurgiel.pl>

Among many other plugin attributes we have quite useless "category": 
vector/raster/db etc.  

In QGIS 1.8 the category is displayed in the plugin manager as "The plugin is 
installed in the [$CATEGORY] menu". However it's pretty confusing, because the 
category attribute has *no* influence on where the plugin action is placed (and 
I guess there is no simple way to implement it, as QGIS doesn't know which 
plugin inserts the action and what are its attributes).

In QGIS 2.0 this is hardly used: it's just displayed in the plugin details 
(and I wonder if not remove it at all). In Valmiera we agreed that tags are 
much more important than category, and sorting/filtering by category doesn't 
make much sense.

As today is the hard feature freeze, it would be good to decide if we want 
this attribute or not. I can either:

a) leave it as it: not documented, not officialy supported, merely used in the 
interface, however often used by plugin authors, possible to use in the 
future.

b) remove it completely for 2.0 and possibly introduce it again in the future 
if we get an idea how to use it. 
*Pros*: It's better to introduce something in 2.1 than break something 
existing (even if hardly used).
*Cons*: Plugin authors won't use it, so if we decide to introduce it, there 
will be less plugins already equipped with this attribute.

Are there any thoughts?

It is sometimes difficult to find where a plugin menu is installed. I have found that
the category can help users (if correctly described, of course).
All the best.

Message-ID: <DB24807D00689D48B45B012CCABDF1E7288E3C@mx.edisoft.pt>

 

Hi!

 

I am trying to implement a way to move a point, starting at X,Y
coordinates till reaches X,Y final point.

 

The code that I implemented to move the feature is:

       pointMarkersLayer->startEditing();

       float dx = finalPoint.x() -
featureRoute_p.geometry()->asPoint().x();

       float dy = finalPoint.y() -
featureRoute_p.geometry()->asPoint().y();

 

       pointMarkersLayer->translateFeature(featureRoute_p.id(), dx, dy);

       pointMarkersLayer->commitChanges();

       pointMarkersLayer->reload();

But the point marker do not move! Can someone give me some example, on
how to move markers in a point layer.

 

Thanks in advance,

Marco Gomes

I thought the idea was that based on this value in the metadata the 
plugin would be placed in that menu...

But I know it is not implemented yet.

Maybe is it possible to let the 'addPluginToMenu' take this 
metadata-value into account? And if not available keep current 
behaviour: just put it in the plugin menu. Then we can get (maybe) rid 
of the rest of the 'addPlugingToXXXMenu?

if this is hard, I also would remove it. The fact that it is easy for 
the user to find out where to find it is not enough for me to keep it....

The problem is it must be correctly set... 

So we have +1 for removing it and +1 for keeping. Well, I can keep it in the 
detail view, even stronger exposed, but I guess still in a form "Category: 
blahblah" rather than  "Hopefully you may find it in the Vector menu" ;-)

Yes, it's quite hard, as the 'addPluginToMenu' method doesn't know which 
plugin is called from (or maybe just from the console).

So maybe we should add a mandatory multiline attribute called "about" and 
encourage authors to include this information there. See:

My main point is, that a category is a single entry, while a plugin can 
actually place no menu entry at all to menu entries in different menus. 
So it should rather be a list of menus where you find related entries 
in than a single entry. Actually this does not offer the possibility to 
add a fair usage description for plugins which offer a different 
approach than to place an entry in a menu (e.g. add additional entries 
in the layer legend context menu...).

So I would remove it to make place for a more dynamic system (e.g. 
quick start text of max 300 chars) where a good recommendation for 
plugin dev's exist on how to write this text.

I have absolutely no strong opinion on this. I think Paolo deals more 
with users than I do.

Cheers

So you support the idea of the "about" tag. Paolo, is it ok for you? The 
plugin details would contain three well exposed fields: Name -> Description -> 
About.

This way we hit a translation issue. I guess I'll fastly implement something 
like in kde .desktop files as a last minute before the Big Freeze:
Name=Foo
Name[de]=Bar
Name[it]=Osteria

Tim, the Freeze comes at midnight UTC?

How would the "about" tag help an user finding its lost plugin.

Like Alister wrote in the ticked I refered:

<quote>

There could be a policy that plugin authors should explain on the "about" page 
where to find the plugin in the QGIS gui.
e.g. "XYZplugin provides the ability to do xyz in QGIS, and can be accessed 
from the Vector menu".
Or "WXYplugin adds a WXY tool to the standard digitizing toolbar".

</quote>

If you have another idea, please explain what use of the category tag would 
you like to see. How would you format the message?

I've been working on this bug (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6476) where 
the advance option of setting width and height of a symbol (according to 
an attribute value) doesn't work for a polygon layer.

I noticed that QgsSymbolV2RenderContext.layer() returns false if the 
layer is a polygon.

Before I continue working on it, I was wondering if there were similar 
active bugs / patches that tweak the value of 
QgsSymbolV2RenderContext.mLayer

Hi Devs,

seeking for some consensus about the content of __init__.py

am I correct that we cannot do without the __init__.py as this adds the 
classFactory(iface) member to the 'pluginmodule'-class?

(I tried to add the method to my main class, but that did not work)

But then should we not delete ALL other member defs from the __init__.py?
For clarity, and just to have just one place to define that metadata.

QGIS needs a fixed location where to look for the classFactory(), so 
__init__.py is the most obvious solution. Otherwise we would need to require 
other py file with a fixed name, what wouldn't change much.

> For clarity, and just to have just one place to define that metadata.

Exactly, __init__.py shouldn't duplicate any data from metadata.txt, so 
usually may contain just classFactory() only.

Thanks a lot! Then should I put the "label" attribute manually to the .ui file?

Message-ID: <CAFcNcQYRh2SaTXjSK7Uk2LTU0_+5OGC1+qt0jyp5h58=TRstfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list

When dealing with plugins with broken code, as is my current case, while
updating to the new SIP API, the new plugin manager (which is super nice,
by the way) will only show a portion of the error.

In my case I get an 'invalid syntax' message, which does not include the
line number anymore (like the old plugin manager) so that I can easily find
it.

Is there a way to get the full output of the error? If not, can I ask that
this be re-added?

Thanks

Nevermind... I just add to click to enable the plugin and it showed me the

Unfortunately I didn't manage to include more verbose error message to the 
detail panel before the feature freeze, so it has to wait for 2.1. For now you 
need to enable and disable the plugin to trigger loading.

I would consider this a bug (maybe even a blocker: regression) and not 
a new feature...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] gnome3 Qt dialogs
Message-ID: <51B81CEA.8040104@duif.net>

Hi List,

I want to ask something about the size and behaviour of Qt dialogs of 
QGIS on Gnome3 on Debian.

I've noticed that the dialogs (like the Project/Project properties 
dialog) are not real floating dialogs anymore. They are a sort of 
attached to the menubar of the QGIS application Window.

I cannot take the dialog and move it to another screen or place. Some 
plugin dialogs (like the Georeferencer dialog/window) I can still move 
around.

This should be ok, but the 'fixed' dialogs you can not resize in both 
directions: only the width can be changed.

For certain dialogs the buttons are almost out of view:
See http://www.flickr.com/photos/97361298 at N07/9023726318/

Mind you: the bottom is really the bottom of my screen.
In a normal dialog I could (using alt-mouse) move it up to come to the 
buttons. But with these fixed dialogs this is not possible.

De-maximizing the QGIS window (by double clicking the Titlebar) only 
works for the QGIS window:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/97361298 at N07/with/9023726318/lightbox/

So questions:
- am I the only one with this little annoyances
- is this debian/gnome3 only behaviour, or can I choose the standard 
type of dialogs?
- do I need a bigger screen for QGIS (or: what is the minimum size of a 
dialog supposed to be for QGIS.)
I'm normally working/building QGIS on a little 12.5 inch screen laptop 
with 1366x768 LED. When doing gis stuff I have a second large monitor 
attached to it.

Mind you, I'm not against big dialogs (though I prefer wider dialogs 
then), and I'm aware of the space problems we always have with our dialogs.
I could also imaging that it has something to do with other window 
toolkits (?android). I think we should try to serve both worlds, and I 
can live with my 'problems' if that makes it easier to develop for both 
worlds.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

This is gnome 3 default behavior. There is a howto [1] which explains 
how to disable this behavior on a particular system.

Hi Richard!

You are not the only one .. I am experiencing the same ..
IIRC we said in Zurich(not sure) that every dialog should fit in exactly
what you said (at least I think it was 1366x768) to be able to have QGIS on
netbooks ..
Not sure if this is still valid ..

But the thing you mentioned seems to be some gnome3 thing taking windows at
a fixed place ..
Probably the georeferencer is a "task" on it's own while "Properties" are
just a child of the main window?

regards
Werner

Ah, thanks Matthias for this pointer. It works.

Mmm, I think this is ok for me. With the 'fix' I can manage, and I'm not 
sure if 'real users' even have this problem.

@Werner: not sure what we should take as the minimum screensize. In that 
time netbooks were hot, but nowadays that is over. Let's fix more 
important issues, I think

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqsYiDRd0bRH29ZoNf3yACm+J41-Q-N3YFJoKuWgPkq7w@mail.gmail.com>

With latest master b287661c (but I think that it is happening since

if I run make again, it gets over this error and fails on

it compiles but when I try to run python with qgis libs or QGIS with
python I get:

    from qgis import gui
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initgui)

I am not sure if it is caused by previous compilation error.

What should I do?

Hey Radim,

Which platform are you on and what version of SIP do you have?  Your
version of might not support something in the header that I added.

I am not able to get python working with latest master so I cannot
generate new customization.xml. In theory, if you set correctly
PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find QGIS libs, you can run
scripts/widgets_tree.py and save the output xml to
resources/customization.xml. If it works for you please commit the new
customization.xml to master. I remember however that various problems
may appear.

For widget label it takes widget text() or windowTitle() if exists.

It is better to use standard "mSomethingWidgetClass" member names for
widgets instead of auto generated "widgetClass_number" to keep
customisation more stable.

Maybe I don't understand correctly, where is the regression exactly?

In the old installer the plugin status (in the most left column) was set to 
"broken" and that label had a tooltip with one-sentence error summary.
Now in the plugin detatails you see the same (status+summary) in a yellow box.

In addition, there is a popup window with error summary if plugin fails to 
load right after installation. Does the message in this window differ in the 
old and new installer?

The regression would be that sometimes with the old plugin manager you 
got a stacktrace which helped you to debug a problem where now it fails 
with only the exception message being printed without a call stack.

But thinking about it again... As long as there is an easy solution to 
reproduce the error in a way that you get a call stack it's all not 
that bad.

I and all the little green men are :) we definitely said something 
smaller than 1366x768 in Zurich please note that a Samsung Galaxy tab 2 
)so not suuuuper old) has 1280 ? 800 (and part of the 800 are lost to 
the android menus)

Does this mean that 2.0+ compatible plugins will always need to set
a qgisMaximumVersion ? Or will plugin manager be smart enough to assume
an higher max if qgisMinimumVersion=2.0 ?

Did you look in the "Invalid plugins" section ?

As far as I understand.

If min = 2.0
max will default to 2.99

If min 1.8
and max 2.0 it will work in both 2.0 and 1.8

It's all described in my reply to Nathan's mail (Monday, 15:46 CEST). To be 
precise: 

if not explicitly set, the default value is:
qgisMaximumVersion = floor( qgisMinimumVersion ) + ".99.99"

So you *only* need to set qgisMaximumVersion, if you're not satisfied with the 
defaulf range x.y - x.99.99

Can we put it somewehere to the docs? I was writting it a dozen times again 
and again since this behaviour had been introduced right before 1.0 release :D

Subject: [Qgis-developer] feature request with rectangle filter on circles
Message-ID: <51B86338.2000207@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am experiencing some problems with a feature request using a rectangle 
filter on a layer containing circles.

If I set the rectangle filter within a circle feature (i.e. the 
rectangle is strictly enclosed in the circle), the select does returns 
this feature, even though it should not.

I have written a few lines to reproduce this with a memory layer. It 
creates a circle as a line in the memory layer and does the feature request.
http://pastebin.com/N6npdmCP

Did I miss something?
Shall I fill a bug?

Thanks,

Denis

I just noticed, that this happens as soon as the arc is strictly bigger 
than 90 deg.

90 degrees: feature request returns nothing
91 degress: feature request returns the feature....

I have update the code to play with this.

I'm still unsure what window you refer: either the installer's dedicared error 
dialog or just the native QgsErrorDialogBase. The former is displayed right 
after installation, and I believe there always was only the short summary 
(I'll check it when I see the 1.8). 

The latter is shown at plugin loading, so when you click the checkbox. I 
believe it was never (in both: old and new installer) shown after 
installation, as the installer error dialog should intercept the error...

I did miss the flag exactIntersection in the feature request.

After setting the flag, it works as expected.

Sorry for the noise.

Most probably it does not work with dialogs which changed because
customization.xml is not yet updated.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CRS caching and custom CRS update
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP40866C4C481C81608D8551ABA860@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

In 1.8, if I update a custom CRS, I can directly use the new value for 
this CRS, while in master, I have to restart QGIS to be able to use the 
updated parameters. They are displayed when I choose the CRS, but not 
used during the actual transformation, which is a severe regression in 
my opinion as it makes the whole custom CRS management very confusing.

Ihad a look at the code and it is linked to the CRS caching mechanism 
mhugent added 6 months ago 
(https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/8dc0135b2c30697512a90a575b041562245c9447 
).

How can this be best solved? Simply reverting the patch is a 
possibility, but not the most satisfying. I tried to implement asimple 
"updateCache" function that we could call after modyfing a custom CRS, 
but it seems I missed something as I did not getthe wanted result. Could 
someone more familiar with the code have a look ?

Regards,

Leyan

Message-ID: <20130612132450.GA29286@gnash>

I was surprised by not finding my postgresql connections in the pull-down
menu when starting qgis-2.0 (master) from the build dir. I'm pretty sure
it used to work last time I'v built it.

NathanW told me this is due to a change in the configuration path, from
.qgis to .qgis2, and I'm wondering why this forced reset is needed.

I don't know what else is in those configs, but this specific setting
I'm after is really annoying to loose. It'd be like loosing bookmarks 
when upgrading a web browser from one version to another.

So, what's the rationale for changing that name, thus using a completely
separate configuration ?

Hi!

To my knowledge this is only for having 1.x and 2.x versions running
parallel on the same computer .. (If there are any new issues with the new
version or you need the old because some plugins you really need are not
updated)
But I think it will be possible to copy those seetings over from the old
configuration file .. Though i never tried it ..

regards
Werner

This is to allow the running of 1.8 and 2.0.

On windows, because I don't know where it is in linux, the settings are
stored in:

For 1.8
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QuantumGIS\QGIS

For 2.0:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\QGIS\QGIS2

1) For the re-banding we did
2) To allow 1.8 and 2.0 to run on the same machine without overriding a
persons 1.8 setup.

You lost the settings because settings are not auto transfered when QGIS
starts. It could be done but no one has done it.  This is the same reason
we have a .qgis and .qgis2 folder.  The plugins can conflict so we have to
keep them apart, the symbol library format has also changed,

Isn't there a commandline switch to use a custom setup, for those that
are concerned about that ? How many people will want to run both 1.8
and 2.0 once 2.0.0 final is out ? This sounds like something really only
useful during development/debugging of 2.0 branch.

That doesn't change the issue. The settings will still be moved and reset a
fresh using --configpath.

You would be surprised how many want to run bn

On Linux the settings are in ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf

To get the latest (if you've been running QGIS 2.0 already two weeks 
ago) copy them from ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf
If you have not been using master so far (I know that you did, but 
maybe others, and especially users upgrading once stable) copy from 
~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf

You've lost the config twice due to renaming from QuantumGIS to QGIS
once:
~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf > ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf
and again:
~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf > ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf

I also think a function for upating the cache would be best. Could you 
make a ticket, assign it to me and attach what you did so far?

And --configpath isn't practical on OSX, you don't start apps from the command line on OS X, and there is no mechanism (like there is in Windows shortcuts) to add switches to an app startup.

This reminds me, if it's not too late, can we get something done with http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7192 (original http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1442 that I could not reopen)?  I really wanted to get the qgis2 folder moved on OS X and Windows for the 2.0 release.

There is a patch for Windows in the original bug report, and a addition for OS X.  I could try applying it, but I don't know if there is anything else needed after all the changes in the source, and it might affect plugins that don't wrap paths in quotes.

Yes, but it won't be the default.

> You would be surprised how many want to run bn

I surely want to run 1.8 if 2.0 doesn't know about my connections :)

My point here is what should the default be ?

The current default is that upgrading from 1.8 to 2.0 creates a fresh
configuration, loosing the old one (plugins included).
I find this pretty annoying, as a user.

If I understand correctly, the risk with using the same configuration
with both 1.8 and 2.0 is that configuration changes I make while running
with 1.8 would be immediately visible when running 2.0, and vice-versa.
Sounds like a feature to me, not like a problem. So, what's the problem
with that, exactly ?

This sounds like an invalid argument, if what you want is two icons
for starting the same application with two different configurations.
Keep the web browser bookmarks in mind.

Thanks, I didn't remember about the previous time :)
Dyabolic qgis upgrades !
Was the old config copied last time ? I think it'd make sense,
if the formats are compatible.

I confirm copying that file helps.
And I also confirm that QuantumGIS/QGIS2.conf does _not_ have
all the postgresql connections that are present in QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf

Every qgis upgrade makes its connection victims... sadly.

For the average user (even power user might not know how or want to mess around with it) - --configpath is not usable on OS X to set a different config path.  Nobody starts QGIS or any other app on OS X from the command line.  It is not possible to create a shortcut on OS X that starts an app with different startup options.

Hmmm seems a config importer would be important addition. A post-install 
script? A one-time core Python plugin? I mean something as simple as that:

for key in harcoded_list_of_important_keys_to_import:
    if settings1.hasKey( key ):
        settings2.setValue( settings1.value( key ) )
QMessageBox( "Thank you, please restart QGIS now" )

As it only copies a bunch of QSetting values, it shouldn't introuce bugs, and 
it's not really a feaure...

I give my fresh experience. :)

I'm running with both qgis (1.8 and 1.9 dev).

I need use both because I have an important project created from a
group of workers.

On qgis 1.8
Now I need to apply it on a qgis 1.9
But because the importing on qgis 1.9 has lost me

surely transparency and perhaps something on label setting.

I need constantly to move from qgis 1.8 and 1.9 to manually reset
every single layer.

My experience is that is absolutely need to use both in the same machine.

In the first period of transiction.
Almost for who has important qgis 1.8 project that don't want lost.

Regards,

Andrea.

I guess you'll want to do that only when the new config file doesn't
exist, so it is about to be created. The user should be prompted about
that, something like:

 "Configuration file 'XXY' was not found, do you want to start a new
  one from scratch or do you want to copy it from an old one ?"

Then the tool should let you choose an old configuration to copy from.
Ideally you'd have the known old configs in a pull down menu, but still
allow the user to pick other locations.

It's obvious

There was one default location QuantumGIS/QGIS and I was thinking about a tool 
for usual users to copy from there to QGIS/QGIS2. 

If you store your config in a custom location, then you used to run QGIS with 
--optionspath, so I don't get the idea to copy it to the default location now.

There's actually been QuantumGIS/QGIS, QuantumGIS/QGIS2 and there is QGIS/QGIS2
now. I guess in the future there could be something else, thus the idea of letting
users copy from somewhere else. Think at QGIS3 time, someone upgrading from QGIS1
would have two possible places to copy from. Is it too complex to let users decide
where to copy from ?

Andrea, I also run both 1.8 and 2.0, not saying it should be forbidden.
But I don't really understand why they need to have two different
configurations.

As a test, I tried symlinking ~/.config/QGIS to ~/.config/QuantumGIS
and ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf to ~/.aconfig/QGIS/QGIS.conf

At that point qgis-2.0 starts correctly and all my database connections
are there.

Of course it's not too complex, it's probably even not more than 10 times more 
time-consuming and still fits in half an evening. I only insist it is not 
necessary to provide a combobox for intermediate stages of a migration 
performed in master when it was in highly unstable alpha time. Instead, I 
proposed just a half-an-hour minimalistic solution for painless transition 
from stable 1.x to 2.0.

We have 80 open blockers, far too less hands to work and personally I just 
don't know anyone keen to write such conveniences for apha users. If you know 
someone able to invest half an evening into it, I'll be happy (unless he 
otherwise could squash bugs ;))  ).

I have generated new customisation.xml on another computer and pushed
it to master. It seems to work but it reported for many widgets:
  "No module named qgscollapsiblegroupbox"
which could be a problem.

The same here.

No I never wrote any tests like this. In fact there is no test for the
main.cpp (which does the base application startup and where those
command line options are parsed.

Thanks Tim. 
You confirm it's possible? I'm absolutly not able to tell if it's possible
to test it or not.

Yes, some dialogs started to work. Unfortunately many important are excluded 
because of containig qgs* widget classes (like the one you mentioned above).

Also tab widgets don't work.

I'm reopening the ticket but without blocker flag. I don't know if it's a  
regression, but at first sight doesn't look like that.

Thanks for this partial solving. Maybe one of us will have some time later 
before the release.

Hi!

I don't know if someone already sent this link to the list ..
But following the discussion about adding new symbols I thought I could
share this link here so that it could probably also be applied to the
symbol sharing / creating work thats going on ..

Looks good to me .. and also the license should be ok ..

just FYI

Hello

I am working on a QGIS Python plugin and I have a problem concerning font sizes. With QDialogs I have no problem to set the font sizes. But as soon as I work with a QDockWidget and add it to QGIS every font size settings are ignored. Qt Creator shows the correct font sizes but QGIS seems to overwrite these settings. Does this behaviour have a reason and is there a possibility to prevent QGIS from overwriting these font size settings? Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <CAJEy1xVXUxs5qt0iddHzadqJqnmQuYMBJ52GNpHeLYOLmSFrFQ@mail.gmail.com>

While translating I found some tips that are in my opinion too long or
technical for standard users, e.g.

- "How do I refer to QGIS?" - this tip is too technical for users...
- "Moving Elements and Maps in the Print Composer" - it is too complicated
to remember...
- "Rotating a map and linking a north arrow" - the same...
...

What do you think about shortening or removing some tips?
I think that for better remembering and understanding of QGIS funkcionality
is important to have brief and clear tips.

Hi Jana!

You are very welcome to shorten this tips and write new ones.
I think this part of QGIS has not been paid a lot attention since it has
been created so if you'd like to take it.

Either make a pull request or send your suggestions to me and I will take
care of them..

Thanks a lot for pointing this out ..

Hi Paolo,

I will try to upgrade Lizmap tomorrow, when I can figure out how I can have
one plugin versino for each QGIS 1.8 and future 2 in the plugin repository.

The howTo [1] is very usefull and comprehensive. Though I have not
understand yet if I can send 2 ZIP files with different metadata (one zip
for each version) but with the same plugin name, the same plugin version
(eg one 2.9 for QGIS 2 and another 2.9 for QGIS 1.8), etc.  Does the plugin
repository manage this ? How 2 plugins called "Lizmap" would be displayed
in the list of plugins in plugins.qgis.org ?

If you are developing your plugin for QGIS 2.0+, there is now an option to
set the font family and size used in the application under Options>>General
dialog. This font is set using Qt stylesheets [0]. I believe this was also
the case with QGIS 1.8, but the font was the default for the platform and
not easily changeable. There is currently no documentation about this in
the PyQGIS Cookbook, but basically you can try these two following
approaches:

* Any widget that is a child of the main application or one of its widgets
(e.g. iface or app's QMainWindow) will inherit the font set in Options. To
override, set a custom stylesheet for your widgets or their components. Try
to avoid wildcard assignment of styles, i.e. " * { color: #fff; } " OR "
color:#fff; ", as this will cause the widget to not use the host window
server's applied style and you will then have to style most aspects of the
widget starting with a Qt-style default.

Instead, use something like " QLabel { color: #fff; } " or one of the other
non-wildcard (aka non-universal) Qt stylesheet selectors [1]. You can set
the stylesheet in Qt Designer or in the .ui editor in Qt Creator.

When working with font sizes, opt to honor the user's chosen app font
setting, i.e. just like styling with CSS define the sizes using em or ex
units so they are relative to the app font [2]. This will ensure the sizing
works across most platforms and differing screen resolutions.

* Don't set the parent for your widget. This will most likely cause the
widget to *not* inherit the app's stylesheet. (This is probably why your
dialogs were not having their style overridden, if you didn't set a
parent.) However, it is generally best practice to assign a parent to a
widget, so I would avoid this approach and go with local stylesheet
overrides as noted above.

NOTE: stylesheets generally override any similarly set Qt widget style
properties.

Hi,
I haven't noticed earlier the repository section is confusing. I'll fix it, for 
now just be aware here is the only truth below:

You should upload the two versions with the same name and only set 
qgisMinimumVersion to 1.x and 2.0:

You usually DON'T NEED to set qgisMaximumVersion. QGIS assumes the plugin is 
compatible with qgisMinimumVersion and any higher within the major version, so 
your two plugins will be compatible with QGIS 1.x - 1.99 and 2.0 - 2.99. 
Another words, the qgisMaximumVersion is set automatically to 
floor(qgisMinimumVersion) + 0.99
This way any QGIS version is compatible with only one of the two plugins.

Now about your question: QGIS 2.0 contacts the repository by url:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=2.0
so the repo only returns plugins compatible with the requested version.

QGIS 1.8 doesn't attach the ?qgis=2.0 parameter, so we made the repo assuming 
1.8 by default. Yes, " http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml " will only 
return plugins compatible with QGIS 1.8.

Hi Larry
Problem solved by specifying the styleSheet. Thank you very much for your help and your detailed explanations!

Hello



I am working on a QGIS Python plugin and I have a problem concerning font sizes. With QDialogs I have no problem to set the font sizes. But as soon as I work with a QDockWidget and add it to QGIS every font size settings are ignored. Qt Creator shows the correct font sizes but QGIS seems to overwrite these settings. Does this behaviour have a reason and is there a possibility to prevent QGIS from overwriting these font size settings? Thank you very much.


If you are developing your plugin for QGIS 2.0+, there is now an option to set the font family and size used in the application under Options>>General dialog. This font is set using Qt stylesheets [0]. I believe this was also the case with QGIS 1.8, but the font was the default for the platform and not easily changeable. There is currently no documentation about this in the PyQGIS Cookbook, but basically you can try these two following approaches:


* Any widget that is a child of the main application or one of its widgets (e.g. iface or app's QMainWindow) will inherit the font set in Options. To override, set a custom stylesheet for your widgets or their components. Try to avoid wildcard assignment of styles, i.e. " * { color: #fff; } " OR " color:#fff; ", as this will cause the widget to not use the host window server's applied style and you will then have to style most aspects of the widget starting with a Qt-style default.


Instead, use something like " QLabel { color: #fff; } " or one of the other non-wildcard (aka non-universal) Qt stylesheet selectors [1]. You can set the stylesheet in Qt Designer or in the .ui editor in Qt Creator.


When working with font sizes, opt to honor the user's chosen app font setting, i.e. just like styling with CSS define the sizes using em or ex units so they are relative to the app font [2]. This will ensure the sizing works across most platforms and differing screen resolutions.


* Don't set the parent for your widget. This will most likely cause the widget to *not* inherit the app's stylesheet. (This is probably why your dialogs were not having their style overridden, if you didn't set a parent.) However, it is generally best practice to assign a parent to a widget, so I would avoid this approach and go with local stylesheet overrides as noted above.


NOTE: stylesheets generally override any similarly set Qt widget style properties.

Hi I'm Luigi Pirelli

I'm porting rt_mapserver_export to the new 2.0 SIP api

I found another case where it's necessary to pay attention (and could be
added in the wiki:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20

as the case before about floats, a simple replace could create problems
because

variable.to<Type> returns a tuple (value, <check on value[true|fase]>)

so, in case in the old style plugin, the code has this (as in
rt_mapserver_export)

(returnValue, returnCheck) = variable.to<type>

doing upgrade to 2.0 as in wiki page produce

(returnValue, returnCheck) = variable   # <--- generates a unique value or
exception

instead of a tuple

generate a runtime error: "ValueError: too many values to unpack"

so the wiki could show another option like this one:

before
(returnValue, returnCheck) = variable.to<type>

after
returnValue = variable
returnCheck = isinstance(variable, <type>)

or

returnCheck = true
try:
      returnValue = variable
except ValueError:
      returnCheck = false

I didn't check for all the types

ciao Luigi Pirelli

ps: I hope my is English is enough understandable

Hi.

I'm doing a external project using qgis libraries, and I want the user not
to zoom out more than a given extent or not to zoom in more than the base
raster resolution.

Is there a way to force the user to stay into a defined max/min zoom
levels? Or have I to overwrite the zoom tools and capture the wheel event
to do what I want?

Thanks.

Hey Jodi,

You could listen to the
extentsChanged<http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html#a2a91ee382ce605e3382b74693f9c4d80>
event
on the mapcanvas.  When the extents change check them and if they are out
of bounds zoom the user back in.

- Nathan

the previous code doesn't raise any ValueError without an explicit cast.

If conversion goes wrong you should get None (at least with the latest
API changes), so the check just becomes:

<code>
returnCheck = returnValue is not None
</code>


Another way is to add an explicit cast (e.g. to float):

<code>
try:
    returnValue = float(variable)
except ValueError:
    returnCheck = false
</code>

I am trying to move features in a Qt timer without success. What it is
missing?

 

Below all my trials to make this work.  

 

 
//pointMarkersLayer->dataProvider()->changeGeometryValues(geomMap);

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

                    

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->changeGeometry(featureRoute_p.id(),
geometry);

       //pointMarkersLayer->moveVertex(finalPoint.x(), finalPoint.y(),
featureRoute_p.id(), 0);

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->changeGeometry(featureRoute_p.id(),
geometry);

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

       //categorizedSymbolRendererV2->renderFeature(featureRoute_p,
QgsRenderContext(), pointMarkersLayer->id().toInt(), false, false);

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->startEditing();

       //pointMarkersLayer->select(featureRoute_p.id(), false);

 

       //featureRoute_p.setGeometry(QgsGeometry::fromPoint(finalPoint));

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

 

       //float dx = finalPoint.x() -
featureRoute_p.geometry()->asPoint().x();

       //float dy = finalPoint.y() -
featureRoute_p.geometry()->asPoint().y();

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->translateFeature(featureRoute_p.id(), dx,
dy);

Hi Marco,

This is working for me, don't know if is the best option:

//_vector Layer is a point layer in memory
 _vectorLayer->startEditing();
 QgsGeometryMap m;
//Pass the feature id and the new x,y
 m.insert(feature.id(),*QgsGeometry::fromPoint(QgsPoint(x,y)));
 _vectorLayer->dataProvider()->changeGeometryValues(m);
 _contactLayer->updateExtents();
 _contactLayer->commitChanges();
 _contactLayer.triggerRepaint();

Hope it helps.

One more thing:

It should be _vectorLayer instead of _contactLayer in the last three lines.

Cheers.

Hi all,

This is a little odd. When hitting reply in this list the reply is sent to
the list poster, not to the whole list. Is this an intended behaviour?

The vast majority of the lists I'm subscribed to does not work this way. I
think there exist options to tweak the list behaviour.

Cheers.

Thank you Jordi!

 

But i am using a point memory layer as you mention but using special
markers as defined below, and the code that you propose me, do not
worked and my features with the symbols do not move. I need to have any
kind of special consideration when moving feature points with marker
symbols attached?

 

//create Vector layer in memory for adding iamge markers

QgsVectorLayer *symbolsLayer = new QgsVectorLayer("Point",
"temporairy_points", "memory");

 

QgsVectorDataProvider *provider = symbolsLayer->dataProvider();

 

//create new feature

QgsFeature feature = QgsFeature();

 

QgsPoint point =
ui.qgsMapCanvas->getCoordinateTransform()->toMapCoordinates(e->pos().x()
, e->pos().y());

QgsGeometry *geometry = geometry->fromPoint(point);         

feature.setGeometry(geometry);

 

QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2 svgMarkersymbolLayerV2 = new
QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2(QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath () +
"/data/symbols/test.svg");

 

QgsSymbolLayerV2List symbolLayerV2List;

symbolLayerV2List.clear();

symbolLayerV2List.append(svgMarkersymbolLayerV2);

 

QgsMarkerSymbolV2 *markerSymbolV2 = new
QgsMarkerSymbolV2(symbolLayerV2List);

 

QgsRendererCategoryV2 *rendererCategoryV2 = new QgsRendererCategoryV2(0,
markerSymbolV2, "0");

 

QgsCategoryList categoryList;

categoryList.clear();

categoryList.append(*rendererCategoryV2);

 

QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2 *categorizedSymbolRendererV2 = new
QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2("A", categoryList);

 

symbolsLayer->startEditing();

symbolsLayer->setRendererV2(categorizedSymbolRendererV2);               

symbolsLayer->addAttribute(QgsField("A", QVariant::String, "String", 4,
0, ""));

 

QList<QgsField> lstFields;

lstFields.insert(0, QgsField("A", QVariant::String, "String", 4, 0,
""));

provider->addAttributes(lstFields);

 

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->startRender(QgsRenderContext(),
symbolsLayer);

 

feature.clearAttributeMap();

QgsAttributeMap attributeMap;

attributeMap.insert(0, "0");

feature.setAttributeMap(attributeMap);

 

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->renderFeature(feature, QgsRenderContext(),
symbolsLayer->id().toInt(), false, false);

 

QgsFeatureList qgsfeaturesList = QgsFeatureList();

qgsfeaturesList.append(feature);

provider->addFeatures(qgsfeaturesList);

 

symbolsLayer->updateExtents();

 

// Add the Vector Layer to the Layer Registry

QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(symbolsLayer, false);

 

myLayerSet.prepend(QgsMapCanvasLayer(symbolsLayer, true));

 

// Set the Map Canvas Layer Set

ui.qgsMapCanvas->setLayerSet(myLayerSet);

Hi Marco,

I'm using  categorized symbology too, the only difference I see is that I'm
not calling

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->startRender(QgsRenderContext(), symbolsLayer);

nor

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->renderFeature(feature, QgsRenderContext(),
symbolsLayer->id().toInt(), false, false);

Maybe you can try a simple example with default simbology and see if it
works ok, and then try to port it to your code. Anyway I'm new to qgis too,
so not an expert here :)

Cheers.

Yes, this is an option that can be changed by the administrator (header 
munging).

The option chosen by this list is to keep the original header with the 
real sender. This is pretty old school, now most lists are set up to 
replace the sender by the list address, to facilitate answers to the 
list. Judging by the number of mistakes, the current setup is not at all 
intuitive for most users and I would support a change to the most common 
behavior of defaulting reply to the list address.

Regards,

Leyan

Thank you Jordi for you help.

 

I finally solve my problem and your algorithm work fine (beside a little
slow refreshing....not sure if I could improve the refresh update to be
quicker and not flicking...).

 

My problem, were in the figure id that I am using! In my application i
set the figure id, during it's creation, but Qgis internally, modify it
and remade the numeration starting by 1. Not sure if this is a good
behavior or bug.

Thank you Jordi!

 

But i am using a point memory layer as you mention but using special
markers as defined below, and the code that you propose me, do not
worked and my features with the symbols do not move. I need to have any
kind of special consideration when moving feature points with marker
symbols attached?

 

//create Vector layer in memory for adding iamge markers

QgsVectorLayer *symbolsLayer = new QgsVectorLayer("Point",
"temporairy_points", "memory");

 

QgsVectorDataProvider *provider = symbolsLayer->dataProvider();

 

//create new feature

QgsFeature feature = QgsFeature();

 

QgsPoint point =
ui.qgsMapCanvas->getCoordinateTransform()->toMapCoordinates(e->pos().x()
, e->pos().y());

QgsGeometry *geometry = geometry->fromPoint(point);         

feature.setGeometry(geometry);

 

QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2 svgMarkersymbolLayerV2 = new
QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayerV2(QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath () +
"/data/symbols/test.svg");

 

QgsSymbolLayerV2List symbolLayerV2List;

symbolLayerV2List.clear();

symbolLayerV2List.append(svgMarkersymbolLayerV2);

 

QgsMarkerSymbolV2 *markerSymbolV2 = new
QgsMarkerSymbolV2(symbolLayerV2List);

 

QgsRendererCategoryV2 *rendererCategoryV2 = new QgsRendererCategoryV2(0,
markerSymbolV2, "0");

 

QgsCategoryList categoryList;

categoryList.clear();

categoryList.append(*rendererCategoryV2);

 

QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2 *categorizedSymbolRendererV2 = new
QgsCategorizedSymbolRendererV2("A", categoryList);

 

symbolsLayer->startEditing();

symbolsLayer->setRendererV2(categorizedSymbolRendererV2);               

symbolsLayer->addAttribute(QgsField("A", QVariant::String, "String", 4,
0, ""));

 

QList<QgsField> lstFields;

lstFields.insert(0, QgsField("A", QVariant::String, "String", 4, 0,
""));

provider->addAttributes(lstFields);

 

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->startRender(QgsRenderContext(),
symbolsLayer);

 

feature.clearAttributeMap();

QgsAttributeMap attributeMap;

attributeMap.insert(0, "0");

feature.setAttributeMap(attributeMap);

 

categorizedSymbolRendererV2->renderFeature(feature, QgsRenderContext(),
symbolsLayer->id().toInt(), false, false);

 

QgsFeatureList qgsfeaturesList = QgsFeatureList();

qgsfeaturesList.append(feature);

provider->addFeatures(qgsfeaturesList);

 

symbolsLayer->updateExtents();

 

// Add the Vector Layer to the Layer Registry

QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(symbolsLayer, false);

 

myLayerSet.prepend(QgsMapCanvasLayer(symbolsLayer, true));

 

// Set the Map Canvas Layer Set

One more thing:


It should be _vectorLayer instead of _contactLayer in the last three
lines.

Cheers.

 

2013/6/14 Jordi Torres <jtorresfabra at gmail.com>

OOPs forgot to send it to the list.

 

Hi Marco, 

This is working for me, don't know if is the best option:

//_vector Layer is a point layer in memory

 _vectorLayer->startEditing();
 QgsGeometryMap m;

//Pass the feature id and the new x,y

 m.insert(feature.id(),*QgsGeometry::fromPoint(QgsPoint(x,y)));
 _vectorLayer->dataProvider()->changeGeometryValues(m);
 _contactLayer->updateExtents();
 _contactLayer->commitChanges();

 _contactLayer.triggerRepaint();

Hope it helps.

 

2013/6/14 Marco Gomes <marco.gomes at edisoft.pt>

I am trying to move features in a Qt timer without success. What it is
missing?

 

Below all my trials to make this work.  

 

 
//pointMarkersLayer->dataProvider()->changeGeometryValues(geomMap);

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

                    

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->changeGeometry(featureRoute_p.id(),

       //pointMarkersLayer->moveVertex(finalPoint.x(), finalPoint.y(),
featureRoute_p.id(), 0);

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->changeGeometry(featureRoute_p.id(),

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

       //categorizedSymbolRendererV2->renderFeature(featureRoute_p,
QgsRenderContext(), pointMarkersLayer->id().toInt(), false, false);

 

       //pointMarkersLayer->startEditing();

       //pointMarkersLayer->select(featureRoute_p.id(), false);

 

       //featureRoute_p.setGeometry(QgsGeometry::fromPoint(finalPoint));

       //pointMarkersLayer->updateFeature(featureRoute_p);

 

       //float dx = finalPoint.x() -
featureRoute_p.geometry()->asPoint().x();

       //float dy = finalPoint.y() -

Yes, the refresh process is quite improved in the master version of Qgis,
it seems it now uses a backbuffer to render. I guess you are using 1.8 and
that's the reason of the flickering. I finally jumped to master branch and
I'm quite happy.

I think this is a feature, not a bug :). Shapefiles starts to indexing at
1.

I have done some more fixing of GdalTools.

What remains are the algorithms in the Conversion and Analysis menus - most
work left is tedious work changing QString->str and QStringList->list

help and testing would be appreciated. Any volunteers?

Hi all.
I think I spotted a recently introduced bug: fonts in qgs-server are bigger than in
the client. Confirmed in two differen tinstallation (une Debian and one RH).
Could anyone confirm? Should I open a ticket?

Me too.

Using qgis-dev on pc windows 7 with font "Liberation".
And moving the project on a qgis-server (linux redhat es)
the generated map on wms request has font bigger (about 40%).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Python API , "modernity" and Python 2.6.x
Message-ID: <1371288816188-5060306.post@n6.nabble.com>

I know that one must be absolutely "modern" (using Python 2.7.x,  too bad for
the others) but the master version of QGIS for Mac Os X is based on the
standard Apple Python, and , unfortunately for me and others, in Snow
Leopard (10.6) it is the version 2.6.
So the first time i try to open the Python console, the result is:

       errors...
       File
"/Users/Shared/QGIS_2.0-dev_SnoLeo.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/console/console_output.py",
line 137, in insertInitText
    "## Type help(iface) for more info and list of
methods.\n".format(sys.version,  socket.gethostname()))
ValueError: zero length field name in format

and no Python console for me. Why ?

The problem is the line 137 of console_output.py and specially *{} on {}*
which is for Python 2.7.x:
          txtInit = QCoreApplication.translate("PythonConsole",
                                             "*Python {} on {}*\n"
                                             "## Type help(iface) for more
info and list of methods.\n".format(sys.version,  socket.gethostname()))


Forget the new API ?, upgrade Mac OS X ?, no,  because it is very easy  to
make a command  that works in the two versions (2.7 and 2.6):

          txtInit = QCoreApplication.translate("PythonConsole",
                                            "Python {*0*} on {*0*}\n"*
                                             "## Type help(iface) for more
info and list of methods.\n".format(sys.version,  socket.gethostname()))

and:

Mmm, 2.6 I would not call that modern. Better try to do a pull request 
to Apple (mmm, can not find there repo on Github) for 2.7 or 3.0 ;-)

But seriously, if (as a dev) you run a system with a 2.7 python 
yourself, it is just hard to keep up with all the little tricks you have 
to do just to be backwords compatible. You just do not see when it goes 
wrong in 2.6...

And agreed, your fix seems trivial, and I think that is the power of 
using OpenSource and Github. You can have a look into the source, and 
even better (in your case) fix it \o/

Please clone the QGIS repo in github:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/python/console/console_output.py#L135

push your fix and then ask for a so called 'pull request'. If your fix 
does not have any by-effects for other (really modern) python versions, 
I think the devs are really happy to add it.

I'm happy to help you with the Github stuff, or if it is really too much 
fuss for you now, I can do this for you.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps the hill can be a little steep to add these little fixes for the 
first time, but QGIS get's only better by this.

Thanks Nathan, I am not a GitHub professional. I realize now that the 
correct formulation is (it is a detail):

  Python {0} on {*1*}\n

As In my work, I must use multiple versions of Python according to users
(from 2.6 to 3.3), I use simple correspondences between them (in fact, for a
Python programmer, there is no great differences between the 2.6.x and the
2.7.x versions, except ease-of-use.  The 3.x version is other thing, but no
more difficult)

Some examples:

    in Python 2.7.x : {i: line_string for i, line_string in
enumerate(line_strings)}
    in Python 2.6.x : dict((i, line_string) for (i, line_string) in
enumerate(line_strings))

    in Python 2.7.x : {collection.name: collection or collection in
collections}
    in Python 2.6.x : dict((collection.name,collection)) for collection in
collections})

   in Python 2.7.x : ['+{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in
geom.proj4_params.iteritems()]
   in Python 2.6.x : ['+{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in
geom.proj4_params.iteritems()]

So, If I encounter other problems,  I would point you to the solutions.

And congratulations for the geom.exportToGeoJSON() (now we can use the
geo_interface (GeoJSON-like) protocol of Sean Gillies (see  PyShp as Fiona
(with the GeoJSON-like protocol)
<https://github.com/mlaloux/PyShp-as-Fiona--with-geo_interface->  ))

We plan to update our plugins (OpenLayers, WPS Client, etc.) during the 
Hackfest in Brighton. See also http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8059.

Hi,

I'm a bit worried about not having a functioning Openlayers plugin in QGIS
2.0 for two months.
Can someone with experience in porting plugins estimate how much work it
really is to make it compatible with the new API?
I think it would put a lot of people off if they cannot use "their
background layers" anymore.

Best wishes,
Anita

Agreed - in fact, I think OLP is so important that it should be included in master
(for QGIS 2.1, at this point).
Objections?
All the best.

I don't think OLP should be included in master.
OLP is important for some users but for better compatibility I think they
should use the OGR WMS driver for OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps and others.
We can integrate in QGIS 2.1 a layer listing menu with some predefined
layers, isn't it ?

Hi Pirmin,

if we manage to release 2.0 before Brighton, I agree that the Openlayers 
plugin is one plugin which should be available at 2.0 launch.

Here locally I managed to get it running in current master (most of it, 
overview widget is not ok yet).
But I do not want to force/stress Sourcepole or Matthias to put time in 
looking into it if they have more important things to do.

And maybe you have (bigger/other) plans with the plugin, like a 
refactoring or upgrade of bigger parts of the code. Or maybe you know 
with QGIS 2.0 there are non sip parts that will give problems?
I can also imagine that you really want to support only ONE plugin 
working for both sip api versions.

But that said, I'm happy to put what I have now put on Github and ask 
for a pull request in a 2.0 branch (what I did is NOT compatible with 
1.8). I'm also available if bugs pop up in that version in short future.

And I agree that Brighton is then a nice place to do the 'bigger' work 
for this really important plugin.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I agree, not having Openlayers would be a sufficient reason not to 
upgrade for me.

According to Tims latest plan I don't expect the 2.0 release before Brighton.
So the OL plugin should be ready for 2.0 early enough.

We're happy to integrate a pull request earlier. But as statet in the ticket, 
the patch has to be backwards compatible with 1.8. It is no option for us to 
maintain our plugins for two QGIS versions in parallel. This is some initial 
extra work, but will help us during the coming years to keep 1.8 users up to 
date.

Hello Antonio!

My icons library will be ready in one week. I'm working on metadane right
now. I'll let you know when I finished.

I plan to put theme here:

Hi QGIS developers,

You probably know that OSGeo's so-called ?C-tribe? gather once a year for a 
codesprint. It usually takes place in North America (Seattle, Boston for last 
ones).
As for 2014, there are two options, being Philadelphia, and a European city 
this time : Vienna.
Vienna would be an opportunity to include more QGIS developers to this event, 
as it's easier for the majority of QGIS devs to go to Austria than the US. It 
would be a great opportunity to discuss and code things for more integration 
between FOSS4G components !

Paul set up a doodle to know who would be interested to come to each of both 
locations :
http://www.doodle.com/ky3eh797mtsrx3bn

Can you answer the poll so that organizers know if one of the venue could be 
problematic ?

Here is Paul's email for more context if you need :
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/tosprint/2013-June/000445.html

And by the way, Vienna is a really nice city (ok, I'm biased ;)

Vincent

done, thanks Vincent. I agree that being more connected to the rest of OSGeo could be
a Good Thing.

Hi Joaquim,
great news someone has compiled qgis on 64bit Win. Would you mind sharing your sript
and howto, for its possible consolidation? Would you be interested in collaborating
preparing a package?
Thanking you in advance.

Hi,

I built a 64 bits version using pure native dependencies, that is everything id build
with VS2010 64 bits.
Although it seams to work fine the exe crash on exit but writes a minidump file (~8 Mb).
I can upload the dump if anyone is interested.

Hi laurentyu,

please be a little more verbose :-)
also if you plan to create it as an issue.

Which version are you running on which distro (I see it is Linux...).
What exactly should we do to reproduce it.

With me, current version (own build of yesterday) here on Debian is not 
crashing. So I can not confirm your problem here yet

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] iteration over a layer's features in python plugins
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQbyqf9gY7iwaitQNcSWRoJgDyc3iPkFpj1gPaD0znCmgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

When building plugins that operate on vector layers, it is a common pattern
to include a checkbox in the plugin's GUI where the user can choose to
perform the plugin analysis on the whole layer or just using the currently
selected features (see for example most fTools dialogs).

However, I think the QGIS API does not make the implementation of this
pattern as easy as it could be. The QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures() method
returns an iterator but the QgsVectorLayer.selectedFeatures() returns a
list. It would be nice if they both returned an iterator.

When working with all the features in a layer, I  use:

feat = QgsFeature()
feat_iterator = v_layer.getFeatures()
while feat_iterator.nextFeature(feat):
    # do stuff with the feature

When working with only the currently selected features the code is like:

selected_feats = v_layer.selectedFeatures()
for feat in selected_feats:
    # do stuff with the feature

Since QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures can take a QgsFeatureRequest as argument,
I think a nice solution could be to add one more filter to
QgsFeatureRequest to allow iterating over a list of feature ids. It
currently already allows to pass in a single feature id, it would just be a
matter of expanding that.

In the meantime I am using a custom iterator class[1] in Python that wraps
this different behaviour and lets me use the same logic for processing the
whole layer or just the selected features. I think it would be cleaner if
this could be done on the API side.

Maybe I am asking for too much too late because of the feature freeze for
2.0?

I've got that functionality ready in a separate branch but it will have 
to wait for 2.1 due to the feature freeze as you mentioned

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin installer: cannot load from local
 repository when proxy is set
Message-ID: <45deb969ed9d6d6e2a1969eabb4282d4@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I have a problem when using a local repository when a proxy is set. It 
 seems that the proxy exceptions are not honored.

 I created an issue:
 http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8092

 In the proxy tab there is a list of proxy exceptions and this seems to 
 be ignored.

 Thank you if someone with knowledge on the Python plugin installer 
 could have a look at this problem.

 Andreas

Are we really talking September now?
I'm just asking because then I will stop telling people that 2.0 should be
out "soon".

 bits build on Windows crash on exit

Hi Paulo,

Sure I'm interested to help in what I can but let me explain first how I did
my build and the troubles that I crossed.

1. The most troublesome task is to build all the dependencies. It happens
that I have most of them because they are common to GDAL. I can share them
but because the DLL hell bit me so many times, I now build all my dll with a
non-standard name.  Basically I prefix them either _w32 or _64

2. Instead of using the cmake gui, I have a ConfigUser.cmake that is
included in the main CMakeLists.txt. I include the contents of that script
at the end of this message because on the nabble interface I don't find an
"attach" button.

3. In my case and exactly to be able to build 32 and 64 bits versions of
other programs, I use a portable version of python but that should not be a
major issue ... as long as users don't try to build 64 bits versions and
have a 32 bits python in their path.

4. With all the dependencies and the ConfigUser.cmake things do NOT yet run
out of the box. There are currently two problems that I addressed first in
#7523 and repeated on #8084
The first one deals with fact that SQLITE3_INCLUDE_DIR is ignored (not sure
anymore about the SPATIALITE_INCLUDE_DIR) causing errors of heders not
found. The second one is more annoying as sip is not detected (I insist it's
not my fault, it's what python replies to in the 'questions' asked in
FindSIP.py) and I had to manually fix the makefiles by inserting the correct
paths.

5. As also mentioned in #7523 there will be the error
   NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '..\..\output\bin\crssync.EXE' : return code
'0xc0000139'
this is tricky and is caused by the fact that PyQt ships with old versions
of  QtCore4 and QtGui4.dll that are caught first in the path than those in
the Qt(64) directory. The only way out I found was to temporarily move those
DLLs out of the way (just renamed them).

OK, at this point I was able to build but than came the issue raised in
#8085 It turns out that what was causing the crash was the fact that since I
use a portable version of python and don't have in the path by default
(that's the whole idea of using portable versions) there was no python
visible when I executed the qgis.exe. However, if I do not apply the patch
indicated  by Jurgen (the if ( myPythonUtils) ) and call the qgis.exe from
the shell window used to make the build (and that therefore knows where
python is) than qgis dies immediately after the splash screen shows up. So
there is another problem here that can be circumvented by the conditional
patch but that still exists.

So, let me know what I can do more to help

Joaquim

and now the script (note that I use a naming convention for directories and
dlls that allows me to easily build 32 or 64 bits with the same script)

You don't need go use a while, I don't know why people keep using that
pattern when a simple for will do and is cleaner.

For f in layer.getFeatures:

No it just comes down to

If selected:
features = layers.selectedFeatures()[]
Else:
features = layer.getFeatures()

plugins
Hi list

When building plugins that operate on vector layers, it is a common pattern
to include a checkbox in the plugin's GUI where the user can choose to
perform the plugin analysis on the whole layer or just using the currently
selected features (see for example most fTools dialogs).

However, I think the QGIS API does not make the implementation of this
pattern as easy as it could be. The QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures() method
returns an iterator but the QgsVectorLayer.selectedFeatures() returns a
list. It would be nice if they both returned an iterator.

When working with all the features in a layer, I  use:

feat = QgsFeature()
feat_iterator = v_layer.getFeatures()
while feat_iterator.nextFeature(feat):
    # do stuff with the feature

When working with only the currently selected features the code is like:

selected_feats = v_layer.selectedFeatures()
for feat in selected_feats:
    # do stuff with the feature

Since QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures can take a QgsFeatureRequest as argument,
I think a nice solution could be to add one more filter to
QgsFeatureRequest to allow iterating over a list of feature ids. It
currently already allows to pass in a single feature id, it would just be a
matter of expanding that.

In the meantime I am using a custom iterator class[1] in Python that wraps
this different behaviour and lets me use the same logic for processing the
whole layer or just the selected features. I think it would be cleaner if
this could be done on the API side.

Maybe I am asking for too much too late because of the feature freeze for
2.0?

Well currently there are 66 blocking issues in the queue. That means
we either need to follow Marco H's suggestion of having a time based
cut off for blockers, or we need to wait an indeterminate time. Once
the PSC has agreed on which way we will continue, we will post a more
precise timeline. I would certainly like to see QGIS 2.0 released
*before* FOSS4G2013.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] EPSG 4326 coordinate ordering
Message-ID: <SNT143-W55543D04A72CEC0B81648A5830@phx.gbl>

Hello devs 
 
I got into a bit of problems today trying to render a GML file, I get the features in the wrong position. (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2WxCPuMM8hEanNmSDUyVU1JRFk/edit?usp=sharing)  image
(https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2WxCPuMM8hEQkhDWUNmSEM5Qkk/edit?usp=sharing  ) gml file for France airports
 
After investigating a bit I found that 
"EPSG:4326 specifically states that the coordinate order should be latitude, longitude. Many software packages still use longitude, latitude ordering" which seems to be the case for Proj4 which is used in QGIS
+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs Now my question is how can I have the correct definition for EPSG 4326 to use? Should I create a custom CRS and how? Using windows 

Thanks for your time

Thanks for the tip Nathan!

I thought the while loop was necessary because we had to call
QgsFeatureIterator.nextFeature() and just now realized that the for loop
will do it implicitly. I thought that would work only for python
iterators... I guess QgsFeatureIterator is one of them ;)

Hi Richard,
If you have a - partially - working version please share it. It will serve
until the official and backwards compatible version is available.

You don't need to use a while loop.  I'm really not sure people keep using
that pattern when you don't need to and makes you code more complicated.
list and iterator have the same next() method so they act the same
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/python/core/qgsfeatureiterator.sip#L12

You can just do:

for f in layer.getFeatures():

So now if you want to just get the selected or all you can do:

if getselection:
   features = layer.selectedFeatures()
else:
  features = layer.getFeatures()

So I hate/gald to say that your FeatureIterator is not neeeded because it
is built into QgsFeatureIterator.

Nathan

Hi list

What is the recommended way to show a help dialog in a plugin?

The pyqgis cookbook[1] advises using the qgis.utils.showPluginHelp()
function. However, this function calls iface.openURL(), which logs a
DeprecationWarning, so I guess it should not be used anymore.

Is there another recommended way?

Hi,

On my side, I generally direct the user to a website using:

QDesktopServices().openUrl(QUrl("http://.....))

updated with the new selection. If you, after running the algorithm,
manually press the Refresh map button the selection becomes visibly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] little fix in tip
Message-ID: <51C032F9.3070301@duif.net>


During translation I came along this tip:

QGIS has plugins that extend its functionality. QGIS ships with some 
core plugins you can explore from the Plugins->Manage Plugins menu. In 
addition there are over 150 Python plugins contributed by the user 
community that can be installed from the Plugins->Fetch Python Plugins 
menu. Don't miss out on all QGIS has to offer---check out the plugins 
and see what they can do for you.

The name of the menu-item changed, so I think I should be something like:

QGIS has plugins that extend its functionality. QGIS ships with some 
core plugins you can explore and activate from the Plugins->Manage and 
Install Plugins menu. In addition there are over 150 Python plugins 
contributed by the user community that can be installed via this same 
menu. Don't miss out on all QGIS has to offer---check out the plugins

I fear a pull request would not make it, so maybe someone with direct 
commit rights change this (and or the text)?

References: <51C02BE8.5010003@c-s.fr>

Hello,

Recently, I had a problem while clipping a non georeferenced image based 
on (0,0), x right, y down, because of the negative coordinates.
On the clipping tool, a tip consists in removing the minus of the 
coordinates in the expression of the command gdal_translate to run.

It works fine with a vrt written on disk.
When I try to clip a vrt memory, the clipping tool writes all the vrt in 
the expression of the command to run (that is ok).
When I run the clipping, I get this :
>
> Warning 1: Line 0: Attribute value should be single or double quoted. 
> Going on, but this is invalid XML that might be rejected in future 
> versions.
> ERROR 1: Line 0: Didn't find expected '=' for value of attribute '\'.
> GDALOpen failed - 1
> Line 0: Didn't find expected '=' for value of attribute '\'.
>
But here's the thing, it works fine from a terminal.

In the clipping tool, when I change all protected double quotes \", to 
simple quotes ', the clipping works fine.

It seems to be an anomaly of the clipping tool.

Thanks in advance,
Alexia

The following request works:

while this one does not (returns a white page):

Am I doing something wrong?

Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E12BBFFCCC8@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

Currently when I run make the unit tests (unbuntu) the delimited text python tests are running under SIP API version 1, or possibly some sort of strange mixture, and seem to be failing.  So if I do

from PyQt4.QtCore import QVariant
import sip

print sip.getapi('QVariant')

I get '1'.  I see sip as a setapi function, which I guess I should be using to set the API I want.  Anyone know how to use it?

Thanks
Chris

Ok I've found it at

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6238193/pyqt-new-api-with-python-2

Looks like I need to add

import sip
API_NAMES = ["QDate", "QDateTime", "QString", "QTextStream", "QTime", "QUrl", "QVariant"]
API_VERSION = 2
for name in API_NAMES:
    sip.setapi(name, API_VERSION)

before importing from PyQt4.QtCore.  And also to not try and import QString.

Seems to be working..

Hey Chris,

Yes I forgot to mention that any standalone pyqgis scripts, like the unit
tests, will need to have the sip version set before PyQt4 is imported.  On
Python < 3 PyQt4 will automatically set its SIP version to 1.  In Python >
3 this will change but for now you will have to set it your self.

What I did think of doing was setting the SIP version in qgis.core so that
if you import them first then everything is set for you.  What are your
thoughts on doing this?

Hi Paolo,

There was a bug opened about this problem :
Bug #8027: qgis-server don't understand correctly the relative path in a 
spatialite db

This bug has been closed because he was not enough generic.

Hi all.
Many of us have been contacted by this publisher, to author a QGIS book. While this
interest is obviously a sign of QGIS success, it seems quite strange that so many
people are asked the same thing. I asked clarifications to the publisher, and got no
reply.
All the best.

Hello,

I test the new QGIS features for the user manual 2.0.0. Working with
the QGIS browser I found that the 'Filter Files' feature either doesn't
work or that I don't use it properly. Is it possible that the function
still is in development?

Can someone please explain?

This is a different thing. Relative pathes _within_ the project should 
be considered if project path setting is 'relative pathes'. (I remember 
that was fixed somewhen for spatialite).

 >I'm finding problems in using relative paths in qgis mapserver.

Relative pathes _to_ the project file are currently not supported 
(though it is easy to resolve the relative pathes). What is your 
use-case? Do you have several different server instances on your machine?

Marco

	12 month contract
Message-ID: <CALCNqkZGFOWJ9XaAGem5851qvLMtXf1Et2ycTnUTB4Zyo4cr1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If you are an Indonesian python developer looking for work, there is a job
going here at AIFDR (central Jakarta) that may be interesting for you.
Please pass this along to anyone you think may be interested. Please do NOT
reply to this message on this list, but rather direct your enquiries to
Kristy van Putten whose email address is provided at the end of the job
description below.

*TOR/Duty Statement*



*Software Developer*

*for*

*InaSAFE ? Indonesia Scenario Assessment for Emergencies*



*Background*


? The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is a
joint initiative of the  Governments of Australia and Indonesia that
addresses Indonesia and Australia?s shared  concern over the growing impact
of disasters in the region. AIFDR aims to build Indonesia?s  capacity to
self-manage disasters by strengthening national and local capacity in
disaster risk reduction in Indonesia and the region. AIFDR is a partnership
between the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and
Indonesia?s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).

? BNPB has identified a priority need to improve its methodology for
contingency planning with an emphasis on the use of realistic disaster
scenarios as the starting point for contingency planning. BNPB has been
working with AIFDR and the World Bank on a methodology and associated
software tools for developing realistic disaster scenarios for contingency
planning.

? The scenario development methodology has been implemented in a simple,
open-source software tool  InaSAFE. This software is based on
straightforward and standardised approaches to integrating hazard and
exposure data to estimate a range of impacts of a possible disaster
scenario including the:

o number of people likely to need emergency shelter;
o amount of food, water, sanitation, etc required in line with BNPB?s PERKA
no. 7/2008;
o number of schools and hospitals likely to be severely impacted; and
o roads that will be temporarily closed.

InaSAFE was launched in October 2012 at the Asian Ministerial Conferences
for Disaster Risk Reduction.  The software was developed in Indonesia for
Indonesia disaster managers, and is now being rolled out in other countries
through a World Bank initiative.

*Project Overview*

? BNPB in partnership with AIFDR and the World Bank have developed a
concept for developing realistic scenarios to inform contingency planning
and disaster preparedness using a software application to automate and
standardise the process. The application combines fundamental spatial
datasets such as population and infrastructure with hazard data and produce
a range of products such as estimated number of fatalities,
buildings damaged and crops destroyed. The outputs are maps and tables as
required by BNPB and local Disaster Management Agencies (BPBDs). The
application is called InaSAFE (Indonesia Scenario Assessment For
Emergencies) and it is based on the Open Source tools QGIS (Quantum
Geographical Information System), GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction
Library) and the programming language Python.

? The entire framework is built using only Open Source Software components,
which are free of charge and can be modified, built upon and deployed
without any licence fees or functionality limitations.

? InaSAFE version 1.1.2 has been released. InaSAFE is currently being
developed to implement impact analysis according to BNPB?s priority needs.

? Further information about the InaSAFE project is available at
http://www.inasafe.org and the source code is hosted at
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe.


*Objectives*

Appropriate software development skills are needed to

? Help address outstanding issues (see
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues)
? Provide support to BNPB for InaSAFE related software running on their
infrastructure
? Develop new functionality as required
? Help AIFDR deploy tools to provide emergency managers with a capability
to create scenarios and analyse impacts according to specified guidelines.
? Help test and fix bugs as they arise during deployment

*Responsibilities*

A Software Developer is sought to support the Risk and Vulnerability team
of AIFDR in the development of InaSAFE and any other programing needs. They
will be responsible for:

? Developing, testing, deploying, maintaining and documenting the software
components of InaSAFE.

? Collaborating with the open source software development communities
behind the dependencies of InaSAFE to ensure that errors and patches are
reported upstream and that  improvements find their way into the
application.

? Supporting BNPB, AIFDR and the World Bank in training, deployment and
trialling, and gather feedback and provide written recommendations for
further development.

? Assisting the Risk and Vulnerability Unit with other programming needs as
required.

The Software Developer will be mentored by Tim Sutton from Linfiniti CC
remotely. Hence they
will be expected to work independently for significant periods of time and
independently seek
solutions to problems. They will be expected to maintain regular
communication with counterpart
staff from GoI agencies including BNPB and BPPT as well as their
supervisor. The software Developer will be managed by the Spatial Analyst
from the Risk and Vulnerability
section of AIFDR.

The Software Engineer may be required to represent AIFDR at various events,
both locally,
domestically and internationally. They will be expected to do so with
decorum and to clearly  represent AIFDR?s position.

*Qualifications and experience*

? Undergraduate degree in Software Development, Computer Science or related
discipline.
? Solid experience with the Python programming language including numpy.
? Understanding of software engineering practices and tools including
revision control, regression testing, continuous integration and issue
tracking.
? Experience with restructured text and Sphinx.
? Experience in managing servers running debian derivatives
? Ability to prioritise tasks and deliver work on time
? Ability to work both independently and as part of a team.
? Strong communication skills and ability to engage with other agencies and
respond to their stated needs.
? Strong problem solving skills.
? Working level English and Bahasa Indonesia

*Highly desirable skills*

? Experience in programming with PyQt4 and strict adherence to standards
based coding
including PEP8, Pylint compliance etc.
? Experience with GDAL
? Experience with Linux and other Open Source tools
? Experience with spatial information systems
? Familiarity with PostGIS
? Familiarity with geospatial web services architectures (WFS, WCS, ?)

Thanks Marco for clarifying. So I can use only:

qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/usr/lib/cgi-bin/test/test.qgs

Right?
Only one mapserv instance, I just liked shorter URLs.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

in this case you might want to use Apache's URL rewriting as documented 
e.g. for QWC [1] (section 5).

Shorter urls are easy with Apache using Alias (This is the same way 
recommended for Mapserver too) and symlinks.

symlink your qgs documents into /maps

then add and apache alias

Alias /maps /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

Now urls would be

http://server.com/maps?map=/maps/test.qgs etc...

Anyone know if you can alias the part after map= ?

Enjoy,
Alex

Thanks for the replies. Yes, I was aware of these solutions, I was kind of assuming
it should have worked also with relative paths.

All the best.

The problem I see with that, is relative to what? Apache web root? fcgi 
location? Seems like a lot of possible options.

Thanks,

Hi Paolo,

if you want to shorten URLs you also can pass the request through a
shell script (or whatever script executable by apache and called instead
og qgis_mapserv.fcgi) and change the parameters. Something similar to
this file "foo.cgi":

<code>
#!/bin/bash
export QUERY_STRING=$QUERY_STRING'&map=/absolute/path/to/my/project.qgs'
exec /usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
</code>

 I agree - I don't see the use case for relative project files. In 
 production environment you will use Apache rewriting and for 
 dev-purposes it doesn't matter much if the URL is a bit longer.

 Plus, as Alex said - relative to what? It is not obvious.

Hi all.
I found during courses that people like a lot seeing that behind QGIS there is real
people. This helps understanding the open source/free paradigm.
Therefore, I would suggest:
* to include one of the HF pictures in the splash screen
* to add back the pictures of the developers (for those who agree, of course).
All the best.

Hi Paolo!

The splash screen of master version is always a photo of the Hackfest crowd
..
And .. How would you include "one of the HF pictures" in splash? IMHO that
would not look nice ..
And where would you like to add the pictures of developers?

kind regards
Werner

Hi Paolo,

you can even set a bunch of environment variables e.g.

export SHAPE_ENCODING=""
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/apps/qgis-master/lib
exec /home/user/apps/qgis-master/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

for testing a freshly compiled master

One question I'm not sure about is if wrapping the fcgi through a shell
script decreases performance (by bypassing fcgi advantages).
May be @Marco_Hugentobler (who knows more about fcgi and performance)
can say word on this.

Invoking the server with script restarts the qgis_mapserv.fcgi 
executable each time. Therefore, no benefit from all the server cache. 
I'm expecting the performance to decrease significantly.
Performance-wise, it is better to go with Apache rewriting.

Marco

Why not add the pictures in the "about" pages ?
I had some remarks that having it as a splash screen does not look that 
"professional". No trouble to have that in master, but for release we should 
have a nice-looking and well designed splash-screen.
My 2 cents,
Vincent

What about putting more group pics (one photo per HF) to the About-
>Developers? They could be switched witch some < > buttons. I don't guess it's 
a feature, it's a marketing tweaking of the release imho. 

Users from visited countries could feel closer to us then. On the other hand, 
however, it could make an impression we're constantly partying... ;)

good idea with <> buttons ..
I suggest to try to have the group picture from every hackfest there
(basically means a collection of our last master-splash screens) with a
short description of date and place where we've been.
I only don't know if size matters ..

and Borys.. Partying is nice .. people should see that we are having fun
creating QGIS :)

Probably not so much, considering the whole bundle size... Anyway, I'd rather 
make the photo resizeable instead of the list on the left.

Well, I was thinking about possible sponsors ;-))

Hello all,

recently I update the section about the Options dialog in QGIS 2.0 for
the user manual.
In Options --> General -->Project files a new menu was inserted which
deals with macros for project files.

What kind of macros are you dealing with here? What can we do with the
macros?

Kind regards,
Larissa

Message-ID: <CAFO80_oZi6ZTE_hf9p5Y5qPetAJ0mAZtOzOCPiNd9sL5j5hLVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it). Working for Faunalia, I
ported rt_mapserver_exporter plugin originally wrote by Giuseppe
Sucameli (thank you Giuseppe)

I tested it in linux (Ubuntu 12.10 + ubuntuGIS repos) and win WinXP
(SP3). I used mapscript of the ubuntuGIS ( 6.2.1-2~quantal2 ) and, for
Win the version that can be found in:
http://home.gdal.org/tmp/mapscript-python-6.2.1-2.tar.bz2

The code can be downloaded in the 2.0 branch of the git repo:
https://github.com/faunalia/rt_mapserver_exporter/tree/2.0

To test it, as usual, just clone repo in: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/

should be useful having more feedback about problems...

thanks to Frank Warmerdam supporting me on the win platform.

please let me know,

bye Luigi Pirelli - (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

 +1 to have a professional looking splash screen and moving the pictures 
 to the about dialogue.

 To keep file size small we could have the pictures somewhere on a web 
 server and view then with QTWebkit or pull in the pictures from the 
 network.

 In the help menu we could also add a link to "github" and to the bug 
 tracker "hub.qgis.org"

 I kind of like the idea to have the most important web resources 
 available from the help menu.

Hi Luca,

the original one... I hadn't time (at this moment) to check the other
fork in detail, I centered my work in porting, so I can't say anything
about merging different tree or cherry-picking commits.... any
suggestions?

Ciao Luigi Pirelli (luigi.pirelli at faunalia.it)

p.s. sorry... I've to prepare the package for the plugin... soon the package :)

Just noticed that getfeatureinfo doesn?t work when we load a wms with a tile
size, for instance with 512 x 512. Can someone confirm? 

Thanks,

Hi,

in mapserver is possible to define more environment variables and rfer 
to each of they for each of projects called.

I guess this is a good and flexible approach.
I don't know but perhaps is possible also in  qgis-server.

Regards,
Andrea.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lead Data Scientist at Geospatial Startup
Message-ID: <1371776016555-5061457.post@n6.nabble.com>

Vehicle Data Science Corporation is looking for employee number three to help
design and implement software that processes and analyzes big spatial data
sets. We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills
and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. The right
candidate will have a solid scientific foundation and a self-starter,
small-company work ethic. A graduate engineering or science degree from a
top-tier university is preferred. Familiarity with geospatial tools and
database architectures are major pluses and other skills of interest include
distributed computing, web programming, statistics, and time series
analysis. Most of the initial code base is in Python, thus prior experience
with that language is highly desirable.

Vehicle Data Science is an early-stage startup located in the San Francisco
Bay Area with initial funding from a National Science Foundation grant. We
use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture
in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of
driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.

The opportunity is huge and possibilities are wide open for the right
individual. Come help us grow the company you want to be a part of!

To reach us, e-mail: contact at VDS-corp.com

Hi all.
When rotating an object (rectangle) in the print composer, its size grows with the
amount of rotation.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] adding layers to big project very slow
Message-ID: <1371806438009-5061521.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
When working with large projects in master, adding a new layer is sometimes
very slow, and seems sometimes to never happens.
Gui is still reactive thanks to new API, so the user tends to understand
that nothing happens, and tries to add several times the data.
When autoupdate is enabled in a composer legend, layer is really added. I
guess the issue is around layer registry. 
It does with "add layer" and is even slower with "duplicate layer" (layer
properties long to apply?). I also saw that using python plugin 'layer's
menu from project' before it got broken with SIP changes. 
Anyone confirms? 

R?gis

Yes, 
postgres provider. Strangely, some layers are queried correctly sometimes
(rare).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Active iterator errors
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-U5Xa9MqR_TDH6jM+1QbZMLzzgRtpPkzWZF4S=uNdbLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I have just pushed some commits that should hopefully fix the already open
active iterator issue we have been having. At the moment only the ogr and
mssql can have more then one active iterator but the postgis and spatialite
driver will follow soon.

This should fix the follow issue and any of the sub issues:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7472

Merge commit is at:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/4164d6ed0b8498f3e3e45cfa40b639674c8c5074

Test away.

Hi all.
1. open the following file:
http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/CAOP20121_Shapes/Cont_AAd_CAOP20121.zip
2. set a win 1252 encoding (necessary, as it has high ASCII)
3. save a project
crash at the first or second save.
Anyone confirms?
All the best.

nope, not at first sight. I can save it, set encoding to Windows 1252, 
create a project with it and save the shapefile as a new shapefile.

Running 449c2a2 (release build) and
bdd61d5 (debug build)
all on Debian Jessy own builds

Anything special about the layer?  I can't reproduce the problem.

Hi Reda,

here:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/tree/master/i18n

you find the translation files for all languages.

As you can see in the menu Help/ tab Translators of QGIS there has 
already been some arab translation by Assem Kamal en Latif Jalil.

As the counter is on 1.8% I think you will be the new maintainer :-)

Either clone the repo and open qgis_ar.ts, or just download current 
master version:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/raw/master/i18n/qgis_ar.ts

Then download Qt Linguist, open the ts file and start translating :-)
(you can read something about linguist here the docs about translating 
the documentation:
http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/do_translations.html#translation-in-qt-linguist 
)

If you have translated a portion, either sent it to Werner (or do a pull 
request via Github if you are into that).

If you want to see how it looks like in QGIS, create a qgis_ar.qm file 
via File/Release in Linguist. Then you can just place that qm file in 
your installed qgis and see how that looks like.

Hope this is enough to start :-)

Feel free to ask questions

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok .. Now that I have my connection more or less back I see that Richard
already told you how and what to do ..

Nothing left for me to explain ..

But if you have any more question just ask it on the list ..

And I recommend you to subscribe to the translators mailing list (a
usually very low traffic list only to inform translators about important
dates like string freeze)

thanks a lot for offering your help .. the arabic file is in heavy need
for a new maintainer ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi,

I am not sure there is an error, but here:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/python/core/qgsattributeaction.sip#L80

but it seems the last argument is missing, shouldn't it be:
sipCpp->doAction( a0, *a1, a2, a3 );

??

Cheers,

Denis

Tried again with a fresh package:
* open the shp
* set up the encoding to windows-1252
* save to project
* click again on save (the project, not the shp):

Hi all.
Apparently, font size in the server is now bigger than in the desktop:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8068
at least for me and another user; another one does not confirm this.
This used to be ok a short while ago.
Is there someone confirming or disproving this?
A general, or local problem?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problems with Atlas and Map dimensions on composer
	using Python
Message-ID: <FA49BFC197A78E4D8E7F1200278E5F5550519445@fmexch2.fylkesmannen.local>

Hi all,

Is anyone else having problems with using atlas with python?

I am writing some python code that uses the Atlas functionality in master to create a PDF / jpg for each of my 5000 records.

I can produce a jpg/pdf for each feature, however the composerMap object does not stay the same size.

I found this bug report which describes the issue. This report is listed as fixed:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6956

I have set the following two lines in my code:

myAtlas.setFixedScale( False )
myAtlas.setMargin(0.1)

If I set this up from within QGIS, it works perfectly. It is only through Python I have problems.

Here are the example exported jpgs:

Generated inside QGIS GUI

Generated from python

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6r5nAOdEBZrZVJmWlpBb1c4Q2M/edit?usp=sharing

I have also included a stripped down version of my code, along with a sample shapefile (this isn't the data I am planning to use it with, but it doesn't work with either the sample or the real data).

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6r5nAOdEBZrRUpzZm81cU1pUkk/edit?usp=sharing

Using master, updated today from OsGeo4W.

Many thanks,

James Stott

Hi,

for testing and bug hunting I added QGIS master packages to the
Application:Geo repository for opensuse. You can install them as qgis2
package. They are not build automatically, but I will try to update
regularly.

Hi,

I have similar issue: composer map changes its dimensions when
scale and extents changed. I posted question in this list some time
ago [0].

Seems it is impossible to keep composer map size and position
locked. IMO this is big issue that makes composer templates
useless in some cases.

Hi,

this is great, thanks.
I've only one problem - I cannot have Release version 1.8.0-9.5 with 
QGIS Master version, there will be error in qgis-plugin-grass.
Or what will happen if I ignore some of its depencies ?
It would be really nice to have running version when translating.

Regards,
Kari

Hi,

you cannot install them in parallel. You need to decide, what QGIS version to
use.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-Server] Can't read user defined Coordinate
	Reference System
Message-ID: <51C9B09A.1050903@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

I probably found an issue and a regression.

QGIS-Server can't work with user defined Coordinate Reference System.

I'm working with customers data and one file is in an exotic Coordiante 
Reference System. This CRS is stored in the qgs file. The Desktop can 
read and use it. The layer is correctly drawn and the CRS information is 
correctly retruned in the dialog.
The QGIS-Server doesn't read it. In the GetCapabilities the CRS 
attribute of the BoundingBox element is empty :

<BoundingBoxCRS=""maxx="1.19973e+06"minx="657382"maxy="1.8786e+06"miny="1.61552e+06"></BoundingBox>
With the 1.8 version I have this :
<BoundingBoxCRS="USER:100000"maxx="1.19973e+06"minx="657382"maxy="1.8786e+06"miny="1.61552e+06"></BoundingBox>
And QGIS-Server can't drawning the layer like QGIS-Desktop.


Are you aware of this issue ? Someone else ?
Do I have to open an issue ?

Hi Ren?-Luc,

I am wondering what any WMS client is supposed to do with 
BoundingBoxCRS="USER:100000". I would assume any client knows how to 
handle EPSG coded CRS. Could you post a link to your GetCapabilities 
document? What is/are the CRS defined in "Project Properties" / "OWS 
server"?
I have not tested but my idea of how the server _should_ work is:
If CRS restriction is set in "OWS server" any layer not matching the CRS 
defined there is reprojected on the fly (if option is ticked in the 
Project Properties) and can thus be displayed (even layers with 
user-defined CRS). GetCapabilities would return the bounding box for the 
CRS set in "OWS server", not for the CRS of the layer.

Hi Bernhard,

The problem is not just providing user defined CRS in GetCapabilities.
QGIS-Server cannot reproject on the fly layers with user defined CRS.
And it's a regression, QGIS-Server 1.8 can reproject on the fly layers with
user defined CRS.

Ren?-Luc

Hi Ren?-Luc

Isn't it stored in the srs.db file rather than in the .qgs file?

Hi Devs!

According to the latest release plans known to me I should have put master
to string freeze yesterday ..
I know that there is a lot of work going on to fix bugs  so I just wanted
to ask if it is ok for you to write the String Freeze email today or if you
expect some string changes in the near future..

If nobody complains about needing more time I am going to write the message
today evening and let the translators know that they can start with their
final round..

thanks a lot
kind regards
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Differences between WFS functionality in QGIS
	1.7.4 and 1.8.0
Message-ID: <9339AC3EDA5CB545BE13A4F49F027A49BA1A5A69@EX-ZEN-DB02.prod.lokal>

Hello developers,

I'm using the WFS plugin in QGIS 1.7.4 to add WFS layers to the QGIS canvas.

When I add a WFS to QGIS I can choose via checkbox, that "Only request features overlapping the current view extent".

In QGIS 1.8.0 I do not need a plugin, but I miss this checkbox.

There I have only a checkbox "Cache Features". If this checkbox are checked, then I get all data.

If this checkbox are not checked, then QGIS only request features overlapping the current view extent. But if I change the current view extent then QGIS is reloading the data. I need this functionality without reloading the data like QGIS 1.7.4.

Can you implement this functionality?

Regards
Jens

Message-ID: <DUB122-W237327ABE6D3148B54CCF7EE740@phx.gbl>

Hello
I am working on a Python plugin for QGIS 1.8. My goal is to automatically connect to a gps device ata COM port. I tried to clone some code of qgsgpsinformationwidget.cpp and looks like this:
---------------------------------------from qgis.core import *from qgis.utils import *from PyQt4.QtCore import *from PyQt4.QtGui import *
devices_combo_box = qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().findChild(QComboBox, 'mCboDevices')com_port = devices_combo_box.itemData(devices_combo_box.currentIndex()).toString()detector = QgsGPSDetector(com_port)QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detected( QgsGPSConnection )"), self.connection_detected)QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detectionFailed()"), self.connection_detection_failed)detector.advance()
def connection_detected(self, gps_connection):    QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detected", QMessageBox.Ok)
def connection_detection_failed(self):    QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detection failed", QMessageBox.Ok)---------------------------------------
So I first choose the correct port in the QGIS GPS Information Widget (mCboDevices) and then run thiscode but nothing happens.
If I initialize detector with something like QgsGPSDetector('test') than connection_detection_failed iscalled (as expected). With QgsGPSDetector('COM5') or QgsGPSDetector('\\\\.\\COM5')connection_detection_failed is not called but connection_detected either. Do you have any idea whatI am doing wrong? Thank you very much.

With QgsGPSDetector('COM5') or QgsGPSDetector('\\\\.\\COM5')connection_detection_failed is not called but connection_detected either. Do you have any idea whatI am doing wrong? Thank you very much.

Hi,

I??m trying to develop a small plugin for master.
I have set qgisMinimumVersion to 2.0 and stored the plugin in .qgis2\python\plugins but running  Qgis does :
This plugin is incompatible with this version of QGIS
Plugin designed for QGIS 1.x


ThemeManager


Installed version: ? (in C:/Users/sylvain.pierre/.qgis2/python/plugins/ThemeManager)

What should be the solution?

Thanks

There is no 2.0 version right now ..
IIRC minimum version right now (to be able to use it in master) should be
1.9)

hope this solves your problem

kind regards
Werner

mmmm IIRC 2.0 was mentioned to be hardcoded temporarily in plugin manager
by Boris. I definitely have a plugin with minVersion=2.0

the warning is different as well IIRC. maybe something else? like sipV1 vs
sip v2? (speculation)

 Hi,

 But version 2.0 is hard-coded now in master. So Pierre should use 2.0 
 now.

 Pierre - did you create the metadata.txt file? This file is required 
 for QGIS 2.0. See section metadata.txt at 
 http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/plugins.html

You are correct, you need to set qgisMinimumVersion to 2.0

How old is your master version?
Things have changed quickly last weeks...

I had quite a few problems getting my plugin to be 2.0 compatible in the plugin installer.

I found that I had ?authorName? in my metadata.txt file, not ?author?. I believe you also need ?email? filled in too.

I would check the metadata.txt file and make sure it?s the same as the example online here:

Exaxtly, master uses alreasy API 2.0. More info: 
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Plugin_Compatibility

Do you have any ideas where else to link this wiki page?

Have you created the metadata.txt file? Does it contain the version tag? 
Please remember in QGIS 2.0 all metadata are read from that file. The metadata 
in __init__.py are not supported anymore (you can safely remove them and only 
keep the classFactory method).

The unknown plugin version means the plugin manager can't figure out the plugin 
version from metadata.txt. It assumes the plugin is designed for QGIS 1.x, 
because those plugins had no metadata.txt file.

You are correct, you need to set qgisMinimumVersion to 2.0

How old is your master version?
Things have changed quickly last weeks...

the warning is different as well IIRC. maybe something else? like sipV1 vs sip v2? (speculation)

There is no 2.0 version right now ..
IIRC minimum version right now (to be able to use it in master) should be 1.9)

hope this solves your problem

So the manager was right, you use the approach for QGIS 1.x.

I have the impression that the Linear option
in the Raster Georeferencing plugin is always calculating
a 0 for the Rotation. Am I wrong? Could other people test?
In such a case, I think there has to be some error in the code
(if Linear refers to Affine).

you may want to add your notes here

if you are willingly to support qgis development this will happen
sooner than later.

We think it might be related to Python crashing on exit.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Deactivate raster icon generation by default
Message-ID: <7054145965f69057c413f127362c99dd@carto.net>

 Hi,

 A discussion on the german fossgis-user group revealed that generating 
 raster previews slows down raster loading a lot. Esp. for VRT raster 
 catalogs.

 Can we set this setting (Settings -> Options -> Canvas and Legend -> 
 Create Raster Icons (may be slow)) to off by default for new users?

 I think performance is much more important than raster icons in the 
 legend. In >90% cases you cannot see a think in these small raster icons 
 anyway. Also, a new user would not have the idea to turn this particular 
 setting off to speed up raster loading. Even I was not aware of it.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Yes, I was wondering few days ago why I took half a minute to load a VRT... Then I realized that turning off "create raster icon" speeds the loading a lot. There is no noticable lag of time now when loading 2 large VRTs (approx. 80 GB aerials each VRT).

Stefan

Yes, the installation had not completed by some reason and I still had 1.9.
Once I've rerun the dmg, qqis2-dev starts up.

Hi,

Sorry for this basic question, but what about ecw format into master and by the way into 2.0 ?
At this time I can't load any raster layer in this format...

Thanks

Hmm . I just tested and looked ..
It seems that it is already deactivated by default ..
deleting the .qgis2 folder and start from scratch showed that it is not
active ..
probably it's something from an earlier installation?

can anyone confirm?

Hey Sylvain,

When QGIS 2.0 ships it will include the ECW SDK so ECW support will be
enabled, however for now you can follow this process

Werner,

That setting is not stored in the .qgis2 folder.  It will be where ever the
settings for QGIS are stored. In windows this in the registry.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Shifted raster display
Message-ID: <CAG4NReKz23Gaa6XpNTRwiPNZGCc_SyBXpMEEnFuf8ODRRO+_6A@mail.gmail.com>

After processing a raster layer with OTB, I get a shifted display of
the new layer in Qgis.
While gdalinfo reports a 0,0 origin, qgis reports a 0, 1023.74 origin.
The origin of the original file is reported as 0,0 by both gdalinfo and qgis
See screenshot here:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3180464/shifteddisplay.jpeg

Also, while gdalinfo reports no projection (because there is none) Qgis reports
longlat wgs84 in the Metadata (not only in General).

Tested on qgis 1.8 (on Ubuntu) and 2.0-dev clf8230 (on Mac)

I fill a ticket and upload the 2 images.

On linux it's in ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf (I believe in every 
distribution).
Default is still true. It's a really simple fix, I'll just commit it. 
If there's a problem, please complain.

If there's the demand for it, a threshold size (resolution * bands?) 
could be introduced (for 2.1 I'd say).

 Hi Matthias,

 Thank you - I don't think the threshold would be too useful. With the 
 VRT format the problem is probably that potentiall hundred/thousands of 
 files would have to be opened just to generate this small icon that is 
 of very limited use.

 Thank you for your fix!

 Andreas

Hi all.
When selecting CRS for restrictions (in Project properties>OWS Server), the first
line seems always blank, even though one CRS is selected.
Anyone confirms?

Hi,

when trying to use any of the open-file buttons (e.g. open project) or 
trying to browse for a file after clicking "load vector" QGIS crashes 
(loading a vector from the browser works ok).

This is QGIS master (59222a0) on OpenSuse 12.2 (64 bit).

anyone confirms?

Hi Bernhard,

yes, the package I extracted from master on 24 June seems to be broken. I
updated from trunk today, it should be available soon and hopefully work
again.

He all.
we just got a new Silver Sponsor:

Many will be happy knowing that our finances, albeit tiny, are faring well, and we
are now able to fund some bugfixing leading us more smoothly to the QGIS 2.0 release
- - one more good reason to donate and sponsor the project.
Please contract me if interested.
Thanks GAIA!
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Connect to GPS device



Hello

I am working on a Python plugin for QGIS 1.8. My goal is to automatically connect to a gps device at
a COM port. I tried to clone some code of qgsgpsinformationwidget.cpp and looks like this:

---------------------------------------
from qgis.core import *
from qgis.utils import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

devices_combo_box = qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().findChild(QComboBox, 'mCboDevices')
com_port = devices_combo_box.itemData(devices_combo_box.currentIndex()).toString()
detector = QgsGPSDetector(com_port)
QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detected( QgsGPSConnection )"), self.connection_detected)
QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detectionFailed()"), self.connection_detection_failed)
detector.advance()

def connection_detected(self, gps_connection):
? ? QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detected", QMessageBox.Ok)

def connection_detection_failed(self):
? ? QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detection failed", QMessageBox.Ok)
---------------------------------------

So I first choose the correct port in the QGIS GPS Information Widget (mCboDevices) and then run this
code but nothing happens.

If I initialize detector with something like QgsGPSDetector('test') than connection_detection_failed is
called (as expected). With QgsGPSDetector('COM5') or QgsGPSDetector('\\\\.\\COM5')
connection_detection_failed is not called but connection_detected either. Do you have any idea what

Hi everyone,

I'm still hoping to get this working. Below is a sample script I would
like, but the GRASS call via SEXTANTE does not produce an output or
raise any errors, although it does print the help for the function.
Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Martin


import sys
import os

sys.path.append("/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins")
sys.path.append(os.getenv("HOME")+"/.qgis/python/plugins")

import PyQt4
import sextante
import qgis
import qgis.utils

def main():
    app = PyQt4.QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    qgis.core.QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr/lib/qgis", True)
    qgis.core.QgsApplication.initQgis()
    sextante.core.Sextante.Sextante.initialize()
    run_script(qgis.utils.iface)

def run_script(iface):
    """ this shall be called from Script Runner"""
    sextante.alglist()
    sextante.alghelp("grass:r.los")

    dem = sys.argv[1]
    out_uri = sys.argv[2]
    x = sys.argv[3]
    y = sys.argv[4]

    sextante.runalg("grass:r.los",
                    input=dem,
                    coordinate=",".join(x,y),
                    output=out_uri)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()

seems to me it only happens in OSX, because all tools have been updated.
Can you fix it and send me a patch?

it happens whether the user set paths into Settings dialog (so usually on

I'm working on fixing it, I've already patched it and some other tools
(i.e. FillNoData, Info, Translate) that doesn't work in this moment.

Cheers.

This worked prior to the SIP changes. When I click on the triangle to display the schemas and tables in our PostgreSQL database, I get the following error. Not having any new problems with Spatialite. Anybody else having this problem?

Hi all.
I'm getting errors while loading a PostGIS layer:
===
 Impossibile recuperare il cursore qgisf3_0
 Errore database: ERROR:  geometry requires more points

 Interrogazione: CLOSE qgisf3_0 ha restituito 7 [ERROR:  current
 transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
 ]
 1 degli stati del cursore perso.
 SQL: CLOSE qgisf3_0
 Result: 7 (ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
 end of transaction block
 )
===
When checked, however, the layer has no invalid geometries (Topology checker plugin
and Vector>Geometry>Check geometry).
Any hint on ho to debug this?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

The following SQL statement worked for me to clean invalid geometries 
from a table, which I was not able to work with in postgis (independent 
of QGIS)

select * from multipolygons where not st_isvalid(wkb_geometry)

After inspecting the invalid geometries, you can replace "select *" 
with "delete" to get rid of the rows in question.

Hope that helps,
Matthias

Yes, thanks Matthis for this. QGIS is probably not loading the data, that's why is
not finding errors.
I'm investigating further.
All the best.

AFAIR, the same layer was loaded by qgis 1.8: Matthias, could you confirm?
All the best.

Using the same version of PostGIS / GEOS ?

I suppose it's the && operator (bounding box intersection) and/or
(st_)intersects function that causes this (on certain invalid geometries).  And
1.8 would also trigger that.

I see - unfortunately I do not have a 1.8 at hand now, I'll try to check.

I didn't try to load this layer in QGIS before I realized the errors 
when doing analyses in postgis only and corrected the errors.
But as this is a) clearly a postgis/data error and b) QGIS forwards the 
error message properly to the user, I don't think it's an issue to pay 
any attention to on QGIS side.

Hello Nathan

Thank you very much! I saw that your Plugin is for QGIS 2.0. Have you always tested this code with QGIS 2.0 and not 1.8? I still have not succeded to get a GPS connection. With the QGIS (1.8) GPS Information Dialog it's possible to connect to the GPS device but not from the Python code. So my question is if there may be a problem with the Python bindings in QGIS? Well, if QGIS 2.0 is coming soon this is not such a big problem :-)

I have done it before. ?https://github.com/NathanW2/qmap/blob/master/src/qmap/gps_action.py#L37

Although it's pretty much the same as what you have there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Connect to GPS device



Hello

I am working on a Python plugin for QGIS 1.8. My goal is to automatically connect to a gps device at
a COM port. I tried to clone some code of qgsgpsinformationwidget.cpp and looks like this:

---------------------------------------
from qgis.core import *
from qgis.utils import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

devices_combo_box = qgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().findChild(QComboBox, 'mCboDevices')
com_port = devices_combo_box.itemData(devices_combo_box.currentIndex()).toString()
detector = QgsGPSDetector(com_port)
QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detected( QgsGPSConnection )"), self.connection_detected)
QObject.connect(detector, SIGNAL("detectionFailed()"), self.connection_detection_failed)
detector.advance()

def connection_detected(self, gps_connection):
? ? QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detected", QMessageBox.Ok)

def connection_detection_failed(self):
? ? QMessageBox.information(None, "Information", "Connection detection failed", QMessageBox.Ok)
---------------------------------------

So I first choose the correct port in the QGIS GPS Information Widget (mCboDevices) and then run this
code but nothing happens.

If I initialize detector with something like QgsGPSDetector('test') than connection_detection_failed is
called (as expected). With QgsGPSDetector('COM5') or QgsGPSDetector('\\\\.\\COM5')
connection_detection_failed is not called but connection_detected either. Do you have any idea what
I am doing wrong? Thank you very much.

Regards, Josua

+1 too. 
just a note on this. Using a 20 tiles vrt with ecw files, for a total size
of 120 Go, on 1.8 , raster icon generation takes ages. On 1.9, it was almost
instantaneous (with raster icon ON).
Since only big tiled vrt seem to slow down, and since having icon remains
pretty helpful in legend, I just created pyramids overview, only for smaller
pyramids (16 , 32). It solves the raster icon generation issue since only
pyramids are used to generate icons. 
Hope that can help someone who needs to keep raster icon generation On.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New feature's needed,
	create geometry from attribute
Message-ID: <1372585505563-5063071.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
After some training courses here, a very common use case is not satisfied
easily: 

The only entry to create geometry from text (XY or WKT) is the delimited
text plugin. 
It appears that having a separate fonction "create point" like in Mapinfo or
Arcgis would be really handy, and could avoid the need of csv import. 

I was thinking of making a plugin for this, but I'm wondering what is the
best approach. 
 1- duplicate layer into a memory layer. Easy, requires MemoryLayerSaver to
make data persistent, is not dynamic with datasource.
 2- create a pluginLayer? I'm not sure it will do what I need. I would like
the project to keep a reference to the datasource (xls, whatever ogr/
postgres/ sqlite/ spatialite) and replace or create geometry on load by
reading XY columns or WKT column. 

Is that feasable in a plugin,  as a proof of concept, or does it require
core classes modifications (C++ work , so I won't do it by myself)

Thanks for your tips, 
R?gis

Hi

What about using the field calculator ? I think I have seen a method in the
"geometry" tools : something like geomfromwkt ? If needed, we could simply
add a way to modifiy the features geometry with the field calculator, and
it will do the trick.
