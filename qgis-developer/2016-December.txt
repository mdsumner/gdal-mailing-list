Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS install path changed
Message-ID: <7CCEF44D1C42854999B19B1EB27281F67CB3F75B@SR2ORBHQ2K803.angus.gov.uk>

Good morning list,

I've just downloaded QGIS 2.18.1 for Windows (64-bit) and run the installer.  I have an existing installation of 2.18.0 installed at C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.18 and the .1 installer now wants to install into C:\Program Files\QGIS Las.  I've changed the path to my existing 2.18 installation and it has completed successfully.  However, should it have installed to the existing installation rather than create a new directory?

Hi all,
with the recent addition of expressions as parameters, I think variable
buffer alg is a duplication of the fixed one, which should be renamed in
a generic "Buffer": am I wrong?
BTW: also Percentage buffer can be done with the same technique, so the
plugin[0] will possibly be useless.
Unsure about other plugins[1]: possibly these coud be unified as well?
Probably for the average user having to enter expression for this could
be intimidating at first: what about having a set of predefined expressions?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo

Good thinking, deduplication is always a good move

That's where I expect the biggest impact as well. Do you have an idea
how to make this as easy as possible? A list of useful predefined
expressions?

Yes, that was my idea. Possible named ones, so users can use them even
when not fully understanding the details.
All the best.

This morning, I had the surprise of see that the QGIS icon has the Santa
Claus red cap.

Do you noticed ?

Who had this nice idea ?   :)


Great !   Perhaps, we will have some other new ?


Regards and Happy new year (in advance)

I've been thinking about something similar to the data defined buttons used
by symbology. Ie default to a constant value input, but using a custom
widget you can choose to use a fields value or a custom expression.

I don't really understand what you mean by this - can you elaborate?

I think some expression (in this case the one calculating Percentage
buffer) could be saved in a list, with a descriptive name, so the user
could use it straight away, without typing or even understanding the
details.
All the best.

I think the tricky part is the parameters for the expressions.

    "scale_value_field" / @percentage * 100

       ^^^^                 ^^^^
   field parameter      integer literal parameter

I think it will be required to formalize these paratemers and create a
UI for them to make it really user friendly.

Or I didn't understand your idea yet.

Hi,

Apologies if I misread some comments above but I'm afraid we are moving
from what Alexandre was mentionning in his first post (in any case, the way
I understood it): add consistency to the features QGIS already provide (and
among those features). While I'm also interested in some requests (such as
"bad layers handling" - I like the way InDesign manage broken links), I
wonder if this kind of request should not be kept for the hub as it's a new
feature.

Richard mentioned a place where 3.0 requests were listed. Is it this one
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/ ? While it's supposed to be api
oriented, maybe we can extend it and allow to list/discuss and filter (in a
more organized way) all UI/UX thingies that worth a fix before 3.0 lands.
In this way, anyone that wants to help can pick an issue and ask pointers
from devs if/when needed.

my2cts,
Harrissou

I tried to request the following feature enhancement some time ago but
don't know if it ever successfully got entered into the system (the
suggestions website is very confusing).

for Singleband Pseudocolor:  after classifying a continuous image (say
NDVI) into numerous classes (10's to 100's), allow the user to select MORE
than one class at time for color assignment (i.e. Click to select initial
class, then shift <or control> click to select additional classes, assign
color to all selected classes).

Thanks for consideration of this request.

I'm not a fan of mixing the two. Maybe a new repo could be made for 3.0 ui
suggestions, but just like this thread it's going to get filled with a
thousand unrelated feature requests ;)

The api repo is a nice clean list of stuff that HAS to be done before 3.0
release or we miss the opportunity. Ui can always be addressed in a future
3.x release.

Hello,

I think that you can first try to convert your plugin to a Processing 
Python script as stated here:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing/scripts.html

When you create a Processing Python script from the dedicated dialog, it 
is stored into your ~/.qgis3/processing/script/ directory.
To fill the script code, you will have to extract the "algorithm" part 
of your plugin (the things that do the stats or the dissolve part which 
seems to be stored into 'dissolve_stats_dialog.py') and put it into a 
Python script.

For input/output, just use the dedicated "comments" syntax at the 
beginning of the script:
     ##myvector=vector
defines an input vector which will be available in myvector Python 
variable.

Once inputs and outputs are defined, there is no need to deal with 
dialogs to open/choose files, just use the "comments" variables and 
Processing will build the dialogs for you.
The script will be processed by Processing as is: the code will be 
interpreted as a Python script. You can add as many classes/functions 
you'd like into the script. Don't use the `if __name__ == '__main__'` 
Python syntax for the main loop. I think it is not interpreted correctly 
by Processing (not 100% sure though).

Once your plugin is converted, you can make a PR to 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing which is the repository for 'Get 
models from on-line scripts collection' Processing dialog box and it 
will become available to anybody.


Cheers,

I'm guessing that my script will be accessible from the Scripts/Tools part

Have a look at
https://github.com/jdugge/BufferByPercentage/commit/c52d161b40abf6bbd45e7ec421eb311623592e90

That's a similar commit which added a processing module to an existing
plugin.

The hardest(?) part is refactoring your plugin to split all the logic out
from any existing gui. Buts that's a good thing to do in any case.

Sorry if the answers are obvious !

Thanks,

Julie.

If you convert your plugin functionality into Processing scripts, then
it's very easy to distribute them, no need create a plugin manually
and add them to it.

Just create your scripts and make sure they are available in the
toolbox. Then, in the "Scripts" group of the toolbox, you will find a
tool called "Create script collection plugin". Just select the scripts
that you want to distribute, and it will package them into a plugin
that you can share in the plugins server. Installing the plugin will
add the scripts to the toolbox.

Hope this helps

Ok, what about the following:

- I create an Repo: https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_UIX solely for the 
creation/discussion of ideas as tickets?

'Some people' have to do some gardening there then, like cleaning up 
duplicates etc. Volunteers for that? I can give you on that repo then.

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks to all for your answers, it's great to get good advice quickly. 
It's more clear to me now how to proceed, I'll give it a try !

Ok, done:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion

@Alexandre, can you please check if you can add/edit issues now? Without 
giving you commit rights?

Then if that is ok (and everybody can at least create issues) I give you 
commit rights so you can close issues.

Let's see if this works!

Regards,

Richard

Hello all,

QGIS 3 is getting lots of love, and we are seeing new features being added,
some legacy code being clean up, and so on. We are all aware that this will
break the 2.x API, but now it's the time for it.

So I wondered if this is not the perfect time to think about some UI/UX
changes as well, as it will lead to more work in translation and
Documentation. Could we do a list of UI/UX stuff that we could improve?

I can think of a few things:

*Consistency*
 - "search", "select" and "browse" for browsing files;
- "Add saved file to map", "Load into canvas when finished", "Open output
file after running algorithm";
- there is more of these for sure;

*Help and Documentation*
- Most of our help buttons lead to nowhere, we already talked about
pointing them to the User's Manual online (although we would need a
solution for working with it offline and in different languages)

*Defaults*
- Should default selection color not be opaque?
- Showing only selected features vertexes by default?
- Map template, we could provide a very simple template as default (I think
there was already some discussion about this); Most people I see gets very
confused when they see a completely empty page.



Here's another idea for a great project t which doesn't involve c++/python:
check through and delete unused png icons.

A lot of the old png icons have been replaced with proper svg versions, but
the pngs are still included and in some cases they are incorrectly used
instead of the svg replacements.

Identifying these would be a matter of going though each png icon in the
repo and searching through the code (eg via "git grep mactionrefresh.png")
to see if they are still used anywhere. (Ignore any hits in the resources
files!) . If they aren't they can be safely removed. If they are, you could
check whether a suitable svg replacement can be used.

The more pngs we remove the easier it will be to identify which remaining
icons require vector versions.

Nyall

Hi all,
love these cleanups, thanks a lot for this.
Another possible improvement: labelling now requires two actions:
* select "Show laels etc." from a dropdown
* select a field or an expression for label content.
I think this can be combined in only one menu.
Thanks again.

Hi all,
I'm regularly compiling QGIS master, and I'm surprised how usable and
smooth it is - obviously not suitable for production, but apparently not
so far from it. It would be great if those more involved with the
migration could give us a quick overview:
* are there blocking factors?
* which are the main areas which require much work?
* are the deadlines proposed originally feasible?
* how can we speed up the migration?
Thanks a lot.

Great one. I will add it to the QGIS 3 UIX issues repo.

I like the idea of having easy to follow instructions in the issue for
anyone to pick it up and solve.

Just a quick note about the bad layers handling dialog to say that it can
be fully overridden through python or C++ plugins, the API is fully exposed.

See: QgsProjectBadLayerHandler
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsProjectBadLayerHandler.html

Cheers.

Hi,

Since the user list doesn't seen to have an answer, I'd like to ask here:
Is there an equivalent to the "add virtual layer" functionality in the
Processing toolbox?

I want to join multiple csv files to a vector layer (and at the same time
build a new geometry WKT). This seems most easily done with a virtual
layer. But I need to script this workflow.

In the Processing toolbox, I only found the "execute SQL" tool but it does
not allow selection of non-spatial tables as input.

Best wishes,
Anita

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the PyQgsAuthManagerPKIOWSTest has been disabled on the
Travis builds.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

If you're interested in seeing these tests continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here's an example of the test failing on an unrelated
commit:

No, there is no such functionality AFAIK, but it should be easy to add, i think

Can you open a feature request?

Also, the execute SQL algorithm can be modified to accept non-spatial
tables. That makes sense to me

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgKGFbq7E2kvLPiRhWgEjuyxtbMTF=rA-c04A9ChvGZ+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thanks to tons of valuable feedback from the QGIS community and the
generous funding grant from the QGIS organisation, I've just completed
and merged the task manager framework branch.

I'm very keen on feedback from QGIS devs, plugin authors, and users as
they start the play with this new feature. While the bulk of the work
is now complete, I'll continue refining this as we had toward 3.0.

Outstanding tasks include:
- a PR for documentation of the task manager within the python cookbook
- some final UI polish and tweaks
- some blog posts + social media push advertising this feature
- aiding the community with porting their work to task manager

I'd like to once again thank the QGIS org for this grant and everyone
who has donated funds to QGIS which made the grants possible.

(Personally, I think this work is a great demonstration once again of
how healthy the QGIS project is. It's involved donations from end
users, the initiative and leadership of the PSC in creating this grant
program, the new QGIS voting structure + the associated involvement
from local user groups, and a PR with nearly 60 comments from
interested developers in the QGIS community!)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing NG/V2 - brainstorming
Message-ID: <CAB28AsinBPmmXCP7kvPTb7O95Zc6tyLdcmvmPks_kKKYPa8QDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've recently been informally chatting about possible enhancements to
processing with a few QGIS team members, and I thought it'd be worth
starting a public brainstorm about these ideas.

This is really just "thinking aloud" about what the next logical steps
are for processing and how we can make it more competitive against
programs like FME.

So here we go... a bunch of random ideas on future processing enhancements:


1. Rework native algorithms to avoid layer input/outputs

(Full credit goes to Matthias here). One current inefficiency with
processing models is that every step is exported to a file based
format, which is then reread in for the next algorithm. This means
that a simple set of steps like buffer->reproject involves multiple
conversions from OGR formats to QgsFeature/QgsGeometry and back to the
OGR output format, when it could be simplified to just two operations
on a QgsFeature's geometry and then a final write to disk. In addition
to the inefficiency here we also lose things like long field names and
full support for z/m/curves (depending on the intermediate file
format).

So... how to address this... Matthias came up with the idea that
native processing algs could accept a feature iterator instead of an
input layer, and themselves be a feature iterator. This effectively
would make a processing model a chain of iterators which features are
"pulled" through from a final writer step. Ie, the source
layer->buffer->save to layer->load layer->reproject->save to layer
model becomes:

a writer
-> which reads features from the iterator provided a transform alg
-> which reprojects the geometry from features provided by a buffer
alg's output iterator
-> which buffers the geometry on features from an iterator from the
original source layer

(Obviously, anytime a non-native algorithm (eg saga/grass/ogr) is used
then the features would need to be written to disk first. But this is
no different to the current behaviour so there shouldn't be any extra
cost incurred.)

This gets a little trickier when we want to multithread something, eg.
2 input layers-> each buffered -> intersection of the two. But we
could handle this by using a form of "pipe" iterator, which sucks in
features as fast as possible from its input iterator and stores them
in one thread, and then an algorithm in another thread consumes these
features as they become available. Ie:

thread a:
input layer 1 iterator -> buffer 1 alg iterator -> "pipe" iterator a ->


                                thread c: intersection alg
thread b:
input layer 2 iterator -> buffer 2 alg iterator  -> "pipe" iterator b ->

where thread c reads the features from "pipe iterator a" and "b" as
they become available, and then does its processing on them.

(hope that makes sense!)

2. Georeferenced geometries

I think for the approach in 1 to work we'd also need to introduce the
concept of "referenced" geometries. This would basically be
QgsGeometry + a QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem. It would allow retrieval
of a geometry's CRS without requiring any knowledge of its source
layer (or where no layer exists, eg the canvas extent as a geometry).

I've pondered several approaches to this, such as:
- QgsReferencedFeature (QgsFeature + crs): This doesn't work for
non-feature based geometries or allow features with multiple
geometries in different CRSes. (See
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/21).
- QgsReferencedGeometry: subclass of QgsGeometry with a CRS member.
This approach would avoid adding any extra overhead to QgsGeometry.
But given that the main use of QgsGeometry (geometry attached to a
feature from a layer) will always have a CRS associated, this seems
like it unnecessarily complicates the API.

So my current preference would be for QgsGeometry to gain a
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem member variable, which is an invalid crs
if the geometry is not referenced. This should still be quite
lightweight given that QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem is implicitly
shared.


3. Porting components of processing to core

There's demand (from eg QField) to reuse parts of processing outside of PyQGIS.

I think good candidates for porting to core would be:
- parameters
- inputs
- the algorithm base class

In addition to allowing use outside of python this would also help
strengthen these components by the static typing which would result of
porting to c++.

I'd also like to see the results + history dialogs merged and moved to
core so that they can also be reused for non-processing tasks (eg
composer exports).



So there we go. What's everyone's thoughts? Are these ideas worth
pursing? Is there other things we should be looking at investigation
for future processing enhancements?

Victor,

I was looking into this; it'd be nice for the "build vector layer"
algorithm would support/show geometryless layers in the parametermultiinput
panel. AFAIK, geometryless layers aren't (yet? :) ) supported by the
parametermultiinput.

Hi
I would very much like to see improvements for Processing. A few additional
ideas:

- Display the number of features going through the model. This would help
the user understand the data better.

- Add comments to model components without opening each component. A chance
to explain why a specific tool is used.

- Support clustering/grouping for a set of model components that together
perform a task. Placing a few components inside a visual box would make the
model more structured and easier to understand.

- A server side component where users can log in and run a model/job, such

Hi Nayll and all,

my ideas are more from a user's perspective and from that point of view 
I like your first idea most which (hopefully) increases performance and 
improves the output.

Moreover I would like to add the following ideas
1) Selection: It would be cool to integrate QGIS' expression builder 
into processing so when using the "Select by expression" algorithm 
instead of typing the expression one could use expression builder to 
have it created (no field names available, of course, if used in a model).

2) Filter: Select features (e.g. by expression) and process both the 
features that match the expression _and_ those that don't in seperate 
branches of a model.

Anita, Mathieu

I added both of your requests and it should be possible now to use
tables on both "execute SQL" and "build virtual vector" algorithms

Let me know if you try it (it is on master)

Cheers

Dear all,



The Faculty ITC [1] of the University of Twente, The Netherlands, is starting a 9 month distance course in Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (15 EC spread over a 9-month period)  that can be taken solo or as a first step to a full MSc degree..



A decision was made to use QGIS (or associated providers) designed exercises to explore the concepts of Geo-Information Science. We believe this will contribute decisively for the quality of the course, and therefore appreciate if you can share this among your contacts.



The course consists of three 10-week separate but connected 5 EC modules. The course will extend from February to November 2017 in part-time (14 hours a week) modality. Enrollments are accepted until the 6th of January 2017



Details about content and enrollments can be found at[2].

Alternately, you can also inquire Andre Mano (a.dasilvamano at utwente.nl<mailto:a.dasilvamano at utwente.nl>)

​As far as I can see OGR's Execute SQL takes only one input layer/table.
Therefore it's not suitable for the task of joining a vector layer with a
table.

QGIS' Build virtual vector takes multiple inputs but I'm not sure what it
does with them. The help text is a bit short: "This algorithm creates a
virtual layer that contains a set of vector layer." That does not sound
like it will do the job either.

QGIS' Execute SQL seems to allow multiple inputs but doesn't list tables
and I didn't see any changes to this algorithm in your recent commits but
maybe I missed something?

Note: I'm running qgis-dev from OSGeo4W which is probably not up to date
with master.

The SQL statement I want to execute (and which runs well in Layer | Add
Layer | Add Virtual Layer) is:

select s_out.y1_statefips, s_out.y2_statefips,
  st_centroid(f.geometry)
from fips as f
join stateoutflow1415 as s_out
on f.fips = s_out.y1_statefips​

​where fips is a polygon layer and stateoutflow1415 is a CSV.

Best wishes,
Anita

I really like the idea of having basic Processing code in the core library
with Python bindings available.

Regarding iterators approach... It sounds interesting, but we need to think
also about possibility to work with layers, which are not loaded in QGIS.
In this case as I understand we need to construct layer and then create
an iterator for Processing from it.

Another idea (obvious and already discussed a bit) is to adopt Processing
to use recently added Task Manager, so algs can be executed in background
and models can be executed using multiple threads when this is possible.

Thanks for writing this up Nyall,

This is something that I has been on my list of ideas for a long time
already and that I have never got round to get down to.

I think you have covered the topic quite well already, so I don't think
there's a lot I have to add right now.

If the algorithm is a QGIS core one, that's correct. But I assume that's
done already now, so it shouldn't be much of a difference.

For anything else, the iterator approach will not be usable either way
and it will have to end up in a file anyway. So the model processor
should be smart enough to handle that.

Case 1:
qgis alg -> qgis alg
  iterator

Case 2:
qgis alg -> external alg
  find a suitable file format and route the iterator to this file

Case 3:
  external alg -> external alg
check if they have a common file type, if yes, use it, if not convert
between something usable.

If an external file is involved as source, a "file loader" algorithm
should be transparently inserted to handle conversion to an iterator or
find the best intermediate format or just pass the file as-is.

I think that's something that will happen in any case. We should be able
to combine the two ideas.

The different possibilities here are probably:

* Always use a file to pass data between algs:
    Heavy on disk I/O and which has performance impacts.

* Use a memory layer to pass data between algs:
    Heavy on memory which may fail with big data (*)

* Iterator approach:
    Performance win. Most complex because it adds a lot of
task-interdependency, scheduling effort and possibly will still use a
lot of memory if the consumer algorithm is not fast enough to handle the
data produced by the generator algorithm. So there should be some kind
of coordination between the iterator and the producer to pause the
producer task if the queue gets too big.

Best regards
Matthias

I would really like an option to allow advanced users to manually just SET the extents of a vector layer when first adding it, so that a full table-scan can be avoided to derive that result.

This still seems to happen, even though the “use estimated metadata” flag is checked, when first adding a layer.

Gotta say that I too have built the new QGIS3 from source and it does seem quite usable … EXCELLENT work folks!!

thanks -
Chris

I think qgis-dev is now a zombie, as it's v2 master, where there has nor been
any work for a while.

Ah - that reminds me of point 4 which I forgot:


4 - Make more use of iterators in QGIS api

What I mean here is that things like QgsVectorFileWriter,
QgsVectorDataProvider, QgsVectorLayer should all have an addFeatures(
QgsFeatureIterator it... ) method to make it easier to bulk insert
features.

There's also the possibility of adding a "QgsFeatureIteratorProvider"
interface which implements a getFeatures() call. QgsVectorLayer would
then implement the interface, as well as other classes like
QgsFeatureList and QgsFeatureStore, and the processing algorithms.

Hmm.... I've brought up previously on the list my thoughts that we
should *extend* the timeline to mid next year, as opposed to speeding
it up.

See https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-October/045554.html

I'm still strongly of the view that extending the timeline is a good
idea and will give us a much better 3.x series.

Hi Nyall

Wow this is absolutely fantastic! Thanks so much for all your hard work! When you have all your social media bits ready let me know and I will make a blog post on http://blog.qgis.org - I think it is a really great demonstration of how we use the funds donated to QGIS for the good of the project.

thanks Nyall for your reply. I meant in fact to revive that thread,
thanks for digging it out.
So if I understand correctly we are aiming at:
* feature freeze around May
* release around July
or:
* wait until ready?
I love cleanups, but of course they are never really finished: do we
have a specific goal, i.e. a minimum set of tasks to be finished before
freezing? Could we set some of the issues [0] as blockers?
Sorry to bother, but I believe making the whole process more transparent
to developers, users, and donors will help us going ahead smoothly.
All the best, and thanks for thoughts.

	independent components
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xRM5DxZStuQRWzx6PqOVEp0=F5-7UYEUnZCRNZCXmsng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all


Before writing a QEP, I would like to discuss quickly here one idea
about Processing, that I think could be interesting and feasible for
3.0

Currently, Processing has some “core” providers (those that are part
of the Processing code itself and are installed with QGIS), ranging
from basic ones such as GDAL or the provider with native QGIS
algorithms, to more uncommon ones, such as LiDAR tools or TauDEM.

Apart from that, more algorithms can be added to the Processing
toolbox, via separate plugins.

To homogenize that and improve user experience, it could be good to
have all those providers as separate plugins, so a bare-bones
installation of Processing would have maybe just the native algorithms
(or native + GDAL), and all remaining ones would be installed by the
users. Installation can be done directly using the plugin manager, or
maybe from Processing itself, if all Processing-based plugins are
conveniently tagged (which is a good idea in any case).

This would have some advantages. Providers would be better organized,
and they could be updated and managed independently. In the future, we
might even think about packaging both the provider itself and the
backend app, which would be a much better user experience. Also, for
beginners it would be easier and less intimidating to have a simpler
toolbox (and with just the algorithms that are more robust and work
always out of the box), and then extend it as needed.

So, in short, I would like to discuss the idea of taking out most of
the providers and have them outside of the core code, so they can be
installed as complements that enhance Processing, instead of some of
them being core and some of them not.

Let me know what you think

Thanks!

I like the idea of modularity. However, requiring the user to do extra
steps to use GRASS, SAGA, GDAL/OGR, that are already shipped with our
packages, seems a bit of hindrance.
All the best.

Hi, 

I would also prefer a double dev cycle, followed by a double test
period. So just shift the one month from the first dev cycle towards the
end. 

In Bonn we discussed this and I think the double dev cycle was an
option, but we said we would decide in December/January when we know
more about the state of the 3.0. 

I had a look at the past couple meeting minutes and apparently there
haven't been any decisions in the minutes about the release date of QGIS
3.0. 

Ultimately it is Jürgen who decides as the release manager. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

+1 for this idea.

Small offtopic note: IMHO for Processing should not install
providers/scripts/models/etc. Better to use Resource Sharing
plugin for this to unify user experience.

Hi Victor,
about this, we need to think of upgrading process so that a user raising
QGIS version will have no choice but to also upgrade the locally installed
stuff (providers, algs, ..) to avoid version conflicts. We should probably
then have some metadata with min and max processing version for providers
and algorithms to ensure consistency.
It might be a way full of caveats probably. Also, does that fit with the
idea from Matthias and Nyall of having core processing capabilities to have
them enabled in Android (or any python unfriendly platform) ?.

Cheers
Régis

Hi all,
I propose I add this as a discussion topic at the end of the Lyon Code
Sprint next week. We'll maybe have a clearer view of how much work is
remaining.

@Paolo, I think we are not yet in polishing step, some really low level
things still need to be broken and rebuilt. See there:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues

Yes, we should watch that, but the mechanism for adding algorithms
into Processing hasnt changed in a while, and is not likely to cause
issues. In any case, now Processing cannot be updated separately from
QGIS, so it should be enough to define in the plugin the min and max
versions of QGIS, as usual

I like that idea very much (i have to reply to that email, BTW...),
and this is not a problem. Functionality will be put into core and
then wrapped by Processing. Most likely that core functionality, when
exposed through Processing, will be added to the native QGIS
Processing provider, so it will be a core stuff in Processing as well.
And if not, the functionality will be there in QGIS, although not
exposed through Processing, but the user could add the corresponding
provider easily

About the idea of putting core classes like GeoAlgorithm, etc in core,
this should no affect that at all.

Thanks for your ideas!

Let's not forget that while of us on the dev mailing list run on home-made

I agree with this point. I like to see us push attention toward the
native algorithms, as those are the only ones we have direct control
over and which we are in a position to improve and bug fix.

Agreed.

Slightly off topic, but I'm not sure (yet) if we should port the
actual algorithms themselves to c++. For my purposes (Matthias might
disagree here) it would be sufficient to allow algorithms to be fully
created in c++ only if required. Otherwise, I quite like having the
algorithms themselves as small python wrappers around inbuilt
functionality.

What I *would* like to see is for all the "heavy lifting" to be moved
out of the python algorithms and into the corresponding c++ classes.
Eg for an algorithm like the minimum oriented bounding box alg the
geometry operations should be moved to QgsGeometry and the algorithm
just become a lightweight wrapper around this functionality. IMO this
approach has numerous benefits, including speed and better
re-usability both within processing and with other plugins. I
personally think it's also nice for most of these operations to be
available as expression functions so that they can be used in
symbology, labeling, geometry generators etc.

I am not sure I would just move everything to core. The advantage of
having only a couple of them in core and many of them written in python
gives us many more developers who develop and fix them.

The important bit is, that python is an option and no longer a requirement.

What would be interesting is to port one or a few algorithms to C++ and
see how big the performance impact is.

IMHO separating "nice to have" from crucial stuff will help us deciding
where to channel efforts, and when to draw a line.

I have seen some people creating huge FME workbenches, and what I see is 
that these models are almost never 'linear'.. that is: never work in 
'efficient pipes'. But often more like: we grab some data from here, 
from there, combine, do something on it, calculate something from the 
whole, reproject and rewrite some attributes and output it to ... a db.

I mean to say: some kind of intermediate disk-format is needed anyway?
What I have heard from 'the others' is that they use some binary 
(spatially indexed?) file format? Would that be an option for us?
Looking to the python world where you can 'pickle' arbitrary objects to 
disk. Is there something like that available in cpp?

Would adding a epsg/crs code not be enough? In postgis/oracle spatial 
there is also a crs-code in every geometry isn't it? Not sure about that...

This all means a stronger api isn't it? To be implemented in whatever 
language you prefer? That is always good isn't it :-)

Yes, that's true. Sometimes. The idea is to skip it where possible and
to apply it where not possible. Transparently.

I think the order of precedence would be (always depending on the
involved algorithms)

1. Manual user configuration
2. Iterator
3. GeoPackage
4. Shapefile

I think that all the code that does some analysis itself and computes
layers or geometries or whatever, that should be in C++ if possible,
and then accesed from Processing. No need to start porting stuff if
there is not a real need in terms of performance or reusability, but I
think that everything that is not the framework itself can be taken to
C++ and the design would be cleaner

Yes, mainly because of that, since all provider would be treated
equal. Now the providers that are in core seem to be rather arbitrary
to me. We have Lidar Tools or TauDEM in core, while lwgeomlib
(probably more useful for most users) is a separate plugin itself.

Also, if we move all providers to separate plugins, that will serve as
 example for those creating their own algs, which i hope will help in
encouraging people to add functionality through Processing.

Anyway, this might not be the biggest advantage. Having a more
atomized approach like this gives us more posibilities, from my point
of view

Message-ID: <ae97ba87-061b-bece-76c0-18555e39ef2b@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently compiling both master and release_2_18 on a linux machine
(with make, not debian rules, and I run them directly from the output
folder, thanks Matthias for the advice ;))

I set the WITH-CUSTOMWIDGET ON for both qgis2_18 and master (not sure if
this is needed)

To have the QGIS Widgets in Qt Designer I also had to install
liqgis-customwidgets and the 2 dependencies (libqgis-core and libqgis-gui)

But, even with this settings a custom and empty plugin (so just a simple
plugin build with the Plugin Builder), if the UI has some QGIS Widgets,
with all widget I get this error:

ImportError: No module named qgscolorbuttonv2

I find this workaround:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-August/044138.html


I was just wondering if this is the normal behavior of if my machine
needs some more settings


Thanks to all

My original email didn't result in much feedback at all from users.
I've been thinking further about this and I'm now wondering if we
should take a more aggressive stand with these plugins leading into
3.0.

What I'd like to do now is put two of these plugins on "notice".
Specifically evis and oracle raster. No-one seems interested in
actively maintaining or improving them anymore. The only changes
they've seen in recent years are changes required to keep them
compiling. Oracle raster hasn't seen a bug fix since 2010 and no
enhancements since it was introduced in 2009, and evis last had a
specific bug fix in 2011 and last had a performance enhancement in
2009. I think it's safe to say these plugins have been abandoned by
their original authors.

Given this, I think we should remove them from 3.0. First we could put
out a general notice saying they will be removed if no-one steps
forward to maintain (or sponsor) them. And failing a positive result
from that remove them from 3.0.

Hi Matteo,

Having the error on master sounds correct, since QgsColorButtonV2 really
doesn't exist anymore (replaced by QgscolorButton [0]).

As I wrote already in the topic, issues seem to arise when using
uic.loadUi. Are you using this approach?

Personally, I use pyuic without any issue (you just need to be sure that
you have qgis in your python path, which requires attention in your case
since you don't install qgis).

Best wishes,

Denis

Yep, I'm with you: clean 3.0 up: remove them and let's bring only back 
those that are being asked for.

While we are on 'plugins' do we need anything to 'upgrade' the plugin 
api/system?

Are there no new insights around plugins that we can pick up now that we 
have the opportunity?

- Maybe make python + cpp plugins more like each other so I do not see: 
"(checkCppPlugin) [0ms] Failed to get name, description, category or 
type for" anymore...
- issues around server/desktop plugins
- maybe stream-line processing-algorithms and python plugins more, so 
the can maybe more interchangable
- whatever makes us as devs/users happy...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ok got it.. anyway, I have the same error also with QgsDataDefined
button and all the other Qgs widgets..

yep..

uic.loadUi(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'prova_dialog_base.ui'))

ok maybe we got the guilty here (and that's me as always.. :) )

how can I export qgis in my python path? Something like that?


export QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/build-qgis2/output/"
export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/python/qgis
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/$USER/.qgis2/python/plugins

Hi all,

I been working on a plugin that uses another python requirements like lxml.

The problem it's that I solved the requirements problem on Linux calling
pip command but this don't work on QGIS with Windows because Windows don't

In my opinion QGIS API should provide a way to install packages but i
supose that it's not so easy as I imagine.

How do you use to solve this problem?  There is any example of it?  I
searched it on the documentation and don't appear any reference about how
to do it.

Hi Xavier!

We've considered adding a mechanism for plugin dependencies, (I've recently
added a metadata for that purpose) but this seems a bit difficult to work
cross-platform, BTW I'd be very happy to see some efforts in that area.

What we normally do is to package and ship dependencies with the plugin
itself, you can have a look to this example:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-plugin/blob/master/pavement.py#L48

Cheers.

Hi Denis,

I changed the file as you suggested:

#!/bin/bash
export QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/matteo/lavori/QGIS/build-qgis2/output/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/python

$QGIS_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/qgis $@


but I still have the import error..
BTW, I am sure I have build QGIS with the release_2_18 branch and with
customwidget variable set to ON

Thanks for the help and for your time!

Matteo

Hold on.. I should have manage it..

I discovered that my machine was missing the file

qgis_customwidgets.py

in the folder

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/


in another machine I found that file and I copied it in the right folder
(the above one) and now it seems working, that is the plugin with the
custom widget is now correctly loaded without any more issues..

So many thanks Denis for the assistance..


My question is now.. why was that file missing in the folder?
In the other machine I ran Ubuntu and I was used to compile QGIS with
debian rules.
In this new machine I compile QGIS with make and run it directly from
the output folder (so QGIS has never been installed with repository
packages and/or deb files, don't know if this could be related to the
problem)

I have some confusion on my mind..

If this is worth I can put this solution (if you think it is a solution
and not a workaround) somewhere in the website or another place so that
other people facing the same problem could solve the issue.

Many many thanks to all

Matteo

Hi Matteo,

The file is not present simply because you did not install QGIS.

See here https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/CMakeLists.txt#L287


Having it documented somewhere would be nice:

* Approach when installing

* Without installing: were to put libqgis_customwidget and
qgis_customwidgets.py, how to run pyuic.


Cheers,

Denis

Salut Denis,

I'm a bit lost, I see in plugins like the resources sharing tool [0]

<customwidgets>
  <customwidget>
   <class>QWebView</class>
   <extends>QWidget</extends>
   <header>QtWebKitWidgets/QWebView</header>
  </customwidget>
 </customwidgets>

and when I install the plugin I see:

This plugin is broken
No module named QtWebKitWidgets.QWebView

this plugins also use the uic.loadUi approach

I've qgis installed from packages and also self build:
marco at placebo:~/dev/QGIS/master/python/custom_widgets$ locate
libqgis_customwidgets.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/plugins/designer/libqgis_customwidgets.so.2.18.1
marco at placebo:~/dev/QGIS/master/python/custom_widgets$ locate
qgis_customwidgets.py
/home/marco/dev/QGIS/master/python/custom_widgets/qgis_customwidgets.py
/home/marco/gis_data/pacsafe/QGIS/python/custom_widgets/qgis_customwidgets.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/qgis_customwidgets.py
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/uic/widget-plugins/qgis_customwidgets.pyc



Am I missing some magic somewhere? QtWebKitWidgets exists only from Qt5.
in Qt4 it should still be QtwebKit.

ciao
Marco

Hello,

if we'd like to compete with FME, I think that we need a shell tool to
run jobs without a graphic engine (or at least without an opened
graphical user session). It could be used on dedicated
servers to run a series	of jobs	during the night. FME has the same
sort of	tool (in fme.exe).

I think	that this script (probably coded in Python) should be included
into QGIS core to provide a better support and integration with
Processing. The	jobs could be defined in .model files like those in
Processing modeler and we could	add some dynamic parameters to re-use
the model for different	sources/targets.

This script could also be used as the "worker" behind an
administrative web interface or	something similar.

Cheers

Hello,

I do agree with	Paolo point of view. Users need	to have	a ready	to use
Processing configuration for most of the 'external' providers. As the
main installation package (for MS-Windows) incorporates GRASS, end
users expect that they can launch GRASS	algorithms directly into QGIS
(via Processing of course).

On the software development side, I advocate to	keep the external
providers into core for the moment. I have worked on the GRASS7
provider and being a part of core is something that is very convenient
and comfortable	for me because most of the time, I need	to add some
(often minor) evolutions into Processing core before being able	to add
features/fix bugs into GRASS7 provider.	Furthermore, I can benefit
from QGIS infrastructure, particularly for bug tracking.

I fear that it could be	much less easy to maintain an independent
plugin provider	because	it involves more sysadmin work for the
maintainer (need to open a dedicated code repository, a dedicated
bugtracker). I know that this part seems to be quite easy with Github
but it could also add more work	for things to be done.

On my last commit, I have made some minor modifications	for three
external providers in only one PR. Having independent plugin providers
would have implied 3 PRs.

I am not completely closed to focus the	dev work into Processing core
but I think that external providers are	not ready to be	externalized
(at least for GRASS7):
- we should wait for 3.0 to be released	because	we need	to finish the
port to Python3/Qt5 port, otherwise, there is a	real risk for
discarding some	external providers for lack of 3.0 support.
- we should also try to fix all bugs (at least the major ones) before
thinking to externalize	something. This	is not the case	for GRASS7
(but I am working on it).
- external providers need (nearly) complete unit test coverage.
- we need sufficient time to get feedback from	users, after the 3.0
release, to get assured that there is no major problem involved in the
Python3/Qt5 port.

As a conclusion, I am not completely close-minded to external
Processing providers externalization but I think that it should	be
postponed after 3.0 or 3.2 release...

Cheers

Hi Marco,

This doesn’t sound like a QGIS custom widget issue since QWebView is not related to QGIS.
It seems that QWebView is well defined in PyQt4 compatibility layer [0].
The issue is probably that you try to run system uic instead of qgis.PyQt.uic.

This make me thunk of the reply to Matteo as well….try to run qgis.PyQt.uic instead of uic

I hope this helps

Denis

Hi Denis,

I tried to run

FORM_CLASS, _ = qgis.PyQt.uic.loadUiType(os.path.join(
os.path.dirname(__file__), 'prova_dialog_base.ui') )

after removing the qgis_customwidget.py file from /usr directory

but I still have the same error..

should I import some specific module in the plugin in order to have
qgis.PyQt.uic available?

Thanks!

Matteo

Hi Xavier

1) pip can be installed on OSGeo4W (many references on the gis stack
exchange and on the web)
2) paver do nothing other than creating python eggs or now you can use
wheel format, then setting pythonpath starting the plugin allow you to
load module from local modules... paver is a utility to simplify
packaging

cheers

Hi Denis, 
I was just put of by the fact that the xml tag is called customwidget.

They are in fact promotet widgets. And I really wonder how this can work.

Could you try the resource sharing plugin. Does it work for you?

Ciao

Sorry i might have a bit unclear.  I know that it works if in the promoted widget you put PyQt4.QtWebKit (or qgis.PyQt....)

What Im wondering is how this other plugins can work using QtWebKitWidgets

Ciao

Well, it made QGIS crash upon installation.
And now QGIS doesn't start anymore:

I get Warning: Object::connect: No such signal QWebPage::loadProgress(int)
And then a seg fault....

No real time to investigate...but probably due to the fact that I
compiled without QtWebKit.

There are two other plugins: Topology Checker and Geometry Checker.
IMHO their functionality should be merged and moved to analysis library.

I am getting transformation object from map canvas (when loading
vector data - QGIS doesn't recognize from PRJ file EPSG:5514 and set
up map canvas crs to a new user-defined crs):

"""
crs = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapSettings().destinationCrs()
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(str(crs.authid())) // -> USER:100000
"""

will return crsSrc.isValid() False value. Thanks, Martin

Hi Arnaud,

 

As suggested by others, a QEP for mapping fields would be great. Some of the Processing tools (e.g. merging layers) can also benefit from that.

Cheers

Hi Arnaud,

I am really looking forward to seeing such feature implemented in QGIS, thanks for bringing up the discussion.

I would also recommend going for a QEP, as it is a largely foreseen feature, and I suppose everyone has its own definition and use-case...

>From my point of view, we should go for a very generic field-mapping mechanism which could be used in many places such as copy-paste. A way of reading/saving configuration would be quite useful, like presets.

Best wishes,

Denis

Hello QGIS devs, 

I want to add a field mapper dialog when pasting features to layers. 

For now when pasting features with attributes names that do not exists on the destination layer, 
those attributes values are lost. 

When clipboard fields and destination layer fields are not strictly the sames, 
In QGIS 3.0, I want to popup a new dialog with fields mapper configurator. 

Dialog UI could be similar to Refactor Fields Algorithm, showing a list of destination fields : 

    source expression (expression widgets) => destination field 

For example, I often use this workflow : 
    Open a shapefile or autocad file. 
    Use the refactor fields to get temporary layer with same fields as destination. 
    Paste to postgis database layer. 

I think having this dialog showing up when needed could really ease data manipulation from one layer to another. 
And I want to give the possibility to use expressions. 

Any remarks, do you think I need to open to open a QEP for that ? 

Regards

Hello Xavier,

here we are used to create a virtualenv at build time (in make build or 
make install target), in the plugin folder,
the virtual env site-package folder is added to the python sys path in 
plugin __init__.py file before the class factory.

Note that it is necessary to add this virtualenv to the plugin package 
(in make package target for example).

With this the plugin package can be big, but is self contained.

Cheers

virtualenv has nothing to do with osgeo4w

virtualenv is a tool to create a site-package folder and install 
packages with pip.
you use it in your make file (easy with linux, but should not be much 
more difficult under windows)
you add it to your plugin package
if you add this folder in your python path (sys.path.append) at runtime, 
python will find them.

So virtualenv do not have to work in osgeo4w, you use it only at dev time.

Thanks Arnaud, I use virtualenv also, but I understood in your message that
there was a way to combine it with osgeo4w packaging.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] how to display a part of map
Message-ID: <28f9fb8d.4697.158e173ffee.Coremail.myculitong@163.com>

hello,
When I first loaded a map,I want to display a part of map,I used Qgsmapcanvas.setextent(),

But the map didn't change. The following code:

    QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(Layer);
    mapCanvasLayerSet.append(Layer);
    mapCanvas->setLayerSet(mapCanvasLayerSet);
    mapCanvas->setVisible(true);
    QgsRectangle r(0, 0, 800, 800);
    mapCanvas->setExtent(r,true);
    mapCanvas->setCachingEnabled(true);
    mapCanvas->refresh();
How to use setextent,I could not understand this,and how to display a part of map,Can you tell me ?
Thanks for help!!

Great to see people thinking about how to improve Processing...this is
really cool :-)

> 1. Rework native algorithms to avoid layer input/outputs

I like the idea very much, but not sure how that might integrate in
the modeler. An algorithm is now run only when the dependencies are
already run, which means that the buffer ones should have generated
all the buffered features (and if no file is involved, stored them in
memory) before the intersection can be run. The "streaming" approach
you propose is much better, but it wont work with the current modeler
approach. Not that it cannot work like that, but we might need to
rewrite some parts of the modeler, and it wont be a matter of changing
the input/output classes or reworking the GeoAlgorithm class itself.

I agree with all that. Especially the results and history dialogs,
which definitely need some love in terms of UI. There are other
elements in QGIS now that have a history, so it would be nice to store
all that in a single place. It might also give some more exposure to
the Processing history itself, which is an useful tool to learn how to
use Processing from the console or to repeat previous tasks just by
double clicking on the algorithm entry, but not many people use.


I will be happy to help with all this, so please add me to any
conversation you have around these topics.

Thanks a lot for all these ideas!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS shell: history
Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OeFQWcNjoYCAVidbSh4APASP8KhPMefNZr6NgzgB2erbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

is it possible to browse somehow history of commands in GRASS shell? I
tried up/down arrows, Alt+P/N. Nothing worked. It's also not possible
to change position of cursor? Only backspace is working for me. So if
I do typo I need to remove all characters, fix typo and write the rest
again.

Any tips? Thanks! Ma

it's also not possible to copy & paste commands from clipboard. It
makes shell usability quite limited. Martin

Stephen,

Your feature enhancement request has been heard, and as soon as this PR (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3851) is merged will be reality :).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use of protected/private in API
Message-ID: <8c104dc9-9efc-e859-7778-32824544d332@opengis.ch>

Hi,

Throughout the codebase, there are two different styles used when
declaring member variables and helper methods. Some classes are exposing
them as private (with just a few protected ones), others use protected
by default.

I assume that protected is coming from a pythonic background where no
private context exists. There is the __prefix in python to tag "private"
variables as such, which advises devs to be careful about a variable but
still gives anyone full access.

The main advantage I see is, that once in a while you run into a
situation where you wish to be able to modify some internals of an
instance because for whatever reason it doesn't behave the way you
expect/want it to behave.

The disadvantages I see are that instead of improving the API, one can
easily just "work around" it. Exploiting undocumented behavior which may
suddenly change in the future. There is also no __prefix in our API, so
without consulting the documentation there is no way to tell if
something should be considered public or not (e.g. the python console
will happily autocomplete it for you). In the python world, there's also
the @property annotation which can trigger side-effects when setting a
variable, something that doesn't exist in C++. I think it also makes the
binaries bigger and compilation slower.

>From my point of view, we should use C++ the way it was designed to be
used (public/protected/private as appropriate).

Is there something I missed?
And do you think we can be consistent with this?

Thanks
Matthias

Could it be an issue with your desktop manager? with Gnome 3 here I
confirm it's working well. If it does not, IMHO it's a bug.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FhQ1K85Y-8ojSOOuF6bReG47G6zYrvfWGs_cWMZoOuy9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The log tab of Processing tools in 2.18 does not render HTML and instead
prints the raw HTML source which makes the log pretty hard to read.

Having this issue on Ubuntu and Windows. Any chance we can get this fixed
in 2.18 anymore? Should I open a ticket?

Thank you and best wishes,
Anita

In that case, we might need to add a stub to the compatibility
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsWebView.html and use that class in the plugin
instead of QWebView.

This should at least solve the crash.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] loading multiple wfs layers causes unexpected
	behaviour
Message-ID: <41d2d8b0-330f-3ece-3138-42854cd2829e@terglobo.nl>

In a loop, my python script adds 4 WFS layers to a new layer group in my 
map. Before adding them I test for vlayer.isValid() and for some reason 
they randomly seem invalid. Adding 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 layers to my new 
group. Check attached screenshot.

I guess this might have to do with the remote WFS-service behind the 
layer's data. Could I use some kind of onReady() or isReady() functionality?
I hope someone can explain this behaviour?

Another, possibly related, thing I ran into; When I load a qgs-file 
containing some WFS layers, QGIS reports most of the WFS layers in the 
'Handle bad layers' dialog. When I press OK (without changing anything) 
some layers are "fixed" while others are still bad.


This is my script, sorry for the terrible dutch layer names etc:




import urllib
#from qgis.core import import
import time

plangebied = 'NL.IMRO.0796.0002120-1301'

'''

XFCE. I compiled the same version of QGIS (2.14.3) on my laptop
(Gnome3). You are right, both - up/down arrows (history) and paste by
middle mouse button worked.

Hi all,
currently a huge number of affected versions are displayed in the
dropdown for new tickets on the bugtracker (down to 1.7.3): wouln't it
be good to only leave the latest, e.g. from latest LTR?

Message-ID: <ae596feb-3b52-95ce-4fa1-c07de7c20d42@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
given the current momentum for clean-ups, it might be worthwhile to have
a look to the Identify panel. I have add some thoughts here:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15968
In addition, I think now time is ripe to get rid of the ubiquitous,
useless, and confusing "Band1" for singleband rasters (which IMHO can be
just called rasters, and specify only when a raster is multiband.
Comments welcome.
Thanks.

Hi,
I agree, would be nice to have some cleanup on this list and shorten it
(keep only release number for recent but not maintained releases instead of
many minor releases?). "master_2" should also be removed, no one should be
using it.

Regards,
H.

Thanks.
However, apparently it is not possible to delete older version: may be
because there are still tickets open? In this case we would need a
deeper clean up, checking which old tickets are still valid.
Worth the while IMHO, but possibly a lot of work.
All the best.

I think we all know that the bug tracker would need a major cleaning...
Still very much in favor of re-start clean moving away from Redmine.

About the "affected version" list: it can be modified in the "custom
fields" section of Redmine, is not anyway something I will do unless I
will receive a proper green light. Also consider that recently
regressions have been reported even in between point releases... that
would not help in making that list shorter...


cheers

Yes, please, take the opportunity of 3.0 to bring us a nice tool to
report issues.

That might be the chance to start with an empty list too :) Let users
port their own issues to github (sic).

Is there any status on that very long standed issue? Has a group being
created to sort out solutions?

Cheers,
Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] should core plugins not be available in plugin
	manager?
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7xadgrCLR91=2Q8ri5JCOQQXj6PiruUhJ+k5eEuaFd=NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

This has been discussed in the past, but i think no decision was
taken, so I want to bring back the discussion.

I think that core plugins should not be visible in the plugin manager,
and users should not be able to disable them. If they are core, they
should be active (the menus and buttons can be removed with the
"View/Customization..." functionality if the user wants to)

Since we removed the ftools plugin and now have the corresponding
functionality from Processing, some users are confused for not finding
the usual tools there. We have kept the same menus, for those that are
used to them and dont want to use the toolbox. However, if users do
not have Processing enabled, they won't see those menus. And it is not
obvious that they have to enable Processing to get something that
previously was a different plugin..

I think this is an interesting discussion, so if you have ideas or
think that this might have disadvantages, let's talk about it in here.


Thanks!

+++++1

Yes please. if it's core (plugin or not) it shouldn't be optional and
should be enabled always.
It's just confusing for people and honestly doesn't feel right having core
parts disabled/enabled, imagine if
the style dock or atlas stuff, etc was optional. Messy and confusing.

The other issue is when some of us don't run with all core plugins enabled
all the time it's hard to judge the
full state of things as a complete package e.g I see tons of screenshots
with the shortest path
plugin enabled and taking half the dock space when I bet most people would
never use it.

So a massive +1 from me on this one.

+1 by me

If it is a core plugin/functionality, means that it is of interest for most
users, makes no sense to turn it off.

This will solve a few common issues for newcomers.

+1

In fact, if accepted, why call them plugins?

massive +1 also from me, this has been always confusing for users. It
is funny because when I made this very same proposal by the time qgis

Agreed.

Only issue I see (and the reason I disable processing sometimes) is the 
brokeness of some providers when I mix and match versions of QGIS, or 
run older (compiled) versions of QGIS.

A good reason to have providers as independent plugins, as I proposed
in another email :-) You should be able to disable providers, but not
the Processing framework itself.

Hi Raymond,

I first tested in 2.18.1, and that one just worked, no matter how many 
times. Also the saving/opening of the project.

Then I went to a 2.14.7 version I have, and then one FAILED. In the 
debug information (you run debug version from cli don't you ;-) ) I found:
DescribFeatureType Failed
Googling that I found 'qgis wfs DescribFeatureType Failed' I found:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/205926/qgis-2-16-adding-certain-wfs-failed

which actually talks about exact the same service! Pointing to:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15395
which says:
Fixed per 4bcbc1e (and backported in master_2 in f17f6ac, and in 
release-2_16 a0e3e76)

pointing to this commit:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4bcbc1e4e7ce89237e48067e352d50079fdfa4a6

which looks like it had to handle an uncommon capabilities construct 
from the ruimtelijkeplannen.nl service ....

So I think 2.14 is not patched? You need to have latest 2.18 or 2.16 ...

maybe Even can comment on this? Is it possible to bring this fix in 2.14 
(LTR?)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Agreed that Processing should be always on. Also, IMO it should be
available as "qgis.processing" python module.

Richard,

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4bcbc1e4e7ce89237e48067e352d50079fdfa4a6 
was to fix a regression of 2.16.0 that didn't exist in 2.14
If I try the Bouwvlak layer in 2.14.8 (manually), that works, so I'm not sure what the issue 
you got with 2.14 is.

Hi,
I do not fully share the agreement on having core plugins not deactivable.
Are Core plugins the problem or is it Processing? Let's not wrongly mix
issues.

I'd always thought that Core plugins meant plugins developed, managed,
updated by the QGIS project itself, provided by default with installation.
It doesn't mean that everybody wants to use it or needs it. The Road Graph
is a plugin I had never executed in 5 years I'm using QGIS. Many others
(GPS Tools, Heatmap, rasters related plugins...) are concerned. Why would I
want it activated by default and crowd the GUI? Then I'd have to struggle
and change some somehow hidden customization option to have it disabled?
Uncheck it in Plugin Manager sounds far simpler.

What puzzled many users (and might still do) with Processing in QGIS >=2.16
is to have removed fTools and not activate Processing by default for those
that were using fTools. They should be provided a transparent replacement
of fTools (including the removal of this one from the list).
And maybe communication about this change is not clear for all people.
Currently, fTools state is broken but there's no message to tell you that
you should instead activate Processing to get back your lovely functions.

So, from me, no, Core plugins should stay (de)activable even though looking
at all the list of Core plugins being integrated in Processing in 3.0 I
wonder how many Core plugins will stay (DB Manager and Processing?) when
3.0 lands. :)

Also, one of the power of QGIS imho is its modularity: you pick what you
need. We should not put all in one. And having Core plugins being listed
there gives some kind of confidence to contributors to follow the path
(create plugins). I'm not sure i well expressed what I meant to.


Regards,
Harrissou

I'm a +1 / -1 on this!

To explain: I'm +1 on processing being removed from the list and being
made always-on. Processing is an integral part of QGIS now and I see
no reason why anyone should want to run QGIS without processing.

I'm a strong -1 on making all core plugins enabled and mandatory. My
reasoning here is that the current batch of core plugins is a random
mix of stuff of varying value and usefulness. Historically a lot of
them are just there because they were introduced before the current
python/plugin infrastructure was in place and no one has removed them
yet. I see absolutely no value in making plugins like "oracle raster",
"evis", or "gps tools" manadatory, and lots of reasons why they should
not be (ui clutter, no-one maintaining these plugins or addressing
bugs in them). Even a useful plugin like "coordinate capture" adds a
lot of UI clutter and should not be mandatory.

There's also the issue that we have core plugins with overlapping
functionality (geometry checker vs topology checker).

I think in future we could re-asses this, but right now we need to
first focus on cleaning up, consolidating and purging the existing
plugins (see https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/67). Then we
should evaluate whether the remaining core plugins should be ported to
python and moved from the core repo to instead exist as separate
standard plugins.

Yeah I do agree with this point.  Remove what isn't needed first then make
the rest always on, or even better just
remove the whole core plugin concept completely as it doesn't make sense
IMO.

I've also been thinking... maybe we should make a QEP about "no more
core plugins, no exceptions!", get it agreed upon and accepted, and
then block any future additions of core plugins.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Listener for Atlas Change Page
Message-ID: <CA+T52Az2Luk8wrrrVDrwegGDgjiHYxPWO9az4Uwehm8mOmqbNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm interested in being able to make graphs that update depending on
what the active feature in the atlas is. I know some python and a
little bit of the QGIS API, but I'm curious - is there some sort of
listener function for the atlas that gets called whenever the Preview
Atlas/Prev Feature/Next Feature/First Feature/Last Feature buttons are
pressed?

What I eventually want to do is to manipulate the node items that were
created in a recent updated version of QGIS, and use them to make a
line graph, gridlines, etc.

I'm hoping to draw the data directly from the shapefiles themselves or
from a .csv file.

I originally tried to use an expression in a text box to do this, but
it seems that expressions are unable to use custom functions to
manipulate the composer. So I'm hoping that there's some sort of
Listener method.

Thanks.

Try QgsAtlasComposition::featureChanged. See

Hi, 

Before we remove the ability to have C++ plugins, or the ability to
enable/disable them, we should first inform our users and developers and
ask them if we are fine with what we propose. 

There may be usages of QGIS out there that rely on the ability to have
C++ plugins that we are not aware of. 

--------------- 

I do agree though that some core plugins could be removed or integrated
into the core. One example is the coordinate capture plugin, which could
be easily integrated in core, e.g. integrated in the identify tool or
status bar. 

Probably the EVIS plugin is another candidate with lots of overlaps. If
we add the missing functionality the EVIS plugin provides to core, we
could get rid of it.

To be clear this isn't removing the ability to have C++ plugins, just
having core plugins and making them optional.

Nyall,

I agree on your approach. Not all core plugins are the same. I guess I
didn't want to say "Hey, Processing has to be always enabled!" :-) But
yes, Processing is a particular case of a plugin, since other plugins
depend on it, and now it replaces ftools, so maybe it makes sense to
keep it there and always enabled, while that does not apply for other
plugins.

A bit of cleanup in the set of core plugins is needed, i agree with
that. This is similar to what happens (at a different scale) with
Processing providers. Some of them are there for historical reasons,
from a time when the project was smaller, but it makes no sense to
keep them there now.

Ok - thanks for clarifying.

What's the difference between a core C++ plugin and a C++ plugin?

Is the only difference that the core plugins are shipped and enabled by 
default?

A core plugin can be python as well.

Hi all,
just a reminder that we have a --noplugins startup option that will
deactivate plugins for testing purpose.
What would be then the intended behaviour with core python plugins like
processing?

On my side, I would keep an option to do that, and if possible not rename
it. So this is an argument to support the idea of naming them plugin
(because they are plugins from a code point of view).

Thinking loudly, maybe a CLI option to choose explicitly the list of
plugins to load could even be better. That way default behavior will always
have plugins loaded, but edge uses cases still have a way to avoid loading
some at all.
Opinions?
Régis

IMO anything core is no longer a plugin, processing included.  We don't
have these options for stuff like Python console etc so it doesn't make
sense to have it for the rest.

+1. Plugins should be "extra" things. Even if they are formally a
plugin, things like DB manager or Processing should be considered core
and handled just like, for instance, the layers panel or the python
console. Will be clearer for user also, i think. They dont have to
know about the implementation, if it's C++ or Python, or that kind of
things...they just have the functionality in there and use it.

Hi list, 
my plugin OpeNoise uses fTools (it is imported in the code). 
In the 2.16 and superior Qgis versions fTools doesn't exist and consequently my plugin Openoise doesn't work. 

How can I change my code in an easy way? 

Thanks.

The current QGIS ships with SAGA-GIS 2.1.2.

There are many version since 2.1.2 and the latest version of SAGA-GIS is 3.0

Wonder if QGIS 3.0 will use SAGA-GIS 3.0.

Hi Stefano,
you need to use processing. FTools algorithms were moved htere.

Unlikely since its not a long term supported release.

The 2.3.x LTS releases from SAGA are not properly supported in QGIS yet 
either.

Hi,

I compiled and installed QGIS 3 - which worked fine. But at start of 
QGIS, none of the Python plugins seem to work, e.g. processing, 
db-manager, etc. all fail.

Is this expected behaviour or is there something in my compile settings 
that would make these Python "core" plugins work in QGIS 3.0 on Python 3?

Thanks,

Andreas

Define "fail", I guess. Most plugins won't work without modification
[citation needed], but it would be good to know *how* it fails, as you are
right that there could be a more general issue.

Processing and db manager works under QGIS. What are the error messages you
get? I d suspect missing Python 3 modules/packages being problem here.

During compilation there is (was?) a script which fixed python2 lingua 
to python3 (scripts/2to3). You need python3 future for that (on Debian):

pip3 install future

Maybe during your compilation/installation this step failed?

There are also some plugins already (preliminary, as api can still 
change) ported to 3:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=3.0

The Core plugins you name, work here with me on Debian testing.

Richard

well, for once most plugins will fail at from PyQt4 import *, then they
could fail at any API break.

the core plugins go trough 2to3
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/scripts/2to3) that should
fixup most of the problems.

on ubuntu 16.10 DBman and processing work.

If you are porting a plugin to QGIS3 I suggest you to have a look at the
qgis2compat plugin which will make your life much easier in keeping a
plugin working wut the QGIS 2 and 3 API.

Hi,

I get a message:

------------

Unable to load GdalTools plugin.

The required "osgeo [python-gdal]" module is missing.

Install it and try again.


------------


then there is a new error message:


--------------


ImportError: No module named 'osgeo'


--------------


I installed gdal from source, but enabled Python and also enabled shared 
libraries.


Could it be that gdal was compiled with Python 2 while QGIS runs with 
Python 3?


If that's the case, how can i compile GDAL with Python 3 support?


Can I compile gdal with Python 2 and 3 support if I want QGIS 2.x and 
3.x on the same machine?

Thanks,
Andreas

could be,
it could also be a PYTHONPATH issue depenndign where you installed the
bindings.

can you import them in a python prompt?

to build gdal with python 3 you need to do some thing like:
cd gdal/swig/python
python3 setup.py build & python3 setup.py install

IIRC gdal compiles in its source dir so for qgis for android I just used
to copy the whole GDAL folder before building to keep a clean copy.

Hi Marco,

Thanks - this helped a lot. Apparently it was the missing python3-gdal 
bindings. I only had the bindings for python2. Processing now seems to 
work fine (at least the few tests I did).

However, db manager still fails to start with error message:

Can you confirm that DB-manager should work fine with the latest master?

yes - I used the instructions from 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL

but all "geo" libraries (geos, gdal, spatialite, postgres/postgis) had 
been installed from source.

Is there a dependency python module list for db manager available?

python3-psycopg is installed. Any other SQL modules or other modules the 
DB manager requires?

ah - yes, now it works after Martins fix.

So a side-effect of your refactoring.

No problem

Thanks all who gave me hints. I should be fine now.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Different file format for GML QGIS vs Processing
Message-ID: <bba462c3-9327-63c4-a2a7-3ec07316bbd5@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm approaching to do some more test of Processing. I followed the guide
on the repo (and also Matthias gav me some super useful advices) but
something is strange with the output of Processing itself.

I'm using QGIS 3 on a Linux Mint machine (fresh compiled) and when I
save a vector as GML as external file with Processing 2 files are created:

1. layer.gml
2. layer.xsd

Instead if I save the same layer from QGIS (or another shapefile) as
GML, QGIS writes 2 files:

1. layer.gml
2. layer.gfs


I saw that in the expected folder of the processing test there are only
gml-gfs file.

Could the .xsd file gave some problem when running tests? Even if not,
why the saving process creates different file whether one uses QGIS or
Processing?


Thanks to all

Matteo

Hi all,
just compiled, testing the new functions, but I cannot get any result,
starting from OSM unprojected data. Anyone more lucky?
A few notes:
* the new widget to get coordinates from canvas is supernice, can it be
uses for other modules (e.g. r.viewsed, and others from GRASS) as well?
* in case of projected layers, the coords as taken from the canvase
should be backprojected to original layer CRS.
* several commands are still missing to be on par with GRASS v.net
modules: would it be usefult to make a list of missing functionalities?
Should I fill tickets not to forget about it?
All the best, and thanks Alex!

Thanks, that looks like exactly the kind of function that I'm looking
for. I'm using QGIS 2.18.0, I'm wondering, is there any way to use
this function without having to select a menu item in the the plugin?

I'm not sure how to get started, because most of the existing plugins
seem to be activated by a menu item or a toolbar button in the main
editor instead of via the atlas interface.

Thank you and I really appreciate the help!

I have used RoadGraph plugin several times with OSM data and it worked fine.
Also I tested Processing algs with projected and not projected OSM data, it
also worked for me. Maybe your points are placed too far from roads or network
itself contains gaps? In this case adjusting topology tolerance may help.

This widget was added about year ago or even later (can't remember exactly when
I made it). And of course it can be used in any Processing algorithm.

This is known issue and it is also happens for extent selector. There
are no solution
at the moment, but we (Victor and me) plan to work on it. Hope this
will be fixed before
release. Related ticket https://hub.qgis.org/issues/15680.

Well, I never thought about being on par with GRASS and don't know if this makes
sense.

I am aware of the issue, I tried increasing tolerance, with no results.
That happened with EPSG:4326; when switching to a metric CRS, it works.
My interpretation is that setting a too high tolerance, easy for degrees
(e.g. 1 degree is huge) makes it impossible to compute the path.
Maybe the user should be warned about this.

I do not see why not, e.g. che chinese postman, etc.

Thanks a lot.

However, when it does not:
* no message is sent to the user
* start and end points are not displayed on the canvas
* the shortest path, if created, does not have a distinctive style;
so it is not easy to understand what happens.
Sorry for appearing critical, I found it great to have this in Processing!
All the best.

Thanks!

Seems like this WFS service is not very stable at certain moments. 
Trying to figure out what is going on. But it doesn't seem to be a QGIS 
problem.

phew :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Most icons not displayed in OS X program menu on
	master
Message-ID: <AC4EB447-E413-47D4-92B3-5BBC1296EDDF@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I’ve built qgis master on OS X using Homebrew formula from qgis/homebrew-qgisdev repo (thanks Larry Shaffer). But there are barely any icons displayed in QGIS program menu (in fact I can only see “Project properties” and “Raster calculator” icons). Also menu icons are displayed as png and thus are pixelated on hidpi retina display. The issue with screenshots was reported here https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/issues/8 <https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/issues/8> but seems like it’s an upstream qgis bug.

I’d be happy to test master on OS X with hidpi further as soon as I setup QT dev environment.
Cheers,

P.S. New logo looks so sleek, 3.0 should be a blast!

Message-ID: <CAECJsSoMWa756_+N2M+ca83eH4LkwWgeX2-3zw8pFNqeniw-aw@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,
*Disclaimer*: I'm a long-term Windows user who is learning Linux. And I'm
not a developer so be patient.

Before I pulled a request to master branch I decided this time to build
QGIS and check my changes. I often heard people say "Use Linux; it's so
easy to do that". And while a year (or more) ago I completely fail to
understand which version of tools I should install to do that on Windows (7
or 8), this time it looks very straightforward.
I followed instructions at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html
(note that it should be updated as there still is:
- a section entitled Qt4
<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc4>
while its content is all about Qt5 and, Qt4 has nothing to do with QGIS 3
if I'm not wrong
- a section entitled Qt5
<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc12>
which warns you about using Qt5)

So, I followed these instructions, regardless Qt4 title:
- create the same folders at the same places
- run "ccmake .." indicate the $home/apps folder as destination folder for
the application (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)
- run "make"
-  and then run "make install", showing many lines that point to my apps
dir. I get a failure due to right access to some folder (I don't know why).
So I run "sudo make install" which went till the end with no failure (that
i can see)

But when all this finishes tens of minutes later, my home/apps dir remains
EMPTY. No QGIS to launch!

If someone has an idea where I should investigate thanks very much. Or if
you need me provide more information, let me know...

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi H,

Linux is fun, and compiling QGIS makes you a cool dude ;-)

let's chat on irc or telegram...

You don’t have to run “make install” and simply run QGIS after “make” :

If you cd to QGIS_BUILD_DIR/output/bin/ and run ./qgis

pfiuuu! Two days I'm struggling and "googling" things here and there. I
should have asked here earlier
This information needs imho to be available in the

This is common behavior for all Processing algs: outputs added using QGIS
random styling. You can easily fix it by assigning desired style for algorithm
output using "Edit rendering styles for outputs" tool from algorithm context

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Most icons not displayed in OS X program menu

Hi,

I also have another problem on the build on mac.
If I go to the `QGIS` menu and then `preferences` it opens the Processing
options and not the options from QGIS.
It seems specific to mac.

In the Processing menu, I don't have the `options` entry.
The only way I can go to the QGIS preferences is to go in a composer and
then preferences. There, it works.

Regards,
Etienne

If you setup $home/apps and use sudo so check /root/ apps :)
If you made a mistake, check /usr/local/bin/qgis, who knows :)

I could show you one day how I do in my laptop with several version at the

Yes, thanks; IMHO it would be good to have a deafult style for some alg,
as e.g. GRASS does.
All the best.

here you are:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15983
thanks
BTW, going through them I see the interface would need a bit of love, as
the same options are described in different ways here and there.
Any user could help us making it more consistent.

you can filter for v.net, 20 commands now, some seem really useful
additions to me.

All the best, and thanks a lot.

Hi Shawn,

Have a read up on how signals and slots work in PyQt. Basically you
can listen out for the signal and get it to trigger a function in your
python class. Untested psuedocode below:

class AtlasListener(QObject):
   def featureChanged(self, feature):
      print('new feature: {}'.format(feature.id())

  def setComposition(self, composition):
      composition.atlasComposition().featureChanged.connect(self.featureChanged)

l=AtlasListener()
l.setComposition(iface.activeComposers()[0].composition())

Message-ID: <CAB28AsgF7xbUwAKu1WRVqTNpQxZdyOVa3sx9iuz_DKrS0q04mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/85
for a newly filed QEP which proposes that we block any future c++
plugins being introduced to the master codebase.

This follows from recent discussions about the future of existing c++ plugins.

Yes please! I've often wondered about this protected-by-default
behaviour and what the rationale behind it is.

Another reason why it should be avoided is that protected member
variables cannot be exposed to the python bindings. So if it's
important that they can be accessed/modified by subclasses, just
making them a protected member isn't sufficient. Instead they require
protected getter/setter functions.

Amy other plugins - currently core or not - which should also be migrated to
core and stop being plugins at all? Or just Processing and DB Manager? I
can't think of any.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What happens with shapefile spatial indices (QIX)
	when editing?
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C57FDDAB@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi everyone

I was just wondering about spatial indices for shape files in QGIS. If I edit a shapefile with an index (QIX), lets say move a point, and then save the layer. What will happen to the spatial index?

If I create a point shape file I QGIS 2.18.1, create a spatial index, add a point, save the layer, then the QIX file is gone. Shouldn't it be updated to match the geometry changes instead?


Regards, Casper

Ideally, but the update of an existing .qix isn't implemented, so for now, you'd have to 
recreate it from scratch each time, which could take some time.

Hello Qgis-developer Osgeo members,

Here is Eduardo Silverio da Silva, from UFPR in Curitiba, Brazil. I am a
master's student in Geodetic Sciences.
I am contacting this community because I would like some help to answer and
to share my questionnaire about geoprocessing algorithms/codes:

English version:

Spanish version:
https://goo.gl/forms/2K9A04nwMORbafBe2

Portuguese version:
https://goo.gl/forms/EMtNDOdw5MIL8KmP2

To answer, the person must be from the ​​Geosciences area
(Cartography/Surveying, Geography, Forestry, Geology, Geophysics,
Oceanography, Agronomy)
or anyone who has already used some GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS, etc).

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Hi List

The Binary problem (?):
In this recently added plugin I can find cython modules precompiled in
forms odf pyd, or so. (and relative cython code)
Following the presentation in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz3jbM_JBTo
I understand that the reason is performance, but how to prevent
loading malicious shared objects?

* probably we should start to plan a safe infrastructure to allow
uploading plugin with compiled modules... any idea other than a simple
checksum?

The license problem (?):
other question is regarding the cython algorithm. I can read in
https://github.com/AequilibraE/AequilibraE/blob/master/aequilibrae/paths/AoN.pyx#L23
"Codes for route ennumeration, DAG construction and Link nesting were
written by Pedro Camargo (2013) and have all their rights reserved to
the author"

Obviously the author has right reserved, an in the same code the
author refer to the LICENSE.txt that is a standard GPL license:
here: https://github.com/AequilibraE/AequilibraE/blob/master/aequilibrae/paths/AoN.pyx#L18
and here: https://github.com/AequilibraE/AequilibraE/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT

how should we have to read the "right reserved" sencence by the author?

Luigi Pirelli

Hi Luigi and Paolo,

           I corrected the problems you pointed out with AequilibraE and
re-uploaded it.

Luigi's concern with malicious code is a very valid one, and I would
actually appreciate to have a manner to have it checked. However, I would
appreciate if we could find a solution that does not prevent us from having
plugins that are compiled.

As Luigi pointed out, the code is written in Cython to increase performance
of the software, but it is still 5.5x slower than the proprietary software
that I used as a benchmark. In a nutshell, if it cannot be compiled, it
will never fly. So I would ask you guys to be considerate of this point.

My concerns might not even be valid, and I do apologize if that is the
case. I just must admit that, as an amateur software developer, I miss some
of the jargon used here when talking about more technical issues on
software development.

Cheers,
Pedro

Hi Pedro,

Nothing personal, your case is a common case due the fact to many
cases where to integrate external executables or shared objects.

we can have a way to certificate this binary (e.g. signing process but
could become harder develop plugins, checksums). In the meantime, I
strongly suggest to a have a two phase plugin. A first phase that
prepare running environment downloading so or dll from someware with
the user consensous, and then the running phase.

in this way you can facilitate users to access plugin thanks to qgis
repo, and turn around plugin limitations that community gave for user
security.

regards
Luigi Pirelli

I understand, Luigi.

Will the plug-in be authorized while I create this process?  Or do I need
to create it before the plugin goes back online?

Cheers,

Hi all

What's the main goal? Code availability? Security? Platform independency?
Just curious.

All the best

Hi Matthias,

Was the question directed to me?

If so, my objective is to make the code as efficient as possible (by having
it in Cython) and available in as many platforms as possible.

Cheers,
Pedro

Hi

the same as in previous plugin, there is a compiled java class in this plugin

Hi Pedro,

No, I just wanted to understand exactly, what the problems with compiled
code (in general) are. With a clear problem statement it's easier to
discuss a solution - and you can hopefully continue to ship your plugin
through the plugin infrastructure.

Hello!

I try to build master qgis with qt 7.5.1 (windows 10 msvc 2013).

qgis_analysis target building end with LINK error:

In this case the problem is security

code is available and compiled for most used platforms... but hard to
certify the content of the so/dll.

any opinion?

It would be nice to bundle a bunch of these 'out the box' and have a setting (enabled by default) to add one to a new project as the first layer by default. It would be a good resolution to the issue of having the first user impression being a blank page with not much indication of how to start looking at spatial data....

+1, it would be a very nice treat for our users
I rmemeber this suggestion has been put forward already, maybe it was
suggested to ask the service first, not to generate too much traffic
without their consent.
All the best.

I think we have to put a level of trust in here.  If the source is
available (ship it with the plugin please) and the user is trustworthy I
don't see a lot of harm here.

It's not ideal to have binary downloads however there are some use cases
for that so I would hate to not allow it when the rest is still valid e.g
valid license etc.

So, the security concern is, that there might be malicious code in
there? In case of the sourcecode provided alongside the binary, assuming
that potentially the binary might not match the provided code?

Possibilities I see:

1) Trust was also the reason for introducing the "trusted author" flag.
So maybe we could just build on the same fundament (e.g. require
sourcecode always to be present, trust "trusted authors" that their
binary matches the code, show a carefully worded warning, that the
plugin contains binary libraries provided by "X" and that the user
should only install this plugin if he fully trusts "X".).

2) The other way I see is to completely prohibit shipping binaries
through our own plugin server. Accepting that plugin devs start to ship
their plugins over other infrastructures which results in more
fragmentation.

3) Or the third way of offering "code review and signing services" but
that will be a lot of work to put into place, maintain and result in a
system which is exclusionary to small providers.

4) Or putting our own "build servers" into place, where you can upload
source code, the server will compile it and this way make sure, that
code and binary match. But given that we have already been dealing with
java and cython this morning, and that there are a bazillion other
languages out there, that's not gonna be easy.

5) And finally have an official statement that plugins can be shipped
through the official repo but that plugins should download compiled libs
from a 3rd party page.

I would propose to keep the barrier low, given that the security gain by
any of the systems is actually very low (except for a very restrictive
implementation of 3) which is also maintenance expensive). We probably
have to accept that we do not have the power to prevent anything bad
happening.

Personally I would just go a pragmatic way of 1) delegating trust to the
authors and keep plugins on our infrastructure, where we can also nicely
ask people to also upload the code to comply with the GPL.

Matthias

I also agree, pragmatic solution 1) leave to the user to trust. => a
big orange message warning the user!

btw I would add some requirements for plugin devs. e.g list at least
the following points:

1) the reason to have compiled parts (I had to look for a foss4g
presentation to knwow the reason)
2) the list of shared or executable (I casually discovered them)
3) the link to the source code (in the plugin or external)... I had to
grep the code to understand that code was available.
4) guide to build. This can be optional, but I would trust more a user
that expose how to reproduce the build.
5) checksums x plugin version

All these info can be contained in the plugin homepage in a standard
way (template). In this way we don't have to add tags in metadata
other than "BEWARE binary inside!"

opinions?

I think that the original intention for source-only plugins was:

1. make sure that there were no proprietary binary blobs
2. security

The second is theoretical since I don't think that we are checking all
plugins source code line by line, but we could do that if we wanted.

Since we have around 1K plugins and this problems arised two or three times
in the last 7 years (and one of those was in fact an attempt to introduce
proprietary code) I'd stick with the current rule n. 2.

If an author really needs to ship binaries, they can be shipped ship
through its own repo or he could make a downloader function inside a
bootstrapping plugin.

Are you confident that a no-binary policy is a good indication for
license issues?

License issues can also be triggered by other material like a
copyrighted images or even incompatible open source code (CDDL [1]).

On the other hand, if we have the code uploaded to our plugin service,
the chance is bigger that we realize missing source files and can
communicate with the author.

This sounds very reasonable to me.

Of course not, but if we have a binary blob we cannot check what's inside.

Hi Alessandro

this can be radical, but has the positive effect to introduce a "best
practice" to develop plugins with external binary dependencies... I
would agree, but what else respect that plugins that now have already
binaries and were accepted? Should be modified!

Last case from some minutes ago is this just approved plugin with a
jar included https://github.com/enricofer/QgisODK/tree/master/pyxform/odk_validate
that came from a nother external foss project.

Because everyone have to modify it's plugin to move to qgis3 => we
could leave proposal 1) for 2.x and proposal 2) for qgis3.0 giving
time to adapt the plugin to downloading binary from external repo.

cheers
Luigi Pirelli

I've just checked on the plugins site where somebody (I believe Paolo)
wrote a policy:

...
does not contain architecture-dependant binaries
...


As I said, I'm in favour of a source-only policy, there are easy technical
solutions to download binaries after installation if a plugin requires them
and hosting on our plugin site binary blobs that we cannot inspect doesn't
look a good idea to me.

... which in the two cases here (cython and java) shouldn't be triggered
because both are architecture independent.

If that doesn't sound like a good idea, I'm not sure it's better to
prefer a (silent) download of "some binaries" from "somewhere" in the net.
Just for reference, as far as I know, python wheels also allows
uploading pre-compiled binaries to their repo.
But I might also just be missing the point.

Hi!
I have a similar problem.
I try to build master qgis with qt 7.5.1 (windows 10 msvc 2013 and 2015).
But have Multiple errors and can not to build qgis:

qgis_core.lib(qgis_core.dll) : error LNK2005: "public: __thiscall

Maybe you know how to get rid of the error?

Crayfish plugin uses this approach
http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/products/crayfish/wiki

It download the binary libraries when installing the plugin from QGIS
repository.

Hi all,

looks like recently introduced spell-checking on Travis leads to
reporting failures
even if there are no build errors and all tests passed. This happens
with PR which
delete files, see for example
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/184481431#L1400 or

I wasn't aware to have an executable between my plugin sources.
In my case I have just removed it from the pyxform library as QgisODK
plugin does not require XForm validation and resubmit it to the repository.
But I think that if a library has an open source origin, a corresponding
licence, and is shared with a community should be normally accepted in a
qgis plugin bundle even if containing compiled binaries. We have to think
that gis is computationally intensive and a software like QGis is suited to
integrate different tools.
So I think that is not so useful for QGis users to strictly fulfil the "no
executable" policy. Protecting in this way QGis global stability we could
lose many opportunities, leaving them to proprietary systems much more
uninhibited.

Hi Enrico,

the fact that you weren't aware of a binary in your plugin give me
more reasons to propose an restrictive approach! I agree with you that
in some cases have binaries is a necessity, btw it's not complex to
design the plugin with a setup step.
I agree with Enrico and I continue thinking that we can have a loose
but explicit control by the user documenting any binary available in
the plugin (solution 1).

regards
Luigi Pirelli

Hi Alex,

This should be fixed with 4c43c1f [1]

Caching should be fixed as well for faster testing feedback

Message-ID: <F90DBAE453D1A444B0BD80E8F44D4C44DA8EEAE0@VNVBRWEX3.net.vlr.gv.at>

Hi,
please, can anyone tell me what default encoding QGIS uses when loading a Shapefile?
In my QGIS 2.14.7 on Windows 7 64bit  "Ignore shapefile encoding declaration" is checked,
so if I load a Shapefile with a corresponding utf-8-cpg-file using "drag and drop" it is encoded as 'system' and the encoding is wrong (what encoding is 'system'?).
If I load a Shapefile with a corresponding utf-8-cpg-file using "Add Vector Layer" it is encoded as 'utf-8' and the encoding is fine.
In both cases I can change the data source encoding in the properties dialog.

Is it possible to change the behavior of drag and drop to use utf-8

If I uncheck "Ignore shapefile encoding declaration"
and load the shapefile either using "Add Vector Layer" or drag and drop the cpg-file is interpreted correctly and the encoding is set to utf-8.
But now I cannot change the data source encoding in the properties dialog anymore.
I think it should still be possible to change the encoding in the properties dialog.

Peter

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Improving Processing help files
Message-ID: <e2df5e3f-b3da-6e30-6cc7-8a4278b45dc0@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm currently running some tests on QGIS3 - Processing and I just want
to share my idea.

At the moment, for almost all the core algorithms, there is a small
lateral tab with a brief summary help.
Help is taken (please correct me) from qgis.yaml file within the help
folder of processing.

IMHO, we can in some way improve the helping tab situation. My ideas are:

* re-enabling a help tab (next to Log) where we can be more discursive
about the algorithm leaving there the side help tab
* IMHO, really important could be to enable the adding of images, this
can really help a lot (think of how faster is to understand with a
description linked to images)
* for external algorithms (SAGA but also GDAL) it would be really useful
to have some kind of help (SAGA) and some more descriptive help (GDAL)


What do you think about it? Could be difficult to extend a kind of rst
like syntax to build the helping tabs?


Obviously I can help (a little with the code and more with testing and
adding description)


Thanks to all!


Matteo

Hi Matteo,

IMHO better to defer this until we decide general approach for
dealing with help. See:

Hi Peter,
welcome to the Babylon of computer stone age ;)

I think a lot of people share your confusion with codepages.
Your "system" encoding is that of your Windows, so presumably (in Western  
Europe) windows-1252 or CP1252 or ISO 8859-15.
On a Linux system, it is normally UTF-8.

I often run into problems with the encoding on my Linux system when  
dealing with files from Windows systems and vice versa.
Having files of mixed encodings in a project is a nightmare.
Those problems also seem to derive from files like gpx, kml etc. which  
always seem to be generated using UTF-8.
So even when I decide to handle everthing in Windows-style and convert  
files to windows-1252, those UTF-8 files bring in problems.
Same with the processing toolbox, where some algos happily switch the  
output encoding.

When unchecking „Ignore shapefile encoding declaration“, UTF-8 seems to be  
used internally (see https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11019).
But I have problems understanding all this, and worse, QGIS seems to not  
understand all this as well all the time.

P.s. Haven't touched ArcGIS for years. How does this handle different code  
pages in a project?

Regarding the presence of binaries,  I think there are three points :

1. why to preclude the presence of them?  Security? Transparency?

  If the point is the former,  are we implying that the rest of the code
will be inspected against malicious code? If the latter,  isn't it enough
to require the source code to be provided as well?

2. Doesn't this create an unnecessary hardship for small developers?

3. Are we risking to move back to a "many repositories" environment?

Cheers,
Pedro

Hi list, 
I'm trying to compile an '.ui' file with pyuic4 on Linux. 
I've got this error message:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Composer numeric scalebar thousands separator
Message-ID: <CAMCJChu_EfTFdid2KGNKuSUz63GQ7DmB2Rth-tRvYmLJ0n4Cpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using QGIS (OSGeo4W 64bits) and after the update from 2.18.1 to 2.18.2,
and from 2.14.9 to 2.14.10, I'm facing with a problem in Composer numeric
scalebar thousands separator. Windows regional settings has the point as
thousands separator and comma as decimal separator, but numeric scalebar
shows comma as thousands separator.

This is only appening after the OSGeo4W update.

Everything ok with canvas scale.

Could a recent update have caused this issue?

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OdtEA0UeDNSzjuv40KZJ05ekYyObyX=tBMNup3UKiJLLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

is there any possibility how to convince QGIS Server (and QGIS Desktop
itself) to render legend items as multiline text? I tried '\n' but it
didn't worked (see attached screenshot). My goal is to make rendered
image less wide and cannot shorten legend descriptions. Thanks for any
tips in advance, Martin

Hi Martin,

Did you try the "wrap text on" option in the legend item properties (
http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/composer_items/composer_legend.html#main-properties
)?

Regards,
Harrissou

Ola Pedro,
personally I'd prefer to reach a consent before proceeding.
I think this can be reached in a reasonable time frame.
Let's keep on with what I believe is a fruitful discussion.
All the best, and thanks for understanding.

Hi,

Thanks to this thread a new repository for UI/UX issues has been created
and several issues have already been reported (https://github.com/qgis/
qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues).
One of the objectives of that repository is to have people without
particular coding skills join and help on what they could. BUT as mentioned
also in the discussion, some work could not be moved forward without devs
inputs and guidings. I know that you are all busy but it'd be nice if, from
time to time, some devs could give a look to that repository and help for
questions or add their opinions.

Some questions are raised at:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/19
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/14
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/11
and many others... that could be of interest for you..

Thanks for your availability,
Harrissou

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Install instructions
Message-ID: <CAECJsSqOFxXBH_Ukd+j+SW3dXwCtpJUCpdSb7X4oVLtic01-Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Browsing the install instructions of QGIS at
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html
(whose source is at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL), it
is stated:

_/!\ Note to document writers: This documented is generated from
doc/INSTALL.t2t - if you need to edit this document, be sure to edit that
file rather than the generated INSTALL document found in the root of the
source directory._

The doc/INSTALL.t2t file being an aggregate of multiple .t2t files from the
doc folder, I concluded that these were the files to edit if I needed to
fix something in the install instructions.

So, can someone please explain me why this fix (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/6f87532ac7610f72c1f8bbef7deceb713f7f8e54)
from days ago is not yet available in
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc10
?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Paolo,
I do understand the concern.

However,  the largest transportation conference in the world is coming up
(January 8th-12th),  where over 12,000 people  will be in Washington DC
discussing transportation research and practice.

This conference is the best opportunity I have to show people what can be
done for transportation modelling with open source tools and,  hopefully,
 to find funding opportunities to support the project (things have been
slow as a single developer working on my spare time).

For that purpose would be paramount to have the plugin back online, and I
have worked really hard towards that objective.

I hope my request does not seem unreasonable.

Cheers,
Pedro

I am not sure if the process has changed, but historically we would only generate the INSTALL document during the release process...I would suggest to just run the t2t script to produce the INSTALL doc when you make changes and then include the updated INSTALL in your patch.

Tim

Hi Pedro,
I understand your problem. I think we can decide much sooner than Jan 8th.
Let's keep on the discussion here.

These are valuable information I wasn't aware of. I thought the scripts
would be activated while merging.

Hello matteo,

For the SAGA algorithms, the logical first place to update the
documentation would be in SAGA itself. It will be reviewed by the people
developing SAGA and can be synced to QGis
Our git repository is here:
https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/code/ci/master/tree/ or you can use my
github mirror as well [1] if you prefer that workflow.

I'm available for help to get you started, or you can contact us through
saga-gis-developer at lists.sourceforge.net

Kind Regards,
Johan

Hi all,
gdal_grid misses the option

-ot Float32

as a result I get:

ERROR 5: Pixel type must be Float32

It was working before. QGIS 2.18.0

All the best.

Meanwhile, you could create your own repository, if the main repository
fails, you will always have that backup.

If you want a bit fancy approach, you can do some thing like this:

https://github.com/inasafe/nightly.inasafe.org <https://github.com/inasafe/nightly.inasafe.org>

We use it to produce nightly builds - repo page looks like this:

http://nightly.inasafe.org <http://nightly.inasafe.org/>

Otherwise simply host the xml file and the zip file at some URL and point your users to it e.g.

http://nightly.inasafe.org/plugins.xml <http://nightly.inasafe.org/plugins.xml>

Regards

Tim

there is a long list of issues about gpkg support in both DB manager
(very basic support) and qgis browser (no support).

moreover there is some regression in general about d&d

can you be more specific?

I can run gdal_grid on 2.18.2 in both gdal tools and processing with no issues.

Hi Giovanni, 

So the drag and drop issue seems unrelated to Geopackage - right? 

About geopackage: if you can come up with a comprehensive list with
Geopackage problems I would be willing to find finances to fix these
issues. I would ask Even Rouault to have a look at these issues. 

I personally have a strong, very strong urge to have a good alternative
to these stupid, ugly shapefiles. We really need to make sure that
Geopackage works well in QGIS/GDAL and FOSSGIS in general. Only then we
can seriously suggest geopackage as a Shapefile replacement. 

BTW: I also think that regressions in a LT bug fix release are really
undesired. We received quite a lot of funding recently to QGIS.ORG and I
think we should spend some of these on fixing the LT regression issues.

For what it's worth, I strongly agree with that statement. Fundings are
very welcome, and let's spread the word to all power users to try to switch
their workflows with gpkg to test that extensively.

Hi Andreas,


> So the drag and drop issue seems unrelated to Geopackage - right?

as far as I remember there is a general regression about d&d + the
same functionality always had issues with gpkg (among the other
things).

I think that lately the very bad thing is that regression in between
point releases of LTR started to surface.
I strongly suggest that the paid bug fixing effort should be targeted
to 1) regressions 2) issues that we know cause crash or data
corruption in a replicable manner.

And 3) priority given to LTR over current?

I am not sure if there are really more regressions or if these just are
spotted more often because LTR are gaining more visibility and hence
testing (which is a good sign).

Maintenance of LTR right now depends on
1) organisations requesting bugfixes on existing contracts
2) backporting of bugs fixed in pre-release bugfixing of regular releases

I would very much appreciate if we were able to put more resources in
the long term maintenance of these releases.

Isn't that the case already? I always look at blocker priority issues
first which are assigned based on these criteria I think.
And while on the topic, IMHO crashes are in many cases even worse than
regressions.

There have been fixes recently about gpkg db locks and afaik those

Gio,

It is 2.18. Geopackage support in the LTR is not that great.

Cheers

I may be wrong, but the during the latest bug fixing efforts the
regression/high priority bug list was not used as priority list.

Which is no indication that the same did not happen in 2.8 as well but
was unnoticed.
But it also means that we still have room for improvement, lucky us :)

It certainly was one factor for me but in the end it's a mixed bag of

- priority

- quality of issue report
    If there's no steps for how to reproduce it (in a reasonable time
    and with data in reach) I'll stop right there

- expected chance of success
    Better to spend the time fixing 3 non-critical ones than not fixing
    a critical one

- expected time to fix
    Better to spend a day fixing 6 non-critical ones in a day than 1
    critical ones in two days

- knowledge of the codebase
    if I know that some other dev might be better suited for something,
    I'll probably leave it to him

- knowledge of certain problems
    if I am experiencing a problem during bugfixing, it's in front of
    nose and I will fix it. The next time I might need 2 hours to
    reproduce the bug. Also knowing that something is a problem for me
    or someone I know makes it rise up my priority list.

Hi Giovanni,
thanks for checking. The command built by GDALTools is:

gdal_grid -l test5 -zfield temp -a
invdist:power=2:smothing=0:radius1=0:radius2=0:angle=0:max_points=0:min_points=0:nodata=0
test5.shp

and throws the error repoerted. From Processing the option is added:

gdal_grid -l test5 -zfield temp -a
invdist:power=2:smothing=0:radius1=0:radius2=0:angle=0:max_points=0:min_points=0:nodata=0
-ot Float32 test5.shp

and it works.

All the best.

More details would be appreciated: drag&drop from which part of the UI to which part of 
the UI ? (I'm not sure I'm aware of all drag&drop capabilities that exist) I've tried to drop a 
geopackage from the browser, DBManager and the file explorer of my desktop to QGIS 
canvas (with master and 2.18.2) and that works fine for me.

Merci Even for your response. I'm D&D'ing from browser panel to DB Manager.

OK, didn't know that possibility indeed. Doesn't work for me either (but I don't get any error 
message). That doesn't work with spatialite either.

Hi, 

I wasn't aware either that one can drag and drop from browser to DB
manager. It is certainly not obvious. 

In the case of Geopackage, which is a container for many tables - how
should drag and drop behave? Should it open a dialogue that lets the
user choose which tables he wants to copy? 

I think this needs to be better specified.

Hi all,
that's the original design. It opens a dialog asking details (table
name, EPSG, etc.).
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

FYI:

I'm also on Debian Testing here, and just recompiled last sources.

I cannot reproduce your crash.

Can you try with a clean config (use --configpath /tmp/foo),
or a clean compile?

Regards,

Richard

Just tested on 2.18.2 on both Windows and Linux and cannot replicate
the problem.
In fact the command without the "-ot" parameter works just fine also
from the command line.

 between multiple QGIS instances
Message-ID: <fef93645-d5aa-60e0-1428-3149796e5e2f@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Do you have an idea  on a way to share a QgsPostgresSharedData between 
multiple QGIS instances ?

The use case is for QGIS Server to manage a PostGIS layer with a text 
primary key with WFS-T.
QgsPostgresSharedData is used to map int4 featureId with non integer 
primary key. It is usefull for QGIS Desktop. But server side, if 
multiple QGIS Server instances is used with 1 project, for performance, 
each QGIS Server has it's own QgsPostgresSharedData.
I'd like to share it between multiple instances tohav the same feature 
ids for same primary key.

Regards,
René-Luc D'Hont

There are different approaches to this:

 * Use a shared memory segment http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsharedmemory.html
   in this case, if the server is restarted, anything will be gone
   This might introduce data corruption if someone tries to do an update
   with a fid obtained before the restart which collides with a newly
   created fid.

 * Use some persistent storage like a sqlite database to cache the keys

 * Use a reproducible algorithm to generate the fid<->pk mapping
   (something similar to qHash)

Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Looking for advices to avoid breaking translated
	strings
Message-ID: <CAECJsSq9d-uCsjYMEDAKH2giQRi8=_rLH=Q0rMi0izmb-CVUbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The thread "Typos and inconsistencies in source text"  (hence its issue
report at  https://github.com/qgis/qgis3_UIX_discussion/issues/19) has
revealed an important number of issues related to spelling of translatable
strings.
While I agree that fixing those issues will give more consistency in QGIS
(at least for developers and English-speaking users) I am still concerned
about the overwork for the translation team and am looking for the best way
to do it in order to have less impact on localized QGIS.

Let's take a reported typo: "cellsize" instead of "cell size". If I check
Transifex, we currently have 19 strings that contain this word. So if the
replacements are done in QGIS source files, when these ones are pushed to
transifex, these strings will be replaced and because of this tiny
difference, the translations already done for ALL languages will be
deconnected, hence lost.
But actually, those fixes don't change the meaning of the string. And
translations are done according to the meaning. So, despite the typos in
the english texts, translated ones were (and still are) valid. But they'll
be lost and the dialog in QGIS will be displayed in English until some
translator reapplies the same translation.

But there's not only "cellsize" typo; we have rationalize, analyze,
flavour, behaviour, favourite, neighbour, cancelled, check-box, and many
other spelling issues...
I do not think that all languages have enough active translators to redo
their work. So is there a way to keep translations?

I've been thinking about a process and wonder if it'll work (and will
require someone with write access):
- Pull translations from Transifex
- have a PR in which besides fixing strings in the source code, their
duplicate in /i18n folder are also fixed. In this case the .ts file
contains the cleaned text linked to the existing translation
- then merge the commit
- and push it again to transifex

Would that work? Opinions?

Regards,
Harrissou

At least the translated text should be proposed to the translator if the
source string is still similar. So it does not need to be completely
rewritten.

I am not sure if in this case the whole transifex translation will be
overwritten and any new translations added between opening the pull
request and pushing to transifex will be lost.

It would probably be safer if it would be merged first and then someone
takes care of doing

 tx pull
 ... adjust translations ...
 tx push (-t I think?)

in a short timeframe to reduce the risk of collisions

Sorry I wasn't precise enough. I didn't mean all the translations in QGIS
will be lost. Unchanged strings will for sure keep their translation. I was
referring to these 19 strings which have changed.

For what I've seen, Transifex will keep them along and propose them because
they are translation for a very close text but no matching will be done as
they don't match. Someone needs to do the click.

Hi Jürgen

I'm testing DWG/DXF Import tool, and it works great on Windows!

But it does not work here on Linux. On Linux, when I try to import the DWG,
it says:
"Could not open layer list" and then
"Drawing import failed ()".

Also, when I try to open (on Linux) a geopackage created with DWG/DXF
Import on Windows, it says:
"Invalid Data Source: /home/pedro/.../xxx.gpkg is not a valid or recognized
data source".

It's not ready for Linux yet?

Another great work! Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi Pedro,

What version of GDAL are you using? Geopackage support needs >= 2.0, for 
some geopackage features even higher. Many Linux distros ship with older 
GDAL releases.

Do you have the libdxfrw libray installed?

On Linux your best bet to test the very latest releases of the libs and 
QGIS would be to self-compile all the necessary libraries 
(GDAL/libdxfrw) and QGIS. I did it that way and it works fine.

Hi Matthias,

In Lyon we also talked about how to share caches between different server
processes, do you think that the shared memory segment would be appropriate
in that case?

For a cache it does not matter if it's not persistent.

The idea would be to have the server honour the 12 factors patterns.

What are the caches used for?
I wouldn't exclude a shared-memory segment per-se but I also cannot say
it's THE solution. I'm not sure if there's a general answer to it.

Whatever it is, it needs to be properly protected against concurrent
access and possible deadlocks.

I'm not familiar with it, but as far as I can tell, all requirements to
a cache are listed on the process page (https://12factor.net/processes)
which looks quite sensible to me.

Hi,
Tested here on 2.18.2 and master and it works (ubuntu, compiled from source)
Anyway I found some UX issues:

- Input (dwg) and output (gpkg) should be switched in UI. It is strange -
to me at least - to first find output.
- DWG input is called "Drawing". Could we call it "DWG drawing" ?
- Import step is triggered from inside the ficle dialog chooser, which is
quite uncommon. It lets user think there is some freeze when in fact real
work is being done
- If we continue to play with the import window after having choosen the
dwg file - already converted to gpkg then - it will import an empty group
to the canvas.

My proposal is to do the work only with "reload" and "import" buttons, not
when double clicking on the file when inside the file chooser dialog.

Thanks for that awesome work (and funding)

That's right.  The import should only be available when geopackage support is
there.  It's enabled where also the creation of of new geopackage layers is
enabled.

But that was a bit sloppy as the geopackage creation is enabled - ie. with GDAL
1.11, and doesn't use features that GDAL 2 introduced, while I depend on some
(geometry less tables, spatial index).

So DXF/DWG shouldn't be enabled with GDAL <2.


> Do you have the libdxfrw libray installed?

No need - libdxfrw is included in QGIS.

mainly per-project capabilities.

With QGIS 3 refactoring the QgsProject class will probably hold all the
information we need instead of parsing the project XML like we are doing
now, I think that we'll need to cache the QgsProject instance itself if we
want scalability by spawning multiple server processes without the need to
re-parse the project file, this in case we need to serve multiple projects
of course.

I was more oriented at a memcached/redis backend that would scale well if
the server instances are running on different containers (in that case the
shared memory will no work).

I guess that in case of an external caching backend this would not be a
problem.

Is there some profiling information available about what's the slow part
(parsing, loading of layers, loading of print composers...)?

Saving a whole project including layers etc. in a shared memory sounds
like a challenge.
It's possibly easier to identify which parts are slow and cache them on
some backend.
If this mechanism is abstract enough to work with a file based format
like sqlite or memcached/redis, that would be awesome because QGIS
desktop could also benefit and depolyment on a server will probably be
easier if it does not depend on additional services.

I think Patrick was working on profiling.
BTW, the thing are probably going to change significantly after the
refactoring that will use the new QgsProject.

Message-ID: <HE1PR1001MB090640A970CCA3B9FB25CA44A7920@HE1PR1001MB0906.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi all,
running the following model:

shapefile (points) -> selection by attribute -> triangulation (SAGA) -> mosaic rasters (SAGA)

I get the error “ 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'crs'  ” when it reaches the last step.

On the web there are just few posts about this issue with other tools (an old bug<https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11447> and fresh comments in some forum<http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/using_plugins.html>) but none with a solution.
Btw, it may be related to SAGA but seems that all the reported ones happened when used within QGIS 2.18.x .

Any idea?

I’m using QGIS 2.18.2 with SAGA 2.1.2 on W10 64bit.

Thank you in advance.

All the best!

Nic

Hi Andreas and Jürgen,

Thank you very much for your hints!

I was with GDAL 2.1.0, but I was using QGIS from http://qgis.org/debian,
and it was compiled against GDAL 1.11.3.

I've just compiled from source and it is working like a charm!

Thank you very much!

Great work Jürgen!

Hi,
Tested here on 2.18.2 and master and it works (ubuntu, compiled from source)
Anyway I found some UX issues:

- Input (dwg) and output (gpkg) should be switched in UI. It is strange -
to me at least - to first find output.


+1
This stood out to me when I was briefly testing this feature.

I think the dialog should also offer the option to create a new gpkg (or
even better would be to change the output selector from an open file
chooser to a save file chooser and mimic the current behaviour of the save
vector dialog, where choosing to save using an existing filename gives
options for overwriting or appending to the existing file).

Nyall






- DWG input is called "Drawing". Could we call it "DWG drawing" ?
- Import step is triggered from inside the ficle dialog chooser, which is
quite uncommon. It lets user think there is some freeze when in fact real
work is being done
- If we continue to play with the import window after having choosen the
dwg file - already converted to gpkg then - it will import an empty group
to the canvas.

My proposal is to do the work only with "reload" and "import" buttons, not
when double clicking on the file when inside the file chooser dialog.

Thanks for that awesome work (and funding)

Do you have examples of serious regressions in the LTS? My experience
(based entirely on gut feeling and near daily reading of the bug tracker)
is that there hasn't been any serious regressions so far in 2.14. We've had
packaging issues due to the webkit mess, but this isn't really our fault
and only affected debian users as far as I'm aware. Otherwise, we've had
some non serious bugs introduced but only as a result of related fixes to
somewhat fragile areas of the code.

But that's just my experience, and I'm keen to hear if yours differs!

If you specify a non existent geopackage it will be created.  If you specify a
specify an existent file you can reload the drawing or choose other layers.

DWG is a abbrevation for drawing and it could also be a drawing in Drawing
eXchange Format (DXF).

Actually that was the version before - essentially the same, just one click
less.  But that was before there were options - now the previous version
would be preferable.

Hi,



When saving a raster (Save As) in origin resolution eg. 0.4*0.4  - it gives a new resolution in the saved file eg. 0.39989,-0.400057



I don´t have any possibilities to set the extent to make an exact match with the original layer.

Is there an easy work around for this issue ?

Message-ID: <e38f7e73-712f-3704-4935-aeeb4cbb6ffc@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I have been reported a problem in QGIS 2.14.10: the same projects that
were working as WMS with 2.14.9 do not return valid data when upgrading
to 2.14.10. Apparently .10 switches off OTF reprojection, but could not
make more tests because we had to revert immediately to .9 (it is a
production server).
Anyone had the same issue?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
I recall a discussion on gitter about adding a serial expression but not
sure it's implemented.
A workaround could be using maximum("field") + 1

Interestingly, I hit another bug:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16008
The origin of an empty field is set to a wrong value.
All the best.

The solution from the Gitter discussion

aggregate( 'layername','max',"id")+1

We need of course a more user friendly way to allow users have
incremental/serial ids in their shapefiles...


Cheers!

Hi,

just tested on 2.18.2 with a raster in a projected CRS and output
resolutions matches the input one.

Can you share a sample of your data?

what does means "do not return valid data"?


I have recently started to see a lot of issues with WMS layers from
services being updated (based on QGIS server). The workaround passed
to clear the cache in general options, even if this is configured to
0.

not sure we are speaking about the same problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future of the GDALTools plugin
Message-ID: <CALuHMPDFcPEfsTbOGSSWYAouYwJfiKEvix=ahOpQD8GMyULdiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

some time ago I submitted a QEP about removing fTools and GDALTools
plugins and replacing them with Processing [0, 1]. fTools plugin was removed,
but GDALTools still here. IMHO it would be good to drop GDALTools in QGIS 3.0.

Right now Processing offers same functionality as GDALTools plugin and even
tools which are not available in GDALTools. Also it receives much more attention
and bugfixes. For example, if a user creates with the field calculator
a new column
in a vector to be used for some operation within GDALTools, then this column
is not recognized (but it is in the equivalent tool in Processing) and
this is not
only one problem.

Are there any objections to remove GDALTools?

Alex, there is one aspect where gdaltools plugin still surpasses
processing, namely the possibility of creating virtual rasters from
multiple files without having to load those in QGIS to begin with.

If that could be dealt with, I wouldn't look back to the plugin in a
hundred years :)

Agreed it should be removed in QGIS 3.
Agreed about the VRT issue reported by Mathieu.
Perhaps it would be good to announce this more widely (qgis-users,
social networks), to collect eventual similar cases.
Is Processing non-blocking in QGIS 3 now?
All the best, and thanks.

Could you describe more exactly, what you did, when you clean up 'the
entire environment', please.

With new master versions on my FreeBSD boxes, I also have some trouble
at startup from time to time. For me, it helps to remove the user
configuration in '~/.qgis-dev' and sometimes also in '~/.config/QGIS'.
Is this, what you meant be 'entire environment'?

Thanks in advance.

Not yet, but we plan to work on this and update Processing to use
task manager recently added by Nyall

Hi all,

some time ago I submitted a QEP about removing fTools and GDALTools
plugins and replacing them with Processing [0, 1]. fTools plugin was
removed,
but GDALTools still here. IMHO it would be good to drop GDALTools in QGIS
3.0.


Right now Processing offers same functionality as GDALTools plugin and even
tools which are not available in GDALTools. Also it receives much more
attention
and bugfixes. For example, if a user creates with the field calculator
a new column
in a vector to be used for some operation within GDALTools, then this column
is not recognized (but it is in the equivalent tool in Processing) and
this is not
only one problem.

Are there any objections to remove GDALTools?


Big +1 from me in general. But if I recall correctly a blocker from this in
the past was that the gdaltools versions show the command line equivalent
syntax while the processing versions do not.

Is this still considered a blocker and if so, is there plans to address
this before dropping the plugin.

the command line has been added (thanks Victor). What is missing is the
possibility of directly editing the command and launch it from the
interface. Although very convenient for power users, I do not consider
this a blocker.
More serious is the modal window. May I suggest to drop it only after
having switched processing to the task manager?
All the best.

Ticket opened long ago:

It is certainly a secondary thing, but I'm sure it would help users,
especially newbies, to immediately understand the results.
All the best.

I tried again, with a bit more time, and:
* I can compute shortest paths with the two algs
* I cannot get meaningful convex hullsfor the two service area algs.
I'm probably not understanting how the area algs work. Alex, could you
please give a quick explanation, or point to an existing one, and/or
share a sample project and params?
Thanks a lot.

Hi, thanks so much for the help. Right now the AtlasListener is throwing up a

NameError: name 'QObject' is not defined

I looked up the API and when instantiating the AtlasListener, I can
pass a QObject into the constructor. What QObject should I put in
there?

Thanks

Hello there,

So I've managed to solve the problem by removing the QObject reference
in the constructor. I'm working on trying to get a message to play
when a composer is added. (My goal is to get it to add a listener for
when the atlas is turned on, and then maybe to draw a line or
something when the feature is changed.)

However, the message does not play when a composer is added. I'm not
sure what I'm doing wrong here. Thanks so much for all the help.

Hi,
Working with a WCS layer with values in band I would like to use Zonal Statistic. At the moment it can only be used with rasterfiles.

Any workaround for using WCS ?

People,

         I just uploaded a version of AequilibraE that does not include
binaries and includes a GUI to download the binaries from the tool's
website.

I hope this fits the bill.

Cheers,
Pedro

Here is short explanation from ArcGIS documentation

Also note that convex hull used only as example, you can get more
accurate result
using boundary points and apply more sophisticated algorithm to them.

Makes sense to me. Published. May I ask you to add a not about this in
the About field of metadata.txt?
Please anyone comment out. It would be good to agree on general guidelines.
Thanks for understanding our concerns.

thanks for this. got the issue: the travel cost parameter gets silently
zeroed if I edit the default 0 value. If I first delete the 0,000000
default value, then enter my param, it works fine. This is a general
issue with Processing, and I believe it's a true bug of Processing (user
inputs should never be discarded without consent).
BTW, what is the meaning of the `lower` polygon?
All the best, and thanks again.

Hi all,
I think the panel needs some love, e.g. adding a point requires an
existing layer, with appropriate fields. Now that we have scratch
layers, it seems reasonbable to create and add one on the fly.
All the best.

Seems this is a general Processing bug and if I'm not wrong it worked fine
before parameters refactoring.

> BTW, what is the meaning of the `lower` polygon?

Actually service area defined with two boundaries:
 * upper, which include closest to the starting point nodes/vertices
that not accessible
* lower, which include the most distant from starting point nodes/vertices
that still accessible

Ah - didn't realise that. I don't consider editing the command a blocker either.

I'd say given that the processing team have already stated their
commitment to port processing to task manager for 3.0 that we can
safely drop gdaltools for now with little impact.

In master you can add UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints to the field
from within QGIS. This will cause QGIS to automatically populate it
with a serial type value whenever a new feature is created.

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for clarifying. 

This needs to be properly documented and taught in QGIS courses.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Question about QEP process
Message-ID: <CAEEbjBij-X-3pKCXTquoneTNjov7UcAC=k_vEFT=_hFAe99dvw@mail.gmail.com>

I am preparing a worked over version of the Georeferencer and have come to
the stage where most of the adapted/new functionality is nearing completion
and the extensive testing starts.

I have started working on a QEP, based on the template 'QEP-0-Template.md'.

Since a full explanation of the changes and additions are extensive, it may
take a while to complete the draft.

Since there is no Label 'Draft in preparation', my question is whether to
continue working on it here until the Draft is complete:

https://github.com/mj10777/QGIS/wiki/QGIS-Enhancement:-Georeferencer

or submit it now, completing it within the next 7-10 days.

There is also the question: keep it short or (what I would prefer)
extensive?

Hey Mark,

A QEP should be opened in order for review to take place on any design
changes that might need descussion.

Also please note that 2.x is not receiving any new features as we are now
working on 3.0. 2.x will only be bug fixes.

Regards,
Nathan

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_E3T1XXMYukqeX3pDYwE_7NUCbeZynLYT9hiuo26SqEJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

As last year, I'm very curious about what were the 2016 user's favorite
QGIS new features. For that, I prepared a "little" survey with all features
from 2.14, 2.16 and 2.18 visual changelogs:

https://senhorneto.typeform.com/to/iEeJye

Please answer the survey and share it as much as possible trough social
media. The survey will be *opened until next Thursday* (29/12/2016), and I
plan to share the results before the end of the year.

Of course, there are no winners or losers features, we all win anyway!

Thanks!

agree, while a cool feature for power users is not so important for general use.

Actually there is a much more important regression in gdal tools
(Processing equivalent tools not affected) that would make sense  to
be eventually addressed if gdal tools is not being removed from
lts/2.18: in recent qgis versions new numeric/integer fields created
with the QGIS field calculator are *not* recognized in tools like gdal
rasterize (a very, very common operation).

unfortunately since the availability of the WCS client in QGIS, WCS
layers cannot be used directly as input for any raster analysis.

is there already a (regression) ticket about this issue? I cannot see

The 'design changes' will be more on how the Georeferencer will work, not
QGIS 3.0 itsself.

Although this is being developed with 2.x (where the major changes are
Georeferencer
internal)
- the intention is to offer it mainly as a QGIS 3.0 version (that will also
run with 2.*)
- correcting this that could work better
- extending it ways that as someone who has used it for 100s of projects in
the last 4-5 years useful

The idea of the QEP would therefore be to
- introduce the concept with the reasons why
- and come to consensus

Mark

Hi

because the binaries are no more present in the plugin, I can't see
why Pedro should add/modify metadata. +1 to publish (well it has been
already published :)

I wonder if it is not worth floating the idea of layer annotations - something like GDAL does with it's aux.xml files that we can store stuff like this in. It is a shame to open a layer in one project where you have serial counters implemented, and then have to redo it in another project (and remember to do it). I know it would only work for file based (or maybe QGIS Layer Files too?) datasets but I recon that would cover most use cases since the 'proper' databases already have mechanisms to deal with this. Along with that we could have the layer creation dialog include a serial field type which would set up the constraints and annotate them in the layer annotation file.

Just a thought anyway...

Regards

Tim

this could be very handy. What I wonder is, if we save the current
counter, we will also need to save the constraints. And if we do that, I
wonder if this idea generalizes well to other layer properties like
field widget definitions and maybe even style. We will end up with
something similar to the shapefile concept, where there are a bunch of
additional files next to the data payload file.
This in turn looks basically like a .qml file which is loaded
automatically when found (based on filename). There could be some
options in the layer properties to explicitly control, what's going to
be saved in there and what not.
Does that make sense?

Regards
Matthias

Hi,

thanks for the collaboration Pedro and all for the good discussions.

Can we move towards making a decision for how to handle this in the future?

For my part, I would be in favor of a solution based on the following
points (written by Luigi), combined with the liberty to take sensible
decisions for the plugin repository moderator.

Yes! :-) Thats pretty much what I intended with my contrived term 'layer annotation'. Using the .qml could also work - I was thinking when writing the above to try to separate the style from other layer properties in the layer but since the .qml is already overloaded with other things maybe having a better separation of concerns is a task for QGIS version 4 :-) I guess based on your notes above having things like counters stored in the annotation file might be a reason to indeed use a separate file  since .qml files might be version controlled or read only for a user etc.

Tim

This should be fixed with recent 94dd1f4 commit.

This is apparently a known issue with using SVG source files for macOS
'native menubar' menu action icons, and has supposedly already fixed
upstream for Qt 5.6.3, 5.7.2 and 5.8.0 RC. Any icons that do show up are
PNG-based, and should be migrated to SVG as well.

See: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16016

While we could propose a patch for Homebrew's qt5 formula, it is not a
critical bug, unless a newer version of Qt is not going to be released
prior to the next QGIS feature freeze or testing cycle.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Managing Javascript dependencies in Python plugin
Message-ID: <1482919627212-5301417.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

qgis2web writes or a load of Javascript, a lot of it third-party libraries -
see the very end of the README
(https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/README.md#credits).

I was hoping to find some way of managing these libraries - at the least
keeping track of new versions as they are released. 

However, as far as my limited understanding goes, the problem is that my
code is Python, but I want to manage JS. As far as I can tell, this rules
out nicely integrated services like Greenkeeper. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Thanks

Tom

Message-ID: <CAGvsbY5WmzMc0kzJdeRxWkHXBZSUVFw23XQbJN=K0fvqgdyV1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I noticed that the recent version (2.18.2) of QGIS takes a long time (more
than 2 minutes) in creating the composition pdf.
However, the same map with version 2.16 is fine (2-4 seconds).

I used Windows 7 (64bits).

Is this a known problem?

Buenas Carlos,

not from what i remember from the bug queue (but these days is much
more difficult than in the past).

If can exclude any side effect by any 3rd party plugin or legacy
configuration please file a regression ticket, preferably attaching a
project with sample data to allow others replicate the issue.

cheers!

In my head (and others too, I know for sure) the priority for the bug
fixing effort supported by the project is very clear: regressions
first, period. Regressions are the evil that undermine the QGIS
credibility and as such they should be squashed as soon as possible.
It is not my or your or anyone else role to judge if a regression is
important or not important. What I personally think that is not an
important regression can be a complete workflow break for "another".
And considered how many people download and use QGIS nowadays this
"other" could be very well a lot of people. In this sense I really
would like the newly elected psc to take a clear decision on this
matter, one way or the other.

Fortunately the regression list is not that long, and I can say that
any ticket tagged a regression by me (or verified) has a proper
description and/or dataset to replicate. In fact when an original
description is not good enough I always edit edit it and put in front
a rephrased "new description" paragraph. This is also true for most of
the tickets tagged as "high", especially the ones know to cause crash
or data corruption.

probably from what I wrote before you understand that I respectfully
but strongly disagree with such workflow (speaking of the bug hunting
effort supported by the project).

cheers!

Hello,
Just noticed that in the master python console some of the autocomplete suggestions are bad.For instance, although QgsDataSourceURI has been renamed to QgsDataSourceUri and the console suggests the first version which doesn't work.

Shouldn't the suggestions be automatic?
Thanks,Tudor

In an ideal world, the person who introduced the regression should be the one that fixes it but we don't have the leverage to enforce that.
Also in an ideal world, regressions will take first place in the bug hunting priority list. I think it is also fair to appreciate that our resources are limited and our control over who steps forward to do bug hunting is limited. So if we get three devs in a given release bug fix sprint that have time available to fix bugs, and none of them have familiarity with the code related to the regression, it can be a difficult sell to insist that they only focus on the regressions - they might simply make themselves unavailable for the bug fixing sprint. So until we reach the point one day where we have developers on QGIS.org's permanent payroll who we can directly mandate what work they do, we are always going to have to approach any conversation about mandatory behavior with the knowledge that our influence is limited when it comes down to exactly what we can and can't insist developers do. Our current options in terms of incentives are:

* financial: offer cash for fixes and hope that entices someone to work on the regression
* charm: appeal to a developer who is likely skilled enough to deal with it in a friendly way and see if we can get them involved in the fix
* coercion: revoke commit rights for devs who introduce regressions and don't fix them or other similar approaches
* open communication: include in the changelog and release announcements a list of known issues and regressions

We already employ the first two in the list and I would like to use the last approach too and avoid the third as much as possible. Giovanni I do understand and agree with all the points you laid out and I'd be more than happy if we emphasize more when we contract devs on QGIS funding to fix issues that they should focus on regressions first. But I don't know if we will ever get to the black and white situation where we can mandate that all regressions should be fixed before any other work can be carried out. I'll table it in the next PSC meeting and see if others can suggest a better way to approach this...

Regards

Tim

Just to add to Tim's excellent response:

I'd prefer to prioritise a High priority bug which affects 90% of
users over a regression which affects 0.05% of users. Eg something
like http://hub.qgis.org/issues/16001 is a regression (I suspect it's
upstream though, that's why I closed it), but the conditions to
experience it are so obscure that I wouldn't want to see this targeted
over any high priority bugs!

Hi Tudor,

AFAIK, autocompletion uses pre-generated API-files. Usually they updated
before release and not updated during dev cycle as some signatures may
change.

Hi Alexander and thanks for the info.
>From what I noticed, the PyQgis.api is normally built every time but there's a corresponding pap file which the autocomplete is based on that doesn't get usually created.
In order to create that file there's a "make qsci-pap-src" option which seems to be broken on master.  
Think Larry is more familiar with this part.
All the best,Tudor

Yeah, looks like the the .api and .pap setup is woefully outdated. The .api
files in the source tree need updated, and the .pap script probably needs
revamped.

Since the finished .pap file is large enough (~ 1.3 MB) that is should not
be auto-generated and pushed to the master branch upon *every* Travis CI
run, could be that we can leverage Travis in the following way:

* Use the Travis 'cron job' feature [0] to generate the .api (and/or .pap)
file, probably once a week, or maybe nightly. If the build cache on Travis
is available, then the API files could be referenced without needing to
rebuild the Python modules.

* Deploy the .api or .pap files from Travis to an S3 bucket (or other QGIS
server infrastructure). Then, a dev build target can be used to pull the
latest, or even an updater function could be added to the console. If that
is an API deployed file, then the .pap generation script could be called
when making the target or running an updater.

While such a dev target could also just generate the API file from scratch
(as currently exists, albeit apparently broken), leveraging Travis
deployment of a generated auto-completion artifact to a centralized
download location ensures that what is tested during development is what
ends up as part of packaged releases as well. Also, it would cache .api
files relative to versioned builds, and the largish .pap doesn't need to
pollute the source tree with excessive commits.

Another solution might be to have the API file(s) be distributed via a
project-maintained PyQGIS plugin. Then it would be updatable via normal
Plugin Manager channels.

Side note: the QScintilla2 completion is purely static, with no
introspection/completion on assigned variables, etc. (unless there are new
QScintilla2 features here). If you are looking for a more robust console,
consider the IPyConsole plugin [1].

well, as you cite a case that is at one end of the spectrum we may
want to be fair and cite cases at the other end, like broken widely
used core functionalities left as such (for years in some case).

Tim, you say "In an ideal world, the person who introduced the
regression should be the one that fixes it but we don't have the
leverage to enforce that.".
Why the project won't have the leverage to enforce such policy? seems
a fair one.

cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyDev debug breakpoints
Message-ID: <1483122096068-5301651.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi!

I have two installations of QGIS - one 2.6.1 for my legacy project and the
newer 2.16.1. I'm trying to use the remote debugger on the 2.6.1.

On both installations I did the same thing:
* Install Eclipse with PyDev (Aptana Studio)
* Install Remote Debug plugin
* Configure remote debug plugin with the pydevd path from Aptana
installation
* Create a linked folder in Aptana to the plugin source file
* Put a breakpoint in the .py source
* Start PyDev Debug Server (shows Debug Server root and Debug Server node)
* Start remote debug in QGIS (shows "unknown" node under Debug Server root)
* Run the plugin

But, in my 2.6.1 installations breakpoints do not work (in 2.16.1 it works
fine). What could I be missing? I can still suspend the code "manually"  by
using settrace or suspending the thread in PyDev (it breaks on the first
next call), however I can't get the breakpoints to work :( Any idea? I don't
think I did anything different on the 2.16.1 installation that does work.

d.

I'm having trouble installing using this tap. If I run brew install
-db qgis3-dev I get the error:

qgis3-dev: Compilation can fail if these formulae are installed and linked:


Unlink with `brew unlink qt` or remove with `brew uninstall qt`

Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.


If I then "brew unlink qt" and attempt to reinstall I get the error:

Error: You must `brew link qt5` before qgis/qgisdev/qgis3-dev can be installed

Any ideas what's going on here?

Hi

It's often hard to say who broke what with which change. By the time you know (if do knw at all...), the one who introduced the problem may not be available.
It's a lot easier to enforce this pre-merge but that normally only happens if either the broken functionality is unit tested or someone volunteers to test the pull request in-depth.

Cheers Matthias

Yep: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/8306

Qt5 is now the default, since ~ yesterday, and `qt` and `pyqt` are now
aliases to Qt5 formulae. I've pushed some fixes, please `brew update` try
again.

Please try following the dev tutorial, once you have it building. Any
feedback appreciated (using the github issue tracker there).
