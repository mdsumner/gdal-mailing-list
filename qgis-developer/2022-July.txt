Subject: [QGIS-Developer] qt5 releases, packaging impact?
Message-ID: <rmi35fk4n1d.fsf@s1.lexort.com>


I'm writing as a packager of qgis (pkgsrc).

A while ago there was discussion about QT making bug fix releases of
5.15 proprietary, more or less.   I see that
  "Qt 5.15.10 LTS Commercial"
was just released on June 7.

And,
  qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.15.5.tar.xz
available at
  https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.15/5.15.5/single/
appears to have been released on June 17.

I haven't seen anything about this in a long time, so I wonder:

  Obviously it seems like all packaging systems should be updating the
  5.15.x releases as they come out.  Correct?

  The future is qt6, but I wonder if qgis with qt6 is fully reliable,
  and if qt6 is considered baked enough.    Should I be trying hard to
  get qt6 fully packaged and transition qgis to it?  For 3.22, or just
  for 3.26, or ?

  Anything else I should know?

Thanks,
Greg

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Polygon rendering issue on 3.26
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWBhMXH=u=OyRNfxPVx0Z0cvx8ndeX9j+C0zEeKBS-9MFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I was just curious about the behaviour indicated in this issue:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/49157

I was assuming that polygon rendering would be sufficiently covered by the
testsuite or could the issue be unique to windows? Or could this be due to
something else, as it's not too consistent but I've had it too at work and
had to revert to a prior version to export maps.

I'm honestly surprised there were so few reports about an issue that should
be quite apparent.

Thanks,

Alex

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] flash geometries for (larger) polygons?
Message-ID: <e0221b8b-64ca-d6b0-2f83-bb6933fedb53@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

We have a geocoder plugin, which is able to return polygons.

Wanting to be able to see what (province/neighourhoud/zip code etc) it is I thought to use:

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/QgsMapCanvas.html#qgis.gui.QgsMapCanvas.flashGeometries

but that only flashes a full non transparant geometry (polygon in our case).

Looking into the code:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/gui/qgsmapcanvas.cpp#L1876

it looks like it really is written towards a begin/end color flash, so I think adding a 'fill' would not fit.

Any idea's?

Maybe adding transparency is easiest then?

Regards & thanks for any input,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

what are you trying to achieve?

If you would like to flash only the border of the polygon you could try 
to use

geometry.convertToType(1) 
(https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/core/QgsGeometry.html#qgis.core.QgsGeometry.convertToType)

to flash only a LineGeometry instead of a polygon.

Cheers,
Bjoern

Ah, that's actually a very good idea too :-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] API endpoints to QGIS
Message-ID: <CADwgHob87a2g=i7iQfRvLeQpbSipN07177K6St-KuiBxq_AXVQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I have asked this question on Stack Exchange. I havent  got so many answers.

Calling API end points in QGIS - Geographic Information Systems Stack
Exchange
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/434820/calling-api-end-points-in-qgis>

So since this API endpoints calling  might not be a classical
user/business  case in QGIS ,I thought to ask here, If there is a way to
get this into QGIS ?


And if there are no current possibilities for that, might there be
something like this coming in the future releases of QGIS?

regards

Marin Mirosevic

Hi,

the answer you've got is correct: it is not currently implemented,
only HTTP Basic is available.

This leaves you with a few options:

1. write a Python plugin that implements in python a vector data provider.
2. implement in QGIS core (in C++) the support for other
authentication methods for the GDAL vector data provider (OGR).

Here is an example of a proof of concept python vector data provider:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/tests/src/python/provider_python.py

Best regards.

Hi,

The plugin XYZHubConnector recently got updated and quickly approved. However many users reported that it crashes in QGIS 3.16 due to incompatible python feature. I have then fixed the errors and publish it to version 1.9.4. Could you please approve it ?

Hi all,
I noticed this plugin has a Portuguese description:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/roof_draw/
whereas we recommend to have an EN one, eventually with a translation.
So I went to open a ticket, and I discovered that they use Trello for
this. As I'm not used to this, do we consider it appropriate as a repo
and bugtracker?
Thanks.

Hi,
One blocker to me is that you need a Trello account to be able to see
issues. There is no public version and by consequence no search engine can
see those issues.
I would kindly ask for a real ticket manager.

The git repository is also not being visitable as a web interface. You can
clone the code via git https, but it is not possible to do merge requests
and collaboration.
This is not totally fair game. I would suggest they move to a open repo
with code and issues, or make their own plugin repository if they want to
stick with their current approach.

Bye!

Hi Greg,

As of right now, Qt6 support in QGIS is experimental and needs more work
and testing. Parts have been successfully compiled using Qt6 in the
past, but I am not aware of anyone shipping QGIS bundled with Qt6.
If you want to package QGIS for stable use, I would recommend sticking to
the latest Qt 5.15 packages (ideally with the KDE patchset included
https://community.kde.org/Qt5PatchCollection)

Best regards
Matthias

I would contact them before deapproving, all this is a pedagogy effort for
person not aware of the open collaboration pillars.
I'm sure they will move, maybe not fast. If you can have them participate
in this mail thread, I'll be happy to help .

I've proposed a fix at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/49266, but it
requires testing on server and confirmation that it addresses the
regression.

Thanks!

Hi all,
are we going to implement this? Apparently nobody objects.
I'd add to the list the Topology sub plugin by strk. Probably not widely
used, but an unique feature.
I confirm that in the meantime the table historicization has been
broken, one more reason for not shipping DB Manager in the current state.
Cheers.

I'd add storicization of a table - I couldn't find anything easier for this.

Hello all,

-1 for me

I am big QGIS/PostGIS user and DB manager in QGIS allows me to do something
that you can't do elsewhere, run long spatial analysis using SQL.

I understand the development reasons for removing db manager from the
official release and I really enjoy all the effort that Alessandro put to
bring most functionality to the browser. Nevertheless, I don't think it
fully replaces db manager querying functionality, and I really don't think
it will ever do.

The execute SQL dialog is great and amazingly fast, but it doesn't replace
the db manager editor. The QGIS SQL Editor (db manager or not) needs to be
an independent window that one can keep open for as long as needed to
develop and run queries step by step, see the results, load them in the
project, re-run etc... Also, it is almost mandatory that the user, while
having the SQL script open, can check tables details, like column names,
preview their values, etc... to help write the queries. We need an
independent window or in the limit a panel to allow that together with the
browser panel.

This db manager functionality is unique, and is (in my opinion) one of the
reasons why QGIS is PostGIS de facto client.

There are other minor functionality that is still not present, but can be
added later, like being able to create and manage constraints. Or easily
create a view from a query.

I understand that for now the functionality I miss would be available as an
external plugin, but, not being in core, soon it will just stop working,
and no one will care. QGIS was born as PostGIS query and visualiser client,
in my humble opinion, by removing db manager at these stage we are
downgrading QGIS functionality.

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,

My de facto client is DBeaver, a cross platform FOSS general Database client (written in Java).
It even has a simple spatial viewer (as: show geometries on OSM, both for Postgis and Geopackages) in the data tabs.
(in my setup I have Mysql(spatial), Postgis, Geopackages and Oracle connections in one set)

Changing constraints/permissions/edits in data etc etc is really 'simple' (as in via gui).

So running a spatial analysis to me is:
- run a query in a <project>.sql file, create a view or temporary table for it
- load it in QGIS
(- saving all queries including comments in that sql file)

Would that be a work around for you?

It is like: A DB client like DBeaver should not try to be a (Q)GIS.... and vice versa ;-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I know dbeaver and like it alot and I use it too, but IMHO sending people
to another software is not a solution.

This is what I use dbeaver for, and as I said before that is not my main
concern.

Now this is where I think the workflow is incomparable. In QGIS you can
overlap and see several results at the same time. something that it's not
possible to do in dbeaver (or pgadmin). You can easily change your query
and reload again in a very easy and fast way. Creating views or temporary
tables in dbeaver to go and open it in QGIS, then if something went off go
back to dveaver do it again... Nah... :-p

I agree! My worries are not power users like you and me, we can use several
software at the same time without crossing the wires, But it's damn hard to
make common GIS folks transition to spatial databases and spatial SQL.
Although Alessandro brilliant work will help this transition, the SQL
editor from dbmanager was by far the best tool for spatial SQL.

This being said, I understand that db manager will eventually die anyway
for lack of maintenance if nothing is done otherwise. I just ask for some
time so we have a plan for making sure that important functionality is not
delegated to third party plugins.

Maybe I should lead a QEP followed by a crowd funding? If that is the issue.

"We" added lots of new functionality to QGIS, some of which I probably
won't ever use, I am ok with it, but it's hard to see functionality I use
everyday go away.

Thanks,

Alexandre

Hi, all,

I must say I agree with Alexandre; one of the most precious feature of QGIS
for me and the folks that work with me is the ability to very quickly and
easily interact with PostGIS, making experiments, testing a query,
adjusting, tailoring, comparing with other kinds of data sets, right there
on the QGIS interface. I also agree that QGIS is not a database
"manager"/"workshop"/"weaver" tool, so tasks such as creating database
models, adding or removing columns, creating or droping
tables/schemas/databases/roles might be out of scope for QGIS.

If the leaders really think the DB Manager plugin should go away, perhaps
the current functionality of the SQL Window from DB Manager (with the
ability to create a layer right from the query) could be moved to something
akin to the current Python console.

One of the greatest strengths of QGIS, compared to the proprietary industry
leader, is the ease and immediacy of working with all kinds of different
dataset types, and I feel that if the DB manager goes away without some
sort of replacement for its query window, this QGIS advantage will shrink a
little.

Thank you all.

I think Jos? has a good suggestion, maybe a fully integrated SQL console
could be the other way around the browser panel.
Having a "Database" Menu without any database management tool could be
funny and deceiving for new users. The idea of having SQL as another
language to manage geographic DBMSs (and not only PostGIS) seems
interesting albeit not new (who remembers MapBasic in MapInfo?). For some
time it seemed that the integration with Spatialite could become so strong
that I was becoming the way to handle all the features of QGIS in a
data-centric way.
Then the affirmation of geopackage seems to have changed the outlook for
QGIS.

This is all great feedback, thanks!

I wonder if you'd be willing to lead an effort to document the missing
functionality from dbmanager, and file QGIS tickets for these and
assign them to a new project in the QGIS github for "deprecating db
manager"? Some of these shortcomings should be relatively easy to
address (the modal dialog for instance is a relatively straightforward
change).

Ah, it's only visible in limited circumstances -- you need polygons
with z values and certain CRS/zoom combinations. I've added tests
covering this in the above PR.

Sure I will! I am on vacations, but next week I will start working on it.

Thanks!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pyinstaller to create stand alone app
Message-ID: <b3dc93cd998240f9873ca0da32e7708d@erdc.dren.mil>

I have the need to launch QGIS from a python file due to some other checks I need to setup before it is running.  I convert this python file to an exe but Windows Defender flags it as a virus.  The exe is created from a batch (.cmd) file with the following calls:

call "QGISenv.bat"
call "python3.exe  jcms_authenticate.py"

The jcms_authenticate.py file is what launches QGIS using a python Popen method.  I used bat2exe converter to convert my CMD file to an exe.  

I came across another method to convert python directly to an exe using pyinstaller but have had issues as mentioned  in the link below.  I am not using QGIS 3.4.4 but QGIS 3.16.16 and assume there is still the issue as I cannot successfully get the exe to work as I get the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "jcms_authenticate.py", line 7, in <module>
    from qgis.core import QgsApplication
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qgis'

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Overlay expression function without a current
 object
Message-ID: <5aff8f33553358990859ed19375f1e1d@carto.net>

Hi,

I would like to use the "overlay_within" expression function, but in 
layout context - and in this case I dont have a "current_feature".

The goal is to find out the municipality from the map center of my main 
map in the layout (but not in atlas context).

What I tried:

-----------

with_variable(
   'current_geometry',
   make_point(
     x( map_get( item_variables( 'Hauptkarte'), 'map_extent_center' ) ),
     y( map_get( item_variables( 'Hauptkarte'), 'map_extent_center' ) )
   ),
   overlay_within(
     layer:='Gemeindegrenzen',
     expression:=gemeindename
    )
)

------------------

But apparently the "overlay_within" geometry function needs a 
"$currentfeature" - which I don't have, but could create artificially 
with make_point from the map center.

Is there any way to "artificially" create a "$currentfeature", so that 
my overlay expression function would work?

Thanks for any ideas,

Andreas

Hi Luke,

it looks like your QGISenv.bat does not add the QGIS internal plugin 
folder to the PYTHONPATH.

You may use something like:

set PYTHONPATH=^
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\%QGIS_ENV%\python;^
%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\%QGIS_ENV%\python\plugins;^
%PYTHONPATH%

where OSGEO4W_ROOT is the path to where your QGIS is installed, and 
QGIS_ENV the release type, e.g. "qgis" or "qgis-ltr"

Greetings, Benjamin

Hi Andreas,

you can use the aggregate function for this, something like:

aggregate(layer:='layer1',
 ????????? aggregate:='concatenate',
 ?? ???? ? expression:="name",
 ?? ???? ? filter:=intersects(
 ?? ???? ? map_get( item_variables( 'Karte 1'), 'map_extent_center' ), 
$geometry),
 ?? ???? ? concatenator:=',')

and no need to build a point with make_point, the item variable 
map_extent_center is already a point.

Best regards

Stefan

Hi Stefan,

Excellent - it works fine! Thanks for this solution.

As someone who was quite a bit involved with aggregate expression 
functions I should have thought about that solution myself - but 
apparently, that was too long ago ...

Many thanks for this solution - So good to have QGIS expression power 
users around!

Andreas

- this change will affect many projects (including QGIS, which I believe 
leverages this variable in many places, such as build processes, 
plugins, widgets, etc.)
- ticket : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/49338
- note that this will be for the PROJ 9.1 release, but it's good for all 
projects to be ready for this upcoming change
- you can also see how MapServer will handle both possibilities, for 
now: https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/pull/6573

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1a77d933-ea98-8188-4c59-309410fde6c9@duif.net>

Hi People,

Just playing with pg_tileserv, to check if QGIS was able to load tiles from it with a small data set, I fail to load because:
"Error loading style: Style not found in database".
Though in the connection dialog it says that the Style URL is Optional...

Am I missing something? Tried with a fresh profile.
Or is there some generic url I should/could use?
(have to dive into these styling url's, to create one...)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] First User Experience: During startup,
 try/except the Python exceptions (of plugins)
Message-ID: <a7384583-a964-2f46-59bc-781c4aef842a@duif.net>

Hi, see for example:

https://github.com/flathub/org.qgis.qgis/issues/174

Would it be an idea to NOT show the python (plugin) exceptions during the startup of QGIS?

It find it for non tech users annoying that a plugin (which they sometimes do not use, anymore) is stopping QGIS from starting.
And yes: I know you can just close the (for non-techies very scary python backtrace window), but what about:

- during QGIS startup (plugin loading) instead of showing the exception, just 'disable' the plugin and leave a red message in the message bar?
- with maybe some instruction that they can get more (technical) info when the enable/disable the plugin, and THEN show the real exception window?

Would that be feasible/doable?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok, just found out: the layer is not loading IF there is NO other (xyz?) layer.

So when it is the first layer you load, it will give the warning and NOT show anything.

If you already loaded some other layer (for example OSM xyz), THEN all is fine

I'll create an issue for it... wondering if there is some simple global vector tile server which has the same issue, so it is easier to reproduce...

Ok, sorry for the fuzz...

I was serving some local dataset, which I could just not see when you do a 'zoom to layers' (because then QGIS zooms to epsg:3857 bounds / tile 1/0/0/)...

And the warning is just to be ignored apparently.

Have a nice day :-)

Hi Richard

You could test it with the Linz Basemaps vector tile server

http://basemaps.linz.govt.nz

Ah, thanks, playing with it now...

I first got a 'wrong api key issue', but it appears you can copy the right zxy url from the mentioned website (click the hamburger menu).
Currently it is:
https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz/v1/tiles/topographic/EPSG:3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf?api=c01g8ak5d21sr9ehazp3ftry1zw
(so you need to have that public api key in it which expires, go the the site!).
Style url then is currently:
https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz/v1/tiles/topographic/EPSG:3857/style/topographic.json?api=c01g8ak5d21sr9ehazp3ftry1zw

(now I have to find out how to style this myself, using maputnik or so...)

Thanks again,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I am Raghunath, working on an open source project for one of our client.

Recently developed an application using qgis-ltr-dev (installed using 
Network Installer). Our client requested to build these qgis-ltr-dev 
libraries using MSVC.

Trying to build release-3_16 version (with MSVC 2015) cloned from github 
and followed the instructions given in INSTALL.md document.

During the make process I am getting several errors.


Would be great if any one compiled to qgis from and share the version 
info which helps me to compile from source.

Regards
Raghunath

My challenge at the moment is to try to figure out how to display it in 
a website with Leaflet.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] A good task for someone wanting to get involved --
 update CPT ramps
Message-ID: <CAB28AshxavHvyA1Q-vcrHdKcGR1e2MQJ8i4syip7fSnAPHNT6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Here's an idea for a good task for someone wanting to get involved in
QGIS contributions which doesn't require any c++/python.

Currently we package a subset of the CPT ramps archive in QGIS, which
you can see here
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/resources/cpt-city-qgis-min

It's missing a lot of the ramps present in the current version of the
CPT archive from http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/ . Some
of these are because the licenses won't permit bundling with QGIS
(e.g. the ESRI sets), but others are just missing because we haven't
updated our subset in a loooooooooong time. (E.g. compare the subset
present in QGIS
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/resources/cpt-city-qgis-min/gmt
from the GMT set vs
http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/gmt/index.html )

It would be great to update our subset and re-sync it with the
upstream collection. We're missing a lot of nice ramps we could be
bundling by default :)

I'm happy to mentor this task if someone wants to give it a shot...

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-LLMjH02Ufas9N+T_UnVgiYWgtTWXZVssnV=nf7Ge+ww@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Been a while :)

I seem to be getting really slow downloads of the MSI packages (haven't
tested any other packages at the moment) from the main download page.

Slow as in 40+ mins for 1GB, and the download speed fluctuates quite a
lot.  This isn't a local internet issue for me as I have confirmed with
others on different connections that it's the same and we are all on
100mbps+.

I recall this used to be cached on a CDN to make it quicker is that not the
case anymore?

Regards,
Nathan

Dear E. Fischer,

Thanks for your reply.

I am able to download the repository into my local machine and installed 
the flex, bison and git (cygwin).

Could not find any build instructions in the repository. Can you please 
share the build/configure instructions in Windows environment?

Raghunath

It's redirected to several hosts - independant of the origin address.  So you
might get better results just by retrying.  Where did you actually download
from?  US (download.osgeo.org, ftp.osuosl.org; Oregon State, US) or Europe
(qgis.org, norbit.de; both at Hetzner in Germany)?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Digitize shapes in advanced digitizing toolbar
 concerns/suggestions
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GUNPrmqq-5nHtzyX+FPd3dAMfb9+CV=zjZpYuDjDAiow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I came across the "recent" change that integrates the options to select to
digitize with segments, curves, shapes, or streaming into a combobox
button. I love it. It makes sense. Thanks, Denis for it.

Nevertheless, the shapes option is dependent on another toolbar (Shape
Digitizing Toolbar), which had led to some bugs [0] but also to some
frustration to some users, not understanding why a strange message appear
when they just want to draw a polygon.

I opened a PR to change the wording of the message that informs the user
that if he decided to digitize using shapes, then he also needs to select
the shape he wants to use [1], but he might not even remember that the last
time he used it, he selected to digitize using shapes.

My suggestions:

1. On QGIS reload, always rollback to "digitize with segment" as default
2. On selecting shapes, automatically enable the Shape Digitizing Toolbar
3. On selecting shapes, automatically enable one of the options in the
shape digiting toolbar, to solve [0], even if the user never used it before.

I can open a feature request if more people agree.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is there a recommended way to include external
 Python packages
Message-ID: <68e2a692-504c-4bb5-b419-347d87fca0c5@servus.at>

I'm actually developing a QGIS plugin which depends on pysftp package to 
upload files to a server. For now I thought on asking users to install 
it manually, but it would be great to automatize the installation process.

So the options I see would be:
1. Install external package using pip from inside the plugin.
2. Include and ship external package with the plugin.
3. Ask user to install it manually using pip install.

Is there a recommended way to handle this situation?

Generally speaking it is not recommended, but I have done it with several
of my plugins (KML Tools, Date/Time Tools). If your python package is OS
dependent (not pure python) then you don't want to include it with your
plugin. My Density Analysis plugin can use the optional H3 library (which I
think might be worthwhile for QGIS to include as a part of its libraries),
but it is machine dependent so I did not include it. It is not ideal to
have users pip install the library, but you have to weigh the costs vs. the
benefits of using some library.

Good luck!

Thanks for your recommendations, with that in mind I'll go for the 
option 2, shipping the 3rd party package with the plugin.

Till now I did that including the whl-file, but after looking at your 
plugins I see the advantage of your code of adding the directory which 
contains the library to sys.path and then doing an import (see 
https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/qgis-datetimetools-plugin/blob/master/__init__.py)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsRasterLayer is very slow for rasters with a
 higher number of bands
Message-ID: <0af2d9ca-0d8d-3e2b-9c9d-f946d033f117@geo.hu-berlin.de>

Dear all,

it seems that QGIS has big problems to load rasters with a higher number 
of bands. De facto users cannot visualize data from hyperspectral 
satellites like EnMAP, DESIS or the CHIME in a responsive way.

In my case I tried to load an AVIRIS-NG image (425 bands x 1673 height x 
649 width, float, interlave=band) into QGIS. It took me more than half a 
minute until it appeared in the layers list and a much more time until 
it was rendered. In comparison, ArcMap showa the image almost immediately.

I did some benchmarks to compare how fast 1673x649 px images get loaded 
using plain GDAL and a QgsRasterLayer:
(a) ang_bsq_3bands.tif - 16 MB, a 3 band subset
(b) ang_bsq_425bands.tif ? 2.3 GB, all 425 bands

I don?t care about some milliseconds difference, but it shows that even 
the creation of the QgsRasterLayer is very very slow.

(2)Using QgsRasterLayer.LayerOptions(loadDefaultStyle=True)

Both images and my benchmark.py are available here: 
https://box.hu-berlin.de/d/c688ab6a8545414aaa16/
The original image (ang20180702t105516_rdn_v2q2) with line-interleave 
can be downloaded from the AVIRS-NG data portal 
https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/dataportal/

Maybe I have used the QGIS API in a wrong way or simply need to deactive 
a QGIS setting and everything becomes fine, but so far I could'nt find 
such a setting.

Should I open a github issue for that?

Greetings,
Benjamin

Hi,

see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/49404

I think(!) that QGIS is ignoring the 'enable feature paging' checkbox and 'max number of features' in the GUI for WFS/OAPIF connection

I got itworking via PyQGIS, using QGIS itself I never get more then 100 features?

Others can confirm?

Hi all,

I discovered that the QgsVectorLayerSaveAsDialog is not available in 
python bindings [0].

I have the need to export vector layers from a plugin with a similar 
dialog (with few options compared to the QGIS one).

Should I create a custom UI and python class or is another way to have 
the similar functionalities with other python classes (with UI of course 
:) )?

Cheers and thanks for any suggestion!

Hi Andrea,

thanks for the information, I missed that.

So no way to reuse some existing pyqgis API right?

Good evening,

I am trying to connect an external GPS to QGIS 3.26.1

I selected  COM4  as serial (the one where gps is )

But, if I press the "Connect" button, QGIS answers "Impossibile connettersi

Could I find some log or message to understand what I wrong?

Thank you in advance

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Temporal Controller / MDAL / NetCDF PR #48942
Message-ID: <a1c72639-d562-f276-3c51-addd222e9423@duif.net>

Hi Dev's,

anybody interested in Temporal Controller / MDAL / NetCDF is able to give some input at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/49283

so it won't get 'stale' ?

My issue [0] is that the temporal controller number of steps seems to be 'off by one' when loading NetCDF's.

But I'm not sure if this should be fixed as in my PR, or if that should be done in other place(s).
(before trying to fix all tests, it would be nice to have a 'go' for the actual fix first)

Thanks for any help,

Richard Duivenvorode

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Ubuntu and Problem Reported with Lat Lon Tools
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpGm-ASLOGb5TrHbpr1HEUtN53B1vS992Yqfg7zgY+v+A@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have had several reports of this error by some using Ubuntu and having
Lat Lon Tools installed.

Critical: Caught unhandled std::exception: std::bad_alloc

In one case a person updated Ubuntu and it worked correctly, but I have had
two more people report it. One using QGIS 3.24.1 and another with QGIS
3.16.11 and all got this error. It looks like one of the individuals was on
Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS. I don't know what the other two reports were using.

I don't know if this has anything to do with Lat Lon Tools and since I
don't use Linux, it makes it difficult to even know if it is the plugin's
problem or something else.

Has anyone else had a problem with Lat Lon Tools on Ubuntu? Does Lat Lon
Tools work for you on Ubuntu? Does anyone have any idea what this might be?

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Is it possible to make QGIS show the fired queries
 to databases in Debugging Tools?
Message-ID: <6ace2092-b6cd-8152-622d-973bfaa99a9b@duif.net>

Doing some Postgis work with QGIS, I often asked myself what queries QGIS is firing to the database.
I can off course log that in the database, but I was wondering if QGIS had some 'signal' which could be use to pass the queries used to the Debugging Tools?

I skimmed QgsDataProvider, QgsVectorDataProvider and the Postgres provider, but I think these are not so communicative as the QGIS Network request, so I think it will be harder then I hoped... as always :-(

OR am I missing some signal which could be used?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS else this is just a nice feature request for the Debugging Tools :-)

Hi Richard,

This should already be available in the debugging tools --> Query Logger

It was a recent QGIS grant project and developed by elpaso.

Greetings,

Andreas

Thanks Andreas, how can I have missed this...

Too many features syndrome I think :-)

Thanks, working great (at least for Postgis, not other db around here...)

Hi Richard,

Yes, this happens from time to time to me as well, that I am looking for 
a new feature and it turns out that it is already implemented ;-)

As far as I know, it is only implemented for Postgis so far - other DB 
engines could be added, if someone cares about it.

Greetings,

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to get the name for a
 QgsLayoutDesignerInterface object?
Message-ID: <4690c6b2-4344-3f04-07d2-378700640be5@terglobo.nl>

Hi developers,

I'm trying to get the name for a layout designer window, which is in a 
python variable (designer) of type QgsLayoutDesignerInterface.

designer.layout() returns a QgsLayout object but that class does not 
have a .name() function.

The QgsPrintLayout class does have a .name() function but I don't know 
how to get a QgsPrintLayout object from my designer.

Anyone?

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi,

It is currently implemented for PG, Oracle, MSSQL and spatialite.

Hi Raymond,

For the window title, you can try designer.window().windowTitle().

To get the QgsPrintLayout object, you can try designer.masterLayout() which
has the .name() method.

Nice to know ? -

What about GeoPackage ? Is it technically difficult or was is not 
requested ??

I'm just wondering. GeoPackage is - after all - a major data format for 
QGIS..

And both Spatialite and GeoPackage is based on the same db-technology: 
SQLite

Med venlig hilsen / Kind regards

The first: GPKG uses GDAL which internally calls SQLite C code, and
there is no interface to retrieve the actual SQL.

Wow, thank you so much, masterLayout() it is!
