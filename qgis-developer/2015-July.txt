Well, I can only say the same! We would never go back..

As a user and GISadmin, I must say I have less time on testing now than 2
years ago. I should really automate deployment tasks so that I can rely on
other advanced users to do testing during feature freeze. That implies that
those testers play the game, don't mess up with production work, and head
toward raising issues by themselves, directly in QGIS redmine, in english
also.. quite a lot of long term human work here! 

step by step, we go that way, keep up the fantastic work folks
Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Virtual layers for QGIS

Hi all,

Probably not the perfect timing, but anyway, I would like to move
forward on that topic of virtual layers.

The current implementation has already some use cases. It is not as
integrated into the expression engine as we might want, but it offers
possibilities that were hard to achieve before.

It consists merely of a new vector data provider. It does not depend on
particular modifications in QGIS. So the impact on the current API is
null. There will be some glue code in the app part of course,
but apart from that, I think including it into the core as just another
data provider won't bother other possible future implementations around
this concept. And it will serve as a functional prototype.

We may want to tag it as experimental or something like this, saying
that this is probably not the final (or the only) way QGIS will handle
the concept of "virtual layers" in the future.

And because it is only a data provider (... and a class in DBManager),
people may choose not to ship it with their binary version of QGIS if
they don't want to.

So ... is there any objection against that being pushed as a new vector
data provider for the 2.12 ?

+1 for me. A good feature IMO.

I think so of the UI needs work but that is easy enough to do after merge.

I think using an internal copy of OWSLib helps the Windows install?

I'm +1 to not maintaining OWSLib in QGIS, freezing against a
dep/version and having it as a build step but I don't know enough
about packaging.

Yep: if you open QGIS on commandline in Linux, adding

export QGIS_DEBUG=0
and then
qgis

and you will have just a few lines of output

If the answer is that there is no way that the 2.8.0 and 2.10.0 bugs would
ever have come to light before release, then sure, I accept the argument.
However, Nyall says that one of the bugs was apparent as a test failure.
Perhaps the best thing to do would have been to acknowledge that the flood
of test failures (mostly false negatives) needed to be addressed before the
release, and so the release should have been postponed.

While I mean what I said about our organization's use of QGIS
(Northumberland National Park Authority), other partner organizations (the
other UK National Park Authorities) are often less enthusiastic about what
they see as a risky migration to FOSS. My main point in raising this is that
the immediate requirements for patching .0 releases adds to this reluctance.

I would also disagree that FOSS users expect this. That used to be true when
FOSS users were all enthusiastic hobbyists or devs. QGIS is a million miles
beyond that, and is rightly challenging proprietary GISes in corporate
environments. While I might ask our GIS officer to use the nightly build and
report bugs, it's not his core job, nor other professional GIS officers'. He
would struggle to find the time. Also, neither he nor I are developers, so
there is an intimidating learning curve even in bug reporting and testing.

My original thought was that perhaps a better release roadmap would be
functionality-based rather than calendar-based - in other words, decide what
the dev priorities are, and release only when agreed milestones are reached.
Of course, the user base should be given indicative timescales, but the
deadlines should never trump QA.

Once again, of course I accept and understand that there are so few devs and
testers compared to the user base. My point is that that is a block to the
growth of the software which should be discussed, and therefore should not
simply be accepted as a given.

Thanks again, everyone. I'm only raising because I believe that adoption of
QGIS might suffer because of it.

Agreed, quality assurance is an important aspect.
And I'm glad it's improving so much lately.

Would you be willing to buy an yearly subscription for a QA service
on QGIS releases ? Think of it as an alternative to an yearly usage
license acquisition. If enough corporate users would be ok with that,
I'm sure the QGIS PSC will be very happy to have someone with the
right core skills take care of that part time. 360 euro a year by
100 users would mean being able to spend 3000 euro per month on a QA
officier (just an example).

It's not about decisions, but about putting the money where they are needed.

If it were my budget, then yes, I would consider it, so long as enough others
did so as well, to get the hours required for it to have an effect. That
figure is roughly the support for 1 year's support for a proprietary GIS for
a single user (very roughly, from memory), so I would hope that many
organizations using QGIS would consider it.

I would say often it is a matter of luck - sometimes we end up
releasing a solid x.x.0 version, sometimes there are quick bugfix
releases needed. Postponing a release does not really solve anything -
there is still a chance that a critical bug will be found just few
hours after a release.

That is exactly why we have introduced long-term releases (LTR) for
QGIS - for organizations that just need a stable QGIS for their work,
without having to worry about instabilities, testing and reporting
bugs. And of course there are various companies in the QGIS community
which offer support and fixing of bugs, should you encounter any in
your workflow.

We used feature-based releases before, producing new version of QGIS
when certain milestones were reached - and it didn't work that well:
- there were times with no new release for a year (a long time for many)
- hard to find consensus when is the right time to release (there will
be always voices for releasing ASAP and voices for delaying the
release)

I can understand your concerns, I hope though that LTRs solve them
already to a great degree - please correct me if I am wrong.

But the only .0 LTR so far (2.8) was not stable.

I understand that. I was simply replying to the call for more testing and
reporting.

Which is why we had a 2.8.1 not too long after proving the point of those
releases.

The one and only solution is more testing, there is no magic fix to any of
this.  Raising testing awareness and money is a good start.

But as of now we are now with 2.8.2, which seems already pretty
stable. If you use 2.8.x LTR, nobody will force you to switch
immediately to LTR 2.14.0 once it is released. You can wait for
several more months since release of 2.14.0 and switch to 2.14.x only
after it has received further fixes.

I do accept all your points. I am also probably confusing LTR with stable.
Just because a .0 is LTR should not define it as more stable than a non-LTR
.0.

Hi Devs,

wanted to show off QGIS digitizing here to somebody, and got lost in the
different 'snapping options' options we have:

http://imgur.com/wgouUTB

Am I right that most of the 'Snapping' parts in the Options/Digitizing
dialog are obsolete now (like default snap mode en the tolerance).
There is also not a connection between these: setting default snapping
tolerance in that one does not modify the one in the 'Snapping and
Digitizing Options' dialog and vice versa?

Is this some left-overs from an earlier snapping module?
Or do I miss something here?

/me just trying to get rid of too many options :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

I believe the values in options>digitizng will be be used as default 
values for the advanced snapping mode. These are layer specific.

The values you set in Options dialog are your global preferences. So
if you start a new project, these are the values your projects will
get by default.

For snapping itself, it is important what is in your Snapping Options
dialog (or dock).


> Is this some left-overs from an earlier snapping module?

So they are not really leftovers. Maybe it would be good to add some
description text to the Options dialog to explain what the values are
good for.

Also, I think it would be good to move snapping options as another tab
to Project Properties dialog - to keep it together with other project
settings.

Cheers

as default values for each new layer you add to your project (in Advanced

way). Next time you open a new project not an existing one), these values
will be used also for the two other snapping modes (current layer , all
layers).

Hi Tom,

Many users reported me they are very happy with the new LTR systel. The
subject is not to be able to have a bug free 2.8.0 by delaying its release
for more months, but to have several bugfix release made for this LTR (via
backporting), even when another version (2.10 or 2.12) have been released.
This was not the case earlier ( "point release" were made only for current
version). This is for me and many users a real improvement : more
stability, and more time to get used to one release (and prepare/adapt
courses)

Regards
Micha?l

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proportionnal symbol
Message-ID: <5594EFC5.3020408@unilim.fr>

Hi, I use this list because I post a report on QGIS 2.10 and Giovanni 
Manghi tell me to send you e-mail with the problem :


I try the nighlty version of QGIS 2.9.25 and I have a problem with the 
size method in graduate symbol. The size method should be in categorized 
symbol and unique symbol but not in graduated. This is the first problem 
because we can't give a size to class in graphic semiology, each 
different value should have a different size.
The other problem is the mathematic calcul for the size, actually it's 
false, the right calcul is radius = square root(quantity/pi) we can 
after that multiply or split by a value all the radius value. To solve 
the problem of really small circle we could choose a minimum size for 
value under a custom limit. For the big circle we can choose a max value 
for the radius and find the most appropriated ratio between the max 
value we want and the radius initially calculate. I hope you could 
understant what I'm trying to say.
This is very important because the proportionnal symbol are really 
essential for cartographer and legend associated too.

Have a good day

Ok so I'm back here to this topic.
I've just pushed a fix for a bug in both the 2.8 and master branches.
The ticket is here: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12802

>From the ticket you can correctly see two "associated revisions",
but there's no information about which versions got the fix.

The "Target version" field of the ticket allows a single value,
so can't express both. There's no 2.8.3 target so can't express
"oldest fixed". The "associated revisions" widget doesn't tell what
the target version of each branch is.

How should we deal with this, other than via comments in the ticket ?
Could the "Target version" become an array ?

After lots of help and contributions from Akbar, I think this is now working.
If anyone else would find the information useful, see:

I fixed that in master and 2.10 in GDAL and OGR provider adding mutex
in data items on GDALOpen/OGROpen using #ifndef
SPATIALITE_VERSION_G_4_1_1 which we had already.

Unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the crash with spatialite
4.1.1 before the fix, please test on systems where it was crashing.

Thanks Radim. I think this is serious enough to release a fixed version
straight away. We have funds to cover additional expenses for this.
Any objections?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 2.8.2: Scale indicator doesn't work
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP18BEFFD731CA49883EAAC3A7970@phx.gbl>

hi all,
starting qgis, the scale indicator in the status bar works for few 
seconds and then it blocks to a minimum value of 1:13 or maximum to 1:849.
At the same time, if I choose the fixed-values it doesn't work as well.

am i the only one? I didn't find any ticket. This happens for 2.8.2 
osgeo 64bit but it seems solved in 2.11. I think could be interesting to 
have it fixed by 2.8.3 release.

All the best,

Niccol?

Nobody confirms this bug in 2.10 ?

The layer produced by the 'difference' tool in QGIS can't be used in a
further analysis because of invalid geometries.
"Difference" is used in many GIS analysis. This is a regression for me.

?I just tried in master with QGIS sample data and difference worked fine.

Have to install 2.10 to try.

Hi Radim,

just fresh compiled your latest commit:

http://i.imgur.com/QqtHvdi.png

but still crashing here on Debian Testing, if opening browsers on files,
or trying 'Save As'. See about box dump above for lib versions

Anything special I have to try/do to test?

Bad, can you post a backtrace? Can you verify if it is really locked?
It should print something like

src/providers/gdal/qgsgdaldataitems.cpp: 48: (QgsGdalLayerItem) [0ms]
[thread:0x7f721802da80] lock
src/providers/gdal/qgsgdaldataitems.cpp: 48: (QgsGdalLayerItem) [0ms]

in debug output when a folder in the browser is expanded.

I have not done anything with save as.

?I can confirm that difference (e.g. region - lakes from ?the QGIS sample
data) does produce broken results in both 2.10 and 2.11 (OSGeo4W).

Please open a ticket.

Best wishes,

I'm trying to find a document which was floating around a year or two ago.

"roadmap for 2.2". It was a spreadsheet with a ton of features and fixes
which would hopefully be addressed in some (past) release, and from memory
it had some really nice stuff in it.

Does anyone remember this document and have a link to it?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin names: remove `plugn`?
Message-ID: <55962F12.3040006@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
some plugin have either a name of the type `Something plugin` or a
folder name something_plugin, or both. Although it does not hurt, I
think this is pleonastic, it is inconsistent and thus it may be slightly
confusing, and it would seem me better to avoid using `plugin` in both
contexts.
If there is no objections, I'm going to suggest this to plugin authors,
and add a note on http://plugins.qgis.org/
Thanks for your thoughts.
All the best.

Nope, it is just that I think it is the same issue... But isn't it
'just' a fact of a wrong spatialite lib, or I mean to say: are you sure
we can fix this without fixing the spatialite lib?

We cannot 'disable' spatialite in our compiled gdal lib, can we?
Or compile QGIS in a way to totally forget about it (while we have this
issue in Debian)?

Still the same.

I thought we can, I thought that the problem is concurrent calling of
spatialite_init () from multiple threads. I don't know details about
why it crashes in spatialite_init(), but mutex lock does not help.
I'll revert the commit.

GDALOpen/OGROpen are only used to identify if it is Shapefile to add
SetCrs capability, can you try to comment
 GDALAllRegister() and everything after that in
QgsGdalLayerItem::QgsGdalLayerItem and
OGRRegisterAll() and everything after that in QgsOgrLayerItem::QgsOgrLayerItem?
If it works, it can be disabled using SPATIALITE_VERSION_G_4_1_1.

> We cannot 'disable' spatialite in our compiled gdal lib, can we?

We call GDALAllRegister/OGRRegisterAll, I dont see a possibility to
exclude a driver apart GDALDeregisterDriver (GDALDriverH)
but GDALAllRegister/OGRRegisterAll are spread around QGIS code (19/5
occurences).

> Or compile QGIS in a way to totally forget about it (while we have this issue in Debian)?

Disable spatialite in GDAL? No idea.

Unfortunately I am leaving now and will be back in a week so I cannot
help in next days.

Hi Radim,

please consider this previous post:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2015-May/037824.html

- spatialite_init() is now *deprecated*, because as we sadly discovered
   by direct on the field experience this method was thread unsafe.
   please note: it's not only calling spatialite_init() itself that is a
   thread unsafe operation: it's the library as a whole that becomes
   irremediably thread unsafe and crash prone if initialized this way,
   because it will continue to depend on the obsolete thread unsafe API
   provided by both GEOS and PROJ.4

- there is only one possible remedy allowing to safely use 
libspatialite
   even on multithread applications: carefully removing any call to
   spatialite_init() and duly switching to the new alternative mechanism
   supported by all recent versions of libspatialite and based on:
       spatialite_alloc_connection()
       spatialite_init_ex()
       spatialite_cleanup()
   this change will cause libspatialite to always call the most recent
   GEOS/PROJ.$ thread safe API and will effectively resolve any
   multithreading related issue.

OTH
Sandro

Hi,

I'm trying to load oracle table with sql expression like explain here:
http://blog.georepublic.info/2013/joining-tables-with-sql-using-pyqgis/

My python code:
uriOracle = QgsDataSourceURI()
uriOracle.setSrid("EPSG:3948")
uriOracle.setConnection('xxxxxxxx', 'xxxxx','xxxxx', 'consultsig','consultsig')

uriOracle.setDataSource( "", "(select * from COMMUNE sort by ccocom)", "GEOM", "","id")

layer = QgsVectorLayer(uriOracle.uri(), 'communes', 'oracle')
if  not layer.isValid():
  print "Layer failed to load!"

But layer is not valid.
Did I miss something?
(I want to load layer but already sorted on a field value...)
Thanks

Sylvain

Subject: [Qgis-developer] from vectGeoref to Vector Rectify
Message-ID: <20150703190543.7fe81afc@acerCF>

Hello everyone,


someone could remember the development of a QGIS plugin for
georeferencing vector layers: vectGeoRef, a feeble attempt to make
available to vector layers the same wonderful tool available to raster
layers;

with the valuable contribution of Luca Mandolesi who carried out the
gui, some time ago (I do not remember exactly when) I published a draft
of a tool for QGIS, depositing it in the repository, perhaps causing
some joy, but I fear more pain, to some of you and to others around the
world :-)

now I'm particularly happy to give notice that the project is
enriched and evolved with the addition of Daniele Strigaro, whom
I yield willingly the leadership of the project;

Daniele, a young researcher at the Laboratory of Geomatics in Milan
Bicocca, brought substantial improvements.

'Vector Rectify' is the new plugin's name to highlight its detachment to
the previous version;

soon the new plugin will be available in the usual repository;


thank you, sfmbe(*)
Giuliano


(*) sorry for my bad english :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build error with qgscontexthelp_texts.cpp
Message-ID: <5596E935.1080800@gwdg.de>

Hello list,

I am one of the guys, who prepare ports of QGIS for other operating
systems. In my case, it is for the FreeBSD OS [1]. I am in the process
of porting QGIS 2.10.0 at the moment, probably only one last bigger
problem exists.


For some weeks now, when I try to build QGIS from sources, it often but
not always fails with an error about src/core/qgscontexthelp_texts.cpp
[2]. Creating this file on FreeBSD gives an unrecognizable
character(string) in l11:88. This differs from build to build. Here are
some examples for line 11 from several builds:

gContextHelpTexts.insert( "CMakeFiles", QCoreApplication::translate(
"context_help", "^\n"

gContextHelpTexts.insert( "CMakeFiles", QCoreApplication::translate(
"context_help", "?`?\n"

gContextHelpTexts.insert( "CMakeFiles", QCoreApplication::translate(
"context_help", "(\n"

gContextHelpTexts.insert( "CMakeFiles", QCoreApplication::translate(
"context_help", "w?\n"


It seems, there is an internationalization problem? This happens at
least with locale en_US.UTF-8 and de_DE.UTF-8.

Unfortunately, I have no clue, if this is an upstream related problem or
more likely, with the FreeBSD toolchain :(

Any help is really appreciated. Please, let me know if I should give
more information, thanks.

Best regards,
Rainer Hurling

Hi,

Oracle provider often needs more information to load a layer from an
SQL Query: 
* the wkbType (if it can't be deduced from the layer)
* the primary key column.

You could add the following lines before calling the layer:

uriOracle.setWkbType(QGis.WkbPolygon) # Or whatever WKBType
uriOracle.setKeyColumn(u"GID") # Use the name of the primary key of COMMUNE table

It should work better...

Furthermore, be sure that your query is valid (I am not sure that SORT BY
is a valid SQL clause, use ORDER BY).

If this is not the case, what does the Oracle tab of the log window
says ?

Best regards,

Hi,
I have many print composers in a project and would like to select one of
them, knowing its name. The only way I found yet is to iterate over all
composer views :
for cView in iface.activeComposers():
  if cView.composerWindow().windowTitle() == 'myTitle':
     # do what I want

Is this the only way to do it? Isn't there a more direct way to access
print composer?

Well, the binary packages are also there.  Just the announcement (and the
website update that goes with is missing).   But that's 2.10.0.

2.10.1 is probably waiting for http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13082 - which is
related to the ogr pool patch, which in turn is the reason 2.10.0 
wasn't announced

If that hadn't popped up, we probably already have 2.10.1.

Sandro has submitted a PR for that fix - I've tested it quickly and it
works OK for me, but I don't feel comfortable pushing those changes myself
(it's not an area of code I have much experience with and potentially has
greater implications).

The only other serious regression that had popped up so far is
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13078 , relating to oversized symbols in the
legend when using map units. I don't think anyone is actively working on
that though so it shouldn't be a blocker for 2.10.1.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with PIL library in Windows 7, 64 bits
Message-ID: <559BD051.2070809@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using PIL library in Windows 7, 64 bits for to reduce the size of 
images. That library comes with the Qgis 2.8.2 instalation standard. The 
problem is that de resulting images are bad.

In previous versions of Qgis the code worked fine. I firstly instaled 
Qgis 2.8.2, 32 bits, but Python cant load _imaging module. I get that 
error when I use the resize method of a Image object.

With Qgis 64 bits, the module can be loaded, but the results are not 
correct when the images are resized (half of the image is black, o red). 
That's the code:

         im = PIL.Image.open(imgIn)

         tamX=im.size[0]
         factor=float(700)/tamX

          out=im.resize([int(factor * s) for s in 
im.size],PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS)
          out.save(imgOut)

Then I can not resize the images with the PIL library that comes with 
the standard installation of Qgis 2.8.2.

At the same computer, I have installed Python 2.7, 32 bits, and PIL 
library. The same code works fine.

What I can do?

Thank you very much.

It seems that the problem is solved deactivating GRASS (both 6 and 7).

I'll try to make more tests.

Hope this help

Subject: [Qgis-developer] iface.activeLayer() strange behavior when no
 layers are selected in the layers tree
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673FuKMq4z-+EtpJ9j1ObMxX_-oF=J0JKCD_9DJxvfFTbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

today some users showed me something confusing:


A1. start QGIS loading the last opened project
A2. no active layers in the layers tree
A3.  iface.activeLayer() returns None (so far so good)

B1. start QGIS loading the last opened project
B2. click on a layer in the layers tree
B3.  iface.activeLayer() return the layer (so far so good)
B4. CTRL+CLICK on the selected layer
B5. apparently no layer are selected in the layers tree at this point
B6. iface.activeLayer() return the previously selected layer

What sound confusing to the users that pointed me to this behavior is that
in A1 and B5 the GUI looks exactly the same (no layers are selected in the
layers tree) but in B5 iface returns a layer while in A1 it doesn't.

Should I file a ticket?

I've started converting geopole.org to a CSW service with a backwards

Pirmin: if you are doing the CSW in pycsw feel free to ping
me for help :)

Either way this is great news as the CSW can also be used within MetaSearch.

Message-ID: <78A98BC0-6A2D-48A6-9B75-43510E7D3A7A@qgis.org>

Hi all


In N?debo at the hackfest we had some lengthy discussions about finally forming a legal entity for QGIS. With Andreas Neumann?s help we have drawn up a draft charter for creating a SWISS ?Verein? and would like to get the process underway. I have created a new QEP proposal here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/22 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/22>

And there is the draft statute document available here:

https://docs.google.com/a/qgis.org/document/d/1FcChHYgoI4FlURrZRYBjD8kB6IBW_BaG0Ieg8TDT0pM/edit?usp=sharing <https://docs.google.com/a/qgis.org/document/d/1FcChHYgoI4FlURrZRYBjD8kB6IBW_BaG0Ieg8TDT0pM/edit?usp=sharing>

In the latter document anyone should be able to make comments - we will try to address all the comments and concerns you may raise in that document. Please keep your comments there brief and in the form of proposed amended wording to the document, and lets discuss in more detail where needed here on the mailing list. Hopefully the provided links above give sufficient background as to the why and how we intended to create the legal entity - if not we would be happy to run through our thinking. I believe Matthias Kuhn also recorded a short presentation I did at N?debo explaining our plans - Matthias if it is of suitable quality, perhaps you could share that clip in this thread?

Message-ID: <72a2083fd06045cd8888ca597966c7be@Exchange1.fugro.de>

Hello,

we try to write non-ASCII characters inside of a QGIS python plugin. There is no problem with the script but with the attribute table, where the characters are not written in utf-8 or sth. else (see attachment). Any suggestions?

Here is an example of our code to fill the attribute table. Row means a list entry which is utf-8 coded.

                               for row in cursor.fetchall():
                                               # add feature
                                               feat = QgsFeature()
                                               feat.setGeometry( QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(row[3], row[4])) )
                                               feat.setAttributes([row[1], row[2], row[3], row[4], self.path, row[0], row[5]])
                                               provider.addFeatures([feat])

Hi Christian,

what type of layer are you writing in? Is the layer's source utf-8 
encoded and is its coding set to utf-8?
When I encountered encoding problems I found this [1] site very 
informative and also fun to read.

As a result, calculating contours on the kernel result in a wrong
projection (missing +towg84, thus resulting in a custom CRS).
Another bug, or result from the previous one?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I met bugs in the voronoi function several times before. There is 
already a bug:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/8002

but it seems hard to reproduce.

Is it the same?

I guess I've found another bug with a layer which contains only 3 points.
One point is not in a polygon.

hmm, not sure that it is related to that change, but I don't know how
CRS are handled in the sdat format (hadn't thought about that...) so I
will check it. If the issue is there, deffinitely it should be fixed,
since it is a regression

Hi Pierre

QgsLayerTreeModel and QgsLayerTreeView are not necessary to use here:
they only make the QgsLayerTreeNode hierarchy available for display in
Qt widgets.

What you actually want to do is to manipulate the tree nodes
(QgsLayerTreeGroup and QgsLayerTreeLayer objects) - for a group you
just need to reorder the children nodes according to the alphabetical
order. See my blog post on manipulating nodes:
http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2014/07/25/qgis-layer-tree-api-part-2/

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] NULL and zeroes get mixed in postgis provider
Message-ID: <1436450581046-5215064.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 

we discovered quite a nasty issue here, probably here for a long time but I
could'nt reproduce it correctly before. 

With postgis tables or views, when numeric fields (tested with int, real and
numeric) bears null values, and also 0 values, NULLs and zeroes are mixed
randomly, at some zoom or pan levels only! 

we got aware of this because of rendering rules :
-With categorized renderer, styling and labeing change, which is more than
weird. 
-With graduated renderer, features simply disappear because NULL values
can't be rendered in a class because it requires numeric values. 

But that seems to come from provider since we have a nice effect on
attribute table:
 -We clearly see those value changes in attribute tables
 -When filtering attribute table on visible features in mapcanvas extent,
those renderer with NULL just don't appear!


See the video here :   http://youtu.be/kDip8wEeXxU?hd=1
<http://youtu.be/kDip8wEeXxU?hd=1>  

reproduced on 2.8.2 too,  but not on 2.6.1. 

Not putting it as a blocker, because it seems a rare use case, but certainly
a "must fix", and probably deserves backports.

Cheers

R?gis

Ticket will be filed, when redmine will be fixed ;-)

I do not think so, you just have to select the affected version
(dropdown on the right).
All the best.

I recently removed the default.  I just wanted to avoid that is tagged to every
bug even if it actually affects a different version.  So that you now have to
select one wasn't really intended, but is probably still a good thing.

Hi all,
who will be at FOSS4G-EU, next week? I'd be glad of having a QGIS
informal meeting at one of the BoF spaces we have [0].
Anyone interested? Could someone suggest a time and date?
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

I will be there, I'll give a short talk about Python on QGIS Server
(plugins etc.), it's scheduled for the 15th in room VS.9 at 3:40 PM.

Unfortunately I must leave the meeting the 16th in the afternoon.

See you there!

Hi

I'll be there on Wednesday.

@strk
Will you be attending? Would be a nice occasion to have a discussion 
about some GEOS work needed for QGIS, I'm thinking in particular about 
the issue of exposing the PrecisionReducer functionality in the C API 
(as we already discussed to some extent a few months back).

Best,
Sandro

Paolo

After much thinking, i think this should be solved now with this:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/519d3dc3b769e8aa6b0d849f4c58521833a90816

Basically the problem is that when a CRS is assigned to a layer, QGIS
uses the qpj file to store that, not the prj file. External apps like
SAGA use the prj file, which usually doesn't thave the authority info,
and ignore the qpj file, which is a QGIS-only thing.

What I am doing is, once the SAGA algorithm is run, I replace the prj
files of the resulting layers with the algorithm output crs
definition, taken from the toWkt() method (which, if there's authority
info in the input layers, should write it in the WKT definition as
well). This will work fine since SAGA only generates sdat and shp
files (which use prj files when loaded by QGIS), and there are no SAGA
algorithms that perform any reprojections.

As you can see the solution is trivial and just a few lines of code...
Sometimes it is like that for problems that appear to be the toughest
ones :-)

I did some testing for the case that you mention with the kernel
desnsity surface, and it seems to be working. This also solves a
problem that could appear when creating an output in a format other
than sdat (the conversion from sdat to another format, internally
performed by Processing using gdal, is also now more robust with this
change, as user-defined CRSs are not likely to appear now unless they
are real user-define ones)

Also, this should fix the issues with CRSs that appeared with vector
layers as well.

Please, test and let me know if there are other issues.

Thanks!

Hi R?gis,

I used the time I had while doing an exam supervision today to
investigate this.
If you have the possibility to validate the pull request, that would be
great.

Hi All,

I am trying to find the AutoGCP plugin referred to here:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2010-September/009539.html
I also know there is a GUI for it under Ubuntu.

Is there anyone who has all the code and GUI application on this list?
Could you share them with me if you do?

Thanks in advance!
Tom

Hi Matthias, Thanks for that. 

I won't be able to test soon, vacations are coming and we are on heavy load on catalogs and qgi server.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Build error after refactor stageinstall of plugins

Hello list,

from #390d832 on (2015-07-09, refactor stageinstall of plugins), I get

This happens on FreeBSD 11.0-CURRENT amd64. I can confirm, that there is
no 'python/plugins/fTools/resources_rc.py'.

Any help is really appreciated, many thanks in advance.

I have saved the plugin way back in 2011. You can download it 
temporarily from

http://home.arcor.de/andre.joost/autogcp.zip

but I doubt it will work with QGIS 2.x without refactoring. I have no 
experience with it.

You might get further help from the contributor of the ticket
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2987  http://hub.qgis.org/users/698
Not sure if the mail adresses there is still valid.

This blog entry might also be a help: 
http://linfiniti.com/2010/10/automated-gcp-collection-in-quantum-gis/

http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_AddOns#i.points.auto is another 
approach with GRASS, unfortunately not part of the QGIS processing toolbox.

Hi Victor,
tested, it seems not to solve the issue at least on Debian sid (saga
2.1.4). The kernel is still created without a crs.
Since it works on windows, could you please publish the new version, so
we can enjoy wider testing (and we can use it more easily in the
upcoming foss4g-eu)?

All the best.

hmmm, really weird. Can you check that the prj file that is created
has the same content as the one of the input file?

it should not be different on linux or windows, since it has nothing
to do with saga actually. It is just rewritting the prj file, which
should be the same in both OSs

Anyway, good idea, we will publish a new version and let people test it

Thanks

Hi

I just wanted to compile/install latest master with Homebrew on Yosemite
but I do get some error:

-- Installing:

It worked a approx. a month ago. PyQt/pyrcc4 is installed. But it seems
that resources_rc.py is not build.

Any ideas?

this is the prj:

PROJCS["OSGB 1936 / British National Grid",GEOGCS["OSGB
1936",DATUM["OSGB_1936",SPHEROID["Airy
1830",6377563.396,299.3249646,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7001"]],TOWGS84[446.448,-125.157,542.06,0.15,0.247,0.842,-20.489],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6277"]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4277"]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",49],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-2],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996012717],PARAMETER["false_easting",400000],PARAMETER["false_northing",-100000],UNIT["metre",1,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],AXIS["Easting",EAST],AXIS["Northing",NORTH],AUTHORITY["EPSG","27700"]]

so it looks like a qpj, I think this is why it is not recognized.

please do, thanks!

Message-ID: <55A10C4D.8090300@gwdg.de>

Dear List,

Now, that SAGA GIS has new official release 2.2.0 [1] and the trunk
version is 2.2.1, it would be nice to have that respected in the QGIS
processing toolchain. The patch should mention for both, 2.2.0 and 2.2.1.

Additionally, is seems necessary to have a new file SagaAlgorithm220.py
created like SagaAlgorithm214.py?

Ok, so no way to see changes that affect Processing other than
browsing the full list of commits... :-(

I was thinking about something like this, in case there were API changes

http://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compatibility%202.1.3/

And maybe a list of new algorithms that have been added. Otherwise, it
is much more work to find out what we should change in the Processing
code...

Thanks for you help!

Victor,

I must say, that I am not one of the devs of SAGA GIS. I am only the
person, who is porting towards FreeBSD. So it is likely, that I am not
aware of all information, which should be present atm.

As far as I know, there is nothing like
http://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compatibility%202.1.3/ for
version 2.2.0.


One interesting way to get the needed information is to diff the two
interface description files:

http://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Changelog%202.1.4/attachment/saga_cmd_interface_v2_1_4.txt

http://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Changelog%202.2.0/attachment/saga_cmd_interface_v2_2_0.txt

That should point to the places with differences and in many cases it
describes all you need. A bit tricky are the cases, where
functionalities have been moved in the menu tree.


A second way could be, to compile a Unix version of SAGA GIS for
yourself. Then you can enable building of 'development tools'. After
that, in the GUI there is a new entry "Development Tools" with one entry
"Extract Tool and Menu Information". Depending on the value of 'level',
this will create two tables with information about tools and menues in
different detail. If you create these tables in versions 2.1.4 and
2.2.0, they could be diffed also.


If this is not sufficient, asking on
saga-gis-developer at lists.sourceforge.net could help. My experiences with
this list are very good. They are helpful and responsible.

Greetings,
Rainer

Oops, I just tried and I am sorry. There are no development tools in
version 2.1.4. So you can't enable them and this diff is not possible :(

I attached two tables, generated with dev tools of version 2.2.1 (trunk,
r2539). This version is very neat to 2.2.0.

Message-ID: <1436718519295-5215334.post@n6.nabble.com>

I, try to create qgis installer from qgis master which I have downloaded from
Github.

I am following the install instruction which are available there in qgis
install. I want to do it on window 7.

I have downloaded following softwares:-
OSGeo4W
CMAke 3.0.8
cygwin (bison, flex,git)
Visual Studio 2010 Express C++
SDK for window 7
github
inno setup
nsis-3.0b1-setup

Now everything is installed.

As I m new to everything. I dont know how to follow the path to create and
qgis installer.

First i run cmake-gui. but it gives error that your project file is invalid.
And I stuck there only.

Do you have any step by step procedure to create installer for me (dummy). I
had read your articles and lot more, hope you could help me out.

Please please do the needful. LEt me know the exact procedure to create the
qgis installer.

I am following the path given in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL
but unable to reach my goal..

Hope somebody will help me out.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multio Ring Buffer Plugin
Message-ID: <CAFTGJ2AxZcwo8BOWq7zxUCLN=QTrzoeH_vVDj36VMJLiXZd8ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just submitted my first plugin, via the share a plugion in the repo:
Multi Ring Buffer

Similar to the "Multi-distance" buffer but works with a fixed supplied
distance and number of rings.

So for example if you want to create 100 rings, it is quicker than
putting in all your numbers.

In the first version it only works with the selected layer, but will
add further functionality of layer selection later.

Happy to anwser any questions or fix any issues.

Ok, i tested with your CRS definition and it works fine

I create a shapefile and add that CRS definitino in a prj file. I open
that file and the CRS is correctly identified as EPSG:27700 - OSGB
1936 / British National Grid.

Then I calculate kernel density, and the output sdat file has a prj
file with exactly that same CRS definition (this is what the fix that
i added does, just moving the CRS definition from  input to output).
Can you check that it is not happening like that in your case, opening
the prj file of the sdat file and comparing?

Computing contour lines with the density layer works as expected, also
using the same CRS definition.

Cheers

Message-ID: <1436771477586-5215356.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,

I need your help.
I have build QGIS 2.8.2 on Visual Studio 2008.
When I try to load python plugin I am getting error at this line of code
(and application is exiting)

evalString( "qgis.utils.startPlugin('" + packageName + "')", output );

inside 

bool QgsPythonUtilsImpl::startPlugin( QString packageName )
{
  QString output;
  *evalString( "qgis.utils.startPlugin('" + packageName + "')", output );*
  return ( output == "True" );
}

I have checked and found utils.pyc in my folder
D:\QGIS\build\output\python\qgis.


I don't know where is the problem. 
Please help.

Thanks,
Azghar

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Freeze on release-2_8 branch
Message-ID: <55A3971A.2000700@opengis.ch>

Dear developers,

The last LTR is already more than 2 months old, in this time 138 commits
have been pushed to release-2_8.
It is great to see how actively this LTR is being maintained and
bugfixes being backported.

Unfortunately it seems impossible that we have an unintentional 2 weeks
timeframe without anything being backported.

As with this amount of fixes ready to be shipped I think it would be a
pitty not doing it.

I think it would be great to branch a release-candidate-2_8_3 (no
binaries released, just to backport possible issues identified on the
release-2_8 binaries, related to pre-rc-commits). This way people can
happily continue to backport stuff.

Until this happens (and mainly for the situation where it does not happen)
*I would like to ask all committers to stop backporting to the
release-2_8 branch* as of tomorrow, July 14, 2015 (so you have still
today to push the urgent fixes you never got round to merge).
This way we'll have a stable 2.8.3 in the beginning of August.

Thank you very much,
Matthias

INT_MIN on Debian should be defined in /usr/include/limits.h

I don't think so.

What's the point if there are no binaries?  Testing is done not intensive
enough even with binaries - w/o binaries it's likely to be even worse.

That's can be done without a separate branch - and w/o a separate branch there
would be nightlies to test...

My concern is more when https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2197 is going to be
resolved - as that is what 2.10.1 is waiting for.

Hi!
I had the same problem for a short while - but to my knowledge this is
already solved in the latest master ..
At least mine compiles without problem.

kind regards

6h is not short - but maybe 15min still is ;)

That our release manager does not need to create yet another set of
binaries. And I am confident, that a bug introduced with a
pre-release-candidate commit will also be identified on the binaries
produced for the release-branch with a couple of unrelated commits on top.

There are still 24 hours to merge it and follow the proposed schedule.

I still don't get the purpose of the release-candidate-2_8_3 branch.

I'd say we declare a backport freeze now and only apply stuff introduced by
backports in release-2_8 until we do a point release after two weeks.  After
that backporting can continue.

If somebody discovers a commit which is worth backporting tomorrow he
can do so without postponing 2.8.3 and without the risk of forgetting
what he wanted to backport until the freeze is over.

Fair enough, no big deal.
And (accidental) backports during this time get reverted?
Any opinion concerning 2197? Will a deadline in 24h be good enough?

2197 doesn't apply to 2.8.

Pull requests can still be opened against the 2.8 branch, to avoid
the risk of forgetting (and at the same time to have travis also keep
an eye on the outcome).

The general opinion seems to point towards freeze and not branch.

Regarding this, I would propose to put the freeze in place as of

Tue, Jul 14, 12:00 UTC

And - presuming there are no regressions found - 2.8.3 will be tagged on
Tue, Jul, 28.

Kind regards,
Matthias

+1, but I'd avoid the word "freeze" as it may be confusing.

We're basically asking all developers to refrain from pushing more
backports in that branch until 2.8.3 is released.

I guess the "regression" exception should be better defined,
how about just requesting that any commit to the branch should be
first discussed on the mailing list, after it was prepared as a pull
request against the 2.8 branch ?

Oh, forgot to mention, we're also asking developers to _test_
the branch, or it would make no sense to wait another week, right ?
It might actually help to make an official call for testing on the
users list too. I'm sure many will be happy to test the next stable
release before it comes out (either from snapshot or directly from
git). I've submitted by "make Experimental" already.

+1 I planned to send a tweet tomorrow but any widespread call for
testing will be good (but mainly by power users and organizations who
actually use it. We cannot put that also on the developers back)

 resolution = 1 / ((1 / scale) * (inches / map unit) * dpi)

ie

resolution = 1 / ((1 / scale) * (100 / 2.54) * 90.7)

Is that right (for map unit = metre, and dpi = 90.7 [1])? 

Will this be correct only if the OL3 map's projection is in metres? Will I
have to change the unit if required to degrees etc?

Message-ID: <CAHb8Xey-885xdYie5OPYw=QrZS+wWK1ZfqQKpNYT_LDXPjA==g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am working with QGIS for the documentation on archaeological sites. QGIS
is an amazing tool for us, so we are really thankful to the community.
As we document as well vertical surfaces within their geographical and
archaeological context, I am wondering how such a capability might be
integrable within a QGIS application. I am thinking of polygons on the
horizontal plane which link to a file representing the vertical plane of
the surface.

What do you think about this? In what directions could I look for solutions?

Thanks a lot,
Anjo

Hi Heikki,
thanks for this, I'm going to check and publish it as soon as possible.
We are trying to avoid duplication as much as possible, both in QGIS
itself, and in plugins: have you thought of adding your work to
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MultiDistanceBuffer/ ?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Victor,

further tests:
* in several occasions the prj is apparently wrong, as you can see above
- it looks more of a qpj, and in any case it is not recognized by qgis;
I had the same also for a grass command (during the workshop, I could
not do more debug)
*
processing.runalg("gdalogr:contour","/tmp/processing/a06b812a38094eea8f21468a15731962/TARGETOUTGRID.sdat",0.001,"deaths","",None)
also returns a shp without prj (this seems a genuine bug).

Thanks.

Hi,
No idea?
Looking the composer manager code[0], it seems that any action, such as
deleting, duplicating or renaming a print composer, is processed through
interating over all print composers. No direct access. Am I right?
Is there no other way? An equivalent of mapLayersByName ?
If not, since print composers have now unique name, this will be a good
improvement, IMO.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map for blinds
Message-ID: <C731D2B0645743C8A9E9FC90895E93D2@Toshiba>

  Hi eweryone!

  I am not a developer but I have a question or the appeal to developers of qgis or qgis plugins.

  My name is Stefan and I am from Slovakia. I am a blind user of computer. I am using a screenreader which reads me a text from screen. So I cann work with texts, e-mail, webpages or sounds but no with pictures and maps. But I am interested in geography and for a long time I am searching some possibility how could the blind browse the maps. I would like to know how the world looks, which countryes are around my country etc. I think that the sole possibility for blind is a reverse geocoding when I types  some gps coordinates and the application or webservice returns me the information about locality. I used a Nominatim service for this point, and it was great to see which countryes are below my slovakia (when I step by step typed to Nominatim the 48,18 coordinates and then went to south by decrementing the latitude from 48 to 45, 40 to 0). But Nominatim  is not reliable source of informations because Nominatim has not implemented a seas and oceans as areas. So when I typed some coordinates for example on Adriatic sea, Nominatim returns the nearest city or country and the result was uncorrect for me.

  I am little programming in Delphi and I tried to parse an osm files (openstreetmaps). I cann read the informations about nodes or acquire all tags of nodes but I am not able to draw the areas which are in osm files represented as relations. 
  Now I found Qgis, I installed it and inported the osm file with map of my country (Slovakia) to Qgis. I am blind so I cann not work with wievs or graphs. But I would like create my own sqlite database  with informations about cityes and countryes as a map for me as blind. My idea is that I split the inported map  to little virtual squares by 0.01x0.01 and to each square add an information about country and city. Then will be very simple for me to browse a map with left right up and down arrowkey because when I will to increment or decrement latitude or longitude, the application will search the relevant square in database and tell me where I am on the map.
 
  Dear developers, please, it would be possible create some plugin for Qgis which browses the inported map from west to east and from north to south step by step and on each 0.01x0.01 square  detects inside  which polygons is this square situated? For example - I download from openstreet webpage the map of Slovakia, inport it to Qgis and run the plugin. The slovakia.osm file contains informations for rectangle 
 <bounds minlat="47.72" minlon="16.82" maxlat="49.62" maxlon="22.570"/>
  there are 190 lines and  575 columns it gives 
cca 110000 squares together. The plugin creates a sqlite database and writes the informations about each square to them. I dont need the addresses housenumbers or other points. Only countryes, cityes or other polygons are interesant for me. After this conversion I could browse the map in the simple application in which I could increment and decrement latitude and longitude by left right up and down arrow and the application could search in database the relevant information and tell me where I am. With so plugin I could convert more countryes and I could to have a special "map for blind".
  Please is this my idea very fantastic or would it possible to make?

 PS: I searched  also online reverse geocoding services for this point but the problem is that online services are limited and only my small country needs 110000 requests and if I wanted to process the whole of Europe, it would take a very long time. So I think that this task is better to do ofline at home.

     Thanks 

     Stefan

Hi Stefan!

Have you read about geonames? I think it could help in some ways to make a
QGIS plugin or standalone application. See here for more information about
geonames project (http://www.geonames.org/about.html). The geonames
database contains some useful informations regarding your needs: name,
latitude, longitude, and fcode (see here for the list of fcode
http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html). For example, fcode could be
ADM1 (first-order administrative division e.g a state or province), ADM2
(second-order administrative division e.g city). Having that informations,
what you can do is to:

   1. Download all countries geonames offline from here
   http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
   2. Convert the .txt files into sqlite database. The step 1 and step 2
   should be done outside of the apps (could be run as a background service as
   the geonames is also updated per day)
   3. Load the maps into QGIS, let the plugin divide the maps into set of
   squares, for each square query to geonames database to get all the rows
   that have latitude and longitude inside the square. The last part is to
   restructure the returned rows into useful information with the fcode
   (mapping the fcode into some useful informations - e.g what city or what
   state it is). And as some administrative boundaries could exist inside the
   square, it's possible to have more than 1 administrative region in a square
   though.

That is a really rough idea, I hope I get your idea correctly.

Regards

Hi,

At the hackfest in Nodebo, we talk about ftools plugin replacement by a 
customisable menu based on processing algorithms.

What about this now, is there somebody working on this ? is it started ? 
is it about to be finished ?

If we get some budget for this, is it still time to participate.

Hi,

In processing algorithms, parameters names are translatable (and 
completely translated in french),
but algorithm names and groups couldn't be translated because processing 
commandline interface use them in english.
On the other side, it would be good for users to get algorithm names 
translated inside toolbox.

Has someone begin to work on this or an idea about how to get names 
translated inside toolbox.

Maybe we could help on this ?

Best regards

Arnaud

I added a mechanism for defining alternative names for algorithms.
This allows to provide more informative names than the original ones,
without having to break the cmd interface.

The name replacements are stored in this file:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/algnames.txt

If the algorithm is listed there, the alternative name is use.
Otherwise, the original name is used.

Maybe we could have several files like that (algnames_fr.txt,
algnames_es.txt, etc), and just use the one corresponding to the
current language. That would be a very easy solution to implement and
very practical for all translators. It's differnet from how
translation is done now, but I think it will be better for Processing,
to be able to rename algorithms without changing their commandline
name

Let me know what you think about this

Cheers

Thanks for your reponse,

This is functionnal but seems difficult to maintain.
How to verify that every algorithm is translated in each language ?

Why don't add in each algorithm a "title" property

     self.name = '...'             # used by command line
     self.title = self.tr('...')     # used by toolbox

eventually with a fallback on self.name for compatibility with
algorithms from external plugins.
Like this we could use the normal workflow with transifex.

Does the groups have another use than toobox item text ? can we replace :
     self.group = '...'
by
     self.group = self.tr('...')

No need to do that

There is a name property for algorithms (used by the toolbox, not the
cmd line), and then there is the getCommandLineName() method, (which
is used by the command line). The problem here is that, by default,
the getCommandLineName method returns a name that is derived from the
alg name. It is easy to fix that, just override that method for all
algorithms. The problem is that "all" algorithms means hundreds of
them...

It's something that should have been done from the beginning, but I
just assumed that it was a good idea to rely on the base
implementation which uses the human-readable name for the cmd line
name, so there was no need to implement that method ofr every
algorithm, saving some work. Lazy me...

So, in short, the code actually supports what you propose...but
algorithms do not use it,

Let me know if you have questions

Hi all,

this topic was raised previously and problem is a bit more complex
then just using self.tr() for algorithm name and group. Such approach
will work only for very limited amount of algorithms with pure-Python
implementation.

But what to do with algorithms, defined via description files? In this
case algorithm name and group written in description files and use
English. Seems we need something more advanced then just
overriding getCommandLineName().

If we make files algnames_<locale>.txt
=> translators would have to make pull request for each language to 
translate the name of a new algorithms.
=> It should be difficult to identify not translated names, to update 
text files.

Like alex says: self.tr() method is only applicable to pure-python 
algorithms

So my proposition is to create a python script that generate a temporary 
python file which calls translate() with all names and groups (iterating 
over providers and algorithms).
This file could be parsed normally by pylupdate
And we could call translate at runtime to get displayNames for the toolbox
External plugins algorithms will be added to translations (depending on 
plugins installed when running update_ts.sh), but this not seems to be 
blocker.

With simplified interface definition file: algclassification.txt
algorithms not present in this text file do not display in simplified 
interface
if we made one text file for each language, this would cause simplified 
interface to display different algorithms for each language.
This text file can eventually be translated in python to be parsed by 
pylupdate

I've made a pull request here : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2213

With the strategy to produce a python file which calls 
QCoreApplication.translate with each string (names, groups).

Could you give me a feedback about this.

Best regards

Arnaud

I wonder know if it's possible, and if it's possible can you please let me
know some ressources and examples.

Thank you a lot

Did you try the DBManager plugin ?
It does allow you to run arbitrary PostGIS queries and load the
results as layers. How about improving that one ? It's a core plugin.

Hi Marcus,

>From your report, it looks like maybe you have assigned a custom font
(maybe in the Python Console settings?) to be used by one of QGIS's
built-in editors (or one utilized by a plugin) that is based off of
QScintilla2; and, the font you have chosen is either corrupt or otherwise
causing problems. I don't see any clear indication of whether the original
calling code is C++ or Python.

If you have not set a custom font, and it is the default Qt font that has
issues, then that is a problem.

As a start, you may wish to use Font Book to review your installed fonts
and fix any issues. Also, it would be good for you to post particulars
about your QGIS version, install method, etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Label polygons only outside of polygons
Message-ID: <55ABA2A3.5020801@carto.net>

Hi,

I see that there are some recent new features regarding labelling:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/388e4047a75d155be0e677866f80d7423937ea30
and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/3a44e294de08ee03c0386179693c61a3f76e5efe

I have a question regarding Nyalls recent labelling improvements (the 
new options to act as obstacle layers).
For a polygon layer, would it be possible to force the labels to always 
label outside of the feature? As an example I have a waste-water layer 
with small polygons representing special-form manholes (irregularly 
shaped). These polygons are usually too small to properly display the 
label inside the polygon and I would prefer to automatically place the 
label fully outside of the polygon.

So, can I have a layer act both, as a label layer and as an obstacle 
layer? Or have another option, something like "Force label to be outside 
of the polygon", to label always outside of the polygon of the feature?

Here are two screenshots:

This is how QGIS currently labels these polygons:
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/qgis_label_over_polygon.pdf

And this is how I would label them manually, outside of the polygon, but 
hope that a future QGIS version can do this automatically:
http://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/manual_label_outside_polygon.pdf

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Different label distances for point feature
	labelling
Message-ID: <55ABA67C.4020007@carto.net>

Hi,

I have another label question:

For labeling point features when using the "Around point" placement 
option, I noticed that I would need different label distances depending 
on the position the automatic labelling engine uses. As an example, 
while the label distance is ok for a "top-right" position, it would have 
to be bigger for a "right" position, as the label is still too close to 
the point symbol in this case. The top-middle and bottom-middle 
positions would also need yet another label distance.

Would it be possible to add position-dependent label offsets in the 
future while still letting QGIS place the labels automatically?

Thanks,
Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Point feature labels: add a "buffer" option around
	point features
Message-ID: <55ABA7FE.5000209@carto.net>

Hi,

I have yet another label question: would it be possible to add a 
"buffer" option around labels to avoid overlapping of labels with point 
features, like shown in the attached file: the last "f" of 
"N?nikon/Bahnhof" overlaps with the point feature of "N?nikon/Volg".

I had the option "Discourage Labels from Covering Features" on, but it 
probably only takes the point into account and no buffer around the 
point, so it still overlaps with the point symbol. In this case I would 
have manually placed the label of "N?nikon Bahnhof" to the left of the 
point feature.

Or maybe the label distance could automatically be applied to act as the 
buffer distance for the "Discourage labels from covering features" test?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,
Andreas

An option to put always a label outside from a polygon seem a good 
solution only when all the polygon are quite similar size (all small).
Perhaps a better choice could be to have a label outside from a Polygon 
only when it is could not be all inside it ?

Andrea Peri.

Sorry for my english.
I would mean

Perhaps a better choice could be to have a label outside from a Polygon 
only when it is could not be COMPLETELY CONTAINS ON it.

Correct... It only considers a zero size point as the obstacle and doesn't
account for the size of the marker.

I guess the ideal solution would be if the actual marker's bounding box is
considered to be the obstacle.

It's possible (and not too complex for single symbol renderers), but would
be a bit of work to make it handle the other renderer types without
affecting speed.

Great work!

Just one suggestion. The run iterative mode is not urgent, since it is
not often used, and it's nothing but a batch process, so I would
recommend not working on that, leaving that for later, once the single
execution is working fine. That should be the priority.

I will test your code later today and let you know what i see.

Thanks!

Hi Andrea, 

There is now a new option that only draws the label if it fully fits
inside the polygon: see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/dc4049ddff09cc1b324dd95f48df29abef92f90e
[6] 

so - this is part of the solution of what you want. 

In my case I always want the label to be outside of the polygon,
although in some rare cases the label may fit inside the polygon (when
zoomed a lot). 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Everything is possible, it's just a matter of how difficult it is ;)
It's a very valid use case though.

I think a good solution would be adding an option to allow labels for
polygons within a certain distance of the feature, used in conjunction
with the new option to prevent labels which fall over the border of
the feature. I think this option would make most sense if it was
accompanied by the ability to draw leader lines to features. They
should probably be tackled together.

I'm almost finished with this current round of labelling work (it's
being done to facilitate a project I'm working on), but there's talk
of more labelling work being done later in the year. Maybe this could
be part of that.

I've hit this recently too, but I'm not sure what the best solution
is. There's a few complications. The biggest is that the "around
point" mode actually places candidates in a circular radius around
point features. By default QGIS is set to use 8 candidates for point
features, so the result is that labels are placed in the 8 quadrants
around points (above, top right, right, bottom right, etc...). But if
someone has bumped up the number of candidates, then the labels will
no longer fall on these quadrants and instead be placed at say 10
degrees, 20 degrees, etc. In this case the position dependant
distances become much more complicated.

I've been thinking about changing how "around point" works to
basically hard-code in the 8 candidates, so that labels will ALWAYS
fall on the 8 corner/mid points. I'm not sure how many people would be
negatively affected by this (ie, how many people intentionally change
the number of candidates), but there's a number of benefits which
would arise. One would be that we could prioritise certain placements
- eg, following this [1] kind of priority for placements. This could
even be configurable by the user. Another benefit would be that we
could tweak the relative distances for each placement too.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Hi Nyall, 

I would be fine with limiting to the 8 "well-known" positions, with the
priorities mentioned at
http://www.svgopen.org/2002/papers/dahinden__good_map_graphics/labeling.png
[2] set as default and different distances depending on the position -
perhaps with a good default distance for each position, so normal users
wouldn't have to tweak these values and still receive good out of the
box results. 

I wasn't aware that I can bump up the candidates and I doubt this is in
much use out in the wild. 

Thanks,
Andreas

Thanks Victor!

Ok, I?ll do it later then. 
Maybe I?ll focus on a temporary fix I did in the multithread implementation. What do you suggest?

You may have noticed that I have a sleep after starting the worker thread. 
Without this sleep the QGIS crashes due to a segfault. I believe that the worker thread is trying to access something in the processing that no longer exists when the main thread leaves the processing. I can?t see exactly where it crashes because it is not easy to debug with multiple threads using Eclipse. I tried to use pyCharm but I was not able to configure the remote debugging.
It can take some time to figure out what is happening here.

Let me know if everything is ok with the single execution.

Cheers,
Marcus

Hi,
I'm new to this list, so I don't know if this is the right place to post my issue.... Sorry for that.

However, my problem is about running processing algorithm directly from a python script.
I'm using QGis 2.8 under Windows 7, and python correctly installed under Qgis directory.

This is the problem: if I run a GRASS algorithm using the GUI, everything is ok.
The same algorithm, with the same source input file and applying the same parameters... it fails when called by processing through a (very simple!) Python script.

Now, after several tests, I'm also using the point shape file embedded under processing/test folder (just to be sure of integrity of input file).
If you see below, I'm also looking at processing.log, and what is surprising is that logs seem exactly the same !!!

I post below the short code I'm using and the log file I got.
Again, I remark that the algorithm run from GUI is perfectly working :-0

Any help or suggestion?

Thank you so much in advance.

Iacopo

What do you mean by "it fails"? do you see any error? or it just
doesn't add any layer to your QGIS project?

You have to use Processing.runandload if you want that. Otherwise, the
runalg method returns a dictionary in which keys are output names, and
values are ouput paths where your outputs have been generated, and you
have to load them manually into QGIS

Hope this helps

Hi,

actually both:
(a) Using the example I've cited in my post, I've got no error, but checking the raster output file returns "no valid raster layer". If you see at the end of my code I try to load the output raster and it fails.
That's why running Processing.runandloag, as you mentioned, the process fails and I got an error, accordingly.

(b) On the other hand, with other point shape files, actually I got a raster made by only 1 row and 2 columns, placed with its corner (lower left) at the origin, namely coordinates = (0,0). That's why I was assuming that problems arise from projection or something similar.... and this is the reason I'm trying with different source files, without success, unfortunately.
 
What is strange is that the logs seem really equivalent !!

Thanks for any help/idea you could suggest me. 
 Cheers
Iacopo

Iacopo

What do you mean by "it fails"? do you see any error? or it just doesn't add any layer to your QGIS project?

You have to use Processing.runandload if you want that. Otherwise, the runalg method returns a dictionary in which keys are output names, and values are ouput paths where your outputs have been generated, and you have to load them manually into QGIS

Hope this helps

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1Oc76WnC44gnnRcvDSDS58U7o-Wjm9npDYYLFnpRfWneig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to compile QGIS 2.10.1 with GRASS support, but `cmake`
cannot find GRASS7 even I provide variables below:

            -D WITH_GRASS=ON \
            -D GRASS_PREFIX=/opt/src/grass70_release/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/
\

GRASS is locally compiled in:

ls /opt/src/grass70_release/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/
AUTHORS  CHANGES           contributors_extra.csv  demolocation
driver  fonts    grass70.tmp  include  locale             scripts
tools                    translators.csv
bin      contributors.csv  COPYING                 docs          etc
  GPL.TXT  gui          lib      REQUIREMENTS.html  share
translation_status.json

Where could be a problem? Thanks in advance, Martin

Dear Sandro,

I am working on extending db_manager plugin to query POSTGIS 2.0 data. But I
am facing problem in initGui(self) function of db_manager python plugin.

Application is giving error at this line of code.

self.action = QAction( QIcon(":/db_manager/icon"),
QApplication.translate("DBManagerPlugin","DB Manager"),
self.iface.mainWindow() )

I think error is in QIcon(":/db_manager/icon") because I think this is not
complete path of the icon file. But I found that this plugin is working in
QGIS setup application. I don't understand how it is working even though
path is not correct.

Can you help me in resolving this issue.

Thanks,
Azghar

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 2.10 'Pisa'
Message-ID: <20150722062124.GA5359@norbit.de>

QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.

We are very pleased to announce the release of QGIS 2.10 'Pisa'. Pisa was the
host city to our developer meet up in March 2010.

Latest Release

This is another release following our four monthly schedule.  It again brings
many nice new features to QGIS.  With the release of 2.10 the previous release
2.8 'Wien', which is designated a long term release (LTR) is moved to the long
term package repositories and is the first to arrive there.  If you are working
in a production environment where you wish to be more conservative about
rolling out new features to your users, you will probably prefer those.  Of
course going with the feature frozen LTR also means that you'll have to learn
to do without all the nice new things introduced in 2.10 and above until the
next long term is released next year.


New Features in QGIS 2.10 'Pisa'

QGIS 2.10 includes many great new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the
most popular Free desktop GIS even more feature filled and useful.  Visit the
visual changelog that highlights some of the new additions
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog210/index.html).

Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org).

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page: http://qgis.org.  More
packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.


Thanks

We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many
folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).

From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate
time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please
wander along to qgis.org and lend a hand!

Finally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable
financial support they provide to this project:

Sponsoring QGIS helps us to fund our six monthly developer meetings, maintain
project infrastructure and fund bug fixing efforts.

QGIS is Free software and you are under no obligation to pay anything to use it
- in fact we want to encourage people far and wide to use it regardless of what
your financial or social status is - we believe empowering people with spatial
decision making tools will result in a better society for all of humanity.

Happy QGISing!

Regards,

The QGIS Team!

Hi 

I just read in the changelog that there is some postgis pointcloud layers support? What does this mean? Can I load e.g. the patches as polygon into QGIS?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Discussion: could Ice be used in Qgis ?
Message-ID: <55AF65EB.8060608@cnes.fr>

Hi Qgis developers,

I wrote a small library called Ice which is able to render raster (and 
vector) data pretty fast with all sort of cool effects. It is a 
rendering engine which only depends on otb, opengl and glew. It does not 
depend on a specific graphical toolkit, and does not even come with its 
own OpenGl context. You can see it in action here [1] (the viewer you 
see in the video is actually ice demo viewer, based on glfw). Source 
code is available here [2].

The reason why I am writing to this list is that I presented a poster 
[3] and a demo of this library at foss4g europe last week, and Paolo 
Cavallini told me it could be of interest for Qgis, either to replace 
the current rendering engine (that is actually what we did for our own 
qt-based desktop software in OTB suite), or to provide an alternate 
viewer. Therefore, following his advice, I bring this to your wise 
attention.

Here is a quick pros and cons analysis (based on my user experience with 
qgis and my knowledge of ice).

Pros:
- It can handle multiple layer with on-the-fly reprojection
- It is quite fast to browse and navigate into raster data
- It allows for really responsive user interactions (like constrast 
editing operations for instance),
- It has some fun and responsive tools for in-dept dissection of raster data
- It is meant to be embedded in other software
- The code is quite compact : only a few classes

Cons:
- It is not as rich as Qgis current rendering modes (especially on the 
vector side, but on the raster side too) : no LUT, no labels ... And I 
am not sure it could be enriched with all these.
- It heavily relies on OpenGl and GLSL capabilities, and does not work 
well with remote desktop (ssh -X or other techniques),
- It comes with few dependencies, but OTB is a pretty big one still,
- It has only a few contributors (me and 2 or 3 other persons). On the 
other hand, I do not know how many Qgis developers can contribute to its 
rendering engine. This would make rendering engine a joint effort ...

This is only a FYI notice, not shameless advertisement : feel free to do 
wathever you think is best with it (including discarding this email and 
never talk about it again). But if you think this is interesting and 
want to discuss this in further details, I would be happy to do so.

I'd really like to backport c8dcf97 (critical for 2.8.3 IMO) and
a1a8d1b (nice to have for 2.8.3), but don't want to reset the
countdown now. Is there anyway around this?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Borrowing QGIS plugin architecture for another
	application
Message-ID: <CAJnipd7HzWTg9mhGpYoQbMGtWH=k68S3gHB79UV2SKAB-i36FA@mail.gmail.com>

I apologize for the mostly off-topic nature of this, but I wasn't sure
where else to ask my question.

I'm thinking of borrowing the QGIS plugin architecture for an
application that I'm working on, particularly the parts that provide
for creating Python plugins. I use QGIS off and on for both hobby and
work use and from a user side I'm very pleased with the way plugins
work, but was curious if any of the developers had words of advice.
The plugin system seems largely unchanged for many years, so perhaps
there are some elements of the design that haven't changed in order to
limit API changes.

The only major limitation I can find so far is that plugin interdependency
doesn't seem to be supported, such that plugins cannot extend other
plugins. Of course I'm sure this could be done between Python plugins
easily, but I don't see any facility for this on the C++ side.

For the curious, this is for a video capture and analysis application
that is primarily intended to support the measurement of camera
properties. The core uses GStreamer for capture from many different
devices, Qt throughout, QPluginLoader for plugins, and several plugins
that use OpenCV as well as compiled MATLAB. I've released some
portions as open source, with the rest to come eventually.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

Hi all,
I have seen ti in action during the recent FOSS4G, and I have been
really impressed by its speed and capabilities. I think it would be a
grat addition to QGIS, as either a main or alternative renderer.
All the best.

Hi,

I recently installed QGIS via OSGeo4W on a new machine and noticed that the
core database manager plugin does not list Spatialite connections due to
the lack of pyspatialite. Imho, this library should be installed by default
when QGIS is selected. I've opened a ticket for this on the OSGeo4W bug
tracker:

https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/470#ticket

Best wishes,

As nice as the idea is, I think it will be quite a massive undertaking and we would break all the beautiful (ok and ugly) cartography that people have come up with using the rich array of rendering styles that QGIS currently has.  I would also like to see a native OpenGL renderer one day so that we can start to thing about native 3D support. Maybe it would be nice to make a patch that lets you swap between Qt rendering backend and Ice, but honestly its probably a lot of work and may just fade away like the old mapnick renderer did?

I agree.
To go toward OpenGL and then 3D support, we may start by finding a way
to send 2D draw primitives to an OpenGL context. This way we would have
all the current QGIS symbology support and it will be transparent for
the end user.
I may be wrong, but I think it will cost less than trying to integrate
another library (like Ice).

The idea I have in mind for going towards OpenGL is to first send all
layers as rasterized images to it, so the only thing that OpenGL needs
to do is resize/translation for interactive zooming/panning and blending.

Then we could start to implement certain (simple) renderers directly in
OpenGL. This way we would still have the full-blown symbology for
complex layers and an increased UX while navigating with e.g. district
boundaries with simple symbology but rendered as vectors on the GPU from
a local cache.

I am not sure how much effort it would be to do that with Ice.
It looks amazing but I assume it was not developed with QGIS styling,
iterator and the rest of the QGIS API in mind. I imagine it will be
quite hard to re-wire all the internals of the two applications/libs to
play together nicely.

Kind regards
Matthias

Is it not the usecase covered by Qt3D 2.0 ?

Hi,
it seems that my problem was in the GRASS algorithm I was using. Now, I've moved to GDAL algorithm named "Grid - InverseDistance To a Power" and it works. Really, I don't know what was wrong: my only suspect is that after running grass algorithm I would need to "convert" the grass raster map created to a "readble" raster, to be loaded in QGis correctly. I realized such a guess after reading the processing log file and comparing the log obtained by python-based run with the one obtained after launching the process by the GUI. But this is only a guess... hoping this could help somebody else playing with GRASS and processing.

Iacopo

What do you mean by "it fails"? do you see any error? or it just doesn't add any layer to your QGIS project?

You have to use Processing.runandload if you want that. Otherwise, the runalg method returns a dictionary in which keys are output names, and values are ouput paths where your outputs have been generated, and you have to load them manually into QGIS

Hope this helps

Hello,

I finally find the problem. It comes from the Tile Map Scale Level plugin where 
I checked the "Activate zoomlevels" parameter which constraint the zoom level.

thanks to all for your help :)

I tried to replicate / test etc. when working on the changeling, and couldn?t figure out how to make it do anything useful, get hold of a usable test dataset etc. Hopefully someone out there will write up a little tutorial or something.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Looping over features in processing
Message-ID: <EC2D0DD0-60F3-4B59-A065-F6A261475E86@qgis.org>

Hi all

Is it possible to write loops in processing. I?d like to do stuff like iterate over each poly in a polygon layer, clip features from a few layers and write them to a subfolder whose name is based on the name of the polygon layer. Think of it like atlas but for data not for print compositions. Has anyone done something similar?

Regards

Tim

Tim

What you are describing is the behaviour of the iterative execution of
algorithms (for a layer with n features, it runs the algorihtm n times,
each of them using as input a layer with only one of those features). That
can be executed without the need to code anything, from the algorithm
dialog.

If it's not exactly what you are looking for and you want to code something
similar, maybe you can at least check the corresponding code to get some
ideas

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/AlgorithmExecutor.py#L58

Let me know if you have more questions

Cheers

Yeah that sounds exactly like what I am after. I will go and take a look at that.

Thank you all for you replies.

Well I agree with all the comments made here : ice lacks a whole lot of 
things to replace Qgis rendering, and switching the rendering backend 
might be a very complex and time consuming task (that is almost the 1st 
thing I told Paolo). Moreover, Ice focuses on being efficient for 
rendering : that means a whole bunch or things are locked within Ice 
code (for instance, Ice takes care of reading data from the hard drive).

Still, if you are getting into pure OpenGl rendering someday, and 
looking for responsive features, Ice can be a good source of 
inspiration. it's not rocket science, just a few things to keep in mind 
(in addition to tile caching and multi-resolution) : let the GPU take 
care of everything it can, including all contrast changes and 
reprojection, and avoid heavy operations (like HDD to RAM or RAM to GPU 
transfert) whenever it is possible. I can maybe lend a hand in this 
perspective, if needed.

Regards,

Julien

I publish wms vis geoserver
and use qgis requeset data via C++
and the uri parameter set as behind


QString mUrl = "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms";


		QgsDataSourceURI uri;
		uri.setParam("url",mUrl);
		uri.setParam( "layers", "nurc:Img_Sample");
		//uri.setParam( "InvertAxisOrientation", "1" );
		uri.setParam( "maxWidth", "256" );
		uri.setParam( "maxHeight",  "256");
		uri.setParam( "styles", "" );

		uri.setParam( "IgnoreGetMapUrl", "1" );
		uri.setParam( "SRS","EPSG:4326");
		//uri.setParam( "crs","EPSG:4326");



I found that there is no tile and tilesorigin


How can I configure it and can get the tile.
thanks very much

Thank you for the hints. Please allow me one question here. I have
recently plaied with OpenGL for rendering and did let the GPU do CRS
transformation. I could not get it to work to my full satisfaction,
based on the fact that I only had float but no double precision.
Therefore e.g. CRS 21781 (in meters) already uses 6 figures for meters,
one more is still ok but when you zoom into cm resolution you start to
see the precision / rounding errors in rendering.
For reprojection I guess you had to also deal with precision of
coordinates. Did you use OpenGL features which are able to use double,
transform coordinates into an intermediate format before sending them to
the GPU or something totally different?

Matthias

Hi Devs,

I did some renaming in of toolbars and panels so they can are better
'distinguisable' in the context menu, see:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2180

Marginal errors, but from UIX standpoint valuable I think

the pr complains about a failing travis build, but looking into the
error I think that is an artefact, nothing to do with my edits

is it possible that a dev has a look into it?

Hello,

I am a bit hesitant to recommend inserting LiDAR point clouds into a
database (because I believe - for LiDAR or dense-matching points -- you
should just only insert the shapefile outlines into a database and then run
a las2las query on those spatially indexed (amd possibly resorted) LAS /
LAZ  files whose outlines overlap the queried area) as this has shown not
to be very performant in a large study by TU Delft involving many different
spatial databases ... but in some use cases it may make sense. The papers
and relevant discussions are linked here:

http://groups.google.com/d/topic/lastools/MoYPFzFVxa8/discussion
http://groups.google.com/d/topic/lastools/jkB1UK5DxN4/discussion

That said ... one case where it may make sense is when you insert once and
then look-up *a lot* in small batched. Something like what Yuriv Czoli from
developmentseed did will give you some pointers to get started:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Conflits between owsLib packages in OSGeo4w and
	QGIS
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Exiq4hJWrJ-EERQ+6xrQCtHCTby0_O5qwa2eFo-4amhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm working in a project that is creating a plugin for QGIS. The plugin is
a metadata editor for a specific INSPIRE profile, and it uses the OWSLib
package (currently 0.8.x I think).

OSWLib is now packed with QGIS, making it very convenient to use in
plugins. Yet, using the OSGeo4w installer the user can install another
version of OWSLib, but with another version (0.7.x). And in this case, our
plugin fail to open, because it tries to use the 0.7 version instead the
one packed inside QGIS.

Besides telling the user to uninstall the 0.7 version (the current
workaround), is there a way to make sure that the plugin use the currect
OSWLib version? Could someone point me to an example?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,
this is a known issue: the internal lib should be removed, and the
shared one used instead. The main dev is aware of this, probabkly he
just need a hand.
Could you perhaps give a hand?
All the best, and thanks.

Yet, the standalone version also needs to pack the library. And the linux
and mac packages also need to include the library.

I don't think I have enough skills to provide any valuable help in this
matter.

Hi Martin

From my point of view there is one big advantage of having LiDAR point clouds in a database: SQL (or probably more precise DML). No more system calls or different programs to solve a problem. Just pure SQL. One interface to rule them all: vector processing? SQL. Raster processing? SQL. Point cloud processing? SQL. Combining them all together? SQL.

I tested Paul Ramseys work [1] with our own data. It?s really great and comfortable to work with. But can?t say much about performance. I needed to work on a really slow fanless celeron pc with a slow harddrive.

Ah thanks, got it now. Any idea how I can write the output layers out with e.g.

<feature_name>_roads.shp
<feature_name>_buildings.shp

(I?m basically trying to iteratively loop through wards, clipping out all the roads and buildings for each ward to a file named on the ward name).

Also being able to put the date into the name would be great.

Unfortunately, there is not configuration for the output names, it just
uses the input name you enter for the output and add numbers as a suffix.

Being able to use an attribute value instead of numbers sounds to me like a
nice improvement, so if you can open a feature request, i will work on it
when i have some time.

Let me know if you have more ideas

Hi: thanks for the info.  I believe this has been discussed in the
past w.r.t. dependency management of Python plugins in QGIS, but there
is no definitive approach yet.  For OWSLib we currently have this
tracked via http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13058.

The OSGeo4W OWSLib is not maintained / up to date AFAIK.

Currently in master we can OWSLib and it's dependencies in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/ext-libs, which is not
ideal IMHO.

Not sure how to proceed here.  The best thing would be to remove all
OWSLib dependencies from the codebase and install during time of
building QGIS (pip/easy_install?), no matter what the platform, but
I'm not aware of the entire picture/build/package/release story.

Any suggestions on how best to handle this would be appreciated.

..Tom

Is it required as a buildtime dependency?

Assuming it is a runtime dependency

 * We can make sure it's installed by default with OSGeo4W
 * Add it as dependency to the proper linux package
 * You can check when you import it in your plugin
   and offer the user an information if he's missing
   a dependency but that should only happen in rare cases.

Currently there is no mechanism to auto-install packages from QGIS
(easy_install / pip) and having a proper solution that works
cross-platform will be a bigger undertaking.
And I don't think installing it build time will help because the build
machine is not necessarily the one which will later run the app.

What do you think?

No.  It's only required for metasearch - like all the other stuff in ext-libs -
except pyspatialite.

No, it's too old in osgeo4w.

It not available or not uptodate enough on all distributions.  That why we have
it in qgis.  That's also why osgeo4w is not uptodate - only qgis would require
it in osgeo4w.  And maintaining it in both would just duplicate the work.

Well as metasearch is a core plugin, qgis should ship  everything required (or
depend on stuff that is available everywhere).  That's why all the stuff was
added...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Label UI as dock widget
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg9TUk0ko8uhhBs6YFoHE1BsH7jg-m_HckGqjh0Jdy5wUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm looking for some feedback on this PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2219  The result is changing the labeling
UI to be a dock widget that will update for the selected layer in the
legend.

The code is a little messy and some of the UI needs clean up but if people
see merit in this style I will continue work on it.  Symbol stuff will be
next but that is a bit more work.

Having this stuff in model dialogs is super annoying as you have to open
and close them all the time when making changes, and non model dialogs mean
mico managing windows which is something else that is annoying.

So for this PR just adds a "dock mode" that hides/shows some stuff to make
it fit better.  Having said that it seems to fit quite well into the dock
without much work which is cool.

Regards,
Nathan

	algos
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fj--P8cLJves7JXTKpMYNd7vUPLT7TGmR=kpqBH9oo8SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a particular reason why the simplified interface does not list
GRASS algorithms?

Users again-and-again get confused by the different interfaces [1] and
cannot find the tools they are looking for.

Maybe more on-topic for the UX list:
What was the main intent of the simplified interface?
Does it actually achieve its goals?

Currently, I tend to think that the two interfaces cause more confusion
than they are worth.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hello everyone, 

This is the ninth report on my GSoC project [1].
I would like to invite all of you at the QGIS community to help by test the multithreading implementation. 
I believe it?s a better and faster way to detect issues if there are any. 
You can all find the code here [2] within the master branch.

Thank you all in advance,
Happy coding and have a good week everyone,

Thank you all for you replies.

Well I agree with all the comments made here : ice lacks a whole lot of 
things to replace Qgis rendering, and switching the rendering backend 
might be a very complex and time consuming task (that is almost the 1st 
thing I told Paolo). Moreover, Ice focuses on being efficient for 
rendering : that means a whole bunch or things are locked within Ice 
code (for instance, Ice takes care of reading data from the hard drive).

Still, if you are getting into pure OpenGl rendering someday, and 
looking for responsive features, Ice can be a good source of 
inspiration. it's not rocket science, just a few things to keep in mind 
(in addition to tile caching and multi-resolution) : let the GPU take 
care of everything it can, including all contrast changes and 
reprojection, and avoid heavy operations (like HDD to RAM or RAM to GPU 
transfert) whenever it is possible.

It looks simple, but took me a while and a few tries with Monteverdi 
previous rendering engines, which were not that good, to come up with 
and combine all these ideas.

Hi Matthias,

Sorry for the late reply. For now Ice does not do anything specific to 
prevent loss of precision of coordinates in rendering, so this is 
another stone in Ice garden. However, I think that a fairly simple 
workaround is to shift/scale coordinates before rendering (for instance 
according to the data bouding box), eventually even change shift/scale 
settings with respect to zoom level, so that to ensure a controlled 
precision of coordinates in rendering. An example of software doing this 
is CloudCompare, which is a very good points clouds visualization 
software. If you load a point cloud with large coordinates, it will warn 
you about possible precision loss and propose to shift/scale the 
coordinates.

Hope that helps,

Regards,

Julien

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Definition of Perimeter for polygons with holes
Message-ID: <55B73F6D.2000103@sourcepole.ch>

Hi

While working on QgsDistanceArea, I noticed the definition of perimeter 
in QGIS is not the same as in PostGIS. PostGIS returns the length of 
outer and inner rings, while QGIS expects the length of the outer ring only:

test_distancearea.py:

polygon = QgsGeometry.fromPolygon(
             [
                 [ QgsPoint(0,0), QgsPoint(3,0), QgsPoint(3,3), 
QgsPoint(0,3), QgsPoint(0,0) ],
                 [ QgsPoint(1,1), QgsPoint(2,1), QgsPoint(2,2), 
QgsPoint(1,2), QgsPoint(1,1) ],
             ]
         )

perimeter = da.measurePerimeter(polygon)
assert perimeter == 12, "Expected:\n%f\nGot:\n%f\n" % (12, perimeter)


Using the following in PostGis returns 16 (length of inner and outer rings):

SELECT ST_Perimeter( ST_GeomFromText( 'POLYGON(( 0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 
0),(1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))', -1 ) );

What is your opinion? Is it okay to change it in QGIS to also consider 
the length of inner rings or are there any strong arguments against that?


Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Lizmap - show table in one to many relationship
Message-ID: <1438076115087-5217320.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello everybody
I'm learning Lizmap and in general Webgis so my question could be trivial.
I must publish some layers in Lizmap that have many documents relative to a
single record.
Let's say an area has lots of papers about studies made on it.
My data are in postgis tables and I can make a table on "many" side with one
record for each document and an id connecting to the "one" side table.

Is there some easy way to open a table with all the "many" record for the
single feature clicked?
Directly by Lizmap or by a link that point to a table popup?

My setup is Lizmap 2.11 on debian server, qgis-server 2.8

Thanks

The spatialite transition completed last week and we now have SpatiaLite
4.3.0 in Debian testing/unstable (but they're still proposed updates for
Ubuntu wily).

https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/spatialite

With the spatialite_init() related changes from #12771 QGIS 2.8.3 and up
no longer use the deprecated method causing the segfault. Because 2.8.3
is still not out I've included those changes as a patch in the qgis
(2.8.2+dfsg-3) package in Debian.

We still need to start the GDAL 1.11.2 transition to get those
spatialite_init() related changes into Debian testing/unstable too.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] memory layer performance while adding many
	features?
Message-ID: <55B87B04.6040509@terglobo.nl>

Dear developers, ;)

A plugin of mine imports data from a gml file into a memory layer. Works 
fine for tiny gml files, but takes forever on huge ones. Sounds 
plausible maybe, but the relation is not linear.

So I did did some tests and found out that reading and parsing the gml 
and creating the features always goes at the same speed of about 400 
features a second (fps). But when adding these to my memory layer, the 
process slows down tremendously.

I output the fps for every 1000 features and it gave me this graph:

http://terglobo.nl/downloads/memory-layer-performance.png

At the end of the importing process I'm processing just 3 features per 
second.

Is this expected behaviour? Is a memory layer not meant for something 
like this? Or is this a bug?

In the source code I found that for every feature I add to a memory 
layer the index is updated. Could that be inefficient?

Hoping anyone can explain!

Regards,
Raymond

Hi Pietro,

This feature has landed in Lizmap master, but is not available for current
stable version. We are about to publish a 3.0 beta version to let users
test it and report possible bugs. If you want to try this new feature, you
need:

* last Lizmap Web Client ( master version, available for download on github)
* last Lizmap plugin ( master version, available in github too)
* Configure relations in QGIS for the layers you need
* Add you layers in the "Attribute layers" tab in Lizmap plugin (and
publish them as WFS). If you have "many yo many" relationships between
layers, such as bus lines <-> pivot table <->bus stops, you can check the
checkbox "pivot table" for the middle table.

Lizmap "master" is not going to change a lot until we release the 3.0 :
only small enhancements and debug. You can use it with confidence.

Regards
Micha?l

Hi,

Is there a particular reason why the simplified interface does not list GRASS algorithms?

Users again-and-again get confused by the different interfaces [1] and cannot find the tools they are looking for.

Maybe more on-topic for the UX list:
What was the main intent of the simplified interface?
Does it actually achieve its goals?

Currently, I tend to think that the two interfaces cause more confusion than they are worth.

Best wishes,
Anita

The idea of the simplified interface was to have an interface that was
more understandable for users with less experience, so you do not have
to know if the algorithm comes from GRASS, SAGA or whatever. That
might be useful for advanced users, but it is confusing for the rest
of them.

Also, if an algorithm is repeated in several backends, only one of
them is added to the simplified interface, eliminating the need to
select one of them (also confusing for users)

GRASS algorithms are not featured in the simplified interface since,
although they are wrapped as Processing algorithms and simplified as
much as possible, you still have to know something about GRASS and its
data structures to use them correctly and not get strange behaviour.
If you want to use a GRASS, algorithm, I am assuming you are an
advanced user, so you can go to the advanced interface.

These were my initial ideas, but if the simplified interface is
causing more confusion than good....I will be happy to take it away
(it will save us devs quite a bit of work...). However, IMHO, it is a
much better UI for most of user, but I would like to hear what people
think.

Thanks for your comments!

What about adding the "Simplified Geoalgorithms" to the advanced menu. Then we can both search, unfold menus and find all the other functions.
The Simplified menu is easy to use - but merge the two menus into one.

Message-ID: <1438174542455-5217548.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear All,

I have build QGIS 2.8.2 in Visual Studio 2008. But I am getting following
error. 

*Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "D:/QGIS/build/output/python\qgis\__init__.py", line 36, in 
    from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsGeometry
  File "D:/QGIS/build/output/python\qgis\core\__init__.py", line 3, in 
    from qgis._core import *
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (init_core)*

I am not able to understand why I am getting this error. Is this error in
the source code or did I miss anything in CMAKE-GUI window.

Can any one of you please help.

Thanks,
Azghar

?That makes sense. Maybe all it needs then is a way to communicate the user
that the algorithm they were searching for is only available in the
advanced interface. Some message along these lines could be displayed when
the user inputs the name of a GRASS algo in the search box of the
simplified interface.

That is if we decide that the simplified interface has value for certain
user groups.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using the QgsBrowserModel in Python
Message-ID: <55B8F634.5080401@oslandia.com>

Hi devs,

i'm trying to use the QgsBrowserModel in a Python plugin.
I need to get the URI from a selected Item in the QTreeView, i expected to have a QgsLayerItem returned by the dataItem() in order to get the uri() member but a QgsDataItem
is returned instead.
Given a QgsDataItem, is it possible to get the uri of my data source ?

Is this a bug due to the binding (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/feb3bee85837d707b1b10c14064fcb55364e282d/python/core/qgsbrowsermodel.sip) or i'm not in the right way ?

Here are the few steps to reproduce the problem in a console:

-------
from PyQt4.QtGui import QTreeView
tv = QTreeView(None)
m = QgsBrowserModel()
tv.setModel(m)
tv.show()
m.dataItem(tv.currentIndex())
--------
output is :
<qgis._core.QgsDataItem object at 0x7f6cb8bcca68>


QGIS version used : 2.8.2

regards.

Yes, that's what the support does.
It shows the bounding box of the patches.

I noticed 2.8.3 was tagged on July 28, as anticipated,
but did not see any announcement mail.
Is that waiting for some form of packaging ?

Also, were those two commits backported ?
There's no trace of those hashes in the history of 2.8 branch.

They were both backported to 2.8.3 (thanks J?rgen!). I assume the release
announcement is waiting on the packages being built and available for the
major platforms.

On a semi-related theme, we really need a core "QGIS update available"
plugin. I suspect there's a ton of users still on 2.8.0/.1/<2.8 just due to
not knowing there's a new version out. This could also be really handy for
tracking stats of users...

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Gg5X8SspYnrGkAFOR_VZ4nPfrjk3-XDO6vNjF9x7ZDrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to get information about all symbols of a layer. If the Layer is
a graduated, category or rule-based symbology, I have to iterate over the
renderer categories / ranges and Rules, to get to the symbol.

The thing is that I only want to retrieve the ones that have been enabled
for rendering. That is, the ones that are selected in the legend. But I
can't seem to find where that might be. Can someone point me on the right
direction?

Thnaks,

Alexandre Neto

If I am correct the spatial index is created only if you ask so (by
passing "index=yes"). Do you have the same results without spatial index ?

Good question ! :)
I don't know if there is one ideal definition of the perimeter of inner
rings. After all, we may decide to see the inner perimeter as a negative
one ... as it is for the area.
So, just a proposition: let the user decide what to do with the two
perimeters (outer and inner), adding an option to retrieve separately
the inner perimeter ?

Hi Denis,

The code is in the ImaerReader plugin in the qgis repo and in github:

https://github.com/opengeogroep/AERIUS-QGIS-plugins

I'm adding the features one by one.

Hi Hugo,

I'm not specifically adding an index. So if you are right, I'm not using 
that.

 From your code [0] , I would see 2 options:

* add features all at once on the provider using 
QgsVectorDataProvider::addFeatures (the method you currently use)

* work on the layer level rather than the provider, which I believe is 
the recommended way for plugins. Make the layer editable, and add 
features to the edit buffer and commit at once. Or maybe commit 1000 by 
1000.

I hope this helps.

Hi,
I have installed QGIS 2.10.1 on Windows 7 (64 bit).

When I use the Geoprocessing tool - Dissolve, Clip and Intersection

Dissolve and add Unique ID field ? All polygons that are unique are stored and all the rest are not are not created.

The problem is both in the vector menu and in the Processing toolbox.

Can anyone confirm ?

We need to be noisy about point releases, too?  It's all on github anyway.
Can't sales or marketing take care of that? ;)

Personally, I would not consider announcing a bugfix release as noise.
That said, if a sales & marketing dept exists, this is surely
something it should take care of :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] function similar to Excel VLOOKUP
Message-ID: <55BA052E.2050300@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
How could I implement something like vlookup in QGIS?

I have a shapefile with 2000 polygons and column 1 of its attribute 
table has a code value.

Using the code in this column 1, I need to look up which row of a CSV 
file has that code, and return column 2 of the CSV file.
This returned value must then be placed into a new column (say column 6) 
on the shapefile attribute table.
I could pre-add the new column to this shapefile, and then run the 
vlookup equivalent too, of course.

I tried this by opening the DBF file in Libreoffice calc, sorting the 
columns, adding the extra two columns of my lookup data, then ran 
vlookup and saved/closed the DBF file.

Once back in QGIS the attributes ended up being linked to the wrong 
polygons (probably because I sorted the DBF file outside of QGIS).

Thanks in advance,
Zoltan

Apparently, this is because QgsDataItem has nothing to convert to its
derived types in the Python bindings. I'll add a %ConvertToSubClassCode.

Thanks for the report

Hi,
I think combining getFeature and attribute functions should help u do that
in the field calculator, though I haven't used them on csv files.
Assuming col1 in your csv contains also the code you are looking for,
applying this expression on shapefile "col 6" in QGIS field calculator may
do the job:
attribute (getFeature ('mycsvfile', 'mycsv_col1', "myshape_col1"), 'col2')

Regards,
DelazJ

Thanks for that clarification.

My current workaround is to use the mimeData method and deserialize the item to obtain the URI :

Add to the steps above :

from qgis.core import QgsMimeDataUtils
uri_list = QgsMimeDataUtils.decodeUriList(m.mimeData([tv.currentIndex()]))
uri_list[0].uri

Awesome. Thank you.

I added the extra column to the shapefile attributes, joined the 
shapefile to the CSV file, and then updated the new column in my 
shapefile using:
attribute($currentfeature,'joinedcolumn')  (NOTE: single quotes for 
field name)

I'm sure I could have skipped the Join step and just used getfeature as 
suggested below, but I went the Join route anyway.

Big thanks,
Zoltan

I wanted to tell a user about next LTR but could not find such info
on the website. Could the roadmap be shown somewhere over there ?

The closest place I found is the "forusers" section:

  http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/index.html

There, there's access to the Changelog for all even releases from 2.0
to 2.10, but no visual indication about 2.8 being "special" (LTR).

Further seeking brought me here:

Could there maybe be a link from the release page to the road-map page ?

Hi Sandro,

note that in the intro of the visual changelog of 2.8 there is more info
about the LTR-proces:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog28/index.html

I added a link on the foruses index page:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/commit/dcec19a09f0a7f90d7df175244f69e0a6178caeb

About adding a links and text: pull requests are appreciated, you can
even fork the website repo and edit in Github.
For most pages it is clear which rst file to edit in Github as there is
a 'fixme'-link in the footer of each page.

In this case it is a little more complex, because this 'landing-page' is
not a rst page, but a html-template page:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/blob/master/themes/qgis-theme/forusers_index.html

to be found in the themes dir

IF you add it, be sure to use the right notation to make it
translatable: {{_('text here')}}

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yes, noticed, but you can't tell before entering the changelog page.

Thanks. Again, is there a way to "preview" changes ?

Nope. Edits in the RST pages are rendered in Github, but those html
templates are not.

So only way to check is the next day when the website is rebuild and
updated.

Or you rebuild it yourself, which (if you like Docker :-) ) is now even
easier... I have to add the instructions to the website/docs readme's
but the instructions are like here:

https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe-doc#docker-build-on-your-machine

Hi,
BTW, what's the meaning of TBD (in "TBD freeze begins", "TBD is released"
from
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#release-schedule
)?
Thanks.

Would it be any easy/useful to have a "staging" website to see changes
as they are pushed in a special branch ?

Thanks, I'll get to learn docker one day :)

I guess it means "To Be Defined", not knowing if it'll be 3.0 or 2.8.x
It wouldn't be bad to update that page as part of the release process.

You may be right, Sandro.Thanks.
Then, is it still undefined? If I may, it will be the next release.

Message-ID: <CA+DVeYCWJTOzm-DyC9ejUkm5FkLNTitaLtkiwYtBruZy6zBCqw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

Could someone point me at documentation on how the Python-bindings are
being implemented? Is it done in a generic way, so that we could have
bindings to other scripting runtimes?

Regards,
Rob Marjot

Python bindings in QGIS (and other QT-based software) are implemented with
SIP:

Thank you Alessandro. Plainly pointing out the use of SIP means that the
bindings are 100% generated, painlessly following any new developments in
the c++ code base?

Wandering around through the core code base, it seemed to me that part of
the implementation relies on Python and/or specifically enables Python?

Hoping for a more elaborate response. Much appreciated.

Cheers,
Rob
