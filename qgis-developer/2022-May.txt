Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bug report submission to Launchpad for Qgis 3.22,
 Ubuntu 22.04
Message-ID: <5b7f4cb2-5529-1455-2d7c-d0dc42f9600d@gmail.com>

Bug No. 1971082

Qgis 3.22 crashes when attempting to display file dialogs for various 
file operations.

This issue appears to be specific to Ubuntu 22.04 and cannot to date be 
reproduced on any other recent Ubuntu release.

Both of the Ubuntu official repository packages (3.22.4) and the LTR 
packages (3.22.5) from the Qgis repositories are implicated. However the 
process for the Ubuntu bug reporting process will refer to the Ubuntu 
official repository packages.

The issue does not occur when using the current flatpak stable release, 
3.24.2

Do you think this should also be reported in the Qgis bugs page?

Hi devs,
The "doctest" workflow in QGIS-Documentation repository is again broken. We
are getting a segmentation fault [0]. This might have begun at least 5 days
ago, only on master branch. The 3.22 doctest passes.
If someone can give it a look, it will be much appreciated. Thanks.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

I tried looking into it...

A normal local build is fine... (so in a VENV with the REQUIREMENTS.txt of QGIS-Website, calling "make html")
But that does not build the doc tests (the python code in the cookbook is tested in that)

Then  I tried on my local machine, what I see in the CI log:

make -f docker.mk doctest

and that fails with exact the same messages, except it looks like it crashes on random parts of the cookbook tests

@devs can anybody of you make something from the stacktrace?

SIP related?

Missing dependency?

Any hints appreciated

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Indexing & web sources
Message-ID: <CAOM0XWB3E6xAVNi=C+qLszB5HJft-DdcmYSdH0Y6v3axBgedEw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I've had a question regarding indexing before looking too deep into the
code for now.

As far as I understand we want to index all layers to provide a smooth
experience by frontloading the indexing. But for big layers and often web
vector layer that can be quite massive this can freeze qgis for a while and
use a lot of resource that are not needed.

Would it be possible to implement a 'dynamic' index for such layer, ie to
use only the data that is currently loaded and integrate any new data to
the index instead of having to process the whole world when unneeded?

Thanks,

Alex

Is the data hosted in database such as PostgreSQL?? Per my 
understanding, the whole world is indexed once and then web applications 
use indexes for fast lookup and selective loading. Please excuse my 
remark if it sounds absurd, I'm a newcomer to GIS realm.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Trapping Kyb/Mouse events during a QGIS geometry
 edit process
Message-ID: <0d8cb88c-608b-4073-dc32-37bb6066dc40@geograph.co.za>

Hi Devs,
I'm just looking for some pointers as where to start or keywords to 
google or recipes to follow (if any).

I'm looking to trap kyb/mouse events whilst in the middle of a geometry 
edit.
If a suitable event is trapped, then to run a subroutine and then return 
to the edit process by either handing the edit process the same event or 
generating another event for the edit routine to continue the geometry 
edit with.

So I suppose my question is, is where do I insert such kyb/mse event filter.

Any pointers would be welcome.

Thanks in advance,
Zoltan

OSGeo4W has Qt 5.12.3 with the KDE patch collection now, and a bunch of updated
reverse dependencies + GDAL 3.4.3 + GDAL 3.5.0 (gdal-dev) with (geo)parquet
include some additional dependencies and qgis-dev (3.25 Nightly) built against
it.

Sorry for the noise, I just messed up my python(s) on my system...

All fine here :-)

Just realized I can only do what I want to do in QGIS, ArcGIS won't do it.  Trying to load 25 KML files, merge and export as a single shapefile.  I can do everything I need to do in QGIS but one question, when you create a model in modelbuilder is there a way to persist the filepaths and filenames after initially running the model so that I don't have keep selecting the files, alternatively can I load the filepath+filenames from a config (text) file?

Hi Elliot,

persist in what kind of context? Maybe setting project variables (there 
is a tool for that) would be sufficient?

Cheers, Hannes

Hi,

if you run your model from the model builder (green "play" button) and 
not from the processing toolbox, your settings will be preserved (if you 
open the .model3 file with a text editor, watch out for 
'designerParameterValues').

Cheers,
Bj?rn

Message-ID: <BL0PR16MB25782E259FF67635C280A1E49BC59@BL0PR16MB2578.namprd16.prod.outlook.com>

Hello Devs:

        I would like to propose some changes/upgrades to the field calculator. Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.

        -- Primary/Major Changes --

        1. Make the Field Calculator window non-modal
                * This will allow 2-6 to become practical
                * Allows users to modify feature selections

        2. Add a dropdown to the top of the window to select a layer
                * Similar to the Layer Styling window (the floating & dock-able panel)
                * Limited to vector layers
                * Defaults to the currently selected layer (defaults to an empty option on top if not vector)

        3. Rename "Ok" button to "Apply" and rename "Cancel" button to "Close"
                * This allows users to keep the field calculator window opened for multiple edits
                * Use cases would be:
                        - Running the same or similar expression on multiple fields
                        - Assuming #2, running the same of similar expression on multiple layers
                        - Combination of the above 2

        4. Change the QGIS UI toolbar button for Field Calculator to a toggle button

        5. Add checkbox to show/hide fields that are hidden in the editor widget
                * Per the comment here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/0aa409b4c67fd5f0dbc31efb3b5314c3f36b19f1/src/gui/vector/qgsfieldcalculator.cpp#L507-L509
                * Allows showing/hiding fields that are hidden without having to change the editor widget settings
                * Useful for needing to reset or bulk-change label placements overrides (i.e. adding 90 degrees to all non-null label rotations)

        6. *Optional* Make the Field Calculator window a dock-able panel?
                * May make more sense for ultra-wide screens, or with the function and docs part hidden
                * Requires #4


        -- Secondary/Minor Changes --

        7. Make it more obvious when field calculator is running against a selection
                * I've been bitten by this when I didn't realize it was using a selection, or I forgot to select a few features
                * Maybe have this checkbox on the bottom close to the "Ok/Apply" button?


        I believe these changes will help advance QGIS more into the "Data Science" field with being able to work with the data table(s) more efficiently.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New plugin in QGIS. It would be possible ?
Message-ID: <CAO-L-Hubd3emzE4msf=DK2LGzbAmz2pDARzgdgNskM0mMWHCgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello how are you ?

My name is Leonardo Pimenta. I am military and student of Geoprocessing. I
started the study of this area in 2019, when to be done for Orienteering
Race using OCAD software. However, I migrated to the OPEN ORIENTEERING
MAPPER software as it is free software.

Through the mapping work for Orienteering Race on the computer, some
functions were performed in QGIS - georeferencing, raster images, level
curvature, among others. From there I got to know QGIS, and I saw that it
was much more than a simple mapping software. Much more than OCAD and OPEN
ORIENTEERING MAPPER.

Today I am doing a Post-Graduation in Geoprocessing of Pleasure in
Processing Data, Images in Making Maps and Evaluating, What Age and
Multifunctionality QGIS offers.
Continuing to make maps for Orienteering Race, of course... lol... Is too
good!!! We use large scales and this makes the map rich in detail. It's
very enjoyable!!! Is there a possibility that OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER will
be a QGIS plugin in the future? https://www.openorienteering.org/

It would be really good!!!

The OPEN ORIENTEING MAPPER itself comes with the features and ready-made
cores. Making Orienteering Race maps in QGIS would be great. We would just
use QGIS with the OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER plugin in QGIS.

I've contacted several developers, but no one has responded. The OPEN
ORIENTEERING MAPPER is on GITHUB too:
https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/releases/tag/v0.9.5

We thank you in advance, and the entire Orienteering Race mappers community
in the world also thank you.

Big hug!!!

Ol?, tudo bem ?

Meu nome ? Leonardo Pimenta. Sou militar e estudante de Geoprocessamento.
Iniciei o estudo dessa ?rea em 2019, quando comecei a fazer mapas para
Corrida de Orienta??o usando o software OCAD. Entretanto, migrei para o o
software OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER por ser um software gratuito.
Por meio do trabalho de mapeamento para Corrida de Orienta??o no
computador, algumas fun??es eram feitas no QGIS - georeferenciamento,
imagens rasters, curva de n?vel, dentre outras. A partir da? conheci o
QGIS, e vi que ele era muito mais que um simples software de mapeamento.
Muito mais al?m do OCAD e do que o OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER.
Hoje fa?o uma P?s-Gradua??o em Geoprocessamento por causa do prazer em
processar dados e imagens, em fazer mapas e an?lises, e pela
multifuncionalidade que o QGIS oferece.
Continuo fazendo mapas para Corrida de Orienta??o, ? claro... kkkk...
? bom demais !!!
Usamos escalas grandes e isso deixa o mapa rico em detalhes. ? muito
prazeroso !!!

Ser? que existe a possibilidade de futuramente o OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER
ser um plugin do QGIS ?
https://www.openorienteering.org/

Seria tudo de bom !!!

O pr?prio OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER j? vem com as fei??es e com suas
respectivas cores prontas. Fazer mapas de Corrida de Orienta??o no QGIS
seria o m?ximo. Usar?amos apenas o QGIS com o plugin do OPEN ORIENTEERING
MAPPER no QGIS.

J? entrei em contato com diversos desenvolvedores, mas ningu?m respondeu. O
OPEN ORIENTEERING MAPPER est? no GITHUB tamb?m:
https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper/releases/tag/v0.9.5

Desde j? agrade?o, e toda comunidade de mapeadores de Corrida de Orienta??o
no mundo tamb?m agradece.

Grande abra?o !!!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Attribute indexes for (Temporal) Memory layers
Message-ID: <31eb321e5ef1fff1690ecb039ed32d20@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

I need to create a temporal selection of a temporal memory layer (just 
7500 points).

Creating the selection takes 15 seconds, using:
point_layer.selectByExpression(temporal_filter, 
Qgis.SelectBehavior.SetSelection)

DEselecting the features after my function takes 22 seconds, using
point_layer.selectByExpression(temporal_filter, 
Qgis.SelectBehavior.RemoveFromSelection)

To me that seems a pretty long time for 7500 features, but I think there 
is no way to tell the layer/provider to put some kind of index on the 
QDateTime attributes, is it?

An alternative is to save the temporal layer to a gpkg, and create an 
index myself...

Mmm, tested, even without an index on it, it is milliseconds to 
(de)select in a gpkg..

Just wondering if I'm doing something wrong with the memory layer

Idea's?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok FYI my main issue was I got the layer connected to a 
'selectionChanged' signal...

THAT was wat making my selections so slow.

Got to it because a duplicate layer, or the loading the saved gpkg again 
the same selection was super fast...

Sorry for the noise

Paul is busy re-creating a new server (if we are talking about tests.qgis.org?)
We are discussing which server should actually serv the data...

Yes, exactly, the links point to tests.qgis.org, where data are
obsolete. So that's a known issue, thanks Richard for the update.

Ola Leonardo

The problem with your email is that it does not pose a specific question so
it is difficult for anyone to know how to respond. Maybe it would be good
to join the QGIS Portuguese mailing list who I believe also welcomes
Brazilian Portuguese speakers and you can discuss what you are trying to do
there more easily.

In-Reply-To: <f5903d7fe1a3db9a3076f4aae0d74a1c@carto.net>

Hi Andreas

I have seen this and looked into that some time ago. If I remember
correctly, sometimes the indexing algorithm when constructing the octree
decides to merge the more detailed "bucket" of points into the parent
"bucket" (that has bigger spacing), resulting in this kind of artifacts
where some buckets have higher resolution than expected. It happens when
the amount of points in the more detailed bucket would be too low, it's not
a bug :-) You should be able to avoid that if you lower the Maximum error
in the 2D renderer - by default this is 0.3mm, which should cause dense 2D
rendering of points until you reach the scale when the individual points
can be seen...

Regards
Martin

Try removing the quotes from the '8' parameter. Those quotes are
telling PostgreSQL to use the version of ST_Buffer taking buffer style
parameters, and there is no parameter named '8' (i would be 'quad_segs=8')

See https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFcu4uDf4bQ=m+Q8vb4vRrwz0JU_QTZsocXLu27z8Gxkxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

It seems like a PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/47887 that has been
merged recently  is now causing trouble in CI, making checks of new pull
requests to hang indefinitely.

>From what I understand, the PR updated fedora version from 34 to 36, yet in
Github configuration of required checks is that builds with version 34 are
still required, but now they are never triggered. It looks like QGIS repo
settings need to be adjusted to reflect that. Could somebody with admin
rights to the QGIS repo fix it please? :-)

It's just a bit unfortunate that this happened shortly before the feature
freeze, when there's a lot of action going on and blocking things. Maybe
even worth extending FF for a couple of days to make sure that all PRs that
were ready to go actually get merged?

I've tagged all the open feature PRs with "freeze exempt" for now (and
will do so for any opened today too). I'll remove that tag if they
don't get merge-ready within ~ 1 week.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Add algorithm to an existing provider?
Message-ID: <3537b920-6485-7562-a0ad-23542587bb1d@terglobo.nl>


Is there a way to add a processing algorithm to an existing provider 
using pyqgis?

I have 2 plugins and don't know if they are both installed (or which one 
will load first). The both contain processing algorithms and I want 
those to end up in the same group.

Documentation is a bit brief on this:

QgsProcessingProvider

Examples show to put the addAlgorithm() function(s) in the 
loadAlgorithms() function. Then calling

QgsApplication.processingRegistry().addProvider(provider)

adds the group (=provider?) and the algorithms are in it.



What I want to do is finding the provider if it exists already:

self.provider = QgsApplication.processingRegistry().providerById('test')
if self.provider is None:
     self.provider = RayProvider()

and then:

self.provider.addAlgorithm(TestAlgorithm2())

This doesn't work, neither when doing:

provider.refreshAlgorithms()
provider.load()
provider.loadAlgorithms()
...


I'm currently trial-and-errorring my way through this, but I hope 
someone has a hint. Even someone pointing at 2 plugins working like this 
would be very welcome!

Kind regards,
Raymond

Hi Raymond,

you need to ensure that your provider saves a python reference on your 
TestAlgorithm2() (which you probably already do).
After its set of algorithms has changed (i.e. refresh, addAlgorithm(s) 
etc.) it needs to emit the algorithmsLoaded signal.

Greetings,
Benjamin

Hi Benjamin, thanks for your reply.

I'm not sure how the provider should "save a reference on my algorithm". 
What do you mean?

Some things I tried:


self.provider = TestProvider()
QgsApplication.processingRegistry().addProvider(self.provider)

alg2 = TestAlgorithm2()
alg2.setProvider(self.provider) # Maybe this is "setting a reference??

self.provider.addAlgorithm(alg2)

# Now the provider shows the extra algorithms (but not in the GUI)
print(self.provider.algorithms())

# Attempts to get it in the GUI:
self.provider.refreshAlgorithms()
self.provider.loadAlgorithms()
self.provider.load()


Still no luck!

Regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Add algorithm to an existing provider?

Hi Raymond,

what is mean is something like:

class TestProvider():

    def __init__(...):

       ...
       self.mMyAlgorithms=[]

    def addAlgorithm(a):

       super().addAlgorithm(a)
       self.mMyAlgorithms.append(a)  # <-- keep a python reference
       self.algorithmsLoaded.emit()  # <-- required to inform others, 
e.g. the model builder

With the python reference the TestAlgorithm instance should stay alive 
as long as the TestProvider exists.

Note that each time self.algorithmsLoaded.emit() other models, e.g. the 
QgsProcessingToolboxProxyModel, might want to reload all algorithms from 
all providers.
If your provider is used to add or remove multiple algorithms more 
frequently, it is good to emit algorithmsLoaded only once after all 
algorithms have been added/removed.

Greetings,
Benjamin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] attribute table cuts vell values after 32767
 characters
Message-ID: <6b7b0684a4ee4737999d98f3c237a744@bfs.de>

Hi,

A QString QgsField of unlimited length can store long text (in my case > 300.000 characters). When viewing the attribute table, no matter if using a tabular view or a form view, only a maximum of 32767 characters are visualized. If you copy the value of such a table cell or try to append text at its end, only the first 32767 characters are copied and you cannot go any further with the text cursor to edit the value.
Is this a bug (shall I file a bug)? Can it be fixed or is this a Qt5 limitation (I don?t hope so)?

Regards
Marco

Reading that page I still don't undertand how to tell if what I'm
running is a "supported version". Isn't it too much burden on the bug
reporter shoulder to figure that out ? Why isn't enough to just
ask for the actual version ?

Changed "current releases" to "currently supported releases" and added a link
on the bug reporting page to the roadmap
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/commit/46886162332431a8ccb4ed269deedee44046c6a5)

The user should verify that an issue is present in a current release or master.
That is the latest LTR and the latest release (and the previous LTR, if the
latest LTR is the latest release). Issues about older releases should not be
filed.

Hi!

It would be great if the link would point directly to the green and blue 
lines in the table. By itself the page is completely overwhelming for 
normal users.

Cheers,
Hannes

Right, that's what I'm saying. Even now that you mention green and
blue lines (which are not mentioned in the template) I'm still not
sure whether a release would be supported or not.

On https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html
the current green line says "3.24.2 and 3.22.6" while the blue one
says "3.24.3 3.22.7" but what does that mean ? Are those the 4
supported releases ?

Will this set (other than master branch) be all in green ?
I'm looking for a way to make it easier for the user to verify what
we're asking to verify. The current wording in the template is:

  "Each month, there is a new release of QGIS. According to the release
  schedule, you should at least be running a supported QGIS version."

Does that mean we want the user to check the checkbox (at the moment)
ONLY if they are running 3.24.2 or 3.22.6 (or "master") ?

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/10_bug_report.yml

If "master" is supported, should also the current branch associated
to latest LTR be considered one of the the "currently supported release" ?

Hi,
well...
For your information, I disabled the doctest github action
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/actions/workflows/doctest.yml>,
to stop getting annoyed by (unrelated) failure messages for each
interaction with the repository.
That also means no more checks for the PyQGIS Cookbook changes (which
includes this recent pull request
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/7559>), until we get a fix.

Greetings,
Harrissou

Hi,

I cannot make promises, but if I'm allowed to spend the paid bugfixing
hours to fix this I think I could have a look.

Cheers

+1 to spend paid bugfixing hours on testing framework, if my vote
counts anything. Testing continues being the bottleneck to contributions,
IMHO.

Hi Alessandro,

Fine with me - if you spend some dev hours on fixing this.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] printing information from tests to show in CI ?
Message-ID: <Yo5u4xS30F9IAk87@c19>

While working on a test fixture to keep an eye on source tree
modification I noticed that the test I wrote to do so is skipped.

I know this happens because I made the test "skip" when `git`
is not functional for some reason, but I'm not getting any message
printed on CI so I can't tell exactly what's the reason.

Is there a way for tests to make some messages bubble up to the
CI output, to your knowledge ?

Hi Tyler, since I haven't seen anyone else respond I have a few
questions/comments/suggestions.

What OS are you using? It looks like windows based on the file paths. since
sklearn has dependencies that require C bindings, you might have a much
easier time doing your work in either a linux environment (WSL might be
your easiest option), or using Anaconda.

How are you installing sklearn? I don't believe conda is compatible with
the way QGIS uses python, maybe others on the list will correct me about
that.

Possibly the most helpful thing I can suggest is not even bothering to try
to install anything for python on windows with pip, it works for some of
the basic libraries but most of the spatial libraries and probably the
machine learning type stuff end up requiring wheel files that are just very
difficult to get set up correctly.

You might consider asking in a sklearn forum as this seems like more of a
problem with sklearn than with qgis.

Hugh,
I installed it all through the OSGeo4W installer, sklearn seems to install
by default; when I run help("modules") in QGIS pyconsole I get sklearn
returned in the list. Since I didn't install this myself I can only assume
it installed with the OSGeo4W installer. That said, when i updated my
installation sklearn seems to work. From QGIS pyconsole and Pycharm I can
run
import qgis, osgeo, sklearn
from sklearn import cluster, metrics
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
print('Qapla')
and the output prints 'Qapla'
I am assuming it is working now, not sure how much of the import is
necessary, I know when using Pycharm to use the geopandas from the OSGeo
installer I have to import qgis and qgis processing before import geopandas
as gp will work; or something to that effect.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Deepforest tree crown detection
Message-ID: <CAO1MNmXRps2TpbGjnT1WakqFhzs33JLzKpFVkMrwKrZ+9_0Jyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
DeepForest is a python package for predicting individual tree crowns from
RGB imagery. Source code is available here: (
https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest.git).
DeepForest uses deep learning object detection networks to predict bounding
boxes corresponding to individual trees in RGB imagery. DeepForest is built
on the retinanet model from the torchvision package and designed to make
training models for tree detection simpler.
The above I cut from the docs of Deepforest.
My query is, would it be possible to build a QGIS interface to this
package, like for instance for FUSION for lidar data processing?

Regards, Mats.E

sure, it should not be a big deal. there are several examples of
interfaces with external programs.

Message-ID: <CANfsH32js=OT8icQvOA5CjWqPYc=YbeeA6KWXDC38PjZP2_BjQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have a R script that I am trying to build into a processing tool. The
tool requires first to login to a database server and the script grabs
data. In the script editor I am using
##oracle.username=string
##oracle.password=string
To capture user inputs to pass to the script for the login. When I put
those inputs into the processing tool it generally works but I can see what
is entered into the password box. How do I get it to hide that password
with *****? Is it the same technique for python scripts as well?
Where can I go to learn more about turning scripts into processing tools
with user inputs and various options?

Hi Tyler,

you may use a QgsProcessingParameterAuthConfig parameter

Message-ID: <PH0PR09MB7354A288C27D8B6EDC8C4A1D97DC9@PH0PR09MB7354.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hi QGIS Community,
A number of years ago, there was an effort to complete the Section 508/EEN 301 549 Accessibility Conformance documentation (i.e. Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)) for QGIS; is there a part of the developer/tech support community interested in completing these?

My thought is if there may be some Computer Science or Geo students where their program covers testing and conformance as a part of their developer program curriculum, then they could use QGIS testing and reporting as a part of a class project?  A long term relationship with that University could make regular updates sustainable.

There is lots of good information and resources, including the Template here<https://www.section508.gov/> < Home | Section508.gov<https://www.section508.gov/>>.  The last time I posted, the message was held up by moderator approval, hopefully this time my message can reach you all.

Having compliance reports adds to QGIS and other open source software increased legitimacy and would allow the use by more governmental organization that need to meet their procurement requirements.  Other thoughts, ideals or volunteers to lead a working group??  Thanks for the consideration.
