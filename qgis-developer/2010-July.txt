Hi,

did someone figured the problem of the missing icons under Ubuntu 10.04?


I still don't see icons on qgis self compiled or installed from
repositories.

We need to update a WMS layer with some additional custom parameters
during it's draw request.
I see that this is impossible, and ew have to make a new WMS instance
to do it, as all the wmsprovider parameters aren't updatable (uri,
etc.).
What about adding a fourth parameter to QgsWmsProvider::draw(
QgsRectangle  const &viewExtent, int pixelWidth, int pixelHeight ),
like a QMap<QString,QString>, to pass additional parameter to the
QNetworkRequest request?

I've studied the API a bit more, and I see the Draw cannot be touched.
It would ok to have an additional public QMap field in the
wmsprovider, to be able to set additional request params that will be
inserted in the url used inside the Draw method...

Of course! The plugin owner and repo admins would be allowed to grant and take

Do you suggest to manually block whole repository every time I discover that 
one of its plugins contains a small mismatch in metadata (e.g. causing the 
stubborn false upgradeable status)? It would affect users of other plugins...

Also it doesn't resolve connection problems. As far as I can hear it's quite 
irritating for some users (me too) to wait for fetching all repos and kill 
hanging connections.

I prefer our primary idea of proxying and automatic testing of each plugin, 
but it seems to be an unnecessary complication. I'd prefer to spend this time 
on building an author-friendly central repo and encourage authors to use it 
rather than on building such weird proxy :) It would take weeks of writing 
such application and will give relatively small profit. 

All I want to do is to keep constrain some quality standards. The hand-made 
xml metadata and zip packages are not acceptable. You don't see that every 
week I send notices to authors of broken plugins - let's imagine what was if 
I'd break both hands and stop to poke them ;-DDD

It was good when there was only a few repositories, but now it's too more.

I don't believe someone would prefer to fight against metadata instead of 
simply use svn. There are many graphical clients, so commiting changes 
requires one rightclick. Instead, the present solution makes you to:

1. remove .pyc files
2. make the zip package
3. upload the package
4. update the version number in repo.xml
5. restart qgis
6. install the plugin to test the package and metadata
7. [ restore your development environment if damaged in the previous step]

If you don't test plugins every time after commit, better don't confess ;p

The real problem is marketing. I understand someone can prefer to keep all 
stuff in his domain... But instead, we can enable them to keep their 
trademarks and url in the installer, right next to the plugin description.

Anyway, I've just closed my repository and move all plugins to the contributed 
one :-)

Sure! I'm glad to see a critical opinion in the end :)

What so painfull is in one-click automatic plugin publishing directly from 
your filemanager/console? :-) With proper metadata and changelog.

We can also ask all repo owners if they would be willing to move to such 
convenient central repo. Hey, are you here, Owners? :)

We can start from converting the present central repo (what is needed anyway) 
and then try just start to encourage them without any pressure.

We're currently hosting 11 plugins at our repo. The process is fully
automated and once set up the author only commits to svn, all the
other steps are done automatically using post-commit hooks.

As for moving, unsure yet. I'm a big fan of diversity and ability of
any person not only create a plugin, but distribute it the way (s)he
likes or even irrationally wants. Erik Raymond has a good essay about this on Lockean rights. It
is additional stimulation for a opensource developer to realize that this is
_his_ territory. Centralized plugin repo will technically be the same,
but psycologically somewhat different.

That said, I can see a lot of value for a new author in this system.
I'd say keep all options and let natural opensource selection do its
job. This will introduce some hassle for Borys, but I believe it worth
it for QGIS growth as not only software, but community.

Message-ID: <AANLkTillEEahqYZRgGUYV5B5acEqVcyi7YATorof9Omw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

My co-worker just installed trunk 13865 from svn on Ubuntu 10.04 and got a
startup error "Couldn't load plugin fTools due an error when calling its
classFactory() method".  The last line in the error references
ui_frmRegPoints.py.  I'm running svn 13794, with no problems, and see that
my ui_frmRegPoints.py is quite different than his.  Since we're both using
trunk, I'm guessing an update must have changed something?  Any help
appreciated, let me know if I should file a bug on this.  :)

It's not a problem for me, but I believe hanging connections and error 
messages are not the best way to growth of the community ;-) I agree we 
(authors) fell better maintaining our own repositories, but we can't satisfy 
such needs at the users' expense! :)

I see a sense in keeping your repository, what is always online, responsibly 
managed and quite rich. But we have 11 external repositories added by the 'add 
3rd party repos' button. Most of them contains 2-3 plugins and cause most 
problems. Moreover, there are next 5 repos not included yet. It isn't fair 
that they are treated worse, but the more repos I add, the more often problems 
happen.

So the compromise would be to offer to authors of small repositories a more 
convenient, robust and reliable solution and try to encourage them to join it. 
This way we can limit the number of external repositories added by the button 
to really necessary 3-5.

Other Authors will have a choice: 
- to join the community repo
- to maintain their own, but not included by the button
- to maintain their own and justify it's reasonable to add it

I understand the need of diversity, but users should trust that clicking this 
unfortunate button they won't be flooded by dozens unreliable repositories :)

Certainly not! In fact, I would suggest that you not worry about this
at all! I'm surprised to hear that you are emailing plugin authors so
frequently (especially if they aren't plugins from the official
repos). The user knows when they add the 3rd party repositories that
they are adding repos not maintained by the QGIS core development
team, so if one or two plugins say they've upgraded, but the metadeta
isn't quite right, that's a problem with the plugin author, and not
the QGIS folks. They should also expect some hiccups, after all,
that's probably why the plugin is in a separate repository anyway!?
The same is try for other plugin-based software... you simply don't
have the time to do the work of the authors!

Couldn't this be solved by adding a simple timeout to the requests? I
know Qt Http etc has facilities for this built-in?

I also like the idea of proxying, and I don't actually think it would
be as complicated as one might think (though I'm not an expert on
anything web-based really!). The other obvious option would be to
encourage authors to submit their plugins to the contributed
repository?

Again, I'm surprised that you are doing this. I wouldn't think that
this is your responsibility at all! 3rd party repository authors
should be maintaining their own repositories, and if problems occur
(site down, etc.) then their connections will simply time-out, and
users won't be able to download their plugins. As for the hand-made
xml data: one solution would be to create a very simple python plugin
that parses their __init__.py file and extracts the relevant info
correctly.

I'd also like to suggest that the 'add 3rd party repos' button should
simply fetch a list of 3rd party repositories from the QGIS server
(some sort of list created by an online submission system). That way
there is no hard-coding of repos by Borys, and it's fair for all
authors. We can certainly have a few different lists (i.e. well tested
repos, experimental repos, and untested repos). And as more people use
the plugins from a particular repo, the repo can be moved up the
hierarchy. Obviously this type of a system would lend itself well to
eventually adding the facilities for users to rate plugins etc.

Maybe this is simply too much work at this stage, but I'd like us to
also consider other options...

you need to install R and several R packages. If you are on windows you
will need to put the R binary path in the windows enviroment path. In
the plugin menu you can find an item that will help you install the
missing R libraries.

I'm guessing qgis.g.browser runs as a separate process from Qgis?  I need to figure out how to setup the relative link paths to the Qt frameworks in the Mac build.

What can I do in the GRASS plugin to see qgis.g.browser in action?

Yes. QGIS sets GRASS_HTML_BROWSER, so that GRASS calls qgis.g.browser to
open pages - for instance when starting g.manual -i in the grass shell.

Thanks.  Looks like it's a separate process, which complicates the linking.  But, short story - symlink the bundled frameworks dir to the libexec dir and it works.

Message-ID: <284031B5-E9CA-4E63-B47A-96FE87B6DF17@kyngchaos.com>

I'm pondering the idea of bundling a copy of GRASS in the Mac Qgis and would like to cut down the install size.  What are the essential parts of the GRASS installation and how is GRASS used from Qgis (for the GRASS plugin)?

- monitors - does the plugin use monitors (ie d.* commands)?  At least, I'm guessing not onscreen monitors like XDRIVER, but maybe file drivers?

- gui - probably not?

- one-shot gui stuff, like when a command is run without parameters? (or anything with gui interaction outside the full "GUI", like v.digit, r.digit, ...)  Does the plugin take care of these so that the commands are run non-interactive?

- documentation - html (looks like yes), man?

- python bindings? (not wx)

- any other specific modules not used by the plugin?


I know the path to GRASS (GISBASE) can be configured, but that's a manual process, aside from the default compiled into Qgis.  Would the plugin need some changes to dynamically set the GISBASE relative to Qgis?

I think GRASS binaries run in a separate process from Qgis (affects library linking), but I'm not sure.  ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New API for access to vector features
Message-ID: <AANLkTinRmeFM6tySBfqL3T3nZlbhXNIk0NRV-bsv-27T@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

(sorry for a long post)

while working on the threaded rendering of map layers, it became clear
that we need an improved API for retrieving features from vector
layers. We need to provide safe concurrent access to features from
multiple threads. That's a situation when a worker thread (for
rendering) is fetching data from a layer and in meanwhile the main
thread starts fetching from the same layer. Currently, the main thread
would interfere with the worker thread - if we're lucky, we would
fetch incorrect data in both threads, but generally this can (and
will) lead to segfaults.

There are basically two ways how we could handle the concurrent access:
1. use locking in providers (e.g. with mutexes) to guarantee that only
one thread is accessing vector data store at one time.
2. update providers to allow concurrent access - e.g. for PostGIS
provider this would mean to work with more queries at once.

To briefly compare the two approaches, the second one is more
user-friendly - e.g. the user can identify a layer (with identify map
tool) while the layer is being rendered, without any freezes of GUI.
If the locking was used, the layer would have to be first rendered
completely, only then the features of the layer could be identified,
producing a freeze in GUI until the layer is rendered. On the other
hand, implementation of locking is typically simpler than allowing
concurrent access without blocking. Which approach will be used can be
decided at the level of each provider, so if some providers don't
support concurrent access at all (or the implementation would be too
complicated), we can stick with the use of locking.

I've been trying to implement locking for the current API as is -
using vector data providers' functions select(), nextFeature() and
rewind(), but I've kept failing on the issue with "unfinished"
iterations. Imagine this code:
provider->select(...)
while ( provider->nextFeature(f) )
{
  // do something
  if ( x > 10 ) break;
}
When a locking scheme would be used, the provider would get locked in
select() method and unlocked again when the last feature has been
fetched. But in the code example above, the last feature probable
won't be reached and fetching of the features will be stopped earlier.
The provider is locked and there is no chance to determine that no
more features will be locked and start fetching features from other
threads. When trying to implement support for simultaneous access
without locking, it is unclear when the query can be closed and
resources freed.

So, I've worked on implementation of Iterator design pattern for the
read access. The vector data provider interface should get following
new function:
QgsFeatureIterator getFeatures( ... );
The arguments (which I've shortened with three dots) are the same as
currently for the select() method: what attributes to fetch, what
rectangle, whether to fetch geometries and whether to use intersection
test.

The QgsFeatureIterator is actually a proxy for the iterator of data
provider. The class looks as follows:
class QgsFeatureIterator
{
  // construct invalid iterator
  QgsFeatureIterator();
  // construct a valid iterator for iterating a vector layer
  QgsFeatureIterator( QgsVectorDataProviderIterator* iter );

  bool nextFeature(QgsFeature& f);
  bool rewind();
  bool close();
};

The usage - with current API:
QgsFeature f;
provider->select( ... );
while ( provider->nextFeature(f) )
{
  // do something
}

The usage - with new API:
QgsFeature f;
QgsFeatureIterator fi = provider->getFeatures( ... );
while ( fi.nextFeature(f) )
{
  // do something
}

You can see the difference in syntax is not big, though there are
advantages: when the feature iterator instance gets out of scope, the
close() method is called automatically - the provider can free
resources and/or release locks, so there's no problem with
"unfinished" iterations. And if there's support in provider for
simultaneous access, there could be more feature iterators fi1, fi2
that access the data at the same time without any interference.

>From the provider implementer's point of view, the getFeatures()
function would look like this:
QgsFeatureIterator MyProvider::getFeatures(...)
{
  return QgsFeatureIterator( new QgsOgrFeatureIterator( this, ... ) );
}

where QgsOgrFeatureIterator is a class derived from
QgsVectorDataProviderIterator class (interface):

class QgsVectorDataProviderIterator
{
  bool nextFeature(QgsFeature& f) = 0;
  bool rewind() = 0;
  bool close() = 0;
}

The QgsOgrFeatureIterator would implement the nextFeature(), rewind()
and close() calls from QgsVectorDataProviderIterator interface in a
similar way like the provider originally did. The iterator class
encapsulates all the reading code, so the provider class gets less
cluttered.

You might ask why to use QgsFeatureIterator proxy class, and why not
to use directly the derivatives of QgsVectorDataProviderIterator. The
reason is that if we used directly the pointer, it would have to be
deleted after each use and could easily produce some memory leaks if
the deletion is omitted (or even could keep the provider locked - as
the close() method wouldn't be called). The QgsFeatureIterator can be
easily designed in a way that it can be passed around by value and
will delete the internal pointer to the iterator implementation once
it gets out of scope.

Finally, there is the issue of backward compatibility: we can't just
remove the current API as it is being used widely in 3rd party plugins
and applications. The idea is to implement the provider data access
methods by the means of the new API: each provider would have its own
"old api" iterator:

void select( ... )
{
  mOldApiIter = getFeatures( ... )
}
bool nextFeature( f )
{
  return mOldApiIter.nextFeature( f );
}

Basically the same concept should be adapted for the QgsVectorLayer
class, which takes in account also temporarily added, modified and
deleted features.

I believe that if the new API proves to be fine, the current
select/nextFeature combo will be removed in QGIS 2.0.

I would really like to hear some feedback on this design from anyone
who is concerned about handling of vector layers. If you have any
questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reply.

Hi there!

I'm trying to compile/install Qgis (for development purposes) on my 
EeePC laptop. Due to limited space on my laptop (only 4gb), I want the 
qgis source code and the compiled application to run from a flash disk. 
*I've compiled the source code directly on my laptop without any 
problems*, but when I try to compile it from my flash drive I get the 
following error at 24% (and sometimes 17%):


...

The source code is located on my flash drive

I've tried to compile as root and/or to mount the flash disk elsewhere,

 Looks like cmake is trying to create a symbolic link. I guess your
flash drive is formatted with a file system that doesn't support
symlinks (some variation of the FAT system most likely).

 Not sure why cmake would do this, but it must be able to cope when
compiling on Windows since file systems there generally don't support
symlinks. Hmmm...

I think that we need:
- a trac for plugin bugs - currently there is no reliable way to point out bugs and
issues, to know which one was fixed, etc.
- a way to cooperate on plugins: there are easy fix and improvements that cannot be
applied because in the current structure only the owner of the plugin can; as a
result, several forking has already occurred (which is bad both for devs and for users).
All the best.

Hi Martin

Thank you for this detailed description. I agree with you that the iterator 
pattern is a good solution for concurrent vector layer access. I encountered 
problems with concurrency a lot of times, e.g. in the print composer and in 
the analysis methods. So I will be happy once I can remove the workarounds for 
them.

Note that there are also a number of situations (especially in vector 
analysis) where we could have conflicts within the same thread. E.g. if 
calculating inverse distance interpolation, we need, for each point, calculate 
the distance to all other points. It would be convenient to use two iterators 
on the same layer for it, which would probably create a dead lock if using 
locking in providers 
(currently it's even worse, we store all the points in memory for IDW 
calculation).
Maybe we should declare concurrent access mandatory for 2.0 providers?


An interesting point if implementing concurrent access without locking would 
probably be the implementation of robust iterators (if provider is edited 
while iterators are open). Maybe something for 2.0...


Regards,
Marco

I was thinking about this. Having the possibility of simultaneous
access for all providers would be indeed nice, though I'm not sure how
feasible it would be: if the provider's backend has API that is not
reentrant (e.g. it uses static variables), there isn't probably much
we could do with in, only to use locking. But the good news is that
most (if not all) of the current providers could be altered to allow
simultaneous access from threads. So far I don't know how this would
be handled in grass provider, and maybe there could be problems with
some obscure OGR drivers.

The importance of robust iterators for vector layers / providers is
questionable. I understand they can be important for data structures
such as lists or vectors where the editing operations appear
frequently. They also come at some price (cpu and memory). In vector
layers and providers where the editing takes place just rarely, it's
probably not worth the effort to implement them - read-write locks can
take care of that. Anyway, it's not a common situation where a layer /
data provider would be modified while features are being read.

Martin,

I failed to follow this thread closely.  How would you anticipate
implementing simultaneous access from multiple threads at all for OGR?
Currently you can never have multiple active feature iterators operating
against a particular layer in OGR because the feature iteration is "state"
of the OGRLayer and there can only be one OGRLayer representing a layer of
a datasource.

RFC 16 was intended to address this by allowing creation of clone OGRLayer's
but it was never adopted and implemented.

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc16_ogr_reentrancy

It seems that it isn't just "obscure OGR drivers", but all OGR drivers that
would fail to meet your desired level of service.

Hi Frank,

from our recent discussion on gdal-dev [1] I've got the impression
that for allowing second or any further iterator (all active at the
same time), the OGR provider could create a clone of its OGRLayer and
thus do each iteration in a separate instance of OGRLayer. By making a
clone of OGRLayer I mean to open a new one with the same input
parameters.

Martin,

I'm sorry for not addressing the clone point in that thread.  Unfortunately
the cloning ability described in RFC 16 was not approved and implemented so
there is no way to do such an operation.

If there is someone willing to do much of the heavy lifting, I'd be
interested in relaunching RFC 16.  If we want it in GDAL/OGR 1.8 it would
need to be addressed fairly soon.  I'll help, but I don't currently have
any client interest in the work so someone else would need to do the bulk
of the work.

Best regards,

Frank,

sure, I know the RFC has not been implemented. Now the provider has
one OGRDataSource and one OGRLayer created from it. What keeps me from
opening a second OGRDataSource and second OGRLayer with the same file
name and layer index? This is what I referred to as a 'clone' of the
first layer. This 'cloned' layer would have the reading state
independent from the original layer, wouldn't it?

When RFC 16 was going to be adopted, what was the expected semantics
of the clone layer functionality? Is there anything more to be done in
order to get a completely separate clone of a OGRLayer than just
instantiating its data source and the layer again?

Hi Martin

I'm not familiar with the grass libraries. Is it possible to iterate 
simultaneously from several threads or do the grass libs apply a lock?

Maybe the GRASS experts on the mailing list could help us there.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New developments QGIS mapserver
Message-ID: <201007081054.21105.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

I'd like to announce some news from the QGIS mapserver project 
(http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/qgis_wms/). The new version contains some 
improvements that are really convenient, especially for QGIS desktop users:

- It is now possible to publish a QGIS project as a WMS by moving the project 
file (qgs) to the same directory as the QGIS mapserver executable. 
QGIS mapserver then will pick up exactly the same settings as in the project 
file (including symbology-ng, labeling-ng, scale dependent visibility, ...). So 
it is now very easy to setup a WMS server with QGIS desktop / QGIS mapserver.

However, keep attention to save absolute pathes to the project file, otherwise 
the server cannot find file based layers and svg symbols. Also, it is important 
that project layers have the right CRS assigned.

- QGIS mapserver now provides the GetLegendGraphics operation. If there is a 
composer legend in the project file, QGIS mapserver tries to take the font 
settings from there.

- Legend groups in the project files are exported as WMS layer groups

- Performance has been improved by caching the content of the configuration file 
and the coordinate systems for epsg numbers. Like that, frequent file  access 
to config file and srs.db can be avoided. 
Also, the alpha channel is now only used if the WMS transparent parameter is 
true. So now, performance is quite fast.

As soon as QGIS 1.5 is out and we have binary packages, I'll do another 
announcement also on the user list. At the moment, it is necessary to compile 
from source (so ideal for early adopters). But it is very convenient with 
cmake (thanks to Tim). 

The source code can be downloaded with a git client: 'git clone 
http://github.com/pka/qgis_map_server.git'. In the cmake variables, insert the 
location of the QGIS libs, headers and providers and your fcgi dir. 
Then do 'make', 'sudo make install'.


Finally I'd like to thank the city of Uster for funding these developments, as 
well as the European FP6 projects Orchestra (http://www.eu-orchestra.org/) and 
SANY (http://sany-ip.eu/) for funding the initial development of QGIS 
mapserver.

Marco

I'm not very familiar with grass libs either. For now I will stick
with locking - otherwise I could easily break more things than
necessary. In future we could move to simultaneous access if that is
possible using the libraries.

Hi devs

Good news: there is the possibility to improve support for non-spatial tables 
(and most likely our pet subject table joins too) in one of my next projects. 

So I'll let you know once I have a first prototype that could serve as a base 
of discussion.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use qgis libraries in python scripts
Message-ID: <AANLkTimQEF1u_nXIKACMogkgQEVoe3x2cMTU7TcD2V4D@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

Im new in QGIS and I hope I choose right place to ask this question.

Im trying to create standalone python application that will use PyQT4
libraries and QGIS libriaries. I installed first python 3.1 and tested it in
console and Eclipse PyDev enviroment. It worked fine....then I installed
PyQt GPL v4.7.3 for Python 3.1, tested import of those libraries and
everything worked fine on both console and eclipse enviroment.

My next step was to try to use qgis libraries and I followed tutorial from
this site http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/html/intro.html to configure
enviroment variables for using PyQGIS in my standalone application. But when
I test "*from qgis.core import **" Im getting error message  "*from
qgis.core import *  ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure
could not be found*" all the time.

Here is how mine enviroment variables are set

*PYTHONPATH: *
C:\Python31\Lib\site-packages;C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable\python;
*PATH: *
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable;C:\Python31\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\bin;

I also tried with options to set following paths in
PATH C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable\bin;C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-unstable\lib;

I read a lot about this on internet and forums, I also saw comments that I
should use python and PyQt installation that comes with QGIS(version 1.4.0)(
I tried that running *OSGeo4W shell* and it worked), but I think it would be
better to dont be dependent directly to OSGeo installation...I would like
only to use QGIS librarires same as it is happenning with PyQT4.

Do you have any idea what is causing this problem, and how I could override
this so I can develop my python application in eclipse only including QGIS
libraries.

Thanks for any help

Hi,

Sorry for my late reply to this email.

Are you aware that OGR now supports dxf? Did you test the OGR driver?

http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_dxf.html

My employer paid for the initial support of dxf in ogr and is now funding
a second round of improvements regarding block references, dashed lines
and layer handling in the writer.

For QGIS to successfully digest OGR dxf it would have to deal with mixed
geometries, or split the geometry of one OGR dxf source into several QGIS
layers.

I wonder if you or someone else would be able to sponsor the QGIS side of
the dxf improvements. My employer paid for the OGR improvements, I wonder
if we can find another sponsor for the QGIS side of the improvements.

Also other formats with mixed geometries, such as DGN and Postgis would
profit from QGIS improvements regarding the handling of mixed geometries.

Another area of improvements is the OGR features styling. OGR delivers
styling information (such as stroke color, dashing, text styles, etc.)
with the DXF reader, however, currently QGIS can't digest this
information. This would also be an area where QGIS could be improved if
someone can provide the funding.

If you need more information on the topic, either discuss it here or
contact me, Frank Warmerdam or Marco Hugentobler offlist.

Andreas

 Plugin repositories are just web sites that serve up a zip file which
the plugin manager unzips in a plugin library folder.

 The Repositories tab of the plugin tool "Fetch Python Plugins" lists
the URL for each repository - if you can't get there with your web
browser outside of qgis then that's probably your office firewall
(assuming your internet access works for other stuff) and good luck
with that.

 If your web browser works but qgis doesn't get plugins it may be that
you have to use a web caching proxy to get off-site. There's settings
for that in the qgis options: Edit, Options, network and proxy. I
can't tell you what you need to put here!

 If web browser works, you can just download the zips and manually
unpack them in your qgis plugin folder.

 Oh and everything is being changed for plugins in Qgis 1.next :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] shapefile clipping behavior in qgis revision 13903
Message-ID: <4C38F832.2050808@GotSlack.org>

I am using QGIS to display oil spill extents and tropical weather in the
Gulf of Mexico. I've found that since I moved from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0
(rev 13903) that the clipping behavior has changed, and not in a good
way! (This may have happened much earlier than rev 13903, but I
haven't been keeping up with the latest revisions.)

It seems now that if any portion of a shapefile falls outside the view,
the entire shapefile is omitted from the display instead of just being
clipped at the edges of the window.

It's hard to explain so I've posted sample images at
http://gotslack.org/qgis/shapefiles

oil_zoom_out_again.png shows state boundaries, oil spill extents and
emergency fishing closures. In oil_zoom_out.png the zoom level has
changed, but I did not change the layers at all. You can see that the
emergency fishing closure polygon and several state boundaries were not
plotted.

In oil_south.png I have panned to show the oils spill extent and the
fishing boundary, but the state boundaries are not plotted. As I pan up
to oil_center.png, state boundaries and the fishing extents are not
plotted because they all fall partially outside the window. Panning up
to oil_north.png shows the oil extent and only one state boundary is
plotted because portions of the other states and the fishing boundary
fall outside the window.

I don't think this is the behavior we want and I'm hoping that this is
simply a configuration item that I have not been able to find.

Can anyone confirm that this is the expected behavior? Is there a way

Hi!

I have created a new category on the qgis-Wiki named "Conferences and
Exhibitions" and a new page with the same title (can be found on the
"Finance & Marketing" page.

At http://www.qgis.org/wiki/QGIS_at_AGIT2010 you can see a short summary
of questions that were asked to me during the 3 days of AGIT.

There is also a link to a photograph of the QGIS-booth! (I was not able
to upload the picture to the QGIS-Wiki, so I just linked it).

Anita also was at the AGIT and helped out at the QGIS-area on Thursday.

Interestingly, there were many requests concerning GPS tracks.

Best Regards,
Markus

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Georeference handle files with existing

Message-ID: <4C3A0823.8010505@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I wonder if someone is working on Ticket #2465:
Georeferencer: does not correctly handle files with existing 
georeferencing information.

I use a images with georeferencing information (example CBERS satellite 
image), and for use Georeference
i need make some steps:
1) Create JPG image from original (GeoTIF)
2) Delete file [name original image].jpg.aux.xml
3) Use JPG in georeference plugin
Add GCP's, in this case, i get the maps coordinate with same projection 
of original image (geotif).
For this i use the plugin "Coordinate Capture"
4) Get strig to GDAL (gdal_translate and gdalwarp)
5) Changes this string and run in console
5.1) gdal_translate: put EPSG with original image
gdal_translate -a_srs EPSG:29180 -of GTiff [-gcp pixel line -gcp pixel 
line] "original.tif" "original_gcp.tif"
* [-gcp pixel line -gcp pixel line] = gcp's show in string
5.2) gdalwarp:
gdalwarp -r near -order 1 -co  -dstalpha -tr 2.500000 -2.500000 
original_gcp.tif georef.tif
* in my case i not use COMPRESS

Maybe this steps would be util for someone.

Best Regards,
Luiz

Message-ID: <1278943980.1641.159.camel@sibirica>

Hi,

I'm experiencing a couple of problems with the table manager plugin
while working on a point vector that has non ascii chars in the name of
the columns of the table of attibutes.

*) if I try to delete one column the plugin throws this

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File

self.selection_list if i -1]
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xea' in
position 5: ordinal not in range(128)


*) if I rename one or more columns, then when I hit the "save" button
the plugin throws this message

"Error creating file. Check permissions."

followed by

"Failed saving the changes to the temporary directory: /tmp !
The layer won't be changed, please use the Save As button."

if I hit the "save as" button it returns the same messages but I even
experienced a crash:

if necessary I can provide sample data

Done. Table Manager should handle non-ascii field names properly now. I've 
also fixed a selection issue when moving fields.

Perhaps it is a bit off-topic, but I was unable to successfully georeference an image in trunk last week no matter what settings I tried. I kept getting a georeference of sorts, but way off location. I'd be happy to provide more information to the developer off-list.

Hi John,

it could be that you are indeed experiencing the issues which arise
when opening files with preexisting georeference/geotransform information,

It would be helpful if you could check if your input files contain any
georeferences or a geotransform (e.g. by using
gdalinfo, or by displaying the raster properties within qgis).

thanks,

	Manuel

I was hasty in my last response. I should have added that this was a raw tiff (no georeference) converted from a pdf map file.

In this case, it would be great if could you provide me with the .points file 
(i.e. the file where GCP coordinates are stored) and the transform
parametrisation you used (e.g., linear, helmert, polynomial).

Have you ruled out  the possibility that the file uses a different projection
from the project settings (on-the-fly raster reprojection is not yet supported
in qgis, so this could cause a misalignment).

I think I'll try to find a more general solution for this, in the
meantime there is a patch with workaround attached to the ticket. 
The workaround touches on a core class though, so has not been included
in the SVN codebase.

It is probably easier to strip georeferencing information using either the
geotiff baseline profile (which does not store SRS/geotransform information):

	gdal_translate -co "profile=baseline" <INPUT-FILE> <OUTPUT-FILE>

or by creating a "Virtual Dataset" file. The VRT method has the advantage of
not requiring an intermediate copy of the data:

	1) gdal_translate -of VRT <INPUT-FILE> <OUTPUT-FILE.vrt>
	2) open <OUTPUT-FILE.vrt> and remove the SRS and GeoTransform tags

The <OUTPUT-FILE> is then free of georeferencing information / SRS and can be 
used in the georeferencer without issues.

bye,

	Manuel

Hi Luiz,

I just realized that you seem to work with GCPS specified in the input
coordinate system (at least if I understand your workflow correctly, you enter
seem to enter GCP coordinates in the original coordinate system?). 

Reprojecting the GCPs to another SRS will hopefully be supported soon (see
#787) from within the plugin.

cheers,

Hi Manuel,

About Georeferencer plugin, i believe have a great plugin,
where users of  satellite image have very use.

I would like have changes below:
1) The tool move point of GCP can be in QGIS mapcanvas.
2) Use the image with geotags.
This case, can be calculate pixels coordinate to "source coordinate".
I believe it can done direct by plugin, don?t need change core 
(QgsRasterLayer).
3) The coordenates of map will be change for SRS define by user(options 
of plugin).
At the moment this coodenates is equal QGis mapcanvas SRS.

I tested yours sugestion about the "Virtual Dataset" for use image with 
geotag,
, it is perfect!

Thank?s,
Luiz

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS working script / demo
Message-ID: <AANLkTimmTYKIo5hM6a2BlRDteCVHDX79RUxyY_PsQg1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Anybody using PyQGIS cookbook?

http://www.mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/html/

It seems the cookbook gear towards advance developers who know a lot
of the qqis api and python.

Has anybody has a working demo / script using pygis to share? I am
particularly interested in rendering spatialite geometries in map
canvas. However, postgis rendering in map canvas or any script will do
as well.

Any sample PyQt application that uses a simple pyqgis map canvas?

I thnk some working python scripts that goes with PyQGIS cookbook
would be good to keep us started, not to mention geoprocessing
scripting in QGIS similar to ArcPy.

TIA.

Hi,

The Qgis-user mailing list is archive in searchable mail-archive.com,
however Qgis-developer is not.

http://www.mail-archive.com/find.php?domains=www.mail-archive.com&q=qgis&sa=Search&sitesearch=www.mail-archive.com&client=pub-7266757337600734&forid=1&channel=2703820358&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&cof=GALT%3A%23C8C8C8%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23CD9685%3BVLC%3A000000%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BALC%3A006792%3BLC%3A006792%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A006792%3BGIMP%3A006792%3BFORID%3A11&hl=en

I think it would be better to have qgis-developer mailing list in
searchable mail-archive.com as well. It is easy to search info in
mail-archive.

Thanks.

I started developing a simple PyGIS Application example using the cookbook.

Probably we can make this ball rolling and have a working example.
Please edit, add features, more feature othe sample scripts. Please
don't ask why this intial script is wrong or not appropriate just edit
and resend to the list. You can add ui resources as well if you like.

However, if you have a better demo that this, please share to us.

I am attaching the file in this email.

Thanks. Noli

Message-ID: <1945005498.20100714085332@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

there are two sets of statistics now for rasters, visible when you
open raster properties. One is taken aux-file if it exists using GDAL
and another is some kind of internal QGIS one.

Question why not use just one, GDAL's?

Implication is that QGIS stats are saved only session wide, if you
remove raster from the project it needs to be recalculated.

At this time additional packages with ecw and python support for GDAL 1.7.2
are not available. So ecw support is brocken and some Python plugins
(e.g. Gdal Tools) are not working.

Wait while new packages will be available or downgrade to previous version of
QGIS which builded with GDAL 1.6

Based on the traffic I've heard on from the GDAL side, this may not be
fixed. Word(not 100% confirmed) is that Erdas no longer offers the ECW
dll files for free from their website so their is no way to build in
support. So ECW support may require that you purchase such drivers from
Erdas.

So you might want to consider moving your data out of that format to
something with a more clear license like Mrsid.

Enjoy,
Alex

ERDAS removed the old SDK from their website and announced a new one for July. 
That may be the reason.

Hi

I wrote this on the blockers thread but it probably didnt get noticed
by may so I repeat here in a fresh thread:

Unless there are any objections I would like to make the final cut off
for bug fixes friday night, 12pm SA Time (GMT +2). I will make the
branch for the release and call for packaging on Saturday morning.

Python binding shipped with QGIS (both OSGeo4W and standalone) are
compiled against Python 2.x releases, so don't expect that it will
work with Python 3. Please use Python 2 and I _strongly_ recommend you
to use Python from OSGeo4W installation to prevent further troubles.

You _may_ have some success with Python 3 if you compiled QGIS with
bindings from source code, though the procedure might require some
tweaking and so far I am not aware of any effort in order to compile
and run QGIS with Python 3. At some point of time in future, QGIS will
use Python 3 by default, but nowadays everyone still uses Python 2.x.

I don't understand why you try to be independent from the OSGeo4W
installation. Having all the libraries in place (and working well) is
a huge advantage of OSGeo4W. If you do that to ensure that you don't
have to carry the whole OSGeo4W installation with your custom
application, then don't worry. You can simply copy only necessary
components (Python, SIP, PyQt4, QGIS and its dependencies) from it,
just like you would do it otherwise anyway.

Unfortunately this widget is not (yet?) available in the qgis_gui
library, because it is quite tied to QGIS application.

We would be glad to hear about your results if you decide to develop
your own (simplified) layer list widget.

In mean time I switched to python 2.5 and I succeed to include qgis
libraries.

I wanted to be independent from OSGeo4 because when I wanted to use pyDev
for debugging code, I couldnt use python.exe interpreter from OSGeo4
installation folder. I got some strange errors when I wante to reference to
python.exe.
Also another problem was that I used unstable version of OSGeo4, so maybe
that caused also problems. Just thinking...

Anyway, thx  a lot for answer

Cheers

Minja

Good to hear that!

By the way, we are always interested to know how people make use of
QGIS libraries in their custom applications and plugins. So, in case
you're not developing any top secret application, we are hungry for
any success stories and nice screenshots :-)

Hi Jim,

I am unable to replicate your problem with 1.5.0 (r13916). To my
knowledge, there are no clipping settings and the behavior you
describe is simply wrong. Are you able to replicate your problem at
any other machine/platform?

Regards
Martin

I would expect the problem to be caused by GDAL/OGR or GEOS library.
GSL shouldn't be responsible for that as it is used only for
georeferencing.

I'm trialling the use of Geoserver for serving up images to QGIS clients. I can get WMS to work well. However I was wondering about the QGIS support for tile sets. As far as I can see in the QGIS WMS proveder source code, tile sets are supported if there is a VendorSpecificCapabilities/TileSet tag in the get capability request.

Does any know if you can get Geoserver (or any other open source web mapping service) to provider this capability?

Thanks,

Hi Jeremy,

I think GeoStack has this function - Map tile server

"The ?geostack? consists of the following functional parts:
..
..

Map tile server that can store pre-rendered map tiles and serve them
up quickly to make maps seems to draw faster. Examples include ArcGIS
Server, MapGuide, Tilecache, GeoWebCache"

Ok thanks. I looked at Geoserver's built in GWC, but I couldn't seem to get QGIS to work with it. I tried these URLs:

http://localhost:8080/geoserver/gwc/service/wmts?REQUEST=getcapabilities
http://localhost:8080/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=getcapabilities&TILED=true

and neither of them had the VendorSpecificCapabilities/TileSet tag.

I also tried the TMS service Capabilities but I could get that working:

http://localhost:8080/geoserver/gwc/service/tms/1.0.0

it gave an error saying "Unknown layer 1.0.0. Check the logfiles, it may not have loaded properly".

If it's the TMS service I need for tile set support in QGIS then I may need to follow this up with either the Geoserver or the GWC guys, because I don't understand what is wrong here.

Cheers,
Jeremy

Back in the day when I wrote that, GDAL only estimated the stats
whereas the QGIS implementation computes them completely (I think this
situation is still the same today). Perhaps this functionality is not
something important and could be stripped out (or made into a plugin)
- it would certainly speed things up with rasters in some contexts.

Hi Tim,

thanks for the answer.

Yes, I think this part needs review and revision. If QGIS provides
some raster stats, which GDAL doesn't these stats should be stored
and loaded externally, so that QGIS will not try to recalculate them
every time they are needed.

Maxim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 1.5 Branch is done - Call for Packaging
Message-ID: <AANLkTik2uq-Yy2X5U7mnmEsZ08fZ0OvJd8O3g1qVMrm0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS devs & packagers

--- Note to casual readers ---

Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and
release team a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about
the release have a fair chance of finding a package, reading all our
press material etc.

--- End note ---

Today I have branched QGIS 1.5.0 'Tethys' for release. It would be
great if you can assist by making packages for your preferred
platform. The branch can be checked out at:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_5_0 qgis-1_5_0

Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.5.0.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/src/qgis_1.5.0.tar.gz.md5


Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging
related tweaks.

If you make a package please be so kind as to send me an email with
details of where I can download the package. Please make sure the
package is wgettable since I do not have the bandwidth to first
download all packages to my home pc and then up again to the download
server.

If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros
please let me know so that we can avoid duplication of effort.

I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be
great to have as many packages as possible ready by then.

SVN (Trunk) is open again for general commits - please seek guidance
from Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any
major code changes.

Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters,
document writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a
reality.

Lastly can I call on the release team to put together visual changelog
(I have already started with this here
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/VisualChangeLog1.5.0 - please use t2t format
for any additions), press announcements etc. ready for the release
date? I will send you an email when the packages are ready and you can
start broadcasting announcements.

Best regards

Manuel,

I don't find your tickect  #787.

I made few changes in source of Georeference, at, now, the plugin can work
with change of projections (QGIS and Plugin):

1) The input coordinates (populate reference coordinate in table GCP) 
are transforms to projection of Plugin.
Can now changes projections in QGIS, this can be useful when need work 
different image of  reference.

2) When change projection setting of plugin (EPSG of destination), the 
reference coodinate(table of GCP) are change to new
projection.

The path is ticket #2890.

For windows user, can test by DLL:

For Linux I updated my Launchpad ppa at [1] with packages for Ubuntu jaunty,
karmic, lucid and maverick.  For some reason only the i386 packages were build
and the amd64 build are still in the queue.

For Windows I created a OSGeo4W on our QGIS VM (while access to
upload.osgeo.org is restricted.  BTW I enabled the apache userdir module in the
process. 

There are only two qgis packages left:  "qgis" is the current release 1.5 and
"qgis-dev" will be the nightly builds (currently not updated automatically).
Both contain QGIS including python and the grass plugin in a single package.
All other packages are not marked obsolete and upgrade to 1.5.  The express
install will also install 1.5.

he packages are available at [2]. To install from the mirror one need to call
this way:

osgeo4w-setup -s http://qgis.org/~jef/osgeo4w

Also available is a standalone installer from the same packages at [3].

Please test...

Message-ID: <CAAC2BE7-0FF1-4EF7-A1A9-D285FC71E28B@hailmail.net>

I just dove into debugging a python problem in a QGIS plugin, and happen to be using William's excellent dev build for mac.

I noticed that when setting a pdb breakpoint:

import pdb
pyqtRemoveInputHook()
pdb.set_trace()

..now when I finish debugging and type 'c', QGIS is able to continue rather than hitting an fatal error.

Maybe my memory is just bad (possible!), but I think this is a new behavior, and I just wanted to call out who ever added this subtle fix. You are awesome!!!

Thanks!

Hi devs,

I update the patch for Georeference plugins (ticket #2890 ).

At now, the dialog input coordinate is compact(the information about 
input by tips) and save the last position of dialog (when accept).

The update DLL (windows user, see last email)  is
http://www.hotshare.net/br/file/276655-1313767772.html

Hello,

The fate of the download's page is not settled yet but it would be great 
if packagers could update this page -> 
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download%2Bwip by changing the links to their 
binairies and adding the proper installation commands (for linux mainly).

About the visual changelog, the wiki page states that it will be 
published on the blog but I think i should posted on the website so the 
content can be localized like any other joomla page (joomla needs an 
english version to allow localized content).

QGIS 1.5.0 should be available on mandriva's backport for 2010.1 and 2010.0

Regards,
Jean Roc

Hi all,

I've just installed the new QGIS version, thanks for all that work and kudos
for the qgis dev team!

The J?rgen's Karmic packages work well.

Regards,

Germ?n

Hi Jurgen.
GDAL 1.7 should (untested-no win here) be on osgeo4w now: any plans on using this
instead of 1.6 for final packages?
All the best, and many thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Table join branch
Message-ID: <201007190910.35080.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi QGIS devs

There is now the table_join_branch (svn co 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/table_join_branch) which contains an 
initial table join prototype. Here is a short description how to use it:
- Load a vector layer
- Load a table layer. This can be done e.g. using 'Layer->Add Vector Layer...' 
on a .dbf or .csv file
- Go to vector layer properties->join and click '+' to add a new join
- Select join field of table and join-to field of vector layer
- Now you should see the new fields in the attribute tab of the vector layer 
properties, in the attribute table and in the info-tool window

Internally, QgsVectorLayer stores the join info (fields and join table provider 
key) and remaps the field ids (first the provider ids, then the joined field ids 
and last the added field ids). When querying the joined field values, a subset 
string is set to the table provider to query a feature with the value of the 
join field.

As you might expect, there are still a number of issues:
- Joined fields cannot be edited (should they?). So attribute table and info-
tool should disable those rows. QgsVectorLayer probably needs a method to tell 
attribute table and info tool which rows are not editable.
- Performance is an issue. The current implementation tries to improve 
performance by automatically creating attribute indices in the ogr provider 
(could be implemented in other providers too). Still there is a siginificant 
performance penalty when doing classifications based on joined attributes or 
attributes searches (info tool and opening attribute table are usually fast, 
because not many features are queried at once).
One possibility to enhance this could be to load tables into memory providers 
and implementing attribute index capability there. Are there other 
possibilities?

Looking forward to you feedback and suggestions. I'm sure there are a lot of 
issues I didn't consider.

@Martin: in your gsoc blog, you write that you are refactoring the editing 
buffer to a utility class. Do you think the join info and the id remaping can 
be ported to the new design easily?

Regards,
Marco

yes and QgsVectorDataProvider too, so that for instance the postgres provider
can mark columns without insert or update privilege as readonly - or even
generally editable for new feature only.

The qgis-dev package use GDAL 1.7.   1.6 has no python support and no ECW/MrSID
support yet.  So I thought it's better to stick with 1.6 for qgis.

Hi Martin,

For now I just want to make some base framework...and offcourse I will share
it with community :).

Probably I will have a lot of questions during developing, I hope will find
support from all of you, as it was till now.

BTW I will continue to use this configuration(with standalone python
installation), hope find no problem as you said it could be... :)

All the best

Minja

Um, sorry.  I meant to say 1.7 doesn't have python and ECW/MrSID support yet.
1.6 has support for point - that's the point.

I will take a look on your implementation and post some comments.

I think it will be necessary to keep some kind of cache for the joins,
because even if there is an index on the joined field, accessing the
index (which is stored on disk) for each feature is costly.

Well, there will be a good number of collisions as it does quite a lot
of changes in vector layers and data providers. I just hope my branch
will be the first to be merged into trunk :-D

I'm not sure I understood.
I use only the gdal 1.7 on Ubuntu and all works fine. And I have the
python-gdal 1.7.2 too.
So, what do you mean saying "no python support"?

Thanks.

Paolo,

I have not yet built the gdal17-python package for OSGeo4W.   I assume he
meant 1.7, not 1.6.  I did *try* but the setup.py checks if Visual Studio
is in the registry and it is not on my system.  Oh, that pisses me off.

Actually the intent was to introduce the QGIS API, so it probably fails :-/
I expect that someone wanting to interface qgis from python has some
python knowledge - there are many tutorials for python.

Sure, I have various scripts, though most of them are for some
specific data processing.

The cookbook shows how to load a spatialite layer and shows how to use
map canvas widget. It just doesn't show how to combine the layer and
canvas in a simple script. Is that what you are missing?

Some good and short examples can be found here:

That makes sense. A bunch of simple and commented examples will surely
be handy for beginners.

Well, in the section "An overview of the dependencies required for
building" there is a list of libraries together with the minimal
versions. Isn't that what you are looking for?

Speaking of which, how would you like people to go about contributing. I
have lots of little things I've discovered from teaching QGIS python API
to GIS students with little to no programming background.

Thanks,
Alex

For now, you can just mail me your contributions and I will add them.
Some time later I will put the cookbook into svn, so it will be easier
to contribute explanations, code and fixes. I'm sure that with GIS
students you've came across many common mistakes. I will be happy to
hear about the usual difficulties.

Hi Martin and Alex,

Thanks for replying to this posting.

Martin, thanks for posting this link ( http://blog.qgis.org/node/59 ).
 I keep on googling for python qgis pyqgis examples but this link
never showed up in the search.

Alex, probably you can post the lecture notes / lab materials from
your teaching course in your website, similar to your previous adviser
- Prof R. Plant did here:

http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/plant/qgislabs.htm

I find Lab10 for the above link useful to what I am doing - thematic
mapping in R.

I am looking forward to see your PyQGIS recipes.

Thanks.

Regards, Noli

You could achieve this by creating a custom renderer which would draw
thumbnails. The images would be rendered directly to the map.

Another option is to implement a custom map canvas item that will show
thumbnails on top of the map.

Each approach is better suited for a different scenario. If you want
to print such map, implement a renderer - map canvas items are not a
part of the print output. If you want just browse the images, map
canvas items are probably a better solution - for example, they could
be loaded and scaled in a worker thread, thus achieving a better user
experience.

You can check out the player plugin [1] from my former qgis-mapper
project - it uses canvas items to show thumbnails of geotagged images
along the track. It also supports grouping of images when there are
more of them close to each other.

Hi Magnus

If the images are related to vector features and the image path comes from an 
attribute, creating a new renderer seems to be a good choice.

If the images are not feature / attributes related (and you don't have 
thousands of it on the canvas), you could also implement the images as canvas 
items.

I have code for a very simple plugin that inserts/removes image items at click 
locations. The plugin was used for educational purposes, but maybe it could be 
enhanced to something useful:

Marco

This is very close to what I want to do, ideally showing a directory
of geotagged images as miniatures. Clicking on the picture opens a large window
and (optionally a comment field).

A combination of what you have done with eVis, but preferrably more integrated.

Perhaps a custom provider is also needed?

No, you can use any of the available providers to open a vector layer
from a plugin, then read features from the layer and place the canvas
items accordingly.

Are you thinking of placing the photo thumbnails based on their EXIF coordinates?
This would be very useful, IMHO.
In this case, I think you would need an EXIF provider.
See also the Photo2Shape plugin.
All the best.

So, I have been interested for a while in the possibility to set a different path more appropriate for the system, like the user application data folder on Windows and the user application support folder on OS X.

Bummer, looks like this update is just for setting the path at runtime, which is not really possible, or at least difficult, to do for the OS X application (you just don't normally start applications with switches, but you can from a Terminal, yuck).

I found this patch ticket for compiling in a system-specific default.

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1442

It only has a Windows default, but a Mac default should be easy to add.  I wonder if it could be combined with this runtime switch change?

Some time ago I've start to develop plugin that placed photo thumbnails
based on their EXIF coordinates on QGIS map canvas, also it can display
full photo when user clicks on thumbnail. I my work I've use custom map
canvas approach as in Martin's qgis-mapper (really cool and very usefull
project!).

I have many another ideas about improving this plugin but unfortunatelly
I don't have much time for implementing, even for debugging and releasing
plugin with only existing functions.

Anyone willing to take this on? Alex, would you mind making your code available, so
eventually others could help improving it?

Hi Marco,

This sounds like another great addition on your part. Is, or will there be, a means to export a joined layer to a vector format that creates an attribute table with both the original layer table and the joined table? In other words, will an export of a join result in a new layer complete with both attribute tables?

Thanks,
John

this.
Would you have other ideas as good as this that you didn't release yet? ;)

Hi all.
Surprisingly, reading a slite raster is way faster than a plain TIFF. Try this:
in QGIS, questa http://download.gfoss.it/TrueMarble/TrueMarble-250m.sqlite
and this:
http://ueod-globe.net/globe/TrueMarble_GeoTIFF/TrueMarble.250m.21600x21600.D2.tif.gz
Caution: you'll need gfdal 1.7, and probably a 64 bit system, as the sqlite file is >
2 Gb.

Hi Paolo,

Hm - interesting. I did not test it myself.

However, when you say "tiff" - did you optimize it with pyramids? What compression did you use?

Hi John

Yes, an export adds all the joined fields to the new layer. So this provides a 
good workaround if the join performance is too slow.

Marco

No optimization: just the plain tiff as downloaded (this was meant as a "test drive",
not a real use case).
I think we should deserve more attention to SpatiaLite, that could well become our
default format in a not-too-far future.
All the best.

It's in early stage, I've start it as test project. User can
load photos, change thumbnails size (in some range) and view full image
after clicking on thumbnail. Also plugin creates an point shapefile
based on photos EXIF tags in same way as Photo2Shape does.

But photos don't stored in any place and after reopening project you need
to load photos again. There is some performance and quality issues with
thumbnails generation.

If there are no objections from other developers, I think for qgis 1.6
we can alter the qgis user settings directories per platform as
follows:
- unix: ~/.qgis (as before)
- win: ~/Application Data/qgis
- mac: ~/Library/Application Support/QGIS

I just wonder how much this will confuse users as with the upgrade to
1.6 they will loose their locally installed plugins, custom styles,
CRS and some other stuff...

What about a "migration assistant" - just a window "Qgis detected that blah 
blah blah, do you want to move your stuff to the new location? [Yes] [No]" 

It can be implemented in Python as a "service plugin", enabled by default. The 
downside is that the Python support is optional, the advantage is flexibility.
In Hannover we were talking about a first-run wizard. Yes, I confess I haven't 
start working on it yet :/ but the idea is still alive. I could start from the 
migration assistant and then expand the 'service' stuff also on the first-run 
wizzard and possibly even some localization settings (default WMSes or so).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] EXIF data providers
Message-ID: <4C49B45D.8090300@amnh.org>

This is a spin off of Homann's original thread " Render miniature rasters?"

We have a QGIS data provider already written that will take a directory 
of images and treat it as a point layer based on the EXIF data. The EXIF 
data is read only at this point but with minimal work it could be made 
to be able to both read and write. We would be happy to pass this along 
to anyone who wanted to use it as a base or spin off a new project from it.

I would like to suggest that all the folks working on or thinking about 
developing new plugins for images and EXIF data have a group chat. I 
would even be willing to try to coordinate this if there was interest.

Hi Martin,

From and OS X perspective, I think this would be a good change. A note in a readme file could be supplied with 1.6 binaries and it could also be noted in the documentation. That should suffice to cover the change.

Cheers,
John

sorry, I missed to leave my feedback in the past days.

I also think that this is a great addition to QGIS! thanks! potentially
it can fill the void about the lack of symbology colormaps for rasters.
I would love to see this as a core feature instead of a plugin.

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/782

I tested the plugin under qgis 1.5 in Ubuntu 10.04 and this are my first
impressions:

*) it takes really a lot to load rasters, even small ones (a few MB
tiffs).
*) there is no way to stop loading the raster after having clicked the
plugin icon
*) the GUI has a few glitches under linux, gnome at least
*) the new colormap should be directly imported/used
 

cheers

I totally agree with you that the time it takes to read the raster is far too long due to the need to get all values of the raster. The original program is written in VB6 and is far faster than the plugin but limited to Windows.
My knowledge of python and the QGIS API is close to nill, so any help on how to speed up things are more than welcome.
Obviously, programming the plugin in C++ could help a lot, but this is far above my capabilities!


> *) there is no way to stop loading the raster after having clicked the
> plugin icon

I'm busy on the next version that will have progress bars (and an abort button), so that user can at least see that something is happening, albeit at a snail pace :-(


> *) the GUI has a few glitches under linux, gnome at least

For the GUI glitches, again, it must be due to my lack of experience with Qt. I will try to fix that as well.
Something is bothering me in the image you have attached: does the raster get coloured after you click 'Create'? Or does it stay grey?


> *) the new colormap should be directly imported/used

Again this is due to my lack of knowledge of the QGIS API. I simply did not find how to load a colour ramp into a raster, the API is very daunting here!

As a side note, when you create a colour table, the raster data is saved in a compressed form so that if you use the plugin on the same raster again it will open much faster.

Cheers,
Benoit

Great news! Thanks Peter.
We are interested.
How about putting your code on svn, possibly on a separate branch?

Moreover, two suggestions:
- the palettes should be sorted according to similarity (eg, all the greys together,
all the dtms together, etc.): the current listing makes it difficult for an user to
find what he needs
- I think this functionality should really go to core, as it is much needed.

Hi again Paolo!

Sorting of the palette: at present the palettes are sorted by number of colours because it seemed more logical to me...
In fact, the order is given by the order in the xml file. So arranging the xml file to your requirements should do the trick.
I will *try* to write a "sorting" little apps and put it in a 'customise' button if that can help?

Well, I also think the feature should be a core feature, but I'm not the man to do that! The code is open to anyone interrested to convert it to C++...

Also I have great difficulties to find out how to load the colour ramp directly on the raster (disguised request for help here!)

With the capability of producing colour ramps (e.g. colour tables) comes the need to display the colour scale when printing the raster. Is someone interested in a colour scale generator? I do have one in VB6 and intend converting it to a python plugin once "1-band raster colour table" is pretty much debugged.


Cheers,
Benoit

Hi,

I'm using QGIS 1.5 under Ubuntu 10.04 and if I save a project, that
include a layer downloaded with the "openlayers" plugin, when I try to

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins with unsatisfied dependencies
Message-ID: <AANLkTincC9M6_ppnjZFQR5CCynqY8c4wuB01pfy3yYnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
I found some plugins which throw an error if there are unsatisfied
dependencies.

ThanI investigate the problem and I found that the error is due to
the position of the "import" clause in the __init__.py file.

To resolve it, the "import plugin_name" should be moved into the
classFactory function.

Here an example:

def classFactory(iface):
    from plugin import Plugin
    return Plugin(iface)

I guess this could help to avoid the error installing plugins.
Would be useful if everyone checks his plugins.

In this moment I found Contour and HomeRange_plugin, but could
be more than 2.

Cheers.

Hi all,
change is made in 0.7.1 for the contour plugin.
Is it possible to hope to see a little change in the plugin system
where plugins devs have the possibility to append a more general
description, not only in a single line? In this way, maybe a simple
text/html file in the plugin package where can be specified
dependencies, special attentions, descriptions, ... will be displayed
by the python plugin installer on a double click or other but before
the installation...
Cheers

And a changelog too.. Yes, it's planned for a next version of Installer, after 
gui reorganization. I don't think many authors will be willing to upload a 
separate html file though, so probably it will become more useful when we 
implement the new repositories with automatic metadata generation.

Message-ID: <58C383B0A191E747BE79503F3EEA22BF5E85F9C433@beja012.edia.pt>

Hello.

I would like to confirm this is a problem with qgis 1.5 before opening a ticket...

I'm trying to connect to a tilecache service, that has an incorrect capabilities doc. Specifically it publicizes wrong OnlineResources urls.
When I connect to this service QGIS shows a window asking if the publicized urls should be ignored. I answer yes. From here on QGIS does not make any further requests to the server. I checked the traffic with a proxy, and the only request that shows up is for the capabilities doc.

I was convinced that QGIS would use the url I entered when creating the service, ignoring the caps. doc but still using the original I provided.

So, is this the expected behavior? If so, wouldn't it be best to just tell the user the service is not usable instead of adding the service to the map that doesn't work?

You can try this with the following url:
http://mapas.igeo.pt/tilecache/tilecache.py

I corrected the capabilities doc. You can find it here:
http://beja019.edia.pt/mapasigeopttilecache.xml

I just changed all the OnlineResources urls to http://mapas.igeo.pt/tilecache/tilecache.py?.


Thanks,
Duarte

Hi all.
AFAIK, the main osgeo4w server is still down, which means we do not have fresh
packages for QGIS, as well as other sw.
I think this is very unfortunate: are we going to do something about this? Should we
set up an alternative host for download?
And, on a related matter, how is the 1.5 release going?
Thanks a lot.

"We" already did.  As already mentioned in [1] there is a temporary, private
repository at [2].  It's still hosting the qgis 1.5 build and meanwhile also
receives nightly qgis builds again.

I expect access to (the real) download.osgeo.org to be restored eventually.  
But I'm not sure who is working on that, what the obstacles are or when that
might happen...

Too bad. I do not consider this type of "service" as suitable for our infrastructure.
Am I the only one? Too demanding?
All the best.

After the hack incident we've been unable to get the blades back up due
to a networking glitch with the blade controller (A Solaris box I
believe, anyone with Solaris expertise would be welcome to help). We do
have a backup of download.osgeo.org running but because it is on our
backup host we are very wary of opening access/doing too much.

If you have another server you'd like to offer up to OSGeo for free use,
and can provide hardware support to I'm sure there'd be interest.

Restoring the server is at the top of the list, just not as easy as
anyone had hoped. Members of SAC do have access to add files to the
current server manually, so if there's something you really want to get
up let us know.

Thanks,
Alex

I think having a fresh osgeo4w installer and packages would be important.
All the best, and thanks.

What do you mean by that?   What should be fresh about the osgeo4w installer?
And what new packages are there?   The 1.5 test packages shouldn't go into the
main repository before we release them and the nightly builds are old before
somebody can upload them manually ;)

At some point in future, I'd like to have support for this metadata:
- dependencies: to allow the plugins list which packages they require
- author email: it's sometimes hard to reach the authors if their mail
is unknown
- url: web page dedicated to the plugin (already supported in
repositories, but not inside the plugins)
- icon: helps users to visually identify the plugin

IMHO supplying a text/html file would complicate things unnecessarily.
The plugin installer could allow the user to visit the plugin's URL -
that web page could contain exactly the information you would
otherwise had to pass along the plugin.

Martin

Message-ID: <58C383B0A191E747BE79503F3EEA22BF5E85F9C495@beja012.edia.pt>

Hi.

I'm trying to work with Eric4 and QGIS. Eric4 integrates very well with PyQT but requires QScintilla2 and its python bindings. We can get this by installing PyQt [1] or by building QScintilla from scratch [2].

Problem is, I can't find PyQt binaries anymore at the same version used by QGIS (QT 4.5.2).
And no matter how hard I try I always fail to build QScintilla python bindings (tried Visual Studio 2008 and mingw32; several versions of Qscintilla)... problems arise at the final stage of nmaking the python bindings, with several C2440 errors (Conversion loses qualifiers) [3].

So as a last resort I'm asking the list if anyone can help...
...do you have a PyQt distribution that includes QScintilla and is on par with QGIS? Can you build QScintilla 2.2 or 2.3 using the same QGIS/OSGeo4W environment (v2.4 requires sip 4.10 and QGIS is using sip 4.8)?

The ideal situation would be to include Qscintilla in the  QGIS building process... but this may be to much to ask?

Thanks,
Duarte

Yes, that's what I mean: having fresh nightly builds.
I imagine other sw would have new versions too.
BTW, I think the release of 1.5 should be imminent, and it would be embarrassing not
to have it on osgeo4w when ready.
All the best, and thanks.

+1. I already asked this months ago... It would be very good, also to
have an improved Python Scripting environment in QGis.

Hi Martin,
yes you've right, my idea with a text/html file is just a start point,
not a general request. After, it's how these metadatas will be
"linked" to the plugin (a text/html/xml file inside the zip file or a
filled form on the repo, ...) and how they will be displayed by the
PPI... The end point is to provide more information on a plugin before
it's installation.

You can get PyQt4.4.3 for python2.5 from http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/

PyQwt3D-0.1.6-Python2.5-Qt4.4.1-PyQt4.4.3-NumPy1.2.0.exe

Then try to find Qt4.4.3, this might be a better approach.

Noli,

I think we cannot use a different Qt/PyQT version than what QGIS was built with (Qt 4.5.2, Python 2.5.2). This is why I ended up trying to build Qscintilla, because I can't find anywhere a compatible binary distribution.

You can get PyQt4.4.3 for python2.5 from http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/

PyQwt3D-0.1.6-Python2.5-Qt4.4.1-PyQt4.4.3-NumPy1.2.0.exe

Then try to find Qt4.4.3, this might be a better approach.

Also, I verified the PyQwt installation, and it requires PyQt and Qt. Does not include them... unfortunately.

If anyone knows of any other package we could try...

Hi Marco

finally I've found time to look at the code...

Just to be sure with the table joins, do we refer only to left outer
joins on one table where the join predicate checks for equality of
attributes? I.e. something like this:
SELECT * FROM layer LEFT OUTER JOIN table1 ON layer.a = table1.x [
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON layer.b = table2.y ... ]
Or could there be other scenarios like other join types (inner, right
outer), more complex join predicates (possibly involving geometries)?

(I will assume only left outer join from now on)

In my opinion, the current implementation is not suitable for
production use. In general case, the joining needs linear time for
fetching attributes for each feature. Using the attribute indexes can
get this typically to logarithmic time, but still there's need that
user creates the indexes and provider supports that (probably not many
ogr drivers have this functionality, postgres provider might not have
sufficient privileges etc). I think we should aim to find joined
table's row for each feature in constant time, otherwise the
performance will be still an issue.

If we can assume that the joined table won't be modified (much), we
could build a hash table for each joined table: key = join attribute,
value = vector of joined attributes. So, later when the layer is being
iterated, for each feature we would only have to look up the attribute
in hash table and copy the joined attributes. (Additionally, if we
wanted to save memory, the hash table values could be only feature ID
in the joined table - the joined attributes would be loaded at once
when starting iteration over layer and deleted again when the
iteration over layer has finished).

This way I hope we could achieve good performance when fetching
features and to keep the design simple (and with no need for external
attribute indexes).

I will not post comments on any particular source code issues, as it
is probably too early for that and the focus should stay on the design
level.

Martin

Try emailing RiverBank Computing and ask if they have a directory of old
releases available.

Thanks,
Alex

FYI, I kinda gave up on ERIC because the autocompletion isn't very good
and mostly use SPE with the Qt tools these days.

Hi all

Today I wrote up the visual changelog (http://blog.qgis.org/node/145
you may need special permissions to see it) and updated the new
download page at:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download

Thanks for those who contributed this to the wiki. Before I put out
the release announcement can I ask:

1) Gary can you redirect http://download.qgis.org to that new page
2) If anyone has created packages for QGIS on platforms not listed or
listing still old versions, can you please update the wiki page
accordingly.

I would like to put out the release announcement tomorrow evening.

Best regards

Some notes:
- Why is the LTS version still mentioned?  I think that's the main source of
  confusion.  We should drop that altogether or simply just mention it
  separately as special edition for enterprises or something - stale and
  stable ;).  The current release should be the recommended version for normal
  use and should not be spoiled by the LTS version.
- We don't support the current release?
- The releases (and dates) should be described in one section and not for each
  platform.
- The standalone windows installer is also based on the OSGeo4W packages and
  includes GRASS.  ECW & MrSID support is not included - just like in the
  OSGeo4W packages.
- I don't think we need to mention MSVC.  There currently is no other build
  anyway.
- The ubuntu packages from my ppa will be moved to ubuntugis on release.
- I'll asked Frank Warmerdam to update the "real" osgeo4w repository on 
  release.

Alex, I'll try emailing riverbank.

In the meanwhile I tried SPE but couldn't find any qt tools integrated with
it. Can you compile .ui to .py or .qrc to .py using the gui?

I also found Monkey Studio [1] which does include this kind of integration.
It seemed a bit unstable though - still testing... it does integrate very
well with Qt designer - you don't even have to open Qt designer separately.

Duarte,

Are you looking / trying other Python IDE using PyQt and QScintilla
with Qt Designer?

Spyder, but using the latest PyQt and QScintilla

Hi all,
my name is Dario and I'm a qgs developer novice.

I want create a new qt application that show me a map.

I have some questions:

1) Which type of installation I must doing if I want to be able to use Qgs
API? Current version? Trunk Builds? Source code and than compile it?

2) Can I developing my application on Windows 7 64 bit architecture?


Any suggestion?

Thanks, Bye

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS-T
Message-ID: <201007301512.27311.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi all

Recently, I've been busy implementing support for WFS editing (WFS-T). The 
version in svn trunk now supports the transactional operations 'insert', 
'update' and 'delete'. Feature locking is currently not supported.

The use of WFS editing is similar to other datasources: make layer editable, 
do changes, commit or revert. On commit, the WFS provider sends the XML 
messages for insert/ update/ delete.

There is however an additional difficulty: sometimes the datastore behind the 
WFS has restrictions on inserting new features (e.g. database constraints). So 
when receiving errors on insertion of features to the WFS, it is important to 
carefully read the error message from the server. Unfortunately, these 
messages are sometimes not really informative.

I've tested the client with a geoserver instance and a tinyows instance (but 
with disabled schema check for tinyows). Unfortunately, servers to test WFS-T 
are very rare. If you use another product (or encounter a bug with those two 
mentioned servers) and have a public accessible instance, let me know.

Finally, I'd like to thank NaviGo (www.gonavigo.ca) for funding the 
development of the WFS-T extension. With the support of the GPS live tracking 
and WFS-T, NaviGo provides great help in bringing QGIS to the state-of-the-art 
in collecting data.


Regards,
Marco

In my application I need to let the user to select (from a table) and
zoom to a specified feature
The layer is made of a dense cloud of points, so even if the point get
selected it happens to be hidden by other (unselected) points.
Is it possible to ask the renderer to put the selected points on top
of the others?

I'm working on qgis 1.4 throgh the python bindings.

No but compiling those is so easy on a command line:
pyuic4 -o UIexample.py UIexample.ui
pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py resources.qrc

I imagine if you really wanted to integrate it, a quick python script
calling those commands could be linked to buttons in any editor.

Besides, I consider auto-completion of code a much more important aspect
of integration. And Winpdb the debugger that comes with SPE is capable
of debugging QGIS plugins while they are running in QGIS. Supposedly you
can do this with ERIC but I haven't figured out how.

Thanks,
Alex

As an added note, I keep a command line window open all the time to use
with svn, git, Hg etc since integration of those is never up to my
standards in the IDE either.

Dear Dario!

You could use whatever installation, I'd say.

Did you see the Coding guide yet? I think it offers an example for you.

Ciao a tutti,
sto incontrando problemi con il plug-in find by attribute su windows 7. La 
scelta dei layer e dei campi (field) su cui fare ricerca e selezione funziona 
ma incontro problemi cio? non accade niente quando schiaccio il tasto search. 
Con windows xp tutto funziona bene. Come mai? qualche suggerimento?

Grazie

Hi Francesco!

Running both QGIS 1.4 and 1.5 on Win7, I can't reproduce your bug. Are you  
using the latest version of Find by Attribute?

Best wishes,

Anita
