Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis minimal version
Message-ID: <CANNqv9eaGPuS9GC6w3tTGKOSpDEEUNts-mhzgddB=112DvHfGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hell QGIS Developers,


I have couple of questions regarding QGIS and its vector rendering part. I
had posted one mail titled "question on qgis rendering" now with more set of
questions I am starting a new thread
as the title says I need minimal qgis.


does qgis  rasterise the vector data before rendering?

does QGIS paint points to QPixMap and render the image or QGIS directly
draws the point
like painter->drawCircle/point
because QGIS rendering is faster than direct rendering

How to make a minimal qgis version which renders fast enough. I want to
customize QGIS for my needs.

first I want rendering engine of QGIS to be seperate.

Which files are responsible for QGIS rendering a vector data (OGR) ?

Which file opens OGR data?

which is responsible for grabing chips from vector data?

which is responsible for rendering to QGraphicsScene or QPainter?

Does QGIS cache some data when rendering if yes how is done?

I want all technical details of QGIS rendering?

what I need is a custom QGIS with only vector RENDERING no labels, no
attributes, no projection etc. I had made a small vector rendering system
using Qt and GDAL

please review this video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTeYBpSe0kw

I dont need to link my application to qgis_core and build a simple
application on top of QGIS
I need to know everything about QGIS Vector RENDERING and need to build a
new rendering system for vectors. I know my requirement sounds like
reinventing wheels but I need to do it

please dont advice me to use qgis_core.so and build a GUI seperately. I need
to have full control over the code written for rendering.

The reason I am not using qgis_core is nothing but it is difficult for me to
manage bugs if I use qgis_core. on the other hand if I build my own I can
easily track bugs and fix the as soon as possible.

managing qgis_core for a person like me without help of others is a pain!!!



If you cant tell me how to make qgis minimal version, please point me to
qgis very first version and also tell me how to build it...


I hope everyone understandss my requirement. My english is not good so if
you have any doubts please feel free to contact me and will surely reply
back with your answers
Anyone please help me...

I think the last used path for raster should be available, and is the best choice.
See e.g. GDALTools plugin.

the temporary dir is best option for the intermediary outputs, but
the last output(s) should be stored in a directory chosen by the user.

Asking to the user where store that files should be enough when
running the processing from a GUI, but a similar solution may be
adopted when calling the processing-framework API through
python (or even c++).

I think the output dir path should be either an input of the entire
process (e.g. a context variable when piping modules) or stored
in a plugin setting variable (as almost all the plugins do).

Hi,
as you probably know, raster reprojection is using approximate
reprojection to get acceptable rendering speed. Now I am thinking
about a possibility to implement the same also for vectors, to speed
up vectors rendering. What do you think about that? Does it make
sense?

I do not. The real problem seems to me the rendering speed of
big/complex vectors, which can be very slow (overall and also compared
to other GIS packages). Since is available (pseudo)topology is much
slower also the editing of not so big/complex vectors.

This is a very serious question.

I will give my 2ct.

 >What do you think about that? Does it make

I guess absolutely no.

The mix in the same maps of
data reprojected with lost precision
and data not reprojected
will produce wrongly maps.

You are right. I have done some tests and rendering with reprojection
takes obnly about 10% more time. I was convinced that it must be quite
time consuming. In fact, reprojection is a complex caclulation so I am
wondering  what can take so long time in rendering process so that the
reprojection is not significant.

The approximate reprojection is only used if the approximation can be
calculated with a error under certain threshold, for example for
rendering on screen, with an error less than screen pixel size.

... and my 5c.
I haven't looked at the code so the following may be inappropriate, but in
the late 80's my team (Sigmex Ltd) had the world's fastest vector graphics
engine (HW + SW). We were constantly pushing the envelope and validating
against industry accepted benchmarks and real-world tests. 
One area that delivered a surprising 40% overall improvement was the
detection and handling of "single pixel" vectors - if you know the bounding
rectangle will be resolve to a pixel at the zoom level, it simplifies to a
point. This then simplifies 'n' points and lines to a single transformation.
The fastest transformation is the one you didn't need to do and so
skipped... as long as the test is simple and minimal overhead.

It depends a lot on the map to render.

I did a lot of profiling for the FOSS4G WMS benchmark (osm data, reprojected to 
google crs, complex symbology with a lot of rules). The pattern was mostly the 
following:
the rendering itself (QPainter->drawPolyline) was the most time consuming 
operation (appr. 50% of rendering time), next was evaluation in rule based 
renderer (20% of time), getNextFeature in PostgresProvider 10%, coordinate 
transformation 10%.

Marco

Marco,

how did you profile? Using callgind, oprofile or directly measuring
time? If you used callgrind the results may be significantly skewed:
the time spent within postgres provider while waiting for server to
return the features may not be considered.

It was with callgrind.

That might be a valid point. Is it better to use oprofile for the waiting time?

In any case, the other servers in the benchmark had to fetch the features from 
the same database. So there must be very performance critical differences in 
the other parts of the code. As you might know, QGIS didn't really win first 
price...

Do you think we should run this soon or wait for closer to the 2.0 release.
 Ideally I would like to see the QGIS home page redesigned too but it should
really be something that compliments the logo and the feel of QGIS. So maybe
if we get logo done soonish we can look into new designs for the website
that work with the new logo.

I was thinking about posting a blog post about a logo comp and see if we can
get some more funds.

Thoughts?

Hi,

I notice the lasts versions of qgis-dev and also the qgis 1.7.x
has lost some settings for the lines in the new symbology.Infact actually if
is choose the option

"line decoration" is available only color and size.

Instead before was able to choose the offset horizontal and vertical and
also
was available the choos of many symbols.
Not the symbol is only the "right arrow".

I believe you has been using "marker line" symbol layer with the
option to render the marker at the start/end of the polyline. In
contrast "line decoration" always used to be this simple. Given that
"marker line" has superior functionality we will probably remove "line
decoration" completely in future.

Hi Martin,

thx for your response.
Yopu are reason,
more probably I confuse the LineDecoration with the MarkerLine.

In effect the marker-line give all the option of line-decoration.

Sorry for noise.

However I aggre with the option to deprecated  the "LineDecoration"
rendering.

Actually an user could use it (linedecoration) in some styles , instead of a
more useful and powerful "marker-line"

regards,

Hm, I just see that UMN uses a normal select statement (not a binary cursor as 
QGIS does). Don't know if that could make a difference, probably something for 
me to test (the benchmark infrastructur should still be in place).

Marco

Message-ID: <CABqTJk8peDYQ=FTAsKU-A1tVLFsk6atO11sRO42LL6MhXUhX_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a situation of polygon like this:

  -----------------
  |         A      |
  |                |
  |   --------     |
  |  |  B     |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |   --------     |
  |                |
  -----------------

Where the poly A has a hole and the poly-B fill exactly the hole of poly-A

I need to have a labeling like this:

  -----------------
  |       value1   |
  |                |
  |   --------     |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  | value2 |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |   --------     |
  |                |
  -----------------

I try with the label-advanced plugin and use the option Placement "Over".

But it produce instead this situation:

  -----------------
  |                |
  |                |
  |   --------     |
  |  | value1 |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  | value2 |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |  |        |    |
  |   --------     |
  |                |
  -----------------

I don't know if this is a wanted result or not for the "over" placement.
But I guess this is not the better solution , because don't allow to
understand what is the label
of PolyA and the label of PolyB.


Thx,

Andrea.

I also get into this situation, and other similar problems. Short of defining coordinates for my labels, I don't think there is a good answer yet.

(In my cases it's usually only a small number of problem fields in a large dataset and I can't convince myself that it's worth the effort.)

In one of the datasets that I get a situation like this the objects all have straight sides and I usually put the labelling parallel to the edge of the polygon. Would that work as a work-around?

Recently someone committed a fix for labeling that used GEOS intersection
to avoid scanning too many segments for candidates. Since GEOS is involved
already, it could as well be used for GEOSPointOnSurface on the intersection
between the polygon and the viewport. That will give you what you want.

Sounds like worth a ticket on the tracker.

I always thought that Qt4 rendering engine is quite efficient. Also in
my case (I am testing with Shapefile) QPainte::drawPolyline takes only
0.05% (!!!), it seems that I am looking on some wrong results comaring
to your 50%, but I cannot find what am I doing wrong.
Could it be that a different paint device is doing the difference? But
when rendering on screen, we are using QImage or QImage anyway and in
that case graphics card's power is not used, is it?

In my case, with Shapefile, QgsOgrProvider::getNextFeature is taking
over 50% and most of it is strcasecmp in GDAL (probably because of
unnecessary calls from QGIS (for Frank, if you are reading this)). I
believe that it can be optimised, I'll look at it.

Just an experience from GRASS. Once, 'many' years ago, there was in
GRASS the possibility to use PostGIS as a backend to store geometry,
instead of in files. IIRC, first, obviously, we used binary cursor, to
make it more efficient, later we found that it is less efficient than
normal text cursor.

Hi Radim

Did you measure with callgrind or any other tool. Maybe this explains the 
difference (as Martin pointed out).

Both QGIS server and desktop use QImage (except if you have 'fix problem with 
incorrectly filled polygons' checked. In this case QPixmap is used).

I'm not sure how important the graphics card is for 2D rendering. In the wms 
benchmark, the servers with AGG rendering engine performed best. And afaik AGG 
is pure software rendering. I'm however not a computer graphics guru, so maybe 
someone with more insight could correct / comment here.

I remember in last years wms benchmark, we were completely out of the game at 
the shapefile test. Could well be there is some room for improvements here.

Marco

+1 from me to get cracking with it now. blog post sounds good - I can
do the same and maybe we can get Anita to also advertise it on her

Sure, just let me know which sites to link to. Or are we organizing it
ourselves now without a logo designer competition website?

I'll write a post up tonight. I think we should just point people to this
thread or to contact Paolo to handle the money side of things then we can
kick it off.

I don't see a point running it ourself.  I would like to use that
http://99designs.com/logo-design website as there is some really good stuff
on there.  I think we could get good designer coverage then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugins web application
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672npxoeBX0DG+hwwtofugOshgTpSDrD1M2d-r30Qu=-Ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

during last Hackfest in Lisbon, me with Tim and the two Ric[h]?ard?
have been working on the new web infrastructure (plugins.qgis.org),
the work has continued in the last months with bug fixing and other
improvements.

I'm not sayng that this new system is perfect but I'm asking myself
why there is a so strong lack of interest for it. The only time I've
pressed slightly for a shift towards the new system, I've been told it
was too early.

I feel that, even if it could certainly be improved, the new system is
better than the old one and should replace it ASAP.

I'm considering to participate to the next Hackfest in Zuerich in
order to work on that, but I need a clear statement from the steering
comitee about the future of that application.


Any comment/feedback is warmly welcome!

Thanks.

Hi Alessandro,

As a not very good programmer I am probably not that helpful but if I
can help in any way just tell me what to do and I will support you as
I feel you are perfectly right .. we should consolidate and replace
the old system ..
If you want to work on that also in Z?rich - I am there too - maybe I
can help you ..

kind regards
Werner

Message-ID: <4E8B1B74.4010202@jena.de>

Hi all,

I got stuck... From within a Python plugin I want to know the current 
project's selection color. I guess I need the corresponding 
QgsPropertyKeys' values.
Any hints?

regards

Bernhard


P.S. The long way would be to read the project's XML-file and access the 
relevant nodes directly.

OProfile is a system-wide statistical profiler. Being system-wide
means that it profiles all applications (and kernel, too!) running on
the system. So it is able to measure time not only in qgis but also in
postgresql etc. And being statistical means that it is periodically
triggered by hardware and records samples what code is running at each
time. With enough samples you should have quite good idea what is
going on.

However I am not yet sure how to profile i/o waiting times - maybe
strace is a better tool in this regard.

Additionally there is no such nice GUI like kcachegrind for oprofile
output - although op2callgraph tool may be of some use.

Is the benchmark (data + configuration) publicly available? Is it
simple to download it and run on a local machine?

Qt4 rendering should be quite fine performance-wise. But there are
some paint operations that are slow anyway - antialiasing, thick lines
(must be convert to polygon!), drawing with opacity etc. This is a
good reading material:
http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/16/qt-graphics-and-performance-an-overview/
http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2009/12/14/qt-graphics-and-performance-whats-hot-and-whats-not/

In any case we should look into the performance in a more coordinated way:
1. choose a dataset for testing - ideally just 1-3 layers of real data
with lots of features (e.g. 10000+) for each feature type - points,
polylines, polygons. Any ideas for a free dataset?
2. write a benchmark that could be run repeatedly easily - I would
volunteer to provide it
3. test and analyze the results
4. optimize bottlenecks

Which version of GDAL? From 1.8 there are some important enhancements,
mainly in case that the shapefile consists of lots of features.

Please take some time to examine the code before asking these
questions - most of what you want to know can be answered by simply
looking at classes like:

QgsMapRenderer
QgsMapCanvas
QgsVectorLayer

and so on. http://doc.qgis.org/head/ is a good place to start.

In general a few other tips to help you get helped:

- don't write to developers directly unless invited to do so - use the
developer mailing list rather
- we implemented QGIS libraries such as qgis_core to make it easy for
third parties to create new applications based on our codebase.
Separating the vector rendering stuff away from it is possible but its
not going to be trivial and you will be more or less on your own
support wise since it is going way off the mainstream.
- try to not write such long complicated series of questions in a
single email. You can imagine the time investment needed by a
developer to go through all the various things you ask. You would
probably get a better response asking one or two carefully crafted
questions and showing that you have done basic research before coming
to the list with your question.

Anyway hopefully the above will get you started....

Regards

Tim

My understanding is that your fine new plugin repo will be the
official repo of QGIS 2.0 and at some point in the close future master
will point to that repo instead of the old one. I think Borys and
Martin also had some thoughts on it so they will correct me if I got
anything wrong.

We were also going to ask you if you could work on the symbol
repository during the Zurich hackfest if you attend. Look forward to
seeing you there!

IMHO there's only one really missing feature:
more integration between the plugin site and the Redmine trac.

Ok to keep each developer free to choose the preferred
tracking system, but I think that the plugin site should suggest
to create a new project on the Redmine.

Furthermore I'd like if in the plugin details page there's a link to report
an issue or just to go to the trac page (Redmine or whatever).

The plugin site will be the user interface of the "QGis plugins system",
so that kind of integration is required IMHO, it can do the difference!

Just my 2 cents.

+1, I agree with you.

Feel free to use our free datasets at http://www.sogis.ch/daten You just have to register to download, but the data  are all free to use. 
You may use e.g the Cadastral survey data of the City of Solothurn. In the zip you'll find Bo_BoFlaeche_A (ground cover, Polygon), Li_Grenzpunkt (border points of the properties, points). For lines there's e.g. Ei_Linienelement (line elements of the ground cover) or Bo_BoFlaeche_B (the same as Bo_BoFlaeche_A but not polygonized).

Exactly, there were a few discussions and we always decided to not mix plugins 
and use the new repo for 2.0 exclusively.

Message-ID: <24f5e9ef88ad747631c4305e9e55bada@localhost>

Hi all.
After a long time, I'm trying to package qgis for Debian Squeeze, for a
course. We're getting errors:

dpkg-checkbuilddeps: warning: can't parse dependency
libobasis34-en_us-math
dpkg-checkbuilddeps: warning: can't parse dependency

and more. I suspect compilation of globe should be removed from the
package, with its deps. Am I right? Or perhaps we should drop the support
to squeeze altogether?
Many thanks.

We have large point shapefile with lots of features [0], also there is
a polygonal [1] and lines [2] layers

Hi all.
Everybody is welcomed and encouraged to help us improving qgis, also by
opening tickets. Please however check carefully that the issue you report
is really new, and not a duplicate. Failing to do so creates unnecessary
noise, and makes life of developers and ticket maintainers more difficult.
Thanks a lot.

I mean: anyone confirms it's not working on *squeeze*? I know it works on

Hi Andrea

I assume you are using old labeling system (Labels tab in layer
properties) - this one does not handle collisions at all. Try new
labeling instead (menu Layer > Labeling -or- look for the icon in
toolbar) and use "horizontal" or "free" placement - it should do what
you need.

Hi Bernhard

you want want to use something like this:

prj = QgsProject.instance()
r = prj.readNumEntry("Gui", "/SelectionColorRedPart", 255)[0]
g = prj.readNumEntry("Gui", "/SelectionColorGreenPart", 255)[0]
b = prj.readNumEntry("Gui", "/SelectionColorBluePart", 0)[0]
a = prj.readNumEntry("Gui", "/SelectionColorAlphaPart", 255)[0]
clr = QColor(r,g,b,a)

The QgsProject class offers a similar interface to QSettings for
access to properties. The example is mostly self-explanatory except
for the "[0]" at the end of the readNumEntry lines. This function in
python returns a tuple: first value is the number, second value is a
boolean whether the conversion to number went fine - for simplicity we
ignore that flag here.

in the ticket about the performance issue with big vectors

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1978

there is a link to a shapefile that is particularly "heavy" for QGIS

Is there a way set the transparancy based on certain raster values?  I know
that it can be done by setting the rasters Custom transparency options, but
I would like to do it in Python.

Thanks in advance!

I like the idea of having a performance test suite. Ideally there should be 
the possibility to add new datasets / tests (map rectangles, symbologies) to 
it.

The information for the last two benchmarks is here:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Benchmarking_2011
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Benchmarking_2010

The infrastructure is there during the year, so we can always make test runs. 
The configuration for 2011 is not ideal in my opinion, too complicated with 
over 100 layers and some test arrangements are a bit strange (e.g. lots of 
very small rectangles in one test).

Marco

Thanks to all posters.

I just wanted to be sure that our work wasn't for nothing.

To summarize, the web application tasks for Zuerich are:

* new plugin xml/yaml/xml/whatevertextbased config support (is this
still a valid idea?)
* reading tags from the plugins config
* redmine integration (optional)
* git integration ? (is this feasible, interesting ? would be optional anyway)
* symbology repository

did I miss anything ?

please file tickets if you have any feature or bug fixing  request.


@Werner:

your help would be highly appreciated, thank you


See you soon!

Hi all.

> Organization of the metting is starting. 

The wiki states, that the meeting room is available from the 11th. Is there some kind of meeting point in the evening of the arrival day (i.e. the 10th) to start meeting, talking (and maybe even drink something together:-D)?

not directly related to this issue, but very painful when using big
vectors is the "useless canvas redraws" issue

Callgrind, but for shp it should not make a big difference.

Yes this is still valid - the idea is to move plugin's metadata to a
text file that is easier to parse by a machine. In my opinion it
should be the good old INI format which is well supported on both qt
side (QSettings) and python side (ConfigParser).

> * redmine integration (optional)

How should this look like? Wouldn't it be sufficient to prepare a
short document "how to create project in redmine for your plugin" and
auto-fill links to source repository and bug tracker on hub.qgis.org?

> * symbology repository

Surely it would be nice to have. I just want to point out that until
now nobody has come up with a set of requirements and appropriate
design decisions etc.


> did I miss anything ?

I would add one thing: API for uploading new versions of plugins.

In my opinion one reason why many developers did not use the old
plugin repository was that it was slightly inconvenient to upload new
versions - visit the site, login, find the plugin (only 10 plugins per
page), edit plugin details, find the zip file, upload. Having a simple
API accepting POST requests (consisting of username, password, plugin
name, changelog and zip file) would be very handy - that would allow a
simple command line tool for deploying of plugins, completely
automating the process of packaging and uploading.

Hello Martin,

I do not know redmine internals, but if it has an webservice API we
could optionally create the project automatically.

We could also show in the web application appropriate links to the bug
tracker when the link exists.

Please have a look to the tickets in:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues

they are marked as bugs even if are feature requests-

I cannot be of any help here, if someone can write the specs, we can
work on that in Zuerich.

With RPC4Django we can have a fully functional RPC webservice, when
the WS is in place, writing a python/php/bash-wget client would be
easy to do.

Can you please file a ticket for this API ?

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdOOMOFHi07W9rJ0h3XYnGFh5wxDX32hXNCzLiCmz16ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

while looking at the django web apps at plugins.qgis.org I have
collected some thoughts and ideas for improvements:

- plugins.qgis.org started as a domain for plugin repository, now it
has transformed to a multi-app environment. Probably app.qgis.org
domain would suit better the purpose?

- on a related topic, the title and header for all apps is "Quantum
GIS Plugin Repository" - maybe "Quantum GIS - [appname]" would be
better

- the welcome page http://plugins.qgis.org/ is dull. A list with the
app names (+icons?) and a short description may improve the
experience. Or planet could work as a welcome page.

- snippets: what is the state of this app? there are various links
leading to a 404 pages

- plugins: currently the list of plugins lists max 5 plugins per page.
Could this be changed to a higher number, eg. 20?

- plugins: I believe that the plugin list could be greatly simplified.
In my opinion the list should enable users to find interesting plugins
- for that they do not need version number, when the plugin was
created etc. The amount of information makes the important things less
visible - we need to show plugin name (with larger font), icon,
description and maybe author+downloads with a small font. All the
other information can be listed in plugin details page.

Any comments?

Martin

Hi Martin,

Thank you for your comments, I've added below some links to the
existing tickets for some of your thoughts.

ticket filed long time ago:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15

I think that the Home Page should list 5 plugins (latest or popular),
5 snippets (latest), 5 planet posts (latest) and 5 users (latest or
random)

+1 for simplify.

We could also hide/show details with some js tricks.

Hello all,

just wanted to let you know that work on the QGIS processing framework
is continuing. This week I have fixed some simple, but long-pending
issues, like sorting of paramters, distinction between
mandatory/optional/advanced parameters in the GUI, some version
checks, etc.

There has also been a renewed interest in interfacing OTB (Julien) &
grass (Lorenzo) with QGIS using the framework.

Last but not least, there is a new static webpage where you can get
basic information about the project and links to more docs:
http://polymeris.github.com/qgis/

Any comments welcome,

Regards,

Camilo

Thanks for the useful documentation - I look forward to testing it out
and to the integration of OTB!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error/Crash withsimple api command setGeometry
Message-ID: <4E8EB442.4010509@gmail.com>

Hello, a simple question about changing geometry ...

I create a simple point layer, with two point, my simple objective is to 
change the geometry of point 1 by copying the geometry of point 2 into 
geometry of point1.

I select one of my point, and I run this source code into python console :

--

mapC = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
layer = mapC.currentLayer()
provider = layer.dataProvider()
feat = QgsFeature()
provider.nextFeature(feat)

myGeom = feat.geometry()

while provider.nextFeature(feat):
     layer.startEditing()
     feat.setGeometry(myGeom) #replace the feature geometry by the 
geometry of mygeom
     layer.commitChanges()

--

Qgis crash after that, but i don't understand why ??
Can anyone help me on this function setGeometry ?

Thanks a lot,
Best regards,
SR.

Message-ID: <4E8EE95E.1010209@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
If the .shx file is missing for a given .shp, qgis will correctly complain and will
not load the shapefile. Apparently in other sw this issue is solved by rebuilding the
shx[0] (it seems a common problem for CAD users, for instance[1]).
Would it be feasible for qgis to have the same option? I do not think it is supported
by OGR, so possibly it would be better to add it there?
All the best.

This way you can access current list of transparency values:

>>> rt=l.rasterTransparency()

>>> lst = rt.transparentSingleValuePixelList()

>>> for item in lst: print item.pixelValue, item.percentTransparent

...

-9999.0 100.0

0.0 50.0

To set a list with just one value:

>>> x = QgsRasterTransparency.TransparentSingleValuePixel()

>>> x.pixelValue = 123

>>> x.transparencyPercent = 50

>>> rt.setTransparentSingleValuePixelList( [ x ] )


The above examples suppose that you use single band raster. In case of RGB
image the steps are similar, just instead of "SingleValue" methods you would
use "ThreeValue" methods and instead of "pixelValue" attribute there are
"red", "green", "blue" attributes.

 I dont think those are the same SHX files as the .shx components of
Shapefiles...

 A missing .shx file in a shapefile can't easily be reconstructed. The
.shp file is essentially just a big unstructured list of coordinates,
and the .shx gives the start and finish of each feature in that big
list (then the .dbf stores the attributes).

 For a points shapefile it might be easy, since each point is the same
size in the .shp file. But for lines/polygons you'd need to know where
to start each polygons' coordinates in the big .shp file.

Not really. shx file is there just for faster indexing. However I do
not see a reason why shx file couldn't be recovered from a shp file -
it consists of sequentially written records with variable size, each
record has a header stating its length.

I think you can edit gpx if opened through the plugin rather than the open vector route. 

I could easily be mistaken.

It must be possible, as there are utilities that do it, e.g.
http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=10806 and shapecheck.
I do not know if there are free utils though.
All the best.

Agreed, the appearance should be cleaner. More importantly, the various pieces of the
infrastructure should e integrated, avoiding the need to log in various services to
do the most common tasks (e.g. publishing a plugin, opening a redmine instance and a
git(hub) repo, etc.).
All the best.

Yes The great "shapecheck".

I use it from many years to resolve the missing shx file problem.

I can confirm, It work really.

The shx is only a position-link index.
It link the position number of geometry (shp) to the position number of 
fileds (dbf)

There's a tool called shpdoctor put out by the author of spatialite,
it's in the Other or Utilities downloads from the spatialite website.
Not 100% on it's features.

 Wow, I sit corrected! I could have sworn they were fairly
unstructured. Time to read the spec...

"The main file (.shp) contains a fixed-length file header followed by
variable-length
records. Each variable-length record is made up of a fixed-length
record header followed
by variable-length record contents"

 Apologies!

Hi,

Guess another really useful tools should be a tool capable to 
re-organize a dbf following the shp + shx file.

I explain better:

Surely one important option is be able to create the SHX file from the 
SHP and DBF if it is missing.

But also another very interesting situation is when the DBF is 
re-ordered wrongly.

A sample situation is when a user open the DBF using other softwares 
like excel or access or also other similar softwares (openoffice, and so 
on) all DB-manager like capables to understand only the dbf file.

This softwares when save the dbf unfortunately often they re-order the dbf.
This is a very bad situation because after this reorder, the couple 
"shp"+"shx" are not-sync with the "dbf".
And a result of this is that the GIS tools begin the associate the wrong 
record to every geometry.

In this situation, the shp file and the shx file are surely correct. 
They are not touched from a tools DB-only that write the dbf file.

So I guess it should be possible to re-create a correct dbf correct 
ordered following the info of the SHX file.

Andrea.

Hi, reading the specs I guess this is not possible.

I guess Is not possible to re-order the dbf using the shx file.

 Symbology Change Randomly Crashes QGIS
Message-ID: <CAOUWW46s07toNh36rn1jmrb=C6=PFW9-aQTaSUzQm4jMfdwqLg@mail.gmail.com>

I started using QGIS in Mint 11.

UbuntuGIS >> Unstable << 1.7.1-1~natty1



I have found it to be more stable than on OS X, however I am getting the
same issues as on OS X 10.5.x - 10.6.x

Changing the symbol of a somewhat large data set will randomly hard crash
QGIS.

Time to buy a copy of Windows I guess :)  (or have people found this on
Windows too?)

All in All QGIS is really looking great.

Love the new symbology, and rules.

Hold on to your $, I doubt that the behavior would be any better on
windows, especially if it's a bug (Not to mention that 64 bit is not
readily available on that platform).

Could you provide more details on the format of the dataset, how many
features and which particular symbology component causes the issue?

A sample dataset would be great too, if possible post it to a server
somewhere that devs can get a copy to test with.

If you're interested, building a copy of qgis from source with
DEBUG=TRUE might also provide more details when the crash occurs.
This procedure is quite easy on Ubuntu based linux.

Thanks,
Alex

He might also put his $ on a bugfix bounty, the more coins stack up
there the quicker the bug will be fixed.

I can't say it's best practice but I have done it before.  You will need
remove the legendlayer and use the layerid= to find any links to that legend
item ie maplayer.  You will also need to change the "projectlayers
layercount="83""

I have cc'd this to the developer mailing list in case someone on there
knows something that might help, before you start hacking away at things.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] identify tool issues with WMS layers
Message-ID: <1318371129.2048.5.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I just noticed the following with qgis-trunk under both Linux and
Windows:

The identify tool does return always

"GetFeatureInfo results: Search returned no results." 

if the WMS is reprojected on the fly (if not reprojected the tool
returns the expected values).

Moreover, if in the TOC is present a layer from the "openlayers plugin"
plugin (active or not), the identify tools does not work at all.


Cheers

   - I would be more likely to donate to QGIS if I could actually find a
   place to donate on hub.qgis.org


I don't write checks so unless there is a way to pay cash or PayPal I
probably will not.

I will try building QGIS on Linux Mint with the debug flag set true,
It would be really sweet if I could highlight the exact issue that seems to
re-occur.

More Info on Data set issues:


   - Usually Shapefiles, although I have noticed this occur while using
   Postgis layers also (GML/XML)
   - I usually am dealing with data sets with 5000+ features
   - Symbology crash has occurred with Line, Poly, and Point data sets
   - Sometimes the crash with occur on the very first symbology change
   sometimes after quite a few hours and many symbology changes
   - Will occur for me when I change one of the following or any combination
   of, Transparency, Colour, Rules, Old Symbology or New Symbology
   - Hard Crash always occurs when selecting "OK" or "Apply" never at any
   other moment while changing the symbology.
   - I have had this issue since 1.4


Here is a moderately sized data set from GeoBC data warehouse that you can
test.
http://www.mediafire.com/?23jtegqv7e8qqep

Thanks for your time, besides the crashing all the time with symbology, QGIS
is my favourite GIS.

	using PIHM
Message-ID: <AAFD34025E073F47B5F892A97BAFFCAA625FFB@aklserver02.Synergine.local>

Hi everyone,
I just want to let you know about a QGIS plugin for integrated catchment
modelling.  Some of you may have seen it already, but it seems to be
sort of languishing in obscurity.  I didn't see any mention of it in the
normal QGIS community places; only in a number of academic papers.

It originally comes from here:
http://www.pihm.psu.edu/pihmgis_home.html
Their binary and source packages are both very messy and include a very
old version of QGIS, and the source package for some reason isn't the
latest version of the plugin.
I *think* the original authors may have abandoned the QGIS plugin in
favour of a web-based system.
However, there is a public fork of the latest version here, including a
windows and a linux binary:
https://github.com/mlt/PIHM/wiki
I guess he must have contacted the authors to obtain the source.  He has
cleaned up the file tree and done some fixes, including so that it
builds with msvc, and doesn't violate the GPL.  (I wish I'd found this
earlier, because I started doing the same thing...)

The plugin provides terrain analysis features similar to the TauDEM
plugin for Mapwindow and ArcGIS (but without the fully automatic mode):
pit removal, stream network and watershed delineation, etc.  
It also runs the "Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model", and can
produce a number of time series and spatial plots of the results.

I recommend using the tutorial (and sample data) available on the web
site:
http://www.pihm.psu.edu/pihmgis_documents.html
The built-in help documentation is the same, but is missing the
pictures!
This might also be useful:
http://www.pihm.psu.edu/Downloads/Doc/pihm_input_file_format.pdf

There are a number of interesting papers which mention it, and often
have a short description of QGIS itself, e.g.:

Community Hydrologic Model: Structure
http://cuahsi.org/chymp/thurs/RMaxwell.ppt
Multiphysics Modeling Implications for Environmental Observatories
http://cuahsi.org/chymp/wed-am/CDuffy.pdf

Susquehanna - Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory

The Role of Physical, Numerical and Data Coupling in a Mesoscale
Watershed Model
http://www.personal.psu.edu/muk139/Mukesh_PIHM_Dec01_2009.pdf

And this one doesn't mention it, but I know there are some people here
interested in parallelization ;) :

Hydrologic Models on Parallel Processors

Hi Alister

Thank you for the interesting link, downloading the code right now. Seems to 
be a good candidate to integrate with the analysis lib.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis Web Client Projection Problem
Message-ID: <1318405893103-6883938.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hello,

I am a new user of Qgis web-server and Qgis Web-client, which is an amazing
ang easy tool for web mapping.

However, my idea is to put on a server different map which can consequently
have many different projection. 

So, I have seen that I can't have one qgis project file with one projection
(for example EPSG:32648) and the default projection value in globaloption.js
of Qgis Web-client equal to EPSG:4326 for example.

So, in order to show my layer, I need to have same projection in my qgis
project and in the globaloption.js. This means that I need to change every
times the default projection value in globaloption.js when I change of qgis
project (if the projection is different).

Consequently, I would like to know if this problem is a mistakes of me or a
missing feature of Qgis Web-client ?

Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.

Message-ID: <CAG4NReKa+C_L0wUyo7eHsAUQ5+OMqvbd0Jz=OM-dkANhOUqa7g@mail.gmail.com>

HI!
I've found that when I have a vector of polygons displayed as unfilled
(only the boundaries are shown) and unclick it
in the TOC ("Layers"), often (but not always!) the display does not
refresh and have to click and unclick again in the TOC to undisplay
the layer.
Has anybody else  experienced this? Just checking before filling a bug report.
This problem occurs with qgis 1.7.1 and I think that it was present in
1.7.0 also, for sure not in 1.6.* (ubuntu 10.04 LTS binaries from
ubuntugis-unstable)

Thanks

Confirmed: if you disable renderer caching, it disappears.

yes, it has already been reported here but, as you say, is very
unpredictable. I guess there is already a ticket, but not 100% sure.

If you find a way to replicate it regularly please let us know.

Message-ID: <CAG4NReK_9=qkz-J5P=t9hWUn+K3vEXNWqvtxO1LL4jRS5ztrJQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm delighted of having found out accidentally that PgUp and PgDn
keys actually zoom in and out, respectively. But these keys are not
listed in Configure Shortcuts. Could this option be listed and then
we could close Bug #1824 (regarding the behaviour of Ctrl++, which
is Ctrl+9 by default now)?
The last comment in that thread was suggesting zooming in by hitting Ctr++ twice
(I've always personally found that Ctrl++ just switching to "+"  and then having
to use the mouse to actually zooming was pretty useless, and hitting Ctrl++
twice was kind of compromise). But this is old and unneeded if PgUp
does the actual zooming.

Weird, I actually find the opposite: enabling renderer caching solves
the problem.
If render caching is disabled, then you have to click and unclick
twice the first time
for each layer (of the type previously described). From then on, it
works normally for a while.
But if you do not refresh that layer for a while, then you have to
click and unclick twice again.
Confirmed with many layers.

Hi all.
Until recently, in Vector properties we had two Diagrams tabs (one old,
no PAL, one new, with autoplacement). Now I only see one. Redicing
duplication is a *good thing*, and users will be happy about it. The
problem is, some features (histograms, scalable SVGs) are missing from
the new implementation.
Is this only a transition, and there are plan to complete the features
of new Diagrams, or?
Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <1318490501577-6887903.post@n2.nabble.com>

I need help to create tables (both geometric and geometryless)  in my  C++
plugin. I have a very big data set and it has been difficult to use either
flat file (for the geometryless data) or shapefile (for the geometric data)
and I do not want to use PostGIS since I will pass the data to a colleague
far away who is not database proficient. 

Here is a piece of code that I scavenged from PyQGis Cookbooks manual and
spatialite provider. But I do not see how to go about creating tables. I am
checking the Spatialite manuals  

	QgsDataSource myuri;
	QgsDataSourceURI splUri = QgsDataSourceURI( myuri );
	
	QString spliteDBName = "C:/tmp/qgis/splite.db";
	splUri.setDatabase(spliteDBName);
	splUri.setDataSource('',"TripTable", "Geometry")
	vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(splUri(), "TripTable", "spatialite");

Is there a little bit documentation that will help? Any feedback is
appreciated,

Maaza

All the best.

Hi Paolo,

We have a bug tracker for Time Manager at:

http://www.geofrogger.net/trac/

Could you describe in a bit more detail how to reproduce this error?

Best wishes,

Anita

Several weeks ago a new functionality has been included into QGIS that
allows creation of new tables using one interface - look for
QgsVectorLayerImport class in core library. The disadvantage is that
it is not yet available in any release. Alternatively you could still
open a spatialite database with sqlite api and manually run the sql
query to create a table you need.

In case you need to also create new spatialite database at the same
time, there's no api for that (yet). You can either create it in QGIS
app manually (including the tables), if you insist on automatic
creation then you will need to create the spatialite database using
sqlite api - some inspiration may be found in
src/app/spatialite/qgsnewspatialitelayerdialog.cpp.

This should work:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer('dbname="/data/gis/test.sqlite"
table="mytable"', 'mytable', 'spatialite')

Hi All,

I was trying to use the offline editing plugin for some field work but it
doesn't seem to want to convert the layers to offline for me.

The layers are all MapInfo .TAB files when running convert to offline the
plugin sits for a while then goes back to the map canvas.  This is the
output in my Windows XP DebugView:

Seems if you do the same with using Shapefiles everything works fine.

Anyone had this problem before?

What exactly the name of this plugin?

I typed "offline" in the filter for QGIS python plugin installer,
nothing is showing up.

It is installed by default with QGIS 1.5+ so it will be in the Plugin
Manager under "offline"

Hi,


the tool is meant to work with Postgis layers, when you don't have
connection to the server.

If it throws an error when you have mapinfo files in the project, then
you may want to file a ticket.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] various problems during a course
Message-ID: <1318576894.8422.36.camel@fox>

Hi all.
Today, during a course, I spotted several problems:
- the plugin Elevation does not take into account the proxy setting, so
it does not work (known problem[0]) and it locks QGIS, forcing a
restart; I suggest to fix it or, if impossible, to deprecate it
- opening a 
- the plugin CSW client does not connect (I'm behind a proxy, do not
know what's going wrong) with error:

Error connecting to server geocat.ch: [same for others]

<urlopen error timed out>

- the tile scale apparently does not work
- invert color map (in raster properties) option seem bugged: the flag
is unchecked when closing the window

Hi all.
I set up the proxy in qgis, and everything is working, except for the
Elevation plugin (as I already wrote) and WPS plugin: do they both use
another method for accessing the web, bypassing the proxy setting?
All the best.

I was able to create the spatialite geometry/geometryless tables outside QGIS and now what I would want is to be able to insert data in C++ into tables with and without geometry.

Any ideas?

Hi Paolo,

I remember having some difficulties too with proxy settings and the WPS 
plugin.
I did not look at the code, but the WPS plugin honors the http_proxy env 
var setting.

Also, I'm wondering whether it should always honor the QGis proxy 
settings (nor the http_proxy env var) : for my use case, I'm trying to 
reach a WPS server inside my LAN, while I need proxy settings to access 
the web (plugin installation, etc...).
Maybe each server configured in the plugin should have an associated 
local/remote boolean setting.

Strange as it can be, for my "LAN case", the GetCapabilities and 
DescribeProcess calls works, but http_proxy must be correctly unset only 
for ExecuteProcess request to work correctly.

Cheers,
Julien

Load the table to QGIS (i.e. create a QgsVectorLayer - even for
geometryless table) and then use layer.dataProvider().addFeatures( ...
) method.

Hi Paolo 

Yes you are right. The WPS-Client isnt able to connect through proxy. I plan to extend the plugin at the hackfest

 Elevation uses the python httplib, which requires you to first set up
a connection to the proxy and then do a query with the full
http://blah/blah URL, instead of setting up a connection to the web
server and then getting just the path.

A change to Elevation.py to use urllib (which is imported, but not
used) works for me - but I'm not sure if its getting my proxy settings
from Qgis's settings or from my shell's proxy settings. Either way, it
works:

Around Line 85:

url = "http://maps.google.com/maps/api/elevation/json?locations=" +
str(pt[1])+","+str(pt[0])+"&sensor=false"
u = urllib.urlopen(url)
jsonresult = u.read()

urllib2 might be another possible option. I've CC'd Steffen, the
elevation plugin author in on this.

A better approach would be to use Qt classes for network I/O (i.e.
QNetworkRequest and friends) together with QgsNetworkAccessManager
that knows qgis proxy settings - then the plugin does not have to
worry about proxies. Additionally those Qt classes provide a
convenient interface using signals and slots.

Thanks Martin for the info. Now how what are the parameters for the 
If I have a table named Trips and I want to add data to the three columns
i,j,v it contains. 
I set the datasource as like this? But I get error message when I try to
query the fields from the provider. 

	QgsDataSource uri;
	QgsDataSourceURI splUri = QgsDataSourceURI( uri );
        splUri.setDatabase(spliteDBName);
        splUri.setDataSource("","Trips", ""); // I set the schema and the
geometry to empty? 
	QgsVectorLayer* tripLayer = new QgsVectorLayer(splUri.uri(), "Trips",
"spatialite");
	QgsVectorDataProvider* triProv = tripLayer->dataProvider();
	QgsFeature tripFeat;
	QgsFeatureList tripFeats ;
	QgsAttributeMap tripAttMaps;
	QgsFieldMap tripFldsrc = triProv->fields();  ***************  Error at this
location!
	if (tripFldsrc.count()>0)
	{
		i=0;
		for (QgsFieldMap::iterator it = tripFldsrc.begin(); it !=
tripFldsrc.end();it++)
		{
			tripAttMaps.insert(i++,it->type());
		}

	}
	for (maptrit = maptrip.begin();maptrit != maptrip.end();maptrit++)
	{
		trip = maptrit->second;
		tripFeat.addAttribute(0,trip.get_i());
		tripFeat.addAttribute(1,trip.get_j());
		tripFeat.addAttribute(2,trip.get_v());
		tripFeats.append(tripFeat);
	}
	tripLayer->addFeatures(tripFeats);
	bool blnFeat = tripLayer->commitChanges();
	if (!blnFeat)
	{
		txtStream<<"Failed to commit to Layer
\t"<<tripLayer->name().toStdString()<<endl;
		return;
	}


I also wanted to know if it was possible to string the sql commands to
insert into the table.

Thank you,

Hi,

I installed the qgis Server and apache (ubuntu 11.04) and now I don't
know how to start the qgis webserver.

I tried
http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.f ... pabilities

as described here
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/QGIS_Server_Tutorial

But there is an internal Server error 500.
Does anybody here know what that could mean?

What should I do as first steps after installing?

best regards

if working correctly, the address 

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

should return

<ServiceExceptionReport version="1.3.0"><ServiceException
code="OperationNotSupported">Please check the value of the REQUEST
parameter</ServiceException></ServiceExceptionReport>

Then just create a project in QGIS (use absolute paths) and in the
project properties configure the parameters in the "WMS server" tab.

Create a folder in

/usr/lib/cgi-bin/

and copy into it your QGIS project and a copy of qgis_mapserv.fcgi

your server address will be


http://localhost/cgi-bin/myprojectfolder/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

Unfortunately currently this does not work correctly for goemetryless
tables (the produced URI is malformed), therefore I advise you to
directly create URI string as mentioned in my earlier mail:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer('dbname="/data/gis/test.sqlite"
table="mytable"', 'mytable', 'spatialite')


> ? ? ? ?tripLayer->addFeatures(tripFeats);
> ? ? ? ?bool blnFeat = tripLayer->commitChanges();

Here I would suggest to use directly tripProv->addFeatures( ... )
instead of using layer's addFeatures() method. This way you will
bypass layer's in-memory editing buffer and the operation will be
faster. I would like to explain the difference in the cookbook,
hopefully it will be added soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] save as... dxf: output does not open in cad
	software
Message-ID: <1318637088.1853.170.camel@sibirica>

Hi,

During a training course I have been pointed that almost any vector
saved as dxf in QGIS (using "save as..."), does not open in Autocad. I
have tested myself with an Autodesk free viewer (Free DWG Viewer), and
the message is like

Invalid database handle 0 on line 1548.
Invalid or incomplete DXF input -- drawing discarded.

The same seems to happen in other CAD software like LivreCAD (under
Linux), but not if you open it back in QGIS.

Translating the vector to DXF with ogr2ogr leads to a file that opens
fine in CAD software. Ex:

ogr2ogr -f "DXF" teste10.dxf TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp


I'll file a ticket about this issue.

cheers

Hi Christopher

This error message shows that it works (you just did not make a valid WMS 
request). To publish your project, you need to give the file path to the .qgs 
project in the url and the wms request parameters.

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/home/me/myproject.qgs&

is the WMS url

http://localhost/cgi-
bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/home/me/myproject.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

should return an xml document with the available layer, styles, crs, etc.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

thank you this works. Is there a more comfortable way of displaying a
map - with a web-frontend-page or do I have to type in every command
manually like this

e.g.:
http://localhost/cgi-bin/world/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&
REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-36.215710,6.817432,-9.700450,58.551008&
CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=1077&HEIGHT=552&LAYERS=Continent,Country,Cities&
STYLES=,,&FORMAT=image/jpeg&DPI=96

It seems to be very complicated and time consuming to work like this (as
I'm a big GUI-fan)

Best regards
Christopher

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bison 2.3 error When Building QGIS for Snow Leopard
Message-ID: <CAOUWW46+m+JM9etnqu09iEeAHczCxU64bA3uTnWhw8VwOf23hQ@mail.gmail.com>

I been running through the Build instructions for QGIS Mac OS X on the QGIS
Wiki,


** I remembered to comment out "QwtSVGItem" in the qwtconfig.pri file as it
stumbles on finding the x_86_64 framework from the universal framework.


However when building QGIS I receive an error that Snow Leopard only has
BISON 2.3 and at least 2.4 is needed.


I built 2.4.3 Bison but error still throws, unable to find the new Bison
build?


Just wondering what my next best step is?


I would like to build QGIS with debug flag to help find better crash info.


Thanks!!


Mars

I found that cmake still uses the system bison even if a different one is first in the PATH.  You need to force cmake to use yours with a configure option:

-D BISON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/bison

assuming you installed bison 2.4 in /usr/local.

I haven't tried compiling since the spatialindex changes.  Looks like I need to...

Or, if you want to get more helpful output from compilation, add this to configuration:

-D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true

make will them show you all the compile commands and more detailed errors.

The debug build is (replace the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE option with this):

-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Once your service is up and running any WMS client can consume it.
Quickest way to test, add the WMS layer to QGIS. There are lots of other
options out there desktop, web, etc.

The most common web client being Openlayers, this will require work on
your part, mainly a few lines of javascript in a web page. You might be
able to use it directly in Geocommons or in Mapfish (also takes setup).

I believe there is work on a qgis-web-client but nothing I know of that
can be installed and run out of the box yet.

All kind of depends on your end goal, is it to produce a web page and/or
provide a WMS for others to connect to?

Enjoy,
Alex

This is how Tim used it for OpenLayers client (below).

Very few documentation how to actually use in OpenLayers and WMS.

Hi Christoper

As others pointed out, there are many WMS clients with a graphical interface.
QGIS webclient provides a java script client adapted to the possibilities of 
QGIS server (e.g. web based printing is supported out ot the box).

Source code and documentation are here:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client

Regards,
Marco

Hi Anita.
Reproducing the issue is very simple on this machine:
- load a raster (in my case, .adf)
- do not configure anything on the time manager
- press Play.
The problem is that the error is repeated many times (one per frame?), 
so QGIS has to be killed.
A question remain: why do you keep such an interesting work in a 
non-standard (so hidden to many users) repo?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Martin.
Could you add this to a wiki page on "How to write and improve a QGIS 
plugin", "Plugin coding standards", or the like?
Thanks.

I get this output:

When I click on the links "natural earth" or wms get capabilities" there
comes an error page "not found".

Can you tell me how I display my qgis project file with this web-client?
I didn't understand their documentation.

Hi Paolo

For actions which might take a few seconds, I prefer to have 'apply'. E.g. if 
there is a map which takes several seconds to draw, it is more convenient to 
only refresh it on request (or when leaving the dialog). Otherwise, the user 
has to wait too long for every setting that is changed.

Regards,
Marco

agreed, but in the case mentioned the result is almost instantaneous in

You mean the 'classify' buttons in the graduated symbol(ng)dialog? I have some 
large datasets where it takes 20s to go through all features...

yes, but this is also true for many other "live" operations. shouldn't 
we have more predictable behaviour?
in my experience, many users tend to overlook the Apply button, and get 
confused.

Can you point out specific dialogs in which you are referring to?
Do these buttons also have OK which also applies the changes?
I think re-application if nothing has changed should be avoided on OK if
Apply was already used.

However the Apply button itself may be an issue for only new users, and
possibly something worth learning.

QGIS is hardly the only application with this methodology and it does
have it's benefits, especially when large classification operations do
not come out the way you want without lots of hand changes. Now keeping
the Apply button grayed out until a change is made makes sense in all
use cases to me.

Thanks,
Alex

I see in the numerous course I'm doing that people generally find it 
annoying.
Obviously not a major issue, but I think we should start streamlining 
all the dialogs.

That's exactly my point, are you teaching people new to GIS or long time
GIS users? Also could you list a few specific dialogs, I'm curious to
pull them up and ponder methods for stream-lining.

I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement, I just want to make
sure we don't mess up things that Power users rely on.

Unlike the recent Gnome/Unity debacle in Ubuntu.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi everybody,

in my PlugIn I want to switch on labels automatically and place them with
the new label engine.
But it seems to me that new Labeling classes (QgsPalLabeling and so on) are
not available in python yet.
Are there any plans to do this?
Should I create a ticket for this?

Thx

Michael

Hi Michael

You may set the labeling-ng properties from python with 
QgsMapLayer::setCustomProperty(...). If you open a .qgs file which has a label-
ng layer, you see that all the labeling options are set as custom properties 
of the layer.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the OrfeoToolbox plugin
Message-ID: <4E9D582F.600@c-s.fr>

Hello all,

We are pleased to announce the availability of the OrfeoToolbox [1] Qgis 
plugin.

This plugin is based on the already available "Processing Manager" 
plugin [2], which can also provide access to the SAGA modules.
It's a Python plugin which can be installed through the Python Plugin 
Installer (but need a required OTB Python package installed on your system).
The plugin is hosted in the Faunalia repository, next to the "Processing 
Manager" and the "SAGA Module interface" plugins.

Installation instructions for the backend Python package are given in [3].
In particular, an OSGeo4W-compatible binary is provided on a nightly 
basis at [4], so Windows users can install and test it in a few minutes.
Testing it on Linux involves more work (see [3]), but we are working on 
providing Ubuntu binary packages to ease the installation process on 
this platform.

The plugin provides access to a set of modules wrapping different kind 
of functionnalities of the Orfeo Toolbox.

As of now, modules are available to perform the following tasks :
- P+XS Pan Sharpening
- Orthorectification
- Optical Calibration
- KMeans clustering
- SVM Supervised Classification
- Mean Shift segmentation
- Change Detection (Multivariate Alteration Detector algorithm)
- Hyperspectral data unmixing
- Filtering (mean, gaussian, anisotropic diffusion)
- Raster conversion and scaling

This is only the beginning and new modules will be added regularly to 
expose most of the OTB functionnalities in easy to use application modules.

Many thanks to Camilo for providing the Processing Manager Framework, 
and to Paolo and Giuseppe for helping on the plugin packaging.

We will be glad to hear your feedback !

Best regards,
Julien

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rubberband in composermap
Message-ID: <1318947935029-6904800.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi everybody,

it seems that there's no rubberband in the print composer anymore.
Looks like it has been deleted in 
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/b02d06ba73054ad5c85790d3508fd3555b5b28ea
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/b02d06ba73054ad5c85790d3508fd3555b5b28ea  
I think for some cases rubberband is useful in print composer.
In my case I want to highlight a polygon that the user has selected in a
gui.
For this polygon a map should be produced in which the polygon is
highlighted.
Any thoughts about that?

regards

Michael

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wcqH4xSbcyunue7gP7knD_m5DScZwNHdv1UrERkXoEQg@mail.gmail.com>

I haven't found the time to setup a fresher qgismapserver, but looking at
the source code in trunk I can't see what's causing this.

It seems that, inside the fcgi loop, a configuration for a requested MAP
confipath is searched inside the cache instance. In case it's found the
result is directly returned, otherwise a new cache entry is created and
returned.
I would expect this should work, but before I will build the trunk version I
would like to know if it's solved indeed.

thanks,
Giovanni

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=wxv6tWH4W59iWB=4fV4njzWrfY4DACLBTbL1d0vr8OpA@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I've come back on the problem of compiling CPython extensions for
Python25, which is the actual python version for Osgeo4w.
As you know it requires older versions of MSVC 1310 then VS 2008/2010, and
it's a bit problematic because setting up the old VS 2003 Toolkit is a bit
problematic.
I wonder what build chain is being used for the Qgis Python bindings under
Osgeo4w, wether MSVC 1310 or MinGW or something different.  It would be
useful to build the Python bindings for SAGA...

yes, the SDA4PP plugin would need to be revised because it is source of

Dear Martin:
I tried every way I can think of and I have not been able to use the
non-geometric table .

Here is the code I am using let me know if you think I am doing something
wrong,


	QString spliteDBName = "C:/db/sjs.db";
	QString tblName = "tztrips";
	QString dbProv = "spatialite";
	QString schema = "dbname=\'" + spliteDBName +"\'  table=\'" + tblName +
"\'";
	QgsVectorLayer* tztripLayer = new QgsVectorLayer(schema, tblName, dbProv);
	if (!tztripLayer->isValid())
	{
		txtStream<<"Spatialite Layer \t"<<tztripLayer->name().toStdString()<<"\t
is invalid!"<<endl;
		return;
	}

It will report that the layer is invalid. If I use the a geometry table it
still does the same. 

But I have the geometry file working using the Uri and I am content with
that. 

Any help is greatly appreciated,

Maaza

Hi Giovanni

QGIS server uses the QFileSystemWatcher class ( 
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qfilesystemwatcher.html) to check if a configuration 
file has changed. So in newer versions, changes to the published project files 
should be picked up without restarting apache.

Regards,
Marco

  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 138, in
startPlugin
    plugins[packageName] = package.classFactory(iface)
  File "/home/alobo/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/__init__.py", line 76,
in classFactory
    from plugin import SAGAPlugin
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 283, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
  File "/home/alobo/.qgis/python/plugins/saga/plugin.py", line 31, in
    import processingmanager.processing as processing
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 283, in _import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: No module named processingmanager.processing


I assume I just have to uninstall 0.21 (the plugin gets installed
despite the error, which is unusual)

To be more precise: if I zip layers without .prj, the prj is not added. 
I think it should, and it would be easy to do it.
We still do not have a bugtracker for pugins, do we?
All the best.

Thanks Marco,
I supposed it watching the source code. But what about the need to reload
apache if I send a different MAP request (i.e. a differnet configuration
file)? It should work too, am I wrong?

Hi Giovanni

>It should work too, am I wrong?

Yes, the MAP parameter should be considered too.

Hi,

I noticed that QgisServer doen't take enabled layers from project file, but
the user should enable them in the web client.

Another request: is it possible to hide some layers from TOC in the web
client (but they are visible in map)?

Hi Noli,

which parts in this code do I have to modify for my Qgis Server Project?
I pasted this code into a html (index2.html) file within var/www/  but
there is nothing displayed when I open

localhost/index2.html

best regards
Christopher

Hi Christopher,

The code that I posted is not complete.

Did you include OpenLayers.js and CSS for the openlayers?

Visit this link and to see the whole code,

http://linfiniti.com/2011/09/qgis-server-with-tilecache/

It seem the link is not working now. However, you browse the any
openlayers example and see how the post that I copied from Tim's is
used.

Noli

Hi all.
More minor issues:
- if I edit label properties with the button (close to rotate label), 
the label disappears
- the random colour ramps are generally ugly, and often colours are repeated
- a button "Randomize" is missin for random colour ramps (currently one 
has to change the number of classes to have a new ramp)
- in the editing widgets, the slider does not work
- the measure area tool seems to be wrong when started with the 
ellipsoid off (measures are doubled); switching ellipsoid on and off 
again brings back the good value.
If I get confirmations of the above I'll open tickets (but will not mind 
if someone else will do it sooner).
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Magic entry for QuantumGIS project files
Message-ID: <20111019091907.GA2599@gnash>

Hi Daniel, I was wondering how to approach installation of new
entries in the magic(5) file for better integration of QuantumGIS.

I've filed a bug on qgis tracker:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4407

Am I right there's no provision for automating installation of entries
from packages ? Are there major obstacles for that ? What's the correct
approach to request "recognition" of a format in the magic file ?

Thanks in advance.

Hello Agus,

The version to use is of course the last one : 0.26.
I don't see several versions in the plugin installer.

The directory in which the 'Processing Framework Manager' is installed 
has been renamed recently, from processingplugin to processingmanager.
This may be the root of the problem.

Can you double-check your $HOME/.qgis/python/plugins directory ?
After installing the 0.26 version, you should not see any directory 
named "processingplugin". Just "processingmanager".
If so, maybe just deleting it will make the 0.21 reference go away.

Julien

Hi Noli,

Thanks, I did this and came to this point:

*sudo cp /home/timlinux/dev/cpp/qgis/src/mapserver/wms_metadata.xml .
Now edit that file and set your details as appopriate.
*


Which would be "appropriate details" for me?

best regards
Christopher

yes - it is on our todo-list. The idea would be to expose the
information of layer visibility in the GetCapabilities response - but
the hard thing is to do this in a way that is conformant with the WMS
standard - it probably means to introduce another vendor-specific
extension. Any ideas how to solve it?

this is currently not possible. Any idea how to achieve this in a
generic and transparent way? I guess one way would be that again we add
a vendor-specific extension and mark those specific layers. QGIS
webclient would hide these layers in the tree but always add them in the
GetMap request. But then these layers would always be visible and the
user wouldn't have any control ...

the bugtracker is available, it is needed to create the plugins
projects in Redmine. A few weeks ago I was starting opening the
projects but then I was suddenly overwhelmed by work. During the HF I
want to take care of this matter.

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xq6b82dQQTUZY3nmwDZmcdH7ysBSfxwdW8E8J=9jqcjQ@mail.gmail.com>

These days I'm studying the QGis server architecture, and I was wondering on
using it beyond its WMS features.
I suppose that exposing other functionalities through it's (fast)cgi
interface is trivial, and being able to run python scripts from the qgis
internal python interpreter coul be interesting.
Some proprietary gis servers already let users publish scripts accessible
through web services, and I imagine that it could be done through Qgis
server too.
Before going on, I would like to receive comments on this, and invetigate
eventual blocking issues for this feature given the actual Qgis server
architecture.

Hello!

I'm trying to get Openlayers work with spatialite to get it on the tablet
vectorial data,
and i have a question concerning the handling of event add point.
I'm using this example
http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/mobile-drawing.html
I want to add a handler for the event, point added, i thought it could be a
think like :

map.events.register("done", map, function() { 
	alert("Point added !");
	});
but didn't work..

( i tryed to read this
http://projects.opengeo.org/vespucci/browser/lib/OpenLayers/Handler/Point.js?rev=1
...)

Any idea please!

I believe that GetCapabilities should only be used to describe what
layers are available on each server. For the definition of layers
which should be displayed in a client was defined ViewContext (Web Map
Context), from specification:

"There are several possible uses for Context documents:
- The Context document can provide default startup views for
particular classes of user. Such a document would have a long lifetime
and public accessibility.
- The Context document can save the state of a viewer client as the
user navigates and modifies map layers.
- The Context document can store not only the current settings but
also additional information about each layer (e.g., available styles,
formats, SRS, etc.) to avoid having to query the map server again once
the user has selected a layer.
- The Context document could be saved from one client session and
transferred to a different client application to start up with the
same context."

Each layer in ViewContext has 'hidden' attribute:

"6.4.1 Layer
Layers attributes are
- hidden : contains true if the layer should be hidden in the client
result map (required)"

BTW, this would be also probably the right way to give external URLs
for WMS layers to the client.

I am not big fan of standards and XML, but in this case it should be
probably at least considered. Sooner or later you reach a limit in
ViewContext.

I have a similar question, but not the same, if I got it.

I am thinking about a possibility to write a wrapper around the QGIS
mapserver in Python. I mean a possibility to process a request before
it is passed to QGIS MS core and process result before it is sent back
to client. Practically Python bindings for QGIS mapserver. Basically
the same like UMN MapServer mapscript in Python. Are you planning
something like that?

Usually it is always necessary to add an additional functionality for
each project and the possibility to do it in Python would be the best
IMO.

I was thinking to both the ways:

 - expose geoprocessing directly through QGIS MS (either C++ plugins or
Python plugins)
 - provide a Python mapscripting for QGIS MS (as you're saying)

I think the two ways are complementary.
The latter would let you "control" QGIS MS, and proxy requests, exactly the
same as Mapserver/Mapscript.
The first one would let you also expose code written for QGis Desktop. For
example, you could expose the features provided by the Processing Framework
(OTB, SAGA, etc.), or the code inside QGis Analysis.

I think that practically a common architecture could respond to both the
functionalities: add qgispython interface to Qgis MS, as it is available for
Qgis Desktop. This way you can call Python from Qgis and viceversa.

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFez_rOcPV0xN6H8k-F7W5K08GaqRN_ptHZ_mtxf1kDt6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

looking at the amount of time (~6 months) and commits (~900) since the
1.7 release I am wondering whether it would not be reasonable to make
also 1.8 release. Originally we wanted 1.7 to be the last 1.x feature
release, however the master branch is in a good shape and no API
breakage happened until now. Once we will start breaking things it
will take some time (e.g. 6-9 months) until we will be able to release
2.0 and it would be a shame not to deliver the recent goodies for such
a long time.

This is an incomplete list of main new features in master branch since 1.7:
- globe plugin
- road graph plugin
- zonal stats plugin
- browser (dock widget + standalone app)
- customization
- lots of server updates
- symbology: ellipses with data-defined fields, line patterns, point patterns
- 64-bit feature ids
- expressions instead of search strings
- generic import layer
- plenty of bugfixes and small improvements

If there is a consensus I guess the release could happen soon,
sometime in mid-November.

Objet : [Qgis-developer] 1.8 release?

Hi devs

looking at the amount of time (~6 months) and commits (~900) since the
1.7 release I am wondering whether it would not be reasonable to make also 1.8 release. Originally we wanted 1.7 to be the last 1.x feature release, however the master branch is in a good shape and no API breakage happened until now. Once we will start breaking things it will take some time (e.g. 6-9 months) until we will be able to release 2.0 and it would be a shame not to deliver the recent goodies for such a long time.

This is an incomplete list of main new features in master branch since 1.7:

I agree Martin,
but I would hope that (at least) some of the major bugs reported for
1.7/1.7.1 will be solved before a new release.
The risk is to provide new features, but loosing stability for the ones
users are used to.

A nice low-level solution would be to introduce a new class to
qgis_core library that would take care of fastcgi functionality (e.g.
QgsFastCgiServer) and an abstract interface for web-based services
(e.g. QgsFastCgiService) for communication between the fastcgi server
and the concrete service. One or more services could be registered to
the fastcgi server and it would redirect the request to the services.
Our WMS server would be therefore become a service running on top of
QgsFastCgiServer, the mapserver executable would just create fastcgi
server instance, add WMS service and start the server.

With QgsFastCgiServer developers could implement basically any
functionality they want. A simple WPS service could be built on top of
the processing framework. Or a service that first does some
processing, then renders the map and returns it (this would be the
MapScript equivalent, right?)

To use python we would need python wrapper of the server and service
classes, something that could be done very easily.

The WMS service could be probably made extensible, too, but the number
of possible use cases would be probably smaller in order to stay
compatible with WMS standard.

Hi all.
More minor issues:
- if I edit label properties with the button (close to rotate label), 
the label disappears
- the random colour ramps are generally ugly, and often colours are repeated
- a button "Randomize" is missin for random colour ramps (currently one 
has to change the number of classes to have a new ramp)
- in the editing widgets, the slider does not work
- the measure area tool seems to be wrong when started with the 
ellipsoid off (measures are doubled); switching ellipsoid on and off 
again brings back the good value.
If I get confirmations of the above I'll open tickets (but will not mind 
if someone else will do it sooner).
Thanks.

That would ne a very interesting architecture Martin.
Each Service would manage its on requirements, for example its own internal
bindings to Python or whatever.
I'm not sure about the "fastgi nature" of the services. The server has a an
fcgi interface, ok, but the services should be indipendent from this
specific interface. The Server could be deployed in a different fashion, but
the services should ignore this.

Forget my request. I went ahead with a native SQLite query (after including
the sqlite3 header) here is what I used to get to the data,

	sqlite3 *db;
	int rc = sqlite3_open( spliteDBName.toStdString().c_str(), &db);
	if( rc ){
		txtStream<< "Can't open database: \n"<< sqlite3_errmsg(db) <<endl;
		sqlite3_close(db);
		return;
	}


	strQry = "select i, sum(v) as sumi, count(i) as counti from tbltps group by
i;";
	rc = sqlite3_exec(db, strQry.toUtf8().constData(),NULL , NULL, &zErrMsg);
        if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){
		txtStream<< "\tSQL error: "<<strQry.toStdString()<< zErrMsg<<endl;
		sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);
		return;
	}
 
and one can use other functions such as 

	// SQLite get table  statement
	rc = sqlite3_get_table( db, strQry.toUtf8().constData(), &results, &rows,
&columns, &errMsg );

Thank you again for your help,

Hi all

I'm also in favor of a 1.8 release. I've been asked several times by users 
when the new features will be available in a release.

Before seems a bit short-termed. Don't know if this is possible?

Do you think that the globe plugin is stable enought to be distributed

Hi!
I'd vote for a "1.8 release meeting" at the hackfest - clean out the
most annoying bugs and release a Z?rich Release shortly after the
Hackfest ;)

For what it's worth, I'd also appreciate a 1.8 release, with the expression
based labeling (https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/51) included : )

Hi all.
I just noticed that the centroid, as calculated by fTools, is not in the

Any explanation?

Hi Paolo

I believe that there will be more buttons (or widgets) coming later,
so I am in favor of keeping the button where it is - although it may
seem to be a bit lonely right now :-)

Moving it to the main toolbar may confuse the users since the context
of the button(s) would not be clear.

IIRC, the centroid as returned by fTools is based on the GEOS centroid
calculation, whose documentation states:
Based on the usual algorithm for calculating the centroid as a
weighted sum of the centroids of a decomposition of the area into
(possibly overlapping) triangles. The algorithm has been extended to
handle holes and multi-polygons. See
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/algorithms-faq/ for further details
of the basic approach.

Not sure how the centroid fill centroid is calculated, but obviously
not the same?

OK, agreed, thanks.
BTW: the tolltip solution for indicating the path of each layer in the

Sure, it does not have to be bound specifically to FastCGI so that in
future other gateway interfaces could be used.

Hi all

A strong +1 for 1.8 from me, as it would make things much easier for the folks who let develop features but couldn't wait for qgis v.2.
Depending on the infrastructre (the number of users and their projects and even the special plugins they have) it may take some extra months for an upgrade after the API break until an "internal" release. Using new  (paid :-) features and also an as short as possible time between the last 1.x and 2.0 would be great.

I imagine a plugin system, similar to Qgis Desktop, where every service is
discovered/registered if available in certain library paths.

For the Python side I see two features that could be supplied:

 - Provide a qgispython to the services that require it to run python
scripting. We can reuse a code very similar (the same?) as in Qgis Desktop
 - Design a Python interface to "control" the Server. This would permit to
write Python frontends to the server, and incorporate Qgis Server inside
Python server projects

I am not sure if such implicit (automatic) registration would be good.
Imagine that you have several web services. You would like to run a
public WMS server and also another bunch of services for a limited
group of users. Having all the services available in both instances
would not be very good - e.g. with a WMS server you may automatically
provide WPS server.

As noted in an earlier mail this is mostly just a matter of providing
wrappers for the server/service interfaces.

Where it is depends on the desktop environment - for you probably in the File
menu.

Hi Giovanni,

I uploaded the fixed valuetool (version 0.3.3) to the 'old' repository
after Gary gave me the right permissions.
I can see it there in the web interface:
http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/python_plugins/list?page=10

maybe Gary has an idea why it does not show up in the xml-feed anymore?

It is also uploaded to the new plugin repo:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/32/
and
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/version/40/

So while it is not fixed in the feed, you can maybe just download the
zip's and unzip them in the plugins dir?
I can also 'remove' the original Valuetool, and upload the 0.3.3 version
again from within my own login, but am afraid to mess up the plugin repo
administration logic...
Let me know if you prefer this instead of just downloading the zips...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Looking at similar architectures, Geoserver seems to work this way, leaving
to a security/configuration layer to enable and control the availability of
the extensions.
Anyway, we can avoid an automatic discovering, and control their exposure
through a configuration system (eg a simple configurations file).

Hi Jurgen,

it misses under "file" in Ubuntu 11.10, but it was available under
11.04. Not sure about 1.7.1 under 11.10, I can't test now.

GeoServer will provide WMS, WCS and WFS automatically for the data.
That could also QGIS server do by default. But with the gateway
interface QGIS could provide some custom services, maybe working
properly only with some specific data.

Services", "Databases" for filtering the top-level branches? In "Web services" 
there could be WMS, WFS and WPS only, the same with Databases.

It also means that every provider should be always assigned to one of the 
categories.

I have also the "table manager" plugin installed that shows as orphan,
maybe it is related?

Hi all.
In very recent QGIS (compiled yesterday) when adding an image to a print

Anyone confirms?

Hi Alexander,

good catch I think :-)

Either Fidel or Rodrigo (in bcc), can you please remove the &-sign from
the contributor string at http://pyqgis.org/admin/contributed/?page=9
Apparently the script which generates the xml-feed does not escape that
for &amp; and qgis is chocking on that?

Or Gary can try to escape the &-signs?

Regards,

Hi Richard,

can you please check that the same problem does not exists in the new
repository ?

I'm pretty sure that it should be fine with entities, but just in case.

Thanks.

Hi all

It would be great to have a mapscript equivalent for QGIS server, so the 
possibility to modify the request before it arrives at QgsWMSServer class.

What would be the benefit of the gateway interface class compared to other 
services using FastCGI? E.g. if one want to build a WFS/WPS service with QGIS, 
the obvious solution would be to create qgis_wps_serv.fcgi or similar. Is it 
the idea to have shared service functionality on service level which is 
specific to QGIS services?

Regards,
Marco

I think that the main benefit would be having a single interface to manage,
both on the side of fcgi configurations (eg Apache) and global, server,
configurations.
I imagine that one could expose some services depending on the overall
configuration, or per user, or per domain, etc.
Geoserver let services share functionalities, being "beans" managed by the
server context available to any service. Anyway this could be a future
feature (I suppose it would take not a small time to be designed and
implemented), but having a single gateway opens to this possibility too.

I really think we should decide a way to deal with buggy plugins. I 
think fixing most of small issues is a trivial task, but if we cannot do 
it, we should add a <deprecated> tag.

I think we need at least one reliable sample server, and should check 
the bahaviour in case of a proxy.

Thanks.

Hello,

Following on this recent annoucement, the necessary OrfeoToolbox 
binaries to run the modules in Qgis are available in the OSGeo4W 
distribution.

It is now straightforward to get the OrfeoToolbox up and running in Qgis 
on Windows machines.
Installation instructions [1] have been updated to reflect this.

Thanks to the OSGeo4W team to make this possible !

Best regards,
Julien

Actually I was thinking about that, too :-)
The providers already report whether they are for a database, web
service or filesystem.

Ok, that leads probably back to the discussion wether to use apache config & 
fcgi settings & an existing service proxy (SecureOWS & co.) vs. have a QGIS 
module for user configuration and management.

With QGIS, a service can use any function in core/analysis library. 
Additionally, Python webservices might directly use qgis bindings and python 
plugin functionality by importing the relevant classes (correct me if I'm 
wrong).
Is there a use-case where it is necessary to manage the functionality by a 
central server instance?

The centroid fill uses the same formula. The differences are:
1. centroid fill calculates the centroid for each polygon of
multipolygon separately
2. centroid fill takes into account the polygons clipped to area
visible for rendering
3. centroid fill does not consider holes.

The behavior of 1,2 is forced by the way how symbology works. The item
3 can be handled.

Yes, realized,and quite reasonable.

Also reasonable. At full zoom however the two should converge, right?
It seems to me that they do not.

This does not seem too bad.
Thanks for the explanation.

I don't know what exactly the python bindings could add to the Qgis
Mapserver. I feel that we can already build a python server app using the
already available Qgis bindings...
Well, things can be done in several (infinte?) different ways. Anyone can
build its own service and deploy it, even using the Python Qgis bindings,
avoiding the fcgi interface. I was thinking to a single gateway for the
following reasons (which probably are strictly subjective):

 - avoid forcing the use of Python to deploy the services, and let
users/developers use a common fcgi interface.
As it is for Mapserver: you can use mapscripting, but you can call MS
directly even for vendor specific requests (e.g. html templates). MS
incorporates everything in a monolythic server, making it difficult to
develop and deploy third-party features.

 - have a single "register", as it is in Geoserver. With Geoserver every
extension registers itself, and expose functionalities and the kind of
requests (key/value pairs) it can manage.

Anyway, the hypothesis 0 is to let eveyone build its own fcgi server, or
python gateway ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Map vs. Line line labelling orientation
Message-ID: <20111022152522.GA8741@gnash>

I'm trying to understand the intended behaviour of
the "Map" vs. "Line" orientation for line labelling.

Is there any at all ?

So far the only differences I see seem to be bugs in handling
of one or another. In particular at time of writing (a2a6e786)
the behaviour of "Above line" and "Below line" change if "Map"
or "Line" are selected, but the behavior for "Map" seems to
make no sense.

I'm not sure I should file a bug because I fail to understand
the intended semantic.

Sandro,

the intended semantics is as follows:
- with the "map" orientation the "above line" and others should work
as one would expect: the label should appear above the line
- using "line" orientation the "above line" actually means "on the
left side of the line" - so that in case of left-to-right line there
is no difference to "map" orientation, in case of right-to-left line
the meaning of above/below is reversed to "map" orientation.

Does that make sense to you?

What would you expect when the line is a vertical line ?

The "line" orientation makes sense to me.
The "map" orientation seems insufficiently defined.

I would expect that with "above line" placement a line going up gets
the label on the left side. Contrary, a line going down should have
the label on the right side.

Wouldn't this be against the concept of being line-orientation-agnostic ?

Well, yes it would be. Anyway since this is an undefined situation it
is upon us to define it as we feel it makes sense. I have no strong
opinion about how that should work - earlier I have only described my
expectation.

It makes sense to me to decide on placement to be dependent
on line orientation or not. Usually you don't care about line
orientation. In that case it'd be unexpected for you to see
labels being left or right or above or below depending on that.

Since such difference would only be visible for the "above" and
"below" a first step could be hiding the choice completely unless
one of those two behaviors is selected.

Additionally, the choice could be reworded to be something like
a "line orientation dependent position" checkbox.

What do you think ?

Hello Agus,

the machine is likely running out of memory. The DEM is probably too
large. So you could try cropping down the DEM, use a machine with more
memory or use the built-in shaded relief tool which is more memory
efficient.

Hope this helps,

Andreas

Giovanni,

the NULL value is a special one - in your example above you are
actually searching for string 'NULL'. The correct expression would be:
myfield IS NULL

btw. In current development version (i.e. post 1.7) there is improved
support for NULL values and generally three-value logic
(true/false/unknown) as used in SQL. So some expressions that involve
null values may give different outcomes.

Hi,

Using the postgis driver,

work only on shemes where there is almost a table with geometry :)

Infact I create a scema with only one table and this single table has no 
geometry.

This schema and the table is not lists when try to connect to the DB.

I guess this is a bug

but I don't know if this is a problem for my qgis:

someone can confirm it ?

I can't find b34f924 in my git clone, is this 
the windows-only modification version ?

With 59be561 (on Ubuntu 10.04) it works fine.
Single table with single geometry field and no records in a schema.
Shown checking the "Also list tables with no geometry" and
hidden when unchecking it.

are you sure it is not a permission problem? There are permissions
schema usage and on table, views, and more. If you don't have the
permissions, it won't be listed.

Hi,

I check my grant, its all ok.

Also I update to the 1a1f5eb.

But again I cannot see it.

More explain:

I can see all the tables without geometries.

This is my use-case:

I create a new schema
after this I create a single unique tables in this newly created schema.
This newly created table is without any geometry field.

After this I insert some records n this table.

After this,
I try to inquity the db using the
qgis postgis driver.
setting:

uncheck "only look in the geometry_columns"
uncheck "only look in public schema"
check "also list tables without geometries"
check "use estimated table metadata"

when I try to connect qgis list me another schema thata has many tables 
with geometries and tables without geometries.

But this new created schema with the only one table is not listed.

However I see there more problem because
I notice that never the public schema was showed (it has no geoemtries 
table in my db)

I notice also there is two checkbox named "also list tables with no 
geometry".
One is in the "create new postgis connection" windows and the other is 
in the "add postgis table".

Checking the checkbox in the "create new postgis.." do nothing.
Instead if I check the version in the "add postgis table" will do appear 
the public schema.

Seem the checkbox "also no geometry tables" in the "create new 
postgis..." windows do absolutely nothing.

However my newly create schema with only one table without geometry 
never appair :)

I have found why my schema don't appear.

It was the
"Only look in the 'public' schema".
Unchecking it was appeared.

I was beat before because,
when check the
"Only look in the public schema"
was reported me not only the tables in the public but also all the 
tables (with geometry) in other schemas .
Now I guess this was reported because listed in the geometry_columns view.

Andrea.

At the moment the  Google Layers plugin handles zooming better than Open
Layers for satellite images. I prefer Goggle Layers. If at some point Open
Layers would allow unlimited zooming in then I would not mind dropping the
Google Layers plugin.

The OpenLayer plugin won't support unlimited zooming, as long as the Google 
TOS don't allow changing a tile image. Do the new TOS allow that?

Hi Giovanni and all

True, prompt seems to be a better default. It is changed now in master 
fecb0de028a83bcd6768cbb5663f2439bd2f920f

I'm also doing a backport to 1.7.1 if there are no urgent objections.

Message-ID: <CAKWoFMJrzURTv9uv_6RzXEDEE1JKsCC6b7cHi+JmxeEViZ6k9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Giovanni Manghi run to a problem with NULL values in a shapefiles
(earlier post). I tested it but couldn't reproduce the error in 1.7.1.
But I found out some other issues with NULL handling in shapefiles.

Shapefiles don't support null values at least not in ESRI-world.
Though OGR should support reading and writing null values with
shapefiles. Don't know how but it should.
When I opened a shapefile created by arcgis geoprosessor, qgis somehow
shows all the 0 and '' values as a NULL values. I'm now able to search
a field with IS NULL syntax and qgis returns what is expected. I'm
also able to modify the table and change some values to real zeros.
Now a search finds only 0 values when searched [field] = 0. But when I
save this layer with Save as... to a new shapefile all the NULL values
in numeric fields are converted to 0 and in text field to ''. In the
attribute table '' values in text fields still shows as NULL but when
I try to search only [field] = '' works. All zeros in numeric fields
shows as 0 and not NULL.

Is there some logic or is this a bug to report?

Thanks

Hello Giovanni,

I'm also a bit confused.
I tested your problem but couldn't reproduce that at least with 1.7.1.

But what I found out is that there is some weirdness in handling NULL
values in shapefiles in QGIS and OGR.
I send other post to the list concerning that.

Sometime within the next 12 hours I will be moving pyqgis.org to a new server. Along with this, the contributed repo that is used in the Python Plugin installer will move as well. 

The impacts should be minimal, *unless* you upload a plugin midway through the transition (before DNS has fully propagated). Fetching of the list of plugins within QGIS will not be impacted.

If you plan to upload a plugin today, you may want to wait or use the temporary URL of the new server:
http://new.pyqgis.org.

My understanding is that NULL values in dBase files (accompanying
shapefiles) is a sort of extension of original file format and not all
software support it.

Such inconsistent behavior is worth a bug report, do not forget to
attach a test shapefile.

Martin I just found that you proposed a patch to allow speed up vector
rendering

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3200

maybe this can be tested again and added in time for 1.8?

Depends when the release should be.
Large modifications of the central core classes shouldn't be merged in short 
before a release. Better is to consider it short after a release.

Ok, everything that speed up the rendering of (big) vectors is highly

Giovanni,
porting and testing the patch would need quite a lot of time.
Definitely not something that could be released soon.

 i would also wait until after release of 1.8. It is probably too 
 dangerous before (without knowing it exactly).

Martin,

I've tried the following code:

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer('dbname="/data/gis/test.sqlite" table="mytable"',
'mytable', 'spatialite') 

but it doesn't work: vlayer.isValid() returns False ...

Peraphs this is because i'm still on QGIS 1.7 ???

Is there a way to import non spatial table in qgis 1.7 ?

I found it only works if the database is "spatialite enabled". In this case,
the script works for all tables non-spatial and spatial) in the database. 
For a simple SQLite base, the script doesn't work

 Hi Nathan and others,

 Thanks for developing the expression based labeling. Wow - it really 
 looks great.

 I have two questions and a remark:

 Question 1: the output preview of the label does not seem to work when 
 I use a field - is there something I need to do to enable it? I would 
 expect it to pull in the first record or some random record to retrieve 
 values?

 Question 2: how does it handle empty fields (null values)? would string 
 concatenation still work or do we need to coalesce() like in PostreSQL?

 Remark:
 wouldn't it be cleverer to use your great new query builder and 
 introduce the concept of a "virtual column" in the data provider? This 
 way we could use your query builder for labeling, for tooltips, for read 
 only display in tables and forms and in the identify tool. Potentially 
 in the future in other scenarios as well? The query builder would then 
 extend the data provider and introduce a new virtual column which could 
 then be treated like all other columns, but read only.

 Thanks a lot for your cool work and feature enhancement towards 
 labeling!

 Andreas

Thanks Andreas. Glad you like it.

>> Question 1: the output preview of the label does not seem to work when I
use a field - is there something I need to >>do to enable it? I would expect

Ah yes there seems to be a bug with grabbing the first record with some data
sources.  I get the top feature using layer.featureAt(0) but for some reason
not all providers return a record at this index.  Writing a patch now.

>>Question 2: how does it handle empty fields (null values)? would string

Yeah null values when used with || are just converted to empty strings.

>> Remark:

That would be a cool idea and something I have thought about, just don't
have the skills or time at present.  I plan to redo the field calculator to
use my new expression builder widget at some stage so we can look at the
virtual column thing then.

 My data source is Postgis in this case.

 well this was more a general question to all of the developers - not 
 that I ask that from you personally.

 Thanks again - it is really cool!

That is because not all data providers use ids in interval [0,N-1].
For example, postgres provider uses the column with primary key as ID
- so the values may be arbitrary. It is better to do a select()
followed by just one nextFeature().

Subject: [Qgis-developer] API proposal: fetching of features
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFe0qOt_+ES75tF7yz7c1KABDNSjGoc17_w8NEbiO95jUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs

I believe that a good API for iteration over features of vector layers
is quite crucial for a GIS because it is being used very heavily in
application code and plguins. Recently after reading an article [1]
and looking at the hints for designing qt-style api [2] I have
realized that the select() method (that tells what should be fetched)
is quite ugly. How intuitive is the code for some common scenarios?
Not much :-)
1. fetch everything from a given extent
  layer->select( pendingAllAttributesList(), extent, true );
2. fetch geometries
  layer->select( QgsAttributeList(), extent, true );
3. fetch features that really intersect the given extent (e.g. for
identification)
  layer->select( pendingAllAttributesList(), extent, true, true );

The problems:
- boolean parameter trap - a user may pass two boolean values, but it
is unclear what is their purpose
- fetching all attributes is very common, however it needs a bit weird
call to fetch the list of all indexes
- adding further options to the select may result in too many parameters

How to address the problems:
- use flags instead of booleans: e.g. "FetchGeometry | UseIntesect"
flags makes more sense than "true, true"
- use a temporary object for fetching data that has sensible defaults
(fetch all features=yes, fetch all attributes=yes, fetch
geometries=yes, use intersect=no) and that can be extended later
1. fetch everything from a given extent
  layer->select( QgsFeatureRequest( extent ) );
2. fetch geometries
  QgsFeatureRequest request( extent );
  request.setAttributesToFetch( QgsAttributeList() );
  layer->select( request );
3. fetch features that really intersect the given extent
  QgsFeatureRequest request( extent );
  request.setUseIntersect( true ); -- or -- request.setFlags( UseIntersect );
  layer->select( request );

It seems that in near future we could add few more useful options for
fetching features - adding them as further parameters in select()
sounds like a bad idea:
- filter based on an expression:
  QgsFeatureRequest request;
  request.setExpression( "type = 5 and $area > 100" );
  layer->select( request );
- fetch just some features:
  QgsFeatureRequest request;
  request.setLimit( 10 );
  layer->select( request );

Maybe featureAtId() call also should be integrated into this API:
  layer->select( QgsFeatureRequest( featureId ) );
  // + one call to nextFeature

This should ideally be combined with the feature iterators I have
introduced in the threading branch - that is use a getFeatures()
method instead of select() and use an iterator object for
reading/iterating over the features (the iterator has some advantages
and it is necessary in scenarios with multiple threads to provide
locking):
  QgsFeatureRequest request;
  // modify request if it should be more specific
  QgsFeatureIterator fi = layer->getFeatures( request );
  while ( fi.nextFeature( feat ) )
  { do something }

What do you think? I would like to gather your opinions - is it
good/bad/complex/inefficient/nonintuitive/verbose/...?
This is a piece of API that is used very heavily, so we should polish
it as much as possible. Of course the proposal is directed towards
QGIS 2.0. While trying to port the QgsFeatureIterator changes from
threading branch to the current master branch I thought it will be
better to do these changes at the same time.

Regards
Martin

Ok pull request sent with a patch for the missing preview output and to
enable multiline labels by default.  Enabled multiline by default because
users seem to struggle to get multiline working unless that feature is told
to them.

The question is whether it ever makes sense to disable multiline
labels. Therefore for the simplicity of the GUI I would suggest to
remove the option completely and always keep it on... unless there is
a case when multiline labels should be explicitly disabled?

I agree. I can't really think of a use case where you wouldn't need it on
always.  Looking at the code it seems that adding the direction symbol to
the label doesn't work with multiline labels.

Maybe just enable it by default for now, fix the direction symbol stuff,
remove it....wait for someone to bring it up as a issue.

+1, .select() and derivates are, maybe, the most important function and
it's crucial that they must be optimized.
Using them in python is really slow on large datasets.

I would like to have this simple (and optimized) function:

    layer.selectOIDS ( extent ) -> returns an array of OIDS (integer),
fetching only one field

and then I use:

    layer.fetchAttributesByOID ( OID ) -> returns an array of attributes

 the direction symbol is important for us. We use it to label the 
 direction of waste-water pipes. We use them only in single-line labels 
 though.

 I also can't think of cases where multiline labels need be set to off, 
 other than potential issues in the code?

 sounds good.

How is it with curved line labels, do they work with multiline?

Btw I noticed that the 'engine settings' button is always greyed out
for me recently.

Message-ID: <CADs9uc_SHTcqE2Uo6KS-1BgAQiP5aqkS=ugEPtsELeKm6pipnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What needs to be installed to make eVis plugin works with spatialite
db in Mac OS X?

The author mentioned about Qt library.

"... Qt's library so you don't have to have spatialite."

http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/Qgis-and-sqlite-td4521419.html

eVis is now default plugin in QGIS 1.7.x and QGIS 1.8.0.

I got this error using spatialite db.

##########
New Database connection requested...
Connection to [./Volumes/MAC_OS_1068/Work/work_d1/Work_11/SImon_GPS_Photos/GPS_Photo.db]
failed: Driver not loaded Driver not loaded

##########

Is eVis plugin sqlite/spatialite working in Linux?

Any experience how to hack this to read my db?

Thanks.

Would it make sense to abstract provider-specific IDs so that the
[0, N-1] range holds for everyone ?

Even then, it would still be necessary to do select() followed by 
nextFeature() as Martin recommended. Because there are some providers 
without ramdom feature access (only sequential iteration through the 
features). Examples are 'delimited text' or 'gpx'.

Marco

Good thinking Martin,

QgsFeatureRequest request;
request.setExpression( "type = 5 and $area > 100" );
request.setLimit(10)
layer->select( request );

I really like this API style.  We can add methods to QgsFeatureRequest for
better access without busting the select API, which is good imo.

Could even have the setMethods return the QgsFeatureRequest instance so you
could do.

QgsFeatureRequest request;
request.setExpression( "type = 5 and $area > 100"
).setLimit(10).setAttributes( {some list} );
layer->select( request );

A big +1 from me

+1 for use flags. This is much readable than current "true, true".
Also other proposed changes are reasonable for me.

I'll add it to my list of Qt extras to bundle in the app.  Since it's a requirement, I'll try to get an update out this weekend.

You could install it yourself, but it's tricky - you don't want to install Qt and copy qsqlite into Qgis, it'll still reference the now-installed Qt and cause Qgis to crash because of multiple loaded Qt's.  Pacifist would allow you to extract qsqlite without installing all of Qt.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] RE: integrate GRASS graph modeler into QGIS?
Message-ID: <921A2E3205638149B5C0299EBD03033CF07BC660BB@mx7serv>

Hi

I have built image processing chains with GRASS GIS modelbuilder that performs some advanced image processing based on some user defined input variables.
Now I want to make these models available to my GIS users in Quantum GIS, so that they can input the variables and execute the models from QGIS, without opening GRASS GIS.

How can this be handled? Any suggestions/directions would be welcome.

Best regards,
Rasmus

I guess the best choice would be to join the effort to port GRASS into
the processing framework and to build the modeller for the same
framework.

This list is the right place to start tale contact with the people
involved/interested :)

This is actually done within attribute table - we store feature IDs
for the range [0,N-1] so that we can later access the feature data by
row number. But that comes at an additional price: the layer has to be
scanned first in order to obtain the mapping and it has to be updated
whenever some changes to the layer are done.

What would be the requirements of such provider-specific IDs? What to
do when a feature is deleted? If we recreate the mapping, some IDs
stored by users would change, leading to problems if the user stores
them as references to features. If we keep the original mapping, then
it may contain holes and therefore the convenient [0, N-1] range would
not be valid.

What happens if you delete a feature from a shapefile ?

Apparently OGR only marks the feature as deleted in DBF, other IDs are
not changed.

Note that one advantage of delegating to providers setting up a mapping
is we could finally drop the requirement of an integer identifier in
postgresql. There are real-world cases in which primary key is a text
identifier.

Ok now I got where you were heading. Yes, a mechanism for mapping
non-int primary keys (or even multiple column primary keys) to int IDs
would be nice - but that does not mean that [0,N-1] range has to be
enforced.

Hi William,

Thanks for replying.

I just wait for your Qt Extra that includes QSQLITE driver. I don't to
break my spatialite in QGIS.

Looking forward your new package.

Thanks.

Would it be an OK solution to add the > to the last line and the < to the
first line.

eg

Line 1
Line 2 >

or

< Line 1
Line 2

At the moment this is the only thing really stopping us from removing the
multiline option and just letting the code handle multilines as the default
action.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] "forward transform of..." error
Message-ID: <1319890564.2572.14.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

seems to me that in qgis-master (and also in 1.7.1 I think) there is a
regression/bug that leads to have this error to pop up very easily 


forward transform of
(-2202.92, 369.213)
failed with error: latitude or longitude exceeded limits


try for example open a new project in WGS84 (no OTFR) and add a raster
in a projected CRS.

The error pop ups when the mouse passes over the canvas, so it is
useless to click "ok" as it continue to pop-up, unless dragging it out
of the canvas, then enter the project properties and set the project CRS
as the layer CRS or by enabling OTFR?

Is anyone else seeing it? I can replicate on both Linux and Windows.


cheers

Yes Giovanni,
I've just seen it this morning :)

It is QgsCoordinateTransform's fault, I suppose...

QGIS (Mac) 1.7.1-2 is available, with qsqlite plugin.  Let me know if it works or not, and I'll patch the source if OK.

Hello William,

Just wondering if you have tried compiling QGIS lately with any issues as
mine,

Or perhaps is it better if I try and compile via xtools?

thanks

I haven't looked at QGIS dev source lately, sorry.  If you mean Xcode, the Xcode project file is no longer valid, it's all compiled with cmake now (a lot easier to maintain).

Hi William,

Thanks.

Yes, It is working. I am able to open spatialite database file with db
extension (e.g. mydata.db).

Probably when you patch it, you could include that:

1. eVis can open sqlite extension (e.g. mydata.sqlite) as well and
2. path, it seems that it can remember the path the database it opens
when you try to open the database again.

BTW, it seems QSQLITE is already in Ubuntu port already.

eVis users, any comments how we can improve eVis in QGIS?

Thanks.

Noli

Hi Nathan,

This would be ok for me. In reality, we are using this direction symbol
only with single lines anyway - and what you suggest sounds also good
for multiline labels.

Thanks again,
Andreas

Hi all.
The upgrade of Rectangles oval digitizing and Apptest2 fails, probably for the usual
problems in packaging.
I'm very much looking forward to generalize the autopackaging scripts some of us are
already using.
All the best.

Hi all.
According to http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4365 :

Nathan's new expression builder (developed for expression-based labeling) should be
integrated into field calculator dialog - that widget automatically shows all
existing functions.

I cannot find it - am I missing something?
All the best.

I put together a short vid clip to try and illustrate a possible? gui
enhancement to editing attribute values while selecting features from the
canvas with editing of that same feature active.

If it was a conflict or not possible this way, then perhaps,

double clicking a particular value could open an edit window for that same
specific value and active for editing, without having to scroll.

If not I'll just keep clicking away.

Thank you.

Indeed.  It's on my TODO list.  I would like to get a rock solid version in
one place (labeling) first before I start rolling it out all over the app.
 There is a few bugs that I found after the merge that are in a pending
pull request.  I'll get Martin to merge them during the week if he has some
free time.

I have also made a few tweaks to the UI so I'll put them in the pull
request to.

To: OSGeo NZ/AU <aust-nz@lists.osgeo.org>

Jody Garnett and I have been chatting on IRC about my recent developments
in QGIS with regards to the new expression builder [1], with this
we decided to have a QGIS vs uDig face off.  Jody is planning on building a
new expression builder for uDig, using some different ideas to me, so we
thought in order to help both programs advance we would have a little
friendly comp.  The hope is that these friendly competitions will help us
(and anyone else) create the best user experience we can by sharing ideas
and pushing each project to do better.

Round one will be held in Brisbane on the 11th at the Edge.

OK.  If there are no objections from anyone else I'll go ahead and
implement it this way.  My HDD with my dev environment died last night so I
have had to migrate to a new HDD and new install of Mint.  Will take me a
few days to get back into everything as I have an exam tomorrow.  Once that

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible GUI Enhancement for canvas Selection
	Editing

 Hi Mars,

 In the QGIS settings, in the "Map Tools" tab there is a checkbox called 
 "Open feature form, if a single feature is identified". If you enable 
 this checkbox, the attribute editing form will appear immediately. It is 
 often also useful to combine this with "Top down, stop at first" setting 
 for the behavior of the "Identify" tool.

 The reason why there is a tree and a form is, that in cases of multiple 
 hits (multiple features within the tolerance, drill down option) you 
 will get the tree (read only). From there you can open the form with a 
 right-klick.

 Maybe there is room for improvements here, if you have concrete 
 suggestions.

I noticed that entering Return does not break the labels, e.g.

results in a single line, with small bells instead of the line breaks.
Any explanation? Anyone confirms?

Paolo,

Did you make sure you you had multiline labels ticked in the advanced tab
of the label options.  If you grab the latest build it should be enabled by
default now as per the pull request of mine Martin just merged.

Yes, but if after cancelling you select an existing colour ramp before
clicking on "new color ramp" again, it works.

I think the bug is actually that when you cancel "new colour ramp" stays
selected.  
What should happen when you cancel is that the previously selected
colour ramp should be selected.

Ah Okay, Thank You!

The  >> *Top down, Stop at First* << works well.  I completely missed or
forgot about the multi-selection box and had it set on >> *Top Down* <<

Yah this pretty much works as I would like.

The only nit-picky thing I could see is to allow the >>* Edit Form* << to
be more condensed.
Perhaps smaller font size, and/or, less space between attributes if
possible?
Just to allow more Attributes to be seen within the form without the need
to scroll.

Top down, Stop at First is the trick though!

Thank You!
