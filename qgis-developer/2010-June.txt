Hi,

I notice GoogleLayers returns an image resembling a square, which
doesn't fill the extents of the display. Is it possible for the plugin
to fetch an image matching the bounding box of the display? I also
notice satellite images are fetched as PNG. I thought JPEG was more
appropriate for this type of imagery.

Regards,

Craig

No, limit of Google static API is 640x640 pixels.  This is the best we can get from here. Only one possibility is to 
create image from series of tiles, but I am not sure if  such dirty bypassing of Google limit is good idea. Remember, 
they can change rules to stop us and we can delete whole plugin.

Yes, it can be JPEG, I have this in my todo.

+1, as it's quite mature (and doesn't affect any other parts of qgis anyway).

However all its classes must be renamed from "Dialog" "OptionsTable" etc to 
something more unique (eg. GdalToolsOptionsTable) before including it to the 
main translation system. Translators need a possibility to deterimne the 
origin/context of each string.

Giuseppe, please take a look at contexts in the main qgis_xx_XX.ts files in 
the linguist and think out any sensible prefix. I think PluginName is ok for 
plugins (QgsPluginName seems superfluous). We will need to start putting the 
existing mess in order - the present situation where there are 244 various 
strings in one "Dialog" context (and this number is growing) is going 
unacceptable :)

Did I miss mails over on qgis-psc?  AFAICS only Otto voted.  But he also
mentioned a mail from you, that I didn't see, but it didn't make it to the

The categorized renderer is intended to be a renderer for discrete
values - categories - where the values do not refer to quantities.
Categorized symbol renderer has basically the same semantics the
Unique symbol renderer from old symbology. I'm not an experienced
cartographer and I've started to use the 'Categorized' name, because
I've found it more intuitive than 'Unique symbol' renderer - but I'm
not a native speaker and I can be wrong.

However, what leads you to think that categorized renderer is set up
for continuous ranges of values? Is it the possibility to apply
graduated color ramps?

Message-ID: <AANLkTilhCCePcbf9LBTo34CjPa1LpHnZ1ccnigU2Us82@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I would like to ask if somebody is using Gnome desktop for
using/developing QGIS and plugins?
I don't want to make any KDE/Gnome flame war. My company is using KDE
desktop since Debian Etch. Now using KDE 3.5 on Lenny and it fits our
needs really well.
Currently we are making decision, what kind of desktop to use when
Debian Squeeze will come out and we are not very excited of KDE 4. I
think, Gnome will be our choice. Question is, if we are not going to
loose some quality in terms of Qt and QGIS ?

I have one example: I was trying to create some UI dialog in Qt
Creator in Gnome and I had strong feeling, that the widget look was
still really different than in KDE (also in preview). So, how can I be
sure, that UI  dialog will be OK in KDE or in windows. Also QGIS
widgets and look and feel is quite different, so I can not make any
serious tests.


What is Your point of view ?

Thanks
Ivan

Now that you've explained it, I see your logic, though I still think
that it is perhaps not intuitive. While the categorised renderer
expects categorised data, it does not categorise the data itself, and
I think this is where the confusion lies for me. You are naming the
renderers based on the expected input data, and I am expecting the
renderers to be named based on what they do (which might not be the
best way to think!). I have just had a look at what some other
proprietary GIS do, and in fact what you have is probably closer to
what they have, so I may be wrong. However, to clear things up, it
might be nice to label the renders as 'Discrete data renderer' and
'Continuous data renderer'...?

Yes, probably...

Message-ID: <4C0746CC.9070008@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Thanks to Christopher Gabriel, I have set up an unofficial Debian repo:

deb http://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/debian/ unstable/
deb-src http://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/debian/ unstable/

Currently it contains:

- qgis from trunk: amd64 for unstable and i386 for testing (it needs sip4 packages
from unstable though)
- pyspatialite (both amd64 and i386) for unstable (it should work for testing too),
to help Debian users testing our SpatiaLite manager (BTW, feedback and help welcome!).

There are also the src, for easy packaging in other architectures.
I'll keep them up to date irregularly, most probably at least once a week.
Thanks a lot to Jurgen Fisher for keeping the Debian packaging tidy and functional,
and Francesco Lovergine for his work od Debian-GIS.
All the best.

I develop QGIS plugins on Ubuntu using Gnome and occasionally test them
on windows xp. I haven't noticed any real difference besides the color
scheme and shape of the outside of dialogs.

Qt is Qt, building the dialogs in Gnome or KDE isn't going to change the
fact that it's Qt, just stick with defaults and autosizing and stay away
from very custom nit picky placement of things.

It's good practice to leave all the sorting of widgets to layouts and
spacers anyways.

FYI, you could always log out and log into KDE to check the look, or
pull up a windows virtual machine to verify things are ok. While I use
gnome most of the time several of my machines are capable of switching
to XFCE and KDE whenever I feel like it, just takes a little more hard
drive space (as long as you continue to run gdm, if you switch to kdm
then you get extra processes too).

Enjoy,
Alex

Thanks a lot for Your ideas. 
I do not like idea to install multiple window managers on one machine. Currently I am playing with some possibilities to 
configure Qt widgets without installing half of KDE 4. 
I have found settings which seems to fit my needs. Maybe in Ubuntu, this configuration is by default.

For others, this was done on my testing Debian Squeeze machine
1. Install 'kdebase-runtime' (it will bring lot of dependencies, maybe some can be uninstalled after)
2. Configure Clearlooks as Your theme in Gnome
3. Run 'qtconfig' and set GUI style: Desktop Settings
4. run 'kwriteconfig --file kdeglobals --group General --key widgetStyle gtk'

Hi

I use gnome with no other window manager. Qt includes code that
detects if you are using GNOME or KDE and uses the appropriate HIG
(human interface guidelines) and theme to that platform.

Even so, QGIS doesnt look completely integrated due to different icons
and widgets etc so I dont think you can ever expect it to look as
integrated as e.g. nautilus on your desktop.

Regards

Tim

Hi guys,
now GdalTools plugin v.1.2.0 is in trunk.
So, if you have to open a ticket you must use the qgis trac.

For the translators: remember that you must update the translations
on the qgis repository and not in the Faunalia one.

Cheers.

Hi qGIS dev's,

I'm a graduate student in the geography and geospatial sciences at the
University of Texas in Dallas
This summer I must complete an independent study project for a GIS workshop.
Through out the year we worked mostly with ESRI products, but since I am a
programmer in my day job, I figured it would be a great opportunity to
contribute to open source.

A few of the GSoC projects <
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2010> piqued my interest and
I was wondering if anyone knows the status of these, and if it would be
acceptable to proceed with them as project topics

==Raster reproject on the fly==
I found a few papers on fast computation methods for geodetic coordinates.
 I would need to find a variety of raster data sets with which to test the
performance and accuracy of the methods.

==Time Series Visualization==
  I had been wanting to do some work in this area, since I find it
interesting.  At my day job, we use tracking software on some of our
employees, so I have access to real-world data with which to test.

I will start by reviewing all the documentation and submit some patches per
the Welcome Pack.
But if someone can reply and just let me know if either of these seem like
valuable contributions, then I can run them by my workshop coordinator
before writing a proposal.

Thank-you for your help!

Andrew

Hi

Raster reprojection on the fly would be a fantastic and widely appreciated contribution. The only gsoc project that was accepted was Martin Dobias' performance improvement proposal so I believe there will be no issue with you taking over one of the projects.

We have discussed raster reprojection before today on IRC and I proposed to take the following approach:

- read in the window for the raster to match the current map view (which is resampled to match the display resolution and fetching only the required bands for display) using gdal (as currently implemented in QGIS) but with an additional bit to account for post reprojection rotation.
- reproject by internally using the same api calls that gdal_warp uses
- display

Obviously that doesn't exactly match you interest in implementing code for geodetic transformations but it has the advantage of abstracting / offloading most of the reprojection work to outside of QGIS and us benefiting from improvements and optimisations to gdal over time.

If you follow that logic through you could do some coding in gdal itself to improve the performance of raster reprojection should that prove to be a bottleneck.

Anyway just some thoughts - others may have different ideas on how it should be done.

Regards

Tim

Thanks, You are perfectly right. Using Clearlooks theme makes very good Gnome integration and widgets looks placed 
correctly.

I suspect most of the overhead in a software-resampler like gdalwarp stems
from the image resampling step.

So implementing resampling using the GPU (e.g. using anisotropic texture
mapping) would go a big way towards improving performance.

Coordinate remapping could be implemented by selectively subdividing a 
triangle mesh, i.e. a scheme where edges with the highest midpoint 
approximation error are adaptively subdivided. Using this scheme, exact
coordinate remapping is attained at vertices (via the u/v texture
coordinates), and linearly interpolated inside triangles. It is analogous to
the linear approximation of coordinate transforms as implemented in gdalwarp.

Using more advanced pixel shaders, one could then also use higher-order
interpolation schemes to lower the required number of support points.

bye,

I suspect this is what's already happening when opening a rotated raster,
or a raster with GCPs (see QgsRasterLayer::readFile). Such files are
wrapped in a VRT file by readFile. This leads the gdal VRT driver to
transparently apply on-the-fly reprojection. 

If I recall the VRT implementation correctly, it does already choose 
reprojection windows adaptively, and so should be usable if nearest
neighbor resampling  is used and pyramids are available.

It might be worth a shot to just extend the VRT wrapping case to
include coordinate system transforms for a quick implementation.

Hi

I guess having 'dev' in the release name is causing issues.... (see below).

it's strange... It seems that the autopackaging doesn't works well as
instead it did. I try to find the issue.

However, sorry, but it worked well before I changed the version number.
I think could be a permission issue, because I edited the package and
the script cannot replace it with the newer.

Solved... The issue is the one I described in the previous mail.

However, if I install the experimental GdalTools (v.1.2.3) and
I restart QGis as required, the plugin doesn't replace the one in trunk.

Is it the correct behaviour?
If it is, maintaining the experimental one make no sense!

Cheers

It should replace it. Otherwise there were no possibility to upgrade plugins. 

As you probably know, plugins bundled with qgis are installed in the 
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins (or similar), while plugins installed by the 
installer go to ~/.qgis/python/plugins.

Now, plugins in the home directory *always* cover the ones in /usr (even 
regardless of the version - if the instance in the home directory is older, 
qgis only displays a warning message and suggest to uninstall it).

I tried and re-tried but the GdalTools experimental (local) doesn't replace
the
GdalTools in trunk (system).

I guess that the plugin_installer works well. The issue may be in
python/utils.py in updateAvailablePlugins function:
there are no tests to check if the local plugin is newer then the system
one.

I make some changes to the file above, lines 89:98

*from:*

  for pluginpath in plugindirs:
      newplugins = findPlugins(pluginpath)
      if len(newplugins) > 0:
          if pluginpath not in sys.path:
              sys.path.append(pluginpath)
          for p in newplugins:
              if p not in plugins:
                  plugins.append(p)

*to:*
*
  plugin2path = {}
  *for pluginpath in plugindirs:
      newplugins = findPlugins(pluginpath)
      if len(newplugins) > 0:
          if pluginpath not in sys.path:
              sys.path.append(pluginpath)
          for p in newplugins:
              if p not in plugins:
                  plugins.append(p)*
                  plugin2path[p] = pluginpath
              else:
                  exec( "from %s.__init__ import version " % p )
                  newvers = version()[8:]
                  newvers = map(int, newvers.split("."))

                  oldpath = sys.path
                  sys.path.append( plugin2path[p] )
                  exec( "from %s.__init__ import version " % p )
                  oldvers = version()[8:]
                  oldvers = map(int, oldvers.split("."))
                  sys.path = oldpath

                  if newvers > oldvers:
                      plugins.append(p)
                      plugin2path[p] = pluginpath

  del plugin2path*

I wrote this code on the fly, so I'm not sure it's very good, but it seems
to
resolve this problem.

The installation works as expected: therefore I can replace the GdalTools
in trunk with the experimental one.

Uninstalling the plugin the Raster menu is removed (because QGis unload it)
but restarting QGis I can see again the Raster menu with GdalTools in trunk.

What do you think about?

Did I say I wrote it on the fly? :)
We can store into the temporary dict for each plugin the higher
version number instead of the path, it's surely better.

You're right. Martin, seems you've changed the behaviour when moving the code 
to utils.py and now the priority of plugins depends only on python paths 
order. 

Can we at least set fixed path order for 1.5?

I'd like to avoid any big changes while we're in the feature freeze, fix it as 
simply as possible and refactor it when the features are unfrozen :-) 

I don't like to introduce version comaprision at this moment, as it can bring 
more troubles than benefits. So any plugin installed in the user directory 
should cover the system one at this time.

Comparing version numbers isn't so easy, as we have no rigid rules for devs 
and you can meet even such comparision: 

"2.3-3beta7a" vs "Version 2.3.03.rc5"

:)

The method I wrote for plugin installer can cope with such cases:

/python/plugins/plugin_installer/version_compare.py

and we probably should move it to core and use when loading qgis.


> Uninstalling the plugin the Raster menu is removed (because QGis unload it)

Good point, the installer should try to load the bundled instance after 
uninstalling a plugin.

Hi all.
We have a few very old bugs. One of those:

is rather annoying; a patch is provided, why is not applied? Otherwise, would it be

Hi all.
Currently, RaterLite support is quite limited. QGIS can handle only single-raster

good if QGIS ould handle it.

Hi

Paolo this should probably wait till QGIS 1.6 / 2.0 since it looks
like substantial rejigging of the raster code would be needed to
properly support subrasters.

Hi

Well my reading through the patch comments lead me to believe it is
already applied:

"I have incorporated a variation on this patch in trunk (r...) that
also treats files without bands as invalid in the
isValidRasterFileName()." - Frank Warmerdam

Maybe it is too late to solve such things in package freeze, but could
it be at least int8 ?

Hi,

Are gdaltools' strings going to be merged into the main qgis_*.ts file 
before the release ? If yes could the already existing translations 
could be merged into their respective .ts file ?

The script scripts/update_ts_files.sh adds new strings to the ts files.  It can
also be run for individual languages, eg. scripts/updates_ts_files.sh de.

In r13669 I did a complete run.

I wasn't aware that there are translations.  Looks like they weren't commited,
but I found them in the faunalia repository.  I'm looking into it.

Message-ID: <5ae5f8587d00f0de4967b4f27b46cff3@localhost>


Hi all.
I would suggest to release 1.5 only when ready. For this I would suggest
to:
- move all non-crucial-for-release, non-fixable (in the remaining time
frame) bugs to a new tag (1.6)
- concentrate on the remaining 1.5 bugs, and release only when all are
fixed.
I think releasing with known crucial bugs will not make our (now very
large) user base happy.
Am I wrong? If there is a consensus on this, I'm ready to help checking the
list and revising ticket priorities.
All the best.

Hi Paolo

In my opinion the list with blocking bugs should be very, very small. 
Additionally we should have a latest date where we release with all present 
bugs.

Because I'm afraid that 1.5 will be delayed too much. There will always be 
bugs and sometimes bugs arise faster then they get fixed. Wouldn't it be better 
to release more frequently instead?

Regards,
Marco

If there are no objections against renaming the renderers, feel free
to rename them.

I'm not sure what to do with names of classes of the renderers in
source code, I would prefer to keep them as they are (and optionally
rename them in qgis 2.0).

Hi Paolo

I agree that the crucial bugs should be fixed before the release,
however at the same time we should have a deadline so that the release
won't be shifted indefinitely.

The list of important bugs is a must. As Marco has already noted, the
list has to be rather short (I suggest < 30 bugs) otherwise it will be
impossible to get to zero bugs. I would add that the critical bugs
must be confirmed by at least one more user and with clear
descriptions.

Umm... I'm not sure if I understand what's the problem. What else
should affect the priority of plugins? In current semantics, the
locally installed plugins in ~/.qgis are preferred to the global ones
in /usr. So what is the difference from previous implementation in
c++?

In the "Roadmap" page of Qgis Trac wiki, there's still the reference of
1.0.3 version of QGIS.
I think that this reference is useless since it's a very old version.

Seems they aren't really preffered. It works at mine, but Giuseppe always see 
the /usr ones. It's all about python paths, I'm right? I can't see any code 
preferring the ~/ ones in Qgis.

Maybe I was wrong thinking that in the previous implementation the two paths 
were distinguished.

I looked at the code and seems the /usr one should be preferred.
But installing GdalTools in  ~/.qgis, I cannot see it.

I'll try to find why it doesn't works as expected.

Cheers

Hi Borys,

QgsPythonUtilsImpl::initPython() puts

pythonPath()		[/usr/share/qgis/python]
~/.qgis/python
~/.qgis/python/plugins	
pluginsPath()		[/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins]

in front of the system's python path.  I think that's Martin meant.  imports
will prefer the user plugins.

But utils.py searches for available plugins first the system plugins and then
the user plugins, but AFAICS that shouldn't make a difference.

Exactly. Giuseppe, can you check your paths?

Exactly, it creates only a list of module names.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] extract traffic signal positions from OSM data
Message-ID: <20100607102827.34120@gmx.net>

Hi,

I noticed that on openstreetmap.org, you can see positions of traffic signals (traffic lights). When I download OSM data of the same region using Openstreetmap plugin 0.5, it seems like these points are not downloaded. From their wiki, I found that it should be a "highway" attribute, but in highway column I only saw "bus_stop" entries. 

Does anyone know how to download information on traffic lights from OSM via the existing plugin or where I should apply changes?

Best regards,
Anita

 I've just grabbed some OSM data using the OSM API, and traffic
signals are tagged thus:

 <node id="2405151" lat="54.0449694" lon="-2.7991142" user="Darren
Poulson" uid="23507" visible="true" version
="2" changeset="621616" timestamp="2008-01-13T14:08:27Z">
  <tag k="highway" v="traffic_signals"/>
 </node>

 That was in the XML returned by:

wget "http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-2.80,54.042,-2.77,54.045"

 so I don't know why you're not seeing them, unless you didnt get the
right area....

This my paths:

*['/usr/local/share/qgis/python', '/home/brushtyler/.qgis/python',
'/home/brushtyler/.qgis/python/plugins',
'/usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins', ... ]*

exactly as J?rgen saw.


BTW, utils.py at line 81 contains this:
*plugindirs = [
    unicode(QgsApplication.pkgDataPath()) + "/python/plugins",
    unicode(QgsApplication.qgisSettingsDirPath()) + "/python/plugins"
  ]*
So it searches for plugins in /usr and after in ~/.qgis, but
add a plugin to the list only if not already present.

Cheers.

As Juergen has written, the updateAvailablePlugins() has the purpose
to update the list of plugins - it takes just their names, not the
full path, so the order doesn't really matter. What does matter is the
order of paths in sys.path.

Agreed. How about:
- setting a new 1.6 tag
- moving all the tickets that obviously cannot be fixed soon to that tag (I
can do that)
- leaving the remaining tags to all main devs, who can choose autonomously
to either fix them or move them to 1.6
This way, no bugs will be left unnoticed, and we'll have a best compromise
between stability and frequency of release.

Marco: I agree, very frequent releases would be better, IMHO, provided that
the cost of the process is not too high. I always use the -dev version,
also for courses, and it is generally well accepted. This means to me taht
we are almost ready to release at about any point in time.

All the best.

Two notes here:
- the path u'/home/brushtyler/.qgis//python/plugins' (nearly at the
bottom) is being added redundantly within updateAvailablePlugins(). I
should probably move all plugin paths logic to QgsApplication to make
it more robust (and give preference to plugins from QGIS_PLUGINPATH
over local and global plugins).

- the last paths have been added by GdalTools (and fTools). I think
this generally is a bad idea and it should be avoided completely. If
there are any files in distinct plugins with the same file names, they
will interfere each other, leading to python errors happening only
under a specific set of loaded plugins. Second, I believe the python
plugins within QGIS source code are used as examples by other plugin
developers, so such practice of altering sys.path to include plugin
subdirs may lead to even more plugins exploiting that.

Cheers

Well, I see a big mess in my sys.path, so I can't determine, which one is 
earlier and which one is later... Here are the interesting items only:

sys.path
[(...),
'/usr/local/share/qgis/python',
'/home/borys/.qgis/python',
'/home/borys/.qgis/python/plugins', 
'/usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins',
(...),

'/home/borys/.qgis/python/plugins/GdalTools',
(...),
'~/.qgis/python',
'/usr/share/qgis/python',
'/usr/share/qgis/python/',
'/usr/share/qgis/python/',
'/usr/share/qgis/python',
(...)]

It only creates a list of module names, not module instances, so it doesn't 
matter. Loading the module is only performed in the loadPlugin method (line 
115), where it's just __import__(packageName) called, so everything should 
depend on the python pathes only.

Wait, my /usr/share/qgis is obsolete, so it should look like this:

'/usr/local/share/qgis/python',
'/home/borys/.qgis/python',
'/home/borys/.qgis/python/plugins',

Now it seems ~ is definitely later ;-)

Oh, sorry Jef, but I didn't understand that your "AFAICS that shouldn't

Hi here is some news about this software :

The source code of the plugin (for qgis 0.11.0) and SLE is available at
http://umramap.cirad.fr/amap2/logiciels_amap/index.php?page=sle

It licensed under the LGPL and requires VC++ 2008 Express/Ogre/Qt4.x for
the compilation.

There's also still the obsolete translation stuff. It should be removed now, 
when it's a core plugin. However, f you want to keep it for older Qgis 
versions, you can put it into a condition:

if QGis.QGIS_VERSION[2] < 5:
  [set paths and install the local translator]

Thanks Barry,

I found that the OSM XAPI is pretty powerful. Downloading all traffic  
signals is as easy as:

http://xapi.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/node[highway=traffic_signals][bbox=16.26,48.18,16.31,48.20]

Still the OSM plugin for QGIS doesn't seem to download/interpret/render  
traffic signals.

Best wishes,
Anita

I think they will come through as points, and OSM plugin tends to render points as one pixel so they are nearly invisible.

However, I've not confirmed as the OSM plugin crashes for me after parsing (on osx).

I did however using osm2pgsql to import the osm file generated with your above xapi request, and they show up as points (within the planet_osm_point table) with the highway field populated with the tag.

Zipped shapefile attached.

Hi

With regards to release frequency, yes 2-3 month release cycle is
ideal. I have been living in an internet black hole the last while so
its has been difficult to do that, but I am moving to a new place and
will aim to go onto a 2-3 month cycle after that.

BTW according to our Vienna discussions there would be no more 1.x
releases after 1.5 since we were going to try to put out 2.0 by years
end. We were going to make 1.9.x test builds moving up to that
release. 2.0 would be a chance to do another api clean up and rip out
old stuff (e.g. old symbology). Is everyone still happy to progress in
this way or does this all sound like news to you, the hackfest having
receded into the fog of time? :-)

Regards

Tim

There's still the roadmap for 1.0.3 in the QGIS Trac page. When will it be

Message-ID: <201006081104.18417.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Hi, after today's upgrade I started to get such error:

  File "/home/borys/.qgis/python/plugins/openlayers/openlayers_plugin.py", 
line 72, in initGui
    print "Spherical Mercator coordinate reference system is:\n  %s\n  EPSG:
%d\n  SRS ID = %d" % (crs.description(), crs.epsg(), crs.srsid())
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u0142' in position 
71: ordinal not in range(128)

It's because the CRS description is translateable and can contain non-ascii 
characters.

I see three problems here:

1) The conversion to unicode of course. 

2) I'd suggest to comment any "prints" when releasing plugins, because it make 
a little mess in the console you call qgis from :)

3) The plugin always creates a "Generated CRS...blahblah", what's a bit 
irritating, as there are already at least three Google Mercators in qgis 1.5 
standard database (epsg:900913, epsg:3857, osgeo:41001). Could it add the 
custom CRS only if necessary?

I'm not sure the code above works always.
When the QGis'll become 2.0 that condition still works? AFAIK it won't.

The plugin looks very promising on the way to make QGIS a bridge between OSM

However one ugly thing are hardcoded huge fonts in the docks. The labels are 
two times greater than rest of my qgis interface, also labels on button are 
different sizes. Couldn't they stay default (so dependent on current style)?

Right, it seems the API changes won't be so huge to block all the 1.x plugins 
by default, so they can be prepared for 2.0. So you can use:

Gis.QGIS_VERSION[0:3] < '1.5'

(sorry for previous mistake, it returns a string, not an int)

Hi

If I remember you can force Qt not to use the registry for settings
but it would require programmatic intervention.

I have the discussion from Vienna still in my weak memory :-) We were
planning the release 2.0 about the end of this year as we thought
there will be simply no other way to keep adding new features.

My personal impression is that we are not yet in a need to release 2.0
- features continue to be added incrementally and this trend will
probably continue for some more time. If we do few more 1.x releases,
the new features would also have more time to settle down and with
release of 2.0 we will only break the API, not the whole application
:) But maybe others will not agree with me.

It would be good to gather ideas what big changes should be done in
2.0 besides the general cleanup of API. From the top of my head:
1. replace old symbology with new symbology
2. replace old labeling (no collision detection) with new labeling
(based on PAL)
3. rework handling of vector features - to allow key-less tables,
multiple keys, table joins etc.
4. rework geometries - to allow more natural and faster access to geometries

For each of these items, there are reasons to postpone the transition:
1. old symbology still has some features that new symbology doesn't have
2. old labeling is much more configurable in comparison to new labeling
3. AFAIK no work has been done yet
4. it would be great to use Boost.Geometry c++ library instead of
GEOS, but it is not yet ready for our usage

Others will probably come up with more ideas (improvements to
organization of python plugins, refactoring of raster support etc.)
Hurrying with the release of 2.0 could mean that some of the important
changes will have to kept back and wait for 3.0...

Cheers
Martin

Borys,

Mybe helpfull

I make some changes in Plugin, see:
http://github.com/pka/qgis-openlayers-plugin/tree/master/openlayers/

Where:
1) Accept Proxy
2) Change the project to EPSG 900913
3) Set to "on the fly"
4) Set extent with coordinate transformed

With this the user no need make itens 2) and 3) and don?t change yours 
area of view (on the fly + Apply).

The plugin is avaible in repository (0.4 pre-release) status development 
in version 1.5

Yes agreed - you make a sound argument for plodding on with a few more
1.x releases then.

Wow! The new version works perfectly! :-) Great job!
The problem was because that "upgrade" pushed me back to 0.25. Note that 
version 0.25 is higher than 0.4 for the installer, because each section is 
considered as an integer. 

You can find it controversial, but it's better then considering version 
numbers as fractions. In such case, there were problems between versions 0.9 
and 0.10, or three-sectional versions as 0.9.1.

So instead 0.25 that version just should be named 0.2.5

B.

Hi Martin,

now the modules import is done by the following lines:
*from tools import GdalTools_utils as Utils
from tools import ( doBuildVRT, doContour, doRasterize, doPolygonize,
doMerge, doSieve, doProximity, doNearBlack )
from tools import ( doWarp, doGrid, doTranslate, doClipper, doInfo,
doProjection, doOverview, doRgbPct, doPctRgb )
from tools import ( doSettings, doAbout )*

and GdalTools works fine until I reload it.
In fact, If I reload it I get this error:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 150, in
startPlugin
    plugins[packageName] = package.classFactory(iface)
  File "/usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins/GdalTools/__init__.py", line
30, in classFactory
    from GdalTools import GdalTools
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 291, in
_import
    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
  File "/usr/local/share/qgis/python/plugins/GdalTools/GdalTools.py", line
42, in
    raise ImportError( error_str )
ImportError: cannot import name doBuildVRT


I tried to change all the import lines, using i.e.

*import tools.doBuildVRT as doBuildVRT
*

but nothing.


How can I resolve it? I guess this error it's not related with GdalTools...


Cheers.

This is an error caused by the unloader of plugins - I've found out
that it fails to record the modules that are imported with syntax
"from X import Y" and that results in some inconsistencies. I'm going
to fix that soon.

On a different note, I have a performance hint for GdalTools:
It's not necessary to import all the do* modules at the startup. They
are necessary only when they're triggered from the menu, so the import
can be postponed to the point when they're needed and some time from
the qgis startup can be saved. I see you load all the modules to check
whether there aren't any missing dependencies. This could be actually
done even easier:

try:
  import osgeo.ogr
  import osgeo.gdal
except ImportError:
  # tell user about missing python-gdal

Hi Martin,

GdalTools was based on the fTools structure.
So I think that every change we're doing on GdalTools should
be done on fTools too. Have we to inform Carson Farmer?

Yes, we could load every do* module when required (on trigger) and
on startup try to import only the required modules.
I'm going to change it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL internal libtiff
Message-ID: <AANLkTilPw3GsQ_Yn68mD47NRrdJIdWQNrj4p9hciONn1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've been compiling GDAL 1.7 using the internal tiff support (for BigTiff).
 QGIS 1.4 still requires the system libtiff to be installed, which is an
older version from what GDAL is using.  Does this cause any conflicts /
instability?  I occasionally get crashes when viewing large GeoTiffs (with
pyramids), but haven't spent much time debugging.  I ask because I'm in the
process of setting up several new machines and I'd like everything as stable
as possible, yet keep the steps simple.  I'll compile libtiff 4.0 if needed,
but only if it makes a difference.

Thanks,

Jamie

Hi

As far as I know we are not linking against libtiff so I would think
that the libtiff requirement is a cascading dependency.

Hello Borys,

Thanks so much for the feedback. Yes, I'm not skilled at all with QTDesigner, and welcome any suggestions.

I wonder, are there people in the QGIS community that do work with QTDesigner for hire?

Dane

ps. for people not sure what the "OSM Tools" plugin is, find it here:

http://qgis.dbsgeo.com

It is essentially wrappers around a few command line tools frequently used by the OSM community.

Hi, thanks for usefull plugin. Looks very promissing.
BTW, I also vote for changing fonts to widgets to default.

Lenny has Qt 4.4.3, but PyQt 4.4.2.  The former supports QFormLayout,
fortunately the later does not.   This probably should be ported to
QGridLayout.

Yes, I have read about in the past. Seems that they forgot to implement QFormLayout or something like this.

Hi guys,
should be better if I change it from QFormLayout to QGridLayout?

Cheers.

Pretty self explaining uh? ;)
As long as you don't need python - there is no problem .. but IIRC you
have to install the "python-qt4" and "python-qt4-dev package
(debian,ubuntu) probably there are some others missing too

good luck!

Message-ID: <AANLkTikSu6fTwbGNPzCUijiB4PPsKTHe0AdH2ZHdgHxB@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm creating a lot of QgsVectorLayer within a loop using a custom query
(postgres provider).
So, if some of the layers I create contain no rows, I see a message box
because the provider cannot retrieve the srid and geometry type.
This is a problem within a loop, because these message boxes stop the
execution until users press the OK button.

I think would be a good thing to have a quiet mode and a function to
retrieve the error message.
We already have vl.isValid() to test if it's all ok!

What's your opinion about it?

Cheers.

Any other comment? Can we go on with the suggested approach?
- setting a new 1.6 tag (BTW, Tim: can we get rid of old tags, e.g. 1.0.3?)
- moving all the tickets that obviously cannot be fixed soon to that tag (I
can do that)
- leaving the remaining tags to all main devs, who can choose autonomously
to either fix them or move them to 1.6.
Please let me know, so we can eventually start working on this.
All the best.

I don't think we should have a special mode for that.  That should be the
normal behaviour - invalidating the layer and offer the validation error on
request.  We could also eliminate QgsMessageOutput.

(BTW, Tim: can we get rid of old tags, e.g. 1.0.3?)

I do not think anybody is working on 1.0, right? Can we remove this?

I think it is important not to leave any bug unnoticed.

A raster system redesign would be a good thing. But it could be done as 
rasterV2 and exist in parallel to the old raster system (similarly to 
symbology-ng or new labeling).

I think it is not a good idea. This system could be confusing to final
user.

It would be interesting to find a way to reduce the amount of data fetched.
Given a high scale, it is useless to get features so tiny and thus they are
not visible on the map.

I.e. at 1:100.000 QGIS can decide to get line features with ST_LENGTH
longer than 5 meters, or polygons with ST_AREA at least 2,5 m^2.

But I don't know how this strategy would improve performance.

Hi all.
Apparently some EU states will prefer OSOR-registered projects for their national

https://forge.osor.eu/projects/qgis/
Could someone add this info to our web site?
They provide several resources, I think not so interesting to us (but one should
check better).
Obviously I'm ready to hand over the admin role to people better suited and qualified

All the best.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin1Pm_q5SWuleEZ_waDID-4hml8dNx3121Z5uH8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'd like to ask you for a permission to lift feature freeze for the
inclusion of newly implemented rule-based renderer I've been
developing recently, but I've missed the deadline due to my former
school duties. This new feature doesn't affect any existing code, so
it is very unlikely that it would bring any regressions. The patch can
be found here:

https://newtrac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/1727/rulebasedrenderer_v2.diff

The rule-based renderer is an advanced renderer for symbology-ng: it
lets user to define rules consisting of a symbol, filter and scale
range. The filters have the same SQL-like syntax as used for searching
in attribute table and in field calculator. This combination gives the
users a strong tool for customizing the appearance of the layers,
including multi-attribute rules and scale-dependent rendering.
Accompanied with python bindings, it allows 3rd party developers to
implement further functionality, such as SLD import/export,
reading/writing of Mapnik XML files and much more.

If there will be no objections, I'd be happy to commit it into the trunk.

Regards
Martin

For me the main goal of 1.5 is more complete implementation of the new 
symbology & labelling, so it's a good reason for an exception.

Not that my vote has to count, but this would be very useful. Borys summed it nicely wrt symbology and labeling being the cornerstone improvements in this release.

 You don't need an IDE to develop software, and I think it is wrong
for a project to impose an IDE onto developers since choice of IDE is
a matter of personal preference. I feel sick when a project's build
requirements starts with "First install Eclipse (you need version
2.3.431 from the latest SVN sources)" or similar.

 If you want you can develop Qgis using Notepad.exe and compile from
the C: prompt. Or you might be able to use Eclipse. Personally, I edit
stuff in Emacs and build from the command line.

 The Qt GUI designer, "designer", is used for making dialogs but that
doesn't extend to code.

I would love to see this. In my projects it is quite commont that I need 
to symbolize based on different attributes. Up to now I did it through a 
Postgis view which concatenated all attributes and I ended up with a 
long list of various combinations.

Such a rule-based renderer would simplify my life.

However, this is only from a user perspective. I can't judge codewise.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] My first mistake
Message-ID: <001201cb08ec$b6daae80$ea0110b6@deltha>

I am trying to compile the sources to understand and to develop on them, but the first code line into the main.cpp file will give me error.  
#include <QBitmap>    
Where the compiler will find QBitmap? I'm using a portable C++ compiler for Windows, Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2. What can I do?

You probably need the QT SDK installed so you have all the libraries
that are used to build the interface.

Looks like SVN/TRAC migration including the DNS update is finished.  Replace
newtrac with trac.

Thanks, It would be fine to fix it ASAP, because it is blocking to build QGIS for all Debian Stable users.

I agree with Juergen. The current way of reporting errors is just a
legacy from the early days where there was no expectation that
providers would be instantiated in a different way than directly from
QGIS application.

Hi Simon,

you could get these settings from QgsProject instance by querying the
list of layers, list of snapping tolerances etc. You can find out more
in QgsMapCanvasSnapper class:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/src/gui/qgsmapcanvassnapper.cpp
(look into snapToBackgroundLayers function, starting at line 128)

A word of caution: the entries related to snapping in QgsProject are
not a part of public API, so their semantics may change without a
prior notice (though I don't expect this to happen anytime soon).

Message-ID: <20100611141155.7863fd2d@nature.site>

Hi, 

we are going to migrate qgis web and wiki to a new server. Therefore we
would kindly ask you to:

a) not make any changes to the qgis website at the moment. The website is
already migrated, and we don't want to make or plan another update during
the next days.

b) not make any changes to the qgis wiki starting from monday 14.6.09, 6am
UTC. I will migrate the wiki on monday, so all changes you might make on
that day might get lost. 

If everything works well, web and wiki will be available and readable all the
time. The switch of the domains qgis.org and qgis.osgeo.org from the old to
the new server will probably happen on monday or tuesday at the latest. 

I write another email, when everything works again as usual

sorry for the inconvenience
 Otto

Hi all.
Various issues:

# kernel analysis crash with:

The program 'R' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.

(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line

Message-ID: <4C1274F2.50801@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Pending further comments, I have created the 1.6 tag and I'm revising the existing
1.5 tags to see if they can be moved to 1.6. I have also created a report for issues
classified as blocking for the release (https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/report/16).
Cleaning up the queue is a large task (346 tickets currently assigned to 1.5:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&group=status&order=priority&milestone=Version+1.5.0),
so we need the help of everybody, especially original reporters of the bugs.
It is clear that, if we want to release 1.5 soon (and we *want* do that), only a few
tickets should be left with the 1.5 tag, so careful scrutiny is necessary.
Looking forward for your help.
All the best.

Hi all.
Is someone working, or planning to work in the foreseeable future, on releasing an
update version in the 1.0 series?
If not, I suggest to remove the 1.0.3 tag, and move/close the relative tickets as
appropriate. If not, users can be deceived waiting for something that will not happen.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Possible version 1.5 Bug? QGIS Development Version
	- Error Trying to Open GeoTIFF
Message-ID: <2D7230119FDBCE4DB0984678195B9200FCFB5D@OC1EX04.ME.MBGOV.CA>

Sorry, I was in a hurry the first time that I sent this and omitted the
actual error message. The gist of my problem is that I cannot load a
GeoTiff into the latest development version but can load the same image
into older QGIS versions. Is the development team aware of this problem
and do they plan to fix it for the 1.5 release?

Yesterday I downloaded the latest development version of OSGEO4W QGIS
(1.5.0 code version 13686) and tried opening a GeoTIFF SPOT image and
got the error message:

"E:/SPOT_imagery_mosaic_misty_lake_mb.tif is not a supported raster data
source"

I confirmed that I could open the image in QGIS 1.1 and 1.3 so it looks
like the problem is with the development version. Here is the
information about the image from GDALINFO:

Exactly: I want to check all the tickets, as we have some of rubbish around, and
sooner or later someone has to deal with it.

Not so long: I started with about 400 tickets, and we're now close to 100.
I also reassigned tickets with no milestone, and from 1.0.3 to 1.6 whenever appropriate.
Of course I can make mistakes, but I guess reading the tickets is a safer way.
I think now main devs have an easier task: just go through the remaining ~100 tickets
[0] and either:
- close them if inappropriate
- move to 1.6 or 2.0 if too complex to be fixed in the remaining time frame
- fix them if possible.
I believe this approach needs some effort, but will end up in 1.5 being the best
version ever (as it is true for every release, isn't it? :) ).
BTW: what do you think of removing/closing the 1.0.3 milestone?
All the best.

My pleasure - and I'm learning a lot more things about QGIS in the process.
Now it's your (you all) turn to have a look to the (relatively few) remaining tickets.

The SWF movie is not free-software-friendly.
It targets latest-and-greatest-and-least-supported version
of flash player. In particular, it uses the newer bytecode
thus requiring vesion 2 of the flash virtual machine, which
no popular free software player implements.

Where does it come from ? Can the author be contacted about it ?

I believe it's the http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TracMetrixPlugin and
looking at their docs/code they use the Yahoo charts api. I doubt Yahoo
cares.

If you have any suggestions for alternative Trac plugins that do the
similar metrics with a different output options I'd be interested. It's
unlikely the makers of the current plugin plan to change.

I guess I find it odd too since numpy is being used on the backend, why
not use matplotlib to produce some images that can be tossed into the
page. While the charts feature hover overs, I don't see much added value
from the use of flash at all in this case.

Thanks,
Alex

Sorry, I didn't noticed there was some flash inside. Quite unuseful, I think.

Hi all.
This brings another, more general question: how are going to deal with plugins? We
have a number of them that, even if they're not official, are so useful and widely
used we cannot afford missing. It has already happened several times now (and many
more times will happen in the future) that someone can and wants to improve someone
else's plugin, provide a patch, or simply to notify a bug. I think a trac is a
necessity now.
So I'm suggesting to open a separate trac, e.g. https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis-addons/
Alternatively, this could be a separate branch of the current trunk.
I can provide a script that automatizes plugin package generation from svn (we're
using it for our Faunalia plugins since several months now).
The only additional work for the admins would therefore be to grant selective access
to the addons to interested devs, but that's not too bad (and I can help if nobody
else has the time to do it). Of course any additional help is warmly welcomed.
Please let me know your feelings about this proposal.
All the best.

I've brought this up several times in the past too. Something similar to
http://trac-hacks.org would be great, especially if we can integrate it
with pyqgis.org so that you could click through the web to release a new
version to the xml repos.

I'll look into options, that would allow plugin authors or qgis devs to
grant access to plugins in an easy manner (through the web).

Would it make sense to do something more similar to github/bitbucket
where anyone can branch anyone else's stuff there just needs to be
cooperation to merge back?

Thanks,
Alex

It happens quite often, so the svn could be really big convenience! Also a 
possibility to assign "many to many" devs to plugins is often requested (now I 
have to totally change the ownership of abandoned plugins). The third priority 
is automatic zip packaging and metadata generation, as such human mistakes 
happens every one month.

svn + the publishing script + trac seems to be the solution for all major 
problems. It's simple, convenient, powerful and flexible. It doesn't break the 
existing plugin system and opens a way to painlessly introduce new features 
(as keywords, categories, screenshots) to all plugins at once by an admin. It 
even allows to create automatic changelogs for plugins that don't contain 
them. Trac support can be even implemented in the installer for easier bug 
reporting. In one world - it's exactly what we need.

No problem for me, it's much more convenient that the present juggling with 
zip files :) It's a shame on me, that I still have no time for improving this 
system.

There's also one more important question. In Vienna we talked about making the  
repository a proxy to another ones. The main reasons were:
- performance: only one http request for fetching all metadata
- safety: possibility to lock broken/malicious plugin
- quality: on-the-fly testing of the zip package and metadata consistency 

Now, with the trac, I wonder if author's repositories are necessary at all? 
What about asking all authors for moving all their public plugins to the main 
svn? There will be still the possibility to add an external repo for e.g. 
internal purposes, but there will be no list of known 3rd party repos any 
more. What do you think?

Or does it work in SVN, if that is easier to answer?

Of course, it should be integrated. But it must be disputed how to trigger the 
release? Also, how to maintain multiple versions? E.g. one stable and one 
development. Should they be maintained in separate directories? If so, a 
synchronization tool would be nice... A lot of questions, but I believe 
there's a good basis in the end :)

It's essential :)

Won't it result with still growing number of branches? I think it's not 
necessary, I prefer the previous idea. Witch svn, everyone can just send a 
patch to the author.

Thanks for the replies, and the interest on my proposal. I think the issues are:

- separate trac, or a branch of the current one?
- administering users: the plugin http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SvnAuthzAdminPlugin is
certainly useful, but the current administrator should decide which one is the most
convenient for him (BTW: who is managing SVN permissions now?)
- user permissions: I do not think we need a complex many-to-many relation between
authors and plugins (could be a nightmare to administer): I suggest we can trust our
authors (we are dealing with third-party plugins, after all), and grant permissions
to the whole qgis-addons tree; this will also make easier for all authors to give a
hand to other projects when needed
- how to release: our script make a new release for every commit for experimental;
when it's ready, we commit to the stable branch, and it get autoreleased; I think it
is simple and efficient (it can certainly be improved, though)
- svn or git: I vote for svn, so to keep the same structure for the whole of qgis; we
can move everything to git when needed, but keeping two different systems is
potentially confusing and discouraging
- main repo as proxy: +1 for me; let's remove additional repos, to be used as sandbox
only.

If we can solve the few above-mentioned questions, I think we can implement this
rather easily and quickly.
All the best.

Could be doable within the same trac but potentially confusing.
Advantage, bugs and tickets are all filed in one place - disadvantage,
same thing(Could be solved by better tags and filtering). If the svn is
2 repos then it would have to be 2 trac sites.
This might be safer for the core code, preventing accidental slips in
permission changes and accidental writes. Sanity would dicate that we
just make a new folder in the main svn called PluginRepo or something of
the sort.

Currently svn permissions are by web script that qgis admins have access
to - Tim, Gary for sure, possibly Otto, Macho, and ?
I would consider it clumsy for fine grained permissions by plugin but ok
for granting access to all plugins(see comments below)

I do think developers might want to be able to control a little bit of
what goes on, otherwise the main QGIS devs have to vet applications for
access, since a single bad allow could cause days of work to correct.
Also I know for some plugins in their early stages coordination with the
main author is extremly important. They are mini projects on their own,
especially complex plugins, it might be very frustrating to have new
people experimenting in your plugin without your knowledge.

I think a similar workflow, of become known, submit patches against
plugin, ask for permission is the better model. Both the maintainer of
the plugin and the QGIS devs could be the gatekeepers (ie need 1 of them
to grant permission).

Of Course the main QGIS devs will be given access so that they can grant
 access to new people if it ever appears abandoned.

Alternate - plugin development agreement before given access with the
understanding that you will ask the other devs on a plugin before making
changes. In this case it would be an all or none.

The key here is were trying to encourage collaboration but not create
unusable spaghetti.

I've started working on a new plugin to package (make zips while
dropping things like .svn/.cvs files), we could use the same backend of
such a script with a form front end as a track plugin to allow for "New
Release" and "New Experimental Release" buttons.

Not all work happens in branches, I do bugfixing in my trunk sometimes
but I don't want to annoy the user with a new release 4 times in one
day, or before it's ready. It's an intentional decision to release a new
version.

I vote svn, keep it simple

Hi,

This is for developers who compile on Windows. Do any of you have windows
builds built with qt 4.6x? The downloadable windows builds on the QGIS
website are all built with 4.5x.

I wonder if bug https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2239 still exists with
qt4.6?

Thank you if someone could test it with a qt4.6 windows build.

Andreas

FYI, Last I heard it's only available for QGIS 1.5(aka Trunk) builds of
QGIS.

Any other comment? Can we proceed? If yes, I'm available for help.
BTW: joining repos seems important: today 2 or 3 3rd party repos were down, pretty

I'm extremely busy till June 25th, then I'll join the battle. Now I can only 
update the installer before the string freeze 21st. 

I think we can assume there are no objections to proceed :) There are only 
three steps necessary now: the svn branch, the script and the manual trigger 
for releasing. If we won't decide what to do with the privilege system, I can 
manage them.

PS. Oh, and a manual for new devs, how to use svn...

Need to hit that at http://www.osor.eu/projects/qgis (drop the s from
https otherwise it wants a password).

It's interesting in concept, am I correct in understanding that it's a
publicly funded sourceforge type cite for Open Source in public sector
use for Europe. Very curious, though I doubt many projects will rely on
it for their hosting needs.

Thanks for the link,

Correct, and I agree is curious. But I think it is good to be there, not to be overlooked, especially by EU public administration.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] free hand editing plugin
Message-ID: <1276696665.8357.98.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

I have just seen and tested the freehand editing plugin; it is pretty
cool and it will be very useful! I would like to thank the developer and
leave here some feedback:

*) when a features is drawn the pop up window to enter attributes does
not show

*) the plugin needs to be activated every time qgis starts

*) when toogling editing on already existing vectors sometimes the tool
does not become available (clickable) in the toolbar

*) changing the tolerance does not seems to have effects when editing
lines

*) it does not seems to do the snapping, maybe is on purpose?


I tested it under qgis-dev/osgeo4w under windows Seven (I don't have
qgis working in my Ubuntu box right now).


thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help: how create a spatialite db and layers
Message-ID: <AANLkTikM98B_QegOR9pkrT3EjLhUZTsY9SFoeVAc6SwX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm working on rt_postgres_extractor python plugin.
Its aims is to extract some geometries by intersecting a postgis table with
one or more polygons.
Users can choose to export the output in shapefile, kml, spatialite.

I use QgsVectorFileWriter and the postgres provider (with custom query)
to export the output layers to either shapefiles or kml.

Instead, if I want to create a spatialite db and add the output layers to it

I could use the OGR/GDAL lib (the spatialite support is present from ogr
1.7) .

Do you know if there are other ways to do this without using ogr2ogr?

Thanks!

Great. So let's postpone it after the 25th. The main issue remaining is: separate svn
(always on osgeo, I hope) or a branch of the existing one?
Any thoughts?
As for permissions, I think it is good to have a permission master (Borys) and a
backup one (I can do that, if nobody else pops up).
Then we can set up an autopackaging (for experimental) + autoreleasing (for stable)
script, possibly based on what we're using now at Faunalia.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proportional Graduated Circle
Message-ID: <4C194A41.7090304@enoreth.net>

Hi,

I would like to re-open the discussion about the way QGIS deals with
proportional symbols : for now it's is possible to assign a size scale
using a field, the symbol will take this value as its size in point.

This subject has previously been talked on this list [1] and a ticket
(#960) about it has been set as wontfix but still today, the most 
frequent question I get on meeting, on forums, from students is "how to 
make proportional symbols ?", behind it what these people are really 
asking for is if it's possible to do what they're used to on MapInfo, 
Arcgis, CrimeStat, Spotfire, etc. The point in 2008 was that the 
feature's usefulness was not obvious so here is some thoughts on it.

The downside of the actual qgis's method is :
- value = point size, if the values are hight (like for a city
population field) the biggest symbol will hide its neighborhood (causing
some visual glitches when too near)
- necessity to set by hand a correct size, by creating a new field or by
changing the size by class (throw in it someone who wnat a proportional 
circle for class range and you're set)
- the size doesn't show up into the legend

Many articles have been written about these proportional circles  such 
as James Flannery's dissertation called ?The Graduated Circle: A 
Description, Analysis, and Evaluation of a Quantitative Map Symbol? with
gives a formula (used in ArcGIS [2]) :

"Taking the median of the results from several parts of the data, he
offered the following formula as his best estimate of the relationship
of apparent circular area (Yc) to the logarithm of actual area (X),
raised by an exponent and multiplied by a scaling constant" Daniel R.
Montello, Cognitive Map-Design Research in the 20th Century: Theoretical
and Empirical Approaches

While an absolute scale is more scientifically correct (Tufte, 1998), 
the compensated proportional circle still has its benefits and users.

I must admit that psychophysical's studies are quite an interesting read :)

trying to save a map as a GIF-image failed here on trunk on ubuntu 10.04

Only a gifw world file is written with me, no gif-image.

Can other people confirm this? If so I'll file an issue for it.

to get things like the layer name and the textstring imported into the
SHAPE files using this plugin?

If there is not, are there any plans to extend this plugin to do this?
If help is needed to work on improving this plugin, I would be
interested in lending a hand since I am keen on seeing this
functionality added.

I think we need the PSC to weigh in on what they would prefer in terms
of single or separate svn.

A permissions master, aka account approver would be ok. I think that's
how trac-hacks does it. We would need to some sort of plugin contributor
agreement I think and clear limits on what is/is not allowed (ie only
plugins with certain licensing would be permitted).

FYI, I also now have a test script that is working for bundling up a
directory of files with exclusion filters into a zip ready for upload.
I'm now working to turn it into a plugin, but the backend was designed
to work separate from the interface so it can easily be reused inside
trac. I'll be happy to post it as soon as we've got the repo going, in
the meantime if anyone wants to see the code let me know and I'll come
up with something.

Thanks,
Alex

I do not think anybody is working on it, and I agree improvements are much
needed. Your input would be greatly appreciated.
You can submit it as patches on the trac.

Good day,

SQL Anywhere 12---the soon-to-be-released next version of the DBMS from
Sybase iAnywhere---will offer spatial support modelled after the SQL/MM and
OGC standards.  I am interested in opinions as to the best way to interface
QGIS as a front-end GIS application backed by an SA12 database, ideally
approaching the capabilities and ease-of-use of the current PostGIS
interface.  In other words, I would like to achieve:
1. the DBMS's spatial capabilities (in particular, the spatial indexes) are
exploited; and
2. the installation/configuration of new clients using this setup is as
painless as possible.


>From my initial investigation of the QGIS documentation, I can see four
different possibilities (some of which may not actually work):

Option 1: Write an SA12 data provider plugin for QGIS in C++
  Pros: efficiency
  Cons/Questions: I'm not clear if or how C++ data providers can be
dynamically added to an existing QGIS installation.
    a. Is there a way to add new C++ plugins without recompiling the
source?
    b. If not, what is the QGIS policy on adding user-provided C++ plugins
to distributed binaries?

Option 2: Write an SA12 data provider plugin for QGIS in Python
  Pros: distribution/management is taken care of by the Python plugin
manager
  Cons/Questions:
    a. Is this even possible?  Looking through the repositories, I can't
find an example of a data provider written in python, or at least not one
that that allows definition of a DBMS-backed layer with full read/write
access.
    b. If it is possible, any idea on what the performance hit would be
compared to C++?

Option 3: Write an extension to the GDAL/OGR library for SA12, to be
accessed via "Add Vector Layer" -> Source Type = Database -> Type = SA12
  Pros: usability beyond QGIS to any OGR application
  Cons/Questions:
    a. if you currently try this and choose Type=Postgres, the new layer
has less capabilities than a native PostGIS layer (it disallows feature
deletion, along with certain other operations).  Is this a limitation of
the OGR interface, or is it a limitation of the OGR-PostgreSQL module?
    b. currently there are OGR modules available for Informix Datablade,
Oracle Spatial, ESRI GeoDatabase, etc.; however, a default QGIS
installation (v1.5) only lists the following Types: ODBC, ESRI, OGDI,
PostgreSQL, MySQL.  Assuming an OGR module was written for SA12, how would
one get it added to the drop-down list within the QGIS "Add Vector Layer"
dialogue?

Option 4: Use  "Add Vector Layer" -> Source Type = Database -> Type = ODBC
  Pros: no source code changes required
  Cons/Questions:
    a.  the generic OGR ODBC driver appears to be read-only.  This is
limiting and not acceptable in the long term, but possibly okay as a first
attempt.
    b.  I don't see how this could possibly exploit the spatial
capabilities of the DBMS, since the generated SQL queries will be
DBMS-agnostic.  If the spatial indexing can't be utilized then this option
is not sufficient.

Thanks for any suggestions or other advice you are willing to offer.

I would recommend that approach.  That's also what we use for PostGIS and
SpatiaLite.

Yes.  You can simply add them to the plugin directory and qgis will pick them
up.  The libraries and headers you need to link against are include in the
installation.

But the C++ ABI is fragile and might break from QGIS build to build, even when
the API doesn't.  So the provider might need rebuilds for each QGIS build.

Contributing the provider instead of distributing it yourself might be another
option.

The bindings to QgsVectorDataProvider are there.  So it should be possible, but
I never tried.

The OGR provider queries OGR about the capabilities of the data source.

Looks like OGR's pg provider doesn't fully respond to that.  Eg.
OGR_L_DeleteFeature should work for PG datasources, although
OGR_L_TestCapability on "DeleteFeature" returns false.

So yes, it's a limitation of the OGR PG driver and not QGIS OGR provider.

OGR doesn't have metadata on how datasource names are constructed.  So the QGIS
UIs were handcrafted.  So they are probably incomplete. 

And the UIs are not part of the providers.  So you'd need to provide a separate
plugin to provide a UI to add SA12 layers or contribute patches for the OGR
dialog.

To clarify: currently there is no support for loading data providers
written in Python, only C++ providers are supported. Using Python for
data provider that should access lots of features will likely bring
quite some overhead, so I would strongly recommend C++ anyway.

Not all tests pass on my computer (actually 7 out of 15 fail).
If you run 'make test' and all tests just immediately fail, make sure
you've done 'make install' before to ensure that QGIS installation is
in place where the tests will expect it. Second, you will probably
need to set path to QGIS libraries directory if you install to
non-standard path (use environment variable PATH on windows or
LD_LIBRARY_PATH on linux).

Hi,

Here is my proposal for replacing the actual download pages :

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download%2Bwip

The wiki page shows the global hierarchy, it would results in 5 small 
different pages on joomla's website. The OS icons of the manual could be 
used.

in the end, it will be less complete than the tables we have now but 
less prone to error or misinterpretation. The user is pointed to the 
current release in priority.

And it allows me to place my favourite citation :) : "A designer knows 
he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but 
when there is nothing left to take away." Antoine de Saint-Exupery

So feel free to modify and complete this page !

Regards,

Jean Roc

Thank you, Martin!

Yes, I realized you need it installed, which is a pity, because you can't use 
it before packaging to RPM. I also had the experience that some tests failed, 
others didn't.

Are the tests still maintained?

Thanks Jean Roc.
I do not think we are going to support 1.0 anymore, so this section 
should be removed.
For the rest I think it is a good improvement, but I think more detailed 
instructions should be provided, especially for osgeo4w.

Hi All,

the mentioned before date: 12-15 November for the next hackfest is
confirmed at the University of Wroclaw (Poland) as available.

If that term is ok with you, we would like to start organising :)

Hi all,

I'd like to ask for SVN write access. I read and abide the Contributor
Requirements and Responsibilities [0].
My main commits will be on translation files, but I'm interested also
in the main code development.
I'd also be proud to be the first woman in the dev team :)

Hi Anne

Do you have a specific area for development? Because in the development team, 
the policy is to give write access only to code maintainers 
(http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Project_Organigram#Code_Maintainers). The idea is 
that for occasional changes, patches should be sent to the corresponding 
maintainer (via trac).

For translations, just send your .ts files to Werner to commit.

> I'd also be proud to be the first woman in the dev team :)

I think everyone that contributes to the code is a part of the dev team, 
regardless of svn permission.

Best regards,
Marco

Well, you don't have to create a package just to run the tests: I
usually compile qgis and install it to a local directory e.g.
~/qgis/inst, additionally when playing around with tests, it's not
necessary to also install the tests - simply enter e.g. tests/src/core
within your build directory and modify/compile/run the tests.


> Are the tests still maintained?

Our long-term goal is to have at least core and gui library covered
well with the tests, but the tests are not getting enough attention
from the developers. So, yes, they are maintained, but not very
actively. I hope once we will have a buildbot running, things will
improve.

Hi Marco, devs,

the area I want to help on is the python plugins, I can start by
submitting patches to Borys.

> For translations, just send your .ts files to Werner to commit.

actually IMHO it will be faster to commit directly, especially for
regular translators, but I also understand that giving access to the
whole codebase to translators is not ideal. Would it be possible to
grant write access to translators only to i18n folder?

Hi Robert.
Thanks for this. IMHO, we would need the source of all images within the qgis trunk.

Hi all.
The release of 1.5 is due in a week. We still have about 70 open tickets with 1.5 as
target:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/roadmap
I know I'm boring, but: may I ask all the ticket reporters to check if the ticket can
be moved to the 1.6 release without major damages to qgis, and the developers to
check if they have time to fix some of these, and move the others to 1.6? We can do
it automatically, but I think a quick check would be much better, not missing easy
fixes, and not overlooking serious issues.
Thanks a lot.

Werner is developing  something on joomla that will guide the user to a 
page corresponding to his OS (like the actual download system on the 
GRASS website).

As you previously suggested, I'll add more informations for the Windows 
installation but it would be great if every linux user could fills the 
empty part about their favourite distribution.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikY4m2SAoOFJJWrEWqT3EQtR2aRTt-tMZNTneoy@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Seems there is a problem with the checks made by the postgis provider
and views, because it complains about missing uniques int4 values when
we put a unique constraint on the gid::int4 primary key, and all goes
fine if we drop the constraint Oo. Here is a example, made on 2
postgis servers :

Table :
CREATE TABLE spatial.commune
(
  code_insee character varying(5),
  region character varying(20),
  the_geom geometry,
  gid serial NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT commune_pkey PRIMARY KEY (gid),
  CONSTRAINT unique_gid UNIQUE (gid),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_dims_the_geom CHECK (st_ndims(the_geom) = 2),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_geotype_the_geom CHECK (geometrytype(the_geom) =
'MULTIPOLYGON'::text OR the_geom IS NULL),
  CONSTRAINT enforce_srid_the_geom CHECK (st_srid(the_geom) = 2154)
)

View creation:
CREATE VIEW test AS
SELECT * FROM spatial.commune

Calling the view doesn't work, unless the unique_gid constraint is dropped.
Tested with postgresql 8.4.2 and 8.4.4 with postgis 1.5, QGIS 1.5 on
Ubuntu 10.04

Cheers

Hi Lionel,

If you define a column as a primary key, you don't need to define it as
unique as well. A primary key is unique per definition - so the unique
constraint is redundant.

Of course QGIS should still handle this properly. I also had some issues
with views and primary key detection ...

Andreas

I have just seen that in the plugins repositories there is the "new"

The plugin seems to have been installed but I don't know where. Probably
the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.
Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find
the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It
also means that I won't be able to determine if this plugin is installed
and inform you about available updates. However the plugin may work.
Please contact the plugin author and submit this issue.

on both linux and windows.

Then it appears among the installed plugins (and works too) but also

Hi Giovanni,
I find the issue. Both the folder within the zip package and the package
must have the same name.

@ Ghislain: you can fix it by renaming the package to valuetool.zip .
AFAIK valuetool-0.3 isn't a valid plugin folder name.

Cheers.

It can be either valuetool.zip or valuetool.0.3.zip - if you want to use a 
suffix, it MUST be after a dot, not a dash. The directory inside can't contain 
any suffix.

Message-ID: <AANLkTildNDCvKJIlCuEgUFnqLS-qfimxm9sy9BhVs4Cd@mail.gmail.com>

Some comments after using Photo2Shape version 0.1.14

1. The error message that appears when no co-ordinates were found says
"The following files does added ...". This could be "The following
files were not added ...".
2. On the above mentioned message window the tick box "Show this
message again" does not work. Unticked the message still appears.
3. If no geotagged photos are found an empty shapefile is created.
4. The title on the main dialog box says "Images to shapefile".
Perhaps this should be "Photo2Shape"?
5. On Ubuntu the two browse buttons display file selection dialogs
with different styles. The photo selection dialog looks like Nautilus,
but the shapefile selection dialog looks different.
6. The qml file contains Russian text for the default label.
7. The camera symbols do not turn yellow when selected on the map canvas.
8. The camera symbols are replaced with dots if the symbology is
changed. Try adding labels for example.

Besides these minor issues the plugin works very well and I
successfully processed a few hundred photos. Thank you :)

Hi all.
Robert Szczepanek kindly provided us with the svg source for the gis theme. I think
they should reside in trunk. The question is: where to put them? And: should we
generate the images/themes/gis/ from the svg at compile time?
All the best.

Here is the latest version of gis theme SVG source.
You can put it in right SVN directory.

- LAN WiFi 54Mb/s, access point dedicated to the event,
- optional LAN cable connection 100Mb/s,
LAN is connected to academic backobone by 100Mb/s fiber optic.

As usual detailed information can be found on our wiki pages:
Timing: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/4._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Wroclaw_2010#Timing
Venue: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/4._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Wroclaw_2010#Venue
Accommodation: http://www.qgis.org/wiki/4._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Wroclaw_2010#Accommodation_and_Costs

PS. Tim, the Department of Climatology is perhaps the best one to ask
for preparing good weather. As you look at google maps they have lots
of toys on their lawn which, I assume, do that :) MN

Message-ID: <AANLkTin3dQfhHlAPS8p6MJssImrkbZw4ESRcZAh07pVU@mail.gmail.com>

Potential small bug found during a training course:

If there are two versions of the same PostGIS layer open and
symbolised, one with a WHERE clause, and the other without (i.e. one
should have a filter and one shouldn't), when exporting to a map file
(layers only), both layers appear to have the filter applied. Can
anyone else confirm this? We're using QGIS 1.4 with latest mapserver
export plugin, using local postgis server....

Let me know if you need any further info...

Hello PSC and other interested devs ;)

As we spoken a few days ago, we need the PSC decision for a few questions:

1. Do we go on at all? :)

2. Where to put the svn?
    a) branch of the existing qgis svn
    b) a separate svn on osgeo
    c) pyqgis.org (on the present server)
    d) on osgeo and park the pyqgis.org domain there
    e) yet another idea?

3. In case if pyqgis.org doesn't host the svn, where to put the output 
repository.xml?
    a) on osgeo only
    b) on osgeo, and make a proxy on pyqgis.org
    c) the script on osgeo uploads all onto pyqgis.org

As soon as we find answers for the questions, we can go on:

- set up the repository, the script, triggers for releasing etc.
- replace the present repository.xml on pyqgis.org
- write a short svn tutorial for plugin authors 
- request authors to move their plugins to the svn

From this point, qgis will use the new repository (if we keep the url on 
pyqgis.org) and the author repositories will be redundant. When only most 
authors move to the svn, I'll release the Installer update with shortened 
plugin list. Necessary strings went to i18n files already.

Then will be time for better permission system (initially I can manage 
permissions manually) and further improvements: keywords, categories, ratings 
etc.

As we're freezing tomorrow, I think it makes no sense to adjust the Installer 
to the new urls now and then start to implement all this stuff and try to 
manage on the release time :)

You will still be able to add an external repository of course, however I'm 
going to completely drop the "Add known 3rd party repositories" button. So 
adding an external repository will be completely on your own and we will take 
no responsibility on it. The reason is still growing number of problems:

- fetching repositories take more and more time
- it happens every few days that one of the repos is down
- it happens every two weeks that a zip package and/or metadata is broken (I 
must admit this problem is bigger in the cental repository, but used to happen 
everywhere)
- we have no possibility to immediately disable an invalid plugin until a 
problem is fixed.

In Vienna we were talking about a proxy to author repositories, but seems 
nobody has time to develop so huge application (It would need to unpack zip 
packages to load the modules and rebuild metadata etc). So I like the Paolo's 
idea to create a more friendly and powerful solution on the pyqgis.org to 
attract more authors.

Anyway, we can just move the present central repositories to the svn solution 
in the first step and then try to encourage owners of external repositories to 
join. Even the first step would be a great improvement.

Will it be possible to control access to a particular plugin in the

developers) will prefer to limit changes/developments to their own
team (in some cases, this is a requirement of funding). I am pleased
to hear that external repositories will still be usable, wouldn't it
be relatively simple to have a web interface where authors could
submit their repository, and then have the installer simply add these
repos if the user wishes to add them? My concern with a completely
centralised system is that while we gain in control and (potentially)
stability, we lose in flexibility, and quite possibly usability. As it
is (fyi: I am not necessarily suggesting the current way is the way
things should be), it is quite easy for plugin authors to create a
plugin, create a repo, and host their plugins for all to access.
However, as you have mentioned, we (Borys) need to hard-code the repos
to the plugin installer for them to be added to the 'add 3rd party
repos' button, Well what about if the installer simply fetched a list
of 3rd party repos from the server, based on a list of submitted repos
via a web interface similar to the one for adding plugins to the
current repository? This alleviates the pressure on Borys and the rest
of the team in terms of keeping things up to date, and the repos that
are down will simply time-out, and if the repos have problems, their
plugins will simple not be available until those problems are fixed?
Perhaps I am over simplifying things here, but my concern is that we
will loose many valuable plugins simply because we are imposing
structure on plugin developers who may not want it (i.e. they might
already have their own code repository that they prefer using, or
indeed do not want to have to learn an additional tool such as svn).

I hope I'm not being a pain here, but I want to make sure that any
changes that are made, are only made if they significantly improve
both the user and developer experience.

Regards,

Carson

 What would stop me writing an 'Add 3rd party repositories' plugin to
Qgis, and having that hosted in the main Qgis repositories?

 Eventually it might become such a useful add-on it could be folded
back into core Qgis... Wait, what?

Both fixed in 0.1.15. If no geotagged photos are found - there is no
output shapefile created. Title of the main dialog fixed.

For folder selection plugin call standard open dialog. For shapefile
selection used special dialog with additional codepage selector. Same
dialog used by QGIS when you add an shapefile.

Fixed in 0.1.15, now default label in English

This is not a plugin issue. Point features with SVG markers are not
highlighted when they are selected.

I'll look on this.

if I'm not wrong they are highlighted in qgis trunk.

Hi All

What blockers are there for the release still? I checked last night
there were about 78 open bugs for 1.5. Can we go ahead and branch for
release or does someone want to pare that list down to the last few
critical bugs?

Regards

Hi Carson,

I can confirm the bug. It is not a typical postgis layer bug. It's the 
fact that the layers have the same (display)name in qgis, which are then 
used to store and retrieve them from a dictionary.

Besides this being a bug, it's also wrong because WMS-layers should have 
unique names anyway.

Tried to fix it now, but ... failed
Please file a bug.

Hi all.
I think we cannot ship 1.5 with broken fTools; see #2430, #2735. Shouldn't be too
difficult to fix, as they used to work until recently.
All the best.

#2794 is not blocking but would likely leave a "hole" in the UI. The
risk is that new users may not understand why qgis GRASS raster
properties are not working.
