Agreed. IMHO fixing those 21 bugs would be an enormous achievement, no
need to worry of anything more for now.

Hi, I saw in several mails this problem, but I couldn't get a good solution

I have this error after doing make from qgis makefile:

It fails with geos3.0.0rc3 or with geos 3.0.rc4...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] changes in RFC page and template
Message-ID: <200707021525.23053.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi all,

I made some changes to the RFC page and template. The new template considers 
that community members should have the possibility to make comments and the 
author should have the possibility to react to the comments. The new 
procedure is (http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/RequestForComment) :

1. Author makes an RFC page in the wiki and announces RFC comment period on 
the developer and user mailing lists

2. Community members have five (working) days to give comments (directly on 
the wiki page)

3. Author states, how he plans to consider or not consider the comments (also 
on wiki page)

4. Author announces voting on RFC on developer and user mailing lists

5. Community members have five (working) days to give their votes on the wiki 
page (using -1, 0, +1)

6. RFC is accepted or refused


For complicated issues, it might also be possible that several iterations are 
needed. However, to make the RFC process as simple (and usable) as possible, 
only one iteration is considered for now. If we have many complicated and 
controversal issues, we might still extend the RFC process as necessary.


Regards,
Marco

Hi:

there are an idea to write a plugin for mysql, it sounds interesting. Are there somebody working on it? if not, where can I start

Hi Godofredo,

This is good news! Afaik, nobody works at mysql support at the moment.

>if not, where can I start and what could be better to write a provider
> and a plugin for mysql or develop a plugin that works on top of ogr
> provider?

I would suggest to write a plugin for the gui and use the ogr provider. Just 
because it is much work to write an own provider for mysql. And I hoipe by 
using the ogr provider, it will also be possible to use your plugin to access 
oracle spatial through ogr.

Stephan Holl once wrote a plugin for accessing oracle through ogr. 
http://www.holl-land.de/blog/index.php/2006/12/23/oracle-plugin-for-qgis/

The plugin is probably not up to date with the newest changes in qgis core. 
But it may be a good start point.

And for plugin writing in general, there are the materials of my foss4g2006 
workshop 
(http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=50&sessionId=66&confId=1)

Best regards,
Marco

I think using the OGR provider is also the right approach--it allows  
us to let someone else maintain the interface to MySQL :)

This looks like it needs a MappedType definition for QSet<QString> in  
qgsvectorlayer.sip, similar to that for QSet<int> in  
qgsvectordataprovider.sip.

The latest commit (r7064) does not fix the issue.

Hi all,

Sorry, my fault. I didn't realize that I changed the public interface when 
doing r7063. I'm going to commit a change soon  that uses the same interface 
for QgsVectorLayer as before r7063. Because developers are no longer allowed 
to change the interface without making RFCs. In the case of r7063, the bugfix 
can be done without changing the interface.

Hi David

Excellent stuff, Do you think you will be able to port your work to
trunk? I can aply your patch to 0.8.x branch but at this stage I am
unsure if there will be a 0.8.2 release or if we will proceed directly
to the release of 0.9.0 - so it would be a great addition to the trunk
of QGIS.

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <d368056f0707070619y22539c39vd2345d4513f1dd62@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

QGIS 0.8.1 is released and with it my first stint in my new role as
Release Manager. I would like to say a very big 'thank you' to all the
people who helped squash bugs, submit patches, convert the build
system in 0.8 branch to cmake, update the msys environment and so on.
Since it was my first time orchestrating a release, there were a few
kinks in the process which hopefully will not be repeated in the next
release.

At this point we can continue with another maintenance release
(0.8.2), or move straight on to QGIS 0.9 which will put the eagerly
awaited python language bindings into the general public domain. I'm
in favour of focussing all our efforts on 0.9 now and having something
ready for the upcoming FOSS4GEO conference in Canada.

I am going to be out of contact for the next week, and when I return I
would like to start things rolling towards the release of 0.9. Its a
short schedule I propose so I'm putting this email out there now
before I leave to get you all thinking about the  release. I believe
we are pretty much feature complete for 0.9 and I'm suggesting the
following time line:

- Complete feature freeze as of Monday 16 July 2007 - only bug fixes
after this point
- UI String freeze as of 30 July 2007 - call for translators
- 13 August - preview 1 release and call for packagers to make test packages
- 26 August - release of 0.9

The FOSS4GEO conference is from 24 - 27 September so we will have a
month more or less after 0.9 to possibly to do a short, sharp 0.9.1
maintenance release if any issues are found.

- Does my timeline seem do-able?
- Are there any major objections to moving straight on to 0.9?
- Are the translators / devs / document writers / packagers able to
meet such a deadline?
- Is everyone happy with calling this release Ganymede (as suggested
on IRC by Tisham I think)?
- Can we remove all of the auto* stuff from SVN so mandating that
packagers do their stuff with cmake?


QGIS 0.9 is going to be a fantastic release and I'm really looking
forward to seeing this happen.

Best regards

David,

Great work!
I'm going to try your solution soon.
I have a two comments:

1. There is VC++ solution and project file in GDAL repository:
makegdal80.sln/makegdal80.vcproj, so you can build GDAL from
VC++ directly but using original makefiles.

http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/

2. Some time ago, I uploaded my project files for GEOS to its
repository, and I keep it updated there. This solution/project
can be downloaded from this location:

http://svn.refractions.net/geos/trunk/build/


Cheers

I'm also in favour for moving straight on to 0.9. Because we just don't have 
the ressources to do bugfixing for two versions. Backporting bugfixes can be 
quite time consuming.

One point to consider is the holiday season. I will be away from mid July to 
mid August and I suppose other developers will be in vacation too. 
Nevertheless, your schedule seems good to me and I think we should release 
0.9 in time, even if there are a number of bugs left.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <468F9F7F.1000007@lancaster.ac.uk>

Tim mentioning translation in his 0.9 message just now made me think of 
the translation engine in launchpad.net. So I looked, and qgis is 
registered: https://launchpad.net/qgis - but it seems that no use is 
being made of the launchpad bug tracker, 'blueprint' (RFC?), code 
repository, translation system or any of the other features.

I guess Tim either registered on launchpad to grab the URL for qgis just 
for presence's sake, but has there ever been the intent to shift 
development to the site?

I appreciate it would be quite a task though...

I actually started all this on the trunk a couple of months ago so I have  
a partially complete bunch of changes. I think I have the core QGIS app  
building but no plugins yet. It'll probably take the addition of some  
_decl_spec(dll_export/import) statements to various classes to get the  
plugins to build. Not sure how much changed between 0.8 and trunk but I  
suspect that all the same classes will need changing, I just need to find  
where they moved to...
I'm off on holiday this week so can't do anything with it but I can get  
back to it next weekend. I've just seen the mail on the release schedule  
for 0.9. I think I should probably manage to get this done during the week  
of the 16th. I guess this sort of work doesn't count as a 'feature'.

David

Thanks for that, I'll give both of those a shot. I'm slightly worried that  
I may be deviating somewhat from the msys and Linux worlds with my setup  
so hopefully this will help.

I also agree moving to 0.9 is better, as we do not have enough manpower
to maintain two versions in parallel.
I think a feature freeze should be done as soon as possible, and we
should concentrate on bugfixing. QGIS is getting the reputation of a
buggy and unstable sw, so we should address this first. I think printing
and crashing issues are the most serious ones.
All the best.

I think SVG is no longer a priority for w3c; possibly this is the reason
why Qt dropped it?
I think it is preferable not having a half-working, possibly
unmaintainable, feature.

Great! Is it possible for you to provide a patch before feature freeze for 0.9 
(Monday 16 July)?

Qt-4.3.0 provides support for SVG export with QSvgGenerator. It's a subclass 
of QPaintDevice, so straightforward to use. And according to trolltech, this 
export should be much better now (but I did not test it). 

I'm in favour of keeping the current SVG export with Q3Picture and warning (if 
this is still possible with the ported print composer). People may already 
use that feature and, regarding the developments in Qt4.3, I don't think we 
need to drop that feature in the long run. When qgis moves to qt4.3 as 
minimum version, we may switch to QSvgGenerator and remove the warning.

cheers,
Marco

Looking forward to test it. I agree that having a better printing system

I'll try to post a patch Monday (mid-day eastern time - GMT -5), if that's
OK.  If you need it sooner, let me know and I'll do what I can.  I assume
the patch should be for HEAD?

Yes, patch should be against HEAD.
Monday (mid-day eastern time - GMT -5) should be fine.

I have submitted my patch for porting the print composer to GraphicsView:
#740 <https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/740>  Although I haven't added much
in the way of features, this should fix some bugs related to using integer

Message-ID: <00d001c7c7cc$d3fa71d0$1b34d080@cseresearch.cs.washington.edu>

Hello all, if this is not the correct list to post this problem to, please
point me in the right direction.

I am trying to compile 0.9 on Windows XP with python bindings.  I am getting
pretty far, but have a blocker of a problem at the moment.  When running
'make' it gets to this point and stops:

[ 66%] Generating qt_sv.qm
Updating 'C:/workspace/qgis/build/i18n/qt_sv.qm'...
    Generated 701 translations (701 finished and 0 unfinished)
[ 66%] Generating qt_zh_CN.qm

    Generated 525 translations (446 finished and 79 unfinished)
    Ignored 187 untranslated source texts
[ 70%] Built target translations
[ 70%] Generating core/Makefile, gui/Makefile

Error: Unable to open "C:/workspace/qgis/python/core/core.sbf": [Errno 2] No

mingw32-make[2]: *** [python/core/Makefile] Error 1
mingw32-make[1]: *** [python/CMakeFiles/python.dir/all] Error 2
mingw32-make: *** [all] Error 2


I do have a QtCoremod.sip file on my machine, but not in the 'build'
directory.  I have placed it in several places and run this again, but it
never finds it and stops at this point.

Does anyone have any pointers on how to get past this?  We are considering
building a standalone python application using QGIS functionality combined
with our own, and would love to start messing with this.

Thanks in advance

Hi Tim.
In preparing the next package, please remeber to use "QuantumGIS"
instead of "Quantum GIS" as an installation path for Win, otherwise some
of the GRASS commands will not work.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <469CE6F0.3080006@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
We did some testing of the printing upgrades. Here a few problems:
- *very* slow in rendering
- points ere not shown correctly in the legend (*much* larger than on
the map)
- default font and size does not seem appropriate (both are first of the
list)
- images (logos etc.) are much larger in the pdf than in the png (and on
the screen).
We think setting default symbol size at 1 instead of 0.5 would be more
appropriate.
Hope this helps.

Hi

In this case people will need to uninstall the old version of qgis
otherwise they will land up with two copies. At the moment (for 0.8.1)
I added a note in the installer indicating that for grass you should
install to a path with no spaces....is this not enough?

Regards

Tim

If I have a utm NAD83 project with a utm NAD27 vector, when I edit  
the vector, the vector edit tools are offset by the difference in the  
two projections. In other words, the point that you click on a base  
map with the tool is not where the vector vertex is placed. This  
makes precise edits very tricky. Is this a bug or a feature? This  
happens in 0.8.1 and 0.9-trunk.

Thanks for your testing!

I haven't noticed any significant changes in rendering speed.  What are you
rendering that is so slow?

What font and size is the composer using on your computer?  On my computer,
the default font is fine (although it still has some nasty Qt rendering
problems).

The images were not being scaled correctly when rendered to postscript.
This is also a problem in 0.8.1, but I think I've fixed it now.

The symbol scale problems are a little messier, but I'll see if I can fix
them in the next few days.

Sometimes a base map is moved on my computer. This causes qgis to  
prompt me to look for the file to correct the missing link in the xml  
file. Unfortunately, qgis does not provide me any information  
regarding what file I should be looking for. It would be useful if  
the name of the layer in the xml file could be shown to the user so  
they have an idea of what to look for.

Message-ID: <d368056f0707181739r5da03efcq6ae1a8ae18c74e3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

1) Can I get a quick straw poll for the question: Can we delete all
the automake stuff from svn for this release?


Respond with +1, 0  or -1 as per normal.

2) I have the checklist for the 0.9.0 release up at

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9

I'm looking for volunteers to help with the release process. If you
are able to help sifting through bugs in trac, dealing with patches,
creating packages, please contact me. You dont need to be a coding
guru to help, you just need to be prepared to donate a few hours each
week to help.

3) I'd like to create a first review release 26 July 2007. It would be
great to get any in progress bug fixes etc you have into svn by then.
Also I will be setting all open bugs against 0.9 milestone. If you are
a non developer you can make a valuable contribution to QGIS by trying
out the preview and filing bugs as you encounter them.

4) I'd like to get the package build process documented for all
platforms / distros. If you are a package builder and are able to
spend a little time documenting what you do, it would be most
appreciated.

Thanks in advance to all those contributing their valuable time
towards getting 0.9 released.

Best regards,

Hi John,

In version 0.9, the edits are transformed automatically back from map 
coordinates to layer coordinates if reprojection is turned on. In 0.8.1, this 
is not the case. 
If the reprojection back to layer cs in 0.9 does not work for you, it is a bug 
and it would be good if you could provide more details. Which editing 
operations did you do and on which data source? Do you have sample data where 
I can reproduce the problem? 
I tried it here with a CH1903 layer reprojected to WGS84 and the edits I did 
seem to be transformed back to CH1903 properly. 

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-user] Preview builds for 0.9

Dear all

1) Can I get a quick straw poll for the question: Can we delete all
the automake stuff from svn for this release?


Respond with +1, 0  or -1 as per normal.

2) I have the checklist for the 0.9.0 release up at

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9

I'm looking for volunteers to help with the release process. If you
are able to help sifting through bugs in trac, dealing with patches,
creating packages, please contact me. You dont need to be a coding
guru to help, you just need to be prepared to donate a few hours each
week to help.

3) I'd like to create a first review release 26 July 2007. It would be
great to get any in progress bug fixes etc you have into svn by then.
Also I will be setting all open bugs against 0.9 milestone. If you are
a non developer you can make a valuable contribution to QGIS by trying
out the preview and filing bugs as you encounter them.

4) I'd like to get the package build process documented for all
platforms / distros. If you are a package builder and are able to
spend a little time documenting what you do, it would be most
appreciated.

Thanks in advance to all those contributing their valuable time
towards getting 0.9 released.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <op.tvqgtdbwvq3qvo@pezzy.belkin>

I've now got trunk building with VC++ 2005 Express. The main app and all  
the plugins bar GRASS are building correctly. I've not tried Python  
support yet either. Annoyingly the debug build crashes immediately on  
startup during the c runtime initialisation. The release build launches  
correctly. I've not tried adding any layers yet or any of the plugins. I  
just need to tweak my changes a bit and then I'll post a patch here.  
Hopefully this will be useful, perhaps to get some more Windows folks  
trying 0.9...

I assume you mean all the dlls, libs and headers. Would it be worth  
including Qt in that? The documentation on building that with Visual  
Studio is pretty clear. I'll have a look at trying this bundle, not sure  
how long it'll take. I need to have a try at building gdal and geos with  
some suggestions from Mateusz that should result in something more easily  
bundled than my current hacked together environment.

Anyway, I'll post a patch that should allow those willing to work out  
building the dependencies for themselves to build this with VC++. I'll  
then look at the dependencies bundle. I'm guessing there could be problems  
with simply using the FWTools bundle as I assume it was built with msys.

Hi David

Yes I meant the dlls, libs and headers.
My view is that if we can make it zero effort for people to develop  
with  QGIS then so much the better - so having Qt etc in the deps  
bundle makes a lot of sense to me.

I havent tried using FWTools for win dev so Im not sure whether they  
are build with VC++ or mingw.

Best regards

Tim

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Dear people assisting with 0.9 release preparation trac management  
(in particular D?ster and Aaron)

Some housekeeping notes for the bug queue:

- - if you would like to help with the bug queue management leading up  
to the release of 0.9 please contact me so I can add you to the  
release checklist: http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9
- - if your name is not on the above list please do not make any batch  
updates to the trac queue without first coordinating with me
- - I have reassigned all issues for milestone 0.8.2 over to milestone 0.9
- - We currently have 118 open issues in the 0.9 queue.
- - This list will likely grow once we get the preview out and its in  
wider testing
- - As a first order of business I would like to evaluate the priority  
of all bugs according to the following scheme:

blocker - bugs that should block the release. Since we are going to  
release pretty much 'come what may' I would like no bugs allocated to  
this category without consultation with me and / or PSC
critical - bugs that cause the application to crash or corrupt data
major - application features that do not function
minor -  features that function but imerfectly e.g. labels placing  
incorrectly
trivial - gui useability issues or small issues with the  
documentation, install notes etc.

- - I'm still looking for more people to help testing / fixing bugs  
etc. You dont need to be a programmer - it would be great to have  
people trying to replicate each bug when the release preview comes  
out and check it its still valid. Just post your observations to each  
bug. Also if you can help with writing install / build notes for your  
os / distro (FreeBSD / Fedora etc) into install.t2t your patches will  
be gratefully accepted.
- - We are still looking for people to volunteer to package QGIS -  
otherwise it will be a source only release (ok with win and mac  
binaries probably) and we will leave packaging up to the general  
populus with possible duplication of effort etc. If you are able to  
make packages please let me know.

Many thanks!

Hi All,

Tim has assigned me as the 0.9 win champion. I would like to know  
which features people would like most in the release as relates to:

grass - which version , 6.3 ?
gdal/ogr - which supported raster and vector formats , a lot of  
gdal/ogr formats require additional dependencies e.g GML requires  
xerces and ECW support does not compile under MSYS/MINGW( I am slowly  
patching to make it work anyone who absolutely needs ECW better help  
me :) )

Anything else about the win package please let me know.

Regards,

Tisham(aka what_nick)

Hi

Just briefly tested print composer in 0.9 after Steven's fixes, in
regard to what issues were problematic IMO. Read more below.

> Maciej Sieczka wrote:

> 1. in the map composer, line widths in the legend and in the map happen
> to not correspond to each other

Fixed! In the output PDF line widths in the legend and on the map
correspond perfectly. This is a very important fix. Thanks a lot!

However, either in "cache" or "render" mode in the *map composer* line
widths on the legend and on the map *do not correspond*. On the legend
it's always thicker.

> 2. labels placement and size in the map canvas not always corresponds
> to that in the map composer and printout

Still valid. See the following attachments:

labels_mapview.png
labels_composer.png
labels_pdf.png

They show how the labelled points look in the QGIS map view, map
composer and in the output pdf, respectively. Each looks much
different. Could it be at least fixed so that the view in the map
composer and the resulting pdf looked similar?

> 3. vector point symbols get rasterized in the printout

Still an issue. Is it fixable?

> 4. irregular letter spacing in the printout

Still the case. See the attachment spacing_pdf.png. Moreover, layer's
name is to close to categories' names below, overlapping it a bit.

Also, in the composer *the very same legend* before printing to pdf
looks completely different (font_composer.png) and rather corrupted.
Can this avoided? What's strange, if I zoom in in the map composer once
or twice, the legend's font starts looking same as in target pdf, hmm.
The same problem applies to scalebar.

Another, smallish, issue which remains is that the default font size
for legend "6" is always too small too be any readable. I guess
defaulting to at least 8 is a better idea.

Cheers
Maciek

I think GRASS 6.3 is the version that's most usable under native Win32.
In principle, it's stable and has some nice additional functionality
compared to 6.2.2. The only issue remaining is the random freezes on
attribute table access. This makes GRASS vector processing unreliable
currently. I have been trying to fix this lately but not been
successful. See this trac ticket for details:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/738

Regards,

Benjamin

Hi Bejamin.
We do not use windows, but many of our customers do.

+1 (much better, especially for the much improved grass toolbox)

the latest GDAL should be the best.
ECW support is one of the most requested features. The licencing
structure is uncertain, but it it is at all possible this would be a
major improvement.

It would be useful to kind of automate the process, in order to have a
fresh win snapshot to test even before the final release.

Thanks a lot.

moreover, point size is much larger (1.4x? 2x?) in the legend than in
the map, and larger in the pdf.

Moreover, row spacing in the legend appears often irregular, not
especially pleasant.

agreed. also, default font (sans-serif?) does not appear optimal on many
machines.

The slowdown which we noticed appears when working in ssh-X, when images
are added to the layout (just too much network traffic?).

Thanks a lot.

Hi

Many thanks to Tisham for being pressganged....ahem *volunteering* to
maintain windows binary of QGIS...

Regarding ECW to me is seems the best way to go forward on that is to
provide support via an additional download that can install ecw bits
and bobs into an existing QGIS install. Since this package could be
completely independent of QGIS, just having gdal bits and bobs, I
believe it would keep QGIS project immune from any potential license
infringement....but Im not a lawyer so other people may have a better
assessment of this idea....

In general it would be great to have as many gdal supported formats as
possible - bearing in mind issues like:

https://svn.qgis.org/trac/ticket/182

Regards


Tim

We will be tagging the initial preview this week (to let the bug

Note that OSX is another mostly unsupported platform for ECW,  
unfortunately.  I have not been able to get it working in GDAL (tho  
the shareware GraphicConverter got it working, possibly using  
different ECW functions, maybe a C vs C++ thing).  Messages in the  
ECW forums and to ER/Leica support have got me nowhere.

ER only officially supports OSX 10.3.9 + GCC 3.3, though I couldn't  
even get that working as a test, and certainly not Intel OSX.

I'm not a C++ programmer, so I can't do much on my own to work this  
out, but when it finally works, I'll definitely have a plugin for OSX  
GDAL (no need to mess with Qgis).

Marco,

I was using base NAD 83 clipped 24k topos from http:// 
keck.library.unr.edu. The base map for this test shapefile is Gold  
Point SW. The shapefile, in nad27, is attached. I made the shapefile  
in 0.8.1, then opened the project in 0.9 to test some more. Of  
course, the bug persists where none of my layers show in 0.9 without  
turning them on and off, but that is another issue.

You are correct that it is handling well in 0.9. I do not have the  
unusual offset, but I do get white boxes drawing over the underlying  
topo when I try to do moves. The question now becomes which of those  
is harder to deal with, but I thank you for the response. I hope this  
helps.

Cheers,
John Tull

Hi,

there seems to be a bug in the georeferencer plugin. In a project that

georeference an image, I get a wrong result. This bug seems to have been

Hi all,
Thanks once again for your testing.

This is a known problem for cache mode, since the cache is created at a
variable resolution and then variably scaled.  In render mode, the line
widths appear to correspond.  I'll try to look into it more when I get a
chance (unfortunately, that may be a few weeks).

I changed the line for the polygon outline to be a "cosmetic pen" (1px wide,
regardless of scale) when the line widths were getting out of hand.  Since
that should be fixed now, I can probably put the original line widths back.

I haven't done much testing with vector labels, so I'm not too surprised
some bugs still lurk there.  If you could send me some simple projects which
reproduce the problem, that would be great help.

Unfortunately, I don't think we can fix this for 0.9.  It will require some
significant changes to the symbology and rendering, which has the potential
to break things.

moreover, point size is much larger (1.4x? 2x?) in the legend than in

The ugly font bug strikes again!  What operating system and Qt version are
you using?  I have exactly the same problem, and I don't think there's much
we can do.  (I'm running Ubuntu with Qt 4.2/4.3)

I'm pretty sure Qt provides the default font, so we'd have to manually
override this.  I'll see if we can do this in a simple, cross-platform way.
The font size is calculated based off of the map scale, and often is less
than 6.  Perhaps some code to limit the default to a minimum of 8 would be
helpful.

I'm not going to have much time to work on QGIS in the next few weeks, but
I'll try to fix what I can for 0.9.

Message-ID: <31f1d37d0707241408i2b6c5e93n7c03f3346fde564c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to alls!

I've installed qgis svn under Mac OS X 10.4 and I've tried to use the
tutorial by Martin Dobias.


I can view the evry raster images but if I try to load a vector layer
I recive tis message:

Failed to load

I think the problem is in this point of my code,

    layerPath =  "/Users/heywood/Desktop/shape_dir/shapefile.shp"
    layerName = "shapefile"
    layerProvider = "ogr"
    # create layer
    layer = QgsVectorLayer(layerPath, layerName, layerProvider)

    if not layer.isValid():
      return



but I don't understand where is the mystake and beacause the layer
isn't valid. The problm can be the path, the layer name or the
provider?

thanks a lot

correctly; I mean it wasn't correct distance value on map. I have tested
that issue on both on SVN Trunk (head) and Release-0_8_1 branch. By the way
I have old version of QGIS compiled by myself I didn't remember that
version's revision. This old compiled version is working well for distance
measuring and area measuring. 

Please, can you check that issues.

Best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

Dear Tim and all,

Can you help to me for working 3D visualization on QGIS using NVIZ? When I
select "nviz - Open 3D View in NVIZ" from Grass tool box then it is alert to
me "Module nviz not found"...

I want to working 3D visualization using DEM file. QGIS is correct choice
for that? Or should I use pure GRASS without QGIS bindings? If yes where is
the good paper which is cover that issues?

P.S Actually I want to store attribute data in integrated DB (PostgreSQL)
then show 3D visualization then illustrate related attribute data when a
user will click my custom point layer.

Best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

Hi Paolo

I would also like this - automated nightly builds and unit tests. At
the moment we are moving in that direction but we are missing one
ingredient - build servers. I know there are some free services that
do this but I havent had chance to pursue this. Perhaps we can form
another little subgroup to look at this if there are some volunteers
willing to help...

Message-ID: <DC985B2E-201D-4FE1-B797-F8D5B6F26378@kyngchaos.com>

Someone finally responded to the ECW Forums with a small patch that  
enables the ECW SDK to read ECW images on OSX 10.4.  I still get  
errors trying to write ECW images, but it's a start.  Reading and  
writing JP2s with the ECW SDK works.

I built a plugin for my GDAL framework and it's available for  
download on my frameworks page.

If anyone wants to build the ECW SDK on OSX on their own, this forum  
topic summarizes past patches from other topics and includes details  
on the latest patch:

http://forums.ermapper.com/viewtopic.php?t=2446

If any Mac programmers (I'm not much of a C++ programmer, I just  
tinker) have any ideas on the write problem, please help out by  
posting to the ER forum in that topic.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to refresh the legend from a plugin
Message-ID: <20070726204639.GA11059@norbit.de>

Hi there,

I'm looking for a way to refresh the legend from a plugin.  I didn't
find a way to get to the legend from a plugin.

My plugin adds values to unique value renderers, the features render as
expected, but the legend isn't updated.


J?rgen

PS: I also noticed that some functionality could be moved from gui/app
classes to core classes to be more useful to plugins. E.g. what
QgsUniqueValueDialog::changeClassificationAttribute() does could be
moved to QgsUniqueValueRenderer.  Would patched that do things like that
be welcome?

I think this can be done.
I'm going to ask to our it community.
Perhaps it would be useful to have a minumim set of requirements.

On the web site of the IT GFOSS community we have a set of symbols for

It would be good to include in the standard QGIS and GRASS distribution,

  I think during my experimental period I found a way to do this, but it 
involved traversing the Qt widget tree until I found the legend widget 
and then hooking up some signals. It would have been very fragile to any 
change in the Qgis application design!

Hi Alessandro Sarretta

My apologies for not answering this - I unfortunately never noticed
the message. Tisham are you able to provide some assistance here? I
believe Alessandro is also interested to help with the win build work
so maybe we can form a little win-team that you can manage?

What can be the requirements for a build server?

I can manage to have a virtual server, Debian Lenny on Xen.
Availability is not 99.999, and CPU power is about Intel 3 GHz.

Hi

I had a look at this this morning and I think it will need an addition
to the plugin interface to allow connecting to the legend refresh
slot. Post 0.9 would be a good time for such a change...

J?rgen regarding your proposed patch in general yes such patches are
welcome. The criteria for something going into core is that it has no
gui dependencies (e.g. so the code can be used from QGIS console only
based applications.). Please mark such patches for Marcos attention.

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 0.9.0 Preview 1
Message-ID: <d368056f0707270950g63c5c0bat3686dc78340898ac@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Today I've tagged 0.9.0 Preview 1 as per our release plan at

http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/ReleaseChecklist0.9

You can check out a copy doing:

svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/tags/Preview-0.9.0-1 qgis0.9.0Preview1

This should bring into effect the following things:

 - string freeze for UI - if you are a developer please dont change
any more UI elements or translatable strings
- call for translators to update ts files
- call for document managers to update docs based on new features in SVN
- call for packagers to create preview binaries

A source bundle for preview 1 will be made available soon.

Now is the time we call on your help to produce translations, update
documentation etc. You dont need to be a programmer to be of
assistance - all you need to do is be willing to donate some time and
have a computer.

Note that automake and qmake build systems are completely removed and
using cmake is the only way to build QGIS 0.9.0 preview 1. Please see
the INSTALL document in the source tree for detailed notes for your
platform. http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/BuildingFromSource Also
contains updated build notes for all platforms.

Many thanks for all who are pitching in to make this release happen.

Best regards

Hi, 

to enable python bindings for debian I have following problems:

-- SIP is required in version 4.5 or later!
-- PyQt4 is needed in version 4.1 or later!

debian stable and testing includes PyQt4 4.0.1-5 and SIP 4.4.5-4. Wouldn't that
be sufficient? 

regards,
 Otto

Hi

Ah can you add that to INSTALL.t2t? We'll have to include notes for
that in preview 2.

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building 0.9 with MS Visual Studio (Express and
	otherwise)
Message-ID: <op.tv6hkysbvq3qvo@pezzy.belkin>

I've finally got a patch together that tweaks the code to allow it to be  
built with MS Visual Studio. Most of the changes account for minor  
syntactical oddities. The patch also includes some additions to  
INSTALL.t2t.

My current setup that was used to generate the patch contains most plugins  
bar the GRASS one. I still have issues with the python bindings so that's  
not been tried yet either.

So far I've tried the debug version (which somehow seems more useful at  
the moment...) and it loads the sample data from the QGIS website without  
problems. It also loads WMS data.

As requested by Tim, I'll start working on a Windows installer for the  
various dependencies that should make the whole build process a lot easier.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
David Willis

Hi all,

I have the final windows build ready. binaries and python bindings.
As mentioned the pyqt build on windows requires a bit of hacking of  
the qmake.conf file to add an extra define which PyQt assumes is  
present but is absent in Qt4.3.

The binaries are avialable as zip here:

The Python bindings will require an extra step of installing PyQt if  
not present. This can be quite tricky given the above patching of  
qmake needs to applied. Any suggestions are appreciated. Here is a  
summary of improvements needed in the installer, someone with  
experience in NSIS can help me out.


1) Python Install-Download Python, Locate Python location
2) Grass deps
3) Qt deps
4) Gdal Deps
5) Install location
6) Detection of old install and auto uninstall
7) Install stats with user registration
8) No redownload of sample data

Message-ID: <BAY110-W150906B20006A9783CCE9B2ED0@phx.gbl>

Hi:
 
I tried to browse http://qgis.org/uploadfiles to download the new msys
but I get an error 403 forbidden.
 
Also the msys url (http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.gz) mentioned in 
INSTALL file return a not found error.
 
It will exist a msys.tar.gz? or INSTALL should point http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.zip
instead of http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/msys/msys.tar.gz?
 
Regards
Godofredo Contreras

The attached patch does what I need, but obviously I don't know enough
about signals&slots yet.

And I'm not sure if the sip part does more than making it compile again
;)

Comments?

You are correct. The reason why I thought that the line width on the
the lengend and on the map don't correspond in render mode for me
either, is that I have just found out that one has to turn on the
render mode *separately* for the legend and the map. I didn't know that
before. So my fault. However, IMO it's questionable if switching
between the render and cache mode should be print-composer-wise, or
sperate for the legend and the map as it is currently. What do you think?

No problem at all. I'm glad you might be interested in looking into it.

I think that it would be consistent this way. If one really wants 1px
wide border for his polygons on the printout, he can set the border
width to 0 in the project.

Please find the points shapefile attached. It's from the free
"Spearfish" GRASS dataset (BTW, the new "Save as shapefile" worked
great for the original GRASS vector layer!). Display labels from field
'str1' and try to print.

I'm not sending you the project with labels set on, as it shows there's
a bug that once you set labels on, save the project and reload it, the
labels are not displayed anymore and I can't find a way to make them to
- besides starting the project from scratch again.

Really too bad. This is quite an issue.

Ubuntu Dapper, QT 4.3 built from source (qconfig.pri attached in case

Understood. Many thanks for getting the print composer rolling again
and good luck.

Message-ID: <005e01c7d228$702f47a0$6401a8c0@sharp>

Hi all

 

I just downloaded the Windows binaries, thanks for this.  It runs no
problem, but, when I try to do this in a regular python script:

 

from qgis.core import *

 

I get an import error, the specified module cannot be found.

 

My QGIS installation is at d:\qgis0.9preview1\

 

I have placed d:\qgis0.9preview1\python into both the PATH and PYTHONPATH
environment variables, but I still get this error.  I know this is a simple
issue, but I am unsure of what path to place where.  Could anyone shed some
light on this?

 

Thanks in advance!

Hi again,

some time ago I mentioned this bug in QGIS versions 0.8.1 and 0.8.0, 
which seems to have been fixed in 0.9. I could not yet report this to 
TRAC as I do not have an account yet:

As there was no reply, I try again. Is this the right place for this, 
developers?

Is anybody aware of this bug having been fixed, so that a patch for 
0.8.1 could be supplied? We use QGIS 0.8.1 on a liveLinux-CD based on 
KNOPPIX, so a patch for 0.8.1 would be great. Limited funding is available.

Thanks for any comments and feedback.

Hi J?rgen and Tim,

Thak you for the patch. It is good and I will apply it after 0.9 release. 
Please remind me after 0.9 so that I don't forget.

One small correction to the patch: the forward declaration of QgsLegend in 
qgisinterface.h is not necessary.


>PS: I also noticed that some functionality could be moved from gui/app
>classes to core classes to be more useful to plugins. E.g. what

The extension of the plugin interface (as done in your patch) is the way to 
go. Moving the content of 
QgsUniqueValueDialog::changeClassificationAttribute() to 
QgsUniqueValueRenderer is not possible, because the renderer classes (in core 
lib) are not allowed to have any dependencies on gui classes (e.g. legend).

Regards,
Marco

NVIZ is tcl/tk based. GRASS that comes wih QGIS will not have any
tcl/tk elements of regular GRASS. For this reason, propably NVIZ should
not be present in QGIS GRASS toolbox.

No.

Use NVIZ directly from regular GRASS instalation.

Do you mean manual? There's a detailed manual inside NVIZ (HELP menu).
You'll find links to NVIZ manual and tutorial also in the GRASS manual
page for NVIZ.

P.S.
Please don't hijack threads (start a new one for each new subject) and
consider asking on user list, unless your problem is really related to
development.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a new feature - in QGIS 0.8.1 and 0.9
one *has to* "Enable the fly projection" for measuring tools to return
expected values. Defining a projection for your project that suits the
projection of your dataset is not enough. Could a knowledgable QGIS
develepor explain?

Furthermore, I noticed a regression in 0.9 compared to 0.8.1 - you
can't set units to meters or feet when working in lat/lon projection
and to degrees for metric/feet system - through the interface that pops
up after clicking the camera icon in the bottom-right. QGIS will always
reset units to degrees for the former and to meters/feet in the latter
case. However, you can manage the units fine if you do the same
operation via Settings -> Project properies -> General. Strange.

Message-ID: <46ADE2A4.7080908@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
One question re: the north arrows: I see in
/usr/local/share/qgis/svg/north_arrows/
various symbols, not including the one used in the north arrow plugin,
which is in:
/usr/local/share/qgis/images/north_arrows/
However, if I copy another arrow in the second dir, it does not appear
in the plugin window.
It would be good if additional icons could be included, especially
because one of our GFOSS.it associates has prepared a wide variety of
arrows (50).
Would this be possible?
BTW: any plans to include also trees and geological symbols from our
selection?
I think this can be done also in frozen stage, as the potential for
introducing bugs is trivial.
All the best.

Hi All,

Here are my builds for windows:
I did them a few days ago against head ... currently I have the  
following issue when building:
C:\msys\src\qgis\src\core\qgsapplication.cpp:32: error: definition of  
static data member 'QgsApplication::mPrefixPath' of dllimport'd class.

The binaries as zip are here:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.zip
and and NSIS installer is here:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.0preview1.exe

Also for the attention of Godofredo is the current state of libecwj2  
which i have been slowly patching to compile in MSYS.
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/libecwj2-3.3.tar.gz
It involves patching headers to account for __GNUC__ and WIN32 defines  
both being set in mingw-msys, libecw code can't cope with that.

Please forward me the MSVC patch since I have a parallel build in MSVC  
for most of the QGIS dependencies.

Regards,

Tisham(aka what_nick)

No, I am not actually writing a script yet, just trying things out
interactively.  The problem is that Python cannot find qgis.core and
qgis.gui at all.

My QGIS installation is at d:\qgis0.9preview1

I have tried these 3 paths:

d:\qgis0.9preview1
d:\qgis0.9preview1\python
d:\qgis0.9preview1\python\qgis

In both the PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables.  Is one of these
paths or locations correct?

Thanks in advance

Hi Godofredo,

The ogr provider is mostly used for reading shapefiles and GML. Afaik those 
datasources have only one layer per file (which fits perfectly with the 
approach in qgis). 
Is it possible that oracle, mysql, postgresql in ogr have multiple layers per 
datasource? If yes, then we should think about how to handle that in QGIS. 
I'm in favour that the plugin asks the ogrprovider how many layers are 
present and the plugin then creates one Vectorlayer for each ogr layer.

Regards,
Marco

Hi there Jesse,

So, I am not a cmake guru but if I remember:

1) There is a variable in the ccmake setup that you can set called
"BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL" which puts the core.pyd and gui.pyd files in your
python site-packages directories... this is what I do so that there is not a
need to find the libraries with PYTHONPATH.  On my machine the site-packages
area with the correct files is at: C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\qgis.  Also
just make sure the the WITH_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON is set in cmake as well... just
to build the bindings at all!

2) The path PYTHONPATH needs to be able to find the core.pyd and gui.pyd
files and in my build install they are not there... so I can locate them in
the build area (not install area) at C:\dev\cpp\qgis\build\python.  I have
not tried to use them from their directly (as I have them installed in
site-packages), but that is a place to start.

Hope that helps!

No, I am not actually writing a script yet, just trying things out
interactively.  The problem is that Python cannot find qgis.core and
qgis.gui at all.

My QGIS installation is at d:\qgis0.9preview1

I have tried these 3 paths:

d:\qgis0.9preview1
d:\qgis0.9preview1\python
d:\qgis0.9preview1\python\qgis

In both the PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables.  Is one of these
paths or locations correct?

Thanks in advance

Hi Sebastian,

There will be no additional bugfix release for the 0.8.x series. So most of 
the bugfixes for 0.9 will not be backported to 0.8 any more.
But maybe there are any volounteers?

Regards,
Marco

I should have mentioned that I tried copying the \qgis folder into
\site-packages as well, to no avail.  

I did not compile 0.9 myself, I was using the compiled version provided by
Tisham in a post made on Sunday.  I just tried to download it again,
although both the NSIS installer and the zipped binary files appear to be
corrupt now.  I cannot install or unzip either file at this point.  Further
experimentation will probably have to wait until this evening when I get
home.

  Are you sure these are being set right? In python, do:

import sys
sys.path

and check. I've not read the docs for PYTHONPATH on windows, but I cant 
quite explain why:

C:\Documents and Settings\rowlings>set PYTHONPATH="c:\foo"

and then

C:\Documents and Settings\rowlings>c:\Python25\python
Python 2.5 (r25:51908, Sep 19 2006, 09:52:17) [MSC v.1310 32 bit 
(Intel)] on win 32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 >>> import sys
 >>> sys.path
['', 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\rowlings\\"c:\\foo"', ....

  What the? Its appended what I wanted to my windows' 'home' 
directory... I dont understand...

  You can modify sys.path from within python if Windows refuses to play 
sensibly :)

If you just use

set PYTHONPATH=c:\foo

You will not get the concatenation of the path with the current launch 
path (e.g. 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\rowlings\\"c:\\foo"' )

You'll need to add CORE_EXPORT to each public function in qgsapplication.h  
and remove it from the class declaration. Or have a look at the patch I  
posted on Saturday (Building 0.9 with MS Visual Studio (Express and  
otherwise)). Most of the stuff in the patch is #def'd to be MSVC specific  
but the change to qgsapplication.h is not.

Hi Bayamba Mendbayar

Currently NVIZ within QGIS is not suported as far as I know. We will  
be working to integrate OSSIM Planet for 3D (2.5D really I guess)  
support in QGIS, but I cant give you any specific timeline as to when  
this will be available.

Hi Paolo

If they are in SVG then it would be worth investigating for QGIS post  
0.9.0 release. The way to go would be to submit a patch. Note I tried  
before to add a large library of free svgs from freeclipart.org I  
think it was and experienced considerable slowdowns in the dialogs  
that display svgs for symbol selection, so if its a large archive you  
have we will need to consider using a file selection dialog rather to  
let the user choose their symbols...

Regards

Tim

Hi William

Excellent news! Will be great to have ecw support available for 0.9..

We still need to resolve in QGIS how to select the preferred driver  
for formats that are suported by more than 1 driver (like  
jpg2000)....something for further down the road I guess..

Hi Sebastian

At this stage we do not have the manpower to maintain both 0.8.1 and  
0.9 branches. Im hoping that we can get a sponsorship programme going  
to support a few full time developers where we can put more focus on  
enterprise users. At the moment however we need to get QGIS feature  
complete first and then stabilise that and get a 1.0 release out. 1.0  
will have long term stabilisation support with a stable api for  
application integrators to programme against.

For your particular issue it should be possible to get a patch made  
by one of the folks offering commercial services around QGIS - we  
have  a list on the QGIS home page of commercial support providers.

Regards

Tim

Hi

That would probably do the job fine. Would you be able to generate  
nightly debian package at the same time? Do you think you will be  
able to figure out how to get the packaging done using cmake by the  
way? It would be great if you could make some packages of 0.9preview1.

Regards

Tim

Hi, 

for testing QGIS 0.9.0 Preview 1 on opensuse 10.2 (32bit) packages can be
downloaded here.

Python Language Binding is not yet included in that package, because of

Marco, devs,

Anyone know who fixed that bug in the georeferencing plugin? There is 
funding available for backporting that fix to 0.8.1. We have a deadline 
in 3,5 weeks and qgis 0.9 will only be out after that. Additionally, we 
got this running in a KNOPPIX environment after all and we want to stick 
with 0.8.1 as it was some hassle getting that done in the first place.

Cheers.

Sebastian

Try searching the SVN commit archive to find out [1]. There's a
georeferencer related commit almost every month.

Thanks for the hint. Did that already. That bug fix is not mentioned 
explicitely anywhere...

In recent months only Tim Sutton, Martin Dobias and Marco Hugentobler 
seem to have been working on georef-plugin. Comments from you folks?

Could there be any other reason, QGIS 0.8.1 does not run fine and svn 
trunk does with respect to georef /helmert transformation other than a 
bug (fixed)....???

Cheers

Sebastian

My change to the georef plugin was a fix for the linear transformation that 
allowed the creation of different pixel size in x- and y- direction. It was 
not directly related to helmert transformation and it is in 0.8.1 and 0.9.

Maybe it is Tims or Martins changes that make the difference?

Regards,
Marco

Hi, 

When I display a GRASS vector map in current 0.9.0preview1 and switch to editing
modus the line and vertices aren't visible anymore, except for some parts of the
display with a background map. Looks as if white GRASS vectors are displayed on
a white background. 

Does anybody else has experiences with this problem and can I change the color
somehow?

Hello people,

The upload of the test zip and installer did not finish last night, I  
am redoing them. Please try in a few hours.

Sorry for the delay.Any suggestions about automating python and PyQt  
installs is welcome. I have been looking at:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsPython_plug-in

Should Qgis come with its own embedded distribution of Python and use  
that if a System Python is not detected ... suggestions and helps with  
NSIS this regard are welcome.

Hi you can find the free article here

http://geomatica.como.polimi.it/workbooks/n5/full.php

we didn't release code due to the fact that QGIS plugin and all processing
chain was deeply related with our DB architecture. Something too difficult
to generalise... too much not prevented work for us (we release only nviz
functions that where natively general... e.g flythrough)

conceptually...we modified a Radim Blazek (thanks thanks) qgis plugin to
create time/spatial queries on our DB. This is useful to prepare data
layers (project.qgs).
Then we developed tcl scripts to transform a qgis project in a nviz
show... where a nviz show is something that manage time series data (map
sequences)

wasn't so simple to realease this nviz component

so the chain was: prepare sequence with qgis Plugin->project qgis->prepare
data for nviz->nviz

I think should be more interesting to integrate applications that natively
manage time series (e.g paraview)

thanks to the community

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [PATCH] extend data defined labels
Message-ID: <20070731132729.GA30025@norbit.de>

Hi there,

the attached patch adds following features to data defined labels:
- data defined unit of size
- allow combinations in the alignment field instead of just "left",
  "right", "top" or "bottom" (eg. "bottom left")
- ignore size <= 0 which Qt would otherwise choke on

Hi J?rgen,

Thank you for your contribution! The patch is fine and I will apply it to svn 
after 0.9 release (which is planned for 26. August).

Best regards,
Marco

Hi all,

I have problems to update and checkout from svn. Is it just me or a general

Cool - looks like that fixed the websvn tarball problem (it's had a  
similar tmp dir not found error for a while).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] x86_64 support
Message-ID: <200707311321.06353.silfreed@silfreed.net>

I'm working on a bug for the packages I built for Fedora where the plugins 
aren't found for x86_64. 
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=247549)

I'm thinking this has to do with the fact that qgis is hard-coded to install 
to /usr/lib, where the default path for libraries on x86_64 is /usr/lib64.  
I've created a patch to install the libraries and plugins to this directory, 
but it appears that qgis is still looking in the wrong place somehow.

I don't have access to an x86_64 box so it's difficult for me to test.

Hi there Jesse,

Can you try to just hit this function from the command line like:

aaronr@z-linux2:~/work/$ python
Python 2.4.4c1 (#2, Oct 11 2006, 21:51:02)
[GCC 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> str(QgsApplication.prefixPath())
''
>>> QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr/local",True)
>>> str(QgsApplication.prefixPath())
'/usr/local'
>>>

This will let us know if things are at least working in theory and we can
track down why it is not working in your case.

Hmmm... strange.  I am not sure why your first statement that is wrapped
with a str() is returning a PyQt4.QtCore.QStringRef object... I don't see
that.  There seems to be some strangeness with strings in your python
install.  Can you show what version of qgis, python, pyqt, qt, and how you
installed them?  

I guess we just need to start at the beginning and peel away the onion until
we get to the reason...

This is a freshly formatted Windows XP install.  It has

Python 2.5.1
PyQt 4.3.0 (from here http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php)
QGIS 0.9.0 Preview 1 from here
(http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis0.9.0preview1.zip)

Installed in that order, and that's it!

Doesn't the msys build use the CORE_EXPORT macro? If so, the patch updates  
qgsapplication.h to individually export all the public functions  
(__declspec(dllexport)) rather than the whole class. The error you're  
getting seems to be something to do with trying to import static private  
members. This happens when qgsapplication.h is referenced from outside of  
qgis_core (CORE_EXPORT defined as __declspec(dllimport)) . This would  
appear to be a no no with msys' compiler as well as MSVC's.

David Willis

I don't have such problem. Probably you have changed the line color in
GRASS Edit. Go to symbology tab and check what line color is set.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] distance measure feature isn't
	working	correctly
In-Reply-To: <46ADBF5B.1030309@o2.pl>
Message-ID: <20070801020714.CE7371B66C@qgis.org>

Dear Maciek,

In the finally I got a correct result from distance measuring and area
measuring tools. But it does have to follow too complicated rules which are
following:

1. To activate the "Enable the fly projection" 
2. To select your preferred unit (degree/feet/meter) 

You have to firstly activate "Enable the fly projection", if you reverse
above order then you should be re-assign preferred unit again :-(

Also there have strange thing still there. My setting of unit is switched by
degree when I set my preferred unit (mostly meter). Is that bug or not?! 

In before (I mean 0.8.0 and 0.8.0 pre2) distance and area measuring tools
were working well without above extra rules!!! (I mean in before I haven't
set previously activate the "Enable the fly projection".)
It's better to end-user. Isn't it? 

In the end thanks a lot for your kind help and advice.

Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Byambaa Mendbayar

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a new feature - in QGIS 0.8.1 and 0.9
one *has to* "Enable the fly projection" for measuring tools to return
expected values. Defining a projection for your project that suits the
projection of your dataset is not enough. Could a knowledgable QGIS
develepor explain?

Furthermore, I noticed a regression in 0.9 compared to 0.8.1 - you
can't set units to meters or feet when working in lat/lon projection
and to degrees for metric/feet system - through the interface that pops
up after clicking the camera icon in the bottom-right. QGIS will always
reset units to degrees for the former and to meters/feet in the latter
case. However, you can manage the units fine if you do the same
operation via Settings -> Project properies -> General. Strange.
