Subject: [Qgis-developer] Layer comparision/suitability
Message-ID: <54041F8C.7040107@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've developed a plugin in which the user has the ability to create a 
new layer with some certain fields (say, for instance, color, size, 
shape) or use and existing one, in that case the fields can be added to 
the layer.

I have implemented a "brute force" comparision: I check in the existing 
layer for the existence of those fields and of the same type. You could 
see how in this gist:

https://gist.github.com/jtornero/fbc9928720da2de364f1

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work very well at all. I wonder if 
someone has faced this problem before or could suggest another approach.

Thank you very much.

All the best,

Jorge

I personally would like this very much. However, it is a matter of plugin authors
goodwill. Could you start finding a small group of plugins and try to convince their
authors of the beauty of unification?
All the best.

The plugin website has two underused features that could be beneficial
to put some plugins in stronger evidence:
"featured"  flag and "score" (the "stars" coming from the voting
system plug the number of downloads weighted with the age of the
plugin, if I remember correctly).

The purpose of those "stars" and the "featured" flag was also to ease
the choice among a group of similar plugins.

The problem is that nobody took the time and responsibility to test
and examine all old and new plugins and to flag them.
Any comment or proposal in order to make this classification better
would be welcome.

Comments on plugins would maybe also help, see what happens with the
two biggest plugins markeplaces I know:
http://extensions.joomla.org/
https://wordpress.org/plugins/
Comments are often very useful (when the author doesn't offer a
discount for every positive review).

Good luck :)

Sorry for being a bit OT but about the benefits/problems of
cooperation and forking and other anti-patterns [1] affecting and
empowering the FOSS ecosystem I strongly suggest this amazing video:

Ups, sorry... :)

Hi guys,
I have the nightly repos for my debian testing machine activated (deb
  http://qgis.org/debian-nightly jessie main) and I just update &
upgrade all the stuff.

Trying to start qgis it appears this error:

somebody knows how to fix it?

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8XGfm-zAQ0M5BhRk2PF320ExnsWO32SFMzvj82XsL20g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I would like to discuss the possibility of having a right click context
menu on the canvas.  I know there is a current feature of swapping to the
last used map tool but I feel this is a weak feature compared to what we
could have in a context menu. The one main point though is the context menu
should not expose anything that isn't already in the UI, it can be a
shortcut but it can't be context menu only.

Some current things I was thinking of are:

Last Tool
Second Last Tool
------------------------
Copy
Paste
-----------------------
Feature Info
-----------------------
etc
etc

We could also add things like snapping options if holding control.

Thoughts?  Will anything really miss the swap to last tool feature?  IMO
adding a context menu adds a lot of quick access options for us.

I will of course do a QEP about this.

That's a big +1 for me.


If it's not too early, I would add to the list:
Attribute and map layer actions
Derived info
maybe a paste here (would shift feature)

Will have to think about that. It's certainly nice to be able to switch  
between select and identify easily.

Message-ID: <EEB80DAA-CB0D-4699-825E-6098E69C2321@westnet.com.au>

Hi, 

I'm noticing that if I save a project with a GPX file that I opened with the GPX plugin, that layer is saved with an absolute path, regardless of the project setting.

I'm pretty sure previous versions did save as relative paths.

I'm seeing this behaviour in 2.4 on ubuntugis, mac and win7 and last nights dev on OSGeo4W. 

I'm happy to do up a bug repot, but I'm wondering if someone can confirm my hallucination first?

-ramon.

Hi Salas,

You can have a look here:
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html

You have basically three ways to customize your own GIS application.
 From the easier to the more complex:

* Create a QGIS plugin. These are in Python and you have a lot of 
examples [0]

* Create a standalone application in Python using QGIS lib.

* The same in C++

While looking at the first time, it seems interesting to go for a 
standalone app, you should really consider the idea of the plugin:

* All the basics are already there, no need to redesign a new app
* Easier to maintain, and your application will automatically benefit 
from the constant improvement of QGIS
* A lot of examples and code snippets
* Can profit to the whole community

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapRenderer and DPI problem
Message-ID: <96EAE7D042AAC14486D68EC70207B0C144157F5E@srsofaioi16255.verw.rootso.org>

Hi

I'm trying to save an image from QGIS master with python:

    img = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
    img.setDotsPerMeterX(dpi / 25.4 * 1000)
    img.setDotsPerMeterY(dpi / 25.4 * 1000)
    
    color = QColor(255,255,255)
    img.fill(color.rgb())
    p = QPainter()
    p.begin(img)
    p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
    render = QgsMapRenderer()
    render.setLabelingEngine(QgsPalLabeling())
    render.setLayerSet(lst)
    render.setExtent(rect)
    render.setOutputSize(img.size(), dpi)
    render.render(p)
    p.end()
    
    img.save("/tmp/"+filename+".png","png")


It seems that the dpi parameter in render.setOutputSize(img.size(), dpi) is not respected. For any value of dpi the line width is always the same in the output raster. It it respected when using map units for line widths and not milimeters, though. The script was used in an older QGIS version ages ago. So I'm pretty sure it worked once. Did I miss something or is it a bug?

Regards
Stefan

Hello Nathan,

thank you for the resurrection :)

I would just stick to RFC instead of QEP: I also like the acronym but
everybody (inside and outside our community) knows exactly what RFC
stands for while almost nobody knows about QEP.

Branding can be useful marketing stuff but I'd avoid it in this
context: we are talking about technical documents, and we have already
enough acronyms to keep in mind, don't we?

Anyway, I would like to write down some notes in a an QEP/RFC about
QGIS Mapserver Python Plugins and I would like to know if and how can
I start from a template: I gave a quick look to
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals but it appears to
be empty.

+1 !

We should avoid to overcrowd the menu though, and sub-menus are also
sub-optimal.

This means that if we want to have that many functions available in the
menu, we may think of making it customizable.

+1

While using the selection tool, a Next Feature (below) would be quite
usefull in overlaping or overcrowded data.

Very, very good idea !

I don't think it's too early for the attribute and map layer selection Denis.

I would expose it in the API so that "custom shortcuts" could be added at the end of the list.

That's a big +1 for me.


If it's not too early, I would add to the list:
Attribute and map layer actions
Derived info
maybe a paste here (would shift feature)

Hey all,

I know there is a current feature of swapping to the last used map tool but I feel this is a weak feature compared to what we could have in a context menu. The one main point though is the context menu should not expose anything that isn't already in the UI, it can be a shortcut but it can't be context menu only.

Some current things I was thinking of are:

Last Tool
Second Last Tool
------------------------
Copy
Paste
-----------------------
Feature Info
-----------------------
etc
etc

We could also add things like snapping options if holding control.

Thoughts?  Will anything really miss the swap to last tool feature?  IMO adding a context menu adds a lot of quick access options for us.

I will of course do a QEP about this.

One thing I am wondering about it how would that work with map tools
that handle right clicks... would the context menu open only for the
basic tools like pan / zoom?

In general I don't think people will miss right click to go back to
previous tool - especially if it will be replaced with something
stronger.

Cheers

I think that right click should be totally disabled for the rest of the 
app and only be used for the contextual menu.
It would avoid confusion and bad user experience.

Hi,

I need to start using the new QEP/RFC setup (today actually), specifically
for some sponsored work. I don't want the sponsor to think the QGIS project
is indecisive, so I propose a vote on the naming of the process, since
there is some disagreement.

QEP or RFC?

+0 for QEP (I'm fine with RFC, as well).

I think RFC is a bit dry, though universally understood. QEP should not
confuse the public, since the dev group actually interested in using them
is fairly small. QEP is clearly spelled out in the repo name. QEP shows a
renewed configuration over the older, existing RFC process.

Lastly, QEP pays homage to Python's PEP. I think QGIS would not be as
popular as it is today if it were not for Python integration.

+1 to QEP

Mainly because the name is clear. I didn't know what RFC was when I first
started so google sorted that out and it will for QEP for new users. If you
are going to write a QEP/RFC you are already involved so you will know what
it is, we will make it clear on the website. Its also nice and personal for
the project like PEP is for Python.

+1 for RFC because it's a "standard" and there's already enough acronyms 
around.

Following Alessandro's idea, I'd love to be able to attach
screenshots/video captures to the description.
A capture of the GUI is often much more informative about what to expect
than a longish description.

And about merging similar plugins, I don't know if we can achieve a global
policy. It's quite natural for plugins developers to work independently.

IMO, most important is that users and devs are aware of other similar
plugins. It would even be worth to have a "similar plugins" field, which
could be contributed to just like user comments. Once aware of other
similar plugins, the dev of the least advanced plugin will probably stop
working on his plugin, so that it will automatically get pruned from the
list with upcoming versions of qgis. In the meantime, the rating+comments
system allows the user to quickly know in what order to try the plugins.


Best regards,

Olivier

I also like the idea of having our own QEP..

RFC is for Network things
PEP for Python ..

So +1 for QEP

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug - Multiline text edition in attribute table ->
 delete field content !
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO51SXUmAV0BtvqV22Y+WtTpL0XW+91O6v2Ov+ZzQFqijQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

A user reported a bug during edition of an attribute table under QGIS2.4.

To reproduce :

* create a vector layer with one "text" field (for example "foo") and add
it in the current project
* open layer properties / Field tab, and check the "multiline" property of
the "Text edit" for the field "foo"
* create 2 features with some content in the "foo" field
* save layer session and deactivate edition
* open attribute table, activate edition, toggle to the Form view
* click on one of the line in the left panel -> the line label changes into
NULL
* click on another line in the left panel -> same behaviour.
* go back and select the first line -> the value in the "foo" field has bee
completely erased
* toggle edition off, save -> no more values in the "foo" field.

I have not been able to find a correponding issue in the hub. I created
this one :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11128

Please comment there.

Regards
Michael

+1 for QEP

we also do QUGS (QGIS User Groups), and as said: PEP is for python and
JSR for java etc. As we have a pretty distinguishable starting char,
let's use it :-)
But let democracy take place....

Message-ID: <CAAcYxUfesx4NitJ--TsMHRwbd4YFBRDdaS-CS9gELqj2d-T+TA@mail.gmail.com>

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/62548/can-i-use-qgis-with-qt5
The above link indicates that QGIS 2.x can't be built with Qt 5.x and I was
curious how much work would be involved in resolving that.

I ask because I'm using RHEL 6 which comes with Qt 4.6 and so I can't build
QGIS 2.x with that because it requires 4.7. Qt 5.x is available in the EPEL
so I was wondering what would be involved in making it so I could use that.
If it's not too big of an effort, then I could potentially help with the
work but I wanted to find out what it would involve before I dove into
anything.

Thanks,
Dave

Hi Dave,

I have ported large portions of the code to Qt5 (for Android). It has 
not been widely tested but runs quite stable here on Fedora (so not far 
from RHEL). However, due to missing pyqt packages I could not test 
python support (arriving in Fedora 21). If you want to give it a try, 
you can find the code here [1]

Good luck and let me know how it goes.

Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] in-memory layer as cache in DBManager
Message-ID: <0bd779b233b400226736ec02a7519739@medspx.homenet.org>

Hello devs,

during my work on DBManager Oracle implementation, I've been faced with 
large layers that take time to open (more than 10 seconds is quite a lot 
for the users in my office). It is even worse with dynamic queries 
because QGis considers that there is no spatial indexes available (which 
is true on most cases). In this situation, it takes the same amount of 
time to show a limited set of data and the whole set.

Other GIS tools (ArcGIS 10.x and MapInfo 10.x) provide a very basic 
cache feature. Once the layer (or query) content has been loaded in 
memory, every operation (scan/pan or geoprocessing) is really fast 
(about milliseconds compared to more than 10 seconds). There is no cache 
synchronisation mechanisms but it just works (from the user point of 
view).

I know that there has been discussions about implementing a cache 
mechanism in QGis but I see nothing in the code for the moment (perhaps 
am I wrong ?).

I think that for the moment, in-memory layers are the nearest approach 
for a cache system. They have been deployed long ago and I think that we 
can work with them to offer a very basic-but-easy-to-use cache 
mechanism.

I've played so far with Python code to make an in-memory layer from a 
(what I think is becoming a) big Oracle table (about 250000 objects). 
Performances are quite good: it takes about one second more to build the 
in-memory layer than retrieving the whole dataset (17 seconds). Data are 
transfered only once during the copy features operation, so the total 
amount of time of building the in-memory layer is the time of the query 
duration. Once the in-memory layer is loaded, you can pan and zoom at 
all levels in less than one second. The only drawback I've found so far 
is some freezing on attributes table. It takes about ten seconds to open 
the attributes table and scrolling in it is very slow. I've noticed that 
when you replace floats fields by integer ones, scrolling is a little 
bit faster.

 From the user point of view, in-memory layers are similar to a basic 
caching system:
- you grab all the data from the SRDBMS the first time you open the 
layer.
- Then you are able to do fast data analysis or rendering...
- knowing that if you want to work on true live data, you have to open 
the real layer (no synchronisation).

For the moment, the only practical way for a user to build an in-memory 
layer is by selecting all the features of a layer (which takes time as 
selection launches a refresh query), copy them into clipboard and clip 
them in an in-memory layer. Furthermore, this technique doesn't work 
with Date/Time attributes (the layer cannot be created).

You can build in-memory copies of a layer by using the Python console 
but this is not really user-friendly. I believe that a good entry point 
to load an in-memory layer is in DBManager, on the dbtree or in the SQL 
editor widget.

Why add this new functionnality there ? First, just because the Python 
implementation is easier to code and there will be no modification on 
the core code of QGis. Then it seems that the performances will be good. 
Furthermore, SQL queries made with the SQL dialog box of the plugin are 
good candidates to in-memory layers. Loading them as in-memory layers 
can be faster than building them and saving them in a local file (data 
are transfered only once from the SRDBMS server).

I'd like to know what do you think about this practical approach of 
caching ? Do you think it is a good idea to just add a button or a 
checkbox or a menu entry to load a layer or an SQL query as an in-memory 
layer ? Do you think DBManager is a good candidate for this user 
interface ?

Best regards,

PS: I know that the ideal situation would be a true cache mechanism 
directly on core code but (I think) it is far more complex to 
implement...

I think this approach is only useful for read only layers (and ones 
that can fit easily in available memory).

Martin Dobias was interested and available to work on a proper caching 
machanism - he just needs some funding. Personally I would rather hold 
out for a proper caching mechanism that synchronises writes on both 
client server and client side and perhaps has some smarts about what to 
cache.

How do you pronounce QEP? 'Q-eeepeee'?

+0 from me, I don't mind either RFC/QEP

I'd be glad to give it a try and help resolve any issues. What do I need to
do to build it? I tried running cmake and it is still looking for Qt4, so
how do I tell it to build with Qt5?
Thanks,
Dave

You are.  There is QgsOracleTableCache
(src/providers/oracle/qgsoracletablecache.{h,cpp}).

But as it's within the provider it not exposed to the API.

Great news Tom!  Do you have any plans to reinstate the metadata editor
that used to be part of metasearch's predecessor's? I think it is the next
gaping hole in our standards support.

How do you pronounce "RFC"  :-)

QEP?  "Kwep" could work.

Am I right that Metatools plugin does not works for you and you need
something else?
AFAIK it works fine under QGIS 2.x, so I don't understand why we need
another editor.

Moreover I'm slowly work on new improved version of this plugin. It is
not ready yet,
so I not announced it nor force to include in QGIS core.

Hi,
I was more in favor of RFC at the beginning, but QEP will ease search on 
search engine.

So +1 for QEP.

Agreed.

I get tracebacks like below when trying to use metatools:

Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "C:/Users/TomK/.qgis2/python/plugins\metatools\metatools.py", line 316, in doView

I'll be glad to help out Alex when the above is ready and out there.

Having said this, what about the Layer properties dialog's Metadata section? There
is almost enough there for a fulsome enough metadata record.  Adding
a CSW publishing client ('Publish Metadata') would be straightforward.

It's a regression, QGIS 2.2 works correctly.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SVG Export from print composer as raster?
Message-ID: <5407213E.3010000@carto.net>

Hi,

I noticed that SVG symbols (from point and pattern symbology) from print
composer are exported as raster when exported as part of the map and
from the legend item. However, SVG images from the image/photo item are
exported as vector. This in both SVG and PDF format.

Ideally, all could be output as vector.

Is there anything we can do about it that legend items and maps are all
output as vectors?

Thank you if you know anything about it.

Andreas

Hi,

do we have a template for an RFC/QEP to start with?

IMHO is much more important than the name we choose for it.

Great!

how should I start then?

Clone the repo and add a new file for my RFC then make a PR?

Thanks!!!

Yep that is the workflow.

All QEPs are done though a PR.

Hi Dave,

IIRC you only have to set the cmake option ENABLE_QT5=TRUE

a VRT is a Virtual Raster Table and applies to raster data not Vector data.
gdal deals with raster, and ogr with vector.

Do you want to rasterise some vector data and then store it in a tiled 
index (VRT), or do you want to know if there is an indexing mechanism 
similar to VRT, for Vector data?

HTH,
Zoltan

This decision is not either/or. We can have a codebase that compiles 
against both (at least for a transition time), my branch is totally 
targeted towards this solution. There is no particular reason I could 
think of to be in a rush to put preasure on distributions to change.

In the beginning Qt4 will be used as default setting and when enough 
water has gone down the Danube river we can change the default to Qt5.

This will let us have a transition time where distros can decide 
themselves what suits their needs better.
Right now there are two parts that I know will need some attention:

  * evis plugin uses an incompatible API (easy change)
  * python bindings need to be tested (maybe just work, maybe hard 
work... don't know)

I would like to merge this after 2.6 has been released so it will be 
possible to build 2.8 against Qt5. That will also allow us to have 
Android nightlies based on master again.

Matthias

Hi Tom,

if you allow me a user-question here:

>Having said this, what about the Layer properties dialog's Metadata section? There
>is almost enough there for a fulsome enough metadata record.  Adding
>a CSW publishing client ('Publish Metadata') would be straightforward.

Such a feature would be very much appreciated. Would you think of shipping a CSW server (e.g. pyCSW) with a QGIS installation / make that a dependency for a plugin or do you think of an interface to Metadata catlogue software like (from the group of OSGeo tools) GeoNetwork. The latter - which probably would be comparable with this solution in the proprietary world: https://www.geocat.net/bridge/ - would be nice, because it would a) improve interoperability between OSGeo projects, and b) help in central metadata management of an organisation (while the former is probably mor beneficial for smaler companies or single users which do not operate something like GeoNetwork)!
Otherwise, a way to get metadata from QGIS published (e.g. in GeoNetwork), would be XML-import...

Cheers
Stefan

VRT is not only for Raster .    You will find this article very interesting
:

http://www.portailsig.org/content/ogr-que-la-force-soit-avec-les-formats-virtuels


:)


So, Vector  VRT  are very powerful ,   and I repeat the question :   it
just exists a QGIS menu function or other to save  vector layer VRT
definition file ?


Thank you again for any info about this

You having said this, does clarify your question. - Nope, I am not aware 
of such facility in QGIS (but that doesn't say much).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QuickOSM as default plugin for OSM data
Message-ID: <540831D5.1010301@gmail.com>

Hi all,
recently I discovered the QuickOSM plugin. Thanks to the ease of all its
features I think it is worth to integrate as a native plugin.

I'm saying that especially because the difficulties to work with the
current OSM core plugin that involves to many steps in order to have
some data displayed in QGIS.

Furthermore, with this plugin it would be simpler to work with the
training manual: I mean that one can adapt the manual to a specific area
and data.

What do you think about it?

Cheers,

Matteo

Roberto,

You probably want to try
http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/swig/python/samples/ogr2vrt.py , which is
actually mentionned in the article you quote.
I don't think there's a QGIS launcher for that one, but a few characters on the
command line have not killed anybody ;-)

suerly not :)
however, it would be nice to add it, possibly to Processing toolbox. Roberto, could
you open a ticket about this?

I'd note that this script is not installed by default with GDAL. The "samples"
directory is aimed at more or less esoteric scripts. Some might go to official
if they seem to be popular enough.

Would you think of shipping a CSW server (e.g. pyCSW) with a QGIS installation / make that a dependency for a plugin or do you think of an interface to Metadata catlogue software like (from the group of OSGeo tools) GeoNetwork. The latter - which probably would be comparable with this solution in the proprietary world: https://www.geocat.net/bridge/ - would be nice, because it would a) improve interoperability between OSGeo projects, and b) help in central metadata management of an organisation (while the former is probably mor beneficial for smaler companies or single users which do not operate something like GeoNetwork)!

Optionally both.  The default could be loosely coupled using the CSW endpoint and all is done via CSW-T.  A user could manage/publish their metadata with a selected CSW of their choosing/configuration.

The other option would be to ship pycsw as the QGIS CSW server to allow users to easily stand up their own CSW.  pycsw is Python and can be embedded seamlessly into downstream apps with Python support (like QGIS).

Hi Matteo,
Thanks for raising this issue! From my (user) perspective, I totally
agree that QuickOSM is much more usable than the current core OSM
functionality (which I cannot get to work properly at all). I cannot
comment on the dev perspective too much though but it does not seem
like the current OSM core plugin is the best technical solution
either.
Best wishes,
Anita

I also agree that the mainstream solution is not quite usable to me, and reducing
duplications is always good.
So, if there are no good technical reasons to avoid this, I'd prefer to have QuickOSM
in core, and current functions hidden or removed.
Thanks.

For me QuickOSM has basic usability issues that should be addressed 
before we consider this. e.g. no OK/Cancel/Help buttonbar. Also no 
clear button in quick query.

Also in some ways it is even more hard to use than the built in 
offering of QGIS - QuickOSM requires detailed domain knowledge of the 
OSM schema which novice users simply won't have. 

I would like to see a bunch of presets available (like we have for 
roads and buildings in InaSAFE - see 
http://inasafe.org/en/user-docs/application-help/openstreetmap_downloader.html) 
which let you select a feature type and get it downloaded, a qml style 
applied and have the layer ready to use in QGIS.

I believe QuickOSM would be a good platform to do this on but in my 
mind as it stands it does not yet make a good replacement.

Regards

Tim

Hello,

Totally agree with Tim, especially for the Cancel button. Any large query made 
by mistake will just freeze QGIS and there is no way out except killing it.

Hi all.
Did anybody opened tickets about these issues?
On the other hand: are you able to really use the core osm download function?
Thanks.

I don't think that this is should be a problem.

I didn't agree. With the quick query function you can download data just
typing the location and a tag. Someone that has just a basic knowledge of
osm (just like me) won't have any problem to use it.

Actually I'm not able to download data from the core plugin without having
so much troubles.

I also think that with a few improvement quickosm could be the final answer
to the osm-qgis implementation.

cheers

I tried doing "-DENABLE_QT5=TRUE" and "-DENABLE_QT5:BOOL=TRUE" and it still
doesn't work. In CMakeCache.txt, it says "//No help, variable specified on
the command line.". Any recommendations on what else to try?
Thanks,
Dave

Hi,

I'm ready with a first draft of the RFC, what it's not clear to me if
there will be a chance for discussion *after* I submit it or if it
will be voted and accepted/rejects as it is.

In other words, should the discussion take place on the draft and
then, after I've collected all the different opinions and amended it,
I submit it for voting or I should just submit the draft now, and then
we work on that and finalize for voting?

Hi Dave,

Are you sure you have checked out the correct branch from my private 
repository (link in my first response)?
There is no support for this in master yet.

The definition of the cmake variable can be seen here[1]

I get it to work, but sometimes features are missing. Alternatively, it 
is possible to load OSM data that is already downloaded with Vector -> 
Add vector layer through GDAL. That seems to deal a bit better with 
features that are modelled as multipolygon relation.

The QuickOSM plugin focusses on filtered download, which the other two 
do not offer. The basic filtering can be on any key or key-value pairs. 
It is a bit nasty to type in the key manually, a preset dropdown list 
(e.g. the keys that osm2pgsql imports by default) would be nice.

One thing that the current OSM plugin and GDAL do better is using a 
spatialite database instead of a shapefile like QuickOSM does. This 
leads to truncated key names, which is a regression compared to the others.

I suggest to review the code, and merge the three possibilites to get 
OSM data into one core plugin. Unfortunately, I can not help much on coding.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Sorry this was a stupid user error on my part. I cloned your repo but was
still on the master branch. Once I switched to the qt5 branch it worked.
I've attached a patch that fixes a few compiler errors because gcc 4.4
requires that the the template type be specified in the construction of the
base class. I believe that the change shouldn't change anything on a
compiler that the code already built with.

The other issue that I ran into with the build process is that it didn't
set the value for QT_LRELEASE_EXECUTABLE even though /usr/bin/lrelease-qt5
was on the system. Once I set it using
"-DQT_LRELEASE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/lrelease-qt5" it built just fine, but if
possible, it would be nice if this value was auto-detected and set like the
rest of the values. I don't know the first thing about cmake, so
unfortunately I'm no help in trying to fix this or I'd look into it and try
to make a patch for that as well.

Also, it appears that there's not PyQt5 in the EPEL repository, so
unfortunately I can't test that at this time.

Thanks for all the help and the work to get QGIS working with Qt5,
Dave

I am actively doing the same (drafting a QEP/RFC), and would like to no the
answer to this as well. I'd assume the latter makes the most sense.

There are labels available in the github interface for pull requests, e.g.
'Draft' = open for review. We could add a new one, like 'Final Draft', that
can be applied to signify that the proposal is ready for voting. The labels
are nice, since they show up in the list view of PRs.

Also, we can add Final Draft to the template, as a value for :Status:.

Regards,

Larry

Hi, 
as in any tool, you should use either file system or database authorization.
This is the more powerfull way
I'm not aware of any lock on password like access or excel affords, but they
have limitations..

Hey,

Yeah the use of labels and the status field in the QEP is the way to go.
 Depending on the type of change it can go to voting first up, some things
are simple enough that they can be voted right away e.g "Lets use Skype
rather then IRC" (example of course).  There isn't much to flesh out there
and it would just go right to vote.

Most will go into discussion/draft mode first so feel free to open one
while it's near completion but still in draft mode. Just make sure people
are aware that you are building it out, and re-notify the mailing list once
it's done before the vote for a final look.  I would start with something
that is as close to ready as possible so that people have a good idea first
round but if some small details are missing that isn't an issue.

As you already have an idea on what you are trying to do, I think it's best
to put together as much as you can, open a QEP, then we can discuss any
details that need to be fleshed out.

I got the build of QGIS 2.4 running on RHEL 6 (

) but now when I run it, it segfaults.

Here's the stacktrace:

Any ideas on what the issue is? I can rebuild with DEBUG enabled if that

Hi Dave

there is still Qt 4 involved (partially?) as the 4 in the end of this 
line indicates:

#10 0x00007ffff3e24ce6 in __do_global_ctors_aux () from 
/usr/lib64/libQtCore.so.4

Did you clean the build directory after the build attempts for master?

For your other question (lrelease-qt5) you can revert this commit:
9c6f1698fcb3df758f024fad99ed6506d6a38e0d

I guess I'll have to figure out another approach to handle this suffix 
than just deleting it like this commit does.

Hi,

current lwgeom processing provider doesn't work with processing in
master version due to Processing refactoring.

Modification are trivial in this moment, but I don't know when this
refactoring will end to fix definitive patches to the provider.

Victor can you let me/us know refactoring roudmap?

Is there either a QT/native PyQgis method for saving the settings of a plugin dialog so that they persist between application restarts? Or is there a recommended/established best practice way of doing so?

Hello all,


I noticed that into QGIS Browser panel   are not visible  the *.qgs project
files.

I think it would be very useful to be able to load levels through the project
file.

What do you think  ?

agreed, projects could be treated as data sources, embedding layers from them into
the current project. now the same function is available through a rather obscure
dropdown menu.
all the best.

Qgis project informations on OpenHub web site are ? little bit outdated (~12 months)

Informations on this site are in my opinion realy useful and a good way to show QGIS reality and activity.

I don't know the way to update this....

If someone could do that...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.4 64 bits doesn't find a a legend item.
Message-ID: <5409D3FC.3050301@espaces-naturels.fr>

QGIS 2.4 64 bits doesn't find a a legend item.
Hello all,
I've created a plugin for QGIS 2.4, which opens a composer and updates 
labels, legends...
These items are created with the loadFromTemplate() method.
So, to update it, I run this code (for example with legend):

legends = [item for item in self.composition.items() if item.type() == 
QgsComposerItem.ComposerLegend]
         legend = legends[0]
         legend.updateLegend()

On Ubuntu 12.04, no problem. The legend is updated.
But on windows 7, Qgis (64 bits) can't find the legend item.

"print legends" gives an empty list, and an error message is displayed :

/Traceback (most recent call last)://
//  File 
"C:/Users/anthony/.qgis2/python/plugins\bdtravaux\operationdialog.py", 
line 467, in composeur//
//    legend = legends[0]//
//IndexError: list index out of range//
/
So I wonder why Qgis on Linux can find the legend item, and not Qgis on 
Windows.
I must precise the code is exactly the same on both sides (I just copy 
the Ubuntu QGIS code to the windows plugin folder, then test).
Have you an idea?
Thanks for advance
Vincent

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal: move the "Remove layer(s)" button
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=rzr35Dqgk6-fk8-Bmf4hvwO3284Ow4M+KLnOFTJ6-sbg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I'd like to circulate a UX proposal and see how people react.

For a very long time, QGIS' Layers toolbar has featured a "Remove layer(s)"
button. I have seen two issues with the button:
- Its placement becomes really odd when plugins add button(s) to the Layers
toolbar (for e.g. the New Memory Layer plugin as pictured here [
http://imgur.com/CEcIC3K,QvUzrti ])
- It can only remove vector/raster layers, won't remove groups

With the recent improvements done by Martin Dobias on the legend, and in
particular with his addition of a layer panel embedded toolbar, I propose
that:
- The "Remove layer(s)" button be moved to the layer panel embedded toolbar
[ http://imgur.com/CEcIC3K,QvUzrti#1 ]
- The button functionally is improved so it can also deal with the removal
of group(s)

Alternatively, we could get rid of the button altogether since layers and
groups can be removed via right click or keyboard shortcut, but I suspect
the touch screen based users might object.

Any objection to moving the button to the new layers toolbar?

Hi,
I guess in a GIS oriented product
Is necessary to avoid to mix the interface characteristics (the group is 
an interface object) and the data characteristics (the shapefile is not 
an interface object).

I guess more beter if add/remove dataset is separated phisically from 
add/remove a group.

The dataset is a phicical think. The shapefile is using separately from 
the qgis project.
The group is not separately from qgis project.

I guess is good question to have a "remove group" but avoiding to have a 
only button "ADD Everything" or an only button "Remove everything"

Also I guess is important to help to understand when we are on dataset 
(physical) and when we are on interface (logical).

Regards,

A.

I don't think you should comparing adding group/dataset against deleting a
group/dataset legend layer. The latter is already unified via either a
single keyboard shortcut and a single mouse right-click -> remove action.

I know this,
but my response is enlarged to a more conceptual problem.

How avoid that an user could be confusing from when it act on a logical 
level of interface,
and when it act on a physical data.

I understand that removing mean always remove and so 1 only button is 
better than two.

But my question is :
if we remove the "remove layers" leaving only the "remove this" that is 
available in the context-menu (i dont see the new legend again).

Seem quite logical to question:
why there is a "remove this" only command and there is instead an "add 
layer" and an "add group" seaprated.

Why two "add" and "one" remove ?

So the next logical question is why not remove the two add ad introduce 
only an unique "add here" in the context-menu ?
:)

So my response was to a path that can start with the remove button and 
logically end on the "add button".

Regards,

Andrea.

I have started API break doxygen page:

It is also linked from the main documentation page.

Hey Mathieu,

Yeah this makes sense to me.  It's only really used when you have the
legend open so it's good to have it close.

Hi Mathieu,
I like the idea of moving the button. Personally, I've never used it
but I get the point that it's useful on touch screens.

The refactoring is done, but i think Luigi is talking about the changes to
keep backwards compatibility. I tried the import redirections that Nathan
suggested, but they do not seem to fix the issue and there is still a need
to adapt plugins to the API change.

Ideas are welcome. Otherwise, you can safely adapt your plugin code and, as
Alex said, we will try not to change the API again unless there is a major
need for that.

Cheers

Hi Alessandro

Finally I had some time to look at your proposal (your mail and the
proposed QEP [1]). I am not that much involved in the QGIS server
development, but the Python word in the thread subject always draws my
attention :-)

I understand the first reason (use python instead of c++ to extend the
server), but I am not sure I see the second reason (allow GUI-based
configuration). Actually I find that mixing of desktop and server
plugin functionality is not making things any better than having two
separate plugins, one for desktop and one for server. They are meant
to be running in two completely different environments, it may be a
good idea to treat them in such way. Still I guess having some kind of
plugin functionality also in server may be useful.

At the same time I think in many cases it would be actually better to
have the functionality in python plugin (e.g. WPS server based on
processing framework) completely separated from QGIS server and run it
through an ordinary interface for Python (WSGI). One could even employ
some Apache rewriting rules to make the impression that the service is
still handled by QGIS server.

You mention that this is just an early prototype to see where things
can go, so I understand some things are quite hacky / experimental. If
the team is happy to proceed with the concept of plugins for QGIS
server, here are some things I think need changing compared to the
current proposal/implementation:
- we need proper object-oriented approach for the plugins. Like QGIS
desktop provides QgisInterface instance for plugins, QGIS server
should also provide some kind of QgsServerInterface which would be
used by server plugins. Such interface would give the plugin access to
all data structures it needs (e.g. parsed project).
- in the server there is already QgsOWSServer interface which existing
services derive from. Plugins should be also base on that interface
(may need some further work)
- the output from plugin should be abstracted - in the server there is
already QgsRequestHandler interface for such things (may need some
further work)
- loading of plugins should be done in a very similar way to desktop
plugins - similar to "classFactory(iface)" entry point, there could be
"serverClassFactory(iface)" entry point that returns instance of
running server plugin
- I don't like the fact that plugins declare their "service" and
"methods" in metadata.txt. I think plugins should register their
QgsOWSServer implementation to server interface when they are loaded.
This is more flexible - a plugin may register more services or provide
some extra info during the registration

Cheers
Martin

It seems that raster output from pattern fill is there by design
(either line or point pattern fill). The pattern is first converted to
image which is then used in a brush for polygon fill. This is not
specific to just SVG.

I think that would need to employ additional rendering techniques for
true vector output - instead of simple pixel-based flood fill with
texture we would need to draw vectors masked to given polygon's area.

It it respected when using map units for line widths and not milimeters, though. The script was used in an older QGIS version ages ago. So I'm pretty sure it worked once. Did I miss something or is it a bug?

It looks like something is wrong with the Python bindings there. In
render() method there is optional second parameter "forceWidthScale"
which is interpreted incorrectly and it seems to override the DPI
settings. Even if I add /In/ annotation to it, there are still some
issues. It seems it has been broken like this probably for long time.
If you want to do map rendering with different DPI settings I would
suggest one of these options:
- use QgsMapSettings / QgsMapRendererJob - if you target 2.4 and above
- use map composer

hi, i've searched for info about this topic, but i didn't find anything.

so please, is there anyone who can explain how adding some existing modules
in saga 2.1.2 into processing?

infact, in this last version of saga there are some very useful modules, in
my opinion, that could be available via Processing

thank you in advance

You just have to add a new text file to
the processing\algs\saga\description folder

The syntax of the file is the same used for GRASS algorithms, which is
described here

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/grass.txt

Hope this helps

One thing worth mentioning is that Processing does not figure out the
version of SAGA that you have installed. The default one (the one packed
for instance in the standalone installers) is 2.0.8. The user has to
manually specify the version he is using, between 2.0.8 and 2.1.0

There is no mechanism right now to deal with a 2.1.2 algorithm, so it is
only displayed in the toolbox if the user has SAGA 2.1.2 installed instead
of an older version, so maybe we should work on that as well, and not just
adding new algorihtm descriptions (though that is needed as well, of course)

Cheers

Hi Dave,

Maybe it could be QWT (and QWT-Polar) which are linked against Qt4? You 
will probably have to recompile such dependencies as well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Support for field aliases in expressions
Message-ID: <540D90D3.6080903@gmx.ch>

Hi,

I today was discussing the idea of support for column aliases in 
expressions. The use-case for this is that engineers using GIS in their 
language will be able to use the same field names that they are used to 
(but not in the common database which is english) to filter the 
attribute table etc.

For prepared execution this will not make any difference and the only 
problem I can think of apart from this is name collision, something we 
can prevent by not allowing duplicate aliases (or check and warn in the 
prepare function).

We could make it optional (in the API) and by default use expressions 
without alias support when used from python but enable it for the calls 
from core. But I am not sure this is required.

Opinions? Is there something I forgot?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get Composer's name/title using Python
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Ge8WSx5fCC5O-3NX6hk1-xg=Et=Kb-HrvQqzcWZbuF7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

For an expression function I'm trying to select a composition by searching
for the composer name/title.

I know I can get all active composers by using:

composers = iface.activeComposers()


I can then access to the QgsComposerView by iterating the composers list:

for composer_view in composers:
>     print composer_view


and that in the composerview there is a QgsComposition:

composition = composer_view.composition()


But where can I check for the composition title or name? Can't seem to find
it anywhere...

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

It's not stored in QgsComposition (unfortunately... this needs to
change sometime!). Try:

for composer_view in composers:
   print composer_view.composerWindow().windowTitle()

shouldn't be useful having here a convenience method to get the composer title?

Yes, but I don't want to add another method to the API until I can do
it properly.... which means moving this property to composition. I'll
tackle it sometime as I agree it's a painful process at the moment.

Hi, 
+1 for the need, 
I would suggest we have the following choice when clicking on a qgs file:
- open as new (and close current project)
- import layers/ embed layers  > dialog to choose layers to import or embed
(a checkbox to choose)

Cheers
R?gis

(And, it would seem there is a delta between the documented API and the
actual API available.  Will the documented API be updated soon?)

Ok, I figured it out on my own.  Here're the code snippets for computing
the center of a layer in geographic coordinates, and then doing the same
for the current viewport.

First by layer:

        layerCenter = layer.extent().center()

        if layer.crs().geographicFlag() : # if already lat/long, do nothing
            return layerCenter
        else :
            sourceCRC = layer.crs() # get the coordinate reference system
being used
            # 4326 is WGS 84
            coordinateTransform = QgsCoordinateTransform(sourceCRC.toWkt(),
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326).toWkt())
            return coordinateTransform.transform(layerCenter)

And now the center of the viewport in geographic coordinates:

        layerCenter = mapCanvas.extent().center()

        if mapCanvas.mapSettings().hasCrsTransformEnabled() : # if
projected, do inverse projection to geographic coordinates
            sourceCRC = mapCanvas.mapSettings().destinationCrs() # get the
coordinate reference system being used
            # 4326 is WGS 84
            coordinateTransform = QgsCoordinateTransform(sourceCRC.toWkt(),
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326).toWkt())
            inverseLayerCenter = coordinateTransform.transform(layerCenter)
            return inverseLayerCenter
        else :
            return layerCenter


Do you think these would make for good additions to the "Code Snippets"
section
<http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/snippets.html>
for the online documentation?

Cheers,

Mark

Yep, QWT and QWT-Polar were the offending libraries. Once I built a Qt5
version and used this, QGIS 2.4 loaded up just fine on RHEL 6. Thanks for
the help,
Dave

Good job.

Can we hope for rpm files for these? Would be nice to offer them 
officially.

Hi guys,
I will participate at the HF in Essen but I have something to ask you:

* the Linux Hotel is full but there is the possibility to bring my
sleeping bag and sleep in a room if someone wants to share it. Is
someone available for this?

* my flight arrives at the airport of Dusseldorf at 23.15 of the 1st
October. Unfortunately there are no trains to Essen at this time, maybe
someone else arrives late so we can share a taxi?

Let me know!

Cheers

Matteo

Hello Martin,

Configuration of QGIS Server from the Desktop is already implemented:
you can configure QGIS OWS Server from the the desktop today and
everybody finds it useful.
Also, I've been really astonished by some of my customers when I knew
that they are currently running QGIS Desktop on their (virtualized)
server machines in order to manage their QGIS projects and configure
the OWS QGIS server. The conclusion is that I'm not sure anymore about
the religious separation of server and client machines (I would still
keep them separate but many others don't).

But I insist that having the possibility to manage a single plugin for
both the server and the desktop side is an opportunity, a possibility
that will not enforce authors to use it.
If you (as a plugin author) will want to split the server and desktop
side of a plugin, you will be perfectly allowed to do it: you will
just choose a different name for the server and desktop side of your
plugin.

Another good reason to have the same plugins machinery for the server
and the client is that all the services to manage plugins are already
in place: plugins website, plugin installer etc., even configuration
testing from QGIS desktop would be easier to implement when it's all
in one place.

My proposal is not about any particular service and WPS was just an
example, again, this is about the possibility/opportunity to expand
QGIS server functionalities through plugins written in Python.
It's not me (and probably not you)  who knows how plugin authors will
exploit this opportunity, maybe they will write 1 million LOC
programs, maybe they will write tiny glue scripts to other programs,
who knows?

What I like of the idea of having server plugins managed through the
desktop is that the users will immediately see the available server
plugins and their updates and they will be able to install/upgrade
them with a click and they will be able to configure them with a nice
GUI. This is not something for me, for you or for the majority of the
readers of this mailing list: we like vim and editing rc files from
the shell. This is something for the average end users and believe me:
they are not always system administrators anymore.

Absolutely agreed. What we need now is a committing step that gives a
green light to Python server plugins.
With that green light we can start to discuss implementation details.
And of course we will need another green light when the details will
be fully defined.

Yes, I thought about that but it was beyond the scope of this
proof-of-concept implementation.
I guess that we would need a different iface object for the server, I
definitely need some help in this area, your advice and help is warmly
welcome!

I didn't consider using that interface (which is probably virtual
anyway), but I feel that using *only* that interface could be a
limitation, think about plugins that do not provide an OWS service or
think about a simple regexp replace plugin that replaces a string
altering the (XML) response.

Agreed, see also my final notes.

Agreed. This is exactly what I would like to see (you help would be
highly appreciated on this topic).

Yes, this in a nice idea, even if it's much more complex than just
register the available service and methods, store them in an hash and
call that methods if they match, in that case all the heavy job of url
parsing and method checking is done by C++ routines. The current
implementation is based on speed: all what that server has to do is
match the SERVICE parameter against an hash of registered plugins.
We need to keep in our mind that we are on the server side and
performance is a concern, choosing another system for plugin service
registration is fine as long it doesn't cause unacceptable delays when
the server has to find a plugin that matches the request parameters.
We should also consider that keeping service/methods in metadata could
allow for automatic GetCapabilities requests handling but I don't make
this a point.

Some final notes:

I think we should first agree on the fact that implementing Python
plugins for the server is fine, as long as the impact on the current
server performances is negligible or zero in case there are no plugins
enabled.

Second, we should decide if we want tight or loose bindings with QGIS
server request handling: in the former case, I would implement this
within signals/slots that are invoked

1. when application starts (before entering FCGI loop)
2. when the request starts (after GET/POST parsing) the plugin can
manipulate the request and issue a response (think about
authentication/authorization plugins)
3. when the response is complete (and here we would probably need
headers separated from the body), before it is sent to the client
4. at 404 (when the loop has finished without a match for C++ OWS
services), this is not strictly necessary because the previous slot
could also catch this case, but I feel this case is more clear and
moreover it is only invoked when there is no match with existing OWS
C++ core services.

I still don't know wether a signal/slot implementation (or other
similar listener patterns) will have an acceptable impact on
performances if compared with a pure 404 handler which has for sure no
impact, I guess this is not a problem but maybe someone has better
ideas.

Looking forward to read your reply and comments from others.

Regards.

Ya, my hope is to get everything packed up and included in EPEL. It will
probably be a little bit until I get that all setup because there are a few
dependencies that need to be packaged as well, but hopefully it won't be
too long.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671ppdXm5fg38HPTtpusHUfQnmXHoPOYom5evOErdKrqGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was reading the docs here:
http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_server_support.html

it says:

Moreover, the QGIS Server project provides the ?Publish to Web?
plugin, a plugin for QGIS desktop which exports the current layers and
symbology as a web project for QGIS Server (containing cartographic
visualization rules expressed in SLD).

Is that still true?

Hi,

can you please add your arrival and departure time and place (airport, train

plan the arrivals and you can find other people to share a taxi from/to the

Hi all,

I will only arrive late on Friday evening. Therefore I think occupying 
a room in the Linux Hotel for the whole time makes no sense for me 
anymore.
As Andreas Walker is on top of the waiting list I wondered if you want 
to take the room (and arrange to share it if desired).

One option for me would be to take over Andreas' room from Sat to Sun, 
as he stated he'll be leaving on Sat already.

Regards,
Matthias

If you want to be rigorous, there are different lat/long coordinate 
system, it is not only WGS84. The difference will be small of course, 
but I do not see the point of specifically testing for this case while 
it does not add anything.

Hi devs!, I am changing my SO from Windows to Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE).

I have experience in Windows using Visual Studio, but I newbie in this Linux platform, which IDE do you believe it is better to develop QGIS (or C ++ in general) ?

Qt Creator, Eclipse CDT, dev-c++ ?


Thank you very much!

Hi Alvaro,

After I initially worked with eclipse, I switched to Qt Creator and 
like it very much for it's integration with the Qt data types and 
getting running is as easy as opening the CMakeLists.txt. I can only 
recommend it.

Matthias

IMHO better to move all fTools to Processing, rather than improving
current ones.

Dusseldorf (main) airport has no arrivals/departures between 22.00 and 
6.00. Note that Weeze is far away from Dusseldorf, the bus will arive at 
01.00 in Dusseldorf.

Last trains from Dusseldorf to Essen on weekdays are at 01.30 and 01.37, 
with no chance to get further except taxi.

Another bus goes directly to Essen, arrival at 01.05 with a chance to 
get a train to Essen-Steele (but not Essen-Horst) at 01.26.

Greetings,
Andr? Joost

Hi Alessandro

If you like to publish QGIS projects and share your data you can use
QGIS Cloud via the QGIS Cloud plugin.

Have a look at www.qgiscloud.com

Thanks Horst, I'm aware of your services, my question was about a
possible bug in documentation: the docs refers to a ?Publish to Web?
plugin which currently I cannot find.

Are you saying that this sentence was intentional and it refers to
your giscloud plugin?

I am just wondering... how the aliases would be made accessible to
QgsExpression? Would be a map of aliases from vector layer set to each
QgsExpression instace? Or extend QgsFields to support also aliases? Or
something completely different? :-)

Hi all

Recently I have learned about Mozilla Open Badges:
http://www.openbadges.org/

Basically it is an open specification and infrastructure where anyone
can issue badges which people can collect - and which can be later
verified.

Maybe we could make some use of it as a kind of certifications - and
issue badges to people upon completion of training courses - or just
within the community for the sake of fun (rewards to bug reporters,
translators, donors etc).

Just an idea...

Cheers
Martin

No that is not the idea. But it can be written directly if you like.

Hi all,

I am not sure using alias would be easier for the users. Some thoughts :

* sometimes aliases are quite complicated, like "Contexte de l'?dition" for
a field named "context". We would need to escape properly aliases in
expressions. And in this example, the real field name is much easier and
shorter thant the alias

* aliases can vary between projects or even between duplicate layers in the
same project, whereas field names are stable. If I cannot reuse some
expression for the same source table because I use different aliases, I
would spend more time to rewrite the expressions ( except if we allow to
use both in expression, but the user must then do the right choice)

* I think the problem is more that as soon as you use alias for some field,
it is then very "difficult" to find back what is the real name of the
column in the source "table" : aliases are displayed instead of the column
in every part of the Gui, which is fine but sometimes not wanted. For
example, I would love to have a button in the attribute table which let me
toggle between the aliases and the real field names as the table header.

Best wishes,
Michael

I'm not sure that advertising a commercial service on the official
QGIS documentation is a good idea but if you add a clear statement
that it is a commercial service it's fine for me.

But my original post was about a potentially misleading sentence:

Moreover, the |qg| Server project provides the 'Publish to Web'
plugin, a plugin for |qg| desktop that exports the current layers and
symbology as a web project for |qg| Server (containing cartographic
visualization rules expressed in SLD).

AFAIK there is no such plugin and if there is a plugin with that menu
item, it's not installed by default.

Hi,

I use Qt Creator as well. The context help immediately available to all the
Qt classes saves a lot of time. I use Creator on all the major platforms,
in virtual machines, and it works equally well on all.

Eclipse has the advantage of doing your PyQGIS dev in it too. I prefer
PyCharm, but the new Community (free, open source) version no longer offers
the remote debugging for plugins running inside QGIS. It is only in the
'pro' version. Whereas, this is still available via PyDev plugin on Eclipse.

Regards,

Larry

I have experience using Eclipse for java development, but your advices give me the answer. I will use QtCreator, it seems awesome!
Thank you very much Matthias and Larry !

There is also a daily night bus at 01.30 from Essen Hbf to H?rsterfeld

Geschwister-Scholl-Stra?e is the nearest stop.

Hi Alessandro,

I think that this plugin is not yet necessary, because QGIS project is 
the way to "Publish to Web". No need to export the project to a SLD 
configuration file like in the youth of QGIS-Server.

Marco can confirm it, isn't it ?

Hi

Yes, the 'publish to web' plugin is from the time when QGIS server had 
SLD as the only way of configuration (before 2009). Such a plugin could 
still be usefull to upload svg images / local data to the server or to 
replace db user/pw in the project file (but the old publish to web 
plugin did only handle layers / datasources / symbology which is now 
indeed covered by the project file).

Regards,
Marco

Hi list,

I'm trying to allow experimental plugins via a Python script and it doesn't
work.

Here is the code:

from PyQt4.QtCore import QSettings
s = QSettings()
s.setValue("Qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental", True)

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.

R?mi

Hi all.
I'm noticing that deleting a large number of records from a PG table
tekes an enormous amount of time. I imagine this is due to individual
delete, une per record. Is there a way to speed this up?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

I tested with a table of 9000~ features. It took me almost no time to
delete half of the table. (Config: Ubuntu 14.04, QGIS 2.4, Postgresql 9.3)

I experienced something like this while I was working with a active
delete/update trigger of the subjected table in oracle before.

Regards,
Necip

not sure, but try lowercase + first slash:

s.setValue("/qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental", True)

is this better?

Hi Denis,

Thanks for your answer but this is not better...

If I manually enable / disable the checkbox, I can see both result with:
s.value("Qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental")
s.value("/qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental")

Do you know if there is something else to do to allow experimental plugins?

Thanks.

R?mi

Sorry, looking in the debugger shows:

s.setValue("/Qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental", True)

so the first slash was missing.

Hi Necip,
I'm talking of a table of about 200k records. I agree that for
thousands of records it is quite fast.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Does it make a difference if the attribute table is open or closed?

Got it: with a closed table, it is fast.
Still a bit inconvenient for the unconscious user.

I remember fixing something similar (or at least trying to) some months 
ago by introducing some kind of "batch job detection" on attribute 
table side.

Would be good to spend some time on implementing a proper solution for 
this one day...

After looking to the code [1], it's this setting which is read:

"/Qgis/plugin-installer/allowExperimental"

It's really strange...

Hi all.
If I filter a shapefile after loading it, the layer can no longer be
edited. Is this a provider limitation, or can we do something about it?
Moreover, if I remove the filter after attempting to edit it, the
layer remains impossible to edit until I reload it once more (and I
believe this is a bug).
Should I open two bugs then?
Thanks.

Yes.

Right, filter shape file layers are not editable.  But there's currently no way
for a OGR provider to propagate that some changes (eg. setting of a filter)
changes the layer's capabilities (ie.  disables editing capabities).  Because
of that the GUI doesn't reflect it and the "pencil" is not grayed out, although
it should.   So although you shouldn't be able to, you still can try.   But
that fails and QGIS disables the pencil.  So you can't retry again.

But resetting the filter doesn't change that and that could be considered a
bug.  But it's somewhat like makeing the files readonly while QGIS still thinks
they are writable.  That would go unnoticed too.

And there's a simple workaround, you can simply activate a different layer and
go back. QGIS will ask the provider again for the layer's capabilities and
switch the buttons accordingly.   That also goes for the pencil - if the layer
goes readonly by setting a filter, you switch to a different layer and back
it'll turn grey.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyDev Debugging Protocol changes;
	remote debug plug-in issues
Message-ID: <5411CFDF.2060107@wrbishop.com>

Hello,

   Is anyone successfully using the remote debug plug-in with PyDev &
Eclipse?   I tried using it, and noticed that the debugging protocol
used by PyDev appears to have changed, thus rendering the remote debug
plug-in less than useful.   The plug-in "appeared" to work at-first, but
when it was tried seriously, the issues emerged (specifically use of
break-points).

Has this been verified (by someone else)?  Is someone working on it?

 Remote debug plug-in version: 0.2.0; Eclipse Version 3.8.1; QGIS
Version 2.2.0; PyDev version 3.6.0

Thanks,

->Bill

I'm not working with PyDev anymore, so I can't reproduce your problem.
I've heard that Richard (CC) has also problems with his IDE. If you can give 
me a hint what has to be changed, I'm happy to include it in a new version of 
the plugin.

Pirmin

Disabling support for field names is not an option. Support would be 
for both in parallel.
Field names can can be written in double quotes already, so the only 
thing that will need to be escaped are double quotes (which are 
probably rarely used in alias names).

The one thing that needs a decision is what the expression builder 
inserts into the expression when the user chooses a field there. I 
would not mind making the usage of aliases there optional.

They would be listed both in the expression builder: "Alias 
(field_name)", so you would have one more place where you have the 
combination.
In the attribute table, I would prefer to have it either in a context 
menu of the horizontal header. Another approach would be a tooltip 
(where I wanted to add the field comment anyway).

I did not put any thoughts into the implementation yet. But I was 
thinking about the second idea (saving aliases in QgsField) before. I 
think it would be better suited there than keeping it separately. Are 
you sceptical concerning this approach?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Very poor performance moving features
Message-ID: <CALPrXdr9MLJVFwb-f8CanueOVLf3KgVWy_NTZRwrZondFU93fg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm getting very poor performance doing a simple move in edit mode of a
moderate number of features (~5,000)

This occurs moving simple point features---QGIS churns for a long time
before displaying the new location of the selected features. This has been
confirmed on both Windows 7 and OS X with both a shapefile and a memory
layer.

This appears to be a regression from 2.0---unless I'm missing a magick
setting somewhere.

Hi Pirmin,

 I can only speak to the breakpoint code, since I didn't dig any deeper;
but w/respect to that:

on line 583 (or so) of pydevd.py (in the remote debug plug-in), the
breakpoint parsing code is:

file, line, condition = text.split('\t', 2)

A new parameter (I'll call it bpid for "breakpoint ID") is now sent, and
must be parsed thusly:

bpid, file, line, condition = text.split('\t', 3)

That was the easy part.  When clearing the breakpoint, instead of
passing the line number (like PyDev used to), the breakpoint ID is
passed, so the line number must be associated with the breakpoint ID
somewhere to clear it:

bpid, file = text.split('\t', 1)  # Line 628 or so

I changed the breakpoint "set" code, but it usually took a couple of
passes through the routine before the breakpoint became "active" and
execution actually halted -- not sure what that's about.

 I couldn't find any documentation on the PyDev site about the debugging
protocol, and what else might have changed.

Thank you!

->Bill

I'm aware that there exist myriad geographic coordinate systems.  However,
I'm as yet aware of a QgsCoordinateTransform that will allow me to convert
from a projected coordinate reference system to a "gee, I don't care,
whatever geographic coordinate system."  I just referenced a popular
geographic coordinate system because it was good enough for my purposes.

However, this may be a valid concern if this does become a snippet on the
web site.  So, I'll ask again: how do I get this code added as a snippet to
the web site since it's likely a common use case for plugin development?

Hi Mark,

The snippets are contained in the documentation set:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/source/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/snippets.rst

If you update snippets.rst it will get pushed to the website.

Hi Matthias,

Ok for keeping support for both field name and field alias. This sounds
right to me.

For the attribute table, I would prefer a context menu button ("hamburger"
style) for the horizontal header instead of tooltip, as the latter are
often not well known by users (or they discover tooltips randomly)

Thanks for your work !

Michael

Hi all.
Apparently paths are always saved as absolute, even when Relative is

Since the two paths have nothing in common, having relative paths is
actually pointless. Sorry for the noise.
Thanks Juergen for clarifying.

Hi Arnaud,

I know that Sourcepole invested a lot of dev-time into improving the
Geoprocessing robustness and speed - also porting some fTools
functionslity to QGIS core and to C++. I believe that this is so far
only in QGIS enterprise (due to API incompatibilities) - not sure if and
how these improvements can make it into QGIS master. Maybe something to

Marco/Sandro/Pirmin know more about this work and what it includes.
Definitely something you should have a look at before investing too much
time into fTools.

I registered and had a play around - it looks nice but I think it is
complicated to explain to people and to get first signed up etc.  So while
it looks like  a fun thin maybe we should keep it in the geekier parts of
the project - e.g. issuing a badge for each hackfest you attend.

It works for me. What is your SIP/PyQt4 versoin?

Here it is SIP 4.15.5 and PyQt4 4.10.4.

Hi all,

While removing the diagrams was nice, I kind of miss the private members 
in doxygen.
Even if this is not the API, I think it brings a lot to the 
comprehension of the code just by reading methods' names.

Am I the only one?

Cheers,

Hi Martin,
	I implemented my own canvas item for SVG markers like you told me. But When
I created a object of custom canvas item in main, it broke down. The error
says 'This may be due to a corruption of the heap...', see more in
error.jpg.  I looked up for answers in exchange, which I found a similar
topic  here
<http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/81465/how-to-refresh-layers-independently/81470#81470> 
, in the topic Nathan did exactly what I did. I don't know why.
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/n5161805/error.jpg>  
	Here is my code:
	
	//main.cpp
			int main(int argc, char ** argv) 
		{
			// Start the Application
			QgsApplication app(argc, argv, true);

			QgsMapCanvas * mypMapCanvas = new QgsMapCanvas();
			mypMapCanvas->setVisible(true);
			mypMapCanvas->refresh();

			QString fileName = "D:\\qgis\\svg\\symbol\\poi_tower_communications.svg";
			TFMapCanvasSvgItem mTFSvgItem(mypMapCanvas, fileName);
			mTFSvgItem.setPos(0, 0);
			return app.exec();
		}
		
	// Custom canvas item class -TFMapCanvasSvgItem.h	
		class TFMapCanvasSvgItem: public QgsMapCanvasItem
		{
		public:
			TFMapCanvasSvgItem(QgsMapCanvas* canvas, QString fileName = "");
			~TFMapCanvasSvgItem();

			void paint(QPainter* painter);
			QRectF boundingRect() const;
			void setFilePath(const QString& file);
			QString filePath() const {return mFilePath;}

		private:
			QSvgRenderer mSvgRenderer;
			QString mFilePath;
		};
		
	//TFMapCanvasSvgItem.cpp
			TFMapCanvasSvgItem::TFMapCanvasSvgItem(QgsMapCanvas* canvas, QString
fileName): QgsMapCanvasItem(canvas), mSvgRenderer(fileName)
		{
		}

		TFMapCanvasSvgItem::~TFMapCanvasSvgItem()
		{

		}

		void TFMapCanvasSvgItem::paint(QPainter* painter)
		{
			if (!painter)
			{
				return;
			}

			QRectF viewBox = mSvgRenderer.viewBoxF();
			if (viewBox.isValid())
			{
				setPos(this->toCanvasCoordinates(QgsPoint(0.0, 0.0)));
				mSvgRenderer.render(painter, viewBox);
			}
		}

		QRectF TFMapCanvasSvgItem::boundingRect() const
		{	
			QRectF viewBox = mSvgRenderer.viewBoxF();
			qreal halfWeight = viewBox.width() / 2;
			qreal halfHeight = viewBox.height() / 2;
			return QRectF(-halfWeight, -halfHeight, viewBox.width(),
viewBox.height());
		}

		void TFMapCanvasSvgItem::setFilePath(const QString& file)
		{
			mFilePath = file;
			mSvgRenderer.load(mFilePath);
		}

Hi,

First, thanks for this proposal.
This is only the first version of the plugin, we are aware that development
is not finished. So if you think that the plugin has some lacks, please
fill a ticket.
Today, there are 22 tickets.

2014-09-04 17:28 GMT+02:00 Andre Joost <andre+joost at nurfuerspam.de>:

> One thing that the current OSM plugin and GDAL do better is using a
> spatialite database instead of a shapefile like QuickOSM does. This leads

>

QuickOSM uses GeoJSON for each query. As GeoJSON can't be edited in QGIS,
we add a transformation to shapefile.
All these files are in the temp folder.

About the bunch of presets, this is already possible with the current
version :
-write your query and save it
-style the data with a QML file
-modify the ini file to include the QML for each layers
-make a pull request (ini,xml and qml)

Regards,
Etienne

	view refresh!

Message-ID: <2090690608.2149607.1410783506096.JavaMail.zimbra@arpa.piemonte.it>

Hi list, 
I have a problem with my plugin OpeNoise with Qgis 2.4 
In the plugin I change the symbology of a layer with these final lines in a script: 

layer.setRendererV2(myRenderer) 


iface.legendInterface().refreshLayerSymbology(layer) 

iface.mapCanvas().refresh() 

layer.reload() 

While this works up to qgis 2.2, with qgis 2.4 it doesn't work. 
It changes the symbology in the map legend but not in the map view! 
If I refresh the map view, also with a simply zoom, also the map view turns ok! 

How can I do? 

Thanks 
Stefano

{
	if (!painter)
	{
		return;
	}
	QImage svgImage(50, 40, QImage::Format_ARGB32);
	svgImage.fill(Qt::transparent);
	QPainter imagePainter(&svgImage);
	mSvgRenderer.render(&imagePainter);
	painter->drawImage(QRectF(0, 0, 100, 80), svgImage, QRectF(0, 0, 100, 80));

Hi,

Composer in QGIS Master does not update the paper size when opening a template from a previous version.

To reproduce:

1. Create a new print composer (A4 by default);
2. Open an old template (from QGIS <= 2.4), in a different format (A3, A2, ...);
3. The paper size remains at A4.

Does anyone confirm?


Thanks!

To begin with, you need to be using Python 2.x from PyCharm (the one
included with your QGIS install).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] About python OpenGL
Message-ID: <CAFF9Zhu=6D7yNJ-n3HDq2YaM=6-JmAdLYh-2W+h_B1GshjbNsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,


I noticed that into  QGIS   \apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages\     there is
an  OpenGL\    directory.

Someone is already using it or experimenting with it  ( of course, in QGIS
) ?


Thank you

Roberto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ComposerLegend, the new layer tree,
	auto-update and QGIS-Server
Message-ID: <541941C6.1070208@gmail.com>

Hi  Devs,

I have some trouble with the new layer tree in ComposerLegend.

I have discovered that QGIS-Server 2.5 is not able to render 
ComposerLegend for a GetPrint Request, if the project has not be made by 
QGIS 2.5 and when the auto-update ComposerLegend property is set to true.

Here is what I understand :
* every ComposerLegends made with an earlier version are automatically 
an auto-update ComposerLegend
* auto-update ComposerLegend renders all the layer tree of the project
* auto-update ComposerLegend does not filter layers with the one 
selected in the ComposerMap
* the issue in QGIS-Server is just the consequences of these

Do you think the current behaviour is the good one ?
Do you think QGIS 2.6 will automatically convert ComposerLegendModel to 
ComposerLegendV2 ?
Do you think auto-update ComposerLegend linked to a ComposerMap has to 
filter layer tree with layers in ComposerMap ?

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

probabily your're mixing pyqt4 from osgeo4w installation with pyqt4 as
standalone installation (with python)... to solve it's a good shortcut
launch your pycharm from a .bat script similar to that used to start
QGIS (copy and edit it)... leave loading osgeo4w env and add
pythonpath to point your qgis install.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Telemetry Layer (MQTT Integration) - alpha released
Message-ID: <5B782305-5250-40E9-B714-4D814950E31D@southweb.co.nz>

Dear QGIS developers,

I have submitted my first QGIS plugin to the world.

It is experimental, unfinished, and no doubt has many defects.

For the past 3 months or so between farm and family chores I have worked to bring a vision to fruition - combining an IoT (Digimesh) sensor network with the QGIS platform serving as a human machine interface (HMI).  It struck me that sensors are locational by nature; and that QGIS provides an excellent ready made HMI and deployment framework.

Our work on the wireless sensor network continues in the background, but the Telemetry Layer plugin has been kept generic so that developers of other MQTT related services can integrate their platforms.

A few disclaimers:

- this is my first python development so please forgive variances in coding style as I mature.
- I love developing on my Mac, and recent tests on Windows and Linux indicate stability issues ( which seem for the most part have been dealt to on the Mac )
- I need help.  The project is at a stage where more eyes would be beneficial.
- I am new to running an open source project. My recent background has been running a Drupal web dev/hosting shop using paid contractors - so please bare with me as I familiarise myself with the protocols of voluntary collaboration

Acknowledgements - a big thanks to:

- Larry Shaffer who helped me establish my initial dev. environment
- Chris Cook - another New Zealander - with his pointers on the user interface
- Matthias who is assisting with the custom setEditForm ( which sort of works on my Mac but not on any other platform currently )

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rotating point symbols
Message-ID: <54198532.9040108@carto.net>

Hi,

In an old QGIS version (can't remember which (probably pre QGIS 2.0)) we
had a tool to rotate point symbols, if a column storing rotation values
was correctly specified. It even had fixed rotation steps (every 15
degrees) when pressing a modifier key (I think the alt-key).

In a current QGIS version I can only edit rotation values manually in a
widget, but not interactively on the map canvas.

There is a rotation tool active in the "Advanced digitizing toolbar",
but this seems to work only for polygon or linestring features and not
for points.

Anyone knows what happened to the interactive point rotation tool? Why
did it disappear? We need this back - interactive rotation is more
intuitive than rotation by manually changing rotation values in a form.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

Apparently the "Point rotation" tool is still available (at the end of
the "advanced digitizing toolbar"), but it is not compatible with the
rule-based renderer ;-( If I use a classified renderer or a single
simple renderer I can choose the rotation field.

Maybe we could fix this at the hackfest?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

 

I have a Qgis C++ plugin that adds a tool, I build my plugin using the
libraries of Qgis built from sources
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/release-2_4>  with Microsoft Visual
Studio as described here
<http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/I

My tool works fine with built Qgis but not with the installed Qgis 2.4.

When I activate my tool and then turn to another tool Qgis crash and write a
minimum dump file:

Message-ID: <49D53E66756E9E4D9310D19261A79ADB31B4BA33@HOLYSTONE.nnpa.com>

I see that QgsMapCanvas.mapRenderer() is deprecated. We are currently using it as follows:

crsSrc = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs()

If I read the documentation correctly, the new way of achieving this is:

crsSrc = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().mapSettings().destinationCrs()

Is that correct? If so (as a QGIS plugin and Python beginner) what is the best way to handle the deprecation and maintain backwards compatibility, given that QgsMapCanvas.mapRenderer() is only in 2.4+?

Thanks

Tom

Hi,   
thanks Luigi and Gari by yours answer , but I could not configure well the pycharm with PyQGis, searching in internet find this document "Setting up PyCharm for PyQGIS and Qt" , and followed the instructions without success.  
I don't understand how configure the set PATH, set PYTHONHOM, and set PYTHONPATH variables, and which are the sets the variables that we need for the QGIS and Qt libs.  
  
The PyCharm IDE , don't recognise this modules : from qgis.core import QgsApplication  
  
If I use the python comand line show this message : no module named qgis.core  
  
How resolve this situation?

Hi,

Increasingly I use QGIS expressions. Some of them are quite complex and
span numerous lines (e.g. nested CASE statements).

I noticed that line breaks are not preserved. This makes the statement
much harder to read.

Is there a chance that future QGIS versions could preserve linebreaks or
is there a problem saving and restoring the line breaks of the expressions?

Along the lines: is it possible to add comments in QGIS expression?

Thanks,
Andreas

You could use:

try:
	crs = c.mapSettings().destinationCrs()
except:
	crs = c.mapRenderer().destinationCrs()

or shorter:

crs = c.mapSettings().destinationCrs() if hasattr(c,"mapSettings") else c.mapRenderer().destinationCrs()

Hi Paolo

I've followed the submission process and uploaded here.

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/TelemetryLayer/

That said, it is only really ready for developers to look at as there is much finishing work to be done.

Message-ID: <541A742C.3050509@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Two possible issues:
* if I deselect "Render", the zoom still works on the canvas, enlarging the image
without increasing the resolution
* a single click on the canvas moves the image on the direction opposite of the
position of the mouse respect to the center of the map.
Should I open two tickets?
All the best.

What would be your expected behaviour? If you disable rendering, the
most recently rendered image will be used - seems to me better than
showing nothing.

That's the same behaviour of pan tool as when rendering is enabled...
again, what would you expect to happen?

I have the same problem, and have had it for some time. I previously reported
it for 2.2. My previous post received a response from J?rgen who said he had
never seen this problem. This is not surprising as core developers build the
application and plugins in one go, whereas this problem only crops up when a
C++ plugin is deployed into a QGIS installation other than the one it was
built with.

After many unsuccessful attempts at resolving the issue, I had to resort to
an ugly, home-brewed workaround that only works for points (using the
preNotify signal of QgsApplication to detect a map canvas click).

Kind regards,
Hartmut

I'd expect the zoom being deactivated, and the image on the canvas
stay fixed.

IMHO a single left click should do nothing, the map should not move.

Thanks.

So you mean that map canvas would be completely 'disabled'?
What if someone zooms to a layer / full extent / bookmark?

To me the current behaviour makes more sense - but personally I would
rather remove the 'Render' option completely.

I would be in favour of that - whether rendering is turned on or off -
but maybe others feel like that is a useful feature, so I wouldn't
remove that without wider discussion.

Hi,

the hackfest in the linuxhotel officially starts on Oct, 2nd (Thursday) but
there are already some people using the 1st Oct for arrival. This is fine for
a few, but please be aware that we can use the large rooms for hacking not
before the evening (6-7pm), because they are still conducting trainings on
wednesday.

To have a better overview, please add your arrival time to the wiki, so we
can plan where to stay, if it is before the evening.

I would be also in favor of removing it once everything is optimized for 
MTR -- I read that WMS is still missing.

Later, I don't think it makes any sense to keep it.

My 2 cents.

IMHO if one disables rendering, the image on the canvas should stay as
it is, regardless of user interaction. Otherwise it is surprising to
see some actions performed (badly) like zzoming, others not, like
adding or removing layers.

I don't agree. For me the idea (at the origin) was to avoid to get stuck 
with the map being rendered.
If you have a very slow wms and want to precisely adjust the extent of 
the canvas, you would first disable rendering, move the map as you want 
to and then start rendering.

It used to make a lot of sense before MTR.

As previously written, I think it will become totally obsolete once 
rendering of every type of sources can be properly stopped.

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw35EJVasm+29ptfa5xPR5NEtiQstQ6O1H87FTtZBT_cag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

with QGIS Server is possible to show some layers or attributes for a
group of users, that are hidden for everyone else?

I.e.:

apache authenticated user:  TESTSHOW can view the layer "TESTLAYER" in a project

apache unautenticated user: the TESTLAYER is hidden in the same proejct.

So this could be for some fields of a layer, due to privacy.

Is this possible?

Hi Victor, have you found the cause problem? It would be nice if you
can fix fix this startup slowdown before 2.6 version (dated at end of

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Postgis integer field with null values problem
Message-ID: <1411136508.78828.YahooMailNeo@web122301.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi

When I'm editing PostGIS tables (they are actually related tables) in QGIS, if I leave an 'integer' field of this table as 'null' (blank), QGIS always changes the field value to 0, instead of leaving it as 'null'.

Is this the intended behavior? This causes me a lot of troubles, since I have some triggers associated with these fields, which being filled with 0, make the triggers run, ending the result with no sense.

This happens to me both in QGIS 2.4 and 2.5 master. 

Thanks!



Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Did you build you plugin with the libraries shipped with QGIS (ie. in the
OSGeo4W qgis-dev package for master or qgis-devel for the released version)?
That's what I do.   I don't build external (ie. non-core) plugins and qgis in
one go either.

What the following query returns?:
SELECT type FROM geometry_columns WHERE f_table_name = 'bus_stops' AND
f_table_schema = 'topology'

Why the "bus_stops" table is into the topology schema? I would
recommend you to use a different schema

Unless I'm missing something obvious, there doesn't seem to be any way
to change a report from "Feedback" back to "Open". The only options I
see in the feedback field are "In Progress" or "Closed". I don't want
to set issues to "In Progress" if they're not actively being worked
on, and obviously closing them isn't the right move.

Is there any way to clear a feedback flag and reset a report back to being open?

I think under the default work flow in Redmine, the answer is no.
However it is customizable. I can make this change if the devs want this.

The workflow settings are per user group by ticket type, ie Developers
can move back to open but not Reporters and only for Bugs not Features,
etc... It can also be fine grained that you can get back to Open status
only from specific other status.

Let me know what the devs want and I'll modify.

Thanks,
Alex

that is ok, and which QGIS and LizMapWC versions?

Could you provide the name of the geometry column in bus_stops table?
I don't see the geometry column name either in ST_AsText or
ST_Trasform, so it raises to
syntax error when you are editing the bus_stops table from the web client.

Building plugins with the libraries shipped with qgis-devl package resolve

Did you build you plugin with the libraries shipped with QGIS (ie. in the
OSGeo4W qgis-dev package for master or qgis-devel for the released version)?
That's what I do.   I don't build external (ie. non-core) plugins and qgis
in
one go either.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS sometimes freezes in Windows 7 x64
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A28056B4C64BD@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Too often QGIS 2.5 weekly (it happens in 2.4 too) tends to freeze while drawing the layers. It normally happens when I move around or zoom out, but I think it can happen when displaying a layer after loading it). So I guess it has something to do with drawing data or accessing data from the source.

I would like to report this issue (or these issues), but I am not ready to begin debugging QGIS yet.

How can I best help you devs in investigating the issue?


-          Is there a log file I can gain anything from?

-          I don't get any messages about a minidump.

-          QGIS is not responding, so I can't access the message log.

-          Normally QGIS doesn't return to a working/responding state.

My OS is Windows 7 x64 and QGIS is 2.5.0-37 weekly (e46aa62).


Regards Casper

Which packages are you referring to?   And where did you find that ancient
link?   The current packages are available on our website[1].  You can also
find a link to the sources and INSTALL[2] there, that has a more current
description on how to build.

Hi Bernhard.

I cannot reproduce my issue and it doesn't seem related to loading.

My project consists of:

- No raster
- Shapefiles only
- Rule based styling
- No groups

Though our setups are very different, the issues could be related. If I could reproduce the issue, it would be a lot easier to report it. 

I can see the see the yellow balloon tip informing me of messages added to the message window just before QGIS stops responding. But I can't see the messages since QGIS is not responding.

Hi Casper,

Did you try disabling parallel rendering to make sure that the
crashes/freezes are really related to the multi-threaded renderer?

Settings -> Options -> Rendering -> Disable Checkbox "Render layers in
parallel using many CPU cores"

There seem to be issues with the multi-threaded renderer, but apparently
they are very difficult to reproduce and debug.

Fortunately one can very easily disable multi-threade rendering until
the issues are solved.

Hi Casper,

are these shapefiles on a local or network drive?
Follow Andreas hint to disable multi-threaded renderin and see if it helps.
Shapefiles on network drives are known to be slow, maybe this plus 
multi-threaded rendering causes the crash.

Hi Bernhard.

My shapefiles are indeed on a network drive, and it might be a timeout or similar causing the crash.

I can disable threaded rendering, but as long as I cannot reproduce the crash, I cannot test if it works :)

I have dragged my QGIS message window outside the QGIS window and I hope to be able to see the messages added when QGIS stops responding.

Regards, Casper

Hi Andreas.

It might solve the problem, but as long as I cannot reproduce the problem, disabling multi threaded rendering only saves me the trouble of the issue (in case it helps at all). I would rather see if I can help narrow down the problem by not disabling and give you all the information I can.

But thanks for the tip. I will relay it to my colleagues.

Regards, Casper

Hi Casper,

Did you try disabling parallel rendering to make sure that the crashes/freezes are really related to the multi-threaded renderer?

Settings -> Options -> Rendering -> Disable Checkbox "Render layers in parallel using many CPU cores"

There seem to be issues with the multi-threaded renderer, but apparently they are very difficult to reproduce and debug.

Fortunately one can very easily disable multi-threade rendering until the issues are solved.

Hi Casper,

I know it is hard to track down a problem if you cannot reproduce the 
crash so the strategy would be to
* _either_ move all shape files to a local drive, continue working with 
that and see if it does not crash any more
* _or_ disable multi-threaded rendering, continue working with that and 
see if it does not crash any more

I'm not a windows user, but if I remember correctly you can get debug
information with the tool debugview [1] (only on debug builds - that
means 2.5/master but not 2.4). Maybe you get some interesting
information there?

Thank you for taking the time to help resolve this problem.

Hi Matthias.

I have tried DebugView and shortly after QGIS stopped responding. It gave me loads of information, much more than I will post here.

I can see a lot of invalid geometry exceptions regarding "Invalid number of points in linear ring": 

[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4
[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsmessagelog.cpp(45) : (QgsMessageLog::logMessage) 2014-09-22T11:12:46 GEOS[1] Exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4
[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: Shell is not a LinearRing
[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: Unknown exception thrown
[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsmessagelog.cpp(45) : (QgsMessageLog::logMessage) 2014-09-22T11:12:46 GEOS[1] Exception: Unknown exception thrown

Some of these exceptions are also written to the QGIS message window (which I have open outside the QGIS window). 
I guess they comes from the geometry simplification used by QGIS to speed up rendering.

I have attached the final lines from DebugView[1] and I guess they are responsible for QGIS not responding.

Should I create an issue for this?


Regards, Casper

Hi Matthias.

I was a little too fast in my previous mail. The final lines from DebugView wasn't from QGIS but from my browser :|

Here I have the last lines DebugView received before QGIS stopped responding:

Hi Matthias.

I have tried DebugView and shortly after QGIS stopped responding. It gave me loads of information, much more than I will post here.

I can see a lot of invalid geometry exceptions regarding "Invalid number of points in linear ring": 

[10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4 [10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsmessagelog.cpp(45) : (QgsMessageLog::logMessage) 2014-09-22T11:12:46 GEOS[1] Exception: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4 [10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: Shell is not a LinearRing [10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsgeometry.cpp(99) : (throwGEOSException) GEOS exception: Unknown exception thrown [10468] ..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsmessagelog.cpp(45) : (QgsMessageLog::logMessage) 2014-09-22T11:12:46 GEOS[1] Exception: Unknown exception thrown

Some of these exceptions are also written to the QGIS message window (which I have open outside the QGIS window). 
I guess they comes from the geometry simplification used by QGIS to speed up rendering.

I have attached the final lines from DebugView[1] and I guess they are responsible for QGIS not responding.

Should I create an issue for this?

I'm not a windows user, but if I remember correctly you can get debug information with the tool debugview [1] (only on debug builds - that means 2.5/master but not 2.4). Maybe you get some interesting information there?

Thank you for taking the time to help resolve this problem.

Did you try to turn off labelling? Automated placement of labels can
cost quite a bit of CPU.

Hi Matthias

So your guess is that I kill QGIS by labeling too much? 

If this is the case I guess I should remember to set a zoom level on the labeling. I will try that and see if it gets stable.

But what about all the reports about invalid geometry?

Did you try to turn off labelling? Automated placement of labels can cost quite a bit of CPU.

Hi ,

It seems Lizmap cannot find out which column is the geometry column. Could
you save the layer in QGIS via Menu > Layer > Save as Layer Definition
File, open this file with a text editor, delete the password and host
(found in the <datasource> element ) and send it to me by email, so that I
can see the datasource ?

Thanks in advance
Michael

What if you disable simplification for the labelled layers? (Layer
properties-> rendering tab). Does that help?

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.5 development cycle ends on next friday,
2014-09-29[1] (4 days away), we'll go into feature freeze and start the 2.6
release cycle in which we'll do testing, bugfixing, translating and release
preparations instead of feature development for the 2.6 release.

Please merge your new features before 2014-09-26 and prepare to start testing.
The 2.6 release will be on 2014-10-24[2] (32 days away).

If the invalid geometries is in the data, IMHO you should fix them. 
Shapefiles with invalid geometries sometimes behave weird. An easy way 
for a start is buffering with 0. Do buffer into a new layer.

Thanks for your response, J?rgen.
Yes, I did build my plugin with the release libraries and that results in
an access violation every time I switch from my own to a built-in map tool.
This does not happen if I build plugin and QGIS in one go and run my plugin
as in that QGIS I built myself.

Hi everybody

I just committed a change to QgsFilterLineEdit that changes the text
color to gray when it is set to NULL. On my system (gnome) the color is
now the same like when the lineedit is disabled.

What do the colors look like on other systems (mac/windows)?

To test open an attribute form with the default TextEdit widget and a
Null value.

Thank you for helping,

Hi,

I have a pull request opened that adds PKI (certificate/key) authentication
support to OWS connections (currently just WMS) [0]. Looking to get this
into 2.6 and would appreciate if anyone with a WMS server setup with PKI
configuration could help test the PR.

There is a link at the bottom of the PR description to a page with info on
quickly setting up an OpenGeo Suite GeoServer configuration with PKI,
example certs and key included.

If anyone know of a consistently live server setup which we could run unit
tests against, please let me know.

Message-ID: <87C14AF3-796D-4C97-B08E-E715C603084D@southweb.co.nz>

Our plugin:

https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/TelemetryLayer/

Depends on Memory Layer saver to save its layers.  (I need to add this to the docs)

I note that some plugin frameworks have a "dependencies" array in their module definitions (metadata.txt for QGIS plugins) and wondered if this was something useful to consider as a feature.

Thanks

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS specific installs of Python on Windows is
	suboptimal
Message-ID: <CAHVp9Xo05+_g8oFNqEu2R9N7sc8Q4msQS0m6LwhtbhiWmz_Hmg@mail.gmail.com>

In my recent work with an plugin requiring additional python libraries, I
found that the current method of creating a separate python install for
QGIS is quite problematic because:
1. If you have multiple copies of Python installed and you want to use
either easy_install or pip to install additional python libraries this can
be complicated for users to get stuff installed in the right place
2. The QGIS instance of python is not listed in the Windows registry so if
you want to use tools that depend on the windows registry to install
additional libraries (pyaudio for example), that doesn't work unless you
use a script or manually create those windows registry entries.

In this past of having a GIS product separate install of Python was also
followed by ESRI but I noticed installing 10.2.2 today that they appear to
have moved to installing or adding to an generic python install. I've yet
to verify that but based on the install path it looks that way and would be
in my view a big improvement to saving disk space and keeping things
simpler.

I don't know what the implication is for building to 2.6 install tools for
when that version is released, but as I see it if we could allow users to
just add the necessary libraries to a generic python 2.6 or 2.7 install,
that could make things a whole lot easier for QGIS users.

Thanks for the reminder J?rgen.

Tim, could you create a visual changelog page for the upcoming 2.6 release?
We can start now to append the new features so it can be as complete as
possible.

I think external plugins dependencies are our weak spot for plugins. Anything we can
to to make life easier for both developers and users to detect and install needed
libs is most welcome.
All the best, and thanks for raising the point.

Hi Paolo,

I have some doubt on automatic installation of dependencies.
This fear this will be a bad practice for security.

As example:
one black-hacker could create a simply and apparently innocent plugin for qgis.
A plugin that the responsible manager of the plugin repo of qgis could
surely admit in the repo of qgis. Because it seem to have no
particular problems except some extern dependencies.
But that plugin will have a dependencies that cause the installer
automatically to install another plugin from external source.
And this thirdy part plugin could be a malware.
A.

Maybe a better solution would be to integrate the memory layer saving into
core. It'd be a nice feature to have in any case.

+1 to get new memory layer and memory layer saver plugins into core. Memory
layers are a very cool & useful function of qgis, all of its basic
functionality should be in core.

+1.
Adding new Memory layers should definitly be part of the core, as well as auto-
saving for them.

Hi all,
I didn't mention the option to port Mem Layer saver to core for two reasons:
- that doesn't solve the proble of general plugin dependencies
- we already discussed how to port Mem Layer Saver to core on list, and
ended up to the conclusion that we needed to modify qgs format from a xml
text file to a zip container of project properties + datas + resources
(symbols svg for instance)

Porting that plugin to core is allright to me, but we will make qgis the
only soft to write data files along data project file, with high risks of
data loss (because user will forget it or trash it). Do we really want it? 

+ to port, only if we clearly understand the impacts. I would prefer a new
qgs format. 
Cheers
R?gis

Ahh, I wasn't aware of this earlier discussion, I'll look it up.

That's not entirely true - MapInfo saves data written into cosmetic layers
in its project (workspace) files. It's quite handy for quick
cartographic-only modifications to a map.

Hello,

Le mardi 23 septembre 2014 12:35:41, R?gis Haubourg a ?crit :

Actually the general plugin dependencies problem is a distribution problem, 
and should not be solved inside QGIS. We really do not want to reimplement a 
multi-platform package management software.

As stated before, auto-installing packages should also be done with great 
care, which is as well why package management software exist in the first 
place.

There are a few possibilities to improve the current situation :
* Make it clear for the user that additional packages are needed for a plugin, 
and show him a page explaining how to install them, according to its platform.

* Have a stricter policy on plugins regarding external dependencies (e.g. do 
not accept plugins in official repo which have dependencies on packages not 
included in osgeo4w, or default qgis binaries)

* Have these dependency informations available in the plugin's metadata

* Have a better plugin architecture, which makes it easier to deal with 
dependencies, using tools made for that purpose (i.e. make qgis plugins real 
python packages installable with pip install).

I think the main point is first to warn the user and guide him for further 
install steps, instead of getting python "import failed" errors.

Porting the new memory layer feature + promping the user to save unsaved 
memory layers when closing the project would already be a first step, without 
the need for data storage in qgis project file.

Hi all,

I think we have to clearly separate two different things here:

 * Dependencies on plugins
 * Dependencies on python modules

This thread is about dependencies on other plugins. This is much easier
to tackle (python modules are handled differently on different
platforms) and the security implications brought up by Andrea Peri do
not affect it.

Thank you R?gis for putting this into a bigger picture.
I think moving mem layer saver to core should be discussed separately
(good candidate for an RFC/QEP, Concerning format: I would like to see
git instead of zip ;-) ).

+1 for adding plugin dependencies.

Matthias

sure thing, but currently installing an additional libs on win is pretty difficult,
and we would better do what is possible, reusing what is already available, to make
user life easier.

agreed, see above. however, please not that currently many win users would install
whatever, even from unknown sources, to solve their problems. if we can improve this,
much better

I'm aware of mapinfo capabilities to store data and graphics (and mxd too),
but I'm not in favour of potentially store large datasets in a xml file
(large enough today with big projects).

Right, sorry if I somewhat induced this confusion.
Both issues are worth dealing with, however.
All the best, and thanks.

I agree with earlier comments that this is largely a distribution problem
and that automatic functionality creates some risks.

I posted yesterday about how Windows installs having their own versions of
python installed makes using tools like pip or easy_install challenging.

I can see two possible ways forward:
1. Use a generic python install rather than installing its own version.
This way pip and other tools will work fine.
2. Provide a tool to execute pip for the QGIS specific version of python
for Windows installs (I don't know what happens under Max OS)

It seems to me that option 1 would be the most obvious choice making
Windows installs similar to Linux installs and simpler to add and remove
libraries as needed. I think that adding more and more stuff to the OSGeo4W
install doesn't make sense.

There's a reason OSGeo4w installs it's own Python. Unlike Mac and Linux,
Windows does not ship with Python. There are other common GIS
applications that do ship Python and it often conflicts with OSGeo4w
Python (Version, Compiler, and OSGeo GDAL/OGR namespace). Many python
libraries actually require compiling of C modules, which isn't handled
by pip (binary files have to be in pypi). So in part it's really hard to
rely on the Windows Python if there at all to be the right version, and
multiple versions of Python on Windows fight for the registry entry
(last installed wins). So someone installing Python 3 can easily break
QGIS if relying on system python.

I'll also note that several people have had success using pip within
OSGeo4w. See previous posts on qgis and osgeo4w lists. Making pip easier
to use in OSGeo4w is likely a better choice.

Several of us on IRC have discussed this topic in depth before, at least
in regards to external python deps. My leaning is to just wrap pip
functionality to help users.

As for python plugin deps, I say, only allow deps on core python plugins
and on plugins in the official repo. As is, if someone loads python
code, it can always download whatever from some url using pure python.
Hard to hide it when the code is open and available, but we don't
heavily check it either. On that note, we should also consider moving
the python plugin repo to https.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] standardisation of the editing map tools: modify
 behaviour of press-pan-release tools
Message-ID: <54228731.9090709@gmail.com>

Hi all,

There is somehow an inconsistency in the behaviour of the current 
editing map tools.

Some, like add features, uses the left click to trigger the action.
Others, like the node tool or move feature use press-pan-release mouse 
events:
* mouse press to select the node/feature
* mouse mouse to move it
* mouse release sets the position.

I would propose to standardise this and for the latter tools propose the 
following work flow:
* left click enables the move
* left click again to validate at position
* or right click to cancel

Why changing this?

If you look at CAD software, they also use the proposed approach. And 
there's a reason for doing so, which is valid for QGIS too.

We are looking at improving the CAD tools in QGIS. In this area, I 
recommend trying the fantastic CADinput plugin made by Olivier Dalang. 
The plugin works on top of any map tool and enables CAD tools for each 
of them.

The problem with the press-pan-release map tools is that you can't truly 
interact while you are actually in the action of the map tool (holding 
the click):
* you can't click anymore and this prevents from using intermediate 
points (you have to use the tool several times and repeat the operation 
as many times as intermediate points you need)
* it is not really user friendly to have to press keys while holing the 
click

This is why, changing the map tools behaviour is requested if we want to 
go further with CAD tools in QGIS.

Regarding the future of CAD tools in QGIS, I am quite sure the plugin 
proposed by Olivier would be a good way to go for QGIS, but it still 
might be a bit early to integrate it in core. The idea is rather first 
to extend the API and propose ready to use methods, so it will be easy 
to implement your preferred solution in a plugin.

But first, we need to standardise the map tools.

So, the bottom line, any objection to changing the behaviour of:
* edit node tool
* move feature
* rotate feature
* move label
* rotate label
* any other press-pan-release map tool that I am not aware of
???

Best wishes,

Denis

Luca, I just followed your advice and moved the Processing.initialize()
call to initGUI().

I did not test, however, to check that startup time has improved. The
change is already in master, so you can test it.

Let me know if you have more suggestions

Thanks!

Hi all,

moving Processing initialization to initGui() does not change situation.
I played with this about week or two ago. The problem is in another
place and I plan to work on this with Victor at hackfest

With all due respect I've never understood why click-click is better than click-drag for moving. 
I've always found select and drag far more intuitive and echoes equivalent actions in most of the other similar tools I use.

As for the apparent inconsistency, in my head they're different sorts of things.
If I'm adding a feature, I put it (click) here.
If I'm moving a feature, I pick it up (click-drag) move it to there and put it down (release).

I further suspect that since the node tool does more than just move nodes, this is probably asking for a separation into node-move and a node-insert and a segment-move and a... tools.
I really like having all of these in one tool, instead of perpetually going off to some menu to pick a different tool.

Please say this isn't a case of; we need to change the established behaviour of the main program to make a plugin work better - because it's pretty easy to read that way.

Sorry if that sounds a bit grumpy, I just don't see how this is better.

Hi Denis,

though I'm not a hard core digitizer/edittool user, I think removing
inconsistency is always good!
But I would really wait for some input of a hardcore editing user.

What about writing per tool, the behaviour you propose in a QEP
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals) so we can discuss
it there?

One thing that I cannot fit in your proposal is how to do the multiple
selection of features (eg used for rotating and moving a group of
features). If you have one tool for both selecting features and
dragging/rotating them, when does the tool 'know' when you finished
selecting and start doing the action? (trying to answer myself: using
the ctrl and/or shift key??). You also miss the different selection
options... OR you make the selection via the selection tool optional: so
for one feature the 'selecting' is via a click, for a set of features
you go via the normal selection tool?
Last thing: when moving (a set of features) without really 'dragging',
is the 'dragging' visible in your proposal? Or can you only see the
displacement/move after the second click. I hope I can preview stuff
during  my action, but I cannot fit that in your view of being able to
do other things then.

Shorter version: as long as you make it more consistent and usable: go :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

There is no overhead: still the same number of actions with the finder 
two presses instead of a press + a release. And you gain the freedom of 
your finger to do something else while moving.

I suspect, in such cases, we speak more from experience rather than true 
intuition. People with long CAD experience find the click-click much 
more intuitive than people used to dragging-and-dropping pictures into 
word the other way around.

That's a way of reading it. The other way is we need this if we want to 
go further with CAD tools in QGIS.
I could propose to go directly with CAD tools in core, but answers like 
yours prove we need to go step by step. Otherwise, it'll be impossible 
to reach a consensus. We need first some good plugin example to find the 
best way to go.

So yes, the idea is to make the plugin work better to later integrate it 
in core - whatever plugin that is.
Anyhow, any CAD tool will require this change.

of course the tool would remain unique. I don't intend to change this.

Click means select features + activate the tool (e.g. rotate).
You would still have the rectangle tool to select several features. Once 
you released the mouse button, all selected features they are directly 
activated.
We can think of being able to add/remove features by shift or ctrl + 
click which are common modifiers to extend/modify selections.

Of course, you see the dragging. Right click will cancel, left click 
will validate.

Doing other things, is mainly using intermediate points. For example, 
you need to move 10m north, 5m west.
You will first move 10m north using an intermediate point (the left 
click will not be given to the map tool), then go 5m west (left click 
given to the map tool).

let me intervene here :-) I have been a GIS user (ESRI) at my first 
contact with CAD (Bentley Microstation in that case) about 10 years ago. 
At that time many tools needed two clicks in Microstation (first = 
select, second = accept selection, or right click = select other). 
Nowadays you can just select a feature with left click and holding down 
the left mouse button you move it by moving the mouse, just like in 
QGIS. The dedicated "move feature" tool still works the way you propose 
(left click = select, left click = drop). It was hard for me to get used 
to that, I am glad I did not do any serious digitizing in CAD.

Bottom line:
1) Intuitive is what you are used to.
2) The way it currently works in QGIS is IMHO more intuitive because I 
am used to it :) and it is the way graphic software works (I tried 
LibreOfficeDraw, Inkscape and GIMP for a start).
3) I wouldn't say this to be a "change with not many consequences".

IMHO QGIS should do it similar to other GIS packages (how is this solved 
in e.g. ArcGIS or MapInfo?) because users coming from similar software 
packages should feel at home, not those coming from CAD.

I am not saying the idea is bad but the consequences might be larger 
than you expect especially for occasional users if the behaviour of the 
tools is different from what they would expect from their prior 
experience (of other GIS or graphic software).

I could surely live with it (am not a hard-core digitizer either).

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1hQAzA-_NKygSBMhQTYS=NH8Jie6A0_+eUtw0sRiyqiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, (i'm using qgis 2.4)

how can view the object properties of a composer item I added with my plugin?
I tried with showItemOptions(...) but it doesn't work

in this example, I add a composerMap, but I cannot find a way on how
to automatically view the properties in the Composer Window:

# open the composer that I created
composition = composerView.composition()
composer = composerView.composerWindow()
composer.show()

# now I create and add the map
composerMap = QgsComposerMap(composition, 0, 0, float(paperwidth),
float(paperheight))
composition.addComposerMap(composerMap)

# add the command to history
composition.pushAddRemoveCommand( composerMap, "New map added" )

composerMap.setSelected(True)
composerView.setComposition(composition)
composition.update()

# these commands doesn't show the item properties
composerView.selectedItemChanged.emit(composerMap) # doesn't work
composer.showItemOptions ( composerMap ) # doesn't work

Message-ID: <5422DA73.8010508@carto.net>

Hi,

I frequently have data with NULL values and still have problems with
QGIS correctly handling them.

While QGIS displays NULL values of text types correctly as NULL, NULL
values of numeric data types (e.g. smallint, double, numeric) just
display as an empty string. I would rather like to see NULL instead of
the empty string in the widget.

Can we do something about that so that NULL values are correctly
displayed as NULL also for numeric data types?

QGIS server even displays numeric values with NULL values as "0" instead
of "NULL" - which is wrong in my opinion. It is misleading as 0 and NULL
are not the same.

My data is in Postgis and I tested both with 2.4 and current master.

Thanks,
Andreas

Just implemented it for text edit (when using QgsFilterLineEdit or
QLineEdit). [1]

Please let me know if it works and if you are missing it in other places
as well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crash with undo command
Message-ID: <004a01cfd809$6a383ed0$3ea8bc70$@spaceyes.fr>

Hi,

 

I have a plugin that allows to change an attribute value of added feature to
the selected value of a combo-box.

I change the attribute when the signal "featureAdded" is emmited (ie. Before
the endEditCommand of "add feature" is called) so in this undo command we
have in the order:

1-  QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandAddFeature

2-      QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandChangeAttribute

 

If we undo "add feature" command it must call undo() on all child commands
in reverse order, but when I debug in QGIS it do it in the order not in
reverse order ie. It call:

1-  QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandAddFeature::undo()

2-      QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandChangeAttribute::undo()

 

That's why Qgis crash when I undo "add feature" command

An explanation for this?

 

Is there any way to knew if the signal "feature added" is emitted when a new
feature is added not from commitChanges(), redoEditCommand() and
undoEditCommand()?

 

Thank you

Nejia

It would be nice to use setSpecialValueText for spin boxes if possible 
too ;)

Adding a clear button could be done similarly to the the QgsDateTimeEdit.

Thank you Matthias for the very quick fix.

This fix only changes the NULL value behavior of the widget - right?

This will probably have no effect on what QGIS server does with NULL
values, right?

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

I think the mails so far already show that it's no easy topic and I

I tend to agree with this, +1
but then there's also a point that the usual GIS packages might have
got it wrong ;-)

+1 After finding the correct documentation page, it was rather
straightforward to use pip to install more packages. I summed it up in
a few line: http://anitagraser.com/2014/07/13/installing-pysal-for-osgeo4w/

This is probably due to the fact that in _some_ cases expressions are
(unfortunately) not kept in verbatim format as they were input -
instead they are parsed and later converted back to text, loosing all
formatting.

It is possible and it would not be hard. But until we fix the problem
mentioned above, your comments would get lost in some places :-/

Correct, it's just representation on forms.

I once introduced a method QgsExpression::expression() along
QgsExpression::dump() which originally returned the saved verbatim
string and was subsequently changed several times (responsibility for
this including myself) to call dump() or return the original string.

Last time I wanted to change this back to the saved string, I was
stopped me because IIRC there are situations where the expression gets
modified directly, so the input string does not correctly represent the
expression and needs to be recreated.

I would propose the following:

  - QgsExpression::dump() should always recreate the string from the
data structure
  - save the original expression string and return it with
QgsExpression::expression()
  - unless the expression is modified by other means, which will set the
saved string to a NULL string in which case QgsExpression::expression()
will be forwarded to QgsExpression::dump()

I would probably also go with the latter as I don't really like the
former. But I haven't thought much about the implications anyway...

On a related note - I am not sure how consistently do we use aliases
versus "raw" field names within the GUI. Once an alias is defined,
shouldn't the user always see just the alias instead of the real field
name? And what about internal representation - shall we always store
raw field name when storing reference to a field? (in memory or in a
file)

This leads me to a thought that in theory an expression could always
contain just raw field names, but when the expression is shown/edited
in GUI, the user would see the alias instead... (just an idea)

Cheers

Right... When I initially designed QgsExpression, the idea was to have
expression() return always the original expressions (no modifications
were allowed) and dump() was just for debugging without the purpose to
return a valid expression. With time dump() however got updated to a
state when it returned correct expression - and things got more
complicated :)

This logic makes sense to me. For the third item I would just suggest
that any modification would immediately regenerate the saved
expression string using dump() - so there would be no forwarding from
expression() to dump().

Or created on first request and then buffered for subsequent use. This
might save some CPU cycles and memory once in a while :-)

Indeed - it would be really nice if we could hook QGIS plugins
repository into pip, so resolving dependencies and installation of
plugins with their dependencies would be done by pip - instead of our
own reinvented dependency logic.

Hi all,

The recent discussion around memory layers in another thread has started me
thinking about the best way to expose them more readily to users.

As such, I've opened a pull request which ports Borys Jurgiel's "New Memory
Layer" plugin to core (PR #1591). Hopefully this can be merged for 2.6.
It's more or less a direct port - I've left it without the ability to
specify fields at creation time as I believe that field creation would
indicate that we are encouraging users to store real data in these layers,
which is something we should avoid.

What I'm thinking though is that we should rename "memory layers" within
the UI. The name suggests that they are remembered, and conveys more of a
permanent feel.

I think that for 2.6 we could rename them to "temporary scratch layers",
and then for >2.6 (after we port the memory layer saving plugin/decide on a
suitable format for saving them) drop the " temporary" part of this name.
So they'll be just "scratch layers".

Thoughts?

Cool - from time to time it is handy to make a memory layer for some
temporary data and having to use a plugin / python console for the
creation is suboptimal...

I like the name "scratch layer" - and I wouldn't mind having it from
2.6 even without the "temporary" part although there is no saving for
it. (Saving is still a bit controversial for me as we would
inadvertently create another vector file format - unless we would ask
user to save the layer data into one of OGR supported formats or
spatialite DB.)

Regarding the saving aspect of it, IMO it needs to be worked out. I've had
a couple of users over here already reporting "data loss" with the
following scenario:
1. Open his/her project
2. Copies one polygon from a large dataset and pastes is as a new memory
layer (very useful feature introduced in QGIS 2.x)
3. Styles the memory layer, and saves the project
4. The next day, when he/she re-opens the project, the polygon is gone

Throughout the above mentioned workflow, there was never _any_ indication
that the pasted memory layer would not be saved when saving the project.

If QGIS further ease access to memory layers via incorporating the new
memory layer function into the core (which I hope its done :) ), and decide
against saving across project session, then there must be a UX to deal with
that, instead of silently killing the data of the memory layer(s). One way
forward would be to have a warning upon closing a project that has
non-saveable memory layers to warn the users. That warning should offer for
users to save the memory layers onto a proper format (possibly like the
missing layer dialog, with a list of all the memory layers and an input to
add the saved file location/name).

I would be in favor of a warning when first create a memory layer. The 
warning would say you can't save them except from using a plugin. And, 
there would be a checkbox "do not display this warning anymore".

Hi Ramon,

Thanks for having a look. I downloaded a trial of MI yesterday but

Hi all,

I'll try to summarize.

*QEP*: I don't mind doing one, but I think it's a bit early since we are 
still discussing.

*Problematic*: Drag'n'drop map tools prevent from enhancing CAD tools in 
QGIS. For this, it is *required *to add click-click to all map tools.

*Other softwares:*
CAD softwares use click-click actions while design and GIS (Mapinfo, 
what about ESRI?) use drag'n'drop.
New users or even current users might be afraid of such a change.

*Pros of methods:*
Advantages of click-clik:
* allow other actions to be done in the movement
* allow cancelling the action (this was not pointed out yet)
Advantages of drag'n'drop
* More intuitive (for non-CAD users, which I believe is the majority)

I see *3 (and a half) solutions* (thanks to Matthias for pointing some):

1.*Replace current* drag'n'drop to click-click
+ simplest solution to maintain
- need time for new users to get used to this

2.*Enable both* click-clik and drag'n'drop: a short click will free the 
node/feature while a long click (*) will allow drag'n'drop.
+ both solutions are here
- might be confusing for a "standard" user to make a short click and 
have a node moving without knowing what to do (although escape would 
cancel the thing)

3. Provide both behaviours and *choose which one to use in options* 
(e.g. enable CAD behaviour for map tools).
+ both solutions are here
- behaviour not coherent along the different installations

half solution: click-click in map tools, allow drag'n'drop in the main 
identify tool. Like *Microstation*.
- this works only for move features (i.e. not feasible for rotate and 
node tools)

Please comment these solutions, to see if there's a consensus.
I'll start and vote for 1. ;)


Cheers,
Denis


* The determination of what should be done is made on the distance in 
pixels from the press position to the release position. If it's small it 
is considered as a short. Time might also get into consideration: if you 
long-click but don't move it could be considered as cancel.

Thoughts:
- I don't think warning should be occurring when creating a memory layer
(that is when pasting as new layer, when adding the result of a processing
algorithm as memory layer, or creating a blank memory layer)
- I don't think the user should be able to disable the warning message
(which imo should be a dialog with saving shortcuts), the resulting data
loss is too critical; it's like opening a project with missing layers, qgis
doesn't (and shouldn't) allow for this dialog to be skipped
- IMO best to have: a/ a message bar when saving project while in an
ongoing session, and a missing layer-like warning dialog when closing
project

 modify behaviour of press-pan-release tools

Hey Denis,

There is a 4th option of course and that is a key modifier for override to
do click-click.  I was planning on doing that a while ago when I thought
about the same thing.

So adding something like shift+click to enabled click-click mode.

Not sure if that is better but there is not a good way to change this kind
of thing.

What about a icon in the legend to note that it it's not going to be saved?

I like that idea - I'd imagine if memory/scratch layers always displayed
the RAM icon in the legend and not the layer symbol then it would be a
permanent reminder to the user that they are a different type of layer...

Or we use the modifier for the drag'n'drop, if people like to keep a 
button mouse pressed, they don't mind using one more key... just joking!

Modifiers are a pain when you use the tools a lot.

Anyway, if we do this, this can be combined with the options (solution 3)
Standard mode: simple click: drag'ndrop, shift: click-click
CAD mode: simple click: click-clcik, shift: drag'n'drop

Possibly although that'd clutter that space. Renaming Memory Layers to
Temporary Layers would also give a good clue.

That said, I must say I quite enjoy using the memory layer saver, I'd be
sad to see this function not making it into core.

Martin raised an important issue re format. What about saving memory layer
data as GeoJSON within the qgis project file? That's a solution that is
compatible with the project file's xml format.

Thoughts on that?

Not really- it could be handled in the same way as the editing icon is at
the moment. That doesn't take up any extra room as it replaces the style
swatch.

I think the issue is more with compatibility with other programs. That's
why a zip/archive style project file which stores memory layers in an
existing standard format (eg geojson) was suggested.

Personally I like the memory layer and use it frequently.

The icon idea sounds good to me. Ideally it could be a RAM icon combined
with the type of geometry (Point, Line, Polygon).

I also like the idea of having the memory layer as a core feature - but
then there should be a user-friendly way to copy/inherit attribute
columns from an already existing layer.

For the long run it would be very useful being able to save the memory
layer to any OGR format. Apparently it is already possible to load a
memory layer to the databases supported by the DB manager (Postgis,
SpatiaLite).

I think the memory layer would be very well suited for certain analysis
tasks where users don't want to fuss around with Shapefiles. They want
to test something and only if the result is satisfying they would save
the result.

I would also envisage the Processing framework to make use of the memory
layer for certain tasks.

I guess the main issue with replacing the style swatch is we loose that for
a ram icon that will be there all the time so you can't see the style set
on the layer.

Personally I do prefer the name Temporary rather then Memory.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] standardisation of the editing map tools:
 modify behaviour of press-pan-release tools
In-Reply-To: <5423AC44.5020706@gmail.com>

Hi,

I think we should be open-minded towards Denis ideas and not
categorically reject any changes in curent behaviour. Enabling the CAD
mode enables a lot of possibilities compared to the current mode.

I am not a CAD expert either, but I am often impressed about how
efficiently my Autocad colleagues can edit/construct data.

Therefore I would support the option to switch between Graphics/CAD
mode. There could even be a button in the editing toolbar switching
between the two modes, though I would expect that people would like to
stay in one mode most of the time, once they get used to either mode.

>From Denis proposals listed below I would prefer option 3 (Provide both
behaviours and choose which one to use in options). The above suggested
switch mode button or a modifier key could be added as well, though I
see it as convenience and not absolutely necessary at the start.

As a name, I like "Scratch layer" or "Temporary layer". I see that
people can confuse "Memory" with "permant storage".

Nyall, I don't think there's a compatibility issue with memory layers.
Those are by their nature QGIS-dependant data, the same way ArcGIS can't
simply open a .qgs project file, a .qml layer properties file, etc.

One of the nice "feature" of memory layers (and its sister plugin memory
layer saver) is the fact that they are embedded within .qgs project files.
It should stay that way (which using GeoJSON within the XML structure of an
.qgs file would do). Transforming the .qgs project file into a zip
container would probably be a huge project driven by greater needs than
memory layers :)

Re Temporary Layers, I find it slightly better than Scratch Layer for non
native English speakers (i.e. more to the point in "simple" English :) ).

Hi,

It would be wonderful if someone could work on preserving formatting and
add comment support for the expressions in the QGIS 2.7 dev phase.

I can try and help to find some funding, if a dev is interested in
implementing this and can provide a quote.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] processing translation
Message-ID: <5423BC99.1060706@camptocamp.com>


What about to translate the processing plugin ?

There is no doubt that processing is more powerfull/modular than the old 
ftools, but users who don't speek english find that the processing 
module and its toolbox is less accessible than former fTools menu.

Content to translate will be :
     - the names, groups
     - add a description property (with some illustrations would be the 
best) shown in an new information panel on node selection.

What do you think about this ?

What happens when we port the memory layer saver to core though? Temporary
layers are no longer temporary ;) we need a name which indicates that they
should not be used for important data, but ultimately they will be
permanent layers...

Hi,

Please excuse my ignorance, but

Why would you want a memory (as in RAM) layer when you want permanent data?

For portability reasons?
That's fine, but then we should offer a possibility to support 
portability support for a real geo-format (with spatial index and all 
the goodies). To stuff it into the project file there can be support 
from a plugin, but I would not vote for adding this to core.

To me it seems that the current demand for this comes mainly from wrong 
expectations created by the name (and people subsequently loosing data). 
And we can fix the name.
For the portability issue, I'd rather go the longer way but get it right.

Regards
Matthias

I agree.
It seem me a silly question.

If an user choose a memory layer it know that is a memory layer
:)
So it is not a permanent dataset.

I like the memory layer because they as really useful for temporary
elaborations and quickly tests.

lso another question is.
If an user choose the memory layer it crunch the ram resources.
And after it begin to ask for more resources because its million
records daataset is not well used with the memory layer.

However if like to put a memory layer persistent.

Why dont return to old question.
Change the project save from XML to a spatialite ?
Storing the project in a spatialite will allow easily to host also in
the spatialte the datasets if this is the like of the qgis community.
Also the spatialite start to support also the raster with rasterlite extension.
So tomorrow you should do also a memory raster layer.

Regards,

Andrea.

Hi,

this topic already was discussed recently, see this thread
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Processing-i18n-support-td5155677.html

In short, Processing has i18n support, but some code parts still miss it. We
are working on this, but patches are welcome.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] standardisation of the editing map tools:
 modify behaviour of press-pan-release tools

+1 for option 3) but leave the current behaviour as default, maybe set 
behaviour automatically when loading/enabling CAD tools?
Reason: I assume that the majority of users does just simple digitizing 
and won't use CAD tools.
As for the disadvantage you mention (behaviour not coherent): _all_ 
configurable behaviour maybe not coherent
As for Andreas' proposal: It might be handy to change with an extra 
button but on the other hand: You won't change it all the time during an 
editing session but as soon as you get used to one behaviour you will 
leave it as it is. So -1 because no extra button needed.

as for option 4): key modifier. I can imagine it driving me cracy when 
forgetting to press <ctrl> and the tool behaves not as expected. What 
would be nice is to have a default setting (option 3) and make it work 
just the other way when pressing an extra key so pressing the key 
overrides the default behaviour (not sure if this would be used much, 
though)

+1, saving should NOT be reported as a success w/out the user being made
aware of the issue and asked for action (discard/save_as_format).

Hey all,

I think the best course of action here is to hold off until after 2.6 so we
can review this thing as a whole solution rather then rushing it in last
minute and then moving the target later.

IMO we could in the future use sqlite in memory datastore for the memory
provider which gives us a lot more options and range.

Changing the format of the project file to something that isn't xml is a
interesting idea however it's not something that should be rushed into
without consideration so I think that is a very different topic.

I like the icon idea, but would still additionally have a warning
at save time.

I see those "temporary" layers like "drafts". That is, something you do
not want to loose but is not either fully existent on its final form.

You'd have to save them to have a final product (that can be shared),
but you should not be loosing them (why would you ?).

In order to avoid keeping such "draft layers" "dangling", the user
should be asked what to do whenever they are removed from a project.
They could be "discarded" or "saved_as_permanent".

Just my 2c of UX :)

How to verify if the signal ? feature added ? is emitted from an add feature
tool?

Objet : [Qgis-developer] crash with undo command

 

Hi,

 

I have a plugin that allows to change an attribute value of added feature to
the selected value of a combo-box.

I change the attribute when the signal ?featureAdded? is emmited (ie. Before
the endEditCommand of ?add feature? is called) so in this undo command we
have in the order:

1-  QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandAddFeature

2-      QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandChangeAttribute

 

If we undo ?add feature? command it must call undo() on all child commands
in reverse order, but when I debug in QGIS it do it in the order not in
reverse order ie. It call:

1-  QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandAddFeature::undo()

2-      QgsVectorLayerUndoCommandChangeAttribute::undo()

 

That?s why Qgis crash when I undo ?add feature? command

An explanation for this?

 

Is there any way to knew if the signal ?feature added? is emitted when a new
feature is added not from commitChanges(), redoEditCommand() and
undoEditCommand()?

 

Thank you

Nejia

Aren't there two different possibilities in which such layers can be used:

  * As a scratch layer for the user, which he may want to save in the end
  * As a means for plugins to show information to the user

In the first scenario, the user may actually want to save the 
information because he realized in the process of drawing it, that it's 
valuable to him (if he would have known from the beginning, he could 
have started with a permanent layer type). In this case it would be nice 
to make the user aware of the risk of loosing data and offer him a 
simple way to save it (to an OGR supported format).

In the second scenario, the information may be completely reproducible 
by the plugin or the information drawn by the user intercepted by the 
plugin and redirected to suitable places. In such a scenario a "Do you 
want to permanently save?" dialog would not be appropriate. And 
therefore there should be a possibility to disable it.

On the other hand, I also tend to use my /tmp folder on my machine for 
data I use to play around for the next couple of minutes but that I am 
completely aware of that it can be lost anytime (and I don't want my 
computer to ask me: "Hey, you have saved that download to /tmp and I'm 
going to delete it now, is that ok for you?"). So I tend to disagree 
with Sandros "why would you want to loose the data?" and answer it with 
"because it's intermediate, volatile and/or temporary."

All in all: there are two scenarios, one with manual operation, one with 
plugins. The second one needs to be controlled by python, the first one 
is about awareness. This awareness can be achieved by one or more of the 
following

  * Icons
  * Message bar (e.g. when starting to digitize "You are digitizing on a 
temporary layer. Do you want to convert it to a permanent layer? Click 
here.")
  * Message box when removing the layer from the canvas/closing the app 
"There is unsaved information, you will loose it unless you donate 5$ to 
the QGIS project. Click here"

Or did I get this wrong?

I found a way to do this programmatically. The two functions above do
not work, so to fix it I have to do in this way:

# The composer window (you have to find the right composerView object
from iface.activeComposers() )
composer = composerView.composerWindow()

# Find the Command History Dock from ccomposer main Window
commandDock = composer.findChildren ( QDockWidget, "CommandDock" )[0]

# Find the QUndoView widget
undoView = commandDock.findChildren ( QUndoView )[0]

# Select the first element in command history (with text <empty>)
index = undoView.model().index (0, 0)
undoView.setCurrentIndex ( index )

# Select the second (but this may vary) element (the map object)
index = undoView.model().index (1, 0)
undoView.setCurrentIndex ( index )


TA-DAH! Now it shows the item properties of the MAP!!!!

What about composition.setSelectedItem( composerMap  ) ? That should work...

About the python dependencies, I propose to share a list of dependencies of
the plugin, where everyone can add and propose those necessary to its
plugin.

This list could then be taken into consideration during the release of the
new version of QGIS, which may already contain them.

For example, I (will) need of :

qtreactor
twisted
zope


It is impossible to add them to QGIS ?

Roberto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS hackfest Linuxhotel News
Message-ID: <20140925161715.50ee0009@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

I have some not so good news for all who arrive on wednesday and before
thursday late afternoon. I was just informed by the linuxhotel, that
they will have another big event on thursday, 2nd october. They have given
priority to this event, because that's what they make money with (we only
pay a very reduced price).

For us it means, we only have one smaller room (maybe for 15 people)
available on thursday until maybe 7pm and all others have to split up to
several other rooms in the linuxhotel.

We will find a solution anyway, there is internet everywhere, but I wanted
to inform you, so you are not disappointed, if we are not able to work all
together in one room until thursday evening.

Whish you all a save journey to Essen!

Regards
Otto

I agree---I have a plugin that uses memory layers to display information
abstracted from a database (with no QGIS data provider). This
functionality is essential and should not be changed, rather additional
features added to support interactive use through the UI.

Since Processing has been mentioned a couple of times in the thread, just
some clarification:

- Processing can create memory layers, but only for native algorithms (that
is, not from SAGA, GRASS, etc). The option is available in the button aside
the text box where the destination path is entered
- All Processing layers are temporary, unless a path is entered, and they
are saved to a temp folder which is cleaned when the user closes QGIS
- There are warnings in the Processing documentation about not creating a
project with temp layers and to always enter a path if the layer is not an
intermediate result. Otherwise it will be lost. I think that i can improve
that and add a warning to pop up when the project is saved if it includes
temp layers, capturing the corresponding signal and checking that there are
no layers that are saved in the Processing temp path. Would that be too
intrusive?

Hope this helps

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [FEATURE][QGIS-Server] Legend filtering based on
 map in GetPrint Request
Message-ID: <54253E0B.9020305@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Code freeze starts today and I have a new feature for QGIS-Server to be 
reviewed.
I opened a pull-request and assigned it to @mhugent but if someone else 
like @wonder-sk can validate it, I'll merge it.

This pull-request has be made for Legend filtering based on map in 
GetPrint Request

The legend in composition was fixed and did not represent the layers in 
the map.
With the work made by @wonder-sk <https://github.com/wonder-sk> on 
layer-tree and QgsComposerLegend users will be able
to configure composer legend as based on all the project layer tree with 
auto-update
model or filtered by map.
This commit reused these two QgsComposerLegend's properties to filter it 
based on map in
GetPrint Request

The issue #4003 qgis_mapserver getPrint legend options can be closed.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc D'Hont

Hello,

PyQGIS question:
I just want to get EPSG code set at project level when on-the-fly reprojection is active.
I suppose it should be available in destinationCrs() properties from mapRenderer, but nothing found.

Any idea?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xmA4tWdrgY7efGLcaTYDZN6mS5Riw-mpwx-o1afCiRDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Every time a GRASS alorithm is run the following log appears:

processing.runalg("grass:v.voronoi","C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/./python/plugins\\processing\\tests\\data\\points.shp",False,False,"270778.60198,270855.745301,4458921.97814,4458983.8488",-1,0.0001,0,None)

I suppose it depends on the test at line
https://github.com/giohappy/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/GrassUtils.py#L371

It's run every time an algorithm's dialog is opened:
https://github.com/giohappy/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass/GrassAlgorithm.py#L491

If a different strategy to test GRASS cannot be found we could at least
disable the test from being logged because it's definetly counterintuitive
for a user to understand why it's there. Initially I thought it was a bug
or an error during the executions of my algorithms...

It should works, but...
I'm working with 2.2 API and mapSettings doesn't exist for this release.
I should have to migrate my devs (for other reasons ;-)

Then iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs() should do the job, no?

Hugo is currently writing a QEP to exactly do that and as well address some 
issues regarding database features re-implementation.
He should publish it for review sooner or later.

This could help handle the memory layer topic, but actually is a wider issue.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [ANNOUNCE] 2.5 feature freeze begun
Message-ID: <20140926122631.GA19527@norbit.de>

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.5 development cycle ended at 12:00
UTC. We are now in feature freeze on the road to the 2.6 release on 2014-10-24
http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20141024T12&year=2014&month=10&day=24&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&msg=2.6%20Release
(almost 27 days away; see also roadmap
<http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html>).

Now *we*, *the community*, need to prepare QGIS for release. No new features
will be added anymore. *Users*, if not already begun, should now start
extensive testing of master and report bugs on the hub <http://hub.qgis.org>.
*Developers* should move their focus from creating new features to fixing bugs.
*Translators* can can continue their work.

The nightly builds of QGIS testing available for Windows
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#windows>, Linux (Debian
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#id3> and Ubuntu
<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-testing>) and Mac
OS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#id13> are now
effectively snapshots of what's going to be released.  Except of course for the
bugs that are going to be fixed until release day.  For Windows there will also
be weekly release candidates of the standalone installer
<http://www.qgis.org/downloads/weekly/>.

Lets keep up working together to make 2.6 another great release.

Yes, I missunderstood  postgisSrid<http://qgis.org/api/2.2/classQgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.html#a3cb64f24049d50fbacffd1eece5125ee> () method which in fact return EPSG code (not sure of that but in my case postgissrid and EPSG code are equal...)

Then iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer().destinationCrs() should do the job, no?

It should works, but...
I'm working with 2.2 API and mapSettings doesn't exist for this release.
I should have to migrate my devs (for other reasons ;-)

Hello,

PyQGIS question:
I just want to get EPSG code set at project level when on-the-fly reprojection is active.
I suppose it should be available in destinationCrs() properties from mapRenderer, but nothing found.

Any idea?

Thanks

Sylvain

Subject: [Qgis-developer] standardisation of the editing map tools:
 modify behaviour of press-pan-release tools
In-Reply-To: <5423BAF8.40908@carto.net>

Hello,

Thanks Denis for the initiative ;)

If we are to provide both behaviours, I'm strongly in favour of a user
preference rather than the modifier key. At some point, we'll want to use
modifier keys for other uses (lock orthogonal move, alternate tool mode,
etc.), and this will get very confusing.

To me, the reasons to implement a click-move-click behaviour becomes
evident when you have to edit a lot of features. It's much more effort to
achieve precision while holding the button (tension in the hand), you must
be a finger acrobat to pan/zoom while editing, and you can't answer the
phone neither ;)

Still, I'd suggest once the click-move-click feature is developed, all of
us try it for one week or so, and only then we decide whether we want to
provide both modes or not.


While on the topic of map tools, I was thinking of the following
improvements to the QgsMapTool class:

*1. Implement snapping directly in the QgsMapTool class rather than in each
subclass*
>From what I understand of the source, currently, more or less every
subclass of QgsMapTools provides it's own logic for snapping (or more
generally: for conversion from pixel coordinates click to map coordinates
click). In this context, I don't see how we can achieve cleanly a
cross-tool numerical input system.

*2. Implement pre-click highlighting of features/nodes/edges/rings/...
(depending on what the current tool accepts)*
This type of visual feedback will make editing much more intuitive. Take
the "move node" tool. It's only by mistake that user can learn that it also
acts on edges. Take the move tool : when two features overlap, you have no
idea on which feature you'll act. Etc. This could also be done directly in
QgsMapTool, so that we are sure it's consistent across tools.

Think at how easy it would then be to develop other map tools : almost only
the tool logic, and no boilerplate code at all. What do you think ?


Best regards,

Olivier

Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhsHUvOgNaq2Bf3akNUGc71MG+0Jb8LS8a+t=x_csS8Gjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I noticed that using  the    .render()    function  with  pyQgis > 2.2
the labels are not  visible.

This is my test source code :


                iface = qgis.utils.iface

                mapRenderer = mapCanvas.mapRenderer()
                mapRect = mapRenderer.extent()
                width = mapRenderer.width()
                height = mapRenderer.height()
                srs = mapRenderer.destinationCrs()

                # create output image and initialize it
                image = QImage(QSize(width, height), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
                image.fill(0)

                #adjust map canvas (renderer) to the image size and render
                imagePainter = QPainter(image)

                zoom = 1
                target_dpi = int(round(zoom * mapRenderer.outputDpi()))


                mapRenderer.setOutputSize(QSize(width, height), target_dpi)

                mapRenderer.render(imagePainter)
                imagePainter.end()

                xN = mapRect.xMinimum()
                yN = mapRect.yMinimum()

                nomePNG = ("TestImage")

                input_file = out_folder + "/" + nomePNG + ".png"

                image.save(input_file, "png")


Somebody can test it and confirm ?    Perhaps ,  it was introduced some
other parameter for the labels ,  from 2.4 version ?


Thank you in advance

Roberto

Hi All,

I like the idea of a switch between Graphic and CAD mode.  How about
putting a toggle button near the Render checkbox.  Then all users will know
which mode they are in.

Hi

I think this depends a bit upon your perception of the world.  As a developer you are aware that this is a memory layer, and so volatile by nature.

On the other hand as a user this is not necessarily a memory layer, it is just part of your project, and may have come from some plugin or process that didn't explicitly mention "memory layer".  So they expect their data to be saved when they close the project.

I don't think anyone could question whether or not QGIS should warn you if you are going to lose data.  It shouldn't casually discard information you have worked on.

So the only question in my mind is whether or not it can save the memory data without requiring you to save it to some GIS format.  I think the answer is that it should (but then I'm biased - I wrote the MemoryLayerSaver plugin to address this issue for myself).

Again from a user point of view I think this data is part of the project, so it makes sense to save it with the project.  It isn't necessarily something that is wanted for anything else.  So why would they be bothered with having to choose a format and file location to do so.

Secondly there is convenience.  Sometimes you just want to be able to save the project and switch to some other work without having to worry about all sorts of "are you sure" or deciding where to save bits that you thought were part of the project.

The MemoryLayerSaver plugin at the moment saves to a QDataStream - a completely unconventional format chosen for convenience as it minimizes the risks of altering data by moving to another format.  I think SQLite would be cleaner.  However the main point of the memory layer is that it isn't used by anything else ... so I don't see this as a big drawback compared to the advantages of having the layers saved.

Cheers
Chrsi

Hi,

Please excuse my ignorance, but

Why would you want a memory (as in RAM) layer when you want permanent data?

For portability reasons?
That's fine, but then we should offer a possibility to support
portability support for a real geo-format (with spatial index and all
the goodies). To stuff it into the project file there can be support
from a plugin, but I would not vote for adding this to core.

To me it seems that the current demand for this comes mainly from wrong
expectations created by the name (and people subsequently loosing data).
And we can fix the name.
For the portability issue, I'd rather go the longer way but get it right.

Regards
Matthias

I also would vote for option 3.  I do quite a bit of digitising/editing in
QGIS.  I am used to the default behaviour though there are times i wish for
the editing tools to act as Denis has proposed.  I think it makes sense for
QGIS' default behaviour to be consistent for people coming from other GIS
software. In my mind QGIS is foremost a GIS and should behave as such.  So
i don't think 1 is a good option.  also, 2 sees like it could be
confusing/frustrating.  I don't think its a matter of being afraid of
change but rather of being consistent with the behaviour of other GIS
software.  That being said there are times that i would appreciate having
the editing behaviour Denis is suggesting and would be very interested in
being able to choose.

I like the options of setting a preference for either GIS like operation or
CAD like operation. This does however tie into a larger issue of
configuration flexibility in QGIS.

I use QGIS when I teach GIS and new users are often overwhelmed by rows and
rows of tool bars. By default we can only set those one at a time soI wrote
the MyConfigs plugin so I could set a certain set of tools visible for when
I'm doing digitizing and a different configurations for different tasks.
Unfortunately to disable menus requires a reboot of the system. In my ideal
world the plugin I wrote would be made obsolete by the ability to define
task configurations of tool bars, menus and perhaps even tool behaviour.
This type of flexibility would be useful for teaching but also in day to
day use by keeping what you need close at hand and behaving as needed and
hiding the other stuff that can sometimes get in the way.

I think such a warning is necessary but can be limited to layers visible 
to the end user. A layer automatically made by a plugin or another 
feature would normally not be visible in the legend tree, no ?

For example, I am working on a renderer that would create a memory layer 
alongside the original layer for more advanced rendering, but hidden to 
the end user. It does not really have to be saved with the project as it 
can be regenerated, but I sure would not want a dialog popping up to ask 
whether to save a layer that the user does not know exist.

One of the main reason memory layers are used by plugins is that you 
can't write a python provider. If you want to handle a proprietary 
format or a weird format, you read the file and fill a memory layer.

This is the difference between memory layers and others: no provider, 
data is manually pasted or created by plugin. If saving is required for 
project consistency, maybe this could be done through geojson (or other) 
provider. One attribute in the qgs project would indicate that it is a 
memory layer, and that's keep quite simple and transparent.

Hi all.
With current master, these plugins are broken:

The plugin is broken. Python said:
No module named outputs.OutputVector

* Animove

The plugin is broken. Python said:
No module named parameters.ParameterVector

Should I open tickets?

I am not sure exactly what you mean, the snapping is mostly done by a 
QgsMapCanvasSnapper object, by calling snapToBackgroundLayers that will 
take a point and return snapping results. I am not sure numerical input 
system is linked to snapping as when you enter a numerical value for a 
position, you expect to go exactly to this position, not snap the value 
to a nearby node.

Pre-click highlighting would require rubberband display on onMouseMove 
events, right ? I tried something similar when I modified the remove 
part tool, it had awful performance.

Now that I think of it, I saw a trick for webdev where they use timers 
to limit the number of mouse move events fired, it may be worth a try.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Visual changelog for 2.6
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash9v8X+FjTaUtZqeeREO7vPjZkZOT++-ZWg_EG-rbmUVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just trawled through the git commit log and copied all the new
features I could find to the visual changelog for 2.6. I've done it
very roughly, mostly just bullet points (that's all I've got time for
at the moment), so it would be appreciated if someone could flesh out
these entries and add screenshots, etc.

Some notes:
- Sorry if I've missed any features - it's kind of hard to tell from a
commit sometimes exactly what was added/changed
- I've left off all processing related commits as there was just too
many of them to check through. Hopefully someone more familiar with
processing can add these.
- I ran into a bug with the changelog site were there's a fixed limit
to the number of "pending" entries shown. So I had to approve a bunch
of unfinished entries to be able to properly edit these missing
pending entries. Sorry if this makes things harder to review, I had no
choice...

The new features list is HUGE. Nice work everyone :)

For Processing, I would say that the most relevant change is the new
modeler, which has been completely rewritten. Not something that the user
might really notice (although there are some visual changes and new
features), but it's a big change, and I guess it's good to let people now
that it's a new modeler, in case there are things that are broken or don't
work, so they report them.

Let me know if you want me to write a more detailed description, create
screenshots or whatever

Hi Victor,

I think a change big like that absolutely justifies an entry. Visual 
changelog is probably not meant as "visible changes" but "visually 
enhanced changelog".
It would be great if you could write a couple of lines about the main 
enhancements and the reasons for this change.

Thanks alot
Matthias

I wonder if it wouldn't be interesting to work directly on the mouse 
pointer position for the snapping. That would allow handling this at a 
higher level than the map tools.

Regarding transformation of coordinates, I suppose you speak of being 
able to trigger the event from the code using pixel coordinates or using 
map coordinates ?
This sounds like a good idea for me to add these methods maybe at the 
QgsMapToolEdit level.

As Leyan pointed out you would get very bad performance. Although, we 
are discussing with Martin about having a cache of all currently 
rendered features. This would allow much better performance for 
snapping, and for the proposed idea of highlighting.

Hi Nyall,

 From what I see, it misses two features:

* Enhanced identify menu with single feature selection and the 
possibility of triggering feature actions directly

* Relations: possibility of selecting related features on the map

I can make some pictures for this.

Best wishes

Denis

Hi,

Doing some test on 2.5.
I'm a little bit surprised by rendering mode between 2.5 and 2.4. Is there any change?
First QGIS 2.5 is slower than 2.4 with same data. And rendering mode looks  like an impressionist  painter drawing randomly small area on canvas for vector and draw pixels for raster, both before full rendering  correctly done...

Os is Win7

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EDX_3zE28YT-0hJj6Az7y+q23OJTmQ_hO4SfxZf0ZgTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to open an attribute dialog for a temporary feature
using QgsAttributeDialog(). but with no luck. Can anyone point me to
working example?
I'm trying something like this:


> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
> layer = mc.currentLayer()
> dialog = QgsAttributeDialog(layer, temp_feature)
> dialog.show()


that gives me the following error on the 3rd line:

NameError: name 'QgsAttributeDialog' is not defined


Thanks,

Alexandre

I think you should to import the class before and setting the feature
owner bool parameter.
after this changes the snippet should work fine for you!

See attached screen shots. It takes 15 seconds to render all the area.
With 2.2 or 2.4 release there?s no step like this during rendering an it takes 5 seconds for same area / same data?

Hi, there is a small change in simplification code to fix the bug #10767 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10767):

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/eaacb125c402cf22dd66482b313bdaef73791fea


Can you test QGIS before this commit ?

Best regards
Alvaro

I want to use the pg service file to define postgis connection

I've set the PGSERVICEFILE environment variable to my file path.

But when I try to connect with the service parameter from QGIS, he says 
that the file does'nt exist, with the exact path of the existing file.

Hello Salvatore,

You were right, I just needed to import the class first, this have opened
the form for me:

from qgis.gui import QgsAttributeDialog
> mc = iface.mapCanvas()
> layer = mc.currentLayer()
> temp_feature.setAttributes(attributes)
> dialog = QgsAttributeDialog(layer, temp_feature, True)
> dialog.show()


But now I can't make it editable.

All I can do is cancel the dialog.

Thanks for your help,

Alexandre Neto

Hi All

I'm finding that I often seem to miss messages from github which have been labelled @ccrook.  I'm wondering if this is just my issue, or whether others find this too?

Thanks
Chris

HI Arnaud, 
I had the same trouble, and all went clear when I saved the service file as

Hi, same here, I don't get exactly what's different with 2.4, and didn't
notice that during testing. Do we need special settings (On the fly
simplification, parallel rendering?)

I have no problems. Maybe you just need to enable the notifications in

is your layer editable? you need to call startEditing() method in
order to get the form in edit mode.

+1  for 3 with the current way as default.

I think there are already enough key modifiers that affect tools in QGIS, that the forth way probably isn't optimal; but a shortcut to toggle modes might be useful.

I do apologise if I did come across as close minded. It seems to me that as originally suggested (option 1) it's a very large change to the user's interaction with the program, even if it is a small change to make. It would need to be widely publicised and up the top of the release notes if it did happen. People that don't read much social media or blogs should be able to find out before they try to use the tools.

Wandering of topic a bit, I'm beginning to wonder if I partly reacted to "standardisation", which I read as let's change the standard that we use for that part of QGIS. Looking over what's been discussed, I could restate the topic as "Inconsistency in the editing map tools" - would that fit? 

If its the former than there's a larger question that probably needs opening up in another thread, given that there are other recent changes that were argued as, "this is the way Inkscape does it".

-ramon.

Hi Alexandre,

What you did is just the building of the form, you don't have all the 
stuff around to make editable/uneditable and update the layer.

If you want to open a feature form like doing it from QGIS, just run:

iface.openFeatureForm(layer, feature, false, true/false)

http://qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html#a11b90f38afd09ac5e9f363933ee4a509

Cheers,

Denis

Message-ID: <DD1DC388-8E19-49D0-ADCA-DE16C9B084D2@westnet.com.au>

Hi,

I've opened up a couple of new issues in the tracker regarding the Print Composer in Master. 

The Print Composer is currently ignoring the page orientation in my templates, with flow on effects. 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11292

The Print Composer is showing all layers in the legend - even the layers not visible on the map (which is a regression). 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/11293

Actually this how my plugin worked back in QGIS 2.2. But in the latest
versions the iface.openFeatureForm() is always in add mode (like
setIsAddDialog
<http://qgis.org/api/classQgsAttributeDialog.html#a2fbbff1c23be058caa26cc5aaf7040e8>).
That is, after accepting the dialog, it adds a new feature, and does not
update my temporary feature. This leaves no room for any changes before the
feature commit. I described my problem in the following bug report, and
Matthias Kuhn adviced me to create my own Dialog, so that's what I'm trying
to do. I would be glad to use iface.openFeatureForm() only

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11099

Thanks for your help

Alexandre

In my case, parallel rendering is on

 It takes 15 seconds to render an area.
With 2.2 or 2.4 release there?s no step like this during rendering an it takes 5 seconds for same area / same data?

Ramon,

I've removed this issue as it's a duplicate of #11255. I'm after some
more details on this one though - are you able to confirm the steps
you do to make the new composition from a template? Specifically, are
you creating a blank composition and using the "Add items from
template" command, or using the composer manager to create new
composition based off a template?

Ah. A hidden change. 

I'm following my established work flow.  Blank, then the toolbar folder icon, which now tells me it's "Load items from Template", except that because this is what I've always done, I didn't hang around long enough to see. 

It's the same icon in the same place as the icon in 2.4 which identifies itself as "Load from Template".
I expected it to behave the same way on both versions. 

I see that if I go into the menu and choose New from template I get what I'm expecting. 

What's the difference between "add items from" and "new from" meant to be?

I'd prefer New from Template to be on the toolbar than add items, so I'm now curious about the change?
Is it possible to get back?

At the same time I see that the change means that now the icons map correctly between the toolbar and the menu, and that the new from template icon can't be on the toolbar without confusion.

-ramon.

Hi Ramon,

The difference is:

"New from template" overrides everything (including your page settings) 
you had in your layout, and "Add items from template" leaves the page 
settings and already existing items in place and just adds additional 
items from a template.

I think that this distinction makes sense and is already clear enough 
for the average user. No need to change anything.

Andreas

I correct myself slightly: it may make sense to add "New from Template" 
to the toolbar, for those using the toolbar instead of the menu.

Ok, I also did not realize this change. This makes sense to me, but icons
do not seem very explicit. "New from template" icon is the same of "New
composer". And "Add items from template" has the same icon that in previous
versions were used to "Open" previously saved templates. So, it seems to me
that should change the icons in any way.

agreed - can you contribute better icons? I am sure that the devs would 
include that, if contributed.

Hi Andreas,

I can not create icons, I am the worst designer on Earth... But I created
some images with icons that I think can be more explicit, mixing some of
which already exist in QGIS. What do you think?

Hi,

I think the "Save as template" icon would be good. But personally I 
would rather use the "Open folder" icon for loading from template or the 
blank page icon. The loading has nothing to do with saving and thus I 
don't think the "Floppy disk" icon would be a good choice for loading a 
template or items from a template.

I agree though with the choice of the small icons (* for new and the 
arrow thingie for adding items).

That's not quite correct - "New from Template" does not alter any
existing compositions, it creates a brand new composition.

 yes, I agree. Perhaps the ideal would be to create a specific icon for
composer templates.

Hi Pedro,

Thanks - this looks better. Perhaps this should be further discussed at 
the QGIS-UX mailing list - which deals with such issues?

Hi Pedro,

Your mockups are looking good. One thing to keep in mind is that we
can't use letters like "T" in an icon, as they only have meaning for
English speaking users.

I'm happy to try tackling this task later in 2.6 freeze.

Hi,

I just installed a Debian Jessie on a virtual machine, and I get the same
warnings.
Any idea?

Cheers,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QEP: virtual layers
Message-ID: <542AA721.4090804@oslandia.com>

Hi all,

I've just sent a pull request on the QEP repository
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/pull/5

It is about "virtual layers" that would allow to expose any set of QGIS
layers as Spatialite tables and then create arbitrary SQL queries on them.

This is primarily seen as a way to add new possibilities for
non-database file formats (shapefiles, csv, etc.), but could also be
seen as a way to have a consistent way of dealing with database-oriented
features (especially joins) in the core.

I would be happy to have your feedback.

Unfortunately, it won't be possible for me to attend the Hackfest in
Essen, but I would try to be easily reachable to discuss this QEP if you
feel this would help during the HF (by mail, irc, video chat if needed).

Ah, so it's not quite like open template was then that's useful to know too.

If everyone agrees, tomorrow I'll see if I can do a mockup at least as good as Pedro's, and Lob a summary over to the UX list with the current ideas for their thoughts.

Hi,

I've been wondering if someone could add Robert's icon for delete selected
polygon to master so it can be included in the 2.6 release?

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9604

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Hey Anita,

I'm still not sure I really like that icon.  Personally I still think a
simple bin is a good sign for delete.  It is the delete icon on OS X,
Linux, and Windows, and most mobile apps.  Having a polygon and a cross
still feels like "unselect" to me.  Just a personal feeling.
