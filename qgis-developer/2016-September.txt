FYI, in master you can search for Processing scripts and models.

Guessing you are building master_2 or other 2.x branch you probably need:

libqca2-dev (the qt4 version) (the dev files will pull in the lib itself
too)
And if I recall correct you also need the plugins package:
libqca-qt5-2-plugins (but not 100% sure)

if you build master (qt5, QGIS3) you need libqca-qt5-2-dev (and myabe
the plugins

I think we should deprecate the current repo for scripts and using this new
one, to have everything in the same place

That requires two things:

1) make sure it the Resources Sharing plugin works fine for Processing
scripts :-)
2) Have the resources sharing plugin as a core plugin (otherwise,a plain
Processing would be less capable than now). Is this among our plans? I
think this is a plugin that should be core and part of QGIS, but I don't
know if there is already a discussion about this going on...

Cheers

Thanks all for your answers,
+1 for making this plugin core, and perhaps put it under the Extension menu
(just after the Install/manage extensions) ?

I would add
3) Verify that the new plugin can use scripts help files *.py.help
generated by Processing tool (I have not yet checked this)

Hi Richard

That did it, thanks a lot for your fast reply :)

For my own later reference, how do I determine which package I need? In this case QCA -> libqca2-dev?

I believe it should be in core!

As I'm going to improve the Plugin Manager [1], it may be a right time to 
refactor it and create an unified sharing platform. What do you think?

A big +1 from me. IMHO better to develop unified sharing platform and use
it for all kind of resources.

I also can't assign issues in the repo.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Folder repetition of SVG symbols
Message-ID: <f7408406-551b-1f73-0262-db230a9fe185@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a weird problem. I noticed that the SVG filling in the vector
styling took a lot to load the symbols (really a lot) causing sometimes
the crashing of QGIS.

So I discovered that I have the same App Symbol and User Symbols (empty)
folders repeated 5 many times. Same folder, same symbols, same path
(/usr/share/qgis/svg and /home/matteo/.qgis2/svg).

I never added new symbols (fresh QGIS master_2 compiled yesterday) on a
Ubuntu 16.04 machine.

Is this behavior normal or have I some strange configuration?

Thanks to all

Matteo

apt search qca

and some trial and error, or ask on IRC or mailing list :-)

in INSTALL in github there is also a line with needed packages, though
not alway 100% all:

Yep, I have seen this before... we even spoke about it in Bonn.. one of
the ideas was that this maybe was when you run multiple instances of
QGIS or install a new version while another is running or so??

mmm.. I don't think so. This time (so yesterday) I had a "old" version
of QGIS (the only one) and I completely remove it before compiling and
installing the new version.

ls /usr/share/qgis/svg/

puts out a list without folder duplication.

Can I do something?

Thanks a lot

Matteo

Hi, 

What I don't understand is why QGIS automatically adds such SVG folders
without asking the user? 

I can understand that the central SVG folder of the application is
automatically added by default - but why adding an SVG folder from the
users folder by default? In my opinion this is bad behaviour by QGIS.
Users should consciously add such settings and understand the
implications. 

In my case QGIS added C:/Users/username/.qgis2/svg 

I never asked QGIS to do that and I never intend so store SVG symbols
there. I add my symbols at folder locations where all of my local users
can share and benefit from each others contributions, typically, shared
resources. 

I also have the same issue that I usually have 3-5 parallel QGIS
installations on my Windows machine and I get the central folder of each
of them. Not very nice ... and it slows down QGIS. Shouldn't QGIS leave
settings as they are if the .qgis2 settings folder already exists?

Hi

Regarding this problem, I issued it here (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15439)
but I can't open Redmine right now (down?).  It's easily reproducible (I
included the steps to reproduce it there). I felt that it should be easy to
fix.

Before QGIS 2.16 those paths are already saved in this object
(mDefaultSvgPaths),
and are used already in other features (e.g the tree when selecting SVG for
setting SVG marker) it's just that in QGIS 2.16, those paths are added in
the dialog in Option in SVG Path. I am not sure the reason behind that but
perhaps it's for explicitness (?)

Hi,

+1

But note that I am not proud of the current testing module of the plugin. I
haven't really created meaningful tests there (involving testing all kind
of repository and such) and I am not sure that some libraries (particularly
dulwich) is Python 3 ready. But if everyone says yes, I'll do what I can
help.

Cheers

Cześć Borys

I just opened the ticket and for point 1 and 2 we could totally reuse some
of my code. I already told Tim that we could definitely put a plugin as a
collection and when users install that collection, we moved it to the right
plugin directory.

I believe it should be in core!

Don't worry, it's a great more-than-prototype! We'll test it and polish once 
you'll back from your holiday! ;p

It may sound weird as need, but I'm trying to use the aggregate functions
to build a diagram in QGIS and it returns nothing. Even a simple
count("myfield") seems to return zero.

Thanks for any hint.

Hi Anita,
sorry for the late reply, busy times, and I knew the response would be long.

The update is ... complicated :-)
So, around the sprint a few issues were fixed and have code merged in
master (QGis 3.x):

   - Export of ogc:Filter in places where an expression is required, used
   to happen for any non zero rotation and any non fully opaque alpha, making
   the SLD invalid/unreadable. Pull request here, merged on master:
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3366
   - The styling works by default in "on screen mm", but SLD does not have
   such notion (has on screen pixel, on ground meter, on ground feet), and
   QGis did not rescale the values, making for very thin lines and tiny
   symbols. Fixed in this pull request, merged on master:
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3414
   - Scale based visibility declared at the layer level was not exported in
   SLD, making for layers that would show up at all zoom levels. Pull request
   here, merged as well: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3436
   - GeoServer/GeoTools could not handle the way font based marks were
   exported. The syntax was actually valid, so I decided to build support for
   QGis own convention in GeoTools. This is the only bit already available in
   all supported GT/GS branches (develop, stable, maintenance):
   https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOT-5496
   - QGis exports as "well known mark" names values that are not actually
   "well known", this one in being solved in GeoTools/GeoServer by adding
   support for the same names. Pull request pending, still haven't had the
   time to check it out: https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/1288
   - Labels are not exported at all as TextSymbolizer, during the
   spring Raymond Nijssen started working on that, he's got a promising work
   in progress, not yet turned into a pull request

Kudos to the QGis developers that helped me with discussion, suggestions,
and pull request reviews :-)

Yet, there is still quite a lot of work to be done. Off the top of my head:

   - Backporting some/all of the above to QGis 2.16 and maybe 2.14
   - QGis has a nice support for "parametric" SVG based on a draft SVG
   extension that never became "official", basically, it allows to have SVG
   with parameters for stroke color, width and opacity, fill color and
   opacity. GeoTools does not recognize such extension and always renders SVG
   symbols full black. I intend to add this support to GT/GS, see
   http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Adding-support-for-parametric-SVGs-td5282722.html
   , and then enrich the QGis export to add said params in the SLD. Mind,
   right now the export QGis is doing is also invalid, it's adding tags trying
   to support the stroke related params that are not part of the SLD standard.
   I hope to be able to build this on the GeoTools side before September 18th,
   the feature freeze date for the next GT/GS release, but no promises.
   - Alignment (top/bottom/left/right) is well supported in SLD, but the
   current QGis exported does not write the appropriate tags. Should not be
   too hard to fix, but there might be several places in the code to change.
   - There is no support to export symbology where values are gathered from
   a property, or an expression based on properties. SLD supports this from
   day 0, but the SLD export code has no ability to support that. It would be
   nice to have basic support for property names, arithmetic, maybe some
   mapping between QGis own functions and GT/GS functions usable in SLD (full
   list here, can be easily extended:
   http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html
   ). This would be a massive undertaking, I'm afraid it won't be feasible
   without funding, but we'll see (note, all the work I did so far was
   unfunded).
   - There is no support for exporting raster symbology, colormaps,
   contrast stretch and the like. GeoServer also does not understand SLD 1.1
   raster symbology (it's quite different from the SLD 1.0 one), so work will
   have to be done on both sides. Seems another large undertaking.
   - x/y translation/offset for lines and polygons is not implemented in
   GeoServer (only for points and labels instead), that would require some
   work, but not too much
   - Compositing/blending is supported in GeoServer as a SLD extension,
   could be thus exported (cannot promise all single compositing/blending
   modes are a match on the two sides)
   - Pseudo 3D buildings are supported as an extension in GeoServer SLD, so
   this kind of layer is probably exportable. Might need some work on the
   GeoServer side to render the same way as QGis though (as far as I know QGis
   is doing some sorting). Example style for GeoServer and map here:
   https://github.com/charleyglynn/Extruded-buildings-SLD
   - z-stacked symbols like "highway" roads (paint all roads orange thick,
   go back, paint all roads white thin) are supported on both sides, but the
   export does not support it, and some change in the overall export logic
   would be required to actually support it, as SLD requires multiple
   FeatureTypeStyle elements, one per z level, to be generated in order to get
   the same effect. Right one there is just one FTS with many rules and
   symbolizers in it.
   - Geometry generators can probably be partially translated as "geometry
   transformations" in SLD, except in our case they do work in real world
   coordinates, not on screen:
   http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-extensions/geometry-transformations.html
   - Some types of symbology like shapeburst and inverted polygons are
   simply not available in SLD, nor in GeoServer own extensions, so one would
   have to first implement those in GeoServer, create appropriate SLD
   extensions, and then have QGis implement them in the output

I'm probably forgetting something, and likely unaware of other QGis mapping
capabilities I did not mention above :-)

In any case, my target for the sprint was to show that exporting _basic_
styling is feasible, and does not require months of work. To some extent
that was achieved (especially when we get the text symbolizer support).
Hopefully it will make more people interested, maybe some devs will pitch
in, and some sponsoring organizations can fill in the blanks.... an open
source developer can dream, right? :-p

Cheers
Andrea

Great stuff! I ran into that angle expression/filter issue last week,
so was very pleased to see the fix.

Just a reminder - please backport to the "master_2" branch as well, or
the fix will not be included in 2.18.

Hi Andrea,

Thanks for the amazing work, it's nice to see GS and QGIS compatibility
improved!

Hi,
at FOSS4G Bonn we'll have a bunch of QGis and GeoServer developers
participating at the code sprint, I would like to leverage the co-precence
and propose a "cross-project"
work idea, that is, to improve the chance that a style exported from QGis
can be
successfully imported and rendered in GeoServer.

On one side, I have had reports from GeoServer users showing documents that
were not valid XML (un-balanced tags)
or not schema compliant, like CSSProperty values containing a Filter
instead of an Expression... I don't know
if these issues are still present in the latest version of QGis, as you
imagine users tend to use a large variety of software versions,
some of which pretty old, but I see some open ticket in the QGis tracker
regarding the SLD export, so there might
be some work to do there.

On the other side, GeoServer has a preference for SLD 1.0, and SE 1.1
support definitely needs improvement,
at the same time and it could learn to use some of the QGis own extensions.
For example, the other day I've seen on stackexchange a export with a
"diamond" WellKnownName that is not part
of SE, but which would be trivial to add support for in GeoServer.

There are also other functionalities, like compositing, that are present in
both projects, but not in SE, having a way to export
them would also be good.

So I'd like to see if there is any QGis developer that would like to work
side by side
with me to bring the two projects a little bit closer in this respect.
I'll be at the code sprint after the conference, Saturday and Sunday.
Having someone contributing projects with some complex symbology to test
against would
also be a great way to keep the exercise interesting.

Anyone interested? :-)

Cheers
Andrea

I'll try. The sprint gave me a boost, but now I'm back on maybe 2 hours of
spare
time a week, even if I use all the time I have on this, it will take a long
time to do the
backports. Help much appreciated, if someone want to jump in please let's
talk in advance, that first pull request about filters introduced a
segfault that I fixed
in the last one I made (I noticed it when playing against rule based
renderers).

Cheers

Hi Andrae,

Also from me a big thank you, both for investing so much time in
'looking over the borders' of another foss project (and program
language)! And bringing in all that SLD knowledge..

Great resume and plans too!

Though I do not want to make it more complex (as it is already), but I'm
wondering if also MapServer can benefit from this (as they can also
handle sld's isn't it?)?

I think the PSC / OSGEO(?) should try to find funding for this further
as the GEOFOSS ecosystem as a whole would benefit for this.


Again: thanks for your work!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Ok, done that... I will not invest time into making gitosis work on
hub.qgis.org anymore.

So now:
for everybody that needs his hub.qgis.org repo (backup): just email me
the repo's you need and I sent you a link to a zip with your repos
(Marco and Giovanny, will do yours now).

The RasterLite2 project of spatialite will be supporting the rendering of
- SLD 1.1.0 and SE 1.1.0

The Database designer would then import the Style's into the Database,
using functions that can be seen here:
http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-sql-latest.html#p16style

For QGIS to create these Styles and export them would then a great help for
the Database designer.

Thank you very much for the summary Andrea! Sounds like the code sprint
really was a great boost for styling interoperability.

​I've been talking to a lot of QGIS & Geoserver users at FOSS4G and
FOSS4G-NOR who would be really interested in being able to export SLDs that
Geoserver understands from QGIS.

I think this topic could have crowd-sourcing potential, if a dev picks it
up.

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feedback for contrast enhancement ... enhancements
	?
Message-ID: <201609021238.20904.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

There has been interest expressed to improve the usability of the contrast 
enhancement function. Basically there are workflows where you want the min/max 
values used by contrast enhancement to be updated each time you pan or zoom 
the canvas. From what I've seen, here's what currently exists:
- a long method (6 clicks): through the Style tab of the layer properties
- a faster method (2 clicks): through the "Strech using current extent" of the 
contextual menu of the layer panel.

When you have several rasters loaded, even the 2-click method is inconvenient, 
so there's a need for a 0-click solution (once the layers have been configured)

Another shortcoming in the current implementation is that the settings of the 
"Load min/max values" foldable group are not persistant, which requires re-
setting them if you're not happy with the default Cumlative count cut method. 
And if you use the "Strech using current extent" menu item, the genuine 
min/max values are used (not the 2-98% cumulative count cut)

So I was thinking to something along the following lines:
- make the min/max settings persistant
- remove the "Load" button and "Clip extent to canvas" checkbox, and replace 
them by 3 radio buttons to determine the scope of statistics : "Whole raster", 
"Current canvas" and "Updated canvas". See the attached proposal_min_max.png. 
The function of the Load button would be replaced by the general Apply / OK 
buttons.
- when the user manually enters the min/max values, the 2 groups of radio 
buttons (method to compute min/max and scope of statistics) would be unchecked 
so that is is clear that they don't come from computed statistics. I also 
think that when you select "Current canvas", once the Apply/OK buttons have 
been pushed, the checked state of Current canvas shouldn't be saved. This way 
when you display the layer properties you have a good idea of where the 
current min/max values come from.
- make the "Strech using current extent" method honour the way min/max are 
computed in the min/max settings instead of using systematically the min/max. 
So when "Updated canvas" would be selected, it would have no (extra) effect as 
expected.

Any opinions ?

Hi all,

Just to let you know, I am working on a new design to handle snapping
settings.

Settings are now handled in a core class attached to the project,
similarly to QgsRelationManager. It will provide a nice API to deal with
the settings and some useful signals.

This means one will no longer have to change the project settings
manually and take care of emitting the proper signal.

Besides, there will be a new widget to define the settings. It will be
quite flexible and can be shown in the status bar, tool bar, dock or
dialog. Per layer config will use the legend layer tree.


If the old snapper class is removed in the mean time, it will save me
some time ;)


Best wishes,


Denis

I would also make min/max the default option, because I've has many users
(mostly newcomers) were struggling too find out why some pixels were not
displaying as expected. It was because the statistics weren't including
some, few, important pixels.
Anyway I know that, generally, cutting the tails provide a better visual
result.

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C578B184@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hello,

I am trying to setup a keyboard shortcut for a method in my plugin and was looking at the following code snippet:

http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/snippets.html#how-to-call-a-method-by-a-key-shortcut

In 2014 dakcarto wrote a similar snippet at GIS.SE:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/88795/205

Pressing the assigned key doesn't seem to trigger the method.

For establishing a reference I have looked at the plugin-reloader plugin which uses the F5 key to trigger the reload. This doesn't seem to work either. The new styling dock by Nathan uses F7 to show/hide, and it works beautifully.

Does anyone have a clue as to what could be wrong?


Regards, Casper

Hi Denis,
    the QAD plugin supports a lot of snapping types (inspired by 
autocad). Perhaps it can be useful to have new ideas. It has been 
developed to digitize in a professional way filling the gap of QGIS 
compared with other cad software.

Yes please! There's so many users on stackexchange who get confused
with this same issue.

Hi,

I've been working on something similar as a plugin, which is almost ready, see:

http://ark.lparchaeology.com/wiki/index.php/QGIS#ARK_Snapping
https://github.com/lparchaeology/libarkqgis/blob/master/snapping.py

Feel free to borrow any ideas / code :-)

John.

Hi Gam,

This is has no intent of changing the process of snapping just the way

Hi John,

This is quite close from what I'm doing! Good job, I might get some
inspiration ;)

 Whenever this is in core, it might make your plugin redundant. If you
want to keep it alive, so you'll have to update your plugin to still
work with plugin settings. That will be in 3.0 anyway, so not in a very
close future.

Cheers,
Denis

It'd be nice to move the "Snapping options" menu item to be located into
the Project menu (below or above the "Project properties" item). It doesn't
make much sense to have it located where it is ATM.

Has anyone encountered this yet? I am using the 32-bit Network Installer. I
think it started with the latest GDAL update. Loading a GeoTIFF fails on
both my machines. I had to go back to the long term release on my machine
that I use for actual work.

Thanks,

Not exactly, but I know these lines:

https://github.com/anitagraser/TimeManager/blob/master/timemanagerguicontrol.py#L122-L124

are working for me to show the settings dialog of TimeManager plugin.

And there is also the option having conflicting Keyboards shortcuts. Not
sure how Qt handles those, but currently in the Qt-tab of the message
dialog (little icon right-bottom corner), it shows with me:

Hello,

It seems that the pyparsing version (1.5.2) installed with QGIS 2.16.2 
on Windows in :
      C:/Programmes/QGIS 2.16/apps/Python27/Lib/sites-packages
is too old for the matplotlib one.

any geotiff? could you eventually share one that does not work for you
so we can test on 64bit and other platforms?

Hi,

When we started to talk about this development it was much more limited in
scope, but thanks to the community input we realized that most QGIS
resource types could be effectively handled by a unified sharing system.

There are several benefits in handling resource sharing in a common way,
some of them are obvious (avoid code duplication and make maintenance
easier) some of them are less obvious such as the fact that some resources
are much more useful when shared together with other resources, for example
data might be much more useful when shared with their styles/symbols or
with  a plugin to browse them in some fancy way, we decided to call those
sets of related resources "collections".


I believe that this plugin is now really a Resource Sharing plugin instead
of a "Symbology Sharing plugin" as it was initially planned and we should
seriously consider to make it core and to eventually move all the other
sharing systems such as plugin manager and processing downloader into this
new system, after the missing functionality will be added.

The current plugin architecture should be flexible enough to allow for
sharing new resource types and new remote repository source types if in the
future we will need to.


Cheers

Attached is a very small test image. Incidentally, the problem is with QGIS
2.16.2-1 not 2.16.1. I have only tried this on Windows with the 32-bit
network installer. The problem is definitely with gdal. If I run gdalinfo
on the image from the OSGeo4W command shell it crashes. According to the
OSGeo4W Setup, I have gdal 2.1.1-1 installed.

Thanks!

Hey Tim,

I just migrated the issues from Redmine to Github. I think there's nothing
left in the project there (https://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django) to
migrate

Jürgen,

I can reproduce the crash on a fresh new OSGeo4W 32 bit install just GDAL 
2.1.1-1. After a few trial&errors by trying previous versions of gdal, libtiff 
and libgeotiff, I've determined that it is the recent update of libgeotiff 
1.4.2-1 that seems to be the cause of the crashes. When manually reverting to 	
libgeotiff-1.3.0-3 dll, I no longer get the crash on the sample .tif (although 
just substituting the libgeotiff dll is not recommended, as there might be some 
subtle ABI differences in 1.3.0 vs 1.4.2 that might cause later issues)

Interestingly, when installing gdal-dev (2.2.0dev) and sourcing it, I don't 
get the crash, even with libgeotiff 1.4.2-1

I also tried a fresh new OSGeo4W 64 bit install but it fails when downloading 
ogdi.

I'm not sure what is wrong exactly with gdal 2.1.1/libgeotiff 1.4.2 since when 
installing gisinternals binaries ( 
http://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1600-gdal-2-1-
mapserver-7-0.zip ), gdalinfo works on the provided GeoTIFF. One difference is 
that gisinternal binaries are compiled with the internal version of libgeotiff 
in GDAL, but the sources of that one are sync'ed from latest state of 
libgeotiff SVN, so ~ 1.4.2. One subtelty between internal and external 
libgeotiff regarding GDAL is how some CPL services (the ones parsing CSV files 
mostly) are hooked.

Don't know if this helps but qgis 2-16.2 doesn't crash on Ubuntu 16.04 
64 bit using the following repos:

deb http://qgis.org/ubuntugis xenial main
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu xenial main

Rebuilt GDAL - doesn't seem to crash anymore.

Good timing - I tried to to reproduce https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/517
and applied the mentioned fix to ogdi.   Doesn't seem to work with or without.
So I reverted the ogdi packages again.  I guess I'm missing something about
ogdi and vrf.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QT Designer not installed but menu is with Network
	Installer
Message-ID: <CABPxTTojjFvYOajec1W=sk_p7aeLc9HVZzTsJSRxoLyEoFqNCg@mail.gmail.com>

If you are installing QGIS from scratch using the OSGeo4W Network installer
and using the Advanced install and install qgis:QGIS Desktop. After the
install when it creates the OSGeo4W menu items it lists

Qt Designer with QGIS 2.16.2 custom widgets

However, not all libraries have been installed for it to run. You have to
go back under "Libs" and select "qt4-devel: Qt4 headers and libraries" for
it to work.

Either the menu item should not be included or qt4-devel needs to be
included with the qgis install. I vote for the latter.

You only see this problem if you are starting from scratch and have never
selected qt4-devel to be installed.

Cheers,

Calvin

Please don't change the default behavior for 3-band rasters to min/max;
while it does make in many scenarios for 1-band rasters (DEM, precipitation
value, vegetation index, etc.), this is a terrible default value for most -
if not all - satellite imagery products (i.e. Sentinel-2, LANDSAT-{5,7,8},
ASTER, etc.).

IMO, we need to have two separate default option: one for 3-band raster
min/max (which doesn't change), and one for 1-band raster (which is changed
to min/max).

Message-ID: <CA+1ajVuTow6E+JAam=bQx1tP9CifSAUVDumN03UMOPLpU0jmSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

removing a group (created by the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin)
containing rasters from QGIS layers causes a crash.
To reproduce, if you create 2 or more classification previews with the
Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin and then remove the group
'Class_temp_group' from the layers.
Is there anything I can do at the plugin level, or should I open a ticket?

Thank you,
Luca

Hi Luca,

does it also happen when you do the same process manually?

Hi Matthias,

yes, it happens in Windows when removing the group manually (it seems that
Linux is not affected).
I had a button in the plugin for removing the temporary rasters which I
have now disabled in a plugin update.

I think I found the cause of the issue when trying to remove a layer that
was already removed.
To reproduce in Python console:
# add raster
l1 = qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer("C:\Users\a\
Desktop\LC81900312013105LGN01_B2.tif", "raster1")

remove manually the raster

# try to remove the raster
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().removeMapLayer(l1.id())

QGIS crashes

Cheers,
Luca

Hi, I believe that this is not something we can fix easily: removing the
layer from the map registry deletes the layer removing the object from
memory but the python variable still points to an object that was deleted,
of course it crashes.

There are many other similar ways you can make QGIS crash, this is due to
the nature of Python - C++ bindings and there is not much we can do, the
Python programmers should take care to avoid such potentially dangerous
situations.

You might want to use the sip API directly if you want to check for deleted
objects:
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/sip4/python_api.html

Hope this helps.

Cheers

Just to close this one off, it was nothing to do with booleans, but the issue
with spaces in var names I raised in another message. Apologies for
confusion.

Hi,
I start a new class this week, and we have a lot of Mac users.
Have tried to find the 2.16 for Mac – but can ‘only’ find the 2.14.

Is it correct 2.16 for Mac is not in out yet ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qt5 rounding issue spotted in the wild
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=qr1FVdEKpWNwLOYdK-akHu-xg559=Gyg1T47KPnxoQiA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

While testing QGIS compiled against Qt5 5.6.1 (the version that will be
offered in Ubuntu's next release in a month or so), I ran into a rounding
issue, whereas the round() expression engine function simply fails to round
values to the stated number of decimals.

As seen in this screenshot[1], using this expression "round( 0.972743..., 2
)" to round the double value to two decimals returns 0.96999999999997.

Nyall says the issue has been fixed in Qt5 5.7. For Qt5 < 5.7, is there a
contingency plan for this problem? Could we get distributions to include a
fix in their 5.6.x packages (if that’s possible)?

Message-ID: <CAO=ePtaz18-TCSJvqAK1pvr22gCaM4goD7NDmeeBPim4pk=4mw@mail.gmail.com>

I was just digging in to the new build errors for the OSX Travis builds,
and was led to this discussion:

https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/4365

My understanding is that this is game over for the Qt4 homebrew builds. Am
I mistaken here?

If so - is it time to "call it" and kill Qt4 support in master? I was
hoping to get all the unit tests passing under the Travis Qt5 builds first
but am now wondering if that's just needlessly prolonging things. Some of
the current blacklist could be much easier to address if we don't need to
care about backward compatibility.

+0

I would probaby just wait for the pyspatialite issue to be fixed.
I think it's a major issue, solution seems not that far away [0] and it
would fix some (at least 2) blacklisted

Since then, +1 to drop Qt4 support.
This branch isn't available in any package yet (osgeo4w ships master_2).
So, no big deal to me.
I agree it will just accelerate things a bit, which is really not a bad
move!

Cheers,
Denis

What's the connection between having Qt4 support in the code and
shipping Qt5 builds on Mac?

I don't mind too much dropping Qt4 support. So far I didn't see any
reason to do it and thought there are more urgent issues where time can
be invested (having mac builds for 2.16, having Qt5 mac builds, having
Qt5 Windows builds, sorting out API issues...). If you say that there
are blacklisted tests (or other things) which can be resolved easier
without Qt4, I think we should just proceed.

I explained that badly - I was thinking mostly about what the fastest
way to get some supported osx version back up and running again is. If
i'm understanding the implications of that homebrew issue correctly,
there's now no way of building master (or even 2.16) on osx.

Which lead in a roundabout way to thinking about the quickest way to
resolve the remaining qt5 test failures and how to avoid spending
*any* more wasted minutes on qt4 compatibility ;)

Denis,

There's an additional way to mitigate this:
1/ requesting Qt devs to apply the patch fixing this issue (
http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/patch/src/corelib/tools/qlocale.h?id=726fed0d67013cbfac7921d3d4613ca83406fb0f
) onto Qt 5.6, which after all is a LTS version;
2/ requesting distributions - such as Ubuntu and Fedora - to apply the
patch onto the packages maintained and offered through their repositories.

Regarding #2, I've filed such a request earlier today:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qtbase-opensource-src/+bug/1620173

It's a shame we can't override the QVariant conversion to QString with some
code of our own to patch the issue on Qt5 < 5.7.

Thanks Matthias!

I was planning on doing that too but my Qt account seems broken - I
can't login and can't reset it... sigh.

Message-ID: <CALLUJBb3dinheAt7mO7rE4Zr1mhrxE89V4i8NAAPq3oU_cUcUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I wrote a python script that aims to execute neighbourhood statistics in
raster layer. My script uses QThread to update a QList and a QProgressBar
and everithing works fine if I run the script from PyCharm, the progressbar
and the list are updated. The problem appears when I move my script in a
Qgis plugin, the UI appears correctly but clicking OK the software
crashes...
I am using qgis 2.14 in a linux machine, do you have any advice?

All the best

	empty if run from console
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiexsyQxsBz902iF-41N6Ncd1HnFHENsg_cBrdzqQTxSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

qgis:joinattributesbylocation seems to produce correct output when run from
GUI but empty output when called from the console (just copied the command
from history):

processing.runalg("qgis:joinattributesbylocation","D:/Documents/Geodata/qgis_sample_data/shapefiles/popp.shp","D:/Documents/Geodata/qgis_sample_data/shapefiles/regions.shp","['within']",0,0,"sum,mean,min,max,median",0,None)

It also runs much faster on the command line, indicating that it's not
actually processing the data (because it's much slower through the GUI).

Can anyone reproduce? I use OSGeo4W version 2.16.

Best wishes,
Anita

QWebKit was removed from the Python bindings upstream as far as I know.

It would be more helpful if you point to the code here. I had a problem
with QThread (was initially inheriting QThread) but managed to fix the
problem by creating workers and move the worker object to thread. This is a
good article about multithreading in qgis

Hi all,

Following our recent successful Point Cluster Renderer crowfunding
campaign [1], we're now seeking feedback on crowd funding for QGIS via
a short survey:

https://goo.gl/forms/Z5M9vdjUGmjo6Z5B3

If you could take 30 seconds (ok... maybe 2 minutes!) to complete this
short survey the responses will be extremely valuable in helping guide
future QGIS crowdfunding campaigns. Thanks in advance!!

 Hi,
The QtWebKit Python bindings were removed from Debian Stretch, and I guess consequently from ubuntu 16.04 also.You can look at a solution that will probably work for your case at  https://blog.qtibia.ro/2016/06/21/build-python-qt4-on-debian-testing/.All the best,
Tudor

Answer:

Absolutely none [plans to fix this in 5.6]. It's a major behaviour
change that requires a new external dependency.

Grrrr..... between this and the webkit debacle I'm not a huge fan of
our upstream at the moment!

I'm very curious why a major behavioral change like this was allowed
to be introduced in the middle of the 5.x series originally.
Honestly, the Windows approach of packaging-all-our-dependancies
ourselves is looking more and more attractive to me! ;)

Hi,

FYI I made a very brief report on OTB blog of the work started during the
foss4g codesprint to improve OTB integration in QGIS. Hope I'll find time
to continue to work on that in the future:

https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otb-in-qgis-a-brief-report-of-foss4g-2016-codesprint/

Thanks all again for your help (special thanks to Alex, Arnaud, Matthias
and Victor)

Cheers

I have been working on this for ~ a day. Later today and throughout next
week I will be working on a resolution for these issues. Sorry for the
delay.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] legendSymbologyItems - python binding
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E15D6E617EA@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi

I want to display a custom icon on the legend for a python implementation of QgsFeatureRendererV2 (VectorFieldRenderer)

The implementation that used to work many versions of QGIS ago worked by overriding the  QgsFeatureRendererV2.legendSymbologyItems(size) function.  This function does not appear to be called now?

The legendSymbolItemsV2 function is called, so I can return a QgsLegendSymbolItemV2, and in that I can return the QgsMarkerSymbolLayerV2 derived class that my renderer uses, but the renderPoint function in that is not suitable for plotting a legend item.  It requires the QgsFeatureRendererV2.symbolForFeature call to set up the marker, and in any case is needs to be scaled down to display on the legend.  As far as I can see there is no way to identify that the renderPoint function is being called to generate a legend symbol rather than a map canvas symbol?

What is the correct way to implement a custom icon on the legend now?

Thanks
Chris

One note I would add is that the  2-click option does not work with a
singleband pseudocolor renderer(neither does the raster toolbar which
offers a 1-click stretch).  So I think updating the right-click>"Stretch
using current extent" to work with singleband pseudocolor would be
excellent to include. Also, I agree that min/max would be good as a
default, for singleband at least.  Beyond that I like the sound of solution
and I would love to see this functionality in QGIS.

Hi Alvaro,

I'd also like to see that in QGis 3.

I'm developing a plugin that needs this functionality to visualize/edit
features in the vertical "plane" an it looks/behave pretty much the same
(except for a separate dock widget for the layer tree of the second and
third map).

The plugin is going to be used in three different projects, so lots of
use cases for this feature IMO.

+1 for a QEP

Vincent.

I added internal python QtWebKit bindings in master_2 (as the C++ webkit as
still around).

Nightlies still underway, they should popup in stretch, sid and xenial today.

The WebKit support has so far only been removed from python-qt4 in
Debian, but the C++ packages (from qtwebkit) will also been removed
eventually. Most probably before the stretch freeze on January 5th 2017.

Sure, but I'd wait for feedback (or the lack of any ;)) about the nighlies
first.

Thanks x100, Juergen. I'll see if I can get some tests done - very much
appreciated. +1 for backporting, to fix a lot of broken plugins.

stretch/i386 failed for some reason, but the others should be available now.

Hi there, sorry for the late reply.
Thanks to all for your support! all advices are welcome!
If this goes on, all colaboration will help me but as this seems to will be a long time commit, I will try to spend all time as I can. Anyway, whether other developer want to write this feature, I agree with it, my initial intention was to develop a proof of concept.

I created a QEP with this feature:
QEP:https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/70

Hi Alvaro,

I'd also like to see that in QGis 3.

I'm developing a plugin that needs this functionality to visualize/edit
features in the vertical "plane" an it looks/behave pretty much the same
(except for a separate dock widget for the layer tree of the second and
third map).

The plugin is going to be used in three different projects, so lots of
use cases for this feature IMO.

+1 for a QEP

Vincent.

there is an opportunity to test QGIS server against an OGC service, and
if passed we'll be mentioned officially. I think this could help selling
QGIS as a WFS server; anyone interested in doing this job?

Hi Paolo,

WFS 1.1 has not been implemented in QGIS Server. Only WFS 1.0.
I'm interesting in doing the Job if needed.

Hello Anita,

Yes, I can reproduce, with 2.16 on Ubuntu.

As it is probably me that have injected this bug, I will try to fix it.

I will have to take a look at ExtractByLocation and SelectByLocation too.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis and huge amount of data opening "small"
	postgis layer
Message-ID: <1473346892754-5284751.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello
I'm facing a problem qith Qgis 2.16.2 on windows 7 x64 and postgis on a
postgis debian server.

As I load a multipolygon table with 217 features (regional districts) a huge
amount of data is downloaded.
The table comes from a shp file 30MB (30MB .shp + 111KB .dbf) and was
imported by dbmanager.

The first time I try to load this postgis layer it takes a lot (we are on a
network that isn't a rocket), few minutes...

Qgis generate approx 60MB of data in download direction.
Data come really slow and by blocks (we are trying to see if there are some
proxy/firewall problems).

By the way, 60MB are a huge amount of data compared to 30MB of the original
shp.. Is that normal??

Other problem is that if I try to open the attribute table (dbf is 111KB)
30MB are downloaded more or less..

What could be the problem?

Thanks
Pietro

Have you imported it in single or double precision?
Do you have correct (minimal) data types for each column?
Could you simplify the data?
Have you checked disk speed?
All the best.

Thanks Paolo

This is the table:

CREATE mytable_3045
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  geom geometry(MultiPolygonZ,3045),
  nome character varying(255),
  cod_istat character varying(255),
  CONSTRAINT mytable_3045_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

Disk speed was tested and it is good..

Certainly varchar can be smaller, this would save ome byte, but I'd not
expect dramatic improvements. Why geomZ?
Is the geom in single or double precision?
All the best.

Hi,

Have you checked in the tab "Rendering" of your layer properties the
checkbox about "Realize simplification by the provider if possible" (or a
text similar, as I just translated from french...).
It can make a huge difference for smal scales like 1:500000, because data
is simplified server-side and then downloaded.See:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2410#issuecomment-160987344

Michaël

Hi all,
I'm testing the new master_2 debs, who include webkit.
QGIS and the plugins now start without complaining, but startup takes
very long, and activating qgis2web brings CPU to 100% for a couple of
minutes. Subsequent operations with the same plugins also takes miinutes.
Anyone confirms?
Thanks.

I have not checked yet. In the meantime, could you please check to export a
composer with a Text label rendered as HTML ? I noticed it was very long
before and rendered blank labels once done.
Thanks in advance.

How can I set the geometry precision?Do you think that if I set geometry as
multipolygon instead of multipolygonZ I save some data?this is the network
load
<http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/file/n5284766/postgis_table_load.png>
layer and table are 32MB each more or less... (64MB total)Table took 3
minutes to load - many collegues went home now - less network traffic..

OK, so, there are problems here: qgis2web throws an error, and it does
not render anything:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/paolo/.qgis2/python/plugins/qgis2web/maindialog.py", line
399, in closeEvent
    for attr in pop:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

On the other hand an html label is exported fine.

Thanks for the feedback.

@Kaimadu

Yes I checked that ad it is the, same if not whorse..

This time I enabled simplification server side - 1 pixel tolerance and the
layer resulted in 62MB and lot of time to be downloaded.
The data attribute opening was 32MB and a lot faster

I mean
the attribute table in the original dbf was 111KB (it is varchar and integer
- 217 records) how is it possible that it generates 32MB in download?

Confirmed compiling master_2 for debian xenial with debian rules.

Plugins with webkit work now. Anyway, I'm also experiencing some long
long time when starting QGIS.

Thanks Jef!

Can you try using one of the layers in
.qgis2\python\plugins\qgis2web\test\data\layer, and apply one of the
matching styles in .qgis2\python\plugins\qgis2web\test\data\style (please
excuse my Windows backslashes)? Those are very lightweight, and uncomplex,
to rule out any local data issues.

Thanks for testing

Tom

only remove double quotes around "['within']" => ['within'] and it works

Hi Paolo,

please remove the following plugins from hub.qgis.org. They all have been
uploaded to GitHub and, at least their latest version reflects such change
in the metadata file:

Load Them All,
Remove Empty Layers,
Synchronize QGIS with a dir.

Thanks in advance,

Germán

Hi Sergio,

DId you fix already your problems? I am not sure if my answer is 100%
correct (so I don't post it in stackexchange) as  I didnt try it, but by
judging your code:

If I click apply without entering anything in the QLineEdit the
> QgsMessageBar appears correctly but if I close the QDialog and I do the
> same the QgisMessageBar has two items (1 more, see picture)


Plugins initiallization happened when starting QGIS. So the plugin is
already instantiated (along with your dialog, message bar, etc). Restarting
(that is closing and opening again) the dialog in your code doesn't destroy
all the instances. That is why the message bar has the previous messages.
You can just clear the message bar once user opens the dialog.

If I insert a word in the QLineEdit after opening the plugin for the second
> time, clicking on apply Qgis crashes.


This is not necessarily related to the crash :p:

   -

   word = unicode(self.dlg.inputedit.text())


But QString is stored in unicode, no need to recast it

For the cause of the crash, I strongly believe this is the problem:

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.list.addItem(item)
        return

Can you try to remove return there? I think it's forcing the thread to go
back to the main loop (plugin Run method)

Cheers

It works smmothly, so all OK.
BTW, why not adding a qgis project to sample data?

Hi all,
I'm trying to make PostgreSQL services work on Windows:

* I have a valid pg_services.conf, that works on Linux
* I have double checked, and it has UNIX EOL
* I have set up both PGSYSCONFDIR and PGSERVICEFILE in various tests in
Global options --> System --> User specific environment variables

but I always get:
definition of service "test" not found
(QGIS 2.14.2 on Windows 7).
Thanks for any suggestion.

Hi Paolo,
You can check out 1.3. Setup workstation — QGEP 0.5 documentation for your answer.
Basically,  on Windows, the caveat is that you need to save pg_service.conf in Unix format in order to work.One way to do it is to open it with Notepad++and Edit --> EOL Conversion --> UNIX Format --> File save
All the best,Tudor

Installing the plugin QGIS resources sharing fails with:

No module named QtWebKitWidgets.QWebView

Anyone confirms?

I have this too, some QtWebKit plugins are still borken (but most are

Inspire Atom Client
This plugin is broken
No module named QtWebKit.QWebView

Plugin Builder
This plugin is broken
QWebView

QGIS Resource Sharing
This plugin is broken
No module named QtWebKitWidgets.QWebView

I started looking into the
Inspire Atom Client
and see

<widget class="QWebView" name="wvMetadata" native="true">
inspireatomclient/ui_metadataclient.py:
self.wvMetadata = QtWebKit.QWebView(MetadataClient)
PyQt4 UI code generator 4.10.3

while openlayers plugin (also using QWebView) has:
<widget class="QWebView" name="webViewMap"/>
openlayers_plugin/ui_openlayers_ovwidget.py:
self.webViewMap = QtWebKit.QWebView(Form)
PyQt4 UI code generator 4.9.1

they both end with:
from PyQt4 import QtWebKit

which I can also import in my python console

Anybody a clue?

Because:

1. I'd need multiple projects for the different styles

2. I couldn't get a project file to load under Travis, so I load the files
individually

Thanks for confirming it's now working - really good news.

Hi Paolo, 

I was trying to help, but I am running out of ideas. We use pg services
without any issues in our mixed Windows/Linux environments. 

Two more ideas: 

1. Try if you can connect in the OSGEO4W shell with your service
definition. Make sure that the shell sees your environment variable. You
can connect in the OSGEO shell with: 

psql "service=servicename" 

If that fails, then it is a general problem in your OS or libpq, and not
the fault of QGIS. 

2. Try to put the pg_service.conf file inside the Windows file system,
not through network shares from Linux 

Other than that - no idea what could be wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] double handed RangeSlider (for TimeManager)?
Message-ID: <58f53248-b79a-8b31-8ded-fc8074427d99@duif.net>


Hi Dev's,

TimeManager plugin is currently working with a fixed 'range' like 10
minutes (querying the data in a 10 min range) etc etc.

Current used QtSlider just shows one point (the start of the 'range').

I'm wondering if it is doable to create a custom QgsDoubleQtSlider which
more or less looks like something like this:

https://prod-foundation-forum.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/part/part_image/29697/jqm_range-sliders.png

I googled and fiddled around a little with this example:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17361885/range-slider-in-qt-two-handles-in-a-qslider

but ended up with this not really ok looking and behaving thingie:

http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/16/0909/s_1473427194_4805382_e928b5c414.png

So my question: did somebody already look into this, or maybe even has
something like this available?

I'm hoping for example that having such a slider would make it also
possible to have independent reacting start en and slots: so you can
'fix the start' and then move the end only so your range will actually
be: "from start to current point". For example for giving you the
illusion to show the 'growing city' when having the building dates of
all houses:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkOJQ-PBp-Y
(for a nice 'movie' from Steven Ottens about 'building Amsterdam')

I was successful with
set PGSERVICEFILE=C:\Users\John\Desktop\pg_service.conf
(with "C:\Users..." it failed).
Subsequent startup of QGIS however hung out, even after rebooting the
machine.

Apparently then there is an issue in defining variables within QGIS,
either not working and/or conflicting with existing ones.

Nice side effect: now QGIS wont' start anymore :(

All the best, and thanks again.

I have no problems on Windows 10 with QGIS 2.16.2 and configuring 
pg_service.conf and setting a System environment variable for 
PGSYSCONFDIR (in my case pointing to D:/).  I can then connect at the 
commandline with 'psgl service=myservicename' and then through a new 
PostGIS connection in QGIS, using that service name.  I am using PG 9.5.4

That tells me that maybe it is a permissions issue (works in user's 
desktop, but not deep in some C:/users folder - Windows 7+ has more 
strict permissions, which is why I put my pg_service.conf file on a more 
open D:/ drive).

Another note, obvious but I must mention: be careful with using the 
"set=" method, to set environment variables at the commandline, on 
Windows - this is only temporary, in that command window, meaning that 
another tool such as QGIS has no access to that temporary variable.  You 
must set a SYSTEM environment variable, through Control Panel/System and 
Security/System/Advanced system settings/Environment Variables.   And be 
sure to set a "SYSTEM" variable through that interface (you could lose 
sleep and hair later if you try to set a USER variable and can't 
understand why it isn't found by some software).  This is important.

Maybe that info helps someone reading this thread later someday :)

Yet another note: in your testing, always always be sure to close your 
command window, or QGIS, after making changes to any system environment 
variables.  Then re-open your command window, or QGIS, and re-try your 
commands/settings.   (all these little tips are never documented 
anywhere, but just stuff I've learned helping clients along the way).  I 
hope the tips help someone else someday :)

It works in this way. I could not make it work through QGIS variables,
I'm not sure it really works that way.
Thanks Jeff, and all who helped.
I'm glad I can keep on hating Windows with one more argument.
All the best.

The default location should be %APPDATA%\postgresql\.pg_service.conf

A good tool to track down stuff like this is:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx

There I also see that psql.exe looks for pg_service.conf in C:\OSGeo4W64\etc

Thanks, very useful. IMO this should go to the manual, at
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/supported_data.html#pg-service-file

Indeed, I was looking for that once! Can you do a pull request?

Hi, are we the only ones?

It's a strange thing: sometimes the raster dialog opens fine and I can
load a raster and immidiatly after the loading I cannot use the dialog
anymore...

I also tried to start QGIS with a clean configpath..

It's both in master_2 and in master/QGIS3 with me?
QGIS is very busy at that moment..  trying to index something? Or
searching for something??

http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/16/0911/h_1473598922_7608453_940ca73ec1.png

Using strace, it looks like it is polling something?

poll([{fd=6, events=POLLIN|POLLOUT}], 1, -1) = 1 ([{fd=6, revents=POLLOUT}])
writev(6,
[{"\213\24\t\0\20\0`\1\1\0\0\0\17\0\0\0\3\0\2\0\0\0\2\0\4\0\0\0\2\235F\0"...,
108}, {NULL, 0}, {"", 0}], 3) = 108
recvmsg(6, {msg_name(0)=NULL,
msg_iov(1)=[{"\16\0L\251\252\0`\1\0\0>\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0",
4096}], msg_controllen=0, msg_flags=0}, 0) = 32
recvmsg(6, 0x7ffcd8ab7f50, 0)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
recvmsg(6, 0x7ffcd8ab7f50, 0)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
recvmsg(6, 0x7ffcd8ab8120, 0)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
recvmsg(8, 0x7ffcd8ab8110, 0)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)

piping the strace output to a file I try to find what QGIS was doing
when that starts:
http://pastebin.com/dE06wib3

Look like it is GTk+ related...

If I select another Style: /Options/General/Style all is ok! Plastique,
Cleanlooks, Windows: no problem

So only the GTK+ theme (which I think is default on Linux?) is affected.

So maybe it is a GTK+ problem (on Debian Testing)?

Regards,

Richard

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 3 plugins - require implementation as
	processing algs?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjxfxQyksBQZLKdOBTF5JL_H78P4FjmC3r+tE_praG3-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just something which has been on my mind and I thought I'd see if others agree:

Given that for QGIS 3.0 we will effectively start the available plugin
repo with a "clean slate", I'm wondering if it's a good time to put in
a restriction along the lines:

"If it COULD be made as a processing algorithm then it MUST be made as
a processing algorithm".

This is leading from Victor's excellent talk at Girona
(http://diobma.udg.edu/handle/10256.1/4300) But basically, there's
many reasons why we'd want this, including:

- consistent, robust and featureful UI for algorithms. Instead of
every plugin implementing its own UI with a different feel and feature
set, all processing algorithms have a consistent UI, which is well
tested and stable. This also makes things easier for plugin devs in
that they no longer have to waste time with UI, and they gain all the
extra features which are available in the processing UI (eg extent
selection with options from canvas, layers, etc) at no cost to
themselves.

- plugins become instantly more useful because they can be integrated
into models. This is better for users since these plugin algorithms
become more powerful. It's also better for plugin devs since their
plugins will get more use.

- easier path for valuable, widely used algorithms to become part of
core processing - if plugins are developed using the processing
algorithm framework then it becomes much easier for us to pull them
into the core qgis algorithms.

- better interface for QGIS. Instead of power users getting bogged
down with dozens of extra toolbar icons and menus for every plugin
they've installed they would instead be nicely and consistently
grouped into the processing toolbox.

(But seriously - watch Victor's presentation. He explains this all much better!)

Given this, should we require that for any plugin to be eligible to be
included in the official repo it MUST be implemented as a processing
algorithm IF it can be be fully implemented as an algorithm?

I personally can only see benefits to this approach, and timing it
with 3.0 (when people have to rewrite their plugins anyway) makes
sense.

Thoughts?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsFeatureRendererV2.startRender deprecated ...
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E15D7EBC1ED@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All

I see that the version of QgsFeatureRendererV2.startRender taking a QgsVectorLayer as a second parameter is deprecated in favour of a version taking a field list.

As yet this has not (as far as I can see) been applied to SIP and python, presumably because the name cannot be overloaded in python.   At the moment this is good for me!  I need to get information about the layer in order to implement a custom renderer.  However this will not be available in the future, which will be a problem.

In particular I want to get the layer CRS in order to determine the relationship between true north and projection north, so that I can apply this rotation to the symbol.   It is not clear to me where I can get this from once the deprecated implementation of startRender is removed.  Possibly this could be added to the QGS render context?  I can access coordinate transformations there, but I don't see that as a guaranteed API for getting the source CRS.  Any suggestions?

Thanks
Chris Crook

well, here i'm a bit lost. when i do:

I get this:
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/QtWebKit.so
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4/QtWebKit.so

also:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/amd64/python-qt4/filelist

gives the same info. tellingly, QtWebKit.so is not in the debian file 
list.

which tells me that python qt webkit bindings are in stock ubuntu 
xenial. so, why the failure? was qgis compiled without the qt python 
headers? i can understand that happening for the debian builds (those 
necessary headers don't exist), but surely they do on the ubuntu build 
machine?

I will be happy to help on this, helping developers when adapting

current plugins that would be convenient to adapt as Processing
algorithms, and help their developers implement them as such.

I think most people will agree, since I am aware that many like the

didnt know how to do it, but we can expect some people to protest and
refuse. I guess we have to take that into account, since it is also

Let me know how I can help on this.

Having a better documentation and howto on "write QGIS Processing
Plugins" could be interesting.
Vincent Mora wrote a minimal Processing Plugin for educational purpose,
it could be used as a starter.
https://github.com/vmora/micro-processing

More templates from Plugin Builder could also be interesting.

If we have documentation and howtos, I think we can be a bit pushy on
this topic, since plugin developers will have to modify their code anyway.
And if they do not want to do it, they can still publish their plugin
outside of the main repository.

During the Girona hackfest, I added a new functionality, to create a
plugin with a Processing provider, directly from the toolbox. You just
create a bunch of Processing scripts (unless the algorithm is really
complex, it should be possible and easier to add it as a script), and
then select them and create a provider plugin with them.

This is done using the "Scripts/Tools/Create script collection plugin"
option in the Processing toolbox. If you want to create this kind of
plugin (based on Processing scripts) manually, the Processing code
includes and example [1]. It also includes an example of a "normal"
plugin with an algorithm provider, similar the the one that Vincent
Mora wrote [2]

This is (briefly) documented in [3]

If you have ideas about how to give more visibility to these docs, let
us know. Paolo and I discussed this a bit after Girona, but I guess we
can make all this more visible and accesible for developers. I will be
happy to extend those documents with ideas, so feel free to propose
improvements.

Cheers

Hi Nyall+, all,
this is a very good and timely idea, and I fully support it.
I regularly suggest all new suitable plugin writers to move their plugin
as a Processing subplugin.
The weak point I see is how to evaluate which plugins can and cannot
become a Processing subplugin. Perhaps we could have a look and see how
easy the classification is? The more grey areas the more difficult will
be to implement this. Maybe we can meet on IRC and see how it goes on a
sample of plugins?
Obviously, clear and sleek documentation, featuring prominently is one
of the keys here. You'll be surprised knowing how many plugin authors
started a new one just because they didn't know the same function was
available elsewhere.
Thanks Victor for your offer of help. I think this is the second key for
the success of this initiative.
Obviously I'm available to help here.
All the best.

As Victor said we already have enough documentation and
there are many Processing providers in our repo which can
be used as examples.

Hi,
sure, we just have to make all this very easy to find and follow.
Thanks.

I developed it years ago and used it in few plugins (e.g. see [2]).

+1 for idea to create the core functionality of plugins into a more
library like modules. And a good TIME to start of with this too, thanks
for raising this Nyall!

What I miss in Processing though (but I'm not sure if it should be
introduced in processing!) is the intelligent gui you sometimes need for
certain plugins..

Some examples:
- a plugin which first has to access some REST-service to get a list of
projects, then upon the selection of a project a dropdown is filled with
'modules' of which the user has to select one, and based on that...etc
etc . and THEN the actual algorithm starts of.
- a good geocoder: off course the actual sending of the final request
and parsing/showing the response is a nice processing component, but the
first interaction with the user (like autocompletion etc) to mee seems
more a gui/plugin thing

What (I think) makes a distinction between a plugin and a processing
one, is that a plugin offers a complex interaction with the user (so gui
interaction) , while in processing the algorithm is the actual center of
gravity.
But maybe I'm wrong in this analysis. Looking at my own plugins, it is
often the gui-interaction which (for me) makes it harder to me to move
it to processing...

Could/would it help if we create a common interface both for plugins and
processing?

Or else, a plugin api-interface which more or less guides a dev in
separating the gui-part into the plugin and the core part in a
module/processing module?
Only documentation and examples could have the same effect (AND are very
much needed), but for example IF we already make the plugin builder
create an 'api' should it not be more effective?

As my gut feeling is a marriage between the plugin and processing parts
is good(tm) :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

+1 it is a great idea. I've been teaching a few training courses on Python
and QGIS for prospecting plugin writers and I'm always reccommending
creating new plugins via processing rather than standalone (after going
through what is possible and what is not).

The main issue here, in my opinion, is the lack of documentation on
processing. In my training courses I usually provide a UML class diagram
with the main classes of processing and then direct people directly to the
source code at github. I think this scares them a bit, but I haven't found
a better way.

What about improving  processing's docstrings with more detail and then
including them in the QGIS docs site as Sphinx docs?
I can volunteer to help out with writing some of these docstrings, if
needed.

Best regards

+1, because of the modeller functionality.

In a more minor way, I'd also like to think of a way to handle the various
"connect to a national service" type of plugins which are:

1. perhaps overly simple in aim for a plugin
2. very similar in function to one another
3. often of limited userbase-wide interest

However, plainly some market need results in their being created (ease of
use, I guess), so I'm not sure what the solution is.

Agreed, and there are other cases as well. My approach is to apply a
gentle pressure every time a new plugin of this type appears. I'm
sometimes successful. Having a general guideline on this (never
duplicate a plugin, always merge) would help implementing it, even thugh
someone could be unhappy with it.
All the best.

I am currently working on a new architecture for parameters (based on
a work started by Arnaud Morvan), which will make that easier, since
parameter widgets emit signals when their value changes, and that can
be used by other parameters widgets to change their content.

However, some plugins might not be feasible to adapt, which is fine as
well. You can have your own UI, with a richer behaviour, but still
have its functionality exposed as a Processing algorithm, which will
make it more useful.

There are quite a few plugins that can clearly be adapted to
Processing and have very simple UIs. We should start with those ones,
I guess

Cheers

I will be happy to work on this as well. Notice that, however,
developing a Processing script (which should be enough for most cases)
requires very little knowledge of Processing. If you know the syntax
for defining the algorithm semantics (which are used for creating the
UI), then the rest is just using the QGIS API to work with the values
entered by the user (layers, strings, etc...). There are some helper
methods in the Processing code (probably not very documented), but
they are optional, just some handy methods to makes things easier.

The few methods and ideas that are required, they are all documented
in the corresponding section in the QGIS manual (not the PyQGIS
cookbook...where we should maybe put it as well...)

I must stress the point that documentation should be very prominent and
easy to access: we are a big project now, and people finds increasingly
difficult to find the right way to do things.
Probably a blog post, and the usual Twitter etc. swarm will help.
All the best.

I totally agree with Nyall's suggestion. But I think we need to be careful
about how much can we impose to existing plugin's developers.

(I would like to "impose" some basic usage documentation, so that the users
don't need to hunt the buttons or menus the plugin created and try to
figure out how to use it by himself.)

On the other hand, like Vincent said, we don't want to have a bunch of
angry plugin developers. We also don't want to have thousands of misfit and
duplicated plugins around. But I'm not sure I would like to go back to the
time that, as a user, you needed to be fishing repositories to get some
nice extra functionality. I think that this will increase the number of
duplicates and make the life of both users and developers harder.

Although we should have rules, can we manage part of this impositions with
the trusted plugins?

I feel a bit puzzled too. To me, it's a bit harsh to force someone to
develop one way. People developing plugins are not necessarily advanced
programmers, and might found a bit too complicated to have to dig into
documentation. I believe many (like me) usually just copy existing code
and try to modify it by small steps. Having to redesign the whole plugin
would sound way too hard/long.

I like the idea of the trusted plugins. From the discussion in Girona
about trusted developers, it could be a nice way to have a short list of
well-made, non redundant, not too specific plugins. These would be
tagged as such. Then, the big list with less quality control.

Plugins are probably one of the reason of QGIS' popularity and
preventing plugins authors from publishing their work easily is not a
good move to me. Having a quality labeled list sounds like the good
deal. It shouldn't be too hard to maintain such list. I wouldn't mind
being involved in this.

My 2 cents.

Message-ID: <6c5accbf0009cc1c0a59f840339385b2@xs4all.nl>

Hi Devs,

I forward a (translated) question sent to me here (from a system admin 
from a school willing to install QGIS):

Start Quote: >>

Trying to install 2.16-2 via a network installation both on Win7 and 
Win10 the installation seems to stop at the moment that 
/bin/acvexport.exe is extracted.
This is avce00-2.0.0-1. The message you receive is "the file is already 
in use". But only the QGIS installation is active at that moment. You 
can only click 'Cancel', the 'Continue' button is not active.
Both 32 and 64 bits installers tried.
Before the installation you can choose which items you want to install, 
but avce00 is not one of them...

End Quote <<<

Anybody a clue?

Regards,

Richard

Has anyone seen this? Perhaps it's just Travis playing up today - I've also

AttributeError: 'QgsProject' object has no attribute 'layerTreeRoot'

But occasionally it succeeds. Any ideas?

Yes it has been deprecated because since 2.4 rendering is normally
done in a worker thread and having direct access to the layer would be
unsafe.

One can get source CRS from the coordinate transform (from render
context): context.coordinateTransform().sourceCrs() - why isn't that a
guaranteed API?

An alternative would be to pass layer's CRS to the renderer object
when the renderer is created.

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7y=E-KjfrW9nZg5t-S-J4=yY7_WR8ScJ=3uewHCGvwOUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

There was some discussion about the Processing documentation in
another thread, mainly about the one targeted at developers.

I was thinking about spending some time improving/updating the
documentation, both for users and devs, and most likely Alex Neto will
have some time as well to help me on that, organizing stuff,
completing what is missing and doing a bit of cleaning. Since this is
a good oportunity to move forward in the Processing documentation, I
would like to ask you for you ideas and comments, so we can focus on
what is more important or urgent.

I was thinking that, since this is a large topic, it could be a good
idea to have it somehow separated from the rest. That doesn't mean it
has to be taken apart from the other documents, but at least having a
Processing-only index page that we can link clearly from the main docs
page, so it serves as an entry point for all the Processing-related
docs. That might makes things easier for users or developers, whenever
they are looking for some information.

Thanks in advance!

Thanks Victor, a much welcome offer. IMHO an important thing is to make
it easier for users to add their content: many algs are very
specialized, and allowing someone expert in that field will greatly
speed up the building of a complete documentation.
IMHO it is also important to keep on reusing existing docs, available at
least for GRASS, GDAL, and OTB. This will result in some heterogeneity,
but is better and more sustainable in the long term than redoing everything.
I'm available for help if necessary.
All the best.

Thanks Martin

I did see coordinateTransform after posting this request.  I was still concerned that coordinateTransform might be null if there was no tranformation required (eg OTF transformations not enabled, or source and dest CRS are the same.  However I have seen that in this case the coordinateTransform is still populated, so this is a good option for me.

Thanks also for suggestion of extracting layer infomation when the renderer is created..

Chris

Yes it has been deprecated because since 2.4 rendering is normally
done in a worker thread and having direct access to the layer would be
unsafe.

One can get source CRS from the coordinate transform (from render
context): context.coordinateTransform().sourceCrs() - why isn't that a
guaranteed API?

An alternative would be to pass layer's CRS to the renderer object
when the renderer is created.

Hi Giuseppe,

ah Thanks! Looks good!

But... I also want to use the tick steps (to use discrete intervals in
timemanager). Looks like this is some tricky way with two sliders from
which one is inverted... If I show ticks you get pretty strange results.

Why Qt does not have a range slider?

I found another option:

https://github.com/mkilling/QxtSpanSlider.py
( though libqxt is not maintained anymore :-( )

Anyway, thanks for your work

Regards,

Richard

agreed also on that.. in some courses people don't use some super cool
algorithm because of the lack of documentation (especially SAGA)..

I remember I documented some algorithm, see for example old 2.4 release

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/release-2_6/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/help

is there a way we can recover those help files? I know it could be a
boring issue, but if we can provide a robust documentation, then users
will be happier (maybe)

I'm available for help

Thanks again

Hi Matthias,
I'll be glad of doing it; I'd just want to have some confirmation
before, as the config on Win still looks a bit black magic to me.
Thanks for feedback.

The documentation for algorithms should still be in the
QGIS-Documentation repo, right?

Actually, I was thinking more about the usage documentation and the
dev documentation, so the one that describes Processing itself, not
the algorithms. But, of course, algorithm docs are also important

Thanks!

1) in qt4 before it's license change, double sliders was a commercial component

Hi Anita, Hi Paolo, Hi all

I had a look at the available material on the subject of graphs /
networks; I saw (very quickly) three products:
1) Library Network Analysis
2) the plugin Road Graph
3) the sDNAV plugin;

apart from the third product that seems to be the most complex tool
and I have not seen well, the other two seems contain essentially the
search for shortest paths by Dijkstra method;
confirmed the great importance of the Dijkstra method for the graph
theory, we need remember the many faces on the subject; in my (very
experimental) plugin I approach:
- the vertex and edge inquiry
- some (limited) editing (weight of edges)
- storage I/O
- trees (BFS, DFS)
- cycles
- minimum spanning tree (Jarnik-Prim and Boruvka-Kruskal)
- connectivity (cutpoints, bridges, vertex- and edge- connectivity)
- paths (shortest & not shortest, single & all)
- visualization with QGIS desktop
- (limited) import/export from/to SHP format;

I know, that's probably an approach more theoretic than practical
oriented, but I think that these topics represents fundamental tools
for graph analyzing; I will try to apply them in some actual case (the
road graph on my town? :-) and describe it in the last part of the
presentation article I uploaded at Slideshare;

in the topic of SHP import/export, it's very interesting the ability
to build graphs starting from SHP files available in the Library
Network Analysis, even though there does not convince me at all, for
example, the plethora of generated vertices (suffices imho the end
points) and the automatic intersection of linestring with a shared
vertex (I think might prevent the processing of not planar graphs);

so here's a first report (I took some commitment); I'll look better
the classes of the  Network Analysis Library and I will try also to
take a look at sDNAV plugin although I fear that now it is beyond of
my potential;
I repeat: I am not a graphs expert but a simple "mathematics" amateur,
but if I can do some help to this part of the QGIS would gladly give a
contribution;

In my opinion some documentation on how to write Processing plugins is 
needed.

Victor mentioned in the previous thread that there is already some 
documentation on the QGIS user guide that is useful for developing plugins 
(which I assume to be this[1]). The mentioned docs  are helpful for writing 
Python scripts. While indeed being very useful, I think that they cater to 
a different use case. It seems to me that this is more of an 'advanced 
user' type of feature than a 'developer' one. With this in mind, it makes 
sense to me that these docs are currently in the user guide.

What I think is lacking is some documentation on how to write a proper 
plugin that can be distributed via plugin manager. Some stuff that seems 
relevant and lacking:

* Describing the overall architecture of the Processing framework. Perhaps 
a brief description of the main classes or some high level diagram. Also 
some API docs, akin to the QGIS C++ API, perhaps with one or two examples, 
where appropriate;

* How to organize things in the toolbox and how do the concepts of the 
algorithm provider and the grouping of algs in the toolbox are related;

* How to use the AlgorithmProvider, GeoAlgorithm, Parameter and Output 
classes;

* How to work with the settings panel, logging facilities, progress 
indicators and other extra goodies that Processing already has;

* Throw in an example of how to expose a regular python plugin (I mean one 
that manages its own GUI) through Processing in there as well, in order to 
help refactoring the current plugins that could benefit from tighter 
integration with the rest of QGIS.

I'm also available for helping out with this, if necessary/needed.

Best regards

Hi,

As described in our plugin issue tracker (https://github.com/isogeo/iso
geo-plugin-qgis/issues/44#issuecomment-246633548), our plugin has been
approved (https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-
September/044554.html) and it's available on the QGIS plugins website (
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/isogeo_search_engine/) but it's not
available through the QGIS Extension Manager (with experimental channel
activated of course) and the update is not proposed to existing
installations.

Note that everything worked fine including previous version 0.3.0-beta.

Thanks for helping me,

Julien Moura

Hi all,


I just compiled without error qgis master  2.99.0-master d265f33 on ubuntu 16.04.

However I got this error on launching the application:


Couldn't load plugin fTools due to an error when calling its classFactory() method

ImportError: cannot import name QGis

After that qgis start normally, but all the python plugin were not loaded.


Any hints on this regard?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis donload entire postgis data table (with
 geom?) opening attribute table
Message-ID: <1473769142949-5285532.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello
with Qgis and Postgis layers I noticed a strange behaviour

Qgis 2.16.2 on windows 7 x64, Postgis 2.1 on Postgres 9.4.x debian server

I created a vector multipolygon table:
**************************************
CREATE TABLE myschema.mytable
(  id serial NOT NULL,
  geom geometry(MultiPolygon,3045),
  name character varying(254),
  code character varying(254),
  CONSTRAINT mytable_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

CREATE INDEX sidx_mytable_geom
  ON myschema.mytable
  USING gist
  (geom);
************************************

This table contains 217 feature (regional districts) with names and codes.
Disk space (https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Disk_Usage) is:

************************************
oid	17848
table_schema = myschema
table_name = mytable
row_estimate = 217
total_bytes = 22142976
index_bytes = 24576
toast_bytes = 22077440
table_bytes = 40960
total = 21 MB
index = 24 kB
toast = 21 MB
table = 40 kB
************************************

When I load this layer in TOC Qgis downloads 1.3MB (server side
simplyfication enabled in display options).

Then If I right click on layer and select open attribute table Qgis
downloads 22MB.

Then on the table if I click on the top left corner to select all records
Qgis downloads other 1.3MB.

At this point If I copy (ctrl+C) all records Qgis downloads other 22MB.

Pasting into excel spreadsheet result in a huge amount of data, because
there is a WKT column with geometry in WKT format.

Executing this query

******************
SELECT id, name, code FROM mytable;
******************

in Qgis generates 9.0KB download traffic
PGAdminIII generates 9.9KB with the same query.

In PGadminIII this query
******************
SELECT id, ST_AsEWKt(geom), name, code  FROM myschema.mytable;
******************
or this one
******************
SELECT id, ST_Astext(geom), name, code  FROM myschema.mytable;
******************
downloads 45.8MB

It seems that Qgis downloads some kind of geometry definition opening
attribute table, it doesn't seem a wkt (22MB vs 45.8MB)

Now,
is this normal??

If yes, what is the usefulness in downloading all postgis/postgres table
when selecting "open attribute table"?
Couldn't be more useful to download only real "attribute values", 9KB
instead of 22MB??

I know in previous Qgis version there was the possibility to choose if we
wanted the WKT column together with attribute table for copy/paste from/to
other applicatios, in Qgis 2.16 I kan't find it..

Thanks
Pietro

Seems you trying to install QGIS master on the top of existing QGIS
installation without removing old files. fTools plugin was removed in
QGIS 2.16.

Please perform clean install (remove all old files first)

thank you very much for the replay;

as I said, my actual target is not "analyse" graph & digraphs, but
learn graph & digraphs analysis :-) this plugin helped me to learn
(something) of the matter and I hope that it can help other students
to do so;

I recover your hint for better times :-)

Or, if this is for development, change the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path to 
install QGIS master in your home, not in your system folders.

Hi Alexander,


I just clone newly the qgis repo, I started from scratch.

What kind of old file do you mean?

QGIS 2.16.

Please perform clean install (remove all old files first)

Before make install command I remove qgis dir from /usr/local/share,

after make install (now without error) qgis runs correctly, but I have not any plugin.

So I started to reinstall those important for me...someone (e.g lizmap) gave me this message in the error box:


The plugin is broken. Python said:

global name 'Qgis' is not defined


hints?

Hi Alexander,


I just clone newly the qgis repo, I started from scratch.

What kind of old file do you mean?

Apparently the release of the plugin is not be compatible with QGIS master,
which is not surprising as API breaks are allowed on master branch for 
QGIS 3.0.

Here is some hints to work with QGIS master :

     * do not install QGIS master system wide, better install it in your 
home directory.

     * QGIS master use plugins from in $HOME/.qgis-dev/python/plugins 
directory
         so you could clone the plugin master branch, build it if 
necessary and install it to $HOME/.qgis-dev/python/plugins directory
         and propose pull request on the plugin repo if suitable

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis eating one core (Debian testing)?
Message-ID: <cb206cb4-ec8d-8385-e7bf-a0822c90aee4@duif.net>

Hi,

I'm on Debian testing, running self compiled QGIS.

Both master and master_2 keep one core at at least 80%, making my fan
blow all day :-(

Anybody a clue?

Hi Akbar,

as you suggested I removed return but it didn't solve the problem...
I don't get it because when I open the dialog the first time I can play
with it changing word without problem
(I mean that I can insert a new word several time and when I push apply
everything works well).
I think it's something that I should destroy when closing the dialog... but
I don't find what!
Two strange behaviours that I found is that sometimes after restarting the
dialog if I insert the same word I inserted during the
last run the plugin works well or if I change word it writes double items,
like digiting "et" it inserts "ee" and "tt" and after it crashes, but how
it gets
the double letters in the loop?...
It's for sure something related to the restarting as if I use the plugin
reload it doesn't crash...
Any idea? Anyway thanks for your suggestion!

All the best
s.

Hei Giuliano,

I would suggest also having a look at the igraph library: http://igraph.org/redirect.html.
Very powerful and feature rich and with Python, R, and C interface.
I used the library for network analysis in different context and can only recommend it...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Anita, Hi Paolo, Hi all

I had a look at the available material on the subject of graphs / networks; I saw (very quickly) three products:
1) Library Network Analysis
2) the plugin Road Graph
3) the sDNAV plugin;

apart from the third product that seems to be the most complex tool and I have not seen well, the other two seems contain essentially the search for shortest paths by Dijkstra method; confirmed the great importance of the Dijkstra method for the graph theory, we need remember the many faces on the subject; in my (very
experimental) plugin I approach:
- the vertex and edge inquiry
- some (limited) editing (weight of edges)
- storage I/O
- trees (BFS, DFS)
- cycles
- minimum spanning tree (Jarnik-Prim and Boruvka-Kruskal)
- connectivity (cutpoints, bridges, vertex- and edge- connectivity)
- paths (shortest & not shortest, single & all)
- visualization with QGIS desktop
- (limited) import/export from/to SHP format;

I know, that's probably an approach more theoretic than practical oriented, but I think that these topics represents fundamental tools for graph analyzing; I will try to apply them in some actual case (the road graph on my town? :-) and describe it in the last part of the presentation article I uploaded at Slideshare;

in the topic of SHP import/export, it's very interesting the ability to build graphs starting from SHP files available in the Library Network Analysis, even though there does not convince me at all, for example, the plethora of generated vertices (suffices imho the end
points) and the automatic intersection of linestring with a shared vertex (I think might prevent the processing of not planar graphs);

so here's a first report (I took some commitment); I'll look better the classes of the  Network Analysis Library and I will try also to take a look at sDNAV plugin although I fear that now it is beyond of my potential; I repeat: I am not a graphs expert but a simple "mathematics" amateur, but if I can do some help to this part of the QGIS would gladly give a contribution;

sfmbe, thanks, bye,
giuliano

Hi Sergio,

It sounds like a new problem. Did removing the return fix the crash problem
that happened before? As your problem now that it prints double letters, I
am sure that you just need to clear some component's state before running
the worker.

Do you have the plugin somewhere on github? If you have, I'll try it myself

Cheers

Just read your code again in stackexchange. If you want to have a new fresh
instance of your dialog every time you open the dialog, you need to
restructure your code. I think you use Plugin Builder and you instantiated
the dialog in the __init__ of the main file. You can remove the run method
and just open the dialog in the action.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plans for QGIS 3.0 and QWebView.... *sigh*
Message-ID: <CAB28AshNJ05E2KiuHzP9t4EWXexKJZFmT1UJnzm-uiyvymkahg@mail.gmail.com>

Sooooo... now that we're close to cutting off Qt4 I guess it's time to
start this conversation again. What should we do with web views in
QGIS 3.0?

Here's the situation as I see it:

- upstream still hasn't made the new QtWebEngine classes anywhere near
as featureful as the removed QWebView classes. I was hoping by the
time we were ready for Qt5 this would have changed, but there hasn't
been any really relevant changes since we last discussed this.

- the one minor expection to this is a new method which was added in
Qt 5.7 - QtWebEngine::printToPdf [1] . The docs say:

"Renders the current content of the page into a PDF document and saves
it in the location specified in filePath. The page size and
orientation of the produced PDF document are taken from the values
specified in pageLayout."

Potentially we could use this as a roundabout way of rendering web
content offscreen - we could print the content out to a pdf, then
somehow read it back in and render it to a QPainter surface. Maybe. I
haven't been able to test this, but I have extreme doubts. Just
looking at the docs I can't see anyway to control the DPI used for
printing the content to a pdf, and my suspicion is that it will just
be rendered using screen resolution.

Even with the long shot that we could successfully use this method
it's still only available in Qt 5.7, which won't hit our target
platform repos until mid 2029 ;)

- Possibly we could use the revived QtWebKit (see [2]), but we'd
probably need to package it ourselves. Advantages of this approach are
numerous, including no loss of current features.


Given all this... I think our realistic options are:

1 Don't use a web engine. Use QTextDocument and it's limited html/css
support. Disadvantages: we lose the ability to insert rich html
including javascript, etc. Advantages: retain vector outputs and
simple code.

2 Render QtWebEngineView widgets as rasters in screen resolution.
Disadvantages: pixelated, not vectorised and text converted to raster,
requires use of a graphical widget which may cause issues with things
like QGIS server (?). Advantages: can use javascript, videos, etc



My opinion:

QgsComposerLabel - approach 1. Switch to the basic QTextDocument support

HTML annotations - approach 2. These are likely used more often in the
canvas interactively and the loss of resolution when they are used in
composer is less important.

QgsComposerHTML - no idea. Probably option 2 but the loss of
resolution/vector output will really hurt.


It's probably time for us to address this, so we need to make a choice
between these bad options. Any suggestions?

Nyall

Did you try implementin something like the comment I posted in
Stackexchange?

Hi Akbar,

yes this is what I meant

    If you want to have a new fresh instance of your dialog every time you
open the dialog, you need to restructure your code.


I used Plugin Builder, I had not experience with it before, but how you
suggested the problem was that the dialog was instantiated in the __init__


    I think you use Plugin Builder and you instantiated the dialog in the
__init__ of the main file. You can remove the run method and just open the
dialog in the action.


I removed self.dlg = my_ui() from the __init__ and I put it in the run()
method and everithing works pretty well! Thank you very much! Could you
please answer
in Stackexchange so that everyone can see the solution? I will post later
the new code.

Marco, I didn't try yet what you posted in Stackexchange, I did not have
time till now but I found it well done, I will try it asap... so thanks for
your advice!

Best

s.

Not yet, but will be (in Debian) since there is no more upstream
security support for WebKit in Qt4 now that it's EOL. Continuing to rely
on WebKit in Qt4 is irresponsible from a security POV.

It it's true that QWebKit is back, this seems most logical solution to me,
why you did not list it in the realistic options?

Hi Bas,

but discussion is about Qt5/QGIS3 isn't it?

So I think Matthias means: can we keep using WebKit (in Qt5) for 
QGIS3/master?
(if Qt really revives it for Qt5 as the [2] link of Nyall seems to tell 
us)


Regards,

Richard

We will be switching to Qt5 soon, this discussion only targets the Qt5
version, so this is no issue.

In the meanwhile it would be nice if QGIS users wouldn't be forced to
switch to other distributions.

Kind regards,

Nyall,

IMO, this item (QgsComposerLabel - approach 1. Switch to the basic
QTextDocument support) should be applied, irrespective of the QWebView
situation. I have never expected to get full-fledged html support when
checking the render as HTML, especially since we have an HTML element
alongside labels. Also, when the label item shares code with the labelling
engine, the need for html rendering will be greatly reduced (i.e., no more
need for it when in need of text shadow, outline, etc.).

I can't remember why, but I was under the impression that Debian was
also cutting off QtWebKit for Qt5. Or am I mistaken?

For Qt5 it's no problem, that's still supported upstream.

I thought you meant like the embedded copy of python-qt4.

It would be great if QGIS were to support changes in its dependencies
sooner, and not wait until they are (near) EOL. I guess the incentive
isn't there when there is no funding for it.

Eventually it is. I'm not sure on the timeframe for various platforms
but sooner or later we'll hit this. I think it'd be easier for plugin
devs/packagers if we address this before QGIS 3.0 release.

Ah - maybe I've got this wrong. I thought it was getting cut off with 5.6.

So that's good news, I guess we can stick with QtWebKit for the life
of QGIS 3. and hope the situation is better when 4 rolls around....

I've started working on Qt5 transitions without any funding way more
than a year ago.

I think there was an initiative to revive QtWebKit.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=QtWebKit-Next-Gen

So I'm really not sure it's worth the trouble with (at least my) current
state of knowledge.

Yeah - that's this one

I'm just not sure if distros will embrace and package this.

Yes, and props to your for that. If only you had more helping hands
longer before Qt4 went EOL.

Qt4 went EOL in December 2014 and was eventually extended to December
2015, the work on Qt5 support in QGIS was still very late in the Qt4
lifetime.

Work on Qt5 support should have started when Qt 5.0.0 was released and
planned to be ready when Qt4 originally went EOL. That's what I expected
for such an essential component of QGIS, and what made me so
disappointed about how the Qt4/Qt5 situation was actually handled.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Just like we don't know if QtWebEngine will be in a good-enough state
soon enough :)

If I'm not mistaken, QtWebEngine mainly misses functionality for
vectors, so it's a problem for map canvas items. Anything else (plugin
manager etc) could be switched over to web engine. For plugin devs,
QtWebEngine can be made available in parallel to QtWebKit.
In general I think our API doesn't directly offer much (any?) webkit
related things. So we can just switch the engine for map canvas/print
composer items under the hood when/if QtWebEngine fully supports our
requirements?

By the way Bas - If I'm coming across as annoyed it's because I am.

But it's not at you or our distro partners! I'm annoyed at Qt upstream
for both the web view situation and for the predicament that
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-47192 has put us in (a broken
application on Qt 5.5 and 5.6 which we can't work around).

I totally realise that you're also a volunteer and put in difficult
situations because of the choices we as upstream make. Thanks for all
the hours you've put into supporting this project behind the scenes.
It's VERY much appreciated.

Nyall

Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A2805C578C333@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hello,

I'm trying to use the Georeferencer plugin in QGIS but when I click Raster/Georeferencer/Georeferencer to open the tool, nothing happens. I get no error message nor any message in the log-message-panel.

I have QGIS 2.16.1 installed from the QGIS webpage and QGIS master + 2.14.6 LTR from OSGeo4W - all 64bit.

Can I get a hint on what to try?

Regards, Casper

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing C++ algorithms
Message-ID: <22e01228-76de-fa8a-41dc-7af0246f9699@opengis.ch>

Hi,

If one wants to create a C++ processing algorithm, is there any
preferred way to ship it? I don't think we are doing that yet apart from
calling 3rd party tools.

The possible approaches I can see are

 * Add a new QGIS module "algs" next to gui/core etc and use
   it's python bindings to call the code from a small python wrapper.

 * Port some processing core classes to C++, mainly GeoAlgorithm,
   outputs and parameters (and possibly some dependencies).

 * Ship it as a separate module and do it all the grass/saga etc. way.

Context is, I will probably need this on QField with no python. I could
do it without processing there but since the trend is to processize
whatever possible, I thought it would be a good opportunity to bring
this subject to the table.

Matthias

So it would sit between core and gui (ie no widgets)?

I'd lean this way, but am wondering why not just put the code in core? What
specific algorithms do you have in mind?

Since yesterday's update to QGIS Master  none of my file open or save dialogs work anymore. I have to use the Browser panel to load layers and when saving I have to type in the full path manually.

This is on Ubuntu 16.04, QGIS 2.17.0 code revision cc3a053.
Anyone experiencing the same problem?

Regards, Frank.

That should go into a separate module. I'll need to ship different QML
widgets instead.

Separation of concerns ;)

Basically rendering tiles into a geopackage.

First... thank you Nyall to rise up the argument.

second... I had to plugin heavely using QWebKit... but basing on this:
https://wiki.qt.io/Porting_from_QtWebKit_to_QtWebEngine
It wouldn't be a problem get rid of webkit and use directly webengine.
The use of QTextBrowser is not an option for that plugins.

I didn't dig into QWebEngine rendering limitations, so I don't have
opinions about this.

cheers

Hi Frank

I was notified about a similar problem yesterday. Are you able to tell
when the last "good" state of code was?

Just in case, I had similar troubles in an unrelated Qt app recently. In
that case I had the feeling that it was triggered by a browser (chrome)
running at the same time some expensive javascript operations.
This might give a possible lead or be just some random misinterpretation
from my side.

Matthias

I had the same thing 3 days ago with nightly packages. A reboot solved the problem and I disregarded it as random. 
But maybe its not.

Hi Matthias,

It doesn't seem to be related to Chrome. I rebooted my computer and then ran QGIS without any other programs running and the problem still occurs.

I haven't been running updates everyday but the last good state of code was git20160902 8688fef, which was installed on 2016-09-13.

Frank.

While I am convinced that it is negligible in this case here, if it
would mater it would be in favor of a C++ implementation because of
fewer context switches between python/C++. So not for this but for other
algorithms, such a change could theoretically make a real performance
benefit.

I think we are no longer shipping band-aid releases through the plugin
manager.
Just to make it clear: algorithms can still be implemented in python, I
don't mean to make any change on this front!!

Integration with the QGIS ecosystem. A 3rd party binary will not have
the same level of access to QGIS core functionality, it will need to be
maintained separately (e.g. API changes), pushed to all the distribution
repositories. In short: too much overhead and I can mostly discover
down- instead of upsides.

Hi all,
I'm getting systematic crashes when clicking on magnifier. 2.16.2 on
Debian sid. On Win, no crash. Anyone confirms, or is it a local problem??
All the best, and thanks.

Not sure if it's the same...but Alex Bruy and me are thinking about
wrapping core C++ plugins with Processing (mainly the heatmap/terrain
analysis/interpolation plugins). So if you have something new in the
form of a C++, you can also wrap it with Processing

Or what you mean is that you require Processing base classes to be
core adn c++? That could be interesting, and it shouldn't be hard for
the main non-GUI classes...but not sure how it would come up

Hi,

The combobox in the status bar?

Any chance to have a trace?

I am not experiencing any troubles with 2.16.2 on fedora.


Cheers,

Denis

I personally would advise against wrapping the heat map plugin in its
current form. It needs some major reworkings and much better separation of
ui/algorithm.

But I'd very much like to see the guts of this moved to core or analysis
(or potentially "alg"!) and it made reusable for plugins and processing.

Thanks for all the info and discussion, everyone.

I obviously need as fully-functioning a Qt web component as I can get for
the qgis2web preview pane, as I have to use it to run Leaflet and OpenLayers
3. I run into problems with the existing Qt Webkit missing functionality, so
I am extremely nervous that Qt WebEngine might have even less. Specific
concerns:

- the comment that vector rendering is less functional, obviously a concern
for my use case

- Luigi's link mentions that QgsNetworkAccessManager is not used by Web
Engine, so I'm concerned about use behind a proxy

Of course. I'm on a course now, I'd like to have confirmation it's not a
local issue before digging deeper.

Good to know. It mught be some lib misalignment then.

Thanks for the feedback.

I fully support this statement and would like to apologize for any
provoking comments I have done.

Please let me explain the situation from my side:

We have a very high amount of users which use QGIS for their daily work,
professional and for pleasure. They expect as little interruption as
possible doing their job. They don't actually care about Qt versions at
all. They work on a wide variety of platforms.

We have also a very large plugin ecosystem which needs to care about Qt
versions because they depend on the API. But they also are happiest if
there is as little change as possible.

QGIS 2.0 is not too long ago when there was a major API change. Doing
this too often will make people very unhappy.

There is also Qt upstream which started to develop Qt 5 quite some time
ago but didn't manage to make a clear plan for things like QtWebKit.
Lack of knowledge about the path of action there makes it not very easy
to take decisions on our end.

Then there are also distributions coming with a wide variety of
different versions of all kind of dependencies which we try to support
as good as possible from some 4 year old ones to the brandnew bleeding
edge ones.

Then there is us, putting a vast amount of volunteer time (besides the
funded time) into planning and implementing an upgrade that is as
comprehensive, stable and smooth as possible taking into account all the
different parties mentioned above.

In this scenario it is sometimes possible that there is a little
frustration sitting too easy if there is some pressure from one of these
parties to support something that is only on the short term radar (for
us at least), a problem not created by us and no real proper solution
available - just like support for QtWebKit in Qt4 on one Debian release.

Thank you very much for the time you have invested, it is very valuable
and much appreciated.

Kind regards
Matthias

Tyler, documentation has moved to qfield.org/docs
The OGR issues mentioned in the documentation are no longer valid.
Could you open an issue with a demo dataset concerning vertical datum on
https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Additional TIFF RASTER Problems
Message-ID: <CABPxTToN6n-e3GUameGuGwB113x-v+jVFXyw_qmhfU2ROudMkQ@mail.gmail.com>

There have been a lot of Raster issues mentioned with 2.16 lately and in
the case of Windows it has been associated with the 32-bit install.

There are also problems with the 64-bit install as well, but is not as
obvious. This test in using the 64-bit OSGeo4W network installer and
applies to 2.16.2.

If you open the "OSGeo4W" command shell and run gdalinfo on any TIFF image
you get a crash message saying:

"gdalinfo.exe has stopped working"

It gets partway though displaying the tiff information and shows the image
width and height but then it crashes. Interestingly, if you try this
with"OSGeo4W Shell" it seems to work. I am now sure what the difference is
between the two.

Do any of you get the same results?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi,
Germán, I neither can find any of these strings.

Devs, is that normal to not have texts from processing algorithms GUI not
available in Transifex while the algorithm name itself is available (e.g.,
Ordinary Kriging ...) to translation?

Interesting: it does not crash when run normally, neither directly nor
under gdb. It does when started with --configpath, even on a fresh,
empty dir.
Anyone confirms this?
All the best.

Confirmed, on debian 8, qgis-master.

QGIS crashes when i "unmagnify" (?) twice.

First time, no problem (100% -> 50%)

Second time, it shows 10% for a split second, and then QGIS crashes.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to remove the menus created by python plugin
 without running unload code?
Message-ID: <PS1PR06MB1244EE36910557B72A21B011D1F00@PS1PR06MB1244.apcprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi, All,

I am developing a plugin for QGIS. During the test, there are some bugs in the plugin, so the new menus have not be uninstalled properly. When I have fixed the bugs and run the plugin again, the new menus of the plugin are created, while the old menus created last time still exist.

Moreover, when I open the menu, "Setting-->Customization" window,  I saw the menus are all there. I tried to unclick the wrong menus and click "Apply" button.  However, when I restart the application, these unwanted menus still exist.

How to remove the menus created by the plugins uninstalled without the uninstall menu code?

Thank you so much for your help!

Best regards!
Liye

The DPI in QgsMapSettings is a double to allow small magnification scale
(i.e. zoom out) while QPaintDevice::logicalDpiX is an integer.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsmaprenderercustompainterjob.cpp#L73
This means that the application will crash if in Debug mode (not in
Release mode)

I am not sure if we can safely remove this.
Martin, may you have a look here?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

Hi all,

anyone knows are there any reason not to support 2.5D geometries in memory
layers? Currently, for example when pasting 2.5D geometries to memory layer
they converted to flat type potentially lossing information.

Are you sure the layer variables for the height and angle expressions are also set?

Hi Matthias,

sorry seems I was not clear. 2.5D geometries not renderer.
When you paster features from shapefile which has 2.5D
geometry type (e.g. Point25D)  to memory layer they
automatically converted to flat geometry type (Point), see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp#L7513

Message-ID: <CABWZyyr3WiLBatbKXd6bf3g44o6L6fZX=yxyghBTrRoeiObdpw@mail.gmail.com>

HI
Will I get hover events in a object that is inherited from QgsMapCanvasItem?
I created a class derived from QgsMapCanvasItem and implemented the three
methods hover events.

When instantiating the class I pass it a mapcanvas, and set the
acceptHoverEvents to true.
I also implemented the boundingrect method that returns the bounding rect,
and before I change the bounding rect, I am calling prepareGeometryChange
before updating the bounding rectangle.
I have also checked the hasMouseTracking setting on the mapcanvas and it is
set to true.
But when moving the mouse pointer over the object, no hover events is
coming in?
Should I get hover events, or is it "blocked" in the mapcanvas?

Regards
Theuns Heydenrych

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Developer for Pacific Island
Message-ID: <7ed9058f-9f6e-dd6a-0388-25be9fc48874@opengis.ch>

Hi everybody,
I'd like to share with you all a great opportunity of hacking in Fiji.


We are looking for an advanced geospatial python developer to work on
innovative disaster resilience initiative in the Pacific Island
Countries (PICs).

Main tasks to focus on the PacSAFE open source application:
http://ict.sopac.org/pacsafe/index.html
PacSAFE is a desktop tool based on QGIS and InaSAFE plugin
http://inasafe.org/, designed and developed for non-GIS users.

PacSAFE has initially been developed to enable hazard data and asset
data to be used to general impact information to assist planning,
preparedness and response activities for Pacific Island Countries.
Initial development of PacSAFE has focused on inundation hazard exposure
(flood, coastal, tsunami).  The next phase of development will focus on
integrating PacSAFE  into the core InaSAFE project - and joining the
broader InaSAFE developer community and project.


Full time position to be based in Suva, Fiji at the Pacific Community
(SPC) Geoscience Divistion (http://gsd.spc.int/). Short term (~3 month)
to start with possibility of annual extensions up to 3 years based on
performance.


Project Objectives:
- Function as core committer to InaSAFE software development project
working collaboratively with multiple partners and promoting the needs
of the Pacific as part of the PacSAFE initiative. Develop documentation,
training materials;

- Developing and promoting open source GIS solutions, including
applications for field data collection, remote sensing analysis, and
customized solutions for disaster management needs.  Providing technical
training and mentoring to SPC staff, technical experts from PICs.


Qualifications:
- Bachelor’s degree or equivalent qualification and at least 5 years
professional experience in relevant field;
- A passion for open source and a background in geospatial technology
- Proven experience at contributing to open source GIS projects.

Please send CVs and questions to Marco Bernasocchi <marco at opengis.ch> to
receive additional information.

I've found that the context.coordinateTransform() can be null, so it is not a way of determining the layer CRS.

I'm not sure how well setting the CRS on renderer creation will work either, as it can be created from the UI, from paste style, from loading a style directly, etc...
It may be possible to catch a signal from layer changes (for all layers) to identify this.  Likewise a similar approach may be needed to access the map CRS :-(

Cheers
Chris

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Warning - shapefile corruption on 2.16/master and
	how to recover
Message-ID: <CAB28AsiBrvfNfEGvOKiDcz_8UoOKGCpWXNtORB+Utd9=hP55vw@mail.gmail.com>

Unfortunately a fairly nasty regression has slipped in to 2.16 and is
still present on master. This results in shapefile corruption in
certain circumstances.

While I've hit this issue maybe 3 or 4 times in the last 2 months, I
haven't been able to track down exactly what causes this. It seems
related to using the split or reshape tool on a shapefile, then saving
the changes and getting the errors "Cannot reopen datasource
xxx.shp|layerid=0 in read-only mode" and "Data source is invalid
(Unable to open xxx.shx or xxx.SHX.Try --config SHAPE_RESTORE_SHX true
to restore or create it)" in the log.

A full report is at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15570

Hopefully we can resolve this before the next round of releases. In
the meantime, there's a workaround for recovering data:

In the same folder as the shapefile there'll be additional files
"xxx_packed.shp" and "xxx_packed.shx". Renaming the "xxx_packed.shx"
file to "xxx.shx" allows the original shapefile to be reopened.

No - it's on Windows. And I can't reproduce it everytime, but it has

Well - it's actually a bug. The geometry shouldn't be getting fetched
here unless it's required. I looked into this a couple of weeks back
and there's a few issues in the caching mechanism which means it's not
being utilised correctly. I haven't had a chance yet to address these.

Hi,
Pietro, the WKT option is still available in Settings --> Options --> Data
Sources, and in the listbox "copy features as", select "Plain text, no
geometry".

HTH,

geez... this unfortunately sounds familiar... remember all the issues
with deleted features and shapefiles opened in software other than
QGIS?

Can this be something related to that?

@Nyall
Thanks, it would be nice if it will be fixed in next releases..
Other nice thing would be the possibility to select if we want to fetch the
geometry column, and which geometry column opening attribute table..

A user could add more than a single geometry column in a postgis table, for
example full resolution- half, a quarter etc.. with a trigger to update the
lower resolution ones after a geometry update.
This could be usefull in web publishing applications..
Now we are using Lizmap and I create some materialized views to create
visualization by scale in my project. Having more than one geometry column
(not fetched loading attribute table) could lower the mess and maintenance
(refresh materialized views etc)..

@DelazJ
Thanks, I didn't see it
Anyway selecting "Plain text, no geometry" don't fix the fetching of the
geometry column opening attribute table and copy/paste it..

Cheers
Pietro

There was another report of Shapefile corruption earlier with 2.14 which I thought it could be side effects of the solution for #11007:

well,  but today  a SHP is not so important   ;)

Serioulsly,  do you have some  plugin active ?   Do you tested with
"--NOPLUGINS"  option active ?
Do you can try renaming  .qgis2   directory,  so that we are sure  QGIS  do
no use it ?
And what is the result ?

Please, let us know.

Ah.. Purely a QGIS thing, but not completely internal in the meaning that it 
can be used by code building a connection string (eg in unit tests) and it is 
actually documented in http://qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorLayer.html#details

So if we wanted to change that we should probably accept the old value as 
well.

Hi Nyall,
I have been using 2.16 in a 3 week summer class. We have been using these functions, and not seen the described errors.
We use OS : Windows 7 and 8 - the MAC users was using 2.14

Is it on Linux you get the errors ?

Emne: [Qgis-developer] Warning - shapefile corruption on 2.16/master and how to recover

Unfortunately a fairly nasty regression has slipped in to 2.16 and is still present on master. This results in shapefile corruption in certain circumstances.

While I've hit this issue maybe 3 or 4 times in the last 2 months, I haven't been able to track down exactly what causes this. It seems related to using the split or reshape tool on a shapefile, then saving the changes and getting the errors "Cannot reopen datasource
xxx.shp|layerid=0 in read-only mode" and "Data source is invalid (Unable to open xxx.shx or xxx.SHX.Try --config SHAPE_RESTORE_SHX true to restore or create it)" in the log.

A full report is at http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15570

Hopefully we can resolve this before the next round of releases. In the meantime, there's a workaround for recovering data:

In the same folder as the shapefile there'll be additional files "xxx_packed.shp" and "xxx_packed.shx". Renaming the "xxx_packed.shx"
file to "xxx.shx" allows the original shapefile to be reopened.

Nyall

I just tried to reproduce with QGIS 2.16.2 on Windows 10, I had no 
problems using the "Split Features" tool on a shapefile, and saving. I 
notice that the .dbf .shp .shx were modified properly.

(I did have a brain lapse to remember that the Split Features tool lives 
in the /edit menu ha)

One of my hypothesis is some bad interaction with the "connection pool".
Could you (or anyone) open the attribute table before doing the edits,and do 
the edits and commit them no more than 60 seconds afterwards ? I'm not sure 
but this might perhaps also require the shapefile to be big enough (several 
thousands of features).

hmm, still works with 1000 features.  Will look for a bigger test.

Here was my next test:

- download OSM land polygons for the world, unsplit: 
http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/land-polygons-complete-4326.zip 
424MB   568,635 features  <--- big test!

- add shapefile to QGIS 2.16.2 view

- open attribute table

- start editing

- after a while waiting for nodes to appear as QGIS works, message is 
displayed of "qgis-bin.exe has stopped working"

With QGIS 2.14.0:

- exact same issue when starting editing of that layer

With QGIS 1.8.0:

- able to click start editing and no crash as nodes are displayed for world

- able to use "Split Features" and save edits

- seems to write changes to .dbf .shp .shx (to be honest, changes don't 
look like a valid feature split, hard to tell, but it seems a few more 
feature records were added)

You likely aren't happy that I tried with such large of a file, but, it 
was honestly the first big file that I found.

====
other test for fun:

- checked layer summary through ogrinfo
- indexed the .shp with the shptree utility (generates 22MB .qix index 
file, wow)
- created a small MapServer mapfile with only that layer, for world extents
- generated map image through MapServer, recording layer draw speed (cool!)
- tried to compare that speed, to QGIS 2.16.2 loading that same 
shapefile (doing both a same time)

Fun results!  Any guess how MapServer did?  :)

Honestly I didn't plan to check that, and that is not why I tried to 
help here, but when I saw QGIS having a hard time with this large file, 
on a 16MB RAM new machine, I thought 'hmm i wonder how MapServer would 
handle this huge file?'   For one of the previous WMS Benchmarking 
exercises at an old FOSS4G event I tested with a 1GB shapefile, and we 
had to fix the indexing for MapServer...so it is good to try to push 
limits once in a while.

sorry if i offend anyone with these tests, was just having some fun 
pushing MapServer as well.

Let me know if you need more tests.

it would be fun, yet make no sense to technical people, to compare 
MapServer WFS output or WFS-Transaction requests, versus other tools 
like QGIS editing.  But that is apples vs oranges and could never be 
agreed upon by development teams (or any sane person).

Anyway, I was just having some fun pushing MapServer.

I hope those tests are somewhat useful!

I just ran a test

Ubuntu Linux
QGIS 2.16.2
Shapefile with 925,000+ polygons

I opened the attribute table which took a bit.
Started editing.
Split 5 polygons.
Saved.
Stopped editing.
Removed the layer.
Added it back - it didn't corrupt.

I'm wondering if I should have done something more deliberate like 
delete or add more polygons.

Whee, Thanks Mathieu for pinging me!

YES this fixes my laptop (for master)! I was getting mad of the fan
which kept blowing...

@Nyall: can this also be cherry picked to master_2 ?

It's not in it yet?:

Randy, can you try with the osm-lands shapefile that I linked to in my 
message?  I'm curious how it works on other systems.  This problem could 
just be on Windows it sounds like.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] best way to provide a python lib to both plugin
	and processing?
Message-ID: <6b3f5e17-778c-7a2e-2caf-6e226ee254dd@duif.net>


Hi,

I have a python plugin in which one of the core functions is to retrieve
some data via a custom protocol.
Let's call this a 'data-provider'.

It could be handy if we could also use that data-provider in a
processing script or model.

So Question: how to distribute/create a python library which can be used
in both plugins and processing?

Should I do that via pip?

Or is a module in a plugin the best way (as that is I think easiest to
get 'installed' by users)?
But is that module then easily available in processing scripts?

Or should I create a processing geo-algorithm for it? But then my
question is: how to distribute that easily?

Do we have some 'api' that a processing script is supposed to use?
Maybe it is possible to create a generic 'api' to make it easy to load
libs for plugins/processing?

(Maybe even the same with the little dialog which is used: how to
provide/distribute that one)

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

I have a problem using xvfb with qgis server on ubuntu xenial: 

* QGIS server 2.16 on trusty with xvfb 2:1.15.1 works well as described by
  Alessandro: http://www.itopen.it/qgis-server-setup-notes/ . We use it to
  render HTML in GetPrint.

* QGIS server 2.16 on xenial with xvfb 2:1.18.3 doesn't work. It doesn't
  crash but the HTML part stays empty. It seems that the xenial xvfb
  package doesn't work together with current qgis server.

Do others have similar experiences?

Message-ID: <f0449470-b76a-db42-ab06-b60e4acb6564@duif.net>

Hi,

testing Python3/Qt5 I get the following message:

  File
"/home/richard/apps/qgis3/master/debug/share/qgis/python/plugins/processing/tools/vector.py",
line 34, in
    import cStringIO

According to:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30377620/python-3-4-cstringio-vs-stringio

there is no cStringIO anymore in py3

do I miss a compile/install step or isn't processing not yet ready to
use yet?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This error means that your python files have not passed through 2to3. Make
sure PORT_PLUGINS flag is turned on.

Also right now, the make script only runs 2to3 against the python code
inside the output directory, it does *not* do so for the python code copied
to your install location during "make install". You either can run QGIS
from your output directory, or (as a temporary ugly hack) copy the content
of the python folder in your output directory onto your installation's
/share/qgis/python directory.

Hope that helps.

Ah cool, yes you are right. From output is ok.

Apparently the 2to3 just works but the script is ran after the install
step? Because the vector.py in the output dir IS fixed...

Yep. The probem has to do with make install copying python files from the
source tree not the output directory (therefore not benefiting from 2to3)

Message-ID: <008801d211ec$3e87ffe0$bb97ffa0$@gmail.com>

All,

 

I was wondering if anyone knows of a current method for displaying geotagged
images (or maybe just a thumbnail) directly on the map canvas without having
to click on one image a time? I saw this thread, but the solution seems to
be deprecated now:
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Showing-thumbnails-of-geotagged-photos-t

Thanks,

Hi all,
we have an opportunity to become an early implementer or reference
implementer for WMTS 1.0. I think one of the companies around QGIS could
take this as an opportunity to increase commercial opportunities.
In case, please let us know.
All the best.

​Hi, you could use this snippets :
https://gist.github.com/mdouchin/d66191ccfadd74cff3f0

Basically, it loads an image for each feature in a SVG, which can then be
used as a symbol.

Hi, 

According to the roadmap on www.qgis.org, the 2.17 feature freeze is
already in place, but I did not see an announcement from Jürgen. Will
the feature freeze be postponed? 

Just wondering if the Cluster renderer from Nyall could still go into
2.18 - it seems to be almost finished. 

Greetings,
Andreas

please more context, do you refer to xyz tile core support dev by

"one of"... please be more explicit

about what specifically? documentation, dev, testing, writing tests,

Message-ID: <1c0cab62-121b-5f3c-0c39-93670901f49c@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
apparently QGIS desktop accepts (ugly) accented characters as column
names for shapefile dbf, and everything seems to work smoothly. The same
files however are not displayed in QGIS sever when that field is used
for classification. I have clear accented chars should not be used, bnut
the current behaviour seems surprising, and should better be avoided. Am
I wrong? Opinions?
All the best.

Hi,
@Paolo, imho a pull request (most recommended way to contribute to docs
now) would have been better, either to ease any improvement on the content
and to avoid some errors on doc writing (I added some comments to your
commit).

Hi, 

Sorry for joining the discussion late. 

I agree that QgsComposerLabel should be moved to QTextDocument. 

For QgsComposerHTML: How about the proposal to package the revived
QTWebkit (http://qtwebkit.blogspot.com.au/2016/08/qtwebkit-im-back.html)
along with QGIS, just as we are doing with other libraries? At least
until QtWebEngine delivers the features we need? 

It would also be less distribution dependent and probably save us a
number of support headaches. 

On the other hands there would be the additional packaging work.

Message-ID: <8231b421-a73b-fe01-1be1-dd66b899792b@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi all, sorry for cross posting, but I guess porting plugins to QGIS3 is
a very wide topic.
 
I'd like to make you aware of a plugin that we just released that gets
you to write your python plugins code only once and get QGIS 2.8 - 3 and
PyQt4 -5 support.

QGIS2compat targets two main use cases.

PyQt compat
If you still need to rely on QGIS < 2.14 writing from qgis.PyQt will not
work for you as the qgis.PyQt package is simply not there. And this is
one of the two use case where QGIS2compat can help you. This feature is
complete.

QGIS 2-3 API compatibility
The other use case of QGIS2compat plugin is the availability of a QGIS
API compatibility layer which lets you write your code for QGIS 3 API
and it will take care of adapting it to the QGIS 2 API. This feature is
an ongoing work in progress since we are in the middle of API breakage
period. So we do need your help to keeping adding new apicompat fixes.

Here some more details.
http://www.opengis.ch/2016/09/19/qgis2-compatibility-plugin/
here the code: https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2compat
and here the plugin http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QGIS2compat/

For now I marked it as experimental, so please go test it out and let us
know how it works.

Also, please contribute APIcompat stuff as explained in the docs.

ciao
Marco

Note that you could also add a symbolic link in .qgis-dev to output dir, 
example :

ln -s <build-dir>/output/python/plugin/* $HOME/.qgis-dev/python/plugins/

And it should load processing plugin from output dir.

No need to make recurrent copies to install dir after that.

I hSorry, I had the wrong url for the plugin
the correct one is (all lower case, non QGIS2compat):
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2compat/

to the 30 people that already downloaded it. sorry you'll have to reload
the qgis repository in te settings.

Well, I usually don't (pre-)announce feature freezes (other than (usually) way
upfront in the roadmap and as countdown on the website).

I don't have a strong opinion on the date, but it's what we agreed on in Bonn.

Hi Paolo,

I'm also a little puzzled by our message :-)

We already had WMTS 1.0 in QGIS for a long time isn't it?

I understand now from Luigi's reply that Martin added a lot of new
stuff, and restructured a lot. But here in NL the free national WMTS
services (aerials and topo) have been used a lot already.

I added a comment on the https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3473 about
the native resolutions.

Also wondering how this works with the tile scale slider.

Regards,

Richard

ok - thanks. Yes - we decided this date in Bonn. 

No worries. Nyall told me that the cluster renderer will be 3.0 only
anyway. 

So from my side no needs to postpone. 

Thanks for clarifying,

Paolo forwarded a mail about that to me earlier - basically it was a
call from OGC to run their recently developed compliance tests for
WMTS with existing implementations and basically to help testing the
tests:
http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/about/wmts/1.0.0/site/

By helping out with OGC WMTS test suite, one can be recognized as a
reference implementation or be mentioned in their press release.

I am not sure if this applies to QGIS at all, those tests are for WMTS
server side. We have client WMTS support, but as far as I know there
is no WMTS support in QGIS server.

Yes :)

I have added my comments to the pull request.

Note: the work I have done and the call that started this thread are
not related in any way...

BTW, I think it would be good to expand on this; in general, the project
would gain from a closer relation with OGC, updating constantly our
listing, seeking certification where possible, etc.
I think this would be most suited for commercial firms around QGIS,
rather than for the main project itself - our limited resources could be
better spent in infrastructure, bugfixing, etc.
If some of them is interested, please speak out.
All the best.

Ah, ok.

I had a good look now: nice! Very smooth!

So in the browser you can add a xyz layer like: 
http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

But isn't there a way to do that via 'add Layer' menu or via the 'add 
WMS/WMTS' button? Do I miss something ( or is it "future work" as they 
call it in science ;-) )

(Just asking because I think we already have several ways to add a layer 
(buttons, menu's, dragdrop, browser), and if some of those ways have 
other options then the others, I think from a user standpoint this is 
not very friendly?)

The add WM(T)S dialog's could get some ui-love anyway I think :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

and while we are into OGC/web-interfaces, anybody busy with adding 
native WMS-T yet (yes, I know there is the timemanager, doing fine, but 
I'm also hoping that the time (or other) dimensions could maybe become a 
native citizen of QGIS

in PyQt4 right?

it will newer work since QtWebKitWidgets is defined only in PyQt5.

the plugin should use qgis.PyQt or the QGIS2compat plugin. thanks for
giving me a show of case just the day after the release ;)

the problem is in
https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_sharing/blob/develop/resource_sharing/gui/ui/resource_sharing_dialog_base.ui#L598

Indeed - something for others to pick up hopefully :-)

Yeah the WM(T)S dialog could get a lot of love... It is quite
complicated and the user experience is not great.

I am not sure XYZ layers should be even handled within WM(T)S dialog -
there is nothing like GetCapabilities, layer/style/crs selection etc.

XYZ layers would still deserve some kind of configuration GUI - apart
from URL, users should be able to set min/max zoom levels. The current
solution was just a quick way to make XYZ layers available to users...

Hi all,
when adding a newly discovered WMS/WMTS layer from Metasearch, the
GetCapabilities takes a long time and fails. The sme entry, once added,
works fine. Anyone confirms?
BTW, after some usage, I'm still convinced that giving the same default
name to all connections added is not very practical: can we design a
better solution?
All the best, and thanks.

For the UI side of things, I'd also like to see {QuickMapServices,
OpenLayers} updating its code so that - on QGIS >= 2.18 - layers are served
as native TMS support. That'd make pre-existing users of those plugins able
to continue using the same UI as before, while benefiting from Martin's
phenomenal work (raster manipulation support, rotation support, progressive
rendering, etc.).

Unless we have a feature parity with the current openstreetmap tool
(offered through vector -> openstreetmap), please do not drop it. One
useful feature that isn't available through OGR (or QuickOSM last time I
trieD) is the exporting of individual tags as fields (versus only creating
a few fields and an "other_tags" field).

Right - Mathieu, could you please open tickets on their respective
bugtracker? I'm sure suggesting a way to do it will greatly speed up the
process.

FYI, QuickOSM is not creating the "other_tags". There is a special parser
in the plugin to create individual fields.

Hello,

What is the recommended workflow to fix bugs in exiting releases.

Should I make a pull request on each branch (2.16, master_2 and master) ?
Or is there a precise workflow to backport fixes in existing releases ?

Best regards

Message-ID: <a6a6c27c-2cf1-3c7b-9e50-0b3e72cbbeec@gmail.com>

Hi guys..

I built qgis master2 (ubuntu xenial) and I noticed that it is not
possible to save models of Processing.

When I try to save the model the dialog of the file manager appears but
it freezes and nothing happens.

With old models already saved I can edit them and correctly save them,
so it happens just with new models.

Somebody confirms this issue or is just a problem of my computer?

Thanks

Matteo

I cannot confirm on the same qgis version on Ubuntu using a WCS layer
from a Geoserver instance. I can't test other server backends at the
moment.

this sounds familiar too... this is exactly how the editing workflow
of geopackage layers gets broken

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15351

is this just coincidence?

I'm going to work soon on this GPKG issue. On surface, it looks similar to the 
shapefile issue, but technically file locking and sqlite database locking use 
different mechanisms so the solutions will be likely different.

Hello,

I just completed a source installation of QGIS 2.16.2 on Mac, using a modified version of the Homebrew osgeo4mac/qgis–214 formula. I was particularly excited to try out the new globe plugin. QGIS builds correctly and is usable, but the globe plugin appears to be totally disabled, and doesn’t show up in the plugin directory or menu.

I built the formula with globe enabled (the Homebrew —with-globe option translates to —DWITH_GLOBE=TRUE —DOSG_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/osgPlugins-3.4 compile options. I’m running osg 3.4 and osgearth 2.7. Both of these are built using homebrew formula, with qt support, and I think they are within the range of supported dependencies for the globe plugin.

In the “advanced” settings menu, there is a section for globe plugin settings, but I cannot see any other feedback that the plugin is installed.

Any insights on what might be disabling the globe plugin, and how I could compile QGIS in order to include this? I’ve successfully used my install of osgearth to view GIS data described by raw *.earth files, so I think it’s unlikely to be a dependency issue.
Thanks, Daven

This looks correct and osgearth 2.7 is the supported version for QGIS 2.16.

You have to activate the Globe plugin in "Manage and install plugins..." and 
then you should get a menu entry Plugins -> Globe -> Launch Globe.

Would be great to hear that the globe is also running on Mac!

Hi Daven

Does this mean in the plugins menu or in the list of plugins in the 
plugin manager? If the former, please check the plugin manager an make 
sure the plugin is enabled. With the plugin enabled, a globe icon should 
also appear in the plugin toolbar.

Hope this helps
Sandro

Hi Nathan, 

Yes - in Bonn it was decided to do a 2.18 release. 

There are a number of new features in master 2. 

The plan is also to have 2.18.x releases which will add DXF/DWG CAD
import support and Geopackage improvements (through OGR). Jürgen and
Evan will work on these. Both of these features couldn't make it into
2.17.

here, on any qgis version > 2.8.* loading the only layer in this
service (on both Windows and Linux) causes QGIS to crash.

This must be reported as regression. Please file a ticket.

It seems that the above service is based on Mapserver, this could be
important as a quick test with WCS layers from Geoserver do not cause
the crash, but maybe a factor could be the datasource of course.

When loading the layer on 2.8.* the identify works as expected.

Hi,

A big other question: will this release be a LTR ? I am sorry to reopen
Pandora box, but this is a question often asked by users during courses.
They would prefer to have the last 2.* as LTR, before the big changes, in
order to keep their plugins and projects "safe" before 3.0.
Or perhaps it is too soon, as we do not know yet if there will be a 2.20 ?

Regards
Michaël

Hi Michaël,

At the moment 2.14 is LTR (you probably know ;) ) and I would dissuade
from declaring another one. Here is the reason:

At least I would strongly suggest we deal with 2.18 as the latest
release in the 2.x series. But we don't know for sure, suddenly a 2.20
might pop up for whatever reason (fingers crossed there's none!)

We will continue to backport fixes to the current latest 2.x branch
(2.16 now, 2.18 soon), so at any point in time when we spot 3.0 arrival
we can declare the latest release (again, hopefully 2.18 :) ) at that
time to be LTR.

2.14 is still young. LTR was introduced for stability and infrequent
updates.

Still, this has also been discussed at a recent meeting with some people
from the Swiss User Group. Just so you know you are not alone.
I actually welcome it when (organisation) users discuss these kind of
things because LTR was introduced for them by the project. Turning this
thing around and having organisations as a solid base for the LTR (and
offer targetted funding for this) gives the LTR much more sustainability
and credibility.
I would greatly appreciate a group of (non-developer) organisation
representatives strengthening the LTR idea!

Best
Matthias

Message-ID: <6bd734ad-264e-40f7-2a47-e0ce0fa63cd0@duif.net>


Hi,

having a plugin which creates point features in a memory layer, and we
created a custom expression to return html from the (complex, json
containing) attributes to be shown as a maptip.

on my development machine: QGIS master on Linux this works flawless
(really cool using those custom expressions brought in via plugins!)

but on the client machines: Windows7 running QGIS 2.14 (LTR) it just is
not very reliable:
- if it is the first layer, the maptips just do not show, even not if I
make it a simple field-maptip. Sometimes after some fiddling with the
maptips it works suddenly
- if I first load a vector layer, do some maptipping on it and then load
my memory point layer, those maptips also work...

Is the memory layer a problem?
Is it the custom expression?

Ringing a bell at somebody?

How to debug such problems?

I will try to mimic it with a smaller dataset and non custom
expressions, but just wanted to ask here, hoping somebody would tell:
nope just install 2.16.3... if it is there, then it is fixed :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Sandro,

It is not listed anywhere in the plugin manager to be enabled or disabled. All other plugins I am accustomed to seeing in that list are there (629 in total) but “Globe” is nowhere to be found, unless it resides under some non-intuitive name. So, no opportunity to enable the plugin in the usual way.

Thanks,
Daven

Is the library being built? I.e. under Linux it is

lib/qgis/plugins/libglobeplugin.so

If yes, look at the debug output of qgis when starting and you should be 
able to see some info about why the plugin is being rejected.

Thanks a lot Matthias and Jürgen for your answer. We should then make sure
bugfixes are backported into 2.14 (no example in mind, just a thought in
this complex context of 2 masters and multiple versions to handle for devs).

There's a consistent stream of commits going into 2.14

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/release-2_14

But any heads up on forgotten backports are appreciated.

And yes, it is a complex situation :)

Make the broken OSM importer optional.

I agree that we shouldn't ship broken things like this.

Just a sidenote, I'm always very careful when reading "from a user
perspective" as an argument in a discussion.
I'm still looking for "the user" and the person who knows "the users
perspective" and couldn't find those two yet ;)

All the best
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Discussion on the QGIS grant proposals
Message-ID: <5be9c03ece5dfb2e470800884941d828@carto.net>

Dear QGIS users, developers, voting members and user group
representatives, 

As you may have noticed, there is a first round of a QGIS grant program,
fueled by the donations and sponsorship money we received in the past
months. Tim Sutton, chair of the QGIS project, has publicized this
program repeatedly on several channels. 

The good thing is that we got some very good proposals. In total 18
proposals, adding up to a total grant sum of 101 k EUR. You can see all
proposals at
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B__vDnQXCKiwYTIyWmRSbi1hMWM/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1474526025402000&usg=AFQjCNFhp43Lkxw3aBCed9-9luJpnR0oWg


Please note that we can only spend 20k EUR in this first round. So there
are tough decisions to make. Note that proposals that can't make it in
the first round, can be kept in a waiting list and may apply again in
the next round of a grants program. If a proposal can't be accepted in
the first round, this doesn't mean it isn't valuable and useful to the
QGIS.ORG project. 

The QGIS PSC will honor the opinion of the voting members, the OSGEO
representative and the user group representatives on how to spend this
limited money wisely. Alltogether a group of currently 27 people (13
qgis user group represenatives, 13 community voting members, 1 OSGEO
representative). This is kind of the "parliament" of the QGIS project
when it comes to such decisions. 

------------------------------------------------------ 

Now comes my personal position/opinion - note that this is not the
official opinion of the QGIS.ORG board. 

I would personally welcome, if this round of the QGIS grants program
could focus on the QGIS 3.0 release. 

I personally also think that the QGIS grants program, at least at the
current time, should not pay for development of new features (at least
not features visible in the GUI for the users). These features can be
"relatively easy" funded by companies and government organizations out
there. So our limited QGIS.ORG funds should be rather spent a) to
community work or b) infrastructure work or c) development work in the
core of QGIS, such as API modifications, code redesign - stuff that
isn't really visible to the users, but essential for the success of the
project.  

Documentation and PyQT documentation work is already budgeted in our
annual budget. The money for 2016 hasn't even been spent for both items.
So I think we should first use the budgeted money for such work. I think
that user and developer documentation should be an ongoing effort and
should be supported every year, und budgeted every year as such. We can
increase the documentation budget positions next year, should it be
necessary. In reality, it was more a lack of people willing to do the
work, rather than a lack of funding. So, I am happy to see some
proposals around documentation and developer documentation - so it seems
that we have some volunteers. I just suggest that we consider
documentation work separately and do it anyway - regardless of the
outcome of the voting on these items. 

Several proposals have a very limited local focus, only useful to one
single country, or a very limited subset of our users. I suggest that
such proposals could best be financed by local user groups or interest
groups. It can't be the purpose of the QGIS grants program to finance
such projects. 

----------------------------------------------------------- 

Here is my own personal list of priorities: 

​18)​ QGIS 3 ticket handling and API refactoring 

This is really time critical, and past discussions around QGIS 3.0 has
shown that there is a lack of project management work and coordination.
I regard this proposal as very useful for the QGIS 3.0 release. 

​11)​ Introduce everything necessary for QGIS3 to OSGeo4W 

The majority of our users are on Windows (like it or not). This is the
platform that matters most in our user base. The introduction of QGIS
3.0 means porting everything to newer libraries and means a lot of work.
This should be one of our main priorities. Jürgen does it works silently
in the background many days of work each year that go unnoticed. Jürgen
usually only hears complaints if something fails - maybe not so much
praise. Having Windows nightly builds and releases early on in the life
cycle of QGIS 3.x means that it can be well tested. So - also really
important to our project. 

​2)​ Implement a flexible properties framework in QGIS 

This is the kind of under-the-hood API changes and improvements I
mentioned above. Stuff that brings our project forward, but under the
hood - not visible for the user. This is the basis that later follow-up
work can than build upon and benefit from. Stuff that later can also be
funded by organizations/companies. Also time critical, to be done as
soon as possible. Early in the 3.x life cycle when API changes are still
possible. 

​14)​ Project / Map layer registry refactoring 

Similar reasoning like item 2) above. Under the hood, necessary API
improvements. Also time critical, to be done as soon as possible. Early
in the 3.x life cycle when API changes are still possible. 

-------------------------------- 

Now, the documentation items: 

​1)​ 2.16 Documentation 

​​16)​ PyQGIS Developer Cookbook update and maintenance 

15)​ PyQGIS Cookbook Review 

They add up in total to EUR 14k. I believe that all of the three 
deserve to be supported financially. We have budgeted 10k EUR in 2016
for documentation and PyQT documentation. 1.5k EUR have been spent so
far. So still 8.5k remaining. Together with the new 2017 budget I
believe that all of the three above items can be easily handled outside
of the QGIS grants program. Documentation should be an ongoing,
continuous and budgeted accordingly, outside of the grants program. 

------------------------------- 

What are your opinions? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hello,

Thanks Andreas for raising this topic and clearing up facts and giving
your position.
I agree 100% with what you stated, and I do think this is something
which should be emphasized much more, if not even constrained.

Some more notes below.

This is indeed the main challenge for QGIS in the coming months.
Focusing on all aspects of making QGIS3 a real thing should be our top
priority when confronted to choices.

We have numerous demands for new features with paid contract, and the
global pace of feature development in QGIS is really fast. The very
large majority of them are funded by clients.
Meanwhile, all tasks like refactoring, code cleaning, bug triaging,
infrastructure and long term core development efforts are really
difficult to get funded. Public sector organization generally can't pay
for this due to public tender bid constraints, and generally end-users
do not realize that this kind of work is at the same time necessary and
time consuming.
In my opinion, the role of QGIS organization, hence the QGIS Grant
program, is to compensate for this disequilibrium.

Documentation is crucial, and I am also fully in favor of having a
dedicated yearly budget to improve it. It should be stated in the QGIS
grant application call too.

+1 also

Since I have more or less the same priority list as Andreas, I will also
add a few comments below.

In my own priority order :

This is to me the most important item for QGIS3. Jef does a huge work,
something difficult and not the most passionating thing to work on. We
do need to have the platform stable and ready as soon as possible to
have feedback on QGIS 3 very early in the release process.

Disclaimer : This proposal is by Oslandia
We proposed this item exactly because we observed that we were lacking
project management efforts, and especially regarding the QGIS3 release.
Having time allocated for project management would improve developer's
coordination, and help better define the release roadmap, by having a
clearer view of required efforts, and risk analysis.

This is a long needed change, for which we have a good timeframe with
QGIS3. It opens to new features later on. I trust Martin to do a very
good work on this one.

I also consider this one important, but it may be introduced later on.

> What are your opinions?

Again, I am really in favor of having a strong rule for QGIS.ORG where
we state that the main priorities for the budget should be all work
related to lowering the (now high) technical debt of the project, and
improving the technical quality of the project ( code & infrastructure),
as well as documentation.

I remember that the poll showed that users wanted new features, but I
really think that the poll was biased :
- to a question "what do you want to get funded in next QGIS versions",
users will always prefer new features, it is shinier and easier to
comprehend since it is also easier to understand and actually see the
results
- generally, users have very little understanding of what technical debt
represent, and its impact on the long run for a software project
- they are usually not directly concerned by everything related to
software deployment & infrastructure, etc

There is still work to do to inform our users and funders on these
topics, and push forward all initiatives going in this direction.

Vincent

Just to clarify (since I'm not sure if it was explicitly noted in the
proposal) - this is more or less a happens-during-api-break or doesn't
happen at all type change. To do it and maintain existing api would
result in 1.5-2x the work required, and a horrible mixed api with many
deprecated methods for the lifecycle of 3.x.

Thank you for raising this Andreas,

What I wonder is to which degree the people/companies behind a proposal
should be considered. In particular about:

 * Their history within the project *

how much they did before for the project. I think that a grant can not
only have a direct impact by making a particular project happen but also
an indirect multiplier effect by keeping people motivated to stay on the
project.

 * Volunteer time *

Grant money could compensate for volunteer time spent by
some people. And foster the multiplier effect again.

 * Their suitability for a particular job *
How much they did in this area before and therefore can be expected to
successfully accomplish the job.

In particular I think we should pay attention to not attract individuals
that only pop up when there's money to be spent from the project and
then disappear again.

Regards
Matthias

Hi devs,
I thought it should have worked, given that Server delegates to each
layer's respective provider.
I haven't digged into the code and I couldn't setup a debug session yet,
but I wanted to know if it's working or not for others of you.

Developers,

We all know and appreciate .qml files. Some of us for shipping QGIS
styles some of us for writing QtQuick applications [1].

The second one become more important with Qt5 and so increase the risk
of confusing the two file types. We already have technical collisions of
the two file endings now [2]

To avoid this, I propose to rename .qml files to .qsl for QGIS 3.

Just to clarify - this would mean qgis 3 saves styles as "qsl", but would
be able to open both qsl and qml named files?

Hi Andreas,
thanks again for raising these important points.

Agreed, a critical point for QGIS future.

Agreed, that's one of the reasons we started this program.

It makes sense to me.

Fully agreed.

One other important point: the reason I originally proposed the grant
programme was to recognize the huge volunteer work several people are
donating to the project, and to help keeping their motivation high.

My suggestion is therefore to prioritize the projects by the people you
feel/know have contributed most to the project until now.

All the best.

I'm in favour in pricing principle, the reasoning is sound.

But what's qsl stand for?

And would the .qsl files than concentrate on styling and labeling and 
strip away the Field/Widget part, as well as other non-styling 
properties/settings?

.qsl (QGIS styling language ;-) )?

@Nyall: any relations with your new properties framework project?

Ah sorry. Mixed up things. It would be a simple rename - nothing else. 
To not collide with the other usage (the qt qml files).

I always thought it would be useful if the .qml export and import would 
be more modular - giving the user the option what parts of the 
information should be exported or loaded.

Currently, it is a wild mixture of different properties relating to a 
layer. Styling and non-styling stuff.

Then we would need yet another file format that also includes also field
widget configuration... And I'm not sure that's of wider benefit, so I
would just leave it all the same and rename.

In the future we can possibly offer more control when saving/loading
with some checkboxes what to save.

I almost agree for the reasons exposed...

almost because I'm not really convinced to mixup style with other
stuffs as exposed by Andreas. But I understand the problem to add more
and more file and style types.
In this moment we have a IMHO a serious interoperability problem
creating a defacto standard (with sld and their dialects) without a
lexical definition that allow style interchange abaount Arc$,
mapserver, geoserver and so on.
Sincerely I can't see a convergence in this moment... btw this is
another thread!


cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] standard way for custom plugin python dependencies
Message-ID: <CAAZUH4FkGgwjMR50y0Bmo+5zMiLxB=sMWUkOhiedpvKvJBoqEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

we've developed an (python) plugin for QGIS, which is somehow using (among
others) nice "requests" python library. We use it the standard way

import requests

But when we distributed the plugin to other computers, it turned out, they
do not have it installed.

Is there any standard way, how to distribute dependencies along with python
plugin? Something in metadata.txt? Some requirements file?

Thanks

Jachym

Hi Jachym,

Unfortunately not. This has been discussed and is something that will
certainly be added at some point but so far nobody implemented it
(basically because of its cross-platform nature I think).

Your possibilities are:

 * Document and print nice warnings
 * Ship the dependency packaged with your plugin
 * Fix it by adding dependency management in QGIS

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Table Manager discontinuation and missing French
	translator
Message-ID: <16206187.7NMqfJq8oJ@debian>

Hi folks!

I'm going to discontinue the Table Manager. It was always a dirty workaround, 
and nowadays (with recent QGIS versions and GDAL 2) numerous data corruptions 
are reported. As QGIS finally contains the Refactor Fields tool and doesn't 
need any external plugins, I believe it's the high time to kill the Table 
Manager. I'm going to release the final version that displays a farewell 
message pointing users to the Refactor Fields (and still works, beside that 
message). Of course if someone is willing to take the development and keep it 
up to date with the changing GDAL‚ I can abstain :)

Table Manager was translated into French, Russian and Ukrainian, so I'd like 
to ask the translators for help with that message. However... I can't remember 
who was the original translator. A massive shame on me, as it seems I didn't 
put any credentials anywhere! I don't know how could I overlook it :(( I 
apologize and promise to fix it as soon as we find the right persons.

I believe it was Maxim for Russian and Alex for Ukrainian, were you? But who 
made the French translation? Régis, maybe it was you or do you have any ideas?

Best regards

Borys

Just a note on usability:
Though even the Table Manager was not the obvious tool to manipulate  
attribute tables, cause it wasn't even installed by default, now the  
Refactor Fields function in Processing is even less visible to people.

It would be great if this function could be kind of hard-wired to the  
attribute table with a button (like the field calculator, formatting  
etc.). I think especially ArcMap-users (but not only) will struggle to  
find that function.

Cheers
Bernd

Hi Matthias,

Is there any pointer to the discussion? If it's possible for me to help, I
could may be make a proposal for next year GSoC on this :)

@Jachym: AFAIK, most plugins now just ship the needed libraries along with
it or ask the users to install them. There are some libraries that are
already shipped into QGIS from the core python plugins (e.g jinja), you
might want to check if what you need is there already.

A new metadata (external_deps: text) field was introduced for this purpose
but there is nothing implemented inside QGIS for now:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/commit/6546a2ab54fd01b6e94b921b610c31b619e99979#diff-536e872043014a84818f87dc640b2d4d

A common pattern seems shipping dependencies with the plugin as Python eggs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multiple Fields in R-Processing
Message-ID: <6553df63-594c-4995-4b65-2109a9ec149c@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have a small problem with the integration of the MultipleField
parameter in the R-Processing script.

The trial script is super simple:

##[R-Geostatistics]=group
##l=vector
##X=multiple Field l

>X

So I just want to understand how can I extract the single fields of the
parameter.

Doing so the script runs, but I always get the same error:



Source: "/tmp/processing510ec5d19fc74c0582fbe8983bd85e66", layer:
"1474548069.5615"
with 102 features
It has 6 fields
multiple Field l="Gruppo;SN"
Error: unexpected symbol in "multiple Field"
Execution halted


I tried several other combinations but I'm running out of fantasy.

With the selection parameter it is simpler:


##type=selection point;lines;point&lines

>type


and the output is 0 (so the first chosen).


The parameter can be accessed here:

import processing
from processing.core.parameters import ParameterTableMultipleFiel



Thanks guys

Matteo

New Python Wheels and Pypi now support binary packages. This becomes a
really useful and convenient tool to install dependencies, with
multi-platform support, without even having a compiler installed.

Making QGIS Python plugins as Python modules would allow to use all pip
and pypi insfrastructure really easily.

The proposed osgeo4w grant application by Jef could include the low
level required changes necessary to introduce this behaviour. Right now
pip is distributed by default in OSGeo4w, but since not all OSGeo4w
python modules are installed through pip (but through specific exe
installers), this may lead to installation problems ( names conflicts e.g.).

If this work is done, there still will be some work on the QGIS python
plugin interface, but _not_ reimplementing a package management system
in QGIS and use pip instead could be a good option.

Vincent

I could't agree more!

We definitely don't want to re-invent the (PyPi) wheel ;)

Go for pip, but still the external_deps field in metadata could be useful
to hold the content of REQUIREMENTS.txt, or a path to it.

For the multiple field you dont supply the fields or options. It takes
them from the parent layer and you can select several, instead of one,
as the PArameterTableField does

Hope this helps

Victor,

thanks for the super quick reply.

I still don't get how can I select the different single fields from the
output.

I mean, with the selection parameter all is straightforward.

In the example I wrote in the previous mail, how can I access the first
field of the multiple fields parameter?

Thank Victor for your time, if I manage how to do it, I will also
improve the documentation

Cheers

Matteo

why not package critical/missing dep with the plugin itself? import

Good idea.
What about adding a shorcut to the Vector menu, like it's now with the 
algorithms formerly available in fTools?

Jachym: fwiw request is included in master and release-2_16 branches respectively [1].

Having said this, a more streamlined approach to plugin management in QGIS
would make things much easier for long term support across distributions.

Message-ID: <94ee2b78-5635-2915-02cf-90bf8f30dc15@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I'd like to know if an escape character is defined for the LIKE operator 
in QGIS Expression.

If I take a look at the code src/core/qgsexpression.cpp:4343 no escape 
char is used
```
         if ( mOp == boLike || mOp == boILike || mOp == boNotLike || mOp 
== boNotILike ) // change from LIKE syntax to regexp
         {
           QString esc_regexp = QRegExp::escape( regexp );
           // XXX escape % and _  ???
           esc_regexp.replace( '%', ".*" );
           esc_regexp.replace( '_', '.' );
           matches = QRegExp( esc_regexp, mOp == boLike || mOp == 
boNotLike ? Qt::CaseSensitive : Qt::CaseInsensitive ).exactMatch( str );
         }
```
Do you think we have to add one ?

I cannot aggree more with Vincent !

I would add than supporting python virtualenvs could be a solution to the
package distribution problems under Windows.

Hello

Happy that users know about refactor fields.

+1 to add Refactor Fields in Vector menu processing default entries.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/eefeef573d544be5dac3f665b10a4b757762e900/python/plugins/processing/gui/menus.py#L19

Concerning the attribute table button,
note that Refactor Fields comes with a python plugin (if processing is 
installed with QGIS, it is not necessary loaded at runtime).
Not sure that we can easily add a button in attribute table from python 
plugin.

Maybe, I'm not sure but I remember you at the HF2009 already being 
surprised that people were still using Table Manager :)

I would happily translate your farewell message

Hi all,
I thought the configuration for OTB path has been made automatic.
However I just tried, got an error, added the path to otb cli, and
everything works fine.
Was I dreaming, or we have a regression here?
Thanks.

so, I was dreaming :)
pity however: is it difficult to add it? at least for standard packages,
they should be in a very predictable location (/usr/bin).
All the best, and thanks.

I disagree with this. A grant application is meant to give money for a
certain work. The background of the person applying for a grant has to
be taken into account for selection, for sure. But the grant itself
should be related to a work, and not to previous contributions.

If we want to recognize volunteer work and previous donations to the
project, then let's create a "QGIS contributor of the year prize" with a
dedicated amount of money offered, and vote for one every year. This
would be a nice way to keep people motivated.
But misusing a grant for work in this sense seems unfair to me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS Server] Maintain it and create a team
Message-ID: <25bba341-9db8-40eb-7bda-8918c76f72a7@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

The Qt4 and Python 2.7 is going away from QGIS master, following this PR:
Require python 3 and qt5 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3510

But a part of the project directly suffered of this: QGIS Server. As 
explain on the Pull Request 'Require python 3 and qt5', all the QGIS 
Server tests has been disabled. This means that QGIS Server is not 
maintained with automatic tests for QGIS 3.

So Mathias Khun has opened an issue about QGIS 3 API to remove QGIS 
Server from QGIS master.
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/63
The discussion is opened but I don't know if all the developpers are 
aware of this.

For our team, 3Liz (Michaël, David and I), the QGIS Server is a big part 
of the QGIS project and it will really be a pitty if it disappears. A 
part of the QGIS users are interesting in it because they can published 
web services directly from their work. So QGIS Server is a reason for 
them to use QGIS. Many users like the part of using QGIS desktop to 
configure easily many options for publication, and use WMS, WFS, WCS and 
event WPS with different clients (one of them is Lizmap).
We take much time (and about half of it without funds) to keep this 
feature alive and up to date with QGIS improvements, and are willing to 
continue down this path (we believe in it and have many good feedbacks 
from users)

We would like to raise interest around QGIS Server, and report here that 
this part of QGIS is really used in production by companies and research 
centers, and maintained by some devs, and not just a QGIS side project 
"for fun".

We just discussed with Alessandro Pasotti and we would like to create a 
team to maintain and discuss about the evolution of QGIS Server. We 
would like to use this opportunity to improve QGIS Server and make it 
more maintainable and granular.

Some questions to gather reactions :
* Who is interested in maintaining QGIS Server ?
* Who is interested in participating in  QGIS Server (code, ideas, 
review, tests) ?
* Please share any ideas to enhance (refactor) QGIS Server

Regards,
René-Luc D'Hont

Hi René-Luc

Thanks, better to have it on the mailing list than with the github comments.

Well, taking the constructive parts out of that discussion, I think it 
makes sense to take the opportunity to rewrite the server part 
completely (it will be a while until there are the same number of 
features as now )

Also, the code sould be moved it to a separate repo / project. The QGIS 
codebase is quite bloated now and move code out of if will be good. QGIS 
server is like a third party application using the core API.

 >We would like to raise interest around QGIS Server, and report here

Yes of course. Well, it can be used in production and be fun at the same 
time.

 >* Who is interested in participating in  QGIS Server (code, ideas, 
review, tests) ?

Sourcepole is of course also interested in a working server for version3 
and to have a working group for it.

Regards,
Marco

Does anybody have a rough idea of how much time would this involve?

This could also help solving a current issue: now using on a server
projects done with a different version of QGIS desktop is always a risk,
thus forcing people to keep older versions on the desktop, or do
relatively risky upgrades on the server. It  would be good to decouple
this using standard API and a predictable behaviour.
I also underline, however, the importance of releasing a fully
functional server in sync with QGIS 3.
All the best.

Hi QGIS Server devs,

I’m using QGIS server and find it quite convenient, since I can author map projects with powerful QGIS gui and get them published as OGC services right on-the-fly. I don’t think any other FOSS OGC servers out there can boast the same functionality. I’m not a QGIS Server committer, but I’d be happy to help testing new versions and providing feedback - like testing master builds and reporting bugs, regressions, etc.

One thought about the future improvements: most webmaps and GIS software utilise vector tiles now and Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT), recently adopted by ESRI, really became a de-facto standard. But unfortunately QGIS Server lacks implementation of vector tile creation and serving.
While QGIS has bleeding-edge desktop functionality, QGIS Server sadly stays behind progress here. IMHO adopting vector tiles (reading and most importantly creation) should be one of top priorities for future versions.
I know QGIS depends on GDAL mostly in terms of I/O, so it really should be solved on both GDAL and QGIS levels. But as far as I know GDAL dev community doesn’t have any particular plans to implement MVT driver (or, perhaps, they do?:).
Some work is going on the postgis side (https://gist.github.com/bjornharrtell/7f4b6c030d4faa63f99b1ceb6f3edcef <https://gist.github.com/bjornharrtell/7f4b6c030d4faa63f99b1ceb6f3edcef>).

Cheers,
Nick Lebedev

This is something I'd love to see in GDAL. As usual, plans are mostly driven 
by parties interested to make things happen and provide appropriate resources 
or funding.
That said, on the writing side, MVT is a special beast that mixes traditional 
vector concepts, as well as rendering considerations for generalization, 
subselection of attributes for lower zoom levels, etc.

But this goes a bit out of scope of the main topic of this thread ;-)

Hi all,
when creating a new field through Processing > Refactor fields, an
expression seems always required. I do not think this should be
necessary, because users sometimes want just to add a new empty column
to be filled afterwards.
Am I missing something?

Hello,

With the arrival of QGIS 3 what did you think about include the various
plugins for CAD in the core of QGIS?
ArcheoCAD, CADDigitize (mine), CadTools, Digitizing Tools, QAD, Spline,
and may be other offer identical functionality.

In my humble opinion, I think the creations of geometries (circle,
ellipse, rectangle, triangle, regular Polygon, etc.) of different
plugins can be included in QGis. If no one is on the project, if it
seems interesting and if I can be accompanied by a mentor, I can have
some free time to incorporate these features.

If you think it useful, I allow myself to present an integration suggestion.

Thanking you in advance for your return.

Loïc BARTOLETTI

PS: The next step may be to incorporate editing feature (trim/extend,
fillet/bevel, etc.)  from QAD, CADDigitize and other.

 Hi devs,

The Qt4 and Python 2.7 is going away from QGIS master, following this PR:
Require python 3 and qt5 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3510

But a part of the project directly suffered of this: QGIS Server. As 
explain on the Pull Request 'Require python 3 and qt5', all the QGIS 
Server tests has been disabled. This means that QGIS Server is not 
maintained with automatic tests for QGIS 3.

So Mathias Khun has opened an issue about QGIS 3 API to remove QGIS 
Server from QGIS master.
https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0_api/issues/63
The discussion is opened but I don't know if all the developpers are 
aware of this.

For our team, 3Liz (Michaël, David and I), the QGIS Server is a big part 
of the QGIS project and it will really be a pitty if it disappears. A 
part of the QGIS users are interesting in it because they can published 
web services directly from their work. So QGIS Server is a reason for 
them to use QGIS. Many users like the part of using QGIS desktop to 
configure easily many options for publication, and use WMS, WFS, WCS and 
event WPS with different clients (one of them is Lizmap).
We take much time (and about half of it without funds) to keep this 
feature alive and up to date with QGIS improvements, and are willing to 
continue down this path (we believe in it and have many good feedbacks 
from users)

We would like to raise interest around QGIS Server, and report here that 
this part of QGIS is really used in production by companies and research 
centers, and maintained by some devs, and not just a QGIS side project 
"for fun".

We just discussed with Alessandro Pasotti and we would like to create a 
team to maintain and discuss about the evolution of QGIS Server. We 
would like to use this opportunity to improve QGIS Server and make it 
more maintainable and granular.

Some questions to gather reactions :
* Who is interested in maintaining QGIS Server ?
* Who is interested in participating in  QGIS Server (code, ideas,

* Please share any ideas to enhance (refactor) QGIS Server

Message-ID: <5f03452b-f0d4-df67-9f6d-40df6cd11f43@duif.net>


Trying to create a plugin which retrieves data in a separate thread
(worker class using QgsNetworkAccessManager to be sure I use QGIS
network settings), AND make that worker class testable.

I happen to hit the assertion:

ASSERT: "smMainNAM" in file qgsnetworkaccessmanager.cpp, line 293

everytime. I have initialized the python env ok, both in the working
thread, and/or in the main(testing) thread:

    QCoreApplication.setOrganizationName('QGIS')
    QCoreApplication.setApplicationName('QGIS2')
    QgsApplication.setPrefixPath(os.getenv("QGIS_PREFIX_PATH"), True)
    QgsApplication.setAuthDbDirPath('/home/richard/.qgis2/')
    app = QgsApplication(sys.argv, False)
    app.initQgis()

init is ok, I get the right output from for example:
    app.showSettings()
So I reckon the authentication db is found
but the ASSERT keeps going of as soon as I try to do:
    QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()
To fire off a request in the worker thread.

Do you think it is the threading that is making this impossible for me?

What exactly is the assertion telling me?

Note that the PyQGIS initing info I have from

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13494#note-19

Where Martin Dobias says:

"In general, the QgsApplication API is extremely confusing - and I hope
we can fix it for QGIS 3.0. It derives from QApplication (IMHO bad
idea), it also handles init/exit and paths. The init/exit handling
should be ideally completely automatic with PyQGIS, hopefully avoiding
different possible ways how people init PyQGIS in the future."

So I'm also wondering if any work is done in this QGIS 3.0 respect?
(because I think I hit this complexity now :-) )

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

my company uses QGIS server for providing infrastructure GIS to communities. We are currently starting with the first customers, and losing QGIS server would require fundamental changes to our system.
So we are very interested in 1. keeping QGIS server 2. providing dev time & money to make sure this is maintained for the future.

We implemented some small changes (loading project configuration from database) & fixes (well, more "hacks", e.g. for working with project variables in QGIS server). I would be happy to provide these patches to anyone interested.

So, count us in on QGIS Server!

regards,
Tom

Some more head-wall-hitting...

If I understand correct, these two lines:

    qgs = QgsApplication(sys.argv, True)
    qgs.initQgis()

Do both the starting of the QGIS/Qt machinery and the setup of the
authentication/networking system, and this is to be done in the main
thread. That is: you need to be do the right initing before you are able
to use a:

  QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()

So my plan to create QObject-based dataproviders to be able to start
them in separate threads doing network things via
QgsNetworkAccessManager is not possible, because... to get an instance
of QgsNetworkAccessManager in a separate(!) worker thread you need the
working (inited) QgsApplication there.

BUT you cannot create an instance of it there, because it is not the
main thread :-(

Am I right?

Is there another solution possible to use the QgsNetworkAccessManager to
do data handling in separate threads?

Can I pull the main-thread environment into the worker thread or so?

Side note 1: the reason I want to use QgsNetworkAccessManager instead of
urllib2 or request based networking, is that I was at a 'corporate'
client who was behind a corporate firewall using a
kerberos-username/password authentication. And all plugins using
QgsNetworkAccessManager just worked there... while all(!) others just
fail (because both request and urllib2 do not have kerberos inside??).

But apparently I need help to get both the QgsNetworkAccessManager and a
separate thread working...

Side note 2: this proxy seems also be an issue for GDAL:
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/5212 (old issue...)

I really hope 3.0 will make things easier for users behind firewalls,
maybe by forcing plugin network traffic to use QgsNetworkAccessManager
or so. Because current situation in which plugins do not work because
they use homegrown network code, not taking proxies/usernames into
account, is not a working situation.

Thoughts?

Regards,

Richard

This seems to have changed:

  diff qgis-2.14/cmake/FindQCA.cmake qgis/cmake/FindQCA.cmake

It looks like qca-qt5 is not packaged for ubuntu 14.04,
can I disable it ?

Instead of disabling it, consider upgrading to xenial which has much
better support for Qt5, unlike trusty which is quite old now.

It's great that Ubuntu LTS are supported for 5 years, but their
usefulness for development diminishes over time.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Some time ago, I had rebuilt the whole stack of dependencies from sources. 
This was quite a pain for a few of them (one of the QT based lib. can't 
remember which one), especially to convince them to install to a custom prefix.

You could take inspiration from Matthias' build recipees at 
https://github.com/opengisch/osgeo4travis/tree/master/docker/qt5 that are used 
to generate the 
https://github.com/opengisch/osgeo4travis/archive/qt5bin.tar.gz archive used 
on Travis-CI (but you can't probably directly use those binaries for 14.04 as 
they are targetted for 12.04).

I finally have 2.14.6 LTR and 2.16.2 packaged for OS X.

It's not code signed with the new developer certificate yet, so you'll still have to use the right-click trick mentioned on my download page to install it for the first time if you have the from "identified developers" option on in your security prefs.  I need to work on bundling GDAL in the app package to make that work.

But it should be OK with SIP in El Capitan and Sierra.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q670+SR8roxKm110P0JKvm9LgOK6PPi1YhrbEPXyXP_sxOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm glad that Matthias's semi-serious threats to remove the server from
source tree and Nyall's complaints have shaken the souls of the server
people!

I insist that the server remains a first class citizen and a full featured
tool within the QGIS project, but I understand that it should not be a
brake for the core refactoring ,slowing down the amazing development that
QGIS dev team is doing on the core and gui libraries.

 I've just started a small WIP contribution aimed to solve a first issue (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3528).

I wonder what would be the better way to coordinate the efforts, gain in
efficience and avoid duplication.

This is a possible roadmap (suggestions welcome!):

- start a QEP for the new server architecture (C++ plugins for the core
services etc.) (@rldhont, can you take care of this?)
- a list of prioritized issues (on the qgis hub?, on github? no idea here)
( @nyall, @mkuhn: you know the new and old API very well,  if you could
start creating a list of must-have, should-have, nice-to-have issues it
would be very helpful)
- create a formal (but completely open) dedicated team of developers and
assign issues
- possibly, meet periodically to coordinate the development

Am I dreaming?

Hi,

I'm trying to compile QGIS for the first time on Ubuntu Xenial, I've
followed the instructions to compile the Qt4 version:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL
I did apt-get update+upgrade and got the latest sources following this
guide.

I'm getting the attached CMake error message while trying to configure.
pressing 'c' and 'e' a few times as suggested doesn't seem to help as I
don't get the 'g' option.

I would like to try to debug QGIS and set breakpoints in cpp files in order
to understand pieces of the code better. I'd be happy if you could give me
some pointers on how to do that.

Thanks.

I'm also trying to build on 14.04, I've installed QCA following this guide:
https://github.com/JPNaude/dev_notes/wiki/Using-the-Qt-Cryptographic-Architecture-with-Qt5#building-qca-on-linux

But this was not the last issue: GDAL is 1.10.1, Qt5 is 5.2.1 and the build
fails with:

/home/ale/dev/QGIS/src/core/qgsexpression.cpp: In member function ‘void
QgsExpression::detach()’:
/home/ale/dev/QGIS/src/core/qgsexpression.cpp:3835:15: error: no match for
‘operator>’ (operand types are ‘QAtomicInt’ and ‘int’)
   if ( d->ref > 1 )

I've another machine with xenial and it builds just fine but it would nice
to be able to build on trusty too.

Thanks Tom,

any help would be highly appreciated, if you think that your code would be
useful for others and you wish to contribute, the best way to do it is
through a pull request.

If the changes are deep and touch the API, then a QEP (QGIS Enhancement
Proposal) would be also a good starting point for a public discussion about
your proposed changes.

If your company can contribute some money, you can probably contact the
QGIS Project Steering Comitee (psc)  and donate some money for the Server
project. A dedicated grant program could be a viable option to spin up the
server refactoring and help devs to allocate some paid time to this
activity.

Cheers

I don't understand why people want to stick to the outdated trusty, but
since they do, perhaps they're should contribute to backporting Qt5
dependencies for QGIS to UbuntuGIS. UbuntuGIS doesn't have the manpower
to do this, so new contributors are required.

Bas

some time ago, when I approached QGIS, I had your same impression,
thought that his editing capabilities were insufficient; luckily
something is improved and I realized that not all users need of
advanced editing capabilities; But I remain convinced that others,
such as those that arrive by the Urban Design, might like a more
advanced editing;

I wish you good work, hello,
giuliano

PS: I allow me to alert a few plugins that I have sketched out long
ago (points4qgis, plines4qgis & polyg4qgis); probably the code has to
be rewritten, however, you might find some ideas about querying,
diagnostics, building (orthogonal, parallel, trilaterations,
rectangular and radial series, symmetry, etc.) and editing (shifts,
rotations, collimation, etc.) useful for your goal;

Another option would be to put the deps into an existing ppa like

I had quick contact with the maintainer and he seemed to be positive
about collaboration.

Gis3W is also highly interested in partecipating, since we employ QGIS
Server in critical components of our business .
It's ok for us to keep QGIS Server out of the main repo. This would give
also the opportunity to manage a different release cycle.

The QGIS 3 refactoring is a great opportunity to review and improve QGIS
Server.
I think there will be a (long) list of wished features and improvements to
discuss, lnot only tiling support (which is a missing feature indeed!).

Message-ID: <CABgOYCdJ80C_6Scdi_SZQrMjtOF3eMMk+=oCASZzKS2F6ZpwPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
I'm trying to set up multiple docker images to test different environments
in ubuntu xenial.
I just gave a try to excellent Tim's repository with  docker images for all
QGIS versions.

My question : Is it possible to launch a docker image with --configpath
option as an argument so that I can use differents qgis profiles with one
image?  If yes, how can I achieve that?

Thanks for your lights.

BTW, I could run QGIS master but 2.14.6 returns that error:

docker: Error response from daemon: oci runtime error: exec:
"/start.sh": stat /start.sh: no such file or directory.

Shall I create an issue in kartoza repo?

Hi all, 

So I assume the discussion is not about kicking QGIS server out of the
project, but about finding a way to improve the situation and make QGIS
server more reliable and renovate the code base - right? 

I have to say it comes a bit as a surprise to me that suddenly QGIS
server is not regarded as a core component of QGIS anymore. 

I just returned from the German QGIS user meeting where I found out that
a) there are a lot more QGIS server users out there that we are aware of
and b) that interest in QGIS server is growing a lot. Also, there are
several gov. organizations and private companies out there that rely an
QGIS server as core part of their Web-GIS or who are just about to roll
out QGIS server as part of their GDI infrastructures. This includes
several provinces and larger cities. 

So, regardless on how the QGIS server code base will be organized in the
future - please make sure that the core values of QGIS server are kept: 

a) configuration from QGIS desktop, using the .qgs project files 

b) Symbology/labeling is IDENTICAL to rendering in Desktop 

c) the extensions, such as GetProjectSettings, GetPrint, enhanced
GetFeatureInfo, etc. remain in place 

d) it continues to also support WMS/WFS/WCS all from the same project 

----------------------- 

I understand that there are several deficiencies in the QGIS server
source code. But rather than kicking out QGIS server, they should be
addressed. If there is enough advance time, we could probably also
organize funding. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

I agree totally with Andreas. I understand that QGIS server needs a deep refactoring and that we need to keep all that makes
it the winning solution other servers can't bring being separate from the desktop application, without breaking webclients
one hand, or without blocking QGIS desktop API refactoring on the other hand. 

Count on me for participating in helping testing, discuss specification and coordinate work if needed.

then set env that will be used in the start.sh

I did the base of 2.14 dockerfile... but I didn't follow it's

better than a issue, would be fine a PR :) edit Dockerfile is a really

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Integrate isselected() expression in core?
Message-ID: <f84c42bdc4591731c6dea0976f2efdb2@carto.net>

Hi, 

I recently had the need to filter a layer based on a selection, e.g. for
QGIS atlas. The expressions plus plugin provides the
"isselected(layername)" function which returns true|false for each
feature - based on the selection state. 

Could we make this a core expression in QGIS without the need to install
a plugin? I guess this expression is of quite common use for many. 

Any thoughts? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Thanks Luigi, 
I'm quite new to docker, if I get it right, I should:

1 - Add a new environment variable to docker file. something like  "ENV QGIS_PROFILE /project/.qgis2"
2 - Change startup.sh from su $USER_NAME -c "/usr/bin/qgis" to "su $USER_NAME -c "/usr/bin/qgis --confipath QGIS_PROFILE"
3 - Build my own docker image
4 - if that works, submit a PR :)

I had the hope of not having to build my own images (too much to learn at once).  I guess I should startup .sh should test if
QGIS_PROFILE exists or not and add --confipath argument only if true.

Do I miss something?

Me too.  To me it's also not so clear why it should be separated more from
core.  I guess it would be better to make core more suitable for use with the
server.  So all the special things it now does to manage multiple projects and
caching of layers across projects should be already covered there and don't
have to be reinvented in the server in a different way.

I also don't clearly see how moving it to a separate repository with a separate
release schedule will make things easier.   My expectation would be that it
then would need to support multiple versions of core.  And keeping it in sync
with the cores would need extra effort by the server team, that is now covered
with the rest of the following changes to gui, app etc. by whoever does change
core.

Hi

Are you telling that the server codebase could rely on these features (multiproject management and layer cache) with
the actual refactoring ?  This would be really a good thing - (and also a better handling of the layer registry that introduces weird
things with the ownership of layers).  

Afaik, trying to genuinely load a project in a headless qgis leads to a crash, and this why the server had to
manage things on its own.

Regards
David

Hi Nathan,

I'd like to escape _ or %.
I'd like to do it because I've been requested to fix the OGC Element 
PropertyIsLike.
This element can specify it's own escape char, single char and wild char

For exemple the * can be defined as the wild char so the % has to be 
escaped to be used as an expression.

I'm preparing a PR with updated help.

I would prefer mantaining it in QGIS core too, but we need to find the
resources to keep it up to date with QGIS 3 refactoring. I thought this was
the problem...

It sounds great. I agree that QGIS Server needs a dedicated effort and
coordination.
We (gis3w) will try to contribute. We are not C++ devs but we have summed a
significative experience with QGIS Servers's strengths and weeknesses. We
will partecipate to the discussions on the "high level" roadmap ;)

Wow, I am impressed by the amount of feedback and active interest in the
QGIS server.

With this motivation behind it I am confident this part of the project
can be continued in a solid and sustainable way.

From a technical perspective I also fully agree with Jürgen that keeping
the source code in the same repository than the core functionality.

If I understand correctly, the grant proposal by Martin should already
cover part of the required refactoring (fingers crossed it gets
accepted) and with the resources available which offered support in
various ways in this thread I don't think it is out of scope to fix the
remaining issues.

Best regards,
Matthias

Great news, thanks. I also agree. I think that, while open tech
discussion is always good, we should be careful not to spread FUD around
the project: it is far easier to scare people than to reassure them, and
scared people might run to help, as we have seen in this thread, or slip
away, maybe silently.
So, long life to QGIS server. It is quite clear we all want it in good
shape for QGIS 3.
All the best.

At the time I implemented this there were no expression variables
available and an "expression context" barely existed and therefore a
proper solution was out of scope, so it was more suitable to ship it
with a plugin than in core.

With the current state of expressions it should not be hard to implement
it in a clean way.

Proposal:
isselected(feature, layer_id) <-- explicitly check for a certain feature
on a certain layer
isselected(feature_id, layer_id) <-- explicitly check for a certain
feature on a certain layer
isselected() <-- shorthand for the current feature / layer from the
expression context.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Testing plugins against QGIS3 with Travis
Message-ID: <1474918921192-5287867.post@n6.nabble.com>

I hope the subject is clear. Is it feasible yet to set up Travis to test
plugins against QGIS3 master? My .travis.yml currently has:

dist: trusty

env:
  - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian-ltr
  - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian
  - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian-nightly

install:
  - sudo add-apt-repository ${QGIS_REPO}

I've just tried adding the experimental repo to the env section:

  - QGIS_REPO=http://qgis.org/debian-nightly-experimental

However, Travis throws an error on apt-get update:

Err http://qgis.org trusty/main amd64 Packages
  404  Not Found [IP: 104.27.139.220 80]
Ign http://qgis.org trusty/main Translation-en_US

404  Not Found [IP: 104.27.139.220 80]
E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones
used instead.

Can I get further with this, or do I need to wait?

Thanks

Tom

Sounds good to me. As much as I hate the idea of styling based on
something as transient as a selection there's obviously demand for
this, so as long as it's done in the right way (using contexts) I'm
not against it. The is_selected() method could even use a scoped
expression function provided by the layer scope to avoid the need to
retrieve layers by id.

Just a note that it would need to be "is_selected(...)" to keep the
standard naming of other expression functions.

Maybe this could even be integrated with Nathan's experiments with
selection presets...

Hi René-Luc,

Very well said, likewise here in the Pacific Island QGIS Server and
Lizmap are major parts of our GIS projects, especially for Utilities.

On the same note we would love to see QGIS Server maintained, count me
IN participating and maintaining QGIS.

cheers,

Edwin

Hi Matthias, 

Your proposal sounds good - but besides Nyall hints to name it
"is_selected()" I would also want to make sure that a layer can be
selected by layer name next to be able to select by layer id. The
layer_id is not so useful if I don't want to loop over all layers and
find out what id the layer with my envisaged name has. So it would make
my life much easier, if I could just specify my layer name. My projects
always have unique layer names. If not, it should just pick the first
hit. We already have the same mechanism in place for get_feature(). 

In addition, I would have an additional need to have an expression
function or or a variable that shows the total number of selected
features for a given layer. If we use it in layer scope, I think it
could be a variable, something like @num_selected - could something be a
variable and at the same time also be a function with the same name? So
we could have it as a variable name @num_selected in layer scope and
still provide a function to get the num_selected() features of another
layer? 

Thanks for your replies, 

Andreas

Apologies if I've caused any offence here - I was trying to give
constructive feedback and share some explanation as to the frustration
against maintaining server. I want to stress that i am VERY
appreciative of everyone who has put in effort into server & who has
funded time for devs to work on it.

I also applaud how well everyone has reacted to this, and all the
offers of time/development to improve server for 3.0!

Based on this reaction I think I'll go file a QEP to "rm -rf src/core"
and see if we can shake up some more developers ;)

I agree with this - I don't really want to see server pulled out of
core either.

As I mentioned over on the 3.0 api tracker, the biggest issue I see is
the way server loads projects and messes with the layer registry. I
understand this was probably a design decision made due to api
constraints, but now we've got the opportunity to fix the underlying
issues in core and avoid the messy workarounds in server.

I'd really appreciate it if someone more familiar with the server
architecture could summarise what's missing in core's project/layer
handling. I may be missing something, but would a something like this
help?:

- add a QgsProjectRegistry, with an instance attached to
QgsApplication. Change all the use of QgsProject::instance to
QgsProjectRegistry::currentProject().
- move QgsMapLayerRegistry from an instance to a member within
QgsProject. Core code would then use
currentProject()->mapLayerRegistry() instead of
QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()
- server could directly pull projects from the registry (via some form
of generated project id) as required and access their map layer
registries directly

Not only this; but the way in which qgis server does the same PostGis
query (for extent or bounding box?) all times for each layer. It woud
be useful to store these informations on the project file, to optimize
times, with a configuration option in the Server tab?

Hi, on this part, improvements have been made recently since this was a blocker in my previous employer's architecture and we
funded 3Liz to improve things.
René Luc, can you summarize what is the current status on postgis extent and unique id's queries? 

Cheers

This has been already fixed:
* firstly layer has been cached to avoid reloading it
* the layer description stored Extent and used it

The problem you point is the way Layer is build by QGIS. In the Desktop, 
QGIS can build it at each project loading, but server side is could be a 
mess. If the cache is not conserved by the system QGIS Server is used, 
the layers are reloaded at each request.

How can QGIS Server conserve the cache?

Hi Régis and Luca,

The other point, unique's id, is due to the fact that QGIS and QGIS 
Server does not truth the QGIS Layer Description and verifying the 
unicity of ids. So to avoid id, the layer has to be added with 
'estimated metadata'.
If a PostGIS layer has not been opened with this option, the user has to 
update the datasource to add it.

Regards,

We use NGINX and Supervisor to conserve QGIS Server instances.
Apache with FCGI is failed to conserve instances. It regularly reload 
instances and clear the cache.

correct... but IMHO would be better more flexible in the sense of
check the existence of the env var in startup.sh and set the value of
trhe env var just as -e parameter in the docker run => in this way you
can have different container (desktop) on different configurations.

You have to build your image if you want the container container your
modifications (well there could be other dynamic solutions... but more
complex for who starts with docker)

but you just have to follow the build guide by tim  that is very
simple https://github.com/kartoza/docker-qgis-desktop/tree/develop/2.14.

Hi Tom,

may I suggest you to have a look to this project
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment-docker ?

I've started to adapt the Docker recipe for Qt5 and Py3 but I'm not done
yet and any help would be highly welcome!

We also have nigthly automated builds ready for use:
https://hub.docker.com/r/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment/tags/

This system is currently used CI on all Boundless plugins, see a simple
example here:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-lessons-plugin/blob/master/.travis.yml
and a more complex one here:
https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-geoserver-plugin/blob/master/.travis.yml

@Juergen Ah, so this is not possible? Thank you for clarifying - though I
don't think the error I pasted above indicates that problem. Never mind.

That means that the bet way to achieve this is probably...:

@Ale I can see that that would achieve what I need. I only have two issues
with this approach:

1. At the moment, my tests don't have to build QGIS, so they complete in
less than three minutes

2. I'd have to learn docker...

But I'll look into it. Thanks, both.

Tom

QGIS is already built into the docker images and you don't need to buld it
in a travis job (it would take too long) but yes, the docker pull operation
could take a while.

The advantage is that you can design and develop your tests inside QGIS,
because they are actually run inside a real QGIS instance, no need for
mocking.

To use the available images you don't need to learn docker, but if you plan
to contribute yes.

OK, thanks again for correcting my misunderstandings. I'll see if I can get

Do Travis agent not cache downloaded docker images ?
Drone [1] agents (can) do.

[1] https://github.com/drone/drone

I'm experimenting a drone instance associated with the OSGeo Gogs
instance, and currently using it to build-test postgis/geos,
see for example:
https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/postgis/postgis/src/svn-trunk/.drone.yml

The longest step there for agents is (apart from the very first build)
fetching the sources being tested.

It does.  You try to install trusty packages - but there are none - as there is
no qca for qt5 in trusty.  xenial has them.

The strategy which we use for QGIS tests (and plugin tests) and some
other plugins which I've been involved with do not depend on Docker but
instead on a precise or trusty system where additional dependencies can
be installed from repositories (which are currently missing for almost?
all distributions).

Yes, but Alessandro was suggesting a user to use a docker-based travis
to test plugins, if I'm not mistaken.

It could actually also be a good idea to use docker for QGIS, as it
would possibly reduce testing time (a qgis-build-test docker could be
provided with all pre-built dependencies).

We're doing this on Drone for postgis, using ad-hoc docker images, see
https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/postgis/postgis-docker/src/master/build-test

Drone agents cache the image, so all they have to do is fetching the
PostGIS code and build/check that.

Yes, exactly, the Docker image contains QGIS nightlies from different
branches and a few small scripts that make easier to run fully automated CI
tests (unittest python classes)  inside a real QGIS instance.

We are using this system to test plugins and to run integration tests with
GeoServer or other endpoints (they are also in docker containers,
orchestrated with docker compose.

It shouldn't make a big difference. Installing deps from a (cached) apt
repository or setting up a (cached) docker instance should be comparable
from what I can see?

Most of the time is spent on building QGIS where a major improvement
could be achieved by having a persistent ccache directory. This has cut
down build time from ~50 minutes to 10-20 minutes (unless some very low
level files change).

I am unable to reproduce.  Thanks for filing a ticket.  Can you provide further
details in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15592

MetaSearch's Settings tab allows for different options for connection
naming.  Perhaps we can add other options?

Let's discuss further ideas in http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15593

Thanks

Message-ID: <6A027E47-48BC-4538-8DAE-81E390CDA147@3liz.com>

Hi,


I'm trying to run tests on OSX 10.9.5 (Maverick), by running the following

> sudo make install
> make test

I have the following warning "!!! prefix path was requested, but it is not valid - we do not run from installed path !!!" then all tests
involving loading a provider are crashing.

I figured out that provider was not found  and In those tests will crash with a segfault because they are trying to dereference a null pointer on provider before testing if the returned objects are valid or not.

Is there something missing for setting the correct prefix in tests ?

Thx
David

I'm not sure if "make test" works with QGIS. The usual approach is to
switch to your build folder and then run "ctest".

Hi,

I’m working on a plugin for Qgis, that consists in displaying my spheric
images, something similar to this:

http://threejs.org/examples/css3d_panorama.html

I’ve tried to implement it in html and js and embed it in a qwebview, but
it doesn't render correctly.

Another option is to implement it from scratch in a qgraphicsscene, similar
to this code:


https://forum.qt.io/topic/66310/panoramic-view-in-qgraphicsview/4

Does anybody have any suggestion about how implement it? Or can you tell me
which the best starting point would be?

I'm develep a plugin like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIkcOHmJJhI
 but your code have more issues and is not full.

Thanks in advance

Count on me for testing, documentation and suggestions.

I'd prefer to have QGIS Server in core but if it has to become a third 
party software would it be a good idea to develop it in Python or any 
other developper-friendly language rather than Qt/C++. This might not 
possible due to performance issues but I think maybe more developpers 
would join development. I'm not an expert so it is just a suggestion.

I have found that runtime path was not set correctly  on one dependency (libqscintilla) and thus the library was not loaded (image not found), not easy to guess because the tests were just crashing without hints,  maybe some more validity tests should be done to prevent dereferencing null pointers.

Hi Francisco

One reason this might not immediately work with a QWebView is that Qt Webkit
is an older version of WebKit. If you implement debug tools in it, you can
see what console errors you get. They might point you towards using some
polyfills, which could get things working, but I don't know, for something
as advances as three.js.

The other thing to bear in mind (correct me, devs, if I get this vague
assertion wrong) is that QWebView is deprecated, and might well not be
present in QGIS3. I leave it o others to describe the situation precisely,
since it has me very confused.

open the color dialogue, close it with "ok" and crash. It is quite
reproducable - happens almost always. I doesn't seem to happen when I
use the same color dialogue from the styling dock. 

Can others confirm this issue? If yes, I will open an issue (severe,
because of the crash). 

I don't know what other information I can provide? 

Here is an animated gif showing what I do to get the crash:

Thanks, 

Andreas

Hi


loadPythonSupport() load utils.py which in turn try to load the 'future' package: this package is not in the build nor the install path and so loadPythonSupport 
fail  and python support  is deactivated.
 
Any idea ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help with a new processing plugin
Message-ID: <CAKvFTW1Urc9AfdeHS8745QKUq7Qp9syTCTf-6RqM1Q1GaUrpDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'd like to release a script I wrote as a subplugin of processing.

The code can be found here: https://github.com/eborke/QGISGraphPlugin

My script builds a graph from a vector layer of polygons in the following
way:
The vertices (or nodes) of the graph are the values taken on by an
attribute field of the vector layer. There is an edge between two vertices
if any of their associated polygons intersect. It also appends a dictionary
of attributes to each vertex which were castable to either a string or a
float.

It isn't hard to write a short very simple script to do this, which will
run fine for a small data set. The value in my script is that it is
optimized for large data sets (any further optimization ideas are certainly
welcome). For example, a simple initial script took approximately 87
minutes to run over a test data set consisting of nearly 8000 polygons on a
global scale. The current version runs the same test data in approximately
12 minutes.

The output of my script is a pickled Network X graph. The user can then
write their own scripts to analyze the graph in the context of their
problem using the Network X library. Should they prefer not to use the
Network X library, they can simply comment out lines 3 and 367 and my
script will output the graph as a pickled dictionary based data structure
for which they can write their own analysis algorithms.

I've been told my script is not yet up to the standards for release. Any
direction you can give me for getting it there would be appreciated.

Several individuals have mentioned the problem with the Invert not working
in 2.16.2 when styling a gray scale image with Singleband pseudocolor as
the render type. I thought it would be fixed in this release, but it wasn't
so I want to bring it up again as this is a problem for me.

It works if the Mode is set to "Equal interval" or "Quantile" but it does
not work with "Continuous." It works properly in QGIS 2.14.

Thanks!!!

Hi Chris,

sorry cannot help you, but it helps if you point to a relevant issue, or
in case there is not one, create a good issue: that is: provide a small
dataset, and maybe a picture with a desired img and one which is NOT
good. That gives devs a good starting point, AND shows that somebody is
at least interested enough to create a good issue report :-)

Regards,

Richard

That's good advice in general! FYI this is a known issue and there's a PR
with a fix waiting review. I'll do that during freeze.

Confirmed with 0497e4a. Could it be limited to categorized renderers?
Specifically, in my tests:

1. does *not* occur with single symbol or graduated renderer
2. in categorized renderer, does *not* occur if double click category icon
in ToC
3. in categorized renderer *does* occur if click layer (not category) in ToC

Is that what others experience?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future of the Globe plugin in QGIS 3 with Qt5
Message-ID: <561497c6-dafc-b68f-fe0e-73f6607508d5@xs4all.nl>

As discussed in #15536 [0], osgEarth 2.8 has been released and requires
OpenSceneGraph 3.4. The Debian packages for OSG 3.4 have switched to Qt5
as has the Debian packaging for osgEarth 2.8.

Unfortunately the Globe plugin only supports osgEarth 2.7 in QGIS 2.16
(which both still use Qt4). And I've not been able to get an answer from
Pirmin about the plans for the Globe plugin in QGIS 3 which will use Qt5.

Currently most packages that depend on OpenSceneGraph in Debian use the
OpenSceneGraph 3.2 packages, and those will remain available in the next
Debian stable release (stretch). The OpenSceneGraph maintainers have now
also move the OpenSceneGraph 3.4 packages to unstable to have it
available alongside the 3.2 packages in stretch. [1]

Because the QGIS 2.14 LTR packages in Debian lack support for osgEarth
2.7 in the Globe plugin, there is no need to keep the osgEarth package
at version 2.7, it's only used by the upstream QGIS 2.16 packages.

I'm considering moving the osgEarth 2.8 packages from experimental to
unstable for inclusion in stretch, hoping that support for it will be
added as part of the move to Qt5 in QGIS 3. Although based on my
questions in the Redmine issue not being answered and prior experience
with time needed to get support for osgEarth 2.7 in QGIS, I'm not seeing
a bright future for the Globe plugin in QGIS 3 with Qt5 expecting it to
be disabled for a long time until support for osgEarth 2.8 or later is
added.

If there is sufficient demand to keep osgEarth 2.7 in stretch for the
sake of upstream users of the QGIS 2.x packages, I'm willing to keep the
osgEarth 2.8 packages in experimental until stretch is released.
Otherwise I'll move the osgEarth 2.8 packages to unstable for inclusion
in stretch, breaking the Globe plugin in the upstream QGIS 2.16 packages.

Please share your thoughts about the future of the Globe plugin in QGIS
3 with Qt5.

Hi

I've had a look recently at adding osgEarth 2.8 support (and produced a 
tentative patch [1]), however the rendering is completely broken. I've 
not had time to investigate yet, but it looks like osgEarth2.8 puts a 
hard minimum requirement on GLSL 3.30, i.e. debug log output:

FRAGMENT glCompileShader "main(fragment)" FAILED
FRAGMENT Shader "main(fragment)" infolog:
0:1(10): error: the compatibility profile is not supported
0:1(10): error: GLSL 3.30 is not supported. Supported versions are: 
1.10, 1.20, 1.30, 1.00 ES, and 3.00 ES

This makes me uncomfortable: I'm pretty sure many users running somewhat 
older distros or older hardware will hit this. So upgrading to osgEarth 
2.8 just for the sake of upgrading and braking the globe for many user 
is in my view not the best of plans.

Technically nothing speaks against building osgEarth2.7 against Qt5 (for 
clarity: osgEarth 2.7 supports Qt5 alread) and keeping that version 
packaged for the forseable future.

Alternatively, distros wanting to upgrade could keep osgEarth 2.7 
packaged as osgEarth27 and renaming library names (i.e. libosgEarthXXX 
-> libosgEarth27XXX) and the header dirs. Up to this point it would be 
fairly easy, the problem comes with osgPlugins - I'm not sure if it is 
possible to install multiple versions simultaneously in 
/usr/lib64/osgPlugins-3.4.0/ or similar.

Happy to hear other suggestions.

Best
Sandro

Hi Devs,

To enhance the discussion, David Marteau @dmarteau, has updated the QEP: 
QGIS Server Services as plugins like providers with Proposed solution.

Hi Nyall,

I like your proposition on QGIS Project and Layer Registry. Will you 
write a QEP about it ? Do you wait the grant vote ?

About the server part, we used QgsMapLayerRegistry because some widgets 
rely on map layer ids and not map layer pointers. We create our own 
Project parser because the QgsProject load segfault if the 
QgsApplication is instanciate without interface (GUIenabled to false). 
And QgsProject is too close to QGIS gui.

Hi Tom, 

Thank you for your tests. It is encouraging that others can reproduce.
This justifies that I'll do a bug report. 

Meanwhile I also tested on Linux and it behaves the same like the
Windows version. More comments below.

I can confirm that. It happens for categorized and for rule based
renderers, but not for single symbol or graduated renderers.

confirmed 

> 3. in categorized renderer *does* occur if click layer (not category) in ToC

confirmed

Here is my bug report: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/15634

I also noticed a crash, when using identify on certain categorized layers.
That's fixed - maybe your problem is/was related.

May I point (as part of 3.0 changes, second try ;-) ) to:

https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13494#note-19

Where Martin Dobias says:

"In general, the QgsApplication API is extremely confusing - and I hope
we can fix it for QGIS 3.0. It derives from QApplication (IMHO bad
idea), it also handles init/exit and paths. The init/exit handling
should be ideally completely automatic with PyQGIS, hopefully avoiding
different possible ways how people init PyQGIS in the future."

I hit this also, so it would be nice to get this fixed for 3.0, as both
pyqgis would benefit from it and apparently QGIS server :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis_ogcutilstest and qgis_ziplayertest disabled
	on Travis
Message-ID: <CAB28AsjGUj3B-mFn5kX8d1UDnEeHRWH4rXxn2O5n=zbPY=ZP-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Following the conversation from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89d4998 , this is an announcement
to notify that the qgis_ogcutilstest and qgis_ziplayertest have been
disabled on the Travis builds.

Work has been underway to remove "noisy" tests from Travis which cause
false alarms and these tests regularly fail for unrelated changes.
False alarms are bad as they undermine confidence in the CI results
and encourage contributors to ignore the test results.

If you're interested in seeing these tests continue as part of the CI
infrastructure here are some examples of typical random failures these
tests encounter:

qgis_ogcutilstest: https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/163456478
qgis_ziplayertest: https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds/163070753

Unless someone volunteers to maintain a separate source package for
osgEarth 2.7 in Debian, only a single version will be in Debian (the
latest). Unlike the OpenSceneGraph maintainers I'm not willing to
maintain two co-installable osgEarth versions in a stable release.

Since the Globe plugin is not very actively developed, and takes a lot
of time before it's adapted to new osgEarth versions, consider it not
appropriate to keep as a core plugin and move it out of the qgis tree.

Thanks a lot Luigi for helping; now unpublished, and asked the author to

This is not very fair. Whereas it had a period of being pretty much 
unmaintained, the plugin is now actively maintained. But keep in mind 
that osgEarth is a delicate upstream to deal with: they break things 
without warning and without replacement within "minor" releases (though 
they really should be bumping major digits of the version number...). So 
finding new workarounds etc takes time and effort. So if distros don't 
want to wait for it to be adapted, they are free to simply disable 
building the plugin.

For those who want to contribute to the documentation (QGIS server or other), 
there is a good news: you can already start to contribute :)

Sorry for the late reply

The value of the multiple flieds is a string with field names
separated by semicolons

so, to get a list of them:

fields = multiple_fields.split(";")

Not sure this is what you need...maybe I am not understanding the question....

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MongoDB plugins - merge
Message-ID: <00f101d21a8c$d95510a0$8bff31e0$@gmail.com>

Hi all,

 

My name is Vasilios Kalogirou and I have recently developed a plugin which
allows users to store vector data in MongoDB
(https://github.com/VasiliosKalogirou/Save-layer-in-MongoDB ).

 

After trying to publish my plugin in QGIS Python Plugins Repository I got a
response from Paolo Cavallini to consider merging my plugin with the other
two MongoDB plugins, MongoConnector and Load MongoDB Layers. 

 

Please let me know of any future steps with regard to this.

Also, please note that on my research I tried to evaluate the functionality
of the other two plugins so I would be happy to discuss with the other
authors about some key points of the plugins.

 

Kind regards,

 

Vasilios

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using Processing in standalone PYQGIS scripts
Message-ID: <CAMM2+Yr9fMkL=NbjXStSfcE1KYS9cwF6YtBPZDfpXaQe9n_YBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm using QGIS 2.16.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 (from the qgis.org/ubuntugis
repo with ubuntugis-unstable ppa). I have a geopackage layer (I
originally started out with a spatialitelayer, but I kept getting

ASSERT: "i.value() == handle" in file
/tmp/buildd/qgis-2.16.3+20trusty/src/providers/spatialite/qgsspatialiteconnection.cpp,
line 780
Aborted (core dumped)

when calling getFeatures() on the layer) with two columns that I want
to populate. One contains the month and year a photo was taken,
extracted from EXIF metadata. The other is for the name of the polygon
that contains the point feature. Extracting the date from the metadata
works fine, but I'm having some serious difficulties with running the
'qgis:selectbylocation' processing algorithm in a standalone script.
Stack Overflow has several posts on using Processing in standalone
scripts, the most recent of which [1] I tried. It crashes on line 15
in my script [2](Processing.initialize()) with the following error
message:

The current error message I'm getting is:
Error in sys.excepthook:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 196, in
qgis_excepthook

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 107, in
showException
    open_stack_dialog(type, value, tb, msg)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qgis/utils.py", line 142, in
open_stack_dialog
    iface.messageBar().popWidget()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'messageBar'

Original exception was:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "extract_image_dates.py", line 14, in <module>
    Processing.Initialize()
AttributeError: class Processing has no attribute 'Initialize'


Since I was unable to get it running in the standalone script, I
loaded the script I wrote in the QGIS Python console. It ran, but it
said that the number of arguments to 'qgis:selectbylocation' was
wrong, but my call to the algorithim on line 55 matches the docs [3].

Any pointers on how to get this working would be greatly appreciated,
and I'd be happy to make a PR on the QGIS Documentation to add a
section about it once it works.


Thanks!
Eric

looks like the docs are outdated and the way to call the algorithm is
now different

ALGORITHM: Select by location
    INPUT <ParameterVector>
    INTERSECT <ParameterVector>
    PREDICATE <ParameterGeometryPredicate>
    PRECISION <ParameterNumber>
    METHOD <ParameterSelection>
    OUTPUT <OutputVector>

The PRECISION parameter is not documented in the help file.

Hope this helps

Just wanted to raise this discussion again now that we've dropped qt4
compatibility.

Should we remove all references to qwt polar from the source and
remove the associated cmake flag? AFAIK it can't be used with qt5 and
the flag causes a lot of issues for new builders who don't know that
they need to disable it.

Hi, 

I vaguely remember that it is used to display the satellite
constellation of GPS receivers. Potentially also used by some Python
plugins. 

qwt and qwt-polars did cause quite a few troubles for me during
compiling in the past. 

Given that qt5 has a charting component that also includes polar charts
(http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtcharts-index.html), I would appreciate to get
rid of the qwtpolar dependency.

Yeah - that's the only place it's used in QGIS itself.

Only problem is that QtCharts are Qt >= 5.7 only.

Last time we discussed this the conclusion was that it'd be moderately
straightforward to reimplement the satellite widget as a custom widget
ourselves. But no-one's done this and I think we can remove it until
someone steps up to port it/fund a port.

If we expect 5.7 to be widespread by the release of Q3, maybe we can
make it conditional?

IMHO we should start a crowdfunding at the same time we remove it:

All the best.

Thanks Vasilios,
I think many would welcome the landing of a good and robust support of
MongoDB in QGIS; on the other hand, we're trying hard to reduce the
duplication of efforts and the confusion for the plugins end users,
hence my suggestion.
Moreover, the upcoming QGIS 3 will require some effort in porting the
plugins, so a smaller number of plugins with stronger dev teams will
have better chances.
Vasilios, could you please quickly recall here the strengths of each
plugin? And, to help us understanding, could you also point to a sample
DB so we can do some tests?
BTW, there is also http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mongo_memorizer/
Are the other plugins authors listening here? If not, better to also
contact them directly.
All the best, and thanks again.

Hi,

it shouldn't be very hard to implement a custom QML component to display
this information even without QtCharts to get rid of qwtpolar.

Getting rid of qwt (which is present as package on more systems) can
then be postponed a bit.

actually not :)


a small example is.. I have a vector layer with some fields and I want
to perform normality test on some of the fields..

so I have 2 options:

1. create many ##field1 = Field Layer and give to some of them the label
optional because the user doesn't know how many fields would be in input..

2. use ##fields = multiple Field Layer that, as you said, throws out a
list with all the field names separated by ";" and loop on that columns

now the problem with my R script is that I cannot get the variable with
the selected fields, for example:

##Vector processing=group
##Layer=vector
##fields = multiple Field Layer

aa = fields

>aa

even to do in this way (so just printing the entire string of all the
field names) throws the error:

Error: unexpected symbol in " multiple Field"


I try your suggestion (f = fields.split(";")) but I get the same error
of above again.

For sure I'm missing something, but I really don't understand what..

Thanks again Victor!

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qbrowser or qgis trying to open files/connections?
Message-ID: <f3fdbbf7-a1cd-4ef7-43bb-7269034615bf@duif.net>

Hi devs,

running master_2 here. Did the logging change recently? Because I see a
lot of debug messages from qgsbrowsermodel which looks like that it
tries to open files or connections.

I also had a configuration where I see that after starting QGIS it is
trying to retrieve one of the WMS-layers I recently opened. Even when
I'm still in the 'opening screen' with my recent opened projects.

I tried to reproduce it by creating a fresh config with a fresh WMS in
it, but was not able to do a clear reproduction there.

It looks like QGIS is 'remembering' the opening of layers?
Anybody observed this also?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Close the browser panel.

And there's also the OGR MongoDB driver since GDAL 2.1: 
http://gdal.org/drv_mongodb.html . Although I suspect it is rarely compiled by 
default due to the dependency to the MongoDB C++ driver client library

So this is 'normal' behaviour of that panel? Because I 'dock' my panel
to the left, next to the layer panel. In that way I had an alternative
open browser...

Happy to NOT do that anymore, OR close it before I close QGIS, but I
thought the browser panel was even promoted to be a general layer opener
nowadays?

Richard

Looks like https://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS is broken

Anyone know who looks after this?

Argh, the logs from the debian nightlies were not uploaded for the different
reason - I thought I found the cause, but they would still not show...

Hm, IIRC that was introduced at the hackfest in Lisbon by Julien Malik.

I think so. It'll expand all branches that were open before - and revisit what
is necessary to populated them.   So you should be careful about what you leave
expanded, if it's expensive to reload - unavailable resources might sometimes a
problem too.

Thanks Victor, I had tried that within the QGIS Python console and got
the same error about the number of arguments. When I drop the OUTPUT
parameter it runs, so now my call looks like this:

processing.runalg('qgis:selectbylocation', "photos", "boundaries",
u'intersect', 0.0, 0)

If I run just this line in the interpreter, it outputs:  {'OUTPUT':
u'/home/eric/Development/csi_data_collection/scripts/photos.gpkg'}

However, it doesn't select any of the points within the selected
polygon boundary. If I run the tool from the Processing Toolbox, it
does select the points within the boundary. When running that tool
from python should it use selected features in the intersection layer?
I tried it with no boundaries selected and it still didn't select
anything.

Thanks again for the response. Making progress, but it would still be
good to get clarification on how/if Processing can be used from
standalone scripts. in the call to to runalg I did have to change the
layer inputs from the variables containing references to the
QgsVectorLayer objects to the layer name that I passed to those vector
layers on creation. Processing also couldn't find the layers until I
added them to the QgsMapLayerRegistry instance, which I think means
when I instantiate the QgsApplication in the standalone script I need
to pass True instead of False for it to use the GUI?

Did you try : 'initialize' ?

Not sure why it is not selecting your features. I will try to
reproduce it and will let you know

About the layers and how they are found, here is some info: Input
layers for Processing are data sources (if a layer is file based, that
means the filepath to it). If you enter something that is not that,
Processing tries to figure out what you mean, basically checking if
any of your layers has the name you entered, and then using it's
layer.source() value. But for that, the layer must be loaded. To avoid
that, you can directly enter the path to your layer, instead of a
layer name

I will let you know once i can reproduce your issue and find out what
is happening

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS master 3 compile problem

Hi,

I am trying to compile master3 with python 3 and qt5.

During compilation I get an error around gdal and python-future which 
may be corrupted:

-----------------------------------------

Anyone has an idea and what is wrong/missing here?

Note that I self-compiled gdal/geos/proj. Not sure if it properly builds 
python2 and python3 bindings simultaneously?

Thank you for any hints!

Thank you Victor and Etienne, the capital Initialize() got me :( It's
always the little things - sorry about that! Now the processing script
runs successfully as a standalone script but still has the issue of
not selecting anything in the input layer. I was able to use the
QgsVectorLayer variables as inputs to the tool, but it still didn't
select the features.

Thanks,
Eric

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS D3 DataVis Plugin Status Report
Message-ID: <CABPxTTozfS5z7FTXNyBd+QNUZf2oU1Zti=AiYHk1fb3Cyny4vA@mail.gmail.com>

I thought I would share my recent accomplishments and my planned
development activities on the d3datavis plugin. The overall goal is to
produce a number of different charts for QGIS data analysis that can be
displayed in a web page. So far I have one visualization and that is the D3
Circular Date/Time Heatmap. See:

https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/qgis-d3datavis-plugin

Scroll down to see an example of it in use.

*D3 Circular Date/Time Heatmap*
The purpose of this is to be able to display 2D circular heatmaps of
temporal date and time distributions in the data. It is somewhat similar to
the ArcGIS data clock.

*Recent Accomplishments*

   1. Updated to version 0.2
   2. Added support for NULL data with a NULL data color.
   3. Added a legend.
   4. Rewrote the original circular D3 heatmap code to support the above
   changes as well as to support graduated colormaps which will be added to
   the QGIS plugin in a future release.

*Planned Improvements*

   1. Rather than just support Date and Time for the axis also support
   other data type categories. This is currently under development.
   2. Add graduated colors with the colors selected from the QGIS color
   ramps.
   3. Allow for manual selection of the min & max values.
   4. Reorganize the code with all of the number crunching in a processing
   worker class.
   5. Any suggestions from the community?

*Next Possible Charts*
Here are some of the ideas of what I think should be done next, but I
welcome your input as to what you think would be the most important so
please let me know what you would like. If someone cares, I am more likely
to work on it.

   1. *Bar Chart*. This could be used for frequency distributions. Do you
   have any other use cases?
   2. *Scatter Plot*. This would be for showing the data in two variables.
   3. *Pie Chart*. For showing categorical distribution of data. I like the
   http://d3pie.org/ chart, but am concerned that it is not being actively
   developed.
   4. *Rectangular Heat Map*. This would be similar to my circular heatmap
   only in a rectangular form.
   5. *Bubble Chart*. I am not sure they really have a practical value, but
   I think they are cool. See http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269.

As much as possible I want to simplify my work. Rather then basing the code
just on D3js it would be nice to use some of the higher level components
such as:

   1. *d3pie* (http://d3pie.org/) - This is a very attractive pie chart and
   I like it, but it has only 7 contributors on GitHub and seems to be
   stagnant.
   2. *D3Plus* (http://d3plus.org/) - Has a number of reusable components -
   19 contributors on GitHub.
   3. *NVD3* (http://nvd3.org/) - Lots of reusable components - 200
   contributors on GitHub.
   4. *C3* (http://c3js.org/) - Also a number of components - 88
   contributors, but there haven't been any updates for over a year.

Is there anything I am missing and do you have any recommendations? I have
not done much D3 programming but can make use of the ideas of what others
have done. If you have any use cases, that helps me to see what needs to be
done.

Thanks,

C. Hamilton

Matteo,

I was able to sort of get it running. It does not appear to be able to
display in the QGIS window. I am not sure if it was suppose to or not, but
I saw where it was saving the temporary file and was able to view it in a
web browser. I had to make some small changes to the one .ui file to make
it come up and I see in some of the python modules (not sure they are
actually used) referencing some .ui files that are not there. Do you have a
functioning DataPlot that you could zip up and send to me?

My main concern is it is dependent upon a python library that is not a part
of the QGIS distribution. I can't have users install plotly in order to get
the plugin to work. I don't know plotly, but can it be in a folder within
the plugin directory and executed from there or does it have to be
installed into the python distribution.

Thanks!!!

I haven't worked with mongo_memorizer but I would definitely like to speak with the authors of all the plugins. 
Do we know if they are on the list? If not, how can I contact them directly?

Thanks Vasilios,
I think many would welcome the landing of a good and robust support of MongoDB in QGIS; on the other hand, we're trying hard to reduce the duplication of efforts and the confusion for the plugins end users, hence my suggestion.
Moreover, the upcoming QGIS 3 will require some effort in porting the plugins, so a smaller number of plugins with stronger dev teams will have better chances.
Vasilios, could you please quickly recall here the strengths of each plugin? And, to help us understanding, could you also point to a sample DB so we can do some tests?
BTW, there is also http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mongo_memorizer/
Are the other plugins authors listening here? If not, better to also contact them directly.
All the best, and thanks again.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DLL import/export defines quoting
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8Uf9-qX=NyNVBW--ExwH6JMM90Heq1qLkTcbjzLSr6kA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have some questions I found while trying to figure out why the C++ code
model for QGIS classes in Qt Creator were not being recognized (since a
recent Creator update, not sure when) [0].

I tracked it down to the following code (sample):

REMOVE_DEFINITIONS("-DGUI_EXPORT=${DLLIMPORT}")
ADD_DEFINITIONS("\"-DGUI_EXPORT=${DLLEXPORT}\"")

This extra quoting causes the definition (and any other *_EXPORT define) to
be parsed as undefined in Qt Creator when building the code model. Why is
the quoting like it is? i.e., why isn't it?:

ADD_DEFINITIONS("-DGUI_EXPORT=${DLLEXPORT}")

I could not find any CMake documentation on what the extra quoting
accomplishes. There are instances of this type of quoting in the GRASS
provider CMake setup as well.


Also, why are there spaces here in this string value? (in root
CMakeLists.txt):

SET(DLLEXPORT "__attribute__ ((visibility (\\\"default\\\")))")

Shouldn't that be?:

SET(DLLEXPORT "__attribute__((visibility(\\\"default\\\")))")

The latter seems to make a difference with Clang on OS X [1].

Hi Calvin,

well thanks to the complete refactoring code made by Micheal and Etienne
the ui is completely changed.

Just clone the last version of the repository and try it.

No more external tmp file. The plots are directly shown inside a webview.
Moreover the plot is interactive with the map cavas objects.

Give it a try! Adding other plot types is realy easy too.

If we can put the efforts togheter it will be awesome.

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,

Did you ever try Vega https://vega.github.io/vega/? As stated, "With Vega,
you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a
visualization in a JSON format, and generate views using HTML5 Canvas or
SVG."

You can see a sandbox to try it
http://vega.github.io/vega-editor/?mode=vega&spec=bar
It uses D3. With this approach, less need to code, more need to
configure/create a configuration.

FYI, ESRI company has a product based on it called Cedar
http://esri.github.io/cedar/ for creating online charts with their online
maps


Cheers

Thomas Gratier
