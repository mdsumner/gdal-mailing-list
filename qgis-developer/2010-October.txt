Be careful though: it does not handle reprojection. A bit annoying is the fact that
the button to load raster and vectors are switched (sooner or later one should really
improve this nice tool).
All the best.

There are several open source gps simulators available

yes, but this is through IP, and AFAICT the QGIS tool requires a serial connection.

gpsfeed+ can sends output to a serial port. I suppose you could use a
COM port redirector, like a null-modem emulator like [1], to pipe the
output port into an input one.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem - Projections
Message-ID: <000001cb6300$5f9ff760$1edfe620$@com>

Good day!

I have a GDALDataset that I create from an image.  I've used one of the
projection strings that the QGIS Projection Dialog returns, to set the
projection definition of this dataset.   I also used the
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem class to convert the string to Wkt format, in
order to assign the projection to the image.


Used: "+proj=aea +lat_1=-18 +lat_2=-36 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=132 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"

After this has been done successfully, I now want to create a
QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem object from the assigned projection definition
as follows:

                

GDALDataset *dataset = theDataset;

 QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem *crs = new QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem();

                QString projDefinition = dataset->GetProjectionRef();

                if(crs->createFromWkt(projDefinition))

                {

                                return crs->projectionAcronym();

                }else

                {

                                return "NOT FOUND";

                }

The projDefinition variable above receives the correct definition string:
PROJCS["unnamed",GEOGCS["Unknown datum based upon the GRS 1980
ellipsoid",DATUM["Not specified (based on GRS 1980 spheroid)",SPHEROID["GRS
1980",6378137,298.257222101,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0]
,UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Albers_Conic_Equal_Area"],PA
RAMETER["standard_parallel_1",-18],PARAMETER["standard_parallel_2",-36],PARA
METER["latitude_of_center",0],PARAMETER["longitude_of_center",132],PARAMETER
["false_easting",0],PARAMETER["false_northing",0]]

 

But for some reason, the crs->createFromWkt(projDefinition) returns false
every time.
Does anyone know what may be wrong?

Thank you!
Francois

Ok, found it sort of... using python you can resize the Qt-parent
component that QgsMapCanvas inherits from.

Now implemented in HtmlImageMap Plugin: ability to set mapcanvas size,
hence setting output size of image of the map.

This is not correct English as it should say "who is allowed".

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=om4tgJ1w5-_A1K_oAR=ZFbHiXL-Vg3+iRrkD6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

there is a way to load an editable layer without editing capabilities?
I searched for a setCapabilities() method, but nothing.
Reducing the layer capabilities would be useful, especially for plugins,
obviously
without adding new capabilities.

In a C++ plugin I can extend the concrete DataProvider class.
There is a way to do the same thing in a python plugin? Maybe creating a
wrapper
to the layer dataProvider?

Something like:

class ReadOnlyProvider:
    def __init__(self, dataProvider):
        self.dataProvider = dataProvider

    def select():
        return self.dataProvider.select()

    ...

    def capabilities():
        return newCapabilites

should work, but the QgsVectorLayer.setDataProvider method is private...

Do you know other ways? Help is appreciated.
Thanks.

Cheers.

Hi Pierre,

This is very good idea.

I myself don't deal with raster data at this moment, hence, all those
plugins dealing with raster is no use to me at this moment.

(Cross posted to Qgis developer)

Let see the developers feedbacks on your suggestions.

This has been discussed before.  The "official" builds are done with Visual
C++, which is what I use and which doesn't have this problem and it looks like
everyone else who faced this problem before has switched to Visual C++ to solve
it.

Does r14333 help? [1] suggests it might.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Windows refresh rates are slow
Message-ID: <508666.69958.qm@web33706.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I have used QGIS from an OSGEO build and I find the refresh rates for 
layers to be very slow. Is there anything that I can do to overcome this
 problem. I am willing to compile myself if there anything I can do to 
help it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug in PAL labelling over the dateline
Message-ID: <666FB8D75E95AE42965A0E76A5E5337E068819E4F1@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi All,

I've discovered a label rendering bug for geographic vectors layer when the mapcanvas bound spans the dateline. To replicate this do the following:

1) Add a vector layer with a geographic coordinate system, preferably one that already spans the dateline. I have attached a simple Shapefile.
2) Enable PAL labelling on this layer.
3) Turn on OTF projections. Make sure you use a coordinate system that will work for data over the dateline. I used EPSG:2193 for the attached Shapefile.
4) Zoom to a projected extent that will ensure that layer will span +/- 180 dateline.

This should raise a generic exception that is caught by QGIS, which leaves the application in state that is not usable. This exception is actually a re-throw of PalException::LayerExists.

At this stage I have debugged the application and determined this:

* When otf transformed are enabled, layer is has a geographic coordinate system and the canvas extents span the dateline two separate render operation will be initiated by QgsMapRenderer. See lines 475-419 in qgsmaprenderer.cpp

* Within the QgsMapRenderer::Render method the labelling engine is initialised, calls are made to the layer to draw the data, the labels are rendered and finally the labelling engine is cleaned up.

* Within the layer draw method the labelling engine prepares the layer for labelling i.e rendererContext.labelingEngine()->prepareLayer(...). In the context of the PAL label engine this sets the layer up for label rendering and adds metadata about the layer to the PAL object. i.e. Pal::addLayer(...)

* You can not add a duplicate layer to the PAL object otherwise it will throw a PalException::LayerExists exception. See line 186 of pal.cpp.

>From a simplistic point of view it seems to me that preparation of the label engine should occur within the QgsMapRenderer::Render method and not deeper down in the layer draw methods. I see that in the layer draw methods call the labelingEngine::prepareLayer() to determine if labelling is required and which fields are required for the data select. It seems that this information could be associated with the QgsRenderContext and set within QgsMapRenderer::Render() then and accessed within the layer draw.

Can someone please comment on this?

Thanks heaps,
Jeremy

rasters or vectors? size? added pyramids/overviews in rasters? did you
tested enabling the "use render caching where possible to speed up
redraws"?

Hi Jeremy

Wouldn't it be easiest to, in pal.cpp, just ignore layers that are already 
there instead of throwing an exception? And the same could be done for 
features crossing the dateline in pal/layer.cpp:239

If the label initialisation would be done in QgsMapRenderer, it would be 
necessary to change the layer interface to pass additional attribute indices 
to fetch (e.g. necessary in case of data defined label settings). 

Regards,
Marco

No such problem on Debian Lenny, 14244M. However it can be other case
on Squeeze.

Hi 

I'm having some problems with compiling r14344. Never compiled QGIS with QWT support but I guess it's not optional anymore. Compiling gives me the following errors:

Thanks Giovanni for the response. It is entirely vector and I find that the redraws to be very slow. 

I made the suggested changes on using render caching and I do not see that much performance gain.

Is there anything else to do to help the refresh speed?

Thank you for your help,

rasters or vectors? size? added pyramids/overviews in rasters? did you
tested enabling the "use render caching where possible to speed up
redraws"?

By my experience, slow rendering is case when Your layer is containing some
very big object (few hundred of vertexes each - for example long contour
lines generated by Grass).

Thanks Ivan. I do not have too many vectors with more points. Most of the polygons are parcel data. I find the QGIS renderer to be slower and was wondering if it is possible to tweak it.

Thank you,

Once you install them, cmake should pick them up.

Hi Marco,

Yes you are right, it's definitely easier and it doesn't mean changing the interfaces or too much code. So if you think this is the path of least resistant I'd be keen to fly with it.

Quick question: Is it ok to change the PAL library like this, or is it better to put an exception handler around the PAL calls. I'm just thinking about future merges of the PAL library into the QGIS source.

Cheers,
Jeremy

Hi Jeremy

Wouldn't it be easiest to, in pal.cpp, just ignore layers that are already 
there instead of throwing an exception? And the same could be done for 
features crossing the dateline in pal/layer.cpp:239

If the label initialisation would be done in QgsMapRenderer, it would be 
necessary to change the layer interface to pass additional attribute indices 
to fetch (e.g. necessary in case of data defined label settings). 

Regards,
Marco

Hi Jeremy

Applied in r14352, thank you for the good problem description and the 
testdata.

There are already other PAL changes in the QGIS source tree that need to be 
merged back into PAL, e.g. Martins curved labeling or the possibility to force 
certain label positions for data defined labeling. So agreed, we should do that 
soon to stay in sync with PAL.

Regards,
Marco

I don't understand one thing: is the PAL library integrated in QGIS main
trunk or on a specific branch?

AFAIK there has been no development within PAL for about two years
except for some small fixes - see [1]. So effectively development of
PAL happens only within the copy of PAL in QGIS repository. Therefore
it should be quite easy to merge all the changes back, the only
question is whether the original authors will be willing to merge all
our changes.

Yes, it's in trunk: src/core/pal directory

  I just want to say a big thank you to the developer(s) that have 
recently included gpsd support into qgis. Just in time for my field work 
trip! And it appears the only way to get my garmin gpsmap60csx connected 
to qgis (I was getting kind of desperate, till I did an svn update of my 
qgis sources...).

It's working flawlessly (as far as I've tried). Only the downloading of 
waypoints etc. does not work with gpsd, but that works OK with the 'old' 
/dev/ttyUSB0 connection.

thanks again,
Vincent Schut.

it seems that with the garmin_gps kernel module loaded the connection
via gpsbabel does not work anymore (at least on Ubuntu), but gps tools
work using /dev/ttyUSB0! this should be documented.

cheers!

Not really.  The gps tools uses gpsbabel.  gpsbabel can access the garmin
directly via usb w/o a special kernel driver.

The garmin_gps module provides a /dev/ttyUSBn device for the garmin.  At the
same time is blocks direct usb accesses to the GPS.  So when the module is
loaded, gpsbabel cannot be used with "-f usb:" anymore.

However gps tools/gpsbabel apparently can use the /dev/ttyUSBn device to access
the gps.  I just downloaded waypoints, routes and tracks from my hcx, which
garmin_gps (of kernel 2.6.34.1) was loaded.  Although [1] claims that this is
"depressingly uncommon".

Still that probably won't work while gpsd is running.

Hi Ameet

in the mail it seems that some parts your file have wrong indentation
- the main() method should be top-level, not a part of the MainWindow
class. Similarly the last two lines that trigger the main() method are
supposed to be at top-level - otherwise nothing will be run.

I am not aware of such functionality. But it would be possible to add
a pair of methods setReadOnly(bool) and isReadOnly() for the layers.
If set as read only, editing would be disabled.

There are already other PAL changes in the QGIS source tree that need to be 
merged back into PAL, e.g. Martins curved labeling or the possibility to force 
certain label positions for data defined labeling. So agreed, we should do that 
soon to stay in sync with PAL.

Marco

Message-ID: <20101008104350.185070@gmx.net>

Hello,
I have a Python 2.6.5. installation set-up independantly of OSGEO4W.

I use this tutorial:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qgis/html/intro.html#running-custom-applications

Although I added "c:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\bin" to PATH, I still receive the
following error:
"ImportError: DLL load failed: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden."

How can I avoid that?
I according to some threads, one should use the python version delivered with
OSGEO4W:
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/Use-qgis-libraries-in-python-scripts-td5273443.html

But my environment is now perfectly set up with the PythonXY (Python 2.6.5.)
installation.


I would appreciate any advice.

Thanks,
Timmie

Found the issue: one has to select a suitable area in latlong before starting.
The error should be handled more gracefully though, displaying an error.
We do miss a bugtracker for plugins.

Found it down again in the last days (up now).
Perhaps we could host it on QGIS web site? I find the plugin interesting, and the
site very useful and professional, it's a pity when it's not reachable, especially
during courses.
Stefan, would you mind moving it?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Offline editing: first tests
Message-ID: <4CB17530.9000403@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm testing the plugin and found some issues. While converting to offline, I get a
warning (from the shell) and an error (with a popup):

WARNING:  there is no transaction in progress
ERROR: 313 feature(s) not added
Could not commit changes to layer comuni (offline)

but the layer seems to be copied. So I edit it, and I get another error while
committing the changes to the SL db:

Errors: ERROR: 314 feature(s) not added.

I tested this with 2 different polygon layers, with the same problem. Points are
handled well.

Furthermore, views can be synced for offline use, but obviously the syncing back to
PostGIS fails: I think the user should be warned before copying for offline use.
All the best.

Is no easy to advice the user because is no easy to understand if it is
denied or not.

Infact a possibility situation is that the account don't have the write
right,
or it are connectiong to a  view, or again (more complex) the table can have
some constraints forward others tables.

The only method to understand if the layer is writeable.
Is to try to write.
The user must try and discovered if can do it or not.

yes, it works with linux, but the GUI would need to be optimized as there
are a few glitches. I also think that misses a button to delete the track at
wish.  For example clicking "new project" does not make the track disappear.
Thanks in advance!

Yes, it is. If you are uncertain, just tag the new version as Experimental, and keep
the old one.
All the best, and thanks.

Hello,

I wrote a small python plugin to paste and show WKT data. I've read on
google of a similar attempt but I couldn't find any code.

I'ts on the pyqgis repo, marked as experimental because I didn't test it
enough.

I still need a decent icon, the spyglass is a temporary solution ...

Feedback and patches are more than welcome!

Plugin name is QuickWKT

Normally when GRASS is run, it sets up an environment which includes a setting* to locate library binaries within the GRASS folder structure, just in case they are expected somewhere else, like NVIZ is looking for that ffmpeg library.  When I package GRASS, I try to fix these, though that setting will catch what I miss.

Qgis should take care of this as well, but maybe it isn't.  Or should I read that literally, and you are trying to run NVIZ directly from a terminal, without running GRASS first?

Looking at NVIZ, I see that it may also have problems with TclTk later - either not finding the bundled copy, or finding the system one, which is older and may cause trouble...

* On *nix systems it's LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but on OS X it's DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Message-ID: <8ebc144a0926c8a8ebc07f88a54de2e7@mail.gandi.net>

Hi,
Some QGis users recently pointed me out the fact that the icon set for
rendering in QGis was not that extensive nor consistent.
I've recently discovered the following dataset, which is aimed at covering
OpenStreetMap's needs with Mapnik, but would be great to have in QGIS as
well :

http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/introduction

On a more general viewpoint, what users stated was that it would be really
great to have some kind of a centralized icon and style repository, with
automatic search and retrieval from inside QGis, a bit like what KDE does
with KDE Hot New Stuff ( http://newstuff.kde.org/repos.php ). 
Are there any current plans on implementing this kind of feature ?

Vincent

There is a movement within the OSGeo community to centralize all the
freely available icons. It's been a little slow to get started but see
the Graphics mailing list http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/graphics

These things tend to not take a ton of space so it's fairly likely that
they would just be included in QGIS, no need to retrieve them from the
web. That said I agree that some way to catalog (keyword) and search for
icons could be quite useful, the big problem is where to stick that
metadata within the svg files.

Hi all.
I have a couple of annoying regressions in current trunk:
- deactivating a layer often does not result in the layer being switched off from the
canvas
- the colours of the layers do not show on the layers list.
Does anybody confirm? They shouldn't be difficult to fix.
All the best.

I'm confirming this one, it happens with the render cache on and off but 
I do not have a reproducible test case to provide as it is random.

Confirmed on Ubuntu 9.04 and QGis trunk (r14356).
AFAICS it happens with polygon layers only. Could anyone confirm this?

Cheers.

Hi Vincent and Alex,

You are absolutely right. It's already time to prepare map icons for 
QGIS and other applications.

Upcoming hackfest in Wroclaw will be god time to discuss (complete? ;)) 
this task.

Please send your proposals and ideas to this ML or OSGeo graphics ML. 
Just use word 'icon' in mail theme.
regards,
Robert

Hi Robert,

A few months ago, I started dispatching your icon set into individual 
svg files to get it like the default qgis set and to ease the work on it 
as separate packages means the possibility to follow the evolution of 
one icon in a svn repo.

Unfortunatly I've not been able to achieve this port due to lack of time 
and some difficulty to browse the source file. I can upload what I've 
done somewhere if interested.

I planned to do some work on your icon set to bring more contrast (it is 
difficult for some to distinguish between active and unactive).

About the map icon sets, having them is one thing but for now it would 
be too painful to browse in the composer item tab without a filtering 
tool (the folder search doesn't fill this gap).

Regards,
Jean Roc

Icons have many common elements. So having 'layer' sign in 20-30 icons, 
one have to change it 20-30 times. Now with one source file just once.
It can be done with 'stable' icon set, let say version 0.2 of GIS icons :)

Please point out which ones you mean.
Any other comments also are very welcome before QGIS hackfest in Wroclaw 
[1].
I will try to improve them during HF and then split into separate files.

Answering also Alex question.
We can use keywords from SVG file and implement search engine. To do ...

 Hi,

A) In release 14370 the histogram tab of the raster properties window
has a problem:
The histogram is not displayed the second time the 'histogram tab' is
clicked.
E.g.:
1 - open the raster properties window
2 - click on the histogram tab
3 - histogram is computed and displayed
4 - click on any other tab
5 - click on the histogram tab again
6 - blank screen!!

On WinXP - OSGeo4W dev installation
Can someone replicate the problem?



B) And keeping with the histogram, three comments/suggestions:
- Could the NaN be excluded from the histogram?
- Could the X-axis numbers reflect the actual colour values instead of a
fixed 0-300 range?
   Note that the X-axis of the histogram is spread on colours values,
thus the displayed X-axis numbers are meaningless
- Could it be possible to add a zoom function on the histogram?


Best regards,
Benoit

Hi all.
Anyone confirms this? If I have some hints, I can do further tests.

What source database are you using? Are there any special settings or missing 
primary keys in the polygon layers?

Nothing special, the table has a gid. I can send you a dump if you wish.

Hi devs,

A very cool and handy tool is Alexander Bruys raster algebra plugin. It's so 
usefull in environmental modelling that Tim and I thought it would be good to 
have it in our analysis library (where it can be used by 3rd party 
applications too and without the dependency of the numpy library).
So here is my initial patch that implements a calculator tool as part of the 
analysis library by extending the search string mechanism.


Compared to the python plugin, is has some missing features (but they could be 
added):
- no 'difference' and 'NDVI' buttons
- only outputs float32 rasters
- no possibility to load / save expressions

On the other side, it has some additional features:
- Possibility to insert output extent and resolution and do calculations with 
layers that have different resolutions / extent. If a layer resolution does not 
match, it is automatically resampled to the output resolution (of course with 
higher computation costs)
- Selection of output format


You can try the functionality by applying the following patch:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/101014_qgis_rastercalculator.diff
The menu to open the calculator is located under 'Layer->Raster calculator'.

I didn't apply it to trunk directly, as it needs more testing and there are 
still some issues:

- Flex detects a string as raster if it has '@' followed by a single number 
(the raster band number). Don't know if there are better solutions, especially 
to avoid conflicts with vector columns named that way.

- QgsSearchTreeValue is extended with a new type to represent a raster matrix 
and with new operators and methods doing matrix operations. This class needs 
some code cleaning before applying to trunk

- Handling of nodata values could be done in a more clever way: out of band 
values during resampling receive the nodata value of the input raster band. In 
case of error (e.g. division through zero), QgsSearchStingValue applies 
'-100000'.

- More testing is needed. Especially with the automatic resampling option, 
there is a high risk for rounding errors. Send me a mail if you found a bug 
(possibly with a sample dataset and easy instruction on how to reproduce).


Looking forward for your feedback,
Marco

Great, thanks Marco and Tim! This was much needed.

That is a big win: without this, the current plugin is of limited use. Without the
limitation, this can replace GRASS r.mapcalc, at least for simple tasks (i.e. no
neighbours analyses).
All the best.

Hi Marco,

seems that this is another great addition from your side.

I'll try to build QGIS trunk (r14380) with this patch under
Windows with MSVS Express 2008 and dependencies from OSGeo4W
and get next error:

qgssearchtreenode.cpp
d:\devel\cpp\qgis\trunk\src\core\qgssearchtreenode.cpp(1304) : error C2666: 'pow' : 6 overloads have similar conversions

   c:\program files\microsoft visual studio 9.0\vc\include\math.h(123): or 'double pow(double,double)'
   while trying to match the argument list '(double, float)'

I change line 1304 as
 res[i] = pow(double(value1), double(mat[i]));

and the I get another errors:

qgisapp.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall QgsRasterCalculator::~QgsRasterCalculator(void)" (??1QgsRasterCalculator@@QAE@XZ) referenced in function "private: void __thiscall QgisApp::showRasterCalculator(void)" (?showRasterCalculator@QgisApp@@AAEXXZ)

On Linux I compile this without errors.

And another minor issue.
I have raster 2007.tif. When I enter expression

2007@1 + 2007@2

I get "Expression invalid" message. Seems that raster names
only with digits and symbols "minus" (-) don't recognized as
valid raster names

value1 is already double.   So casting mat[i] should be enough.

Add ANALYSIS_EXPORT to the QgsRasterCalculator declaration in
src/analysis/raster/qgsrastercalculator.h:39:

Ok I could replicate that. Will fix.

According to the fine folks on #gdal (EvenR): "the pixels whose value
is nodata are excluded from the stats" - note that this is only the
nodata value considered by gdal - which isnt aware of any additional
nodata values you may have specified in the transparency tab.

Yes I am going to do this.

Right above should fix that.

I believe so - I will have a play and see how easy that will be.

Thanks for the feedback!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Release plans for QGIS 1.6
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5mwW8Qun6UuSff_C0PrFNSWOBAMsyRMT9cWqU@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS developers

We (the PSC) recently received a threat of legal action against our
use of the word 'Tethys' in the naming of the 1.5 release of QGIS. It
seems that the word Tethys is trademarked by a company in one country.
Although we feel their case is weak, we do not have the time, money or
inclination to engage in a legal battle over this. The PSC has decided
not to disclose the name of the company since we a) don't want to give
them any free publicity and b) prefer that we handle communications
with the company through the PSC in a discrete and polite manner from
our side rather than via a public forum.

Thus we would like to put out QGIS 1.6 as soon as possible. We have
opted for doing the 1.6 release rather than just a rebadged 1.5.1
release in the interests of conservation of effort. I hate doing
'rush' releases as they have in the past been sloppy and less polished
than those where we take our time to check everything properly, but
circumstances beyond our control are dictating this one.

This has a few implications:

- The PSC has agreed to stop using planetary moons as the names for
our releases, and embark on a new theme of using extremely obscure
place names (e.g. the mythical Tweebuffelsmeteenskootgeskietfontein in
South Africa).
- We need to go into a feature freeze as soon as possible
- The 1.6 release that was planned for december 2010 will still go out
but as 1.7
- Once 1.6 goes out we will remove the download and references to the
release name of 1.5 from the web site.

So if you have updates / features / fixes in the pipeline that are
stable, please get them into svn trunk as soon as possible. I will put
out a more detailed timeline for the 1.6 hopefully over this weekend.

Lastly a special request, please add your suggestions to the wiki [1]
of your favourite and extremely obscure town or place for this
release. Translate 'obscure' to mean 'not used as a trademark or
product name' anywhere in the world. I will pick one based probably on
how nice the pic is and how catchy the placename sounds. In future
releases we can have a more democratic approach to selection of the
release name. e.g. some kind of voting system.

Best regards

Tim

Seems that your application resources search path is not set (you
should see the full path before /resources/srs.db). Try setting the
application prefix path before trying to instantiate your CRS object
e.g.

QgsApplication::setPrefixPath( INSTALL_PREFIX, true );

Message-ID: <4CB93F44.2040406@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Converting (right click->Save as...) a shp in gpx results in an error:

creation of field DATA_INI failed (OGR error: Field of name 'DATA_INI' is not
supported in GPX schema. Use GPX_USE_EXTENSIONS creation option to allow use of the
<extensions> element.)

The field 'DATA_INI' is valid in DBF, what can we do about this?
All the best.

Hi Alexander and J?rgen

Thanks for your feedback and testing. I'm going to be out of contact for the 
next week (holydays in the mountains) and will probably do some further 
testing and cleaning of the sources, then publish an updated patch. 

It would be cool to have it in trunk after the 1.6 feature freeze.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Tim,

Many thanks for looking at that.

Regarding the NaN I will have to check because I think one of the  
raster I've used (geotiff) had its NaN set to 0 and the histogram was  
showing a spike at 0. But it could also be due to the Z-axis not  
showing real values!

Cheers,
Benoit

Hi

Our community prepare QGIS binaries with raster algebra patch
for OSGeo4W users who want to test this great improvement.

Here is a short installation instructions:
 1. install qgis-dev with all dependencies from OSGeo4W
 2. download archieve with binaries (~8.2 Mb compressed with 7-zip)
    http://gis-lab.info/share/alexbruy/qgis-calc-r14380.7z
 3. unpack it in OSGeo4W root folder (C:\OSGeo4W by default)
 4. open OSGeo shell and run qgis-calc.bat

Message-ID: <AANLkTimb60ciu61QRKBVNdpZQJB2RRHde3xN=NwRCUod@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I read the thread
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-October/011194.html

I don't know if exist a intellegible word not used from other subjects in
the world (googling on "Tethys" I discovered about 10+ subject using that)

However because I understand the actually qgis 1.5 will be dismissed for
qgis 1.6.
But even qgis 1.5 read ecw meanwhile qgis 1.6 don't.

I need to understand if with the dismission of qgis 1.5 for qgis 1.6.
will be lost forever the capability to read the ecw .

Thx,

it is needed the gdal17-ecw package in the osgeo4w installer, as the new
sdk from Erdas is now available.

I don't know the situation about linux/osx (that interest more to me).

Right, ECW support is dependent on GDAL and has nothing to do with a specific QGIS version (other than which version of GDAL it uses).

One thing about the *new* ECW SDK v4 is that so far (and very likely forever) it is Windows-only.  Everyone else is stuck with the partly working (at least on OS X) and now-hard-to-find v3.

Hi all.
I think the dependencies for building a deb should be changed;

dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libqt4-core (>= 4.4.0) libqt4-gui (>=
4.4.0)

In fact these are transitional packages, so they should be updated to libqtcore4 and
libqtgui4.

Thanks.

Does OSGeo have a position on this?  I thought the OSGeo umbrella was also
covering legal support.

Just curious - that would probably be a waste of time of resources anyway.

Do we need codenames at all?   Any name - obscure or not - could be a
trademark.

J?rgen,

We don't have legal resources "on call" and it could get quite expensive
to retain legal support so we very much lean towards avoiding legal
conflict.  However, if the need is there the board would consider
resourcing legal support for the projects.

How about making release names geographic. QGIS 1.6 "Moscow" sounds
good and easily memorizable.

I agree that real place names is a better idea. I could see lots of
Mythical/Fictitious names actually being claimed by people. I will also
point out that the Mozilla Foundation uses National Parks/Reserves in
the code naming of pre-release firefox branches and suggest that we
could do something with a greater cause as our release names:
Endangered Species, World Heritage Sites, Rivers, Mountain Peaks, etc..
(suggest your idea)

We could also de-emphasize the release name and use it amongst the
developer group to keep track of what's being worked on, ie the trunk
will have a name leading up to it's release and then switch names.

I also agree, to just avoid the issue as it's not worth our effort to fight.

Thanks,
Alex

Sorry in retrospect my original email was probably unclear. It was my
intention that we use *real* (hence photographable) place names, but
obscure ones that a) have some geographical interest and b) are
unlikely to ever have been used by someone as a trademark. Having a
theme to the place names would be fine (making them really obscure and
interesting was kind of my idea for a theme, but another theme would
be fine too).

Using well known places e.g. Moscow as Maxim suggests will lead to
similar conflicts as using planetary moons.

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pg table inheritance
Message-ID: <4CBAA1E1.4080903@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Has anybody tested QGIS against PostgreSQL inherited tables? I have a database with
parents and child, and everything works fine, but attribute tables are shown as
filled up with "ERROR". Data are read, geometries can be categorized, a shp can be
exported, but selection from the table does not work properly.
I'm planning of setting up a public clone of it for devs testing, is anyone is
interested.
All the best.

Any nice pics to go with your suggestion? I quite like the idea since
philosophically each release is another hill we have climbed and put
behind us :-)

Lets keep the discussion on-list ok?

Or characteristics contour lines of the hill (we are dealing with GIS

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 1.6 Release Timeline
Message-ID: <AANLkTikThknUTJOu=y0gN7KT8iqiXnZFDcMrEfEryAP0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Ok so my proposed (extremely short) timeline for releasing 1.6 is:

Feature freeze AND string freeze : 24 October 2010
Code freeze, branch and call for packaging: 31 October 2010
Release announcement date: November 7 2010

As per usual exact day of release will depend on package availability.

So now is a good time to identify any show stoppers.

Does anybody find this short timeline problematic?

I started a checklist page for 1.6 at:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.6

If anybody has ideas and suggestions for interesting things to
highlight for the visual changelog, please make a note of them here:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/VisualChangeLog1.6.0

Regards

Tim

Hello,

 

I don't understand why ECW support is not included in this version. GDAL
1.7.2 now support ECW, also I downloaded ERDAS SDK kit 4.1 last night.

I think a lot of users use ECW in their projects.

 

Thank you for answers and all good work you done.

 

Best regards, Joze.

 Hi all,

Is it possible to access the histogramVector attribute from the
QgsRasterBandStats Class in Python code from a plugin?

When the following code is run it issues the error:
AttributeError: 'QgsRasterBandStats' object has no attribute
'histogramVector'

self.theLayer.populateHistogram(1,grd.S.nClass)
myStats = self.theLayer.bandStatistics(1)
grd.S.Histo[0, 0] = myStats.histogramVector[0].y()

where 'self.theLayer' is a one band raster image and 'grd.S.nClass' = 40001

Python version: 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32
bit (Intel)]
QGIS version: 1.6.0-Trunk Trunk, 14378

Hi

I see that member is commented out in the sip file for rasterbandstats:

python/core/qgsrasterbandstats.sip

 40     //HistogramVector * histogramVector;

If I uncomment it I get a compile time error:

sip: QgsRasterBandStats::histogramVector has an unsupported type -
provide %GetCode and %SetCode
make[2]: *** [python/analysis/sipanalysispart0.cpp] Error 1
make[1]: *** [python/CMakeFiles/python_module_qgis_analysis.dir/all] Error 2

So I guess the sip bindings need some tweaking to make it work.

As an aside, if you are planning any tweaks improvements to the raster
historgram, it would be great to do it as a patch to existing
properties dialog rather than as a separate plugin. I found out how to
enable zoom (but I wont do it in time for 1.6 release) on the charts.
I also plan to add to the chart the user configured min/max entries
per band, and maybe later a way to interactively set them on the
chart.

Regards

Tim

 Hi Tim,

Many thanks for your reply.

I see that the API doc classifies HistogramVector as a QVector but I
cannot find any reference of QVector in the Qt doc (there are QVector2D,
QVector3D and QVector4D). Could it be the problem?

What I'm trying to do is to improve the speed of my plugin '1-band
raster colour table' that allows to create colour table from a colour
palette and a colouring method. As I'm doing it in Python, the
computation of the stats and histogram takes for ever on large rasters.
I was hoping to piggyback on the stats and histo function built in QGIS
(they themselves are (very) slow on large rasters).

I agree that this work should be patched to the current code, but I'm
not able to program in C++/C...
So once the python plugin works as expected, it would be a good idea to
hand it over to a C++ guru for patching!

Cheers,
Benoit

The "GRASS QGIS Module List" wiki page [1] holds a list of the GRASS 
modules now available from the QGIS GRASS Toolbox. Hamish suggested [2] 
to color code the list (similar to the Live DVD packaging matrix).
I've started to add color coding to the wiki page. I did just a few 
entries to see how it looks.

Comments welcome, before I go ahead and set status coloring for all modules.

I found QVector in my (Qt 4.7) docs using Qt Assistant - not sure why
its not showing up for you. Perhaps it is not ported to the python SIP
lib.

Yup I use your plugin regularly - its great!

Right this is an issue. Part of the reason why QGIS is so slow is that
it actually does two complete scans of each pixel to calculate the
stats. This is needed for computing stddev - although since writing
that code I have seen a way to compute stddev in a single pass - I
just need to find the formula and the time to implement that.

GDAL computes stats more quickly as it a) doesnt calculate stddev and
b) will estimate things like min/max, histograms etc if you like based
on a sampling of the data.

GDAL can also store gathered stats (you may have noticed aux.xml files
lying around in your raster dirs).

In the longer term I would like to a) persist QGIS gathered stats, b)
implement faster stddev calcs as mentioned above and c) only compute
IO intensive stats like stddev if they are actually needed (e.g. if
the user elects to use stddev in the raster symbology options).

Yeah if I have time I may take a look - your plugin is really needed
in the core of QGIS.

Hi

Ok I went with Giovanni's suggestion of Capiopo for this release - see
the new splash screen in trunk.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinKpsnuzxVTL2YwazMF14RBTAyGXbzrmpu3iA2K@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I've tried to open a qgs file made with qgis 1.4 on qgis 1.5
(ubuntu binaries on ubuntu 9.10) but qgis 1.5 crashes before
completing the loading of all layers.
Is there any way I can debug the qgs file? In particular,
I would like to edit the qgs file and delete after a given layer,
but guess that there is  a part at the end that I should keep.

Thanks

Agus

Its managed in two places:

QgsRasterLayer and QgsLegendLayer:

void QgsLegendLayer::rasterLayerSymbology( QgsRasterLayer* layer )
{
  SymbologyList itemList;
  QPixmap legendpixmap = layer->legendAsPixmap( true ).scaled( 20, 20,
Qt::KeepAspectRatio );
  itemList.append( qMakePair( QString(), legendpixmap ) );

  changeSymbologySettings( layer, itemList );
}

I dont see any way to tweak this from python api though. Python users
please correct me if I missed something....

Regards

Tim

 Hi Tim,

Just after upgrading to release 14390 the histogram function works like
a charm when I open *for the first time* the raster properties window.
Thank you!

But, if I close the raster property window while in the histogram tab
and try to re-open it, QGIS crashes!
In fact I cannot open any raster properties window after that without
having QGIS crash...
I've edited the 'row' value in the RasterLayerProperties in the registry
to set it to 1 (from 6) and I can again use QGIS normally.
So it seems that the raster properties window bombs out QGIS if it opens
in the histogram tab (row=6).

Can you reproduce this behaviour in Linux/Mac/Other win?

I'm on WindowsXP in OSGeo4W.

One comment: the stats are computed each time the histogram tab is
opened. For large raster it takes a long time to compute the histogram.
Would it be best to save the histogram somewhere and reuse it?

Cheers,
Benoit

 Hi again Tim,

Thanks for your reply.
It seems that what you are describing is the small thumbnail icon of the
raster, isn't it?

What I'm really looking for is a way to change the small colour scale
bar below the thumbnail to display a full colour scale bar with numbers
(as created with the 'colour scale bar' plugin for example). So far
absolutely no luck in Python...

Cheers,
Benoit

Subject: [Qgis-developer] porjectRead() and newProject() signals
Message-ID: <AANLkTikq-EJb+z9rkyGXUme_wuwADS6LtbpBEHPyz0L5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Some plugins stores their settings in QGIS project. And when user open
previously saved project read setting from it, when created new project -
default settings used and plugin GUI is resetted. For example in Copyright
label plugin

void QgsCopyrightLabelPlugin::initGui()
{
  ...
  //this resets this plugin up if a project is loaded
  connect( qGisInterface->mainWindow(), SIGNAL( projectRead() ), this,
SLOT( projectRead() ) );
  ...
  //initialise default values in the gui
  projectRead();
}

But projectRead() and newProject() are not documented, some info available
only in qgisapp.h. Is it possible to add this signals to the QGisInterface
and add some documentaion?

New Zealand "Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipuk

Hi,
under mac os x I cannot use somes plugins with qgis 1.5 because I receive
this error:

...
ImportError:
/Applications/QGIS_1.5/Qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/pygraphviz/_graphviz.so:

ImportError:
/Applications/QGIS_1.5/Qgis.app/Contents/MacOS/../Resources/python/matplotlib/_path.so:

I'm under mac os x snow leopard with python 2.6.

How can I solve this problem?

Thank's a lot

Did anyone ever have contact with the SFLC[1]?  They even have a IRC channel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Interlis support of OGR inside QGIS (make it
 default? modify make files? Windows but not only...)
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=RRjj5=kzwjOwAA7WWnM-LOGGPJuHQ4zG4q3Uv@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to import/export INTERLIS geodata inside QGIS under Windows
(XP Professional) - but had no luck so far.

There are two QGIS plugins around, "OGR Converter" (C++) and
"Interlis" (Python) which obviously call OGR/GDAL libraries.
"OGR Converter" doesn't list Interlis format and "Interlis" plugin
reports "The GDAL/OGR library you are using has beend compiled without
Interlis support".
I'm talking about INTERLIS format version 1 and 2 (read/write).

I fear that the default make files for GDAL/OGR do not include
INTERLIS libraries.
I know also that there is a problem - at least under Windows and MacOS
- of ogr/gdal accessing java jar packages (ili2.jar) unless they are
copied in the default library search path - or even in every directory
where programs and data reside.

1.Can anybody involved in delivering the (Windows) binaries and in
committing to the "OGR Converter" and "Interlis" plugins have a look
at this problem?

=> To me an optimal solution would be, that Interlis support is
included by default in all QGIS deliveries.

2. Is there any workaround? Eventually I can replace the GDAL/OGR .dll
(.so) myself?

Yours, S.

How did you install pygraphviz and matplotlib?  Source? binary?  from binary, I'm guessing that only 32bit builds are available.

You could force all of Qgis to run 32bit: Get Info on the application and check the box "Open in 32bit mode".

Hi Stefan,

You should use Marco Hugentoblers Interlis plugin to load files, which,
like you said uses OGR. It just makes the OGR handling easier and allows
to select only certain topics/tables.

What exactly is the problem? What error message are you getting?

I believe that Interlis should be enabled by default by QGIS 1.5 or QGIS
1.6. It works on my machine for small and medium sized itf's but fails for
big itfs. I haven't tested Interlis 2 so far.

Andreas

Hi William, and thanks.
I've installed pygraphviz from source (I found also Qgis don't allow
pygraphviz to find graphviz, and I must to add a simple hack to make to work
inside qgis) and matplotlib from easy_install.

I don't understand where find Open in 32bit mode.

Under /Applications/Qgis/ Show Contents -> I found Info.plist
I opened it and I add a string:

Executable architectures
and add Intel-64 bit

but nothing change.

I think I need to allow Qgis to allow the 64bit python modules....

Sorry William, I'm stupid! I didn't understand I need only to open the file
info of Qgis app!
Now I don't receive the error about 32-bit mode.

Thanks a lot!!!

I'm trying to use OGR in whatever plugin under QGIS and Windows XP.

The error reported in a QGIS window is "The GDAL/OGR library you are
using has been compiled without Interlis support".

I think you (and Horst too) are using Linux, so it seems to me I'm the
first user of the Interlis plugin :->?

The plugin "Interlis" (Python) mentioned before is the one from Marco
(via http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/python_plugins/python_plugins.xml)
=> Or do you mean another one?

Looking inside <settings>\.qgis\python\plugins\interlis\interlisplugin.py
there is an obious test:
Interlis support".

Replacing C:\Programs\OSGeo4W\bin\ogr2ogr.exe did'nt help neither
which is weird, because calling the same ogr2ogr.exe out of a Windows
shell reports
     -f "Interlis 1"
     -f "Interlis 2"
as possible values.

Yours, S.

Hi Stefan,

I use the plugin on Windows (OSGeo4W) and Linux.

Are you using the OSGeo4W installer or the Windows standalone installer? I
have only experience with the OSGeo4W installer, which I believe comes
with Interlis support out of the box. At least it works on several of our
windows machines. It may be that you manually have to copy the ili2c.jar
fileinto a path reachable by osgeo. You can copy ili2c.jar to
\OSGeo4Wroot\bin (on my machines it is C:\Programme\OSGeo4W\bin). Since
ili2c.jar is based on Java, you also need Java.

Also, with OSGeo4W you have to use at least QGIS 1.5 or trunk (qgis-dev).

I have no experience with the Windows standalone installation. It may be
that the OGR included with that version does not support Interlis.

Hope this helps. The goal should be have Interlis support enabled by
default - I agree.

Andreas

I'm not sure what contact if any was made with them, though I think
the folks dealing with the issue were aware of them.

The concensus was to pick our battles and take a stand when the
cost-benefit makes it worthwhile.

Thanks a lot for the patch. I have taken a brief look on it and I have
one suggestion: IMHO it would be better to keep the parser (and
interpreter) for raster algebra and "search strings" separate. I
understand that it is easier to reuse some of the code from search
strings with raster algebra, but the semantics is very different. And
there are various functions and operators that work only for one of
them, so mixing them together complicates the inner working of the
search string interpreter. Extending the languages (e.g. usage of
raster neighborhood, further string operations) will make the code
even more cluttered.

My vision is that search strings should continue to evolve to support
a reasonable subset of SQL language, while raster algebra language can
evolve to support further raster/matrix operations. Keeping these
different languages separately may bring brighter future for both :-)

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] CSWclient is available
Message-ID: <57107438.20101018161658@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

we're pleased to announce availability of CSWclient plugin from
GIS-Lab repo. CSWclient is a tool that makes easier work with Catalogue
Services. It allows to browse through and access non-spatial and
spatial data. CSWclient is inspired by proof-of-concept qgCSW plugin.

Some more functions:
- server management functionality (add new, edit or delete existing servers from list);
- ability to save and load servers from exchange file;
- user-friendly displaying server and record metadata
- search by keywords (single keyword or comma-separated list);
- grabbing Bbox from map canvas or enter it by hand;
- option to setup number of records to return;
- user-friendly displaying for search results;
- navigation through search results (first, last, prev, next);
- "Open URL" button for records with "downloadableData" type (If there
is an URL in record metadata user can open this URL in the default browser)
- "Add to WMS list" button for records with "liveData" type. If there
is an URL in record metadata user can try to add this URL to the QGIS WMS servers list.
- OWSLib included in plugin sources, so there is no dependencies;

CSWclient plugin is at the experimental stage and all kinds of comments are welcome.

He said he was going to remove it, so it should be ok to remove it.
I agree is very annoying.
Of course the plugins should be saved (copying them to pyqgis?).
All the best.

Hi Andreas, Frank, everyone (Marco is currently in holidays)

I solved my problems so far. I initially had to uninstall QGIS and reinstall it.

=> I suggest to update http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with
information regarding upgrading (based on
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/OSGeo4wSetup)

Then I located the problem in file interlisdialog.py in the Interlis
plugin: see below.
The problem boils down to the check (functions checkJRE and
checkFileInPath) if java runtime is installed - which fails because
under Win XP (I think all Windows OS) >>> there is no "java" file;
it's called "java.exe".

=> Any ideas are welcome on how to best do the checkJRE in an elegant
OS independent way :->

Yours, S.


That's the current code in line 45 ff. of interlisdialog.py (at
<settings>/.qgis/python/plugins/interlis/) to be enhanced:
    #checks if there is a java runtime available
    def checkJRE(self):
        jrePresent = self.checkFileInPath("java")
        return jrePresent

    #checks if ili2c.jar is in the path
    def checkIli2c(self):
        ili2cFound = self.checkFileInPath("ili2c.jar")
        return ili2cFound

    #checks if a given filename is contained in directory contained in
the PATH environment variable
    def  checkFileInPath(self, filename):
        fileFound = False
        pathVariable = os.environ['PATH']
        pathString = QString(pathVariable)
        #on Unix, entries are separated with ':'
        osString = sys.platform
        if(osString == "win32" or osString == "cygwin"):
            pathStringList = pathString.split(";")
        else:
            pathStringList = pathString.split(":")

        for i in range(pathStringList.count()):
            filePath = QFileInfo(QDir(pathStringList[i]),  QString(filename))
            if filePath.exists():
                fileFound = True
                break
        return fileFound

                Yes please go ahead and close it. My Linux server died and I haven't got a replacement running yet. I will put the site up on another server soon for those people who have those site imbedded in their QGIS. And I will put the plugins up on the public repo.

Ok, I'll update the installer so qgis 1.6 will remove the existing entry from 
its repo list.

Hi all.
Am I the only one to perceive the need for a plugin trac+svn (or git)?
If we decide we need it, it would be much better to have it in place before the
hackfest, so we can start hacking around it in Wroklaw.
All the best.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikih7Q2Z6w9bMsWhJurGrL+EYwkceNAdE7ybUUr@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
    I am new to Python binding for QGIS. I have been having problem in
getting a Vector Layer to be loaded. I typed the following on python
console:

>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> layer=QgsVectorLayer("/path/to/shape/file.shp","layer","ogr")
Failed to load

The output is "Failed to load" which isn't very helpful and doesn't specify
the cause. I am not sure what is the problem. I have confirmed that filepath
is correct and the shp file can be opened in QGIS. I would appreciate if
someone could help me solve the problem.

Regards,
Jitendra

having a developed plugin trac/rating/svn system will definitely
make devs and users life easier.

If well implemented it might even help to lure back satellite plugin repos,
like ours :) We'd definitely migrate if we have flexible plugin repo
with all these goodies. Current official repo is a
good first step, but weak in terms of needed functionality.

I understand the point but it makes it harder to discover for a new
comer which layer has to modified and to follow the evolution of an icon
(individual svg permit previews in the file manager).

Mainly the vertex/save/measure elements but this issue (I'm a mole) is
due to the very pale colorset with not enought contrast, I have to focus
my view on each icons to differentiate them. Another difficulty is that
somes lack "thickness" like the scissor or the refresh part of mActionDraw.

Hi all.
We found a couple of problems in the plugin:
- elevation data are not recorded in the table
- if a layer is not in EPSG:43226, elevations are correct, but the point 
on the map is placed at the latlong coordinates instead of the place 
where it has been clicked.
Thanks.

You are right. Let's go in this direction...

This is not only your opinion, so in new version I will increase 
contrast. And use more colors :)
Thanks for your comments and I'm waiting for more.

Hi all,
just trying to reach Cagil Seker, the developer of the new visbility
analysis plugin available in the contributed repo.

Hi there! thanks for the plugin! Just a a few notes:

*) the gui is not well optmized for Linux (see attached screenshot)

*) regardless the number (integer) I'm using for the observer height, it
keeps asking to use zero or positive height for the observer.


Cheers

I'm also noticing that there isn't a button to close the dialog and also

Hi all.
We (Faunalia, for Regione Toscana) have developed a couple of plugins: RT SQL layer,
to build arbitrary select queries and load results on the canvas, and RT PostGIS
extractor, to export large amounts of data cut by another vector (in PostGIS or drawn
by hand.
Thy are in production now, and we feel they are mature enough for being of general
(even if specialized) use. We request therefore their inclusion in trunk. We are
committed to their maintenance.
All the best.

Hi,

No idea what the problem is, but I know that J?rgen Fischer included
nested grouping (looking forward to using it) just recently in the trunk.

Maybe it is a side-effect?

Hi all.
Thanks to the patience of Linel, we tested his problem, but we cannot reach a
conclusion: in my case this problems happens always, in Lionel machines never.
The only difference easy to spot is QGIS version (1.5 for Linoel, trunk in my case).
Could someone confirm?
Thanks.

Hi,
I think the problem is the &: all the "&" must be replaced with "&amp;"
This replacement should be done automatically by the .xml repo generator.
Could someone fix both the file and the generator?

Cheers.

+1 for getting them into trunk

We would use them for teaching Postgis as a way to visualize the queries.
Or for myself for quick visualizations while testing SQL commands.

I wonder what is the best way to organize all those Postgis plugins. Would
they get their own toolbar or menu?

thanks, it seems solved.

BTW there is another issue, but is a minor one.
Here the way to reproduce it:
1. I drag a layer and it becomes hidden
2. then I drop the layer in an invalid place and it returns visible
3. then I drag again the same layer and it remains visible.

The problem is that the layer remains selected after I drop it in an invalid
place,
so at the next attempt the execution returns at line 277 without hidden
anything.

Cheers.

I think we should have a "Database" dropdown close by the sister dropdowns "Vector"
(AKA fTools) and "Raster" (AKA GDALTools).
All the best.

Hi
I think it would be great if this new 'database' section could be made
to work with spatialite as well as with postgis. Maybe the creation of
a general manager for spatial databases that could integrate the
'Postgis manager', 'Spatialite manager', 'RT SQL layer' and the rest
of the functionality of the other plugins that are related. I guess
this would need some kind of abstraction layer, and some (probably a
lot of) extra work.
This could maybe become a solid base for other people to develop more
specialized plugins to deal with database queries and analysis.

Maybe I'm being too ambitious and starting with the incorporation of
Faunalia's tools is good enough ;)

Hi,
when trying to run  RT PostGIS Extractor on Debian Lenny (Qt 4.4.3) it 
is crashing with following error:

We where already solving similar problem in Table Manager.
'self.progressBar.setProperty("value",QtCore.QVariant(0))' was fixing 
the problem.

  I think, it would be very good to merge all good plugins derived from 
Martin's PostGIS Manager to one General database manager. Current 
tendency of creating PostGIS plugins by copying Martin's pluging, 
leaving 90% of code as is, even if I do not need, is not very good idea.
Or, if not merging them, maybe creating some base library from Martin's  
PostGIS Manager code can be a solution. What do You think ?

Hi all.
The SQL query fails to show the muneric results in cases like this:

SELECT round(ST_Perimeter(the_geom)::numeric,2)
FROM province;

Any explanation? Perhaps the :: type cast is not well understood?

Agreed: that was also our original idea. Unfotunately this proved more difficult than
forecast; this kind of integration is one of the main forces that drive me towards
pushing for a common SVN+trac for all plugin, so that merging and splitting of code
will be much easier, and replications lessened.
All the best.

Hi Ivan ,
yes, I remember the thread.
It's always the same pyuic4 bug, so I've to remove the value from the .ui
file
and set it in the class constructor by code.

Thanks for reporting it.
Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] horizontal lines pdf/ps/image output
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Mg=s4Ehb7eNEtJ=OeXRa55xUAq6oUZgLyCpzL@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

using qgis (1.5, I believe) to generate a bathymetric map from data
for the Bering Strait, I came across horizontal lines when trying to
output the map in print composer in any way. The process was a good
success in that everything which was needed could be done and the
result was very useful for the biologist who wanted a good looking map
of the "sunken land bridge". There was not anything online. It might
have even been faster than using ArcMap, apart from the issue below.

The map has raster bathymetry with a custom color map, a transparent
grey scale shaded relief on top, and contours. The horizontal lines
show up after I compose a map and then output the map in any way. They
do not show up in the main qgis window or the print compose. They
become more frequent when I increase the resolution to say 600 dpi. At
300 dpi there is just one. At 150 dpi there is none. I believe it
might have to do how images are partitioned into small rectangles, and
perhaps the transparent layer ?  Since the output might be managed by
Qt, there may not be a lot of options but it was an important issue.
After all, in the end you need to output.

Another, unrelated issue, with output was that the colors were only
correct in the postscript. In the pdf and image output they were too
dark, perhaps a transparency issue.Also text seemed rasterized when on
top of images.

It was a joy to be able to import easily the ASCII grid, to crop it,
to easily warp it to a suitable projection, to easily generate
contours and shaded relief, and to add some annotation in the print
composer.

Hi Andreas,

Although I am not the developer of the print composer (Marco Hugentobler 
is) I can provide some background on the issue.

Indeed it is a result of image partitioning. I believe there are 
horizontal stripes. With higher resolution this issue gets worth. The 
striping was introduced because people want to output high resolution 
map layouts at large sizes (e.g. A0). Of course rendering everything in 
a big raster (A0, 600 or 1200dpi) you would easily run out of memory.

The other issue is that people want to print high resolution from WMS 
sources. WMS servers are often limited to e.g. 1000 to 2000 pixel for 
one side of an image request. Therefore QGIS has to do several requests 
for getting the image on high resolution.

I think that there is a very small overlap of the stripes, because some 
printers would render small white stripes for adjacent images. Now, when 
transparency gets involved you will unfortunately see thoses overlapping 
stripes.

Question: are you rendering WMS or file-based images (e.g. tiff)? Would 
it help if you could configure the size of a stripe or even render 
everything in one tile? Can you provide a sample output to see how bad 
the issue really is? Do you have any idea to better solve the problem of 
outputting high resolution rasters at large paper sizes? I would also be 
interested to see the bathymetric map, btw.

I am sure Marco can provide more background on the issue. He is on 
holidays this week. I am sure he'll chime in on the issue and possible 
workarounds.

Hi Paolo

I would agree to include PostGIS plugins to trunk, but IMHO it makes
much more sense to have only one PostGIS plugin to do all management
tasks. I think some effort should be done to integrate the plugins
into one prior to inclusion to the trunk... It's hard to force people
to do this kind of boring work once the code is included in
repository.

Martin

I completely agree that having an infrastructure for easy development
and bug tracking for plugins would help the authors with deployment
and cooperation.

Still I see several issues that have to be resolved in order to have
the repository working. Let's concentrate on the idea of having SVN
repository for the plugins. The repository would automatically update
its XML file with the list of available plugins. Some of the important
questions:
- what users should be granted write access to this SVN?
- who would manage the permissions to the individual plugins?
- should we require all plugins to be within this SVN repository or
allow 'external' ones?
- how to deal with official/contributed plugins?

There were also thoughts about introducing an infrastructure that
would enable to count number of downloads and user ratings - this
would probably require development of a web application that would
present this information.

We should maybe have a look around how other projects deal with the
infrastructure and security model for plugins - Firefox, KDE etc.

Hi Martin.
I agree that it is better either to integrate all tools into one or, perhaps even
better, to have a modular approach, so it will be easier to add new tools.
I also agree that it is better to do this work before putting it into trunk, but I
think we need a collaborative platform (a plugin SVN) where several devs can
cooperate (see the other mail).
So my suggestion could be rephrased as: let's put our plugins on an svn, and start
merging them. Afterwards they can be moved to trunk.
How does this sound?
All the best.

It seems that we all agree on this: if there are different opinions, please stand out.

> - what users should be granted write access to this SVN?

My suggestion is to take a liberal approach, allowing all those who ask and accept
the licence and guidelines (maybe the guidelines should be simplified in this case? I
have to check). We can always remove malicious users in case of trouble, and remove
their code.

> - who would manage the permissions to the individual plugins?

I agree with Frank Warmerdam that having fine-grained permissions is not worth the
fuss. Reverting unwanted changes is simple enough, and the shame of making public
mistakes should prevent most problems.

> - should we require all plugins to be within this SVN repository or
> allow 'external' ones?

My position is: this repo should be the standard, embedded in QGIS, but the user
should be allowed to add any additional repo by hand.
I may be wrong, of course.

> - how to deal with official/contributed plugins?

To me this distinction does not make much sense: I see core plugins (in trunk) and
additional plugins (in the separate svn). Among the additional there will be all sort
of nuances, from the very strong but of limited use to the proof-of-concept.

> We should maybe have a look around how other projects deal with the

Exactly: this is a big win IMHO.
I would be happy if we could set up the svn+trac before the hackfest, and build up
the webapp during it.

All the best.

yes, there should be an option to add your own repository, just as it is
currently the case. Often there are "inhouse" plugins (like a search or
database metadata plugin) that is not of interest to the general public
because it is tied to a certain infrastructure, or may even contain/or
allow access to confidential information. These "inhouse" plugins should
still be allowed to be distributed through an inhouse plugin repository as
it is currently the case.

It would be good if there could be some sort of quality assurance for
plugins in the general, publically available repository. Not only because
it may be bad press for QGIS if there are "too experimental" or "poor
quality" plugins in the official repository, but also because it may help
the user to see what plugins are popular and commonly used.

Another issue is a minimum of documentation. This is a draw-back of the
current system or situation. Often you install a plugin and you have no
idea what it does. Just the name and the one-line description is not good
enough. And often you don't know where the plugin ends up in the UI. Which
is fine, if there is a quick intro.

People need to know:

* where is the UI of the plugin (menu location, toolbar, extensions of
existing dialogues)
* what the plugin really does. Sometimes, a one-line description is good
enough, but quite often it is not
* status of the plugin: experimental, production
* a way to point to a website of the plugin (URL) for further information
* who is the author: person, organization
* are there support options specifically for the plugin?
* additional documentation on the behavior of the plugin
* maybe a way for users to comment/rate the plugin (only for registered
users, to avoid spam)
* a way to report bugs, feature requests on a plugin (trac?)
* maybe a way to show HTML documentation/screenshots of the plugin in
action in the plugin installer before installation of the plugin to inform
the user if it is worth to install the plugin or not. One could embed
qtwebkit for this purpose into the plugin installer
* date metadata: when was the plugin released and last updated

Just my opinions or expectations on a new plugin repo and, maybe related,
an improved version of the installer. I think the current installer is
very nice, but if the repo adds additional functionality it may have to be
enhanced.

All the best,
Andreas

Firefox has a central distribution site, but no central SCM AFAIK.
KDE has recently set up a new git based infrastructure 
(http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitFAQ). They're running a Redmine site 
http://projects.kde.org/ collecting the subprojects.
The Ruby community has a central distribution site (http://rubygems.org/) with 
a very easy upload mechanism (http://rubygems.org/pages/gem_docs)

My proposal would be to start with a github account as a central SCM for 
QGIS plugins. Similar to http://github.com/grails-plugins 
(http://grails.org/plugin/home) e.g. Write access can then still be granted 
per-plugin.
Having Redmine would give the advantage of having sub-projects. Organizing 
plugins as sub-projects means, that each plugin has their own trac-like site 
but tickets are also collected on master-project level (e.g. qgis-plugins).

Redmine looks wonderful, thanks for the review.
One thing that worries me is: changing from the current structure for bug reports,
committing etc. to a new one could discourage develpers and users alike (remember,
most people are lazy).
Other issue: what should be installed on OSGeo servers? I think we have some
limitations there.
What other devs think about this?
All the best.

Hi Martin.
One more problem: in the Table view of the plugin, fields of the type numeric
(720900) are not displayed (empty), whereas if I SELECT them I can see from the SQL
window.

I'm a lazy developer, too ;-) But do we only want to attract grey-haired GIS 
experts with long time CVS (you remember?) experience? In about two years from 
now you will have to explain people how this non-distributed SCM called SVN is 
working ;-)

AFAIK we have virtual machines there. I would volunteer in setting up a 
Redmine instance using the OSGeo LDAP logins. In our company we migrated all 
Trac instances to one Redmine installation more than two years ago.

	qgis-1.5.0
Message-ID: <489684.20422.qm@web94908.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

The compile process of qgis seems very painful. After encountering and solving numerous errors during Makefiles generation [CMake], now hit the block at compiling. Just solved an issue, and then linker errors show up!:

undefined reference to _imp_...
ld returned 1 exit status

This error is for each of _imp_*. So I did the following 2 steps:
make clean
make LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS --enable-auto-import"

Still same errors occur. What is the workaround? Do I have to again run CMake to generate Makefiles with proper LDFLAGS set?

Thanks in advance

Aside: 
Also, qgis1.5 or even 1.0 has many compiling issues. The svn trunk has updated files but qgis-1.5 source download does not! And to make it worse, I'm not able to checkout latest from svn trunk because of some proxy server issues resulting in my svn client's "could not connect to server 'svn.osgeo.org" ! :(

Anyways Regards,
Ameet

On Windows that is, if you use MinGW.  The "official" builds use OSGeo4W
dependencies and Visual C++, which doesn't have the problems you have hit.

The MinGW port is pretty much unmaintained.  As is the build documentation -
checkout ms-windows/osgeo4w/package.cmd for "instructions" how to build with
Visual C++.

I'm not opposed to trying Redmine, but I do like the simplicity of
http://trac-hacks.org/
Each plugin gets one wiki page(more if they need) and one folder in the
svn, really simple and straightforward. No real need for elaborate sites
per plugin.

I'm also unconcerned about SVN going away any time soon, or trac for
that matter: both are well used/known. I would feel more comfortable if
more than one QGIS web admin knows Redmine well, since we know trac is
well understood by OSGeo Admins.

QGIS has it's own VM on the OSGeo machines, so anything the PSC is
willing to try is fair game. There's also the adhoc VM for more
experimental stuff.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi everyone,
A friend of mine recently told me that wktraster is already storing and
loading raster to postgres. And it's even doing some spatial analisys with
vector data overlayed.
I've written a simple plugin to load wktraster tables into QGIS as gdal 1.7
already has a driver.
Sorry for the Windows users as I couldn't find a QGIS built with gdal 1.7
support so no wktraster for windows users.
I've tested with ubuntu-gis qgis' build.

At the moment the plugin DOES NOT list the existing tables, so you have to
TYPE THE TABLENAME in the editbox.

The plugin is available at the contributed repository.
Hope it's usefull

Hi Alex,

It was not my intension to promote a Trac alternative. For me, the main 
question is still the SCM organisation. Personally, I don't want to give away 
the control of all our plugin source code. But having centralized access to 
the sources and a bug tracker is a benefit for all.
Trac is still a good tool for developers. Right now, QGIS is using it as a bug 
tracking tool and source code viewer.
The plugin repo is also an end user site, where QGIS users can find information 
about plugins. But when I show a trac page like http://trac-hacks.org/ to one 
of my customers, they instinctively know, that they're looking at a page for 
hackers (not only from the name).
Redmine is also inspired by Sourceforge, which fits quite well for a plugin 
ecosystem. The sub-project organisation would help that end user bug reports 
go to the right place without loosing the overview over all plugins. With its 
internationalization support it could also replace other QGIS portals in a 
long term. But like Trac it's far away from sites like addons.mozilla.org, 
which I think is out of reach for now. An automatically generated nice link 
page on the QGIS homepage or wiki could be good start.

No doubt that SVN will reach the age of CVS. But a new generation of SCM  
systems is here and sooner or later also the FOSSGIS world will adapt it 
(http://github.com/openlayers/).
In case the QGIS devs vote for setting up setup a Redmine instance, I would 
certainly instruct other QGIS admins in Wroclaw. I will also attend the next 
FOSS4G in Denver, where I can show it other interested OSGEO admins....

Pirmin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom query for the spatialite provider
Message-ID: <AANLkTinAiXh46j3CiEZZnbB_yc3MranqTVMG2tfZMMgz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

a few days ago I wrote a patch to load a spatialite layer using a custom
query.
It works in the same manner as it was done for the postgres provider.

Here the ticket [1].

I know that Nov 23 starts the feature freeze, but I hope we can include it
in QGis1.6.
I did many tests and seems it works fine.

The following is a python code snippet of its usage:

sql = "SELECT t.PK_UID, t.Name, (t.Peoples/1000) AS KPeoples, t.Geometry
FROM Towns AS t, Regions AS r WHERE r.Name = 'TOSCANA' AND t.Peoples > 10000
AND Contains(r.Geometry, t.Geometry)",
uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setDatabase('/home/brushtyler/Projects/Work/Faunalia/spatialite/test-2.3.sqlite')
uri.setDataSource('', '(%s)' % sql, 'Geometry', '', 'PK_UID')
qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer(uri.uri(), "Towns in RT", 'spatialite')


Cheers.

Maybe we need to re-ask, re-answer the questions:
Who is the site for?
What information should it contain?
How much control do plugin authors need over their plugin?

I see in the discussion 2 different sites:
G1. For plugin authors, and bug reporters
G2. For general qgis users

My opinion is that the site is for group 1 and that group 2 will still
search for and explore plugins via the QGIS plugin installer.
G1. This is something like trac-hacks, github etc where it's about
getting to the code and helping as easily as possible. If you're clients
aren't coders or into bug reporting (most people are not) then this site
isn't for them.
G2. This site would be like the mozilla add-ons, which really could be
derived from the metadata for each plugin and automatically generated
into some site, or intergrated into the QGIS main site. Theoretically
bug reporting could be redirected from here to a pre-filled form that
already fills in which plugin they are reporting on.

I do see that it would be nice to find a way to make bug reporting
easier for less technical people, but we have to remember that will also
increase the number of duplicate, user error, and erroneous bug reports.

The SCM discussion in my mind is backseat(not critical), and if we care
to really go down the road there are big lists of pros/cons to each
option. DVCS is not the panacea cure all for all projects.

I look forward to poking at Redmine with you in Denver.

Thanks,
Alex

Weird: after installing the plugin, the toolbar pops up with empty icons. Restarting QGIS make the icons appear. Can you reproduce this? (Please update to 0.5.0)

Even restartin QGIS does not solve the issue.
This is on Debian unstable, QGIS self packaged.

After I install it I can see all toolbar icons without restarting QGis.

Let me also go back to basic:
- we *need* a bug reporting system for plugins: this is very urgent IMHO
- we need a collaboration platform: it would be so much better if we could fix each
other's bugs, and collaborate merging now separated, possibly complementary, plugins.
 Sorry Pirmin, I do not understand when you write "give away the control of ...
source code"; I understand however the need for a benevolent dictator for each
plugin, but this should not mean impossibility to contribute code to it, IMHO
- our users would like a documentation, popularity, and feedback system
- we need simple systems, easy to administer, not to use too much resources in
keeping the system going.
Anything else?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fTools buffer bug
Message-ID: <AANLkTin1FoH9ac8g5jd_dJtKSPnpNxtO8RK5Yrsqmq8T@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm preparing a QGIS demo for tomorrow's italian Linux Day meeting and I'm
hitting an error with Ftools->buffering.

Basically, I'm building a 20 m buffer around a selected linestring (first I
select one geometry from a postgis vector layer, but I get the same result
if the selected geometry comes from a sqlite file), I'm saving the buffer in
/home/me/tmp/buf.shp, the plugin says :

Shapefile in ouput creato:

/home/me/tmp/buf.shp

but the file is not there (and this is a bug: the message shouldn't say the
the file has been created when it is not), adding to the legend throws an
error since the file does not exists and cannot be loaded.

The problem originates from QGIS shapefile writer which cannot resolve
conflicts between field names (which are truncated at 8 chars or so AFAIK).

I soved hacking the ftools plugin code

$ diff tmp/ftool.mod
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/fTools/tools/doGeoprocessing.py
297,298d296
<     # ABP:
<     fields = { 0 : fields[0] }

a couple of thoughts:

1 - fTools (or QgsVectorFileWriter<http://doc.qgis.org/stable/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#2353ce27918c2f711dba97f1d6b96a23>?)
should better handle errors when shapefile conversion - save fails
2 - an option to save buffer and other results to temporary in-memory layer
should be provided
3 - is it really necessary to copy all source vector fields in the result
file ? Not in the buffer function, maybe in the other tools ?
4 - the docs say QgsFileWriter will support other output formats, is there a
roadmap for this feature ? This could eventually solve many conversion
errors due to shapefile (DBF) limitations
5 - it's not clear to me how to catch QgsFileWriter errors from python code
while delegating real writing to the destructor (see: "del writer" in the
plugin's code), this could solve point 1 in this list

it's not a patch: it's just an ugly hack....

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3148

The solution is a correct error handling in the destructor call to the
writer or (better) automatic fieldname conflict resolution.

See also the recent issue, which came out on a different plugin:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3137
Basically, the solution resides in using gdal 1.7, plus changing
qgsvectorfilewriter.cpp accordingly.
All the best.

I would add:
- having a cooperative platform in which one or more maintainer would group plugins
under a reasonable number of submenus: now the situation is untenable, so difficult
to find a plugin even if you know more or less what it is supposed to do that it is
often easier to use the filter in the plugin installer.

Hi Tim!
I've used ubuntu with ubuntugis' repository.
postgis version 1.5, gdal version 1.7 (this is a requirement) and I had to
install wkt raster from source.
I'm going to write a post in my blog with my friend.
And as he's going to contribute we're changing the location to
mapeandoobrasil.blogspot.com
As usual it's going to be in portuguese, but I'm thinking about translating.

The main steps were: install qgis, mapserver, gdal-bin 1.7, postgresql 8.4,
libpqxx, gdal-dev, and postgis 1.5 from ubuntu gis. (yes, mapserver also
works with wktraster)
download the source for postgis 1.5.2 from postgis' site and download
wktraster extension's source.
Compile wktraster following the readme (you have to tell where the postgis
source is as there is no postgis-dev package).
Now this is a trick part: the raster must be reformatted. I've read
somewhere a guy teaching how to reformat (tiling, byte sequence, etc) it to
be able to import to wktraster.
I only tested with the raster available at the wktraster's page. My friend
is writing the "how to format the raster" part of our blog post.
Then you load the sql of wktraster to the database and translate to sql the
raster using gdal2wktraster.py from wktraster build.
Now it's available through the plugin.

I think this is a good abstract of how it's done. More details can be found
in blog posts around the net.
I'm going to implement the table listing in the plugin these weekend for now
you have to know the table name and type it down.
Good luck on your tests!

Ps.: We're also trying to compare performance of wktraster with terralib's
raster implementation as it's the only postgresql georaster library I've
heard of. But as preliminary results the performance of wktraster looks like
an issue at the momento.

Hi Martin

Thanks for looking at the patch. Your point about the search string makes 
sense. I decided to use the search string because of code reusage and the idea 
of introducing some comparison operators for raster algebra in the future 
(e.g. raster@1 > 10 would return a raster with 1 for values over 10 and 0 for 
values below). But now, looking at the searchtreenode, I realise that it 
wouldn't be possible to use checkAgainst() for that since it returns a bool. 
So yes, semantics is different.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] save project via python results in segfault
Message-ID: <4CC4831F.5000703@duif.net>

Hi devs,

trying to fix a mapserverexportplugin segfault (#2870)
It appears to happen when we try to save a non-saved qgis project to
qgs-file via python.
It's easy to test; try the following in the python console:

p=QgsProject.instance()
p.setFileName(str("/home/richard/temp/bpprr.qgs"))
p.write()

I've been looking at it by putting debug messages in cpp code, and to me
it seems the crash appears when in
qgspythonutilsimpl.cpp: 153: the method runString is called with the
parameter "sys.path.append('/home/richard/temp')"

Does this ring a bell with someone?
Should I be able to save a just started qgis project via python? Or
should I call some other methods first?

TIA,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ding dong on the bell ringing front:

http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/autosave-bugs-td5393598.html

my autosave plugin has been crashing qgis since version 1.5 because it
uses essentially the same python code. I was pretty busy at the time
so I just disabled it and carried on. Haven't got back to it, but can
confirm the behaviour you are seeing.

 Not sure why running sys.path.append should crash it, you can easily
do import sys;sys.path.append("/tmp") in the console without crashing
it, so the problem is elsewhere. I have a feeling its related to
string handling - unicode, QStrings, or something.

 Having an autosave function that was supposed to protect you from
crashes causing crashes was a very tragic circumstance! I'd like to
fix it!

 I notice that the file is being created with zero-length on my
system, so the program must be getting into QgsProject:write and
crashing there. There's a method for write() with a QFileInfo arg as
well as the method with no args. Not sure if this is a problem, but I
thought that kind of thing is handled by the SIP wrappers.

 I tried creating a QFileInfo object in python and calling :write but
it still crashed, something like:

 f = QFileInfo("/tmp/foo.qgs")
 p = QgsProject.instance()
 p.write(f)
*crash*

I need to set up a Qgis build environment to get any further with this...

I chatted with Marco (he was away on holiday for last week) and we

I think this kind of crash happens probably always when Python calls
C++ and C++ again calls some Python code. I am not sure what exactly
happens and whether this is caused by PyQt/sip or python itself...

I think this would be a nice feature for pyplugins developers.

In this moment the only workaround to make a layer uneditable is creating a
plugin window containing a new canvas, then adding the layer in this new
canvas,
but you can neither use useful tools (e.g all the newest selection tools) or
qgis
mainwindow capabilities (add layers, move layers, ...).

I'm going to open a ticket on trac.

Cheers.

ok, then would it be a workaround to add a python qgis-api method for
this? Or will we have the same problem then? ( the
QgsProject::write()-method emits a 'writeProject'-event which will be
received by the python part again. isn't it? ).

Otherwise, should we conclude that it is not possible to save a project
via python then (and in case of mapserver plugin I would let user NOT
use plugin without a saved project in the beginning anyway...)?

Thanks Bernhard.
In the meantime I also tried rebuilding a clean db with a partent table 
with 10 child, and I also found no problem. So it must be something 
specific of that particular db (a pretty complicated one).
So the good news is that QGIS works well even with advanced PostgreSQL 
features.
All the best.

I have looked into this and I think I have fixed that issue
successfully in r14434. It seems the problem was in not acquiring the
python global interpreter lock and thus accessing python API while in
an inconsistent state.

Richard, Barry, please test whether it helps your plugins.

Are you using python console within QGIS or do you open the python
interpreter from a terminal? In the latter case, you would have to
initialize qgis core library first by calling
QgsApplication.initQgis() otherwise it will not find the data
providers necessary for opening vector layers.

Thanks. So we go back to the question:
- svn or git?
- on osgeo or elsewhere?
- trac, redmine, or other?
I think it would be good to act now, so in Wroklaw we'll have all the 
pieces in place, and we can start hacking around it.
All the best.

Hi,

I am not a PSC member nor a very dedicated QGIS dev yet, but here are my 2c on 
this topic, which would be a kiss approach.
The main target for this repo is qgis and qgis plugin devs.
I'd first say : if you want your tool to be used, use what the majority of them 
already know. And I think that's SVN and Trac. Learning a new tool just for 
this case looks like a strong disincentive to me, even if the new tools are 
ten times better.
As for hosting, I'd tend to not multiply hosting, and keep administration 
tasks to the lowest possible level. That would probably mean OSGeo hosting I 
think ? Same here, having same tools than other osgeo projects helps lowering 
administration burden.
That's just my humble opinion, sorry if it does not help a lot.

Vincent

@Martin,
I am glad you replied. I was actually using python interpreter from
terminal. And, now I understand why I couldn't get it to work. It works fine
now.

It would be great if someone could make the error message more helpful.
"Failed to load" wasn't very helpful ;)

Thanks once again.

Hi Paolo,

I understand that you want to go on. But I think that the decision for a 
plugin development infrastructure should happen in Wroclaw, with many devs 
involved. We can show there the different approaches and help the attending 
people setting up new software (like git), if needed. A discussion about pros 
and cons of such a decision takes quite some time, especially when discussed 
by mail. Time, which many devs do not have during their daily work. The result 
of a hasty decision is usually: "let's stay with the old tools we already 
know".

I'd love to see more software moving to distributed version control
system too. It's much easier to deal with yet-to-be-committed patches,
effectively improving contributions (by longer staging capabilities
for logical development branches).

So, for what it is worth, I'd go osgeo, git and trac

I'm testing redmine and it's very cool, I vote for osgeo, and it's the
same for svn and git

You are right. I would have liked to use the time during the hackfest 
for starting doing the real work on the new infrastructure, but if we do 
not reach a consensus it's better wait.
Thanks.

I completely agree that making decisions for the infrastructure
shouldn't be too hasty... Wroclaw hackfest looks like a good place to
try to resolve the current situation - also regarding the management
of installed plugins, plugin UI guidelines etc.

 Yup, autosave is now working just fine. Also a simple test of saving

Hi all.
Just testing qgis with TinyOWS: quite a nice combination.
The only problem I found: I can add geometries, but not edit exixting ones:

Impossibile applicare le modifiche al layer tows:wfs_t

Errori: SUCCESSO: 1 geometrie aggiunte.
   ERRORE: 1 geometrie non cambiate.

The user has all permissions on that table.
On another machine it works.
Any hint?
All the best.

the machine were it works it is a 10.10 Ubuntu installation, QGIS from

It may be TinyOWS's fault.
Did you try with latest TinyOWS trunk ? A lot of bugs have been fixed since 0.9 
release.

You should also look at TinyOWS logs so that you can figure out if it's a 
problem with TinyOWS or with QGIS WFST support.

Then it is the same tinyows version (0.9).

coming back to the PostGIS plugins, I think Wroclaw would be also good place
to
merge some of them (e.g. improving PostGis Manager by adding the RT Sql
Layer
capabilities).

To think big, we can refactor the pg_manager creating a new manager which
manages both postgis and spatialite. In this manner we wouldn't have a lot
of
duplicated code for the spatialite_manager and we can easily extend it to
manage
others spatial dbs.

I think the first step is using the QtSql module instead of the psycopg2 one
within
pg_manager. I don't know if there are some limitations in this moment, but I
see
it's on the pg_manager's TODO list.

What's your opinion?
Cheers.

Ok, then maybe giving current svn trunk a chance would solve your problem.

You have to set the location in TinyOWS config file : ?log? attribute of TinyOWS

Hello,

I'm preparing a workshop on QGIS Python Bindings, and I would like to update
the page marked as obsolete:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Python_Bindings

but I couldn't find a way to register :(

I already have an OSGEO ID if that matters.

Hi Alessandro,

I create an account "AlessandroPasotti" for you and you can change the

Well, you can take most dependencies from OSGeo4W[1].  And take
mswindows/osgeo4w/package.cmd as a starting point how to configure a VC
solution with cmake.  See also [2]

choosing trunk you have the latest APIs (for QGis 1.6).
If you want to develop plugins for QGis 1.5, simply avoid to use all the
functions
tagged as "new in 1.6".

You can also find the latest APIs here [1].

Cheers.

Thanks, this is what I suspected.

I think it is useful to have both stable and head API available, I would
suggest to rename to stable/head to avoid version numbering mistakes.

Hi all.

SELECT round(ST_Perimeter(the_geom)::numeric,2)
FROM provincias
WHERE provincia = 'PI';

returns

368803

instead of

368803.16

So values seem always rounded to 0.

All the best.

I was not even aware of this version of the api docs---as far as I knew 
doc.qgis.org was the source. If there are duplicate versions of 
documentation and resources being stood up there needs to be some 
communication and coordination.

doc.qgis.org contains both stable (1.0) and unstable APIs.
qgis.org/api/ contains only the unstable APIs (I remember it was added when
doc.qgis.org server was unavailable).

I think that some devs are confused about the APIs versions.
Why doesn't the unstable APIs' version match the QGis version in
doc.qgis.org?
There's a reason?

Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Time to retire OS X Xcode project
Message-ID: <FCAD7F54-5D03-43EF-9F6E-24C12A9A88EB@kyngchaos.com>

It's been a bit (lot?) of work maintaining sync with the cmake build.  Other problems with it (both new and from day 1):

- non-user-friendly configuration (hand-edit a file!), though I had an idea to patch in configuration from cmake

- no automatic optional target compilation - if you didn't want or didn't have the support for an optional plugin or feature, you had to build individual targets

- the dependency tracking of Xcode never worked right for custom compile rules (moc, rcc,...) so recompiling a partially-compiled source or after changes to sources always recompiled those with custom rules, even if they didn't change

- the builtin yacc/lex rules don't work right, and custom rules are cranky, which leads to the final straw today when trying to add a new yacc/lex pair for the raster calculator change - failure


Not to fear!  I've taken the plunge into cmake and have been working on a cmake overhaul for the OS X build.  I was going to wait for after the sudden 1.6 release, but since I'm not having luck with yacc/lex in Xcode I should have at least the core changes done for 1.6 (up to bundling Qt frameworks is done now, but not in SVN yet).

Part of the cmake overhaul is to make sure library linking is all fixed up (it's been a problem in the past).  Another improvement is cleaner (and automatic) detection of my frameworks (needed for bundling to work).  The main improvement is making the bundling steps part of the install.

There may be a small delay for my binary packages for the 1.6 release while I finish the bundling scripts (or I figure out a hack in Xcode for the yacc/lex problem).


Things I will miss from Xcode:

- debugging in the Xcode GUI, though I haven't needed to set that up so far

- nothing else really, Xcode/Cmake doesn't matter to me as long as it compiles QGIS and bundles everything needed for release

I remember that and the problem was due to a one time build failure. I fixed the doc generation almost immediately.

Ok, I was referring to that whole thread.  Tim asked if we could host that in
the vm and integrated it into the nightly builds.

Nice to hear :-)

Another issue: I still can't install the plugin, getting the error (as already sent to the user-list on oct 21):

"The plugin depends on some components missing on your system. You need to install the following Python module in order to enable it: fgdc"

(Snow Leopard, QGIS 1.5, Framework install)

Any idea about that?

Is this better now with J?rgens fixes to the cmake flex/bison scrips in r14445?

The problem is in Xcode, which has nothing to do with cmake.

Sure. In the very first stage they could merged into one plugin with
just small changes (e.g. each plugin in one subdirectory, with some
glue). The next stages would incrementally remove duplicate code.

I don't think switching to QtSql has a priority. It's on the todo list
because someone suggested it once, but I never investigated pros and
cons of the transition. Currently I don't see any reason for rewriting
that code.

Very well. So this will be one of our priorities for the hackfest.
BTW, what other PostGIS plugin writes think about this? Any chance of having as much
unification, or at least standardization, and removal of duplicated functions, as
possible?
I mean e.g.:
PgQuery for QGIS
PostGIS SQL Query editor
it is very difficult for an user understand and decide which one to use, and the
respective differences and advantages.
All the best.

 Hi Tim,

Many thanks for fixing the problems [14381, 14387 & 14425]!

But there is now another one popping up:

When the data values in an one-band raster are real numbers and are
negative/positive or are greater than 255 (?) the histogram curve does
not display. The x- and y-axis correctly show the range of values but no
curve is displayed. Furthermore, if data values are positive and
negative, the histogram curve stops at 0: no curve over the negative values.


It also looks like the number of bins is too small when the data range
is small. I've got a raster with "real number" values between 0 and 5.
The number of bins on that raster is only 6. This is far too coarse to
be of any use.

Do I open a ticket for those problems?

Cheers,
Benoit

Hi,

In Spatialite layers, if I digitize a polygon counter-clockwise, the ftools' 
geometry validity check says:

Feature $n has incorrect node ordering

Is it intentional, or a bug? It doesn't affect shapefiles.

Hi Boris,

in OGC-SFS specs there is absolutely no 
indication at all concerning the RING's 
node ordering (clockwise / counterclockwise).

and this makes full sense, because for OGC
POLYGONs the first RING always is the EXTERIOR
ring, and any other subsequent RING (if present) 
has to be interpreted as an INTERIOR ring.

this rule is absolutely clear and unambiguous:
so there is no need at all to enforce a preferred
node-ordering.

AFAIK the nowadays obsolescent SHP format used
a completely different rule: 
- the exterior ring has to be clockwise
- any interior ring has to be counterclockwise
- rings relative ordering is not relevant

So I suppose that ftools (incorrectly) checks any
polygon geometry for validity following the 
superseded SHP-like rules.

But from the SpatiaLite's own perspective this
makes no sense at all, because node ordering
is absolutely irrelevant in this case.

bye Sandro

Hi all,

I would actually much prefer it if people didn't use the check geometry tool
at all :-p It was never really meant to be a long-term tool (I really just
created it at the time to be a quick and dirty way to find issues with
shapefiles), and I know that Martin and his team have created a much better
geometry checker (in C++) that is kicking around somewhere that would be
much better suited to most users needs. In actual fact, there is no attempt
to follow OGC standards in the ftools geometry validity tool!

@ Martin: What is the status of your geometry checking tool? Is there anyway
that this might be incorporated into trunk somehow? I think it would be much
better to have something a bit more compliant, stable, and with a few more
of the features that have been mentioned in this thread (some of which I
think Martin's tool already has).

Regards,

Carson

Oh, I see! So no matter how I digitize the shapefile, it's always saved with 
the right direction so no error occures. Good to know that I can't force it's 
direction.

It's absolutely necessary functionality, so I'm looking forward to see the 
Martin's tool!

Hm, then we have three.  I made QgsGeometry::validateGeometry(), when I needed
to fix a bunch of polygons and found that the node tool refused to edit broken
geometry at all.

Hmm, ok, didn't notice this change. I'll have a look, and see if I can
update the geometry validity tool to use this functionality. Thanks for the
info J?rgen! Shouldn't be too hard to use this function, plus add some of
the suggested features to make the tool a bit more useful.

Oh, sorry.  I missed an "I" above.  Tim justs asked.  It was me who integrated
the into the nightly builds.   So if anyone, I'm to blame.

These may be more opinion than actual issues, just wanted to see what
others thought.

1. When adding a vector layer, you hit browse the default tends to be
shapefile, but when you add a raster the default is "All GDAL formats".
I think All OGR formats would be a much better default, having to scroll
all the time for gml, kml etc is really annoying especially when I'm
working hard to break people of the assumption that vector = shapefile.

2. As pointed out by a colleague: Many people new to GIS have no idea
the KML = Keyhole Markup Language, so it's not clear on the Save as..
option that is actually KML. The same might be said for GML. Either
changing the names in the list or putting (Hint) would seem useful to users.

3. In 1.6 builds (Could be my build from last week) the Select tool does
not appear to work the same way(Ctrl fails to add or remove from the
selection), and th icon has a new drop down indicator that doesn't seem
to work. 2ndary note, I'm all for making clearer icons for tools but it
seems excessive to change what they look like every version especially
if we're not actually testing new v. old on human test subjects to verify.

Thanks,
Alex

Agreed. I think the last choice should be remembered.

Agreed: I have found users thinking there is no KML support because of that.

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Installer last-minute update
Message-ID: <201011010206.54114.borysiasty@gmail.com>

Hi All, 

The installer 1.1 brings some often requested features:

- No need to restart Qgis (1.5 and above) after plugin reinstall (only if the 
plugin is currently loaded; otherwise you still have to do it)

- More robust information if an obsolete plugin masks its newer version. If 
it's the installer itself, it's being automagically removed and you're only 
asked for qgis restart.

- Removed Bob's repository, added Stefan's one

- Dropped compatibility with Qgis < 1.0

Goodnight,
B.
