Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ubuntugis QGIS Download Stats
Message-ID: <4D1F87BC.70008@wildintellect.com>

I've gotten word that the download stats for ubuntugis via the api
should be up to date now.

Running my script, I'm seeing ~350 downloads of 1.6.0 across all
versions of ubuntu that are posted (jaunty 8.10 to maverick 10.10)

I'll need to explore a little more to see if historical versions are
accessible too.

Attached is the dump from my script for today.

To get a copy of the python script visit:

Thanks,
Alex

I agree the numbers seem kinda low. Keep in mind these are just the
ubuntugis-unstable repo. I'll modify and re-run for stable and testing.
Also note this doesn't include Debian, Fedora or the regular ubuntu
repos or all those crazies who like to compile from source (we should
look in the apache logs on qgis.org to see how many checkouts there are
to unique IP). Once you combine all those we might be in the 1000s range.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all,

I notice the psycopg used from osgeo4w package is very old (the actul stable
version is the 2.3.2)

there is some problem that deny its update ?

The last version has more capability in the connection and threading.

Message-ID: <4D20B555.1010803@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Saga has nice analytical tools. Anyone interested in writing a plugin calling
saga_cmd? It shouldn't be much work, and it would greatly increase our analytical
capabilities.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

as far as I know there is nobody working on a QGIS interface to SAGA.
Some time ago, Giovanni Allegri showed interest in such an interface and
was willing to try to implement it. But I haven't heard from him for
about a year.

He wanted to implement the interface in Python, and back then, we had
some trouble with the Python interface of SAGA using Linux Unicode
builds. These issues are solved in the meantime.
I'm not very familiar with QGIS, but I would expect a C++ interface to
be more efficient.

In the meantime, I have also implemented an GDAL driver for SAGA binary
grids, I think it is available since GDAL 1.7.2. This should allow
reading and writing SAGA grids from QGIS via the GDAL plugin.

I don't expect that anyone of the SAGA core developers will initiate
such a project by himself, but in case you like to start with such an
interface, I'm willing to help. From the user side of view, I think
there is interest in such an interface - at least there are some users
on the forum that use SAGA for processing and QGIS for map layout.

Best regards,
Volker

here following the Doodle with the proposed dates for the spring 2011
Hackfest, Lisbon Portugal.

http://doodle.com/iepfutwss8m6e5nm

(14)-15-16-17-(18) April 

or

(28)-29-30-01-(02) April/May

Obviously, as in the past, the first day (14th or 28th of April) is for
arrivals and to eventually allow the devs to start working from the
afternoon, and the last day (18th of April or 02 of May) is for
departures.

The first proposal seems to have the advantage to be just before the
Easter holidays, so someone may want to use the HF as a good reason to
stay around for a few more days.

I started also a wiki page

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011

with a few basic information as the detailed ones (venue,hotels,etc.)
will be added in the next days/after we decided the HF dates.


cheers!

Yes, the logic should be very similar to our GdalTools (now RasterTools)

I am wondering which APIdocumentation is applicable for Python functions for Version 1.6 Copiapo release. 

For example, I was using QGSGeometry and according to the documentation it takes a point and returns a double and another argument that receives a vertex (closest) on the line segment geometry.

Similar discrepancy exists for closestsegmentWithContext.? exists. The documentations says it like this, 
double QgsGeometry::closestegmentWithContext(qgsPoint,
           minDistPoint,beforeVertex)

but in the 1.6 version I am using, it give an array of results and it must be retrieved as part of an array.

Where would be the API docs that corresponds to a particular version of the software. I am assuming that the Python functions parallel those of C++. Until I could run with all the C++ crowd, (I am seriously contemplating to do just that, except I do not know how?) can you help me walk along the pathway of QGIS? If I could compile QGIS in QT I would jump to it immediately. I also wanted to just compile a dll in QGIS instead of compiling a complete3 application, I do not want to create a separate GUI, but just a dll that would be called like a Python

Thank you for your help,

Maaza ?

Hi Maaza.

Here is the C++ API.

http://doc.qgis.org/head/index.html

I think there is no documentation of the Python API to corresponding
to C++, however, Qgis have pyqgis cookbook and other useful tools.

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/

http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py

You can look at the plugins in the repository, visit the sites and
download the plugins and see how they are implemented in python.

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Python_Plugin_Repositories

You also install the plugins and browse the plugin directory to see
the python codes.

Compiling QGIS, visit this site (below).

Thank you Noli!? 

I do use all the other documentations available and I sometimes have to bang my head on the virtual wall and I sometimes worry if my head will crack or I go nuts before I get the answer. But I am quite happy with what I have been given already, I am provided much by many who labored before me. If only I could learn how to make C++ plugins then, may be then, all the mysteries will be over, and I could join the ones that contribute to the welbeing of the user base. 

I was under the impression that the C++ API methods return the same data as the Python methods. Is that true or am I thinking the unthinkable?

Thank you again for a swift response!

May you have a blessed new year,

Maaza

Hi Maaza.

Here is the C++ API.

http://doc.qgis.org/head/index.html

I think there is no documentation of the Python API to corresponding
to C++, however, Qgis have pyqgis cookbook and other useful tools.

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/

http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py

You can look at the plugins in the repository, visit the sites and
download the plugins and see how they are implemented in python.

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Python_Plugin_Repositories

You also install the plugins and browse the plugin directory to see
the python codes.

Compiling QGIS, visit this site (below).

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Installation_Guide

Hi Maaza,

I think so.

Do you prefer to write C++ plugin?

I think you have to checkout the qgis source using git and look at the
c++ plugins.

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_Git

e.g. in linux

git clone git://github.com/sourcepole/qgis.git


Then have a look in,

qgis > qgis > src > plugins directory.

Maaza.

As far as i can see looking at the code the python bindings are not full up
to date.  I did clone the git repo lastnight and branched so i could work on
bringing them up to date but as i am also new to python and c++, progress is
a bit slow :-) i'm sure once i get the hang of it i should be able to push
the chabges up.

Hi.

I'm author measure_ellipsoid.diff ( http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3240 ) . 

In file src/app/qgsmeasuredialog.cpp, line 139
mTool->canvas()->mapRenderer()->distanceArea()->ellipsoid() return always WGS84.
It not depend on project coordinate systems or "measure\ellpsiod" settings.

I know not good code QGIS. This is a bug or a feature?

Hi all,

I thought this would be a relatively easy thing to do but I seem to be
failing somewhere.

I'm having some trouble creating a new sip file to expose the GPS stuff to
python.  I have made a sip file to wrap the GPS detector and added it the
core.sip via %Include qgsgpsdetector.sip but I get a error when running
Make. My qgsgpsdetector.sip and the make error can be found here
http://osgeo.codepad.org/kS63mqND

Anyone know what I might be doing wrong?

If maprenderer does not take the ellipsoid from settings, it's probably a bug.

Hi all.
I think I have spotted a bug: in new symbology, if I select categorized
symbols for points, I can also choose, under Advanced, a rotation and a
dimension field, and that works fine.
If I change the symbol, rotation and size have no longer an effect,
unless I change also the color ramp.
Can anyone confirm that this is in fact a bug?

Message-ID: <4D21F8CF.9060503@arava.co.il>

Has this:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/639

(ancient) bug somehow come to life?


When I create a new point shapefile in version 1.6, on WinXP, 
each new point is located exactly on top of the previous 
regardless of where I click in the map composer.  I can use 
the "Move feature" tool to move the points around, and view 
their attribs in the table, so they are indeed created, but 
not in the clicked location. If I save edits and restart 
editing, all additional points are on top of the last entered 
point, again ignoring where I click.


This behavior appears only in 1.6 (in 1.7 it seems to be OK), 
and only on shapefiles (not spatialite) and only on Windows. 
Since 1.6 is the current stable (I guess...) perhaps the fix 
should be "backported".

Regards,

Micha

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL Version inside qgis python API
Message-ID: <AANLkTimf74ObsK5u3LfHsvPjU9YDrZbJCfjd5o9FKQZ4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm still with the problem of how to get a gdal version from a python API
inside QGIS.
Now i've looked at gdal_tools code and it calls the module gdal and checks
it's version. Seems odd to know that the module and qgis doesn't use the
same versions on a OSGeo4W installation.
On my laptop qgis reports (on the about screen) gdal 1.5.3 and python-gdal
reports 1.7.3.
That sounds ok as I've really installed gdal 1.7 by hand, but I'm still on
the same problem.
Is there any way to get to know what kind of files does qgis open as raster?
On gdal it would be getDriverByName() and check if it's ok but how can I
access this throught the qgis API to use the exactly same version as the
DataProvider is using?
Thanks for any tips.

I don't see the ui files in the project either. I'm not sure what is
the problem - maybe Creator can't handle the list of .ui files created
by glob command...
Anyway in the left panel you can switch from projects view to file
system view. That's how I typically access ui files within qgis.

Look to src/app/attributetable directory In the qgis source tree.
Btw. QGIS handles gml files the same way as any other data source
loaded with OGR library.

The output in the about screen is wrong.  QGIS uses 1.7 on OSGeo4W.

But if you install both gdal and gdal17 the about box will pickup the gdal
include from the 1.5 directory - just a cosmetic issue.

You mean which DLLs it's linked against?  Checkout dependencywalker[1].

Nice!
Now I can see that there is a report on the same about with the real gdal
number.
Great! I've tested again and now wktraster plugin works on windows!
I'm going to do some tests with non-standard files now.

There are small differences between C++ and Python API because of the
differences between the languages. C++ can return only one value -
when more values should be returned, it's possible to use pointers or
references to variables that will receive the output. This is also the
case of closestSegmentWithContext function. It takes a point as an
input argument, the two other variables are used only for output. In
Python one would return a tuple with several values. When wrapping C++
methods to Python, we mark which arguments are output parameters -
these are then not accepted as parameters, instead they are returned
in a tuple. An example:

>>> g = QgsGeometry.fromPolyline( [ QgsPoint(1,1), QgsPoint(2,2) ] )
>>> g.closestSegmentWithContext( QgsPoint(2,1) )
(0.5, (1.5,1.5), 1)

Here you can see that the return value (distance) is the first element
in the tuple, the other two output parameters follow.

Until I could run with all the C++ crowd, (I am seriously contemplating to do just that, except I do not know how?) can you help me walk along the pathway of QGIS? If I could compile QGIS in QT I would jump to it immediately. I also wanted to just compile a dll in QGIS instead of compiling a complete3 application, I do not want to create a separate GUI, but just a dll that would be called like a Python

There is currently no reference guide that lists the differences
between C++ and Python API - but there are not many of them. A rule of
thumb is to consult C++ documentation (http://doc.qgis.org/) - if
there is a difference, you will get an error message that you have
passed wrong arguments. If you are not able to solve the problem by
yourself, do not hesitate to write to qgis-dev list.

well, usually it's simple, though many times sip doesn't report errors

Hmm, looks like you've made a syntax error in the python/core/core.sip
file... I would have to see that one.

Generally the easiest way how to get more classes wrapped is to tell me :-)
Before wrapping the class I usually try to go through API of the class
and improve it slightly if the class is not very python friendly.

Hi Sergey

I would recommend not to use the distanceArea() instance from
QgsMapRenderer at all. It was supposed to be a convenient instance,
however it's better to construct your own QgsDistanceArea instance
when doing anything with measuring. The main problem with that
instance is that other code (e.g. plugin) could modify your parameters
and the measuring will be wrong. Anyway that instance currently reacts
only when on-the-fly projections are turned on/off and when project
CRS got changed.

In QGIS source code, you can look into src/app/legend directory.

In qgis forum reccomend me to ask you:
I wonder if in the form attributes of a layer (PostgreSQL / PostGIS) ->

Hi,

I notice the osgeo4w installer (I'm on windows 7) has some items 
repeated in the lib section of advanced install.

I notice two times
gdal17
gdal17-ecw
gdal17-mrsid

as items #8 and so on

and the same repeated as items #82 of the same section.

Apparently all seem work,
but I don't think this is a good think.

I don't know if and where report this situation.

perhaps to the osgeo4w site ?

Thx,

Thanks Gary,

This maybe be a noobish question but I thought I would ask first before
doing anything.

Say I'm working on a new feature/bug/whatever and I have made a branch in my
git repo to work on it and have pushed the branch to git hub.  Wouldn't it
be better to make a pull request from the branch rather then merging into my
master line and making the pull request from there?

My reasons for this are: if I work on a new feature and merge it into my
master line then make a pull request to qgis/qgis and my new feature, for
whatever reason, doesn't make it into the main qgis repo, my master branch
will always have my changes regardless of if the qgis team decide that are
not needed. Every time I do a pull request for something else in the future
those changes will be still there and wanting to get pulled across.

My thoughts were to keep the master branch clean, with only the changes from
the main repo qgis/qgis using git fetch upstream; git merge upstream/master
[keeping the branches up to date using the same method] and then branch and
ask for pull request from the branchs into the qgis/qgis project.  That way
if the feature is broken/not needed I can just kill the branch and start
over from master.

Hopefully that made sense.  What are your thoughts?

 Hi Nathan,

 Thanks for sharing the link. I would like to watch the video but don't 
 have the Flash player installed on my workplace computer (our employer 
 doesn't install plugins - for security and privacy reasons).

 We have modern webbrowsers though, that can display video, (Firefox 4, 
 Opera 11, Chrome 8, etc.) Youtube offers a HTML5 mode 
 (http://www.youtube.com/html5), but your homepage doesn't seem to expose 
 it correctly - it only offers the flash version. Here is the direct link 
 for a HTML5 compatible browser: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NILKRiMtcU

 I guess I am not the only one in the world without a Flash player ...

 Thanks again,
 Andreas

Quite interesting, thanks a lot. Why not adding it to qgis web site?

Further tests: the old db works. I upgraded PostGIS from svn and created
new DBs; I get the above error only for new DBs.
So I may have misconfigured something, or it might be some problem with
updated PostGIS functions.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,

Yeah the flash thing is a bit of a problem [working with linux I really now
understand why people hate flash], I had a look and it doesn't look like
Wordpress.com supports the tag needed to embed a HTML5 youtube video.  I
plan to get my own wordpress hosting at some stage this year that way I can
have full control.  I will post a direct link on the post so that people go
to youtube to watch it if needed.

Hi Paolo

To initialize pgversion in a database you have to run the
createFunctions.sql script. This script will install all nesseccary
views, schemas and functions. Have a look at:

http://www.kappasys.ch/cms/index.php?id=23&MP=23-11#toc5

The updateFunctions.sql script only updates an existing pgversion
installation. There is no need to create a schema versions due to it
exeists already.

That was a wonderful video, Nathan. Thanks for all the work! 

It is amazing what can be done when "Brothers and Sisters are together in accord." (Psalm 131)

Happy New Year again, and may it be a successful, productive coding year,

Nice video!

Read a bit of your blogs as well.

Nice decision to switch to QGIS development.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unknown CRS problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTinSnirPYc-U_T9GK8ySRtH2CdAscRQ67k5cAytg@mail.gmail.com>

When a layer is loaded and QGIS can't determine its CRS it would be
preferred if the CRS of that layer was shown as 'unknown', rather than
shown as being the default CRS. I know that this causes problems for
some newcomers to QGIS.

I gather that this question was raised during the Hackfest in Vienna
and I wonder whether or not it is being followed-up?

Regards,
Nick.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikphkwN_k=71gjjKo0ZoJB19tJw-=PXZEnwvZSp@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
I've updated the wktraster plugin to solve a few issues and to implement the
data loading gui.
Now the plugin have an interface to load data to the database.
I know jorge is going to ask for a few more options on the ui but I thought
that it should be as clean as possible at first. Loading data is still a
non-trivial task so I forced a single use case.
I couldn't test the gdal version tester as I found my windows gdal version
is now 1.7.
At least I could test the data loading and visualization of the utm.tif file
on windows 7 (thanks OSGEO4W).
I hope you enjoy.
Best regards,

Hi Mauricio,

Thanks for this plugin,

Suggestions

1. I think it would be good to put this plugin into "Database" Menu.
So we can easily find it with the rest of the database plugins. This
also prevent the over crowding of the "Plugins" menu.

2. Then probably "PostGIS Raster" instead of "Add Postgis a raster
layer" since you already the same sub menu (i.e. "Add Postgis a raster
layer")

3. Kindly place a changelog file so we know what is new in this plugin.

Thanks.

Noli

Dear developers,

Please find below a detailed Request for a Proposal and Quotation for an 
AILUM (Agriculture Inventory and Land Use Mapping) plug-in for QGIS.
The tender is being announced by GTZ (German Technical Cooperation).
Note that the deadline for submission is the 04-Feb-2011, and the award 
date is 15-Feb-2011.
Please feel free to contact Ricardo Aravena (ricardo.aravena@gtz.de 
<mailto:ricardo.aravena@gtz.de>) if you have any questions regards the 
technical specification and the tendering/bidding process.

*Organizational Overview *
The Deutsche Gesellschaft f?r Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Society 
for Technical Cooperation) or GTZ is a private international enterprise 
owned by the German Federal Government, specializing in technical 
cooperation for sustainable development with worldwide operation. It 
primarily works for public sector organizations and is headquartered in 
Eschborn, Germany. It mainly operates on behalf of the Federal Ministry 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Further clients are 
other departments of the government, international donors like the 
European Union, World Bank or the United Nations, partner countries and 
the private sector. GTZ works on a public-benefit basis. All surpluses 
generated are channeled back into its own international cooperation 
projects for sustainable development. The GTZ provides services in the 
following areas of sustainable development: Economic Development and 
Employment; Government, Democracy and Poverty Reduction; Education, 
Health and Social Security; Environment and Infrastructure & 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

*Required Deliverables*
A QGIS plugin for an automated process to manually classify land types 
from satellite imagery for land use mapping based on visual identification.

*Function*
To avoid high-level academic training of remote sensing classification 
techniques, an easy, yet robust method of classifying land types simply 
by clicking on them from visual identification as a non-expert would 
from a common application like GIMP is required. The idea is that 
non-experts would be able to conduct their own land use mapping. The 
areas from the resultant vector land use maps produced would be further 
applied to calculate indicators such as expected crop yield.

*Target Users *
The tool is principally intended for an agricultural inventory project 
to be conducted by provincial staff from the northern Laotian province 
of Luang Namtha, though it would also be useful for some Participatory 
Land Use Planning and other mapping activities across other provinces in 
Laos. Thus it needs to be as simple and automated as possible.
As it is intended to be an Open Source tool under GNU (general public 
use) license, it could also potentially be used by anyone with an 
internet connection and QGIS. It would serve well in the development 
context where funding, expert knowledge and training is limited.

*Technical Specification*
A Python plugin is to be coded for QGIS as either a new Menu tool set, 
Panel or Toolbar.
The plugin will have 3 parts:
1. Imagery preparation -- this will automate 4 steps:
(i) conversion of images to 8 bit Geotif (if necessary),
(ii) creation of a georeferencing tag file (.gtf),
(iii) Equalization,
(iv) then Blur.
The user will simply be asked where to store the new files for the image 
and then the steps will be run in sequence automatically.
2. Classification --
a) Visual classifications of distinct, contiguous recognizable land 
types are to be conducted on the standard QGIS map interface the same 
way it would be done in a program like GIMP with BOTH the 'Fuzzy Select 
Tool' and the 'Select by Color Tool'. The users will apply these tools 
on a trial-and-error basis with similar dynamic 'Threshold' slide bars 
as in GIMP's interface until they are satisfied with their selections.
b) A third tool would also be necessary to group or generalize the 
user's selections, the way 'Select>Border' would do in GIMP.
c) A dialog should appear on request every time the user is satisfied 
with their selection to render the land types with an appropriate colour 
and assign a textual label which will be included in a landuse field. 
The colours and texts should be editable and not limited in number. This 
label and colour information may somehow be embedded in the image or 
stored separately in a look up table if necessary so that it can be 
rendered accordingly in the resulting end-product vector shapefile.
3. Vectorization -- this will polygonize the classified image as 
contiguously as possible to a shapefile. And the landuse and a colour 
fields generated in the precious step will need to be either maintained 
or associated correspondingly to the shapefile.

It is proposed that:
- The conversion of the imagery to 8 bit Geotif and the creation of a 
tag file could be done with GDAL commands.
- The Equalization and Blur need to be produced with the same effect and 
quality as that produced by GIMP's Colors>Auto>Equalize and 
Filters>Blur>Gaussian Blur respectively; however since GIMP's libraries 
can only be run internally from within GIMP, it is proposed to implement 
the equivalent functionality from ImageMagick's libraries instead.
- The same goes for the 'Fuzzy Select Tool', 'Select by Color Tool' and 
'Select>Border' GIMP equivalents.
- The vectorization could be conducted by the GDAL polygonize function 
for example as long as its parameters can be set to produce contiguity 
to reduce individual pixelization.
- Step 2b), the most challenging, could be catered for in many ways and 
so will be left up to the solution provider's discretion. Use of the 
already translated Orfeo Toolbox libraries is encouraged.

This is the proposed construction and presentation for the plugin, 
however if applicants present a better workflow or methodology this will 
also certainly be considered and in fact favored.

*Assumptions & Agreements *
- The name of the plugin shall be "AILUM (Agriculture Inventory and Land 
Use Mapping)".
- The plugin needs to be a completely Open Source solution with no legal 
infringements.
- After being tested, the plugin and its code will be publicly available 
under GNU license as FLOSS.

*Technical Proposal *
The solution provider should include time-lines and schedules for 
completing the project.

*Time-Cost *
The solution provider must detail the time and costs that will be 
required to complete the project.

*Additional Documentation*
Developers can direct us to an internet site or repository which 
demonstrates their production capabilities.

*References *
References are optional, though preferable if the candidate is not a 
company with a published track record.

*Submission Deadline *
4, February, 2011.

*Submit Proposal To: *
Ricardo Aravena
Email: ricardo.aravena@gtz.de <mailto:ricardo.aravena@gtz.de>

*For additional information or clarification, contact: *
Ricardo Aravena
Email: ricardo.aravena@gtz.de <mailto:ricardo.aravena@gtz.de>

*Basis for Award of Contract *
Balance between the best functional solution and the lowest bid.

*Award Date *
15, February, 2011.

So your gdal version is prior 1.7.
If you're on windows all you have to do is upgrade osgeo's qgis.
If you're on linux, ubuntugis and debian gis both have 1.7 compiled
repositories.
To get everything right, on qgis there is a description of the providers:
Help->About->Providers. There you can see against witch gdal version your
qgis is working.
Maybe I should say the version on the error dialog.
Best regards,
Mauricio

I just updated my QGIS 1.7 trunk nightly r14993M

This is OGR data provider (compiled against GDAL/OGR library version
1.6.3, running against GDAL/OGR library version 1.6.3)

This is the lucid nightly build.

I always ask (see my previous posting) in the QGIS developer mailing
about the building QGIS with GDAL 1.7.x

http://www.mail-archive.com/qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org/msg00389.html

Hi,

I would be possible to build QGIS Trunk 1.7.0 nightly for Lucid Ubuntu
10.04 with GDAL 1.7.3.

I think GDAL 1.6.3 is a bit old for QGIS 1.7.0 trunk, granting that
GDAL 1.8.0 will be released soon.

http://www.mail-archive.com/gdal-dev@lists.osgeo.org/msg09419.html

Any reason why the QGIS Trunk 1.7.0 nightly build is still using GDAL 1.6.3?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <7C8882BAC3EF58428D91A35F2DEA0E8C21588698@rmsidexg.rmsi.com>

Hi,

Is there any reporting tool available for Qt application other than NCReport which supports PostGres database. I have tried NCreport but eventually have always stuck either with DLL hell or some unrecognized exits from the application.

Thanks & regards,
Sumit Kumar

This is probably better asked on the qt-interest mailing list.

I don't think that they do. Which ever option is selected there are
problems. If the user doesn't know the CRS for the layer or if QGIS
can't determine the CRS for the layer the result is confusion either
way. To be honest, this isn't a problem for me because I know just
enough about CRSs (and the need never to trust them without checking)
to get me through.

The trouble is that newcomers to QGIS get confused when things don't
work as they expect and it's very easy for them to mutter something
like "typical open-source" and walk away from it. They can't
understand why, when they right-click on a layer and go Properties ->
General, QGIS might tell them something that is downright wrong about
the layer CRS.

But I do understand that fixing the problem is probably easier said
than done, of course.

Regards, Nick.

I've took a look on the problem - a semicolon has been missing after
the class definition in qgsgpsdetector.sip. The compilation moves on
and complains about missing QgsGPSInformation class :-)

With PgVersion Rev 0.8.13 now it is possible to install pgvs in a DB
from the PgVersion Plugin. The option appears when you try to connect
a DB from the load layer dialog and pgvs is not installed in the
connected DB.

I hope that helps.

Hi All

I'm looking for help on how to find the Qgis version that is running from Python, in order to put version conditional code into a plugin.  

I think that generally it is a better idea to test specific capabilities, but in this case I can't find a way to do that either :-(

Thanks for any help
Chris

(I barely remember any discussion on this topic.)

I agree with you that CRS handling should be improved. Having
'unknown' CRS is more useful than assigning a bogus CRS and then
trying to project it to some other CRS. I think we should remove
on-the-fly projections option and _always_ do the reprojection of
layers (many times this will be just a no-op). Only layers with
unknown CRS wouldn't be projected. One problem here is that we haven't
implemented raster reprojection yet.

Hmm.... Some thoughts:
Won't OTF projection of raster always be a heavy computational process,  
slowing down rendering?
Second: To which CRS will this automatic OTF reproject to? The situation 
now is that a new project always starts in EPSG:4326. There's no way 
AFAIK to cause QGIS to always start in some user chosen CRS (other than 
creating a default project in your chosen CRS, then change the QGIS 
shortcut to always start that project.)
Suppose I have some big LandSAT rasters in UTM, and vector layers in 
some other projection. If OTF was always "on" I'd be reprojecting both 
the LandSAT and all the vectors into Lon/Lat WGS84.
THird: Having OTF automatic still won't help users with data that lacks 
a CRS.

First priority, in my mind, should be an option for users to set the 
default *project* projection. For example, in the Options->CRS window, a 
checkbox offering to use the chosen "Global" CRS (which currently 
applies only to layers with unknown CRS) as the default for new projects.

Thanks,
Micha

Hi All

I'm wanting to create a memory provider in Python without invoking the CRS selection dialog (even if the QGIS settings are set to "Prompt for CRS when a new layer is created".

At the moment my code looks like:

        settings = QSettings()
        prjSetting = settings.value("/Projections/defaultBehaviour") 
        settings.setValue("/Projections/defaultBehaviour", QVariant(""))
        layer = QgsVectorLayer("point",name,"memory")
        if prjSetting:
            settings.setValue("/Projections/defaultBehaviour",prjSetting)

This does work, but it seems a bit cumbersome (at first glance it doesn't even look like creating a vector layer!), so I'm wondering if there is a cleaner approach..

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris

In the 'Profile from lines' plugin I'm using a similar approach:

# python code
projectionSettingKey = "Projections/defaultBehaviour"
oldProjectionSetting = self.qgisSettings.value(projectionSettingKey)
self.qgisSettings.setValue(projectionSettingKey, "useGlobal")
self.qgisSettings.sync()
pointLayer = QgsVectorLayer("Point", "temporary_points", "memory")
pointLayer.setCrs(linesLayer.crs())
self.qgisSettings.setValue(projectionSettingKey, oldProjectionSetting)

This was discussed a while back at another thread in this mailing-list
(08/09/2010) and this was a suggestion from Martin Dobias. It seems at
the moment it is as clean as it gets (its still a bit unclean though
;))

I'd also be interested in knowing alternative ways to do this.

Hi,

I found this article while browsing, Selecting an Enterprise GIS Solution

Selecting an Enterprise GIS Solution - QGIS is selected.

DSE (Department of Sustainability and Environment in Victoria, Australia).

Read this article below and visit the website.

 Selecting an Enterprise GIS Solution
Wednesday, 08 December 2010 17:52

Client Profile: Anthony Draga - Project Manager, Spatial Information
Infrastructure (SII), Department of Sustainability & Environment

How do you choose the right GIS technology for your enterprise? The
Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) has been
a long time user of ESRI-based GIS, from the desktop to web mapping.
Like many large organisations, DSE has a large number of officers who
require desktop GIS tools, but seldom use advanced analytical
features. Many of these officers continue to use ArcView 3x although
it is outdated and not supported within DSE.

DSE contracted Spatial Vision to identify the range of cost-effective
alternatives available to fulfil their requirements, including Open
Source GIS. Spatial Vision undertook a market-wide review of desktop
GIS products to understand the range of options available to meet the
Department's functional needs, as well as the associated costs and
resources required to implement any new technology.

The Spatial Vision consultants commenced by working with DSE project
stakeholders to define a comprehensive set of 95 functional and 20
non-functional assessment criteria. This was followed by a desktop
investigation of alternative GIS products against a sub-set of the
evaluation criteria.

In total, 38 individual products were assessed, highlighting three
categories of GIS software: open source, commercial and freeware -
that is free software from commercial proprietors.

Nine products were shortlisted. Each of the shortlisted products were
downloaded, installed and evaluated against the full set of DSE
criteria. The outcome of the evaluation was the selection of two Open
Source GIS products, gvSIG and Quantum GIS, for presentation to DSE
project stakeholders. DSE and DPI officers were then provided with an
opportunity to conduct a hands-on assessment of the useability of the
two products. Overall, Quantum GIS was rated highest in functionality
and useability.

Compliance Assessment for the 9 Shortlisted Products.
The two Arc products failed to meet the requirement to create and edit
data hence the high non-compliance.



Implementing an alternative GIS product needs to consider more than
just application functionality. Consideration must also be given to
the impacts of the preferred software for data storage and
distribution, symbology standards, and approaches to ensure that
potential users are adequately engaged, trained and supported.



Open Source software may not involve purchase costs but implementation
is another matter. To assist DSE to determine the viability of the
favoured Open Source solution, implementation costs across a five-year
period were compared with those associated with a commercial package.
This investigation confirmed the potential for the Open Source
solution to deliver cost savings but only over the longer term.

DSE is now undertaking a larger trial of Quantum GIS to determine its
suitability. The use of Quantum GIS is not intended to replace DSE's
investment in ArcGIS for more sophisticated analysis, mapping and data
management activities, rather provide a complimentary alternative for
basic view, query and map production tasks.

Hi Tim,

When I installed my linux QGIS build environment it was on a machine with
SA12 already installed, so when I encountered these build errors I thought
it was a problem with the GDAL configuration and didn't recognize it was a
library conflict.  My solution at the time was to append the full path to
libodbcinst (/usr/lib/libodbcinst.so) to the CMake variable GDAL_LIBRARY.

However, a better solution is to delete libodbcinst.so and libodbcinst.so.1
from the lib{32,64} directory your SQLA installation.  These are simply
soft-links to our implementation of the ODBC ini parser, provided as a
convenience to SQLA app developers.  Deleting these soft-links should not
cause any problems.

Best regards,
Dave

Hi Dave (and others interested in SQL Anywhere)

I cam across a problem with linking QGIS libs where I would get the
following error messages:


Linking CXX executable qgis
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.4.5/../../../../lib/libgdal1.7.0.so:

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [src/app/qgis] Error 1
make[1]: *** [src/app/CMakeFiles/qgis.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

After quite a bit of poking around I realised that there was probably
a conflict introduced by my recent SQLAnywhere install.

I commented out the line I added to my ~/.bashrc for SQL Anywhere:

# Added by Tim for sql anywhere support
#source /opt/sqlanywhere12/bin64/sa_config.sh

And then started a new shell, after which the QGIS libs linked
properly. I believe this is due the the libodbc shipped with SQL
Anywhere conflicting with my system lib.

So with that background, is there any elegant way to deal with this? I
guess the stock answer will be that typical users wont be compiling
QGIS so probably won't run into this - though I don't know if there
will be runtime issues introduced by this. Any thoughts? How do you
have your compilation environment set up?

Regards

	evaluation (MCE)
Message-ID: <AANLkTinefrROaUKJ=VrYVKG53i_i8h-9vx99irhNo=Fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I just wanted to let you know that I have uploaded my tool, MCELite, to the
PyQGIS repository. I had to try a few times to get it uploaded, but it seems
to work when downloaded from the repository.

MCELite takes raster files representing decision criteria and analyzes them
using three types of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE): Boolean overlay,
weighted linear combination (WLC) or ordered weighted averaging (OWA). It
also does sensitivity analysis of the results of an analysis. It hasn't been
extensively tested, so it is marked as experimental, but it does run on
Windows, OS X and Linux. The package includes documentation and soem sample
data data sets and configuration files (it reads configuration files in
addition to having interactive input).

Because I wrote it for a study project, I didn't use any existing code (it
turns out it wouldn't have been a problem, but I wanted to be safe) and I
rolled my own Raster object to do the overlay instead of using rastercalc or
something like that. I can still rewrite the back end, but it would be a lot
of work.

The big thing missing from the tool is any kind of fuzzy set membership
analysis. I couldn't find any plugins for QGIS, so you need to create the
input rasters with another tool, if you want to do any kind of interesting
analysis.

Anyway, feel free to try it out, and let me know when it breaks. I am sure
it still has tons of bugs.

Thanks!

JP

On-th-fly raster reprojection is not (IMHO) very expensive. The
complexity depends on the desired output quality (e.g. what type of
interpolation is used) and raster size. I would expect that most of
the raster rendering time is fetching of source data, the warping
itself is simple.

I thought also about adding some kind of unobtrusive feedback from map
canvas indicating possible problems - similar to how browsers nowadays
complain about missing plugin or ask whether to save password. This
feedback could include both errors (e.g. failed to reproject some
parts of layer) and warnings/suggestions (e.g. raster rendering is
slow due missing pyramids, layer has unknown CRS). QGIS could also
suggest the user to reproject his rasters/vectors for faster
rendering.

I think it's reasonable to start new project with unknown CRS by
default and set CRS from the first loaded layer. Of course an option
to override the default project CRS would be convenient for some
people working mostly with one CRS.

No, but at least they can get a notification that a layer has unknown
CRS and thus can be aligned incorrectly.

Hi Chris

I agree this is cumbersome. A possible solution would be to extend the
URI for memory provider - currently it accepts only a string with
geometry type. New syntax could be introduced that would explicitly
set layer CRS, e.g. "geometry=point&crs=4326". Any thoughts and
patches are welcome.

Oh, sorry.  I just saw brushtyler's comment on the bug on TRAC and got active -
looked like an easy fix.

I didn't realize that the announcement was about this bug.  Maybe it better to
take ownership of bugs in TRAC, when starting to work on them.

Afaik raster reprojection is very expensive (see e.g. 
http://mapserver.org/input/raster.html#raster-warping). And the 2-4 times is 
only with umn mapservers clever linearisation along scanlines. With a normal 
warp, it will be much more.

I'm concerned that such a warning could scare newbie users who don't know 
about spatial reference systems at all (and it will be one of the first things 
they see if the datasource crs is not recognized. This happens frequently if 
the data comes from a commercial GIS).

A very important use case here is people working with governemental data 
provided by the local GIS department. The GIS dep. provides everything in the 
same meter CRS and the normal user does not need to know about it, since 
everything overlays properly.

Marco

Hi Rashad,
I'm not sure, but if you want to generate a raster you can use the
File menu > Save as image

or, from the command line, the --snapshot option

The data is rendered directly to the canvas. There is no "stored" image.

I confirm, this is probably the most common situation, and it should be

Hi all.
A few annoying issues:

mismatch between versions, I guess)
* http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/python_plugins/python_plugins.xml is
apparently down since a couple of weeks

Hi Andrea.
We all agree that QGIS still misses some useful functions (that's why
many new functions are being developed every day).
I was referring to the statement:
"The use of Quantum GIS is not intended to replace DSE's investment in
ArcGIS for more sophisticated analysis, mapping and data management
activities"
I am sure the *investment* in QGIS is far more effective, functions for
money, that any other. When organizations stop (or reduce) their
investment in proprietary GIS solutions, and channel the same resources
into QGIS, the advantages are evident.
What is wrong is to compare investment in one solution with no
investment in the other.
Thanks for helping me to clarify.
All the best

Thanks Paolo!

Good idea about the documentation. I will have to figure out how to do that
with Qt. I also need to work on some UML diagrams to show how it all works.

That is a bad bug - it shouldn't crash if it can't find a config file.  What
were you doing when it crashed? It looks like you were running a Boolean
overlay analysis without defining a results file, but it shouldn't allow you
to do that (I just tried, and it pops up an error dialog). Also, what OS are
you using?

I'll see if I can recreate the error, and put in some checks to catch it.

Thanks,
JP

Message-ID: <A2ADD04F5BBA454BA0051ADD33AFBA0B0599BD2E55@WSPMBX1.info.ville.laval.qc.ca>

As per http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7800

Upon installing QGIS 1.6 via the standalone installer, I noticed that the GDAL/OGR version varies among the

1) QGIS GDAL/OGR Build Version - Listed under Help>About>About
2) OGR Data Provider - Listed under Help>About>Providers
3) OGR Layer Converter Plugin - I was unable to find any information regarding the OGR version it was built/compiled against

I also noticed that in the installation files there are system files referring to both GDAL 1.6 and GDAL 1.7; however I am only able to run GDAL 1.5 via command line (called from C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Copiapo\bin).

Could someone please explain if it is possible to make the GDAL/OGR version uniform throughout the QGIS install - ideally the latest stable version of GDAL/OGR? Is it at least possible to run the latest version via command line?

Cheers for any help/suggestions :)

if you want qgis to render faster, remember to enable the caching

Also, set the cache space higher if your data is very big, like mine.
Damn parcels and landuse data :-(

Dear Authors of MCElite and MMQgis and all others plugin Authors! :)

Please keep version numbers in __init__.py and repository xml synchronized.
Otherwise Qgis proposes false upgrade again and again.

It's very good practice to always test plugin upgrade after upload. Instead of 
developing your plugin in ~/.qgis/python/plugins , you can just put a symlink 
to your development directory there and restore it after every test.

Hi Paolo,

I see what happened. You were using the configuration files included in the
distribution, and it was trying to write to a directory that only exists on
my computer (because the full path names are used in the config files - I
haven't figured out how to do this cross-platform with relative paths). It
checks to see if there is a value in there, but it didn't check to see if
the directory existed. Fixed that. I also made it check all input files to
make sure they exist as well.

To make the plugin work, you are going to have to enter a new filename that
can be written in your computer. I should probably leave the results file
out of the configuration file all together (but it saved me time in
development).

There is still a minor bug where the interface does not reset the factor
dropdown menu to the number of correct number of loaded factors when reading
a Boolean configuration file (the others work properly). This should work,
but it doesn't seem to be causing a problem, although it is irritating. I
will try to fix this.

Do I need to increment the version number every time I upload a new package,
or is the date enough to push the new code out to users?

Thanks for the feedback!
JP

That's all using GDAL 1.7.  The output in the about box is wrong (should be fixed
in the nightly build).

You need to run "gdal17" to switch to GDAL 1.7 on the command line.

Hi JP.
Thanks for looking into this. Yes, please increment the version number
(either minor or major) every time you upload a new version.
All the best.

Hi all,
new raster providers are ready for testing. The work is not yet
finished but all the old functionality should be available. Current
status:

- GDAL: on-the-fly reprojection via gdal warp, quite slow, I have not
yet implemented the trick used in Mapserver Marco pointed me to.
Please let me know, if you consider the speed at least acceptable for
real work. The speed depends especially on output display size.

- GRASS: all the old functionality is back, the data are provided
instead of just a picture so that it is possible to assign a style in
QGIS like it was possible with GRASS via GDAL, reprojection is not yet
implemented

- WMS: should work like before, the requested SRS does not yet follow
current project projection

Please test the raster providers branch and let me know about problems:

svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/raster-providers

I would like to merge the branch to trunk and continue the work in trunk.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] symlinks in GRASS plugins
Message-ID: <1294568215.2928.34.camel@ursus.ufficio.net>

Hi all.
In the GRASS plugin there are tens of repeated icons. I would like to
replace them with symlinks, to keep everything more tidy. In principle
this should work:
http://www.rekk.de/bloggy/2008/versioning-symlinks-with-subversion-on-linux/
but in practice it does not:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/15006/trunk
I replaced v.in.gns.?.* with links, but the module do not see them.
I do not know if:
- the method does not work (unlikely)
- I did something wrong
- the GRASS plugin requires the image, and does not accept a link.
Thanks for any help.
All the best.

I tried to package it, to make wider testing easier, but failed:

Maybe the debian/control should be updated?

The error excerpt is a bit short, don't you think?  That happens when you build
with python bindings.  The debian packaging doesn't cause this.

Anyway fixed in r15008.  I accidently committed debian/control myself this
time, but that shouldn't matter.

What about working together in one place?

And in QGIS svn add just smart link, like Paolo starts now with GRASS

To not interfere with several themes/ideas/authors perphaps we shoud

Hi Martin and list readers

I'm experimenting with using a Url format very similar to what Martin suggested.  I'm thinking that this could include the Crs, the list of fields, and the creation of a spatial index. I'm thinking that a Url of the form:

memory?geometry=point&crs=1234&index=yes&field=integer:id&field=string:name ...

The crs can be a simple srid, epsg:id, or (possibly) a proj4 text string.

The path component of this is redundant of course - it could be anything.  To retain backward compatibility though if there is no geometry query field, then the query path will be used.  So the format could be 

point?crs=1234&index=yes...

Including the index in the URI is useful for me (for the MemoryLayerSaver plugin), as it restores that when the layer is recreated when a project is reopened.

I'm not so sure about whether to include the field definitions.  And if I do, I'm not sure about the best way to encode them, and whether to include length and precision fields.  It would probably be more conventional to use something like name:type:length:precision for each field?  Any thoughts.

Finally, I'd like to override the dataSourceUri() function to return a definition reflecting the current state of the provider (ie index, fields, etc).  This is potentially breaking to plugin code if it uses this to determine the geometry type, not that there is any reason to do so.  

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris

I agree this is cumbersome. A possible solution would be to extend the URI for memory provider - currently it accepts only a string with geometry type. New syntax could be introduced that would explicitly set layer CRS, e.g. "geometry=point&crs=4326". Any thoughts and patches are welcome.

Martin

Looks like one of my ideas below won't work.  I was hoping that I could over-ride the QgsDataProvider.dataSourceUri() function to update the Uri as the provider was modified (such as adding an index).  

However I think that this function is only referenced when the provider is set up (ie QgsVectorLayer.setDataProvider() and QgsVectorLayer.setSubString()), which means any other provider initiated changes don't get reflected back to the QgsVectorLayer :-(

For some providers (osm, postgres) the dataSourceUri() function is used to reset the data source when the provider is first assigned to the layer, but not thereafter.

I'm wondering why the QgsDataProvider.dataSourceUri() function isn't used whenever the Uri is needed - as it seems to me it belongs very much to the provider and not to the layer?

Would it make sense to replace references to QgsMapLayer.mDataSource with calls to QgsMapLayer.dataSourceUri(), and to have that use the provider dataSourceUri() function unless the provider was not defined.

Cheers
Chris

MXD is a closed binary format that has not been reverse engineered as
far as I know by any open source project. You will need to recreate your
map from your data in QGIS by hand.

Hi Radim

Nice to see you are making good progresses with raster redesign!

Please give the dev team a bit time to review all the changes. I'd like to 
have a closer look at the code. However, it's my first day back at work, so it 
could take a few days until I can give feedback.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,
the code is quite ugly at moment, I still keep old pieces of code commented.

Regarding the reprojection, I would like to implement the approximate
reprojection (similar to mapserver you showed me) in
QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock and overwrite it only in WMS
provider. GDAL warp is too slow (as expected) and no way to speed it
up AFAIK.

Here [1]  I have my small standalone application, which I use as viewing 
plugin for PgAdmin. It takes arguments from command line as schema, 
table ... to determine which dataset to open. If You replace them to 
open shapefiles, You can have what You need.

Do not forget to look to Qgis cookbook.

Btw. today GeoTools/GeoServer guys published a blog post about
improving raster reprojection speed:
http://geo-solutions.blogspot.com/2011/01/developers-corner-improving.html

There's also a link to a more verbose 35-page tech report on this
matter. From a brief look it's the same approach as used in MapServer.

Yes, it is. I've told the same to the Geotools guys ;)
Nice because during holidays you remembered me about the approach Mapserer
uses, and again I was wondering if it will ever be abopted in Geotools...
Here it is :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyspatialite connector maintenance
Message-ID: <20110110175724.M88017@lqt.it>

Hi all developers,

I recently noticed that during the
last month there was an increasing
number of posts into the SpatiaLite's
own mailing list about QGIS / SpatiaLite.
Several users where experiencing some
difficulties when using python plugins:
most notably on Win/OSGeo4W, but on
Ubuntu as well.

During the last days I've performed a
quite thorough debugging, so I'm now 
ready to submit to your attention a 
full report about this topic.
It looks like we have a "broken/missing
link" into the QGIS build/release cycle :-(

=======================================

a) just as a remember: SQLite/SpatiaLite
   aren't client/server, so the same
   library acts in both sql-engine and
   connector roles

b) QGIS directly includes into its base
   code a "private internal copy" of
   sqlite/splite (after all, simply
   two C source are required to implement
   sqlite/spatialite).
   and I personally take care to update
   QGIS each time a new splite's release
   is available.
   so QGIS 1.6 and 1.7-trunk are now 
   supporting the most recent 2.4.0-RC4.

c) but on the Python's side the pyspatialite
   connector still continues using the 
   nowadays obsolete v.2.3.1 (pyspatialite
   as well uses a "private internal copy" of
   sqlite/splite: unhappily, an obsolete one).
   Consequently several issues deriving from 
   mismatching versions arise.
   and apparently nobody is taking care to
   update/synchronize pyspatialite and
   spatialite.

I suppose that all this will sound really
odd and puzzling for end users.
After all, when you have just installed the 
latest QGIS (may be from OSGeo4W) you aren't 
surely expecting to get two mismatching 
versions for the same library to be shipped 
together, one supporting the "main" app,
and the second one supporting python plugins.

So I suppose we are urgently required to
implement some improvement into the QGIS
build/release system, so to grant that
a consistent versioning state is always
ensured.

I'm not at all a CMake guru: and my Python
skills are very superficial.
Anyway I suppose that one of the following
options can surely be implemented:

a) put the pyspatialite sources directly
   into the QGIS build tree, in such a way
   that each time the splite's data provider
   is updated, the same update will surely
   affect the python connector 

b) alternatively (if python own idiosyncrasies
   forbid adopting the above approach),
   inventing something different granting an
   equivalent result.
   But I strongly feel that the pyspatialite 
   maintenance cannot be any longer let in
   an uncontrolled out-of-sync state.

Any useful hint, suggestions and further
considerations from you are surely welcome. 

bye
Sandro

P.S.: here you can get a technical note 
explaining in full detail how-to build 
the pyspatialite connector:

Hi Radim,

I try to build raster providers branch on Windows with MSVC Express 2008
against dependencies from OSGeo4W (gdal 1.7.3) and get next error:

Any hints on this?

Hi Paolo,

Maybe a file external instead? SVN >= 1.6 is needed. An example:

### CREATE THE FILE ###

  $ echo 'file1 content' > repo_wc/file_1.txt

  $ svn add repo_wc/file_1.txt
  A         repo_wc/file_1.txt

  $ svn ci repo_wc/file_1.txt -m 'adding file_1.txt to version control'
  Adding         repo_wc/file_1.txt
  Transmitting file data .
  Committed revision 1.

### LINK IT ###

  $ svn up repo_wc/
  At revision 1.

  $ svn propset svn:externals 'file_2.txt 
file:///home/pok/repo/file_1.txt' repo_wc/
  property 'svn:externals' set on 'repo_wc'

  $ svn ci repo_wc/ -m 'file_2.txt is a copy of file_1.txt'
  Sending        repo_wc
  Committed revision 2.

  $ svn up repo_wc/
  Fetching external item into 'repo_wc/file_2.txt'
  E    repo_wc/file_2.txt
  Updated external to revision 2.
  Updated to revision 2.

### BOTH FILES ARE NOW THERE AND HAVE THE SAME CONTENT ###

  $ ls -l repo_wc/
  total 8
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pok pok 14 Jan 10 20:23 file_1.txt
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pok pok 14 Jan 10 20:24 file_2.txt

  $ cat repo_wc/*
  file1 content
  file1 content

Thanks for testing and sorry for inconvenience,
indeed , the callback function was left in raster layer, I have
commited temporary fix.
Later we have to add signals to providers.

Done in  r15015.  Looks like that works on Windows and Linux Not sure about
OSX.

PS: I'm neither a frequent spatialite (manager) user nor a pythonista, so

Even though reprojection is expensive, it's probably better to
reproject the layer than to render it misaligned :-)
Anyway reprojecting every single point using the coordinate transform
formulas wastes a lot of processing power and should be done more
wisely. We have this problem also with reprojecting of vector layers
(every single points is reprojected using the expensive formula).

Ideally if all the data from government is in the same CRS, no
reprojecting will happen - because the project CRS will be the same as
the CRS of individual layers (thus no warning would be issued).

The problem here is that many organization keep most of their data in
the same projection, but without a .prj file.
So if they work without reprojection, everything works smoothly, and
they do not see anything wrong with that.

All the best.

Message-ID: <1294736049873-5910057.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi,
I'm new to QGIS. I'm trying to use it in a gt project created in visual
studio. I'm just creating a qgsmapcanvas in order to display a raster map.
In release mode everthing seems ok. However in debug mode, my application
closes itself during qgsmapcanvas intitialization. I thought the reason is
because I need debug dll's of qgs libraries. So I have been trying to build
qgis from source for two days. Finally I managed to do it. However again
some dll problems exist and I cannot open my program. So the question is
what should I do to use qgis libraries in debug mode of another qt

Hi!

definitely correct .. speaking of my own experience it's not just 
keeping the data without the .prj files ..
I've also seen a lot of companys (including governments) sending shape 
files just as the ".shp"
And i always wonder how ArcGIS is the job of correctly open the files .. 
but thats another story ..

still hope that raster reprojection on the fly will work soon!
good luck and many thanks to radim for doing that job!!

regards
Werner

Not entirely correct. As QGIS works now, each new project 
starts in Lon/Lat WGS84. If I all my layers are in the same 
projected CRS I don't notice any problem *until* I want to 
measure something ;-(

You are right, I was unclear: I meant, they do not see any problem if
they use other (proprietary) software. In qgis they have to define their
default CRS.

True, your suggestion to add the possibility to set a default CRS for the map 
would be useful.
 
There will always be problems at some point if the layers / map CRS are not 
properly set. I just want to avoid more complications compared to the current 
situation if this is not the case ( because it happens so frequently in 
practice ).

Marco

My idea was that if they have layers with unknown CRS, also the
project's CRS would be set to unknown. So no reprojection would happen
and no warnings shown. Even measuring could work to some degree -
assuming planar coordinates, with unknown units. Warnings would be
issued only when user explicitly does an action where known CRS is
necessary - e.g. change project CRS, add a layer with different
(known) CRS. There could be a "learn more" button leading to a brief
explanation of CRS, projections and why is it good to have them in
order - we could educate our users :)

The ArcMap method of setting the project CRS based on the 
first layer that the user loads might be best. It's a 
"dumbed-down" solution that assumes the user doesn't 
understand what he's doing, but it will nicely cover those 
cases where all the data is in only one CRS.

That sounds good to me (no reprojection and no warning shown in case of 
unknown CRS).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to use setStyle in QgsComposerScaleBar Class
Message-ID: <1294743755876-5910397.post@n2.nabble.com>


Hi everybody,

I'm working on a Python PlugIn which creates a map composition.
In the map composition I want to implement a scalebar item in numeric style.
I try to implement the scalebar item with the following code

 
item = QgsComposerScaleBar(composition)
item.setStyle('Numeric')
item.setItemPosition(margin_left+offset_x,  margin_top+offset_y)
composerView.addComposerScaleBar(item)


With this code I get a scalebar item in the print composer but it's in
single Box style.
It doesn't matter what kind of style I select in setStyle.
It's everytime single Box style.
No error messages.


print item.style() 


prints the correct style.
Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Thx in advance for your answers

Hi Paolo,

Maybe a file external instead? SVN >= 1.6 is needed. An example:

### CREATE THE FILE ###

  $ echo 'file1 content' > repo_wc/file_1.txt

  $ svn add repo_wc/file_1.txt
  A         repo_wc/file_1.txt

  $ svn ci repo_wc/file_1.txt -m 'adding file_1.txt to version control'
  Adding         repo_wc/file_1.txt
  Transmitting file data .
  Committed revision 1.

### LINK IT ###

  $ svn up repo_wc/
  At revision 1.

  $ svn propset svn:externals 'file_2.txt 
file:///home/pok/repo/file_1.txt' repo_wc/
  property 'svn:externals' set on 'repo_wc'

  $ svn ci repo_wc/ -m 'file_2.txt is a copy of file_1.txt'
  Sending        repo_wc
  Committed revision 2.

  $ svn up repo_wc/
  Fetching external item into 'repo_wc/file_2.txt'
  E    repo_wc/file_2.txt
  Updated external to revision 2.
  Updated to revision 2.

### BOTH FILES ARE NOW THERE AND HAVE THE SAME CONTENT ###

  $ ls -l repo_wc/
  total 8
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pok pok 14 Jan 10 20:23 file_1.txt
  -rw-r--r-- 1 pok pok 14 Jan 10 20:24 file_2.txt

  $ cat repo_wc/*
  file1 content
  file1 content

Hi Michael

> Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

It is a bug. However, as a short time workaround, I think it works if you use 
'setStyle' after 'addComposerScaleBar':

item = QgsComposerScaleBar(composition)
composerView.addComposerScaleBar(item)
item.setItemPosition(margin_left+offset_x,  margin_top+offset_y)
item.setStyle('Numeric')
item.update()


Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

yes your workaround works for me.
Thanks.
Should I open a ticket for the bug?

Regards,

Michael

Thanks Borys! Sorry, I missed the email, I was involved in another project.

I think the easiest solution to keep track of in the long run is to
simply allow the image file to be defined in the qgm file for a given
tool, and default to matching as currently done if none is specified.
Radim thought this was also a good approach and asked that a ticket be
filed for it (sounded like he might implement it).

Thanks,

Pretty much same as in case of symlinks:

1. In SVN repo you maintain the original file only. An external is a 
"kind of a symlink" to the original file. If you commit changes in the 
SVN repo to a file which has externals, those externals will have the 
latest content of that file after svn co/up in a working copy.

2. Less space used on the SVN server.

Ticket already opened, as per Radim suggestion.
Is there anybody planning to implement this soon, or should I start copying the new icons?
Thanks.

Hi,
A few potential hints with respect to invisible .ui files in qtcreator
project view:

-the qt creator parser has rules that differs from qmake ones
apparently, see this thread:
http://www.mail-archive.com/qt-creator@trolltech.com/msg00738.html

-This thread suggested to recreate the .user file (did not work for me):
http://www.mail-archive.com/qt-creator@trolltech.com/msg02002.html


-According to this thread, "when FORMS appears on the last line
of the pro file, QtCreator won't recognize it.":
http://www.mail-archive.com/qt-creator@trolltech.com/msg00705.html

Hope it helps
Mayeul

It's probably better to leave that information in TRAC.

You should simply "accept" the bug in TRAC, when you start to work on it and
attach the patch to the ticket, when your done.  Adding a keyword like "kcube"
might be a good idea.

"Accepting" can be skipped, if it's a thing that can be fixed quickly and
therefore the window between starting the work and attaching the patch is
rather small.

Agreed, even (apparently) simple changes can have unexpected
consequences. The discussions on this topic have been very
interesting, but back to the point. At present, QGIS reports the CRS
of a layer whose projection it cannot determine as the QGIS default
CRS. It would be very helpful if the CRSs of such layers were reported
by QGIS as 'unknown'. At present, right-clicking on a layer and going
Properties -> General can produce downright wrong information on the
CRS of the layer and I think this is undesirable.

Regards, Nick.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How long is the compiling time for a build all
	QGIS?
Message-ID: <900681.93449.qm@web33706.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am attempting the first compile trial of QGIS from the trunk and I have been waiting for the compilation to end for the last two hours. Is that how long it will take if one builds all? I am using the OSGEO install in Windows XP with Visual C++ Express 9. My computer has 4GB memory and it is a Core2 Duo 8400 3GHz processor. 

What am I doing wrong? The place it is waiting at is shown below (from the output of the compiler) and I only see that it is still continuing and I am compiling the release with debug version.

I looked at the build order output and found this error and that is where it seems to have gotten stuck, 

3>Generating qgssearchstringparser.cpp
3>m4: cannot open `Files\GnuWin32/share/bison': No such file or directory

I am not sure why it can not find the the files (the space in the file path is causing this problem?), and where it needs to be fixed? 

Any ideas?

Yeah I had this issue when trying to build Qgis on windows.  I just moved
the whole GnuWin32 to C:\GnuWin32 and re ran cmake to point it to the new
path.

Uninstalling GnuWin32 and reinstalling into C:\GnuWin32 might be better then
just moving the folder.

Hope this helps.

Thank you for the input Nathan. I was able to get through the issue.

I now have been able to compile QGIS in VC 2008. But the trunk source has errors and it is not building completely. 

I am interested right now in building a sample C++ plugin. I am looking for some documentation on how I can compile a plugin that will run in my trunk (Ver. 1.7) installation would be kindly welcome.

Thank you,

Maaza

I tried building today on OS X. The build failed with the following output:

I have no such problem building from a fresh copy of qgis trunk.

What about http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html
The "QGIS Coding and Compilation Guide" should have some examples inside.

Hi, thanks for testing.
Unfortunately I have no idea. QSet is not used in the code I touched.
I don't know much about Python bindings.
python/core/conversions.sip is generated somehow automaticaly?
Does it need to updated?

Radim

That's fine. Like that, I won't get completely lost in the code :-)

The approximate reprojection would be cool. Wouldn't it be better to implement 
it on rasterlayer level instead instead of QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock? 
Like that, all providers would have reprojection capabilities (e.g. GRASS 
too).

With one of my favorite test dataset, I noted a problem with automatic 
assignment of nodata value and automatic insertion into the transparency list. 
In that case, the raster is a colortable map (byte) and has no nodata value. 
So 255 is set to transparent and the map appears completely different than 
expected...

Is it correct that the draw() method which returns QImage is not necessary 
anymore (or only for API compatibility for now)? Seems it can be handled quite 
nicely with QImage::bits(). 
In the future, it would be nice to have also support for create() and write() 
operations in the provider interface (and the gdal provider). Then I could 
port rastercalculator & terrain analysis to use the provider interface.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] multi-view
Message-ID: <4D2EBD11.5050905@gmail.com>

Hi all,

thanks for all developer for this big and great work on qgis.
I work for an astrophysics and planetology laboratory and i have create 
a qgis fork with 1.4.0 version.
Many researcher work with envi software to analyse their image and use 
multi-view to work.
So i create a fork to add multi-view and hyperspectral analyse. See the 
link 
http://www.coriolys.org/post/2011/01/13/VahineView-fork-of-Qgis-software 
for a screen shot.

My question is this feature (multi-view) is interesting for qgis team ?
If yes, i am interesting to know how to integrate this to official qgis 
code.
In this time i have still some little bugs with interaction between 
active view and zoom-view at the right bottom.
For the time being i work only in the hyperspectral analysis tool.

regards

ludovic

Hi Ludovic

Looks nice. Yes, multi view is definitely of interest.

> If yes, i am interesting to know how to integrate this to official qgis

The best thing is to create a patch that can be applied to the current trunk 
version (1.4 is a bit old now). Create a ticket in trac 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis) , attach the patch and add a bit of textual 
description. It will then be review by the dev team.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Strange behaviour of TMS RAS plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTinvmX9fL3KzyQLkDjWa0RRo1vSSocgbWOL+U2D_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
we are the developers of "TMS RAS plugin" uploaded on the official
"repo" by Paolo Cavallini in november 2010.
Working on the plugin we have found some little bugs, that we have
fixed by deleting one exceeding text file; however, during the test of
this new release [1] on Qgis 1.6 (windows XP pro 32 and 64-bit) we
have experienced a strange behaviour: the installation procedure
doesn't create the plugin directory (named "ras") in the "plugins"
directory. The same procedure tested on ubuntu linux 10.10 and Qgis
1.6 works properly.
There is some problem, but we don't know which one.
In any case we would like to replace the plug in (we've got an account
on pyqgis.org).

[1] http://webgis.regione.sardegna.it/software/plugins.xml


Thanks in advance
Best regards
Michele

Hello Everyone,

      I am working on the below ticket. While proceeding I came through with
a question, whether we should deal the particular bug either with "null"
which means no value or with "null" which is a text null ? 

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2974

I believe he is talking about null as in no value. This is the kind
of behavior that I would use.

QgsRasterDataProvider::readBlock can be either used (inherited) by
provider (including GRASS) or it can be reimplemented in the provider.

I'll look at it, can you put somewhere on Web a piece of that raster?

No, at moment it is not used, it was used by providers returning image (WMS)
but I have used another data type ARGBDataType instead.

Hi All,

multiview is nice and remember me the addtab capabilities
(that's an other way to have multiview, 
the tab are detachable and mouse over on the relative tab show a canvas preview)

so, i hope the multiview work will not forget as :

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1622

lynxID and me worked hard to develop and test it,
AddTabb patch was needed to start to develop the planet plug-in.

The patch was never applied due to main api change ?

hi!

it would be perfect if you could combine these two things into one -
and merge it into current trunk ..
both seem to be very nice and useful things .. i hope they will not
make other things too complicated ;)

Hi Ludovic,

nevermind .. your efforts are not lost
beacouse the patch is old, it needs to be revisited
and your work with multispectral analisys results 
can be fused with the addtab patch.

just having it fixed to be able to apply it on the actual trunk .. should be a good first step
it is also nice to have you intersted on multiview too,
maybe this time we will finally have it implemented in qgis

i like and use the multiview capability (like in grass).

note, i was just a guinea pig (tester) for it :-)
all the hard cpp work was made by LinxID

All my thanks to Him!

thanks!

Massimo.

Message-ID: <201101131637.24752.sven.bauhan@ast.dfs.de>

Hi,

I am new here and dont know if this is the correct place for this question.

I want to write an Editor for geographical data based on the QGis libraries. 
So i tried to compile and understand the code examples from Tim Sutton.

The examples compile but in example 2 the loading of data fails with the 
messages:

Failed to load
Layer is NOT valid

But the data seem to be correct, as it can be loaded into the QGis 
Apllication.
Are there some hints to find out what the problem is?

Thanks,
Sven Bauhan

Hi Massimo

My apologies. Yes, the patch got forgotten after the Vienna hackfest. I 
remember it was postponed because of a release and not taken afterwards.

That would be great. After porting it to trunk, please assign it to Tim (app 
guru in the dev team).

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How long is the compiling time for a build all
	QGIS? Solved!

Message-ID: <894519.70636.qm@web33701.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Thanks to Macho and Nathan and all of you who are excellent QGIS supporters, I was able to compile the application without errors. 

The errors posted were a result of prior installation of OSGEO include directory being left unchanged in CMake List of variables. Once I fixed that it was able to find the missing header files. 

I am off to a clean start, and will do a bit of fiddling with the plugins to test out my ideas. I will read Marco's documentation on the coding guideline file. I may even post some plugins, who knows where it will lead. But I am excited about the prospects of using QGIS to help me think better solutions for my GIS in Transportation problems.

I may even solve my personal crisis, one never knows what tomorrow will bring. But it is good to have an extra tool like QGIS to help along the way.

Hi!

> I am interested right now in building a sample C++ plugin. I am looking for some documentation on how I can compile a plugin that will run in my trunk (Ver. 1.7) installation would be kindly welcome.

What about http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html
The "QGIS Coding and Compilation Guide" should have some examples inside.

Hi Radim,

Turning off python bindings got it to build. J?rgen pointed out this patch from last month that fixed that particular build problem:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/14988

You might want to sync the branch to current trunk, although that could create new problems I suppose. I applied the patch because I was interested in seeing if the branch handles the openlayer plugin for transforms from the Google Mercator projection. I'm happy to report that it worked just fine. This will be a great boon to work that I and many others do, I'm sure.

Not surprisingly, the raster transforms can be very costly with large datasets. A hillside of mine that is 26828???28695 with 30m resolution takes several minutes to load in full view. When zoomed in considerably, performance is quite acceptable. (This particular file does not have pyramids built. It is noteworthy that the option to build pyramids is no longer available in the raster provider branch. A dialog saying the file type is not supported for pyramid building is shown. In trunk, the pyramid build option works for the same file.)

Comparing the load time of this raster when the project CRS is the same as the raster (i.e., no transform should be occurring), the load time still requires several minutes. This is true whether or not I have enabled on the fly reprojection in the project options. In contrast, the same file takes several seconds to load in trunk. Perhaps there needs to be a CRS check on rasters to bypass whatever is happening to consume so many cpu cycles when transforms are unnecessary?

All told, this is excellent work. I look forward to whatever efficiency improvements might make it into the code based on the conversations occurring in this thread. I also look forward to this moving into the main branch so everyone can benefit from your work.

Regards,
John

Hi all.
I noticed in today's course that splitting a polygon with an island
creates 3 polygons, not 1+1 with an island: is this a planned feature?
It seems reasonable (otherwise, to which polygon should the island be
attached?), but somewhat unexpected.
All the best.

Same with PostGIS's ST_Split.
Simplifies the semantic (always explode).

you have probably forgotten to set the correct path to QGIS
installation. Without that, QGIS cannot locate modules which are
necessary for loading of various types of layers. Look for
setPrefixPath() function in your code and check what you pass there.
You don't write what OS do you use, but for example on unix systems
the default path where QGIS is installed is /usr (if installed from a
distribution package) or /usr/local (if built from source).

Could it be that you are linking to an old version of libqgis_core.so? Because 
QgsComposerScaleBar::applyDefaultSize was added after 14993, so a conflict 
between two library versions could be the reason.

Hi all.
Creating internal pyramids modifies the original file. Wouldn't it be
better to rename the original file by default? Is there any special
reason not to do so? If not, I can open a ticket for this.
All the best.

I am not compiling. I am using the Synaptic Package Manager.

However, in console / terminal is saying the right version.

Maybe adding checkbox (default True) to create backup file would be better.

I agree. Always renaming to create a backup could become a disk space

I did not find a method call to setPrefixPath() but I changed a call to
QgsProvideRegistry::instance( myPluginsDir ).

Now it works - so I only need to understand now what happens there :-)

Just chiming in (as a user): I prefer the option to create external 
overviews as default (.ovr), which preserves the original raster, and an 
optional checkbox to create internal overviews, eventually with a 
warning that this changes the original raster, so the user can make a 
backup. Note: recent gdal can also remove the overviews (gdaladdo None 
if I recall correctly)
Having a original raster and a separate ovr file imho is cleaner than 
having a backup of the original and next to it the original with 
internal overviews. And it saves space, too.

just my 2c.

Yes, please send the rasters for testing. Please also add the output settings

Hi all

We pleased to announce the RoadGraph plugin for QGIS.

It's a C++ plugin for finding shortest path between two points
on roads graph. Any polyline layer can be used as roads layer e.g.
shapefiles from OSM. 

Additional information can be found at GIS-Lab
http://gis-lab.info/qa/road-graph.html
at this time only in Russian, sorry. We're working on English
description.

Screenshot of the plugin in action

Binary files available both for Windows and Linux:
 Windows http://svn.gis-lab.info/road-graph/binary/roadgraphplugin.dll
 Linux   http://svn.gis-lab.info/road-graph/binary/libroadgraphplugin.so

Thanks a lot Alex!
So bad your interesting plugins are not in trunk.
Any special reason to keep them outside it?

Still this undefined symbol: _ZN19QgsComposerScaleBar16applyDefaultSizeEv is in

Quantum GIS - 1.7.0-Trunk 'Trunk' (15050M)

Anybody can fix this undefined symbol?

~~~~~
Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.


Traceback (most recent call last):

Thanks.

OK. I solve this problem.

It seems that libqgis package is not automatically updated when we
update the qgis.

HI Alexander!
And thanks for the plugin!
But I'm not able to get it to run on windows 7. I just extracted the dll
file to the qgis/plugins directory, near the other dll files. When I load
the plugin, qgis crashes.
Am I doing something wrong? Has anyone succeded in installing on win7?
All the best,
Mauricio

Hi,
I was not able to use the plugin with recent qgis 1.7.0  (r15004) under
GNU/Linux Kubuntu 10.10.
I tried to copy the downloaded libroadgraphplugin.so
in  /usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libroadgraphplugin.so
The plugin does not appear in the list of plugins to activate.

I compiled it from source doing the following:


sudo-apt-get install liqgis-dev
svn co http://svn.gis-lab.info/road-graph road-graph
cd road-graph
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
# or:
# sudo
cp ../binary/libroadgraphplugin.so /usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libroadgraphplugin.so

Then, qgis crashes immediately after launching it.

Even after the following, qgis crashes:
sudo rm /usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libroadgraphplugin.so

I had to reinstall qgis (in fact to upgrade to dev version 15050) to be
able to restart it.
Thanks for any hint.
Mayeul

With further testing I was able to run the dll on windows 7 on qgis 1.6.
My first tests were with qgis 1.7dev from osgeo4w.
Maybe something on the new version is not working with the plugin.
All the best,
Mauricio de Paulo

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=eHsrh0T6K1CiGuHLYtNG48Me-JgZCWbrWYNgS@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to join attributes from DBF file to shapefile and I find
flools very slow to do this job.

Here is the facts
1. DBF file is 44.8 Mb to be joined to shapefile
2. flools is working but only creating 2 Mb per 30 minutes on dbf file.
3. Qgis freezed by flools is still working.

At this rate, it will take me 22 hrs to get the final result.

Any python script or any script, solution to speed this job?

Do you think doing this job using spatialite will speed up completion
of this job?

Thanks.

Yes, I tried MMQGIS. It did not work. It read the column names but
not the data.

Ftools is more robust than mmqgis, I think. It is just slow.

I understand Ftools is in the process of being ported to C++ plugins.

Yes, one option is to do this in a database. I do things like this in
spatialite all the time. Import your shp and your table then do a join
either temporarily as a view or make a new table.
SELECT * FROM shp JOIN table on shp.id = table.id

Enjoy,
Alex

Again, I've never really tried, but from gdal/ogr documentation it seems
possible to do this through ogr2ogr using ogr sql's join.

The problem is that with reprojection we always need null values even
if not defined by raster. At moment I just assigned the max value for
each data type which is obviously wrong as you proved.
The question is how to passed null values from provider to raster
layer. We could:

1) scan all values for a not used value, but it can slow down first
loading and it is not always successful (for short data types all
values may be occupied)

2) always use longer data type (int for byte, float for int etc), the
bigger size probably is not problem because we usually need only a
block of data for screen (for double it is max around 1600*1200*8 =
14MB), but what about Float64 - could/should we use long double, it
can be 96 or 128 bits and not available on ARM(?) etc...

3) probably the right solution would be to use separate bit matrix as
null flags, but that would complicate too much the implementation

Maybe a combination of 1+ 2? 1 for shorter types - byte/int and 2 for
float/double? How to find quickly a not used value?

I am waiting for your ideas.

You are right, I should merge trunk more frequently.

> Not surprisingly, the raster transforms can be very costly with large datasets. A hillside of mine that is 26828???28695 with 30m resolution takes several minutes to load in full view. When zoomed in considerably, performance is quite acceptable. (This particular file does not have pyramids built. It is noteworthy that the option to build pyramids is no longer available in the raster provider branch. A dialog saying the file type is not supported for pyramid building is shown. In trunk, the pyramid build option works for the same file.)

Pyramids are not yet enabled, at moment I pay attention to correct
basic rendering of all data types in all providers.

> Comparing the load time of this raster when the project CRS is the same as the raster (i.e., no transform should be occurring), the load time still requires several minutes. This is true whether or not I have enabled on the fly reprojection in the project options. In contrast, the same file takes several seconds to load in trunk. Perhaps there needs to be a CRS check on rasters to bypass whatever is happening to consume so many cpu cycles when transforms are unnecessary?

I cannot say if gdal warp is always slow or it could be speed up by
changing init params, I see however that the approximate reprojection
is necessary, so that will be the next step.

Or we can just use NaN for float/double and float + NaN for byte/int?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Set default TIFF options for QGIS
Message-ID: <4D32EE0C.7090900@enoreth.net>

Hi,

I would like to talk about the default image's options used by QGIS's 
tools. The most used output format is TIFF in its simplest form, which 
is quite unfriendly when you look at the resulting space disk involved.

I suppose that the majority of this list like to fine tune their output 
(when given the choice by the GUI) but a big part of the general users 
doesn't know about all the possible options, the result is they soon get 
some gigabytes of data. It makes harder to copy the images on a usb key 
or to forward it on the networks, it also has a impact on 
visualization's performance.

A good politic would be to assume that every tiff created by QGIS should 
makes use of a few basic options to ease the work of the users, without 
having them noticing it or asking them about it. If the user choose 
personal options, they would overwrite the default ones.

For example :
- COMPRESS=PACKBITS, reduces the size by 50% and is supported by every 
gis software I can think of (LZW or DEFLATE are not, due to some patents 
bigotry)
- TILED=YES, enables to zoom close and pan without reloading the whole image
- TFW=YES, brings compatibility
- BIGTIFF=IF_NEEDED, enables their whole dataset to 
converted/interpolated/etc. without stopping for no apparent reason

This way, generic users gets a better QGIS's experience and the tiff 
expert still gets what he wants, no sacrifice for anyone.

More advanced choice could also be made, like the automatic creation of 
a screensize pyramid if the base image is big. When the user adds this 
image to his project, it loads in a second. It gives a better impression 
than having to wait for the loading.

I decided to reduce the number of columns of the csv / dbf file and
use spatialite to do this job. Then, I desired table is dump into a
shapefile.

It works but it took more than a hour to accomplish this task.

The resulting spatialite database is 1.0 GB and the shapefile dbf file
( the dump file) is 522.2 Mb.

My laptop is slow in opening the spatialite but hared time opening the
shapefile.

The data that I am working is country database in village level.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikFUUBEY_EtRSivLKUkyJadFahoywAdThSby1Ye@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I am making the plugin, where i use this method
"core.QgsCoordinateTransform.transform", the QGis showed dialog error.

I tested by Python console and the same error showed.

The script to run on python console:

from qgis import core
mapCanvas = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas()
srsCanvas = mapCanvas.mapRenderer().destinationSrs()
srsGoogle = core.QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(900913,
core.QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId)
pntCenter = mapCanvas.extent().center()
print pntCenter
coodTrans = core.QgsCoordinateTransform(srsCanvas, srsGoogle)
pntCenter = coodTrans.transform(pntCenter,
core.QgsCoordinateTransform.ForwardTransform) # Error showed here!
print pntCenter

Message error:

Title dialog : Exception
Text message:
forward transform(-0.832741, -0.274682)
failed with error: No such file or directory


My enviroment:
Windows XP
Package from OSGEO install.
QGIS trunck r15051

When i continue running the plugin, the next time call this methods the
error does not appear.

I need initialize one library before call the transform's method  ?

How much ram does your laptop have? This can be a major bottleneck with
the dataset size you're talking about. Consider adding more if you
aren't maxed out.

Agreed: same thing for GRASS (and its QGIS plugin). It is difficult to
come out with a solution that is both simple and flexible.
The current inflexible situation adopted by QGIS is obviously
suboptimal. Moreover, the behaviour of various core plugins and commands
is inconsistent, sometimes saving the extension (*.tif), sometimes not,
and sometimes saving in a different format.
Would you like to open a ticket (or more) on this?
All the best.

Hi Radim

Using NaN sounds like a good idea and Qt has platform independent support for 
it (qIsNan & co.).
All other solutions I can think of seem to be more complicated (e.g. force a 
transparency value only if raster is reprojected).

>float + NaN for byte/int?

This is not clear to me. Could you explain your approach for byte/int?

Marco

can gis-lab consider to contribute to trunk also the qgis2google plugin?
The tool works pretty fine and it is very useful.

Hi all

Looks like a very useful tool. +1 for inclusion into trunk.
Sergey, would you be available as a maintainer for the roadgraph plugin?

In future, it would also be good to move the non-gui routing code to the 
analysis library  (such that plugins could reuse it if they want to embed 
routing functionality).

Regards,
Marco

I thought that if data type of the source is integer the provider
could represent them as floating point. Byte can be represented as
integer. Bad solution however.

In future, I use boost graph library for more graph algorithms and I will implement get graph from polygonal layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cleanly create memory layer in Python?
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTimetRtK71YnvOvmUZuMJ7dP+REhHBQsJcayVu0y@mail.gmail.com>

I've added submitted a patch to implement this change at http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3414.

Changes made are:

* QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem? string constructor has been generalised to allow string formats
   epsg:1234
   postgis:1234
   internal:1234
   proj4:proj_4_string
   wkt:wkt_string
   wkt_string
This is implemented by a createFromString function, similar to the createFromId function

* Changed QgsMemoryProvider URI format to:
   memory?geometry=Point&index=yes&crs=epsg:1234&field=id:integer&field=name:string(25)

The URI can contain the following items:
   geometry=Point|LineString|Polygon|MultiPoint|MultiLineString|MultiPolygon
   index=yes  - creates a spatial index
   crs=...    - defines the CRS in one of the formats above
   field=definition - defines an attribute field.

The field definition is a field name, optionally followed by :type(length,precision), where type is one of integer, int, real, double, and string (int/integer are synonyms, as are real/double).  Eg
   field=magnitude:real(16,2)
   field=owner:string(64)
   field=owner

This uses Qurl for encoding and decoding the strings.  To provide backwards compatibility, if there is no geometry query string field, then the path is taken as the geometry type.  For example
   point
   point?crs=epsg:1234

* Added an option crs=xxxx to the QgsDelimitedTextProvider URI, so that plugin code can specify the CRS when creating a delimited text layer.  The crs can be any of the formats listed above. Also updated the provider to use Qurl for encoding and decoding the URI, to ensure consistent handling of special characters.

* Made a couple of small fixes to the QgsMemoryProviderPlugin UI component to ensure that it correctly remembers the last choice of delimiter type (and to encode the data source URI using Qurl)


One thing I haven't done is to modify the handling of datasourceUri in QgsVectorLayer to ensure that it always uses the datasourceUri from the provider, rather than storing its own version when the layer is created (or the provider is reset).  I'm not sure how safe this would be - that is whether all the data providers correctly handle the datasourceUri() function.  I think this would be the right thing to do though - I think that the provider should be responsible for its own URI.  Any comments on the wisdom of changing this would be welcome!

Cheers
Chris

Hi Chris

I agree this is cumbersome. A possible solution would be to extend the URI for memory provider - currently it accepts only a string with geometry type. New syntax could be introduced that would explicitly set layer CRS, e.g. "geometry=point&crs=4326". Any thoughts and patches are welcome.

Martin

Hi all,

first of all, sorry for the delay in publishing this :-)

At [1] you can find a basic layer list (legend) widget for PyQGIS standalone
applications. It's under GPL v.2. and it is based on the OpenOceanMap legend
[2] written by Aaron Racicot and, of course, on the QGIS layer list widget.

See [1] for further information and instructions to add it to your
application.

Regards,

Hi All

I think its time to start thinking about getting 2.0 'out'. What do
others think? The major goal would be to

- clean up the api and remove cruft / inelegant parts / backwards
compatibility wrappers
- do an overhaul of the api docs and get it to a good state (doxygen wise)
- get rid of old labelling completely
- get rid of old symbology completely
- merge many of the plugins directly into trunk (north arrow, gps,
coordinate capture, delimited text, georeferencer, some form of raster
colours / 1 band raster colour table etc.)
- capitalise on the bug fixing work of SunilRaj from kCube so that his
time is going into stabilising for a 2.0 release
- show the world that we have reached the next level of maturity and
functionality
-

As such I would propose the following time line
(http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklists)

Release Checklist 1.7 - Not yet named 	1 April 2011 		
  Introduce threaded rendering, raster on the fly projection, 3D globe mode
Release Checklist 1.8 - Not yet named 	1 July 2011 		
  Full GUI freeze for 2.0, no more old symbology, old labelling
Release Checklist 2.0 - Not yet named 	1 September 2010 		
  API changes finalised, all deprecation wrappers removed, API docs tidied up.


The timing would allow us to have 2.0 ready to make a splash at the
next FOSS4G conference.

Any comments? Does this work for others? Any other major additions
folks think should be in place before QGIS goes out?

I look forward to your feedback,

Regards

Tim

we still have some things to solve in the new labelling; I think of
speed (very low, unacceptable in several cases) and curved labels along
complex lines

I think we should start documenting what is missing from the new
symbology; I do not think we have a complete list yet

For this I think we should get rid of most crashes, still a bit too
frequent.

I think we need more cleanup than new functionalities.

All the best.

Agreed, int to double conversion could be optimal.

What about an approach where the out-of-bound values are assigned the last 
value only if reprojection is used (and if the layer does not have a null 
value)? 

This would be quite similar to your current approach, except that people will 
have the appropriate raster appearance if they don't use reproj. And if they 
do, they have an undesired border, but still the right colors in the raster 
area.

My two cents, from a user perspective.
We're facing this dilemma with Geotools, where reprojected color mapped
rasters (thorugh SLD) result with borders having the lower color from the
SLD rastersymbolizer. This is a big problem for many users, and we have to
reproject the raster before serving it.
It would be very important to be able to manage nodata values for
out-of-border pixels, to be able to manage transparency and avoid those ugly
borders...

+1 very good idea .. I'd like to see more and more plugins getting into 
core (but that also reminds me on the idea of creating an "my own 
toolbox" menu where i can put just the functions (plugins) i need and 
not everything somewhere under "plugins". Someone on the mailinglist 
also wrote something about the idea of consolidating all the menus which 
are dealing with database connections. So a menu and GUI-overhaul would 
be also a good idea

> - capitalise on the bug fixing work of SunilRaj from kCube so that his

+1 (big) bugfixing on some issues is always a good idea


What i'd like to see also in 2.0 is the threading and globe thing as I 
am still in the need of a 3D workflow and have to take a look at my data 
and hoped to see a start in 2.0.
And there are a few other suggestions that would (from my point of view) 
easen the use of qgis .. but thats another discussion somewhere else ..

I like the roadmap .. And I'm curios on 2.0 ;)

Werner

Why do you consider it problematic, because it occupies too much space?
Regarding precision, int to double is OK, I believe, but long to
double is not because double has only 52bits to store mantissa. GDAL
however does not define long,
the longest integer is GDT_Int32

Still the problem remains for projected data.

I think that usually with common data and wider data type like int,
float and double the max value is never used except for some special
values like null. The problem occurs
with shorter types like byte and short. So I suggest:

source_type  -> qgis_type
byte -> byte (if null value is defined) / short (if null value is not defined)
short -> short  (if null value is defined) / int (if null value is not defined)
int -> int, if null value is not defined use max value for null
float -> float, use NaN for null values
double -> double, use NaN for null values

This is still not 100% solution, but it should cover most common cases.
The only code complication is, that we need a new srcDataType()
provider method,
to return the true data source type.

My concern was because of precision. But maybe its safe. Anyway, your 
suggestion below seems good to me.

 Hi,

 I'd rather prefer to have this as a setting somewhere instead of being 
 interrupted in the search by a popup. Just as in web applications, in 
 regular applications popup windows should be avoided, if possible.

 I think this could be a setting/option that should be saved in the 
 project file, either

 * per dataset
 * per column
 * project setting
 * global setting (already possible now)

 In one of the recent check-ins from yesterday or today, J?rgen Fischer 
 added a setting in "Options" --> "General" --> "Representation of NULL 
 values" which allows for arbitrary strings to mean "NULL". One can use 
 NULL in his own language, or as a number -9999, or whatever one likes.

 I think you should use this setting for the NULL searches and don't ask 
 the user each and every time he is searching for NULL. This setting 
 doesn't change frequently, so I think it is ok as a global setting, or 
 maybe also a per project or dataset/column setting which can overwrite 
 the global setting.

 Just my two cents,

 Thanks for working on it!

 Andreas

And the new rasters, of course :) One of the biggest things I'd expect from 
2.0 is better native raster handling.

I agree with Andreas.  Popups are not good for this use case.    I just
think using: column IS NULL is correct for both cases and I think it would
confuse people to make them pick.

I like the idea of having toolsets as a way of decluttering the GUI by
having a toolbox and/or menu of commonly used functions easily
accessible, and the less-commonly used functions moved out of plain
sight. QGIS could come with some pre-defined toolsets, and the user
also has the ability to create their own. Sort of like the
"perspectives" you get in Eclipse or Qt Creator, and also ties in with
the multi-view work that has been done. Indeed, this could possibly be
extended to making the composer a first-class citizen of the GUI
rather than a separate window.
This will help alleviate the problem with a certain SSS (superficially
similar software) that has a vast tree of functions and plugins that
are placed based on the whims of the developer and not the user, thus
justifying the huge training costs to use it... (rant over :)

Like Werner and Anita I've overlooked your entries "threaded rendering, raster 
on the fly projection, 3D globe mode" for 1.7. Hopefully Martin has time for 
this important merge soon!

* Version numbering: In my opinion version 2.0 should not be given from a 
developers point of view (code cleanup, etc.) but from a users point of view 
(new features, new GUI). In that sense 1.7 or 1.8 would deserve the version 
2.0 tag.
* API transition: From a users point of view we should keep compatibility to 
old project files and API calls (plugins!) as long as possible. We should give 
users as much help as possible to migrate their projects and developers to 
migrate their plugins to the 2.0 API. Therefore I would add the following 
points to 1.7:
-New symbology and new labelling used by default
-Deprecate old features (symbology, labelling) and API's

I propose adding a deprecation mechanism, which sends messages to the plugin 
manager. The plugin manager should mark plugins which are not 2.0 compatible 
and collect their deprecation messages. In contrary, C++ plugins will get 
deprecation messages at compile time.
So there would be time to update plugins after 1.7, complete the 
implementation of new symbology and new labelling and implement a migration 
mechanism for old features (good goals for a Hackfest!).

Regards
Pirmin

Ups same sorry from me - I did not read down and overlooked 1.7 and 1.8 
(Where is 1.9?) .. globe and threading were already mentioned ..

but as Pirmin already said - I would condsider switching to 2.0 from a 
User point of view with all those nice new features ..
so putting globe into 1.7 would already make a 2.0 out of it from my 
point of view..

but it's also ok with 1.7 as long as it gets in ;)

 Hi all,

 I like your enthusiasm. However, a release of 2.0 in September at 
 Fossgis, with two additional in between releases, sounds a bit too 
 ambitious to me. Maybe we also shouldn't put too much pressure on us 
 just because the Fossgis conference is happening. There should be a 
 release (maybe 1.8), but it should not be 2.0 in my opinion. Let's save 
 2.0 until it is really ready and of good quality.

 Also, I would prefer fewer, more stable features and bug fixes, over 
 too many new features that aren't ready for the average user. To me the 
 switch to the new labeling and symbology engine is a priority (but there 
 is still a lot of work to do!), as well as the multi-threading branch 
 and the table joins. The new rasters and on-the-fly raster reprojection 
 would also be nice.

 Releasing 2.0 and still no table joins seems to be less than ideal to 
 me and will likely be criticized (e.g. in feature comparisons with other 
 GIS). I'd rather invest more time on the really needed stuff that a 
 basic 2D GIS should deliver, than in 3D. 3D, in my opinion, can wait for 
 2.0 and would then justify the 2.0 release feature wise.

 This is just my opinion as a user/organization who has to rely on QGIS 
 in daily work.

 Thanks to all of you developers for your efforts!

 Andreas

I did change some things in r15054:

[FEATURE] feature form updates:
- make NULL value string representation configurable
- fix feature updates in feature form from attribute table
- add support for NULL values in value maps (comboboxes)
- use layer names instead of ids in drop down list when loading value maps from
  layers.
- support feature form expression fields: line edits on the form which name
  prefix "expr_" are evaluated. Their value is interpreted as field calculator
  string and replaced with the calculated value.
- support search for NULL in attribute table

I originally didn't want to do the last point, but finally couldn't resist.  So
there is now a configurable string representation for null values - default is
"NULL".   By entering "NULL" (w/o the quotes) one can search for null values in
the attribute table.

I didn't realize part of the QGIS Python stuff used QtTest and didn't include QtTest in the Mac QGIS.  I'll have to package an update, watch for it.

It should be part of your PyQt4 installation - how old is that?

Looking at Gatherer.py, it does this:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtXml import *
from PyQt4.QtTest import *

 so it's hard to tell if it does actually use anything from QtTest -
its the unit testing framework. Try deleting the QtTest import line
from that file, and also from GpsDaemon.py, and it might just work.
Possibly the author has just cut n pasted his default boilerplate
Python code for working with Qt.

 Hopefully you've got the rest of the PyQt4 stuff...

 As Paolo suggested, I started a wiki page for problems/missing bits in 
 the new symbology. Please add your issues, so we can get a rather

OK, now I do remember seeing QtTest in the source - only for when tests are enabled in the build, so I won't be packaging an update.  As Barry speculates, it's probably not needed by the plugin, so try deleting that line.

Hi Andreas,
I proposed significant additions to the Rule based Renderer in a patch here:

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222

http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/3222/rule_renderer_patch_on_r15004-symbols_not_merged.diff

Applying this patch would solve several issues, including one you mentioned: "Needs alias columns for the legend".

I just tried to write this on http://www.qgis.org/wiki/ but when I try to create an account, I receive the answer:

"You do not have permission to create this user account, for the following reason:
The action you have requested is limited to users in the group: Administrators."

I also have several comments and ideas for the Rule based Renderer, based on tests to create multiscale world map with OSM data.

All the best,
Mayeul

I'm proposing to insert the table join for version 1.8 into the realease 
timeline (one after the merge of the threading branch).

There is no conflict between 3D and table join, because different developers are 
working on it.

Hi,

I'm not sure if this is out of scope for the new label engine, but it
would anyway be a nice feature:

Make the label text an answer to a SQL question instead of a single
field. In particular, make it possible to form strings from several
fields and fixed strings, e.g.
label = my_first_column + " " + my_second_column.
It should also be possible to add control characters, e.g. "\n".

For the rule-based symbology, make it hierarchical, so that it could
look e.g. like
if my_fist_column = 1
  if my_second_column = 1
  if my_second_column = 2
if my_fist_column = 2
  if my_second_column = 1
  if my_second_column = 2

Controlling e.g. the second rule should make it change in all
appropriate places, e.g. changing the if my_second_column = 1 to 
if my_second_column = 3 should change this on all places.

Cheers,
Robert

 Hi Robert,

 I think what you propose would be very nice to have. Currently I am 
 doing this in a Postgis view.

 Given that we already have the field calculator one could re-use this 
 functionality for this purpose.

 Rule-based renderer and hierarchies: I believe this is already possible 
 with the filter grouping. There is group by scale or group by filter. 
 Does this satisfy your needs?

 Please go ahead and modify the wiki, but also don't forget to open a 
 feature request. If you do a feature request in the bug tracker you can 
 add the corresponding link to the wiki.

 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Nice to hear about the SQL in labeling, that would be a great thing.

Regarding the grouping. The feature now implemented is not quite what I
meant. Now you can group by filter or by scale, I meant that you should
be able to apply two filters in a row. I understand that this might be a
bit tricky to program, but it would be quite nice. I know that one can
achieve the same with the SQL AND today, but this way you get very many
filters (# categories in filter 1 times # categories in filter 2) which
is inconvenient for the user.

Cheers,
Robert

Even tho' I'm not a developer I would chime in with one 
comment, following what you said:

I'd like to see some version be declared "stable".   At this 
point, with the greatly improved maturity of QGIS, I think 
having a recognized stable version is more important than 
additional features. I wish that devs had 5 ? for each time, 
on the maillist there was an answer "You prob has been solved 
in the next version, please upgrade". But that's not the 
answer that users want to read.

The QGIS project doesn't use the "release candidate" naming 
convention. And it seems that as soon as each release comes 
out, it is abandoned by developers, who direct their attention 
to new functionality in the next development version. 
Essentially each and every release is an RC, with fixes always 
being done in next up-coming version.

Isn't it time to have a stable QGIS ? Call it LTS, or stable 
or whatever. But users want to know that it will be supported 
for some time, with *no changes* in the GUI, a well known 
feature set, and including "backporting" of bug fixes, etc. 
Perhaps that should be the goal for 2.0?

Thanks,
Micha

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Highlighting feature with 'Identify' tool
Message-ID: <4D36B8A3.5010102@gista.sk>

Hi,
is there any special reason that after using 'Identify' tool on polygon 
feature, it is highlighted by its outer shape (whole polygon extent 
area) rather than by exact geometry like it is done by 'Select' tool ?

Example:
1. Draw multi-polygon feature containing few holes.
2. Click on polygon using 'Identify' tool. Whole polygon including holes 
is highlighted.
3. Click on polygon using 'Select' tool. Exact polygon shape is 
highlighted (without holes)

I think, current behavior is quite confusing, when You have big 
polygons, containing holes where another polygons exists.

I seams, there is related ticket on this [1].

[1]   http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2190


Thanks

Hi!

You are definitely right!
I agree that we probably should do the same as we did with 1.0 (with 
less success) and call 2.0 a "Long Term release".
Probably we should look at how other projects handle these thing (like 
GRASS or any other software).
But nevertheless first of all there need to be a 2.0 :)
And to be honest I'd like to see all those nice new features (raster 
reprojection, new symbology, labeling, threading, globe) in the 2.0 
otherwise a 2.0 does not make sense to me.
We probably could really put those new things slowly into 1.7/1.8/1.9 
and than have a few RC Releases of 2.0 to clean out most of the bugs and 
than release a 2.0 with long term support.

But remember - we would also need a whole infrastructure for going into 
long term support for 2.0.x. (forum for 2.0.x?, bug reports for 2.0.x) 
which means a lot more work (especially for devs to backport some fixes)

but all in all - i think it was meant to be to have 2.0 as a long 
term/stable version anyway

kind regards

I may be wrong, but given the current pace of development I am rather
skeptical about "long term". Better keep it dynamic than freeze it.
All the best.

1.0 was almost abbandoned in favour of more stable 1.2/1.4.

So I think it will happen when 2.2/2.4 will be out.

If a 2.0 project can be opened with QGIS 2.2, I don't see why I should stay
at 2.0 without all bugfixes of 2.2.

sure - but you are a dev ..
think of a normal user ..
i have a lot of people working here in my company that install a
program and are afraid of going to the next version because "probably
something might not work as expected" or "buttons are placed
elsewhere" ..
I also do not have such problems - but thats because i am used to test
new software every day ..
but i definitely can understand the view of a "normal or new" user ...

It was just the suggestion that we surely should go on with
development but also provide the user with a known interface and a
known version number called "stable"

On the other hand - I can already hear the rants "plugin xxx is not
working in my qgis" when the plugin is meant to run in a higher
version .. but thats one of the things we would have to deal with ..

kind regards

Hi,

I would like to reach the OL overview developer and let him know that
the tool is causing crashes on QGIS trunk/Ubuntu 10.04

When I add a layer, activate the plugin and the when click on "enable
map" qgis crashes with

"Warning: QGraphicsScene::removeItem: cannot remove 0-item
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'QgsCsException'
Aborted"

If I set the project CRS to "google mercator" (before clicking on
"enable map") it works fine.

I'm also concerned that we couldn't keep up our current pace if we need to  
support two versions.

Forum and user mailing list will be flooded with such posts. We'd need a  
really good plugin installer mechanism that informs users about which  
versions are required for a plugin. Of course plugin devs also have to be  
aware of possible problems.

tests run after each nightly build?

you are right, I didn't noticed that the error message was about another

Nevertheless the note stays for the MemoryLayerSaver author.

Hi Massimo

the patch for tabbed interface has a lot of consequences. First of all
it is important to answer what are the use cases for multiple canvases
- what are pros and cons of such interface for both users and
developers. For example, to what degree the individual map canvases
should interact between each other - allow different sets of layers,
allow different symbolization of layers, different projections,
simultaneous editing of one layer in various canvases? From
developer's point of view there are also many questions - should map
canvases share the instances of layers or create duplicates, should a
map tool be bound to one map canvas or handle all existing canvases?

As you probably see, for a different set of use cases the answers
would be different. The patch itself is long and doesn't come with any
overview of the architecture. I would recommend you to start a RFC
which can be discussed and modified to reach the consensus. Anyway a
change like this looks to be more suitable for qgis 2.0 where we will
be able to break API and thus implement things well.

I have the same feelings for the split view modifications. First it's
better to share and talk about the concept of bigger features in order
to have clear way into trunk later.

Regards
Martin

Luiz,

what is the map canvas CRS you have been using? The error message you
got was an unhandled projection exception (impossible to catch in
python). The error suggests that some file that proj4 needs is
missing. However you shouldn't need to init anything. On windows we
explicitly set where the proj4 files should be (see
QgsCoordinateTransform::setFinder).

I think we probably need to step back and think about the development
process we have, if we want to modify it and how we want to name things.
The tricky part with the 1.x series was that a lot of the bug fixes
required changing the API (by addition or modification) and that bug
releases required full reinstalls. So it really didn't make any sense to
'backport' them to 1.0.x as that would require a complete reinstall.

Now GUI changes or significant branch merges might be considered a
different topic. I would tend to agree that minimizing GUI changes could
be a hallmark of a 'stable' release even if all sorts of stuff
underneath changes slightly. What I'm hearing from people, is that bug
fixes even if they tweak the api or require new stuff should be 2.0.x
and that only the merge of new features or major overhauls of UI/Core
components(Like changing save file structure) would earn a 2.x
designation. Under a plan like this we could do RC and when 2.x
finalizes it would be the new 'stable' version.

You can see how this dev model is a bit different than the current.
And to be honest might not work well for this particular project. I've
seen plenty of cases where stuff gets added to the python api to allow
some plugin to happen and that plugin is really useful that most users
want it. Maybe what we should do is maintain a GUI backward
compatibility (toggle to see new/old) so that icons etc only change on
major versions.

As for plugins, we really need to enforce the qgis-minimum version
property as a requirement and encourage plugin testing (maybe
unittests?) against versions it's supposed to work with.

On the Topic of when 2.0, I think a complete list of all things we want
done for 2.0 should be made and the PSC should declare 2.0 when those
are finished (Obviously with some leeway to not get 100% in certain cases).

Maybe how we do it now actually works, and we just need an overhaul of
how we number/explain it to the general users.

Alex

Looks good!

I would probably prefer to have uri "point?...." instead of
"memory?geometry=point&..." since the fact that we are using memory
provider is given as another parameter to the vector layer
constructor, so in future we would save some typing ;-)

Currently I don't really like this idea. It's not usual that data
source URI would change inside the provider, so I would be happy to
keep the current situation. Developers can be advised to use the new
syntax (after all it's less verbose) and we have no problems.

Thanks for providing us with the widget. In case you are going to
further polish it, we could eventually add it to the PyQGIS.

I haven't tried it yet, but looking at the code I would suggest you to
add support also for symbology-ng - it seems that only old symbology
is supported as of now.

Hi Asli,

I don't about usability studies around QGIS. So, if you want to start 
something, you are welcome.

I am sure that such a study would contribute some interesting aspects 
about shortcomings of the existing GUI, or ideas to improve it.

It might have something to do with the fact that you can Identify
multiple layers at the same time, so in that sense the Identify would
include anything in the hole underneath your layer too. Looks like the
ticket you found in trac is the same thing. I suggest you add your
description to provide more details to it.

Hi Martin

On the choice of memory?geometry=point... Vs point?.., at the moment both are supported.  

I guess I lean towards the memory?geometry=... because I think it better follows the natural understanding of a url, in that the path defines the location, and the query string defines attributes.  That said, "memory" is perhaps more properly the authority part of a URL (ie memory://?geometry=point)!

One other point in favour of encoding the geometry type in the query string is that (in principle) the path component of the Url could be tampered with by the code for handling absolute/relative paths when the project is saved/reloaded, whereas the query string should not be.

I'm not strongly attached to either alternative.

On using the provider datasourceUri() rather than caching this in QgsVectorLayer().  It seems to me more logical that the provider owns the Uri by which it can be recreated, and which it understands.  The QgsVectorLayer has no understanding of the Uri - it just passes it through to the provider, so why should it assume it will not change.

In terms of the memory layer URI, even if the layer was set up with the new Uri format, including fields etc, it will not include fields a user may have added or removed manually after creating the layer.   

On setting the delimited text CRS in the plugin user interface.  I chose not to mainly out of laziness/other priorities!  Of course the CRS can still be set through the interface, at least for the layer (rather than the provider).  It remains an option for future implementation :-) 

Cheers
Chris

I think the plugins should have:

1. ReadMe file
  - for instruction for needed packages to be installed to make it run
and where to get it (URL) if needed
  - Minimum QGIS version for the plugin run
  - possible problem
  - python version needed to run
  - mailing list (e.g. QGIS- developer) to post the problem and bugs.
  - how to uninstall / delete the plugin

2. Changelog file
   - for bug fixes and changes for every update
   - credit for patches and testers and ranters

3. HTML file
   - description / induction of the plugin
   - for the help
   - and it should link in the "HELP" Button in the plugin

4. HELP Button for the above reason

6. Email address of the developer
   - for contact and rant directly to the developer.

5. About Form for the plugin with Help Button and email address of the
developer.

I think plugin problems and bugs should be posted in the
QGIS-developer and CC: the developer.

The plugin problem should be posted with "Plugin" as as first part of
the title topic in posting.

e.g.
        Re: Plugin: PostGIS query not working in Windows 7

These suggestions apply to QGIS 1.x and QGIS 2.0.

Thanks.

Martin,

Thank?s for  your message.

I read the source:
http://doc.qgis.org/head/qgscoordinatetransform_8cpp-source.html#l00558

const char *finder( const char *name )
{
  QString proj;
#ifdef WIN32
  proj = QApplication::applicationDirPath()
         + "/share/proj/" + QString( name );
#endif
  return proj.toUtf8();
}

I tested the  value of proj in console:

from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui
print  QtGui.QApplication.applicationDirPath()

The out in my enviroment is
" C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\bin",
for my friend is
"C:/PROGRA~1/QUANTU~2/apps/qgis/bin"

For me, i created and copied directory, from "C:\OSGeo4W\share\proj" to "
C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\bin\share\proj"

With this the problem in windows is resolved.

Need change the  source of path proj in method "const char *finder( const
char *name )" or make the  review where have the first setting the directory
for Proj,
 because, when i still  use the plugin, the directory was setting correct

Regards,
Luiz

Hi all.
I think this is a good source of inspiration.
Does anybody plan to work on PostGIS 3D geom in QGIS?
All the best.

have you already started to create the repository?

Thanks, it makes some sense, but it is not very user friendly behavior.

Hi,

Ok thanks alot. Actually, I aimed to make a usability test for a Gis
software because their interface is generally complex and few usabiliy
studies are made on them. I chose Qgis because it is opensource and
expandable. Also, as far as I understood from user and developer meetings
and these kind of forums, the committee of Qgis is putting emphasize on
developing the software. I made my study and I am finallizing the report
now. I would like to share it with you if possible when I finished.

Asl?

That sounds really great .. If there are some hints for improvement in 
the report I'm sure we'll try to bring it to the current version.

On what version of QGIS is your report based?

It is Qgis 1.6. In the end of the report, there are suggestions that refers
to the cases in the study and for better improvements of them. During the
study, Assoc. Prof. Dr.Kursat Ca??ltay was my advisor. It was just
final homework of a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course, but turned out
to be a nice report I suppose. It is a user-based one.

Actually, I do interface design because of my profession. I work in
Modelling and Simulation Research and Development Center in METU. We do
usability tests on simulator interfaces. But I am doing Phd at Geodetic and
Geographic Information Technologies Division at METU.This time, I wanted
study Gis area.

How do you welcome these kind of research? I know that you have meetings
that developers do presentations and share their report. I can send it here
before or the committee?

Here are some links:

Hi Martin,

right, only old symbology is supported so far.

Sounds great including the widget to PyQGIS, so I need to dive into the
symbology-ng.

Hi

I've try to use Closest Feature Finder plugin and get next error

QGIS version:

Also I get same error with SelectPlus and Interactive Identify plugins.
Seems that this related to the QgsMapTool usage.

 raster? Changing transparency values set the 3 RGB bands to band 1?
Message-ID: <2c42a6173deea1750bc8e7a08284c868@bc-consult.com>



Hi Devs, 

With QGIS 1.7 release r15056 on WinXP Pro. 

I have a
three-band raster (geotiff) loaded and it displays all-right. Then I
open the raster properties window, go to the transparency tab, slide the
transparency ruler and click Apply. The transparency is applied to the
raster but the three bands (R,G,B) are all set to band 1 resulting in a
black&white (grey) raster! 

The same behaviour is observed when I add a
transparent pixel and click Apply... 

Can someone confirm these
behaviours? 

Regards, 

Benoit

Hi,
I have roughly implemented approximate reprojection. It should work
for GDAL and GRASS, I have not tested WMS. Currently it is always
using approximation (even if error is too big).
Rendering with reprojection takes about 5 times more.  You can get
some info about times grepping debug output, e.g.: qgis rp.qgs 2>&1 |
egrep "(time|CPMatrix size)" | sed 's/.*cpp: //'

I have got for example for reprojected raster in raster providers branch:
89: (QgsRasterProjector) CPMatrix size: mCPRows = 5 mCPCols = 9
41: (readBlock) create projector time  (ms): 10
53: (readBlock) read not projected block time  (ms): 24
71: (readBlock) reproject block time  (ms): 1022
1287: (draw) raster draw time (ms): 1446
1287: (draw) raster draw time (ms): 10

the same raster not reprojected in raster providers branch:
1287: (draw) raster draw time (ms): 323

in trunk:
1830: (draw) raster draw time (ms): 689

It is strange that it is slower in trunk.

This is true whether or not I have enabled on the fly reprojection in the project options. In contrast, the same file takes several seconds to load in trunk.

Are you talking about loading the raster first time or about
redrawing? Maybe statistics are not necessarily computed.

Hello,

what is the status of the plugins repository effort?

I had look at the Django powered http://plugins.qgis.org/ and it seems
promising but at the moment, there is no content and it seems
unfinished (and also it is running in DEBUG mode which is strongly
discouraged both for performance and security reasons).

Is there any roadmap to make the site live? I wrote a plugin for
processing of animals radio telemetry data and I would like to share
it with others but I need an easy way to manage the plugin, update it,
etc.

Thanks,

Hi V?clav,

AFAIK the plugins app was already complete at the beginning of december even
if it still needs some testing.

The missing piece was the authentication bridge with OSGEO.

I've seen some recent commits on github so at least somebody is still
working on it:

Hi Devs, 

Forget about my rumblings of yesterday (see below)

The
problem is worse:

- Open a three-band raster into QGIS. It is displayed
OK.
- Open the raster properties window and bang, the three bands (RGB)
are set to Band 1. Resulting in a grey coloured raster if user click
either Apply or OK.

Is that on purpose?

Regards,
Benoit

Original
message:
"""
 With QGIS 1.7 release r15056 on WinXP Pro. 

 I have a
three-band raster (geotiff) loaded and it displays all-right. Then
 I
open the raster properties window, go to the transparency tab, slide

the transparency ruler and click Apply. The transparency is applied to
the
 raster but the three bands (R,G,B) are all set to band 1 resulting
in a
 black&white (grey) raster! 

 The same behaviour is observed when
I add a transparent pixel and click
 Apply... 

 Can someone confirm
these behaviours? 

 Regards, 
 Benoit

I have just discovered something odd: "when I connected QGIS to a SHAPE file that was missing a DBF file it displayed OK but no attributes were displayed".

I missed copying the DBF file along with the rest of the SHAPE file to a folder where I was connecting QGIS to display a file. I didn't realize that the DBF file was missing until I tried doing something with the attributes. Shouldn't QGIS alert me to the fact that the DBF file is missing? I am using QGIS version 1.4 .

AFAIK this is now working. If so, what prevents us from setting

I'was able to login with my osgeo credentials but I couldn't upload a
plugin: it fails with permission denied on the folder where the plugin files
should reside.

Somebody with root access to the server should fix it.

[Errno 13] Permission denied: '********************/qgis/static/packages'

The validation of plugin packages doesn't work properly for all
packages. My plugin that uploads and validates find on the "old" repo
(pyqgis.org) fails on the new site:

File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed archive. 
Cannot find __init__.py in the compressed package: this does not seems a 
valid plugin (I searched for pluginbuilder/Makefile__init__.py)

Looks like it is munging things together that shouldn't be....

I think we should have a bug tracking system for the new site.

Can you send me the plugin package that does not validate ?

The bug tracking component is hub.qgis.org which we plan to make easy to
link in your plugin information on plugins.qgis.org.

You can log in and start tracking bugs whenever you like, we also have
the ability to host git repos linked to the tickets too.

Thanks,
Alex

I have uploaded to the contributed repository a new plugin that allows
you to build a starter QGIS plugin. This plugin will replace the web
tool located at:
   http://pyqgis.org/builder/plugin_builder.py

The plugin can be installed using Plugins -> Fetch Python Plugins...

Make sure you have enabled install of plugins marked experimental.

Testing and feedback are welcomed. The plugin uses the new issue
tracker:
   http://hub.qgis.org/projects/plugin-builder

Hi, All.

This roadmap for integration RoadGraph plugin in to QGIS:

> Release Checklist 1.7 - Not yet named 	1 April 2011
Plugin have advanced export tool. Plugin can find shortest path on polygon layer (eg, the chip move on water)

> Release Checklist 1.8 - Not yet named 	1 July 2011 		
?onstructing graph part is stable and moved to analysis/vector library.
Python plugin developers can use NetworkX ( http://networkx.lanl.gov/ ), C++ plugin developer can use boost graph library ( http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html ).

For demo I write simple plugin. This plugin can be find ?inimum spanning tree.

> Release Checklist 2.0 - Not yet named 	1 September 2010 		
?any tools for network analysis and visualisation.

RoadGraph plugin is a simple and user-friendly plugin for routing. On all steps. 


I think it is optimal and really roadmap. Please comment...

Your plugin loads without errors on my dev environment (I cannot reproduce
the issue).

I will try on the server tomorrow.

In the meantime, I've opened a project on redmine for the django site.

It appears that relying on the 1st item in the zip to always be
packagename.zip just isn't 100% reliable. My metaedit plugin fails that
test in python but is clearly formatted correctly when extracted or
downloaded by qgis. I did test in python by hand too and metaedit/ isn't
in the namelist at all for some reason even though the folder is there
when the package is extracted.

Here are some possible ways to change the validator
namelist[0].split('/') to grab whatever is before the /
or package.split('.') to grab the name of the zip minus the ext
- There are several other ways to do this in python with the os and path
modules, or slicing. The nice part about package.split is that you could
save both the packagename and ext to test if the ext is zip

packagename,ext = package.split('.')

Thanks Alex,

I agree, but this would be a different check:

the intention was to check that *inside* the zip there is a folder with name
= package_name, non to check that the zip file is named package_name.

Perhaps I misunderstood the specs, but I guess that the plugin zip file
could be whatever name we like (for example I name my zipfiles with the
version postfix such as QuickWKT_0.1.zip, QuickWKT_0.2.zip etc. etc.), what
I wanted to check is that inside the zip there is a folder named
package_name (in this example "QuickWKT").


I changed the line to


        # Checks that package_name/__init__.py exists
        namelist = zip.namelist()
        try:
            package_name = namelist[0][:namelist[0].index('/')]
        except:
            raise ValidationError( _("Cannot find a folder inside the
compressed package: this does not seems a valid plugin") )



this should make it more robust

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapCanvas with Dimap data
Message-ID: <4D3DA269.2030603@gmail.com>

Good day

I currently have some QgsRasterLayers without any metadata stored in the 
image file itself. All the metadata (eg: coordinates, rows, columns, 
crs, etc) is stored in an external Dimap (.dim) file. How can a pass 
these coordinates (like the top-left corner of the layer) to 
QgsRasterLayer or QgsMapCanvas so that the work with the real 
coordinates and not the pixel values.

For instance: When I currently load the image, the coordinates QGIS uses 
is the width and height (in pixels) of the image (eg: 800*600). I want 
to adjust these values so that they represent real world coordinates 
(with the metadata from the dim file).

I've found the the QgsRasterViewPort, but it seems like it is not 
possible to set these values through QgsRasterLayer. Any kind of help 
would be appreciated.

Thank you.
John

Thank you for commiting the roadgraph plugin to trunk.

Yes, it will be great to have the routing functionality in the analysis lib 
(and the gui elements in app as discussed).

The role of the boost library is not clear to me. Do you mean that plugin 
developers may use it or do you plan to implement parts of the analysis/vector 
code on top of boost?

I was able to login with OSGEO id and to upload experimental version
of my plugin.

However, the site still claims my plugin is not published and it is
not clear to me, how to publish it. If it requires approval by an
administrator, can you make it clear in the interface so plugin
authors are not confused?

Sure, I've added a warning message when an untrusted user uploads or edit a
plugin.

The whole process is described in the specs:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/PluginRepository

 and here:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

I don't have access admin access to the running site, someone who have this
privileges should approve (give trust) to plugin authors and/or flag other
users as staff so that they can help in the approval process.


Thank you for testing the new plugins app.

Asl?,

If you could, are you able to share it on the mailing lists?  I would really
like to read it and see what you came up with, I think it could be quite
interesting.

Hi Stefan

If the text annotation is selected, you could do this:

selectedItems = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().scene().selectedItems()
for i in range (len(selectedItems)):
	item=qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().scene().removeItem(selectedItems[i])

Regards,
Marco

I recognize that message as coming from GEOS...
someone must be trying to create a LinearRing with
a CoordinateSequence not forming a ring.

In this case you feed the pointer directly to removeItem:

qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().scene().removeItem( pointer )

+1 from me ...
I think its always better to have only ONE good working function than
several approaches that do not work well at all ..
if gdal works well in reading and writing(!!!) dxf i would drop dxf2shp
in favor of gdal ...
BUT that can happen only at that time when every distribution or ships
gdal in a reasonable version (1.7 in this case) which IMHO is not at
this time .. so please postpone that as long as (for my purposes debian)
does not have gdal 1.7 in the main distribution (current stable ships
1.5.2-3).

kind regards
Werner

In deb stable we only have qgis 1.4, so no problem in changing 1.6.
Now gdal 1.8 is out, I do not think we can afford maintaining support
for more than 2 version of all the dependencies.

Hi Paolo

I had the same problem with all Python plug-ins that used their own 
QgsMapCanvas. There were some changes to the map canvas class and the 
appropriate SIP files weren't updated. Here is a link to the ticket I've 
created, it also contains a patch: https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3420

I think Tim applied the patch in the last revision. Basically only the 
following changes:

Add "void paintEvent(QPaintEvent *);" to python->gui->qgsmapcanvas.sip

It fixed things for me, but it would be nice if you could confirm that 
it works. Thanks.

Christoph

Hi All

To summarise the opinions (toungue in cheek here):

- we should wait a long time for 2.0 - like maybe in ten years
- lets release it tomorrow
- september sounds fine

I would like to suggest we head along the path I described, nothing is
cast in stone and come september if everything is not 100% good to go
we obviously won't release until we feel ready to do so. Personally I
am excited about the idea of having another major release and starting
towards making QGIS a mature analytical GIS in the 2.x series
culminating in 3.0, rather than primarily a GIS data browser.

Regarding the idea of long term supported releases, we have tried to
do this before, and variations of stable and unstable release cycles
etc. From past experience my opinion is that we will only be able to
realise that kind of release process when there are a team of QGIS
developers whose time is wholely devoted to maintaining stable
releases and backporting bugfixes from upstream to them. The reality
is that developers (or their sponsors) work on what they need or feel
like and we have no leverage to dictate how they should

spend their time. As such I suggest we continue as we are until such
time that E$RI gives up on that toy GIS of theirs and throws all their
resources into stabilising QGIS LTS releases.

And under Ubuntu today we seemed to find no situation in which it
would actually allow the transform to be carried out...

I can't reproduce either of the bugs (not the bad_alloc() nor the
transform failure). Do you have any specifics?

I believe yes for windows via osgreo4w and for linux in Ubuntu GIS repo.

I see a small test suite. Are the

Not as far as I know. Our test suite still has poor coverage and we
don't have proper automated test system in place yet. Any help in this
regard would be appreciated.

I don't see why not - just bear in mind that different parts of the
site are in various stages of betaness - someonet with somce time to
knock up some nice css for the new planet would be appreciated!

@gary - at the risk of overtaking your domain registration patience,
can you register planet.qgis.org too (if it isnt on you list
already?).

Thanks

What would be really nice too would be to extend out HIG document (at
the bottom of CODING in root of source) to include much more detailed
guidelines on how developers should achieve good usability and
consistent ui.

I too am pleased to hear of your work and look forward to reading your report.

Well you need 'staff' permissions to publish---so I snuck in and gave it
to myself. Also committed a couple of changes to the github repo but
didn't deploy them to the server.

I guess most people would use gdalwarp or similar to assign this info
directly to the image. On the premise that you don't wish to do that,
I suspect that the upcoming merge of the raster projection branch may
be useful to you since it includes support to create new raster
provider types. In the provider definition you should be able to deal
with parsing the dimap file and registering the image internally. Note
I havent tested this so perhaps Radim can comment more usefully.

Hi Paolo, Werner

Additionally to the version consideration, I'd suggest to keep the plugin in 
the source until we have sound feedback from a few dxf powerusers.

Because matching dxf to GIS is difficult (multilayers, labels, different feature 
types can be in one layer). So accessing dxf via OGR in QGIS might not be as 
trivial as it seems. E.g. in QGIS we expect all the features in one layer to 
be of the same shape type.

Regards,
Marco

Yes:

Yes, I admit that I've been in doubt about the specifications and I've
implemented a small variation, the specs say :

"there is always one or more owners for a plugin, any owner of a plugin can
add new people as co-owners. Only owners are allowed to upload new versions,
edit or completely remove a plugin. If the owner of a plugin disappears, a
new owner could be assigned for the plugin by the admins"

I saw a potential contradictory statement because "there is always one or
more owner"  means that cannot happen that  "the owner of a plugin
disappears", at least one should remain. There is also a potential problem
with co-owners excluding the original uploader from owners list.

So, I propose another way: the original author (the user who created the
plugin) is not listed in owners but has always the same privileges of the
(zero or more owners).

I would change the specs to:

"A plugin has always an author and zero or more co-authors. Only the author
or the co-authors are allowed to upload new versions, edit or completely
remove a plugin. Co-authors can be added and deleted by the author or by
other co-authors"

This is how the plugin app currently works, avoiding potential "orphan"
plugins and original authors deleted by co-owners.

I will hide the original uploader from the co-authors/co-owners select to
avoid any confusion (a soft trigger is  already in place to avoid having the
author in owners list, even if it is probably harmless).


Let me know what do you think about this modification.


Thanks

The situation is improved (the layers appear on the mirror), but still
suboptimal (the mirror is much smaller than the main canvad, and not
resizable).
Many thanks.

I never used the DXF support in OGR so far, but I'd expect OGR to present a
layer list (organized by DXF layers and geometry types)  to QGIS from which the
user can choose from.

But I wouldn't opt to drop the dxf2shp plugin - there's more work involved
dropping it, then keeping it. ;)

What exactly is the message you see (verbatim)? Have you tried doing a clean

Hi Paolo,
testing on Debian Squeeze, QGIS r15056M (compiled from original SVN as 
Debian package in clean pbuilder environment).

When opening georeferencer I get following:
Warning: Object::connect: No such signal 
QgsGCPListWidget::replaceDataPoint( QgsGeorefDataPoint*, int ) in 
/tmp/buildd/qgis-1.7.0/src/plugins/georeferencer/qgsgcplistwidget.cpp:70

The layers are not organised by geometry type (this is also true for other OGR 
formats). Maybe, from QGIS side, it needs a similar approach as for the 
PostGIS tables without entries in geometry_columns?

 Hi,

 I agree with Marco and J?rgen. We should still keep the plugin. OGR is 
 getting a lot better for reading dxf, but QGIS is not ready to digest 
 it. And the dxf2shp plugins can split it up to the different geometry 
 types. QGIS, on the other hand just randomly picks the first geometry 
 type it hits, other types are not accessible with the current QGIS OGR 
 file loader.

 As Marco said, QGIS needs to be improved to properly handle dxf reading 
 through OGR, because OGR presents mixed geometries from a single source. 
 Also, QGIS needs to be able to properly handle OGR styling, OGR 
 labeling, block handling, etc.

 My employer invested a couple thousand bucks on improving dxf reading 
 and writing in OGR, but now someone needs to come up with funding of the 
 QGIS part of the dxt reading/writing. The low level infrastructure in 
 OGR should more or less exist now.

Yes, we could allow to set a geometry type and skip all features with a
different geometry type or better return an empty geometry instead - to get the
feature count right.

Or we could extent the layers to have three renderers - one for each geometry
type.  We recently added NoGeometry - so I figure we know where to look now.
That way we could also get rid of that PostGIS filter trick (ugly because you
could remove the filtering subset string).

Whatever it is .. if it helps dxf AND PostGIS it sounds great ..
And if it helps to improve dxf im/export you are my hero (which you 
definitely are already)!

Sounds like a good solution in the longer term. Currently, there are also some 
parts in the edit tools and gui that assumes all the objects have the same 
feature type.

At this moment there is no support to do this neither in raster
providers branch.
All the providers (GDAL,GRASS, WMS) are using a library/service
functions to get
required extent / resolution. I have to check however, if GDAL warp
(used for that in GDAL provider)
is fast enough. If not, we have to return to QgsRasterViewPort, and
that would become
available for all providers.

Hm, thinking again about it and looking at all the editing tools, 
symbolisation dialogs, labeling and plugins, etc. that are based on the 
assumption that a layer has a single geometryType, it seems to me this is 
something for QGIS 3...

Whereas the filter approach for OGR is something that would be includeable 
pretty soon.

Marco

	FOSS4G2011
Message-ID: <4D4099C1.60806@gatewaygeomatics.com>

Hello QGIS community,

Just a quick update that we haven't received any abstracts for QGIS 
workshops or tutorials yet, and the deadline is the 30th.  So please
head to the online form to submit: http://2011.foss4g.org/workshops

Also, an important note is that if your workshop submission is not
accepted as a workshop, it will be considered for as a tutorial instead.

-Workshop Committee FOSS4G2011



**********
Denver, CO, USA. 14 January 2011. The Free and Open Source Software for
Geospatial (FOSS4G) conference is pleased to announce the Call for
Workshops and Tutorials for the 2011 conference, being held September 12
- 16, 2011, in Denver, CO, USA. FOSS4G is the premier international
conference focused on open source geospatial software. Users and
developers are encouraged to present their latest projects and software
to demonstrate the power of open source geospatial solutions through a
series of workshop sessions and tutorial presentations. Sessions may
cover systems that are solely open source, or a combination of open and
closed source solutions.

Workshops
---------

Workshops are 3 hour hands-on experiences with participants following
along with the instructor, working directly with the application under
discussion. All workshop rooms will be equipped a projector, and with
computers for participants to use. Instructors will need to discuss
pre-installation requirements with the Conference Organizing Committee
if required.

Workshops are expected to require considerable effort to create, with
past experience showing that three days of preparation per hour of
presentation are required to produce a high quality workshop.
Additionally you will be expected to develop material for attendees to
take home with them, such as handouts, workbook, CD-ROMs, etc. Due to
the effort involved in producing and presenting a workshop, instructors
will receive a single complimentary registration to the conference for
delivering a workshop.

Tutorials
---------

Tutorials are 90 minute sessions during the regular presentations
portion of the conference. Tutorial rooms will not be equipped with
computers. However, presenters may make use of delegate laptops and the
FOSS4G LiveDVD. Preference will be given to hands-on tutorials. Any
hands-on aspects to a tutorial will be the responsibility of the
presenter and needs to be described in the tutorial description.
Presenters making use of the LiveDVD will be expected to contribute to
testing pre-releases to ensure material and software is properly
installed. To discuss your requirements for LiveDVD, please contact the
LiveDVD community: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Live_GIS_Disc#Contact_Us

Topics of Interest
------------------

All submissions will be considered, but particular interest will be
shown in the following topics:

     * Practical Introductions to FOSS4G software
     * Interoperability / Spatial Data Infrastructure
     * Integration between open and closed source solutions
     * Free and open geospatial data
     * Performance tuning

Application form
----------------

Follow this link to submit your proposals:
http://2011.foss4g.org/workshops Please add a 300 word abstract, in
plain text format (pasting a text with style markup could make the
process fail). The deadline for workshop / tutorial submissions is
January 30.

Communication
-------------

All workshop and tutorial applicants are encouraged to use the workshop
mailing list to ask questions to the workshop committee:
http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/conference-workshops

General FOSS4G 2011 questions and discussion should occur on the main
conference mailing list: http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/foss4g2011

Hi,
Is it possible to convert ArcGIS mxd's to QGIS project files without using
say ArcGIS's ArcPy? Or is ArcPy is the only possible avenue?

No. There is no way you can convert ArcGIS project file (*.mxd) to
QGIS with or without ArcPy.

You just have to add vector layers in QGIS project.

Looks like a proprietary binary format:

http://viswaug.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/deployment-hassles-with-the-black-box-mxd-file-format/

If you have ESRI products then it might be possible to write a simple
Qgis project file containing the layers for all OGR and GDAL layers
(not ESRI geodatabases, of course) but that would require some Arc
programming. WIthout ESRI products you are stuck unless someone can
reverse-engineer the mxd file format, or if the paths to things like
shapefiles and geoTiffs are stored in plain text within the file.

 Could you do this:

    Start ArcGIS, load one shapefile, save the MXD. Add another
shapefile, save as a new MXD. Load a geoTiff. Save as a new MXD. Put
those MXD files somewhere we can download them... I'd like to see how
obfuscated this format really is.

 Qgis project files are of course saved in an open XML format.

We are currently in the phase and design/write an MXD-converter for at
least UMN MapServer Mapfiles. Transforming the result to QGIS
XML-format would then be some sort of finger exercise...

I would love to read more about Barries reverse engeneerings of the
'obfuscated' format.

 All I've discovered at the moment is that if you dump it using
"strings -e l foo.mxd" on a Linux box you can actually see the file
names of shapefiles and geotiffs - they're stored as UTF-16 strings.
But being able to locate where in the whole mush of strings that whizz
past so you could automatically strip them out is another problem.

 If I actually had this problem on a one-off, say someone gave me a
MXD with two layers and the accompanying shapefiles, I'd probably just
do it manually - start Qgis, load two layers. With a hundred layers
I'd probably get the filenames and make a Qgis project file
programmatically. But given that extracting anything other than the
layer file names and ordering (styling, for example) is just about
impossible I'd probably do it from the filenames rather than the MXD
itself. But anyway, for me the break-even point for automating this is
about 20 layers, and that might only happen once in my lifetime...

Hi all

I want to discuss one question about QGIS GUI. There are several
toolbars with buttons in QGIS, some buttons have similar appointment.
For example there are five buttons for adding layers and all this buttons
needs space on toolbar.

What do you think about replacing this buttons (and similar) with one
button with dropdown menu [1] as we already see in Select, Measure
and Annotation tools? This will save some extra space on toolbar.

I think this can be done for add layer buttons in QGIS and export map
buttons in Composer. Also may be for zoom buttons in QGIS

Only 4 icons should ideally be needed :
- vector
- raster
- database
- network

I think it would more efficient to merge the different ui than hiding 
the complexity in a submenu which downgrade the discoverability of 
frequently used features.

We could look to the way R does this. On Windows and Mac(most of the
time) it will pull a binary from the server, on a linux box it will
usually run a compilation for your system and throw an error if you
don't have the build tools installed.

I'm not sure on the particular inner workings but it shouldn't be too
hard to read up on the source of the R command install.packages() for
someone who understands C (Though it might be written in R). We could
always right the tool in python that calls the compiler.

Thanks,
Alex

+1 for grouping the "Add layer" buttons.
-1 for grouping the navigation buttons.

Adding layers is something you don't do very often, while navigation is 
something you do frequently/always. The only button I never use in the 
navigation toolbar is the "Refresh" button. I don't know why this 
buttons exists. If you have to refresh than it is a bug that should be 
fixed. Otherwise this buttons makes no sense.

Talking about reorganizing buttons: wouldn't the two "bookmark 
(show/new)" buttons better belong to the map navigation toolbar than to 
the "Attributes" toolbar?

I agree and disagree. I think we should enable users to customize the
menus as they see fit. If that means offering a collapsed option for
space saving that would be nice, but sometimes you want some very
specific actions.

If we could offer a premade switch from current normal to "optimized for
space", that would be really neat. I wouldn't want to hide important
things from new users though. This might also make netbook and smaller
screen use better.

As for the refresh button, I do use it occasionally, but can't remember
exactly the context. While it would be nice to think we can get all the
render bugs out, there is always a chance of one and a refresh button is
a good way out.

Thanks,
Alex

+1
for add layer and some other section (selection, editing, ...).
I guess it would be better if also the last clicked button (of the
dropdown menu) is always availabale directly (one click) on toolbar.


-1 for navigation button.
They are very useful and two click for ask a pan or zoom seem too much.

The same in my PostGIS PgAdmin plugin which uses similar python code
to "PostGIS manager".

but nothing happens when I click the compute button. Am I missing

I like the idea of grouping "add layer" icons.
Do you remember concept of two general interfaces from hackfest?
1. Normal GUI - for beginners.
2. Advanced GUI - for advanced users (shortcuts), notebooks.

This can be first step. Second could be user customization of advanced GUI.

The Mxd format is more complex then just filenames. As mentioned, there are
styling issues, graphics, projections and custom objects stored to it.

ArcGIS uses a variety of Properties (Key Value pairs) and saves them to each
MXD also. Custom extensions, labelling, ah, my head is hurting already.

I'm not sure if this is such an easy task.

I can provide some MXDs for analysis, just let me know.

Hi Tim.

1. You need to configure the plugin ("Plugins => road graph => settings")

2. "Plugins => road graph => show roads direction" for highlight roads direction. I use this for testing settings.

3. Road graph plugin have problem with tie point to graph. Try for very short path and big scale (e.g. 1:1).

Hi Nathan,

Ok. In two weeks, I am going to finalize and share it on the mailing list.
Thanks for your interest.

Strange.  The nightly build builds fine (both on i386 and amd64):

[...]
-- Installing: /tmp/buildd/qgis-1.7.0+svn15091~lenny1/debian/tmp/usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libogrconverterplugin.so

-- Installing: /tmp/buildd/qgis-1.7.0+svn15091~lenny1/debian/tmp/usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libevis.so
[...]

Looks like the diagramoverlay plugin doesn't get compiled in your build.  Could
you put the complete log somewhere?

 Yeah, I was vainly hoping to find something akin to an XML tag, or
some other obvious marker at the point of listing the layer sources.
No such luck!

Right. We will see what ArcPy is able to do with mxd-files in order to
create an translator. I will let you know in more details later when
the project got started.

AFAICS there are no "real" errors before and the only difference is that you
are building with a new GRASS and GDAL version - but I don't see why that
should affect the diagramoverlay plugin.

Do you run out of disk space by any chance?

I was asked once: does roadgraph plugins read the layer's snap information
from project settings?
Or does it set a topology tolerance or itself?

No, roadgraph plugin don't read snap information. But it is a good idea.
For snap point road graph plugin calculate distance to each line's segment  and select minimum.

What I meant for topology is that one can set a snapping tolerance different
than the snapping tolerance.
For instance, someone would like to snap with 100m so it's easier for the
person to identify the features. But this same person has a pretty well
constrained dataset and it should use topology tolerance of 1m. So sometimes
it's a good thing that the topology tolerance and the snapping tolerance are
not equal.

For topology tolerance I mean the maximum distance between two points for
the system to understand them as one point only.
Usually it depends on the data's mapping scale.
IMHO it would be desirable for roadgraph to use a tolerance for the
endpoints also. This way users could work even with a dataset not so well
built. What do you guys think?
Best regards,
Mauricio de Paulo

Just tested the plugin. I got a (unrelated) std::bad alloc popup at
startup, anc when pressing Calculate on a very simple graph I got:
...
***************** deactivate circulararctool
***************** deactivate modifycirculararctool
Segmentation fault
from kern.log:

Tried twice, same result:

apart from this warning (which shouldn't have any side effects), I haven't
found anything which explains the "bad_alloc" you are getting. I suspect
it is a build issue, or the exception is thrown from somewhere else (e.g.
the plugin loader). 

If you have any new insights into this problem feel free to open a bug report.

cheers,

J?rgen,

What would it take now to have the fix in OSGeo4W QGIS installer too 
(see ticket http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/199)?

I think you're right: I spotted the same popup on another machine,
different plugin (road graph).
Sorry about the noise.

Ok thanks I got it to work after much trial and error to get the start
point to overlap with my road. Snapping in selection of start and end
point would definately prove useful.

Sergey thank you for your contribution - its going to be  a nice new
feature in QGIS!

I believe this problem has been fixed in trunk already (r15075).

Confirmed, it works with r15102.

Hi all,

I would like to thank Nathan Woodrow for his very useful "file browser"
plugin!

Nathan, it will support also rasters?

I noticed also that under Windows the folders are ordered alphabetically
while under linux it seems random.

Other features that would be great to have (and that maybe you have
already planned) are a finder and a filter for files and folders.


thanks!

Thanks for the feedback Giovanni.  Glad you liked it.

Support for rasters should be pretty easy to add, I'll see if I can add
something tonight or tomorrow.

Yeah I didn't notice the sorting difference until I installed it on windows
to test today.  I think I will just sort the list before I add it to the
combo box.

Thanks for the idea for the file search, I'll see what I can come up with.

The node tool is disabled because GPX provider doesn't implement
modification of existing geometries as of now. You can fix this by
implementing vector data provider's changeGeometryValues() method in
GPX provider and adding ChangeGeometries capability.

Hi all.
If I export the shortest path to a new temporary layer, it is saved to
EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 instead of current project projection. I think this
is suboptimal.
Moreover, visually the path does not seem the shortest (but I have to do
more formal testing).
Finally, when saving the image, the red path is not saved.
Sorry for being so boring.
All the best.

yes, something like the filter in your plugin. In this case to allow
show only the files/folders with a certain pattern.

Hi all.
I have seen that the recent rearrangement of vector loading button has
included WMS among the vectors. I think this is inappropriate. I suggest
moving it to a load raster button, or put it together with WFS in a load
web services button. In the first case, WFS could appropriately be moved
to the load vector button.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Known problems with QGIS
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=tP7Q7upwL68CK_rxY4Z_BhrkhM8V0YGi5rURi@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

After an intensive use of QGIS 1.6 (binary installations on linux, MAC
and windows), I've found the
following problems to be of particular operational concern:
1. Histogram tool for raster layers: I think it only works right for
Unsigned Byte images, for sure it is wrong if negative values are
present and it is always
a poor graphic. The histogram is essential for a sounded stretching
(which in turn is essential for good display) and important to
understand the distribution of the variable, the presence of outliers
etc.
2.While 1-Band Raster Color band and Colour Scale Bar go in the right
direction, these type of tools must be integrated in the Properties
dialog. A reasonable key color table should show up by default and
raster layers of qualitative variables (i.e. land cover maps) should
have appropriate tools for being displayed.
3. Vector operations are too slow as soon as layers are moderately complex.
4. Tools for the display of quantitative fields is still insufficient.
Quantiles, natural breaks etc should show on a histogram and the user
should be able of, at least, setting the meaningful min and max values
(these algorithms fail in the presence of outliers) and best being
able to apply interactive fine tuning. Some transformations (i.e.
logarithmic) should be possible without having to actually calculate
the new field.
5. Point sampling tool: this tool should join the attribute table (or
let the user select which fields to keep, or at least keep an ID
field) of the original points layer with the one(s) of the layer(s)
from which the values are to be extracted. Currently the user has to
create an ID for the original point layer and for the resulting  point
layer and then run a join operation (3 more operations). Point
sampling tool is very important to merge information between vector
and raster layers for further analysis.
6. QGIS crashed from time to time (sometimes calculating the
histogram). As crashes were suffered by inexperienced users, I've not
been able to collect detailed information.

RasterCalc has performed very well and has been very useful for
students to understand spectral vegetation indices. An if() operation
is missing but is coming...

I think all these issues have filled tickets, but wanted to list them
together. As browsing the ticket system is kind of complex for
potential new users, we should include a list of Known Problems
including the most important ones in each release. QGIS is good, no
need to hide problems.
Hopefully some of the listed problems will be addressed during the
next hackfest and hopefully I'll be able to attend to help out
somehow.

Thank you all for your work.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimR_RFr+utzkDW+e0SGN_vsXROa1PeDYiMmN3kN@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

I'm developing an application using the QGIS API.

At this point, I need to replicate the QGIS functionality for merging
features in a given layer. I copied some parts of the code from qgisapp.cpp,
but I have some problems.

In short, I receive an abort from the compiler when the method exits at the
point that the QList destructor is called.

Do I have to take special considerations calling this method?


The relevant code is:

    QgsFeatureList featureList = this->currentLayer->selectedFeatures();
//get QList<QgsFeature>

Where this->currentLayer is a QgsVectorLayer.

Thanks.

Hi All,

I have now added raster support for my file browser plugin, should
be upgradeable in the plugin installer as 1.2.  I have given
it limited testing, as I don't have a lot of raster files to test it with.

If you find any bugs don't hesitate to let me know.
