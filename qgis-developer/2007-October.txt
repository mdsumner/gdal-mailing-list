Hi all

Thanks for applying the patch.

A modification in this direction is also in the advanced_editing_branch. It is 
possible to remove the last digitised point with the backspace key with the 
branch code.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

I've applied your patch to SVN trunk (rev 7235), with several modifications:
- changed indentation to meet QGIS guidelines - two spaces instead of a tab
- changed array of points to QList<QgsPoint> as now we use only Qt
containers for public API
- changed getPoints() and getPoint() to return a const reference - no
need to copy the object
- added python bindings

Thanks for the contribution.

Could you tell us more about your plugin? We're always interested in
what ways people use QGIS :-)

In what way should it be updated?

Marco,

This looks good. There are a number these places where computations like 
this can be pulled out of loops to speed things up.

I will make sure these mods get into the raster branch.

A package for Debian Testing Lenny (i386) is apt-gettable at:

http://debian.gfoss.it/

Python binding, Grass, WMS and WFS plugins included. The needed 
sip4-qt3 package is available from the same repository.

Hi Niccolo

Many thanks for this - I will address these things later today. I was
hoping to announce the final release this evening but I'll first look
at your changes and make another set of debs. I tried to tweak the
control and rules files so that we could build packages 'out the box'
on debian etch and ubuntu feisty which is probably the reasone I set
the lower sip requirement.

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OT: qtdesigner problems: generated ui file not
	valid for pyuic4
Message-ID: <5383fa5e0710041329q1fc7c496ja933c3c63fd89e61@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

 Not a qgis question per se but I figured that someone on this list
might have encountered this and/or come up with a solution.

 It appears that designer-qt4 is generating ui files that are not
compatible with pyuic4. I'm using straight ubuntu fiesty packages for
all the qt software.

 Basic problem is that simply opening and saving a ui file in qt
designer (making no changes at all) messes up a previously valid ui
file. The example below shows the details.

Has anyone else encountered this issue on ubuntu? Am I doing something
obviously wrong here? Any ideas on how to fix this?

-----------------------------------------------------
cp mainwindow.ui mainwindow.orig.ui
cp mainwindow_ui.py mainwindow_ui.orig.py
make clean

# generate the python file from the untouched ui file
pyuic4 -d -o mainwindow_ui.py mainwindow.ui
# OK; still runs fine

Hi Matthew

It could be that your PyQt stuff expects e.g. Qt4.2 and you have 4.3.
There have been changes to the ui  format between the two versions
which could concevably cause such issues.

Regards

Tim

That must be it. I've got QTDesigner 4.3.. all qt4.3 libs but pyuic4
is for an earlier version:

 Python User Interface Compiler 4.1 for Qt version 4.2.2, qt

Looks like fiesty users are in a hard spot since they have backported
all the qt4.3 stuff but not the pyqt4-dev-tools

"Never ascribe to malice, that which can be adequately explained by

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Print composer redesign
Message-ID: <255b57430710041941u1f93d1c1n46dad44237cf9df4@mail.gmail.com>

I've been trying to think about an improved design for the print composer.
Currently, there are two major issues: print fidelity and ease of use.
I find the current composer paradigm to be fairly common and intuitive.
Several drawing programs (such as Inkscape or OOo Draw) use this basic GUI
design.  Tim had some other ideas for the GUI design, which I'm also
thinking about.

Most of the printing issues are results of inconsistent scaling between the
screen and the printer (or PDF, which acts the same as a printer).

There are at least four ways I would like to be able to specify sybolology
size:
  -Map units (e.g, 20 meters)
  -Scale-relative paper units (.5mm at 1:15000)
  -Paper units (3mm, regardless of scale)
  -Screen units (5 pixels, regardless of scale)

Right now, only the last one is implemented, so this would probably
represent a major change in the way vector layers are rendered.  I don't
know a lot about this, so I'd especially like some input as to how hard this
would be to implement, and how it would fit in with the rest of QGIS.

Symbols would probably use some type of plugin, which would be able to paint
themselves without being tied to a specific resolution.  Tim has mentioned
preferring to use SVG for all of the symbols.  Unfortunately, SVG doesn't
allow user-defined colors (at least by default; it might be possible to
write code which could re-color an SVG).

The code to render the map would hopefully be exactly the same for the map
canvas and the composer's render and cache modes.  The caller would specify
the size of the device to be painted on, and the map would correctly scale
itself.

Ideally, the cache/render difference would become invisible to the user,
with QGIS automatically updating the cache when something changes.  There
may still need to be a "hard cache" mode for times when rendering a map
takes a very long time.

Many of the usability problems could be fixed by adding more tips to the
user such as tool-dependent cursors and possibly a status bar.   I'd like to
be able to resize the map by dragging the bounding boxes.  More importantly,
the user should be able to redefine the area a map displays.

The current way the scalebar, legend and labels appear as soon as the user
clicks their buttons seems a little goofy.  It might be better to pop up a
dialog with the options, and let the user click ok before creating the item.

Is this reasonable?  Is it doable, and a direction QGIS should go in?  I'll
try to put together an official RFC soon, as I figure out some more details
of how the code will actually work.

Steven

By the way, I've think I've figured out the problem with the map labels not
printing correctly.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear completely
straightforward to solve.

I'm not an expert on how postgis data provider work, I don't know. You
can see the layer extent (with total amount of features) in layer's
properties in metadata tab.

Ummm... does that mean that in 0.8.1 you get some features and in 0.9 you don't?

Probably you should file a ticket for that and attach as much
information as possible - e.g. definition of the table, also data if
possible.

Hi Godofredo,

I noticed that this happens on windows with 0.9. The wms image is only visible 
when panning the map. I'm going to investigate today and eventually fill a 
ticket for that.

Hi Steven,

Thanks for pointing this out. I'm just about to leave for holidays, so I will give my comments and come up with questions in a week.

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] Print composer redesign
 
I've been trying to think about an improved design for the print composer.
Currently, there are two major issues: print fidelity and ease of use.
I find the current composer paradigm to be fairly common and intuitive.
Several drawing programs (such as Inkscape or OOo Draw) use this basic GUI
design.  Tim had some other ideas for the GUI design, which I'm also
thinking about.

Most of the printing issues are results of inconsistent scaling between the
screen and the printer (or PDF, which acts the same as a printer).

There are at least four ways I would like to be able to specify sybolology
size:
  -Map units (e.g, 20 meters)
  -Scale-relative paper units (.5mm at 1:15000)
  -Paper units (3mm, regardless of scale)
  -Screen units (5 pixels, regardless of scale)

Right now, only the last one is implemented, so this would probably
represent a major change in the way vector layers are rendered.  I don't
know a lot about this, so I'd especially like some input as to how hard this
would be to implement, and how it would fit in with the rest of QGIS.

Symbols would probably use some type of plugin, which would be able to paint
themselves without being tied to a specific resolution.  Tim has mentioned
preferring to use SVG for all of the symbols.  Unfortunately, SVG doesn't
allow user-defined colors (at least by default; it might be possible to
write code which could re-color an SVG).

The code to render the map would hopefully be exactly the same for the map
canvas and the composer's render and cache modes.  The caller would specify
the size of the device to be painted on, and the map would correctly scale
itself.

Ideally, the cache/render difference would become invisible to the user,
with QGIS automatically updating the cache when something changes.  There
may still need to be a "hard cache" mode for times when rendering a map
takes a very long time.

Many of the usability problems could be fixed by adding more tips to the
user such as tool-dependent cursors and possibly a status bar.   I'd like to
be able to resize the map by dragging the bounding boxes.  More importantly,
the user should be able to redefine the area a map displays.

The current way the scalebar, legend and labels appear as soon as the user
clicks their buttons seems a little goofy.  It might be better to pop up a
dialog with the options, and let the user click ok before creating the item.

Is this reasonable?  Is it doable, and a direction QGIS should go in?  I'll
try to put together an official RFC soon, as I figure out some more details
of how the code will actually work.

Steven

By the way, I've think I've figured out the problem with the map labels not
printing correctly.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear completely
straightforward to solve.

Hi Gary,
I'm testing the new preview and I found some bugs or defects.
Maybe do you know some of these but I prefered make a complete list.

At the start:
"Couldn't load QGIS bindings.
Python support will be disabled"

At the start:
GRASS missings

The Mapserver exoprt tool (msexport.exe) does not work.

SHAPE EDITING
When I select a digitilized polygon and when I try to add an island QGIS
say to me: "Selected feature is not a multipolygon". Is this function
available ony for PostGis tables?

MAPCOMPOSER
The value of the rappresentative scale is not realistic. The values are
too small.
The SVG creator does not work
It is not possible to choose where the pdf is saved and the created pdf
seems to be damaged.
Bad rendering about points vector.

POSTGIS TABLE EDITING
Trying to edit a a postgis-table, I changed a value in the table but when I click on 'Stop editing' QGIS
say:

The PostgreSQL database returned: ERROR: syntax error at or near "="
LINE 1: UPDATE "public"."rm98_2007_lin" SET ='34455' WHERE "gid"=1
Durante la prova: UPDATE "public"."rm98_2007_lin" SET ='34455' WHERE
"gid"=1

I think the problem is in the double quotes: "public"."rm98_2007_lin".



Thank you very much for your work
Leonardo

Hi Steven

Thanks for a great synopsis. I'm not any expert on SVG, but I believe
the SVG can be dynamically recoloured in a manner similar to using an
external cascading style sheet (css).

http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/themable+SVG+icons?content=17822

I dont know what kind of overhead there is in this and if we find svg
rendering too slow, we may need to reinstate the oversampling and
caching approach that Lars Luthman wrote once.

Regarding user interface issues we did discuss this a bit but for the
benifit of the list I could mention my major desires:

 - map composition integrated into the main window of the application
 - a pallet of map components available in toolbox in a separate tab
(legend one tab, map components other tab)
 - the map composition could be carried out in a separate tab to the
main map canvas tab. I        had some ideas about providing map
composition functionality directly on the canvas for but for now just
using a second tab is probably the more conservative approach
requiring less new code.
 - when dragging items onto the composition area, provide a preview of
the item as you drag it over. Currently you click on a tool and its
not obvious that you need to go and drag a box on the composition area
to place it.

I very much like your idea of using a plugin based approach for
rendering markers since it can allow us to define a number of
different backends to provide markers (truetype, svg, image markers,
qpictures etc).

Best regards

Tim

Hi Leonardo

Its always great to receive feedback. It would be good if you can
collaborate with Tisham who is our 'windows champion'. I am sure he
will appreciate your help in testing and quality control. He makes
regular test builds which I think would be better for you to be
working with as Im not sure how current the build is that you have
been using.

Best regards

Tim

Hi (debian packages maintainers),

looking at the bugs related to python stuff in QGIS I've came across
ticket #779 about the debian package for QGIS 0.9. It should really
have dependency on python-sip4 and python-qt4 ... just wanted to note
it here so that it won't be forgotten in that huge bug queue :-/

I think that's the right way to make QGIS rendering core aware of
different units and thus QgsMapRender could be used for drawing
everywhere in QGIS code - as you know composer doesn't use it since
it's not aware of other that screen units.

We could create a class which will encapsulate different types of
units and provide a simple interface for conversion depending on the
output device.

In my opinion it shouldn't be a tough thing. First it would be good to
modify QgsMapRender to allow scaling of symbols and start using it in
composer. The second step would be implementing the class that would
handle the unit conversions and return correct scales for
QgsMapRender.

Once this is implemented and works well, other changes like renderer
plugins can be added (however support for such plugins would need some
more work).
AFAIK one of the current problems is also that renderers render point
symbols to image instead of leaving them represented as vectors (which
results in poor output quality).

Regards
Martin

J?rgen, thanks for the contribution! And afaik there are two other patches

Hi Steven and Martin,

I also like the idea of converting between different units to make the maps 
look the same on different output devices.

At the very beginning of the point symbol implementation, QPicture (a vector 
format) has been used. It has been replaced by QImage because of performance 
issues and because the Qt3 implementation of QPicture was not very good. I 
don't know what the current status is.

Yes, a RFC would be great.

Hi,

recently I've seen on mailing list and in irc logs that there are some
difficulties with packaging of QGIS with bindings because the bindings
depend on python, sip and pyqt4 which might or might not be on the
user's system, possibly in incompatible versions.

The main problem is that when compiled with python support, QGIS
application links to python library, so if python is not present in
the system QGIS doesn't run. When it's present but pyqt4 is missing,
it will complain at every start...

Since python support is optional in QGIS, I think the best way would
be to produce two different installation packages for windows: with
and without python support.

1. without python: an option for many people who are not interested in
the python stuff, smaller package

2. with python: this package would check for presence of python and
pyqt4 - and if not found, it will offer download and installation of
these pieces of software. once the dependencies are fulfilled, it will
install QGIS with python support.

What do you think?

For next version of QGIS I plan to resolve these problems by moving
all python-related functionality to a plugin, so in case of troubles
just the plugin won't load itself but the rest of QGIS will work well.
I also plan to improve the support by allowing more paths for plugins,
better console and possibly easier plugin installation.

Bye
Martin

I would like to see an RFC on this just so we know what the  
ramifications are. There
is a lot of PyQGIS development going so we should move forward  
carefully.

There is also work under way on the PyQGIS repository for plugins and  
an automatic installer
(discover, download, and install). This is all being done if Python.

Okay, I can prepare RFC for that. But don't be afraid, it won't bring
any changes that would break anything. Basically that will just mean
that some pieces of code will be pushed from qgis app to a plugin and
slightly improved.

Hi Martin,

Spot on what I am planning to do.
http://whatnick.blogspot.com/2007/10/quaternions-embedding-python-and-ju
st.html
Instead of autodownloading the dependencies I can package them in with
the Qgis installer and leave them out if a system installed version is
located, and a Python free version has to be definitely offered.

Any other windows packagers willing to join the effort and make a Python
free version so that I can get the with python one sorted are welcome.

A test version of the repository is here:
http://spatialserver.net:3001/

A script that generates xml from the contents of the plugin database  
is here:
http://spatialserver.net/cgi-bin/pyqgis_plugin.rb

Matthew Perry has written a command line Python script to list the  
plugins
in the repository and also install them by name into a qgis install.  
At present
the script requires hard-coding of the location of the qgis install.  
The installer plugin
will get the location of the app and use it to install.

The only issue is with permissions. Users won't be able to install  
plugins if there
is a system-wide qgis install in say /usr or /usr/local. One thing we  
might want to
consider is having a user plugin directory that allows users to  
install plugins outside
the qgis install. This would require a slight change to the plugin  
manager to make it
search the main plugin dir as well as the user directory.

The alpha plugin installer script can be found at
http://perrygeo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gis-bin/qgis_plugins.py

It does one of two things:
simply parse the xml and list the available plugins
or
grab the zipfile for a specified plugin and install into the plugin directory.

usage would go something like:
 qgis_plugins.py list
 qgis_plugins.py install PluginName

Currently the plugin dir is hardcoded. This could be avoided by
running it as a plugin itself except that it must be run as root when
installing to a system-wide version. Allowing each user to have their
own plugin dir would solve this but I don't know how much that impacts
the existing plugin architecture.

Hi Tisham,

I'm wondering what's the reason of "replacing some PyQt4 binaries with
compatible ones" ...?

You also write that shipping with PyQt4 makes the package very
bloated. Do you include full binary installer from the pyqt download
page (i.e. PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.3.1-1.exe) ? It would suffice to install
just stuff that's in Python's site-packages directory: sip.pyd,
sipconfig.py and the whole PyQt4 dir.

Nice! Do you plan to add there some more features?

What I'm missing there is compatibility information that would state
which interval of QGIS versions is supported (e.g. Firefox extensions
work the same way).
And it would be really nice if it would show download count and user rating :-)

I know.... My preference is to use Firefox-style of plugin
installation - that by default it will install automatically the
plugins in e.g. ~/.qgis/plugins directory. It's simple, it doesn't
need any more permissions and it's acceptable for users.

But besides that I'd like to have support for more custom paths to
plugins specified by users.

It's a nice tool!
When the plugin repository will be mature, we should prepare a GUI for
that in QGIS...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Incremental rendering update
Message-ID: <200710151828.28477.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear qgis devs,

One of the things I miss most in the current qgis version is the incremental 
update of the map when it is rendering. So on a long train journay, I took 
some time to look how this can be restored with minimal changes to the 
sources and the architecture. The source tarball of my experiments can be 
downloaded at:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/qgis_incremental_update.tgz

This is just a 'proof of concept'. If other devs like the approach, I can make 
a branch with these changes and fix remaining bugs.

The principle is that QgsMapCanvas and QgsMapCanvasMap have two methods: One 
that triggers the map rendering and one that just updates the canvas with the 
rendered QImage.
The QgsMapLayers have a signal called 'repaint requested' that is connected 
with the signal 'refresh' of the map canvas. Emiting the 'repaint requested' 
signal calls the method that updates the canvas with the currently rendered 
image, so the maplayer may decide when an update is appropriate.

Zoom and pan actions on the canvas on the other hand trigger the method that 
invokes the rendering process.

I think that this way, it is also possible to have the possibility to stop the 
rendering progress if a huge dataset has been opened. And of course I have 
other ideas in mind like smart zooming or making tiled wms requests (similar 
to the way OpenLayers does it)...

What are your opinions about that? 

Best regards,
Marco

Hi Tisham,

I'm wondering what's the reason of "replacing some PyQt4 binaries with
compatible ones" ...?

You also write that shipping with PyQt4 makes the package very bloated.
Do you include full binary installer from the pyqt download page (i.e.
PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.3.1-1.exe) ? It would suffice to install just stuff
that's in Python's site-packages directory: sip.pyd, sipconfig.py and
the whole PyQt4 dir.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 0.9.0 Final Packaging effort before announcing
	release
Message-ID: <d368056f0710151909r42fd8fa7rdcc4cb25894adbc9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

As I announced a week or two back, 0.9.0 has been tagged and we are
waiting to get some packages made before announcing the release more
broadly. Tisham Dhar has been working extremely hard to get the win
packaging + python issues sorted out and we expect final win packages
to be available tomorrow. I have made packages for ubuntu feisty and
gutsy (for early adopters) which are available here:

http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/

I would be most grateful if any feisty and gutsy users out there could
test for me before i move them onto the main upload site. I should
hopefully have etch packages available tomorrow. Check the same url
above to see if they are available yet.

Tom - do you think you will be able to make an 'all in one'
application bundle for us again?

Anyone else who is able to contribute packages, your work will be
greatly appreciated!

Best regards

Hi:
    The ogr plugin is in a very early stage, in fact I?m doing some refactoring
to integrate the dialogs of postgis with the dialogs of ogr to improve accesability.

At this stage I have only tested access to mysql and postgresql and opened a
branch https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/ogr-plugin-branch to work on
it.

  I think it could be possible to check oracle access and share my binaries with you
if you are using windows, but this could take some weeks.

Best regards

Hi Marco,

I've took a look at the code and tested a bit, here are my notes:

- I remember that after Qt4 port Tom disabled processEvents() calls
during the rendering due because they were producing UI problems and
even crashes... now it seems that it works again (Qt4.2.3 here) - or
did you have to do something special to avoid those troubles?

- I've noticed you've disabled usage of QPixmap in QgsMapCanvasMap ...
was there any particular reason for that or just because of being a
proof of concept?

- the usual purpose of layer's repaintRequested signal is different -
it's emitted when the layer thinks it should be re-rendered, while you
use it to signal that there is some progress in drawing...

- if I understand it correctly, QgsMapCanvas::refresh() has changed
its semantics from being trigger of rendering to just being updater of
the drawn map. Some of the refresh() calls have been changed to
drawIncrementally() and some not, which produces some bugs when
working with the map canvas. (wouldn't it be better to preserve
original meaning of refresh() function?)

- raster layers could also do some updates during rendering...

- an important thing what's missing so far is lack of mechanism which
would stop rendering - e.g. when you hit escape key or when you move
the map it should stop   and start rendering again

But after all I'm happy to see that we can allow some level of
concurrency while rendering even without the need to use threading...
Nice work!

Martin

Try adding the backports repository which should have qt4.3 :

deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-backports main
restricted universe multiverse

Keep in mind that the recent pyqt-dev-tools (pyuic, etc) have not been
backported to feisty so if you're planning on doing any gui
development work with python and qt, you'll have to tread carefully.

Thanks, I'll give it a try when i have a chance.

I was wondering if a little more information could be added to the
README.txt @ http://qgis.org/uploadfiles/testbuilds/?  Knowing what to
expect, i.e. requirements, would be nice.

Hi

Actually it should install without backports (but as mentioned python
may present you issues). I'll tweak the packages and make a new set
available if you would be so kind as to test again.

Hi

Ill test the patch on mac and see if it presents any issues with
processEvents() calls.

No, it just worked (qt4.3). Maybe the problem was only on Mac?

Yes, it was just the quick and dirty way. I think it is possible to keep the QPixmap and to convert to image when doing a screen refresh.

That's a good point. It would probably be better to make a switch into refresh() function that calls QgsMapCanvasMap::update() if canvas is not dirty and QgsMapCanvasMap::render() if dirty.

The repaintRequested signal is still emitted when the layer thinks it should be re-rendered. Maybe you mean the signal 'drawingProgress'? It is emitted in the same place (also before my changes). I think the reason for this is more of practical nature in that it is the place where qApp->processEvents() is done and so a progress bar would have the change to update.

Yes, that is still to do. The way this has been done in the qt3 times was to set QgsMapLayer::mDrawingIsCancelled to true for all the layers. We could do the same to stop rendering. Althought it is not very nice to have QgsMapLayer::mDrawingIsCancelled member, as it does not represent a real maplayer property.

Good point. What do you think should be the policy for a raster layers to update? In fixed Intervals, e.g. once in the middle of the image or in fixed time intervals?

I'm going to make a branch for this so that we may also test on different platforms. I have an old G4 mac in my office, so I'll be able to test on Linux, Mac and W32.

Hi All,

Latest windows installer is here:
http://whatnick.dyndns.org:8080/tisham/qgis_setup0.9.0.17_10_2007.exe

It features bundled Python25.dll-Sip and PyQt4, so the users can install
without downloading anything else. Since Python is the big new feature
in 0.9.0 I hope this installer will become accepted with only minor
changes. Making a Python free one will be a bit more copy pasting and
rebuilding, I don't want to do make it unless it is really necessary.

For anyone interested in GML, I finally have Xerces working in
Mingw-linked statically to gdal. I will make a new installer featuring
that once I have some time.

Please give me some feedback.

I remember it was doing problems and crashes also on my linux box.

We should probably investigate what's better - whether to render to
QImage and then pay for the conversion to QPixmap or whether to draw
directly to QPixmap. From my tests some time ago I've noticed that
drawing to QImage is faster, however with some older qt4 versions
(surely all qt4.1.x) rendering to QImage wasn't without bugs... maybe
it's better with qt4.2 and qt4.3.

Yes, I would prefer this.

I think the reason for this is more of practical nature in that it is the place where qApp->processEvents() is done and so a progress bar would have the change to update.

As you write "repainRequested signal is still emitted when the layer
thinks it should be re-rendered" - I think that's the problem - when
that signal is used to signal both need to re-render and to signal
need to just update the image in canvas... do I make sense?

Althought it is not very nice to have QgsMapLayer::mDrawingIsCancelled member, as it does not represent a real maplayer property.

I think that would be really bad to use a member like
"mDrawingIsCancelled" again. What sounds more reasonable to me is to
create a class called e.g. QgsRenderContext which will contain all
information about rendering that we now pass to draw() functions as
arguments. Moreover it could get also the information about whether
the drawing should continue. QgsMapRender or QgsMapCanvas would store
reference to this context, so they could modify the context to tell
the layers to stop rendering. How does it sound to you?

Probably it would be better to update the layer after some time
intervals (e.g. every 1/2 second) to save some cpu time.

Hi

I am in agreement with you - I think the added bundle size probably
wont deter the majority of users and the convenience of having
everything 'just work' will be a big advantage. I think we shoud avoid
at all costs maintining two versions of the installer since inevitably
it will become burdensome and one of th installers will achieve poor
relation status...

Great work! I will try to install it on a virgen xp image tomorrow and
then go ahead and start announcing the release more widely.

Best regards

Tim

Hi Martin,

>I remember it was doing problems and crashes also on my linux box.

Ok, in this case it is possible we will have similar problems again. I'll do some tests about that. Also some sections of code need to be protected, e.g. the 'open table' button and the info tool may only be called if the canvas is not rendering. Maybe there are others.

Yes, we need to investigate that again. If QPixmap or QImage is faster may also depend on the hardware, as pixmap renders on the graphic card and image on the processor. On my computer, I have the impression that drawing to QPixmap is faster. But does QPixmap already provide antialiasing on X11? Because until now, I preferred QImage because of the nice antialiasing.

Ah, I see what you mean. Afaik at the moment, only the need for a screen update is signaled with 'repaintRequested'. Maybe we need a different name for the signal, like 'screenUpdateRequested'. The need to re-rendering would occure if something in the layer has changed, e.g. an editing action or maybe a symbology change, right? At the moment, the dialogs trigger a complete canvas re-rendering in these cases. Do you think it would be good to have a dedicated signal for this and to trigger the update from within the maplayer?

And a reference to the rendering context would be passed to the draw() methods of maplayers? Sounds good to me at first glance.

Makes sense. I just need to check what the most efficient solution is to insert the time query into raster layer code. Because calling functions in the pixel loops could be slow.

We should probably investigate what's better - whether to render to
QImage and then pay for the conversion to QPixmap or whether to draw
directly to QPixmap. From my tests some time ago I've noticed that
drawing to QImage is faster, however with some older qt4 versions
(surely all qt4.1.x) rendering to QImage wasn't without bugs... maybe
it's better with qt4.2 and qt4.3.

Yes, I would prefer this.

I think the reason for this is more of practical nature in that it is the place where qApp->processEvents() is done and so a progress bar would have the change to update.

As you write "repainRequested signal is still emitted when the layer
thinks it should be re-rendered" - I think that's the problem - when
that signal is used to signal both need to re-render and to signal
need to just update the image in canvas... do I make sense?

Althought it is not very nice to have QgsMapLayer::mDrawingIsCancelled member, as it does not represent a real maplayer property.

I think that would be really bad to use a member like
"mDrawingIsCancelled" again. What sounds more reasonable to me is to
create a class called e.g. QgsRenderContext which will contain all
information about rendering that we now pass to draw() functions as

Probably it would be better to update the layer after some time
intervals (e.g. every 1/2 second) to save some cpu time.

It is possible to add multiple tables from one database by selecting and 
holding the ctrl key pressed. Or do you mean to add layers from multiple 
databases with one dialog? If yes, how do you intend to change the gui 
elements in the dialog?

>What do you think about this change, or it could be better to add the code to

Maybe QgsDbSourceSelect should just give back a list of urls and provider 
strings and QgisApp::addDatabaseLayer() just create the vector layers with 
this information. That way, the assembly of the database urls for postgres- 
or ogr-database layers could happen inside QGgsDbSourceSelect class. Does 
that make sense?

                Hi:

I'm working with  QGgsDbSourceSelect dialog to unify access to spatial tables 
(ogr and postgres). 
The  layers are added in  QgisApp::addDatabaseLayer(), thinking in usability  
it will be better if we
could add multiple  database  layers  without needing to close and reopen  
QGgsDbSourceSelect,
but this needs that the calls of  QgsVectorLayer and  
QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(layer);
have done from QGgsDbSourceSelect instead of  QgisApp::addDatabaseLayer().

What do you think about this change, or it could be better to add the code to 
manage ogr database layers
in  QgisApp::addDatabaseLayer()?

I was thinking to create the selected layers of one database when pressing the
add button in QGgsDbSourceSelect. Because the gui elements of dialog will be
the same to postgres databases and ogr databases, I was also thinking in add
a disconnect button to  close the actual connection being able to choose another
connection, maybe of different type and populate again the list of tables, being
possible to add another set of tables without closing the dialog.

This is the how postgres vector is added actually.

Hm, but if a user just adds layers from one database, he needs to press the close button for the dialog to disappear? In my opinion, it gets less usable for the case where only one database is added. And the one database case happens probably more often than the several database case. Also, it would not be consistent with the behaviour of the dialogs to add ogr file layers and raster layers any more. I'm therefore in favour to keep the current behaviour of the database dialog that disappears after adding layers from one database. 

>This is the how postgres vector is added actually.

Currently, postgres provider is hardcoded in QGisApp::addDatabaseLayer instead taken from the dialog. But yes, it is similar to current situation.

Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] usability enhancements for georeferencer plugin
Message-ID: <200710201612.01536.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Hi devs,

I made some usability enhancements to the georeferencer for a project where it 
was important to georeference a large number of image files after each other. 
For this task, it is not very convenient to always arrange georef point 
dialog and qgis main window for each image. Therefore one of the changes is 
that the dialog to enter the referenced points is always open. Also, there is 
a button that automatically arranges qgis main window and the two 
georeferencer dialogs on one screen. To save space, the description has been 
moved into a separate dialog.

This changes have been done for qgis 0.8.1 at first. I ported them to the 
current developer version and incorporated the few changes that have been 
made in georeferencer 0.9. You'll find the tarball on:
http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/georeferencer.tgz

Please have a look at the modified plugin and tell me if you like to have 
those changes in svn. If yes, I'm gonna commit to the repository.

Best regards,
Marco

Marco,
 i have tested your code and it looks very good. 
 Is it difficult to add a widget  for selecting the GCP and target 
 layer projection ? Right now i'm forced to use
 gdal_translate and gdalwarp to create a geotiff using
 the saved GCPs.

Hi Folks

So Ive been chatting to Markus Neteler (GRASS Guru :-) on irc and he
would like to coordinate with us a little before we make press
announcements for 0.9 release. In particular they are about to release
6.3rc1 of GRASS and he is hoping we could include at least GRASS
6.3rc1 in the windows and GRASS binaries that we give people. Markus
can give more details and is available to help if you have further
queries, but you you guys (Tisham and William) mind generating updated
packages to use the version suggested by Markus before we go ahead
with press releases?

I am also standing by for Otto to give the green flag with the
documentation - hes been doing some awesome work to give QGIS some top
notch documentation (including now also Garys great tutorial from teh
FOSS4G 2007 conference, and our new unified install guide document).

I expect to start sending out press announcements later this week
barring any further packaging issues.

Best regards

Message-ID: <FBBC9E7EF265584EA4C5D5264633371904106ED7@whitebeam.ads.ntu.ac.uk>

Hi,



I have a QGis::WKBPoint based vector layer containing a single feature.

I want to change the position of the feature using a single click of a button embedded in the tool bar.

I have unsuccessfully tried to change the position using the following:





void QgisApp::trackWayPoint()

{



   ...

   ...



   QgsFeature *feature = pointLayer->getFirstFeature(true,false);

   QgsGeometry *geometry = feature->geometry();



   unsigned char *wkb = geometry->wkbBuffer();



   memcpy(&wkb[5], &newPosX, sizeof(double));

   memcpy(&wkb[5]+sizeof(double), &newPosY, sizeof(double));



}







The correct feature and geometry are referenced however for some reason the new position is lost before the feature is drawn to screen.

I have also tried commitAttributeChanges(const std::set<QString>& deleted, ... ,std::map<QString,QString> >& changed); without success.



Please tell me how I can change the position of a feature?



Thanks Roger

I missed to save the sizetype field in the project.  Attached an updated
patch.

Hi:

This change was to add the ability to create mysql, oracle and postgres vector layers
via ogr provider, the other changes were in the "add postgis layer dialog" that now 
support different kinds of connections in addition to postgres. The new classes in
core/dbutilities are used to separate connection management from the dialogs and
that will be used to update SPIT to work with  mysql, and oracle.

There are some plans to support layer creation, and Tim suggested to work a little
with QgsVectorWriter to support some kind of export functionality, but I think this will
be until second stage (once ogr spatial database layer creation and spit will be working ).  

Regars

Godofredo,

Thanks for claryfying this. I'm eager to see QGIS able to
create new Postgis layers in future.

Hi Roger

Which provider and data format are you using? Not all formats support
write operations. I suspect you need to indicate to the layer that
editing is started and then commit your changes when editing is done.
Take a look at the code behind the start and stop editing options in
the legend it may give you some hints.

Regards

Tim

Hi 

Yes, it is applied now.

Btw, I noticed that in the labels dialog there is a transparency slider which 
is disabled. Is it planned to support (global) transparency for labels soon? 
If not, I think it is better to remove the slider and spin box from the 
dialog. A user might think that transparency is supported and he just needs 
to change some other settings.

Regards,
Marco

AFAIK it supports antialiasing, however drawing to QPixmap with
antialiasing was much slower than antialiasing with QImage.

The need to re-rendering would occure if something in the layer has changed, e.g. an editing action or maybe a symbology change, right?

Yes, that was my point.

I would prefer to put such signal to the rendering context class, it
would be a bit cleaner.

Yes, that's my idea.

Hi Godofredo,

when briefly looking at your changes I have some notes:
- it seems that QgsURIManager class does pretty much the same as
QgsDataSourceURI class which is already a part of core library
- you've introduced postresql dependency to core library - this is not
a good thing. One solution could be to make this dependency optional,
however I would prefer to move all postgres-related code to provider
or some other, more appropriate place.

Bye
Martin

Hi Oleg,

I think it would be possible to add a project selector to convert the ground 
points to another CRS before referencing. Is that what you meant?

Ideally, the referencer would just take the canvas coordinate system. But I 
understand that it is not possible if the layer in the map is a raster and 
therefore cannot be reprojected to a different CRS on the fly.

Regards,
Marco

Yes, one may have to deal with the three CRS instances during georeferencing:
the CRS of GCPs (inherited from a map or chosen manually), the CRS of
the referenced image (metric or latlong) and the target CRS (the project CRS).

Hi Martin:

I checked QgsDataSourceUri and in fact it does almost the same
the QgsURIManager. To use it I need to add the type parameter
and add some methods. Do you think this could be possible?
QgsDataSourceUri is used only in postgres datasources?

Yes, no problem to add some more methods there.

Right, so far it has been used only with postgres.

first, it seems that you're using qgis 0.8.x to do development... I
strongly advise you to use 0.9 for new development. Some parts of API
has been changed (improved).

second, what your code does is that it simply modifies the local copy
of geometry, it definitely will not change the geometry. To modify
geometry you should get layer's provider and call its
changeGeometryValues() function. Not all providers support
modifications of the geometries, to find out whether it's possible use
provider's capabilities() function in where ChangeGeometries flag must
be set.

Hi qgis developers:
 
What do you think about having a generic ogr connection(let the user specify the URI manually)?
 
if you think this is a good idea, how should be addresed? a new dialog? or in qgsdbsourceselect?

Hi Perrygeo,

A flexible solution for color ramps as you describe it in ticket 782 would be 
a really great enhancement for qgis. 

>The remaining questions are:

Registered ramps could be stored in a dedicated directory under share/qgis, 
similar to the way it is done with the svg markers.

Hopefully you can find a good storage format for the ramps. If there is no 
format that meets all your requirements, you could still design your own xml 
based language  (crml = color ramp markup language)

Regards,
Marco

Developers,

I am currently working on refactoring the raster layer and have hit a 
brick wall with trying to generate a SIP file for on of the new classes.

The basic SIP layout I have figured out by looking at the other SIP 
files, but I am running into problems referencing GDAL enums. I need 
access to GDALDataType, which is in gdal.h. Do I need to make another 
SIP file for gdal.h?

Can one of you python gurus give me a gentle kick in the right direction?

Thanks in advance,

Hi Peter,

I'm glad to see that you're trying to keep bindings up-to-date :)

In this case I see several possibilities:
- do not wrap functions which need some external classes/enums
- wrap also that enum in a sip file
- replace that enum with some native qgis enum, use that one in functions

I would prefer the last option as it is the cleanest one. It's better
to have own types in public API instead of types of some 3rd party
tools / libraries. Moreover I think that what we would like to reach
in future is that raster layers implementation would be independent
from GDAL, so using own data type makes sense...

In case of some more troubles with SIP files don't hesitate to write again!

Bye
Martin

Hi,

GDAL already uses swig ngpython bindings, can't you reuse those ? There
is a gdalconst.py generated by swig which contains the enums.

Hi Tisham,

I don't think this would be a good idea. First, we would introduce
dependency on GDAL python bindings. Second, and more importantly,
there seems to be a technical barrier - I have no idea how to connect
SIP and SWIG bindings. SIP must have complete information about the
types it uses, in this case it doesn't know what's the relation
between gdal headers and gdalconst.py.

Tisham,

Dropping my 5 euro cents, I agree with Martin it's not a good idea as it
would be like reinventing the wheel. It's not a trivial taskand it took
a *lot* of time to achieve current state of Python bindings for GDAL.

The work was started 2.5 years ago by Kevin Ruland and then was taken
over by Howard Butler (hobu) who spend number of months this year to
bring the GDAL Python bindings stable and usable.

I don't really see #1 as an medium to long term option. From a python 
perspective it would kind of defeat the purpose of this initial 
refactoring. So I figured I would just try to tackle this issue from the 
start.

I had thought of this last option already and think that looks like the 
better way to go for the time being. I know that GDAL has python 
bindings, but a bit of searching did not end in any information about 
how to use SWIG and SIP together ( I think this is mentioned in a few 
e-mails that followed your initial reponse).

As for not relying on 3rd party tools / libraries, I can only agree with 
this to a point. I think that 3rd party library should be very very 
carefully consider before being used and becoming a dependency. If there 
are only a few methods or the methods are simple enough then yes, they 
should be written natively in QGIS. Otherwise, if the library is well 
written, extensive, well established, and actively being develop, then I 
don't see there being such an issue leveraging that library. If the 
developer pool were to be large enough in the future, then total 
independence could be a long term goal.

Thanks again, I am sure I will have other SIP questions to pass your way!

It is not clear to me what you mean with 'CRS of the referenced image'. Isn't that unknown in the normal case? After referencing, the image has the CRS of the control points. I'm not an expert in image processing, maybe you could give a more detailed description of your working process.

Hi Marco,

 you are right, but such general approach may have bad side effects.
 If the referenced images are in a local metric coordinate system
 (for example transverse mercator) and the GCPs are longlat WGS84
 taken from GPS, then one usually don't want to create the georeferenced
 longlat WGS84 raster. At our latitudes it leads to a 1:2 pixel distortion.

 Oleg.

This looks like a bug which was reported for Mac OS X a while ago. I 
have a patch which is essentially complete but I don't have the 
capability to build QGIS for Windows. If you or someone else can do a 
source build, I would be interested in finding out if the patch fixes 
your problem.

The patch currently has two deficiencies which probably don't affect you:
1.) errors are not reported until one or two refreshes later.
2.) the indirection code for layers which return urls instead of bitmaps 
has not been tested.

The refresh problem arises from the fact that the WMS layer is not 
requested until after the redraw cycle begins. Om a Mac (and probbably 
Windows too, based upon your observations), drawing cannot be 
interrupted to do something else -- either you already possess the 
bitmap or you don't start drawing. The reason you don't see the image 
until some future action is that the WMS image don't show up until after 
the refresh cycle that requested it has competed.

> On an Ubuntu machine with the debian binary (Thanks to Jachym Cepicky!),

The reason it works using Ubuntu is that X11 was designed as a 
client/server display system. Since the display doesn't need to be on 
the same machine as the application, X11 is most likely not confounded 
by network requests inside draw events.

The fix I made is to remove the synchronous network request inside the 
draw event with async requests which must be completed before starting 
to draw. This also speeds things up for multiple WMS layers since all 
layers are requested in parallel rather than serially.

> BTW, displaying layers using the WFS plugin from the same server works 
> well on both systems.

The WFS plugin doesn't make network requests inside draw events so the 
problem doesn't happen for WFS.

One further request from readers: does anyone know of a WMS server that 
returns an indirect pointer rather then a bitmap? The main reason I 
haven't submitted this patch previously is that I haven't been able to 
test that situation. Alternatively, I could add a message "Indirect 
retrieval temporarily disabled: send a url if you would like this 
feature back."

I did basically the same today, but I was still looking for a clean way
trigger a refresh after the WMS request completes inside the provider.

Ok, I see. So the user should have the possibility to specify source CRS of control points and target CRS of control points (which would then be the CRS of the referenced image). I think that can be done quite quickly. I'm going to make an enhancement entry in the bugtracker for this.

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  GDAL Python Bindings
Message-ID: <4728ACEE.5040504@noaa.gov>

Hi folks,

Sorry for the cross-post, but it seemed topical to both qgis and gdal.

Martin Dobias wrote:

Well, there is a dependency on GDAL already, so why not the bindings?

I really think it is better for the GDAL user community as a whole to 
work to improve one set of bindings for GDAL, rather than have multiple 
sets.

 > Second, and more importantly,
 > there seems to be a technical barrier - I have no idea how to connect
 > SIP and SWIG bindings.

What are the barriers exactly? I now nothing of SIP, and a little about 
SWIG. However, I think the key is to use Python as the intermediary, and 
not try to have SIP types dealing directly with GDAL C stuff. To do this 
efficiently, there may be a need to add a thing or two to the GDAL SWIG 
bindings and the Qgis bindings.

In particular, thinking about a raster band, it could be a pretty good 
sized bock of data, so we'd want a way to get a GDAL raster band into 
whatever type you need for QGIS without a whole lot of data copying. By 
default, we might end up with:

gdal generates a raster band. (first copy)
it is converted to a Python string (two copies)
it is converted to a QGIS raster band equivelent (three copies)

It would be nice to just allocate the memory in GDAl, and pass that 
pointer through to whatever the QGIS type is. The way to do that is to 
use the Python buffer protocol, or even better the new nd-array protocol 
introduced by numpy, and slated for inclusion in future pythons:

http://numpy.scipy.org/array_interface.shtml

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/

I'm hoping to add this support to the GDAL bindings anyway, for 
efficient transfer to/from numpy arrays.

By the way, does pyQt and/or Qgis support numpy arrays at all now?

-Chris

I just tested the Feisty packages from  http://download.qgis.org, and
I'm having problems with deps.  I did a fresh "apt-get update; apt-get

dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libqgis1:
 libqgis1 depends on libqt4-core (>= 4.3.0); however:
  Version of libqt4-core on system is 4.2.3-0ubuntu3.
 etc...

After some research, I successfully installed the reqs using feisty-backports

There's a good discussion of backports ( and pinning to limit
backports to packages of one's choice while gutsy settles down) here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports

Perhaps the requirement of feisty-backports along with this link could

Hi Christian

Thanks I thought I had fixed this :-( Yes using backports is a good
way to fix for now. Gary could you add a small note next to the feisty
download saying

"Please enable backports
(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports) to satisfy
dependencies."


Ill try to fix this in the upcoming 0.9.1 bugfix release.

Regards

Tim

Hi Godofredo

Do you mean for file based datasources and db based one? It would
certainly be nice to combine them all in one dialog if we could find a
way to keep it user friendly...

Regards

Hi

Was anyone able to test Toms patch? Can we go ahead and apply it to
trunk? We would like to do a follow up release of QGIS 0.9.1 in the
next few days - in particular to provide updated binaries to address
some GRASS issues Martin fixed, and to provide a Toms WMS fix.

Best regards

Tim

Hi Paolo

So Ive updated all open bugs to 0.9.1 using some sql update query -
will be good to see if anything got missed. I've also added a new
convenience link to the front of the wiki that takes you to the 0.9.1
queue. I'm guessing we will be doing it all again in a week or so if
we get a short sharp 0.9.1 release out - I'm just waiting to see if
the WMS patch is ok to be appled.

I was going to suggest for 0.9.2 that we try to get developers and
contributors (those wiling to participate anyway...) to all try to
kill 5 or 10 bugs each - which would make a nice dent in our bug
queue. We could have like a month wndow for that bug killing spree
then do a 0.9.2. After that we can start bringing in things from
branches on a selective basis.

Any assistance on the bug queue to identify duplicates and already
fixed issues will always be appreciated.

Best regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] color ramps for vector graduated symbols

Hi

Are you guys familiar with MatLab? I was hoping we could at some point
implement a colour ramp editor similar to what they have. Also, it
would be great to include Peter Ersts (Raster maintainer) in this
process so we could use the same markup system in both raster and
vector implementations (where applicable).

The MatLab colour map editor is show here (scroll down a little for a screenie):
