Hi Gary

Seems the form annotation is broken in 1.7.1 and also in master. I'm opening a 
ticket.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <4EAFB994.2020205@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
If a projection is incorrectly applied, one can ge errors of the type:

trasformazione inversa di
(-2.54795e+06, 5.04052e+06)

fallito con errore: latitude or longitude exceeded limits

I think this is repeated once for every vertex, making it impossible to use QGIS any
longer (it has to be killed).
I think a button "Ignore all" should be added.
Thoughts?
All the best.

PS
If you want to exit this "loop" without killing qgis just drag the
warning windows outside the canvas, then click "ok" and without passing
the mouse of the canvas, open the project properties and enabale OTFR or
just give the project the same CRS of your layers.

A propos feature caching: there was an interesting presentation at foss4g 2007 
about feature caching:

http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/viewattachment.php?attachment_id=131

The idea to use r-Tree entities as data blocks sounds reasonable. Would be 
cool to have something like this in QGIS.

Marco

Message-ID: <CAG4NReLMf9+k_rTj-zJKmgmpKemzir6Y4_d=e4HM3UuLmYjkPA@mail.gmail.com>

Pirmin,

In your exercise
http://sourcepole.com/foss4g/en/advanced-labelling.html

the resulting size of the labels is inversely proportional to the rank
of the population, ie. for sites of SCALERANK = 1 labels are actually
the smallest.
I presume this is not what you wanted. I think that this result might
indicate that a tab for "inverse scale" is missing in "Data Defined Settings".
What do you think?
(Obviously the user can always create a new field with the inverse
scaling, but I think that such a button would be quite often used).

The way to run/activate an application with a parameter on OS X is to use the open command.  You specify the application by name with the -a flag.  So:

open -a Safari http://www.google.it/search?q=%PROVINCIA

The simpler version, if you want to open an URL with the default browser, is to simply 'open' the URL.

It's possible Safari interprets parameters differently when run the *nix way by using the executable, most OS X applications are not made to take parameters this way.

But also, running an app the *nix way creates a new process - you get another icon in your Dock if one is running already, instead of opening a new window in an already-running app.

Hi Marco

Hi Martin

> btw. the feature cache from #3200 is based on R-tree.

Wow, cool!
One question to the feature cache patch (didn't yet look into the code in 
detail, so maybe a silly one):

Reading the usage notes of the QgsFeatureCache class, it seems to me the 
implemented strategies are optimised for desktop scenario where user loads a 
scene and then zooms in.
In a wms server scenario, it would be nice to cache features in the tiles most 
viewed by visitors (e.g. parts of the city rather than countryside), but the 
zoom-in scenario is less likely in a webgis. Is the code in the patch  already 
optimised for the web-scenario or is it necessary to implement a new 
mode/strategy?

Regards,
Marco



+ * Last currently implemented mode/strategy is called "heuristics". This 
strategy
+ * compares the currently cached region with the requested one - and in case 
its
+ * much bigger, the cached area is downsized to free it's (probably) unused 
parts.
+ * This heuristics is based on the idea that user mostly starts editing with 
a big
+ * map and he zooms-in afterwards, editing only a small part of the whole 
map.
+ * This means he mostly doesn't need all the data in memory...

Reading around, there's conjecture but no real reason why safari behaves like this.

However, if you issue "open http://www.google.it/search?q=%PROVINCIA" you *should* get a webpage in the default browser (usually safari), and open -a safari http:// will should open it in safari.

-ramon.

The usage scenarios were indeed directed to browsing with map canvas -
new strategies should be added for different scenarios. Anyway we
should revisit the design to make sure it still fits well the
architecture before doing some serious work with the patch.

It works when there is at least one existing color ramp. There used to
be some default color ramps, however someone had to remove them. Some
default color ramps would be handy - anyone willing to contribute? The
style manager has the possibility to export symbols and color ramps,
so contributing should not be hard.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Formatting of label from PostGIS?
Message-ID: <CAAcYxUdTRwSPrQx-zFkT0qOuVoApHtbPhaoqp5c9EeewOGv4UA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using QGIS embedded inside of a Qt application and I'm rendering from a
PostGIS layer with a label that comes from a column that is a floating
point value in Postgres. Right now it prints out a lot of decimal places in
the label. Is there any way to limit this to 1 decimal place in QGIS? Or do
I need to do it in Postgres using a view?
Thanks,
Dave

Hi all,

how does it look with work-flow builder? I was thinking about this topic as
my master thesis, but then I found this really interesting project.

Best regards,

I have several ramps, but it does not work at the second hit, after pressing cancel.

IMHO what we really need is a very simple plugin to up and download styles. This will
lead to a wealth of user-defined styles that will enrich QGIS a lot.
All the best.

Message-ID: <399FB8774F0AE04AB0AE5270B7731B5202BAC37A@FRAVS010403.srv.fra.fraport.de>

Dear all,

We would like to write a Qgis plugin (either C++ or python, doesn't
matter) that allows us to visualize movements of vehicles over time.
Suppose the plugin provides coordinates for each second and vehicle. Our
fear is that for each frame to be rendered the whole map is redrawn. Do
you see a way to enable Qgis to only update the animated layer and not
all layers at once?

We know there is the time manager plugin that provides capabilities
similar to our requests. However, at our tests, this plugin suffered of
poor performance.

To get a bit more technical: As far as I understand the QgsMapCanvas has
to be redrawn as soon as a single element of one of the layers changes.
Is there a way to add some overlay that is just merged with the other
(already rendered) image?

Thanks for your support.

Jonny Kanwar

Quite strange: on one debian (git) and one osx (1.7.1) machine it does not work, on
another osx (git) it does.

Hi Paolo,

it might be something with Python 2.7 (I never tested the plugin with
Python 2.7), it seems like  object_pairs_hook was introduced in 2.7.

I think that there is some conflict between yous system's simplejson
library and those provided by the GeoCoding plugin.


And yes, I agree that there should be a place for plugin's bug reports :)

Hi Jonny

One possibility to handle this is to create a subclass of 
QgsMapCanvasItem to display the car symbols. That way, the QGIS 
background map is not re-rendered if the items change position.

Marco

Agreed. I would like to point out that support for downloading and
uploading styles will very quickly raise another topic: how to
organize the styles.

Right. For the start you may use QgsVertexMarker class which is
derived from QgsMapCanvasItem. Simply create it and set (and update)
the position (in map coordinates).

Got my dev env back up and running and finished exams so I have patched the
code to handle showing direction for multi line labels and removed the
option to toggle multi line labels.

Pull request at: https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/54

Note: There is also some small UI tweaks to the expression builder in that
request.

Agreed: and how to organize icons, a closely related issue. Also, styles may be

Subject: [Qgis-developer] World file and Georeferencer
Message-ID: <CAG4NReLJk+JwhMN7ELyj4ENnpLGpb5Fz0MRC7C13DndGdkcExQ@mail.gmail.com>

Maxim,

I often need a world file including rotation, would it be possible
that the Georeferencer plugin had the option of writing a world file
for order 1 polynomial? (perhaps it is possible  for Helmert also, as
the scaling could be done by modifying the resolution?).

Also, what do you understand by Linear? As far as understand, Helmert
and order 1 polynomial are linear also.

I've tried with option Linear, but the transformation does not include
rotation. I do not know if this is intentional (i.e., a narrower
definition of linear) or perhaps a bug (rotation parameter is not
correctly saved to the world file). In other words, the image is not
rotated if I select Linear (both with and without world file) but
it's rotated if I select order 1 polynomial (but what I need is the
world file).

Note world files are ready for rotation parameters:
http://www.omg.unb.ca/~jonnyb/processing/geotiff_tifw_format.html
http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//009t00000028000000

Also, could the pluging output the parameters of the transformations
(linear or not)?

Thanks!

Agus

yes, 1st order polynonmials and the 2D helmert transform are linear 
transforms, so this would be possible.

World-file export is currently not enabled for helmert+1st order because
rotated world-files are not always well-supported, even by qgis. It would be
quite bad to create files which are not supported by the originating
application.

But maybe rotated imagery works better with the new accelerated warping code?

Message-ID: <CAHLqMY8zfOay1AjosbKM1PWBxZveeYp8MnR9x4KeSw+UhHJmYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm starting to develop a python qgis standalone application in Ubuntu
based on ubuntu-gis-unstable ppa repository.

My QGIS works fine.

I have read pygis cookbook http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook and
http://desktopgisbook.com/Creating_a_Standalone_GIS_Application_1 post

But I have problems with (I believe) qgis path setting, I've been
trying several patterns"/usr", "/usr/bin", "/usr/lib",
"/usr/lib/qgis"..., with and without trailing "/"

But in any case I obtain...

>>> vlayer = QgsVectorLayer("/home/mugen/Dropbox/Proyectos/CIGIR/mapas/Amenaza.shp","Amenaza","ogr")
Failed to load

I think that given that in Ubuntu qgis is splitted in several folders
it is necessary make several independent path settings.

Anybody coud give some advice about this?

Which paths are necessary?, how I could make this "custom" settings?,
which specific resources my application have to find?

I've working on an risk assesment application, and a Facility-location
plugin/application

Thanks a lot.
F. Palm

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg8j6JuGPxbEQeTnkto6Wp55A=xLa-e0OGmsS301k5cdKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was playing around with some uDig, SLD and MapServer today and how they
handle labeling features and I noticed that they do labels per class (per
symbol in our case) and I remember seeing that rule based labeling was on
the To-Talk-About list for the next hackfest and thought I would throw a
few ideas about how I thought we could do it.

I have written a few details about my ideas here
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/RuleBasedLabelingIdeas

Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.

My motivation for thinking this would be good is that it's a pretty
powerful feature in SLD and MapServer but all the UIs that I have seen to
handle defining the labels per feature class/symbol are very below par IMO.

Hi Nathan,

I think it is a great idea, and I would prefer your second proposal : "add
a new UI in the labeling tab that fills with the symbols defined from style
tab that lets you define labels for each symbol."

I agree with you with keeping a simple "default label". It will allow quick
labelling configuration, and won't prevent "power users" from using a more
complex labelling system per symbol if needed.

I still wonder though if it is not possible to allow for Direct Editing

Not that anything is really broke, but I still feel it would give the

For instance when a layers Attribute Table is open AND its related layer is
editable,
double clicking a value cues that value for editing.
Problem with editing an Attribute Table is that it can span 3 Screens while

of an Identify Results window can show everything compact in a nice list.

I do want to say that I am still very much in favour of the "Edit Form"
I can invision the Edit Form becoming a very advanced Attribute Editing
window.

If there was an "Attribute Editing Form" that was user adjustable,
allowing specific Attributes to be viewable in a user specified order,
the "Attribute Editing Form" could become a very powerful and efficient
data entering tool.

I suppose the real question is whether it is better to combine the Edit
Form with the Identify Results window,
Or possibly adding another "Attribute Editor Tool" to the Editor Tool bar
that would allow selecting features
on the canvas to open an advanced Edit Form.

Just some thoughts .

Message-ID: <4EB39114.3060705@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I have the following problem: I need to count the number of lines in each polygon,
much in the way the current fTools command does summing up their length, or counting
the number of points.
Does anyone see a way of doing it, or should I extend the command to accommodate for
this?
All the best.

Of course I mean doing this with base qgis tools, not using PostGIS, SpatiaLite or GRASS.

 Hi Mars,

 Thank you for sharing your thoughts

 There may some functionality in QGIS that you aren't fully aware off:

 1. there are some options in the layer properties "Fields" tab. Here 
 you can hide certain fields, set them immutable, set a widget, such as a 
 slider, calendar widget, textbox, selection list, etc. - what you cannot 
 do here is to re-order the fields.

 2. You can create your own form using qt-designer. Here your are fully 
 free to design it as you like. The only things to keep in mind: widget 
 names need to correspond with field names and the data types must be 
 compatible with the widget you choose. qt-designer comes with the qt 
 development tools - you can install it with the OSGeo4W installer if you 
 want - or you can install it separately from the qt-Nokia website.

 see 
 http://linfiniti.com/2009/11/creating-dynamic-forms-a-new-feature-headed-for-qgis-1-4/
 and
 http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/

 Nevertheless we also plan new form features that should bring it on par 
 with products like Autodesk Topobase. J?rgen Fischer works/or will work 
 on it.

 Hope the above hints help a bit to get to your own custom forms.

 Hi Mars,

 Attached is an example of a custom form we use for a waste-water 
 management application. In this case we are combining it with python 
 init scripts, since the form is also filled in from different databases.

Hi Paolo

Current join implementation covers left outer join only, right joins are not 
supported (also no spatial joins yet).

As many of you know, we miss a fully updated trac for plugins. Some times ago we
opened a trac:
https://trac.faunalia.it/qgis_plugins/
manly intended as a temporary place to store tickets, waiting to migrate them to
their final destination.
I hope nobody will get offended by that.
BTW: any hope to have a full qgis-plugin redmine during the HF? What do we miss really?

This is fine, but an automatic system would be better: we could
automatically create a project instance for each uploaded project in the
new plugins repo.

It would be ideal to leave the developer the choice to use their own ticket
system, adding a "tracker" metadata entry to plugins would allow this. If
that metadata is empty, we can create the instance on the "central" redmine
hub.

What do you think about this proposal ?

I would discourage having multiple tracs, as this is a source of confusion for users.
Of course a dev can always have his own repo, trac, git and everything, but
mainstream plugins should stay in the main framework IMHO.

Exactly: nobody should be forced to use the central hub, but IMHO if they choose to
use it, then they should use the full infrastructure, for consistency.
Too much flexibility causes too much confusion, and with hundreds of plugin, this
will quickly become a nightmare.
Please remember: we even had developer rewriting a plugin because they did not
realize there was already one available for the same task.
All the best.

Message-ID: <90BFADC6A068D14BAB70913A6CAE81BB0894D4232A@noosloexchg>

Hi Everyone,

These are rather newbie questions so apologies beforehand. I hope someone in the know would be able to answer them.


1.       I would like to run qgis on portable windows 7 device for largely field data collection. What could I do to customise it to get rid of unrelated libraries and display etc to make it run faster i.e. basically have a sort of qgis-lite type of installation.

2.       My datasets are inside a ESRI personal Geodatabase. I am able to load and display the vector data using the "load vector" but there doesn't appear to be any way of loading the rasters inside the PGDB.

3.       Along the same line as #2, I can only display the vector data inside the PGDB but am unable to edit it. Is it possible to edit them at all? If not, are there any other ways of storing multiple datasets in a single collection and edit them?

Thanks lot.

Hey James,

I think the problem might be that the query builder, when you press ok, is
setting the the layer subset via QgsDataProvider::setSubsetString(string).
How setSubSetString works is up to the provider. In your case the provider,
that you joined to, doesn't know anything about the other fields or how to
filter based on them so it just returns nothing.

QGIS itself doesn't have a SQL engine in it's own right all most everything
with querying, except for the basic stuff, is passed to the provider. I
have had a chat to a few of the devs and it is something I am considering
if and how it could be added to QGIS. Not something that I myself will be
able to do, way over my head, but more just getting the ideas out there and
maybe some will fund it.

Hopefully this will at lest let you understand what is happening.

Aha, it is still possible to open the query builder for joined layers with the 
right click menu. Needs to be greyed out for joined layers as in the vector 
properties.

Yeah this will work because it is at a QGIS level.  Not so much a query
rather a "find all the items in the big index in the attribute table".
 QGIS has a model it keeps all the values and fields in, when you use the
search string it just looks everything up in this big index and selects it.
 Never really goes to the provider, not for searching anyway.

 If I use rule based styling I can also select things by attribute and
> style by attribute.


This is on a QGIS level too.  QGIS will check each feature in the current
extent to see if the expression passes, but the expression parser works on
QGIS fields and features (objects) rather then giving the work to the
provider.

If I use the right click menu on the layer with the join and select

> return any results.


Mainly, like I said above, that QGIS is pretty much saying to the provider
"here is a expression string, filter your dataset and give me back a
filtered set" then provider gets the string with the joined field (that it
doesn't have) and goes "hey! I can't do anything with this.  Have a null
dataset".

IMO would should rename Query to something like Set Subset or Filter (more
conventional).

+1 for "Filter" as we can perform only "WHERE" clauses from this tool.

Manuel,
I use world files with rotation to have a fast albeit just
approximately georeferenced display of images
acquired by a little uav. Those that are really interesting are
further georectified, but for a
first overview the world files with rotation are very useful.

In this case the problem is different. We got a geotif image with
wrong georeferencing (including a rotation)
but being at a very high resolution, we did not notice it and went on
digitizing some interesting features over
the raster. In order to avoid repeating the digitizing, we wanted to
create the world file for the raster
and use the same matrix to warp the vector with Geoprocessing/Affine.

Hi,

I can confirm that in my qgis-master on Ubuntu 11.10 the scale is going
crazy with epsg:3763 and others projected CRSs. Seems fine with WGS85.

Hi all,
I'm not used to ask directly for a bug fix but I'm giving a workshop
with QGIS 1.7.1 (Windows and Linux) and this bug

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4410

makes really the life hard and people puzzled ;)

Any taker?

cheers

Sanjay, the ESRI personal Geodatabase format is a jail [1], move off ASAP!

[1] http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2009/04/esri-formats-back-to-future.html

The good old Paul has been working on a tool to convert the data, but
you should really just put your data in a safe format and don't look back.

For a single-file multiple-datasets you could look at spatialite.

I'm unable to reproduce this bug. Maybe I don't have all the steps?

Hi Giovanni

Does not happen for me here. Maybe it is only with certain CRS? Could 
you post sample data?

Yes, I very much agree and celebrate the ability to add custom widgets and plugins to QGIS. 

My "user" request is to think about possible ways to make the features of the Identify Results and Editor Form possibly more efficient for users of the Core QGIS application. 

Spit and Polish if you will. 

If I have some spare time this weekend I'll work on building a proposed mock-up. 

Thanks for the links! Nice work!

The only things to keep in mind: widget names need to correspond with field names and the data types must be compatible with the widget you choose. qt-designer comes with the qt development tools - you can install it with the OSGeo4W installer if you want - or you can install it separately from the qt-Nokia website.

Hi Gary and Marco,

thanks for the interest. Just open a new empty project in wgs84 with
OTFR off and then add a raster (ex: a geotiff) defined in a projected
CRS.
You can try this:

I couldn't view the video, however I added a geotiff in UTM Zone 15N to an empty project with project properties wet to WGS 84 with no problems.

Hi Gary,
this link points to a geotiff in epsg 3763, not to a video.

It may be related to the issue another user reported in the user ML
and that I confirmed (adding my reply to the dev mailing list): it
seems that with certain projected CRSs the scale goes wild (also with
OTFR on). You can replicate the issue with the above raster layer.

Cheers

Hi Giovanni

OTF-Reprojection to wgs84 with your raster file works for me with 
current master.

Great to see a new potential contributor to the processing framework!
I have collected some of the conclusions from previous discussions and
some of my own thoughts on this "module piping" thing, here:

https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/Workflow-Builder

if you are looking for a smaller task to get familiar with the code
base, we have a list of pending issues, here:

https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/issues

Some are almost complete, while some are just vague ideas.

In my mind, that error is associated with a problem with the definition of the CRS of the layer.

Until I ran a workaround for AGD/AMG projections, files in the AGD-based projections (e.g. 20351) would fairly consistently bring up that error.

Hi Marco and Gary,

You need to test with OTFR *off*. Nevertheless I just realized now that
under Linux/qgis-master the problem seems gone, but it is still there on
Windows/qgis-master and 1.7.1 (osgeo4w). I believe also that 1.7.1 is
affected under Linux.

The scale is definitively broken, you can try the raster I have linked
in my previous messages.

Hi, then is a windows only problem. Odd, I was almost sure to have seen it
also under Linux, but I use mainly windows during training courses so I may
be wrong. In any case under windows is easy replicable.  Cheers.

I'm not sure, but I think I've seen this error message on ubuntu also
when trying to do georeferencing tiffs in combination with the
OpenLayers Plugin.
But recently I had an update of this plugin (running 0.71 now), and now
I do not see the error (any more).

Is it possible that your course machines are running the older
OL-plugin? If so, try to update or remove them?

Hi Richard (and Gary and Marco),

I found the source of the problem... is the *value tool* plugin.

This plugin is so important when doing raster analysis that in every
qgis installation/course I install it immediately (and in fact I think
it should become core).

Richard: you have fixed recently a few plugin issues, I didn't realized
it was introduced this regression, can you have a look at it?

Sorry for the noise,

cheers

Mmm... I introduced the use of On The Fly production in the value-tool
plugin... So big chance it IS me who is guilty :-(

Hope I will find time to have a look into in this week, otherwise I will
do it in Zurich during the hackfest

Juergen,

Sorry, I missed the internal/external bit about SpatialIndex.  But it's not working.

...I see what the problem is - when I hardwired it, it was before the GEOS include dir.  And the WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALINDEX test adds it after.  GEOS has a spatialindex.h.  So the precompiler is not case sensitive in header names for me, is this normal?

Mars,

I would interested in what you can come up with.  This would be a good
feature for QGIS IMO.  I had a use case the other day that I needed a user
to bulk update lots of land parcels with a string from a drop down, it was
quite had to do without using the field calculator.  This person was not a
GIS person so having a popup form would have been ideal.

My idea would be to change the way the Identify Tool works in order to
handle multi selection better, single click selects one feature, click and
drag selects a region.  We can use the Rectangle Select tool like this and
it's quite handy.

In terms of UI it would be handy to handy to have the tree view like we do
in the docked Identify window and the form on the left like the single
popup.  If it's a single feature selected then no tree view is shown, if
multi then the tree view is shown.

The root item in the tree view can be selected to update all the selected
items.

All objects
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 4

Selecting the single item in the list lets you update just that feature.

Selected feature should be highlighted on the map some how.

Hi Cedric

My suggestion (also in the wiki now) is that QGIS devs meet in the 
Chemiecafeteria for people arriving during the day: 

Chemiecafeteria (No.16,HCI) 
http://www.gastro.ethz.ch/locations/hberg/cafe_hci/index_EN

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

I tried to make this qgis project visible  in the browser:

http://www.christopherstark.de/extern/qgis-server2.jpg

I installed qgis server and it seems to work. When I use this URL below
(I think I changed it correctly to my settings) in the browser there is
only a white screen and no map.

http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgistest1/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=54.215710,10.017432,50.05100,15.0004508&CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=1077&HEIGHT=552&LAYERS=ostdeutschland-mercator2&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=96

Can anyone here help me to get the right url in order to make the map
visible in the browser?


best regards
Christopher

Hi Christopher,

What are your goals? To setup a WMS server or to setup a Web-GIS with
QGIS Webclient?

One option to test if QGIS server is working properly as a WMS server,
is to use QGIS desktop as a WMS client.

QGIS web client is a different story to setup. First let us know what
your goals are.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS version support
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqx9jdhcYQLPZ7mwib8vcdJn7UGpmP=Z9wCH3oSO_1pjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have added support for version_min/version_max attributes for
option/flag tags in .qgm files and for section/grass tags in .qgc
files. Then I have merged modules-common, modules-6.3, modules-6.4
into one dir modules and I have added the version attribute where
necessary.

Example from default.qgc:
<grass name="v.in.geonames" version_min="6.4"/>

Example from v.buffer.qgm:
<option key="buffer" version_max="6.3"/>
<option key="distance" version_min="6.4"/>

v.in.gns was only in modules-6.4 but according to GRASS man pages it
is available in GRASS 6.3 so I left it for all versions.
v.out.ogr.postgis.qgm was only in modules-6.3 but it may be replaced
by v.out.ogr.pg.qgm from modules-6.4 IMO, so v.out.ogr.pg.qgm (using
python script in QGIS) is now also available for all versions.

Hi Andreas,

I would like to choose the easiest way of displaying a complex
Qgis-project within a browser. I'm not sure if doing this with WMS or
the Qgis webclient is the easiest way.
Basically I want something like tilemill but with tilemill the whole
styling thing is a bit too complicated. So if it's possible with qgis to
simply display a complex map-projects with diagrams, raster-layers and
labeling in the browser that would be perfect for me. Later I would like
to have a look into TileCache (in order to use this for a website) but
for now being able to simply display the project in the browser is all I
want.

Christopher

I still get this message when I try to install the OTB Module
Interface with qgis 1.7.1 on ubuntu:
Could not find the Python bindings for OrfeoToolbox, which are
required to run the this module

while according to Synaptic I do have
ptb-wrapping-python 1.6.0-0ppa ~lucid1 Python bindings for ORFEO Toolbox library

Am I still missing something?

Thanks

Ok, that makes sense - applied your patch from #4427

Yes, that sounds good - changed in master.

However this leads me back to #3643 - your fix effectively removes any
difference in rendering when "line orientation dependent position" is
turned on or off.

Well, "direction symbol" only makes sense as following the line direction,
doesn't it ?

Hm, works for me for both cases on Linux and Windows.

Is your geos_c.h in the same directory as spatialIndex.h?

On Linux (Debian to be precise) the geos_c.h is in /usr/include while the C++
headers are in /usr/include/geos.  GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR is /usr/include and GEOS'
spatialIndex.h should only be found if geos/spatialIndex.h is included.
OSGeo4W doesn't have the C++ headers at all.

There are 2 Desperados in Zurich:
1) DESPERADO H?ngg Limmattalstrasse 215, 8049 Z?rich-H?ngg
2) DESPERADO Wiedikon Birmensdorferstrasse 129, 8003 Z?rich

Which one do you mean?

 it is the DESPERADO in H?ngg, which is close to ETH H?nggerberg.

 I also wondered why one wants to call a restaurant "DESPERADO"? I guess 
 it has some meaning for someone ...

Hi,

during the HF in Lisbon the streaming/recordings of presentations didn't
go very well, especially for the lack of a proper microphone for audio.
There will be one available together with a webcam? I forgot the webcam,
but if necessary I can arrange one as also a proper microphone. Let me
know if you want me to take care of it.

cheers

The brutal 50% / strcasecmp was fixed by Martin Dobias here:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/625ff111e1fb6c723db93017bb7bd5bd2c13ccc0
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/8e2e654c448d7f035697a1351af88c847797b99b

After that fix, pj_transform jumped up to 25% (21 MB line shp epsg
4326 -> 102067, qgis mapserver), which is significant IMO and it seems
to be the only part which could be optimized with big potential gain.

Hi

Ok lets discuss it at the hackfest, but it is a possibility since we
did not yet break api.

Just bear in mind that there is a large, often silent, group of people
who would prefer bug fix releases over feature releases. I'm going to
be backporting any fixes to 1.7 branch over the next few days with an
eye to putting out a 1.7.2 release during the hackfest.

I suggest at least that we branch 1_8 before we start with the
hackfest proper since I guess we will start ripping things out and
breaking api during the meeting.

Oh damn.  The OS X framework has geos_c.h along with the C++ headers.  This is so that the framework include method works for C++ headers (OS X framework headers can be specified with the frameowrk name/header without -I flags, say <GEOS/spatialindex.h>, and the compiler knows to look in the framework's headers folder, ie GEOS.framework/Headers/spatialindex.h), and so the C header also has a place to be (there are no other header folders in a framework and a subfolder for the C++ headers would break the framework include method.  IOW, the C++ headers can't be isolated.

Having the SpatialIndex header folder before the GEOS header folder in cmakelists should work fine then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.0 layertree: decoupling logical grouping
	and the drawing order
Message-ID: <b984fd654a0d49029910640bc3e66388@carto.net>

 Hi,

 Next to being a QGIS user, we are also Autodesk users. One feature I 
 like in Autodesk which doesn't exist in QGIS is the decoupling of the 
 logical grouping (our existing nested hierarchies) from the actual 
 drawing order.

 In Autodesk you have two tabs in the layer tree. One tab is for the 
 logical grouping, in the other tab you get a flat list of the drawing 
 order.

 Use case: you want to logically group layers from different media (say 
 all gaz layers, all water layers, all waste-water layers), but in the 
 drawing order you first want to draw the polygon features, then the line 
 features, then the point features.

 Something to discuss in the Zurich meeting?

 Attached is also the relevant part of the GUI in Autodesk. It is 
 german. The "Gruppen" tab means "Groups", the "Zeichnungsreihenfolge" 
 tab means "drawing order".

 Do you also think that this decoupling would be useful for upcoming 
 QGIS versions?

 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Yes.  I think we almost have that.  The layer hierarchy is basically
independant of the drawing order in the map canvas.

It's just that legend updates the drawing order of layers in the canvas
whenever the hierachy changes.   Changing that shouldn't be hard.

 good to hear. It would have some implications for QGIS server and QGIS

Hi Tim,
when backporting for 1.7, would You please include these two:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/ed20ff368723695a76c03648b7b528b4bf827adb

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/50f20c2c20e39c33ba72bd72d370acdcffeb9d67

I did backporting by myself and they works well.



Thanks a lot for Your work.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin metadata in a text file
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfrUndfQ5yw0QQAvPXXyMs2CpAm81G4fSbuB6DqRiyk=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

just want to let you know about a recent addition in master branch: I
have introduced the possibility to put plugin's metadata to a text
file (metadata.txt).

Until now plugins' metadata were always retrieved from __init__.py by
calling python methods. Reading metadata from a text file has the
advantage of not requiring to load the plugin code and can be done by
plugin repository.

Metadata in metadata.txt is preferred to the methods in __init__.py -
if the text file is present, it is used to fetch the values. Backward
compatibility is preserved - all existing plugins will continue to
work. From QGIS 2.0 the metadata from __init__.py will not be accepted
- the metadata.txt file will be required.

Plugin metadata should be in INI file format, recognized by python's
ConfigParser module and by Qt's QSettings class.

All currently used metadata should be in [general] section. Example use:

[general]
name=PostGIS manager
description=Manage your PostGIS database
version=Version 0.5.15
icon=icons/postgis_elephant.png
qgisMinimumVersion=1.0.0

Good idea Martin.

I had the a thought the other day that it would be good to be able to list
the dependencies of the plugin in there too.
This list would have to be hand maintained but the author .  The plugin
installer would then be able to see before trying to install what the
package needs to run correctly.

Just a thought.

I remember some discussions on this topic on qgis-dev list. The
dependencies may be external python modules, other qgis python
plugins, maybe something more...

I think that the metadata for the  plugins will probably change (and
grow) over time, it would be probably a good idea to change the  web
plugins app schema to handle metadata as denormalized
key-values-pairs.

Martin: can you please give me a list of required metadata ?

... tags should be added too.

It would be good to also put a change set list some where, sometimes it's
nice to see what has changed between a version of a plugin.  The plugin
website could read this and then that would flow down to the plugin
installer.

Hi Nathan,

there is already a (not mandatory) changelog text input box available
when you upload a new revision of an existing plugin in the new web
app.

Are you suggesting to put this piece of information in the metadata text file ?

Yeah.  It would be easier from a developer point of view.  I can just stick
my change log in there and the web app just reads it in saving me the time
to have to fill it out plus then when you download it you have a central
place to look for the change log.

Plugin bug address (where to send bug reports).
Could eventually be used automatically by a plugin wrapper on crash
(for example) or there could be a contextual menu sending you there
for reporting a problem.

Mind you: a change log grow rate sounds pretty different from a
configuration directive list grow rate.
Your changelog might get huge...
How about using a different file for that ?

I'll like it !
I want my layers to be grouped by topologies, but the actual things
drawn should be in an order which depends on geometry type, not
logical group appartenence.

Hi,

I can confirm that in my qgis-master on Ubuntu 11.10 the scale is going
crazy with epsg:3763 and others projected CRSs. Seems fine with WGS85.

I think the idea is to only store changes from the previous version,
each version is stored separately on the plugins app.

BTW I'm also concerned about storing potentially huge text blobs
inside an ini file.

I'm not very skilled with that format, is that ok for large text blobs
? I thought it was best suited for kwp.

I don't mind if the change log isn't stored in the ini, no big deal really.
Was just throwing it out there.

In the end it wouldn't be that hard for the web app to look for a CHANGELOG
file and read that in.  In the end we just have to set something up with
easy to use and follow conventions so that it makes the plugins consistent.
 Convention over configuration.

Convention-wise, may I suggest a NEWS file ?
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/NEWS-File.html

Unfortunately the GNU Standards document doesn't contain formatting
specifications for that file as it would be more for human
consumption. On the contrary the ChangeLog [1] file is more strictly
defined and is the target of known tools (git2cl, cvs2cl, svn2cl)
but isn't expected to contain informations about releases (only
single changes).

[1] http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html

What's the use pattern for current plugins ? Does the plugin builder
provide a template ?

Seems authorName string missed in this example. Is it supported?

I've updated the PluginBuilder plugin to generate a metadata file. At present it contains:

----------------------
# This file contains metadata for your plugin. Beginning
# with version 1.8 this is the preferred way to supply information about a
# plugin. The current method of embedding metadata in __init__.py will
# be supported until version 2.0

# This file should be included when you package your plugin.

[general]
name=Metadata Test
description=test of metadata generation
version=0.1
qgisMinimumVersion=1.0
class_name=MetadataTest
author=GeoApt LLC
email_address=gsherman@geoapt dot com
-----------------------

If you have thoughts about other items the PluginBuilder can or should capture let me know.

That's a possibility. The question is whether it would not be
sufficient to read the additional data from metadata.txt when
necessary.


> Martin: can you please give me a list of required metadata ?

Metadata required by QGIS are those listed in the first mail: name,
description, version, icon, qgisMinimumVersion. QGIS currently does
not use further items. Plugin installer/repository additionally uses
author's name. The "experimental" flag could be included in the
metadata, too.

Hi Gary

what is exactly the purpose of "class_name" metadata?

I would suggest to add a link to plugin's home page and/or plugin's bug tracker.

Regarding the author, we may use the following scheme:

[author]
name=James Bond
email=james@secretagents.gov.uk

Further author keys may be used in future:
url=http://www.secretagents.gov.uk/~james/
twitter=james007
osgeo_id=james007

Hi Otto & other community members

I have migrated the documentation to git. Please have a play around
and see if everything is as expected before you start doing any
serious work. Otto and I will probably do some more tweaks over the
hackfest this weekend. The repository is available here:

git@github.com:qgis/QGIS-Documentation.git

Message-ID: <CALCNqka82GMQD=u9tNjNobrj27pHxvjAJULi0UMcQODPuQUQqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Just an update for if you are using the QGIS Web client - I have
merged the changes in my fork to the main repo. These changes were
discussed with Andreas Neumann and others some time ago but tonight is
the first change I have had to actually merge them. A summary of the
changes is as follows:

- public files have been moved down into 'site' folder so that it is
easy to keep project files and data out of the web public space
- a default qgis project with a highly original name of
'helloworld.qgs' is provided along with a spatialite database with
some awesome looking layers [1]. The goal here is to bring down the
'time to feeling good' for a new user setting up the client to a few
minutes since we already ship with a basic working configuration that
lets them try out the service.
- I have templated GlobalOptions.js with two versions :
GlobalOptions.js.templ-900913 and GlobalOptions.js.templ-4326. They
provide sensible starting point defaults for working with Geographic
and Google Mercator - more templates could be added as needed. Knowing
that you need to set CRS dependent defaults has been a stumbling block
for new users in our experience.
- A new landing page laid out with blueprint css which we will
eventually popuplate with more useful getting started info [2]
- renamed icons directory to gis_icons as the old name caused
conflicts with apache's built in icons directory on some
configurations.
- added a templated sample apache config file so that you can just
rename it, tweak it and drop it in your apache sites-available folder
and then deploy it
- redid the readme in text2tags, added my nifty looking templating
stuff and generated pdf for it [3]

There are probably other changes here that I have forgotten to mention
but I think those are the main items. We still need to update the
readme to contain more up to date 'getting started' instructions soon.

Great.
Which rules will be used for documentation repository? Will translators have

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tickets statuses in Redmine
Message-ID: <CALuHMPAGHnxNZHAwSFpZDqpDapPxN6u32Ev2Xkkn8XLJA80zUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

just found that some closed tickets in redmine (at this moment two) has
status "Resolved" while other has status "Closed". Also there are several
closed tickets with status "Rejected". I think this is a bit confusing

What do you think about creating more strict rules for assigning tickets
status. Something like this:
 - if bug fixed - set status "Resolved" with appropriate resolution tag
 - if feature implemented - set status "Closed" with appropriate resolution tag
 - duplicates and other invalid tickets should use status "Rejected" with
   appropriate resolution tag

Any thoughts?

A 1.7.2 version would be much appreciated, in particular as I can imagine
that reaching the 2.0 will be
challenging and will take longer than usual.
I do not see any improvements in the suggested list related to raster layers
(histograms, barplots, color bar, legend, interactive stretching...). Would
those be excluded from 1.7.2 as currently planned?

As a user-end hypothetical question, what would be the difference between 1.8 and 1.7.2?

Hi Ramon

1.7.2 will have the same functionality as 1.7 (and 1.7.1), it will
deliver some bug fixes.
1.8 would contain new functionality and bug fixes (and probably new bugs).

Ok so I am going to branch 1.8 tonight and try to release it when I
get back to South Africa (I will post the release timetable only
then). Feel free to backport anything useful into 1.8 until we hit
feature freeze. That will free us up to start taking things apart a
little on master.

Is it possible to add an action or a list of actions on this QT dialog (from actions created on the layer) ?

Hi Tim,

so from now we should backport fixes only into 1.8 branch? Or 1.7.2
also will be released?

Message-ID: <CAA6k8-Jfkb9Moc5BnNbtwfLvttSZZfwNyJSuaBuhUSPS=fYGSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I think would be useful to add a button "Send error" on the
python error dialog to send the error message either to a ML
or maybe to the author's email if provided in metadata,
but also hide the error until the user tick a "Show details"
checkbox in that dialog (obviously the checkbox status would be
stored in settings).

This may make the error more user-friendly and help to report
plugin bugs in a easier way.

Comments?

Hi Patrice,

As far as I know you can.  Add a button to your form and name it the same
as the layer action.  Give that a try if that doesn't work I can chase it
up more.

If this works I'll update my blog post that you commented on too.

What about sending the user to the bug tracker and prefilling the error? Of
course the plugin should be in hub.

+1 from me too - very good idea to collect errors ..
Suggestion is to send the mail to the maintainer of the plugin and/or to
a mailing list for archive/documentation purposes ..

Hi all.
The current situation of database (PostGIS and SpatiaLIte) plugin in 
QGIS is complex, and extremely confusing for users.
We tried to summarize the current situation here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Database
Our aim is to have one general purpose plugin, and include it in core 
QGIS. We are committed to its long-term support.
I would like to ask plugin developers to join forces, and cooperate to 
add all the useful functions to it. Of course nobody is forced to do it, 
but I think it it in the interest of everybody not to duplicate work. Of 
course in case of collaboration due credits will be given to everybody.
Please share your thoughts.
All the best.

As long as you are planning to overhaul the PostGIS import process, why not use ogr2ogr instead of shp2pgsql? 

This would allow import of a bunch of formats in addition to shapefiles.

I agree it is time for SPIT to go---it has a lot of little nits hiding in the corners...

So the plan is this:

- Werner Macho will maintain 1.7.x branch until 1.8 comes out (which
will take probably around a month)
- Once 1.8 comes out Werner will do the point release maintenance and
I will focus on 1.9.99 beta releases leading up to QGIS 2.0

So when 1.8 is out, just backport to the release-1_8 branch, the
releases will then be branched from there to release-1_8_1

Hope that makes sense.

Tim

I developed the Import Vector Feature as part of the GSoC 2011,
it allows to import vector layer using QGis providers.
The idea was to use that new feature also to create new PostGIS
layers from QGis GUI, but even to save a layer as a SL/PG table.

In this moment the DBManager plugin only (another part of my GSoC)
supports import vector feature by drag'n'drop layers.

Anyway that feature is in master yet and works on OGR, PostGIS
and SpatiaLite providers.
It probably needs some improvements, but it seems to works quite
well right now.

Hi All

After discussion with Alessandro Passoti, we have added the new repo
as a default in QGIS so that users can start to use it and stress test
it before 2.0 gets released.

Hi All

I have created a new branch for the upcoming version 1.8.0 release:


git fetch
git branch --track release-1_8

Please add a tag  [BP18] to all your commits that can be applied to
the branch (i.e. that don't break API). I will post a release schedule
after the hackfest, but first we will release 1.7.2.

Hi all,
looking at IRC seems there's some confusion about which is the
right site to upload a plugin to the new repo.

On Sat, Nov 12, 2011 at 12:42 PM, Tim Sutton <lists@linfiniti.com> wrote:

The Quantum GIS Plugin Repository (plugins.qgis.org) [1] is the
web site to share your plugins.
You can upload a new plugin or just see the state of the previous
uploaded ones, which versions, if it was approved, and so on.

The other site [2] is instead the QGis Plugins Issue tracking system.
Creating a trac instance once uploaded a new plugin on the QGis
Plugin Repository site is optional, but it gives users a place to report
problems that occur using a plugin.

I hope this helps.
Regards.

Since I was the one confused, I would like to thank you for clearing this
up :)
One addition : Qgis hub is also the place to share the plugin source code,
using the "repository" option. I am not sure though if the repo linked with
a redmine project is only readable, or if users would be allowed to
push/pull through redmine
(in my company, we use redmine only to show the changesets of repositories.
We push and pull throuh ssh connections for better control and safety)

Cheers

The Redmine interface lets the owner of the plugin decide who else has
read/write(pull/push) to the plugin code over standard git methods (ssh
key based, just like github). Read-only over http and the web interface
is provided by default to the public.

So basically you can grant git permissions via the project properties
for your plugins. The actual code handling is done by gitosis on the
backend.

Thanks,
Alex

Thanks for this answer. Hum.; I think I will have to learn Git if I want to
let others contribute to Lizmap... Me and my coworker are using Mercurial
instead... I don't think it will be that hard. Just the opportunity to
discover another well-known versioning tool.

Good night

+1 from me though perhaps it might be nice to submit it to our django
app so we can build a database of errors and the plugins that cause
them. Of course we would need to build something for that quickly.

a previous update introduced a bug when adding a projected raster in a
lat/lon project with otfr off, this was fixed.

also was fixed a minor problem with GRASS rasters.

A simpler option would be to send the errors to a dummy mailman list, so 
we get archiving, threading etc. for free.
All the best.

Hi all.
Now that we are using redmine also for plugins, can we move our wiki to

Opinions?
Volunteers?
Can this be made automatically, or?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Call for packaging: QGIS 1.7.2
Message-ID: <4EBFB271.30106@gmail.com>

Hi Folks

Today I have branched QGIS version release-1_7_2 - the second maintenance
release on the 1.7.x branch.

The source tarball is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.2.tar.bz2
and the md5 checksum is here:
http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-1.7.2.tar.bz2.md5

You can check out this branch (depending on your personal settings) using:

git fetch origin
git branch --track release-1_7_2 origin/release-1_7_2

If packagers would be so kind as to update http://download.qgis.org
with links to their latest wares, it will be appreciated. I'll give a
few days (and until we have Windows binaries at minimum) before making
the announcement to the world.

Please note that I have reinstated maintenance of the CHANGELOG file
in the root of the source tree, so consult that (or the
help->about->whats new? tab after building) to see what changes were
made. Some of the last minute commits will not be mentioned there.
There are no new features in the release, only bug fixes and small
tweaks.

This will be the last 1.7.x release.


Best regards
Werner

Hello Kimaidou,

I am curently finishing one of the last file. See http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Doc_qgis_fr for a list of files. I need to check the foreword chapter as Christophe tell me on Francophone ML that he didn't finish it. You can check it will help surely.

After the next release (1.8) of the documentation there will be a big work to migrate documentation to RST. Help will be welcome.

Hello Jean-ROC,

Yep. Otto will give more information I think but here is a synthesis:
* first we move to github and test the new process
* we publish the 1.8 release of the doc, translation process begin
* changes LaTeX to RST occurs in master.

RST file will be converted to odt file or HTML with a style specific to QGIS (it is really easy, 
we "just" need to edit an odt file, create our style and uses this file as value of the --stylesheet flag). From odt we could thus create pdf, doc file. etc.

I will test really soon this process for the gdal-ogr documentation and so will contact you for the cover ;)

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO7_1FD32GL19EaYSou0GqOkK4DW76Cp_Ecq-PJKHmb_5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

  I would like to use the hub to publish documentation and source code for
Lizmap plugin and Lizmap web application. As Lizmap has the same goal as
QgisWebClient, I  think it will help users if we create one parent project
called "Qgis Web Clients" in the same level as Qgis Android. This project
will contain 2 sub-projects : QgisWebClient and Lizmap Web Client.
I will then create a second project Lizmap Plugin under "User Plugins"

Let me know if this proposal sounds ok.

Cheers

Message-ID: <CADs9uc9cZGZyEc0NBniAfV--x1VMy+aEFjBos=0wEzJT9CPk4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Any resolution to make Georeferencing Plugin (C++) working in Mac OS X
for QGIS 1.7.2

It is working in Ubuntu and I think it is also working in Windows
since we heard no complains. However, it is not working in Mac OS X.

I hope this would be fixed in QGIS 1.7.2 release.

To: qgis-user@lists.osgeo.org

I concur that the Georeferencing is not working that well in OS X.

When you select a reference point in the Raster it pops up a Enter map
coordinates window
When you ask to select from map canvas the Georeferencer window hides
Once you select the map canvas co-ordinate, the Georeferencer window
unhides BUT
The Enter map coordinates window becomes buried behind every QGIS Window as
last priority.

The Enter map coordinates window needs to be "Always On Top"

Tested on 1.7.1

Hi all,

Today I was looking at some different ways to redesign and optimize the
attribute table UI and have come up with a design that I think works well
but would like to get some feedback first.

I have made two screenshots, showing the old and new dialog at the same
size and using the same Qt theme.

Just a plain comparison screenshot :
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6170988/Plain.png
Comparison screenshot with notes : http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6170988/Noted.png


The main things are:

   1. Make the min row height to 16.  This removes the empty space below
   the text in the current UI and allows more rows to be shown with less
   wasted space.
   2. Reduce some of the margins around the controls.
   3. Move the search stuff to the top in order to give search text more
   space and group the items better. All search options at the top.
   4. Replace Advanced search button with a hyperlink style button.  This
   is less distracting from a UI point of view IMO.
   5. Remove Search button as Enter on the keyboard does the same thing. Is
   a button really needed?
   6. Split buttons at bottom into two groups.  Actions for current
   selection and stuff that only works in edit mode e.g. adding new column.

 Over all you can show about 4 more rows depending on the theme.  Having
the search at the top for me feels better as it is less cramped then where
it is now and makes more sense to click Show Selected Only and seeing the
results below.

Anyone have any thoughts about the design?

As a simple user as am I, I think it's very nice and more confortable!
BTW, I'm the only thinking that the grey icon of the calculator botton 
should be colored? The difference in editing mode is very lightly!
rob

ps. using QGIS 1.7.1 and default theme of the icons

 Hi Nathan and others,

 I like your new proposal, Nathan.

 At the dev-meeting in Zurich we also discussed marrying the attribute 
 table with the forms. The forms would be in the same window as the table 
 you could jump between form and table using tabs.

 It would have the advantage of fewer windows and we would add 
 navigation buttons to the forms, like
 * jump to first record
 * last record
 * next record
 * previous record
 * indication of the total nr of records
 * button to change to edit mode
 * button for new record
 * button to filter records (using the query builder)
 * button to remove filter
 * button to highlight current and/or selected record(s)
 * later: also a button to export current selection to 
 csv/xls/openoffice, etc.

 The filter and the add/delete function would work simultaneously on the 
 tables and forms.

 The other things we want to add are master/detail forms for one to many 
 relations and a tab for showing related forms or tables.

 The Autodesk Topobase product is a very good source of inspiration for 
 such a combined table/forms approach. See 
 http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/topobase_-_customizable_forms.bmp 
 for an example.

 J?rgen Fischer will be working for us to improve the forms/tables - so 
 Nathan, maybe you could team up with J?rgen to improve the tables and 
 forms. I would also be interested in discussing new approaches and 
 ideas, but I cannot contribute from a programming point of view.

 Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Is there a document that describes your plans concerning attribute table
and forms?

It would be good to add it to a central summary of developer meeting
results.

Thanks,

Anita

Yeah it would be good to put this all together.

I do like the general idea of having the forms and tables together however
I would like to see a UI mockup first as I have a few things I'm not sure
how they would work.

I'm happy to work with J?rgen to help improve this area. I'll help where
ever I can even if it is just throwing ideas around.

Well Tim you know  what the _real_ issue is here?  The rest of the UI is
not consistent with _my_ UI design ;)

Nah it's cool I'm happy to nuke that idea and just have a small button.

Hi Andreas,

one more thing for the to-do list: Currently a layer's table opens 
_always_ when I click on the open-table button. Thus I sometimes end up 
with the same table opened several times. It would be good if the QGIS 
application could check if the table is already opened and if yes bring 
the respecive window to front instead of opening a new one.

regards

Bernhard

We will be radically overhauling the GUI for 2.0 anyway so who knows,
maybe we will gravitate towards Nathan's view of life the universe and
gui design :-)

Hi Nathan

nice stuff. One more thing I have been thinking about is that we could
do the search in a way the browsers nowadays do it: keep the widgets
for search hidden by default, saving further vertical space. The
search bar would be opened only after clicking a search button or
pressing the usual ctrl+F or "/" shortcut.

Final ideas:
- "show selected only" may become a checkable tool button in the group
of selection buttons
- IMHO the "move selected to top" button may be removed. It used to be
there from the ancient times of the attribute table when there was no
"show selected only" option

Regards
Martin

 Hi git cracks!

 My git troubles continue ...

 Now I wanted to do a normal read-only clone to start everything from 
 scratch and I get this error message:

 Here is my command:

 git clone https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git

 here is the error message:

 Cloning into Quantum-GIS...
 warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout.

 Does it mean that cannot find a master? Do I have to checkout a 
 specific branch? I just want the current master (1.9.x).

 Thanks for any help/hints!

 Hi Anita,

 No - we haven't yet started a wiki-page on it. We only discussed it and 
 studied the way that Autodesk Topobase is doing it. It is the only GIS I 
 know that has proper forms/table support out of the box. Are there any 
 others GIS that have some very good form support that we may study for 
 inspiration?

Something seems up with using the https:// version.

Try using git://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS.git instead.  This works on my

 Hi Nathan,

 Here is a youtube video about the topobase way of using forms/tables:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg1jNobJdV0&feature=BFa&list=PL48D1BBA49772FA02&lf=results_video

 sorry the narration is in german, but the form is in english.

 In this video you see multiple tabs:

 * form tabs
 * relation tabs linking to linked forms or tables
 * table

 All in one window.

 On the bottom you have the toolbar with the buttons for navigation, 
 manipulation, filter/search and highlighting.

 unfortunately the git protocol does not work on port 80/443 - it 
 requires port 22 which I do not have open. Also, we have a proxy ...

 How I hate these proxy/firewall things ...

 I found these ideas:
 http://sitaramc.github.com/tips/git-over-proxy.html

 and see if it helps.

 so for now - until I find a better solution - I am git-ting on a remote

 Not a very nice solution, but at least it works ...

 the "socat" solution described at 
 http://sitaramc.github.com/tips/git-over-proxy.html did not work 
 unfortunately.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Feedbacks about Qgis Server
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO62t53cWQjBR_WqkUxnKsqEC0gDStMqXhucBvTgn7XLxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

  During the development of Lizmap, we have needed some features not yet
implemented, or encountered some problems. I would like to write down in
the email all the things which seem interesting as a feedback, and all the
questions I have. Please see it as a user contribution, and not as
criticism if course. (I am using *Qgis 1.7.1*). I will open tickets if
needed depending on your answers.

*GENERAL*

* DPI : I you want to have the exact same renderding for Qgis Desktop and
Qgis Server, you have to use DPI=96 in the WMS client (e.g. in OpenLayers,
you have to set the option : OpenLayers.DOTS_PER_INCH = 96). For webmapping
point of view, increasing DPI from 72 (default in web applications) to 96
is not a good thing, as it increases the size of images received by the
client. It could be great to set in Qgis project properties the DPI for the
rendering in Qgis Desktop. This way, the user will have the choice to
create one project in 72 DPI for web purpose only. The web client will then
be able to ask images with the same 72 dpi, and the rendering will remain
identical between desktop and server. I do not know if it is an easy thing
to do, or a big development to achieve this...

*GETCAPABILITIES*

* Layers meta-data
At present, Qgis Server send an empty "Abstract" property for each layer in
the GetCapabilities request, since it is not possible to write down this
abstract in Qgis Layer properties dialogue. It could be good to have this
possibility for groups too. In Lizmap plugin, the user can manually edit
the Abstract field for each group or layer, but it would be better imho to
have it directly in Qgis.

*GETLEGENDGRAPHICS*

* SVG icon for point layer : When you change the DPI parameters, the text
size changes, but the size of the SVG icon does not
- 96 DPI :
http://178.32.101.237/lizmap/index.php/lizmap/service/?PROJECT=alaska&pp=demo&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphics&LAYERS=airports&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&WIDTH=150&DPI=96
- 300 DPI :
http://178.32.101.237/lizmap/index.php/lizmap/service/?PROJECT=alaska&pp=demo&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphics&LAYERS=airports&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&TRANSPARENT=TRUE&WIDTH=150&DPI=300

One solution could be to have 2 different parameters to change text and
icon size independently ?

* Legend of a group shows also layers that are not visible (min and
maxscale layer property). I tried to use the SCALE parameter to check this
behaviour. The getLegendGraphics returns all the layers of a group (if
called with the group name as the LAYERS parameter). For exemple, a group
called "hydro" and containing 2 layers "main river" (visible at all scales)
and "minor rivers" visible only at scales =< 5 000 000. If I ask the legend
for this group "hydro", I would like the server to only return the legend
of "major rivers" with SCALE=10 000 000, and both layers with SCALE=2 000
000.

QGIS API

* Get groups state : I could not figure out how to get the toggled state of
groups with the api. I tried :
self.iface.legendInterface().isGroupVisible(myGroups.indexOf(myId))
But it seems to provide another type of information.
The idea is to know if a group is toggled or not in the project.

I hope I was clear enough :)

If something is wrong with the https URL, drop the GitHub guys a support
request:

  https://github.com/contact

 Because it should work and if it doesn't there may be a bug on their end.

 Hi Kimaidu.

 Thank you for your constructive remarks.

 Many of the issues you raise here were also identified before or at the 
 recent developer meeting. See also 
 http://www.qgis.org/wiki/QGISWebClientIdeas

 The issue with the different scales are really annoying, so why dont we 
 make the 96 dpi the default? Do you really think it is much slower? BTW 
 - we already get 96dpi images, only OL seems to calculate the scale with 
 72dpi. We even try to detect the dpi when loading the client. Not sure 
 if this works properly ... Thanks anyway for the hint. I will test it.

 An improved GetLegendGraphics with user configurable sizes is already 
 requested and will be a paid development/improvement from Sourcepole.

 GetCapabilities improvements: at the meeting we decided to use a web 
 map context (similar to GetCapabilities) but more configurable to 
 transport settings we want, e.g the initial layer visibility, etc.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

I started with the migration on Saturday. There is a migration script for an

Ok, may be you can already help me ;)

I have to find a way to use sphinx directive with rst2odt command line. rst2odt 
don't support toctree directive which is only way I know to create HTML pages 
which link to other page (one page per chapter I mean).

rst from docutils seems to be in one single rst file to make output.

I will realize some test with the GDAL documentation in french to test the 
process.

You can contact me directly if I am not clear in english ;)

Was there a discussion about this topic and a test if Redmine supported
all the features we wanted? The css options in Redmine are somewhat limited.

As an alternative, what about a django based wiki out of the same
service that runs the new plugins site? Might be easier to integrate?

Thanks,
Alex

Well, it hasn't improved, but thanks to Mars I figured out the problem better and it is usable.  I'll put a note in the readme when I package up 1.7.2 (see the bug report also).

Hi,

it is not related to the fact you minimize the QGIS window, it crashes
also without doing it.

After a few tries I found the problem, it happens when printing with the
options "print as single file" and "overview map" active.

The author of the plugin wants me to open a project on Redmine and file
the ticket there?

cheers

Hi!

As far as I know Cedirc tracked the bug down on the Hackfest - but I am 
not sure if that is a new one now or Cedric has just not pushed a new 
version.. But it defenitely sounds like the bug I saw at the HF ..

So there should be a new version somewhat sooner or later ..

Werner

Much slower, no, but I know for sure that decreasing tile sizes in one of
the first optimisation you do when you deliver map on the web. But I am not
sure decreasing DPI Tto 72 will make a big change though...

We spend half a day to understand why the layers did not have the correct
behaviour regarding min and maxScale. After some deep thinking, it appeared
it was relative to DPI . I can confirm for sure that using the OL option
OpenLayers.DOTS_PER_INCH = 96 and asking tiles in 96 DPI works. No more
problems (we tested it on a very complete and complex Qgis project)

Hi all.
I think the link "Bugs" in our home page should not land directly on 
Redmine, but on one page explaining:
- how to open a ticket (first replicating it, then checking if it's new, 
then registering @ osgeo, etc.)
- how to have the bug fixed: do it yourself and send a patch or pull 
request, hire a new developer, or contract one of qgis-dev (I could 
assist in the process if necessary)
Opinions?
All the best.

Hi all.
I think we could add a menu item to qgis, allowing an user to register 
as such:
- subscribing to the -users mailng list
- adding an username to the new plugin app (so plugin reports can be 
identified)
- collecting stats
- adding to the users map.
It should be simple and will let us understand our user base much 
better. Opinions?
All the best.

QGIS (desktop) reads the dpi from the system and uses this dpi for the WMS 
requests. The WMS server cannot know about the clients dpi, therefore relies 
on the DPI parameter from the request.

Is it possible to get the system DPI with javascript? If yes, we should use 
that value. If not, 96 seems better to me since most screens have a similar 
resolution (at least closer to 96 than 72).

Marco

Message-ID: <4EC239AA.9080105@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I see we are moving away from LaTeX, a move that will bring us more 
translators, I think. In the occasion, could we think how to make 
screenshots more automatic? I think we can add a command to rst to 
automatically generate them during compilation, e.g. qgis --snapshot 
filename --project filename.
Currently this does not allow to open menus etc, but at least some of 
the screenshots could be made automatic. This could allow to have 
different manuals for different operating systems, different languages 
etc. with less effort.
All the best.

Just a side note: I wonder why it is so difficult to access
non-standard ports and services related to work activities.

Even if they are blocked by default, it should be easy to unblock them,
once the motivation is clear...

Hi all.
Currently, keeping translations in sync with the main manual is rather 
painful. A friend told me in other projects (apparently KDE is one) the 
are using scripts to extract text from LaTeX and prepare .po files, so 
that a translator is presente with the changed parts only, without 
having to deal with full TeX issues.
Anyone knows more about this?

 well - basically the only ports I have open are port 80 and 443. In 
 addition, our proxy is filtering/censoring certain websites (f.e. Paul 
 Ramsey's blog, for some reason is classified as evil and censored). If 
 an SSL-certificate is invalid, then the server is completely blocked. 
 SSL certificates are a bit expensive and cumbersome to install/maintain. 
 For that reason, some OS projects have invalid SSL certificates, which 
 means I cannot access them.

 Theoretically rules could be changed, but it would take weeks/months to 
 process and would require voting by the responsible persons. So 
 basically it means I have to live with the current situation (proxy and 
 ports 80/443). I have one option of opening ssh connections on port 443 
 to a server in the outside world. This allows to tunnel other ports, but 
 it is often a pain to set up ...

 Unfortunately, in our government environment, security is the top 
 requirement and functionality comes second ... I don't know why.

Hi!

Werner is right, it sounds definitely like the bug, that I hounded down in Zurich. As I'm not the author of the plugin, I don't have access to the SVN and so I'm not able to push a new version. I sent the patch to the author, but he is off until the end of the month. So probably no new version of the plugin until December. 

If necessary I may provide the patch in advance of the new version of the plugin. Just let me know.

Regards
C?dric

Hi Cedric,

thanks I would appreciate the patch, I have to give a training course in
the next days where people will be highly interested in the easy print
plugin.

Sorry to insist, but IMHO we should ask plugin authors to move their 
plugin to a common repo ASAP, so these issues can be solved in a 
collaborative way.
This will be especially important when breaking the APIs for 2.0, but as 
we are seeing it is useful also now.
All the best.

I confirm on both 1.7.1 and master under Ubuntu, but it seems to work

Can anyone make further checks and report here?

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4534

the tool is "split vector layer" not "divide vector" as in the subject.

In the New Symbology, is not what is named "Categorized" actually
Graduated and what is called "Graduated" actually Categorized?
Under "Graduated" the user must classify into n classes, which is
making n categories, while under what is named "Categorized"
the user gets a continuous color bar.

Hi all,

a QGIS/Windows user that is reporting me that her antivirus software
is detecting this virus

W32/Agent.KL.dam!Eldorado (damaged, not disinfectable,generic)

when installing qgis with the standalone installer, just downloaded

I'm not a windows user myself and in the VM I use sometimes I have no

maybe hacky but it might be an hint:
html:

script:
   alert(document.getElementById("dpiDiv").offsetHeight+"dpi");

Hi

I really think getting the client DPI with javasrcipt is not a good idea
(if possible). It will lead to weird behaviours and misunderstandings.

My point was only to be consistent with the other map servers (Mapserver
default is 72 dpi) and clients (Openlayers uses by default 72 dpi). This is
why I proposed a way to set the DPI per project.
Since there is a very easy way to tell OpenLayers how to work with 96 dpi
(as described before), this subject is not so important. As Marco
Hugentobler said "96 seems better to me since most screens have a similar
resolution"

I just downloaded and tested the installer with F-Secure and couldn't
find any viruses.

Hi Paolo, I used .po files to translate I think drupal. It is prettz

Hi Giovanni,

The virus scanner we have at work hasn't complained yet. 

Windows virus scanners are often mysterious beasts that take exception to the oddest things. 
To be sure this isn't just something weird on the users computer you would need to check against a different install of the same virus scanner. 

So my result is not a surprise. 

Do you know what virus scanner the user has?
-ramon.

I like:

1. Reduce Margins
2. Split buttons into groups
3. Reduce Min row height (could this be adjustable within a setting of
QGIS?)

Disklike:

"look for" should at least be "Search" or "Search for"

Agree or Suggestion?:
 a simple >magnifying glass search icon< for a "Search" button OR
  - Simply selecting search parameters (or typing) automagically live
searches (possible?)
  - Replace Search Button with an X button to clear search parameters

a simple >magnifying glass search icon with +< for advanced search

Onto a separate topic...

You must know your way around Designer.

I have been trying to figure out if it is possible to create an identity
window that allows direct editing within it.
I have only a couple hours after work to investigate, but between kids and
the need for sleep I don't make much progress! ^_^

Thanks for your UI design remake, It is an improvement, and if searching
can be activated LIVE then I agree a Search Button is really unnecessary.

but on the last point keep in mind that the plugin web app and (AFAIK)

Hi Paolo,

in Z?rich we made plans to migrate the latex sources to rst
(ReStructuredText). This would make editing easier and allow us to provide
the manual to html / odt / doc / pdf /... Yves gave Tim and me some insight
and after we finished the manual migration to git to be able to work on the
english version again, we would like to migrate the latex sources to rst, too
after the 1.8 release.

In this context, do you think it would be possible to prepare .po files for
rst, too?

Regards
Otto

Hi!

I am not responsible for the redmine organization .. but your suggestion 
sounds good ..
so - from my point - if we collect all webclients (currently 2) at one 
place .. it's a good idea ..
so +1 from me and go ahead until someone else is saying stop (but i 
guess that will not happen)

regards
Werner

Not sure, but I think you'll just have to create your two projects (you
can only make 'top-level' projects). After that 'somebody'(pirmin?) can
then make it a child-project or rearrange projects ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] test plugins in new plugin repo which can be
	removed?
Message-ID: <4EC39502.3080200@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

now that we use the new plugin infrastructure: there are some
'testing'-plugins which (I think) can be removed:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/TimPlugin/
(was a test of tim in lisbon, he can remove it probably)

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/FieldEvaluator/
(was a test of testuser (actually raymond) in lisbon, but we don't know
the credentials of 'testuser', so maybe Alessandro can remove it)
Raymond has a copy of it, so can continue using his own credentials if
he wants to.

TIA,

I'm not against removing it: it just does nothing.

The only reason for not doing so would be leaving it for learning
purposes as an example for who wants to start from scratches, but it
should be updated to reflect metadata.txt introduction etc..
You know, programmers like "helloworld" unuseful programs :)


BTW some in this list have admin rights in the plugins application and
can remove plugins. The plugin authors can do it as well.

Current admins are (first name listed, better don't post account names here):

Alessandro (that's me)
Gary
Tim
Martin

some other users have staff status, wich means they can approve
plugins and grant/revoke "trust" to selected users so that they can
approve their own plugins.

Current staff is:

Giuseppe
Radim

additionally, staff users can also acces the backend administration
panel, but they can't do much unless the admins give them rights to
selected actions on the system apps.

if somebody else needs admin/staff rights in the plugins app, please tell.

PS: Later I will try to summarize the changes/improvements I've done
to the plugins web app during the HF.

In principle it should only be easier, but I do not know if there are
tools ready for this.
Perhaps we should get advice from rst and po gurus around.
I think it is a crucial issue, as this would make the whole translation
process much smoother and enjoyable.
All the best.

what if instead we change a bit the overview page of redmine. It is 
pretty useless now. and it would be a good place to give an "overview" 
of the process. Then we could link to it instead of directly to the issues.

ciao Marco

There should not be a problem, now or in the past.  As I mentioned before, pyspatialite is in my Sqlite framework.  Qspatialite works for me.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Teaching with Qgis
Message-ID: <CANVKczPy-AGkTpPgk9b0wKD2aaZxW_6LUV9VLbMnoGCqmg4SBA@mail.gmail.com>

The GIS teaching in our environmental faculty here uses commercial GIS
software. There is some mumbling about introducing Open Source but
this year's students will not have the pleasure.

As I've expressed an interest in teaching with Qgis, I thought I would
have a look at some typical GIS teaching examples and see how well
they translate to Qgis. I found this very nice set of lessons:

http://www.umaine.edu/mial/int527/labs.htm

and I plan to work through them, noting annoyances, problems, etc with
doing the exercises in Qgis. If anyone else is interested in
contributing then we should set up a shared space (google docs?) for
comments and discussion.

 A few things cropped up almost instantly:

 * Qgis' vector-raster tool doesn't let you choose character
attributes (ArcGIS automatically converts characters to numbers)
 * The vector-raster output grid specification can only be given as
number of cells - you can't tell it to output the same raster grid as
an existing raster, which is what you want to do if you are going to
do overlays.
 * Having two different file selectors (one Qt, one Linux native) is
an annoyance
 * Raster layers loading as flat gray rectangles is another annoyance
- I shouldn't have to go to Properties and fiddle to see something.

Obviously I'll file bugs and enhancements in the tracker, and keep an
eye open to see how many things are targetted for the next version,
and maybe even submit some code myself. But it'll be a good exercise
to go through a set of real-world exercises in Qgis to see how it
compares.

 I know its very easy to put together a good set of teaching materials
from scratch using Qgis since you tend to show off the things that you
know are easily doable in Qgis, but starting with someone else's
materials should show how flexible Qgis is in doing GIS analysis. Or
so I hope!

 Anyone else interested?

Hi Fred, thanks for the proposal but the work on the 1.7 manual is over, 
I'm just waiting for the new git repo to be set up. However if the 
release plan works out, a new translation's campaign will begin by the 
end of december.

Hi,
Some time ago I used xmacro (a Keyboard/mouse macro utility) to create a
set of screenshots for a software (GanttProject) in about 15 languages;
then it was integrated in OpenOffice documents with relative links.
In my experience only the keyboard part was reliable, which requires to
have unique and stable keyboard shortcuts for every single menu and
dialog box, which is currently very far to be the case (improvements
here will also improve usability and user productivity). Interaction in
the map canvas is more problematic here.

There is also this from the qt manual:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.8-snapshot/gettingstarted-develop.html#testing-qt-applications
including this which supports mouse and keyboard simulation:

Barry,

There is a lot of room here since you didn't define what the focus of
your course would be and who your target audience is. There was a good
presentation at FOSS4G from a Librarian at CUNY who teaches Intro to GIS
in an 8 hour workshop.
http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/geoportal/practicum/

Then there's Richard Plant's labs for QGIS which are actually a direct
conversion of the Proprietary labs he taught in his 10 week course for
many years that focused on spatial analysis (not 100% up to date with
latest QGIS methods). He specifically brought in GRASS and R whenever a
task wasn't suited to QGIS directly.
http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/plant/qgislabs.htm

Also look up Helena Mitasova's courses that exclusively use GRASS for
advanced spatial anaylsis.

I've also been a teaching assistant for a course on GIS
scripting/informatics and we do Arc, GDAL/OGR and QGIS all via python.
Similar to the course from Utah listed on the GDAL trac site.

One note, the Grey raster on load is not unique to QGIS, got similar
issues with Arc teaching this quarter. It depends some on the Raster
file itself and the underlying libraries. I had that problem on QGIS
1.5/1.6 but it went away with 1.7 I believe due to an upgrade or fix in
GDAL.

My observation having worked with several professors on these types of
courses is that you have to define your target concepts and skills you
want students to walk away with after the course. Then tailor the
exercises to re-enforce those specific tasks. If it's an introduction
course avoid showboating of super unique features that are not
fundamental to basic GIS.

I'd be interested in discussing this more in depth and think the
OSGeo-Edu mailing list might be a better place.

Thanks,
Alex

Make them and let me know, I can re-arrange them. So we're clear, are we
talking about moving the current Web Client out from under the QGIS
umbrella? Want to make sure such a move is ok with the developers of
that tool.

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-_510F8h2VVuVe+TUUUEg65qDzy-9NCrnpz6-nBk11Pw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like, if I may, raise the topic of the current licensing of QGIS.  One
thing I have been thinking about lately is if we should change the licence
from GPL to LGPL.  I understand the motivation to use GPL at the start, as
Qt was only GPL but now that it is LPGL that is no longer an issue.



I raise this issue because I believe in order grow/improve the project
letting people build and sell apps built on top of QGIS would be a great
way to get support and development for/into the project.  I have had a few
companies I have talked to here in Australia saying they are interested in
QGIS and that deploying solutions built onto the QGIS libs would
possibility be a good move for them (and me as a client), but then I think
that QGIS is GPL and that kills their business model.



Projects like PostGIS and uDig are all under the LGPL and seem to get along
fine in this regard.  A sub department in the state government here builds
custom solutions on top of uDig, they don?t sell their software (ASFIK) but
there is nothing stopping them from doing so.



>From my understanding of the LGPL. If someone takes the QGIS libs and
builds an app on it, they are allowed to sell their product and not release
the code however if they make any changes to QGIS then they have to release
the changes.  To me this is a WIN-WIN situation.  We can keep QGIS
open/free and still stop people selling a modified version of QGIS as their
own but people can still build apps to sell to clients; at the same time if
Company A starts building onto QGIS and runs into a issue (say lack of rule
based labels) I think they would be more likely to support that development
as it helps their bottom line.

 While I can see the use of GPL, and I?m all for free all the way up and
down (in a perfect world), if I was a business owner looking to invest in a
product I wouldn?t touch it. Where as I would be happy to build onto
something like uDig (not that I?m going to) knowing that I can sell my
solution, giving the clients what they want, but not having to open my code
up.


Thoughts?



P.S I am aware that licensing is a nothing topic that can cause flame wars,
so play nice ;)

Message-ID: <CAAcYxUdeCZruJRG4=9jYW=KRGtp6Rwo9mQon_25ihxjo0HX28Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using QGIS 1.5 in a Qt application and occasionally it stops being able
to receive keyboard input at random times when a popup window is displayed.
Most of the time it works fine, but occasionally it will stop receiving
keyboard input after one of two popup windows is displayed.

The one is a simple window with a text edit and ok/cancel buttons. The
other is a custom dialog with a date/time selector. There are several tabs
in the application but I've noticed that the QGIS map is always visible
when this happens.

I'm currently running RHEL 5.6 with Qt 4.4. I'm not sure if the issue is
caused or induced by QGIS, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on
what the potentially issue could be (misuse of QGIS or something of that
sort).

Thanks,
Dave

Just to clarify, so everyone knows, nothing in either the GPL or LGPL
licenses prohibits the sale of QGIS by a vendor. In both cases the code
of the QGIS libs would however need to be made available to anyone who
"buys".

The key difference is whether a QGIS plugin, custom C++, or Python app
based on QGIS libraries would need to release their code for the part
they write separate of the QGIS core. In either scenario code that
modifies the core QGIS code must be released if the product is given out
freely or sold.

I see 2 different business models here:
1. Create closed source add-ons or custom variants of QGIS. In this case
the QGIS portion is still FOSS as always but the custom portion
essentially exists under standard proprietary licensing: pay for a
license which may or may not include time limits, support rights, number
of machines your allowed to run it on, etc. This model tends to rely on
quantity of licensing.
Example: Mac OS X

2. Create open source add-ons or custom variants of QGIS. Once paid for
the product is now contributed to the community, or available for the
community to build upon. The payday is the one time commissioning of a
specific feature (ie plugin) and the reputation of being available to do
such custom work (aka future work). Keep in mind you only have to
provide the source code to whoever hired you, it's up to them to decide
on public release. Often times this method can charge more upfront.

I would debate if LGPL has hurt uDig. I have heard some mumblings that
it may be one factor in the lower uptake of uDig when compared against
other FOSSGIS desktop applications(also debatable). It would also be
good to think about whether you consider QGIS to be a GIS application
library or a Desktop application and if both which role is more important.

I'll avoid the nit picky details that all authors who have contributed
to QGIS would have to agree to the relicense, and that even then it's
still possible for QGIS to fork with one copy staying GPL and another
becoming LGPL if anyone at all in the community disagrees.

Another angle to take, what clarifications would best help businesses
understand how to operate in world where the model is #2. Sticking with
business model #1 isn't looking to be a great long term choice in the
industry, not to mention the issues around stagnation - see the book
Innovator's Dilemna.

Thanks,
Alex

PS: I'll ask around if anyone has studied the relative success of LGPL
vs GPL specifically for end user GUI applications.

Hi Nathan


Licensing ..... the least favourite topic for most of us since half
the time we don't understand all the in and outs... see more below

First let me say it would probably be extremely difficult to change
the license as we would need to track down every contributor to the
code base and have them sign an agreement to change the license to
LGPL....

As I understand it, the GPL does not prevent people selling the
software in any way. It only mandates that the the original code and
any improvements are released under the same license as they were
received. So you could in theory take the windows installer and the
source tarball from download.qgis.org and shrink wrap it and sell it
on ebay at USD1000 a pop and some sucker out there will surely buy it
and make you rich. You could also build an app on top of the libs and
distribute that in a shrink wrapped box as long as you include your
source code, our source code and of course your customised binary.

The question you raise has been raised before and we have always said
no. The reason for this is that we want to ensure that the commitment
we have made to provide a Free and open source GIS available to
everyone does not get diluted by people further down the line who want
to essentially leverage our work without contributing anything back.

Once again, the GPL does not preclude people from selling the work so
you can do the same with QGIS if you like.

Exactly what we would like to avoid.

To me its a win-lose situation - someone else leverages the
intellectual property they take from our Free project and creates
something that cannot be Freely shared.

There is nothing stopping you selling a modified version of QGIS, as
long as you comply with the GPL and distribute all of the
modifications you have made in source form along with the binary.

I think there are plenty of business owners who would and I don't
think that supporting business owners who actually don't want to
contribute anything back to the project is a very good rationale for
us to change the license.




> Thoughts?

If there was a good rationale for changing our license to LGPL, it
would be because we want to broaden the ability of QGIS to integrate
with other proprietary software e.g. oracle spatial. However I believe
that if we are creative we can avoid this pitfall as is evidenced with
the very good way in which sybase approached us and implemented
support for SQL Anywhere.


In short from me it would be a -1 unless there was a better reason.


I see Alex has just posted a long missive in reply to this too so
perhaps he has a different perspective.\

What licenses are these released under? I can also point you to
further resources I have found if you are interested (I will need to
root around in my inbox). There is also this http://linfiniti.com/dla
which is all freely available under GPLD and CC-SA licences. It would
be really nice to create yet another git repo where we can assemble a
collection of consistenly written and styled teaching modules such
that a course presenter could collate the relevant bits into the
course he/she is presenting. It would also make a good step forward in
our certification plans as we would be able to provide solid course
material to go along with the certification programme.

Minor edit: Mac OS was a good example of the business model but a bad
example for LGPL, since it's based on BSD which an even looser license
that says do whatever you want with the code as long as the part we gave
retains it's current license.

Looking over some of the most popular FOSS software:
LibreOffice - LGPL
Inkscape - GPL
GIMP - GPL
Firefox - It's own crazy license, that's somewhere in between.
Wordpress - GPL
Filezilla - GPL
7zip - LGPL
Blender - GPL
Audacity - GPL
VLC - GPL

Enjoy,
Alex

I think I already mentioned I actually did the work for this before as
part of a 'first run' wizard (which could also be launched from a menu
I guess). Actually it just did the steop of adding the user to the
users map, but the others can be accommodated in the same way I think.
I am slightly afraid I threw the work away by accident somewhere but
will try to dig it up and apply it to master.

Martin what is the possibility of making the search tool work across

selecting the appropriate column when making a search is a common
stumbling block for many users.

Hi Nathan

GPL does not require to publish changes / plugins to everyone. E.g. say you 
create a plugin for a contractor, if you give them the binary and a source 
tarball, it's all fine with GPL, and there is no requirement for you or the 
contractor to publish the plugin to the public.

So in my experience, already with GPL, there is space to create commercial 
applications and plugins around QGIS. Two limitations that the GPL has in the 
above case are however:
- Programmer and contractor are not allowed to only publish the binary without 
access to the source code
- Programmer cannot avoid contractor to modify and distribute the plugin

In my opinion, those limitations are not too dramatic, even from a business 
point of view.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <4EC4B615.7090805@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think the projection widget should be improved, by having the search 
filtering the projections rather than moving to the next matching (as it 
happens e.g. in the plugin list). Also, it would be good to have the 
search working in both fields (people often overlook the search field 
selector). Finally, the internal projection ID could be hidden (I do not 
see any use of it for the user).
If agreed, it's a trivial change.
All the best.

Hi all.

When the same widget will be used for field calculator also?

I created a 'web clients' top level project and moved the existing one
into that. Only downside is that they will now be at the bottom of the
page. Alex or myself will move your Lizmap project (which I am looking
forward to trying out!) into that folder when you have created it.

It seems like many developers were in favor of at least allowing for
proprietary plugins back in 2006:

  http://www.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2006-September/000708.html

Perhaps licensing the API under LGPL would be feasible?

 Alex,

 No, the idea is not to move the web client away from the QGIS umbrella 
 but to include alternative web clients next to the current QGIS 
 webclient. I think Tim is taking care about it.

This is interesting take about GPL and QGIS plugins.

It means that the QGIS plugins is LGPL in this case.

If It is GPL, we the public can demand that QGIS plugin should be
available publicly both the source and binary.

Is the QGIS plugins, LGPL?

What do other thinks about Marco's interpretation about GPL and the
QGIS plugins, not available for everyone - i.e. " there is no
requirement for you or the  contractor to publish the plugin to the
public".

The GPL and LGPL only take effect on *distribution*. This means if you
build software for in-house (e.g. to be used only within your
organisation) there is no need to release the source code. So an
organisation can pay a contractor to do work for them and never make
it public.

No, they are GPL. If someone makes a plugin for the plugin, it still needs to 
be GPL.
The main difference between GPL and LGPL is that with GPL the license 
propagates to derived work. If the QGIS plugins were LGPL (which they are 
not), someone could write a plugin for the plugin under proprietary license.

Do you have a link to a GNU page or a reference to a part in the GPL license 
itself proving this interpretation?

My interpretation comes from here:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic

So, the Marco's statement is nothing to do with QGIS GPL license.

I thought that Marco is talking about QGIS. He is just talking general
terms regarding software development GPL, not particular to current
QGIS license.

Why?  The plugin is also GPL.

No.  Nobody is required to distribute at all.

But if it's done, the source code has to be shipped too.  So unless the thing is
public, only the client who got the plugin from the developer has a right to
source.

But there's nothing restricting the client to disclose it - but also nothing
requiring him to do so.   If he does gives a binary to you, you can demand the
source from him.

Paolo: make it a feature request please, so people can add stuff.

For me, for example: I would want to set the focus to the 'find' button
as soon as you try to type something into the find-text input.
Now I always find myself typing a code and then hitting <enter> without
result (because 'apply' apparently has focus: you really have to click
the <find>  button.

And why not make a general find: why must I choose between both
Authority and Name/Id. There are not so much combinations: just search
over al fields please! So we can remove the two dropdowns?

 We should be so lucky. There's no mention of licenses so I shall
assume they are copyright University of Maine and treat them with that
in mind. I'm not sure there's even any obvious licensing of the data
sets (but I would suspect they are all US public data - I'll check
before I do anything).

 Yes, I know there's a lot of good Qgis-based learning materials and
if I do put together a syllabus I'll make as much use of them as
possible. Thanks for that.

 My real interest in the UMaine courseware is in finding the bugs and
annoyances in Qgis when trying to do some specified set of analyses. I
think that when developing a course that uses software package X you
tend to do things that are easy in package X, which might well be
difficult in package Y. It would be a shame if an open-source fanboy
attending UMaine thinks "I can do all this in Qgis!" and then is sadly
disappointed when it takes him twice as long as his ArcGIS-wielding
colleagues.

 I might also try and duplicate the analyses using R - there's lots of
geospatial functionality in R and it would be interesting to end up
with one R script that does the whole course :)

+1 for Richards suggestion .. I also always hit enter after entering
something in the search field .. and see the window disappear only to be
reopened again .. And if it would be possible to "just" search either it
is EPSG code or a string that would even make that search easier ..

OK. I understand now.

However, if you sell the plugin or give it to the third party, then
this is consider - public release, right?

Thanks for the clarification.

I've read this thread with much interest, because it's a point that is
ofter discussed in some of the companies I work for and during the lessons
on Qgis.
I perfectly uderstand the rationale to mantain only a GPL license, because
LGPL would only give opportunities to third party developers without
bringing benefits back to the project. I respect this point of view from
the Qgis dev team.

Rather I was thinking about some king of dual licensing, like it is for Qt.
I know it's not a simple structure to manage, because Qgis would need a
commercial activity to mantain it (probably), but we could imagine that if
someone wants to close its own code he should pay to do it. This way we
give him an opportunity but, at least, with an economical benefit back to
Qgis which could finance its activities (bug fixing, infrastructure
mantainment, hackfests, etc.).
The difference between the Qt duel licensing and Qgis's, from my point of
view, should be that both the licenses offer exactly the same tools: in Qt,
if you pay, you can benefit of various extras. This shouldn't be for Qgis,
of course. The only diference is to give third party developers the
"freedom" to do not release their code, stop.

I know that from a conceptual point of view this still conflicts with the
idea to do not let others leaverage the community effort for their own
proprietary purposes, but I think it would be better then LGPL and could be
a way of  self-financing for the Qgis community ;)

No, it is a release to that third party only---although they retain
the rights to turn around and re-release to whomever they choose. A
"public release" usually involves posting the binaries and source code
on a publicly accessible website.

I'm not 100% sure here, the GNU faq says:

But if you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL 
requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, 
under the GPL.

'the program's user' would then be the one you hand out the binary version?

While we are on this subject, I would advice the reading of the only 
source that matters :

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html

About plugin's licensing :
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean

to sum it up, you release your plugin under any other license 
recognized as compatible :

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

And now my selfish view on the subject :
- GPL to LGPL would need agreement of every past and present 
contributor or the rewrite of their contributed code
- a dual licensing such as Qt implies that the contributor agrees to a 
Contribution License Agreement, honk if you like administravia
- giving people the possibility of releasing closed product based on a 
open product (even without direct modification to qgis) brings no 
positive return to the project, allows users and clients to be tied to 
one company, make it easier to have segmentation of the dev effort

Let's be honest here, if you give something to someone in the hope that 
someday, somehow he'll repay you then I've a good deal to offer you :)

It would be any user getting their hands on this binary. If your client 
gives a copy to his friend then his friend has the right to the source 
(it doesn't mean that YOU have to the one sending the source).

A typical example, "selling or give it to a third party" is the
Android phone / tablet. Some of the Android chinese manufacturers are
not supplying the Android Linux kernel sources for their devices.

This also applies to a lot of wireless router manufacturers before,
not supplying modified linux kernel on their routers. When you buy
these routers, you can ask for the linux kernel source code since it
is GPL.

Since we're at it, I could add that GEOS is LGPL.
The healthiest of the two being PostGIS, in terms of active community.

Hi Paolo,

Glad the users are happy with new labeling stuff and expression builder.

I'm currently playing around with a few field calculator
redesigns, mainly how I can add the new expression builder widget in there.
 I have started but don't have a ETA at the moment as I have a few other
things on my plate.

If anyone else is willing to have a play around with designs I would be
interested to see what people can come up with. Remember you must you the
widget that I designed as that is the whole point of the new widget.

- Nathan

Anyone confirms?

Found the cause: I did not select an item before activating the rotation 
tool. For some reason the popup did not com out.
All the best, and sorry for the noise.

Ok I managed to get the patch out of the closet and dust it off. Here
it is in my fork:

https://github.com/timlinux/Quantum-GIS/tree/welcome-wizard

You can test it by doing:

git remote add timlinux git://github.com/timlinux/Quantum-GIS.git
git fetch timlinux
git branch --track welcome-wizard timlinux/welcome-wizard
git checkout welcome-wizard

The user map page needs to have a separate view made just for the
wizard which excludes all the navigation stuff  (maybe Alessandro can
help with that?) so that the registration page fits more naturally
into the wizard. We can use the same technique to let the user
register with osgeo and do other things like show them news or
whathave you.

Once we have the server side sorted out I will merge to qgis master if
others are happy for me to do so...

Regards

Tim

At the moment it only points to

http://users.qgis.org/community-map/create_user_form.html

And I would like to make it work only with user registration there
before doing the other items on Paolo's wish list. So the idea would
be to create new views / templates for the QGIS embedded registration
that has no menus, page heading etc and a smaller map. The content
should also be in a div with overflow set to scroll vertically so that
the wizard page stays its  normal size.

Thanks

By the way if you are testing you need to reset

showWelcomeWizard

to 1 in ~/.config/QuantumGIS/QGIS.conf each time you run QGIS in order
to see the wizard. I guess it should be added to the help menu too...

Hi Barry,

There is an education committee for OSGeo that has teaching materials.
http://www.osgeo.org/education

Also, you might contact Charlie Schweik (chair of the committee and email
address on the page above), who I believe has used QGIS to teach at the
graduate level at UMass in Amherst, MA.

Regards,
Bob

Hi all

Thanks for your answers. I will have more time tomorrow to create the 2
projects and pass the sources through redmine. This week was a very busy
one :(

Thanks Tim for taking care of the reorganisation.

+1 to proceed with changing the main hub.qgis.org page. There is just
too much stuff... let's not bore users with latest news or latest
projects. Let's clearly state how to report QGIS bugs, how to get
account and where to look for other projects (apart from the small
"Projects" link in the header).

Hi

am I the only one here who thinks that 'first run' wizards (and tips
on start) are bad for user experience? :-)
Let's split users into two groups:
1. first time users - they do not know the software. That means they
do not feel to be a part of the community and therefore barely want to
add themselves to the user map or sign up to the users list. At the
same time the user is aware that the dialog/wizard will never be
opened again (because it's just for the first run) and by closing it
they may miss some important settings that must be set on the first
run etc.
2. common user opens qgis to do some work, not to be bothered with
some popups on startup - even if it is a new install.

Another aspects to consider:
- the wizard is used just once (and by new users) there is a
probability that bugs in the wizard will not be discovered/reported
(because the usual group of power users will not see them)
- the user may be behind a proxy (and did not have a chance to set
yet) so the online stuff will not work

Maybe a less invasive (non-modal) form of welcome wizard would be to
create a map canvas item that spans through the whole map canvas? It
could show tips, it could give links to documentation, tutorials, user
map, it could show recent planet qgis posts etc. And it could be shown
on every startup instead of a big blank space.

Martin

Hi all.
I have been pointed out to an interesting plugin:
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=6001&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&sid=e3fd633895ba6354344fe265aa1632c7&start=15
Does anybody knows more about it? Would it be possible to translate it 
and make it available?
All the best.

really nice, this would be a major feature in qgis core... maybe
reachable with a button in the table of attributes button bar.

We are at least two. My suggestion was different: expanding the current 
menu "Subscribe to the mailing list", so the user will run it if and 
when they want.
All the best.

Right, by default we should search in all columns - I also find it
tedious to always select the right column. To make it efficient we
should probably just skip the search using the expressions and
directly search for specified string within attributes of features.

I understand it *does* mean that you have to be the one sending the
source. If you distribute a GPL'd binary without source you have to
include a written offer to send the source to any party that receives
that binary, even indirectly. In general it should be easier to
include the source in the first place

This applies to LGPL'd code, too, of course. If you modify the code
itself, that is, and not merely link to it.

What I am not completely sure is if, besides the users (receivers of
modified binaries), the original copyright holders may have a right to
the modified sources, even if they haven't received a binary. Say,
programmer makes modified version of QGIS for a company, and sends it
only to them. The company has a right to the modified sources. Do the
original QGIS devs have that right, too? (if they knew there was a
modified version of the source floating around -- that would often be
kept behind closed doors, I guess)

Interesting discussion, btw. There is no code of mine involved, so I
don't really have a say in this, but if I were you, I would keep
everything GPL. At very most, the core libraries could be LGPL'd, to
make it easier to interface them to proprietary applications, while
keeping the higher level stuff (GUI, and such) GPL.

Regards,

Camilo

Sniff! My nice wizard....ok I'll put it back in the /dev/null where it
came from. Personally I don't like lots of dialogs popping up
everywhere so using the canvas space to show some information at start
really does seem like a nice idea. The idea of helping the user to
orientate themselves when they first start the app is IMHO not a bad
one though. Maybe we could show the users map on first open if the
user has a connection to the internet right there in the canvas. I was
actually speaking to a couple of people at the HF about the idea of
fusing QGIS with the web - by providing a number (extensible list
really) of online datasources that can be seamlessly edited from in
the desktop and taken offline. I know we can do this with WFS & WFS-T
or by accessing postgres on 'the cloud' or various other
techniques...anyway I am hijacking this thread a bit and rambling a
lot so I will go off and kill a poor innocent little wizard now :-)

Yeah, in general some information for first-time users would be fine,
but it shouldn't be bothering others.

Having a QGIS Server demo with the map of users would be indeed nice -
to show that we eat our own dog food. On the other hand that would add
another piece in our infrastructure that would require maintenance.

Subscription to the mailing list is a two-step process, so instead of
directly subscribing the user to the list I think we should prefer to
point him/her to the list info page to do the subscription manually:

Hi Tim,
Can I suggest adding an "all columns" item to the drop-down column
selector, rather than removing it?
"All columns" could be selected by default.

yes - I would prefer that as well. Sometimes we have to deal with very
large tables and often it would be good being able to restrict to a
certain column.

Also the same search terms may match in different columns and we only
want to search in one specific column. Well, one could use the query
builder for the same purpose, but ...

The idea of dual licensing is that they would pay up front to use QGIS
under a commercial license.  So it _would_ bring a positive return to
the project (a new source of revenue).  No need to hope to be repaid
"someday".

This doesn't sound like a bad idea to me (if you could get the agreement
of all past contributors).  Better than LGPL.  But are there actually
some good dual licensing success stories?

Are there any commercial licenses designed to only allow licensees to
create specialised applications which would not compete directly with
the freely licensed version?  A license which did that would probably be
sufficient for a client like this:
http://osgeo-org.1803224.n2.nabble.com/Qgis-custom-buil-to-read-obfuscat
ed-data-td6796238.html

Personally I think dual-licensing would be worth looking into if there
was a real demand for it.

commercial license, not with LGPL.

No, you need to supply the source to the client (or provide access to
it).  If the client provides a binary to a third party then it is them
who needs to provide the source, not you.
You don't have any relationship with the third party - you hold
copyright to some of the code, but you have granted the client
permission to redistribute it under the GPL.

No, they don't.

The use of "commercial" is not appropriate as the GPL also qualifies for 
it. Let's call it what it really is : closed.

Who will then sell the license ? The osgeo ? A new QGIS foundation ? Is 
that their roles ? I still can't see how selling closed software or 
helping a company get an advantage over one who will not take its client 
as hostages is promoting the open source gis idea.

The New Symbology doesn't have a unique value renderer which is something that is used very frequently in some disciplines.

A couple of questions for those of you fresh from the HF/planning session:

1. When will old symbology be removed?
2. Will there be a unique value renderer in new symbology?

Hi Gary




> 2. Will there be a unique value renderer in new symbology?


I agree, using the categorized symbology with a random color ramp
produces not good results (many times with adjacent polygons with the
same color), with ugly colors and is not straightforward to
use/understand as the unique value renderer.


> 1. When will old symbology be removed?
> 
I hope not before all the features that are available in the old one are
ported in the new one. I also give many training courses and what people
is mainly missing are:

*) the overall transparency slider for all the renderers other then the
unique value. Actually in master you can select multiple
classes/categories, right click and choose the transparency (that by the
way is defined with a 0.0-1-0 interval, where the slider is 0-100%) but
again is not very handy (when having many classes) and not very
intuitive

*) in the old selecting multiple symbology classes allowed the user to
change the symbol for all that classes in one go. In the new symbology
you can select multiple classes but, if the button "change" is click
then the symbol options are applied only to one of the classes

This feature is a most have too. For example when you have to modify the
border width of all the classes. At present, you have to modify them one by
one or delete them all and recreate them (or open the qml style file if you
are a power user and use search&replace tools ;)

+1 to not to remove old symbology until we have 'unique value'. I use
this every day.

Hello,

We can extract text from rst or latex into po files. There are many tools for 
this and ui web app in Python to manage it. I have no link as I am moving now. 
If you are really interesting about this I can find them (Francophone ML hava a 
thread about this also).

I am not sure this is the best way to process anyway.

+1 and it would be great if I could limit the list of projections to the
ones relevant to my work - usually less than 10. I don't need to see
projections for the whole world.

thanks

Reading the context, this is only the case if you choose to distribute 
the binaries without source (but with a written offer to get the sources 
from you). If you distribute the binaries together with source, you 
should have no further obligations.

Message-ID: <MWSJHBMC033cf8fc64578d4278becf446091f4c5b4@MWSJHBMC03>

Hi All,

I find that the internal projection ID is important when working with User Defined Coordinate Systems. In these cases there is no Authority ID and being able to see the internal projection ID is necessary when moving QGIS projects between different computers. User defined coordinate systems are not always defined in the same order on different computers, resulting in the same user defined system having different IDs on different computers.

When loading projects QGIS seems to match up user defined systems by ID and not the name, which causes problems when moving projects between computers. In these cases it is important to see the IDs in order to match up the user defined systems when opening a project on another computer.

Example: Computer 1 has a user defined system called Lo31 with an internal ID of 10000 and a system called Lo33 with an ID of 10001. Computer 2 also has user defined systems of Lo31 and Lo33 but these have IDs of 10001 and 10000, respectively (because they have been defined in a different order to computer 1). If a project using Lo31 is moved from computer 1 to computer 2, QGIS on computer 2 assigns the project a CRS of Lo33, which is wrong.


Frank.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Projection widget improvement
Hi all. 
I think the projection widget should be improved, by having the search 
filtering the projections rather than moving to the next matching (as it 
happens e.g. in the plugin list). Also, it would be good to have the 
search working in both fields (people often overlook the search field 
selector). Finally, the internal projection ID could be hidden (I do not 
see any use of it for the user). 
If agreed, it's a trivial change. 
All the best.

Hi all

Does anyone have  problem withthis?:

https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/63

This commit moves the providers into their own dir
(lib/qgis/providers) instead of mixing them with plugins. The reason
for this is to have a cleaner installation layout and to reduce noise
and possible issues when loading plugins to test if they are
providers.

I'm not sure if this is totally relevant, but I'm going to point out that on the OSGEO versions of the Windows install, qgis-dev recently took to using GRASS RC2. This carefully uninstalled RC1, causing a non-fatal error in the qgis.bat file.

If the 1.7.2 branch happened after that point (and I'm not sure on the timing - which is why I'm not sure it's relevant) then the qgis.bat file needs updating to reflect this.

Any target date?

	polygon
Message-ID: <11C72C89-422D-454F-9D38-3D75F45A119F@westnet.com.au>

Hi there,

I was nosing around this message on the -user mailing list http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-November/014386.html
and started noticing something odd.

On my OSGEO windows install of 1.7.1 if I select a single outline polygon, it changes the visible[1] parts of the outline to the selection colour.
On my MacOS install (Thanks William) 1.7.1 it leaves the outline alone and fills the shape.
I think on linux it behaves like the windows version.

These are all nominally 1.7.1 packaged versions, using the new symbology.

Can anyone else confirm this?

Thanks,
-ramon.


[1] if there's adjacent polygons that are rendered later (higher?) in the layer then the highlighting doesn't show, leaving potential for an unhighlighted selection.

Hi, thank you Richard for your simpleSVG plugin; it's fine

Teaching in french universities of geography with QGIS, we need of a SVG
export for Inkscape, to realize nices maps.

I wrote before a plugin for mapinfo to illustrator, then begun mapinfo to
SVG.

I ' like to contribute performing this simpleSVG ( I have a version of 2011
06 16) :

-          Working with mapunits, scales.

-          Symbology with opacities.

-          Reals rasters incorporated and not exported in low res.

-          ./.

Do exist a working group to develop together???

 

Best regards

 

Fred

Hi all

I have just created the Lizmap Web Client project. One problem though : I
have not the rights for moving it under Qgis Web Clients. I thought I would
be able to do it after creating it, but no...
I have to create the "Lizmap Plugin" project too under "User plugins", but
I will have the same problem, so I prefer to wait for someone to give me
the rights to create a sub project of one project.

Another question : is it possible to use mercurial as versionning tool ? I
have searched it in the list, but only SVN and Git appears...

I need to spend some time on documenting Lizmap projects (screen grabs, how
to, etc.)

Thanks in advance,
Kimaidou

Just add it and tell me when you have done it and I will move it under
the web clients folder too.

The best way would be to open a git instance for plugins, and allow interested devs.

Hi Fred,

Sure :-)

I just uploaded the plugin from my personal subversion to the plugins
hub on hub.qgis.org:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/simplesvg

Please get an osgeo-account and I can add you as a developer

I'm actually busy with some other functionalities, but please branch and
hack away  ;-)

Maybe we should add your wishes to the wish list

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Ramon,

I saw there is some discussion going on about how to show or not show
selections of polygons also in an issue: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4553

Maybe good to start some discussion page somewhere on the wiki?

One (maybe tricky?) way would be to put all selections on top in some
kind of memory layers... though the bookkeeping of that layer is maybe
hard (removing items when changing visibility?, how to handle huge
selections? etc etc)?

Somebody aware of the way other desktop gis applications are handling this?

Tim,

Thanks for having moved the "Lizmap Web Client" project under the "Web
clients" project.

I have just created a "Lizmap Plugin" project. Please move it under "User
plugins". Thanks in advance !


 I added mercurial support too (untested).
>

Thanks. A problem though : Mercurial support in Redmine is not very good.
The only way to have a repository is :
* create an folder somewhere in the server, and clone from my repository
here using SSH (So I will need to have full access to the server, which is
the wrong way...)
* Then Redmine will refresh the repository each time a user reads the
repository tab.
* Pbm : it will only be read access through redmine (just showing list of
commits) : Redmine does not give any pull nor push rights binded to redmine
users

Conclusion : Mercurial is not a good choice in Redmine if the server does
not belong to you :)  I do not knwo yet which other solution I will use :
* use bitbucket and just give a link in qgis hub
* use Git for full integration

Regards
Kimaidou

I'm not sure if redmine can be set up so that a user can only delete
their own created projects. If not we would need to use some other
approach e.g. file a ticket.

According to your profile, you have 'manager' role which should allow
you to create subprojects. Can you post me a screenshot of what you
see under:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/<your project>/settings ?

Thanks

In general the same issues exist with other protocols I think. I don't
know mercurial well enough to offer further advice. Pirmin would
probably be in a better position to help.

Hi

I think the right question is : do we allow anyone to create subproject of
any project or not. For now, subproject for "normal" user (as I am) can
only be created under project I own.

In my example, I had to ask Tim to move my 2 projects "Lizmap Plugin" and
"Lizmap Web Client" under the good subprojects, since I could not create
them directly under the "User plugin" or another already existing project.

I think it is not that bad, as Tim (or other administrator) can control
what is done on redmine a priori so that things do not become messy. The
drawback is that one plugin developper must ask a peson in charge to move
his project any time one needed to be created.

So the answer depend on the amount on new plugins created in redmine per
week :)

Cheers

This seems like a serious limitation in the ACL.
I won't use something I can't control... but maybe it's just me.

Thank you Tim for helping.

More generally speaking, if we want to push plugin authors to use the
central hub we need to make this app work really smoothly. We cannot
pretend that a user creates a project then start opening tickets every
time he need to change something: frustration guaranteed.

I like uniformity and simplicity, so if it's not too bad for you I would suggest
moving to git.

There are hundreds of redmine plugins out there, probably there is one
to let users delete their projects. I still wonder if it is a good
idea for other reasons though - if I file a bug against your project
and spent time and effort on working with your plugin I may not want
to see my work on your redmine project dissapear overnight because you
became bored with it. Better in my mind that an admin delete it after
giving it some consideration.

But from your own new project on the settings tab, do you not have an
option to choose what the parent of the project is?

Yes, but I can only choose between "QGIS Desktop" and "QGIS Django Site".

Agreed, I think we should always keep the code, unless there are really very good
reasons (e.g. it is malicious). Better add a tag <deprecated> if you do not want
people using it, but it will always be interesting for historical and teaching purposes.
All the best.

also agree .. projects (plugins) should not disappear .. they should be 
rather there (probably orphaned) and ready for a new maintainer ..
maybe moved to a "orphaned/not maintained any more" section

In that case (which it's a corner case) you'd probably have the code
in GIT anyway or at least the plugin installed on your disk and you
could still create a new project.

Sorry but I was referring to the bug tracking history relating to the
plugin, not the code (I realise I have the code already). The history
of what issues people report against the plugin and what resolutions
took place and why is useful information that should persist should
e.g. a new maintainer take over the plugin because the former one got
bored.

It looks like the reason you can change your project to a subproject
of QGIS Desktop is because you are listed as a manager of that
project. So it seems that the rule is : you cant make your project (A)
a subproject of (B) unless you are at least a manager of (B). This
probably makes good sense because otherwise we give everyone perfect
freedom but also have potential anarchy e.g. users just inserting
their project as a child of yours without consulting you.

So I think the workflow should be that when a user wants to create a
new project, it should always go under plugins, and if that is the
wrong place they should file a ticket.

Tim

As soon as Mathias some hours left (should be next week), he will write a 
plugin for customizing Redmine to QGIS' needs. The most important things I 
currently see:
-Don't show members of project, if more than 50 (#3983)
-Make "User plugins" the default parent project for new projects (#3956, 
#4545)
-Hide Repository link on Overview page (currently implemented as patch)

That would probably do it thanks. Do you know of anyway to modify the
landing page? There was some interest in getting rid of latest
projects, latest news and providing a more user friendly getting start
guide on the front page.

Easiest way would probably be to set a project wiki page (e.g. QGIS or Quantum 
GIS Desktop) as Home page like redmine.org does.

Message-ID: <a77a6703915311eff5d12dc360c46269@carto.net>

 Hi Python devs,

 I am looking for an example with the correct syntax for setting a 
 Postgis connection with SSLmode = SSLdisable.

 I tried:

 pgUri = QgsDataSourceURI()
 pgUri.setConnection("servicename","dbname","username","pw",QgsDataSourceURI.SSLmode.SSLdisable)

 but the last part with the SSLdisable does not work.

 Do you know how to correctly set SSL to disable with Python?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

yes, this is the current approach, we can easily keep it, jus adding the other

So I followed the instructions at

howerver I cant import qgis....I can however import PyQt4. Similarly,
if I run the command line python from the osgeo4w shell I get the same

Any suggestions/fixes/workarounds would be greatly appreciated!

Just a technical curiosity: why pyqgis rendering should be slower then
qgis? The loading and rendering are performed by the C++ code, and I don't
see where python plays an inpacting role...

That's where the 'recently used crs's' block is for?

(see http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4550)
I've now a version with a filter line on top: which will filter both
lists/trees while typing (like python plugin menu).

It will look like this

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the release of QGIS 1.7.2
Message-ID: <4ECB7018.7070109@gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Developers, Users and Supporters!

We are pleased to announce that QGIS 1.7.2 is now available. This is a 
bugfix release over version 1.7.1. A detailed changelog is available on 
our home page[1].

Binary downloads[2] are already available but some are still making 
their way to the download page so if you don't see your preferred OS 
there please check again in a day or two.

Thanks to bug reporters who have reported bugs using upgraded issue 
tracker[3] and special thanks to all developers who fixed those reported 
bugs.

As always, if you find a bug please report it on [3].

QGIS is the collaborative effort of many coders, translators, 
documentors, bug reporters and other community members.

QGIS continues to have great momentum - we recently branched the code 
base for an upcoming release of QGIS 1.8.0 and we are about to break API 
compatibility in our 'master' branch to start us down the road towards 
the eventual release of QGIS 2.0. If you enjoy using QGIS and are able 
to, please consider sponsoring our project - the money you donate helps 
us to run our developer meetings and generally keep the project moving 
forward. You can find more details on how to sponsor QGIS on our home 
page[4]. QGIS recently obtained it's second Silver Sponsor for 2011! 
Thank you Kanton Solothurn, Switzerland (Silver Sponsor from April 
2011)[5] and the State of Vorarlberg, Austria (Silver Sponsor from 
November 2011)[6], your financial help is greatly appreciated!

Message-ID: <CAL5Q671Vww7O8LWhQ=O1FsiogdXy-yKC=Sx1pMP2KJoDuX1CvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today I've added a couple of new fields and features to the web app:


-    Added tracker, repository, deprecated (#18, #19, #4265)

those new fields are optional but a warning is issued if thy are
empty, the message also suggests to create a repository on
hub.qgis.org
the deprecated field marks the plugin with red in the lists and in the
details view

-    Added new plugin fields to the XML

the plugins.xml file also shows the new fields

-    Enabled DB cache

DB caching for anonymous users is now active

-   Added the ajax template, which only shows the inner page content
-   Added IS_NAKED context var for ajax/frameless calls

This can be used to implement "naked" views, just add ajax=1 to the
query string, for example:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickWKT/?ajax=1

-    Fixed some validation errors and improved error messages

Error messages are now more verbose and try to suggest a solution for
most common errors

-    Added page titles vary on application!

Plugins, Snippets etc. can now have different page titles


Bug reports and suggestion are welcome.

Less than 10 but certainly more than 4, especially when qgis creates user
defined entries for unknown or undefined crses. The recently used set will
be lost. Most of the time I only need a set of crses for the area of
interest I'm working on. I don't need to see the crses for other parts of
the world. Just a suggestion to make things easier.

I look forward to testing your version with filter.

agreed, IMHO 6 to 8 should be ok for most people (unless we want to introduce yet
another obscure option ;) ).
maybe we could list all the recently used CRSs, so an user could scroll down?
All the best.

Hi,

I agree, the scale is also broken in 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 (at least using
projected CRSs), while is fixed in master.

There is 'categorized symbol' renderer which is meant to act also as a
unique value renderer in old symbology.The categorized renderer is
just more general - instead of a 'fixed' random color generator you
can use colors from any color ramp - currently either a gradient or a
random colors (using a subset of color space).

The assignment of colors for adjacent polygons is not addressed in
neither old nor in new symbology.

Ugly colors? The colors depend on the type of random color ramp you
use - a color ramp having colors with higher saturation will look
better.

Maybe the only issue is the usability - you need more steps to produce
an equivalent of unique value renderer. That may be addressed, some
ideas how to do it would be welcome.

Some time ago we started a wiki page which was supposed to list what
features were present in old symbology and not present in new
symbology:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Switching_from_Old_to_New_Symbology_and_Labeling
Unfortunately it turned out very quickly to a wishlist. I would
suggest cleaning all wishes and completing missing functionality.

You may add that as a feature request...

Umm... the original idea was that the button "change" is just for
changing the _source_ symbol, not actual selected symbol(s) in the
list. This seems to be quite misleading to people and we should do
something with it... I refer to the whole thing about selecting source
column/ramp/symbol - we discussed it on the list with Marco recently.

Maybe a better approach would be:
1. when categorized/graduated renderer is first selected in combo box,
it will only show the widgets needed to do classification
2. after classifying those widgets would be hidden (or minimized), not
to confuse people, while allowing more space for the list at the same
time

Using random colors seems I'm having trouble getting unique colors for every class. The unique renderer seems to give me better results. Am I missing something?

Hi Tim

+1 from me. Recently I have been looking at the difference in speed if
the plugins and providers were split. With clear file system cache the
initialization of provider registry took ~1.8s with providers+plugins
in one directory, only ~0.9s with just providers in the directory.

For 2.0 we could maybe load the providers (and plugins) only on demand
to further save some time - only a directory list would be fetched on
startup, the libraries would be loaded when a first layer would be
loaded...

That may have something to do with the random color ramp you use -
maybe the amount of classes in renderer is higher than the number of
classes in random color ramp?

I admit the random color ramp is somehow unfinished - it requires you
to define a number of colors, but later it does not allow you to save
the generated palette.

Something else that fits in with this provider separation - providers are not shared libraries.  Any shared code should be put in a library.  This should be made clear in the developer docs and enforced.

The GRASS plugin in master is essentially broken on OS X because the provider is linked as a shared library, even with my partial fix:

	3pm CET today
Message-ID: <20111123083643.57ff5c25@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear community,

we are going to migrate the QGIS wiki from MediaWiki to Redmine today. This
means we will set the current MediaWiki to read-only this afternoon at 3pm
CET and will announce the URL to the new wiki and other changes as soon as
finished the migration. 

There will be some work to polish the results of the migration script. And
instead of your "old" user accounts, you will need a valid osgeo ID, as for
the bugtracker etc.

If you want to edit in the wiki but need a osgeo ID, please create an account
here: https://www2.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_create_user.py

The migration will hopefully be done tomorrow, so we hope that editing in the
new wiki will be available soon again.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Kind Regards
Otto

Do you have a way to query the bug tracker for of bugs worth

Yeah - I have .. git and my eyes ;) and trying to backport - If it
does not work - try to invest some time - if that does not work either
- go on to the next candidate ..
So unless devs are not marking a bugfix as backportable I am a bit
stuck .. but am trying my best ..

How about adding a "Target Version" = "1.7.3" in the hub ?
The latest version is currently 1.7.2

Also, I see it's not possible to translate a set of filters into
an URL for sharing (on the list, for example, or IRC).

Beside, open issues with "Target Version" = "1.7.2" are 48, 36 of which
in the "bug" tracker, and only 5 of which in the Status "feedback".

I guess the release process could benefit from using the existing tools
more and eventually improving the tools.

Hi,

the QGIS wiki is now set to read-only. You can still login, but if you want
to edit you get following message:

"Warning: The database has been locked for maintenance, so you will not be
able to save your edits right now. You may wish to cut-n-paste the text into
a text file and save it for later.

The administrator who locked it offered this explanation: This wiki is read
only at the moment"

 Hi,

 I am trying to get a list of layers that are the children of a group 
 with a certain group index (or even better by layer name).

 I can't figure out how to do this properly with the QgsLegendInterface 
 object.

 Does one have a piece of code how to accomplish this?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

 Well all have a piece of code that does that :) Qgis is open source,
so we've all got the source...

 And we have the documentation. I had a look at the qgis api docs:

http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsLegendInterface.html

 - all the 'children' methods that you maybe tried are Qt things, and
so irrelevant and not listed, But that groupLayerRelationship method
looks interesting:

>>> l.groupLayerRelationship()
[[PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u''),
[PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'NER_adm020111123150216751')]],
[PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'group'),
[PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'NER_adm320111123150216816'),
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'NER_adm220111123150216800'),
PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'NER_adm120111123150216790')]],
[PyQt4.QtCore.QString(u'foobar'), []]]


Seems to be a nested list of layer names (as QString objects). If you
can unravel the output above, it starts with an empty root string,
then I've got a layer, a group with three layers, and then and empty
layer. You'll soon grok it.

 So just find the element of the group you are interested in and do a
depth-first or breadth first search to whatever depth you want.
Simples!

 Thanks Barry,

 I figured the method "groupLayerRelationship" and saw that it contains 
 a list of childLayers.

 I am trying to figure it out. It seems a bit complex to use for me. In 
 web development I do a lot of tree traversals in the DOM and seems much 
 easier to me ...

 But I also read that the QgsLegendInterface API grew over time and 
 needs some overhauling ...

 Thanks for the pointer!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] My first QGIS plugin
Message-ID: <CACbtZwT49EL5ekPV+BL49AgizR4of_nn0=gGvFo-hVowdHu_qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Community,

I have written my first QGIS plugin, which is a Qgis interface of the
Indian Meterological Department's hourly weather data site
www.imdaws.com/ViewAwsData.aspx .

The working of the plugin is explained in simple terms here (
www.arunmozhi.in/2011/11/imdaws-my-first-qgis-plugin/ ) in my blog.

I would love to have feedback from you all.

I am dreaming of things like making this more useful by developing it
further to encompass more AWS(Automatic Weather Station) data sites of
various countries. But I am unsure of the availability of such data and
furthermore about its uses. Kindly share your thoughts.

Hi Andreas

It can be done using QgsProject::instance()->writeEntry(...). You may 
look in the class src/app/qgssnappingdialog.cpp how QGIS does it.

Marco

Hi P.Arunmozhi,
well done


> Kindly share your thoughts.

this is what I see after a quick look:

the plugin is missing the icon for the plugin toolbar

it would be nice if it can import directly the downloaded csv files

and also it would be nice to warn the user if the selected date/state is
producing an empty dataset.

cheers

 Hi Marco,

 With Google I came across your project's code already.

 In my opinion it should be possible to easily get a layer and group ref 
 by id and from there traverse to parent/child/siblings - just like in a 
 webpage DOM.

 Maybe something we should sponsor next year ;-)?

 If I set the Project settings - are the snapping settings automatically

Hi Andreas

yes the current legend interface is kind of quick and dirty solution.

My hope is that in 2.0 the legend will be based on model/view
architecture, being more modular and reusable - therefore it will be
possible to access the items (groups/layers) directly without having
to use intermediate classes like the legend interface.

Hi,

looks great - thanks a lot Pirmin! So I assume we start, clean up first, see
what wiki pages we want to keep/remove, update content and make all links
work again. Any help is very appreciated. If there are questions, please
write/discuss on the qgis-community-team list.

And again, if you want to edit in the wiki but need a osgeo ID, you
can create an account here:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why is scrolling in the attribute table so slow?
Message-ID: <0177e7c1d8fef17c30748efaf626c2ce@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I am wondering why scrolling in the QGIS attribute table is so 
 extremely slow.

 My attribute table is not very big: 351 rows by 23 columns. I have a 
 rather fast machine (Core i7, 8GB RAM, Win7),

 The same table in pgAdmin scrolls very fast (like in Excel or 
 Openoffice), in QGIS, the refresh rate while scrolling vertically is 
 approx. once per second, when scrolling horizontally I get an update 
 every 2 seconds? Too slow for my taste and my users.

 Is there any room for improvements?

 I think this is a serious issue if already such small tables are so 
 slow. Real data can have hundreds of thousands of records or millions 
 ...

 Thanks if you have any ideas.

 Andreas

Andreas,

If your using PostGIS there seems to be some open/close connection bug.  If
you look at the debug log for QGIS while you click, scroll or do anything
in a PostGIS backed datasource you will see a lot of database requests.

I haven't filed a bug yet but I will if you can confirm the same on your
end.

- Nathan

Odd, anything else special about the table?  I just picked a parcel layer with
~300k rows (but just 7 columns) from PostgreSQL and I don't see that problem.

The attribute table only initially loads the ids of the features and lazy loads
the actual data when it's needed using featureAtId.

when copying/pasting rows from the table of attributes to another
program (ex: calc) the column with the geometry is also included (it
would be good an option to avoid that).

This seems to me (but I can be very well wrong) this is the cause of the
very slow scrolling and selecting in the table of attributes: if the
geometry are complex, even with a few rows (regardless if it is postgis
or else) it becomes painfully slow.

Cheers

 thats interesting - the same table in Spatialite or Shape scrolls much 
 faster (at least 10 times faster)

 so yes - it seems to be related to the PostgreSQL datasource.

AFAICS the attribute table's model caches only one feature, instead the
view usually displays more than one feature.

When the user scrolls vertically (but also horizontally) the model asks for
all the displayed features w/o using the cached one because it isn't the first
asked for, so it's replaced by another one.

So if the view displays 4 rows then the model asks for 4 feature (and the
provider executes 4 queries), both scrolling vertically by one row and
horizontally by one column.

If your attribute table displays more rows this may become a
problem (unless the data in the fetched rows are few bytes or the
connection is fast).

The solution may be to have a cache growing or shrinking its size
based on the view's row displayed count or bigger enough to avoid
the problem. In both cases we should consider to add a refresh button
to invalidate the cache.

I know that Pete (in cc) was looking deep into and (maybe) working
on that at the HF in Zurich.

@Pete: Any good news?

 It is actually a view where the join is based on multiple columns.

 I tested with another Postgis table with 16000 records which is only a 
 table and not a view and it performs much faster than the small view 
 with 350 records.

 So is it correct that the QGIS table only loads the "visible" portion 
 of the data and if one scrolls, additional layers are requested from the 
 provider? Maybe my view definition is slowing things down that much. I 
 have to see if I can improve it.

 On the other hand smaller tables would probably easily fit into memory.

Hi,

I've uploaded and tested the XML-RPC sutff on the server.

The webservice accepts both XML-RPC and JSON-RPC, the endpoint (with
self-built documentation) is at:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/RPC2/

An example script to upload a plugin is available at:

https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis/plugins/utils/plugin_upload.py

There is just a single method implemented so far:
plugin.upload
it creates a new plugin or updates an existing one.

other methods can be easily added.

Happy testing :)

 diving deeper into the problem. The view is even a view based on views. 
 So there is a lot of joining going on on the PostgreSQL. If I load 
 anything at once it loads relatively fast, but incrementing/scrolling 
 through this view is probably very inefficient. So for this small view 
 it would be very benefitial if all could be cached in memory.

I was just helping out a senior of mine at college for his project which
required data state wise. Hence I haven't decided any geographic extend of
this project. If there are similar sources which produce daily or hourly
AWS data, I would be more than happy to extend the coverage to the maximum
extend possible.

The web interface of the IMD AWS site gives the option to download it in
variety of formats like, district level, state level and also for the
entire nation. You could have noticed the "All States" option in the plugin.

As said previously, this was written with just a single source [
www.imdaws.com/ViewAwsData.aspx ] in mind.

If you/users could come up with a list for similar sites, I will write the
code to integrate the downloading of data from those sites to QGIS for
direct import.

The attribute table has two strategies how to access the data. For
providers that support fast access to features by ID (that is, it does
not have to go sequentially through the layer)  it only loads the list
of IDs and fetches the features when necessary. For providers without
fast access to features by ID it caches all features' attributes in
memory.

PostGIS supports fast access by feature ID, so the first approach is used.

It would be good to use 'EXPLAIN' to see what is going on in the
database - then probably adding some indices on columns of joined
tables will speed things up significantly.

You do not need to reinvent the wheel in order to load a delimited
text layer. You can easily load the data automatically with delimited
text provider, this is a snippet from PyQGIS cookbook:

uri = "/some/path/file.csv?delimiter=%s&xField=%s&yField=%s" % (";", "x", "y")
vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri, "layer_name_you_like", "delimitedtext")

At least it could be an option - a checkbox for automatic import would help.

 yes - it is quite a complex view. Around 20 tables are involved and for 
 the joins I am also using concatenations and regexp functions.

 Although the view involves a lot of tables with quite a bit of data, 
 the result is actually really small (350 records) so I wonder, if for 
 situations like this, if there couldn't be a user-defined option telling 
 QGIS to load all data at once and cache it.

 But yes - it is probably also my homework to improve the view 
 definition and indexes ...

If your view is complex to compute but evaluates to a small extent, you
should consider materializing it on the server side.  Materialization makes
a lot of sense for a view that is read much more often than the underlying
data is updated.  Materialization on the server side rather than in an
application-layer cache allows the cache to be shared both by heterogenous
applications and by concurrent user connections.

Unfortunately, Posgres does not have built-in support for materialized
views.  However, it is possible to roll your own and keep it up to date
either eagerly (incremental maintenance via synchronous triggers) or lazily
(periodic recomputation).  See the two excellent tutorials linked from this
page: http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Materialized_Views

 yes - good idea. "Materializing" this particular view would make a lot 
 of sense I think. The underlying tables are probably updated once per 
 week.

 I see that "materialized views" are top on the uservoice wishlist for 
 PostgreSQL ...

 Thanks!

 it helps for repeated scrolling. Initial scrolling is equally slow than 
 before, but if I scroll back and forth to records that had already been 
 viewed, it scrolls faster.

 Thanks, J?rgen!

Message-ID: <CALuHMPCtoLCEyj1u_K8-6F3kTntcTOxF18C80zf=DsxgdnAa6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

and sorry for crossposting. My colleague have problems with Python
support in QGIS
under 32-bit Ubuntu 11.04 At QGIS startup he gets

Warning: Couldn't load Python support library: Unable to load library
/usr/lib/qgispython:
    (/usr/lib/libqgispython.so: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory)

and there is no libqgispython.so in /usr/lib. After creating symlink
with necessary name
ln -s /usr/lib/libqgispython.so.1.9.90  /usr/lib/qgispython.so
we get another error

Warning: Couldn't load Python support library: Unable to load library
/usr/lib/qgispython:
    (/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0: undefined symbol: forkpty, version GLIBC_2.0)

We try to export LD_PRELOAD befor running QGIS as suggested in IRC
(thanks, Gary)
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libutil.so but this don't help.

Any ideas how to solve this problem?
32-bit Ubuntu 11.04, QGIS 1.9.90 from nightly repo, all previous QGIS
versions are removed

Hi Otto,

While not exactly the same, your problem sounds related to problems I've 
had with rpy2, QGIS and ManageR on openSUSE 11.4 64-bit.

At least at some point libRlapack.so shipping with R-base RPM for 
openSUSE 11.4 (and at least 11.2 and 11.3 before that) was built with 
incompatible version of libgfortran. I managed to find the details once, 
but didn't find them again, sorry.

I got everything working on openSUSE 11.4 (64 bit), but this required 
building R from source. You can try the following (or at least steps 2 
and 3 if rpy2 just doesn't find your libR):

1. build R (2.14.0) from sources with --prefix=/usr and --enable-R-shlib 
and flags

2. try "from rpy2 import robjects". If you get an import error with 
"libR.so not found", add a file R-x86_64.conf into /etc/ld.so.conf with 
a single line:

/usr/lib64/R/lib (or where ever your libR is located)

3. run ldconfig as root

4. Install rpy2 (2.2.4) with pip (or easy_install)

Hope this helps,

Joona

Hi Alexander,

I've seen this on my laptop also. Often full remove of the build
directory solves this problem for me...

And is he/she trying to run it from the build directory itself? Maybe
trying the make install step?

He used QGIS from Ubuntu nightly repo, not self compiled one.

I noticed the same problem:

with the GRASS plugin installed, no python support

remove the GRASS plugin and python is back

Hi Otto,

I think Joona's directions should get you going... I suspect that the
packged version of R for OpenSUSE isn't built with the
--enable-R-shlib flag, so it can't be used as a shared library.
Building from source should sort this out. If not, please do let me
know, and hopefully we can try to figure out something else.

Hi,

thanks a lot for your help. I sent a mail to the opensuse packager and asked,
if he can add the --enable-R-shlib flag. Hopefully that will make it work.

Otto

Ziegler,

Just thought I would let you know.  I added a method a while ago that
will hopefully help making map books using composer layouts a bit easier.
 I added a composer item id which you can assign in the UI and then
reference in the code.  The ID/Name is just a string so you can use any
convention for naming you composer items, any composer item can have a
id/name e.g you could name a map frame "overview" and then reference this
to put the overview window in that map frame; or name a text label "Title"
and then put the map title in there.

The method is called QgsComposerItem::id() and you can get to it using
Python or C++.

Would love to see EasyPrint use composer layouts to generate map books, I
know a lot of users would love it. Hopefully this will help you.

- Nathan

Ok If there are no objections from anyone I think it would be good to get
started on this, even if we don't use the logo until 2.0 it would be good
to have it before the 2.0 release so we can redesign material around it e.g
website colors, press material.

I'm going to draft up a blog post to see if we can pull some donations from
people. Anita and Tim if could do the same that would be good.

@Paolo: What is the best way to collect money for just this kind project,
if people are donating for this then it would be good that they know the
money is getting used
for this.

+1 I think it's good to get started while we still have enough time to

Two ways:
- we set up another PayPal scheme for this (not recommended, as it 
requires some admin work)
- ask people to note that their donation is meant for this
I can take care of making a separate budget entry for it.
All the best.

Agreed. IMHO it would be good to have it as a standard function in QGIS.

Hi all.

In current trunk, the help does not work in languages other than en_US. 
The following message is displayed:

===
This help file does not exist for your language:

/usr/share/qgis/resources/function_help/sin-en_US

If you would like to create it, contact the QGIS development team
===
I appreciate the effort in having people helping with translation, but 
this is inconsistent with the translation of other strings, where the en 
version is displayed if the translation is missing.
Perhaps it is just the strings that have to be updated?
Thanks, and all the best.

HI all, I somehow missed tis thread :/
Python fot android QGIS would be nice, but is not high priority YET. I 
need to get many other things working before adding such complexity. but 
I think the move to 2.0 would be a good moment for this. Having to port 
and mantain PyQt would add an incredible burden to the whole thing. so 
Pyside could be nice.
What do other python guru think?

PySide is compatible with __Version 2__ of the PyQt API. QGIS uses
Version 1 which is incompatible. This could be changed, but would
temporarily break all Python bindings and plugins as all instances of
`QString` and `QVariant` would have to be removed and replaced with
regular Python strings and objects.

It may be a good idea in the long run to make the switch---all
Enthought backed scientific Python projects are moving to PySide and
thus Version 2 of the API along with other modules such as Matplotlib.
It would be great if these PySide/PyQt components were available for
use in QGIS plugins as it would lead to less time spend re-inventing
scientific GUI wheels and more time spent doing awesome stuff with
spatial data.

Hi Paolo

in this particular case of function_help strings even the english text
is missing - only few functions are documented. The function
documentation is waiting for some volunteers to contribute... anyone
interested may have a look at the resources/function_help files and
add further docs.

Martin


These are pretty standard functions. Probably there are already descriptions available in other sw.
All the best.

I am just wondering what is wrong with the current QGIS icon/symbol?

Are there some complaints about it's design?

It currently seems simple, scalable, representative,
and recognizable amongst those who currently are using QGIS.

The actual logo is very difficult to read at small size (32x32 and 
16x16) because of the font used and all the details (gradient, shadow, 
arrow). The SVG source file is a mess (non-blending parts, incoherent 
shadow) and not scalable. And I would add that integrating the logo into 
a modern-looking publication makes people die somewhere, I'm pretty sure 
that's a fact.

Not sure anything looks good at 16x16 except my favourite colour. ^_^

Maybe you are right on the source file and svg issues of blending, I have
never spent much time on Windows or Linux looking at the QGIS logo,
but it scales and blends nicely on OSX.

What are some Logo examples that people think are more "professional
looking"?

I always thought it was one of the best icons and logos I'd ever seen.
Glad I'm not the only one who likes it ;)

No one decided and no a single person will, I made a proposal 3 months 
ago, talks have been going on, several persons want to set up an art 
contest where users can vote. You can hardly make a more "democratic" move.

And about the frequency of changes, I can't recall the last time QGIS 
changed its logo. Change isn't bad or else osgeo.org would not be 
changing its website.

The current?logo doesn't?has nothing?wrong.?It's just that?everything evolves.

In addition, there are some basic design issues,?like unnecessary
bevel and relief, Conceptually Q and arrow are too simplistic and
color selection is mild, IMHO.

Change is -good-, try searching "logo evolution" on Google images to
see several examples of logo changes through time.

I think a?logo contest?is a great?opportunity to promote and
disseminate Quantum?GIS.?But?I do not recommend in any case that?the
winner?will be determined?by vote,?because it becomes?a popularity
contest.?Use a?jury of?-designers- to get optimal outcomes..

As the discussion that follows your email suggests, we are just
thinking about a 'refresh' rather then a revolution neccessarily. An
it if the new isnt better than the old, we will just stick with what
we have. Here is some food for thought:

Hello Dev Team,

I understand that there is this complete rework on existing things taking
place with respect to  the QGIS software. As a part of this the entire
development related content seems to have been moved to hub.qgis.org.

The site design a bit difficult to use owing to following few things,

1. Too Small fonts by default. - I think the default size can be increased
to about 11px
2. And content a bit weird like - Poor formatting of Code.

Hi Arunmozhi,

Yeah the font size is a bit small, there is a ticket open for this and it
should be fixed soon.  The default size is 11px.  I have had a play with
different sizes and found 14px to be a good size.

Regarding 2) this is just a fall over from when we migrated from mediawiki
to redmine, clean up of the wiki is currently being done but only little
bits at a time.

Tip Top,

I like the idea of "evolving" and not necessarily 'revolutionizing' the
QGIS logo.

At least so if some one who has used QGIS before and saw the new Logo they
would recognize.

Are there "official colours"?  Gold and Green?

-- Okay just checked the logo on Windows and OSGEO linux, yes, the QGIS
logo is a little 'ratty' compared to the OS X version...

Hi!
We are using the Georeferencer tool and the resulting image is shifted,
please see the screenshot here:
https://sites.google.com/site/filestemp2/home/error_georef.jpg?attredirects=0

We've tried polynomia of order 1 and 2 and Helmert, with very similar results.

I think this is a bug, but I'm not sure we are not actually doing
something wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgscomposer.cpp building error with qgis 1.7.2
Message-ID: <1322467363119-7037908.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hello everyone, I'm trying to compile qgis version 1.7.2 (Source Package
1.7.2 Final Release Tagged) but I get an error with qgscomposer.cpp.
I've always compiled without error up to version 1.7.0!!!

I saw that others had the same problem, but with older versions of qgis.

I get this error:

*/ home/sam/dev/cpp/qgis-1.7.2/src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp: In member
function 'void QgsPaintEngineHack: fixFlags ()':
/ home/sam/dev/cpp/qgis-1.7.2/src/app/composer/qgscomposer.cpp: 521: error:

Any hint, thank you!

I was suspecting something like this too. But the question is that the CRS
of the input image should be, by definition, unknown. In case the input
image has a CRS, this CRS should be just ignored. Instead, the plugin
actually prompts the user about the CRS of the input image. And I do not
find any way to set the input CRS to unknown or just arbitrary x,y
coordinates (while this is possible in Grass).

Where you say:

"Upon resetting the CRS specified in the layer properties to the correct
one, all was well"
do you refer to the input or to the output image?

Unfortunately this is not the case with ED50 UTM31N: the resulting layer has the
correct CRS, but it is shifted. The points appear where they have to
be, but the raster layer
is shifted.
We'll try with points set on google mercator.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Setting Snap Options with Python - Problem with
 Snapping Options Dialogue
Message-ID: <ce4663cab71c481e6119ecc7f3075ba2@carto.net>

 Hi,

 With a little help from Marco I was able to programmatically set snap 
 options for programmatically created map layers through Python. I am 
 using QgsProject.instance().readListEntry(...) and 
 QgsProject.instance().writeEntry(...). This all works fine and the new 
 settings are active.

 However, the new settings are not reflected in the "Snapping Options" 
 dialogue. Is there any way I could trigger a re-reading of the snap 
 settings from Python so that the dialogue can be updated?

 Thanks if anyone has an idea,
 Andreas

Hi all,

I am trying to label road data (from OSM) within Qgis 1.7.2 using the new
labelling engine.
I set up a new columns in Postgis to store the name with a line break after
the second space.

I would like to use the "curve" option in the advanced tab, but it seems
this options does not allow to have multiline labels?

Anyone confirms ?

Thanks in advance

Hi!

I am ready for it .. It's just that I need someone who is telling me
which is the correct bugfix for it or backports it in to the release-1_7
tree.

If someone else has another bugfix for 1.7.3 - this would be the right
time to tell (also with the commit ID for the bugfix).

And of course Tim as the main release manager should be ok with it ..

Personally i think throwing out to many releases it not so good - but as
there are still some really nasty bugs in 1.7.x we should make the 1.7.x
as stable and bugfree as possible (strk? ;) ) ..

regards
Werner

in the old trac with had a tag ("causes crashes or data corruption", or
something like that) that I would like to have also in Redmine, because
this would allow to see better what are the tickets that should have

QNetworkProxyFactory is a class introduced in Qt4.5.
this could be the problem?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Benchmarking / optimization
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYprXdxnPuBVwTfiQJPSmsdX-vpsSBw_2XvtJ-crJ-BiBg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

because I found QGIS to be terribly slow with larger vectors, I
started to work a bit on rendering optimization. I am still at the
beginning of the work, here are some first findings.

The first step was to get some reliable benchmarks, for which I wrote
a new CLI application, mostly derived from qgis main app (tests/bench,
installed as bin/qgis_bench). I found precise and repeatable CPU time
measurement quite problematic, my observations are summarized in
tests/bench/README [1]. Any idea how to measure time better is
welcome.

Preparing projects for qgis_bench application, I noticed that qgis
renders the same project much slower than qgis_bench. I found that
QgsMapCanvasMap was using by default QPixmap, not QImage, which is 7
times slower! To be precise, QGIS was using QPixmap by default, but in
options GUI was set as default QImage. If "Fix problems with
incorrectly filled polygons" is unchecked (default), QImage is used.
It means that it was sufficient to open options dialog, apply (not
changing anything) and QgsMapCanvasMap started to use QImage.
Obviously, this could not be noticed by developers and advanced users,
because they had used options dialog at least once. Naive users (like
me), who rely on default settings, were using QPixmap. It seems, that
since 2006, all the first-time users (and thus maybe also last-time
users) were experiencing this problem. Is it possible or am I wrong?
Hopefully. Having fixed this problem (fixed in master [2]), the true
optimization may start.

Here are some preliminary benchmark results for master:
http://www.mpasol.it/blazek/qbench/
Y axis is relative rendering time (oldest build time = 100%). X axis
is commiter date for each build. Changes about 1% are not significant
(benchmark inaccuracy). You can place mouse over each point to get
tooltip with more info. It is also possible to zoom in both main chart
and overview.

You may notice, that something bad has probably happened between
8c1c2add and 1d7d1c62 (if there is no bug in my scripts). You can also
see that effect off each change in code depends a lot on data type.

It is important to say, that most of the optimization was already done
by Martin Dobias during GSoC 2010, see his report [3]. Unfortunately
most of them were not yet merged to master. 8c1c2add (see the chart),
is one of those (the only one?) which have been merged, the speed up
is significant.

My next plans are:
1) add more projects (more data types and rendering modes) to my benchmark suite
2) add older builds (as old as possible - where qgis_bench runs with
old libs without recompilation)
3) localize (in time) bigger performance jumps
4) merge optimizations from dev-threading branch (maybe Martin is
going to do that?)

Any comments are welcome.

Hi,

do you have last revision (git pull)? Are you on master branch? I
don't get this error when I'm on master branch (git checkout  master).
Or have you make any changes in code?

I made a few tests comparing how the selection works in qgis, gvsig and
udig for overlapped/partially overlapped polygons with fill/partial
transparency/no fill.

I attached a few screenshots in the above ticket.

Solid fill: 

The "Select single feature" tool in QGIS the tool does exactly what is
expected, it selects only (one) clicked feature. If one polygon is
completely *above* another one, then clicking on it causes qgis to
select just it. The same (obviously) if clicking on a polygon in an
point that is above another one that is partially overlapped.

In gvSIG and uDIG the "Select feature at point" tool works in a slightly
different way, selecting also what is under the selection spot, like the
"select features by..." tool in QGIS.

In QGIS and gvSIG if a polygon is completely overlapped and *under*
another one, there is no way to *) immediately understand is there,
looking at the canvas *) select only the underlying polygon (for example
from the attribute table) and have the selection color pop-up, because
it is always covered by the above polygon fill/selection color.

On the other hand uDIG behave nicely by using a default transparency
level for both the fills (when adding a vector) and the selection color,
so the user can immediately see if there are overlapped polygons and
also can see if/when there is a selected polygon under another one. This
would be a nice option in the QGIS general Options menu (using a default
transparency level for fills and selection color).

uDIG has also another nice feature: it makes border width of selected
objects bigger of the unselected ones. This is very handy especially
when it is used no fill for polygons.



Semi-transparent fill: 

In QGIS and gvSIG doesn't change much compared with the solid fill. The
selection color is solid so if two overlapping polygons are selected
only the above one is visible. If only the underlying one is selected
(from the table of attributes) it is visible because the above polygon
does not have a solid color.

uDIG as it uses by default semi-transparent selection color so it is
same as when using solid fills.



No fill:

In QGIS and gvSIG doesn't change much beside one important case: with
two overlapping polygons, with the smaller one completely above the
other, when selecting *just* the underlying one the selection color
"fills" also the above one, and the user can say how many polygons are
selected only if he/she looks in the attribute table.

In uDIG it happens the same BUT as the border width of selected objects
is bigger than unselected ones, the user knows what is selected and what
is not by just looking at the map canvas. This seems to me a really nice
feature.



There are also a few differences when it comes to editing polygons under
other ones.

In QGIS if using the solid fill or when the above is selected, it is not
possible to see the borders of the polygon being edited, just the nodes
highlighted by the node tool.

in gvSIG when clicking with a edit tool in a spot that is over two
overlapping polygons it pop-up a windows to let the user choose what to
edit, if the above or the underlying geometry. Once selected the polygon
being edited is also given a new color.

In uDIG the fill color of the polygon being edited is removed (as also
for the above one) and instead is given the semi-transparent selection
color.


cheers

How you got the error?

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 lucid with 1.7.2.

I don't have problems with the python and c++ plugins.

Did you install it from ubuntugis-unstable or from qgis.org? When did
you install it?
The problem has been solved here upon reinstalation, but an student had
the same problem on another machine.
Perhaps the binaries have been wrong for a while on ubuntugis-unstable?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Eliminate Sliver Polygons
Message-ID: <4ED48C9C.4010101@jena.de>

Dear Devs,

years ago I used ArcINFO a lot. There has been this nice tool Eliminate 
to get rid of sliver polygons based on a logical expression (whereas 
GRASS only offes v.clean tool=rmarea).
Does anybody know of such a tool for QGIS?
If not I would start coding it myself. In this case I think it might 
best fit into fTools. So any ibformation on how to contribute to fTools 
would be appreciated.

regards

Bernhard

Hi Bernhard

Sounds like a very usefull extension. In my opinion, it would be best to 
add the non-gui part into the analysis library (in C++). Like this, it 
will be available for other plugins and applications as well. 
Additionally, it could be a performance critical task for large datasets.
The gui-part could still be placed into the vector menu.

Regards,
Marco

 Hi Bernhard,

 I can't help you to solve this in QGIS, but I know that Sandro Santilli 
 (strk) is currently working on Topology support in Postgis (which needs 
 some funding by the way: http://www.pledgebank.com/postgistopology).

 I would assume that the Postgis topology work will help to keep data 
 clean in the first place, and to clean data when transfering from simple 
 features to topologic geometries.

 One other option that should work today is using GRASS topology and the 
 v.clean command: http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/html_grass64/v.clean.html - 
 however this means transfering geometry to GRASS geometry first.

 Andreas

Dear Marco and Andreas,

thank you for your quick responses.

@Marco: Unfortunately I am not at all familiar with C++ and this project 
maybe too heavy to learn it :-) I was thinking of a python thing 
although I would assume that performance would be better in C++ (apart 
from what you mentioned)

@Anreas: Yes the problem arises when topologically dirty datasets are 
imported. I already use GRASS to identify gaps and overlaps but v.clean 
offers only removal based on the area of the sliver polygon thus forcing 
me to analyze my dataset (area distribution) beforehand whereas I am 
aiming at a logical distinction of slivers enabling me to distinguish 
between data to keep and noise to eliminate regardless of the area.

I got a similar problem with a self-make Debian package: it was a 
package not correctly updated (strange enough it was 
qgis-plugin-grass, if I remember well).

I removed the stale old package and reinstalled the new one to 
fix.

Check what you have with: dpkg --list | grep qgis

And off course contact Carson Farmer (author of fTools), he was always
looking for new ideas for fTools. Maybe he has some spare time hanging
around...  :-)

 yes - I did not read your email thoroughly - you already mentioned 
 GRASS and its limitations in this respect. Sorry about that.

Just solved the same problem on a machine running ubuntu 11.04 by
reinstalling all components and
reproduced the problem by installing on another machine with ubuntu
10.04 . Running qgis from the command line I get:

alobo@delia:~$ qgis
Warning: loading of qgis translation failed [/usr/share/qgis/i18n//qgis_en_US]
Warning: loading of qt translation failed [/usr/share/qt4/translations/qt_en_US]
Warning: Couldn't load Python support library: Cannot load library
/lib/qgispython: (/lib/libqgispython.so: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory)

I assume the problem will be solved by reinstalling all components on
this computer as well, but I can hold on for a while in case
anyone is interested on me running a test to identify the component
actually producing the problem.
I remind that I'm installing from ubuntugis-unstable in all cases.

In ubuntu 10.04 Lucid, you have to install

- python-qgis 1.7.2~Lucid1
- python-qgis-common 1.7.2-1~Lucid1

If you upgrade from other version (e.g. 1.7.0), you have to remove
first the old version then install 1.7.2.

Message-ID: <B398947DCAB85D46809151E678999F210473D40B@srv01.NPA.LOCAL>

Has anyone else had problems with the identify and the select tool? They seem to have appeared in the last couple of days as it worked last week. 

I get an error message whenever I click on the map with either tool. ?It does this for every vector layer. It still returns values for the raster layer I am using as background mapping. 

I am running 1.9.90.7 OSgeo4W.

The error is as follows:

Query Failed:

 yes - I have similar problems.

 J?rgen is working on it. It is a side effect of recent modifications on 
 the PostgreSQL provider.

and the problem is solved by uninstalling just:

qgis-sqlanywhere1.7.0
(even not having to install qgis-sqlanywhere1.7.1)

Anything else that would be more hygienic to remove?

Thanks,

Hi all.
Road graph plugin gives wrong results if the OTF reprojection is 
enabled. This is correct in Master: could the fix be backported in 1.7.3?
And, could the 1.7.3 be released ASAP?
Thanks.

The problem is well described here

Shouldn't we wait another week or maybe even a bit longer? I'm just 
afraid that we are going to find other critical bugs in this time and 
maybe there will not be the possibility to release 1.7.4 then.

What event could make it impossible to release 1.7.whatever ?

Multi-line labels and curved placement simply do not fit well
together: with curved labels you place the characters on a line -
further lines would be aligned incorrectly.

Is QGis reputation enough? ;)

I agree with try to release it ASAP, but
+1 to wait another week instead of release another broken version.

And would be good doing 2-3 days of _further_ tests before
the call for packaging as well.

maybe is the usability. The problem the users are facing now in real
life use cases is that it is not straightforward to get an acceptable
random palette to be used as for unique values, while in the old
symbology the "unique value" renderer works just fine with one click.

The two missing functionalities are the ones already cited: the overall
transparency slider (for renderers other than the single symbol) and the
chance to apply the same symbol to many different symbology classes in
one go.

The above link seems really a wish list, the ticket about this missing

I agree that how is now it is misleading.

IMHO we should:
- release 1.7.3RC1 ASAP, possibly today
- announce it and call for testing
- release it after 10 days, if no blocker arise.
I think we should use the RC approach from now on.
All the best.

 Improvements to projection widget
Message-ID: <4ED5D70B.5020603@faunalia.it>

Good job Richard, I appreciate it.
A question: could someone please apply the same widget everywhere?
A few dialogs (e.g. for SpatiaLite) use a different interface, and this 
inconsistent behaviour is disturbing.
Thanks a lot.
All the best.

-------- Messaggio originale --------
Oggetto: 	[Quantum GIS Desktop - Bug #4550] Improvements to projection 
widget
Data: 	Tue, 22 Nov 2011 06:41:52 -0800
Mittente: 	redmine@qgis.org
A: 	undisclosed-recipients:;



Issue #4550 has been updated by Richard Duivenvoorde.

This has always been the case I think. There can actually (depending on 
the size of the dialog) be 3 or 4 lines of proj-parameters. But we also 
want to minimize the size of the dialog. Besides that, there is actually 
nothing you can do with those parameters (besides look at them...).

So: given we want to miminize the dialog: do you still want it to be bigger?

|(by the way: the changes is already in master, so please have a look and try).|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Bug #4550: Improvements to projection widget
  <http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4550>

    * Author: Paolo Cavallini
    * Status: New
    * Priority: Normal
    * Assigned to: Richard Duivenvoorde
    * Category: GUI
    * Target version:
    * Must fix:
    * Platform:
    * Platform version:
    * Status info:
    * Resolution:
    * Patch supplied: No

I think the projection widget should be improved, by

    * having the search filtering the projections rather than moving to
      the next matching (see e.g. in the plugin list)
    * it would be good to have the search working in both fields (people
      often overlook the search field selector)
    * the internal projection ID could be hidden (I do not see any use
      of it for the user)
    * set the focus to the 'find' button as soon as you try to type
      something into the find-text input.
      Now the user often type a code and then hit <enter> without
      result, because 'apply' apparently has focus: you really have to
      click the <find> button
    * better make a general find: just search over al fields, so we can
      remove the two dropdowns

Single tickets might be opened, but I think once we start cleaning up 
the interface it is a simple matter to do all.

These benchmarks are VERY useful expecially for QGIS Server, that greatly
suffers the performance problems.

I don't see how releasing early and often may degrade QGis reputation.
As a user I would actually be very happy to know the version I'm using
is constantly being made more robust.

Good. Hopefully it was not so bad. QPixmap is using graphic card
acceleration, QImage does not. The difference could be in graphic
cards and Xserver drivers.

Could you try to grep debug (current master)

qgis 2>&1 | egrep '(Rendering completed|mUseQImageToReder)'

in my case it gives:

Debug: qgsmapcanvasmap.cpp: 63: (render) mUseQImageToRender = 0
Debug: qgsmaprenderer.cpp: 621: (render) Rendering completed in
(seconds): 39.732
Debug: qgsmapcanvasmap.cpp: 63: (render) mUseQImageToRender = 1
Debug: qgsmaprenderer.cpp: 621: (render) Rendering completed in (seconds): 7.435

Try to look which processes are using most CPU, in my case
QPixmap: qgis 40%, Xorg 100%
QImage: qgis 100%, Xorg 1%

BTW, I don't know why mMapCanvas->useImageToRender() and other
mMapCanvas settings are done from QgisApp::createOverview(), but it is
always called so it should not be important in this case.

I'm still not positive the error in the georeferencer that I reported
to the lists is actually an error
or my fault (I provided the layer and points and wait for feedback)
but in case it is an error, releasing with
such an error in the core (both in terms of code and in terms of
essential functionality) is
certainly detrimental for QGIS reputation.
Is there an standard  testbed that is run before releasing? I could
help by running
some of the standard tests before the new versions are actually
released. A team of
committed users (not developers so that the tests are independent)
would be very useful,
has this ever done or is it maybe routinely done already? For example,
was the georeferencer
tested by users prior releasing 1.7.2 ? I can imagine that as the code
becomes more complex, some changes
made in one part of QGIS could eventually affect other parts in ways
that were not foreseen by
developers (i.e., the georeferencer worked but a change on the
onthefly reprojection could have affected
the results of georeferencer).
Excuses if this is just too naive a comment.

I don't meant reputation is related to realeasing early itself, but if early means bugged...

I agree with releasing early for releases from the master branch only because that one is continuously tested.

You are not a normal user, dear strk.

Users don't like to upgrade often and sometimes they want it but cannot.

I agree on the RC approach, there are many people of there (intense
gis/gqis users) that I know would be able to serve as testers during the
"RC" phase.

IMHO:
- it would be easy to setup a test engine for QGIS Server, and keep 
updated a table of results, so we could spot promptly any change in 
performances
- anyway, QGIS Server should be used as tiled, in any condition where 
performance is an issue.
All the best.

In a recent WMS comparison presentation (MapServer vs GeoServer vs QGIS
server vs others), benchmarks had shown that QGIS server is the worst and
doesn't scale with the number of CPU cores.

We're talking about a stable branch here, so _theoretically_ in NO event
should a "dangerous" patch be applied there. Only bug fixes should.
This is the whole point of stable branches.
You force yourself to carefully consider any modification as for its safety.
Every single patch could trigger a new bugfix release (if it was so cheap).

> I agree with releasing early for releases from the master branch only because that one is continuously tested.

How so ? By developers, you mean ?
Those testers don't even need a release, they just get the code from repository,
and anyone can get a daily snapshot from github or wherever it is.

It'll be _very_ important to have real "continuos testing" performed by
machines over all branches, and particularly over the _stable_ branches.

> Users don't like to upgrade often and sometimes they want it but cannot.

Let them wait until 1.7.10 ... it'll be their choice.
But for the rest of us, why waiting ?

I don't like to upgrade either, when it is a major upgrade (things can break).
But bugfix upgrades could be painless, if done carefully.

Hi Luca

Benchmarks are very specific, it's impossible to create general 
statements just from the slides without knowing the test arrangement 
very well.

If you are referring to the foss4g benchmark this year, the first 
comparison test was mainly about the performance of near empty requests 
(otherwise, impossible to handle more than 100 requests per second also 
for umn or geoserver).

In production environments, my impression is that QGIS server is not 
dramatically slower than other WMS servers.

Regards,
Marco

I didn't mean a specific event.
It's just impossible to make a release for every bug that has been fixed. Therefore my proposition to wait a bit until other critical bugs have shown up.

I understand, but I still think having a 1.7.2 out in the current state 
brings no good to the project, and this should be fixed ASAP.

 I can confirm that performance in a production environment is ok - see 
 examples at http://gis.uster.ch/

 Performance can always be improved, but one also has to keep in mind 
 that the other two projects (UMN and Geoserver) are specifically 
 programmed as a map server whereas QGIS server was originally only 
 Desktop and is quite a bit younger in development history.

 The benchmarks also had some quite extreme examples that are not always 
 common in production environments. But it is good to participate in 
 these benchmarks to find and detect issues that can lead to performance 
 improvements.

I'm out until Saturday but i agree in both views..
1. We should stabilize and bugclean 1.7.2 and release a new 1.7.3 (1.8.0?)
soon..
2. We should wait a bit to catch as many bugs as possible

Alexander is so kind and offered his help in applying patches.. so if
anyone else would help a bit I'd suggest to release a new version soon (mid
of dezember?)
But I'd also wait for Tim s comment on this..

shouldn't qgis be packaged in such a way to avoid multiple (minor)
versions of QGIS?

i.e. change the package names to  1.7 instead of 1.7.0 / 1.7.1 / 1.7.2 ?

There really is no need to have the old packages around, especially
with this issue.

Regards,
Etienne

And in any case, serious performance issues can always be avoided on the 
web using tiling and caching.
More serious are the problems with desktop, so I think Radim is right in 
focusing there.
All the best.

Perfect! Just perfect!
Well done! I really like it!

Probably some plugin devs have some comments or missing things but for
me it looks just good!

thanks a lot
Werner

Hi,

Sorry for jumping in the discussion here without all the background. Maybe 
this has been discussed before by the qgis dev team (if that's the case, 
disregard what follows), but why not considering beta and RC stages, before 
declaring an official release ? Lots of projects do that, manily in the hope of 
avoiding that a last minute bug doesn't go into the release. I'm well aware 
that this doesn't address all the issues, and also requires additional 
ressource and delay.

I can give you some feedback on how GDAL manages the release process. For 
"major" releases (any change of X or Y in a X.Y.Z numbering scheme), we 
generally do 2 betas and as many RC as needed. For micro releases (change in 
Z), the beta stage is skeeped to go directly to RC. For GDAL, it does not 
involve too much effort (*) as we only release source code. For QGIS that also 
delivers binary packages, that would require significant effort, so perhaps only 
the official release could come with the binary packages. For betas and RCs, 
power users would have to use latest nighty builds or compile by themselves.

Just my 2 cents,

Best regards,

Even

(*) FrankW who manages most of the releases could legitimately object to that 
statement ;-)

I think I misunderstood the problem, the ubuntugis-unstable repos only
allows 1 version of qgis installed at a time.

If you need to uninstall qgis-1.7.0 before upgraging to 1.7.2, then
there surely must be a problem with the upgrade process in the .deb?
