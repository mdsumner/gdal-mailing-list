Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python plugin: how to set a symbol for a layer?
Message-ID: <OFFEDE17B0.466232C5-ONC1257865.00279EB2-C1257865.0027CE6F@comune.trento.it>


Hi,

I've searched across documentation and mailing list, but I didn't found a
page explaining how to set a symbol.

For example:

  - point layer: I want to use a circle with width 0.5 and gray colour with
black border;
  - line layer: width 1 and continous green line

any hint?

Thank you in advance.

Thanks Andreas for explaining.
If you think it is production ready, I would suggest to commit it before
the release of 1.7. It is based on solid code (geoext), and should not
interfere with the rest of QGIS.
Objections?
All the best.

The INSTALL document should have all necessary information.

Paolo its actually embarrasingly easy with Jurgens revised version of
the INSTALL docs (since a few months now)....if you can disregard the
fact that you need to cross over to the dark side to do it....

Hi All

It seems those who care have had their say, and those that don't
haven't :-) So it looks like a majority of people opt for 3 - dedicate
the hackfest to bug fixing and release after. As such I will suggest
we lift the string freeze again but maintain the feature freeze in
place. I will update the release checklist with new timings over teh
weekend.

Best regards

Tim

Hi all.
As I wrote, I would suggest to lift the feature freeze for Andreas' work
on the webgis client, if he's ok with this. This move is highly unlikely
to have any impact on the rest, and would be a great addition.
All the best.

 Hi,

 Paolo, the qgis webclient, although it works with QGIS server, will not 
 be delivered by default with QGIS. It will reside in a parallel 
 repository, just like the QGIS documentation or the articles. Besides 
 J?rgens work on the WMS server tab in the project properties it has no 
 influence on QGIS desktop. So no need to hold back because of my 
 webclient.

 User will need to check out qgis webclient manually. It will not be 
 delivered together with QGIS.

 Andreas

+1

Agreed. It is completely separated from other code, so feature / string freeze 
should not be apply to it.

create your style within QGis and save it as e.g. "point.qml" in your plugin
folder,
then load it using this snapshot:

import os.path
style_path = os.path.join( os.path.dirname(__file__), "point.qml" )
(errorMsg, result) = vectorLayer.loadNamedStyle( style_path )

So to change the style of the layer it consists just in a file replacing
without any change
in your code.

Cheers.

Why so? Wouldn't it be better (and simpler for users) to keep everything
in one place?

 Hi Paolo,

 I think it makes sense to separate the two completely. Most QGIS 
 desktop users won't care about a webgis client. And some QGIS Server 
 users may want to run their own webgis viewer or use QGIS Server just as 
 a regular WMS.

 It will be easy to install and configure, and hopefully well 
 documented, though.

 But I doubt that it will satisfy everybody's need.

 Andreas

Sorry to insist -I do not want to bother. We currently have many
functions that are of limited, specialized use. I think our current
approach (keep everything in one place, and leave to packagers the
choice of splitting packages) is more sane.
For instance, in Debian we have:
===
p   libqgis-dev - Quantum GIS - development files
i A libqgis1.7.0 - Quantum GIS - shared libraries
i A python-qgis - Python bindings to Quantum GIS
i A python-qgis-common - Python bindings to Quantum GIS -
architecture-independent fi
i   qgis - Geographic Information System (GIS)                         
p   qgis-api-doc - Quantum GIS API documentation
i A qgis-common - Quantum GIS - architecture-independent data
i   qgis-mapserver - Quantum GIS mapserver
i   qgis-plugin-grass - GRASS plugin for Quantum GIS
i   qgis-plugin-grass-common - GRASS plugin for Quantum GIS -

I don't really have a strong opinion on where the webclient would be located 
in svn ( webclient in https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/webclient vs. 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/webgis_client).

The directory above would save some bandwidth for most people that compile the 
code, the directory below has better visibility.

Don't know what the number of files is in the webclient. If there are lots of 
files, I'd tend to https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/webclient, otherwise to 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/webgis_client

 I would propose to place it next to the documentation:
 https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/webclient

 Currently the webclient is 3.7MB, about 600 files, but most of it is 
 just OpenLayers, Ext and GeoExt. I can strip it more down to the 
 necessary resources (maybe down to 2mb, 150 files). The libraries (OL, 
 Ext, GeoExt) contain both deployment and debug versions.

 If we decide to bundle it, I would propose not to bundle it with 1.7, 
 but wait for 1.8. I think it should be more thoroughly tested and those 
 users who want to test it can easily extract it from SVN.

 At a later stage we can still discuss how we want to deliver the 
 webclient.

The only things webclient and the rest share are the icons, isn't it? 
Not duplicating that would possibly be a minor plus.

Another thing might be that the webclient follows development stuff in server,
so it might be nice to have new features on both ends in possibly one commit.
That might make maintance easier.

What would be the downside of trunk - assuming that the webclient isn't huge?

Do we also need the libraries in SVN?

 Not necessarily, but it would have the following advantages:

 * the users would not have to manually get those three separate 
 libraries
 * the libraries would be stripped down to the necessary (e.g. OL can be 
 half the size of the regular full version), same for ExtJS and GeoExt
 * the libraries in our svn would be tested to work with each other. 
 When one of the three libraries changes to a new version we would check 
 them for compatibility and only replace them in our repository if they 
 work. It happened in the past, that a newer SVN trunk version of OL 
 would break some functionality.

 On the other hand it is the question whether we are allowed to keep 
 separate versions in our SVN? Would the licenses of OL, GeoExt and 
 Ext/Sencha allow that?

Message-ID: <20110401152547.M89422@lqt.it>

Hi Devs,

I've quite casually discovered that the SpatiaLite
Data Provider is actually unable to access any 3D
layer (no error occurs, but no geometry is shown at
all).

I've already patched the data provider so to correctly
support 3D geometries as well.
Anyway, this one doesn't seems to be an high priority
bug (nobody noticed this before: I suppose 3D layers 
are very rarely used).
Considering the current "freeze" I suppose it would be
better waiting until v.1.7 will be released before
committing this patch into the SVN.

Any comment from you is surely welcome.

bye Sandro

Hi Giovanni,
the plugin is in code.google 
(http://code.google.com/p/qgis-saga-plugin/). It  Is very experimental 
and rough !
Anyway, the code makes a query to the saga-api and collect all the 
module for each library for build a complex menu in qgis. The  select of 
a non interactive module  print in stdout the  output of "saga_cmd 
'library_name' 'module_name' -h". I'm working to build a GUI "on the 
fly" from that output.
Yes,  the user need to compile saga with python interface but in future 
I think that the maintainer can build an xml file with library, modules 
and parameters structure from a  query to saga_api. We can read the xml  
file and use the information for a plugin saga_api independent , using 
saga_cmd command.
In that way, the user needs only set path for saga_api and install 
plugin with only the xml. With a new saga version, the maintainer 
generate a new xml file and puts it in plugin.

The C++ approach is realy more perfomance but is more complex and   and 
my C++ knowledge isn't so good.

Sounds like a problem with you GDAL installation.  It's not a QGIS problem.
Maybe reinstalling gdal or the mysql libraries (or downgrading) helps.

Not reproducable here either.   But those point to download.osgeo.org, which
seems unavailable from some networks for some undetermined reason.
download2.osgeo.org should work.

This should be solved from the saga side, providing a package for it. 

Let me try to explain:
First case: C++ plugin; this requires recompilation of QGIS, so we have
two options:
- include the plugin in qgis-trunk, and add the dependency on saga; this
is unlikely to be accepted by most core qgis-devs, I guess
- leave the plugin outside qgis, and require the recompilation for each
and every platform, and for each release of qgis; furthermore, osgeo4w
users will not be able to use it with qgis-dev.

Second case: Python plugin. The user will be able to install it or not,
provided he has saga with its py bindings installed on its system. This
will work with all versions of qgis (>=minimum version, as defined in
the plugin), on all OS.

Speed shouldn't be a problem, as the plugin istelf should do very little
calculations, only calling saga commands with the appropriate
parameters, as it happens with the GRASS and the GdalTools plugins.

Am I wrong?
All the best.

That could be an option, yes. But they haven't done it, and I don't
know if they would be interested. One of us could step up and offer
packaging to SAGA, but I am not that experienced in packaging issues
and distro-related complications.
The saga wiki suggest using saga_cmd through python, which would need
no recompilation, but would limit us to non-interactive plugins. Maybe
that isn't so much of an issue, and would be easier.

What about including it in trunk, but only load the plugin if the
dependencies are satisfied?
Would the devs be ok with that? Provided the quality of the plugin is
acceptable, of course.
I also wouldn't require a *full* saga installation, if I am not
mistaken. Only libsaga.

There is a third case: Using saga_cmd through python.
This is the easiest in term of programming effort, I think. But is
limited to non-interactive plugins, as I said before, and but would
require a full saga installation.

I agree speed isn't a problem.

> Am I wrong?

You are right, and bring up some interesting arguments. You are
starting to convince me. :)

Maybe I could even start with saga_cmd only (option 3) and later add
support for interactive modules using the python api (if available),
option 2.
What do you think of that?
Less elegant than a C++ solution, but much easier.

If I go this route, what would the recommended exchange formats for
raster/grid and vector/shape be?

Many thanks for your comments, I feel this has been a productive discussion.

Hi Camilo,
gdal can handle saga grid native format. 
(http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html). For vectors I think the best 
chose is shape file. At least for first step.

You do not have to do everything. If the project is successful, others
will jump in and help.

Simplicity is the way to happyness.

Sounds good. Very similar to the GRASS approach, I guess.

As QGIS grows in complexity, it will become increasingly difficult to
maintain too many different functions. So the KISS principle applies
here. We need new functions that are not only interesting and useful,
but also sustainable in the long term with the limited developer
resources we have.

> Many thanks for your comments, I feel this has been a productive discussion.

Glad if I can help.

All the best.

This can be considered a bugfix, so if nobody thinks this can impac
other functions my suggestion is to apply it before 1.7.

Amazing! We prepared the package, but qgis does not start (it complains
about a missing xerces-c_3_1.dll).
BTW: in a few countries, including Italy, download.osgeo.org is not
reachable through major ISP (e.g. Telecom). We (GFOSS.it) tried to track

problem in other countries?

xerces-c-vc9-3.1.1-1.tar.bz2 was gzipped instead of bzip2ed.  Fixed in 
xerces-c-vc9-3.1.1-2.tar.bz2.

But appearently only creatensis.pl has a problem with that.

I did not try - our Italian windows users are complaining about this.
Apparently some ISP do not route the requests correctly, or osgeo is
doing something wrong with routing. Niccolo (ccn) can be more precise
about this.

Hi Luca

using the new symbology you can do it as follows:

- gray circle with black border:

props = { 'color' : '128,128,128' }
sl = QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry.instance().symbolLayerMetadata("SimpleMarker").createSymbolLayer(props)
s = QgsMarkerSymbolV2([sl])

- green line with 1mm width:

props = { 'width' : '1', 'color' : '0,0,255' }
sl = QgsSymbolLayerV2Registry.instance().symbolLayerMetadata("SimpleLine").createSymbolLayer(props)
s = QgsLineSymbolV2([sl])

Then you will just use the symbol in a renderer and assign the
renderer to a layer:
layer.setRendererV2( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2( s ) )

The syntax of properties is dependent on the symbol layer you use, I
guess there is no documentation for the accepted keys and values,
though you can save some symbols into qgis style and then inspect the
~/.qgis/symbology-ng-style.xml.

In order to make creation of simple symbols a bit easier, I have added
just now (r15663) some convenience methods:
s = QgsMarkerSymbolV2.createSimple( { ... } )
s = QgsLineSymbolV2.createSimple( { ... } )
s = QgsFillSymbolV2.createSimple( { ... } )

This is what I have done so far:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/tree/master/python/plugins/sagamodules
Same as you, but basically I am trying to use only saga_cmd to keep
things simple.

The C++ version of the plugin I had started writing is in that repo,
too. (Older commit, another directory)

Message-ID: <A5CEDC24-6F96-4728-B5E2-D12B4EE7C17E@westnet.com.au>

Hi all,

I am attempting to use the GDAL tools plugin (a core plugin) to generate a raster from a vector.
It should be Raster -> Rasterize

When I want to select a file to save the output into, I'm getting confused.
Following SOP, I press the select button, browse to the right place and type my filename in.
But the button that is normally named "save" stays greyed out.

Now, the button that is normally "save" says "open" which seems odd.

Am I going about this right?

If I am, can anyone confirm this?

-ramon.

I forgot to say:
1.7 on linux r 15655M
using GDAL tool 1.2.25

Ok, and I'm going to have a stab at answering my own question.
On my linux box QGIS is compiled against 1.6.3, which means gdal_rasterize can't make it's own rasters. Hence, open not save.
Sorry for the dumb-user question.

Related to this, in windows-land the osgeo installer has me up to 1.8 (so on windows GDAL can make a new image).
Is my linux install a bit backward?
I would have thought using different library versions on different platforms would be adding complexity?

Hi all,

If you are  dealing with continuous classification results, e.g.
0 - 100% rasters you might find our new Raster Transparency plugin worth a look.

Here is demo: http://screencast.com/t/K3FvtDlDe
Plugin is in GIS-Lab repo.

Meet you at the hackfest,

Maxim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Help on libqtwebkit-dev for squeeze
Message-ID: <4D982A8C.5020108@gmail.com>

Hi,

in the list of dependencies for qgis on linux
as report in
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Installation_Guide#Install_build_dependencies

the library"libqtwebkit-dev" seem to be need only for
"maverick".

I try compile using the squeeze stable version.
And the ccmake ask me the "libqtwebkit-dev".
Unfortunately it seem not available on squeeze stable
So I must switch to "debain unstable" to find it.

I need to know if is really needed the "libqtwebkit-dev" for
squeeze.
Perhaps it is a refuse to remove from build settings ?

Thx,

Andrea Peri.

Camilo, I've browsed your repo but I can't find the parts where saga_cmd is
being called... I suppose I missed some files.

The python road is way more easy to develop and mantain, of course. I only
fear dealing with large datas, where import/export and back could be an
issue... But ok, don't make things complex befaure the time. It can be a
further improvement in case it required.

have a good sunday,

I agree. It's a rarity to be able to move between 3 different platforms and have things so similar. Very impressive.

> You think that's a good direction?

I think the gui is good.
Anyway, we need to build the single GUI module "on the fly", and that is 
what  I'm trying to do. In my mind:
- mainteiner side:
generate a xml file from saga_apy python called with all modules and 
related parameters;
- user side:
only use plugin with saga installed, without  need to recompiled all 
sagag source with python interface.

Are you agree?
What do you about?

now it starts, but it is QGIS 1.6. The installer creates two entries in
the "qgis woroclaw" menu, qgis 1.6 and qgis 1.7, but regardless what is
clicked it starts always qgis 1.6.

You are right.. seems I forgot to push the files. I'll do it as soon
as I am on my development machine.

Of course. This is all just a hack.. I'll clean it up in time and make
it more flexible. Using saga_cmd or saga_api as available.

Hello Gianluca
I do generate the GUI on the fly: from the output of saga_cmd. No XML
files. There are some problems, yet. And the code in the repo wont
work, because I forgot to push some files, as Giovanni pointed out.

Eventually, I'd like the GUI to be more complete if saga_api is
present (which provides more information), but to work without
saga_api, too.

Camilo

Nice!

I suggest to add this line to rastertransparencydockwidget.py so that
it works nicely with render caching enabled:

 61     layer.setCacheImage(None)

It is available through the GSoC page [3]. Any comments are welcome,

About large files: I'm just worried by the overhead with data export and
import between QGis and SAGA. That's why I was interested in a low level
data structure binding between the two environments. But as I've said, it
can be an improvements eventually, in case it will really result to be an
issue...

I hope your GSoC proposal will be accepted! I'm an earth scientist too
(geologist), and I'm going thorugh the same way of you: passion for IT and
OSS, and programming. Now I would like some more "earth" back in my daily
work, but we can't have eveything! :)
So good luck Camilo!
I will support this project as much as I can. I don't have founded projects
in this moment for that, but I will be happy to spare some of my free time
on it.

Back to the module. Are we sure that offering two options (with or without
saga_api) is feasible? I mean from the point of view of the effort. Probably
you have already investigated this...
I was also wondeing about two points:

 - should the plugin accept only layers previously loaded in QGis? This is
the way Sextante works inside Gvsig (I suppose you know it). It enables only
the plugins that accept the type of layer actually loaded (eg, vector
inputs, raster inputs, etc.). Another possibility is to let the user choose
wether to use a layer already loaded or browse for it on the filesytem (or
db, etc.).
 - would you provide the saga-python module with the plugin? We could offer
it, specifying wich version of SAGA it was been built for, to help those
users which can't build the plugin by their own...

See you,
giovanni

Its used by the QGIS help viewer, various plugins (3rd party ones) and
in the future I expect it to be used more integrally within QGIS
application. So if possibly you should look for a backport to squeeze.

Gary has fixed the updating again so it is more fresh now. Most likely
that will become the 'official' git repo if we ever switch wholesale
over to git.

Thanks for yout support. I, too, am a geologist (in training). But I
have taken as many courses in geophysics as possible. Solid earth,
mostly.

I belive so, yes. I'll try to encapsulate the functionality in one
class as well as possible. If SAGA ever offers good saga_api packages,
we can drop saga_cmd support.

Both are valid possibilities. I'll start with loaded only layers I
think, but don't see why we couldn't offer the user the option to
browse for a layer.
I think I'll designate one exchange format for each of raster and
vector, if possible. Then if SAGA can't handle the original input
format, I'll just have QGIS convert it to that exchange format.
Outputs will always be in that exchange format, to keep things simple.
That is, unless overhead or compatibility problems begin to show up.

> ?- would you provide the saga-python module with the plugin? We could offer

You mean the binary saga_api python module? That would mean loosing
portability. (Binary python modules are not portable)
This is the primary reason I want to offer saga_cmd as a (limited)
fall-back option.. so that it works on any platform without need for
recompiling.

What do you think?

Camilo

The three missing files should be there now...
'sagacommand.py' contains the code that runs saga_cmd.
I think that module will change a lot, though. I'll first define an
interface for a "sagaprovider" class or something, and implement both
saga_cmd and saga_api versions of it.

Some paths are hard-coded in the current version, like the location of
the saga modules [sagacommand.py], and saga_cmd must be in PATH.

+1 for committing. Now that there is a longer bugfix time window, there is 
enough time to test the changes.

Yes, libqtwebkit-dev is needed, and it is now available in testing.

No.  Webkit is required, yes. But on squeeze it's in libqt4-dev.
Checkout debian/control.squeeze for a current dependency list for the squeeze
package.

Hie,


I would like to do some nearest neighbour distance analysis. I would like to
plot G(W) and F(x) distribution function graphics. For instance, I want
to have a graphic wehere G(w) plotted against F(x). Is there any plug in
that you can suggest me works with Qgis  to these function graphics?

you need to install the plugin, R (< 2.12 on Windows) and several R
libraries. On Windows it can be tricky to put all together, if you need
help just ask.

Hie again,

Thanks alot. I already installed it actually. Volkan's package makes you
automatically install R project as well. But it doesn't plot g function over
f function. It is a bit general.

Message-ID: <BANLkTinevjQ6qOGAcBEvxNiPZQToCZa9bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, Marco,

I am testing Qgis mapserver on a demo server. I realized I needed to restart
Apache so that an server side project file has been modified to see the
changes in the WMS.
Is it "normal", or is it a misconfiguration on my side ?

NB : I am using ubuntu 10.10, and symbolic links to add any qgis project +
data as a new server.

Thanks in advance,

 Hi,

 You need to reload, not restart Apache. A restart is not necessary. 
 This is due to the caching mechanism QGIS server uses.

 This is suboptimal and will be improved in a future version, most 
 likely in late spring. There will be a command to reload only one 
 specific project without having to reload Apache.

Paolo, I had a similar problem, (qgis crashed when launching a plugin
that used qwt), the python-qwt5-qt4 package has been built using a wrong
SIP version, just recompile it from source and it all works. here [1]
the bug report, if you look at my comments you will find a steb by step
solution I used sucessfully.

You can run QGIS Mapserver as CGI instead of FastCGI. Then it reloads on every 
request. On Ubuntu, the only thing you have to do is 
cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ && sudo ln -s mapserv.fcgi qgis_mapserv.cgi

Message-ID: <4D99A728.6080904@fossgis.de>

Hi,

I'm trying to load several vector layers (shp and spatialite) using
PyQGIS but the Layers are never valid. what am I doing wrong? According
to http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/loadlayer.html it should be al
right. The used shape can be regularly opened from QGIS without any
problems. Opening geotiffs works without problems.

Marco

My PyQGIS test-code:

from qgis.core import *
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

QgsApplication.initQgis()
mapinstance = QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance()

# load shape
shplayer = QgsVectorLayer("/tmp/qgis/foo.shp", "foo", "ogr")
if shplayer.isValid():
    print "shplayer succesfully loaded - adding to mapinstance"
    mapinstance.addMapLayer(shplayer)
else:
    print "shplayer failed to load!"

# load sqlite
sqluri = QgsDataSourceURI()
sqluri.setDatabase('/tmp/qgis/bar.sqlite')
sqluri.setDataSource('', 'bar', 'Geometry')
print sqluri.uri()
sqllayer = QgsVectorLayer(sqluri.uri(), 'bar', 'spatialite')
if sqllayer.isValid():
    print "sqllayer succesfully loaded - adding to mapinstance"
    mapinstance.addMapLayer(sqllayer)
else:
    print "sqllayer failed to load!"

# load tif
tiffileName = "/tmp/qgis/foobar.tif"
tiffileInfo = QFileInfo(tiffileName)
tifbaseName = tiffileInfo.baseName()
tiflayer = QgsRasterLayer(tiffileName, tifbaseName)
if tiflayer.isValid():
    print "tiflayer succesfully loaded - adding to mapinstance"
    mapinstance.addMapLayer(tiflayer)
else:
    print "tiflayer failed to load!"

print mapinstance.mapLayers()

# render map
img = QImage(QSize(800,600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
color = QColor(255,255,255)
img.fill(color.rgb())
p = QPainter()
p.begin(img)
p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
render = QgsMapRenderer()
lst = [ tiflayer.getLayerID(), shplayer.getLayerID(),
sqllayer.getLayerID() ]
render.setLayerSet(lst)
# set extent
rect = QgsRectangle(render.fullExtent())
rect.scale(1.1)
render.setExtent(rect)
# set output size
render.setOutputSize(img.size(), img.logicalDpiX())
# do the rendering
render.render(p)
p.end()
# save image
img.save('/tmp/qgis/output.png', 'png')

QgsApplication.exitQgis()

 Yes - but it comes at a price:

 the CGI version does not profit from the caching mechanism and thus 
 will be a lot slower. Also, it has to load QGIS server and libraries for 
 each request. For medium complex to complex projects this will be way 
 too slow.

Hi

you have to call QgsApplication.setPrefixPath() prior to call to
initQgis(). It is covered here:
http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/intro.html#using-pyqgis-in-custom-application

Otherwise it fails to find data providers and thus it's impossible to
load layers.

hi All, If you deal with multivariate, multitemporal and cyclic raster

and here [2] a screenshot of what can be done in terms of different
visualizations the code still has some minor glitches but it is very
well usable (and stable). As well here [3] there is an improved version
of scattergramm plugin that allows you to select points (or clusters on
the scattergramm and have them plotted on your map canvas (it's  the
screenshot as well) I didn't publish this last (scattergramidentify)
plugin because I hope to get in contact with G. Picard (author of the
original scattergramm) and maybe merge the codebase. but in the meantime
you might still want to try it out :)

so this is
QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr/", True)

works.

thnx.

But why did it work for the geotif?

Until qgis 1.7 the raster layers were using data provider system only
for WMS. Ordinary layers opened with GDAL didn't require providers.

Confirmed: recompiled, it works. Hopefully this will be fixed upstream

Hello,
Just to inform you: GRASS GIS 7 is running in the cloud as web

I have set up an Open Cloud GIS in a private amazon compatible cloud
environment using:
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and 10.10 cloud server edition
- Eucalyptus Cloud
- GRASS GIS 7 latest svn
- PyWPS latest svn
- wps-grass-bridge latest svn
- QGIS 1.7 with a modified QWPS plugin

Hi Ivan,
i have modified the QWPS plugin to handle XML responses with embedded
result complex data. The current implementation expects a reference to
the resulting complex data. But IMHO this does not work using a load
balancing proxy and i don't know if the session id support of apache2
mod_proxy_balancer can handle this.

Best regards

Hi Jurgen,

I would tried to install libqt4-dev but the configurator tell my libqtwebkit ws still missing.

Now I'm go to re-install debian to remove all prior testing and re-try using the
squeeze 6.0.1a .

Saw this thing on a few blogs today:

http://freegeographytools.com/2011/search-and-catalog-your-local-geodata-arcgis-users-only

and of course seeing 'arcgis only' made me think that a similar tool
that used gdal/ogr and interfaced to qgis (and other mapping packages)
would be rather good.

I recall starting to write something similar, but discovered so many
spatial data sets appeared twice - for example a directory with
shapefiles in it is seen by OGR as a data set with each shapefile a
layer, and the shapefiles themselves appear as data sets in their own
right. I think I stopped there (I'm easily beaten).

 But I have a vague recall that someone else has worked on something
similar. Or did I dream it?

Hi Agustin, the repository you tryed to add is the repository where the
code is developed. After a discussion on IRC i decided to publish it
under the name scattergrammidentify while waiting for the original
author to answer me.

so have fun and let me know how they work, (there are some known isues
with zooming but noting major.) Until end of the month i'll be super
busy finishing my master thesie, but then i'll work on them again.
ciao

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Qgis crash after transforming invalid coordinates
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=JKjPe10_B0FRFLkPxpeqZmhCHtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I'm doing the following to transform coordinates:

*ct = QgsCoordinateTransform()*
*ct.setSourceCrs(sourceCRS)*
*ct.setDestCRS(destinationCRS)*
*point1 = ct.transform(aPoint)*

Everything works fine, until the users enters coordinates that are invalid
for the source CRS. Qgis crashes with the following errors:

*qgscoordinatetransform.cpp: 485: (transformCoords) Projection failed
emitting invalid transform signal: forward transform of (44038.4, -33923.3)*
*failed with error: latitude or longitude exceeded limits*

*qgscoordinatetransform.cpp: 489: (transformCoords) throwing exception*
*qgscoordinatetransform.cpp: 226: (transform) rethrowing exception*
*terminate called after throwing an instance of 'QgsCsException'*
*Aborted*

I've tried to catch *QgsCsException, *but *qgscoordinatetransform *still
terminates Qgis before the exception can be caught.
I've also tried connecting the
invalidTransformInput<http://doc.qgis.org/stable/classQgsCoordinateTransform.html#3aef3d008b1f5fad21aeb0f8930fdd38>()
signal, which successfully executes (but Qgis is still terminated
afterwards).

Is there a way to test the coordinates before trying to transform them,
since I will be out of my control what the user enters? I can't find
anything in QgsCoordinateTransform.

Thank you

Chris

Hi Barry

Nathan Woodrow has written a file browser plugin (QGIS File Browser).
I think it should be quite simple to add search / filter options to
it. We have also subcontracted out the development of a metadata
editor plugin for QGIS to GIS-LAB (Maxim Dubinin / Alex Bruy & co). In
the future the two tools could be fused some how so that clicking on a
file in the file browser shows its metadata, and that the file browser
can search through the metadata records based on user queries.

The pieces for such functionality are coming together and I think it
wont be long before we have a robust catalogue tool for QGIS.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] add form elements dynamically - qgis python plugin
Message-ID: <EF1F517B224A4A0382195D8B88CA6EBC@snuggie>

Hi I am a beginner with python , QGIS and pyQT.
 
I am working on a python plug-in and would like to populate dynamically a pyQT based QDialog form with combo boxes at runtime (the elements to be added are input via a config txt file that is read). Thus I would like to get hints how I can do this .
 
I have a a py file with the dialog form (streameditcustomformdialog.py):
 
from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui
from ui_streameditcustomform import Ui_StreamEditCustomForm
# create the dialog for zoom to point
class StreamEditCustomFormDialog(QtGui.QDialog):
    def __init__(self, parent = None):
        QtGui.QDialog.__init__(self)
        # Set up the user interface from Designer.
        self.ui = Ui_StreamEditCustomForm()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)

 
and a routine that reads the config file and should populate the form with new comboxes:

            formconfig_input.close
 
However I tried it above - the combo box does not appear on the form which is showing ok if I run the plugin, no error message ...but no combo box ...
 
What am I doing wrong?
Will this take care of layout management or how could I have the layout (e.g. size of form handled if many combo boxes are added ?
 
Thanks

Great news. Could you  please let us know more about the project? Which
metadata standard will the catalogue use?
All the best.

I would try any of the following:

> ??????????????????? self.dlg.comboBoxNew = QtGui.QComboBox()

- set the Combobox's parent to the dialog or layout:

self.dlg.comboBoxNew = QtGui.QComboBox(self.dlg)

> ??????????????????? self.dlg.comboBoxNew.setObjectName("comboBox")
> ??????????????????? self.dlg.comboBoxNew.setItemText(1,
> QtGui.QApplication.translate("Form", "bw", None,
> QtGui.QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))

- add the combobox to the dialog's layout after that:

self.dlg.layout().addWidget(self.dlg.comboBoxNew)

Does that help?

Camilo

Its an extension / rewrite of Alex Mandel's metaedit plugin but aiming
to be more user friendly and allow faster data capture.

It supports IS19115 metadata - you need to define the profile you wish
to use with it. Currently there is one profile based on the needs of
my client.

@Alex Bruy can we give out your SVN repo details for interested people
to test with?

When the work is done we will offer it for inclusion into QGIS core.

Tim

 I don't see why a catalog index would use a particular standard, it
would just enable searches in the metadata held by data sources
according to the standards they may be using. So for a GDAL dataset,
it would just call g.GetMetadata_List() (I think) and stash the
returned text in its db. This would then be indexed and searchable.
The catalog tool itself is then neutral about metadata schema.

 I guess if the layer presents a well-known metadata scheme then it
can do what Voyager does:

http://voyagergis.com/doc/current/Show%20Metadata

 I think its too much of a task to expect a catalog tool to collate
all possible layers metadata into a single schema, although it could
expose a summary metadata of the simple stuff like extent, projection
etc for the layers in the catalog.

 I was thinking a catalog database could be a spatialite database,
with each layer a rectangular polygon, easily enabling spatial and
non-spatial searches...

Hi Karsten,

I think you need to add the QComboBox to your dialog in order to make it 
show
_but_ if you have a ui file why don't you create the QComboBox in 
QtDesigner?
you can access it like this (ui file must have been converted into py 
file with pyuic4):
comboBoxNew = self.ui.comboBoxNew

I was in a similar situation (beginner with python, Qt and QGIS) some 8 
months ago, so here are some other thoughts:

be sure that you have read about QGIS' dynamic forms
http://linfiniti.com/2009/11/creating-dynamic-forms-a-new-feature-headed-for-qgis-1-4/

some Python code to use them:
http://www.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2010-January/008731.html

last but not least:
You can define a comboBox in the layer properties (edit widget = value 
map) and populate it from a csv file. The values are saved with the 
project or a qml file. It is even possible to manipulate the qml file 
thus synchronising the values with the current version of the csv file 
and then reapply it to the layer. I could provide some code for this if 
you are interested.

regards

Bernhard

 Although I've just looked at the OGR api and had a thought - where do
OGR vector layers get their metadata from?

It was simpler that that: it crashes just by loading a shp.

In particular, this happens when I load a shp with a preset style (qml).
If I load the style afterwards, It does not crash.
shp+style available it useful.

I want to design my own icons for my QGIS plugin. These icons should fit in

(eg: the shape for the layer (raster or vector layer icon) or the + icon on
top of the add rsater layer)?

 Hi Christoph,

 You can finde them in the QGIS trunk sourcecode:
 http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/images/themes/

 For most icons you can also get the source svg files which you can use 
 for editing in Inkscape or Illustrator.

Christoph you can also get them from the source at

http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/graphics/trunk/toolbar-icons/24x24/

Note that QGIS has more than one icon theme - if you really want your
stuff to integrate nicely you should make your code theming aware. For
plugins there is an example of how to do that in e.g.
src/plugins/copyright_label/plugin.cpp for references to
'setCurrentTheme'. The aforementioned example has its theme icons in
the core qgis icon collection, but you can also store your different
them icons in the resource file (e.g.
src/plugins/copyright_label/copyright_plugin.qrc) and then use a
relative path into that qrc file to pick up the correct icon for the
current theme. The grass plugin and its qrc are probably the best
example of how this is done.

Its not been agreed yet, but in the run up to QGIS 2.0 we may drop
some of the alternate themes and just ship with GIS theme.

Message-ID: <1302008482.2232.66.camel@fox>

Hi all.
IMHO, the GRASS vector support is currently unusable on windows.
Importing and removing vectors does not work reliably. I think we should
either fix it or drop the plugin on windows before the release.
All the best.

I'm not sure how much help I will be but I will have a look into what might
be happening over the next couple of days.  I use that plugin at work and I
don't really want it dropped from the release.

The problems are described in three tickets I linked here in the past days.

g.remove does not work on wingrass then it does not work also in qgis.

About the other two it seems that was about problems with the dbf
support. A comment seems to point that these problem have been already
solved in the latest grass versions (I don't if there were backports
in grass 6.4).

Not confirmed. We have the same issues wit SQLite as a backend.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC proposal: DBManager
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=ZQJaLjf=H5oS+=CiKzBt0z28=VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'd like to attend the GSoC 2011 as student to develop the following idea:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011#Database_Manager

Brief.
I think PG_manager is a very useful plugin because permits users to get
informations
and run queries on a PG database from within QGis. Furthermore PG_manager
GUI is
very intuitive!
So, at the HF in Pisa (2010.04) I starting to develop SL_manager, based on
PG_manager but working on SpatiaLite databases. Unfortunately I didn't
adapted the
existent code to manage SL databases, instead I forked it.

Now there're 2 different plugins based on the same code and it's very
difficult
maintaining both as porting fixes between them and adding new features could

require a lot of time.

There's another plugin based on PG_manager, it's the RT_Sql_Layer plugin
which
allow users to load a PG or SL layer using whatever select statement.

Proposal.
My aim is to merge both 3 plugins together and create the DB_manager plugin.

First and the most important requirement, the DB_manager plugin *must* be
easily
expandable to manage different kind of databases (e.g. mysql, ...).
I didn't look ahead when I forked PG_manager, but I want to correct my
mistakes.

Second, it should permit an easy management of databases, running common
tasks
as create/alter/delete tables, retrieve infos about tables, run queries, ...
.
Those are implemented in PG/SL_manager yet, but I have to do some changes to

make them more general than they are.

Third, DB_manager should allow to load tables as layer on the QGis canvas
and,
on the contrary, import layers from the canvas into the db.

What is your opinion? Did I miss something?
What other features would you like to see? And what other plugins (if any)
would it be
good to integrate in?

Thanks for your comments.

I solicit an active response from all the GRASS users. Without concrete
help, I do not think we can ship GRASS plugin on win for now. All the
best.

Hi Guiseppe

I think it is great that you're willing to develop the Database manager idea :)

Me and Luiz Motta have been collaborating on the customDBQuery plugin,
which also allows for loading of spatial queries on the map canvas. It
takes a more minimalist approach than the other plugins, requiring
hand typing of the SQL commands, but it works with postgis and
spatialite. In fact you can't call it a manager at all. Still, I think
your suggestion is way better ;)

Codewise, I think that using the geoalchemy project[1] is probably a
great starting point in order to achieve specific DBMS independence.
It already has support for postgis, spatialite, mysql, oracle, and
MSSQL Server 2008. I have been wanting to get into it myself, but I'm
still learning sqlalchemy ;)

The code for the customDBQuery plugin is hosted at the new
hub.qgis.org, if you'd care to take a look at it.

As for suggestions, in addition to what you mentioned, I guess the
only comment I'd add is to try and keep the feature list to the more
common tasks for GIS users, as it is probably quite an effort to
develop a full and robust DB manager for lots of different backends.
Anyway, I support your proposal 100%.

What version of QGIS are you using? In the trunk this not should be.

What about having some kind of plugin architecture (I know a plugin
with plugins is probably a bit meta!) so that other DBMS backends can
easily use your manager? I'm thinking that other backends like
SQLAnywhere could easily also benifit from your work just by
implementing a small stub for your plugin api....

I think you GSOC proposal would make a fantastic addition to QGIS and
I wish you all success with your proposal.

Regards

Tim

Hi all.
With current trunk:
- r.out.tiff produces a raster with wrong projection
- several modules now produce a raster with a grey color table, instead
of a coloured one as it happened before (e.g. r.los, r.reclass).
If anyone confirms, I can open tickets.

I believe that this module dos not create geotiffs aat all, but you can
have the worldfile created along the export.

Giuseppe, it would be definitely important to have such a feature in QGis.
I imagine an abstract layer that operates thorugh pluggable drivers, as we
can find on other desktop gis (like the db manager [1] for Gvsig).
Good luck for your GsoC proposal!

Hi all.
I just noticed that currently EPSG:3003 is defined in QGIS as:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68 +units=m +no_defs

instead of the old:
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+no_defs

Similarly for EPSG:3004.

The corrections have been already inserted as fake EPSG codes:
40000
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68 +no_defs
40001
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=15 +k=0.9996 +x_0=2520000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68 +no_defs
40002
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=-168.6,-34.0,38.6,-0.374,-0.679,-1.379,-9.48 +no_defs
40003
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08 +no_defs

So the fake codes 40000 and 40001 are now duplicates, and should be
removed. 40002 and 40002 are useful, as they define ad hoc datum for
Sardinia and Sicily.

Can we correct the internal db? Anyone knows the rationale for this
change?

All the best.

In fact, on a machine (deb unstable) it does not crash, on the first one
(deb testing, both amd64) it does still, so it must be a local problem.
Also on the machine that does not crash, I get a lot of:

ERROR 1: Invalid index : -1

though.

All the best, and thanks for testing.

More info: it happens only with graduated symbols.
I suspect it is related to http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3705

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC Proposal: QGis Globe
Message-ID: <4D9C7043.1050903@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi I'll propose for QGis Globe plugin, here the text i'll be submitting
as idea, do you have any feedbacks?

Idea:
Google earth made the masses unconsciously aware of what GIS actually is
and for what it can
be used for, nowadays most GIS students would explain to their parents
that what they do is
somehow related to Google earth. And this is great because now we can
easily explain a small
part of what we do: data visualization. On the other hand there are
other very important tasks
in GIS: data exploration and data analysis.
Globe Plugin aims at the real time visualisation of the Qgis map canvas
on a 3D (true 3D as
well) globe to allow data analysis, exploration and visualization all
using the same Software
package. This approach has the advantage that all data can be studied
while looking at the
topography of the terrain. Therefore the topography is directly present
and doesn't need to use
a further visual variable.
Furthermore this approach would allow GIS users to produce high quality
3D output and
visualizations without having to export or convert their data to other
formats.
The first part of the project would aim at a stabilization, performance
increasing and bug fixing
of the current code-base.
The second part would be dedicated to the following features implementation:
- user selectable Real time Synchronisation with map canvas
- Creation of Signals for symbolization updates
- Use of 3D models in QGIS symbolization
- Python bindings
- Packaging
- Nicer ?fly to? paths
- Navigation with Wiimote or Kinect
In the future the Globe Plugin could be the precursor for a complete 3D
data visualisation and
analysis tool in Qgis.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC proposal: QGis for android
Message-ID: <4D9C70A1.2050707@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi I'll propose for QGis for android, here the text i'll be submitting
as idea, do you have any feedbacks?

Idea:
Ubiquity of mobile devices makes the use of such objects a day to day
business for many
professionals nowadays. When working on field data capture or
management, the use of bulky
hardware is very uncomfortable and unproductive and thus the merging of
top notch software
such as Qgis and mobile devices would greatly improve the productivity
of many users and
thus the appreciation of QGis as THE Gis software of choice.
The idea is to Port QGIS to Android and improve the GUI for using it on
a Tablet PC. Qt, the
base library of QGIS has already been ported to Android recently under
the name Necessitas.
The first and main part of the project would be dedicated to get all the
other required libraries
for building QGIS compiled for Android and to get a standard Qgis
running under Android.
The second part would then be dedicated to the UI improvement for using
QGIS with a touch
screen interface, this would be a first version of QGIS Mobile.
A third part, depending on the difficulty of the two first parts (or as
part of a future project),
would be to create a prototype for an optimized UI for smaller Android
devices with basic
functionality.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSoC proposal: QGis VisTrails plugin
Message-ID: <4D9C70F9.8070602@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi I'll propose for QGis VisTrails plugin, here the text i'll be submitting
as idea, do you have any feedbacks?


Idea:
In scientific work-flow environments, Earth Observation/ Geospatial
data, services and
processes should be integrable together so that non-GIS users can
utilise spatial data in their
analyses (e.g. running statistical analysis, machine learning and
numerical modelling
processes).
VisTrails is an open-source scientific work-flow and provenance
management system
developed at the University of Utah that provides support for data
exploration and
visualization. Whereas work-flows have been traditionally used to
automate repetitive tasks,
for applications that are exploratory in nature, such as simulations,
data analysis and
visualization, very little is repeated---change is the norm. As an
engineer or scientist generates
and evaluates hypotheses about data under study, a series of different,
albeit related, work-
flows are created while a work-flow is adjusted in an interactive
process. VisTrails was
designed to manage these rapidly-evolving work-flows [vistrails.org]
Many work-flows can include spatial data and would take a grate
advantage of an integration
between the QGIS in VisTrails. Furthermore, due to the use of PyQt in
both projects, the fit
should be natural.
The aim is to produce a tool that will allow the following work-flow:
- Allow a user to to fetch all the data layers s/he is interested in
into Qgis.
- Use the plug-in API to launch VisTrails as a plug-in
- Give VisTrails access through Qgis API to all the currently loaded
data layers in a data
module.
- Use other VisTrails modules to construct a work-flow
- Have a VisTrails modules that places new generated or manipulated
layers back into Qgis
This approach would allow on one hand, Qgis users to have a model
builder like environment
where input data can be transformed through complex work-flows into new
information. On
the other hand this would allow seasoned VisTrails users to trigger the
power of Qgis into their
work-flows
As a future work, this tool could be adapted as a VisTrails module so
that it can directly be
used from within VisTrails to trigger the Qgis spatial analysis power.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] features from user test
Message-ID: <4D9CCA0B.4090502@bernawebdesign.ch>

Hi devs, last week I conducted a user test for my master thesis. five
GIS users/ physical geographer wher prompted to use my QGis plugins to
perform some tasks.
Before the beginning of the test, the users were asked to perform some
simple QGis tasks to get aquainted with it's interface.
During this time that users were encouraged to try out new functionality
and try to solve the task without asking me how to do that. It  was very
interesting to see how people that had never used QGis tryed to solve
the problems.
Following I have three ideas that you might find interesting and worth
implementing in the future  or are these features already implemented
and I didn't know it!? :)
- In all five cases the universe tried change multiple layers that
things in one go but were unable to do so.
- when loading new rasterdata they expect the symbolization to be set to
stretch
- last the lplug in toolbar yet on resizing itself or turning off on
again QGis.

I think that for most the first two points could be very interesting for
many users. I let you know as soon as my master thesis is finished and
maybe we can find some more interesting information.

Hi,
On top of the patch mentioned below, I made a patch implementing 
most of wonder's suggestion made at
 http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2832#comment:9 , namely "switching
first rule/all rules, enabling symbol levels". I tested it during one
week on r15538 and release it against r15676.
This gives new rendering possibilities with the rule-based renderer,
including easy and beautiful on the fly rule-based rendering of OSM
maps, with results similar to mapnik and osmarender.

Hi Marco

I see you would like to propose several projects for QGIS. I would
strongly recommend you to aim for quality, not quantity of the
proposals. More submitted proposals do not really increase the chance
to get accepted. Better choose one project that has the highest
priority for you (and best matches your skills) and then make the
proposal as detailed as possible.

Martin

Hi martin, all, i looked into the 3 projects because Anne or Anita (sorry
girls i cant recall) suggested to propose more projects than last years
since it seemed that the number of assigned projects was dependent on number
of proposals. I like the three idea and my thinking was to allow the
"decision makers" which projects is more needed.
I havent sent the proposals in yet so i m happy to get more feed back from
you all.

Hi Maxim,

the raster transparency plugin throws this error

An error has occured while executing Python code:


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
"/home/gio/.qgis/python/plugins/raster_transparency/rastertransparency.py", line 106, in layerChanged
    if self.layer.bandCount() > 1:
AttributeError: 'OpenlayersLayer' object has no attribute 'bandCount'


when adding layers with the openlyers plugin.

Hi Marco, all,

I did say that last year's slot assignment depended (somehow) on the
number of applications. But, as we don't know the algorithm that will be
used this year, I don't call for 10 proposals for each student just to
increase the odds - and honestly speaking it would be difficult to write
10 really good proposals for the same organisation and the same project.
 
That would remember me h index spoofing:

Good! We look forward to hear from devs about which proposal(s) to
submit on Melange. Just a reminder, student application closes tomorrow
19.00 UTC!

Hi,

Thanks for this plugin. It would be great to use it with real (float) 
raster values.

As far as I know, this would require another structure for pixel 
transparency (pixel ranges which may be confusing with multiple band 
raster) and matching value function modification in 
qgsrastertransparency.h and qgsrastertransparency.cpp.

Actually, I am not a c++ developper (python eternal newbie) and I may be 
wrong (please, tell me). I do not dare to try testing by myself (until I 
get some book on c++ dev).

Good job anyway !

Thanks for finding this bug, we'll fix it in next version

It should work with all rasters (both float and integer), but currently slider
step is limited with 1.0

Structures for pixel transparency for integer and float rasters are the same.
Different structure is used for multiband rasters.

My mistake !

Type "float" made my question unclear.

What I have got in mind is setting low value and high value beyond which 
transparency is set.
I test rastertransparency plugin with float values. Setting a pixel 
transparency for each possible value beyond low and high values seems 
difficult (furthermore with a slider) : no obvious way to know all 
values of interest. It seems more efficient and legible to set low and 
high value associated with one alpha value.

That's why I tought of a pixel value range instead of a single (or 
single * number of bands) pixel value. It is independant of value type 
(integer or float).

Perhaps all values of interest can be filtered at plugin execution time 
(scanning all raster values when selecting layer and sending those in 
range set by sliders instead of int values) ?

Thanks for your answer Alexander.

Yes About that, i'm at the swiss ski championships till saturday and I
plan a computer slot tomorrow around 15-18 to send in the proposals so
it would be nice to get your feedback (if you have any) before then.

Wow Mohammed, that would be great!
Orfeo Toolbox [1] is one of the most powerful and full-fledged image
analysis libraries I've seen around.
I hope it will be accepted, good luck!

Hi Maxim

there are always some informal presentations during the hackfest -
typically previews of stuff that people work on - to gather some
feedback etc. So we will be very interested to see the presentation of
your project!

I believe it is best to have the townhall meeting and presentations in
separate blocks because it is quite hard to stay focused for a long
time :-)

Hello all,

Yes I really hope to have some time to present you what OTB can do, to 
talk with you about what OTB could do for QGis and what would be the 
best way to do it.
I fear for the moment I won't be the most efficient Qgis bug hunter as 
you all will be ;)

It would be great if those of you interested in OTB would have a little 
time at the beginning of the HF (let's say during friday).

Cheers,
Julien

I will review it (but probably not earlier than during the hackfest).

Hi all (esp. Mauricio).
I'm doing further tests with PostGIS rasters. They cannot be loaded yet
(still on GDAL 1.7.x). Furthermore, I noticed that loading a raster to
PG with CLI tools produces a geometric table (Bounding Box), whereas
doing the same through the plugin loads only the raster table, not the
BB.
Any further tests?
All the best.

GIS) modules from Quantum GIS. Generate a GUI on-the-fly and run the
modules using either the SAGA command-line application or the SAGA

OSGeo project(s): Quantum GIS
Title: SAGA Interface for QGIS

Describe your idea
1. Introduction

Implement a QGIS plugin that makes it possible to run the versatile
cross-platform "System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis" (SAGA
GIS) modules from Quantum GIS.
Generate a GUI on-the-fly and run the modules using either the SAGA
command-line application or the SAGA Python API, if available.
Automate the process of information exchange between those two systems.


2. Background

SAGA, the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses, is built in a
modular way. Its modules provide an ample range of functionality --
from data format import and export to algorithms for quite specific
tasks.

But it lacks a modern interface.

QGIS with its nice interface, on the other hand, while quite powerful
and usable, could use more field-specific tools for analyis.


3. The Idea

A python plugin for QGIS could bridge that gap, providing a better UI
for SAGA, while expanding the capabilities of QGIS.

SAGA provides at least the following three interfaces:

    * C++ API
    * Python API (equivalent to C++ API)
    * saga_cmd program

I would implement a plugin that interfaces to SAGA transparently
through either of the latter two, depending on which is available.
Current SAGA installations (binary packages) typically only provide
saga_cmd, the Python module has to be built by the user, but is more
powerful. In particular, interactive modules can only be run through
the API, not the command line.

Possible pitfalls I have identified are:

    * Time. The task is concise and well defined, but the schedule is
      tight. I have kept two weeks of buffer to deal with any contingencies.
    * Compatibility. Python often has compatibility problems between
      versions. I have some experience dealing with this, but unexpected
      issues can always arise. To prevent this it is important that testing
      is done with all target versions of python, and if possible, on
      diferent installations (architecures, operating systems).
      There could also be issues with SAGA and QGIS API for different
versions. This will have to be considered during implementation.
    * Data compatibility. Implementations may differ, and in
particular large files can be problematic because of the conversion
overhead involved. I intend to start simple, but taking this in
consideration when choosing exchange formats. Luckily, both QGIS and
SAGA offer a great deal of options in this regard.

The timeline includes two buffer weeks to handle any contingency or delay.

Deliverables

    * Research
    * Software design - including requirements, class hierarchy and
implementation notes
    * Code - python
    * Build environment - cmake based to fit in with rest of QGIS
    * Profiling report
    * Basic installation & usage instructions
    * Weekly progress report - in addition to more frequent informal reports
    * Mid-term & final evaluations

4. Project plan

A written report on progress will be provided every Thursday,
additional to more informal reports through the week.

To get familiar with QGIS I have already started working on part of
the following. I have been posting to qgis-developers, and the code is
available on github.com

0) PRE-GSOC (now, due )

    * April 8: Proposal
    * April 25 - May 5: Development environment
    * May 6 - May 24: Software design
    * May 19 - May 24: Setup project


1) FIRST TERM GOAL, due July 12: Implement basic functionality, have
most non-interactive modules working. (using only saga_cmd)

    * May 25 - May 31: Plugin registration
      "                       Library & module handling
    * June 1 - June 7: Basic module list
      "                       Module dialog, generic widget for options
    * June 8 - June 14: Specific widgets & constraints
    * June 15 - June 23: Input/output handling: Grid & shape
    * June 24 - July 5: Running saga_cmd
    * July 6 - July 12: Buffer week


2) SECOND TERM GOAL, due Aug 16: Polish functionality and interface,
have non-interactive  and at least part of the interactive modules
working. (using saga_cmd and saga_api)

    * July 17 - July 22: Complete library & module handling using
saga_api (loaded if available, else fall back to saga_cmd)
    * July 23 - July 29: Interactive modules: Grid
    * July 30 - Aug 6: Input/output handling: Tables and other
    * Aug 7 - Aug 9: Polish packaging and distribution
    * Aug 10 - Aug 16: Buffer week - if unneeded this time can be
allocated to bug removal and simple documentation (Installation, basic
usage).

5. Future ideas / How can your idea be expanded?

  3) POST-GSOC GOAL: Add support for remaining modules, including
interactive modules. Other interface improvements.

    * Interactive modules: Line, Box, Circle
    * Better help / user feedback


Please provide details of general computing experience:

I work almost exclusively under Linux (Debian). I can and have written
programs in C, C++, Python & Lua, among others.

As a geosciences student I frequently work with science related
software, including SAGA, Octave, NumPy. I prefer open-source
software, when possible.

Please provide details of any previous involvement with GIS
programming and other software programming:

I have never done GIS programming per se, but have experience with
other software programming. Some of the projects I have worked on are:
Naev (a game written in C), libmagt (gravimetric tensor library, C++),
emutrix (a GUI-centric audio tool, C++, Qt) and assorted smaller
programs, mostly related to geosciences and often written in Python
(using NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib).

Please tell us why you are interested in GIS and open source software:

I use SAGA as a tool and often come across other geoscience software
during my studies. I have been using OSS for almost 10 years now, and
love the opportunity it has given me to learn.

For science, in particular, I think the transparency provided by open
source software is vital in promoting reproducibility of results.

Please tell us why you are interested in working for OSGeo, the
software project you have selected and your specific coding project:

I like to see a better user interface for the SAGA modules. As a SAGA
end-user I think that's the single most important feature missing from
an otherwise excellent system.

Also I'd like to contribute back to a tool and a community that has
made my work so much easier. The extra insight I will get in how both
SAGA and QGIS work is a bonus.

Would your application contribute to your ongoing studies/degree? If so, how?

Yes! I study earth sciences, but given my interests in programming and
OSS, I will try to make a career in the field of (geo-)science
computing. This would be an excellent learning opportunity and also a
good addition to my CV.

Please explain how you intend to continue being an active member of
your project and/or OSGeo AFTER the summer is over:

Primarily by maintaining the plugin code.

I may also tackle other projects, for example I'd like to see if I can
implement some of the gravity-related algorithms I studied while
working on libmagt as plugins for QGIS.

Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a
full-time paid summer internship or summer job?

Yes, I do.

I will be studying (about 12 hours a week) during a small part of the
first GSoC term, but have planned to recover those hours during
weekends, or alternatively by starting coding earlier, if there is no
objection.


Any comments are most welcome.

 opening python module for 32 bit architecture
Message-ID: <BANLkTikQqCp=P9k9mQ-1un1vdLaiTvukcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to alls,
I've updated Qgis on mac snow leopard from 1.6 to 1.7, but a python module,
pygraphviz, tell me that it's impossible to load for the 32-bit
architecture. With 1.6, pygraphviz can run beacause Qgis can be opened in
32-bit mode.

I's only a temporary problem for the developer builds 1.7 that will be
fixed, or I must to build pygraphviz for a 64-bit architecture?

Thanks a lot!!!!

Hello Rashad,

I don't wish to be rude, and your proposal does sound interesting.
Still, I find it strange that you copied such a great part of my own
proposal [1] verbatim, including the project plan: list of
deliverables and timeline (down to the dates).
I understand you may be under time pressure to submit a proposal
quickly, but suggest you study those aspects of the proposal again,
and update with your own.

My plan may not apply exactly to your project.

Regards,
Camilo

I'm just being lazy in the dev builds - smaller download with only 1 arch, and I figure there is only a tiny fraction of Snow Leopard users with the original 32bit intel processors.  But I'll still do 32+64bit for release.

What does pygraphviz do that requires 32bit?  At a guess, it would be either TclTk or wxPython for a GUI interface.

Hi William,
pygraphviz is a module to export some kinds of diagram...

for example:

from a group of polygons (archaeological layers in my case) stored in
postgres and
linked to a table that defines the sequence  1 after 2, 2 after 3, 3 before
4 and
.....  pygraphviz returns as a graph this sequence:

https://picasaweb.google.com/mandoluca/Pygraphviz02?authkey=Gv1sRgCPCWgYvcx_Xy0wE#5577382203073709298
<http://pygraphviz sequence exported from pyarchinit plugin>

pygraphviz is binded to graphviz through a .so file

<http://pygraphviz sequence exported from pyarchinit plugin>
http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/

graphviz can be usefull also for demographic or geological studies, etc.

thanks a lot and best regards

Luca

What I meant was that pygraphviz (or graphviz) probably uses a library that is not available in a 64bit version, so can't be made 64bit itself.  TclTk and wxPython are 2 such common GUI libraries.

... hmm, looks like graphviz has a tcltk part... but the libraries are all 64bit... so maybe it's the pygraphviz compilation that is not working 64bit (I didn't see any Mac download for it).

Hi Mohammed,

Good proposal.

I think it would be good to state / write some commitments after GSofC
by saying. You will maintain this orfeo plugin, fix bugs and update it
as well create new releases in the future.

This makes the proposal stronger for approval in my opinion.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Adding vertex marker to Google layers -> very slow
Message-ID: <BANLkTimkoXJF+DZkRJbMOF2Tv27B85ww6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I create a QgsVertexMarker and add it to the canvas:

*marker = QgsVertexMarker(self.iface.mapCanvas())
marker.setCenter(point)
marker.setColor(QColor(0,255,0))
marker.setIconSize(5)
marker.setIconType(QgsVertexMarker.ICON_CROSS)
marker.setPenWidth(3)
self.iface.mapCanvas().refresh()

*
*When I do this the marker is successfully added to the canvas. Everything
is fine, when the layers loaded to the canvas are locally available (eg:
normal raster or vector layers).
The problem comes in with remote layers such as Google layers. When I use
the code above on a canvas with a Google layer, it takes extremely long to
"add" the marker.
The problem lies in: **self.iface.mapCanvas().refresh(). As far as I can
see, refresh() reloads the entire visible area, thus requesting the image
again from the Google server and slowing done the entire process.

Is there a better way to add a vertex, without reloading the entire image?
I've tried self.iface.mapCanvas().scene().update() and marker.show() instead
of the refresh() statement, but then the vertex isn't drawn.

Hi all (especially Andreas).
We are eager to test your client, and we have clients potentially
interested: any plans about when will you commit it to svn? Do you have
documentation on install&configure? We can help with Italian and
Portuguese translation if useful.
Furthermore: any plans to integrate support to WFS(-T) as well, possibly

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Better bug squashing
Message-ID: <BANLkTinQ5_JPf2X5BT2HGPRFZyv3fJyBkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
with all respect to Your good work, I would like to redraw the topic
about 'What can we do to make bug squashing better, quicker, smoother
and more complete'.

Few days ago, I was discussing several people about possible
solutions, which can solve the problem of increasing number of
unclosed bug reports which are degrading devs work and user
impression.

We came with following ideas:
1. Employ some new C++/Qt devs in software companies using QGIS and
dedicate them to bug fixing.
Hm, if I can speak for my small company, currently with zero C++ devs,
our financial limit would be partial employment of some skilled local
dev. Furthermore, there is very long entry period to get knowledge of
technology and forcing people to fix other people's bugs can not be
good idea and can produce other bugs. Also it can be very time
uneffective. Either You are regular QGIS dev, or You can not do any
bigger coding. This is not good idea.

2. Ask existing regular QGIS devs if they can spend more time with
bugs, when we would collect some money covering their time.
Again, if I can speak for my small company (located in poor EU country
:)), we are able to send for example 100 EUR each month to bug fixing
budget. If few other companies will join, we can have two half time
employed devs solving bugs. Are there any hardcore devs interested ?
What hourly rate do You expect ?

3. Employ some new C++/Qt dev and dedicate him to create complete test suite.
If new people are not good in bug fixing, they can be good to create
good test suite for all basic parts of QGIS. Is there anybody able to
design such tests and mentor developing ? We can find some skilled
students for this task or pay dev from one time public budget
collection.

4. Establish QGIS QA team
Establish QGIS QA team and group of testers to regulary test every
supported platform against latest trunk. We would quickly address new
regression to responsible developer with full debug and gdb backtrace
info. Each tester would be responsible to one platform and some
limited part of software features.
We would needed:
   - to reevaluate supported libraries versions and operating systems
   - to reevaluate supported software features and data sources


What do You think ?

You need to call refresh() of map canvas only when you really want all
layers to be redrawn. This is not the case.

Vertex markers (and other graphics items) are updated automatically
when you set their position. When setting their properties the markers
do not get updated (repainted) automatically, however you can force
update of the marker easily:
marker.update()

Hope that helps

Unfortunately as of now there is no exception handling in the python
bindings (coordinate transform is probably the only one exception used
in public api). Please file a bug for this issue, we should have a
look at it (if possible provide also the definitions of of
source/destination CRS of easier replication of the error).

Hi Robert

thanks for the icons. It seems to me that they contain some artifacts:
the background is partly white, not transparent - on the gray tool
button they are hardly recognizable...

When adding to repository I guess they should be included in both gis
and newgis themes, right?

Bye

Thank you Martin for this error. Already corrected in SVN.
I tried to use similar colors as in original. If it will be hard to 
recognize, we can add colors to white upper part.

Yes, changes can be included in both. But in my opinion we should merge 
those two themes, taking the best from each. During Lisbon?

The icons look good now. Added in r15688.

Right, merging them makes sense. The hackfest could be a good
opportunity for that.

Hi Martin,

Your update has added a non-standard menu item to the Mac platform. Now, a "Settings" menu item is present, but the items contained therein are found in other, more standard places. E.g., there is a "Preferences..." item under a "QGIS" menu item, typical of all mac applications.

Perhaps a platform check is in order to exclude this change on macs.

Cheers,
John

Hi John

so basically some menu items are shown twice - in different menus, right?

In the section of code where the menus are created/updated, there is
the comment pasted below. Please can you check that this is the
correct for mac?

Martin

   * The User Interface Guidelines for each platform specify different locations
   * for the following items.
   *
   * Project Properties:
   * Gnome, Mac - File menu above print commands
   * Kde, Win - Settings menu (Win doesn't specify)
   *
   * Custom CRS, Options:
   * Gnome - bottom of Edit menu
   * Mac - Application menu (moved automatically by Qt)
   * Kde, Win - Settings menu (Win should use Tools menu but we don't have one)
   *
   * Panel and Toolbar submenus, Toggle Full Screen:
   * Gnome, Mac, Win - View menu
   * Kde - Settings menu
   *
   * For Mac, About and Exit are also automatically moved by Qt to the
Application menu.

Qt moves Options, and renames it to "Preferences", yet the dialog window is still named "Options".  It does not move Custom CRS.

I think there are 2 kinds of application level preferences - usage/interface, like options and keyboard shortcuts, and app feature prefs, like Custom CRS and Styles.  The interface prefs go in the application menu, but I'm not sure features prefs have any standard place.  The Edit menu is a common place for feature prefs (and Qgis does duplicate them there).

Don't forget the Help menu that got moved - it should always be the last menu, but now it's before plugin menus.

No its not but it probably wouldn't be too much work to extrnd it.m

Hi,

Using the qgis 1.7 r15690

If I try to set render using
Rule Base and symbol level.
It seem not saved when close the Layer-Properties windows.

I open the windows properties and rule-base windows I add some rules and
open the Symbol-levels.
It is firstly disables so I check to set enable and set some level.
After I click ok - ok and close the propeties-windows.
But if I re-open the again I notice the symbol-level is disable again.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a missing functionality.

I think current devs are already overcommitted, with a few exceptions.
So it would be good if those who are available will clarify their
position, so some companies could have an option. I think we especially
need maintainers for unmaintained pieces of code.

I think bringing fresh blood in is the best option. However, this can be
expensive; I expect some of the larger institutions and companies that
are using QGIS as a part of their core business will jump in and
dedicate one or more developers. This is what is happening already, more
or less informally.

I think this is a huge task, that nobody is able to do on a purely
volunteer basis. Currently we rely on our growing user community to do
the testing, and this proves rather effective.

More comments welcome.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Coloring shapes of vector layer
Message-ID: <BANLkTimz_X3Q5AhajRuhVgT6rufRKnVTMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've got a vector file (shp) with a bunch of points in it. I want to load
the points to the canvas with a specific color (not the random color QGIS
provides). I've tried a couple of tutorials, but the code provided doesn't
change the color.

*mask = QgsVectorLayer(maskPath, "my_mask", "ogr")*
*sy = QgsSymbol( mask.geometryType() )*
*sy.setFillColor(Qt.red)*
*    *
*renderer = QgsSingleSymbolRenderer( mask.geometryType() )*
*renderer.addSymbol( sy )*
*renderer.updateSymbolAttributes()*
*    *
*mask.setRenderer( renderer )*
*mask.triggerRepaint()*
*self.iface.legendInterface().refreshLayerSymbology(mask)*

Did I forget anything, or should I do something diffrently?

Chris

Hi Chris,
have you looked at [1]?
here my sample code using rendererV2:

layer = QgsVectorLayer("Point?crs=epsg:4326", "myLayer", "memory")
symbol = QgsMarkerSymbolV2.createSimple( { 'color' : '0,255,128' } )
layer.setRendererV2( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2( symbol ) )

ciao Marco

I've just realized that QGis uses Python 2.5, and it isn't possible (at
least, straightforward/recomended) to build Python 2.5 extensions with VS
2008 (because Py 2.5 for Windows is being built with VS 2003).
A solution is the use of MinGW... or recompile Qgis's Python support for
version 2.6.

Hey, thank you. It worked.
However, some Qgis code changed (eg: createSimple doesn't exist anymore), so
I had to adapt a little bit.

Hi,

 

I'm new developer in QGIS.

 

I work with Wing-IDE, it provide a very well auto-completion for Python and QT libraries...

 

But I don't any auto-completion for the QGIS libraries. Wing doc explain to use a *.pi file but I can't translate core.pyd or gui.pyd to core.pi or gui.pi ...

 

Can you help me ?

 

Thanks !

pi files or "Python Interface" files describe the interface of binary
only python modules.
Wing ships with a script that extracts pi files from pyd: "generate_pi.py"

Just for the record, under linux I had to pass the following options
to the configure script:

--enable-python
--enable-unicode

The first is to build the python modules (could be done by hand, too).
The second forces saga to use unicode, so it matches debian's wx
packages.

No problems otherwise, (so far)

Sure.
I had stated to keep links (to APIs, forum threads, etc.) and some notes here:

http://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki

I can move some of that to the QGIS wiki and add the info I find in
the threads. Is that what you mean?
If so, an admin would have to create an account for me.

Else, I can expand the above wiki.

So, is there anybody who can allocate more time for bugs if some
budget will be collected ? What is the minimal hour rate ?

Hi,

Would it be possible to include QGis Globe Plugin in trunk build?

Is QGis Globe C++ Plugin in Windows and Ubuntu available now?

Right now, I am using Mac OS X. Is it available for Mac OS X? How you
install it and where is located (i.e URL)?

How to build i.e installer

Not quite yet, globe needs the threading branch. When i last asked, Martin
said that he might start merging at/after the hackfest.
I d love to help merging to speed up things but i think that Martin is the
best to do this since threading is his "baby".
> Is QGis Globe C++ Plugin in Windows and Ubuntu available now?
Yes, just clone my repo or pirmin's repo. We use it under ubuntu. I think
somebody mentioned using it on win. All the library exist for all
architectures so it shouldnt be a problem. Happy to get your feed back.

Get all the dependencies, clone the repo, build.

On ubuntu just adjust the settings in the first lines and execute the file.
It will ask you some questions, get all the dependencies, clone the repo and
compile. For other architectures read the installer to see which steps are
needed.

Hi Marco,

Thanks for your reply.

Looking at the script in your blog, it seems that we don't need Qt
library / framework / SDK to compile this, right?

http://www.bernawebdesign.ch/byteblog/2010/12/01/qgis-globe-plugin-installer-script/

I got only 3G mobile broadband, quite limited download. I don't have
the Qgis build system from the source.

Thanks.

The line:
sudo apt-get build-dep qgis

Gets all the needed dependencies for builing qgis.

Here is a short howto on building the SAGA Python API under linux:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/How-to-install-the-SAGA-Pyton-API

It is probably incomplete and my English is not the best, but it is a
start. I don't have access to a Windows machine to test them for
myself, but seems SAGA's website has decent instructions for that OS.
I have inserted a link at the end of the wiki page.

The rest of the wiki[1] is a collection of links to APIs and relevant
discussions on lists/fora, mostly as a reference for myself.

Regards,

Camilo

As soon as I find a minute for it, I will publish my experience on a wiki
page (where? I will see...). The pages from SAGA to build it under Windows
are a bit outdated, respect to the src contents. I will ask Conrad if it's
possible to update them. In this case I can remove mine.

Add it to the same wiki at github if you want.

On an unrelated note: Do you know if a particular python version is
defined as target for QGIS plugins? I believe I read 2.3 somewhere,
but can't find the source.

I don't remember about a reference version. The Python libs shipped with
Osgeo4w come from Python 2.5.2

PS: I hope they will be upgrated to 2.6 (at least). It would solve various
problems, not only for Windows builds (VS 2008 express is free, otherwise
MinGW is needed if one doesn't own a previous licensed compiler), but also
for many third-party python libs which are going to be distributed only for
Python >2.6

I am available for this (well I'm dreaming of the day when I can work
on the QGIS project full time...). My bug fixing usefulness is more in
the areas of user interface, usability and so on...I dont have all the
deep ninja skills that Marco, Juergen and others have when it comes to
more nasty c++ problem solving. Still I guess most bugs are simple to
moderate to fix and just need somone to actually spend time on them,
and I would be quite effective at dealing with those.

I believe I can recruit others to help with the bug fixing effort if
there was financial support to sustain the effort, and there are
probably others on the project who would be interested in this.

Tim

Good to know. Of course, we are available for translating the content.

Yes, I agree that a plugin approach would be necessary.

Looking forward to it.

 authentication: maybe also as a plugin? I don't know. I don't have 
 immediate plans. We should not forget that the primary goal is a 
 out-of-the-box, easy to install, webgis solution.

 Not sure how I would implement authentication. It is probably totally 
 dependent on the database used and the organization's need. It is 
 probably necessary as soon as one starts to allow online digitizing.

 Any thoughts on how you would implement authentication?

I think, easy to install and out-of-the-box "run and display map on web"
is that what is needed in this case. You can always move to some bigger
webGIS solution if advanced stuff is needed.

You can implement Apache basic server authentication (using company's
LDAP for example) without any modification to webGIS app code.

Hi,

I and a my colleague have found a WMS-C bug in latest 1.7 SVN builds.

It seems that QGIS "forgets" some tiles.

This bug doesn't happen in QGIS 1.6, which works perfectly.

http://oi56.tinypic.com/15zs56u.jpg

We heve opened a ticket in osgeo, #3738.

Well, I found out the script tries to download osgeo4w files and unpack then before real packaging.

 

But I already have osgeo4w downloaded local using osgeo4w-setup.exe with Advanced install/Install from local Directory.

 

And also installed and configured to develop and run Qgis (modifying windows paths as suggested somewhere else).

 

How can I make the script to take a shortcut??

 

Regards,

David

Hi,

 

I tried to generate a qgis 1.5.0 installer package, but I received an error:

Looks like your wget hangs.  You probably killed the first three downloads.
Try running

wget http://qgis.org/downloads/System.dll
wget http://nsis.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/images/9/9d/Untgz.zip
wget http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip

And there seems to be a general demand to speak about ?QGIS-server? instead of 
?QGIS-mapserver?. The latter is really confusing for most user, as it tend to 
make them think it uses UMN mapserver...

we have a similar application called Online Shapefile viewer. which uses
gdal library to render a shapefile. We do not use php or other web scripting
languages. the whole application is written in c++ but not a cgi
application.

Can this be included in qgis server application? I dont know..
lsi.iiit.ac.in/lsi/shpviewer
the application directly reads a shapefile using

  OGRDataSource      *poDS;

    poDS = OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open( "point.shp", FALSE );
    if( poDS == NULL )
    {
        printf( "Open failed.\n" );
        exit( 1 );
    }




Currently just rendering is done and we are working on showing attributes
and labelling.
This application can be modified to make QGIS Server.



Any type of comments,suggestion,feature request && BUGS are always welcome

My suggestion is to go through all of them, and either remove the "Must

Opinions?

Hi,
Thanks for the link!

I started working on this. I will not remove the "Must fix" tag on my
own, but already corrected priorities (incorrectly put as critical when
in fact there is no crash nor data loss).

I'm working mainly on stuff related to vector (and its symbology, legend
and printing).

If we prioritise on bug/patches (over enhancement) then we can use this
report:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&must_fix=Yes&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&milestone=Version+1.7.0&type=bug&type=patch

Hope this helps.

Hi All

We will be holding our townhall meeting at 4pm Lisbon time today (17
April 2011). Anyone i welcome to attend virtually or in the flesh if
you are local. An agenda is here which you are free to add to. We will
try to cap the meeting to 1 hour.

We will be able to watch the meeting (with some lag, and probably
questionable sound quality) here:

If you like you can also ask one of those present to patch you in via skype.

Thanks Fischer, in fat it was the problem. I removed this parts of the script and packed manually all DLLs and qgis preinstalled binaries. 

Finally runned the last part of creatensis.pl script and successed. 

Thanks again.

Message-ID: <4DAB5D06.3080804@szczepanek.pl>

Hello Lisbon!

I made short review of two very similar themes [1], as we decided to 
joint them. It covers only basic set (without any plugin). As base for 
merging I propose "gis" theme, as there are more plugin icons.
Simple voting system (1B, 2B, 3A, ...)  will work you think?

Please add your comments Anita, if needed.

[1] http://robert.szczepanek.pl/tmp/theme.png

1:
A	+ consistent with next

2:
A	+ one vector sign in theme (see 15)
B	+ nicer (transparency)

3:
A	- too small map sign
B	- page/paper? sing

4: see 2

5:
A	- <extend view>? not <pan>
B	+ consistent with cursor; recognizable
	- not sharp	

6:	
B	- from another theme

7:
B	- from another theme

8,11-14:
A	smooth
B	sharp

9:
A	+ easy to scale as general <move> action (small sign in right bottom; 
see one after 21 - move annotation)

10:
A	+ fits in action area -> reusable?
B	+ bigger

11-14:	green (A) vs. white vertex (B) for "object to be processes"
B	- why 8 and 9 without white vertex?

15:
A	+ simple message

16-17:
A	- not clear message (16 taken from GIMP)
B	- hard to recognize, 17 too dark

18:
A	- too smal arrow
B	- "i" in strange place

19:
A & B	both are unclear

20-21:
A	- not typical
B	- bookmark (but spatial?); breaks "without perspective view" rule

22-25:
A	+ consistent

Hi Robert

We had a small poll among the last men standing this evening (Tim,
Anne, Borys, me) with the following results:

1A for consistency, but still it would be better to have icons that
actually represent printing rather than composition
2B
3 use globe on top, with a "document" in the background as with other
"load" icons
4B
5B the hand could be slightly improved
6A
7 the diskette icon is still slightly confusing, something like this
[1] has been proposed, though that might be still unclear
8,11-14A
9B but with smooth shape
10A
15B but without the action in top-bottom corner, with smooth shape
16B with smooth shape
17B but the plaster could be brigher
18B with cleaned arrow
19B but agreed that it's not clear
20B,21B if we have to keep the "no perspective" rule, let's try
something like [2]. Another idea was to use a golf flag icon [3]
22-25 it would be good to keep something like "ABC" as in 22B, using
the bottom-right actions like in 22-25A icons

Martin

This is interesting. Not a single one of my installations has decided to use those most of those symbols, and while I recognise them, there's going to be a bit of retraining happening here.

> 1:
> A	+ consistent with next

Yes.
Also, to me this symbol reflects what the icon does better, but not what the function is called. It's where you make a new layout (a big page), but is called a print manager. But then there's problems about difference in name and symbol.

2B - matches better with the others. (Although I do like the "V" for vector shape of the other).

Not a button I'm using a lot at them moment, so I'll not comment.

4B.

5B. Also a lot closer to what i'm used to seeing.

6A. I'm used to 6B but like 6A better

> 7:
> B	- from another theme

Wouldn't it look better to have the same sort of disc as near 1 (consistent)? The problem here is differentiation between save vector and save project. Perhaps if it ad a disc similar to the project with a vector overlain, similar to 2? (Does that make sense)

B. Even if few of my shapes look like that :)

> 9:
> A	+ easy to scale as general <move> action (small sign in right bottom; see one after 21 - move annotation)

I'm used to seeing something closer to the 4-way arrow at the bottom of 9B. With the arrow it's own I'm getting a "next" impression, but if you put it where the star is in 8A I could understand that (so something similar to 23A).
I think, 9B.

> 10:
> A	+ fits in action area -> reusable?
> B	+ bigger

I'm reading this as a button for node settings, so I'd probably expect a dialogue box. I presume this is going to create/move/edit nodes? 

> 11-14:	green (A) vs. white vertex (B) for "object to be processes"
> B	- why 8 and 9 without white vertex?

For B, maybe translucent, similar to 2B? I suspect they'd be a bit hard to see if they were unfilled.

> 15:
> A	+ simple message

Ah. The pencil is "save as". Ok. Got it. A, with the polygon like 2B.

> 16-17:
> A	- not clear message (16 taken from GIMP)
> B	- hard to recognize, 17 too dark

16A. This may be because I've just had the super glue out. I'm struggling to see the band-aid (plaster), but it I could tell what it was, I'd understand that.
(Is there meant to be duplication there?)

> 18:
> A	- too smal arrow
> B	- "i" in strange place

18B. Yes, the I is in a strange place, but I get what it's doing. You could reverse the arrow, and get the "i" in a better place, but then the arrow would be all wrong.

> 19:
> A & B	both are unclear

19B. I've got a symbol that is something like a highlighted yellow bit with a big cross in it. Which makes sense to me, but wouldn't fit this set. How about something like the 18.5A symbol with the cross from 14 where the arrow is?

> 20-21:
> A	- not typical
> B	- bookmark (but spatial?); breaks "without perspective view" rule

I like B. Perserspective-wise, is there something that is obviously a bookmark that could be used? I see the golf flag suggestion. I'd think that's also something I'd only recognise in perspective too.

> 22-25:
> A	+ consistent

A. But noting preference for 4-way thingy in 9B.


Probably just muddying the water here. But I hope this is of some help.

1A, but I agree with Martin here that it would be better if the icon was
related to printing.

neither, should be made consistent wit the other load icons (globe on top,
simple map in the back).

We could also use a WFS icon. (I don't see it on theme.png)

6A

neither, I think it would be most intuitive to use the same icon as for
"Save Project" and have a layer in the back - or the editing pen ...

 22-25A but with Martin's remarks: "it would be good to keep something like
"ABC" as in 22B, using the bottom-right actions like in 22-25A icons"

yes, a high definition web cam it was enough. I suggest for the next HF
to record the desktop of the presenters.

yes, I will ask the guys to send me the presentations and then I will

There is one problem, which I don't know how to solve. For certain
projections and source extent, reprojected extent of a map (both
raster and vector) may run to infinity. We are usually expecting some
reasonable values, with infinite or very large numbers everything
fails.

How should be handled this situation? Is it possible to find somehow
maximum reasonable area for given projection? It is probably possible
to tests if projection transformation works/fails on regular grid of
points in longlat. Is there a better solution?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin text streams and Vector File writers
	question
Message-ID: <856479.16733.qm@web33707.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello, again, 
I am pluging QGIS on Windows XP using Visual Studio 2008 compiler. I was able to set the user interface of my choice by using QTDesigner. I getting very comfortable and may be even getting hooked with QGIS. If QGIS fails then my research also fails. Such is the stake for me I am looking forward to the new release. 

I need help with layer writers  ( QgsVectorFileWriter) and stream writers (QTextStream). I know one is QGIS and the other QT. But you guys are expert in both and may help resolve my problems. I want to tackle the QT problem first, I open the text file pointer using the code below (almost the code of the tutorial by Marco.) 
??? QString fileName = QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(0,"Traffic Stress log file name");
??? if(!fileName.isNull())
??? {
??? ??? QFile f(fileName);
??? ??? if(!f.open(QFile::WriteOnly | QFile::Truncate))
??? ??? {
??? ??? ??? QMessageBox::information(0, "error", "Could not open file", QMessageBox::Ok);
??? ??? ??? return;
??? ??? }
??? ??? QTextStream txtStream(&f);
?? }? 

I see the file created and yet when I try to write text data out I have not been successful at all. I have stream commands, such as the one below, thrown is at places I want to check the program's progress. They do compile without raising any errors and I also have message boxes with the variables come up during execution of the plugin, but nothing is being written to the disk file.
?
??? txtStream <<" Traffic Stress update "<<qsNetlayerName<<endl;

The compilation is working with out an error message. Yet not a single character is written to the file. I added the flush command as in 

??? ?? ??? ???? txtStream.flush();

Yet nothing is being written. What am I missing?

I have other challenges that I have to overcome with the QgsVectorFileWriter also.
It has been very unpredictable with how the data is being written out. I am not sure if it is possible to run the plugin in debug mode on the Windows platform, but that may help newbie QGIS programmers like myself. But it may be too much to ask considering the work that all of you guys have already done. yet, I am asking it may already be possible to run a plugin in debug mode. Is it?

Thank you,

Maaza?

Hi everyone,
The results of Martin's poll look fine to me, except as Ramon suggested, if 9 is like B, instead of the 4-way arrow could it please have a small single arrow, like the icon to the right of 21?
It is too difficult to tell what the 4-way arrow is when it is small (even the single arrow could actually be improved to make it clearer).  A single arrow would also be consistent with the move-label and move annotation icons.

Good work :)

Alister?

Message-ID: <154acb3980081f7cb3cf7bfbd9595b00@carto.net>

 Hi,

 I came across an info that there will be a qt contributors summit in 
 Berlin, from June 16-18: 
 http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/03/16/save-the-date-?-qt-contributors-summit/

 It is about opening up qt and coordinating potential contributors. The 
 event is "invitation only", but one can request invitation if one has a 
 reason to participate.

 I am wondering if QGIS should send a representative in order to speed 
 up some open issues/bugs we have with the qt library (e.g. all the SVG 
 issues we have, the PDF printing issues, other rendering/clipping 
 issues, etc. etc.).

 What do the QGIS devs think? Would it be worth the effort to get in 
 better touch with the qt community? Do we have something we can 
 contribute to or benefit from such a summit?

 Andreas

Hi Tim,

Thanks for the summary of the meeting. These are always super helpful, especially as I was away and unable to lurk this time around.

Cheers,

Hi Andreas,

This sounds like a good idea. Perhaps someone is not too far away, maybe even someone who is quite familiar with the various bugs and qt-related issues. That person might even have the initials jef. ;-)

Cheers,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ecw and linux nightly builds
In-Reply-To: <372082403.9622491303283727502.JavaMail.root@zim-store03.web.westnet.com.au>

Hi, 

I've been happily running the development nightly builds on my linux (ubuntu) box for a while now. 

Unfortunately, I've just hit a point where unfortunately I have no real choice but to load up an ecw image. 

I have previously complied the ecw library (when using ubuntugis-unstable) and GDAL knows about ecw, but QGIS doesn't seem to want to talk to it. 

There doesn't seem to be a gdal-ecw (or similar) package in the nightly repositry. 

So 
Is it possible to add a package to the nightly build to get ecw support? 
or, 
Is it possible for me to build/add a linking bit (package) and get ecw support? 
or, 
Do I need to go into the self-build relm? 

If it's one of the first two, are there pointers available? 

-ramon.

Probably not the version that QGIS uses.  The nightly builds are done against
the "normal" version of the distribution.  You probably only have ecw support
for a version from a "foreign" repository.

If you add ecw support to the distribution's version, QGIS should also use it.

Hi all.
It seems interesting to load the connection settings for PostGIS from
those in .pgadmin3 (or syncing them both), so the user should not repeat
the config twice.
Any major problem with that?
All the best.

Hi Soeren

We are developing an own WPS server and looking for a WPS client.
With which server and response (GML format?) did you use your modified
QWPS plugin?

Yours,

Ah. I appear not to have been clear in my intent. Sorry.

I was using ubuntugis-unstable (which is 1.6) and had ecw support there. 
 (Giovanni, yes that method worked perfectly for 1.6)

I then moved to the nightly builds (by changing sources, and letting apt sort things out) so I could find out more about 1.7, and have been in blissful ignorance of the whole ecw problem (at least on this computer) for a couple of months. I'm now quite used to 1.7 (particularly the OTF rasters :), and would rather not have to go back to 1.6.

So the crux of the question should have been, "Is there a (relatively) easy way to look at ecw rasters using the nightly build?"




I have also been looking at J?rgen's answer, and if I understand I should remove the remaining GDAL bits from the 1.6 install and bring in GDAL from source (which should be what the nightly build is expecting), and hook ecw up to that. Then it should work. I'm probably misunderstanding - is that right?

-ramon.

Not from source.  The nightly builds use the GDAL version from the "original"
distribution.

My main point of the nighly builds is to test if trunk is building against the
various library versions - having usable trunk builds is just a side effect ;)

So if you need ECW support, you need to add it to that version.  The version
from ubuntugis is probably a different one and therefore not used by nightly
build.  And in turn having ECW support for that one, doesn't help.

You need to build the GDAL ECW plugin for the "original" GDAL version.  The
tuturial can help with that.  And once you added it, QGIS (including coming
nighly builds) will be able to use ECW.

 Hi all,

 I initially checked in QGIS webclient. You can find the source at 
 http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgiswebclient/

 I have to apologize upfront that I am at holidays until May 3. Until 
 then I cannot answer questions regarding the web client. Pirmin Kalberer 
 knows a bit about the client.

 If someone wants to translate, you can find the translation file at 
 http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgiswebclient/js/Translations.js

 There is a readme file containing some information about installation:

Hi Robert

Great work. I committed the changes you have made in r15788. Please
let me know if there are other updates from you that I have not yet
added.

I'm still not sure about that move action subicon - I prefer the 4 way
arrow. But maybe others feel differently.

I'm going to go ahead and remove the new gis theme before the release.

If anyone is interested, the icons as they stand now for the gis theme
are attached as a small pic.

Regards

Tim

Hi all

Yes sorry about the dodgy editorial work - I did most of the write up
on my overnight flight and committed it in an airport stopover the
next morning having had only 2 hours sleep so needless to say it wasnt
my best work :-P

Anyway thanks to crowdsourcing, hopefully it now reads a little
better! (Thanks Marin :-)

Regards

Tim

I always liked the Gis theme more than the old default. Now its getting more
and more great.. very good work Robert. For me this will be the New default
theme.
Tim: i also like the 4way arrows for move more than a hand.

Newgis is dead...long live gis....I've removed the newgis theme from svn.

Um actually I like the hand more than the 4way arrows, and what I was
trying to say in my previous post is that I like the four way arrow
more than the single direction arrow in the action subicon!

Message-ID: <575663.46540.qm@web113802.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello.

I'm developing a GIS application based on QGIS API. Now I have some problem with visualisation of selected features - when features selected by the "QgsVectorLayer::select(   );" method, its filled by black color on the mapcanvas. How to change color or disable that visualisation of selection?

Another question: how to disable or make invisible vertex selection markers after "QgsVectorLayer::startEditing();" call?

I think I understand. I've had a go trying to turn understanding into practicality today, but for the moment, I'm plain out of time.

J?rgen, for a side-effect, this is the most pleasant one I've met for quite some time.

just started to test again GRASS rasters after the last commits.

Value tools is lightning fast under Linux but does not work at all with
GRASS rasters under Windows. The plugin still does not show "out of
extent" with GRASS rasters.

Sorry I don't remember what you told me at the HF, are this issues to be
solved now plugin side?

Cheers

On windows/trunk/osgeo4w now when adding a GRASS raster the module

qgis.g.info.exe

always crashes (not qgis itself). The raster is eventually added to the
project.

I noticed also that now (on both windows and linux) the area of the
region shows in pink transparent color. This is not really handy as it
changes slightly the colors of rasters being viewed.

So the current situation for "regular" GIS users who need support for 
ecw is:
On windows -
You have a chance to get ecw support if you were lucky enough to 
download the previous ERDAS SDK 4.0 (which is no longer available). The 
latest one, 4.1 causes gdal to crash.
On Linux -
You're probably out of luck for now.

yes. A ticket on the osgeo4w tracker as already been filed.

you need the old sdk source code, then it compiles fine into GDAL.

I would imagine that a "regular" GIS user wouldn't be as insane as to try and run the nightly builds! :)

I did have it running the lucid binaries for qgis1.6. 
Note that when Giovanni says old sdk he means the even older 3.3 sdk.

OK. I've just rolled back to qgis1.6 and yes ecw works.

I notice:
The lucid nightly qgis depends libgdal 1-1.6.0

The lucid 1.6 qgis depends libgdal 1-1.7.0

The current version of libgdal-ecw-src (from which I can use the wiki instructions) expects and uses libgdal 1.7

Which to a fairly-close to regular user like me, is a bit of a problem.


Actually, what would be really nice here, is to be able to run the 1.6 and 1.7 qgis versions side by side like I can on macos and windows.

-ramon.

A bit if guess-work:
I would imagine that the nightly build is against the earliest libraries that are likely to be needed (hence gdal1.6) on the basis that if it works there, it will work with gdal1.7 or gdal1.8. 

I hope that for release qgis would be compiled against gdal1.7 or gdal1.8 rather than stepping back to 1.6.
 But, this is the first release I've been watching this closely so I don't really know what's about to happen.

Message-ID: <4DB0C594.8010200@wildintellect.com>

While not using the most recent trunk (but a recent one) and a 1.6
install I ran into a quirk which I hope someone else can confirm.

I have 4 columns all are bigint in postgis, 2 read and float8 and to as
int8 to QGIS. Only the float8 columns appear on the list in the
graduated symbology options.

Is QGIS doing some sort of Type Casting? QGIS seems to be treating 2 of
the columns as if they were Text and not as numbers. Yet the Postgres
definitions for all 4 are the same.

Thanks,

Slight correction to that, the float8 columns are indeed doubles. So now
it's just the 2 bigint columns and why QGIS insists on treating them as
if they are text.

Alex

Hi Paolo,
Indeed! Not all buttons in the advance editing toolbar are available for

You cannot add a point to a multipoint feature (you can only add a new

multipoint feature and paste it as a new multipoint feature.

You cannot add a part to a multiline string (you can only add a new
feature). You can move or delete one of its parts. You can copy a
multiline feature and paste it as a new multiline feature.

You can add and delete parts to multipolygon. (As a minor note, to
delete a part of a multipolygon. you have to click on one of its
vertice, which *might* be a problem if you have a set of contiguous
(parts of) polygons).

It is the responsibility of the backend to generate new id's when
copy/pasting to avoid duplicates, e.g. with:
ALTER TABLE test_multipoints
  ADD CONSTRAINT test_multipoints_pkey PRIMARY KEY(id);
otherwise duplicated id's are created (which does not prevent most
functions to work apparently).

Hop it helps,
Mayeul

Hi,
I found the idea appealing and apparently quite simple to implement. On
second thought, there are a few issues (nothing blocking, but some
work):

- If you have 30 databases on 3 local servers (e.g. dev, testing, prod)
and only one of those databases has tables with spatial objects, you do
not want to list them all in qgis. So you should be given the choice.

- This relies on knowing where this pgadmin config file is. I guess it
is in ~/pgadmin3 in most GNU/Linux box. Is the pgadmin config file
stored in a predictable place in Windows? You should be given the
possibility to choose your config file.

- In any case this should be optional (you should be able to configure
it manually, and you still need to give a password if you are not using
a socket or another method of authentification).

My 3 cents.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] pyQT combo box & QGIS plug-in signal argument
	question 
Message-ID: <19FEE6ECFC0341D8949974629BB3D1E1@snuggie>

Hi all,
 
in a python QGIS plug-in I have a form with a dynamically generated pyQT combo box. 
Now I am trying to have a change in the combo box send a signal with one argument (which is the id of combo box) to the called function changeValue. Note this changes the attribute of one field in a shape file attribute table and I need the combo box id to know which field will be changed by the changeValue function). How can I do this ?
So far I have.
 
 QObject.connect(comboBoxNew[dropbox_counter],SIGNAL("currentIndexChanged(QString)"),self.changeValue)

    def changeValue(self, value):
        mc = self.canvas         
        layer = mc.currentLayer()
        ob = layer.selectedFeaturesIds()
        layer.changeAttributeValue(int(ob[0]),self.id(),value)

Thanks for any hints as I have been  stuck with this for days ;)

Cheers
Karsten Vennemann

Hi Mayeul,

WinOz doesn't uses any file to store permanent
settings: it uses the System Registry instead.
so pgadmin connections are stored under the
following registry key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/pgAdmin III/Servers

Maybe I shoud clarify this more
Right now this works:  I can send the signal and have the value of the combox be used to update a field in the attribute table , 
however in addition I would like to add the id of the combobox that I can determine which column should be updated in the changeValue function
How can this be done ?

It's not very elegant, but you could use QObject.sender(), see

While the QObject.sender() method should work, it is not thread safe.
The QSignalMapper[1] class seems to do what you want, too, *if* I
understand what you are saying correctly.

Another option would be to create an list of slots, something like:

changeValueSlots = [lambda x: changeValue(x, cb) for cb in comboBoxList]

Then connect each sender to a different slot in that list.

Camilo

Thanks for all the input I received 

I found one seemingly good solution (via internet search) that works using
functools.partial  that is available since python 2.5
http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial

My code is then
...
from functools import partial
...

QObject.connect(comboBoxNew[dropbox_counter],SIGNAL("currentIndexChanged(QSt
ring)"),partial(self.changeValue, x = dropbox_counter))

    def changeValue(self, value, x):                  
        mc = self.canvas                              
        layer = mc.currentLayer()                     
        ob = layer.selectedFeaturesIds()              
        layer.changeAttributeValue(int(ob[0]),x,value)

Hopefully that helps someone else too when trying to easily pass an
additional parameter  from an QT signal slot ...

However I am not getting an error nor does the update of the selected feature take place.
What is wrong with my code ?
 
Or is there another way of setting field default values ...

has the correct set.

I'm holding on completing the workaround (I did a few in r15376) for now because there are so many color pickers, but if it comes to release time, I'll do it.  I added some details on what works and what doesn't.  The native color picker *can* work.  The workaround is my C++/Qt limit.

Hi.
for few days I see big white stripes when panning (moving to sides)
some vector map. It wasn't there before. Can somebody confirm ?

QGIS: 15804M
OS: Debian Squeeze Gnome, Debian Lenny KDE

Thanks,

Hi,
Could you tell if it is systematic (every pan, and whatever the vector
file) or not?

Telling us the type of video card/driver and if you have particular
settings (dual display...) might help.

Hi Ivan

Do the white stripes disappear when panning is finished?

I don't have this effect on my machines here, but it could be related to the 
resize crash fix (http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/changeset/15771). Could you check 
if the white stripes go away if you remove the few lines in qgsmapcanvas.cpp?

Regards,
Marco

Yes, it started when installed daily build containing that changeset.
I can test removing lines later, if needed.

confirmed on 15815 as well, it is not only on pan, as well when a dialog
is opened or closed over the canvas it Flickers.

removing the code from changeset 15771 eliminates the problem

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tracing errors of the vector layer creation
Message-ID: <615991.90668.qm@web113817.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello.

In my application I execute a simple sequence of QGIS API functions for create vector layer from postgres database:

  QgsDataSourceURI uri = QgsDataSourceURI();
  uri.setConnection(ServerIP,port,dbname,username,password);
  uri.setDataSource(scheme,table,geom,sql);
  QgsVectorLayer *vlayer = new QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(),"layername", "postgres");
 if(!vlayer->isValid())qDebug(vlayer->lastError()+vlayer->lastErrorTitle());

"isValid()" check failed in application on the one polygon layer but the QGIS opens this layer successful without an error. Both "lastError()" and "lastErrorTitle()" return an empty string... How do to recognize cause of that error?

it works now. I don't know if it was my fault when I tested the other
day of if it changed something meanwhile. Nevertheless there is always
the problem when passing over null pixels and outside the extent of the
GRASS raster.

There are 3 GSoC 2011 QGIS projects accepted as far I can see in the list[1].

1. Camilo Polymeris	SAGA interface for QGIS
2. Giuseppe Sucameli	DBManager plugin for QGIS
3. Marco Bernasocchi	QGIS Mobile

Congratulations to them.

Hope to see QGIS mobile library for arm that can be used for iOS,
Android, WebOS, MeeGO, etc. soon.

Best of luck to all who weren't accepted this year... there are many
Summers of Code to come -- but you can take the opportunity to get
involved in your projects-of-choice NOW-- I wouldn't be surprised if
some of you delivered better code and more contributions to QGIS than
those of us who were selected.
I am afraid, GSoC participation will always be an imperfect choice, as
it is limited to only a few participants, while actually you are all
welcome to contribute and take part of this project.

Camilo

Hi Marco,

Any detail plan how are going to tackle this project, aside from this
(below) you mentioned in your proposal.

"Until midterm:

- The first and main part of the project would be dedicated to get all
the other required libraries for building QGIS compiled for Android
and to get a standard Qgis running under Android."

[1] http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2011/mbernasocchi/1

Tim, mentioned this (below) in his post [1]. Is your plans in line with this?

(QGIS) Mobile

    * a full screen map canvas
    * tools that appear after swiping your finger from offscreen to onscreen
    * offline editing capability
    * local viewing of QGS projects (perhaps migrated to sqlite3 with
sqlite raster support)
    * simple forms and data capture capabilities
    * reading and capturing data from GPS

[1] http://linfiniti.com/2011/04/wrapping-up-the-qgis-meeting-in-lisbon-april-2011/

Hope to see github account / google code account for your project so
we can follow your progress.

https://github.com/

BTW, Android Spatialite in this repo and build spec for Android NDK,
probably you can use these in your project.

https://github.com/mrenouf/android-spatialite
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145388/android-ndk-build-of-spatialite

MBTiles for Android offline base map
    * https://github.com/djcoin/MBTilesOsmdroidExample
    * https://github.com/djcoin/MBTilesDroidSpitter
    * https://github.com/djcoin/MBTilesDroidSpitterExampleSimple

I am excite to see Qgis mobile running in Android.

Hi Stefan

Compile qgis server with Debug info enabled and place a file called 
'qgis_wms_server.log' into the directory of the fcgi executable. Adapt the 
permission of the file such that the server process is able to write to it.

Regards,
Marco

Hello everyone,
I was accepted as a student in GSoC to implement a "SAGA interface for QGIS".
There are also proyects that try to interface QGIS with GRASS and the
Orfeo Toolbox (OTB). Paolo has informed me that the creation of a
common framework for those systems was discussed and approved during
HF. A very interesting idea, IMO, that completely changes the way I
would have to work on my project.

While I didn't participate in those discussions and don't know what
conclusions were drawn, as a brainstorming exercise I am writing a
short description of what a very simple API to that framework could
look like:

Would that more or less fit what you have in mind? Please comment/criticize.

Nice work. One other thing to consider is having a validator class -
knowing the type of a parameter is often not enough. The idea with the
validator class would be to create validation rules that can do things
like bounds checking, checking if a file path is valid, checking if a
layer named in a parameter exists in the registry etc. I guess this is
partly covered by your getConstraints method, but maybe we need
something more flexible...

Also some thought could be given to making the execution of tools
operate well outside of a gui context. This would open us up to for
example exposing the tools via the QGIS mapserver as WPS at some point
in the future. OTB has some nice infrastructure in place that allows
tools to be purposed in multiple ways e.g. console, library or gui.
and it would be nice to emulate this.

For me the ultimate conclusion of this kind of work and integration
would be the implementation of some kind of workflow engine  in QGIS
(ala kepler / vistrails / triana) so it is exciting to see the work
you are doing and I think it would be really great to harmonise the
implementation of OTB/SAGA/GRASS tools within QGIS.

Yes, that was the idea behind getConstraints and getChoices. Of course
a validator class is a more elegant and flexible solution.
There is QValidator, which is quite simple, inherited by versions for
integers, floats and strings (using regex). We could provide some
other validators we identify as important, e.g., TableValidator or
AngleValidator.

The type list can be extended, too, and I think many cases can be
handled in that way. SAGA uses about 25 different types.
The advantage of using fixed types is that other parts of QGIS can
handle them smarter: We could e.g. have a FileLayer type and a
MemoryLayer type, let the implementation specify which format it
prefers, and have QGIS do the rest: loading or saving the file (or
not). And in both cases present the same interface to the user (or
next module in the pipeline).

In summary, I lean towards a simple validator class, accompanied by a
set of pre-defined types: a compromise between flexibility and
"smartness".

A related consideration is that some parameters may be optional, or
(worse) some combination of parameters may be optional.

I will keep that in mind. Anything in the current interface that would
not work well outside the gui context?

I think that is what I meant by "pipeline," which is the term OTB
uses. I did not consider that in the mock-up API, because:
a) It's complicated. Possibly the hardest part to do right.
b) I think it could be designed later, on top of this framework.

I will have a look at the projects you mention... see how they do it,
get some inspiration.

Thanks for all your comments,

First of all congratulations to you and to other accepted students for
the Summer of Code programme!

Great that you like the idea of generic framework for processing tools
in QGIS. Helping us to bring this framework from ideas into code would
be another great benefit of your project.

The discussion was not going into implementation details, we were
mostly collecting the ideas how the things should work.

Framework implementation: as you write in the proposal, ideally it
should be implemented in C++ with Python bindings. I would suggest you
to start the implementation in Python and skip C++ coding at least at
the beginning. My experience is that Python is great for this kind of
prototyping (no compiling, shorter code etc). If you will end up with
sufficient amount of time at the end of the summer, you can move that
into C++ and add Python bindings. The idea is not to waste time with
writing and rewriting various c++ classes when the API is not clear
yet. Consider this as a suggestion, not a command how to do it :-)

Forms/Parameters: I would start with with generic input fields (line
edit / spin box) for integers, floats, strings that can be constrained
with a range (numbers) or regular expressions (strings) - easily
achieved with QValidator classes. Then some custom widgets can be
added for better handling of some types: layer selector, enumeration
etc. The framework may be extensible so that if a library often uses a
particular custom type, the plugin integrating the library could add a
custom widget for it.

Advanced parameters: some modules may allow users set lots of
parameters. Although this is handy, many times the default values work
well and only few basic parameters are changed regularly. It should be
possible to mark some parameters as advanced and they would be hidden
by default, they would show up after clicking a checkbox or a button.
For example, when creating a vector buffer, the distance would be a
basic parameter while the number of segments per quadrant would be
advanced parameter.

Categorization: currently we are starting to face some trouble with
organization of plugins and the "modules" they provide. We thought
about creating fixed categories as in GRASS (e.g. Raster, Vector,
Database) where the modules would be placed. We also considered custom
categories and subcategories. The general problem with categories is
that many modules do not suit them well if they are not coming from a
well-organized library such as grass, saga or otb.
The conclusion that I recall from the discussion at hackfest is that
tagging is probably the only way to go: each module could have several
tags assigned to it, then the list of modules would be a tree with top
level items containing tags and modules would be shown inside these
tags. Bigger libraries requiring deeper hierarchy might come with
hierarchical tags like "SAGA/Grid - Tools". The names of tags will be
left for developers' creativity.
This list of processing modules should later get some advanced
functionality like searching, favourite modules or even attaching most
used modules on a toolbar, but that is something for the future, we
are not expecting you to do that during the summer :-) A simple tree
listing tags and modules assigned to them will suffice.

Formats and format conversion: for import and export of map layers the
framework should support any layer loaded (or loadable) by QGIS. In
case the library uses a different format for input/output, it should
take care of import/export.

Running modules from scripts: you probably have that in mind but let's
keep it explicit: the framework should provide API that would allow
user to run modules from python console or from a plugin, QGIS would
basically act just as a default GUI using that API. This will finally
allow users to run the processing modules in batches - poor man's
pipelining :-)

Feedback: many modules are able to return some feedback - either in
the form of a progress to indicate how long the process will take - or
to return some messages that will be shown to user. Support for
cancelling a running module would be helpful too, but not really
necessary right now.

Agreed; it will also be much easier for interested people to follow the
work.

Right, this works very well with GRASS modules.

I personally like and use the filtering option of GRASS plugin a lot,
and find this the best option for all users except possibly for the very
first-timers.

Right, this is very important, also to be able to add extra options etc.

Any news from OTB people? Their input is important.
All the best.

Yes. I wrote that API description not so much thinking it would be the
actual interface, but as a way of reflecting on what issues could
arise and how to solve them.

Ok. I think that's a good idea. I'll start with Python and later see
when (and if) migration to C++ makes sense.

Agreed. In general I think it may be a good idea to keep the GUI stuff
in QGIS and have the implementations only care about interface to the
various systems.

BTW, in the document linked above I use the term "library" for a
collection of modules, as opposed to "implementation" for a given
interface to a system (GRASS, SAGA, OTB). There may be more than one
library per implementation. Just to clarify-- terminology can be
changed, of course. I don't even know if the title ("Processing
Framework") is accurate. Perhaps "Analysis" is a better name.

Good point. SAGA, as far as I know, does not provide information on
which parameters are considered basic and which are advanced. Perhaps
a list of parameters considered advanced can be included with the
plugin. Not very elegant, because it would be out-of-sync with SAGA,
but practical.

Again, SAGA provides no tag information. It would have to be generated
programatically from library/module name & description or provided in
a list.
Any thoughts on the GUI for that tree? More like SAGA's module tree or
more like GIMP's filter menu? I don't think the
search/filter/favorites/frequently used part is very hard.. but still,
I will keep things simple.

Related topics:
* Interactive modules. I had this more or less resolved for SAGA (I
think), but designing a more generic solution could prove difficult.
* Pushing pipelining to the implementation: Potentially more
efficient, but less generic.
* Parameter value serialization: load and save "presets" to file
* Undo & redo ability.

I am eager to see what the OTB team has come up with. I am not very
familiar with that system, but from what I have seen their programming
interface is quite elegant.

Hi,
I cannot test on any of these 2 OSes, but just a hint (maybe):
In menu Settings/options, CRS tab, there are 3 different options on what
to do when a layer has no CRS. I would first check that they are
identical on both your platforms.

Hi Camilo, Hi all,

First of all congratulation for your GSoC project !

Some apologies for the delay in my response, we are approaching the next 
OTB release so I'm busy on fixing little stuff/builds here and there. 
Please don't expect real time answers in the next week or two.
But it's nice to see you left the starting blocks a while ago :)

For OTB we are developing a "module" framework also, with auto-generated 
interface. As I told people at the HF, we have made a first step with 
our last 3.8 release, but are not satisfied enough with the GUI part, so 
we are currently revamping the core to add a lot of functionnalities.

Our ideas/wish-list is summed up here :
http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/OTB-Wrapper

The current code for what we want to push into QGis is here (please note 
that it is in development, i've completed the first usefull app just 
after the HackFest) :
http://hg.orfeo-toolbox.org/OTB-Wrapper
Don't hesitate to ask me for help to build it if you need.


Some general comments :

[1]
We should be very careful about not being limited by "too much genericity".

The SAGA and GRASS modules have each their own design/parameter 
types/inner but also outer logic.
On the OTB side, we have some liberty since we are currently working on 
them, but we have some plans to integrate them in other tools, possibly 
benefiting from their additional possibilities (the pipeline 
capabilities of Monteverdi for example).
We have some ideas for making the GUI as dynamic as possible (and it is 
with their Qt/Qgis implementation that we plan to have the most 
full-featured GUI) but I guess other libs will have capabilities that we 
don't have.

Trying to fit everyone in the same framework will be hard : either each 
library (SAGA/GRASS/OTB) will only use a subset of the provided 
functionnalities, either we will end up taking the common factor of all 
libs and everyone will feel limited. I'm worried than we fall into one 
of these two pitfalls. Please do not impose to much constraints !

Reactions very welcome on this point !

What seems reasonable to me at first sight :
- using similar widgets for similar functionnalities/parameter types, 
maybe with base classes to reuse (but again make them really high level !).
- having a common way to call the modules
- all in all, make them all look the same
This will give the user the illusion that they all comes from the same 
library, but will give each implementation the necessary liberty to fine 
tune their GUIs using the specificities of their library/internal 
"module" framework.

We have the chance of being in a similar phase of development for both 
project, so i'm sure we will find the right common ground.

By the way, after SAGA, Grass and OTB, maybe someone will consider Ossim 
: they also have a similar framework for modules with autogenerated 
interfaces, to do raster processing.
Seeing Maxim presenting a Qgis classification plugin based on OpenCV, 
maybe you will also end up with some OpenCV modules in the future...

[2]
Chaining modules from different libraries seems a little ambitious to 
me, but this would be awesome !
As you said Camilo, I think we can leave pipelining out as a first step.
We are not really focusing on that part now neither, though the current 
implementation should allow this.


[3]
You seem to consider parameter validation only in an independent way

 From our experience it is insufficient (for example, absolute default 
values is not enough).
How we plan to solve this (trying to keep it simple also...), is to give 
our modules 3 main entry points :
- description of the parameters
- a global method to update all the parameters, called as soon as one 
parameter is changed
- an execution method

Let's imagine a simple orthorectification application with the following 
params :
- input/output image
- the output CRS
- output origin, size, and spacing
We want the origin, size and spacing to be auto-computed each time the 
input or CRS changes
If CRS changes from UTM to WGS84, we expect the outputorigin 
units/display to also change from meter to degree, for example.

[4] (related to [3])
Our first working-and-usefull application in this new framework we're 
building shows also dynamic parameters list in the GUI (see the 
screenshot on the Wiki).
It is a smoothing application with 3 modes: Median, Gaussian, 
Anisotropic Filtering.
Each mode has associated params. Median and Gaussian needs a radius, 
Anisotropic Filtering needs a time step and a number of iterations.
So below the combobox, the widget displayed depend on the combobox value.

[5]
The model we imagined for the parameter list will be a tree more than a 
flat list.
A group of parameters is just one node of the tree, containing a 
parameters list, where each parameter can also be a group of parameters.

Please see [3]
I fear it will be too limiting to consider parameters only independently

Yes basic/advanced parameters seems a must-have to me.
We want not experienced users to use the modules, but we surely want to 
give all the possible finetuning possibilities to those who "know what 
they're doing"


We would also want checkable parameters.
mandatory parameters should have a value.
non-mandatory parameters would have a checkbox to be activated.

Hierarchical tags seems very reasonable to me.

A list of default available tags should be provided.
If the developer feel it can't fit in those, then it can create a new tag.

Agreed.

I'm not sure this can be handled in the framework, but more in the 
different implementations.
The input images to our modules will be OTB specific data objects, and 
the transformation from QGis raster (= filename) to OTB raster would be 
done the OTB-QGis plugins implementation (you can check the current 
Smoothing application code).

Must-have also !

Having a common framework to report progress and log messages would be 
great.
If its in Qt, it should be through signals.
I already saw some code making a bridge between the OTB events framework 
and Qt signals, I'd like to reuse this.

It is the same approach used in GRASS: in fact, it is better (even if
not elegant, I agree) to be able to decide which options should be
exposed as default, and which ones as advanced). In fact it would be
also good to add a general option "user/power user"; in the first case
only default options will be exposed, in the second the full options.

I think filtering is often the easiest option.

All the best.

Looks very good, and in principle similar to what I was doing (or
trying to do) with SAGA, see github repo. But, from what I can tell,
is very OTB-specific. I am not sure how we can integrate this into a
common framework.

I feel in general QGIS should handle the GUI part.
That makes the framework usable in non-GUI contexts and only dependant
on QtCore (the non-QGIS side, I mean). In my test code I used a
QFormLayout, populated with Widgets according to the type of the
parameters alone. (screenshot linked from the "QGIS Processing
Framework" page)
I imagined the particular implementations using the existing Plugin
mechanism and thus having access to QgisInterface anyway, if really
necessary.

IMO, it is this genericity that would enable the different
implementations to talk to each other... inter-library pipelining
being possible if the parameter (including I/O) types match.

Compare the list of parameters for OTB and SAGA:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/List-of-parameters
I think a common ground can be found for most cases, while retaining
the ability to specify implementation-specific types.
That allows consistency in the user interface and easier scripting (no
need to worry about how each implementation handles each data type).

Agreed. The framework shouldn't impose any constraints. While it can
provide validators, data types, predefined tags, widgets, etc., each
implementation is free to create their own, or even talk directly to
QGIS, bypassing the framework, when necessary.

I think chaining modules is possible if input/ouput formats are well
defined. At least in a crude "execute module A, convert data, execute
module B" way.

Yes, very important point. One possibility would be to use signals to
connect the framework to each parameter's validator (to change
constraints) and to the module (to add/remove parameters, as per [4])

Ok. A generic list type could be defined as parameter type. Perhaps
implemented with QList<Parameter> (and add that to the QVariant union,
of course). Not to be confused with list-of-something parameters.

That shouldn't be too hard. I think it is ok to have the validator
handle that, accepting empty values if the parameter is optional.
It is a minor detail, but from a UI point of view, I wouldn't use
checkboxes, because it demands extra clicks from the end-user, but
rather use some icon and/or a bold typeface to identifiy mandatory
parameters. This sort of thing would have to be checked with people
more versed in UI design, though.

I think both the framework can provide a list of formats it
understands, and which it prefers (to avoid unnecessary conversion).
If the implementation understands one of those, no problem. Else, it
is up to the implementation to convert.

As with widgets, tags, and everything else: The framework provides
basic options, without forcing the implementation to use them.

Agreed. Actually, from the framework's point of view, events and
progress indicators and such can just be output parameters. And the
same mechanism that is used to update input parameters (for
validation, [3]) can be used to report back.

Well. Thanks, Julien, for your comments. You have a very clear picture
of the issues and limitations involved in this project and I really
appreciate the time you took in sharing it with us.
Also, I think in general we agree. Except, as I said before, I would
move as much of the GUI-related code from the implementation side to
the QGIS side to make it more-scripting friendly and consistent.

Of course, I am only starting with this and everything I said above
may very well be wrong or irrelevant. Please correct/criticize.

+1 for the concept of a "user/power user" checkbox.
You could call it "Always show advanced options" which is more neutral
(does not make any judgement on the user) and describes exactly what it
does.
Would be great to have an "Advanced options" checkbox on each window
anyway, to be able to switch their visibility on a case by case basis.

In addition, where relevant (functions that use command-line tools or
have command-line tools equivalent) and in advanced mode only, it would
be great to have the GUI generate the command line corresponding to the
options chosen in the GUI; the GUI would show this command line and let
the user edit it (or run it as it is). There are many advantages:
- the user knows exactly what is going to be executed; advanced QGIS
users will be able to use the GUI but benefit from existing help
targeted at the command-line users; debugging, sharing questions and
ideas in a forum or saving/automating a frequent task is facilitated
- you do not have to put very rare options in the GUI (power users can
still add the options here when they need it, which should be rare).

The idea is to partly bridge the gap between GUI and command line by
having the advantages of both (GUI is often easier, command line is
generally more powerful). This concept is used successfully in quite a
variety of software; just to give a few names:
- pgadmin (SQL preview of any schema modification)
- vlc (save, convert & broadcast functionalities)
- R (a few functions of the default Rgui; the Rcommander GUI package)...

Just my 2 cents. All the best for this work!

Agreed.

If it is a check-box, tab or toggle button would have to be
considered. I am under the impression that the latter is more common,
but I don't know the rationale behind.

Very good idea. It could even work both ways, and use that for
saving/loading parameter "presets".

The GUI would be auto-generated, so adding parameters means no extra
programming effort. Not putting things on the GUI would, thus, be a UI
design decision, to keep it from being cluttered.

Wow. This is getting more and more ambitious. Will have to see what
fits in only 1 summer :)

Agreed also. I like this "standard/advanced" user idea.

I'm no GUI expert so I'll let the decision to professionals.
If I understand Paolo's point right, there would be also a "config"  
toggle, where the end user can configure which parameters he wants  
standard, and which he wants advanced.

I like this also.

And what about the other way around ? So that you can open the GUI,  
copy/paste a command line, then further refine the parameters with the  
cool widgets of the GUI.

Do not agree on this one.
If it is advanced mode, let it be advanced and show everything.

It will be simpler. Otherwise the parameter model would need to have  
functionnalities to tell the framework "ok, this parameter is  
advanced, but still, please don't show it in GUIs".
Or you want standard/advanced/guru ?

Sorry I was unclear: I meant to have a general option, where an user can
choose its level. If he selects "normal", only simple options will be
shown (with a button for advanced, see GRASS plugin); if "power", an
extended set of options will be shown. Possibly one could selest "master
of known universe" and have all the possible option.

That would be great.

That is a possibility, see above.

Do not worry about this, we do not miss ambitious ideas ;)
Just to say one, we should make all of QGIS scriptable, one day.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plans for the 1.7 Release
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Rs6vGjv9Wp1QS3E+VCvCvV27=9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I just wanted to recap a little for those who were not present at the
hackfest our plans for the roll out of 1.7. This release will be a
little more involved since we are going to simultaneously migrate to
GIT and Redmine. Here is a little synopsis of what is going to be
happening:

Branching 1.7

- Translation period will come to an end on friday evening (29 April)
after which we will create the release branch for 1.7 (actual
branching will happen sometime on the 30th).
- 1.7 will be the last public release of the 1.x series.
- If developer effort supports it we will make 1.7.x bug fix releases
in the interim until the 2.0 release
- 1.9.x releases will be made but not widely announced and will break
api compatibility and deprecate various features
- 1.9.x and possible maintenance of 1.7.x releases will be done from GIT

Svn -> Git Migration

- Migration will take place immediately after branching for 1.7
release but before call for packaging and release announcements
- We will revoke svn write access for all committers
- We will git svn clone qgis into a git repository
- We will prune out the various sub projects so that the QGIS git
repository represents only the QGIS code base itself and not code
examples and other things found under trunk.
- We will create additional repositories for each of the other
subdirectories in trunk.
- We will push the clones into github.org/qgis which will then become
the official repo
- We will reinstate commit access for svn committers but to the git
repo now instead.

Trac -> Redmine Migration

- Migration will take place immediately after branching for 1.7
release but before call for packaging and release announcements
- We will ask OSGEO for a backup of our current trac instance,
including uploaded resources etc.
- We will redeploy that backup on qgis.org
- We will install the trac git plugin
- We will migrate the svn commit references to git commit hash references
- We will run the trac -> redmine migration scripts to migrate the tickets
- We will ask osgeo to make the old trac instance read only and put a
redirector in place pointing to our redmine instance.

Release

- We will include in the release announcements a notice about the
GIT/Redmine migration, with pointers to required urls, documentation
etc.
- We will issue a call for packaging against the release branch in git
so that packaging related changes can be committed there directly

Rollback Option

Naturally making such a large change to our infrastructure involves
some risk. For this reason, existing svn and trac infrastructure will
not be removed for some time and will be simply made readonly at the
time of switch over. If we encounter any major issues during the
changeover process we will remove the readonly status of svn & trac,
evaluate the issues and come up with solutions, and then repeat the
process at a later date. Obviously this will be disruptive too and we
will make our best effort to avoid such actions being required.

Help & Discussion

The decision to do the migration has already been take at the
hackfest, but if anyone has implementation specific ideas or concerns
lets hear them. Also if you are a GIT ninja or a Redmine black belt,
and would like to make the migration happen smoothly, please let me
know as I will appreciate any helping hands.

Tim

Hi Otto

I think it is fairly up to date, but note the email I just sent to the
dev list about git migration - the coding & compilation guide is
probably one area that will need updating to reflect the new urls and
procedures.

Hi

I just wanted to add following an offlist conversation with Juergen
that self hosting the git repository on qgis.org is also an option and
then cloning it over to github. Feel free to discuss if you have a
preferred way of doing things.

I should look into this QFormLayout...
I'm still a Qt newbie, and in no way a GUI specialist so input on the 
good classes to use is warmly welcome.

I'd like this framework to keep some of the freedom of the current QGis 
plugin system, where you can almost do what you want.
I feel this is how anything will become integrable in Qgis.

 From my point of view, the Qgis common ground is all about :
- getting raster/vector layers as input, and producing raster/vector 
layer as output.
- having a Qt based interface using widgets which are as similar as 
possible when they represent similar concepts, which fit Qgis UI guidelines
- having Python interfaces

The rest seems implementation-specific to me.
Do we really want to add a bunch of other "Qgis data types" ?

To say it differently : Forget SAGA! Forget OTB! Think QGis!
It would be nice to have some inputs from the GRASS gurus for example, a 
software I don't know much.
I guess this is again another complete set of parameter types.

Yes !
At least I see that (easily?) possible for raster/vector layers I/O.

Yes. As said before I'm no GUI specialist, so opinion from the QGis GUI 
masters will be very valuable here.

No, be sure I don't have a clear picture in mind yet, I only have a wish 
list of what I'd like to do with the OTB modules in Qgis ;)

I completely disagree ;)
You're giving very insightful comments here, thank you !

You can check it very easily: every module can be queried with 
  module.name --interface-description
See http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Adding_New_Tools_to_the_GRASS_Toolbox
Yes, I'm trying to bring GRASS gurus in.
All the best.

I think this is a good idea, and git will allow this so I'm thinking  
why not.

Hi all,

Self-hosting has some advantages but needs quite some work done. I think, http 
(and https?) transport would be a must. I recently looked at http read-only 
support with Apache, but this would require a dist-upgrade of the machine. The 
current git infrastructure on qgis.org is not made for large-scale use (it was 
a side-project of the Redmine installation). Maybe the KDE infrastructure 
(http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual) would be more appropriate.
If somebody is willing to improve and maintain the git infrastructure, than it 
is certainly an option.
I prefer github as the main repository for QGIS. The "fork me" functionality 
gives a great new way for contributions of people outside of the core team. 
Everybody can start a public topic branch and send pull requests. Currently, I 
would neither use the issue tracker nor the Wiki of github - but the 
repository viewer is great.

Pirmin

Dear qgis developer,
here are my two cent from the point of view of a GRASS GIS, VTK and
wps-grass-bridge developer :

IMHO most of these features which are discussed here are covered by
the Web Processing Service
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps.

WPS is an OGC standard for a generic interface description to run
processes from different software packages/libraries as web service.

The following GIS software/libraries are already available as web
processing services:

ArcGIS via 52North WPS
SEXTANTE  via 52North WPS
GRASS GIS via 52North WPS, PyWPS and ZOO WPS using the wps-grass-bridge

A lot of work has been done to integrate these GIS packages as web
processing service back-ends, so you can use them out of the box and
avoid redundant implementations of the same idea.

The support of the OGC WPS standard in QGIS will allow you to:
- use open standards for interface descriptions
- Integrate the existing WPS server and there processes (~400?) as
algorithms into QGIS
- chain/orchestrate WPS processes from different back-ends
- directly integrate WFS and WCS sources as inputs without the need of
local storage
- Working with QGIS on a silent and long running computer in the
office while the processing is done on a heavy and fast server in the
basement

A special feature: The processing can be done in the cloud using QGIS
as a client: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg2pb_Xjq8Y

QGIS will be completely independent from minor or major changes in the
WPS back-ends (new GRASS GIS or SEXTANE versions, ... ) which is IMHO
a huge advantage.

I would suggest to implement an outstanding WPS client for QGIS and to
help others to integrate more GIS software and libraries as back-ends
in existing open source WPS server.

Horst D?ster and i have implemented a nice prototype which can be seen
in action here:

Hi all,

I have a PostGIS layer with multiple geometries: POINT, MULTIPOINT,
LINESTRING and MULTILINESTRING.

I tried to add a layer in this way:

  uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
  uri.setConnection ("cartografia", "5432", "schema", "postgres", "pppp")
  uri.setSql ("sql=GeometryType('wkb_geometry') IN
('LINESTRING','MULTILINESTRING')")
  self.iface.addVectorLayer (uri.uri(), tab, "postgres")

but QGIS complains that it cannot add GEOMETRY types. How can threat this
layer as LINESTRING ?

I would strongly prefer to have the module tree shown in something
like QTreeWidget - I guess that is what you mean by SAGA's module
tree. What we have right now is similar to GIMP's filter menu and for
many users it gets too long and inefficient to use.

I don't think adding these features would be hard. A very important
thing in projects like this one is to stay focused on the primary
target and to keep the scope limited to a reasonable set of features.
More bells and whistles can be typically added later.

As you suggested in other post, the model of executing one module

Not really necessary, skip it.

Many thanks for the pointer. I am looking into it right now. I kinda

Those are quite convincing arguments. Also, it would have the
advantage of being a clearly defined standard, and probably better
thought-out than what we could come up in short time. Your prototype
looks very nice, too.

Yes. See my "SAGA modules plugin" prototype, where I tried to imitate
SAGA's interface:
http://www2.udec.cl/~cpolymeris/QGIS_Screenshot_04032011.png
Add an editable combo box to the top of the tree, to filter for tags
or names. Maybe a "recently used modules" tree node.

Agreed. I am looking into the WPS thing now. If it is decided that it
would work for us, I would primarly focus on the WPS-SAGA layer. And
secondarily on helping Soeren & Horst with their WPS QGIS plugin.

Mmm. I was thinking a possible solution would be to handle parameters
through Qt's signal mechanism. Then, the QGIS side could implement
passing values to those parameters from any source, including e.g.
clicks on canvas. Even the state of the plugin (initialization,
runnning, stopped, etc) could be handled as parameter, thus allowing
QGIS to signal the implementation to start, pause, continue, cancel,
etc.

The point is actually not to provide every possible parameter type in
the framework. IMO we should have a base "parameter" type with several
common types such as integer, string, vector layer, enumeration. Such
types are used widely and QGIS would come with default edit widgets
for them.

Then, each library might require some additional parameter types that
might also require special editing widgets. The plugin implementing
support for such library will provide these types and editing widgets,
however they will stay opaque for QGIS. So in the result QGIS will
just know there is a parameter and it will know what widget to show in
the form, nothing more. Of course such custom types would not be
usable across various libraries, but that fine.

I don't know if anyone of you is experienced with web development, but
I see a nice parallel between models and views in web frameworks such
and Django and the processing framework here:
- in Django you define models consisting of common and/or custom
fields (integer, text, list etc) - here we talk about modules and
their parameters. Django then provides functionality like
loading/saving models from/to database, here we would provide running
of the modules.
- in Django you get a default html form for a model, but you can
customize it and provide further checking etc. Here QGIS would provide
default GUI for a module based on the description, with the
possibility for the developer to improve the basic behavior using Qt
signals and slots for a better user experience.

Therefore I tend to think about the whole procesing framework in two levels:
1. backend - similar to WPS: an interface for description of modules,
querying the modules and running them
2. gui - built on top of the backend, enhancing the usability and
experience for the user:

In the GUI part there are endless possibilities how to improve the
experience: the developer might want to add a preview for a module
that does some raster processing. Or the developer might add
interactive rectangle selection from map canvas for choosing a region
of interest for the analysis.

I completely agree that many times the dependencies between the
parameters are far too complex to be modelled in a declarative way. I
hope my answer above clarifies this: you as a developer of the
orthorectification module would be allowed to watch for changes in the
form (using Qt signals) and update other parameters - or do whatever
you want.

Well, I'm a bit afraid of trees of parameters. Would that be really
necessary for OTB?

Probably I was not very clear that statement - but I have actually the
same opinion as you do: the format conversions should be handled
within the plugin implemented support for a given library. The
framework should not care about that at all.

I agree that all these are very good reasons for having WPS support in
QGIS. It makes sense in a lot of use cases. Still I do not think we
should concentrate exclusively on WPS services for processing for
several reasons:
- the community creates lots of handy plugins, many of them are used
for processing. It is not just SAGA, OTB, GRASS or OSSIM that could
use the framework - we are speaking about many more possible modules
that probably will never be implemented as WPS services.
- WPS servers are IMHO not really widespread yet(?). Surely you can
install your own on a local computer but I don't think that an average
user is able to manage it with few clicks. And not everyone has access
to a fast server in basement.
- usability matters - a lot of work can be done by only editing few
parameters and running the process, but there are plenty of cases
where more interactivity is desired as mentioned also by Julien and
Camilo: that could be a complex dependency between input parameters or
a possibility for interactive picking of points from map canvas.

The reasons above make me believe that we shouldn't depend exclusively
on WPS. In my vision WPS should be simply another provider of
processing modules next to SAGA, OTB or various other smaller plugins.
WPS itself simply cannot deliver the rich user interface that we would
like to provide.

WMS via WMS plugin or via GDAL?

Luca, isn't it duplicate of this ticket

No magic, just  #3766 / r15798.  Problem was that stdin of QGIS (MSVC) was

I have 'fixed' it so that it does not crash, but it does not draw
anything reasonable.
It seems to take always the same source latitude.

Fixed (partially), the problem was calculation of source extent.

Source limits are not necessarily on destination edges, e.g. for
destination EPSG:32661 - Polar Stereographic and source EPSG:4326,
the source maximum y may be in the middle of destination extent. How
to find the source extent exactly and quickly?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use of Spatialite in a Python plugin for QGIS?
Message-ID: <BANLkTikUMb295CefZroJ2D-W4dFuuo=exQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We are currently developing a Python Plugin for QGIS. We use
SpatiaLite to manage some data. What we want to do is, querying a
SpatiaLite database from a Python Plugin. We were able to get it to
work with SQLite, using the following code:

self.db = QSqlDatabase.addDatabase("QSQLITE")
self.db.setDatabaseName("path.to.db.file")
if self.db.open() == False:
    raise "Connection Error!"
query = QSqlQuery(self.db)
query.exec_("SELECT sqlite_version()")
if query.isActive():
    print str(query.value(0).toString()) #
else:
    raise str(query.lastError().databaseText ())
query.finish()

But when we try using a spatialite-function, like "SELECT
spatialite_version()", the query fails with "no such function:
spatialite_version". We tried to load the spatialite-Extension
manually, using "SELECT load_extension('libspatialite-2.dll');", but
that resulted in an exception "not authorized".

Our question is: What has to be done to use spatialite in a python-plugin?

There is pyspatialite(http://code.google.com/p/pyspatialite/), but we
would prefer using libraries already included in QGIS.
Thanks for your help.

Yours, Stefan and Tobias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatialite views not working in QGIS
Message-ID: <BANLkTik0W2CHFFdSDD-QHVkUf3Sf7UHpPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use views from a Spatialite data source but get errors
and misbehaviour all over the place... This is what I did:

I first downloaded test-2.3.sqlite from
http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/resources.html .

There is a table with point geometry called Towns in this sample database.

Based on this I created two views, called Towns_v1 and Towns_v2 using
spatialite-gui:

CREATE VIEW Towns_v1 AS
  SELECT t.PK_UID, Name, Peoples, t.Geometry from Towns t;
CREATE VIEW Towns_v2 AS
  SELECT t.PK_UID, Name, CAST(Peoples + 1 AS INTEGER) Peoples1,
t.Geometry from Towns t;

... and added the required info in "system" table geometry_columns:
INSERT INTO geometry_columns VALUES ('Towns_v1', 'Geometry', 'POINT',
2, 32632, 0);
INSERT INTO geometry_columns VALUES ('Towns_v2', 'Geometry', 'POINT',
2, 32632, 0);

Now looking at all field data types:
PRAGMA table_info("Towns_v2");
0 PK_UID   INTEGER  0 NULL  0
1 Name     TEXT     0 NULL  0
2 Peoples1          0 NULL  0
3 Geometry POINT    0 NULL  0

=> Problem/Error (from SQlite): Field Peoples1 from table Towns_v2
shows no data type! (although there is a cast!!). That's a SQlite
problem originating probably because of its "dynamic/lazy data type"
concept.


But then I started QGIS (1.7) and Spatialite data source opened
test-2.3.sqlite:

=> Problem/Error in QGIS (1): Doing a "Open Attribute Table" (from
right click menu) on Layer 'Towns_v1' and 'Towns_v2' shows ERROR
values all over the place. <<

=> Problem/Error in QGIS (2): Selection of a feature object Layer
'Towns_v1' and 'Towns_v2' does not work. <<

Any ideas?

Yours, Stefan

G_getl2 was hanging up waiting for '\n' after '\r', right?

Hi Stefan,

Better read this one (below) to fix some of the problems you mentioned.

http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0-4/splite-python.html

Please note on this caveat found in the document above.

"Caveat
The most recent QGIS versions (1.6 / 1.7 trunk) are actually using
SpatiaLite v.2.4.0 so any Python plugin using the previous v.2.3.1 can
easily cause conflicts due to version incompatilibiles. And this fully
accounts for any issue noticed by QGIS users".

No, it was crashing.  I assume MSVC and MinGW are using different FILE
structures in their stdio - so passing stdin from MSVC to MinGW doesn't work.

If GRASS has a library function that does fdopen on 0, we could probably use
that and stick with G_getl2().  But I figured fgets() does the same thing here.

Hi Stefan,

after all SpatiaLite isn't at all PostGIS:
the underlying arch is a completely different one

please consult the appropriate documentation:

+1. Furthermore, if we limit the possible integration to the WPS-enabled

Hi Sandro

Thanks for the hints.
SQLite claims to be a mostly SQL compliant database and offers views.
So if views are there and work - except for Towns_v2 - with other
clients, why should'nt this work in QGIS?

Yours, S.

I actually saw this note but I thought this was resolved since then.
So, are you saying that Spatialite can't be used out of Python plugins
for QGIS versions (1.6 / 1.7 trunk) in the meantime?

QGIS has an internal pyspatialite.  Using that should be fine.

Hi Stefan,

quick answer, but exhaustive (so I hope):

a) yes, that's true: SQLite fully supports VIEWs
  with no odd limitations

b) anyway, SQLite support for Spatial Index (R*Tree)
  is completely different from anything else: on
  SQLite the Spatial Index is a separate table, and
  you are required to explicitly perform a sub-query
  in order to take profit from a Spatial Index when
  it's available (please note: the QGIS own data provider
  silently handles all this in a completely painless way)

c) accordingly to all this, SpatiaLite defines any
  Spatial VIEW on VIEWS_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS (not on
  GEOMETRY_COLUMNS): and this allows to fully support 
  Spatial Index for VIEWs as well

IMHO installing a WPS server with different back-ends is no magic. The
web server, the WPS server and the back-ends can be bundled and
installed as easy as QGIS with all its plugins and libraries and third
party dependencies. This is technically no problem and IMHO the
52North guys are able to provide such an out of the box solution.

With WPS you can chain very complex processes with complex
dependencies, the interface description is in this case very powerful.
You are indeed totally right that its not possible to have interaction
with in principle state-less WPS processes. But you can have
interaction between processes with the intermediate generated results
in a process chain. This is a question of how to design process chains
with interaction and how specialized the available processes are.

This is a good point. Maybe you can use the WPS specification as the
base technology and extend it with additional features which will not
break compatibility. Then you will use an OGC standard and you will be
able to integrate WPS processes out of the box in the much more
powerful framework with the possibility of chaining any kind of
processes?

You will still need wrapper for each software you want to integrate to
wrap there interface into the abstract QGIS process framework. So the
design of a really powerful abstract process framework providing
interaction and stuff is a lot of work and needs plenty of knowledge
about all the software which might be integrated as processes in QGIS.
To get an idea of the amount of work: Several very intelligent people
have designed the WPS specification and they needed several years to
version 1.0.0.

My main concern is the manpower which is needed to implement AND
maintain such a framework as well as the wrapper and binding for other
software packages. For example the GRASS GIS integration in QGIS. If
there is nobody in the GRASS GIS or QGIS community who is willingly to
take responsibility and time to maintain, update and extend it, it
will be unusable in the future or it will depend on an obsolete or
buggy GRASS GIS version.

I am absolutely not against a cool abstract process framework in QGIS,
but i would like to bring some IMHO important considerations into
discussion.

Best regards
Soeren

Isn't it 52north in java? This will introduce a dependency on java that
is IMHO unacceptable for QGIS.

I do not agree: wrapping GRASS and GdalTools was a fast and effective
process IMHO.

This is true,and will be true regardless of the kind of implementation
we will choose. My idea is that moving as much as possible to a common
analytical framework we'll be able to join forces in a more effective
way.

Yes, we all appreciate that. Very interesting discussion.
All the best.

OK, it seems a good balance.
Is this good time to begin laying down this list somewhere ?

Any idea about how to handle the 'non Qgis supported' parameters types 
for the Python API ?

Are signals and slots sufficient ?
Maybe being able to provide a subclass of the default Qgis supported 
widgets would be cool ?

Maybe doing band selection and region of interest selection on input 
rasters is general enough to be supported by the framework

Yes it's more clear.
We should consider not only being able to update the parameters values, 
but also the GUI part (changing some widget settings, eventually even 
changing the widget class somehow ?).

Don't worry too much, we are not planning to have 42 nested level of 
parameters...

Having "groups" of parameters is a need.
If I'm not wrong, SAGA has this also (it's called Node). Camilo ?

Also we want to have parameters shown only depending on a combobox 
value, for example.
So a choice parameter value is declared with both what to show in the 
combobox, and an associated "parameter group".
Please see at the end of 
http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/OTB-Wrapper.
If in this group you have another choice parameter, you end up with a 
tree...

If you have a good idea to model that in a simpler way, I'll take it.
Flat parameter model, but the GUI can rearrange/show/hide them dynamically ?

I'm OK with the idea of limiting this to 2 levels max for example (no 
groups inside groups).



Best regards,
Julien

Hello,

I have the same opinion as Martin and Paolo.
 From our point of view, WPS services would just be another place to 
wrap our modules.

Anyway, I agree with the fact that there shall be a lot of ideas to get 
inspiration from, so that :
- WPS services can be integrated in the Qgis framework out of the box
- Any Qgis processing modules can be wrapped in a future "Qgis WPS 
server" (?)
- We can reuse all the good ideas from the WPS standard

Cool! So, what can I do?

Just replace this statement:
<< INSERT INTO GEOMETRY_COLUMNS VALUES ('Towns_v1', 'Geometry',
'POINT', 2, 32632, 0);
to this?

I agree that technically there are no serious problems. But still
adding further layers of software (wps client + wps server with a
backend) between user and the underlying analysis library increases
the risk of problems with distribution of the software and
configuration (e.g. should such bundled WPS server run as a service
all the time or only start it on request? should the server be
available only for the user who starts it or for everyone?).

I think we are converging to an API very similar to WPS interface. It
makes sense to use the WPS specification to match the data types and
the protocol - so that building a WPS client and/or WPS server on top
of it should be simple.

As I explained in one of the previous mails, the framework in my
opinion should consist of two concepts:
1. API for execution of modules (WPS-like): describe module, set
parameters, execute module, get results. No interactivity at this
stage (apart from progress/log information)
2. API for rich user interface for modules: auto-generation of dialogs
for modules, facilities for overriding default behavior

It needs to be designed properly (not too generic and not too
constrained) but I think this is no rocket science.

Just a side note: standards always take years to get designed and
approved. The time and number of people involved in the creation of a
specification does not necessarily correlate with its overall
usefulness and adoption by the industry. (I am speaking in general,
not related to WPS!)

You are right that it is easy to run out of manpower for maintenance.
The framework itself will not require a lot of maintenance once
implemented, a bigger problem might be with outdated adapters for
libraries. Sometimes a new soul arrives willing to fix some bugs,
sometimes the code is left for extinction.

We are indeed happy that you have joined the discussion!

Hi Stefan,

just a simple practical example:

CREATE TABLE a_test (
  code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  category TEXT);
  
CREATE TABLE b_test (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  code INTEGER,
  name TEXT);
SELECT AddGeometryColumn(
  'b_test', 'geom', 4326, 'POINT', 'XY');

CREATE VIEW vw_test AS
SELECT b.id AS pk_id, b.code AS code,
  a.category AS category, 
  b.name AS name, b.geom AS the_geom
FROM b_test AS b
JOIN a_test AS a ON (a.code = b.code);

INSERT INTO views_geometry_columns
(view_name, view_geometry, view_rowid,
  f_table_name, f_geometry_column)
VALUES ('vw_test', 'the_geom', 'pk_id',
  'b_test', 'geom');

Message-ID: <975551.68921.qm@web33705.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear QGIS Gurus:
I have a written a plugin that updates an attribute of a shape file and it tells me it ran fine and yet, I am not able to see the changes in the attribute table once the program finishes. I am using QGIS 1.6 Copiapo on Windows). I am compiling using the 1.7 source, but I have tried using the trunk version and it does not seem to matter at all.

I can see the edit starting with all the extent selected and it finishes without an error. I also write a log file before and after the feature attribute change and the feature values change correctly.
What am i doing wrong?

The simplified code is posted below,

? ?? ? ? ? QgsVectorDataProvider* vProvider = theVectorLayer->dataProvider();
? ?? ? ? ? theVectorLayer->select(vProvider->attributeIndexes(), 
? ?? ? ? ? theVectorLayer->extent(), true, false);
? ?? ? ? ? QgsFeature currentFeature;
? ?? ? ? ? QgsGeometry* currentGeometry = 0;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bool blnEdit = theVectorLayer->startEditing();
? ?? ? ? ? QgsAttributeList attrList = vProvider->attributeIndexes();
? ?? ?vProvider->select(attrList);

Hello,

Some final thoughts before the week end :

- Even though its clear that the main objective is to have this 
framework well integrated in Qgis, it would be nice if it could be 
accessed without running Qgis, at least for the "back end" part. Being 
able to access it through a standard Python shell would be very usefull. 
I think it converges with Paolo's idea of having a scriptable Qgis.

- Having the backend accessible through a C/C++ interface would then be 
great , so that we can access it not only from Python, but also from 
other non-Python-compatible langages/applications (say Java for example, 
to be able to integrate it in current state of the art WPS implementations)

- Being able to run each module GUI independently, outside Qgis, would 
be nice also. Less sure on this one... At least not the priority.

For the OTB modules we have some other target applications where we 
would like to push our modules. I'm now seeing things in a much wider 
scope thanks to this discussion, and I'm telling myself we should handle 
things one step above : it is probably the Qgis framework that we will 
want to wrap in other applications.
As already said, using as much manpower as possible from the open source 
community is important so that it becomes a success story.


Maybe those points are obvious to all of you, just wanted to mention 
them to be sure.

And I know : one step at a time ;)

Best regards,
Julien

Camilo has started a wiki page regarding the parameter types, so that
is probably a good starting point:
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/List-of-parameters

It would be good to make a also review of GRASS and WPS types at the same time.


> Any idea about how to handle the 'non Qgis supported' parameters types for
> the Python API ?

This is how I think the API could look like - take it as a _very_ rough draft:

1. query module's parameters

>>> framework.getModules()
[ 'SAGA_Module1', 'GRASS_ModuleABC', 'FooModule' ]
>>> module = framework.getModule('SAGA_Module1')
>>> module.getParameters()
{ 'a' : ParameterInfo(type='int', default=321),
  'b' : ParameterInfo(type='RasterLayer', default=None),
  'c' : ParameterInfo(type='CustomSaga', default=<CustomSagaParameter>)
}

>From this you can see that QGIS would know the basic types such as
integer or layer, for the custom parameter types (e.g. a list of
points) it would only know the type name, the value would be opaque -
known only to the implementer.

2. execute modules (considering 3 input parameters and one output layer)

>>> module.setParameter('a', 123)
>>> module.setParameter('b', mylayer)
>>> module.setParameter('c', CustomSagaParam(1,2,3))
>>> module.execute()
>>> newlayer = module.output()

or with more Python syntax sugar:

>>> module.execute( a = 123, b = mylayer, c = CustomSagaParam(1,2,3) )
>>> newlayer = module.output()

Here we create an instance of the custom parameter type. The caller
has to know how to create the instance, QGIS only passes this custom
value to the implementation.

3. implement a module

class CustomSagaParam( QgsParameter ):
  def __init__(self, ...):
    # initialization of the parameter's value
  def type(self): # unique type name of the parameter type
    return 'CustomSaga'

>>> framework.registerParameterType( 'CustomSaga' )

This is an implementation of a custom parameter type. It would be
derived from abstract QgsParameter class (also parent of basic types
like QgsIntParameter or QgsRasterLayerParameter). It has to provide
type name so that QGIS knows the type. The custom parameter types
should be probably also registered to the framework so that QGIS can
perform sanity checks whether module's parameter types are fine.

class SagaModule( QgsModule ):
  def __init__(self, name, parameters):
     # store the name and parameters

  def execute():
    # prepare a command for OS from the parameters or execute it using API

QgsModule should be an abstract base class from the framework, it
would allow querying/setting parameters, all modules would have to
implement execute() method. This SagaModule is a generic
implementation for running all saga modules. Then during runtime the
SAGA plugin (adapter) will enumerate available modules in SAGA library
and create instances of SagaModule for them with appropriate names and
parameters:

>>> framework.addModule( SagaModule( name = 'Module1', parameters = { ... } )


[I hope it makes some sense]

Custom subclasses should be supported - after all that's usually most
logical place where to do the signals/slots business.

We could probably handle this with three possible cases:
- the default (auto-generated) GUI is fine - no changes
- the default GUI should be improved - a subclass just adds some bells
and whistles
- the default GUI is not sufficient - a completely custom GUI is used instead

These cases bring various stages of flexibility with different amounts
of required maintenance.

I would be more happy with flat parameter model. The rearangements of
GUI are doable. In Qt there is QStackedWidget class that basically
places several forms into one piece of space and allows the programmer
to select the current form as he likes.

Yes. Sounds good.

I am still trying to keep this thing updated with the insights from
this thread, at least, things I think there is somewhat of a
consensus.
https://github.com/polymeris/qgis/wiki/QGIS-Processing-Framework

Anyone is welcome to edit the page.

Keep them opaque. Implementation responsible for supplying python
functions to handle them, if desired.

Both, but in general signals should be enough, I think. Most
parameters are enumerations, numeric values, etc. after all.

Agreed. GUI on the QGIS side, unless necessary.

I was calling the later a "Rect" parameter.
This is a list of parameters I think could be supported by the
framework (much more thought can be put into it, this is just a
starting point):

    Raster = OTB Image = SAGA Grid
    Vector = OTB vector data = SAGA Shape
    URL = OTB File name = OTB Directory name = SAGA FilePath
    String = OTB String = SAGA String = SAGA Text = default for
everything not covered
    Boolean = OTB Boolean = SAGA Bool
    Number = OTB Numeric = OTB Radius = SAGA Int = SAGA Double
    Enumeration = OTB Choice = SAGA Choice
    Tuple = OTB Origin = OTB Size = SAGA Range
    Rect = OTB Region = SAGA Rect
    Point = OTB Point/Index = SAGA Point
    List = OTB Parameter group = SAGA Grid List, Shapes_List, etc.

Yes, exactly! I have updated my "mock-up API" to reflect this.

You could actually even remove parameters and add others, change the
state of the module, etc. Everything that is possible in other
contexts.  Then fire a signal to tell the framework to re-read what
has changed.

You are right.

This would be implemented like this: Upon change of combobox value the
implementation is signaled and can change its parameters. The
implementation then signals the framework to reread the parameter list
and rebuild the GUI accordingly.

Do you agree with such an approach?

See above.

If we implement parameter groups, there is no reason to limit the
number of levels, IMO, except as a convention to keep the GUI and
Python API more or less usable.

That's currently not an option.   And the mapserver also depends on Qt.

Message-ID: <1304104481.2085.18.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

after the recent updates of both GRASS (to 6.4.1), QGIS (both trunk and
1.6) and the QGIS/GRASS plugin, GRASS is no more available in QGIS.

Should I file a ticket in the osgeo4w trac?

cheers

Hi all,

it  seems  that  recent changes upto r15846  (125th  nightly build) bring some trouble in
raster    rendering.   It  appears as horizontal lines stretching from
one part of raster. Stangely  this  happens  while  opening  existing
projects,  if rasters are reloaded in fresh new project errors are not
appearing.

Tried on two machines. Here are some examples from the same project.

http://gis-lab.info/images/screenshots/20110430-4en-245kb.jpg
http://gis-lab.info/images/screenshots/20110430-8c0-86kb.jpg
If  rasters  are  reloaded to the same project the artifacts are still
there.

Reverting to previous nightly build (124th) solves the issue.

qgis-1.6.0-7 and qgis-dev-1.7.0-127 should fix that.

Message-ID: <34132.55386.qm@web33705.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Is editing an existing shape file using C++ supported in QGIS 1.6? Almost all of the tools create a new shape file instead of updating the existing one. I would like to not waste my time if it is not possible to modify/overwrite an existing data file.

Thank you,

Dear QGIS Gurus:
I have a written a plugin that updates an attribute of a shape file and it tells me it ran fine and yet, I am not able to see the changes in the attribute table once the program finishes. I am using QGIS 1.6 Copiapo on Windows). I am compiling using the 1.7 source, but I have tried using the trunk version and it does not seem to matter at all.

I can see the edit starting with all the extent selected and it finishes without an error. I also write a log file before and after the feature attribute change and the feature values change correctly.
What am i doing wrong?

The simplified code is posted below,

? ?? ? ? ? QgsVectorDataProvider* vProvider = theVectorLayer->dataProvider();
? ?? ? ? ? theVectorLayer->select(vProvider->attributeIndexes(),
 
? ?? ? ? ? theVectorLayer->extent(), true, false);
? ?? ? ? ? QgsFeature currentFeature;
? ?? ? ? ? QgsGeometry* currentGeometry = 0;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bool blnEdit = theVectorLayer->startEditing();
? ?? ? ? ? QgsAttributeList attrList = vProvider->attributeIndexes();
? ?? ?vProvider->select(attrList);
? ?? ?blnFeat = vProvider->nextFeature(currentFeature);
? ?? ?QgsAttributeMap atMap1;
? ?? ? ? ? ?vProvider->createSpatialIndex();
? ?? ?QgsAttributeList attrList = vProvider->attributeIndexes();
? ?? ?vProvider->select(attrList);
? ?? ?blnFeat =
 vProvider->nextFeature(currentFeature);
? ?? ?QgsAttributeMap atMap1;
? ?? ?QString featureAttributesString;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? int ltsVal = 10;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? int ltsFldIdx = 1;
? ?? ?QVariant fld0 ;
? ?? ?while(blnFeat)
? ?? ?{
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?atMap1 = currentFeature.attributeMap();
? ?? ?? ?fld0 = atMap1.value(0);
? ?? ?? ?currentGeometry = currentFeature.geometry();
? ?? ?? ?if(!currentGeometry)
? ?? ?? ?{
? ?? ?? ?? ?continue;
? ?? ?? ?} 
? ?? ??
 ?else
? ?? ?? ?{
? ?? ?? ?? ?currentFeature.changeAttribute(ltsFldIdx,QVariant(ltsVal));? ?? ?? ?? ?
? ?? ?? ?}
? ?? ?? ?blnFeat = vProvider->nextFeature(currentFeature);
? ?? ?}
? ?? ?blnAttrAdded = theVectorLayer->commitChanges();
? ?? ?theVectorLayer->endEditCommand();

Changes to the feature buffer filled by QgsVectorLayer::nextFeature() are not
propagated to the layer.

Use QgsVectorLayer::changeAttributeValue() [1].

Hi,

when I compile qgis trunk and install it in a local folder
(e.g. /software/qgis_trunk) all is fine except for the GRASS plugin. The
libraries are build, but it is not selectable in the Plugin Manager. 

Does anybody know where the problem is?

It probably doesn't find the grass shared libraries.  Did you add
/opt/grass/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf or LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

yes, it is written here in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/grass-6.4.1.conf 
/opt/grass/lib

which is linked to /etc/ld.so.conf

Ok.  If you ran ldconfig after that I'm out of ideas.  You might find what's
wrong using strace...

Hi Marco

completely remove your build directory, then configure, build and
install qgis again.

You should wrap the values into QVariant type from PyQt4.QtCore like this:

newvalues = { fid : { 3 : QVariant("lima"), 4 : QVariant("city") }}

Your original code actually crashes on my computer, there is something
wrong with the conversion Python -> QGIS conversion when not wrapping
the values into QVariant. I will probably have a closer look into
that.

The lastError() method is currently used for showing errors from
rendering, not from layer load stage. When the layer fails to load,
usually a QgsMessageOutput class is used to send a message to the user
about the cause. In QGIS application a dialog pops up with the
message. If you are developing a custom application, the default
behavior is to print this to console. It is possible to set a custom
message handler in order to process these errors in an appropriate
way.

Do you run this code

I might want to have a deeper look at the str/unicode business in Python:
http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/

What is the type of 'value' variable? Isn't it a QString by chance? If it
is, then you would be probably better off by using QRegExp for the search.
Or instead of doing str(value) that doesn't handle unicode characters
correctly you should use unicode(value). Or if it is a utf-8 encoded string
(or using other encoding) then decode it to a unicode string.

Hi All


Any more thoughts on this? I am about to delete the 'old' svn clone of
qgis on github and replace it with a pruned copy that has all branches
etc and is current to tonight. Personally I dont have a strong opinion
- I'd be happy to just run with github for now and we can always make
an 'official' repo on qgis.org later if needed.

Regards

Tim
