I found out that my `ctest` runs, under QGIS build dir, result
in a directory created under ~/.local/share/ having the same
name as the source python script the run test is coming from.

Hundreds of such directories.

Is this expected or is it a problem with my setup ?

Expected.

But not by design or desired.

Hi all,
I noticed many of us did not yet book for the next Contributor Meeting:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/24th-Contributor-Meeting-in-'s-Hertogenbosch
I assume the uncertainty about the reimbursement procedures might have
had a role. The decision by the PSC was:
* to invite everybody to think before using the more CO2-unfriendly
travel means
* to submit a formal resolution for an environmental policy to the next
Annual General Meeting
* to keep reimbursement procedures unchanged for now.
So please go ahead and book your travel and accommodation.
See you in 's-Hertogenbosch!
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Potential vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <1580582010374-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi,
I am a student of Cybersecurity Master at University of Pisa. My final
project work is about a Security Test of an installation of qgis server +
lizmap web client.
At a first analysis, I found out that lizmap web client is vulnerable to
"Buffer overflow attack"
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_overflow_attack

The problem:
"Potential Buffer Overflow. The script closed the connection and threw a 500
Internal Server Error"
The solution:
"Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking. This
will require a recompile of the background executable."

Here you can view the  report
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s-akDIr9s127kw6MSYKRp1ph29gY_u3/view?usp=sharing> 
:

I also posted this question to Lizmap web client Github: Is Buffer Overflow
vulnerability a false positive for Lizmap web client?

They suggested to ask to this group.
Any help would be very appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Nadia Spitilli

I am working on a python plugin that produces an output to standard out on Mac OS X. When I try and directly run the QGIS unix executable from the terminal (/QGIS3.4/Contents/MacOs/QGIS ), I receive an error:

I can't comment on the security aspect, but at the very least there's a 
bug in the WMS compliance. For the GetCapabilities URL it should be 
returning an XML Service Exception (because it has an invalid SERVICE 
value), not a HTTP 500.

I.e., the same request to a (random) GeoServer box shows the sort of 
thing that should be coming back:

Hi

For clarity the process for requesting travel assistance is to fill out this form *before* you attend / spend money and then await approval from Andreas:

https://goo.gl/forms/YKm5fo7ll5GfQEJI3 <https://goo.gl/forms/YKm5fo7ll5GfQEJI3>

Also be aware that if you claim travel assistance, you are expected to contribute to an event report that will be posted on the blog.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Good news: next Ubuntu version shipping with
	gdal3/proj6
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=p2ZmG4+ZvbsmDP+RTfe153Pu7WrgWaSNVCBTufY4yOww@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a nice Sunday news: Ubuntu 20.04 (ETA end of April) will ship with
gdal 3 (at the moment 3.0.3, hopefully will be 3.0.4 by release day to fix
a nasty bug) and proj 6.3.

This can likely increase the number of QGIS core devs using this next gen
pair of libraries, which would undeniably help take care making us rock
solid there.

I for one will not wait and update now ;)

Ubuntu 20.04 will also ship with the latest sqlite version which features
generated columns, nice little extra.

Hi Jorge,
I don't run QGIS server, I was basing that on the original report by 
Nadia to the list which shows a 500 response for that request to their box.
But yes, testing that URL against some (ostensibly) QGIS servers I can 
find online, it does seem to work as expected. Not sure why Nadia got a 
500 back...
Cheers,
Jonathan

Hi,

thank you for your responses, I can give more detail on this issue.
This is a "sample" *Request*
As you can see, the parameter SERVICE is intentionally big, to test Buffer
overflow issue.

This is the *Response*

I am running QGIS Server 3.10.

The server log for above Request/Response:

16:29:17 INFO Server[13255]: <ServiceExceptionReport
xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ogc" version="1.3.0">
 <ServiceException code="Service configuration error">Service unknown or
unsupported</ServiceException>
</ServiceExceptionReport>



The point is that the Response code is 500, Internal jelix error. It means
that the input is not validated, it is submitted to the server as is.
I would expect something like "Bad parameter", but this is not a matter of
error message.
The point is that this is considered a potential vulnerability against
Buffer overflow attacks. If the input is very large, it could cause the
server to crash. It is considered a programming error.

I would be happy to hear that this is a "false positive", i.e. it is not a
real vulnerability to buffer overflow attack. But I also need to know why.
Otherwise, as a cybersecutity analyst, I have to report that QGIS server has
this "medium alert" vulnerability.

Nadia,

Thanks for investigating QGIS server security. However, I would expect a
vulnerability report to go a bit beyond than just using a generic security
scanner that can have false positives, especially here as all components
involved are open source so it is possible to look at the code, instrument it etc..
So a report should point to the exact line of code where the vulnerability
is triggered and/or provide an exploit.

For the long GET request, this is very very unlikely to be a buffer overflow.

Considering that the following is a valid request:
https://www.cybertest.it/gis/index.php/lizmap/service/?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&project=demogis&repository=demogis

And the same but with just FOO instead of WMS for the value of SERVICE leads to the 500 error:
https://www.cybertest.it/gis/index.php/lizmap/service/?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=FOO&VERSION=1.3.0&project=demogis&repository=demogis

Looking at the error message, a bit of googling shows that it comes from LizMap
source code, not QGIS server:
https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-web-client/blob/master/lib/jelix/core/response/error.en_US.php

Furthermore Jelix is a PHP component, so not native code, hence buffer overflow
vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary code execution aren't relevant here (unless you'd
trigger a vulnerability of the PHP executable itself!)

I haven't look at the other things reported, but they are likely to be
LizMap specific rather than QGIS-server, unless otherwise proven.

Hi Evevn,
thanks for the review. To be fair, original report from Nadia was indeed
against Lizmap.
Cheers.

Hi Even,

thank you so much for answering my questions.

Of course my assessment is far beyond automating scanning for vulnerability.
I just wrote about 1 potential issue. As I said at the beginning, this is
about my Project Work as student of Master of Cybersecurity in Pisa, Italy.
I really appreciate your work and I think qgis server is well designed and
can be successfully used to create a robust architecture from a
cybersecurity perspective.

Before writing to qgis-developer I first submitted the issue to Lizmap
Github group, they suggested to write here, as they think it would be a qgis
issue.
Also for me the issue is likely to be LizMap specific rather than
QGIS-server.
I'll make another attempt with the Lizmap community.

Thank you for your time.
Kind Regards,
Nadia

Hi Nadia,
Just a random thought here, but I wonder if doing this exercise against 
QGIS Desktop would be more worthwhile from a security perspective? There 
are very few deployments of QGIS-Server but many many deployments of 
Desktop.

For example, is it possible to compromise QGIS Desktop via a 
opening/connecting to a compromised shapefile/Geopackage/web-service/CSV 
etc etc? I have no idea, but it'd definitely be a useful thing to 
investigate.
Cheers,
Jonathan

Thanks for the heads-up Tim!

I'm really busy over the next fortnight, so doubt I'll get time to do
the initial git->changelog population (which has been done since QGIS
2.10 or something). Before the entries get populated in depth, we need
a volunteer to trawl through the git changelog from the time of 3.12
branch up to feature freeze and copy all the commits which add
changelog worthy changes to the changelog. It can be just a direct
copy-and-paste, leaving the cleanup for others to do later.

This needs to be done first, so that we can condense similar entries
into one and define the general outline of the changelog **before** we
start adding screenshots and nice text.

Any volunteers?

Hi Jonathan,

this is a good idea and also a good proposal for the students of next
edition of Master in Cybersecurity. 
I will tell to my professor.

Thank you
Nadia

Hi guys!

I want to show a image in a custom form, the image is inside a BLOB field.
I wrote a python function to do that, but when i open the attribute table,
qgis issues a message (inconplete)

[image: image.png]

So, i made this gitlab snippet with a project and the python code.
https://gitlab.com/snippets/1935720
Can someone help?

Hi Kyle,

The best place to post this is on the issue tracker where you'll be able to
paste both the code snippet and the project data.
That keeps everything in a single place and avoid the need for devs to redo
the project.

Many thanks for the report,
Kind regards

Hi all,

Thanks for the report. On this kind of topic, I think it would be wise to
be cautious when writing issues about security. I personally would have
contacted the authors of Lizmap Web Client first before writing an issue on
the public Github repo, with detailed methodology on how to reproduce the
issue. When cross-posting here, I would also have given the link to Lizmap
issue, [1]. This issue has been posted this Saturday evening. I would have
waited for monday morning before raising this issue ;)

Regards
Michaël

Hi Calvin,

You can retrieve the name from the base config object as follows:

auth_mgr = QgsApplication.authManager()
conf_map = auth_mgr.availableAuthMethodConfigs()
for id, conf in conf_map.iteritems():
    conf_name = conf.name()
    print conf_name

I hope this helps.

Cheers,

John

I respectfully disagree here: qgis server is widespread, and the
security implications of a web app are generally higher than for a
desktop app.
So thanks Nadia!

gdal (3.0.4+dfsg-1) is still in the proposed pocket, so it is not
included in focal yet, see:

 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdal

The update excuses show a regression in the autopkgtest for postgis
which is a blocker for migration out of the proposed pocket, it is also
too young (< 5 days), see:

 https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/focal/update_excuses.html#gdal

Bas

Bas,

Thanks for the update, and big thanks for the efforts you've put into this
over the years.

I've updated my system too, no big regression, nice to live in the future
:)

For file formats, part of the security/insecurity would fall on GDAL (and 
underlying libraries). GDAL has been integrated with oss-fuzz [1] since 3 
years and we have fixed a big number of issues raised by it (not all strictly 
security related).

That said, that doesn't test the pure QGIS side of things, since there could 
be issues in QGIS provider code, or in non-GDAL code paths (text delimited 
provider, web service providers). One technical issue with oss-fuzz is that it 
requires statically linked binaries, due to constraints how they deploy the 
binaries in their stress-testing cloud.

An alternative would be to use AFL ([2]) (which is one of the backends used by 
oss-fuzz), which doesn't have this statically linked binary requirement.

On the client side, testing the security of web service providers would be 
pretty challenging since you'd have to simulate potentially hostile servers 
and look at how the client reacts to those hostile responses.

For the server side, you could imagine having a ossfuzz/afl integration where 
what would be fuzzed would be the request sent to the server.

John,

Thanks for that hint. Here is what I finally used.

auth_mgr = QgsApplication.authManager()
conf_map = auth_mgr.availableAuthMethodConfigs()
for key in conf_map.keys():
    name = conf_map[key].name()
    print( key )
    print( name )

So that gives me both the authentication id and its name. Thanks so much.

Calvin

Message-ID: <CA+f=8=qfJwGEhFo-aZHtJN+xXUMAciyXz48J28CFO30ygzzMjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

  While reading QGIS Server logs I wonder if this has some idea or is an error.

  After QGIS Server starts running ok I assume it is normal to change
QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL to 1 - do not show INFO type messages which
quickly go into hundreds of megs of text on a busy server.
  But if I understand correctly, some messages go into incorrect
levels thus both adding unnecessary info messages as well as hiding
important info.

  For example:
  1. Excessive warning level messages include:
  * formatString is: image/png (server/qgsrequesthandler.cpp)
  * Adding service SampleService 1.0, WCS 1.0.0 etc. etc.
(servce/qgsserviceregistry.cpp)

  2. Missing important info message:
  * <ServiceExceptionError ...>The layer 'ABC' does not
exist.</ServiceException> (services/wms/qgswmsserviceexception.h)

  Am I missing something?

  Thank you

Hi,

Yes, there is some log messages that are not output with the correct log 
level, should be fixed in near future.

Is it enough to just grab the items labelled ‘Feature’ - we are planning to automatically create entries from the changelog as part of the QGIS funded improvements we are doing

https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1128 <https://github.com/kartoza/prj.app/issues/1128>

But I was planning to set it up from after 3.12 goes out. @Anita Hapsari can you whip up something to pull all the entries out for us from over the 3.12 development period?

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <513f0829-8fb7-3799-d102-323c03809791@gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

I would like to know how to get the default QgsPalLayerSettings values 
for a point, line or polygon layer.
Is a method exist ?
Is it defined in some comments ?

It is for fixing my PR Read SLD TextSymbolizer for lines

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to notify an error from
	QgsProcessingAlgorithm.processAlgorithm ?
Message-ID: <CAKXEUWOZMLzVt2tLezA8741sP9KECeEwnF6QuLWKAC4bz7mqBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I'm trying to implement a processing algorithm in Python.

It's not clear how I am supposed to handle errors during the execution of
the algorithms. The documentation is talking about raising the exception
GeoAlgorithmExecutionException
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.8/core/QgsProcessingAlgorithm.html#qgis.core.QgsProcessingAlgorithm.processAlgorithm

unfortunately this exception doesn't exist. I've tried to raise
QgsProcessingException. But from the output window, the exception does not
seem to be well handled. I also tried to return an empty dictionary and
then the output window doesn't seem to notify any problem at all. I've
checked out GDAL and GRASS processing plugins but they seem handle errors
differently in a very specific way. GDAL raise an IOError and GRASS report
error with: feedback.reportError

So what is the right way to handle an error in processAlgorithm ?

It's important for me as I want to be able to create new models with the
algorithms from the graphical modeler. So if something goes wrong in the
middle of a set of algorithms, it definitely need to be reported correctly.

Thanks for your help,

Jean-Charles

This is, I think, the way to go. What do you mean by not well handled? You
mean the display with the traceback? This has been fixed in latest QGIS
versions. Maybe not in QGIS 3.8 which is not maintained anymore.

You should open the script template provided in QGIS Desktop :
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/script/ScriptTemplate.py#L136

Ouch, outdated dox. This should say "QgsProcessingException". I'll fix.

> unfortunately this exception doesn't exist. I've tried to raise QgsProcessingException. But from the output window, the exception does not seem to be well handled. I also tried to return an empty dictionary and then the output window doesn't seem to notify any problem at all. I've checked out GDAL and GRASS processing plugins but they seem handle errors differently in a very specific way. GDAL raise an IOError and GRASS report error with: feedback.reportError

It depends on the severity of the error.
- If it's a critical error, raise QgsProcessingException. This will
completely terminate the algorithm execution, **AND TERMINATE ANY
MODEL IT IS RUNNING AS PART OF**. Be wary of raising exceptions --
don't raise them for things like "found no features in layer", because
that's potentially a situation which may arise when running an
algorithm in a model, and by raising the exception you effectively
prevent users from utilising your algorithm in their model. So you
only raise exceptions when things are definitely wrong, say for
something like "selected grouping field 'CATEGORY' does not exist in
input layer".

- Otherwise, use reportError. This doesn't terminate your algorithm
(or its parent model), but shows a warning error in the log so that
users know something unexpected happened (e.g. "found no features in
layer").

In my experience... no. Some of us naughty developers don't always use
this tag :(

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] SIP 5?
Message-ID: <1E1019B4-2B2C-41F4-833F-951E1AEA4E3A@kyngchaos.com>

I just ran into a configuration problem with SIP 5 (updating my system).  cmake is failing to find PyQt5 with SIP 5 - it can't import sipconfig.

Looking at FindPyQt5.py, I see that it first tries importing PyQt5.pyqtconfig.  This doesn't appear to be a normal part of Pyqt5.  The only pyqtconfig module I found hasn't been updated in 4 years, and when I tried putting it inside PyQt5, I got an error that PyQt5.pyqyconfig has no attribute Configuration, so I presume it's a completely different pyqyconfig than QGIS wants.

When pyqtconfig fails (not found or error), it tries importing sipconfig.  Right there in the code a comment says this won't work for SIP 5, and indeed it fails, because sip 5 does not include sipconfig.

So, catch 22.  Does QGIS support SIP 5?  Install doc says >= 4.12, nothing about < 5.

Now about we add a ‘Changelog’ tag that we can just go and add to each PR (either at the time of making it or retrosopectively) and we can just go through the PR queue and scan for those? Other options I guess is to strongly encourage people to use a relevant tag when they submit their PR.

Definitely. Like you've pointed out, it could be done retrospectively,
and added also by others.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unit tests: compare images is failing in my local
	setup
Message-ID: <1743fc76-5126-98b5-bc8a-de1c503e14ec@di.uminho.pt>

Hi devs,

In my local development setup (Ubuntu 18.04, Qt 5.11.1), my unit tests
are failing when comparing images. (I'm running these tests on master,
to make sure everything is ok. The tests are working properly on CI.)

The images are equal (according to imagemagick compare), when compared
manually:

compare -verbose -metric AE

2) The error is due to the fact that the images have different sizes on

The images are available at: http://webgis.di.uminho.pt/~jgr/QGIS/images.zip

In fact, the images have different sizes on the file system. I don't
know why.

What are the guidelines for using [feature] in the future? I think it 
acted as a combination of [needs docs], [changelog] and [look, this is 
cool] in the past. If the first two are about to be solved by more 
precise labels, do we keep it for the third one or are there other 
compelling reasons?

For me, I don’t have any strong opinions - I think we will build the harvester to take a user-defined list of tags that should be harvested, so that we can deal with things flexibly. Basically just looking for advice on which tags I should use and then we will set it up to use those.

Thanks,

Tim

Hi Andreas,

This driver implements support for access to spatial tables in Microsoft
SQL Server 2008+ which contains the geometry and geography data types to
represent the geometry columns.

Pedro,
QGIS provider uses QtSql (namely QODBC) to access MSSQL, so your link
is not relevant in this case.

Andreas,
not 100% sure, but you should be able to use any MSSQL version, just
need to install proper ODBC drivers
for it. On *nix systems, you will need a FreeTDS driver.

I have had a number of people want MGRS zoom to and capture tools that
provide separate icons and windows from the Lat Lon Tools plugin. My
choices where to either add these additional features to Lat Lon Tools or
else to create a separate MGRS Tools plugin. I decided to create a separate
plugin for those who need it.

Here is the plugin: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mgrs/

I would suggest to make the test tolerant to difference in file size,
and only rely on pixel equality (which you say you obtain).

The inability to successfully run QGIS tests locally is a stress point
for me as well. I think it should be improved as much as possible to
make contributing to the project a pleasure.

Hi all,

It sounds that going through pull requests rather than the commits make
sense.

For now, I have created a small -- not anymore ;) -- script that will
output corresponding pull requests as JSON with title, HTML body and author.
Working for this series, the script returns all PRs having [FEATURE] in one
of their commit message or in the PR title, within the corresponding dates
and targeting master
script: https://gist.github.com/3nids/0cf399297888ea8ebd0e64169c9fbbc2
output (changelog):
https://gist.github.com/3nids/4f6e948a94526515391899a5701cce47

That should be easy to feed the changelog with this.

Probably for the future, it would be interesting to create a Changelog
label?

Best wishes,

Denis

Thanks Denis

Yes agreed, working against PR’s is better. I forwarded your script links below on to Dimas and Anita who are working their magic to pull the content over to the changelog.

Hi J. Gustavo,
it seems WMS_GetPrint_TwoMaps_result.png contains some PNG tEXt chunks not

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Setting layer properties abstract with pyqgis
Message-ID: <dcd5c344-765a-a8b5-8c8f-bf11765f5457@nsidc.org>

Hello,

I have a py-qgis question that someone here may be able to help me with.

We are building a QGIS data package programmatically using pyqgis. One 
of our goals is to include various metadata for the layers we are adding 
to this package, so that when a user opens a layer's properties menu, 
they can see things like the abstract, citation information, etc.

In QGIS, using the GUI, we can add an abstract directly into the 
'Abstract' field in the metadata tab (layer properties popup), and then 
save the project to write that information out to the project file. This 
gets placed in the `abstract` tag under the `resourceMetadata` tag 
associated with the layer in question. My question is: how do we 
programmatically add this abstract information to the project file using 
pyqgis?

There is a `setAbstract` method on QgsMapLayer objects that is used to 
change the on-hover popup text when moving the cursor over the given 
layer in the table of contents, but this does not set the 'metadata' 
abstract in the layer properties popup.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Trey Stafford

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Shapefile encoding frustrations -- a potential
	solution
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgSQymX+e08A0XUznBONZ+niusQzH0XO3TuKiSZ+BRA8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

There's been quite a lot of discussion in the past on these lists
where users have expressed frustration at the confusing/broken
encoding handling of Shapefiles in QGIS.

I've just submitted a potential fix for all of these, and I'd welcome
comment from any users who have been impacted by this in the past:

Good day to all

I wish to record my overwhelming gratitude to this software project as I 
have been a user of this software QGIS over the past 8 years since 
version 1.8. During that period I have been working on developing 
historical hobby maps covering a large part of the country of New 
Zealand and making extensive use of freely downloadable map resources 
which are available there.

I have just completed the first volume of a series, containing just over 
1000 individual maps which are published online for free access. Each of 
those maps has to be individually generated and checked from the layout 
composer. There are still another 11 volumes of a similar size to be 
produced in the series which should take roughly 11 months (for the rest 
of this year).

None of this could have been achieved without the use of the Qgis 
software and I must especially record my appreciation that it is free 
software as this project could not have happened at all a few years ago 
considering the large volume of resources involved and the expense all 
round that would have been incurred given the commercial value of all 
the resources (my personal income at present being less than NZ$20,000 pa).

It has been of considerable personal regret to me that a certain level 
of conflict did arise during the period that I was using the 2.99 
development edition of the software and I hope it will be possible for 
developers to accept this apology for those situations. Unfortunately I 
do not have the time these days to run the development edition for 
testing and have yet to master the new bug reporting system so you have 
not heard from me in a while anyways.

Hey Patrick,

Thanks for the kind words.  Great to see you are able to use it make
something worthwhile for yourself and others to enjoy.    Do you have a
link to the maps so we can share them out?

I'm not sure what conflicts you refer to but I am assuming it was with good
intentions and maybe out of some frustration which we can all run up again
at times.

Regards,
Nathan

Are you sure this is working? There's definitely items missing from
this, e..g. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33165

See https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/349531/qgis-zonal-statistics-and-no-data/349559

It seems that raster calculator turns the lowest pixel row of the image that covers the whole world in EPSG:4326 into nodata with value -3.4e+38 which gives troubles afterwards. The original image does not have nodata at all and all pixels in the lowest row have value 0.

Hi Patrick


So great to hear about your successful project! Please share a link to your work and even consider writing up a case study for our web site:

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/case_studies/index.html <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/case_studies/index.html>

We always love seeing how people put QGIS to use in the real world.

As for conflict, well none of us seem to remember it and I like to think that we have long memories for happy times in the project and short memories for less than perfect times :-) 

Best regards

Tim

Hi all,
PostgreSQL 12 has the option of a GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED column.
QGIS is able to load the table, but apparently it is not possible to
insert new records. Does anyone confirm that this is not a local problem?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,
nice feature, thanks for the heads up !

I confirm the behavior here.

The documentation advises to use the `DEFAULT` keyword into the INSERT
command.
Here is what I get with a QGIS-like insert :

 INSERT INTO
"data"."pipe"("geometry","id","label_1_text","_length2d","_length3d")
VALUES (st_geomfromtext('LINESTRINGZ(1 1 1, 2 2 2)',3946),1 ,'test',0,  0);
ERREUR:  42601: ne peut pas insérer dans la colonne « _length2d »
DÉTAIL : Column "_length2d" is a generated column.
EMPLACEMENT : rewriteTargetListIU, rewriteHandler.c : 827

With the keyword 'DEFAULT', it works

INSERT INTO
"data"."pipe"("geometry","id","label_1_text","_length2d","_length3d")
VALUES (st_geomfromtext('LINESTRINGZ(1 1 1, 2 2 2)',3946),2
,'test',DEFAULT, DEFAULT);

And with no data supplied for the generated columns, it also works

We indeed have to upgrade the postgresql provider to check this particular
column type to handle INSERT and UPDATE accordingly.

Regards

Régis

Oh, I see my master is old. I thought I recompiled it last week. I'll check
again. Let's compile.

Message-ID: <CAFWkJcE2J6d3jR70Swd5oiXiCxU6z6VAv=16HLGxvnmCKcqn6g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Qgis people,

I am trying to convert a script from PyQGIS 2 to PyQGIS 3

In the original script, the author used
processing.runalgorithm("saga:triangulation", parameters). Now, I am trying
to use it as same as possible with PyQGIS3 but I am not finding anything
similar:

   1. I am using processing.run instead of processing.runalgorithm
   2. I am aware that there is no SAGA API for Python 3
   3.  The objective of the code is change as less as possible. That's why
   I am not looking for other solutions (except if you tell me there is no
   similar solution, of course)

Maybe someone knows what can I do in this case?



Thank you all in advance for your time reading my problems!

check which parameters have been specified: it might be a different
number of them between QGIS2 and QGIS3.

Type processing.algorithmHelp('saga:triangulation') to see the list and
type of each single parameter.

A complete guide of how to use algorithm from the console is n the user
manual:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing/console.html

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,
generally here. If you think it is a grave vulnerability you can send it
privately to any PSC member or major QGIS developer (you can check on
GitHub for recent activity).
Thanks!

HHhi all,
thanks Alessandro for fixing it. Any hope to backport it to 3.4? This
raises again the issue of long term releases, and their interaction with
upgrades of related sw.
Cheers.

Dear Matteo,

Thank you for your answer.

I using this code to check all the processing available with PyQGIS3

> for i in QgsApplication.processingRegistry().algorithms():
>     print("{}:{} --> {}".format(i.provider().name(), i.name(),
> i.displayName()))


In the result there is no "saga:triangulation".

Also, I already try algorithmHelp('saga:triangulation')

[image: image.png]

There is no result.

That is the reason why I am writing here. I search for several days and I
do not find anything, also in StackOverflow and StackEchange.


Thank you in advance!

I get this:

>>> processing.algorithmHelp('saga:triangulation')
Triangulation (saga:triangulation)


----------------
Input parameters
----------------

SHAPES: Points

	Parameter type:	QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource

	Accepted data types:
		- str: layer ID
		- str: layer name
		- str: layer source
		- QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition
		- QgsProperty
		- QgsVectorLayer

.........

if you search for triangulation in the Processing toolbox do you find
the algorithm of SAGA?

Cheers

Matteo

Sounds like a treasure hunt. How about writing a few words on
https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/bugreporting.html ?
Maybe also defining an email alias @qgis.org to receive those
reports..

Nope, 3.4 is EOL

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS-3.10 configuration import did not import
	PostgreSQL connections
Message-ID: <20200212081344.GA16451@liz>

Apparently I started QGIS 3.10 for the first time since some
popup was added. The popup asked if I wanted to "start fresh"
or "import settings from QGIS 2". I opted for settings import.

After import, none of my PostgreSQL connections are found.
Is this expected or a bug ?

Hi,

In the Geoserver project we have a dedicated, closed, moderated and not
archived mailing list for reporting vulnerabilities
https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geoserver-security.

We advice users to use just that mailing list in user documentation
http://geoserver.org/comm/ and in the issue tracker
https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/projects/GEOS/summary

PSC members are all members on the list and also moderators. Only mails
which are accepted by a moderator are sent to recipients. About 80 percent
of mails are either spam or unknown people are trying to get accepted to the
security list and moderator just deletes those mails. The rest 20% has been
good stuff and in many cases absolutely something that we do not want to see
on the open mailing lists or in the issue tracker.

Hello,

before, in pyqgis 2, we could use:

self.iface.legendInterface().setGroupExpanded(nrgroup, True or False)

and, now, in pyqgis 3?

Thank you in advance :-)

of course, this bypasses the request from Andreas of extending the life
of 3.4 of another year.

I installed QGIS-dev rev. 58f1206748 that seems to contain latest commit from
three days ago. Also this version writes out a GeoTIFF that has the
southmost row of pixels set to nodata.

FYI: I've just created an email(group) address for this:

security at qgis.org

Emails to that address will be forwarded to PSC members and members of
admin-group.

If individuals/core-members want to be added, please let me know so I
can add you to that group.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi

In reply to your comments

There are a few different questions but Gimp wouldn't be able to write 
its temp file into the swap area because only the operating ssystem 
itself would be able to access that. Gimp has the ability to use virtual 
memory and a separate temporary area. If you configure a tile cache and 
it runs out of physical RAM then the tile cache is pushed into swap 
exactly as one would have thought.

Cheers

Please file a ticket, then add the following information:

- attach offending raster
- attach formula
- check if enabling/disabling OpenCL acceleration makes any difference.

Thanks Richard,

I'm interested as well in being added.

Will all people in the group be added as CC? It would be good if someone 
asks a question back everyone else gets a notification as well (to avoid 
asking the same question many times - or nobody reacting at all because 
everyone assumes someone else has taken action already).

Bests

Matthias

Ok, added
It's a Google mail group, not sure how to set such stuff...
IF the mailer cc's to security at qgis.org everybody sees that, else..
don't think so.

Hi Dev's may I draw you attention to:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/34414
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/34169

which make it (at least on Linux and Windows) impossible to browse '/'
or 'c:\' or 'd:\' in the browser panel.

Would not be cool to release 3.12/3.10LTR which such an issue :-(

I had a short look into it (see my comment in #34414 but am unsure on
how to proceed...)

Richard Duivenvoorde

The people who actually use Ubuntu and want to have GDAL 3 in the next
LTS, you should work with the Ubuntu people to get gdal (3.0.4+dfsg-1)
out of the proposed pocket before the Feature Freeze on February 27th.
[0] Otherwise focal will likely ship with gdal (2.4.3+dfsg-1).

In Debian we had an issue with openscenegraph picking up the newer coin3
which complicated migration to testing, but that was resolved by a
Release Team member [1]. Something similiar may be a blocker in Ubuntu.
Getting in touch with their Release Team is good start. [2]

Maybe others are better than me in remembering such workflows, but I 
will forget that for sure.

What would be involved to setup the infrastructure as proposed by Jukka?

Which 'workflow'?

- somebody finds an issue, and sents an email to security at qgis.org
- everybody in the mail group sees this and can respond (cc to
security at qgis.org)
- somebody picks this up

No other services needed?

Richard

This part of the workflow requires me to realize that this came in 
through an alias and was not directly addressed to me and to remember to 
add the CC to security at qgis.org (an address which I have to remember or 
find at this point in time).

But if I'm the only one who is too scattered for this, let's ignore it :)

Actual question: "Why are selected features not always painted on top"?

Question to dev's: is the 'control feature rendering' heavy in resources?

Else: would it be possible to always render the selection on top, in the
same way as shown below?

Is it worth a feature request? Or does it slow down painting to much?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hello,

I've tried to email security at qgis.org but got an error message: "We're

Hi all,
I have a couople of WMS layers that are displayed correclty in QGIS
desktop, but disappear in the server. It may be due to an erro on the
WMS side, which in fact returns:
mapserv(): Web application error. Traditional BROWSE mode requires a
TEMPLATE in the WEB section, but none was provided.
What is strange to me is having a different behavious from desktop to
sever. Any hint? Is this expected?
Cheers.

Hi Paolo,

It would be good to get the exact request that your server is sending to 
MapServer, to debug this. (maybe using Fiddler, as described in the 
steps I've recorded at 
https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki/Get-the-Raw-WMS-Request-Generated-by-QGIS 
)

Also, it might also be good to check the WMS server's GetCapabilities 
request, to make sure that there are no 'WARNING' messages in the 
response.  (example request: 
https://demo.gatewaygeomatics.com/cgi-bin/wms_gateway?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities 
)

@Jeff: my I plug this plugin:
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgisnetworklogger/
to view wfs/wms requests from within QGIS Desktop? You can see all
requests en response info, AND replay in browser or curl

@Paolo: the error you see is when Minnesota mapserver is not receiving
the full url (including the &map=mymapfile. So looks to me like QGIS
server is handling the server-url different then QGIS desktop.
I would try to connect to a local mapserver and log the apache requests
there?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Excellent, thanks for 'plugging' your cool plugin!

Indeed, adding
?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
returns valid results.
curl from the same server downloads a valid image.
Unclear therefore why the layers are shown in desktop and not in the
server. Could it be that they do not allow wms cascading?
I worked around this by taking data directly from wms, without passing
from qgis server, but it would be nice to understand this behaviour.
Thanks Richard for the plugin, very useful.
Cheers.

Paolo does the same issue occur when you leverage my server instead, 
inside your application? If so I can check my Apache logs when you hit 
it, to see what request your application is sending to MapServer.

Hi Jeff,
I regularly use WMS services, and this is the first time I hit this
different behaviour between server and desktop, so I think this is
related to that specific server.
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS - Processing slow to load output layers
Message-ID: <bb832b8b-8167-a8b4-d18f-7c7ddb4ccbbb@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm experiencing some weird behavior of Processing (3.10 and master).

No matter if the output is a raster or vector, if the runtime of the
algorithm is long (say > 10 seconds) and the output is defined as a
temporary layer there are 2 strange things:

1. loading the output layer is extremely slow, way slower than the
runtime of the algorithm itself. And it doesn't matter if the output
layer is very heavy of very light

2. this happens mostly with raster files: even if the CRS of the input
layer is correctly defined and correctly read by QGIS, when the output
is loaded the CRS dialog appears and prompt for the CRS

Both issues don't happen if the layer is saved as a file and the
checkbox of "Open output file after running algorithm" in unchecked.

Somebody can confirm this?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

Hello,

I hope I write to the correct address with my request.

In the "Kantonsverwaltung Zug" we use QGIS since version 2.16 in the department of geoinformation. We always used the following command to start QGIS:

"C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_8_ZANZIBAR\bin\nircmd.exe" exec hide C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_8_ZANZIBAR\bin\qgis.bat
(Yes, we install it in a custom named folder)

It always worked out fine and QGIS started without any issues. However, in version 3.10.2 this does not work out, because the file qgis.bat does not exist. I found the file "C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_10_2_Coruna\bin\qgis-bin.exe" and tried to start it.
Unfortunately I get an error message (see attachment). If I start the file "C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_10_2_Coruna\bin\qgis-bin-g7.exe" I get the same behaviour. I think it's a little bit odd that the mentioned file "C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_10_2_Coruna\bin\qgis-bin.env" doesn't even exist in the file system...

Can you help me out with this issue? Or is there a way you would recommend to correctly start QGIS?

We use Windows 10 Build 1809 with the newest windows updates.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Point cloud tests disabled
Message-ID: <6d295cc8-0e95-c821-fec8-260afe0b9714@opengis.ch>

Hi,

The recently added point cloud tests had to be reverted today as they 
suddenly started to fail and flagged every pull request as broken.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34474


Here is a reference to a failing build

https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/650344373#L997-L998


It looks like the pointcloud module fails to build, probably because of 
an update of postgres in the underlying docker image (?). If someone 
knows how to fix these tests, that would be appreciated!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New plugin NumericalDigitize3 and core
	functionality of QGIS
Message-ID: <533a84f2-38e0-f25c-2a6a-7e078476c08b@inbox.ru>

Hello.

I’m developing general purpose plugin for QGIS 3.4+ , which is 
refactored well known plugins Numerical Digitize and Vertex Editor for 
QGIS 2.X.

The following functionality is currently implemented:
1. You can create new feature by entering coordinates of vertices from 
keyboard or clipboard (you can copy table data, contained coordinates, 
from tables of text documents, electronic spreadsheet, OCR programs or 
other programs and then paste it into table of plugin dialog for create 
feature).
2. In process of creating feature you can adding and removing parts for 
multipart features and rings for polygons.
3. You can add and remove rows in table of coordinates of plugin dialog 
for remove vertices or insert new vertices in any part of feature.
4. You can swap values of X and Y coordinates (It’s need sometimes for 
some projections).
5. You can reproject coordinates in place from one CRS to other CRS. 
(It’s may be useful when feature is created in incorrect projection).
6. You can edit existing feature same as creating feature. It’s 
replacement of  ‘Vertex Editor’,  but you can edit not one vertex, but 
all vertices of feature. Functionality specified in points 2 - 5 is 
implemented for editing existing feature. You can copy coordinates of 
vertices (all or some) into clipboard and then insert it as table into 
text document, electronic spreadsheet or other place for creating 
reports with coordinates of object or for other purposes.

In addition:
1. Plugin supports vector layers with Z and M values.
2. When creating or editing feature changes are displayed on canvas 
(used QgsRubberBand).

And now my questions:
1. Since it is a general purpose plugin, some stated above functionality 
may be released  in core interface of QGIS, but not in plugin. Is 
planned to include some functionality stated above in feature releases 
of QGIS?  If I continue to support and develop plugin, I don't want to 
do double work.
2. It makes sense to place plugin into QGIS 3.4 plugin repository?

If you want to see how plugin works, you can download it from 
https://github.com/desertwolf7/numericalDigitize3/releases and install 
plugin as zip archive.
Help is situated in 'Main menu' -> 'Vector' -> 'Numerical digitize' ->

I'm finally catching up on my Mac packaging.  I noticed a new QgsQuick plugin/library for qml in Qgis 3.10.

Does QGIS need any other qml components from Qt?  I need to know what, if anything, needs to be bundled in the QGIS app package for QgsQuick.

Hi Martin -

I don't know how you have installed QGIS. Probably a simple xcopy. 
However, the error message states:

"Look in /path_to_directory_for_QGIS_binary/\qgis-bin.env for correct paths"

This file - qgis-bin.env - has to be present in the same directory as 
qgis-bin.exe - contains a lot of setup information previously contained 
in qgis.bat.

And it has to be configured corecctly. It's a text file, so you can edit 
the file with a simple text editor like notepad.

A small sample from my own .env file (where qgis-bin.exe is located in 
c:\ocgeo4win64\bin:

/PATH=C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\qgis\bin;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python37;C:\OSGEO4~1\apps\Python37\Scripts//... 
blah blah
/

/C:\OSGEO4~1\ /is the "DOS old-style 8.3" name for /C:\OSGeo4W64\
/
//
All these path names in the .env file has to be configured correctly 
regarding your home-path for QGIS

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Returning whether feature is rendered (feature
	visibility) using pyqgis
Message-ID: <CA+AM-1o67PCfBDWRLnwL1mTYaVw7_PLan7f4AzAeGLeV8rNLMA@mail.gmail.com>

  Hi all,

I am having trouble working out how to use the willRenderFeature() method
of QgsFeatureRenderer classes. There have been a couple of questions
related to this on gis,stackexchange.com recently, and I thought I would
try to find an answer- but I've hit a dead end!
The latest documentation contains a snippet specifically around dealing
only with visible features:
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureRenderer.html#a981b574dd6813bcc3cd849822af8929b


◆
<https://qgis.org/api/classQgsFeatureRenderer.html#a981b574dd6813bcc3cd849822af8929b>
capabilities()
virtual QgsFeatureRenderer::Capabilities QgsFeatureRenderer::capabilities (
) inlinevirtual

Returns details about internals of this renderer.

E.g. if you only want to deal with visible features:
if not renderer.capabilities().testFlag(QgsFeatureRenderer.Filter) or
renderer.willRenderFeature(feature, context):
deal_with_my_feature()
else:
skip_the_curren_feature()

Reimplemented in QgsRuleBasedRenderer

<https://qgis.org/api/qgsrenderer_8h_source.html#l00274> of file
qgsrenderer.h <https://qgis.org/api/qgsrenderer_8h_source.html>.
But I cannot work out how to implement this logic.
E.g. I have a vector layer which is symbolized with a
QgsCategorizedSymbolRenderer and I would like to exclude features belonging
to categories which are unchecked in the TOC from, for example, an
intersection test against a QgsRectangle. If I run the following in the
Python console, QGIS crashes when passing a QgsRenderContext object as the
second argument of the renderer.willRenderFeature() method.
Firstly passing an empty instance:

layer = iface.activeLayer()
feat = layer.getFeature(3)
renderer = layer.renderer()
test = renderer.willRenderFeature(feat, QgsRenderContext())
# LINE BELOW CRASHES QGIS
test = renderer.willRenderFeature(feat, QgsRenderContext())

And secondly, I tried constructing a QgsRenderContext object with the
fromMapSettings() method and passing the canvas.mapSettings() to its
constructor:

layer = iface.activeLayer()
feat = layer.getFeature(3)
renderer = layer.renderer()
settings = iface.mapCanvas().mapSettings()
context = QgsRenderContext().fromMapSettings(settings)
# LINE BELOW CRASHES QGIS
test = renderer.willRenderFeature(feat, context)

I'm sure I am doing something wrong because I don't have a thorough
understanding of how to properly construct or use this context object.

Incidentally, if I run the following line:

renderer.capabilities().testFlag(QgsFeatureRenderer.Filter)

I get an attribute error that Capabilities object has no attribute
'testFlag'

So at this point I'm a bit stumped. Any help or guidance would be greatly
appreciated.

Best regards,

Ben

definitely yes. pleaase note however that the preferred option would be
not to duplicate the plugin, but to add a new version to the same repo.

Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade our QGIS deployment from 3.4.7 to 3.4.15 and I'm now getting the following error:
from pyproj import _datadir
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\programs\QGIS_3\apps\Python37\lib\code.py", line 90, in runcode

    mod = _builtin_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

I accept that this error is being caused by the stack trace of my own plugin but I'm a bit stuck for ideas now. My plugin is importing the WFS libraries from OWSLib and that is then issuing the statement above which then fails.

Has anyone else encountered this issue and if so are there any suggestions on how to fix the issue or alternatively which support group to email about it (I know it might be the OWSLib project)?

So far I've re-installed it multiple times with differing libraries selected in the OWS installer and I've tried https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads which I found referenced somewhere.

I don't seem to be getting the issue on my 32 bit installation but then for course it was a separate install download so I'm not 100% certain why that one works and this one doesn't.

Any help or pointers would be apricated,

Hi,

In the attribute form it's possible to add a QML widget. This pretty 
much opens up all the fancy QML things in QGIS, so every QML module 
which is installed can be used.

See the original blog post 
https://www.opengis.ch/2018/11/06/qml-widgets-qgis/

or video 4 of episode 4 of qgis on the road for an animated version 
https://www.opengis.ch/2019/12/12/qgis-on-the-road-episode-4/

I'd at least include the charts module to be able to include those.

I don't think the QgsQuick module is required (or even accessible) from 
standalone QGIS.

Hi Martin,

did you use the standalone installer or the OSGEO4W-Installer?

You can have a look if in your C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_10_2_Coruna\bin
folder if there exists a qgis.bat.tmpl file as template for the qgis.bat.

If so you can copy the file and rename it to qgis.bat. If not you can
create a qgis.bat with a content similar to this:
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thbaumann/1550ba276b5c17f36edf9f91379dd81d/raw/795a657d10dcc9189f1d9331cec35382a2815db2/qgis.bat_template
(this bat file content is one for an OSGEO4W-Installation)

Afterwards you can open your cmd commandline("Eingabeaufforderung"),
navigate to C:\Program Files\QGIS_3_10_2_Coruna\bin and call "qgis.bat
--postinstall" to create the env file.

regards,
Thomas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] startup.py not working outside %APPDATA%\QGIS\QGIS3
Message-ID: <CAD3koGnqVTtpEEeT7mkcGmZjQ+WjcwZqnO55VOOwNBdeY-xcqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS-devs,
It looks like QGIS3 (tested with 3.10.2) does not make use of a startup.py
if it is saved outside
%APPDATA%\QGIS\QGIS3 (OS: Windows 10).

I opened QGIS with a custom "--profiles-path"  which works fine as QGIS
creates this profiles folder. But if you put a startup.py into this folder
(for example %APPDATA%\QGIS\qgis3_tests) it is not executed.

Only the startup.py saved in %APPDATA%\QGIS\QGIS3 is executed.

I guess this is a bug, isn't it?

Otherwise it would be not possible to have different startup.py files for
different profile folders (testing/production).

regards,
Thomas

It's an Let's Encrypt certificate, but autorenewal can fail due to load 
on their side. I see this for my certs quite frequently.

Also ensure that certbot or another ACME client you use it updated to be 
still supported by LE, e.g. TLS-SNI-01 is no longer supported for which 
the certbot got a stable update in Debian.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,

Many thanks for the update.
Is this correct that it has now been upgraded to 3.0.4?

Yes, see: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdal

The package is now in "release (universe)" instead of "proposed

Nice, Ubuntu 20.04 (LTR) shipping with gdal 3.0.4 and proj 6.3.1 is really
sweet.

Any plan to update QGIS to 3.10? 3.4 reaches it's end of life in the coming
few days.

Yes, but this will probably be too late for focal, as recently discussed 
on the Debian GIS list:

  https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis/2020/01/msg00000.html

QGIS 3.10.3 (the first 3.10 in the Long-Term Repo which the package in 
Debian tracks) is (now) scheduled for release on the 21st and the Debian 
import freeze for focal is on the 27th. I may not be able to get QGIS 
3.10 into Debian unstable (from which Ubuntu syncs by default) before 
the import freeze, e.g. if it takes more than a few days for the FTP 
masters to review the package in the NEW queue. Another possibility is 
that the build fails on certain architectures which will prevent the 
package in Ubuntu from moving out of the proposed pocket. The 3.10.3 
release was scheduled on the 27th before, as mentioned on the debian-gis 
list, that would have made it pretty much impossible to get it into 
focal.

Because there is no one that actively maintains the geospatial packages 
in Ubuntu, QGIS and JOSM users should use the packages provided from 
their upstream repos instead which are actively updated with new 
releases.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Windows Touch Screen QGIS 3
Message-ID: <000001d5e653$065d0090$131701b0$@gmail.com>

Hi,

 

I´m using QGIS 3.10 in a Lenovo Thinkpad with Windows 10 and  touch screen.
Since QGIS 3, the touch map button, that was very useful, has dissapear.

 

I´ve read that is because, since Qt5, touch screen is automatically
detected, and the normal pan button works like the old touch one .

 

But I can´t drag with 2 fingers to zoom in / out for example like the old
one, only panning a with two tap in the screen make a zoom in (I don´t know
how to do a zoom out).

 

It´s that normal? It´s working correctly the touch screen detection?  Could
I have the old button?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Santiago Soto.

Hi devs,

 

How can I get the interpolated Z value (as shown in the picture below) of a
layer (PolygonZ) for a clicked or existent point with PyQgis?

 



 

I already know how to do it with a raster layer (sample raster), like code
below:

 

rastSample = Raster.dataProvider().identify(point,
QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results()

 

Anyone can help me?

 

Thank you,

 

Jorge Almerio

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.12 -- please stick to stable proj 6
	releases!
Message-ID: <CAB28AshO2Y4Q8yVj=Y=d08NWW3_LicZBYLxtPusLspPs57S7JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list (especially Jürgen),

Can we please ensure that the upcoming QGIS 3.12 and 3.10.3 releases
use the stable PROJ 6.3.1 release, and not the 7.0 release (that's
assuming that the final proj 7.0 release is out before the QGIS
releases).

https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/issues/1942 is a serious regression for
QGIS users, and we **need** to get some QGIS releases out with stable
projection handling. (I suggest we stick with the 6.x versions until
PROJ 7.1 or later, and then re-investigating whether the timing is
appropriate to upgrade QGIS windows builds to proj v7).

(I realise the qgis-dev releases use proj-dev, which I think is fine
(and actually useful to get wider testing/feedback on the newer proj
releases). It's only the stable QGIS releases I'm concerned about)

Hmm.  I suppose I could bundle at least qml plugins that match Qt frameworks.  Plus others like Charts that make sense.  Or all of them, there's not much by file size.

I don't know about not being accessible.  I was looking at qt.conf possibilities to fix an old crashing problem and found Google Earth's qt.conf that sets the qml path (Qml2Imports and Imports).

Message-ID: <9f6b014c-04c1-d9f2-15e8-d56a71e7e52f@terglobo.nl>

I'm trying make a label showing milliseconds and wonder if QGIS handles 
these correctly.


The docs say:

z: the milliseconds without leading zeroes (0 to 999)
zzz: the milliseconds with leading zeroes (000 to 999)

I think the docs should say 'with/without **trailing** zeroes.


Here some examples:

format_date('2012-05-15 01:23:45.000', '.zzz  .z') --> '.000  .0'
format_date('2012-05-15 01:23:45.001', '.zzz  .z') --> '.001  .001'
format_date('2012-05-15 01:23:45.010', '.zzz  .z') --> '.010  .01'
format_date('2012-05-15 01:23:45.100', '.zzz  .z') --> '.100  .1'



Should I change the docs? Or am I wrong?

BTW, the option 'without leading zeroes' does not exist and could be 
useful. Of course you can use to_string(to_int()) here but it is less 
convenient.


Kind regards,
Raymond

Is there a well established way of testing plugins ? Is there a template
somewhere I can use to base my tests on ?

Thanks for your help,

Hi all,
I'm certainly biased here, but I believe QGIS is now possibly the best 
system for data entry and reporting for a variety of sources, most 
notably PostgreSQL, even for purely alphanumeric data. I'm seeing more 
and more applications where prin layouts are produced without a map, 
etc.
How feasible would it be to modularize the application, in order to be 
able to use it also without the map canvas and all other geographical 
goodies?
Cheers.

We are writing unit test for our processing algorithms.

Jean-Charles, can you explain your questions? Is-it about how to initialize
the Processing provider ? on travis, in unittest?

I started a simple one last week on this plugin :
https://github.com/3liz/qgis-raepa-plugin/blob/master/test/test_processing.py

Haha, I never heard anyone using QGIS for any work that doesn't have a 
map involved. Do you have examples?

But last month I suggested using QGIS for generating the invoices for 
the Dutch User Group (as an atlas). Because I didn't know another way 
for doing such a job. Besides I thought it would be funny. :)

sure, plenty of:
* designing od data entry forms (yes, even for an addressbook)
* reports including pictures and tables

Hi Etienne,

Thank you for pointing this. I'll check it out.

I want to write unit tests for my processing algorithm. I'll off course
test the functions of the algorithm itself but that is the easy part.

I was wondering if it was possible to test the integration with QGis itself
and how.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS-Server telling me 'SSL handshake failed' on
	Windows
Message-ID: <3627ff9f-06bb-e9e4-5c6e-0d3b3f9b5323@duif.net>

Hi,

Trying to setup QGIS-Server here on a fresh Windows server.
Machine is (now) behind a web proxy.

Created a project with an external WMST, which succesfully is to be
viewed in QGIS Desktop.

Then running as SERVER I see:

"Download of capabilities failed: SSL handshake failed"

It would be very helpfull if we could log WHICH handshake is failing, as
from that I could see which proxy is actually used.
I use '0' as 'QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE'.

I googled around and tried to import all kind of certificates, and or
point to them in QGIS3.ini etc
But I cannot get this project to work.

I am afraid that the proxy is using some self-signed certificate, and
for that reason imported it in the local windows store.

BUT.. is QGIS/Qt actually using that store?
Or does it have it's own certificate store?

Thanks for any pointer.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS: I only understand half of what I talk about above :-) ... so do not
take me too seriously

In my previous jobs, I got the use case where I wanted to use QGIS without
maps ...
It was a Postgresql database and I needed a application to do some CRUD on
the database, in an easy way.
QGIS does plenty of things like:
- forms
- attribute table
- conditional formatting in the attribute table
- loading views from PostgreSQL etc
- dataplotly
- layout/reports
which are indeed very nice. It looks a little bit weird to open QGIS to
open a non-spatial project :)

I didn't find any good software to replace QGIS. (maybe I was biased too)
I tried to build one quickly a few months ago for editing a single
postgresql table (with conditional formatting and forms), but I didn't go
far:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Thoughts on QGIS Development and LTR Releases
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqf5Qou6=ndKH=U06aMSTERrP6Tatw1QObZd8zGiDSTog@mail.gmail.com>

I first want to say how much I appreciate all of the QGIS developers and
all of your hard work, but I would also like to suggest that you exercise
caution when you label a release LTR. I work in a large organization where
most geospatial analysts can have access to ArcGIS if they want it. The
advantage to ArcGIS is that everyone has been trained to use it, ESRI has
been around for a long time and there is a lot of documentation, training
and support for it. So why would users want to use QGIS?

There are always a curious few who see QGIS and realize they can download
it for free at home. They tinker with it and come to like it and then they
try it in the workplace. For the users who have ArcGIS at their disposal
there must be a good reason to use QGIS instead. These tend to be the
reasons they use QGIS: 1) It does not crash as much as ArcGIS. 2) It is
faster than ArcGIS. 3) It can effectively processing larger data sets than
ArcGIS. 4) There may be some workflow in QGIS that is simpler than in
ArcGIS.

I think that the QGIS community can be proud about the fact that most of my
users who start using QGIS love it and don't want to go back to ArcGIS if
at all possible.

If a user finds that their reason for using QGIS goes away, they will be
disappointed, but will to go back to ArcGIS. I am an advocate for QGIS in
our work place. I think it should be used more, but it is really, really
hard to convince most people. Most of my users are not programmers so if
something is broken they don' t know how to fix it. We have QGIS support
contracts which help. Users consider the QGIS LTR to be a stable release.
If you release the LTR before it is stable, then that can have bad
consequences to our user base.

QGIS 3.10.2 probably should not have been labeled LTR, but I have been
actively telling our workforce not to use 3.10 yet. 3.10.2 still seems to
have some serious bugs as it is frequently crashing (negating one of the
reasons for using QGIS). There must be a WMTS problem that is causing it to
crash and I have had a report that there is a serious memory bug. I am
hoping that 3.10.3 will have solved most of these problems, but I am not
going to count on it until I test it. Everyone has different uses for QGIS
and different workflows and each person's experiences are going to be
different, but I would suggest that you don't mark a release LTR until it
is reliable. Additionally, I suggest that you never back port major
libraries or capabilities into the LTR like what happened last fall. Only
fix the bugs. As saying goes, "If it isn't broken, don't fix it." I still
have users on QGIS 2.x and they love it and it works for their needs.

I share this with you in the hope that it is helpful.

The best to you all,

Calvin

	LTR Releases

Hi Chris,
I share most of your concerns, as much as I advocate the spread of QGIS in
enterprise and organisations.
It is true we need always more reliability, documentation.  I'd like also
to point that 2.x is not so far away, and that the reliability have since
improved by order of magnitude.
Let's also keep in mind that the level of expectations of users grows very
fast too, so this is a race that will never end ;-)

However, I think there is a cultural problem, and probably a pedagogy
effort we should make.

LTR does not mean stable. LTR means it will gain bugfixes longer than
releases. So it is highly expectable that installing a LTR in its early
versions will let you hit more issues.  I remember the very same situation
for ArcGIS 8 or 9 early stages. And this is the very same for linux
distributions or any software. I don't remember any  early x.0 release in
QGIS that was not followed one week later by an urgent point release. But
new users don't know this. They see a big green button "download that sexy
new version".

That said, how to improve the situation? After years of discussions in the
various events, hackfest, conferences, discussions with public or private
customers, developpers, here are the possible leads we have:

- Keep on explaining the rationale and codes of free software to users and
potential funders.

- Try to keep our "power users / early testers" population, so that we
target the right issues during bugfix sprints.

- Offer longer LTR lifespan, so that funders have a larger window to
actually find and have bug fixed.

- Keep on explaining that QGIS bugfix release should be easily deployable
in big organisations. OSGEO4W silent installs allows this. Maybe going
toward auto upgrade /  patch system could help (it's a big effort though)

- Keep on gaining more budget for QGIS.org, so that we can setup a real
semi automated Q/A acceptance test suite. This requires human tests.
Boundless did, it is possible. It is a matter of ressources. Should it be
centralized or community powered ? I have no idea, but this requires
someone to be hired all year long to do this. IMO, enterprises requiring
such reliability should really consider sponsoring this framework and
dedicate some human ressources.

- Same goes for documentation

- Same goes for code review, we need to have more reviewers. the learning
curve is steep though, and we need to find money for this

- Improve the website with a simple page, with graphics and videos on what
is the lifecycle of QGIS, and what version to use for what expectations.


A note about QGIS.org budget. To me, it is only a leverage, a catalyser,
but it can't fund itself a full QA infrastructure with the current economic
model of the association. I think, this is our responsability to spread
this word everywhere so that the user / contributor rate changes a bit.

After all, even Microsoft with its thousands of testers, and its early
testing network was able to push updates causing the famous Blue Screen Of
the Death.
So shit can happen. Packaging nightmare with major changes in underlying
libraries remains a really really complex process. How fast we are to fix
and change our ways to do is the real question. I think the QGIS and OSGeo
Community does a tremendeous work.

Best regards,
Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Zoom to Scale Plugin - Should we include it on
	qgis.org?
Message-ID: <CABPxTTobTZyYT7FBP8CvUi5i5+nex-858nEvGB6tQv-fQp-4nQ@mail.gmail.com>

We have written a plugin that fixes the scale of the QGIS canvas to match
the integral size of EPSG:3857 map server tiles. This way there is no
degradation of the images by transformation. This has some similarities to
the QGIS 2 plugin called Tile Map Scale Plugin which was never updated for
QGIS 3.

This only works with EPSG:3857 projections. I wish I could figure out a way
to also match an EPSG:4326 tile cache to the canvas scale size, but I
cannot use the map scale to calculate this because it changes as you move
around.

Would you be interested in having this plugin added into the QGIS repo?
Unlike the Tile Map Scale Plugin ours only has a single toggle button to
lock or unlock the QGIS scale to one of the predefined scales.

Let me know what you think?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi Chris,

One year ago I proposed the following: a tree embedded widget to be used
for WMS/WMTS layers. It uses the functionality which is in the Juergens
Tile Scale Panel:

http://www.qgis.nl/2019/02/14/about-layer-tree-embedded-widgets-and-have-your-wmts-always-crispy-sharp/?lang=en

Probably you mean something else? As it is not resizing the servertiles,
but 'clicking' to the right scales (coming from the capability
documents) of the active layer.

If you mean plugins.qgis.org when you talk 'adding it to the repo' I
would say yes! Why not?
If you say add it by default to QGIS, I'd say: let's first see and check
it out as plugin :-)
Also (see discussion about resources plugin) adding python plugins to
QGIS installs has some drawbacks.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard,

Thanks for that information. I meant plugins.qgis.org. From the URL you
sent it looks like it has many of the components and it gives me ideas for
EPSG:4326.

Unless someone else is working on this I will submit a plugin after I see
if I can make it work with other CRS tile caches.

Thanks,

Calvin

How is this different to the built-in "Tile Scale" panel? Can you clarify?

Also QGIS allows to create custom scale lists and switch between scales
by selecting desired value from the scale combobox in the main window
statusbar.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MacOS packaging current situation
Message-ID: <CA+T_MsJa9utwc2BvVmNDSj_5F54rGtEqzK4RE1WLrqFUwaehxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to explain the current situation with the QGIS Mac Packaging
on Mac. The packager is dependent on the dependencies from
https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac, which were not updated to the
required proj6&gdal3 versions yet. Last production-ready version was based
on GDAL2 and therefore the official all-in-one package is based on that too
ATM.
The maintainers of homebrew-osgeo4mac work to update  to gdal3.04 and
proj6.3.1, but it will not be ready to today's release.

I apologize for not fixing the packaging bugs for last few months, since I
was waiting for the gdal3&proj6 update first.

We are looking at how to solve this issue in the long term to be able to
update dependencies for QGIS versions more flexible and even use different
versions of libraries for PR, LTR and nightlies. I will look into various
options:
1. use (forked) homebrew for QGIS dependencies
2. use conda for QGIS dependencies
3. compile deps ourselves, with a simple bash-based framework (like OSGeo4A)

If anyone is interested in helping with the packaging, we can do a meeting
or please send me a mail.

Kind regards,
Peter

Hi Alex,

As a argument against using the custom scale switch: in my country we
have a local tile-scheme [0] with a 'strange' set of scales.

So adding them means you cannot use it anymore for other scale-set's
(like Google Mercator scheme).

My little treewidget would make it possible to have a layer with 2
base/reference layers in different tile-schemes, and still make it
possible to always have a crisp scale (by making the corresponding layer
active).

@Nyall, in my case you can choose to ALWAYS zoom to the given scales
with a checkbox.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GPKG modified by QgsServer,
 with qgsogrprovider having Wal set to false
Message-ID: <20200221164453.GB5999@liz>

I'm struggling with a test that modifies a gpkg (only the header)
while QgsOgrProvider is NOT setting OGR_SQLITE_JOURNAL to WAL
(found with adding debugging to it).

Any idea about what else could be resulting in gpkg being open
in WAL mode, from a QgsServer request ?

A possible hint: modification of the file only happens when 2 GetMap
requests are made, by the same process (a single one of any of the
two requests does NOT result in modification).

Dragons are living here:

My idea and our needs are simply to lock the scale to certain resolutions
that precisely match the tiles from the map server. This is only useful if
the user is using a projection that is the same as the map server. The goal
is to avoid any transformations of the map server's image tiles. It has
nothing to do with displaying a scale bar like the "tile scale" panel.

Hi Paolo,

I just came across your exact error message (which I usually avoid since 
when I setup WMS servers I remove the requirement for the "MAP=" 
parameter), which I can duplicate if I leave in the "MAP=" parameter in 
the onlineresource url such as:

 
https://ms4w.dev/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/local-demo/local.map 
  <--that will return your error message that you saw earlier I believe

And here is a full request: 
https://ms4w.dev/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/local-demo/local.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&BBOX=-90,-180,83.64509999999999934,180&CRS=EPSG:4326&WIDTH=520&HEIGHT=251&LAYERS=countries&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png&DPI=72&MAP_RESOLUTION=72&FORMAT_OPTIONS=dpi:72&TRANSPARENT=TRUE

So I guess my point is that there is no problem with your external WMS 
service, but there might be a problem with how QGIS server handles WMS 
onlineresource urls with that 'MAP=' parameter, my guess.

Not sure if this email helps, but I thought of you minutes ago when I 
saw this with my own server.

(or if you moved on from this, then, I wish you a happy weekend ha)

Thanks a lot Jeff. I agree qgis server may be misbehaving. Maybe this is 
worth a ticket?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Testing a ComboBox with a QCompleter using QTest
Message-ID: <CAJ6DwMCRKy5qwXXviP85Qe_s2hotJs_=kO4tX4EvJuH93dfOnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would love to add some testing code to my ever more complex application.

Somehow I'm not succeeding though, these are my attempts:

#form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].setCurrentIndex(5) # , doing it
directly doesn't work
QTest.keyClicks(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'], '9000 Gent',
Qt.NoModifier, 50) # this works, a popup appears
QTest.keyClick(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'], Qt.Key_Enter,
Qt.NoModifier, 500)
QTest.keyClick(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'], Qt.Key_Tab,
Qt.NoModifier, 500)
#QTest.keyClick(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].completer,
Qt.Key_Down, Qt.NoModifier, 500)
#print(dir(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].completer().widget()))
#form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].completer().setCurrentRow(0)
#QTest.keyClick(form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].completer().widget().lineEdit(),
Qt.Key_Enter, Qt.NoModifier, 500)
#form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002'].setEditText('1000 Brussel')

The popup is the completer, I suppose, so I also tried to send keystrokes
to that, but no luck.

This is the method I use to add the completer to the QComboBox:

def add_completer(self, items):
    self.setEditable(True)
    self.setInsertPolicy(0)
    completer = QCompleter(items, self)
    completer.setFilterMode(Qt.MatchContains)
    completer.setCaseSensitivity(False)
    self.setCompleter(completer)
    self.setStyleSheet('QScrollBar: vertical {width: 16px;}')

Bas,

Will QGIS 3.4.15 be built against GDAL 2 or GDAL 3 / PROJ 6 for ubuntu
focal? If it's the latter, that's likely very problematic (Nyall can
confirm).

We learned the hard way there is no practical way to ship a reliable 3.4.X
build against GDAL 3 / PROJ 6.

Currently PROJ 6 & GDAL 3, see:

 https://launchpadlibrarian.net/462211122/buildlog_ubuntu-focal-amd64.qgis_3.4.15+dfsg-1ubuntu2_BUILDING.txt.gz

That's why Ubuntu users should use to packages from qgis.org instead of
those in Ubuntu itself, as I mentioned before:

qgis (3.10.3+dfsg-1~exp1) is in the NEW queue since yesterday, if it
makes it out of NEW and into unstable before the 27th it will likely be
synced into focal automatically. If not, someone who cares about qgis in
Ubuntu should work with the Ubuntu people to get it in after the Debian

Hi devs,

  

How can I get the interpolated Z value (as shown in the picture below) of a layer (PolygonZ) for a clicked or existent point with PyQgis?

  



  

I already know how to do it with a raster layer (sample raster), like code below:

  

rastSample = Raster.dataProvider().identify(point, QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results()

  

Anyone can help me?

  

Thank you,

Reinstalling apparently does not help.
Any hint?

An idea could be: fixed label placement at every map panning at a fixed
scale.

This could be useful for:

 - WMS map tiling. This label placement would fix all WMS tiling issues in
one place.
 - Need for fixed labels positions, for example for cadastral maps. It is
not important to "see" the entire label, but it is more important to have
it with fixed position

Hi,

A wanted to know if, using Python, ilone can access and manipulate the list
of selected nodes/vertex, which have been selected using the node tool
(digitising toolbar)

My objective would be to change the selected nodes x, y, z values.

Thanks,

The way I understand it, this is not exposed to the Python API. Maybe this
is something a GSoC student could implement this summer? I had the same
problem a few months ago.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] issues with relations and embedded forms
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671odhkG0XEpBVTS3mWZXX5AVqB-ZXq+E72_dbi-W3ajVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

it's probably me not being a power user, but from a few simple tests I'm
doing with relations (1:n) on spatialite/gpkg layers I'm experiencing a few
issues and I wonder if there is something I missed or if we can improve the
workflow.

My test schema is pretty simple:
-----------
table1 (parent)
-----------
fid (default: sqlite_fetch_and_increment...)
name

-----------
table2 (child)
-----------
fid
fk_table1 -> table1.fid
name

ISSUE 1:
- add a new item in table1
- in the embedded form add a table2 item
- click on "Save child layer edits" button -> backend CONSTRAINT FAILURE!
because table1 parent is not saved (and not even in the editing buffer, for
what matters)

QUESTIONS on ISSUE1:
- should we disable the "Save child layer edits" button in case the parent
is unsaved?
- what's the idea behind the "Save child layer edits" when the user cannot
even save the parent from the form, why can she save the children?
- would it make sense to check for the unsaved parent in
QgsRelationEditorWidget::saveEdits() before attempting a children save?

ISSUE 2:
- preparation: add one parent and a few children and commit
- activate identify tool and click on a parent feature
- the form opens but no children are shown in the child form, all values
are NULL, I would expect that the first child is automatically selected and
focused

ISSUE 3:
- preparation: add one parent and a few children and commit
- activate identify tool and click on a parent feature
- click on "Add Point child feature"
- click on map canvas
- another attribute form opens, I would expect that instead of opening a
new form, the embedded form was focused, with the new feature geometry
associated and ready for input of other field values, the form open may be
fixed with the option I've added here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34654.

Before I attempt any further patches, I'd like to hear your opinion on how
we could make the data entry process a little bit easier and error-proof in
case of parent-child relations, especially now that QGIS is dropping the
GIS and becoming the new Access ;)

Cheers

It works under some given pre-conditions:

- Working with non database systems (shp, xls, ..., risk of data 
inconsistencies)

- Working with database systems without fk constraints (risk of data 
inconsistencies)

- Working with databases with transaction mode enabled and deferred fk 
checks (<-- it was designed for this exact use case)


I'm not sure how to best improve the situation here and help users to 
prepare their system apart from documentation. Ideas welcome.

Agreed, annoying!

That's likely a tricky thing to accomplish with transaction mode enabled 
because to bring it into the embedded form it has first to be sent to 
the DB and NOT NULL (and other) constraints satisfied which is hard to 
guarantee before opening a form.

I think the easiest solution would be to just drop all foreign keys and 
other constraints on production databases, they just tend to mess up 
things ;P

Hi,

I am having problems compiling QGIS 3.10.3 on Debian stretch. The compile does work flawlessly on Debian buster.
Is compiling on Debian stretch not supported anymore?

The upstream packaging removed support for stretch (and xenial):

There's a similar thread on the user list about importing pyproj.
Looks like an osgeo packaging issue to me.,..

Hi,

I'm having similar issues and sent a message previously. Please can someone confirm if this is a known bug which is being worked on as it is causing me quite a few issues and at the moment I've run out of ideas; it appears to be a regression in the latest release (unless it has been fixed now).

Cheers,
Paul

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PGSYSCONFDIR environmental variable use in QGIS
	Postgres service
Message-ID: <1582796399080-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I have a .pg_service.conf file with a Postgres connection use as a Service
connection in QGIS dialog "Create a New PostGIS Connection", running on
Windows 10.

This works fine when the pg_service is placed in the folder
"C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Roaming\Postgresql".

Now to change the folder of the pg_service file I somewhere read that the
folder is defined in environmental variable PGSYSCONFDIR, but setting a path
in this variable does not make QGIS look in the new folder for the
.pg_service.conf file. It still looks in the folder 
"C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Roaming\Postgresql".

Do I misunderstand the meaning of PGSYSCONFDIR variable use in QGIS?

	Layer)
Message-ID: <9668562ea31e40159330381760159db6@swm.de>

Dear all,

in our current project, we use the processing network analysis algorithm "Shortest path (Point To Layer)".

Unfortunately, since we updated to Version 3.10.3 this algorithm calculates different results then we got with version 3.4.13.

We have round about 700 point objects in the layer we are operating on and with version 3.4.13 we get 50 objects with cost "NULL" (because the start point is set to NULL), with version 3.10.3 we get about 150 objects with cost "NULL".

That's why we get different objects as a final result with the shortest path.

The layers are exactly the same in both versions because we are operating on the same database.

Unfortunately, we cannot publish those layers without editing them.

We hope that someone is familiar with this challenge and able to help us :).

Best regards
Josef

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PGSYSCONFDIR environmental variable use in
 QGIS Postgres service

I think you have to name the file "pg_service.conf" not ".pg_service.conf"
when setting  PGSYSCONFDIR. It works well here.

By the way, these type of questions are better asked in qgis-user.

Cheers,

Olivier

It's certainly a challenge! To be honest, it's almost impossible to
dig further into this without some example data and workflows which
can be used to test with. There's already a decent unit test coverage
of this functionality, and the automated tests have not detected any
regressions. This leads me to believe it's a corner case you're
hitting with your particular dataset and inputs...

Hi,

I'm really stuck on this.

I'm trying to test a combobox with a completer:

When I do these manually, they work:

        cb = self.form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002']
        QTest.keyClicks(cb, '9000')
        QTest.qWait(1000)
        QTest.keyClick(cb, Qt.Key_PageUp, Qt.NoModifier, 500)
        QTest.keyClick(cb, Qt.Key_Enter, Qt.NoModifier, 500)

When I want to simulate them with the above commands, all I see is the
popup.

I also tried the following:

        cb = self.form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002']
        QTest.keyClicks(cb, '9000')
        lv = cb.findChild(QListView)
        QTest.qWait(1000)
        QTest.mouseClick(lv.viewport(), Qt.LeftButton, 0,
lv.visualRect).center())

Based on what I found here:

https://gist.github.com/peteristhegreat/cbd8eaa0e565d0b82dbfb5c7fdc61c8d

and here:

https://vicrucann.github.io/tutorials/qttest-signals-qtreewidget/

I was glad I managed to translate it from C, but no joy.

I don't see anything related to QGIS in your issue, you should
probably ask on a Qt/PyQt mailing list.

Hi Nyall (and others up for helping with the changelog)

Firstly apologies I couldn’t work on the changelog much on the run up to the release. If those who added features in 3.12 could be so kind as to add the ‘Changelog’ label to their PR’s and make sure the description in the PR is nicely formatted, I will put them all through into the changelog. Unfortunately I can’t (yet) slice it e.g. by date so I have to do it in one go. I did go through about 18 pages!!! Of PR’s and tried to add Changelog label to them but there are many many more pages of PR’s to review. You guys are machines. Unfortunately the volunteer that Paolo found last release to help with the changelog hasn’t resurfaced, so anyone who can help will earn my (our) undying gratitude.

I am going to try to have the auto-adding of changelog entries (based on a label) done mid cycle for the next release.

Regards


Tim

Nyall,

What if you added a lock checkbox to the tile scale panel so that if you
resize QGIS it wont resize the underlying image, but keep it locked onto
the fixed scales of the scale bar? It appears to me that the scale bar is
locking it to the scale of the image tiles when you move it. Am I right
with that assumption?

Thanks,

Calvin

Hello Jo,

Try this:

QTest.mouseClick(cb.lineEdit(), Qt.LeftButton)
QTest.keyClicks(cb.lineEdit(), '9000')
QTest.qWait(1000)
lv = completer.popup()
indx = lv.model().index(0, 0)
print(indx.data())
indx_center = lv.visualRect(indx).center()
QTest.mouseMove(
    lv,
    pos=indx_center,
    delay=250)
QTest.mouseClick(
    lv.viewport(),
    Qt.LeftButton,
    pos=indx_center,
    delay=250)

Summary:

- QTest.mouseClick is sent to the combobox's QLineEdit, to set focus
- QTest.keyClicks should trigger your completer's list view
- QTest.qWait waits for the completer to show up (if long list, etc.)
- Instead of searching for QListView of QComboBox, ask for the completer's
popup()
- Get the first index of the list view's model
- Print the index's data (text) to Python Console to verify it is the right
index for test
- Find index's visual center, in global coordinates
- Move the mouse there, so you can visually verify where the click is going
to occur
- Finally, click to auto-fill line edit with item from completer's list

Tested in QGIS 3.10.3 on macOS 10.15.3 under Python 3.8 and Qt 5.12.5.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Help with PR 34780 (don't cast PostgreSQL bigint
	PKs to text)
Message-ID: <CAEvhHDmtio-X1gr7Q7pbYcR2WORyNeqg93ZUKWvy8zZE=dJBEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to prevent QGIS from casting bigint/bigserial primary keys to
text. I've submitted a pull request (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/34780 ); it builds and runs correctly on
my system (PostgreSQL 12.2, Gentoo Linux), but the unit tests fail both on
my system and on Travis (which I understand has PostgreSQL 11); Azure seems
to be happy with it.

I'm a bit at a loss on what to do next; I think that maybe the test should
be updated, since we don't treat bigint PostgreSQL PKs as text anymore, but
I'm unsure if that is the correct way.

The specific test I'm looking at is ran with

$ ctest -V -R PyQgsPostgresProvider

And it fails at
tests/src/python/test_provider_postgres.py:410

Ordinary integers are tested differently (as can be seen on line 398).

Jürgen Fischer pointed me to the discussion in PR #3036 (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/3036 ), which was made to allow for
negative  PKs, but changed bigint PKs to text.

Can you please shed some light on this issue? M. Kuhn? Anyone?

Thank you very much.
P.S.: here are the reports (besides my own itch) that motivated this PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/34077
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/348536/qgis-form-performance

Hi Larry,

Thank you so much for that! It all works as you describe, except that my
QGIS doesn't show that completer where one would expect it (under the
combobox), but rather at position 0,0 of the widget it is in. So that's
odd. The mouse pointer is moved to the middle of the displaced completer
widget, so your code works fine.

The other thing that doesn't work as expected, is that the mouse click
doesn't transfer the entry to the combobox.

When I don't let the script do the mouseclick and I do it myself, it also
doesn't work. (not executing the last mouseclick of your script and then
doing it manually)

When I do arrow up or page up and then enter, it also doesn't work.

When I start the whole test manually, the popup appears where one would
expect it and it's possible to type in the combobox's lineEdit and then
mouseclick to select the value from the completer.

Normal:

This is what happens when run from the script:

So that's weird, as if it didn't know what combobox it belongs to. The
mousepointer is at the correct position though. Clicking it manually has no
effect either.

This is the code as I have it at the moment:

        cb = self.form.dockwidget.widget['sc_510_002']
        QTest.mouseClick(cb.lineEdit(), Qt.LeftButton)
        QTest.keyClicks(cb.lineEdit(), '9000')
        QTest.qWait(1000)
        completer_popup = cb.completer().popup()
        indx = completer_popup.model().index(0, 0)
        print(indx.data())
        indx_center = completer_popup.visualRect(indx).center()
        QTest.mouseMove(completer_popup, pos=indx_center, delay=250)

I had to change the completer to  cb.completer()

Hi Larry,

I am rather ashamed... I was sending these mouseclicks and keyclicks to a
combobox on another frame, that was invisible at the time. They all have
these codes, not actual names to identify them with.

Now it works, thank you so much for your help with this!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Relation reference widget: flaky test,
	final notice!
Message-ID: <CAB28Asg5EhyP2e2Yij7sEhufrdwHKtnWD=woQcF2bdXSy2ho_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm about to completely disable the relation reference widget test on
the CI -- it's been broken for about a week now, starting with flaky
failures and now completely crashing.

There's been a lot of different devs recently working on this widget,
and I suspect the current CI failures are a real issue caused as
fallout of this work.

If you've been working on this widget lately, please checkout the test
failures and see if your work caused it!

Hi Groene,

I agree that the Road map is not easy to understand. Just to clarify things
(I hope):

The current LTR is 3.10 (currently at 3.10.3). It only became LTR in
February although its first release was done in october (3.10.0). The idea
is to let it mature (and have a broader usage and tests) for at least 4
months before it becomes LTR.

This means that for the next 12 months, more or less every month a new
patch release will come out. That will be 3.10.4, 3.10.5 and so on. Only
bug fixes are allowed on these releases, no new features.

If there is a version with some extra number (e.g. 3.4.13-3) it means that
something happened during packaging of the patch release, requiring a new
package/installer to be created. You should always try to use the latest
version of the LTR version, which should be the most stable one.

Hope it helps.

Hi everyone,

I'm not a QGIS developer but I've been a user since 1.X days. Aside from a
few quirks (e.g. dependency issues on Linux), I've always liked the QGIS
release cycle so I'm coming from that perspective.

To add to Alexandre's explanation, this is usually how I explain QGIS
releases:
There are 3 branches of development - LR (Latest Release), LTR (Long Term
Release), and nightly builds. Let's take a look at the LR and LTR branches.

I usually take "maintained" to mean that the branch is actively developed
-- bugs will be fixed, new features are added, etc.

The LTR (now 3.10.3) is maintained until the next LTR (in 12 months when
3.16.4 becomes the LTR). During those 12 months, a PR (Point Release) will
be released for the LTR branch each month (named 3.10.4, 3.10.5, ...,
3.10.14). This PR includes the bug fixes for 3.10.X. Being an LTR means
that there (usually) won't be any changes that will break that version in 1
year. This is usually why people think of LTR as "stable".

The LR (now 3.12.0) contains the most recent features of QGIS. A new LR is
released every 4 months. The next LR (3.14) is slated to be released in
June 2020, the next after that is 3.16 in October 2020. The 2nd LR released
after the release of the LTR is the version that will become the next LTR.
In this case, the 3.16 version that will be released in October 2020 is
slated to become the LTR after 4 months (e.g. 3.16.4 will become the LTR by
February 2021). For each month, a PR is also released for the LR branch
until a new LR is released. For example, there will be a 3.12.1, 3.12.2,
and 3.12.3 releases for March, April, and May 2020 until the 3.14 release
in June. This repeats for 3.14.1,..,3.14.3 until the 3.16 release in
October. Throughout the year, there can be big changes between LR versions
(e.g. between 3.12, 3.14, and 3.16) as compared to the LTR which stays at
3.10.X. It's also worth noting that useful features in the LR branch can be
backported (added to) the LTR branch.

The "LR/PR" released every 4 months denotes that the release is a new LR.
The "LTR/PR" released in October denotes that this release will be the next
LTR. It is not put in the LTR repo until 4 months later (February) where it
officially becomes the LTR.

We can also think of it this way:
For the LTR branch, you can expect updates every month of its life (or with
every point release) with 3.10.3, 3.10.4, 3.10.5, ..., 3.10.14 but these
will usually be minor and not so drastic.
Meanwhile, there may be drastic and major changes between LRs like 3.12,
3.14, 3.16, etc. but only minor changes between PRs of the same LR -- eg
3.12.1 and 3.12.2, 3.14.1 and 3.14.2, etc.

I also agree that the road map found at
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html is geared
a lot towards dev people but, in its defense, it is located under the "Get
Involved/Development" part of the documentation.

If I have misrepresented or misunderstood anything, please don't hesitate
to correct me.


All the best,
Ben Hur
