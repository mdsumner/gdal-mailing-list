Hi Maxim

I'm also in favour of such a function. To change attribute values, there is already a function in QgsVectorLayer. But to change geometries, there is no such function (as you pointed out).
My suggestion is to call the function changeGeometry and to pass feature id and geometry as arguments, since the function does not do anything with attributes:

bool QgsVectorLayer::changeGeometry(int featureId, QgsGeometry* geom)

Regards,
Marco

Betreff: [Qgis-developer] synchronization function suggestion
 
Hi all,

Sometime ago we were stuggling with editing features within a layer. I'm not
talking about QgsVectorLayer methods that are already implemented and working fine,
but other basic geometry editing functions, that sometimes
require to store results in the same layer. Like clip, buffer etc.

The main problem is that, while methods that are already in API are
able to do that (lets take moveVertex for example), new ones should
work around to reflect changes without comitting.

So we want to propose to add a generic function to synchronize changed
geometries. This function might be useful for future
API extension or plugins, that will add functionality to work on
geometries within a layer. Something like:

bool QgsVectorLayer::updateFeature(QgsFeature &feat)
{
  mChangedGeometries[feat.id()]=*feat.geometry();
  setModified( true, true );
  return true;
}


Any thoughts?

Maxim

PS: this is from a conversation with our developer, so I might have
misinterpreted something, but it seems logical to me. We can work on
the implementation, if there are no objections.

Actually yesterday I've encountered the same problem :-)
We should also deprecate the vector layer functions like insertVertex
or moveVertex (which just modify the geometry) in favour of this new
one.

AFAIK there's nobody actively working on it. I don't think it's very
difficult to implement, it just needs some design decisions to be
taken on how to do it. No design has been proposed yet.

Carson's plugin has a different approach (saving results to a new
file) and can't be used as is.

great! We're ready to work on that and send patch to trac.
Actually it is already implemented locally (but not sent to trac yet). Just
want to make sure, that nobody is currently working on this.

User is not always aware of whether the plugin he was using was
written in Python or C++. Devs, not bug-reporter should care about the language.

Message-ID: <D316B6B8-13D8-4088-B9F0-7581208029C2@kyngchaos.com>

I took the liberty of updating the INSTALL build instructions for OSX  
in trunk.  INSTALL should probably be updated for other systems, as  
there are some old version references (both dependencies, and QGIS  
itself).  Should INSTALL be updated in release 1.1 before release?

Some notes on my OSX changes:

I removed most explicit version references for dependencies.

I didn't touch the subversion section, since I'm working on Leopard,  
which includes svn.

I didn't touch the Qgis source download section.  There are old QGIS  
version references for checking out source, but I wasn't sure how to  
clean it up.  Maybe we should have some tarball download instructions  
also?  And a generic svn checkout example?

Martin, thanks for working on that

please  note  I  added  the ticket with the patch, which includes both
geometry  and  attributes  update  and python bindings. If you
decided  to  keep updating geometry and attributes separate, it should
be closed as "wontfix".

Subject: [Qgis-developer] tabbed interface
Message-ID: <1641048102.20090503151142@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

I wanted to get some ideas about tabbed interface extension for QGIS,
recently suggested by Lynx_r. Right now the tabs are visible only if
more than 1 tab is present. Do I understand right that QGIS had tabs
before? THey are present on some pictures, like this one for example.

I see it as a feature which can really add to QGIS unique feel and
look. Right now it allows to have multiple versions of QGIS layer stacks under one
roof, something like Firefox. It was made to run other type of
views: for example 3D View. But I'm thinking that Map composer Layout
and may be Tables, can fit into the tabs too.

Tabbed interface raises at least two questions:
1. Should we adopt changes to project file also? May be make a
separate "Save multiproject file?" option, available if more than 1
tab is open?
2. Should we also develop the idea of putting Map Composer into a tab?
If so, this would probably mean, that some of the tools need to be
hidden depending on tab type (data view, map layout, table, 3D, etc.)

Any thoughts?

Maxim

Hi.

I am going to explain what I mean...

My CustomMapCanvasItem subclasses the MapCanvasItem class.
The constructor for my objects includes a call to MapCanvasItem(MapCanvas)
so as to initialize the parent class instance.
This call in turn executes a QGraphicsItem(0, MapCanvas->scene()) for the
same purpose and consequently adds the newly created item to the scene
(which is a private member of the MapCanvas).
Then, somehow, Qgis renders the scene using the QGraphicsScene and
QgraphicsView methods.

My point here is to say that since I add the Items to the scene, and since I
don't control how Qgis accesses those items after having added them (because
QGis uses the QGraphicsScene and View methods for the rendering), I can't
add any synchronization between Qgis thread and mine.
In short: since Qgis thread does not implement any synchronization for the
accesses to the QGraphicsItems/Scene/View, it is useless to try and
synchronize in my own thread.

I understand very well what you mean when you say that the graphics scene
must not be used concurrently without synchronization, but since Qgis code
does not synchronize, I don't see how I could in my own thread alone...

I hope I have made my point clear enough...
Maybe things do not take place at all like I think they do, because
apparently you find my question strange and I am not an expert in Qt inner
workings...

Although I know you are probably handling numerous other questions at the
same time, If you can find a few moments to look into mine further, I would
greatly appreciate it. If it is possible for you, maybe you could give me a
quick idea of how you would create a thread designed to move the items and
provide synchronization at the same time (explanations or pseudo code would
be great).

Thank you again for your help.

I got your point. Still you can use the solution what I've suggested
you earlier: emit signals with necessary information from the worker
thread to a connected object in main thread. In main thread these
signals are queued and the slots are executed from the event loop. So
if you're going to do some modifications to the graphics scene in
these slots, you're pretty sure that you're going to avoid run
condition possibility because they're run in the main thread.

Hope that makes sense

that was quite some time ago when we were considering move to a tabbed
interface. But it never got more work than just the creation of the
tab widget so in some higher version it was removed to same some
space.

This was the original idea: support more canvas views at once (or even
more projects at once) and allow more types of views - just as you
write: map composer, attribute table, georeferencer etc.

There's a technical barrier - there's quite some QGIS code that
assumes there's just one active project and there's just one map
canvas view.

IMO this is the way to go. I had some further ideas: the views would
come with their own "widgets" that are appropriate to only that type
of view - e.g. legend, overview and editing tools for map canvas view,
georeferencing settings for georeferencer, ...
Moreover, these tabs should be detachable: everyone uses a different
setup - someone with very large screen (or more screens) would prefer
to open some views in separate windows (and see them all at once)
instead of having to switch between them.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS & GRASS
Message-ID: <49FE8FE5.7000804@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Even though these "web statistics" are always to be taken with caution:
http://www.google.com/insights/search/overviewReport?cat=&q=qgis&geo=&date=&gprop=&clp=&cmpt=q#q=qgis%2Cgrass
gis&cmpt=q
(thanks Maxim for pointing it out)
I think they tell us several interesting things, particularly from the
point of view of users (those most likely to use a search engine for the
sw they are using/trying to use):
- qgis is on the rise, grass is decreasing. I do not think this means
there is competition between the two, but rather that people use the two
programs as a toolset, doing what is best done with each of them. It
seems that qgis is replacing grass for simpler (desktop) tasks, and
grass is mainly used for more complex analyses
- for both programs, the association between the two terms (qgis+grass)
is among the top ranking search items; this confirms the above hypothesis
- together, they are much more popular that their main alternative, gvSIG:
http://www.google.com/insights/search/overviewReport?cat=&q=qgis&geo=&date=&gprop=&clp=&cmpt=q#q=qgis%2Cgrass
gis%2Cgvsig&cmpt=q .
Unfortunately, it seems that both qgis and grass devs are mainly
concentrated on their core sw, with limited attention to the interaction
between the two (eg the qgis-plugin-grass does not have a dedicated dev,
and in grass a lot of dev effort has been put to implement a new UI,
replicating many functionalities already usable in qgis (also for grass
layers).
I would therefore respectfully suggest devs, form the users perspective,
to consider concentrating on the best of each world, reducing the
duplication of efforts, and improving the (already good) interaction
between the two programs.
On the other hand, I would suggest users to invest some resources to go
in the same direction. As a part of this, I'm investing some money (and
I plan to do more in the future) to fix long standing bugs in qgis,
personally mainly focusing on the qgis-plugin-grass:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/index.php/Bugs
All the best.

+1 to that from an end-user like me.

I would like also to mention OpenEV. It is the fastest geodata viewer
[period]. I don't know the coding background and the differences for
among QGIS, GRASS and OpenEV, but why not use it, create interaction
with it _or_ use parts of its code _or_ just look at some of its
attractive features?

Kindest regards, Nikos

+1
I understand the importance and the need to give all the best to the
core dev, as there are many parts that need to be
mantained/updated/refactored/built (ie the raster core code in
qgis...), but I support a boost to the 'joints' of the systems
integration. as I think that their integration is a leading factor for
their diffusion and presence in the end-user community.
I'm happy to see the proposal from Paolo about a found raising for
qgis-grass-plugin, and I hope I will be able to contribute (also
economically).
The other important (foundamental, in my opinion) issue is the Windows
support. I've tried to give a help for the Osgeo4w stack some time
ago, but I've wasted all my time in trying to solve Windows Vista's
problems... without very good results!

have a nice day,
giovanni

Hi,

this class is not (yet) included in the python bindings. You can use
plain QHttp instead.

I'll likely be at FOSS4G, and for the other dates, I can likely attend 
in person... but either one works for me (virtually or in person).

Hi all,

I've just commited a patch to trunk (r10730) that makes possible to
set shortcuts to actions. I hope it will make usage of QGIS more
efficient :-)
Anyway, if there's interest from plugin developers, it could add a new
method to qgis interface that would enable plugins to add their own
actions (QAction instances, i.e. menu / toolbar items) to the
configure shortcuts dialog.

Btw. some of the default shortcut assignments are quite strange,
suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Hi Martin,

it would be very cool if Plugin authors could add their own actions for 
shortcut assignments!

Thanks a lot!

Hi

So as Martin said the tabs were removed in the cleanup phase for 1.0
release. The intention was to reinstate them when we had an actual
multi-view implementation to accompany them. I would very much like to
see the composer embedded into a tab instead of popping up a separate
main window. And of course there is the 3d view coming down the line.
I'd also like to see the georef plugin able to funtion as two side by
side map views since the interface is a little awkward at the moment.

As mentioned on the IRC channel we could also consider using dock
widgets instead of tabs because they may give us all the functionality
we want since they can be:
- - stacked like tabs
- - placed side by side for view against view comparison stuff
- - torn of for floating windows

As Martin also mentioned the main thing we need to do is revise the
architecture so that we can have multiple canvases without breaking
existing tools.

One more thing to consider is how to deal with layer instances that are
share accross canvases. I can see these scenarios:

- - add a layer to a canvas and drag it onto another canvas using a
modifier key e.g. ctl to copy it over and keep symbology syncronised

- - add a layer to a canvas and drag it onto another canvas using a
different modifier key e.g. alt to copy it over and keep symbology
UNsyncronised

- - do the same without modifier to move a layer from one canvas to another

- - add a layer using conventional dialog to a canvas and ensure that
registry has a unique instance for each time layer was added

We also need to account for the use case scenario where a user wants two
copies of the same canvas just rendered at different scales - much like
the overview currently does.


We also have to add infrastructure to dynamically change legends as
canvas focus changes, or embed the legend as part of a more complex
canvas widget.

I added another repository for Opensuse at the Application:Geo build server

The stable QGIS 1.0.x packages are now called qgis10 and then the version number
1.0.2 => qgis10-1.0.2-6.3.i586.rpm    

The packages from trunk are called as usual qgis plus version number
1.1.0 => qgis-1.1.0-2.3.i586.rpm    

They are both build for the opensuse versions already described at
http://download.qgis.org/downloads.rhtml

btw: It would be great, if we can integrate that page into the qgis.org web
page somehow, so there is only one page we need to update.

Hm, I'll have to think about that.  It shouldn't be too hard with  
what's in the readme, but some people may need more details.   
Basically, you should be able to build Qgis by editing the  
qgis_user.xcconfig, opening the project in Xcode and selecting/ 
clicking Build.

Note that the project download on my site is for Qgis 1.0.1, though it  
should be usable for 1.0.2, the internal build needs updating.  The  
trunk project is way out of date, and I just now removed it.  It's up  
to date in the trunk source.

Hi

I have a project with a few hundred raster files and opening of the
QGIS project file is very slow (> 20 minutes). I have had a few
crashes recently and so waiting 20 minutes to open the project again
is not much fun. The following messages pop up for each raster layer
and I wish to know if these failures might be contributing
significantly to my slow project opening. If these failures are
significant can you suggest how to deal with them?

Many thanks

Craig

Hi Stephan,

As far as I know, the different types you listed are just the types that
qt offers as proxy types. In most cases, the "Default Proxy" or the
"HttpProxy" should work fine. I some special cases, other proxies may have
to be used. I think it is very specific to the proxy that is in use and
sometimes you need some "trial and error" ...

Maybe it would be useful to link from the manual to here:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qnetworkproxy.html#ProxyType-enum

In my case I am using the "HttpProxy" which works fine with Squid.

Hi Craig,

in my experience slow loading of project files is often due to
thumbnail creation, which requires creating a downsampled
version of the file. This may be very inefficient if the input file
does not support overviews. 

You could try adding overviews for your input rasters using the gdal 
utility "gdaladdo".

cheers,

   Manuel

If you are comfortable with the Terminal, you have Apple's developer  
tools installed, and you have all of William's frameworks that are  
necessary for qgis installation, you can download the qgis source with  
svn, cd to the qgis_source/mac/xcode directory, then issue the command  
'xcodebuild'. This will build the application if nothing fails along  
the way without having to fool with Xcode itself. You may need to  
change the python setting in qgis_user.xcconfig (copy the template) to  
'PYTHON_FORM = system' if you use the native Apple-supplied python and  
python bindings are not building.

Once you get a build, you can then copy the application from the build/ 
native/Release directory to your Applications folder. I build the  
trunk source to play with new features and help report bugs, so I  
delete the build directory every time I want to make a new build.

Note that Xcode defaults to the first configuration alphabetically,  
which makes the Debug build default.  Use '-configuration Release' for  
a normal build.

I haven't tried it myself, but it sounds like you have and it's  
working.  Good to know.

Looking back at my last build invoking just the xcodebuild command, it  
appears to build a release target:

=== BUILDING AGGREGATE TARGET config OF PROJECT Qgis WITH THE DEFAULT  
CONFIGURATION (Release) ===

Perhaps I made a config file change, but I don't see anything at a  
glance.

Have you opened the Xcode project (this copy) in Xcode before?  The  
CLI xcodebuild may be seeing your personal prefs in the project and  
you had selected the Release config then.

Or maybe not?  As I said, I haven't tried xcodebuild.

I think shortcuts must start with a modifier (like Ctrl or Cmd). 
This should also resolve the bug I reintroduced
(http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/739) in the terminal of grass
plugin :(
What do you think about?

Cheers,
Lorenzo

P.S. 
Can anyone help me with such bug?
We haven't any mac in Faunalia.

Andreas,

I've added it in r10741.

An example - during plugin initialization:

action = QAction( ... )
if hasattr(iface, 'registerMainWindowAction'):
  iface.registerMainWindowAction( action, "Ctrl+M" )

It's wise to check whether the method is present to keep compatibility
with older versions of QGIS.
When unloading the plugin, one should unregister the action:

if hasattr(iface, 'unregisterMainWindowAction'):
  iface.unregisterMainWindowAction( action )


Enjoy!

Martin

Requiring users to use only shortcuts with modifiers doesn't really
solve the problem...
This one could be resolved by developers with access to mac.

Could I suggest you use the gdalbuildvrt tool to create a single virtual
raster dataset. Its much more efficient and means you only need to add a
single layer to the legend which is much easier to deal with visually.

You need gdal 1.6 with python support for the tool I believe.

Hi all,

I have used QGIS and the GRASS plugin extensively for GIS training in
the past. I still think that it is a great combination but has suffered
from a long period of inactive development. It is good to see that some
new life is finally being breathed into the GRASS plugin!

In the past, usability of QGIS + GRASS has been limited for me, due
to the following problems. I must admit that I have not given things
another try with one of the recent QGIS versions, so some of these
issues might have been addressed already:

1. QGIS flattens 3D vector layers to 2D. While GRASS is one of the few
GIS that have some real 3D power, it's hard to harness that under QGIS.
This needs fixing on the QGIS side. 3D coordinates should at least be
kept in QGIS layers, not just silently discarded.

2. There is no support at all for voxel type maps in the GRASS plugin.

3. The region setting tool is far too limited. One of the great things
about GRASS is how easy it is to set the computational region precisely
to the extent of e.g. one or several maps. But I always have to go
back to g.region on the CLI because the graphical tool is useless.
Particularly for 3D settings.

4. A better widget for multiple map input selection (e.g. r.patch) is
needed.

5. On the GRASS side, we need to come up with some sort of signaling
mechanism that allows QGIS (or any other "host") to know when the
computational region or any map data has been modified.

6. Colour schemes for raster maps and vector maps ("GRASSRGB" column
in attribute table) should be honored for display by QGIS.

My feeling is that most of these points would not be too hard to
address. With a little work on the rough edges, GRASS + QGIS could
be a beautiful, smoothly working combination.

Hi Ben.
Thanks for your comments.
Any idea on how to find the resources needed to implement these things?
See
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/index.php/Bugs
All the best.

Thanks for the tips. My orthophotos are in MrSid format and include
overviews, but I could add overviews to my topo files. I like the idea
of a VRT file being more efficient for QGIS, so I'll explore this.

It seems I shouldn't be concerned with the CRS look up failures (?)

Hi Folks

I made a package for 1.0.2 recycling both Marco Pasetti's installer work
and Jef and other's package building work.

https://linfiniti.com/qgis

There is an occasional crash with grass that I discussed briefly with
Jef but still need to come up with a solution for.

I will put up the 1.1.0 windows all in one package hopefully tonight if
bandwidth allows.

Any feedback will be welcome (particularly on how to resolve the GRASS
crashes) before I move the package onto the official download site as
part of the release.

Regards

Hi Tim
thanks for the effort,

how this package works under Vista?

I'm not a windows user but there are many colleagues with Vista around
here and the osgeo4w still has problemas under this platform (Grass
crashes regularly).


Thanks in advance

I don't know I dont have vista (or any plans to get it). It will be
great if those with vista etc could test.

I suspect the same problems you have with OSGEO4W crashes will occur
with my packages since it takes the OSGEO4W libs when building the all
in one bundle.

Perhaps the person who last made a mingw build would like to try to make
a package too?

Tim

We would need to generate it - from what I recall in reading the Qt
docs, this is not very difficult to do but we should think carefully
about taking on yet another maintenance task. There are so many cool
things we can potentially do, but each one dilutes us a little more. If
there is someone out there willing to champion it (like Martin maintains
and champions python support) it would be great to have, otherwise I
think there are other fish we should fry...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] fTools table join problem
Message-ID: <AABAEEE5-92F5-463F-AE02-43A29DA696EC@gmail.com>

Carson,

I'm trying to perform a table join using an existing shapefile and an  
external dbf file. I get the following error when I perform the task,  
but I am not sure why it is claiming the match columns (or one of  
them) is not string or numeric. I've used both string and numeric  
(integer) columns with the same result.

I can send you the table and shapefile in a separate email if that  
will help resolve this.

Thanks,
John

I discovered that ECW support is missing. Is it intentional?

Yes its intentional - if you want support, just get the ecw dll's and
put them in the bin/gdalplugins dir. I reread the license of ecw and I'm
still not happy that we wont face legal action etc if we ship them. If
someone can approach Erdas directly and get there written agreement for
us to include their dll's I'll be happy to include them in the package.

Same for MrSid

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New "QGIS Case Studies" article series
Message-ID: <20090507104744.44bbc06a@nature>

Dear QGIS users,

we would like to announce the first QGIS user story on the qgis website. We hope
this will be the beginning of a series of interesting case studies and that's
why we would like to ask you to join in and write articles for us about your
experience with QGIS in a certain project or as a common application at your
institution, universtity, authority, company, etc.

The first QGIS Case Study about "QGIS in the governmental FOSSGIS stack of the
Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland" was contributed by Horst D?ster. Thank you
very much Horst to be the first!

You find the article on the QGIS website under URL:
http://qgis.org/en/community/qgis-case-studies.html

If you also have an interesting story, you would like to contribute, please have
a closer look at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/index.php/QGIS_Case_Studies and write
to the community-team mailing list [1].

We want to keep everything easy, so the stories should follow a simple
structure. We suggest to write about 800 words including one or two screenshots.

Structure:

1. Title
2. Short Introduction with background of the company / institute / authority /
   university (length about 200 words)   
3. Story about your project/application and what QGIS is used for (length about
   400 words plus screenshots)   
4. Conclusion showing positive experiences/benefits using QGIS (length about 200
   words)

regards,

In principle yes. But at the moment the SO!GIS Layer plugin is not very
generic. SO!DATA, our selfmade Meta DB, is required for running the
plugin.

Very nice article!  The So!GIS Layer Metadata database plugin seems to
be a good interface for managing geodata within QGIS. Especially for
non-GIS users. Would Canton of Solothurn be interested in adding this
plugin (or a derivative) to the main QGIS repos?

I imagined this. However, the plugin could be a source of inspiration for
other, more general ones, so please make it available to the community, if
possible.
Thanks a lot.

Hi Tim.

Once copied, everything seems to go well.

P.S. I also updated to Qt 4.5.1, but the error does not seem to be  
related to Qt, because version 10262 shows no error at this point.

we almost finished the manual updates for 1.1 and it is awesome how many new
features we will provide in this new release. But for the documenters it was
quite some work to go through all commit logs and identify all important changes
that should be mentioned. I hope we found most of them, but to improve this, we
would be thankful, if you can help us finding the relevant features by simply
adding a small note to your SVN commit comment, as suggested above.

Otto et al.,

I very much like this idea. Some of my own thoughts:

Another possible set of tags: [NEW FEATURE], [BUG FIX], or [UPDATE].

That way the developer doesn't have to decide on their own if the change 
need to be added to the manual. Manual writers can simply decide if the 
NEW FEATURE needs to be added or not... I also think that NEW FEATURE is 
more intuitive for developers than MANUAL which is likely not something 
they are thinking about at the time...

Just my two cents,

Carson

Those are from spatialite, which needs libiconv on OSX.  I don't know  
why the cmake build stopped linking it, but I do have that in the  
Xcode project build.

[Manual] seems to me too broad term. On the other hand, is there any
need for [bug fix] tag? Usually it's clear from the commit message :-)
I would vote for [FEATURE] and [UPDATE]. But still I'm not sure what
should be considered as an update... (any thoughts of examples what is
and what is not an update?)

Anyway, it will probably need some time to get used to any tagging...
developers are lazy, otherwise they wouldn't have became developers
:-)

Message-ID: <e0730a570905091029r1b47d2aemc635fd62b527bc64@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am customising QuantumGIS that uses Qt's Qpainter to draw and paint...

I am trying to draw a polyline on the canvas that is coming as a update
through message queues..the draw is very fine...but in the polyline or
polygon objects that i get as an update also include an angle field that is
to be used for rotation of an object. The problem is that when i try to
rotate the line just before the polyline is drawn by the qpainter using
painter.rotate() method,the line is rotated fine but the position of the
line drawn changes..and it changes at every zoom and pan of the Qgis
canvas.. Before setting painter.rotate() i am saving the painter state and
after drawing- again restoring its state which i believe is analogous to
OpenGL's push/popMatrix functions. Does the Qpainter's save restore
functions work similar to push/popMatrix functions of opengl??

Any Ideas how rotation can be achieved??

here is a code snippet:

p->save();
  //p->rotate(45);
  p->scale( 1.0 / rasterScaleFactor, 1.0 / rasterScaleFactor );
  p->drawPolyline( pa );
  p->restore();

Help is appreciated. Thanks.

Hi Agustin/devs,
(bringing this to dev list)

before I saw your following message which says it's NOT a bug, I was 
looking at this stuff also. Looking at the graduatedsymbolrenderer 
(because I need this info for a python plugin), I found:
	
if ( value >= ( *it )->lowerValue().toDouble() &&
	value <= ( *it )->upperValue().toDouble() )
(it = symbollist iterator)

So devs,
isn't this missing the 'border-values'?
shouldn't it be that for example >=lowerValue() and <upperValue()
(so including the lower, en excluding the upper)?

But it's just a guess, maybe there is some info I'm missing...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks for your answer Martin. But I wasn't able to get any info from 
the painter after calling the renderFeature(..) method...

So what I did now (and is working :-) ): is actually copy the 
functionality of the symbolForFeature(feature) method to my plugin in 
python: after rendering a renderer holds a list of 'symbols' which not 
only hold the symbolic-info, but also the lower- and  upperborder (if 
availble). So given the value of a feature I can determine myself which 
symbol is used for it (just like the implementation of symbolForFeature.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OSGeo4W Windows version: SVG graphics in toolbar
 icons don't display
Message-ID: <44502.193.246.86.39.1242044607.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

I have the strange situation that when using SVG graphics as icons in the
Plugins toolbar, it only displays on ubuntu, not on the OSGeo4W trunk
version. I wonder if some library or setting is missing in the Windows
version?

I am using the following resource file:

-------
<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/plugins/usterfinder" >
        <file>UsterFinder.png</file>
        <file>UsterFinder.svg</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>
------

I then ran (on Linux):
pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py resources_rc.qrc

-------

in my python code I use the following:
self.action =
QAction(QIcon(":/plugins/usterfinder/UsterFinder.png"),"Uster-Finder",self.iface.mainWindow())

this works fine with the png version, but if I use the SVG version, it
only works on Ubuntu, not on Windows. Still have to try the Mac version
...

Any idea on why this fails on Windows? I successfully display SVG at other
places in Plugins, e.g. through a QSvgWidget() - this works fine, also on
Windows.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

from your mail it's not clear what are you actually doing. Are you
developing a custom map canvas item? Or are you doing some post-render
drawing to the rendered map image?

And how does the position of the line change when trying to rotate it?
If you're using rotation of painter, the rotation is done with center
at point [0,0] so that might be the reason why it changes position.

Hi Andreas,

maybe there are some qt plugins missing from the osgeo4w installation.
Look for a "plugins/imageformats" directory somewhere in the
installation. On my linux system with qt4.5 I have a plugin for
several image types: gif, ico, jpeg, mng, svg, tiff.

no there is no need for a [bug fix] tag, I think.

Probably with [UPDATE] Carson means anything that is not a new feature but
should be mentioned. Maybe something like icon changes or ?.

We should be keep it simple. We don't want developers to spend any (much) time
to think about what tag to use. If you are ok with [FEATURE] and [UPDATE] it
would be fine for us and very helpful! All we need is a simple hint we can grep
from the svn commit logs so we don't miss anything.

Hi Martin,

I checked the Windows installation and qsvg4.dll seems to be in this
directory:

C:\Programme\OSGeo4W\apps\QT4\plugins\imageformats

The following formats are present:
qgif4.dll
qico4.dll
qjpeg4.dll
qmng4.dll
qsvg4.dll
qtiff4.dll

As I said, the SVG rendering works fine when displayed in a QSvgWidget(),
but not in an icon.

I wonder if my problem is that the installation path is non-standard? The
standard location is at C:\OSGeo4W whereas my path is at
C:\Programme\OSGeo4W (my sysadmins wanted me to install it in the Programs
location)

Will further investigate if this is the problem ...

Thanks anyway,
Andreas

I'm a little bit confused about the latest QGIS release actions and

QGIS-1.1.0 has been released or not? The svn branches/Release-1_1_0

no commits to Release-1_1_0. 

Please let me know in which direction QGIS runs.

Hi Horst

The release that will appear soon is 1.1.0.
Usually there is a branch created shortly before release where only changes related to packaging are done (branches/Release-1_1_0). At this point in time, development continues in trunk, that's why the splash already shows 1.2.0.

Marco

Hi

Yes its as Marco describes and I can add that I held off announcing the 
release while the community team was updating the manual so that we 
could announce both the manual and the release at the same time. 
Announcements for 1.1 and 1.0.2 should go out some time today if no more 
gremlins get into the works...

Hi 
 
Yes its as Marco describes and I can add that I held off announcing the  
release while the community team was updating the manual so that we  
could announce both the manual and the release at the same time.  
Announcements for 1.1 and 1.0.2 should go out some time today if no more  
gremlins get into the works...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GRASS bugs commit
Message-ID: <340505ef0905130311x5e69e20as5cbd4af381dd3834@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am going to fix some GRASS related bugs. I was not contributing to
QGIS for a while so I want to ask you where I should commit the fixes.
Into 'trunk' I presume? Into some stable branches also?

BTW, can you please clarify (or point me to some place were it is
explained) how release branching is done?
I see Version-1_0 branch which I suppose was used to create
Release-1_0_0, Release-1_0_1 and Release-1_0_2?
Release-1_0_1 was created from Release-1_0_0 or from Version-1_0?
I don't see any Version-1_1 while Release-1_1_0 was created already.
Why Release-1_x_x are branches, not tags? A release must be unique, right?

Hi Radim

Nice to see you are back!

Bugfixes should go into trunk and also be backported to the stable branch (Version-1_0) if it is possible.

Afaik the release branches receive changes related to packaging and release process. After the release, those changes are merged back. Tim knows more about the release process, so maybe he could add/correct.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <713193417.42341242217050341.JavaMail.root@srsofaioi13477.ktso.ch>

I just installed QGIS-trunk -r10777 from svn. With ccmake I made the following settings: 
 
BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL: off 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: /usr/local/qgis_devel 
WITH_BINDINGS: on 
 
Compilation and installation process works fine. But when I start QGIS with  
 
/usr/local/qgis_devel/bin/qgis 
 
I get the following error message: 
 
ImportError: /usr/local/qgis/share/qgis/python/qgis/core.so:  
undefined symbol: _ZN16QgsDataSourceURI13setDataSourceERK7QStringS2_S2_S2_ 
 
I seems that QGIS points to the wrong directory for connecting the python bindings. The error path is  the path to a second QGIS 1.0.1 installation.  
 
I remember, that this error occours when two independent qgis installations exists and BINDINGS_GLOBAL_INSTALL is set ton on. 
 
What is the mistake??

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Announcing the releases of QGIS 1.0.2 (stable
 release) and QGIS 1.1.0 'Pan' (unstable release).
Message-ID: <4A0B2CE2.2080607@linfiniti.com>

We are very pleased to simultaneously announce the releases of QGIS 
1.0.2 (stable release) and QGIS 1.1.0 'Pan' (unstable release).

Our 1.0.x 'stable' release series are part of our effort to provide a 
stable, unchanging, long term supported environment. Each minor release 
in our stable series contains only bug fixes and no new features. For a 
list of bugs that were closed in the 1.0.2 release, please see the 1.0.2 
release milestone.

Our 'unstable' release series are provided to offer users a chance to 
try out new features as they make their way into the code base. We will 
not support these releases over a long term and they are aimed more for 
those who value new features over stability.

Binary and source code packages are available at 
http://www.qgis.org/en/download/binaries.html.

Along with the release of QGIS 1.1.0, the QGIS Community Team is also 
extremely pleased to announce the immediate availability of the QGIS 
Users' Guide version 1.1. The guide can be downloaded from 
http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html.

QGIS is a completely volunteer driven project, and is the work of a 
dedicated team of developers, documenters and supporters. We extend our 
thanks and gratitude for the  many, many hours people have contributed 
to make this release happen.

If you would like to make a donation or sponsor our project, please 
visit http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html . QGIS is Free software 
and you are under no obligation to do so.

Happy QGIS'ing!

Hi All

As we were in the release process Andreas posted about some issues with 
slow project loading. As promised, I would like to immediately put out a 
release of 1.0.3. If everyone agrees, I will wait till Saturday for 
folks to backport their fixes from trunk etc. into the 1.0 stable 
branch, and then go ahead and tag 1.0.3, call for packaging etc.

If you have any issues with that, please let me know.

Regards

Yes. Note that 1.0 is in feature freeze permenantly, so only bug fixes 
go in there.

Thats correct. Branches are made at point or release, or by developers 
who want to work in a sandbox. Note that svn doesnt treat branches and 
tags any differently like CVS does.

So if you are working in trunk, work here:

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/

And in the stable branch, work here:

https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Version-1_0

Hi Tim,

If it is only us requiring these fixes, you don't have to do the release.
However, others, using the stable 1.0 release might want to enjoy the
improvements as well and this might the 1.0.3 release.

We are currently using the unstable releases, since we are relying on
other improvements as well. We are aware of the issues with unstable
releases, but it seems to us currently the better route.

Having said this, we are more interested in 1.1 releases than the 1.0
releases.

Thanks,
Andreas

no, but I decided now to open the new wiki for the moment and hope we won't get
in trouble. Anybody who had a QGIS wiki account for the 'old' wiki can now
create a new account for the new wiki at http://www.qgis.org/wiki/ again.

Unfortunately the changes (still bugfixes only) dont seem to be just
few rows, so I'll submit them to trunk only. Later can be merged to
Version-1_0 when tested by users in trunk.

Hi,

I'm not sure what's happening here. Have you done the install from a
new build directory?
I mean if pyqgis links to a different installation, there might be
some rests of the old configuration that were somehow picked up by the
bindings. If that's the case, I would recommend to do a clean build.

Good question really - we need to get some decent useage stats stuff on 
the go. A lot of people in enterprise situations seemed to be wanting a 
more stable platform so at least with 1.0.x we can offer that - and free 
ourselves up to be a bit adventurous with trunk...

perhaps not *is*, but certainly it *will*... if the only things that go

Sure that stability of 1.0.x branch will improve.
But my impression is that unstable branch gets even more fixes and
polishing. Some fixes are not backported to 1.0 because they contain
necessary changes in GUI or the backport isn't trivial, e.g. recent
grass fixes. I would welcome a poll on qgis website asking what
version users prefer...

JEF> I wonder who actually is interested in 1.0.

not me ;)

I'd vote for keeping one version (1.1), and think that the division happened
little bit too early. Most of the people in enterprise situations (afaik) with
whom we're working are geeks anyway (yet).

I'd also support more extensive discussion before making such decisions
(including wider calls for community). Forum and blog are not used as
effectively for this as they could be.

Good idea. I think reinstating polls on the website is a good idea. It
would be great also to recover old ones, still interesting also for
historical purposes.
All the best.

Personally I think we should continue with two branches.

a) it makes outsiders to the project see that we care about stability -
in the past a lot of people complained about new features coming out all
the time and no one taking care of just bug fixing and stabilising one
version. I believe Paolo was one who was vocal about this too. Others
offlist have also expressed a desire to have 'an unmoving long term
maintained QGIS that they can provide support services around'.

b) it doesn't take that much effort to maintain it

c) It establishes a good working practice / culture that we can be used
to as our project matures

c) sooner or later someone will commit something in trunk that breaks
all kinds of stuff and at least we will be able to say 'its unstable
version, if you care about stability use the stable release'

and lastly

d) when we get to a point where we want to do a long interval between
unstable releases e.g. because of major refactoring, we still will have
a version that we can easily keep current with minor fixes


So for me getting rid of the stable branch is a -1 vote.

Tim

Message-ID: <007501c9d4f4$cd702f80$6401a8c0@cs41617>

Hi:
        I was wondering if there is anyone out there who has done much work
on a real-time GPS plugin for QGIS? I need one for a project that I am
working on. I couldn't find one so I started work on developing the
connection in python. So far I have written enough of a class to open a
connection and to get the NMEA 0183 serial output and derive the positions.

    Before I go any further I wanted to check to see if there is anyone out
there who has done this yet who is planning to share it with the world ;-) .

thanks,
            Bob Bruce,

I have seen discussion on this topic, off and on, over the last few  
years, but I don't think anyone has done this. You might search the  
archives. I would request that you contribute your plugin if you  
continue in its development. This would be a useful tool for many.

Cheers,
John

Hi list,

I'm here again with my problem with WMS/WFS connections.
I've already installed  "qgis (1.1.0-5~jaunty3) jaunty" on my Ubuntu 9.04
from the url https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/unstable, because I've got
the same problem in the stable release 1.0.1

On clicking thhe WMS connections button I have this message in the bash:

Warning: QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for

Segmentation fault

On clicking thhe WFS connections button I have this message in the bash:

Warning: Object::connect: No such slot QgsWFSPlugin::setCurrentTheme(

I'm not a developer, I'm just an end user.
any idea??

Hi, 
I gave a try to the above wfs service, and I cannot replicate your
problem.

The only error I have when I try to add a layer is "the layer in not a
valid layer and cannot be added to the map".

qgis 1.1.0 on ubuntu 8.10

Hi Michele

This problem happens on some computers, but I don't know the reason.

I had a training two months ago with five participants, all with ubuntu 8.10, qgis packages installed and identical configuration. The problem you described happened on three of them, but not on the other two (and also not on my laptop). I did a bit of research with the debugger and compiled Qt from source. My impression was that the problem even comes from a level below Qt.

Does someone know more about it or can do some research about it? As it does not happen on one of my computers, I cannot make further examinations.

Regards,
Marco

So, just to clarify the plan, future releases of 1.1 unstable will  
have revision version numbers?  ie 1.1.1, 1.1.2,...

And the next stable version would be 1.2?

Are you defining some alternating stable/dev version number system,  
like GRASS does?  ie major.even = stable, major.odd = dev.

I was under the impression that the next unstable release would be 1.2
aka bugfixes for unstable are always in the trunk. While 1.0.3 is the
next stable as those bugfixes when possible are simply applied to the
stable version.

In fact the 1.1 branch is only a branch for packaging reasons.

Then again this is my thinking from an outside view,

I think the best way to investigate about this bug is recompile both qt
and qgis with debugging symbols and then run qgis from gdb.
Reproducing the problem gdb should give us more info about the problem.

No as Alex mentioned the will be 1.x > 0.x  releases.

>>

We will aim for 2.0 to be the next stable release in a year or so time,
at which point we will discontinue maintenance of 1.0.x and support
2.0.x for a longer period of time.

>>

Before 1.0 release we used to have a somewhat arbitrary numbering
scheme. In answer to requests from debian folks and others we switched
to the major.minor.bugfix numbering scheme:

"In principle, in subsequent releases, the major number is increased
when there are significant jumps in functionality, the minor number is
incremented when only minor features or significant fixes have been
added, and the revision number is incremented when minor bugs are fixed.
A typical product might use the numbers 0.9 (for beta software), 0.9.1,
0.9.2, 0.9.3, 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, 1.1.1, 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1,
2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2, etc. Developers have at times jumped (for example)
from version 5.0 to 5.5 to indicate that significant features have been
added, but not enough to warrant incrementing the major version number,
though this is improper."

(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)


The intention is that 1.x releases will remain API (but not ABI)
backwards compatible and that 2.0 will be API breaking.

I think its better to treat all 1.x >0 releases as unstable and just
maintain 1.0.x until 2.0 comes out. Many people I am dealing with are
building training materials etc that rely on the GUI remaining the same
- - they are less interested in new features than they are having
something with consistent appearance and functionality. I know for us
developers 1.0 already seems like old news, but when you are building
training materials around the application its much easier if the UI
doesn't change every few months event if the feature set doesnt grow as
quickly.


Best regards

Tim

Message-ID: <200905161147.08775.borysiasty@aster.pl>

Hi,
I've realized the update_ts_files.sh script collects strings coming from all the 
project directories, in particular from the build directory. There are often a 
lot of obsolete files there, so updating the .ts files without clearing the 
build directory makes a mess in translations. Would it be enough if the script 
collected only files from the 'src' and 'python' directiories? I mean to replace 
the line 26: 

qmake -project -o qgis_ts.pro

with:

qmake -project -o qgis_ts.pro -nopwd src python i18n

For me it seems to work ok, but I'm asking because don't want to miss something 
important...

After hearing someone talk about copying map extents to the clipboard
on #qgis the other day, I figured I'd make a plugin to do it. Of
course it expanded to doing a bit more, like copying the project file
path and the current map layers info. It's called 'CopyPasta', it
should be in my repo now, and the docs are here:

http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Qgis/Plugins/Documentation/copypasta/

Note it is barely tested - please file bug reps, suggestions etc to

Hi,

we changed to short URLs to the qgis wiki. This means the "index.php" in the

necessary.

For example - the bugfixing site on the wiki moved from

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/index.php/Bugs => http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Bugs

and so on. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi Borys

Right, it makes sense to only consider strings from src and python directory.

Btw, when compiling current trunk, I get the following error message. Is this a related problem?

Hi!

There has something changed between Qt 4.3 and Qt 4.5 - and it seems 
that always the copyright sign is making some problems ..
I still dont know where exactly the problem lies and what causes it ..
maybe the linguist version of qt4.5?

someone found a solution?

Nobody objects, so I've commited the change.

For me (Qt 4.4) it works without any error.

It's always mysterious for me that various lupdates (and lreleases) work in very 
different ways. For example, some of them add lines with origins of source 
strings while other don't. The coding of the copyright mark may be also 
different. I can't find any way to customize that behaviour.

Hi Bob,

Quantum Navigator never got proper GPS integration, it uses just a GPS
simulator. In our qgis-mapper project we're developing a plugin that
(apart from other functionality like recording audio and video) reads
real-time GPS data - either directly from a serial port or from a file
or using gpsd.

You can find the plugin here:
https://urtax.ms.mff.cuni.cz/qgis-mapper/trac/browser/trunk/sandbox/gatherplugin

The repository is not available for public, you would need to download
the files manaully. It's still in development, so expect problems of
any kind :-) ... although the gps support is in quite good shape.

Hi,

Yes.  This is perfectly fine, so long as you comply with the license
conditions:

- Desktop only application
- Support ECWP
- Limit compression to 500mb (uncompressed input size)


Please let me know how you get on?  I keep a list of all ECW-supported
applications :)

Thanks,


Richard

Dear Richard,
thanks for your reply. We are aware of the technical limitations of ECW
SDK, but we are still uncertain about the legal side of the problem. Can
we compile QGIS with ECW support, using Erdas SDK, and redistribute
freely the resulting package?
This will, in our view, increase both the attractiveness of QGIS to
professional GIS users and the popularity of ECW as a format.
Thanking you in advance.
All the best.

Hi

I have just updated to r10799 and I notice that a comma is being used
instead of a point as the decimal separator. See for example: Edit ->
Options -> Digitizing -> Snapping scroll boxes. Qgis has correctly
detected my system locale as en_ZA.

As I remember this worked correctly in earlier revisions (point used
instead of a comma), but I notice that en_ZA (or en_GB) is not listed
amongst the options to override the system locale. Do I need to create
a translation for en_ZA?

Regards

Ok we are good there...

Oh do we support this ECWP? I've never tried and we will need to
investigate further.

I believe gdal already restricts compression to 500mb (and even that is
not exposed in QGIS).

I'll put out a new package if we meet all the criteria.

Thanks for chasing up on this.

Message-ID: <200905200801.52503.stephan.holl@intevation.de>

Dear QGIS-devs,

currently I am using QGIS 1.0.1 from the OSGeo4W-packagefor a beginner cource. 
I did not try the points with the recent releases of QGIS.

Some oddities were found:
* Transparent WMS-layers. The WMS-layers are not transparent, even if I force   
  TRANSPARENT=true within the Connection-parameter-URL. With QGIS 1.0.0 it was
  possible though (both with PNG-formats).
* Using *.qml-files with saved styles work perfectly with shapefiles. If I 
  place the saved *.qml-file with the identical name as the shapefile it gets 
  picked up as soon as I load the shapefile. Where do I need to put 
  the *.qml-file for a PostGIS-layer?
* Are the linetypes for classifying a boundary of a polygon extendable? The 
  filling-pattern are extendable though.
* When I accidently delete the buttonbar of the printcomposer I cannot enable 
  it again unless I restart the complete project again. Starting the 
  printcomposer does not solve the problem.
* Projected shapefiles (with .prj-file) do not show the correct projection 
  inside the metadata tab within the properties-dialog. 

If you feel that some points above mentioned are bugs I am happy to create a 
trac-ticket soon.

TIA for your comments.

Best regards

This is a bug.

Transparent=True in WMS only refers to background transparency (e.g. if you have a line layer, the lines will not be transparent, only the areas not covered by lines).
I think that the WMS transparency in the raster properties dialog is fixed in newer versions. Please try with 1.2 and fill a bug if the problem still persists.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all,

I was testing QGISes a bit for a while
Now I am at 1.1.0 Pan at winxp, osgeo4w installer

I can not find detailed specification of what each of fTOOLS do and how
but I think that Delaunay triangulation is cheating a bit on a point number:

It creates an attribute table with 3 columns of point numbers,
it seems that it takes te point number from ID from input point vector layer
but I see that this number is increased by one everytime (attached
please find a png)
Is it a known issue?

I am happy to see QGIS growing!
Milena

Hi list

Speaking about delaynay triangulation, voronoi diagram, etc... I am
looking for a way to create concave (and not convex) hull of a set of
points.  I have made several google searches, and what I need seems to
be the implementation of alpha shapes. Basically, you define a
parameters to tell how much you want the final polygone to be concave.

Ok, I am trying to explain (english english) : I think when a delaynay
triangulation is made for a set of points, we are very close to be
able to male a concave hull, no ?

What do you think ?

Hi Carson,

more fun with great tools and
I have a problem with Simplify geometries:
when I try to use it for line layer I get python error (unfortunatelly
I am not able to paste the message - why, when I am able to copy? will
never understand computers ;)

What I see there when I read, and I don't like, is:

'in do.Geometry.py, line 577, in extractAsSimple
simple = self.simlifyLine
AttributeError: simlifyLine'

I don't know abut programming but maybe *p* letter is missing there?
(according to 'success = self.simplify_geometry' few lines above)

If it is something else I will be happy to send a printscreen of the
whole message.

Thanks,

Technically the plain delaunay will be a *convex* hull. But you can 
clearly see that with a little bit of work you can also generate a 
concave polygon, in fact:/ Basic alpha shapes/ are based on the Delaunay 
triangulation.

I don't know of any specific algorithms, but I imagine it wouldn't be 
too hard to come up with something if you were so inclined....

Yes this is a typo, I will fix this in svn, but if you want it to work 
right away you will need to add the p manually ;-)

It would be great if Alpha Shapes (a kind of concave hull) can be added to fTools.  Somewhere I have a paper that describe the algorithm fully.  So, I did a quick search and found this:  http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/546/lectures/lecture22.pdf

OK, please find it here: http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1711 (I have
taken the liberty to assign it to you)

Yes, that is exactly what we needed (and I knew it was working once in
an earlier release).

The transparency inside the raster dialog works as expected, but the
WMS-image did not come as a transparent PNG.
However, I tried with trunk (r10835) and it worked (on linux though).

Any other ideas on the other topics I posted? Especially the
*.qml-thingy I am interested to get solved/answered.

TIA

Best

All you need seems to be here:

In particular:

http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.4/doc_html/cgal_manual/packages.html#Part:TriangulationsAndDelaunayTriangulations

Most of the code is licensed under the QPL:

http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qpl.html

a quick glance does not reveal any immediate problems with that for QGIS
development.

It would be really great to see some of CGAL's computational geometry
tools in a QGIS plug-in!

QML files are only for file based layers.  The defaults for other layers are
stored to the qgis.qmldb SQLite database in the .qgis directory
(%USERPROFILE%\.qgis on Windows and ~/.qgis on *x).

When a non file based layer qgis tries to load the defaults from the above
file, a file named like the project, but ending on .qmldb or the qgis.qmldb in
the qgis resources directory.

There's no UI to transfer the settings from the user's qgis.qmldb into the
project or resources database.

Ah, thanks for the clarifications.

ok, thank you very much.

Ok, is is sufficient to create a qgis.qmldb and copy it to the global
ressources-folder? Would it be picked up as the fallback (for a global
installation)?

Best regards

Dear devs, 

when using QGIS 1.0.1 on Win32 the commandline-parameters of QGIS are
ignored.

Is this a bug or a feature? it would be nice to have this available for
starting qgis from other applications (and pass the extent to zoom to a
specific point).


Thanks for any help/suggestion

Not entirely correct.  You can pass file arguments, but that's it.
On Windows there is not getopt_long.

Yes.

BTW the uri of the data source is used as key to the qmldb.  That means that if
you add a layer from the same table, but with a changed parameters (ie.
different credentials, sslmode or anything else) the defaults won't be found.

Sure, I can pass filenames of shapefiles, right.

Anyway, thanks for clarification. Too bad.

HI list,

I am having quite a bit of trouble building the latest trunk due to 
several translation files. Is there a way to get around this problem? Do 
I have to upgrade my version of Qt?

This is really bugging me, and simply removing the files that don't get 
generated properly is obviously not a real solution... any ideas?

Actually the issue is with QT 4.5 a quick hack to keep working is to
remove all instances of the degree symbol and copyright symbol from all
of the .ts files. Of course don't commit this back.

We'll have to keep searching the QT changelogs to figure out why these
symbols are causing issues now.


Tested thanks to some folk at WhereCamp 09,

Why not?  That doesn't do any harm - I fixed that twice in r10600 and r10257
and now the problem is back. :(

I think that only happens when updates from translators are commited.  Can
anyone confirm that is doesn't happen, when update_ts_files.sh is run?
That would also explain why this only affects a few and not all translation
files .

I don't know what translators use to update the ts files, but these tools
obviously don't care to only change things between <translation> and
</translation>.

E.g. the version and encoding attribute is removed or changed from the ?xml
tag, the language attribute from ts tag.

Removing encoding attribute might interfere with the degree and copyright
symbol and removing the language attribute breaks numerus forms.

IMHO translators should only change translations and not touch anything else.

Simply a suggestion because it was a hack, I wasn't sure that removing
the symbols is the proper fix since I didn't open the translations to
see the whole story.

I'm starting to think the translator instructions and tools aren't clear
enough. http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/TranslatorsCorner
As soon as the new wiki is ready, I'll try to poke around the scripts
and update the instructions.

For my plugin, it didn't seem that complex
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/qgismetaedit/wiki/Translations

Are people not using Qt 4 Linguist, it seems like that's the only way to
ensure we don't break anything.

Hi guys, Tim & Dr.Marco 

I was tried to display real-time data in my mapcanvas. In my mapcanvas, i
have 4 layer, but i juz want to refresh 1 layer only(this layer retrieve
data from PostGis) from the mapcanvas without refreshing all layer in the
mapcanvas. I already searching from this forum and Google it, and the result
is i should use QgsMapCanvasItem that have that capabilities to rendering
single layer without refreshing mapcanvas. But, i don't know how to
implement it in my application. I'm using sample application from Mr.Tim
Sutton, it is a great tutorial for a beginner like me, and i think its
better to include the code in here. This is what i already done: 


//Setting my layer 

mpMapCanvas= new QgsMapCanvas(0, 0); 
  mpMapCanvas->enableAntiAliasing(true); 
  mpMapCanvas->useImageToRender(true); 
  mpMapCanvas->setCanvasColor(QColor(255, 255, 255)); 
  mpMapCanvas->freeze(false); 
  mpMapCanvas->setVisible(true); 

  QString myLayerPathNegeri         = LAYERPATH() + "klkv_state.shp"; 
  QString myLayerBaseNameNegeri     = "klkv_state"; 
  QString myProviderName            = "ogr"; 

  QString myLayerPathDistrict         = LAYERPATH() + "klkv_district.shp"; 
  QString myLayerBaseNameDistrict     = "klkv_district"; 

  QString myLayerPathMukim         = LAYERPATH() + "klkv_mukim.shp"; 
  QString myLayerBaseNameMukim     = "klkv_mukim"; 

QString myLayerPathPoi         = "location_poi"; 
  QString myLayerBaseNamePoi     = "location_poi"; 

QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerNegeri = new QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPathNegeri,
myLayerBaseNameNegeri, myProviderName); 

  QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerDistrict = new
QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPathDistrict, myLayerBaseNameDistrict,
myProviderName); 

  QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerMukim = new QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPathMukim,
myLayerBaseNameMukim, myProviderName); 

  QgsVectorLayer * mypLayerPoi = new
QgsVectorLayer(POSTGIS_LAYER_SETUP_INCIDENT_POI_FUNC(), myLayerBaseNamePoi,
"postgres"); 


QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRendererNegeri = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypLayerNegeri->geometryType()); 
  QList<QgsMapCanvasLayer> myLayerSet; 
  mypLayerNegeri->setRenderer(mypRendererNegeri); 

  QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRendererDistrict = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypLayerDistrict->geometryType()); 
  mypLayerDistrict->setRenderer(mypRendererDistrict); 

  QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRendererMukim = new

  mypLayerMukim->setRenderer(mypRendererMukim); 


QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRendererPoi = new

  mypLayerPoi->setRenderer(mypRendererPoi);

  QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(mypLayerDistrict, TRUE); 
  QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(mypLayerMukim, TRUE); 
QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance()->addMapLayer(mypLayerPoi, TRUE); 

myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(mypLayerPoi)); 
myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(mypLayerMukim)); 
  myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(mypLayerDistrict)); 
  myLayerSet.append(QgsMapCanvasLayer(mypLayerNegeri)); 

mpMapCanvas->setLayerSet(myLayerSet); 


//I make a Qtimer to check if any update position for mypLayerPoi from
updatingLocationPoiLayer() function 

QTimer *timerPoiRenderer = new QTimer(this); 
  connect(timerPoiRenderer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this,
SLOT(updatingLocationPoiLayer())); 
  timerPoiRenderer->start(10 * 1000);// 10 seconds 


//this is how i tried to using QgsMapCanvasItem, sorry for the code because
i am beginner for this QGis, so i juz try to play-around with the
QgsMapCanvasItem code . 

void MyMain::updatingLocationPoiLayer() 
{ 

  QGraphicsScene *mScene = new QGraphicsScene(); 
  QgsMapCanvasMap* mMap = new QgsMapCanvasMap(mpMapCanvas); 
  mScene->addItem( mMap ); 
  mScene->update(); 
  QList<QGraphicsItem*> list = mScene->items(); 
  QList<QGraphicsItem*>::iterator it = list.begin(); 

  while ( it != list.end() ){ 
          QgsMapCanvasItem* item = dynamic_cast<QgsMapCanvasItem*>( *it ); 

          if(item){ 
                  item->updatePosition(); 
                  QMessageBox::information( this, tr( "TEST" ), tr( "Update
rendering" ) ); 
          }else{ 
//it will goes here. 
                  QMessageBox::information( this, tr( "TEST" ), tr( "NOT
Update rendering" ) ); 
          } 

          it++; 
  } 
} 

from my reading,what i understand is i should use
QgsMapCanvasItem::updatePosition() to make my mapcanvas look like real-time.
Is it true? And i really hope you guys can teach me about how to implement
it in my code. 


Thanks in advance, 
Bonar

Hi Bonar

QGIS renders the map into one image canvas item (QgsMapCanvasMap). Currently, it is not possible to refresh only one layer in this item. 
However, it is possible to render the content of the three layers that stay constant into a QgsMapCanvasMap (as you do now with all the four layers). For the layer that changes you could create a new canvas item (as a new subclass of QgsMapCanvasItem). In this subclass you need to create a QgsVectorLayer configured with your database instance . Then you could implement the paint method, there query all the features inside the view extent, use the transformation methods of QgsMapCanvasItem  (toCanvasCoordinates()) and finally use QPainter to draw the objects as you want. Important is that the new item has the same size as the mapcanvas and also a transparent background such that you may see the content of the other three background layers.

If then something in the datasource changes, you update your item class and only the item with one layer is repainted. The background with the three other layers stays the same.


Regards,
Marco

                  item->updatePosition(); 
                  QMessageBox::information( this, tr( "TEST" ), tr( "Update
rendering" ) ); 
          }else{ 
//it will goes here. 
                  QMessageBox::information( this, tr( "TEST" ), tr( "NOT
Update rendering" ) ); 
          } 

          it++; 
  } 
} 

from my reading,what i understand is i should use
QgsMapCanvasItem::updatePosition() to make my mapcanvas look like real-time.
Is it true? And i really hope you guys can teach me about how to implement
it in my code. 


Thanks in advance, 
Bonar

?? This is a patch wich allow to use selected features from layer in
some geoprocessing tools (Convex hull(s), Buffers,

use Basic statistics tool only for selected features
and add possibility to get statistics on text fields(minimum and

Not really the result of praying.

Any plans that the qgis binaries will be built using
the gdal-mrsid library?

I have updated to r10854 and now the localisation works as expected.
It's also nice to see the dialogues appearing in Qt Linguist. Many
thanks to the responsible dev.

I notice that the decimal separator localisation is only implemented
in part. E.g the map window status bar and the attribute table use a
dot, but the Edit -> Options and Layer Properties dialogues use a
comma.

Message-ID: <5b1890a50905281633p628c5a55nc60a803a6cee5aff@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Developers,

playing with QGIS I saved a WFS layer to shapefile and noticed that
not all the features are present on the new shp layer.
I was using http://webservices.ionicsoft.com/unData/wfs/UN , layer
COUNTRY, saved it to country1.shp, as shown on attached printscreen.

I have no idea if that is WFS itself or the plugin problem, but
thought you might be interested :)
Made 3 tries, also loaded WMS layer again and the result was the same,
lit. the same features were missing.

Hi,
it happens also if the source is a postgis layer, I know because I
noticed the same behavior while setting up a wfs server with sources
of different types. But it happens also with other desktop clients but
not always (sometimes they show correctly all the features where qgis
don't)... so I'm not sure is a qgis problem.
If someone want investigate further I can provide a wfs sever address
and source data in shp format.

I've added a new ppa that depends on the ubuntugis ppa and copied the source
packages across.  The QGIS available there were build with GDAL 1.6 from
ubuntugis and should therefore work with MrSid files, if you have the
appropriated GDAL plugins installed:

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/jef-norbit/qgis-unstable-ubuntugis-jef/ubuntu jaunty main

If you can verify that they are working, we should probably copy QGIS into the
ubuntugis ppa (for which I would need to be reactivated) - or into a new qgis
ppa.

Hi Milena

This is fixed now in recent commits.
The problem was that those features had missing attributes, but the shapefile export rejects attributes with missing types. So now the wfs provider detects those cases and inserts empty strings for missing attribute values.

Marco
