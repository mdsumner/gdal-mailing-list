Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsMapCanvasItem and mouse events -- Python
Message-ID: <eb2cc3420911010200n5922ad0cte7813dfe97d7acf6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

It seems my previous mail didn't make it to the list with the text... weird.

Let me try again.

I am trying to subclass QgsMapCanvasItem so as do display items on top
of the maps.

I would like those items to react to mouse events.

I have implemented the handles for the mouse events as the Qt API
suggests, but my items do not seem to receive any events. The
isUnderMouse method returns coherent results when run from the python
console.

The source file for my geographicitems is included.

Thanks for your help.

Hello, 
? I have installed cmake, read some documentation, checked out the latest timtut1 project and 
run cmake, then the Microsoft VS 2008 C++ compiler.
(This is like using a sledge hammer to crack a peanut ;))
?
With eboth Qgis installers I get an error at link time: the linker complains as follows

C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\bin\qgis_core.dll : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file: cannot read at 0x2F0

(About the same mistake occurs when I use the osgeo release.)
?
By the way the non-osgeo release does not have the includes for GEOS and GDAL 
and the names of the libraries for geos and gdal are not the ones that Cmake is looking for.
?
Maybe I should be using a "development library"??
Maybe I should download a more recent (than 1.0.2 Kore) installer?
Yours truly
Henri
?
?

OK. You need to build it using CMake. Standard procedure should be
(guessing a little because I'm a linux user):

Install osgeo4w into the standard location (c:\osgeo4w) including all
developer libs
Use your system properties to export the LIB_DIR environment var to
point to c:\osgeo4w
enter the tut dir
mkdir build
cd build
cmakesetup ..
configure (c)
generate (g)
nmake

Windows gurus please chip in where I have gone wrong above...


> As for the term div lib, I dont know what you mean. I am handicapped by the fact that I have been out of C & C++ programming for over a decade until a week ago :(.

Sorry that was a typo, I meant dev (ie developer) libs.

I just made some small tweaks to tuts 1-4 so please update from svn
when you get the chance.

Regards

Tim

Hi all.
Installing on a fresh debian testing machine, I get an error during

Any hint? I'm now travelling[0], and remaining without QGIS is a shame :)

Hello,
?I tried your suggestion and?now link works, and then I?made cmake generation more verbose, and noticed it's what I?should have been doing all along.
? Unfortunately I?still have a problem qgis_core.dll cannot be found, yet I modified the path to
search in the directory where qgis_core.dll must lie, and also the place where geos_c.dll 
and gdal16.dll must lie.
?
The program begins to run and then I have a runtime error!
program ...\timtut1.exe
file: global::qglobal.cpp
line 2030
?
QWidget: Must construct a Qapplication before a QPaint device.
?
?
Is this due to an untested ?last minute tweak of the sample code?
I have not touched the sample code myself!!
?

I tested tuts 1-5 on linux last night and all were working ok. I
havent tested on windows in a loong time. Perhaps you can step through
with the debugger and see where it runs off the rails?

? Thanks to Jurgen I learned about import Libs (I'm a C++ newbie)
??A modification of Path fixes up the problem of finding the dll's and 
comparing the old version of the source file with the new version shows no difference.
So, I wonder if the fact that I am using Qt 4.5 (rather than 4.3) explains the problem

Hello,
?I tried your suggestion and?now link works, and then I?made cmake generation more verbose, and noticed it's what I?should have been doing all along.
? Unfortunately I?still have a problem qgis_core.dll cannot be found, yet I modified the path to
search in the directory where qgis_core.dll must lie, and also the place where geos_c.dll 
and gdal16.dll must lie.
?
The program begins to run and then I have a runtime error!
program ...\timtut1.exe
file: global::qglobal.cpp
line 2030
?
QWidget: Must construct a Qapplication before a QPaint device.
?
?
Is this due to an untested ?last minute tweak of the sample code?
I have not touched the sample code myself!!
?

Link with the .lib not with the .dll.

Try removing the QWidget include in main. But probably  you need to
step through with the debugger to see what is really going on.

BTW I wanted to apologise for my previous 'dont email me privately
only' message - my cell phone mail client showed me as the only
recipient but looking at my gmail client I see you had indeed sent
your reply to the list.

Hi Tim.

Thanks for your answer.

The renderComplete signal works perfectly with the code I sent, and my
items get refreshed correctly after the canvas is rendered. The SLOT
macro is not needed for the destination of the signal (but I don't
really know the details of PyQT...)

My problem is about the mouse events. According to the QGraphicsItem
API documentation, if I override the mousePressEvent and
mouseReleaseEvent methods, my objects should get the corresponding
events without further settings... but they don't.

Thanks for the help.
Florian

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Shapely Python package
Message-ID: <22032389.465201257118267300.JavaMail.www@wwinf4621>

Hi all,

i built some python plugins before but i have only few knowledge about how does it work.
I would like to know if i could use the Shapely Python package within QGis?

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely
http://gispython.org/shapely/manual.html

I would like to write a plugin with more selection features than now (contains, equals, intersects...).
The "selection by location" tool in fTools seems to be great but i can't use it because of a bug...

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1669

Thanks for your help,

Guillaume

Yes certainly. In fact, I think there are already some python plugins 
that use this library.

Yes, I am aware of this bug, and it will be fixed during the developers 
meeting next week. Apologies for not having gotten to this sooner :-( I 
am also planning on implementing additional overlay constraints (as you 
have mentioned above), and another developer has provided a patch to add 
additional selection constraints.

If you would like to contribute additional selection tools, I would 
encourage you to use the QGIS API to do so, as this means a) fewer 
dependencies for users, and b) more direct access to the layers on the 
map canvas (for selecting features etc). Having said that, if you are 
willing to do some coding, perhaps you would like to contribute to the 
current implementation (fTools) to help improve it rather than creating 
a new one?

Regards,

Carson

Hi Florian,

you should use canvasPressEvent, canvasReleaseEvent and
canvasMoveEvent functions to track mouse cursor on map canvas.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Which compiler should I use to build example
	code?
Message-ID: <264866.90250.qm@web110805.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

I can use my visual C++ environment to see this:
The message is due to a test 

if (!qApp) {
        qFatal("QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice");
        return;
inside a call to the constructor QWidgetPrivate::QWidgetPrivate(int version). If right mouse-click and I ask for the definition of qApp I get a message saying "resolve ambiguity:" and gives me a choice between
src\corelib\kernel\qcoreapplication.h
and
src\gui\kernel\qapplication.h
(am I right to suspect that this ambiguity is not good?)
anyway the call to QWidgetPrivate::QWidgetPrivate(int version) is inside
a call to
QDesktopWidgetPrivate::QDesktopWidgetPrivate()
inside a call to
QDesktopWidget::QDesktopWidget()
inside a call to
QApplication::desktop()
inside a call to
QGraphicsView::sizeHint()
inside a call to
QWidgetPrivate::adjustedSize()
inside a call to
QWidget::adjustSize()
inside a call to
QWidget::setVisible(bool visible)
inside the call of mypMapCanvas->setVisible(true); in the main

Hope this helps

Hi

That's a good idea.
I will implement the canvas events for now...

...but I would really like to understand why those events are not delivered
to my objects. I think they should, and although it is not a big problem, I
wouldn't have to rewrite the tests needed to handle the canvasEvent... The
QGraphicsView should take care of this for me and send the event
automatically to the right objects.

Thanks.
Florian

Hi List,
I am trying to building QGIS in windows.
I want to add a new plugin. Shall I take the recent QGIS.exe or QGIS Source
code.
If I need to work with QGIS Source code,  could you please tell me how to
download the QGIS Source from SVN.
I am  facing problems to build the QGIS in windows.
Please tell the easy way to create a new plugin.
How it will create dll file.Give your sourcecode for compilation.

Thanking you in advance,

A few questions:
  Are you familiar with Qt programming?
  Do you want to write your plugin in C++ or Python?
  Have you read the  coding and compilation guide here:
http://www.qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html
Are you using Microsoft Visual C++?
Do you know how to use CMake?

Hi all,

the plugin is really cool, what about placing it in trunk, so it will be
available for everyone out of the box?

cheers

Hi Jeevan,
  I am perhaps more a newbie than you. In the coming weeks I will hopefully be able to write my own. With the coming hackfest the QGis community will probably be very busy.
Now you havent answered my question about Qt. Are you reasonably familiar with that?

Hi all.
I'll arrive at the airport at 10:20 pm, the 5th, and I'll go to the hotel
Gersthof. In case someone is around there, we can meet at the airport,
otherwise see you in the morning of the 6th.
All the best.

I think the default implementation of mouse*Event() functions in
QGraphicsView automatically propagates these events to the items. In
QGIS we use our own implementation of these functions so the events
are propagated to current map tool instead of canvas items.

  This tutorial looks very helpful indeed.
  Have you managed to get the first application that Tim Sutton described in his tutorials? It uses the QGis libraries to make a little Widget which loads a layer of points.

Message-ID: <628513.36458.qm@web110809.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
  Since I cant get the first tutorial application (timtut1.exe) to work for
Windows I'm trying to see if I can make it work on Ubuntu.
So I installed Ubuntu Karmic Koala last night. It's been out since the 29th of October, if I remember rightly.
When I go to look for the Ubuntu package on 
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/stable
I see that Karmic Koala (the latest Ubuntu) is not yet taken into account.
Can I use the Jaunty package?

Henri

9.10 is there as the default; you'll see it reads:

"You can update your system with unsupported packages from this
untrusted PPA by adding ppa:qgis/stable to your system's Software
Sources. "

The it says:

"Not using Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic)?"

So click there if you're not using Karmic, otherwise, read the first sentence.

That's how I understand it at least...

Cheers, Joseph

Hi Henri,

I thin you were right with your original email - Karmic releases don't
seem to be there.

PPAs are "Private Package Archives" - basically software that isn't in
the main Ubuntu repositories, Usually this represents development
releases, or software otherwise not suited to being distributed with
Ubuntu.

In Ubuntu you can click System - Administration - Software Sources

Enter your password when prompted

Click the Other Software tab and hit the Add... button.

Paste in:

ppa:qgis/stable

And click Add Source. Your PC will then download a list of software
available to you - this now includes QGIS. From the terminal you could
run:

sudo apt-get install qgis

or you could look for the app in the new Ubuntu Software Centre.

However... When I did the above my souftware sources refreshed and I was told:

Failed to fetch
http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/stable/ubuntu/dists/karmic/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz
 404  Not Found

Looking at the server it seems that karmic is missing:

http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/stable/ubuntu/dists/

So yes, back to your original question, can the 9.04 sources be used
instead? Sorry, I don't know the answer to that one.

Cheers, Joseph

Thankyou,
  I added ppa:qgis/stable to the second page of the Synaptic Software source dialog box and it was automagically rewritten into 
http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/stable/ubuntu karmic main
(I dont know how, I only installed Ubuntu this morning)
then when I pressed on the Synaptic main window's reload button
things went smoothly for a while but after  loading about 54 files
I got an error message saying that not all index files could be loaded.
regards
Henri

Dear Arpita,

Can you please specify in detail, what you exactly wanted to do?
Is it that only identify tool is needed or you are thinking of customizing
more on it.

Bye and take care

That's right. If you need to interact with map canvas items, you can
simply create a map tool which will implement the functionality you
need.

I don't mind.

The plugin seems a little bit exotic for the core, but if that's what people
what than +1 from us.

I do not see it as very exotic - it certainly raises a lot of interest.
It would be good, however, to put in place a mechanism for an
user-installation of plugins (a common problem for several projects, the
only real solution I know is for R).
All the best.

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF62741CA9D806A@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

Dear Developers:

I am creating my own QGIS application. I have a PNG figure created with pylab's contourf function which uses a variable 2D matrix of values. My axes are already in lat-lon. I need this plot to be produced in a raster format that can be loaded (without using the georeferencing plugin) on top of a vector layer, without the frame, ticks, etc, that I get from pylab, just the plain image, I guess in GeoTIFF format...

I have seen around how to create a raster using GDAL and Python, but I want to use QGIS. How can I program this using the OSGeo4W package?

I use Python 2.5, numpy, matplotlib, etc... and OSGeo4W 1.0 Kore windows package in an XP machine.

Thanks a lot,
Angelica.

 R plugins for Unix with compiled C/C++ code require the user to have
the ability to build from source, so to copy that behaviour will
require the same for Qgis.

 Is there anything in this plugin that fundamentally stops it being
re-written in Python?

hmm, are we gonna rewrite everything written in C++ in Python?

I'm not against if someone is willing to port or rewrite, but I'm certain that
this won't be us, at least not in the near future.

In R user do compile, but in a completely automated fashion.
But yes, probably this is asking too much :)
Certainly yes, a plugin mechanism is not very useful if users cannot in
fact plug in anything... ;)
All the best.

Hi all.
In these days I was watching my qgis plugins toolbar growin' and
growin'... That's good, it means a lot of good code is being written,
but I was wondering if it's the time to consider organizing the
plugins under common task/feature/etc groups. It is a common structure
in many GIS desktops: GRASS groups them under different "namespaces"
(r.*, v.*, d.*, i.*, etc.), SAGA use data-types or kind of analysis
(i.e. "grid", "vector", "table", "terrain analysis" modules, etc.),
and so on for many others (MapWindows, or commercial solutions like
ArcGIS Desktop).
Wouldn't it be useful for QGis too? Has this been discussed?

bye,
giovanni

Nikos, I didn't notice your suggestion. Good to know that it's not an
isolated idea :)

My two cents.
In general I feel confortable with a nested model. We could provide a
first top-level grouping based on the qgis layer type the plugin
operates on, i.e. raster and vector. We can further subdivide them
into second-level generic groups like "import/export", "analysis",
etc. I would avoid groups like "terrain analysis" or "hydrology" at
this level, even if this is a common approach, and would let them
reside in lower levels... but I'm not sure whetrer it makes sense or
it's just a subjective feeling.

+ some more general suggestions:

- no more than 2 levels - if required then (max.) 3 levels
- icons can be smaller (or at least have the option between e.g.: small,
medium, large)
- use the empty space on the very bottom panel (left from coordinate:,
scale:, [box]Render, CRS status button). Maybe merge with the very top
panel (the file - edit - view - ... - help menus)?

Hi list,
I have installed qgis1.1/1.3/1.4 versions successfully.
I am trying to connect GPS (port: com1) to QGIS.
I have selected from menu as follows: -

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Create groups in python plugins
Message-ID: <d74603e80911040237l2ca575b8w11c51074795f5b5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm writing a little plugin for adding new maps, extracted from zip files.
Everything's fine, I extract the zip file and add a few layers.
Then I need to add a new group (for a country), but up to now,
I could not find a way to do that over QgisInterface.

Is there a way to add new groups in a python plugin, just like selecting
"Add group"
when right-clicking in the layer view?

Regards
Andres

Subject: [Qgis-developer] error creating a GRASS location
Message-ID: <455dd4d3967f1ef6594a1df4dd934b3f@localhost>


Hi all.
Just finished a workshop (21 people!) on qgis+grass at the sasig in
Evora[0]. Went very well, all from a USB pen [1, 2]; people looked
enthusiastic.
We just had a couple of problems (which, given the range of tasks I have
been trying, is quite good to me):
- a space in the path prevented r.contour from running successfully
- the creation of a location, taking the extent from a loaded map, crashed
systematically qgis with:

Warning: QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for
on_btnHelp_clicked()
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'QgsGrass::Exception'
what():  region for current mapset is not set
run "g.region"
Aborted

Unfortunately I cannot investigate much, as the user has left, and I cannot
replicate it on my machine, so I'll not open a bug, I mention here just for
the record, and in case it helps understanding a potential weakness.
All the best.

Hello:

            I was testing my python GPS plugin and finding that it will
not load into the separate install of QGIS. However it loads fine into
the OSGEO4W version. Here is the set of error messages that are
generated when the standalone version opens:

 

Couldn't load plugin "trackgps" from ['C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS

I have searched the QGIS Mimas folder and found the win32file.pyd file
in the python\win32 subfolder. Is this folder not in the search path for
QGIS? Can someone help me fix this problem?

... I have tried that on Linux with 6.4.0svn (current), no problem.
Which OS did you use there? The Ubuntu 9.04 GNU/Linux on the stick?

I see the same error here:
http://forum.qgis.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5019#p8664
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=549120

-> set by pcav to invalid :)

Perhaps GRASS is crashing only subsequently?

Is this right:
- which GRASS version: GRASS 6.4Rc5?
- which operating system: Ubuntu 9.04 GNU/Linux?

Or did the user bring his own machine?

William,

I was wondering if you have seen the problem with the new composer  
breaking some core OS X functionality? If I open an existing project  
(possibly true with new projects as well), the dock is killed, command- 
tab to switch between applications does not function, expose and  
spaces are non-functional, and I have to logout to cure my ails.

Have you built and tested the new composer at all? I'm trying to see  
if this might be narrowed down to my use of the qt-4.6-cocoa beta or  
if it is something internal to the new composer changes irrespective  
of the qt version.

If you could test the current trunk, that would be useful. I just  
built the xcode project, and the same problem exists as with the cmake  
build.

Thanks,
John

William,

You can disregard. I reverted to qt-4.5.3-carbon and the issue does  
appear to be tied to qt-4.6. I have not tried 4.6-carbon to see if it  
is a cocoa-specific issue yet.

Hi,

Would it be a good idea to implement that feature?
I'm not sure if anyone could ever need it.
I've read a bit of the code and saw that you would add new
groups in QgsLegend.

Well, adding new groups is not a problem there. But I'm not sure
about how to move a map layer from one group to another.
As far as I understand it, this would need QgsLegend to
be in the qgis API, where I have some doubts. ;)

Regards
Andres

The error seems different to me:
what(): Incompatible library version for module. You need to rebuild GRASS
or untangle multiple installations.

yes

yes, as above.

Hi all,

This is howto for building any plugin from sources:
1. Check out plugin's source in QGis plugins directory qgis/src/plugins:
cd qgis/src/plugins
svn co http://svn.repo-of-plugin/some_plugin
2. Add name of new plugin's directory in CMakeLists.txt of plugins dir:
cd qgis/src/plugins
nano CMakeLists.txt
SUBDIRS (some_plugin)
3. Build QGis as usually:
cd qgis/build
ccmake ..
make && make install

Hi all,
In this way, is it planned to modify the legend panel? Qgis lacks about a real 
grouping option, where we can append layers to only one group and modify 
parameters (transparency, visibility, ...). Having to manually DnD sometimes 
more than 50 tiles one by one is less than a pleasure...

Hi, QgsMapToolEdit seems doesn't have SIP files.
It would be useful to subclass that class to make user defined plugins...

Hi devs,

We're going to make some quite extensive changes to our Georeferencing
module (more on that later).

We can continue working in our svn and move it to QGIS when we're
done.

But the ability to get nightly builds and working directly is
tempting, so we're asking if it is possible to let us commit to the
trunk in Georeferencer area and may be a little bit around.

Please let me know which way is prefered.

Maxim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS/QT write to registry problem
Message-ID: <775394499.20091106094356@gis-lab.info>

Hi devs,

may be something to check while on hackfest

I have an annoying problem, which is really strange. It is the case
for one machine and I thought the problem is in its configuration, but
now it "creeped" to another one, so I think the problem is more
generic in either QGIS or QT.

The problem is about saving anything in Windows registry. Basically
after sometime QGIS stops doing it. As a result, for example, you
cannot switch from one interface language to another. I change the
language in the interface, but it doesn't appear that the change is reflected
in the registry.

We're also having exactly the same problem with other plugins of ours
that are storing anything in the registry. QGIS/QT? just stops writing
anything in the registry.

Win XP, SP3, latest nightly build from OSGeo4W. Cleaning the registry and
restarting QGIS helps, but only temporarily.

I realize this problem is hard to reproduce. I cleaned up QGIS and
registry dozen of times already to test our stuff, and got tired of
it. I hope this rings a bell to someone. And yes, it may be all my specific
setup problem after all.

Maxim

PS: the place where QGIS is writing stuff in the registry is a little
weird I suppose, it is:

Message-ID: <853691.72172.qm@web110809.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hello,
 This should be very simple, but somehow the package qgis does not seem to be known to my installation of Ubuntu.

Reminder: as some of us have already noticed on this mailing list, the Ubuntu x86 binaries for Ubuntu Karmic Koala are not there.

As a result I went looking for an installation disk of the previous release of Ubuntu (Jaunty Jackalope) and found one in a book that was sold in a local bookshop.
So I installed the previous release of Ubuntu.
Then I looked at the Ubuntu homepage for instructions which are available
here
https://launchpad.net/~qgis/+archive/stable

So I launch the Synaptic package manager and 
open it up and launch the software source window, and select the 
"third party software" tab. (BTW my Ubuntu is in French so my translations of titles are guesses)
I then use the add button to add the following two lines as indicated on
the aforementioned URL:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/stable/ubuntu jaunty main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/qgis/stable/ubuntu jaunty main 

then in my terminal I type this
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68436DDF
this takes a while and it seems to work well.
then I click on the Reload button of Synaptic
I get a message saying it loads 51 files, but I can repeat clicking on this
indefinitely, it keeps on saying it reloads 51 files (how strange).
Then, inside Synaptic I do a search for qgis. 
The only package it comes up with is gpx2shp, when I was expecting qgis to show up.

What on earth is going on?

 [Qgis-user] Scattergram with compiled qwt5.2.0)
In-Reply-To: <20091028093735.GA1907@norbit.de>

Message-ID: <4AF55CD2.8070106@gmail.com>

I think this issue is equivalent to the one on having
Mrsid and ecw support under linux. From
a developer point of view (Jurgen), the fact that plugin Scatter plot
does not work because of a python-qwt5 problem is not "a qgis problem".
But from the user perspective, anything making qgis not working properly
or not fulfilling a set of minimum operational requirements must
be "a qgis problem".

In this particular case, if the situation is that there is no
python-qwt5 package able to let a given plugin work, then either
the qgis developers accept that making an specially-tuned binary version of
the python-qwt5 package is a TODO task, or the "qgis book of style of python
plugins"
must state that no plugins should be made relying on that package, and thus
an alternative for the current Scatter plot plugin should be in the agenda.

In general terms, I think that the qgis developers should discuss and
get to an agreement
on whether the goal is having an operational package or a testbed
for newer developments and proofs of concepts where reaching an
operational reliability is not a main issue.

Both options are valid, but they are different, and users must know the
choice.

I totally disagree with the comments posted by Tim Sutton and Paolo
Cavallini few weeks ago:

"> The counter side to the 'FOSS developers expect users to be compiling
> > geeks' debate is that users always want things at no effort and now 
  :-)

Tim: agreed fully. Too often we have requests from users, too rarely we
have help"

Users must put their effort on using QGIS, and their satisfaction is
the main reason for QGIS to exist. With no or few users, qgis will
decay. And users do a lot of effort on using QGIS, as they often must deal with
problems that are not present in commercial software and sometimes find, with
frustration, that their processing chain gets interrupted
in an step where qgis tools are not working (and the only answer they get
is "this is solved in svn trunk". A pretty satisfactory answer for a developer,
but a totally devastating answer for an student with his/her exercise to be due
in 24h). For some users, this is the price to pay because they cannot afford
paying the licenses
but for some others, having several alternatives of commercial licenses
paid as campus licenses, this is the price they pay for actively collaborating
on a public domain tool which, they believe, will be better on the long run.
We must all acknowledge the contribution made by developers. We must all
acknowledge the contribution made by of users.

The question is reaching a point in which a minimal set of critical operations
are reliably and efficiently done by QGIS (independently of other software such
as GRASS: QGIS+GRASS is already operational, but this is because GRASS reached
operational status 20 years ago). From this point on, people having
stable jobs (i.e., GIS technicians at universities, professors, researchers...)
will put a significant part of their paid time on debugging, enhancing and
extending QGIS. This is the case of R, which is, i my opinion, the paramount
example of success of public domain software, at least in science. I do not
know the exact numbers, but I think that despite the significant direct funding,
the most important source of funding for R comes from paid working time
invested by academic personnel with stable jobs).

I'm working on a web page in which I will propose a set of critical tasks

In an equivalent way, I'll try to set up another page for the plugins, so that
users can have a fast check on the degree of operationality of a giving plugin
prior to actually installing it.

I think that QGIS is not far from such an operational point and that
making an effort on reaching it rather than on developing newer tools for a
while would make a lot of sense... for users. Obviously, developers will do
what they will be willing to do. All what users can do is telling other users
what the situation is.

Hopefully this message reaches enough "controversiality degree" for you to
comment during the hackfest

Have fun!

This is not true: without developer it would decay, with lots of devs and
no user (admittedly, a paradoxical situation) qgis would be just as good :)

And users do a lot of effort on using QGIS, as they often must deal

This is not true: anybody can use trunk from previous day, with no effort,
even on windows.

Correct: I just posted such an acknowledgement. But there are thousands of
users that do not contribute the slightest to the project; this is a
weakness of all free project, and their own responsibility.
If all QGIS users would be as active as you, lots of problems would be
already solved.
All the best, and keep on helping!

Perhaps not a qgis "problem"... but a qgis "issue" certainly ;-)

I think the only possibly solution is the latter... qgis devs barely
have time for qgis
issues, let alone Python-Qt problems. In fact, we are currently
working on guidelines
for Python plugins in qgis, and it will have to be up to the plugin
authors to make sure
their plugins obey these guidelines. Qgis main developers simply can't
support plugins
introduced by all plugin authors, and in fact, the author(s) of the
problem plugins
should be contacted directly (note that there are actually very few
officially supported
plugins in the official repo).

In this particular case, the scatterplot plugin is really just a
contributed plugin that is
there for those who need it, but is not 'part of qgis' and as such
isn't currently on the
agenda at all. Right now I think stability of current tools (and
improvement of current
functionality) is a more important agenda item...

Certainly it is already the former... the proofs of concept and
cutting edge stuff is almost always
plugins (at least to start with), and again, plugins are something
separate to the core qgis. I
think what we are seeing quite a bit of the time is users and
contributors focusing more
on developing plugins, and the devs are focused much more on the core
libraries. This is how it
should be (in my opinion), and the fact that some plugins are unstable
is simply an artifact of the
fact that there is currently no rigorous guidelines from submitting plugins

> Both options are valid, but they are different, and users must know the

The goal is to move towards a fully stable, operational GIS... plugins
and extra features (such as scatterplots)
are simply nice extensions at the moment..

Hmm, I don't think I agree with this, those new users are certainly important!

We must also acknowledge that QGIS is a 'work in progress'. There are
going to be many features
that are lacking, and when users submit bug reports, these features
get added (maybe not always
'right now'). We simply don't have the funding to build a fully
functional platform right off the bat. We
also have to acknowledge that QGIS is still a relatively young
project, and as it grow, the number of
users/contributors/developers will grow... meaning these features that
are lacking will start to be
added faster and faster (which I think we're already seeing).

Indeed, the contributions of all are important... but we also have to
note that developers
do not 'serve the users', they are users themselves, and are
volunteering their time to work
on things that 'they need'. If they can, they will also implement
things that other users need,
but in the end, there is only so much time in the day.

Great, this is the type of thing that helps clarify what needs to be done.
I also think it's important to acknowledge that plugins are indeed a
separate thing, and many
*are* simply proofs of concepts, *not* ready for production use. It's
up to users to tell the plugin
authors they are interested, and to support further development!

 [legal note] R (and Qgis) is not 'public domain software'. 'Public
domain' is a legal term that generally means out of copyright and with
no usage restrictions. R and the packages in CRAN are under a variety
of open-source licenses including the GPL, and are copyright of
various authors and institutions - it is this copyright that allows
authors to place works under the GPL. [ends]

 My 2 euros:

 Packages are accepted into CRAN only if they pass various QC checks
and if they have an active maintainer. If a maintainer gives up on a
package it disappears from CRAN. This doesn't happen often since an
outgoing maintainer will advertise and a keen user will take it up.
Qgis is similar - Clearly a problem with a plugin in a third-party
repo is not a Qgis issue, and shouldn't be tracked in the qgis trac.
If the developer doesn't fix it then it's open source -- the user can
fix it themselves or pay to get it fixed. Plugins in the qgis repo are
a qgis problem, and if they can't be fixed by maintainers then should
be 'orphaned'.

 Your problem with a student having trouble getting their coursework
done because of a software bug also occurs in proprietary software but
worse - I've seen bugs - serious bugs - in a proprietary stats package
go unfixed for years. Just trying to find a place to report bugs is
often impossible. I had to resort to emailing an old friend who worked
for the company after being unable to find a bug report email address
on their website. I suspected the company thought their program had no
bugs. Try finding a bug tracker or support forum for SPSS even today!

 The situation with R is often that the gap between developer and user
is very small. Packages are often written because that person wants to
use a particular functionality (often from theory they have
developed). With Qgis mostly the theory is well-developed (raster
algebra, geometry calculations) and users just want to use it, and the
motivation for developers is less since they can probably do it all in
Grass anyway.

 Actually I don't know what drove half a dozen or so to gather in
Vienna this week! You're all mad! :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Context sensitve help IDs
Message-ID: <ceb0de270911071642ob261093k18c2dcccfcf75755@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
In the past, the context ids for context sensitive help were generated
by a Java web application that allowed you to create new content.

The IDs were based on a hash calculated from the class name being documented.

Here are the options:
1) Keep the web application and make it generally available for
maintaining context sensitive help.
2) Replace the method for creating context IDs and update the help
database through other means.

Option 2 requires another method for generating the unique IDs since
the method used is unique to Java. I have a Python script that will do
the job.

What approach does the community want to take?

Hi,

I've been trying to develop a python plugin for QGIS but I'm thinking
that it may be easier for me to contract out to somebody.  Is anybody
interested in developing a small python plugin?  I'm happy to keep all
code open and freely available once complete, in case anybody else
would find it useful.

Please send me an email if you are interested.

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating Win Build - stuck
Message-ID: <4AF67BB6.8040508@wildintellect.com>

All,

I've been working on bringing the mingw/msys build back up to date with
a working GRASS. So far via Marco's instructions and some shortcutting
via OSGeo4w I think I'm getting close.

Ran into an error somewhere between 3-7%, see
http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/232/cmakeerror.png

Based on ADKPete's suggestion I tried an mingw build of GEOS instead of
osgeo4w but that didn't seem to change anything.

Oh and an FYI, Python.cmake should be changed to check for MINGW or MSVC
for when to decide to use pyuic4.bat and pyrcc4.bat, or alternately just
use WIN32. I manually hacked it with that for now, not 100% what the
final solution is to ensure both build types with find the right python
files in the cmakesetup.

Thanks,
Alex

I would probably wait with addition of more symbols until the

I see 2 issues here:

1. Yhe ability of QGIS to allow for organization, ie a dropdown list of
folders(sets) to show in the symbol picker. I think discussing this at
the hackfest would be good.

2. How to organize the files in the repo. As I mentioned in IRC, there's
a new mailing list graphics@osgeo.org looking to tackle this kind of
issue as a meta issue for many projects, and to possibly house all the
icons in one central place so each project doesn't have to maintain a
separate copy. So this discussion should probably be ongoing.

Hi Luca,

this class isn't in gui library so it's not currently possible to make
it available in python bindings. But it should be relatively easy to
create your own QgsMapToolEdit-style class directly in python...

I add: I would also like the possibility for users to up and download icon
sets from a common repo, best if shared across projects. Our Plugin
Installer and pyqgis.org could be a source of inspiration.

Also:
I think that the current QGIS python console could be turned into a map 
calculator with few additions:

1. Put buttons to run some basic import commands such as
(or actually have a version
of the python console that starts up having done these (and perhaps other) imports):

from rasterlang.layers import layerAsArray
from numpy import *
from rasterlang.layers import writeGeoTiff

2. Define the arrows to browse up the history instead of the
3. Defining Ctrl+Return to execute

Responding to some usefull ideas, here are the changes for version 0.5:
Some GUI changes (trying to make it a little bit easier for the user to
understand). I accept any sugestions on this as i'm a terrible gui designer.
Implemented the Import list feature.
Implemented snap on vertexes based on project settings.
Implemented degree minutes and seconds recognition (but attention, the code
tries to strip anything other than the numbers, so probably it's not working
with DMS decimals. Still to improve.)
Fixed zoom bug.
Thanks for the tips and I hope you like this new version. It's getting
closer to what I had in mind when I started.

Please note I'm not talking about rasterlang, a plugin
that is not being maintained or any further developed, according to his
author. I'm talking about a replacement for it, just
based on an small enhancement of the current python console.

The rasterlang plugin uses such an odd syntax that is very unfriendly to be used.

Marco,

Based on my current testing, it seems that the behavior of auto-hiding/ 
minimizing of existing composer windows in opened project files is  
leading to the gui issues in Qt-4.6-cocoa and OS X. Would it be  
possible to simlpy not auto-hide that window when a project file is  
opened?

Perhaps even an OS or qt version test (QT_MAC_USE_COCOA?) could cause  
this to be skipped. I'm hoping that the tabbed interface idea that Tim  
mentioned will come about. That may be the cure-all that can overcome  
some of the general awkwardness of the current setup.

Thanks,
John

Hi all.
How about setting up a poll (after the one Werner is just putting online

Of course the crucial issue is to have a reasonably complete list: anyone

I am also interested in a live GPS plugin and had some ideas how to

Just tried to write some code for myself (another project), but then
I had a look into http://nmea.sourceforge.net/, which seems to be a
useful library for this task. So far I only looked at the code and did
not use it. The gpsd implementation is also very sophisticated, at least
the parser is worth looking at. And there is gpsbabel, which might be
handy here.
Platform independent access to serial ports may be implemented using
http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/ , although the implementation
seems to be a bit crude (doubled code/Classes for win/posix systems).
Got that running (on linux) already...

Maybe you can achieve gpsd-similar results under WIN using
http://gpsfeed.sourceforge.net/ , which is a small tcl program that
listens to a serial port and provides the nmea data over a given port,
just like gpsd does with:
http://localhost:2947/?r

Maybe I could help with this sooner or later, but first I need to get a
dev system properly set up and read all the dev-infos in the wiki.
Please contact me, if you have suggestions, how I could help.

Thanks,

Alex, 

I believe the problem is that qgssvnversion.h is not being constructed properly due to a test for MSVC in CMakeLists.txt in the top level source directory that should also test for MINGW , like in Python.cmake as you found. *nix commands are attempted, but fail since it is a Windows system.

see attached patch file

I hope this helps.

I have been using MinGW building for some time now and have some things I do to make compiling a little easier on my build system, which is somewhat different from the way Marco Pasetti documented Windows building. I would be willing to share these if you are interested. Most of these allow CMake to find libraries and headers without having to manually set the variables.

All,

I've been working on bringing the mingw/msys build back up to date with
a working GRASS. So far via Marco's instructions and some shortcutting
via OSGeo4w I think I'm getting close.

Ran into an error somewhere between 3-7%, see
http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/232/cmakeerror.png

Based on ADKPete's suggestion I tried an mingw build of GEOS instead of
osgeo4w but that didn't seem to change anything.

Oh and an FYI, Python.cmake should be changed to check for MINGW or MSVC
for when to decide to use pyuic4.bat and pyrcc4.bat, or alternately just
use WIN32. I manually hacked it with that for now, not 100% what the
final solution is to ensure both build types with find the right python
files in the cmakesetup.

Thanks,
Alex

Steve,

I'd be very interested in seeing any other notes you have on the
process. If you are building via MinGW and are willing to share in the
process I will be happy to help get your builds into the NSIS script to
create a new version of the Standalone installer.

My only goal here is a standalone installer with grass and python like
Macro used to make. It would be great if this didn't rely on a single
person as in the past so I would be very happy to collaborate with you.

FYI, I have access to virtual machines of most versions of windows for
building and testing but do not use windows myself(anymore).

Thanks,
Alex

Hi all,

Thank you very much, Tim, for the extensive summary of the hackfest.

I'd like to also emphasize the work that J?rgen Fischer did on the forms.
For public administrations (government institutions), forms are very
important. Currently one had only flat tables, alphabetically ordered, and
no way to influence the display of the results of the info tool. One had
several GUI-elements available (input fields, sliders, comboboxes, etc.)
but no complete control on the look and layout of the form. In order to
display custom forms, one had to develop a python plugin in the past.

qtDesigner allows to design forms in a graphical way. In order to properly
work with QGIS, the widget names need to correspond with the data columns
in QGIS. One can save the form design in a .ui File (an XML-based
description of the form). In QGIS one can now choose a .ui file in the
layer properties dialogue. If QGIS properly finds and parses such a file,
the form is displayed instead of the standard infotool dialogue (if there
is a unique result). If the query result is not unique, the form can be
opened with a right click from the infotool results list.

This feature is quite new (from the hackfest) and would need to be tested.
I would like to thank J?rgen for his work and invite others to test the
new forms feature and provide feedback. I am looking forward to more
customized and flexible forms in the future.

J?rgen or I may also provide a more detailed description in a blog entry
on the QGIS webpage.

Andreas

For your knowledge, I developed a python plugin that utilizes QCompleter
associated to an input box.
The plugins loads street names from an AS/400 database via ODBC and these
are pushed into an array for QCompleter.
The whole work is not too complicated.

Right Quantu Navigator app used to work only with old versions of QGIS
and currently I'm not planning to do any updates to it. But it
features only a gps emulator, no tracking from a real device.
QGIS mapper has its gps backend written in python, so that would mean
porting it to c++ (shouldn't be a big deal).
Never tried trackgps plugin, but AFAIK it uses the code from qgis mapper.

NMEA parsing is relatively simple so instead of using some external
library in C it might be better to write one C++ class that would do
it... Regarding serial port communication, I've used QextSerialPort by
myself and seems to be a good choice.

My idea is that we should support NMEA input generically on all
platforms, additionally with gpsd support to enable use with some
devices that don't send NMEA. Never tried gpsfeed so not sure what the
results would be...

I think the result from hackfest was that we surely want real time GPS
tracking functionality in core library, but I don't remember anyone
volunteering to implement it. So we would be very happy to see any
patch that adds this feature.

Enabling users to work with legend will be a good step forward. I
think we could create a QgsLegendInterface class available in gui
library that would allow manipulation with layers and groups in legend
widget:
- add / remove a group
- add / remove layer to/from a group
- list contents of legend or of one group
- modify layer / group visibility in canvas
- more...

But as always, there has to be someone to create such interface and do
the connection with legend classes - your patches are welcome!

I must add, that I've not commited that work yet, because I would like to give
it a little more testing first.  Given that that goes well, I'll commit in the
evening.

Message-ID: <b2de29ac0911100707k4aa852edi7320318323e5b2a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Robert, Anita and others interested in QGIS Iconography

Since we just finished the hackfest, I promised Anita that I would
write to Robert to discuss the GIS icon theme. I am writing on the dev
mailing list for transparency and so that others may add their input
to the discussion.

Robert we would like to switch over to using GIS icon theme as the
default theme in QGIS 2.0. Let me start by quoting from my blog post
on our recent hackfest:

" The topic of icon usage within QGIS received quite a bit of
attention. The GIS icon theme is great in that it is visually
consistent but the feedback I received from most users was that they
still preferred the ?old? default theme. We discussed why this may be
the case, with the concensus being that it was down to:

- people who were already familiar with the old theme had to relearn
to recognise the GIS theme icons so its easier just to not switch
- the contrast in the GIS theme icons is quite low so your brain has
to do more work to figure out the important elements of each icon
- some of the icons contain concepts that are not recognisable ? they
dont provide any or enough visual clue as to what their function is
(e.g. spatial bookmarks, add vector)
- Some of the icons break with existing user interface memes for
example using a hand icon for a pan button and a four direction arrow
to indicate that something can be moved.

We would really like to have a consistent icon theme in QGIS 2.0 so
Anita has started a revision of the icons to try to address some of
these issues. We will use this posting as a starting point for a
discussion with Robert Szczepanek (the original authoer of the GIS
theme) and try to work with him to pass our changes upstream where he
is agreeable. You can see an example of the original icon theme from
Robert (first image below) and the updates from Anita (second image
below).

"

Anita has been doing great work but obviously we would like to avoid a
situation where we create a fork of your icons or duplicate the
effort. At the same time we are sensitive to the fact that you or
other downstream projects may not like the direction we plan to take -
our changes meet our needs but may not meet the needs of other
projects.

Thus this email is really to sound you (Robert) out on whether you
would be willing to accept the updates that Anita will be working on
and if so the best way to go about filtering this work up to you. Also
if you have any other hints or comments on how to make the process of
us (well Anita mainly) updating your icons in such a way that the
changes will be broadly interesting to other projects, we would love
to hear it.

Best regards

Tim

Hi all,

we're going to work on Georeferencer these days, here is the list of
things we're going to add. If there is something you want to add or
discuss, you are welcome. I cannot promise proposed functionality will be added, as we operate under
tight resourses, but at least it will make it in todo list.

1. Retire Helmert transformation
2. Move the whole plugin from QDialog to QMainWindow (like Map Composer)
3. Capture progress bar
4. Put all the output options on a single page
5. Add GCP table and move Load/Save GCPs functionality to the table
6. Add ability to turn off/turn on potentially invalid GCPs in the table, without removing them.
7. Add, change, remove GCPs using the table as well as usual way.
8. Generate command line for GDAL to run externally
9. Fix bugs and improve UI.

What about displaying errors? It seems essential for me to consider this tool 
as usable :)

I knew you gonna ask ;) Moving GCPs to table is a step forward to it and we have it
on the aditional list, but not among do-to-release list that I've sent. I guess we can utilize
GDAL transformation matrix to do error calculations.

Hi Maxim

Bear in mind that we are planning in the not so distant future to move
map composer from being a separate window to being a tab so copying
its implementation approach may not end up with a solution that is
consistent over the long term. What about considering making a split
map view in the main window rather, along with a dock panel to hold
the options. On the left canvas have the image you are georeferencing,
and the right the reference image? I can probably make a little mockup
if my explanation is not clear....

Regards

Tim

Message-ID: <2E95F75EDC25D54999387A1E2E6EF62741CA9D8088@MBX02.cgcent.miami.edu>

Hello All:

My Qgis application was fully working everyday for a month and suddenly the vector layers are not loading. I use OSGeo4W version 1.0 Kore and have tested in two machines (win XP and Vista) and happened the same in both. The complaint that I get is this:

..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsproviderregistry.cpp(341) : (QgsProviderRegistry:: getProvider) Libary name is
Failed to load
..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp(2200) : (QgsVectorLayer::setDataProvider) unable to get data provider
..\..\..\..\..\src\core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp(150) : (QgsVectorLayer::~QgsVectorLayer) In QgsVectorLayer destructor

Is it a bug in my application? where from could it result? I recently added a rubberband, can this be related?

Thank you, I appreciate your answers.
Angelica.

Hi Tim,

I have written patch that demonstrates work tabs with map canvas and
composer. Now it doesn't work with plug-ins like georeferencer but if you
will chose tabs instead docks it will be moved in tabs ease with help of
using now map composer approach of developing.
BTW, we discussed some time ago about tabs and docks. I implemented test
patch with docks it worked only with map canvases. I can say about docks
that it is more hard to code and I guess they more hard to understand for
users in condition if you intend to implement capability to work with few
map canvases, map composers and plug-ins. The main disadvantage of tabs is
it can't be detached in standard implementation to distinguish docks. But in
patch I have implemented this feature and some other such as preview tab,
move and restore closed tabs (restore works only with tabs but not detached
windows). Another feature that I implemented in patch is tabbed legend. So
you should think about this too. In feature I will planed to implement tabs
for plug-ins and composers like legend tabs for map canvas.
Well, I wander what do you think about using tabs with map composer and
plug-ins (e.g. georeferencer)?

Hi Tim,

First of all thank you very much for detailed notes from your hackfest
discussion. I had some problems with my network and missed this part of
video online.

Let me forward this post also to OSGeo Graphics ML.

This is natural.

Agree. It was my intention to focus first on metaphors. If they are
recognizable, next step is to add colors.
Probably original Tango palette will be solution for better contrast. We
need however some rules for colors. I.e. yellow for selection. In this
case copyright icon must change.

Here we can discuss.
In spatial bookmarks we define region to display, so natural for me was
to show region. And as bookmark I used tab. Book is good, but there is
no relation with space. What if there will be in program other
(non-spatial) bookmark.
Vector metaphor has shape of "V" letter, so once explained it's easy to
remember. If used only in this context there is no risk to mix it up
with eg. (poli)line feature. I tested many options including Anita's
semi-transparency. They are much nicer, but you can mix them up with eg.
polygon.

Hand was too difficult to draw. That was my problem :)
Move icon is another case. Let's look at Anita's 'move vertex' icon. And
forget about colors (daltonism). We get 'add vertex'. That was the reason.

My first goal is to implement those icons in GIS projects, so if you
have any ideas how to improve - we can do it. That is why I wanted to
run 'graphics' mailing list. For this type of discussion between
projects. I'm not emotionally related with those icons ... maybe a
little bit ;) But I appreciate and always consider comments from
projects interested in implementation.
"Somewhere must exist common visual language, maybe even not the most
beautiful one ..."
English isn't as beautiful as polish, but still is universal and we all
use is ;) Better or worse.

I think the best process at the moment is:
- public discussion at graphics mailing list (welcome Anita),
- any feedback and comments on QGIS lists is also important,
- subsequent improvement of existing icons and creation of new ones
Radical changes, in any direction, should be done with care.
We should coordinate efforts with Anita and work on vectors, not raster
renders. I just wonder why you didn't contact me before, to get source
SVG files. Changes would be much easier ...

Thanks Tim for you activity!

+1 for rules!
Robert, could you point me to the "Tango palette"?

Now that you explained it, I understand your idea behind the icon. For  
Qgis (as there are no non-spatial bookmarks) I'd like to stick with the  
book until we find a good replacement.

"once explained" ... Well, that's the problem ;) People just tend to not  
read the manuals.
If I understand you correctly you chose this representation because it's a  
symbol for "vector" in general? I always thought it was the symbol for  
line. Danger of mix up even here I think.

Carson gave me an SVG file. I guess it's not really up to date but it  
contained almost all important symbols. Of course it would be nice to have  
the latest version.

I'll find more time to work on icons on the weekend. Looking forward to  
working together with you.

Ciao,
Anita

Hi Maria Ang?lica,

Maybe your qgis_prefix variable is wrong. It should be:

"C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-1.0"

Or something like that.

Also, you should use a recent version of QGis to be sure of get all the
classes for PyQGIS, because some of them has been added recently by the
dev's.

Regards.

This is one of standard palettes. Ready to use in Inkscape.

But this is QGIS specific case and we shouldn't call it 'spatial'.
Proposal:
bookmark -> book
spatial-bookmark -> some space relation

There is always danger (line and polygon), so it's more a question of
shape.

We need some infrastructure and concept to cooperate. At the moment you,

German Carrillo was right: my qgis_prefix was modified for use in another machine and I had not corrected it. My mistake. Problem solved!

Hi Otto,

I am not the developer but the one who proposed the tool.

Obviously the tool works on Polygon and Line Features, not on point 
features.

It replaces the line or polygon part from the first to the last 
intersection with the original line. Obviously, with Polygons this can 
sometime lead to unintended results. It is mainly useful to replace 
smaller parts of a polygon, not major overhauls. For line features it 
works very well.

There may be some corner cases where the tool fails - Marco may be able 
to explain.

I agree. The book icon should be called bookmark. I'm not aware of the  
names you use for the icons. I guess they got renamed for use in QGIS.  
Here it's called mActionShowBookmarks.png

Polygon with V-shape? Would be better visible than the line maybe.

Hello,

I posted some improvements to the georeferencer back in februrary,
including lots of clean-ups and a GCP list with residual error reporting.
It also fixes the helmert transform, which was broken in SVN. Please have a
look at the commit messages at

 http://github.com/mmassing/georeferencer/commits/WARP_REFACTORING

for a more detailed changelog.

I think it would be a good starting point for your changes. Unfortunately,
I am currently really swamped with work (final spurt on completing my master
thesis), so I won't find the time to polish the rater crude user interface. But 
the underlying reprojection framework has been carefully refactored for 
simplified warping implementation and GCP residual reporting (and has been in
production use for a rather large georeferencing project), so it should be a
good basis for the enhancements you are planning. 

Regards,

	Manuel

qgis is a very nice program and thus I am familiar with using Qt anyway,
I'd love to help out a little bit.

I'm sure there are, but currently, there are no open bugs on it ;-)

One thing to consider is that the reshape tool alters the starting position of 
a polygon ring or a closed line. So the point that is represented 'twice' will 
not be the same any more. I don't expect this to be a problem for most 
application but it is something to consider.

Also, the reshapeline is not allowed to cross several polygon rings as this 
would generate an invalide polygon.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
During the hackfest, thanks to a suggestion by Tim, I cleaned up and
resized all GRASS icons. Results:
- the GRASS toolbox now loads much faster (3-4 sec on a slow machine, about
3x faster than before)
- the plugin package size has drastically reduced, from 6.4 to 1.1 Mb,
making overall QGIS package substantially smaller
Now we should start working on making these images more beautiful, and
integrated with other QGIS themes (at least the default one).
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] py plugins organization
Message-ID: <0cea29bdb1c442ebc6ae725a74b453ff@localhost>


Hi all.
Concerning the organization of the ~100 pytho plugins, why don't we group
them in the same way as GRASS does?
I mean:
- one group for vector operations (v. commands in GRASS)
- one for rasters (r. + i., imagery)
- one for database (db.)
- maybe one for display (d., e.g. for coordinate capture, zoom to point
etc.)
- the unclassifiable ones could be put in a ugly m. (miscellaneous), so to

Thanks Tim for the report, Werner for the organization, all the
participants for their time, and donors for helping us.
A couple of numbers: I calculated 133 commits during the hackfest (plus a
number on the tail immediately afterwards), and around 1,000 hours of work
altogether - rather impressive to me.
All the best.

Hi all.
Could you please check all the dialogs for the presence of a help button?
If help is available, the button should be there (I suspect there are cases
where this is not the case), when the help is not available, the button
should be removed (see e.g. https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2075).
Quite frustrating for an user to click and seeing nothing...
Thanks a lot.

Hi qgis devs

When saving a layer style, it sets attributes for min/maxLabelScale
and scaleBasedLabelVisibilityFlag in the *.qml file. I'd like to
save/load the global min/maxScale values the same way.

Patch against trunk attached, please consider applying.

Yes, this is a rough shape of the initial classifiction I made in Vienna.

This is the point we probably have to stray from the grass model. QGIS is just 
much more GUI-oriented, so  we have many plugins related to the canvas, 
queryfying etc.

This is the biggest problem, as what we have is just a huge bunch of various  
plugins not organized in any way at their development stage, so it's 
completely not comparable to the coherent set of the grass modules ;-)

Message-ID: <4AFA981F.3080904@wildintellect.com>

All,

Based on chats in the IRC looking for ways to quantify and visualize the
success of the hackfest, I tossed together a code swarm video.
http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=21jdrt3&s=4

I plan to do the whole history of QGIS commits(higher quality too) once
I can pin down better colors and the proper regex to assign files to
good categories.
Documentation is a real pain, since the api is all inline there's no way
to get at that, and it's real hard to tell between UI pngs and docs pngs.

Feedback welcome,
Alex

I tested qgis 1.3 and trunk under Ubuntu linux and I confirm that with
trunk it writes the wrong filename, while with 1.3 is ok.

I'll suggest, that cross listing may be an acceptable way to deal with
part of the issue, within some limit of course. Nothing worse than
selecting a folder you think contains the tool you want and realizing
it's in something totally different.

Possible additional categories:
Cartography
Map Interaction
Export tools (Mapserver, OpenLayer, Mapnik stuff)
Import tools (Open Street Map?)

Would Metadata go under Database or should we call it Data Management?
Course then the question is if GDAL tools fits in there too.

Seems like we need to look more closely at the existing tools and see
what alternatives present themselves.

Ah, sorry, forgot to mention: I tried to register an osgeo id, but the
osgeo server timed out. I just tried again and now it worked.

Here's the ticket:

Yes I can also confirm this, it must be something that was changed in
trunk... I will try to figure out why and get to the bottom of it...

Hi John

r12088 does not do the minimizing on mac. 

My recent commit brings back the old behaviour of only closing composer 
instances instead of deleting them. To really delete (and also rename) them, 
there is a dialog called 'composer manager'.

A tabbed interface will surely be good. At the hackfest in Vienna, we decided 
to wait with the tabs until after the 1.4 release because adding tabs will 
alter qgisapp.cpp/h heavily. Like that, 1.4 can be released sooner.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

This implementation works flawlessly as far as I can tell. I think this approach, and the use of a dialog when opening composer, is very useful. Perhaps this should be the default approach on all OS's. Also, not deleting them is much more intuitive from my perspective.

The wait on tabs makes sense.

Cheers,
John

	property lists
Message-ID: <b2de29ac0911111358k389ac440p469dfbc8081e2820@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Following our discussions I will start moving some of the core plugins
into the mainstream codebase (so they will no longer be plugins):

- copyright
- north arrow
- scale bar
- csv importer
- gps
- wfs

I still need to figure out where the first three will appear in the
menus....I'll come up with a suggestion later.

I was also going to suggest we do the same with vector (ex ftools)
menu so that it is not a plugin anymore, although I'm not sure of the
route we should follow to do this since vector tools are python.
Perhaps we should wait a little and over the longer term port the
frontends to c++ too?

Also I will be committing some changes that will allow us to start
using property lists (also as discussed at the hackfest). I will start
on the vector props dialog and then do the same for raster props and
options dialogs (our three biggest / most complex dialogs I think).

I'll see how far I get until Martin commits his symbology-ng code
(after which we will enter feature freeze).

Regards

Some devices probably send NMEA with some modifications, though IMHO a
simple parser should work with 95% of devices.

Using parsing code from gpsd also might be an option to consider...

Our main page is on OSGeo wiki, so probably main OSGeo SVN/trac is the
right direction. Do you know what formal/technical steps should be
undertaken?
And OSGeo Labs [2] looks like excellent next(first?) step.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] compile python bindings with msvc
Message-ID: <200911121108.54839.marco@hugis.net>

Hi devs

I'm trying to build the python bindings on windows with msvc, using Qt and the 
python classes from OSGEO4W.
cmake tells me that 'PyQt4 development files are missing'. Obviously, the 
statement 'from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui, QtNetwork, QtSvg, QtXml' in 
Python.cmake fails.

Do I need to set an environment variable such that python finds the PyQt4 files? 
Or is there a cmake variable that I can set?

Thanks for your help,
Marco

Actually we can't (and shouldn't) force plugins to go into a specified
menu. There are many ways how a plugin could integrate into QGIS, so
we've concluded that forbid any way.

The only thing we're going to do is to create guidelines for plugin
developers and hope they will follow them. And if someone would like
his plugin to get among official plugins, the plugin would be accepted
only when it conforms with these guidelines.

Check ms-windows\osgeo4w\package.cmd.  It calls cmake to create a VC project,
builds and installs it and packages it - so it should have all the information
you need.

Are you using OSGeo4W's python?

Hi

You need to compile from in vcexpress launched from an osgeo4w shell. Also need to use cmake advanced options to set python lib etc.

Another option that Juergen was showing me at the hackfest is to compile using his package builder - however the process does not build cleanly for me yet. I have kept some notes on the procedure which I will post to my blog once it is working properly.

Hi Maxim,

> thanks, we'll try to integrate them all together.

Great, to facilitate intergration I've updated the git repository to the 
current SVN version, so my modifications should be up-to-date and apply
cleanly.

Current SVN seems to be broken however, due to SVN commit 11962,  "User 
interface audit updates round #1"

E.g. in mapcoordsdialog.cpp, signals are not setup correctly. (e.g.,

	connect(buttonBox, SIGNAL(accepted()), this, SLOT(accept()));
	connect(buttonBox, SIGNAL(rejected()), this, SLOT(reject()));

missing in the constructor).
Other dialogs seem to be affected as well. Maybe this planned as round #2 of 
the UI audit? 
cheers,
  Manuel

Right. It's also possible to set the build type variable in a

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Snapping
Message-ID: <f0f9bf090911120806r6b387c06pf18a79ae4a24e0bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I've been working on the QgsAzimuth plugin and recently some users told me
of a limitation on the code I wrote.
The snapping is not with enough precision.
The following code is the event that I wrote that tries to use snap and if
not possible, use the captured pixel as coordinate. Is it the right way of
implementing a snap tool?

 def canvasPressEvent(self,event):
    pixels=event.pos()
    snapper=QgsMapCanvasSnapper(self.canvas)
    snapped=snapper.snapToBackgroundLayers(pixels)
    if len(snapped[1])>0:
        xy=snapped[1][0].afterVertex
    else:
        #transforming pixels to x,y
        transform = self.canvas.getCoordinateTransform()
        xy = transform.toMapCoordinates(pixels) #captures the clicked
coordinate and transform
    self.emit(SIGNAL("finished(PyQt_PyObject)"),xy)     #return QgsPoint in
a signal

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

Is there way to make a point to polygon in python. I have two layers one is
raster ( includes polygons) the other is a vector layer.

Hi Lutfi,

It might help if you could explain in a bit more detail what exactly
you are trying to accomplish?
I'm a bit confused as to exactly what you mean by:

> Is there way to make a point to polygon in python.

A polygon is *made up* of points... are you looking to create Voronoi
polygons from a point layer?

>I have two layers one is raster ( includes polygons) the other is a vector layer.

Hmm, not sure I understand this either... Are you saying that there
are polygons represented
in your raster as groups of contiguous similarly classified cells?

With a bit more detail I'm sure we can help you find your answer,

Kind regards,


Carson

Message-ID: <200911131655.32201.ivan.mincik@gista.sk>

Hi,
I am regularly recompiling latest SVN in to Debian packages using pbuilder environment. When using 'pbuilder' my 
application is missing revision information in window title and in "About".  When trying to build using 'debuild' 
or 'dpkg-buildpackage' it is OK.

During configure process I get "-- svnversion not found - version will be unknown", I have not found any qgssvnversion.h 
file.

I am not very familiar with cmake. Where can I look for ? 

Thanks

When cmake sees a .svn in the source directory it tries to
determine the checked out revision of the sources.

The easy solution proabably is to add svnversion to your pbuilder environment.

Another option is to introduce subversion as build dependency, although
released versions won't need it.

Hi all,

I know that there is a big change in the label framework in the very
near future, but what about the actual framework? I compiled un linux
today and installed on windows qgis-dev with osgeo4w, and I noticed that
there was a GUI change in the "labels" tab, but I cannot see anywhere
the option "field containing label", so everything you can see is just
"label".

Message-ID: <20091113.181316.29.0@webmail02.vgs.untd.com>

Alex,
 
Here are some of my notes about compiling QGIS and GRASS using MinGW & msys. Most are 
cryptic, since I haven't endeavored to make a unified document for others to use. They 
may have outdated or flat out wrong information (as I learned more about compiling with 
MinGW).

List of files with short description:

_compiling notes-20080629.txt	outlines the strategy I used to set up my build system

compile_run-20081018.txt 	the steps I use to compile QGIS

compile_use_with_GRASS6.4.0-20090501.txt	how I integrated GRASS 6.4.0 Windows binary with 
QGIS

qgis-cmakefile-changes-20080803.txt	how I modify some *.cmake files for less hassle with 
cmake

vars-452.bat  	sample batch file that sets the compiling environment


I haven't included notes about each of the libraries I have compiled. If you have 
questions about a library, let me know which one and I can send you the note. Some of the 
libraries can't be built without modifying the source in some way. I have attempted to 
find the root cause of these problems, rather than just find a work-around. (But there 
are some I haven't figured out yet)

I currently use binaries available for Qt 4.5.x, Python 2.6.x and PostgreSQL 8.3.x. And I 
try to keep Proj, GEOS and GDAL at current versions by compiling them as new versions are 
released. 

Presently, I have integrated the Windows GRASS 6.4.0RC build available from the OSGEO 
site by adding the GRASS directories to PATH. I moved some of the .exe and .dll files 
from various locations to reduce the number of directories listed in PATH. I believe this 
works, but I have not tested it extensively as I don't use GRASS much. I can load GRASS 
data layers and have tried a GRASS tool or two.

I had compiled GRASS 6.3.0 and was using that until I noticed the 6.4 binary was 
available. I have looked into compiling 6.4 because I wanted it to use the versions of 
libraries that I use for QGIS, but I haven't attempted building it yet.

Have you built GRASS 6.4.0?

The procedure I use to build QGIS has served me well for more than a year now. I have 
only made minor adjustments as QGIS or some libraries have changed.

I normally build on a Windows XP system, but I have successfully compiled on a Windows 
Vista 32-bit system and didn't have any problems beyond issues with User Access Control 
(be sure to run as Administrator).

Please let me know where you are at in trying to compile QGIS and GRASS so I can be of 
more assistance.

Steve,

I'd be very interested in seeing any other notes you have on the
process. If you are building via MinGW and are willing to share in the
process I will be happy to help get your builds into the NSIS script to
create a new version of the Standalone installer.

My only goal here is a standalone installer with grass and python like
Macro used to make. It would be great if this didn't rely on a single
person as in the past so I would be very happy to collaborate with you.

FYI, I have access to virtual machines of most versions of windows for
building and testing but do not use windows myself(anymore).

Thanks,
Alex

notes on compiling with MinGW/MSys

MinGW 5.1.4 / gcc suite 3.4.5 (gcc, g++, ld, etc.) / binutils 2.17.50 / MinGW32-make 3.81 / w32api 3.11 / mingw-utils 0.3
MSys 1.0.10 / msysDTK 1.0.1

MinGW and MSys are installed to default locations - C:\MinGW, C:\msys\1.0 respectively

I create the following directories in C:\msys\1.0\local\ (/usr/local/ in MSys terminal)
	bin\
	include\
	lib\
	share\
to hold compiled sources' installation.


I have set out to prove that:
	+ pre-built libraries/apps installed to their 'default' locations, such as C:\Program Files\... can be used for compiling
	+ doing minimal tweaking of configure / makefiles to get Windows binaries is possible in most cases
	+ it is not necessary to specify import libs explicitly when linking
	+ 




1. the MinGW version of gcc suite prefers import libs to static libs by way of the file name - Import lib: *.dll.a - Static lib *.a
	That is, *.dll.a is searched for first.
	It is possible to name the import lib like the static lib and it will work.
	An example where this is not true is zlib - the import lib is libzdll.a (should be libz.dll.a) which either needs to be coded into makefile/link commands that reference it, or to rename it. A good practice would be to modify the zlib makefile to output the 'standard' name, rather than to fix other makefiles.

2. some source packages are already set up to build Windows executables and just need minor adjustment of paths, perhaps.
	Other packages may need extensive work in order to build Windows executables, sometimes even figuring out the compiler commands.

3. for compiling GRASS and QGIS, need to have Bison and Flex; get these from the GnuWin32 project and unzip to /usr/local/
	bison-2.1-bin.zip
	bison-2.1-dep.zip
	flex-2.5.4a-1-bin.zip
   This sort of contaminates my preferred install location, but I don't want them in the MSys main bin directory either.
   Perhaps they should be installed in C:\MinGW\bin ? Or some other location? They are not MSys executables.

4. I am choosing to use official Windows binaries for PostgreSQL, Python - unless they don't work out.
	Paths to these binaries' locations for compiling, if they contain spaces, should be via the shortname notation: C:\Program Files\... ---> C:\Progra~1\... or /c/Progra~1/...
	These will be in their respective 'normal' locations. Will need to provide PATH settings somehow. I'm not keen on placing them in the system PATH (because certain files tend to be in multiple places), but that is probably the best overall strategy.
	Otherwise, various files/directories will need to be copied to the QGIS installed location, for example. Need to build a list of files that are necessary for this method.

5. I wish to have a fairly complete set of libraries, not just for GRASS and QGIS

6. I wish to have various utility programs from the various libraries available for use, unlike QGIS, which sometimes has some of these and sometimes not.
	Reason: have a single set of GIS apps/libs, rather than several different underlying versions of libraries

7. I generally build both static and dynamic (dll) libraries mainly to avoid fiddling with configuration switches and as long as the static libs aren't linked by default.

8a. some libs/utils/apps (Qt, sip, PyQt) may be compiled from a Windows command prompt; need to use mingw32-make for these
8b. if a source package has a makefile for MinGW this probably means using a Windows command prompt to build in, rather than a MSys terminal. Need to check the makefile to see if it has 'copy' vs. 'cp' commands, for example.
	Some packages may have a MSys makefile.

9. although I have read that linking to a .dll directly is supposed to work, I have found trying this with libpq.dll doesn't work at run-time; it links ok, but causes QGIS to crash on getting PostGIS data. This is probably why some people claim that using the 'official' Windows binaries doesn't work.
	Therefore, always be sure that the libs to link are *.a or *.dll.a (import libs)




order of compilation for GRASS, QGIS

these have no dependencies or dependents; may be compiled in any order before the main application
	fftw
	gsl
	PDcurses
	xdr

these have or are dependencies; must be compiled in this order (at least, anything that something else depends on must be done beforehand)
	zlib			[could use available binaries]
	libpng			(zlib)
	jpeg
	tiff			(jpeg, zlib)
	proj
	libgeotiff		(tiff, proj)
	freetype		(zlib)
	curl
	expat
	PostgreSQL		I'm not compiling this - using available binaries
	Python			I'm not compiling this - using available binaries
	sqlite			[could use available binaries]
	geos			(proj)
	gdal			(curl, expat, jpeg, libgeotiff, tiff, zlib, geos, proj, postgresql, sqlite)
	tcl
	tk			(tcl)
	sip
	PyQt

main applications
	GRASS
	gdal (to include GRASS)
	QGIS

Except for QGIS' use of Python via PyQt, I am building no bindings using SWIG or any other way.

================================================================

6/30/2008

After compiling all the above listed packages except for QGIS, I copied the entire MSys installation to a USB flash memory drive and tried running on the Compaq F712NR (Windows Vista). Also copied selected pieces of PostgreSQL 8.2.5 (libpq.dll and its dependencies) into a separate directory.
I have run GRASS to the extent of creating a GRASS GIS database, initializing it using EPSG code.


7/1/2008
have found (again) in QGIS building instructions, in the part about building the Msys environment, notes about changing configure's notion of command line length for Msys - replace 8192 with 32768 - this was in regard to GDAL building
Probably should do this for GEOS and GDAL building.


7/5/2008 - 7/12/2008
FYI -	1. probably should have path to Qt, Python, GRASS, PostgreSQL (and any others) executables, usually .../bin, added in Sys command window.
	2. various libs and apps often have their own set of environment variables to help other apps and themselves find supporting files. Need to learn which ones to use.
		list of vars.: PROJ_LIB, QTDIR
			GISBASE, GISDBASE, GRASS_WISH and others for GRASS may be set -- they are normally set by grass63 startup file
	   These should be set appropriately for the command prompt in use.

For compiling and running GRASS, QGIS set the following in PATH

Windows:
	C:\MinGW\bin
	C:\msys\1.0\local\bin
	C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.2\bin
	C:\Python25
	C:\Qt\4.4.0\bin
	C:\msys\1.0\local\grass-6.3.0\bin
	C:\msys\1.0\local\grass-6.3.0\lib
	C:\msys\1.0\local\tcl-tk\bin
	C:\Internet\gpsbabel.org\gpsbabel-1.3.5
	C:\Progam Files\qgis0.10.0			(to run QGIS; this is default location)

MSys:
	/c/MinGW/bin				(this should already be in PATH as /mingw/bin)
	/usr/local/bin				(this should already be in PATH -- MSys default)
	/c/Progra~1/PostgreSQL/8.2/bin
	/c/Python25
	/c/Qt/4.4.0/bin
	/usr/local/grass-6.3.0/bin
	/usr/local/grass-6.3.0/lib
	/usr/local/tcl-tk/bin
	/c/Internet/gpsbabel.org/gpsbabel-1.3.5
	/c/Proga~1/qgis0.10.0			(to run QGIS; this is default location)

The file mingwm10.dll from MinGW installation needs to available to Qt (and others?) if trying to make a combined directory for installation, like the QGIS Windows distro. 


7/26/2008
for QGIS, should have SubVersion Number (svn) installed so the svn version detection will get the version and whether it is modified.
	unpack svn-win32-1.4.4.zip to C:\Program Files\Subversion\1.4.4\
	add the path to svn bin directory to PATH

7/28/2008
have found that Qt has a make.bat which might get confusing as to which make is used depending on order of directories in PATH.
	It seems best to remove or rename make.bat and specifically call mingw32-make when needed.

	This brings to mind a question - what does either of the make commands call if they shell make? Need to test this.

====================================================

3/14/2009
	having trouble with tee.exe (/bin/tee.exe) - it seems to have been truncated to 0 bytes (probably a mistake in a command line; the date is 7/26/2008)
	Need to find out which MSys archive file has it so I can replace it. 
	Fixed by copying tee.exe from another installation.

3/15/2009
have compiled new versions of:
	proj 4.6.1
	geos 3.0.3
	sqlite 3.6.11
	gdal 1.6.0
and they are now part my MSys/MinGW build environment

3/16/2009
	compiled libpng 1.2.35 using my modifications and procedures -- ok (see notes for 1.2.32 & 1.2.29)
		did not recompile GDAL or QGIS because of this as the API shouldn't have changed

3/18/2009
	redirecting error output and std out to a file (at least in MSys -- haven't tried Windows command prompt)
		...command... >OUTFILE.TXT >2&1
	What is being done: 
		1. redirect std out to a file [ >OUTFILE.TXT ]
		2. then redirect error out to std out [ 2>&1 ]
	It doesn't work to redirect error out to std out, then std out to file.
	I got the idea to try this from redir in the MinGW distribution (but I couldn't get redir to do what I wanted)

NOTES:
I have discovered that QGIS compiled without Python bindings will work with Python if the bindings are available (previous compiling) - I had thought the capability would be disabled.



==============================================
10/26/2008	have switched to CMake 2.6.2 - needed to modify FindPythonInterp.cmake to allow it to find Python 2.6 (was only partially set up)
		Note that CMake 2.4 needs more extensive fix-ups for Python 2.6.


		Have switched to  Python 2.6

With Qt > 4.4.0 there appears to be a rendering problem to actual printers, where only the area contained by the bounding box of a POINT layer gets width settings used on lines/polygons; outside of this area is just one pixel width; also is not antialiased outside of the BB.


11/30/2008	with r9720 (or some earlier rev.) need svn higher than v. 1.4.4 I was using; upgraded to svn 1.5.4

		when using CMake 2.6 OpenSSL package is one of the defaults (??) CMake looks for; there is nothing I can find in QGIS that specifies OpenSSL.
		The odd thing is that the .dll found is linked only to the Dxf2Shp Converter plugin, not to every module.
		Without taking the time to pick apart QGIS build instructions to CMake I don't see why OpenSSL is linked to the one module. A quick check of the CMakeList.txt for it doesn't reveal any use of OpenSSL.

compiling QGIS with GRASS 6.4.0 Windows binary from OSGEO/GRASS

5/1/2009

after changing c:\_compile\vars-451.bat to set PATH and BASE_DIRS to the new locations for GRASS (lib and bin), QGIS would compile

But GRASS was not available when running QGIS.

Found that other directories in the GRASS tree are needed: extralib, extrabin, sqlite/bin, tcl-tk/bin (not sure if all are needed - I assume so, except if the files in these are available in other locations)

However, libpq.dll, ssleay32.dll, libeay32.dll are not compatible with QGIS (missing password functions in libpq; then the proper libpq needs the proper SSL libs mentioned)
Renaming the 3 dlls above allowed QGIS to load GRASS plugin and it works, at least to some degree - not well tested.

In addition, there is now a Python problem - can't load SIP

Conclusion: need to combine some of the files in various directories to cut the number of paths needed; and need to remove the 3 dlls and hope that GRASS can use the libpq.dll from the PostgreSQL 8.3 binary I installed.
	Also, need to decide what to do about SQLite, and some other libs - GDAL, GEOS - for example, as they are different versions, possibly different names.

Quantum GIS svn base=r8952

changes to various CMake configuration input files

cmake/Find?.cmake


In order to make configuring QGIS in Windows build environment (MSys) easier, I have modified several .cmake files

Most of the changes aren't needed if all libraries were in one of the so-called standard locations (implicit or explicitly listed), but this is not always so, especially in Windows.

The gist of the modifications:
+ allow use of environment variable BASE_DIRS where it is set to a list of directories to search to satisfy dependencies
	example:	BASE_DIRS=C:/msys/1.0/local;C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/8.2;C:/msys/1.0/local/grass-6.3.0
	These are where I typically put the various libraries - either compiled or from a binary distribution.

  The reason I didn't use LIB_DIR is that it is used in particular ways as a single directory value in some of the cmake files and I didn't want to break that use.
  It also doesn't reflect the notion that there may be a list of directories.

+ in the cmake/Find*.cmake files I have added: 
	ENV BASE_DIRS
	PATH_SUFFIXES include	-or- PATH_SUFFIXES lib
  in the FIND_PATH(), FIND_LIBRARY() calls.
  As a result of this change, the /include and /lib on the listed paths is not necessary, so I removed these. 

+ cmake/FindPostgres.cmake 
	+ added missing "${POSTGRESQL_PREFIX}" in the FIND_PATH() and FIND_LIBRARY() calls. This is one cause of extra effort to configure.
	+ added NO_DEFAULT_PATH to FIND_LIBRARY(), so the libpq.dll file is not found first (I have had trouble running QGIS when linked directly to the .dll, even though it is supposed to work) 
	+ added basic FIND_LIBRARY() call to then search default locations when all else fails.

+ in some of the *.cmake files I added the PATHS parameter keyword, which was missing from FIND_PATH()  (it is required when using certain other keywords; it is also the formal way to write the call) 

Some of the changes are inside an IF (WIN32) block, so they affect only Windows building. Some files don't have the distinction between WIN32 and UNIX, so the changes will affect all platforms.

Haven't tested on MSVC, Linux or Mac.

My recommended way to run CMakeSetup:
1. set BASE_DIRS as necessary
2. run CMake - configure
3. inspect the various ...INCLUDE and ...LIBRARY settings to see that they contain the desired values (particularly *.dll.a or *.a lib names)
4. if you find a need to change BASE_DIRS, clear the cache on next run of CMake
	Because of the way CMake operates it may be necessary to clear the cache even when changing the settings for various ...PREFIX settings.
5. make other settings, such as output location, compiler flags, etc.
6. last configure
7. OK (generate)

hm - I ran into the same problem. Why did the GUI element for chosing 
the label field disappear? Isn't it essential being able to choose the 
label attribute field? Or is it the idea that it is taken from the field 
chosen for the map tips? If this is the idea, I would object, because 
often the map tips should display different content than the labels - at 
least for my projects.

Thank you for a clarification from the GUI-team.

Best greetings,
Andreas

Message-ID: <4AFE9A55.7050201@carto.net>

Hi all,

I still don't have a mobile phone and am thinking about buying a Linux 
based smartphone now - maybe the Nokia N900 with Maemo.

Would QGIS perhaps compile on the N900/Maemo? If yes, would it be 
usuable at all with respect to processor speed and architecture and the 
GUI. I understand the N900 has a touch-screen. Would the existing QGIS 
GUI be usable with a touch-screen which is not as exact as a 
mouse-pointer? Would the touch-screen events be compatible with 
mouse-events at all for the QGIS-interface?

Lots of questions - I know. Did someone try to get QGIS running on Maemo?

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi,

At our workplace people are now starting to use Windows-based TabletPCs. 
Did someone successfully run QGIS-Windows on a Tablet PC? It would be 
mainly for road workers, and people collecting data in the field (e.g. 
collecting green-space data, road quality data, manholes/waste-water 
infrastructure, etc.)

If someone has experience with Tablet-PCs and QGIS I would appreciate if 
the lessons/problems/successes could be shared.

Hi,

I still don't have the N900 but I compiled a few things on the older Nxx
models, AFAIK, the N900 has a smaller screen and a new touchscreen, it comes
without the stadard toothpick-like pen and the new maemo interface is more
like a thumb interface than a pen interface.

That said, I successfully compiled and run the whole KDE system on N800 and
given that the processor speed on N900 is much faster, there are good
chances that QGIS will run at a decent speed on that new device.

Doubts about real usability of QGIS on such a small screen still remain.

If you want to try, there exists a ready-to-use virtual image with all cross
compilation toolchains and maemo simulator already in place.

I'm also looking forward to it - beware thoug; I have a friend who bought it >1 month
ago, and still has to receive it in his mailbox. Probably Nokia has problem in
delivering/producing/fixing it.

> Lots of questions - I know. Did someone try to get QGIS running on Maemo?

Qt should (now? soon?) run on maemo:

http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=qt+on+maemo+n900&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=UJ7-Sui5GZT0_Abz7Y2TCw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CA4QqwQwAA#

As maemo is debian-based, it should not be too difficult to compile it for the N900.
The main issue is to change the GUI in order to fit into the small display.
So, I'm also interested, maybe we can pool forces when the N900 will be really
available on the market?
All the best.

Disclaimer: I don't have this device or any experience with Maemo

>From reveiws I read and the device home page
(http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/) I get the impression that the one this
the n900 doesnt have is phone functionality so it may not fit your
requirements of being a phone. They report the resolution as being
800x 480 so we may need to perform some more dialog squishing to make
QGIS work as is on that display. Probably a better approach would be
for us to start building a src/mobile-app slimmed down version of QGIS
for use on mobile devices and with reduced feature set. Getting
something simple up and running should not really be that much work
and we could make it read .qgs files and prune the user interfaceback
to show only essential options.

Tim

Yes, that would be great. In a recent meeting gvSIG mobile attracted a lot of
attention (quite understandably), se we should keep up to pace ;)

Have you tried gvSIG mobile? I loaded it on my mobile a couple of
weeks back but it fetched no tiles and didnt seem to have any usable
functionality. Maybe I missed something...

I did not try it (I would like to finish my days without having to touch java ;) ),
but people here in Italy is using it for real work, and they seem happy.
They donated me a manual, I'll let you know what I discover.

Hi J?rgen and Tim

Thanks for your hints. From J?rgens scripts, I saw, that it is necessary to 
set the variables PYTHONPATH, PYTHONHOME and to add the path to python.exe to 
PATH.

Additionally, I found, that in OSGEO4W bin/pyuic4.bat, the path C:\Programs is 
hardcoded (should be H:\ for me). Maybe this could be changed such that there 
is no confusion for other people compiling QGIS themselves on windows.

Regards,
Marco

For your interest this is what I am heading towards with the vector,
qgis options and raster dialogs:



http://www.flickr.com/photos/38241992@N06/4102265135

The vector dialog shown here is (651 x 448) and can be shrunk further
vertically (though less visually pleasing) so would even probably work
on mobile devices as discussed on the other thread.

Thanks to all who answered so far.

Tim: the N900 is a mobile phone. Past devices for the maemo platform 
came without phone support,  but the N900 is really a phone (UMTS, GPRS, 
Edge, WCDMA, HSPA, WLAN). The N900 can also be used for tethering 
(internet connection for laptop). It also seems to support various 
connectors: USB, Bluetooth, TV out, etc. 
http://www.nokia.ch/produkte/alle-modelle/nokia-n900/funktionen 
(probably you have to switch to your local webpage)

A separate GUI for mobile devices would be great. It should have reduced 
functionality and maybe the touch-screen interface requires different UI 
approaches, because touching is not that accurate than mouse-pointers or 
pens. I think it would be useful to collect a list of expected 
functionality for mobile phones, maybe on the Wiki:

I can start here what I would expect from QGIS for smartphones:

* a usable UI for touch-screens
* basic map display and navigation
* moving map with link to GPS
* GPS recording and playback
* support for georeferenced photos and videos (the N900 has photo/video 
support)
* basic editing (mainly point features, points of interest)
* Spatialite support (for offline use)

This is just a starter ;-) but it is clear that it needs some time to 
get to a usable state.

Most of these features are already implemented in maemo-mapper.

Maemo-mapper supports:

* many web tiles systems (OSM, yahoo, VE etc.)
* WMS (with proj4)
* GPX
* POIs

 but it does not support

* other raster or vector data providers
* photos
* linestring or polygon editing


What is not still clear to me is when maemo will fully switch to QT, I'm not
sure but it seems like the version that will be shipped with N900 (who knows
when ?!!!) will still be GTK based.

Hi,

could you quantify how big is the loss of precision (expected vs.
obtained coordinates)?

Hi Marco,

On my test platform, trying to add an image to the map composer in trunk is causing a crash with a segmentation fault (no other useful output that I can see). Perhaps someone else can verify or refute this. Because I am using qt-4.6, and there are some other strange issues going on in qgis, I will hold off on submitting a bug report.

Thanks,

Hm, pyuic4.bat should be created from pyuic4.bat.tmpl when installing with the
path you installed your OSGeo4W to.  Didn't that work for you?

Hi Martin,
Actually, it depends on some still unknown factor. If i remember right I
found a 2 cm error with 100m coordinates.
Hum... my plugin is available in the comunity repository if you need to test
the snapping error. QgsAzimuth.

As many people are starting to help the plugin grow, I've started a
sourceforge project.
Now we have a simple site, a bug tracker, download section, svn code browser
and screenshots.
I hope everyone who are already helping start using the tracker section to
set desired features and open bugs so we can get a little more organized.

Actually the copyright plugin is kinda html annotation layer and I never liked 
its name ;) What about merging them together and putting into the 'Layer'

Hi Devs,
Just commited some work on mapserverexport-plugin of Stephan Meissl and 
myself to trunk.
The dialog is better for small screens, and hopefully we made stuff a 
little more intuitive. There is still a long list of TODO's, but we 
think we removed already a lot of potential small problems with it.

Let us know if you find any problems.

Paolo, asked for working 'help'-buttons. Anybody a pointer to some docs

Hi Borys,

this is actually a little side track, but I wonder that after 
'upgrading' a plugin to 'core' if it's still possible to update it via 
the wonderfull 'plugin-update'-mechanisme of you?

I really like it that I'm able to fix little bugs or annoyances in my 
plugins. It gives qgis a 'modern update function', apart from releasing 
a new version. (my plugin is not on the list, so I do not have to worry 
actualy ;-) )

Just a quick point here - the plugins under discussion are all c++ plugins and can't be updated using the plugin installer.

answering myself more on this thread:

this video here shows that one can use a stylus with the N900 maemo5. So 
we wouldn't be limited to using QGIS only with clumsy fingers, but could 
also build a GUI to be used with a stylus. A stylus would also be more 
useful than fingers for editing vector data.

See the video at:
http://qt.nokia.com/developer/qt-for-maemo-developers

You need the flash-player to watch this video ;-( had to download it for 
my machine first for being able to watch this video.

Message-ID: <1258293853.3725.155.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

we are in the middle of a course with a group of biologists and I would
like to leave here some feedback.

Attendees are using qgis trunk on both windows (xp, vista, seven) and
ubuntu linux.

Let me know if I have to open tickets for the problems here reported.

*) under windows, the postgis manager plugin still have the bug reported
here

https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1911

*) on some pcs (both linux and windows) the right-ctrl key doesn't works
while using the "node tool"

*) the "simplify feature" tool freezes/crashes windows (xp,vista,seven)
if used on small *simple* polygons in a shapefile defined in a projected
(20790) CRS and otfr on.

*) the "split feature" tool randomly freezes/crashes qgis on both linux
and windows when used on the very same features (in a projected -20790-
CRS and otfr on).

*) the "add part" tool randomly freezes/crashes qgis on both linux and
windows when used on the very same features (in a projected -20790- CRS
and otfr on).

*) the "delete part" tool works only if ones clicks on a node of the
part to be deleted. If the part is a polygon and one clicks on it, the
tool doesn't works. Same conditions as above. 

*) when zooming a lot to see a node of a polygon (same conditions as
above), qgis takes a lot to get trough it and ultimately crashes (seg

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Menu entries in trunk
Message-ID: <4B000DE4.7020707@carto.net>

Hi all,

I saw that the fTools is now called "Vector" and is placed to the right 
of the Plugins "menu".

Is it planned that the "Vector" menu moves to the left of the "Plugins" 
menu?

I think that the "Vector" menu would be better called "Vector analysis", 
since other menues also deal with vector, esp. the "Edit" menu. Maybe we 
could have a "Vector analysis" menu entry and later a "Raster analysis" 
menu. Or is it a policy that we can only use single words as a menu entry?

Thank you for discussing this issue.

Andreas

Hi Giovanni,y

Thank you for reporting the bugs/problems and sharing your experience 
with the QGIS course.

I wonder, however, if it is wise to teach a course with a trunk build? 
While trunk builds are reasonably stable, the trunk currently 
considerably changed and changes, both feature-wise and with the UI. It 
may be strange if you teach your users based on trunk - tomorrow they 
download QGIS-trunk and they find a different UI. Probably not the best 
impression. Also, the trunk is definitely not polished yet and currently 
can contain some inconsistencies.

So in my opinion it would be wiser to use QGIS mimas for courses or 
introducing new users - or at least very, very clearly state that the 
trunk is for development work not meant for production and changes on a 
almost daily basis.

Some of my users use the trunk version as well (because we urgently need 
some of the new features), but I very carefully check a nightly build 
before upgrading the machines of my colleagues for not running into 
unexpected surprises.

Just my opinion,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,
your are good points obviously. I know that is a little risky, but from
my point of view it was almost a forced choice. First the trunk has too
many new neat features that would be a shame not showing them, and
second the 1.3 version has a few nasty bugs. In particular I remember
one in vector symbology (qgis crashes). I can live with occasional
crashes and problems in brand new features (and I guess/hope that our
course attendees do understand it) but I cannot show a program that
crashes while doing a simple symbology operation. Until now users are
pretty impressed with the trunk version and common thing they say is
that they didn't imagined that was possibile to do that much with Qgis.

Cheers!

So yes :) They are upgradeable. All you need is just to upload the plugin to 
any repository you want.

But you must be aware how it works, to avoid mistakes with versioning etc.

The core plugins install in a system directory like that:
/usr/share/qgis/python/plugins 

while all repositroty plugins (including the upgrades we're talking about) in 
an user directory like:
/home/richard/.qgis/python/plugins

So if an user upgrades a core plugin, he gets in fact two instances of it: the 
'original' one, shipped with qgis and the updated one. It's because of 
permissions. The 'userspace' plugins always mask their core instances.  And 
this is _critically_important_ to always set a proper version number for both 
instances.

Let's assume, users have Qgis with MapserverExport  v 1.0. Then you upgrade it 
in Trunk to 1.1, and at the same time, upload this version into py plugins 
repository. The Installer finds it and performs upgrade by installing the 1.1 
in the 'userspace' location. It masks the original 1.0 and everything works 
ok. Great. Also after qgis recompilation, when the 'system' instance is 
upgraded, still everything is ok, as just the 1.1 masks another 1.1.

But then let's assume that you upgrade the plugin in trunk to 1.2 and forget 
to upload it into the repository. After qgis recompilation & reinstalation, 
the /usr directory contains 1.2 version and the /home/richard contains still 
the 1.1 (and there's no possibility to upgrade). Qgis detects such situation 
when loading, displays a complaining message and suggests to run the Installer 
to resolve this situation.

So, the most important are to:
- never increase the plugin version  in trunk unless you upload it also to the 
plugin repo
- always ensure there's the same version number in trunk and the plugin repo, 
in both __init__.py and repository .xml file 

Don't hesitate to ask if there's something unclear and share your ideas if you 
find this behaviour ugly :)

I see, we are in the same boat then ... with all advantages and risks 
resulting from the trunk.

I think that is fine as long as you clearly state to your course 
participants that the trunk is the development build and can sometimes 
result in unexpected surprises. I guess that after 1.4 stable that QGIS 
is mature enough for daily use without having to rely on trunk ..

Cheers,
Andreas

Actually as part of our GUI audit we will be making sure that all
dialogs have help buttons and help context id's defined and then we will
generate stub help files for all (perhaps with a placemarker note like
'please help us to create help documentation for this dialog').

As such I would ask folks to not remove help buttons when they find them
unlinked at the moment.

Hi

+1 for it to go left of plugins
-1 for changing name

Calling it 'vector' allows any vector relates functionality to be added to the menu e.g. I would like to move ogr2ogr into there.

Also for me one word menu names are nicer where possible.

Hi all,

I saw that the fTools is now called "Vector" and is placed to the right 
of the Plugins "menu".

Is it planned that the "Vector" menu moves to the left of the "Plugins" 
menu?

I think that the "Vector" menu would be better called "Vector analysis", 
since other menues also deal with vector, esp. the "Edit" menu. Maybe we 
could have a "Vector analysis" menu entry and later a "Raster analysis" 
menu. Or is it a policy that we can only use single words as a menu entry?

Thank you for discussing this issue.

Message-ID: <4B010A1B.9070000@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The GRASS toolbox has a large number of icons describing specific analyses:
https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/src/plugins/grass/modules-*
The quality of them is below our standard for other icons, even if they do their
(sometimes difficult) job of visually describing sometimes complicated analyses.
Now that we have the same analyses implemented in other plugins (fTools, Terrain,
GDAL/Raster tools, etc.), I think we should keep things tidy, and make all icons more
uniform, reusing the best ones in all situations.
Opinions? Any volunteer?
All the best.

Hi,

I have had no success in finding a place where I could give
"FEATURE_COUNT" parameter for the WMS getFeatureInfo request in QGis
1.3.0. Should I think that there is not such a control?  I can see from
my Mapserver logs that now Qgis in sending GetFeatureInfo requests
without FEATURE_COUNT and in that case WMS defaults to count=1.
However, I have overlapping polygons in the data and I would like to get
feature info from all of them.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python Error with linear referencing plugin
Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4A6E06F64CB@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hello,

I'm using linear referencing plugin developped by Martin Dobias
I get an error when I try to calibrate a new route system:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\python\plugins\linear_ref\dlgcalibrateroute.py", line 84, in onOK
log = self.calibrateRoute(line_layer, line_name, points_layer, points_name, points_measure, route_name)
File "C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\python\plugins\linear_ref\dlgcalibrateroute.py", line 221, in calibrateRoute
calibration.calibration(roads, cal_points, progdlg, log)
File "C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\python\plugins\linear_ref\calibration.py", line 177, in calibration
align_cal_points(cal_pts, roads, progdlg, log)
File "C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\python\plugins\linear_ref\calibration.py", line 217, in align_cal_points
line_pnt, line_index = nearestPoint(Point(pnt.x, pnt.y), road.points)
File "C:\Program Files\Quantum GIS Mimas\python\plugins\linear_ref\geom.py", line 164, in nearestPoint
p1 = polyline[minI]
TypeError: list indices must be integers

Version de Python :
2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)]


The error arrive at 9% process of step 4/5 "aligning calibration point"

I would like to know if the error came from data or an other reason?
I'm working with a large data set, and when I try the same action with a small subset it works...

Any help will be welcome

Thanks

Hi,

I would need access to the data you're using in order to find out the
root of your problem. Can you give me a link where to get the data?

Just tested :-) Two bugs:

1) If the render caching is enabled and I turn on the labels, the canvas is 
not being refreshed and no labels are visible until I touch (e.g. pan) it.

2) The vertex tool often doesn't work if the NG symbology is enabled. Seems 
like I need to first use any other tool to the given feature and then use the 
vertex tool.

Anyway... Congrats and greeeeat thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] OGR feature styling support in QGIS?
Message-ID: <4B01A01F.3080901@carto.net>

Hi QGIS developers,

We are planning to contract with Frank Wamerdam for a limited dxf 
reader/writer and a SVG writer for OGR. Frank is also offering OGR 
feature styling, which is useful to preserve line widths, text 
properties, text rotation, etc. OGR feature styling is f.e. supported by 
Mapserver and OpenEV, according to Frank. I wonder if you would have 
plans to eventually support OGR feature styling as well, in which case I 
would try to finance the feature styling for dxf as well. Other formats 
were feature-styling is supported in OGR are DGN and Mapinfo.

We already have data-defined styling based on attribute columns in QGIS, 
so maybe this mechanism can somehow be re-used and extended to support 
OGR feature styling as well?

See http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_feature_style.html for more details. If 
you have any specific questions on feature styling I am pretty sure that 
Frank can answer it.

Thanks for any feedback,
Andreas

Message-ID: <ceb0de270911161652y343cbfa9v95c560b7c25458d7@mail.gmail.com>

All,
Having heard nothing from my previous email as to a preference for
dealing with this issue, I created and committed a Python script to
generate unique IDs for use in the context sensitive help system.

A context id is generated from the class it is associated with (eg. QgsAbout).

Please note that this is a change in the way IDs are generated
(previous method used a Java-only solution) so existing IDs can be
reproduced using the new script. The existing IDs can remain as
is---they do not need to be changed unless a conflict occurs with a
newly generated ID (I don't anticipate this happening).

The script is in the QGIS source tree in SVN: ./scripts/context_help_id.py

A rather different approach than our hackfest, but it would be good if someone from

Hi Jukka

You are right, QGIS does not send the FEATURE_COUNT parameter at the moment. A 
possibility would be to automatically set it to the number of layers. 
Are your overlapping polygons in one layer? Then it probably also needs a 
control in the WMS dialog.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

Overlapping polygons is exactly what I have. It is an image catalogue of
all the aerial images we have and I would like to be able to query what
kind of images (year, contractor, batch) we have available from a
clicked location.

I think we should definitely allow setting custom parameters in an input line.

Hi Sam,

you can find Quantum Navigator (with installation guide) here:
http://mapserver.sk/~wonder/qnavigator/

Please note that it used to work with a historical version of QGIS
(pre-1.0) and I'm not planning to do any further updates. You might
need to do various fixes in order to get it running with a more recent
QGIS version (1.x)

Hi Gary, All,

Thank you for the script..
what about a little revolution in context help management though?

As a girl (and girls doesn't like numbers) I was thinking about renaming
context help files to the name of a particular .ui file it is connected to.
That would require changes in code calling this help file, byt maybe it is
worth it.

Having such names it would be easier to manage context help and to say which
files are missing at first glance in both directories. No need to create a
database what belongs where ;)

Having a human-like name of the context help files might encourage the
translators to improve help files when they find something unclear. They
will just know at once which dialog should be opened to check if the help is
still validate - we are changing the GUI frequently after all.

What do you think about it?
Milena

Actually we could probably even derive the dialogs with help buttons from a
helper class that implements the help slot and uses the class name (ie.
metaObject()->className()) as context.

Hi Martin,

really thanks for your effort. Here following I leave feedback after a
little time playing around with the new features. Let me know if you
want me to open tickets.

cheers!

---------------

new labels do not appear in the print composer. Then if a zoom is made
in the composer, qgis crashes (both linux and windows)

Warning: QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for
on_buttonBox_helpRequested()
terminate called after throwing an instance of
'pal::PalException::LayerExists*'
Aborted

---------------

label plugin, misses a "apply" button

---------------

if I have a color ramp of type "color brewer" made via the style
manager, and I try to make a "graduated" symbology, then qgis crashes
(both linux and windows)

Fatal: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::at: "index out of range",
file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h, line 395
Aborted

---------------

in the old symbology, after making a graduated/continuous/unique value
symbology, it is possible to select one or more symbology categories
(using ctrl and/or shift) and change their symbol details

---------------

as discussed yesterday in irc chat, it would be nice to have the chance
to import color ramps, in cpt format for example

I agree it would be easier, however it creates another data management
problem. The oriinal idea behind using a number was to make it unique
for all time. Using the class name as the seed is just a way to get
that number. If we switch to file names or class names as Jurgen
suggests, it means that developers will need to be aware of the
context help system when refactoring. If a class gets renamed, the
help file would be orphaned. The developer would have to rename all
the help files for the class (each translation) in order for the help
system to work. Using a unique ID eliminates that burden.

If the developers want to add that to their workflow than we can
change the methodology. In my experience however, this will result in
disconnects and require constant checking of each dialog to make sure
the help is still functional.

There may be other options---perhaps this discussion will start some
wheels spinning in the developer's brains :)

If numbers are retained, a simple text file with cross-reference could
be maintained. This would require infrequent updating, only when a new
dialog is added and would not need to be changed during refactoring.

Renaming is not a big deal And maybe most of the time the context help also
needs updating when the dialog is renamed - as the name is probably not the
only thing that changes.

BTW there already a mismatch in resources/context_help/contextids.txt -
QgsBookmark instead of QgsBookmark.

But my initial idea doesn't work.  You can't do slots on Non-QObjects and you
can't inherit from different QObjects.   And moc doesn't expand macros.

So I had to add following slot to all the classes:

void contextHelp() { QgsContextHelp::run( metaObject()->className() ); }

The patch is at [1].   Opinions on commiting?

Yes, renaming is not a big deal. The problem is making sure it happens
consistently when a developer or patch submitter isn't fully aware of
the context help system.

> QgsBookmark instead of QgsBookmark.

I'm not seeing any difference in those two...

Again, the class name is just a way to get a unique ID, it doesn't
matter if the class name is changed later on, the ID will still work.
You could just as easily base the hash on the current seconds since
epoch :)

I think the major load of context help is on help writers and
translators and it would be good to make life easy for them at the
expense of a little added maintenance on devs when renaming dialogs.
The dialog names dont change that often and getting things set so that
they fine doc folks can go for it makes sense to me.

So +1 from me for using help files based on dialog class names (and
Juergens patch).

I live near where the event is taking place and wouldn't mind stopping
by to hack on QGIS; unfortunately, I am pretty new to the QGIS
project, but then it is not taking place till Feburary or March so
that gives me some time to get my hands dirty working on QGIS.

Folks,

If there were other QGIS folks interested, I would be interested in QGIS work
related to GDAL and OGR at the NY sprint.

I made a few corrections to this - I was going to do some updates to it soon anyways, you beat me to it ;)  The copy on the wiki seems to be based on some other version of the document, and the trunk diff seems to be from something else, and both contain changes I remember making... odd.

A couple notes about the corrections:

- GSL - the --build configure flag does not set OSX arch flags, this is more for cross-compiling.  Using i386 or x86_64 here will mis-identify the system as a generic PC linux and very likely get some OSX-specific compilation and linking flags wrong.

- Qt - top of doc says Qt >= 4.3, so mkspec hacks not needed.

- Qgis 32 vs 64bit configuration - I don't know about the -m32 and -m64 flags.  The way I've done it is adding the standard arch flags.

- llvm - though it's said to be compatible with GCC compilation, that's "mostly", and Qt 4.5 has a mac-llvm spec, I don't know how that's recognized in configuration, I'd rather see more testing before letting it loose on the casual user.


Tim: I don't know how to generate the INSTALL file and wiki installation doc from INSTALL.t2t.  Instructions somewhere?


PS. I hope to work on cmake configuration of the Xcode project soon.  I was stalled by a HD crash this spring where I lost work in progress.  I hate redoing things.

William,

Thanks for sweeping up the crumbs I left behind. Unfortunately, you and I were both working on the t2t file this evening. I have some new comments to add about the latest qt-4.6 release candidate and Snow Leopard. The 64-bit cocoa qt seems to mostly work, clearing up the major issues that were plaguing the beta qt-4.6-cocoa. 

I still cannot figure out how to get the sip bindings working when using any variant of qt-carbon (32-bit) on Snow. I was wondering how you managed to make it work for the xcode project build. I saw some posts you had a month or so back on this issue, but I could not decipher the fix. Perhaps it only relates to xcode anyway.

The gsl stuff I hijacked from this post. Is there a better approach for specifying one or the other? CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS?

I wondered about the mkspec stuff, but did see the note you mentioned. Good riddance.

You are probably correct on the -mxx flags. That was a shot in the dark on trying to get sip bindings working in 32-bit. If you did not already, I will pull those.

llvm - you are probably right on this as well. We will keep llvm out of the picture.

Thanks for keeping a close eye on things. I am going to add some of my contextual comments, and I will send my t2t file to you, William, for review and committing if it makes sense.

Cheers,
John

Hi

Couple of things on my gdal/ogr wishlist:

- reprojection support in ogr2ogr plugin
- context menu for save as for rasters to save to any supported format (with option to choose dest srs as per vector save as menu) 
- raster on the fly reprojection support

I know some of those are tall mountains to climb but thought I would add them to the wishlist anyway...

Regards

Tim

Folks,

If there were other QGIS folks interested, I would be interested in QGIS work
related to GDAL and OGR at the NY sprint.

hi!

To be honest - I'm with Milena and her "selfspeaking" nameschema! I'm 
sure it would be easier to remember and easier to handle to all 
documentationi writers out there and also to translators.
I agree with the fact that a unique ID will (probably) never make any 
problems but as J?rgen already said. If theres something changing (Class 
Name) theres a big chance that the help file would change anyway.
Now its very hard to see which help is in which file and there has to be 
some kind of "database" to look what you are searching for. (Or you open 
every file until you find what you want).
For consistence it should be not a big deal to write a script that 
checks if for every Help(Name) a file exists..
So +1 from me for the naming after the function - and also for 
implementing the "selfnaming" Class.

regards
Werner

Hi,

I'm with Milena too. Work with human-readable names is much easier and
comfortable.
I think the dialog names don't changes often, and when name changes
then the dialog
have many changes and we need to rewrite/update many things in help.
So +1 from me for using human-readable names and for Jurgen patch

+1


this would couple nicely with a new qgis feature: if the loaded raster
is not in the crs of the project, then ask if the user wants to save a
copy of the raster in the project crs and load it instead.

Hi,

I just started working on QgsLegendInterface, so I need a little
more information: Should it be a member of QgisAppInterface (or
QgisApp) or should it be an independent interface class, just like
QgisInterface?

Further feature requests to QgsLegendInterface are welcome, as
detailed as possible. I'll give it a try.

The intention is to leave these in the menu but to remove them from the
toolbar as they are functions that are probably not used very often and
we want to reduce the size of the toolbars.

The fact that they are not working seems to be a secondary issue which I
am investigating now...

Message-ID: <4B042773.5000201@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I studied a manula for the use of gvSIG mobile, as a possible source of inspiration
for a future QGIS Mobile. I do not think it would be very difficult to produce it,
mainly we have issues with interface size (shrinking everything in a small screen).
What I found from the comparison:
- we miss a live interface with GPS (but there are a number of programs we could link to)
- we miss an export tool (from the desktop app they clip rasters and vectors to the
current window, and send the reduced data set to the mobile device, cool feature)
- digitizing may be ok as it is currently in QGIS
- main limitation they have: no tiff, only a few EPSG, few languages, and *only*
windows mobile, apparently
So, overall I think we are well placed.
All the best.

A more knowledgeable set of eyes and hands on this will be good! I tried a few things, like prepending the python binary path from ccmake with 'arch -i386', but could not find a solution.

Hi Paulo,

Maybe you could also look at this version of gvSIG Mobile:

http://gvsigmobileonopenmoko.wordpress.com/

It runs on Linux (Openmoko, Maemo, my Ubuntu laptop) and features a
fair few things that don't appear in the official gvSIG Mobile.

Also, the gvSIG Mobile developers are working on an Android port [1].
Looking forward to seeing some QGIS development in this area!

Cheers, Joseph

Strangely, I just built qgis as an i386 binary, but the installed qt, pyqt and sip are all x86_64. I get an error about sip.so being the wrong architecture (as expected). It seems that pyqt being 64-bit allows things to get picked up with cmake, despite the architecture not matching the CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386 setting.

This might shed some light on things. It seems very peculiar that I can have an i386 qgis binary running inside 64-bit qt:

file /Applications/qgis1.4.0.app/Contents/MacOS/qgis 
/Applications/qgis1.4.0.app/Contents/MacOS/qgis: Mach-O executable i386

This build is a little bit like Frankenstein, and not what I intended to do. I forgot to change my CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES to x86_64. Maybe this sheds some light on the problem, although it seems to obfuscate things in my mind.

The Qt Cocoa binaries are BOTH 32 and 64bit.  So it is possible to have i386 Qgis.

Message-ID: <B3E9BDA3-8241-4A95-8D81-747285E41B9D@gmail.com>

Carson,

In my ongoing attempt to get a python enabled qgis working on OS X Snow Leopard, I am having better success using sip and pyqt dev branches and the qt-4.6.0 release candidate. Unfortunately, an error when starting qgis is indicating a problem with fTools. Below is the text of the error. It appears like the message is cut off at the end, but that was the entirety of the message text in the pop-up window. Any ideas on this?

Couldn't load plugin fTools due an error when calling its classFactory() method

Traceback (most recent call last):

Hi

my preference is that there will be a new method e.g.
legendInterface() in QgisInterface which will return the pointer to
QgsLegendInterface. And QgsLegend will implement this interface.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Support for (wrong) GEOCOVER projection for S
	hemisphere in qgis
Message-ID: <4B044FFA.20801@gmail.com>

The global set of Landsat images on GEOCOVER
https://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/mrsid.pl
is on UTM/WGS projection
but with the Southern hemisphere tiles as UTM zones in the N with
negative coordinates. For example, a tile that should be at 18S is
actually 18N with negative coordinates
("Non-standard UTM definition: For the southern hemisphere, the GeoTiff files
   contain positive zone numbers with negative northing coordinates")
https://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/docs/GeoCover_circa_2000_Product_Description.pdf

As we have some vector layers on geographic coordinates WGS84 and a Geocover 
tile for 18S,
I've set the project as 18S, enabled CRS reprojection on the fly, and set
the raster CRS to 18N. Unfortunately, QGIS does not display the raster, even
selecting zoom to layer extent. (Using Mimas).

This is probably not a problem of QGIS, the Geocover projection is just wrong,
but would like to know if there could be a way to circumvent this problem to
be able to use GEOCOVER tiles of the S hemisphere within QGIS.
A way could be making a world file with the Georeferencer plugin, but perhaps
there is a more general way.

Thanks

Hi William,

I tried building trunk the past several days, and have run into the following problem on each try.

OK, looks like I had checked this a while back, and the only workaround I found that works is a bit ugly.

The SIP/PyQt checking code in cmake tries to run python, as found by cmake, and import SIP/PyQt.  It's supposed to accept a compound command, so it should be possible to set PYTHON_EXECUTABLE to "arch -i386 /usr/bin/python2.6", but I could not get that to work.

So, ugly hack:

sudo cat >/usr/local/bin/python32 <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
exec arch -i386 /usr/bin/python2.6 \${1+"\$@"}
EOF

Massimo is having the same problem.  I haven't installed Qt 4.6, so I can only guess at the problem.  It appears that libQtUiTools does exist, so I wonder if it has the right architectures?

file /usr/lib/libQtUiTools.a

if only 32bit, then either nokia messed up their distribution, or they didn't intend libQtUiTools (and maybe also libQtCLucene) to be linked into end-user binaries.

That looks ok.

Ooohhhhh!

sdk problem - because for whatever dumb reason, these Qt libs are installed in /usr/lib, instead of /usr/local/lib (they put their mkspecs in /usr/local, why not libs and programs?).  Then, when using a system SDK, they're not found because they don't exist in the SDK.

Add a symlink to them in /usr/local (they'll be found in all SDKs and they're safe from deletion by Xcode updates):

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libQtUiTools.a /usr/local/lib/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libQtCLucene.dylib /usr/local/lib/


another update for the INSTALL doc...

Theory of the Universe

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

Possibly a Qt version issue, though without the last bit of the error 
message its hard to know. I don't suppose anything is being printed to a 
console (debug mode)?
In the mean time, you can disable the about dialog by changing line 47 
of your fTools.py file from (untested):
import doReProject, doSpatialJoin, doSubsetSelect, doSumLines, 
doVectorGrid, doAbout
to:
import doReProject, doSpatialJoin, doSubsetSelect, doSumLines, 
doVectorGrid#, doAbout
and line 241 from:
    QObject.connect( self.ftools_aboot, SIGNAL("triggered()"), 
self.doaboot )
to:
    #QObject.connect( self.ftools_aboot, SIGNAL("triggered()"), 
self.doaboot )

Otherwise, we need to figure out exactly what that error message is saying?

Good catch. I have wondered why they drop some stuff (any stuff!!!) in /usr/bin and /usr/lib rather than /usr/local.

Hi Carson,

Editing the .py file allows it to load and so far so good. I did a table join, but not much else.

I cannot think of a way to get the entire message on the dialog screen. Debug mode does not dump a message to the console. Any other suggestions?

Message-ID: <32836.193.246.86.39.1258625630.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

I am playing around with the new label engine from Martin. It seems to be
very promising. It works fine for linear features.

However, whenever I try to label an area feature, QGIS crashes, both on
the Windows nightly build, but also with the SVN version on Linux Ubuntu,
64bit. QGIS immediately crashes after I hit the OK button.

Does labeling of area features work for other people?

----------

I get the following message on the console:

Warning: Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

terminate called after throwing an instance of
'pal::PalException::FeatureExists*'
Aborted

-------------------

If this also fails for other people I will do a bug report.

Andreas

Soon I'd like to put the labeling plugin into core and integrate the
settings within vector layer properties dialog, so it will get the
"apply" button there.

Actually this is possible only in unique value symbology.
Is this necessary in symbology-ng? You can set the symbol properties
before doing the classification.

Hi Martin,

Actually I was wrong - I apologize. I investigated further. It is only one
layer that causes the crash, other layers seem to work fine.

I have all my data in Postgis, including the one that causes the crash. I
then tried to save the specific Postgis layer to an ESRI shapefile. After
that I could label the polygons fine from the shapefile.

Then I checked the Postgis table against empty or invalid geometries with
the ST_IsEmpty() and ST_IsValid() Postgis functions - I didn't see any
empty or invalid geometries.

I will make the Postgis table available on my server tonight for testing.
I wonder what is wrong with this specific table.

Thank you,
Andreas

The "feature exists" exception suggests that there are two features
with the same ID, but I'm wondering how this could happen...

Message-ID: <59725.193.246.86.39.1258647209.squirrel@webmail.carto.net>

Hi,

Now that we have the new symbology and label placemente in trunk I'd like
to discuss how we can proceed adding in the missing features, mainly the
ones that were present with the old symbology and label placement.

It is mainly related to units (one should be able to choose between map
units and pixels everywhere) and data driven properties, where the
symbolization is taken from an attribute columen, e.g. (font-size,
font-color, fill and stroke-color, etc.). It would even be great to have
complex multi-layer lines based on several attributes.

What I need most urgently is data-driven coloring (fill/stroke/font color)
and unit support everywhere.

I don't expect Martin to do all the work - we have a support contract with
J?rgen (Norbit) and/or Marco, so maybe some of the work could be split up?

Thanks for discussing how we can organize the adding of the missing bits
in the new symbology. Should I compile a list of what is missing for our
use cases?

Andreas

That might depend on whether I can get the MSYS/MinGW build I started
working on during the hackfest to work out well. My goal is to get that
working by the time we start packing 1.4. Steve Mizuno sent me some
instructions on how he's doing it and your welcome to join in or little
group to help work out a repeatable process.

Thanks,

Great Alex, I would be interested in testing/reproducing it. I've tried a
lot in the past, then I switched to Linux and I got off the track. Now I'm
back on Windows (mostly) and would be interested into recap the steps to
build qgis+grass indipendently by osgeo4w.
What about QGis? Are you making MSVC builds? Are you using the prebuilt
stuff (Qt, Python, etc) from OSGeo4w? Ok, enough questions :)

bye,
giovanni

Marco,

You've been reading my mind. I was thinking of this exact feature yesterday. Thanks for adding this quite helpful function to the ever-improving composer!

A couple of quick comments:

1) The Shape outline color and shape fill color are redundant with the Frame color and Background color options if using a rectangle fill. Are the frame and background color options needed at all?
2) The Background color options do not appear to do anything for me, so perhaps need to be removed from the ui, or made functional assuming there is an interest for a background fill behind an ellipse or triangle.
3) The opacity setting is non-functional.
4) It would be ideal if the user could set opacity for the shape outline and/or fill.

Thanks,
John

On a similar vein, the new rotation options are very useful also. Perhaps a rotation option could be added for legend items also?

(I'll try this again in plain text)

I have published the GPS plugin to my plugin repository at:
http://www.mappinggeek.ca/QGISPythonPlugins/Bobs-QGIS-plugins.xml. This
was built using the QGisTrackGps plugin as a starting point.
Anyways, this is available for use in QGIS on Windows now and I'd
appreciate it if people would give it a try and provide me with
feedback.

If you are using the plugin with a standalone (non OSGEO4W) version of
QGIS then you probably will have to download and install the <b>Python
for Windows extensions library from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/ . The OSGEO4W seems to
have this library built in.

right

actually this feature (the ability to style part of the classification
categories at the same time, after applying the unique value symbology)
was added just a few months ago in the qgis symbology and I found it
pretty useful. I would like to see the same option to style group of
categories also available in the new symbology, but obviously this is
just my opinion ;)

Are you planning any significant improvement on the tickets registered in

The support for different units (with correct output in composer),
data-driven symbol properties and transparency support are on top of
my to-do list. These ones are probably the missing pieces to get new
symbology in parity (feature-wise) with the original implementation.
(Or is there missing anything more I've forgotten?)

However after the merge I'd like to switch myself to bugfixing mode
and make sure the implementation is robust enough for daily usage. So
in case you want the above mentioned features in near future, it's a
good idea to contract some of the devs to do the work.

Soon I'd like to start a wiki page about new symbology that would
summarize its state - implemented, proposed, in-progress features and
anything more that's connected with implementation (example code,
design docs, ...)

You can prepare such a list - to get a better view of what's missing.

Hi Agus.
We paln to keep on improving the tool (in fact a bug has been closed, and
one is underway), but please consider that we have no funding dedicated to
this, so things may go slower than we would like (and yes, some
contributions would help speeding it up!).
All the best

True, the non-functional background color and transparency is a bug. Should be 
fixed in r12204

For uniformity of item handling, I'd like to leave the background / frame 
options for composer shapes. It could however be an option that they are 
transparent white by default.

Agreed. I'm going to add that soon. Also I'm planning to make an item for 
arrows in composer soon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] drop-down list for basic shape tools?
Message-ID: <200911201453.10731.marco@hugis.net>

Hi all

For the function to draw basic shapes in composer, there is currently one 
button, and after dragging the initial rectangle in composer, user selects if 
it should be an ellipse, a rectangle or a triangle (probably more in future).

Another approach, suggested by Andreas, is to have a button for each shape 
type, such that user selects the shapetype before dragging the rectangle. This 
is closer to what most CAD programs do. The buttons could then be in a drop-
down list in composer.

What is your opinion? I remember we already had a discussion where people 
where against drop-down list because of useability. On the other hand, there 
are already two drop-down lists in composer.

Thanks for your feedback,
Marco

The data browser (code named GeoNibble at present) currently has the
following features:
* Browse directory tree
* Preview supported raster and vector layers
* Zoom and pan preview images
* View metadata for raster and vector layers
* Drag and drop support, including drop on QGIS

A screenshot can be seen here: http://picasaweb.google.com/shermange/GNDB

The browser is written in Python (PyQt) and requires the bindings for
QGIS and GDAL/OGR. It is in early stages of development but functions
pretty well as a data browser/preview/launcher.

It is now working.

That makes sense. In that respect, you should change the legend item ui to say "General Options" instead of the current "Item Options for consistency.

That is a great idea as well. Might I suggest that it have the flexibility to create lines with arrow options for either end? Perhaps this was already your thinking. That way, the user can create arrows or generalize them to serve as simple lines to possibly highlight a separation or something else on the map without having an arrow on the end. Of course, the ability to create curved lines with a bezel tool would be nice, but perhaps too complex.

One other enhancement that would be nice would be the ability to set columns for legends. It is currently possibly to create multiple legends and use item subsets to create pseudo-columns, but doing it directly in a single legend item would be preferable.

As always, I am very impressed with the composer and your exceptional work and dedication. I don't want you to think that there is any lack of satisfaction on my part. I'm just trying to throw out ideas as they come to mind.

Cheers,
John

Sort of---but it's meant to be a data browser for locating and
optionally loading data into QGIS (or anything else that supports drag
and drop). Not intended to duplicate QGIS functionality...

Hi Bob.
Why not adding it to standard repo?

So much easier to distribute it.

Yes, I understand this is not about duplication. I agree that
Cataloguing/Previewing/Managing and Editing/Analysis capabilities are
logically separable into two interdependent products. We've been discussing it for a

Yes, please do. I have run into this and it may be a challenge for an inexperienced user to figure this out. Same for kml files.

Hi all.
I have users that suggested having a "unselect all" button could be useful: sometimes
analyses are run, and it can be boring running them only to discover that we have one
of the layers with a selection applied, and we ran the analysis on the selection only.
Going through all the layers and unselecting each require 2-3 clicks for each layer,
so it's a bit cumbersome.

I actually think it's a great idea for another reason. When I'm testing
WMS and other web feeds if one breaks and the map reloads I get an error
message, but sometimes I have more than 1 and I get an error message for
each one as I try to turn them all off.

Hmm, now that I think about it is there a pause rendering button so that
you can do a whole bunch of layer rearranging without it trying to
render after each little move until you're ready?

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <1258748806.4042.2.camel@sibirica>

Hi all, seems to have still a little problem with render caching (even
if disabled) after using the field calculator.

To replicate:

add a layer, use the field calculator do some kind of column operation,
toggle editing to save changes. Starting from now things goes wild, as
feature selection, toggle editing on, etc. all works only after a
refresh of the map.

Tested with trunk on both linux and windows.

What about naming like
123456789_this_part_for_human

First part - constant length for IDs (easy to parse and link)
second - variable length for translators

It's a done deal---the patch has been applied and human readable class
names are now used for the translation files.

Hi Andreas,

Tim said you were the resident svg guru. I have been running into problems with svg images I have created in Inkscape coming through garbled when rendered in qgis. Tim mentioned a minisvg spec, but I cannot find anything on that from a google search.

Is there a means to output svg files from Inkscape or some other for of conversion to make svg files meet the requirements of qgis?

Thanks,
John

Hi John

In src/app/qgsoptions.cpp:

    285 #ifdef Q_WS_MAC //MH: disable incremental update on Mac for
now to avoid problems with resizing
    286   groupBox_5->setEnabled( false );
    287 #endif //Q_WS_MAC


Which explains why it behaves like it does for you....

I think this is a good option: not a qgis plugin but a separate application.
It's not just a matter of geting names and geographic positions, metadata
makes the catalog a complex tool.
Looking forward to it (and to see it fulfilling INSPIRE directives, so that
remote catalogues can be searched and browsed)
Are planing to include a metadata editor?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] segfault python: no catch for QgsException?
Message-ID: <4B0836DF.5070700@duif.net>

Hi devs,

in the mapserverexport plugin we want the user to be able to load 
another project into QGIS to export:

qgisProjectFile = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self.dlg, "Choose a 
QGIS 			Project", ".", "QGIS Project Files (*.qgs);", "...")
     try:
       QgsProject.instance().read(QFileInfo(qgisProjectFile))
     #except QgsException, err:
     except:
       QMessageBox.information(self.dlg, "Not a valid QGIS projectfile.")
       return

While we do filter the view on *.qgs files, it's still possible that the 
user just fills in an excisting NON-qgs-project file.

On the 'read'-call of this (off course) wrong file, qgis halts fiercely 
with:
"
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'QgsException'
   what():  Project file read error: error occurred while parsing 
element at line 1 column 1 for file /home/richard/temp/foo.jpg
Aborted
"

Questions:

- neither the "except QgsException:" nor 'except:" seem to catch the 
exception? Doing someting wrong there? Missing Python interface?

- Isn't it possible to catch this exception? (doing exact the same thing 
via the normal (non python way) 'open project'-dialog, the exception is 
caught: "Project file read error: error occurred while parsing element 
at line 1 column 1 for file /home/richard/temp/foo.jpg"

- shouldn't we load qgs-projects via the python interface? (for valid 
qgs-files it's working ...).

- one option would be to disable the possibility of setting the path by 
keyboard in QFileDialog, but I have to find out how to do that ...

All on QGIS trunk on ubuntu

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <20091121.194910.10859.0@webmail23.vgs.untd.com>

Alex,

Over the past week I have been trying to compile QGIS using the latest MinGW with gcc 4.4.0 (I was using gcc 3.4.5 previously). I found 2 errors and 1 warning which I was able to resolve. I expect to file a trac ticket on these in the next day or two when I have finalized the details.  The affected files are: qgssearchstringparser.yy, pal.h, and main.cpp.

I also was compiling using Windows Vista and Windows 7 and have been successful with both platforms. I really didn't expect to have any major problems. The only problem so far is that patch (in MSys console) appears to hang, but this isn't necessary for compiling, just for applying patches.

I have not yet tried to include Python or GRASS in building QGIS.

More extensive testing of the executable is still to be done.

Later,
Steve

That's great news, I haven't had a change to try your notes out yet but
hope to get to it this next week. Last I remember I got stuck on a proj
error but had everything up until that.

Note, you will run into an issue with the Python Cmake file as it only
checks for MSVC when looking for a .bat file vs .sh, and it needs to
actually check for WIN32 or for both MSVC and MINGW. I will file a
ticket/fix for that so someone can verify it.

Thanks,
Alex

I've just found this quite old email - why not to open a ticket on trac?
Probably nobody has a spare time to work on it at the time, but it's worth to 
save the idea. We could even implement a mapserver provider in the future.

Hi John,

Can you be more specific on what "garbled" means? Does it mean that text 
elements are broken? Or other elements as well? Can you provide an example?

Yes, there are a few problems with proper SVG support in QGIS. Here is a 
summary:

* Import in print composer or symbols:
   - qt only supports the limited SVG tiny format 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/). This means as an example that text 
elements do not support <tspan/> childs with a delta y.

* Export from print composer:
   - No clipping/masking of map-data to the map boundaries. Workaround: 
after import in Inkscape, Illustrator or Corel, add a rectangle and 
change it into a rectangular mask and apply them to map group
   - Symbols are exported as raster instead of vector
   - structure of export SVG could be improved and id's could be added 
to better understand the document tree of the output
   - some unnecessary elements are exported.ex

What I can recommend is:
- use the newest Inkscape version (0.47) and avoid multiline text
- save as "Optimized SVG" and not "Inkscape SVG" to keep the filesize 
smaller. Optimized SVG means that the output runs through SVG scour
- in the Inkscape preferences -> SVG output enable the checkbox "inline 
attributes"
- optionally run the output manually through SVG scour (a python 
commandline script) for additional manual optimization 
(http://www.codedread.com/scour/)

Inkscape 0.47 contains Scour, but offers only limited commandline 
switches, not complete control over scour as you can get with the 
commandline version of scour.

Meanwhile I will see if I can extend scour to solve the issue of 
multiline text with tspans. I can't promise when, though ...

Hope this helps,
Andreas

Hi all,

I noticed that is already possible to remove columns from the attribute
table of a shapefile trough the "table manager" plugin but not with the
standard qgis tools (buttons in the attribute table and in the
"attributes" tab os the vector properties).

Is this on purpose?

Yes.  OGR doesn't support deletion of fields.  Table manager copies the table.

Hi all,
more feedback after two more days of qgis/grass course.

All went quite smoothly, except for who used Vista/Seven where the
problems were quite a lot.

Not in a particular order:

*) diagram overlays -> after creating an overlay, if a user changes the
type of graphic, all the definitions are reset. Very annoying for
graphics made of many categories

*) suggestion -> show map units in qgis dialogs/plugins where
applicable 

*) https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1945 confirmed and pretty annoying

*) Vista/Seven -> many crashes when removing layers from legend when
working with the grass toolbox

*) r.null -> crashes Vista and Seven

*) r.colors.* -> crashes Vista and Seven

*) v.db.addcol -> users really don't like to add by hand data types and
they don't understand why after adding the column they need to
remove/add again the vector to see the changes in the attribute table


cheers

Carson,

With qt-4.6 built from the git repository, all is well. This must have been a bug that was fixed in the qt code.

Thanks,

Hi Borys

I had a discussion about that topic, together with Martin and Tim, at the 
hackfest (based upon a follow-up patch from Mathias):

Currently, it is possible to derive plugin specific maplayers from QgsMapLayer. 
However, there are two problems:
- A few places in core code where maplayer types 'vector' and 'raster' are 
hardcoded (but that can be removed easily)
- When reading from a project file, it is necessary to create the proper plugin 
maplayer type. Martin suggested to have a registry in core where plugins may 
register functions to create the plugin specific layer types. That way, it 
would also be assured that the plugin is loaded (or possibly it could be 
loaded dynamically). I think this is a very good solution.

So it would be very welcome if someone takes up this idea to add support for 
plugin specific layers.

Regards,
Marco

Hi list,

While implementing QgsLegendInterface for the Python API, I ran into
another problem: QgsLegend inherits from QTreeWidget, which inherits
from QObject. As QgsLegendInterface should have signals and slots, it
should inherit from QObject, too. When QgsLegend implements
QgsLegendInterface, I get the diamond problem: Both,
QgsLegendInterface and QTreeWidget inherit from QObject. How should I
handle that? Up to now, there are three possibilities:

1. QgsLegendInterface inherits from QTreeWidget and QgsLegend only
implements QgsLegendInterface. Not a very nice solution, and the
members of QTreeWidget would be exposed to the python scripter.

2. QgsLegendInterface is a "wrapper" class for QgsLegend. It holds a
pointer to the QgsLegend and inherits from QObject.

3. Split up QgsLegend, so the part that doesn't inherit from
QTreeWidget could implement QgsLegendInterface. QgsLegend is a huge
class, so it would be a lot of work to do that.

Do you have any other solutions? Or could you recommend one of the above?

Regards
Andres

Dear All,

when you add a layer with the command addMapLayer, this layer is 
loaded at the top of the stack.
is it possible to set the position of the layer we want to load?
is it possible to load it at the bottom of the stack?

Do someone know how to solve it?

Thank you Michele.

Message-ID: <4B0A54F7.2020701@terrestris.de>

Hi devs,

over at the QGIS IRC channel the great python plugin GeoFeeds was 
recommended to me to import GeoRSS feeds into QGIS 
(http://logs.qgis.org/slogs/%23qgis.2009-11-20.log, look for marcster). 
AFAIK the plugin currently handles points and polygons... but not lines.

As I wasn't able to find out who the plugin author is, I am posting the 
following wish to the dev list (in the hope that the original developer 
will read it):

Is it possible to enhance the plugion to also read line features?

Testdata is here:
http://www.webmapcenter.de/tmp/tour-lines.xml (That link will be gone in 
roughly a month or so)

Thanks in advance
Marc


PS: Is it possible to add a feed with different Geometrytypes?

PPS: I really love QGIS! Just wanted you to know :-)

Michele,

You need define QgsMapCanvasLayer, after use QgsMapCanvas::setLayerSet  
with list of layers.

I make this for in my plugin "Image show or hide" (user-contributed  in 
"http://www.pyqgis.org/" )

Obs: when change the order layer set (QgsMapCanvas::setLayerSet) the 
legend continue with old oder.

The code below add layer (Raster Layer, use for setNoDataValue) in 
bottom stack (copied by plugin)

  def __getListCanvasLayer(self):
    # Return : List of QgsMapCanvasLayer with change visible toggle layer
    # dicLyrs -> Key = LayerId , Value = Layer
    dicLyrs = core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().mapLayers()
    # List of layers in legend
    lstLyrIdLegend = self.__mapCanvas.mapRenderer().layerSet()
    lstReturn = []
    for lyrId, lyr in dicLyrs.iteritems():
      isVisible = True
      if lstLyrIdLegend.indexOf(lyrId) == -1:

Hi Andres

I would prefer solution 2. This approach is used also for
QgisInterface and its implementation QgisAppInterface. It has a lot of
flexibility - even for cases where e.g. legend widget is interchanged
with a model/view pattern.

Hi Richard

what QGIS version is that? Here on svn trunk I get just a message box
with the error message and no crash - supposedly thanks to a last
resort try...catch block in QgsApplication.

The exceptions are not recognized in Python because they're not
wrapped in SIP. Barry had a similar problem few months ago:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2009-January/005887.html

I still think we should remove usage of exceptions from QGIS codebase
- either to make the API simpler and also more Qt-like. But someone
would have to do it :-)

Loading projects should be possible in python, no reason not to allow it...

Or eventually prior to opening the file in QGIS you could check
whether it exists and it's readable (i.e. try to open it).

Garbled, meaning text elements being overlayed with black boxes, text not wrapping. Also, a couple of complex svg's traced from raster images were showing lines shooting off to the side, misplaced, etc. Before I send a sample, I will try the suggestions below.

Yes, I think this is the source of my problems, hence the interest in an open source means of SVG tiny creation.

This is good information to know.

Yes, this is definitely a source of some of the problems I have seen.

Maybe I should write that I am compiling latest SVN trunk. Today's nightly build is still broken with same

I see. Hopefully the patch will be applied soon(?), it is one year old.

Meanwhile, why not using the table manager approach in qgis?

Hi John

Thanks for your feedback.
It is now possible to set the transparency values for fill/outline in the color 
dialog.

As a first step, I plan to add the choice to have no arrow marker, a hardcoded 
predefined arrow marker or the possibility to specify svg files as marker.

Curved lines are a good idea too, but I leave that for future implementations.

Marco

Message-ID: <1432914127.20091124085214@gis-lab.info>

Hi all,

We decided to throw another QGIS related event - bug hunt in Moscow.
The event is aimed at QGIS newbies. We're expecting 20-30
people in two big groups, one real and one virtual on our IRC. We're
going use our forum as a board for keeping track of bugs, which then will be
sorted, translated, cleaned up and put on qgis bugtracker.

We gonna focus on really small, reproduceable bugs, but there
is an idea to brainstorm a little for suggestions as well.

The event will be fast and furious, we're expecting to chain everyone
to notebooks for 3 hours. Not sure what method are we gonna use for
IRC gang yet, but we'll come up with something.

If you have any suggestions where to focus efforts (like missing help
buttons on every form etc.) that require some tedious checking work -
this is good time to suggest.

Of course everyone on the list is welcome to join, especially if you
speak ruso.

Maxim

PS: We're expecting everyone to come and there are no funds, but you
will finally see bears on the Moscow streets ;) Tim, we suppose you
better rest at home, as the country is a disaster after what happened
in World Cup qualifiers, you may drown in a river of tears :)

Hey guys



Great idea - I will be posting an email out this weekend with release
plan for 1.4 so your bug hunt will be great timing!


I'll try to be online on IRC a little during the bugfest to cheer you
on from the sidelines :-)

Regards

Tim

svn trunk ...
doing it with r12220 or 12214, not sure which tree I used ...
Both as a plugin and in the python console Qgis just crashes when I do

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
try:
QgsProject.instance().read(QFileInfo('/home/richard/temp/test.dbf'))
except:
	print 'FOUT'  # dutch for 'ERROR' :-)

after I read a valid project into qgis first...

Removing exceptions? ... How would you handle stuff like above then (or 
do I sound very old-fashioned now ;-) ). Seriously, does Qt have an 
alternative for this?
If there is a good alternative, we could make it a task for people who 
want to start cpp (like me and Werner...) maybe?

Yep, I know doing

from xml.dom import minidom
try:
	minidom.parse(unicode('/home/richard/temp/foo.dbf'))
except:
	print 'FOUT'  # dutch for 'ERROR' :-)

will gracefully fail, without a crash, so I think I will do that first, 
before trying to read the file ....

Thanks,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] problem with on the fly reprojection with trunk
Message-ID: <1259101653.3962.15.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,
I'm seeing a problem with otfr and trunk on both linux and windows. On
qgis 1.3 it works fine, but I'm pretty sure it worked fine also on trunk
until a few days ago.

Take two vector layers with different crs, define the project crs and
enable on the fly reprojection. 

Try now "zoom to layer extent", it works only if the layer has a crs
that matches the project crs, otherwise nothing show in the canvas.


cheers

Marco,

I am hesitant to say this is a bug because I am on my qt-4.6 build, but legend items cannot be removed for me currently. The 'X' button does not do anything, nor does hitting the delete key (not sure if that worked in the past or not).

I've made some changes to have callout labels with traditional(old) labels
engine. 
This is very useful to prepare printable nice looking maps. 
I think this code will be useful. 

I think there is a tool to move labels needed (tool will write label's
position to an attribute table's fields) to make work with labels more
comfortable. But, maybe, some will advise more powerful solution. 

Ready to discuss it.

Message-ID: <4B0CD823.9000507@wildintellect.com>

For some reason if I install 1.3 from packages and then go and build
trunk with a prefix of /home/myuser/apps/, right after make install my
1.3 version starts getting the following error. Note that a simple make
uninstall takes the system back to the way it was no python errors on
1.3 start. To me it seems like after the trunk install 1.3 is somehow
reading something it shouldn't be, but what might that be.

It's not really a bug but I would love to be able to test things in
trunk as they come while maintaining a working version for work.
Ubuntu 9.04, Ubuntugis repos

Hi all

This is fixed now (r12246).

It was a broken connection from the gui changes (that otherwise improved the 
useability a lot).

Thanks for the quick fix. It was a lot slower hand editing my qgs file to remove legend elements. The delete button is much more convenient. ;-)

Message-ID: <57E533F9-B9C8-44E6-AADB-0FFBA9FEB9B1@gmail.com>

Hi Marco,

I just tried the arrow tool. Unfortunately, it puts a white overlay on the entire composer canvas. Either that, or it causes some redraw issues with the composer canvas. On my test, I drew a line on a blank canvas. The line is shown while drawing. Once I release the mouse button, the composer screen goes white (no page outline or anything is shown).  I cannot delete the arrow item from the canvas.

OS X with qt-4.6, etc. Again, perhaps this is a qt issue.

Regards,
John

I confirmed this as another Qt-4.6 bug/issue. Please disregard.

I've switched back to 4.5.3 now. Too many problems with 4.6. That should reduce the number of false bugs coming from me.

Developers Group,

I have developed my PyQGIS application using OSGeo4W 1.0 Kore python 2.5 bindings for win32.  I have a method that loads vector layers (ogr's shapefiles) and another method that loads rasters (png's with pgw's) to my canvas. Both work nice but loading either layer replaces the other and biceversa. The idea is that the raster stays below the shapefile as if the raster was the background... like it happens in the Stand Alone QGis when loading multiple vectors and rasters using the buttons... My question is: is there a command line that I am missing? or could the problem be my canvas background color? below are my two methods in their simplest way:


def MyRasterLoad(self, file, fileName):
        """Load any raster layer specifying its file string"""
        layer = QgsRasterLayer(file, fileName)
        if not layer.isValid():
            return
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
        self.canvas.setExtent(layer.extent())
        cl = QgsMapCanvasLayer(layer)
        layers = [cl]
        self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers)


def MyWorldLoad(self, file, fileName, ext=bool):
        """add the base map layer and zoom to its extent or add graticule for the delimited area"""
        layer = QgsVectorLayer(file, fileName, "ogr")
        if not layer.isValid():
            return
        symbols = layer.renderer().symbols()
        symbol = symbols[0]
        symbol.setFillColor(QColor.fromRgb(0,100,0))
        QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer);
        if ext == True:
            self.canvas.setExtent(layer.extent())
        if ext == False:
            rect = QgsRectangle(float(self.x_min), float(self.y_min), float(self.x_max), float(self.y_max))
            self.canvas.setExtent(rect)

Angelica,

Try replacing:

layers = [cl]
self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers)

With:

layers = self.canvas.mapRenderer().layerSet()
layers.insert(0,cl)
self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers)

This way you keep the current layers already loaded and then add a new
layer.  This only addresses getting them both loaded, but would require that
the raster is loaded first and the vector second to get the affect you are
after.  If you want to re-order the layers you need to re-order the
layerset.

Hope that helps...

Aaron, thanks for your answer,

I tried the replacement you recommended and got a Type error (cl must be QStringList type), then I tried correcting the issue with the following in the vector layer method:

 cl= QgsMapCanvasLayer (layer)
layers = list (self.canvas.mapRenderer ( ).layerSet ( ) )
 layers.insert(0, cl)
self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers)

And I got no error message for the Vector layer method any more, but I did the same correction in the same part of the raster layer method and when using it, I'm getting that the argument in 
 self.canvas.setLayerSet(layers) has an invalid type. Could you please tell me what's wrong? I was thinking I may have to make "layers" a global variable and call it from my raster method to keep inserting in it... but it doesn't have the type I'd need to do so... I'm not quite understanding how this "appending" of layers works...     :-|

I need to upload the vector first because it is the base map, then add the raster, and then I do have to reorganize my layers as you said when I get the layerset ok, thank you.

Thanks a lot,
Angelica.

Does someone already work on this?

If not, I can do it, because I need this functionality pretty soon. The idea 
was to port the gps related parts of the qgis-mapper plugin (gather plugin) 
and ev. parts of Bobs plugin to C++ (with QextSerial instead of the python 
serial classes).

Marco

Hi, If you toggle editing on vector linestring layers you see circles above
nodes and vertexes of that layer.

I've seen the function ToggleEditing in the qgisapp.cpp, but I cannot find
the code that draws those circles.

Which row are they?

Answering myself:

in the core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp near end of QgsVectorLayer::drawLineString
function.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

You can define self.layers on __init__ method this way:

*self.layers = []*

And then just add every new layer:

*self.layers.insert( 0, QgsMapCanvasLayer( newLayer ) )
self.canvas.setLayerSet( self.layers )*

Would it be possible to get the Python for Windows extensions included
with the future installers of QGIS in the included Python install? This
would allow for working with serial ports via the pyserial module much
easier.

Currently I have to install these extensions separately and when there
is a version difference with a system install of Python then that has to
be uninstalled and the version that is the same as the one packaged with
QGIS has to be installed first.

Thanks,

The problem with "Capture From Map Canvas" is
that you need 2 canvas, unless both the original and the reference 
objects are
be very close. The Georeferencer plugin opens the raster to be
processed in a special window, but that window does not
let you display a vector. Perhaps that would be enough, a window
such as the one in Georeferencer but for vectors.

By now, I'm going to try using Coordinate capture twice, once for the
vector to be warped and the other for the reference object. Then
input both sets of coordinates into R and calculate
the affine transformation matrix there. Then I can either
go on with the actual transformation in R (package spatstat)
and then export to QGIS (this is comfortably done thanks to
manageR) or use your plugin.

Forgot to mention that a panel in which the parameters
could be entered both as you have them and ordered as the
affine transformation matrix would be appreciated by
most users. I think this is how ArcView has it (I do not
use it myself). I find this document useful:

Hi Robert and all.
Icons added to GDAL tools (also, some bugs have been fixed, and new features
implemented). Only grid is missing - I guess we should use the same icon also for the
other interpolation plugin (C++ by Marco) - the one currently used for that plugin is
difficult to understand IMHO.
All the best.

Hi guys,
I'm Giuseppe Sucameli and I working for Faunalia on GdalTools-plugin.

I want to set up the last used directory for reading and saving, but I've
looked in qgis code, there is no a standard setting for all plugins.
So, i can use a plugin scope setting, but it's most useful discuss it to find
the better solution.

What do you think about?

Hi Giuseppe,

this is for python plugins yes?

if so, I had a similar question during the hackfest in Vienna for the 
mapserverexport plugin. We wanted to remember last path for map-file, 
size etc etc during sessions.

The answer then was: do it using QSettings:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qsettings.html#details

There are different ways for using it, but different plugins use it 
already (I do grep -ir qsettings * now in my .qgis dir):
Plugin_installer
postgis_manager
We use it in the mapserverexport plugin like this:
see: 
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/python/plugins/mapserver_export/mapserverexport.py

# ok succesfull: write some setting for a next session
settings = QSettings()
# mapfile name
settings.setValue("/MapserverExport/mapfileName",QVariant(self.dlg.ui.txtMapFilePath.text()))

and to read from it:
settings = QSettings()
rememberedval = settings.value("/MapserverExport/mapfileName", 
QVariant("")).toString ()

As said, there are other way to use it to see
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qsettings.html#details

Good Luck,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

yes, in this moment I'm using the QSettings class (i've find it into
qgis code :P), but my question is if use a specific setting name.

In this moment, for the last opened project it's used "/UI/lastProjectDir",
but each plugin has its own setting name for last used dir.

We should standardize it:
e.g. for raster files use "/UI/lastRasterDir", for shapes use another
setting name.

I think it's most useful have a unified approch, make a standard
in this way, because if a user installs 30 plugins, it's senseless
to have 30 different settings, with 30 different path!!!

Greets!

Hi all.
The organization of the next hackfest has started already. I have a couple of
institutions that showed some interest in supporting us, giving at least a room for
the hack.
Pisa would be a good venue (you can reach it even by foot from the Pisa Airport, the
best low price airport in Central Italy).
Main issue is accommodation, which is not cheap (many tourists, lots of students).
Will let you know how things develop. Any suggestion is most welcome.
All the best.

Message-ID: <b2de29ac0911281506l780161ccsd8e0af4048bebce3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Users, Translators, Developers, Documentors and other
interested parties...

The year is drawing to a close and its been an extremely productive
one as far as QGIS goes. So what do you say we finish it with a bang
and get QGIS 1.4 out the door? At the Vienna hackfest we agreed to go
into feature freeze once Martin's new symbology and labelling goodies
made it into trunk. I would like to propose the following timings to
get 1.4 released:

29 November 2009 - Announce release checklist availablity
1 Dec 2009 - Feature Freeze Commences
14 Dec 2009 - String Freeze Commences
21 Dec 2009 - Branch for Release & Call for packaging
31 Dec 2009 - Release of QGIS 1.4 Enceladus

The checklist for the release is now online at
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_1.4

A few important things:

- I would like to make QtWebKit a build requirement. This means a
minimum Qt version of 4.4. Does anyone have any objections? Milena is
going to be helping to get the context help written for all dialogs
(Milena you still ok for this?) and I would like to use a decent CSS
and attractive looking html on the context help viewer - which is not
really possible currently with help viewer text control we have at the
moment. Any objections?

- If you are an application translator, please note that you do not
need to wait for the string freeze before starting your translation
updates. The string freeze is only there to give you a small window
before the release to finalise your translation work without worry
that one of the developers is going to change the text again.

- Symbology-ng legends do not currently work in the map composer (nor
do the new labels). Is this something that can be sorted out easily?
Do we want to delay the release shedule until it is resolved? Or
release regardless (with symbology ng and labels marked experimental)?

Regards

Will we upload only the .SVG files there ore also .PNGs? Do we agree on

Will we discuss all icons on the mailing list or should we change to the

Hi,

I'm currently trying to make a python application which use QGis API but i
am facing a problem for severals day. You see, i have installed QGis, PyQt4
and Python 2.6.

On top of my program I have :

import os
> from PyQt4        import QtCore, QtGui
> import sys
> from qgis.core    import *
> from qgis.gui     import *
>

When i try to run my script I have the following error :

 Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "C:\Users\Pierre\Desktop\Projet SIG\MontBlanc\qgismt\__main__.py",
> line 4, in <module>
>     from qgis.core    import *
> ImportError: DLL load failed: Le module sp?cifi? est introuvable.


I am running on Windows 7.

I try many things to solve this problem but I fail, I hope you will be able
to help me.

Best regards,

Pierre

As Frank W has written, it would require a RFC for GDAL and maybe some
more updates to make him happy to apply the changes. Personally quite
busy nowadays so if there won't be anyone else to make such effort, it
might take quite a while...


> Meanwhile, why not using the table manager approach in qgis?

That would be rather a big hack and I would prefer not to introduce new hacks...

Hi "Ttestt"

In the attached archive I've found a project file, sample data and
modified QgsLabel class. This is not really developer friendly format.
To make a proper patch, I would suggest you to use 'svn diff' command
to create a patch file that contains only the changes (and not the
whole files). Then create a new ticket in QGIS Trac and attach the
patch. Like that, the proposed changes will not get lost in mailing
list archive and someone will be able review the changes and possibly
apply them to the repository.

>From a very brief look I see you haven't done any changes to GUI, so
how would people enable/disable the functionality?

Please proceed with creation of a ticket in Trac. The following is an
example of a patch contributed by community and later applied to qgis
sources:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1478

Hi Alex

it looks like a bit weird mix of versions because 1.3 version from
packages tries to load PyQGIS from trunk version. Try removing all
your QGIS installation and also check whether there aren't any files
that would be left (mainly any c++ plugins or providers). And when
installing trunk version again, check the list of installed files if
it won't suggest anything.

I could add that the CODING document in the root of your source tree
describes how one should submit a patch:

2.6. Submitting Patches

In general you should read that whole document and especially the
'2.6.5. Due Diligence' section,

I look forward to seeing your patch make its way into the code base!

Regards

Tim

Are you developping a standalone app or it's a plugin. It seems that you try
to load qgis.core out of Qgis. If you wanna call core and gui in a
standalone app you must declare the path to the module throug a
sys.path.append(your_path)

Hi,

I'm trying to make a standalone app. As you said, I'm trying to load
qgis.core and qgis.gui out of Qgis.

When I try your solution, It change nothing...

I have :

In C:\qgis\python I have a folder "qgis" with : core.pyd & gui.pyd ... I
don't understand why he don't want to load the module.

Thank you for your help.

Qt 4.4 is fine as long as QGIS 1.3 stays in the Hardy repos
(QGIS/UbuntuGIS) and isn't upgraded with the other packages.

I think we might have a QGIS+GRASS msys ready on that timeline, I'll
have to see how it goes the next 2 weeks to setup a repeatable working
build/install.

Thanks,
Alex

Pierre,

Perhaps you need to be sure that the Qt DLLs can be found by Python/PyQt. Set PATH to include the location of the Qt DLLs.

As you can see, the first lines where I import Qt works well, it's the QGis
import which don't work at all :(

Sorry, but I'm working under mac os x, and the sys.path method works fine.
I've installed under Win the Osgeo version, but I cannot find the qgis.core,
only the C:/Osgeo/app/qgis/python/qgis/ folder, which contains only
qgis_core.pyd and qgis_gui.pyd.

Mmmmm! I don't understand as you can solve, but I'll try in other way!

Hi Anita,

Thank you for this e-mail. You pointed important issues.

In fact it's up to us. Tango approach is for me good example.
First discussion (mailing list, chat, whatever) - then work. Otherwise
we loose time and wishes correcting our/others work.
So we do not focus on duplicating work (many themes), but on covering
different target users of graphics (16x16px, 32x32px, svg, etc).
But to do that, we must first agree on basic metaphores. Next step can
be discussion on their details.
Good example can be discussion on OGC services
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/graphics/2009-November/000028.html
This for sure takes longer, but we do it once.
Once ... per version :)

An alternative can be collection of different themes in one place, but
in my opinion this will be impossible to manage in a while. Link to
source themes in graphics wiki is enough. Just my opinion.

> Will we upload only the .SVG files there ore also .PNGs? 

I would collect source svg and renders in different sizes. As you know
it is impossible to render from one svg icons in 16x16px and 64x64px and
not all graphic users (developers) want to play with svg. We need to
define target png sizes and name svg layers accordingly.
So if our svg layer is for 16x16 and 32x32 we call it 16-32.
This way it will be easy to use such svg later for automatic (batch?)
processing.
Question is HOW to organise folders structure and file names.
Sub-folders for every size or for example
core-name.svg
core-name_16.png
core-name_32.png...
Developers comments are welcome.

Do we agree on
> changing the color palette to Tango? 

Yes.

Is the wiki page the main reference
> for which icons exist and which are planned? 

Wiki as reference for existing icons - yes. In my understanding wiki is
good place for describing meaning and use scope of icons. And pictures
from trunk. For planned (or to change) ones better place is trac system.
I have no experience in this field, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Or is there some other

I would prefer mailing list for discussion at the moment, but if there
are arguments for wiki discussion, we can do it other way.

Hi Cedric,

Maybe you forgot to install qtWebkit? It is required by QWebView.

The newest trunk compiles fine on my machine (Ubuntu Karmic).

Using which version of Qt?  Qt >=4.4 should work.

I agree, they have a well thought out approach with documentation on how to implement it. [1]

I believe the SVN set should be a reference implementation for GIS related icons/gfx. We should focus on creating a complete set in all resolutions. If applications want to create there own theme, it is up to them.

We need to create a list of all needed icons and their metaphors, similar to the tange page [2]

The list on the wiki [3]:  is a good starting point. I suggest to start with defining a basic iconset (for instance without the advanced GIS functionality from GRASS). Discuss metaphors and once an agreement is reached put the metaphor behind the icon-name.
Finally once icons are pouring in we can show them in the same table, having columns for 16x16, 22x22, 32x32 and scalable so one can see at once if that icon is available.

Indeed.

Tango uses in its releases:
16x16/actions/address-book-new.png
22x22/actions/address-book-new.png
32x32/actions/address-book-new.png
scalable/actions/addrress-book-new.svg

In their repository they use:
16x16/actions/address-book-new.png
16x16/actions/address-book-new.xcf.bz2   <- source file, can be .svg as well

22x22/actions/address-book-new.png
22x22/actions/address-book-new.xcf.bz2

32x32/actions/address-book-new.png
32x32/actions/address-book-new.svg

scalable/actions/address-book-new.svg

They have an autogen setup which apparently renders all icons in 24x24 as well (adding a 1px border to 22x22 icons)

I believe they chose this file structure to comply with the freedesktop.org icon theme specification [4] I'm not sure how relevant this is for our purpose. It would be nice to come up with a standard file-structure so applications developers can either adept their structure to it, or write a translation script to change the structure to the one that fits their application.

As I wrote before I think having one wikipage with an overview is the way to go. We can add links to trac-issues on planned/to-be-changed icons. This way someone can claim an icon in trac and preventing double work.

I'd say we discuss here (and in chat if needed) and write down conclusions on the wiki for future reference

Hi List,

Well, I created a QgsLegendInterface with the functions
- addGroup( QString name );
- moveLayer( QgsMapLayer * layer, QString group )
- removeGroup( QString name );

There's (at least) one thing I don't like about this:
What if the user has more than one group with the same name?
All groups with the same name would be removed (removeGroup) or a
layer would be moved to the first group with the given name
(moveLayer). So the scripter / user does not have much control on the
group selection.

So if my current approach doesn't adequate, I'd prefer to create a
mini-interface for QgsLegendGroup and add it to the API, too, so the
python scripter would have a handle for the groups. (I would not know
how to name it, as a QgsLegendGroup already exists and QgsGroup would
be a bit too general, I guess. ;-))
Any objections?

I'm a little bit in a hurry, so I'm sorry it takes so long. Patch will
follow soon.

Regards
Andres

Hi Andres

what about using indices for groups? You could create a groups()
method that would return a list of groups, the groups could be
addressed by the index instead of name, so:
int addGroup( QString name ) ... returns index of newly added group
QStringList groups()
moveLayer( ... ) ... should be enough flexible to allow ordering also
within groups, moving out of groups, maybe even moving of groups?
removeGroup ( int groupIndex ) ... one thing to consider is whether
all layers within the group should be removed too or not...

I think there's also place for additional functions for querying /
setting legend items: order of layers, layer/group visibility etc. But
I'm not sure how much time would you like to invest into that :-) Just
try to design the API to be easily extensible.

One last note - we're going to enter feature freeze very soon, so if
you want the changes to appear in 1.4 release, you should be quick :-)

Martin

Hi Martin,

At the beginning I used indices (from the QTreeWidget) instead of
strings, but there was one major problem:
When the scripter adds a group and the user moved that group, it got a
new index. But the scripter had still the old (now incorrect) index. I
could not find an intuitive way to handle that up to now. (I thought
about pointers or references for the index here.)

Yes, this flexibility would be great and I thought about it, too. But
- using indices - you would have to know the index of the layer, the
group or the top element (for moving out of groups). I'll take a look
at QTreeWidget for it. It would be nice to have somthing like a
moveItem( QTreeWidgetItem * ) function, but then we would replace the
indices with QTreeWidgetItems and the scripter could do anything to
the tree.

> removeGroup ( int groupIndex ) ... one thing to consider is whether
> all layers within the group should be removed too or not...

I oriented toward legendGroupRemove() in QgsLegend, which removes the
layers, too.

I don't think the additional functionality will make it into that
release, but I'll give it a try and put as much of functionality as
possible into the patch and upload it. :-)

Hmm... on my comp it still shows the error message box "unable to open
..." and crashes with a segfault in python libs later when executing
any other python command - I guess due unexpected change of flow
because of the exception. On another computer it just aborts
immediately due the exception.

A common pattern for handling errors without exceptions is like this:

if ( ! x.open() )
{
  printf("error: %d\n", x.error();
}

instead of:

try
{
  x.open();
}
catch ( exception e )
{
  printf("error: %d\n", e.error());
}

This is how Qt does it too - check e.g. QFile docs.

Looking at the QgsProject class, the only methods that throw
exceptions are read() and write(). Both currently either return true
on success or end up throwing an exception. So we could remove the
usage of exceptions without a lot of fuss just by returning false on
error and adding a method to return error type (or error message).
This would be actually a tiny change in API semantics, but I think
it's worth it (considering that python plugins have trouble with
dealing the exceptions).

Well... I can try, it might be a good excercise - depends on how much
c++ knowledge you've acquired already :-) Anyway I think I'll might
find some time during 1.4 bugfixing period to do the changes... if
there are no objections against the proposal from other devs.

Hi Pierre.

On Windows I run a .bat file with this three lines:

*set PYTHONPATH=c:\qgis\python
set PATH=c:\qgis\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=c:\Python25;%PATH%*

After that I'm able to run PyQGIS applications. I use the QGIS standalone
installer.

Regards.

Germ?n.

Pierre,

I had trouble with my installation too with the same simptoms you talk about. My solution was quite unconventional and may be attacked  :-|   but it worked:

- Install the OSGeo4W 1.0 Kore (the Mimas unfortunately did not work for me). Until here, it will complain about the DLLs...

- Go to /OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/bin where you will find the qgis.core and qgis.gui DLLs. Copy them. Do not delete them.

- Paste the DLLs to OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/python/qgis folder... taraaaan, it should work now.

- Work from the OSGeo4W console, not from your previous python installation..

- Then you can add the PYTHONPATH, PATH and QGIS Home to your environment variables as German Carrillo said using the bat file or by hand in your Mac or Windows control panel under "system", "advanced" option... Note that if you dont add the variables, you would need to append the entire paths to your sys.path every time you open a python console..., like this:
sys.path.append("C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis")
sys.path.append("C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/python")
sys.path.append("C:/OSGeo4W/apps/qgis/python/qgis")

I agree, they have a well thought out approach with documentation on how to implement it. [1]

I believe the SVN set should be a reference implementation for GIS related icons/gfx. We should focus on creating a complete set in all resolutions. If applications want to create there own theme, it is up to them.

We need to create a list of all needed icons and their metaphors, similar to the tange page [2]

The list on the wiki [3]:  is a good starting point. I suggest to start with defining a basic iconset (for instance without the advanced GIS functionality from GRASS). Discuss metaphors and once an agreement is reached put the metaphor behind the icon-name.
Finally once icons are pouring in we can show them in the same table, having columns for 16x16, 22x22, 32x32 and scalable so one can see at once if that icon is available.

Tango uses in its releases:
16x16/actions/address-book-new.png
22x22/actions/address-book-new.png
32x32/actions/address-book-new.png
scalable/actions/addrress-book-new.svg

In their repository they use:
16x16/actions/address-book-new.png
16x16/actions/address-book-new.xcf.bz2   <- source file, can be .svg as well

22x22/actions/address-book-new.png
22x22/actions/address-book-new.xcf.bz2

32x32/actions/address-book-new.png
32x32/actions/address-book-new.svg

scalable/actions/address-book-new.svg

They have an autogen setup which apparently renders all icons in 24x24 as well (adding a 1px border to 22x22 icons)

I believe they chose this file structure to comply with the freedesktop.org icon theme specification [4] I'm not sure how relevant this is for our purpose. It would be nice to come up with a standard file-structure so applications developers can either adept their structure to it, or write a translation script to change the structure to the one that fits their application.

As I wrote before I think having one wikipage with an overview is the way to go. We can add links to trac-issues on planned/to-be-changed icons. This way someone can claim an icon in trac and preventing double work.

I'd say we discuss here (and in chat if needed) and write down conclusions on the wiki for future reference

Hi List,

Well, I created a QgsLegendInterface with the functions
- addGroup( QString name );
- moveLayer( QgsMapLayer * layer, QString group )
- removeGroup( QString name );

There's (at least) one thing I don't like about this:
What if the user has more than one group with the same name?
All groups with the same name would be removed (removeGroup) or a
layer would be moved to the first group with the given name
(moveLayer). So the scripter / user does not have much control on the
group selection.

So if my current approach doesn't adequate, I'd prefer to create a
mini-interface for QgsLegendGroup and add it to the API, too, so the
python scripter would have a handle for the groups. (I would not know
how to name it, as a QgsLegendGroup already exists and QgsGroup would
be a bit too general, I guess. ;-))
Any objections?

I'm a little bit in a hurry, so I'm sorry it takes so long. Patch will
follow soon.

Regards
Andres

Hi Andres

what about using indices for groups? You could create a groups()
method that would return a list of groups, the groups could be
addressed by the index instead of name, so:
int addGroup( QString name ) ... returns index of newly added group
QStringList groups()
moveLayer( ... ) ... should be enough flexible to allow ordering also
within groups, moving out of groups, maybe even moving of groups?
removeGroup ( int groupIndex ) ... one thing to consider is whether
all layers within the group should be removed too or not...

I think there's also place for additional functions for querying /
setting legend items: order of layers, layer/group visibility etc. But
I'm not sure how much time would you like to invest into that :-) Just
try to design the API to be easily extensible.

One last note - we're going to enter feature freeze very soon, so if
you want the changes to appear in 1.4 release, you should be quick :-)

Regards
Martin

Hmm... on my comp it still shows the error message box "unable to open
..." and crashes with a segfault in python libs later when executing
any other python command - I guess due unexpected change of flow
because of the exception. On another computer it just aborts

  x.open();
}
catch ( exception e )
{
  printf("error: %d\n", e.error());
}

This is how Qt does it too - check e.g. QFile docs.

Looking at the QgsProject class, the only methods that throw
exceptions are read() and write(). Both currently either return true
on success or end up throwing an exception. So we could remove the
usage of exceptions without a lot of fuss just by returning false on
error and adding a method to return error type (or error message).
This would be actually a tiny change in API semantics, but I think
it's worth it (considering that python plugins have trouble with
dealing the exceptions).

Well... I can try, it might be a good excercise - depends on how much
c++ knowledge you've acquired already :-) Anyway I think I'll might
find some time during 1.4 bugfixing period to do the changes... if
there are no objections against the proposal from other devs.

Hi Pierre.

On Windows I run a .bat file with this three lines:

*set PYTHONPATH=c:\qgis\python
set PATH=c:\qgis\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=c:\Python25;%PATH%*

After that I'm able to run PyQGIS applications. I use the QGIS standalone
installer.

Regards.

Germ?n.

Mmm, I forgot to say that I run the .bat file from the command line and then
I load the QGIS libraries, i.e. everything from the same *cmd*.

Can you install the last QGIS version (1.3)?

You should use OSGeo4W's python (ie. 2.5)

(ok if I post!?)

This has been nagging me since I saw the post, so I think I'll reply
here. I'm not sure why it bothers me, possibly because Arc/Info could
do this kind of thing waaay back when. I once connected a line
coverage with an Ingres database, in a dynamic relate. I can't
remember the syntax now...

 Anyway, the logical process is that of connecting a feature with a
row-set of attributes via a relate. The problem with doing something
like this in Qgis is that attributes appear in a lot of places, and
making related attributes available in those places could be a lot of
work. Labelling, symbology, selection, querying, saving and loading,
attribute data, metadata etc. Not impossible, but a big job. And some
API changes.

 I guess things would work like this. You load in a vector map layer.
Then you choose a 'relate' option for that layer (a new tab in the
layer properties dialog) and create a new relation. The relation
definition would have a name, the source map layer, the related table,
the joining mechanism (which could be a column name from the map and
one from the related table) and options for handling the join (what to
do if there's no related item). The related table could potentially be
any tabular data source (DB, file, map layer attributes).

 Let's make a concrete example. I have a UK county polygon map with
id, name, area attributes. I have a MySQL DB table of county name and
population. I have a CSV file of Europe-wide workforce numbers broken
down by age and sex together with county ids for UK counties.

 I'd create one relate called 'pop' that linked the polygon map to the
MySQL DB via the county name fields, and another called 'workforce'
that linked the polygon map to the CSV file via the county id fields.
I tell it to fail if there's counties with no matching entries in the
related tables, but luckily everything is completely matched. The
extra non-UK entries in the workforce CSV aren't an issue because my
map is only UK.

 I have a vague memory that Arc/info used % signs somewhere in
relates, so perhaps to get attribute 'foo' from relate 'bar' we could
have bar%foo in dialogs? Then a symbology drop-down would have, along
with the attributes of the UK shapefile mentioned above, also have
entries for the relates. So something like: workforce%M16-20,
workforce%M21-30 and so on. My problem with this is that % is probably
a valid character in attribute names and will break stuff. Seems like
a kludge.

 Is that the kind of thing your donor is willing to stump up for? Of
course if we all use Sqlite and PostGIS we can do all this in the DB
with VIEWS. So my real suggestion is 'Do it all in the DB with VIEWS'.

I had contemplated this a little recently along similar lines. SQLite
has a concept of IN-Memory databases. What if we created the procedure
to put joins/relates (Any sql relationship) into an in memory DB, that
way the procedure just needs to be re-run on project load. It would make
accessing the "joined" tables fast and allow querying against them.

The Arc model has some really good and some really annoying features,
particularly poor handling of many to many and the lack of a full SQL
operations as join operators.

As I commented on the ticket for table joins, I don't think this is
the way to go. There are several reasons for this:

- if the joined table is very large it wont all fit in memory and will
ultimately cause a crash or a bogged down OS
- dba's will hate us for hammering their databases with full table
queries instead of paging

I think that we should implement this using Qt's model view framework.
It provides a way to abstract data access, provides pagination, and
can be used in many contexts for 'free' e.g. list and table views.
Also if we use the built in database drivers for Qt they are easy to
hook up to a model. And we can create custom models for esoteric
datasources that are not directly supported.

Our custom model can ad hoc fetch data from the related table as each
page is requested so the need for loading heaps of stuff into memory
can be avoided.

Just my 5c

Regards

Tim

All resolutions would be? 16x16 up to 64x64?

I suggest that we do that first before starting to work on any changes to  
the current icons.

+1. We should only focus on a single theme.

I think this would be a good solution. Developers of GIS software can  
easily check out the icon sizes and file types they need.
So we'll have one SVG file per icon. How will we organize that? If I'm  
informed correctly, you're now working with only one master SVG file per  
icon size?

>> Do we agree on changing the color palette to Tango?
>>

Great! That could be step two, after agreeing on which icons we are  
planning to create and which metaphors to use.

In QGIS project we're now working with the wiki solution for our 64x64  
property dialog icons. [http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Icons_2.0]
I'm fine with trac, though I lack experience with that system.

Good. So we can now start to create our to-do list and collect ideas for  
metaphors?

Best wishes,
Anita

+1

Definitely we should slowly start filling-up content, even to test workflow.

1. Request for icon on trac
OR short mail to graphics@osgeo '[new-icon] in caption'?

2. If most agree on metaphor...
Note to wiki

Our problem is that we have already some themes and some compromise is
important.

3. Drawing SVG
->SVN
->wiki (sample renders)

We need sort of 'icon status' [1][2] on wiki.

Why this is in such order? For me it's easier to add many
short-and-easy-name subfolders with size (22x22, 16x16). Not copy
structure (like 'actions') which can change in time.
actions/16x16/address-book-new.png
actions/22x22/address-book-new.png
actions/32x32/address-book-new.png
actions/scalable/address-book-new.png

I don't want change just to make changes, but thinking...

We can start with 'manual rendering'.
There is one problem with source SVG. They can be for different target
size. How to name those files?
See metadata info [3]. We can copy those attributes.

> I believe they chose this file structure to comply with the freedesktop.org icon theme specification [4] I'm not sure how relevant this is for our purpose. It would be nice to come up with a standard file-structure so applications developers can either adept their structure to it, or write a translation script to change the structure to the one that fits their application.

We have to develop GIS-specific folders structure, but for sure this
will change (see my doubts above).

In the meantime I was looking for other sources, as Tango guidelines are
from year 2002. And I found this [4] as central design place with very
nice viewer of different themes [5].
More information concerning design with regard to icon size [6]
I will try to order it somehow on wiki.

Hi, can someone confirm the above question? 

thanks in advance

> All resolutions would be? 16x16 up to 64x64?

Depending on needs. We must just keep in mind that 64x64 icons sould be
possible to scale to 16x16. So some known problems must be avoided [1].
The question is how to name SVG file when two sources will be available.
icon-name.svg [from 16 to 32px]
icon-name.svg [48 to 64]

We have 16, 22(24), 32, 48, 64. Is this OK?
Simple solution can be source file in rendered folder. We make copies of
source file but all files are on its place.
Options:
- suffix for scalable files (but how? one size, range?)
- subfolders for scalable (nonsens)

Yes, but this is good one-person design.
I think SVG template should include action layers. This way will be easy
to render png and to coordinate work. Final SVG will contain only used
layers. Or maybe layer-visibility-off is enough? To check...from svg
auto-parsing point of view.
Do we have other re-usable graphical elements for template?

Not only you :)
As I understand. Yo need icon.
-> request for icon in trac - new ticket
-> if someone wants to draw, can become owner of the ticket
-> owner writes info to our list ... procedure ...
-> icon is ready
-> closing ticket

Or the same just with list (without trac), but then we won know what is
todo at the moment.

Yes.
to-do at trac
metaphors at list and wiki
