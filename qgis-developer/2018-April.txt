Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GDAL 2.2.4 Python 3.6.4 Install error in Mac OS X
 El Capitan (10.11.6) and QGIS3.0 : setup.py and gdal-config errors
Message-ID: <CADs9uc9Fc==S2VnNKh6QPimU82qB3k_ij92WkjEzRDQYY4JO6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi William,

I am trying python GDAL (GDAL2.2.4 and Python 3.6.4) in Mac OS X El
Capitan (10.11.6) and QGIS3.0.

sudo pip3 install gdal

I got this error:

File "/private/tmp/pip-build-e4ca_ecz/gdal/setup.py", line 138, in fetch_config
        raise gdal_config_error(e)
    __main__.gdal_config_error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'gdal-config': 'gdal-config'

I tried several suggestions in the net however, the error getting
worst that this.

Any suggestion how to fix this?

Here's the log below.


Thanks.

I'm creating a QGIS v3 compatible version of a plugin which is already
available from the official repository for QGIS v2 users. My question is,
when I submit the new version v3 compatible version of the plugin (
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/), will QGIS v2 users still be able to
download the v2-compatible version from the repository?

Yes, QGIS always gets the highest version number matching its compatibility range. 

E.g. if TomBio tools 2.8.0 are for qgisMinimumVersion=2.8, and TomBio tools 2.9.0 are 
for qgisMinimumVersion=3.0, then the latter is the newest, but is only available for 
QGISes meeting the >= 3.0 requirement. 

Btw. there is also a second reason the former is not available for QGIS 3 at all: its 
qgisMaximumVersion is by default assumed to be x.98 (where x is taken from the 
minVersion), what completely isolates the compatibility ranges.

Regards,
Borys

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3 Print Composer - Page Properties
Message-ID: <CABPxTTr4VPZnKpzu6EDU-7W0n4r8QUyvRF-hgqsTi4HPrkSWdA@mail.gmail.com>

I was just going to ask what happened to the "Page Size" properties in the
QGIS 3 print composer, but I stumbled upon it accidentally by right-mouse
clicking on the page and selecting "Page Properties." This was not easily
found. In the QGIS 2 print compose it is a part of the layout. In QGIS 3 I
just lucked out.

Could the page properties be more obvious to find? At lease add them to the
Layout or Edit menus or put them back under the layout settings.

Thanks,

Calvin

Hi Calvin,

Same happened to me, some time ago. However, this issue is not so easy 
to solve - because starting from version 3 you can mix different page 
sizes in the same layout. In QGIS 2 all pages had to be of the same size.

If you have a good solution or proposal how to solve this UI wise, 
please let us know.

Greetings,

Andreas

The reason for this change is that your can now have different settings for
each page.

The page size is not a property of the layout anymore but it's a property
of the page.

But I agree that the page properties might be better exposed.

I suggest to provide the same interface as version 2 calling this "default
page size" and explaining that every page could get a different size,
right-clicking on the page. Most users make one-page maps and they would
never need this otherwise vital feature.

Hi All,


16 days waiting for a review of my Remove Empty Layers plugin...

I think it's fair to say that something in the Plugin approval process is
not working properly.

I believe the main (volunteer!!!!) plugin maintainer, Paolo, is on
holiday at the moment.

I'm sure we don't begrudge him a well-deserved break!

None of this is in stable API, so can change between QGIS versions
(including within minor versions/patch releases).

Stable API for processing is:
- the classes within the core library (unless they are explicitly
marked as non-stable, e.g.  the modeler related classes)
- the base GUI "WidgetWrapper" class (NOT any of its subclasses)
- some methods from the processing namespace:
    - processing.algorithmHelp()
    - processing.run()
    - processing.runAndLoadResults()
    - processing.createAlgorithmDialog()
    - processing.execAlgorithmDialog()

So, in short, unfortunately this approach is always going to be
fragile. Better wrap it in a big try block! ;)

I gather you're trying to force the "help" panel to resize when the
dialog is opened. Is there a particular reason why you need to do
this?

And it's a great work he does!

I've seen other plugin approvals recently, so i guess the whole process
doesn't stop if a person is on holiday.

Also, a core developer suggested Paolo to grant me approval permissions,
with no success.

But, of course, I can wait, just wanted to make this case public.

Heh... it's open source work -- nobody ever really FULLY tunes-out

I've thought long on this. I'm reasonably convinced it's a short-term
issue as people adjust there 2.x workflows to 3.0.

There's two approaches I can see working to mitigate it:

1. Add a "pages panel", which allows you to pick from existing pages
(e.g. via a drop-down combo box) and then set the properties for that
page. It could also have the actions for adding new pages and deleting
existing pages there too.

and/or

2. Add a "new layout wizard", which shows when you create a new print
layout. This would prompt users to set the page size before the layout
is actually created. It could potentially replace the existing layout
manager approach to creating layouts from a template, e.g. by showing
a nice list of available templates via thumbnail graphics.

Unfortunately both approaches aren't trivial, and would require some
hours to implement.

Hi Nyall, 

I also think that the current situation where the page properties are
only exposed on right-click is not so ideal. From your two options you
list I would prefer option 1 with the separate "pages" panel. I don't
think that wizards are so effective - definitely not for experienced
users. I also don't like it when extra windows pop up. It would be nice
to get rid of the "layout manager" for the long term. Opening separate
windows is often confusing for people - these windows often hide below
other windows and sometimes they block QGIS while that other dialog
window is waiting for user interaction - not so ideal. 

Can you estimate how much work option 1 (pages panel) would be? Could
this be included in an upcoming crowd funding campaign with print
composer improvements? 

Thanks for your reply, 

Andreas

Hi

Good analysis and sorry for my slow response.

The widgets are not directly tied to PG. They will work as long as the
providers support QVariant::List or QVariant::Map datatypes.

The spatialite provider supports QVariant::List, encoded as JSON:

I've only recently looked at layouts, so apologies if this is not helpful.
How about, in the right-hand tab of the right-hand menu (is it called
Items?), there is a permanent item, perhaps in italics, called Page, and at
the top of that panel, some indication of which page is currently selected?
You could then change which page is selected by clicking any item on it.

This would then mean that the second tab could be used for page properties
as it is for item properties.

Disregard this error.

The processing plugin loads now properly.

I think downloaded and installed the wrong version (32bit / 10.6) of
the python3.6.x. instead of 64bit / 10.9). It seems that python 3.6.5
is properly installed now.

This would be the way I prefer, or include that same "widgetery" in the
layout properties. The "current" page could update based on the portion of
layout that is visible, as already happens for the grids panel.

I love the idea of having a list of available templates with some
thumbnails. But it won't fix the issue of not being trivial to see a pages
properties once te layout is created.

Sorry, I asked Admire from Kartoza to help me in this period, he might have overlooked this one.
Done now.

Well, you shouldn't be installing GDAL-python from pip if you're using my GDAL framework and QGIS3.  My GDAL framework has the python module linked into the python site-packages.

But, I can see a problem that I should fix - pip doesn't see my gdal-python, so other modules that need GDAL will want to install GDAL from pip (this may be why you were doing this).  I ran into this with the proj module, so I created a wheel for that so pip sees it.  I need to do the same for GDAL, and Shapely (GEOS).

Hi Matteo,

I'm finally trying to use custom widgets from QT Creator instead of using
promoted widgets.
I'm facing the same issue with the generated path. It's not using
"qgis.gui" so it's failing during the import in QGIS.

Did you fix this issue?
I can manually fix these imports, but I'm asking if there is a fix for
that. Thanks

Thank you Nyall, I understand.
The reason I needed to resize the window was to better fit some image
content in my HTML help.

Taking the opportunity, I'm a C++ and Python developer and I would love to
contribute on the project. Is there any need for help in the Processing
Framework (since I'm already a bit familiar with it) or in others areas? I
would probably need some guidance at first but I've been using QGIS and
developing plugins for some time now, so I guess it wouldn't be too big a
learning curve.

My thinking here is whether this needs to be supported officially -
e.g. by making the panel wider by default. Alternatively we could add
a method to QgsProcessingAlgorithmDialogBase to handle resizing of
this panel.

Heck yes! There's a TON of work which processing would greatly benefit
from. Here's a very short brain-dump of potential high-value projects:

- if you're a user of any of the 3rd party providers (GDAL, GRASS,
SAGA), these need a lot of love. There's lots of open tickets against
them, some of which would be quick fixes for someone more familiar
with the underlying provider library. Similarly if you're on Win or
OSX there's quite a few open tickets against these providers (most
testing is done on Linux)

- if you're a model user, a nice project would be improving the inputs
panel in the modeler dialog. It's been discussed (somewhere, can't
find it now) that this panel should be reworked to be a list of inputs
used within the model, with + / - buttons to add a new input and
remove a selected input. And then we could add up/down buttons to
allow inputs to be reordered for models, since they are currently just
shown in a semi-random order and there's no way for users to
reorganize them logically. All the API stuff should be in place for
this, it's just Python GUI work that's needed.

- another high value task is porting the QGIS algorithms from Python
to c++ (for speed and stability). At the same time we do this we
upgrade each algorithm to support "data defined" parameter values
(e.g. buffer width based on expressions!). The goal here is to move
all the QGIS algorithms across to c++, EXCEPT those which have
dependencies on Python libraries.

- there's rough notes on
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/wiki/Processing-Algorithm-Bugs-and-Enhancements
concerning improvements we can make to existing algorithms which would
be fantastic to see explored

- Or, the funnest processing job, adding more algorithms! There's a
rough wish-list at
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/wiki/Algorithm-hit-list , some of
which are just a matter of exposing existing QgsGeometry methods as
processing algorithms (e.g. exposing QgsGeometry::transform(
QTransform .... ) as an algorithm to allow rotate/shear/scale
transforms), and some of which require adding wrappers to GEOS
functions to QgsGeometry (GEOSMinimumWidth_r,
GEOSMinimumClearanceLine_r, GEOSNode_r, GEOSSharedPaths_r) and then
exposing as processing algorithms. Others need javascript->c++ ports
of functionality from turf/mapbox js libraries, if that kind of thing
interests you.

I'm happy to mentor. Just let me know.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Alternative layer drawing order not honoured in
	QGIS 3
Message-ID: <a750bfbf87d75222291e94135a387fb9@carto.net>

Hi, 

I know that probably not many people use the feature of the "alternative
drawing order" in QGIS - it is kind of a hidden - not so well-known
feature. Normally, QGIS is using the layer rendering order defined in
the "Layers" panel. But one can deliberately reorganize the layer
rendering order in the separate "Layer Order" panel. This is necessary
for more complex cartographic output (e.g. cadastral maps). 

I noticed that an existing 2.18 qgs project opened in 3.0 does two bad
things: 

1. the checkbox "Control rendering order" in the "Layer Order" panel is
set to "off" in QGIS 3, whereas it was on in 2.18 

2. the ordering in the Layer Order panel is completeley mixed up (not as
it was in 2.18). 

I think that this a very important issue to fix for any serious
cartographic output involving many layers. 

My questions: 

1. Can others confirm that issue, that the layer drawing order is messed
up when opening 2.18 files that had alternative layer orders defined? 

2. Who has time and expertise in this code area to fix this issue? 

I can provide a Postgis-Dump and a sample project that demonstrates this

Hi Etienne,

qgis_customwidgets.py is responsible of replacing the cpp header by
qgis.gui.
It should be located in /pythonX/dist-packages/PyQt5/uic/widget-plugins/

To work, this file needs bbe able to import qgis.gui. If it fails, there
will be no replacement.

Can you check if this file is present and if you can import qgis.gui?

Cheers,
Denis

Hi,

I can see that QGIS3 has now become the default package in most packaged
distributions (e.g.: Windows, Linux, OSx).

Does it absolutely require Qt5/PyQt5 and Python3 as dependencies?

                     Thanks in advance for your reply,

                                     Cheers,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] clicking crs in statusbar opens wrong tab
Message-ID: <275c06af-d0ab-d792-a198-f61594cb78eb@duif.net>

Hi Devs,


Minor issue, but I think/hope an easy fix.
And a question...

Clicking on the 'crs' in the right bottom of the statusbar used to bring
up the crs dialog tab in the Project properties dialog.
At this moment it opens the dialog, but it opens on the Metadata tab.

Let me know if you prefer an issue for this.

Question (slightly related): Can I have a handle to the Options DIALOG ?
I want to create a little dialog to configure a QLocator. It is opened
when you click the 'Configure' button in the Options dialog/Locator tab.

At this moment if I give the dialog the main window as parent, my dialog
is in between the Options and Mainwindow dialogs.
If I give it NO parent, it is hidden behind the MainWindow.
IF it would be possible to have a handle to the Options Dialog (via
iface or so), I could give that as Parent to my dialog.

Pointers/help appreciated.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Mmm, not sure if I misunderstand your question...
But yes, QGIS moved from Qt4/Py2 to Qt5/Py3, so yes QGIS is fully
dependable on those underlying libs?
Or do I miss your point?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsLocator & common python libs
Message-ID: <6158eb6c-c6c5-f617-b508-dd1bbeb65699@duif.net>

Devs & Python devs,

I've written one plugin, which when installed adds 3 QLocator filters to
your little search-bar in the lower left corner of QGIS3:
- a Nominatim geocoder/filter
- a Google geocoder/filter
- a PDOK (dutch) geocoder/filter

The use of these geocoders/locators in QGIS is REALLY usefull, just
search for 'eiffel', and google will let you zoom to the eiffeltower
(even being written in dutch, french or german....)

The nominatim geocoder is also great, and the dutch geocoder can fly
over NL with just a zip+housenumber.

Code is here:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgislocator
Plugin zip to install is here:
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgislocator/raw/master/qgislocator_0.1.1.zip

Now my main point: I discussed this with Nyall, if we should create a
mega-locator-plugin or keep the locator filter/plugins small.
Adding a geocoder to the current form is easy: just reimplement a filter
(see locatorfilters) for your national geocoder service, and you are done.

The advantage of having ONE mega-plugin:
- it is easy to have some 'basefilter' in which to have some common coce
- having one plugin, forces devs to use QgsNetworkRequest (here via
Alessandro's QgsNetworkAccessManager. So no more use of httplib2,
Requests etc which fail on proxied environments if not fully implemented).

BUT, it is probably better if we split up all the possible
locatorfilters (not everybody on the world is interested in dutch
addresses :-) ...

So my main point:
- how to give everybody the possibilty to implement a locator class, BUT
also share a common base class or use the same QgsNetworkAccessManager
moduel?

Some options:
- we create a separate repo for 'common' python classes, and via git
submodules everybody pulls in it's own copy of those classes
- we create a common-qgis-python module which would ship with QGIS (with
filterbaseclass, QgsNetworkAccessManager, and other ideas from the
Boundless commons lib).

Let me know any opinions/ideas.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

PS, wannatry? Download
https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/qgislocator/raw/master/qgislocator_0.1.1.zip
and use Install from ZIP in the plugin manager. Use '2022zj' to search
PDOK, or 'eiffel' to search Google. Note that you may need a google key
to use their geocoder.

Hi

Thats really cool Richard. What about tweaking the plugin builder plugin to provide a new template for a locator plugin. That way the locator basic framework could be provided but we could keep the plugins discrete?

common-qgis-python like that we created in Boundless when we where there
[1] had this intention:
1) create a set of common snippets
2) centralize maintenance
3) avoid re implement common problems (rised during dev for that specific
company)

the main problems I see are:
1) I would feel confortable if repo [1] would be out of control of a
private company.

My option would be:
1) move to QGIS repo
2) manage any new snippet or module using an Enhancement Proposal (QEP)

Not clear to me the advantages of using a separate repo added via submodule.

To be honest, it seems like I'm the only one with this issue. I guess as
long as the workaround does the job, I wouldn't bother with it.

As for the issues/projects that you mentioned, what seemed like something I
could tackle is the missing algorithms from PostGIS, since I've got more
experience with it. Also, it really does sound like a lot of fun to
implement!

I'm happy to mentor. Just let me know.


Thank you Nyall, that would be really cool!
Could you give me some pointers as to how should I go about the PostGIS
algs? Like what classes should be extended, what methods should be
implemented or anything else I should pay attention to?

Hi Andreas,

I can confirm your issue. If I change the rendering order in a 2.18 qgs project and open it in 3.0, the checkbox "Control rendering order" is set to “off” and the ordering is “reset” to the rendering order in the “layers” panel.

Regards
Burghardt

Betreff: [QGIS-Developer] Alternative layer drawing order not honoured in QGIS 3


Hi,

I know that probably not many people use the feature of the "alternative drawing order" in QGIS - it is kind of a hidden - not so well-known feature. Normally, QGIS is using the layer rendering order defined in the "Layers" panel. But one can deliberately reorganize the layer rendering order in the separate "Layer Order" panel. This is necessary for more complex cartographic output (e.g. cadastral maps).

I noticed that an existing 2.18 qgs project opened in 3.0 does two bad things:

1. the checkbox "Control rendering order" in the "Layer Order" panel is set to "off" in QGIS 3, whereas it was on in 2.18

2. the ordering in the Layer Order panel is completeley mixed up (not as it was in 2.18).

I think that this a very important issue to fix for any serious cartographic output involving many layers.

My questions:

1. Can others confirm that issue, that the layer drawing order is messed up when opening 2.18 files that had alternative layer orders defined?

2. Who has time and expertise in this code area to fix this issue?

I can provide a Postgis-Dump and a sample project that demonstrates this issue.

See also the screenshot at https://issues.qgis.org/attachments/download/12554/layer_rendering_order_garbled.png showing the issue - on the left is QGIS 2.18 on the right there is QGIS 3.

Issue report at https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18620

Thanks for your replies,
Andreas

I'd say it absolutely requires Qt5 and you can build it without Python support. But if you 
need Python, Py3 and PyQt5 are the only compatible.

A new built-in module, like qgis.commons or, say, qgis.elements (just a dummy name) 
sounds the best for me.

no I did not fix it. I think that all the issue is because I'm compiling
qgis without installing it on the system (so no make install).

But that's only my idea ;)

My concern with the second approach is (and always has been) that
these common modules effectively become part of the stable API. We'd
need to carefully decide on things like:

- how are releases of the module handled? Is it bound to QGIS
releases, or on its own release schedule?
- Would the module be versioned (i.e. if it's not tied into QGIS
releases and packaged accordingly, will the code need to work with any
QGIS version from 3.0 up?)

We'd also need to very carefully vet all contributions to this module,
to ensure that they aren't reproducing functionality which is already
present in the core/gui modules. A lot of the code in common python
modules I've seen is just re-implementations of widgets and classes
which are already present in the master codebase, and which should
always be used instead. If Python syntactical sugar is desired for
these existing c++ classes then I'd much prefer to see it implemented
in the core QGIS module, such as is done here:

- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/__init__.py#L192
- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsreadwritecontext.h#L84
(Via https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/__init__.py#L216
and
- https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/core/qgsproject.h#L1316
(via https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/core/__init__.py#L240)

This is a nice approach to adding standard Python coding patterns into
the QGIS API, with the benefit that it's already tied into the QGIS
releases, packaged accordingly, and are all unit tested on Travis.
Maybe the same approach should be taken for adding the network access
manager.

Just my 2c!

Yep, can't wait to give this a spin :)

Sure. Just wrap it in a try block so it won't have the possibility of
breaking in future and you'll be right.

I'd start with an easy one - implementing a geometry "scale"
algorithm, since this doesn't require adding anything new to the
QgsGeometry class.

What you'd be doing here is utilising the "QgsGeometry::transform(
QTransform transform,.... )" method. You'd build a scaling transform
using QTransform::fromScale and then pass that to the QgsGeometry
method, so that every coordinate in the geometry is scaled by the
scaling transform.

Use the QgsTranslateAlgorithm class as a starting point to base your
new algorithm off. Most of this will then break down to renaming
offset parameters and variables to scale, and then using
QgsGeometry::transform in the processFeature method instead of
QgsGeometry::translate. There's some code there which won't be
required anymore - specifically the logic about adding z/m values to
geometries if they don't already exist (since z/m would only be scaled
if they already exist). So the whole outputWkbType method can be
dropped too, as the algorithm won't be changing the WKB type in any
way.

After you've made the new class you need to make sure it's registered
to the QgsNativeAlgorithms provider, see
QgsNativeAlgorithms::loadAlgorithms().

That should be all that's required to get the algorithm implemented,
then it's just a matter of adding unit tests (can discuss this in a
PR).

This would be a good project to get your head around the basics of
implementing c++ algorithms in QGIS without any complicating details.

Good luck!
Nyall

Hi devs,

just noticed that Python-based GDAL utilities (e.g. gdal_merge.py) are
not available in the weekly standalone installer by default. Is this
intentional or just missed dependency to the gdal-python package?

I strongly agree with Nyall analysis about versioning. We had similar
problems in Boundless when adding new features to already available
modules... there weren't a simple way to load a specific module version,
especially when these different version are available in different python
plugins all listed in the pythonpath.
The simples solution was to version the module from qgiscommon to
qgisocmmon2 and rebuild all in-house plugin at averey update tof
qgisocmmons. Something impossibile with third party plugin, in Boundless
case we had control on deployment and packaging of the product, something
radically different for the standard QGIS.
So I would link the package version to QGIS version avoiding a different
relase math and versioning.

I also agree to avoid ti add snippets that can be solved usign core API.
Btw, for the case of NetworkAccessManager it was introduced to allow
upgrade comnon plugins using QgsNetowkrAccessManager or requests to use the
integrated auth system, something hard to describe into a docstring... btw
I documented it in the PyQGIS coockbook in the auth system paragraphs.

cheers

Hi,
just a quick followup about qgd file. Paul just merged that PR
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6717 and qgd are now only created when
needed.
Thanks Andreas for raising the issue !

Yes, we are talking about my own plugins, but I mean "transfer" plugin from
my account to another - in other word change plugin ownership. Is it
possible?

Please try what I wrote below. As said, I think you can do this yourself.

If not, sent me (as I have admin rights there):
- your login
- the plugin name(s)
- the login of the new maintainer

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Status of the QGIS homebrew tap?
Message-ID: <7C33BADA-05F6-47CB-991A-EEDBBA8012AE@sdfe.dk>

All,

What is the status of the QGIS homebrew tap [0]? The last commit seems to be back in November.
I guess whoever was in charge of this has lost interest? Or it has been discontinued for reasons
not obvious to me. Several pull requests has been submitted over the last few months so it would
seem that there at least is a market for this. I could certainly use a simple(r) way of building QGIS
on OS X using Homebrew. I am not super familiar with the inner workings of either QGIS or
Homebrew but if there is a need for a new maintainer of the QGIS tap I would like to volunteer to
at least bring it up to speed again and curate contributions from the community.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Do we have a User-Agent string for QGIS
Message-ID: <8450c973-4425-fcbc-c186-fab06a9093e2@duif.net>

Hi,

Being busy with a Nominatim Locator Filter plugin, which retrieves
geocoder results from the Nominatim service, I read [0] in the Usage
Policy that the project asks to provide a proper User-Agent in the
headers. Same

My question here:
- do we already have a 'QGIS-Desktop' User-Agent string?
I read that the tile services (we use the xyz tiles), also ask that [1],
so we probably (should) have?

You can put a lot of info in it [2], but I could just add a plugin
string like: "QGIS-Nominatim-Locator-Plugin".

OR would it be better to do it project wide: like there would be a
'iface.getUserAgentString()'
which could create much more interesting User-Agent like:
"QGIS/3.1 (x86_64 GNU/Linux, nl, Qt 5.9.2, GDAL 2.2.4)"
Or so...

Mmm, now thinking about it, it is probably better if I just use my own
User-Agent for a plugin, then when the plugin 'misbehaves', it is not
the QGIS-project that is blamed for it?

Or is is better to have one 'face' to the rest of the world.

Anybody?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

Yes, we use an User Agent for XYZ requests. The string is exposed in the
settings (Settings → Options → Network). Users can change it. The
default User Agent is "Mozilla/5.0".

Even if the user changes the UserAgent in settings, the string "
QGIS/version" is always added to the User Agent defined. So, the User
Agent is in fact "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/3.x". See
src/core/qgsnetworkaccessmanager.cpp

  QString userAgent = s.value( QStringLiteral(
"/qgis/networkAndProxy/userAgent" ), "Mozilla/5.0" ).toString();
  if ( !userAgent.isEmpty() )
    userAgent += ' ';
  userAgent += QStringLiteral( "QGIS/%1" ).arg( Qgis::QGIS_VERSION );
  pReq->setRawHeader( "User-Agent", userAgent.toUtf8() );

That is what we have: an User Agent as "Mozilla/5.0 QGIS/3.x".

I think plugins should use the same approach. If some plugin
'misbehaves', we just need to fix it.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

I've seen quite a lot WMS proxies blocking requests containing
"QGIS" and "GDAL" in user-agent. I like the way it's hardcoded
in QGIS. When a service provider doesn't allow loading his content
into QGIS, the user should accept this and don't easily override
this :)

Just for the notes: actually, there are also blacklists for ArcGIS
clients. It's an easy way to protect web-viewer only WMS from
being loaded or grabbed from a desktop GIS or CLI.

Best regards,
Tobias

Also fulcrum - for some unknown reason they block direct geojson
access to datasets unless you spoof a standard browser user agent.

(If anyone reading is a paying Fulcrum customer, please hassle them
about this. It's a silly restriction which really negatively impacts
on their otherwise great offering. )

Hi Kristian,

Larry, who was actively maintaining the repo, wrote recently saying he will
be slowly catching up.
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2018-March/052772.html

OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac is also in a bad state but there's some small
activity recently.

To me, we should turn qgis/homebrew-qgisdev down and bring this into osgeo
as QGIS 3 is release now.

Your help would definitely be appreciated if you can bring the formula in
there!

Cheers,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Improving the automatic issue report creation in
	doc repo
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrt-+vt44hYDCktyiDdsKnXC4TF11tPfZJ=jcAKCbg74g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

When a [Feature] or a [needs-docs] commit/PR is merged in QGIS repo, it
generates an issue report in QGIS-Documentation repo. This automatic
process which saves times for every body has some issues (actually, could
need some improvements) I'd like to raise here:

1/ Sometimes (to avoid writing "too often"), the description of the created
issue report is "Unfortunately this naughty coder did not write a
description... :-(" Funny but other than the commit title (which can help),
you need most of the times to track the original PR and read pull request
description/discussion to figure out what it's really about. And most of
the times the main information is in the PR first message.
So, feature request: could the PR first message be added to the issue
report (with its screenshots, screencasts...)? I think this will reduce the
endless back and forths for those willing to tackle the documentation
issues. And meanwhile, if the tagged commit message in QGIS repo could be
more than a title, it'll also be very helpful. Thanks!

2/ creation of duplicate reports: afaics, this occurs when the pull request
title contains the tag and in its commits, there's only one that has the
same tags; we get an issue report for the commit and another one for the PR
(eg. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6627/commits generates
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2458 and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/2457).
If there are more than one [feature]/[needs-docs] tagged commit in the PR,
we only get a report by tagged commit and that's nice... but i did not
investigate a lot in this area.

I'd say that the first one is the most annoying. Identify  and clean
duplicate reports is rather easy and can be done manually (unless there's
an easy automatic way to avoid them).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error during compilation
Message-ID: <96bf7e25-46ce-b00c-e884-822ed2c11c86@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm failing to compile QGIS starting from the merge of the PR [FEATURE]
Projects in PostgreSQL. Long error trace here [0]

Are there any special requirements starting from this commit, like Qt
>=5.5.1 or something else?

Thanks to all the suggestions and hints

Cheers

Matteo

Message-ID: <CA+qEb=0T+uZn+GPHZEJEQq-3MKGgBAQNaBmRd=J+Btwb_XWe-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm developing a plugin under QGIS 2 environment in which I use global
variables. I'd like to know if it's allowed to pass a JSON string into a
global variable?

My globals were fine until (I guess) I started to pass in jsons and now I
face an issue I described here: https://gis.stackexchange.com/
questions/277623/global-variables-in-qgis-mixed-on-some-computers -
basically the assignment of values to variables is sometimes wrong, some
even stay empty sometimes and it feels to be totally random.

If anyone knows if jsons could introduce any error in globals, I would be
grateful and it would narrow down my search. I don't know how are they
parsed, so maybe OS regional settings (commas and colons thing) also come
into play? Regards QGIS 2.18 and it's subversions (5, 9, 13, 18 etc.).

Best regards

*Adam Borczyk*

Possibly - the guts of this are buried deep within the Qt library, but
I'd be surprised to find if it's not correctly escaping the strings.
I'd suggest manually escaping/unescaping them and see if that helps.

You'll probably need to remove any existing variable settings keys to
test properly.

Subject: How to Prevent GeoPackage file from updating modified date when
viewed in a Qgis project when it is not being edited

 

I would really like to use and promote GeoPackage as the go to data format
in my organization but I am having the following problem that I haven't been
able to solve.

 

When ever someone opens a Q template project that has a layer with a
GeoPackage data source, the GeoPackage file (not its contents) will be
altered and it will show that it has been updated in the Windows file
manager. I have been told that this happens because the write ahead logging
has been triggered (creation of *.wal and *.shm) files by simply viewing the
contents of the GeoPackage in QGIS and/or in Intramaps Roam (works on top of
QGIS for tablets). 

 

This is problematic because most users in our organization will then look at
the windows modified date time stamp and conclude that the file's contents
have been modified. Additionally, all of the GIS layers are stored in
Dropbox and subsequently Dropbox concludes that the file has been modified
and it re-uploads a new copy of the GeoPackage. When it is a large
GeoPackage > 1 GB in size this is quite problematic and causes a cascade of
uploads and downloads.

 

Over the last few months I have tried to suppress this modification for the
large GeoPackages in our system in the following ways: (1) make the layer
read only in the QGIS project (no effect); (2) make the Dropbox folder read
only for all users except the Dropbox administrator (this is effective for
the large base layers); (3) change the properties of the file in windows to
read only (effective for the Dropbox administrator); and (4) add a user
variable to the windows system environment variables: OGR_SQLITE_JOURNAL =
DELETE (effective for QGIS but not for Intramaps Roam)

 

Combining 2, 3, and 4 allows me to use GeoPackage for layers I can ensure
are placed in the read-only Dropbox folders.

 

It is likely that my organization will never need the simultaneous editing
of datasets that is facilitated by Write-Ahead Logging, but I would really
like to be able to replace shapefiles and File geodatabases with GeoPackages
in all of our projects going forward.

 

Therefore, is there a simpler way to suppress the write ahead logging
behaviour that causes the files to believe they have been updated for all
GeoPackages created in QGIS or used in a QGIS project? 

 

If there is currently no way to do this, how do others adjust their
workflows so that they know when the contents of a GeoPackage have really
been modified versus just viewed by other users?

 

Rob

Hi all,

Please see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/120
for a new QEP regarding handling of optional parameter groups for
processing algorithms, designed to fix shortcomings in the GRASS
provider (and extend the possibilities for all algorithms).

If accepted, the changes will be backported to 3.0 to allow fixes to
GRASS algorithms in the 3.0 release.

Message-ID: <CA+0Y7vLADHp_fggiTvmPZMfo_Ba0Pzasx2-+ywDsxQsGZcJ2=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am maintaining a c++ Radio Planning Plugin for QGis, QRap (www.QRap.org.za
).

I am trying to compile in Ubuntu 18.04, using QGis  2.18 (the libqgis-dev
version is 1:2.18.18+28bionic. The compiler I am using is GNU 7.3. The
error messages are below.

I had the same problem under Ubuntu 16.04 using Qgis 2.14 and c++ 5.

The last version I could complie successfully was QGIS 2.8.

Can somebody please help.

Kind Regards
Magdaleen Ballot

Hi guys,

sorry sorry to bother the list you again with this, but I'm stack and
maybe someone has a quick solution.

I have a really fresh installation of debian unstable, so all the Qt
dependencies should be satisfied for the 3D.

However, if I enable the WITH3D flag in ccmake I'm not able to configure
it even if I have all the libqt5 installed (also libqt53dextras).

If someone has a solution or some suggestions for this it would be
really great


Thanks to all

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] About merging a commit to fix the bug #18132 in
	QGIS 2.18
Message-ID: <1523362889862-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear developers,
about two months ago I reported a longstanding bug in QGIS 2.18
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18132) about a wrong dpi resolution in
images exported from composer.

Two weeks later I sent a pull request
(https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6524) with a little commit that would fix
the bug, and about a month ago Nyall Dawson (thanks you!) slightly revised
and tweaked the commit (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6620).

Since then, the pull request was not yet merged.

I don't know well the procedures, so I'd like to know if there is anything I
have to do to get the pull request merged in time for the next 2.18 point
release.

Thank you in advance.

Andrea Giudiceandrea

Builds fine on debian unstable with 2.18.18 for me:

apt-get install libfann-dev libpoco-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev libeigen3-dev
svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/qrap/code/ qrap

Hi Matteo

do you have qt3d5-dev package installed? That's the package containing
#include files and those extra .cmake files...

Cheers

Hi Andrea,

I'm sorry for the delay, looks like there is at least one failing test:
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/354180088#L1367

this must be fixed before anybody could possibly merge.

If the failure is a false negative, you should just create a new reference
image for the the test (and possibly a mask image).

Unfortunately this is not trivial if you've not done it before, and
requires some time even if you've done it before.

See:
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/unittesting.html#comparing-images-for-rendering-tests

See also:
https://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testDetails.php?test=68355414&build=312657
(look at the very end of the page)

Hope this helps.

Hi Denis,

I don’t think my knowledge on the various QGIS dependencies is good enough for me to do that just yet.
My main intention was to get the ball rolling on this again and if that required someone to step up and
take a lead I’d be willing to do that. Now that I understand the situation a little better I think the main
focus for now should be to bring the osgeo4mac tap back into working order.  I am happy to help as
much as I can in that regard.

When that is in order it will make sense to start work on a new QGIS3 formula. Preferably also in the
osgeo4mac tap. I guess the qgis-dev tap is less important now that qgis3 has been released. It should
still serve as a good starting point for a osgeo4mac/qgis3 formula though.

Hi Kristian,

Just to know (privately ;) ), do you have any intention to provide a qgis3 formula?

Cheers,
Denis

OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac is also in a bad state but there's some small activity recently.

To me, we should turn qgis/homebrew-qgisdev down and bring this into osgeo as QGIS 3 is release now.

Your help would definitely be appreciated if you can bring the formula in there!

All,

What is the status of the QGIS homebrew tap [0]? The last commit seems to be back in November.
I guess whoever was in charge of this has lost interest? Or it has been discontinued for reasons
not obvious to me. Several pull requests has been submitted over the last few months so it would
seem that there at least is a market for this. I could certainly use a simple(r) way of building QGIS
on OS X using Homebrew. I am not super familiar with the inner workings of either QGIS or
Homebrew but if there is a need for a new maintainer of the QGIS tap I would like to volunteer to
at least bring it up to speed again and curate contributions from the community.

Hi Kristian,

Thanks for your reply.
Totally agree on these points, that's what I'm trying to do, but it's so
much time consuming!
Thanks again for your input.

Yeah, there’s a lot to do. I think a good place to start is to weed out old PR’s and issues that are no longer relevant. It is easier to start from a (somewhat) clean slate! I can go through the issue tracker and ping you on those that can be closed. Or I can do it myself if I can get the proper privileges.

Hmm that's strange - it seems like there is something wrong with your
installation - the mentioned file
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/Qt3DExtras should be installed from
that package - but it seems it does not exist on your system. Could
you verify that the file does not exist and try to reinstall the
qt3d5-dev package?

Cheers

Hi Martin,

yeah that's exactly what I thought because the file is there:

matteo at debian:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu$ ls | grep -i libQt53DEx
libQt53DExtras.prl
libQt53DExtras.so
libQt53DExtras.so.5
libQt53DExtras.so.5.10
libQt53DExtras.so.5.10.1


together with all the other libQt ones.. I tried also to reinstall both
qt3d5-dev and libqt3DExtras but nothing changed.

BTW: I noticed that when removing qt3d5-dev all the libqt53D where not
mandatory uninstalled.

Thanks Martin!

Umm... you are looking into "lib" directory, not "include" directory.

/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/Qt3DExtras

Does that file exist? Is the file readable? (nothing funky with file
permissions)

Also, make sure to re-run cmake from a clean build directory...

I was just replying that I looked into the wrong folder.. in fact in
"include" Qt3DExtras is not there..

matteo at debian:~$ ls /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/

absolutely no idea why.

As I said the re-installation did not changed anything. Should I
manually copy some files into "include"?

Thanks again for the support

Perhaps there were removed in the new qt3d-opensource-src 
(5.10.1+dfsg-3), note the ongoing transition:

No, you should not modify package paths.

The Qt3DExtras includes are no longer included in qt3d5-dev, confirmed 
with:

  apt-file show qt3d5-dev | grep Qt3DExtras

many thanks for the answer. So no chance to have a clean build with
Qt3DExtras until the bug is fixed right? Or did I misunderstand something?

Thanks again

You'll have to build QGIS without Qt3DExtras, yes

Filing a bugreport against src:qt3d-opensource-src asking about to
missing Qt3DExtras headers is a good idea. It may be a bug that those
files are no longer included in the package, the package changelog nor
the upstream changes mention removing Qt3DExtras.

Forget about reporting a bug, the Qt3DExtras headers were removed on
purpose:

Unfortunately yes, since QGIS 3.0.x requires Qt53DExtras. Perhaps it can
be made optional or worked around in another way.

That's quite disappointing. Removing it from packages after shipping
several versions with it is a good recipe for breaking applications.

I wasn't aware of the fact that the Qt 3D Extras library was
considered unstable. For QGIS 3.0 it is a bit late to do something,
but for QGIS 3.2 we could copy files we use from Qt 3D Extras to QGIS
and keep them until there is a Qt release with stable Qt 3D Extras
release.

Cheers
Martin

this sounds like a reasonable solution. Would it be a big amount of work
to do?

Dear QGIS Community

We recently held our 2018 QGIS Annual General Meeting. The minutes of this meeting are available [1] for all to view. 

As I have previously announced, I have decided  to step down as chair of the PSC this year, so this email is my last official act as QGIS Chair. Thank you all for the kind words and deeds of support you gave me during my time as project chair. I would like to welcome our new QGIS Board Chair: Paolo Cavallini, and our new QGIS Board Vice-Chair and QGIS PSC Member, Marco Bernasocchi. In case you are not familiar with Paolo and Marco, you can find short introductions to them below. I am pleased also to say that the project governance is in good hands with Richard Duivenvoorde, Jürgen Fischer, Andreas Neumann and Anita Graser kindly making themselves available to serve on the PSC for another two years. It is also great to know that our project founder, Gary Sherman, continues to serve on the PSC as honorary PSC member. Gary set the standard for our great project culture and it is great to have his continued presence. QGIS has been growing from strength to strength, backed by a really amazing community of kind and collaborative users, developers, contributors and funders. I am looking forward to seeing how it continues to grow and flourish and I am excited and confident it will do so with Paolo acting as the project chair and representative. Rock on QGIS!

—————————

Paolo Cavallini: 

I got involved in QGIS long ago, first as an user, then more and more deeply in various activities, initiating and supporting various plugins and core functions (e.g. GDAL Tools, DB Manager), opening and managing bugs, taking care of GRASS modules, handling the trademark registration, etc . I acted as Finance and Marketing Advisor for several years. Currently I manage the plugin approval process.

Motivation: It's such a pleasure building up, in a truly cooperative and democratic way, together with truly intelligent people, a tool that enables people to freely do their job or pursue their interests, that I cannot resist helping as much as I can.

Marco Bernasocchi (http://berna.io @mbernasocchi)

I am an open source advocate, consultant, teacher and developer. My background is in geography with a specialization in geographic information science. I live in Switzerland in a small Romansh speaking mountain village where I love scrambling around the mountains to enjoy the feeling of freedom it gives me. I’m a very communicative person, I fluently speak Italian, German, French English and Spanish and love travelling.

I work as director of OPENGIS.ch which I founded in 2011. Since 2015 I share the company ownership with Matthias Kuhn. At OPENGIS.ch LLC we (4 superstar devs and myself) develop, train and consult our client on any aspect related to QGIS.

My first QGIS (to be correct for that time QuantumGIS) ever was “Simon (0.6)” during my BSc when the University of Zurich was teaching us propriertary products and I started looking around for Open Source alternatives. In 2008, when starting my MSc, I made the definitive switch to ubuntu and I started working more and more with QGIS Metis (0.11) and ended developing some plugins and part of Globe as my Masters thesis. Since three years the University of Zurich invites me to hold two seminars on Entrepreneurship and Open Source. In November 2011 I attended my first Hackfest in Zürich where I started porting all QGIS dependencies and developing QGIS for Android under a Google Summer of Code. A couple of years and a lot of work later QField was born. Since then I’ve always tried to attend at least to one Hackfest per year to be able to feel first hand the strong bonds within our very welcoming community.

In 2013 i was lucky enough to have a release named after a suggestion I saved you all from having QGIS 2.0 - Hönggerberg and giving you instead QGIS 2.0 - Dufour

Beside my long story with QGIS as user and passionate advocate I have a long story as QGIS service provider where we are fully committed to its stability, feature richness and sustainable development. Furthermore, as WorldBank consultant I am lucky enough to be sent now and then to spread the QGIS goodness in less fortunate countries.

Motivation:

One of my main motivation to be part of the PSC is to help QGIS keep this incredible growth rate by being even more attractive to new community members, sponsors and large/corporate users. To achieve this, key is maintaining the right balance between sustainable processes (that guarantee the great quality QGIS has been known for) and an interesting and motivating grassroot project where community members can bloom and enjoy contributing in their most creative ways.

Message-ID: <8884382D-56CF-40B8-BD8B-972647AABC43@kartoza.com>

Dear QGIS Community

Once a year we hold a combined QGIS Developer Meeting and User Conference. This year we are holding it in collaboration with FOSS4G2018 in Tanzania! It’s so exciting to be holding our first such meeting on the African continent and we hope you will all join us there. If you haven’t already booked the dates in your diary, here are the key dates:

The Developer Meeting will take place at  SUZA [1] (the State University of Zanzibar) before the main FOSS4G2018 conference:

	• arrive Wednesday 22. August
	• depart Sunday 26. August 2018

The User Conference component of the meeting will be co-located as a track within the main FOSS4G2018 user conference[2] to be held in Dar es Salaam:

	• arrive Monday 27 August
	• depart Sunday 31 August 2018

Note that there are additional code sprints for other OSGEO projects after the FOSS4G2018 main conference (1-2 September), but the QGIS developer meeting is before the main conference.

If you plan to attend the QGIS User Conference track at FOSS4G2018 you need to register for the FOSS4G2018 conference and also organise your accommodation in Dar Es Salaam for the period of the FOSS4G event. The registration form is here[2]. Book now while early bird rates are still available!

To register for the QGIS Developer Meeting, simply add your name to the table in the wiki page here [4].

For more details about the Developer Meeting, please see the wiki page [5].

Hi everyone

Here is a new proposal to add support for OpenCL to processing core algs
(and possibly other parts of the core in the future):

yes yes please! Continuing going back and forth to find the description
of the new feature is not a lot of work, but still annoying. I don't
know how much effort would it take to enhance this procedure. . at Richard?

I think this is more related more to the single developer isn't it? I
mean by opening a PR with [Feature] in the title that contains single
commits with other [Feature] string in the title.. I don't know if this
could be achieved easily by web hooks

Thanks for raising this

Cheers

Matteo

Good evening Jurgen,

Thank you very much for your effort. I manually applied the changes in the
patch. I also changed the FindQGIS.cmake to this one:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/cmake/FindQGIS.cmake
and even replaced content of qgsapplication.h with
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-2_18/src/core/qgsapplication.h

I still get the same error.

But indeed as the compiler says, in none of the functions below does the
parameter have a type. They seem to member variables .... or am I ignorant
on a C++  shorthand:
    static QObject* ABISYM( mFileOpenEventReceiver );

    static QStringList ABISYM( mFileOpenEventList );

    static QString ABISYM( mUIThemeName );

    static QString ABISYM( mPrefixPath );

    static QString ABISYM( mPluginPath );

    static QString ABISYM( mPkgDataPath );

    static QString ABISYM( mLibraryPath );
    static QString ABISYM( mLibexecPath );
    static QString ABISYM( mThemeName );
    static QStringList ABISYM( mDefaultSvgPaths );
    static QMap<QString, QString> ABISYM( mSystemEnvVars );

    static QString ABISYM( mConfigPath );
???

Any further help or education will be much appreciated.

Kind Regards
Magdaleen Ballot

Dear Alessandro,
thanks for the tips.

The strange thing is that my original pull request (#6524) passed all the
tests so it would have been possible to merge it, but it was later closed by
Nyall Dawson that slightly modified my commit and submitted a new pull
request (#6620) that doesn't pass the tests.

Do you think it would be appropriate to submit again the original pull
request in order to circumvent this "impasse"?

Best regards.

Thanks for the response. First I tried to 'reset' the variables, but
without purging QGIS configs (~/.config/QGIS folder). Since there is no
'delete global variable' method in QGIS 2 API I just set all of the
variables I use to an empty string at the beginning of my code. This seems
to work for now (at least on OS that it hadn't before), but if it turns out
it's not the case, my next try will be string escaping.
Best regards

No: I think that what you need to do is to check the failure (which appears
to be a minor difference of 1 pixel in the size of the generate image) and
replace the reference image in order to make the test pass.

Anyone without the GRASS library path in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or ld.so.conf should
be able to confirm (see debian/qgis.sh.in) ;)

Uh, yes confirmed :-)

Without:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/grass74/lib/:<yourinstall>

You will not even SEE the grass plugin in the plugin list.

WITH the right path in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH you will see it (with me
here in sid is is: /usr/lib/grass74/lib/ )

Hi guys,

thanks!

I have a script that exports the LD_LIBRARY_PATH but I just have a fresh
installation of debian sid and the path was pointing to
/usr/lib/grass72/lib/ instead of /usr/lib/grass74/lib/

Thanks again and sorry for the noise

Hi all,

it seems impossible to delete files (shapefiles in this specific case)
if these are loaded in QGIS even if the project with this files is closed.

The only way is to restart windows.

Are there any other more friendly methods?

Thanks to all

Hi Matteo,
can you check what file system type is used in you case. Is that a network
shared file system, what type (Samba, NFS, etc...)

Cheers

Ah, thanks Denis! Really nice the Python docs, and I had troubles
finding the QgisInterface too :-)

Is it an idea to just point to it (in a small paragraph pointing to the
other docs and python cookbook on the frontpage:
http://python.qgis.org/master/

I think we/I should do some redirection too, like
- python.qgis.org -> https://python.qgis.org/master/ (now empty)
- api.qgis.org/python -> python.qgis.org
- api.qgis.org -> https://qgis.org/api/
Something else?

About gui/other/QgisInterface.html I was searching in the 'treeview' on
the left op the page, but could not find it there...
Because all 'headings' are with a capital: New, Options, Paint and then
'other' is on the bottom :-)

Thanks for all this work!

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Thanks Denis. Very clear python docs!
Just out of curiosity, I read somewhere why QgisInterface has 'Qgis' prefix
and all other classes have 'Qgs' but I totally forget the reason.... There
was something about Gary Sherman....
Could you help me?

Which version? There was a bug in 3.0.0 (fixed in 3.0.1, by
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/dff31a4a19 ) which meant the ogr
provider held a reference to a layer for 60 seconds after it was
removed from a project.

Sorry - this is totally my fault. My revised PR caused rendering test
fails on Travis and honestly, I'm finding the 2.18 code so
painful/stressful to work with now that I just couldn't get up the
motivation to fix these tests in my volunteer time. I've re-opened the
original PR and closed the revised version, and if Travis is ok
(fingers crossed) I'll merge it.

Can I gently bump this request? Is there anything which I can do to
make this happen?

I think we need to put this conversation at least in the devs list, not
everybody is in this community list, so we probably end up talking to
ourselves (which may still happen, since Docs aren't sexy).

I don't think we will be able to do the documentation only with volunteers.
We will need to professionalize it. We need to pay people to write
documentation, and even to review it.

Unfortunately, even having money to spend, it seems difficult to get people
that are free to do it...

It's very frustrating to write lots of documentation, and then get stuck by
the lack of reviews. I know Harrissou is in that position. I would suggest
that, if after a period of time, the PR has no reviews at all, its owner is
free to merge it. I know it's not ideal but is better than having outdated
documentation while someones updates are in standby forever.

BTW, it's on my TODO list to update the documentation video, focusing on
the github approach. ut I don't know when I will have time for that.

Best regards,

Alexandre Neto

I'm still committed to contribute to documentation,
as already said in the past weeks (before Funchal) I just struggled
mightily to finish some previous commitment nevertheless my
contributions should start to appear really soon.

Small changes could be merged quicker.

I am currently reviewing some PR. Hope it helps to go further :)

Message-ID: <4b33fbd4-918e-bdc4-fc22-c85656d7c178@opengis.ch>

Hi all I'd like to share a new tool we created to help plugin developers
porting their plugins to QGIS3.

we called it (with a lot of fantasy) qgis2to3 and you can install it with

pip install qgis2to3

the package includes two commands:
- qgis2to3 (a copy of the files found in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/scripts to allow for quick
downloading and simple installation)

- qgis2apifinder (a tool based on qgis.org/api/api_break.html that helps
you find usages of the QGIS API version 2 and gives hint on how to adapt
the code for API version 3)

Documentation and source code are at https://github.com/opengisch/qgis2to3
a blog post with more suggestions on how to port can be found here:
http://www.opengis.ch/2018/04/13/porting-qgis-plugins-to-api-v3-strategy-and-tools/


Have a good weekend porting your plugins ;)
cheers
Marco

thanks for this, really useful! One side note (maybe it depends on my
local machine): I had to install it with sudo privileges, else the tool
was not found on the system.

Thanks again for this!

Thanks Marco. Could you please add the instruction to the guide:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3
It might also be useful to do a mass mailing to all plugin devs.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS3: no referrer on HTTP(S)-requests
Message-ID: <5068dad891d68081392cf0edcb8d79b5.squirrel@webmail.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi there,

after having problems with loading XYZ tiles from OSM (many timeouts),
I've read that IPs without referrer get blocked faster and longer than
IPs with referrer due to OSM's tile policy.

QGIS isn't sending out a referrer at all. So for users with a fixed
IP (like a corporate network), will get blocked way faster and longer.
On the other hand, community's opinion about this is that affected
corporations should get a paid or own tile server to not slow down
the existing ones.

I've checked the requests of QGIS and there's no referrer in header.
Would it be possible to add an option to set an referrer in general?
Not to override OSM's limits, but to give the user more control if
the target service needs a referrer. libcurl and GDAL support this
of course.

Right now, the only way is to setup a local proxy and add an referrer.
But when accessing an HTTPS service, that is not what you want at all ;)

Best regards,
Tobias

Some days ago I asked a question about the 'User-Agent'-header in
(OSM)-requests [1], with a link to the 'Tile Usage Policy page [2],
which states:
"If known, a valid HTTP Referer."

In our case, I'm wondering what the referrer should be...

And are people in a corporate network not always sending the proxy as
referrer? Or their actual domain?

Mmm, see [3]: you have to add a 'referer' header (no type) :-)

Funny stuff those standards

Regards,

Richard

According to OSM's munin, they're blocking IPs without a referrer
more often:

Argh, I remember your post now :)

I know maaany corporations using IP masquerading (Universities also
do here). But I've never seen them adding anything to the referrer.

	Relation Widgets crowdfunding
Message-ID: <CAB28Asgr_9XSmzCz-wCULoPzbF6eNW=JTHbo5o-JfSi5i4jSRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

North Road are proud to launch our latest QGIS crowd-funding campaign:
Drill-down (cascading) forms! This campaign covers extending the
functionality present in QGIS “Value Relation Widgets”, allowing the
implementation of complex, dynamic filters within QGIS attribute
forms. The functionality can be used to implement “drill-down” forms
within QGIS, where the values available in one field depend on the
values of other fields.

Full details are available at the campaign page:
https://north-road.com/drill-down-cascading-forms/

We need your help to make this feature a reality! We need backers, but
just as importantly, we need people to spread the word about this
campaign so that all interested users and organisations hear about it.
Here are some ideas:

- spread the campaign page via your social media accounts: Twitter,
Linked in, etc
- forward a link to the campaign to any relevant professional networks
you're part of
- publicise the campaign via your local QGIS user group
- have a chat to your manager... if this feature will make your work
easier, and you've saved money by implementing QGIS within your
organisation, consider contributing and let us make your job easier!

Stay tuned for more updates and posts exploring this feature as the
campaign progresses...

Nyall

Hi Nyall, 

Interesting campaign and definitely some needed feature that will help
further improve forms in QGIS. 

However, I wonder why you chose the "value relation widget" and not the
"relation reference widget". Both widget types have a larger overlap in
functionality and I did hope that we could get rid of one of the two
widgets in the future. Because from a user perspective it is confusing
that different widget types exist that do similar things. 

I had the impression that the team around Denis/Matthias is pushing the
"relation reference widget" and had the plan to implement in the
relation reference widget everything the "value relation widget" does. 

Matthias - please correct me if I am wrong. 

Nyall/Matthias/Denis: What are your thoughts on the redundant
functionality in both widgets? Could we merge the two into one widget? 

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi,

Yes indeed, there is a large overlap between the two and it would be
nice to unite them in the future.

Most of the recent work has gone into the relation reference widget, but
unfortunately there are still some things that will need to be
implemented on the relation reference widget before the value relation
widget can be declared obsolete (and I did not yet make a comprehensive
list).

Nyall, what would be required to bring this functionality also (or only)
into the relation reference widget? I guess the work that has gone into
the preparation for this crowdfunding will make it a lot easier also to
implement this in the relation reference widget?

Best regards

Matthias

jHi all,

to go in the same direction as Andreas, my opinion is that the three
relational widgets (value relation, relation reference, and 0-n/n-m one)
need some love and I was about to start redacting a global QEP for that.

There are a lot of features missing and glitches we would like to adress,
and drill down between fields is one of them.

Merging and coordinating efforts would be great!

I'm off the office right nown, but here are the requirements I had,
according to our experience at building business applications with QGIS:


# widgets naming

A common issue is that the names are not very self explaining on what use
case they adress.
In training sessions, I use this simplification :

 - value relation widget are best used to affect value list (also named
sometimes domains) codes when displaying other values like clear or short
names
 - reference relation is the "Foreign key" chooser between real features
(some are choosable on a map, others not)
 - the relation widget is the opposite of the reference relation widget,
displaying the "n" part in 1-n relations

# common features needed for all widgets

 We need the same options in both value relation and relation reference
widgets.

- chained / unchained filters with consolidated tests (we have a lot of
regressions in ther behavior)

- a common "search tool" to find features to relate when it's not possible
to click on it, and when the list is long.
- A KNN search filter for spatial objects would be a massive win there to
efficiently limit the list. Alternatively filtering in extent, and by any
configurable expression would be nice

We prob

# Value relation specific issues

- This tool substitutes codes by value almost everywhere in QGIS. We
however miss the ability to display that value in some parts of the UI,
like layer symbology or identify result dialog. That is a real trick for
users and being able to display both real and translated values would solve
that

# relation reference speficic issue

- This tool load a sub form when not in " readonly" mode. This is quite
expensive and if we merge both widgets, we should pay attention to be as
lite as possible.

# Performance issues

We found in 2.18.15 that there were hard coded thresholds changing how
relation reference widget was requestion sub features when entering in edit
mode. This led to a sudden massive freeze when having more than 100 000
potential related features. SQL request suddenly fetched data by blocks of
2000 from 1 per 1 fetches using classical selects.
When raised the threshold and switched sub form preloading to readonly.
Matthias improved a lot of things recently, IIRC like multi threaded loading

Globally, this raise the issue that current situation might not scale up
for big databases and we need to put that requirement in the scope.



So, maybe this work could be helped by grant applications and customer
direct funding. Anyway, we need to coordinate there.

My two cents,



Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Error with GRASS in Processing
Message-ID: <498aabf3-d906-58c2-83dc-f476be50a86e@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

testing GRASS within Processing I noticed a small bug in all the
algorithms where you can add a map point coordinates with a click on the
map, like r.viewshed, r.drain

If the users choose to click on the map to fill the box with the
coordinates of the point, the box is filled with both coordinates AND
the additional EPSG information, like:

348403.62350233766,4903994.026987238 [EPSG:32632]

and this makes GRASS unhappy.

Should I fill a ticket?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi,

I'll try to address all concerns in a single mail (what a challenge!)

First I would like to say that everybody has access to a different set of
"average/typical users" and I cannot claim any statistical relevance to the
group of users I've been in touch with.

But the user's feedback that I've got so far is that the Value-Relation
widget (V-RW) is easier to use and to understand: its scope it's limited to
how data are entered and viewed and does not depend on a
model-project-level constraint (the Relation-Reference R-RW does).

Those (statistically insignificant) users were quite emotional and ready to
fight to keep V-RW live and healthy :)

Code-wise I totally agree that the two widgets could share more logic and
options, but given the intricacies of the attr-table and widgets-forms
logic this is not trivial at all, and it's not in scope with this QEP 116
enhancement.

Coming to the new functionalities introduced by QEP 116, the way they will
be implemented will make them easily reusable in the context of the R-RW:

- form scope context with geometry and attributes
- form scope available in both the form and the attribute table

Of course existing bugs and glitches in the V-RW workflow will be fixed on
the way when they not imply rewriting the whole QGIS core ;)


What could be considered here, is to add a second goal to the campaign for
making the new features available to the R-RW too, what do you think?

But even without this additional goal, I still think that this QEP (which
is not a complete refactoring of the whole form/attr-table *-R widgets) is
a step forward and in the direction of a future better integration of the
existing *-R-widgets.


That's why I'm joining Nyall's call to contribute and make this a reality.


Also note that some of Règis requirements, like a geographical dynamic
filter will be possible with an expression like:

... AND contains(buffer( $current_form_geometry, 10), $geometry)

note that this expression is the one used to filter the values in the
related layer, and it will have access to the geometry of the feature
currently being edited/added in the form (or table row) as well as to the
form (row) values, so:

- $current_form_geometry = the geometry of the feature currently being
edited in the form
- $geometry = the geometry of the related layer that is being filtered to
get the list of values for the combo/search/etc...

Also note that the V-RW is already used in the identify results panel (and
form of course).


Cheers

May they be statistically significant or not, the opinion counts and is
important to be considered. I assume, the main requirement here is an
easy setup (i.e. directly in the widget, no roundtrip via project
properties). As long as this is not implemented, the value relation
widget will stay alive.

Let's focus on what other requirements are potential show-stoppers and
then decide if it's worth moving on.

And that's what I really like about it!

... and even better with the R-R widget where it will be possible to
dynamically adjust the range from the form (thinking of advanced search
functionality in a popup or so), its new infrastructure allows for some
very cool additions which I hope to be able to implement soon ;)

Please keep up the good work and let us know what's required to bring
this to relation reference too!

Hi Matteo,

of course you should (for this case as for any other regression/bug as this)
this is not right, and if fact it wasn't ever the case (to have also
the CRS info when using the pick coordinate tool).

thanks!

It may not be right for the GRASS provider (it isn't - this is a bug),
but for other providers it is, as this allows you to take advantage of
Processing 3.0's new transparent reprojection.

E.g.:

- canvas in 3857
- layers in 4326
- run the shortest path point-to-point alg, and pick a start/end
coordinate off the map. These will be in 3857 (respecting the canvas
crs), but when the alg runs it will reproject it to the required crs
(4326) without hassling the user and making them hate QGIS :)

definitely yes. I'm loving this new CRS handling by Processing

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] issues with 1:n relations
Message-ID: <CACfnYnSde6zFYSWJt2Cb_H5qsxPmWkWrNVdRhmtueSVT8N+w-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have recently had to test some scenario with 1:n relations in QGIS and I
have found a few issues and would like to know if someone has them in its
pipeline/todo list, eventually to share the effort for the fixes.

Anyway I'm also interested on your feedback on the matter.

1) 1:n relations in QGIS3. They seems unusable at the moment. When opening
a parent layer feature form, the area/space where the child records should
show does not show/cannot be expanded.


2) 1:n relations in QGIS 2.18.

I have tried a scenario (that to me seems not unusual at all) where both
the parent and the child are layers/tables with a geometry.

The case where the child has its own geometries does not seems well
implemented (if implemented at all) in the context of the relation feature
form and this causes the following:

a) from within the parent feature form, if I edit the child and try add a
new record there is no tool to allow also add/digitize the proper geometry.
The user can still enter only the attributes and when saving I have seen
two things happen *) In a test project using GPKGs this led effectively to
a record orphaned of its geometry *) In a test project using PostGIS layers
the edits are *silently* discarded, no warning, no error, not even in QGIS
logs.

b) from within the parent feature form, when toggling editing for the
child, this is effectively put it in edit state also in the layers panel.
So a user can "move away" the parent feature form (that it is on first
plane) and use the standard editing tools to add a geometry to the child
layer. When finished the attributes form pop-up and can be used to fill the
data, with the important issue/limitation that the "referencing field" is
*not* automatically filled as it is done when working within the relation
form. Once saved the new record will also show in the relation form. This
seems a partial workaround because as said the referencing field is not
automatically filled.

Am I missing something?

thanks in advance for your feedback.

cheers

Interesting, I cannot reproduce this here on Linux nor did I hear of
this from our clients using Windows.

>From what I can remember, yes, there is still an issue here that the
geometry cannot be digitized right at this time. As a workaround one can
go to the attribute table and select this feature and use the add part
tool. In some project we implemented a python based feature action that
implements this use case. (Hint hint, if there's a customer request for
this, I'll be happy to estimate the required amount of work ;) ).

Are you referring to the case here, when the parent is added (and not
edited)
for this case you preferably
 * enable transaction mode
 * server side evaluation of default values (so the id of the parent is
known already at form time before the parent is committed to the layer)
 * deferred foreign key constraints (so the database only checks if the
foreign key points to a valid parent at transaction commit time)

I hope this helps at least a bit

Hi Giovanni,

Not sure what you exactly did, I wasn't even aware of QGIS being able 
doing any 1:n relations.

But a few months ago I had to do a more complex 1:n relation, including 
adding some fields. I solved it by using a virtual layer. The 
description is here:

http://www.qgis.nl/2018/02/16/english-diagrams-for-features/?lang=en

Maybe it could help you. Or maybe you know an easier way for doing this? 
Btw, I would normally do this using PostGIS but this was a question from 
a customer.

Ciao,
Raymond

right, I forgot about that. But then why not having the coordinates
show in one field, and the value of the crs in a separate one?

You need to be using autogenerated forms (not drag and drop). Report is here:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17525

I've confirmed it personally - Windows & Linux.

I can't confirm this - for me it works fine with r.drain and the param
values including the CRS.

Can you post more steps to reproduce? The processing log would help.

I agree that the point parameter widget isn't ideal. I'd love to see a
PR improving this!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] issues in QGIS Server 2,18
Message-ID: <2BC2DE23-CF90-47B4-AE33-6137D9E5793F@yahoo.it>

Hi

In addition to the problem described in GetPrint I have a problem related to the legend in QGIS 2.18.
If the "Show Feature Count" function is enabled my QGIS Server crashes and part of the qgs file is also compromised. The legend is no longer displayed. Even if disabled "Show Feature Count" the qgs file is damaged. I've seen that this code in the qgs file crashes it:
      <customproperties>
        <property key="showFeatureCount" value="0"/>
      </customproperties>
This is also the case in GetPrint with dynamic texts in the legend (object counting). I have to remove all references in the qgs file but not always enough to avoid the crash. Sometimes I have to recreate the file from the beginning without this option and without the same option in the print.
QGIS server is installed on an OS Desktop (Mac OS X). X11 is not enabled and therefore I cannot use the fake-server.
The other options in QGIS Server work well.
All this in version 2.14 did not happen.

Thanks

cheers

Thanks Nyall, now I see it also.

Actually vice versa:
it works with drag and drop (the projectgenerator which I've mainly been
testing creates those) and fails with autogenerate.

it seems the error is only Windows related, on Linux (both 3.0 and
master work fine, in Win both 3.0 and master fail).

The main error in the log is (I think) this:

ERROR: Sorry <[EPSG:3003]> is not a valid option

I will update the ticket with a complete log

Thanks!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Raster calculator in Processing model
Message-ID: <9d02dde2-315f-bcc8-0514-ed3be32df9ef@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm facing some trouble with the raster calculator (native) in
processing models.

In my model I have a DTM in input, I'm calculating the slope of it and
then I want to use the calculator to extract only the slopes > 15.

The resulting layer is empty and filled only with -3.40282e+38 values.

Same operation outside the modeler works nice.

Could someone confirm this?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi all,

sorry for bombing the mailing list, but I've some time to test Processing.

It seems that some (many?) GRASS algorithms are not correctly working.
What I discover is that whenever a numerical column is needed the
algorithm fails (v.surf.idw, v.to.rast).

I tested with different datasets and different column typee (integer,
real..) but the error is always similar, a small extract of the log:

v.external complete. Link to vector map <vector_5ad734cddf0ce4> created.

WARNING: Missing key column name

ERROR: Column <LABEL_ANG> not found

ERROR: Raster map <output0a1efa7bd4864096917ddaf7bb885b79> not found

ERROR: Raster map or group <output0a1efa7bd4864096917ddaf7bb885b79> not

anybody else has faced this problems?

Thanks and sorry again for bombing

would you agree if I change slightly the phrase "The + button will add
a new feature to the airport layer. And it will assign the new airport
to the current region by default."?

because as this functionality is implemented now, using a child layer
with geometries, this effectively means creating a new record in the
table without a geometry (which I guess in not what users expect, as
also I feel is not very well supported in QGIS).

cheers!

Everybody is warmly invited to rephrase any part he feels does not
accurately describe the application behavior. This is more than welcome.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue with global variables don't get assigned
Message-ID: <CA+qEb=0jidtPk+kOiR9dT6O5NRMtDF99STGwYviq8xq=9drC2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I recently sent an e-mail here about JSON string variables messing up my
globals in QGIS 2.18. Today I experienced another bug (?) - very simple
global variable just does not get loaded. The code is:

    # Inside SocketIO worker class:

    def get_srid(self):
        # socket request to the server, returning EPSG code as integer
        self.emit('srid', {}, lambda data: self.assign_srid(data))

    def assign_srid(self, data):
        QgsExpressionContextUtils.setGlobalVariable('srid', str(data))
        QgsMessageLog.logMessage('Assigned SRID: %d' % data , 'myPlugin')

The result of calling get_srid() is correct "Assigned SRID: 4326" in Log
Messages Panel, but in Properties the variable "SRID" is still empty.
Sometimes it works though, after some random number of tries. It also
worked after I purged ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf file, but it'll possibly
happen again.

Is there anything I have to take special care of?


Best regards

I discovered, that my old Config file was ~ 10MB of size. Each time I was
assigning globals, they were appended into the file with their values,
instead of being replaced. Is it correct behaviour?

As Alessandro was telling:

I want do a proposal to make QgsNetworkAccessManager a little more
user/python friendly, so (plugin) dev's don't have to rely no external

I hope there is somebody willing to take this up, as I probably will not
be able to handle this..

Message-ID: <8acf663d-2fd4-ebab-80c8-b3c217cd9bb8@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

maybe a really small issue. But it seems to me that there are quite
fewer layer legend customization available in QGIS 3 than QGIS 2.

In QGIS2 in "Settings - Options - Canvas and Legend" there are some
useful customization (bold names, capitalize...) that seems disappeared
in QGIS 3.

Using the Advanced option one can still use them. Have been some reasons
to remove this options?

Thanks for any feedback

Matteo

Hi matteo,

Use the force Luke, use the force. (force = search bar in the option dialog)

Those settings have moved to the advanced settings. Search for example,
"legend" and you will find most of it.

Hi Alexandre,

thanks for the (force) hint ;)

weird is that even with the search bar, if I type legend only the
Advanced settings are showed (in Linux even if not the old boxes) but in
Windows none of the bold legend settings are shown

so it seems that Luke force only works on Linux

Cheers

Matteo

	installed from repositories
Message-ID: <CACfnYnTymhwRE95hc4wZiLhRyGs-Z7EsJEFXcaoGJSrSaZzCRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm quite familiar with the installation (on both Linux and Windows)
and use of QGIS Server 2.* and in the past days I started to have a
look also to version 3.

I was able to test on Windows, but I'm struggling on Linux (Ubuntu
16.04) after having installed it from the QGIS repos.

A request like
http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?MAP=/path/to/project.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

always return "Service unknown or unsupported".

>From the CLI

"QUERY_STRING="SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&MAP=/path/to/project.qgs"
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi

it seems to return the capabilities but ends always with

<ServiceException code="Service configuration error">Service unknown
or unsupported</ServiceException>

In logs I can see messages like

"Service WMS is not registered"


Downgrading to 2.18 and making the same requests works as expected.


Anyone has an hint for me?

thanks in advance

Hi,

Try to activate log at info level. When the server start, you should have the following lines:

Checking /usr/lib/qgis/server for native services modules"
"Loading native module /usr/lib/qgis/server/libdummy.so"
Adding service SampleService 1.0
"Loading native module /usr/lib/qgis/server/libwcs.so"
Adding service WCS 1.0.0
"Loading native module /usr/lib/qgis/server/libwfs.so"
Adding service WFS 1.1.0
"Loading native module /usr/lib/qgis/server/libwms.so"
Adding service WMS 1.3.0
Initializing server modules from  "/usr/lib/qgis/server"

(note, for me worked by installing master, not setting the environment

thanks again

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Working with irregular magnetometry data points -
 converting them to an image
Message-ID: <CABPxTTp2WE-usk7oXeZkZA01bnJT8cS75z-rrtJqgQAZ-TGOOA@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know how many of you have worked with archaeological magnetormetry
data, but I have been asked to help with magnetometry data of the ancient
Mound Builders in North America. I am looking for some suggestion on how to
best turn the irregular magnetic data points into an image.

I see an Interpolation plugin that perhaps is the solution, but I also see
that it is not part of QGIS 3. Is this because it has not been ported yet,
or is not going to be porter, or is there a better solution?

I don't know if any of the Lidar tools would work for this or not. LASTools
is a commercial product and the locked version only works with small data
sets and adds noise unless you purchase a license. At least that is how it
was the last time I used it.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Hi,

today we had some issues with plugins.qgis.org

we're still busy with that...

but we will probably move to a new dedicated server for it, depending on
the status/issues that come up later

at this moment you cannot login in plugins.qgis.org because ldap
authenication is not working yet (the new server needs to be whitelisted
by SAC).

thanks for you patience :-)

Message-ID: <680e1873-42a2-62e1-1165-cc760c1b7e15@duif.net>

Hi,

We run several docker containers on qgis2:
- building of websites
- building of documentation
- plugins Django app
- demo.qgis.org

Those all run in Debian containers...

BUT there are a lot of other images flying around there, from earlier
experiments or ....:
- centos
- like 5 versions of ubuntu
- phusion ?
- <none. / unnamed ones

The plan is to clean up a little in those.
So can everybody who has an image of value there raise a hand?
Else I'll purge all images not needed (size ranging from 0.5 to 10 Gb),
to regain some diskspace/inodes.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

This option was dropped. The rationale was that we cannot have options
for every user interface setting like this or the interface becomes
just a daunting mess! Either bold names is good, and they should be
used in all installs, or they aren't needed.

>, capitalize...)

This is a bit controversial - during 3.0 development the setting was
made default for a while, and the option dropped. But there was
push-back after this and the on-by-default change was reverted, and
the setting was moved to the advanced settings page only.

A related nuisance from an (older) user I got a question from:

- in QGIS3 invisible layers are grayed out in the LayersPanel, but so
much that they become unreadable to him...

I agree that you cannot make EVERY option settable, but... maybe we can
come up with another visible cue that layers are hidden?

OR is there an advanced setting to move it back to black?

Regards,

Richard

I perfectly understand the need to avoid every user case options..

still wondering if this options can be added only in the advanced
settings dialog (so there it should not result in a messed up UI). But
as said, I don't know if this can bring to coding issues.

Thanks for the clarification!

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geometry generator in point cluster renderer uses
 project CRS, not layer CRS (?)
Message-ID: <1524306295174-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I've been having real difficulty with geometry generators in point clusters,
when the layer CRS differs from the project CRS. Michel helped investigate,
and raised a ticket:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18773

I'm not very confident in my projection knowledge, so I'd be grateful if
someone could take a look, and either agree that there is some kind of bug,
or dismiss it as expected behaviour (ideally with some kind of explanation).

Thanks

Tom

Hi there,

sorry for pushing this bug here, but it's really destroying data:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18601

As a work-around, I'm loading CSV files to GeoJSON, GPKG or XLSX
through ogr2ogr first to load them in QGIS. But I'm missing a GUI :)

Bet regards,

Hi all - 

QGIS 3 is pretty magical* but I miss the R provider! We have a bunch of R scripts for our flightplanning and mapmaking wildlife work that were super handy and will be sorely missed.

I don’t have the Python skills to port the 2.18 plugin to 3.0 (yet!) but would be interested in (a) trying to get some crowdfunding going and (b) helping to coordinate an effort to get the R provider going again. 

… that is, IF there is enough interest! Please respond here or ping me privately and we’ll see how much of a community we have.

Cheers -

Hi all,
my perception is that, although niche, thi is however largely used. The
problem is that it is difficult to reach these users, so a crowdfunding
widely annouced through blogs and social media could be a good way to go.
I suspect these users will quitely keep on using 2.18, which IMHO is
suboptimal.
Thanks Howard for raising this issue.
All the best.

Hi all,

I can see that there still are some undocumented features ;( but would like
to know if there are news/plan on the changelog release?
I find it less user friendly to show (untranslated) github links to people
(that's what comes in mind to me first!) when they ask about new features
(not yet documented in the User manual).

If nothing is planned for upcoming days, Richard, could you update
Transifex with website and 2.18 docs, please? I feel there are a lot of
missing texts (eg French are 100% for QGIS Website in Transifex but online
pages are full of english parts). Thanks!

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using memory layer in Processing with SAGA and
	GRASS
Message-ID: <b5e1494f-7313-67ca-74bd-659158aecfca@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

sorry if I missed something on this topic, but it seems that it is not
possible using memory layer when running algorithms from the console.

A simple example should explain everything:

# QGIS
parameters = {
    'INPUT' : 'big',
    'OVERLAY': 'small',
    'OUTPUT':'memory:'
}

result = processing.run("qgis:difference", parameters)
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(result['OUTPUT'])

# SAGA

parameters_saga = {
    'A': 'big',
    'B': 'small',
    'SPLIT': True,
    'RESULT': 'memory:'
}

result_saga = processing.run("saga:difference", parameters_saga)

# nothing is added with this code
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(result_saga['RESULT'])


with the code of above I noticed that the big difference is in:

# QGIS
result['OUTPUT']
<qgis._core.QgsVectorLayer object at 0x7f92a8a479d8

and

#SAGA
result_saga['RESULT']
'memory:'


the same happens with GRASS. The algorithms work fine if the result is
saved as file

Am I missing something for SAGA and GRASS?

Thanks for all the suggestions

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Harrissou,

Andreas asked to use April to fill in new items.

Shall we give developers one more week, and then after that I promiss I

Anybody willing to promote writing for texts in the Changelog?

Hi Richard,

Yes, I saw Andreas request just after I sent the mail yesterday.
Sorry for the noise... or let's says that it was a reminder/call for
changelog contributors. :)

	confirm?
Message-ID: <CAFO80_rxo5EX0dgMoOdQuv2pH2FafUBkOxd4Ly_8a-1+0CG0Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi a colleague passed me a gpkg with a style that introduce GEOS exceptions
during rendering... what? geos errors for a style? exactly, before to strt
to investigate, I would like to have confirmation and/or if someone
encountered already the same problem

the data set to replicate with project is here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/hm5spy6un4vhogo/test_geopackage_symbology.zip?dl=0

here you can find three layer
1) the original geopackage (called geopackage) with a style that genereate
GEOS errors
2) a new geopackage (called capas_referencia) that is a "save as" of the
first one and with a similar style applied done manually (no GEOS errors
and rendering is fast)
3) a third geomackage (called capas_referencia2) that is a "save as" of the
first one where the style applied is a copy/paste of the style of the first
error => generate GEOS errors)

test has been executed on qgis3 win8/32b, qgis master win10/64, qgis master
on linux compiled version)

thank you in advance for any hint

yes, seen it too. Funny things is that the errors do not stop flooding
the log even after starting a new project :)

The layers cleaned with "Fix Geometries" in Processing come out just fine.

cheers!

the cleaned layer (no wrong geometries are available) works because you
don't apply cut&pasted style. Default style works normally.

Hi,

you have probably solved the problem, but for those with the same problem.
You can try install 'python-tcltk' library using OSGeo4W installer. It
helped me.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Issue running processing model from Python
Message-ID: <b49e9e066316d07c986b19a82905bb82@carto.net>

Hi, 

I want to run a model from Python code in QGIS 3.0x (recent nightly). 

Here is my code: 

------------------------------- 

def exportAnlagenAlsExcel():
    # Prepare processing framework
    from qgis.core import QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition
    from processing.core.Processing import Processing
    Processing.initialize()
    import processing
    parameters = {'vfewsanlagen':
QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition('Anlage', True),
'native:orderbyexpression_1:Ausgabedatei' : 'C:/temp/ews_anlagen.xlsx' }
    processing.run("model:Anlagen-Export",parameters,feedback=None)
    #open Resultatesfile in MS Excel
    command = 'start C:\\temp\\ews_anlagen.xlsx'
    os.system(command)
    iface.messageBar().pushInfo("Information",u"ExcelExport fertig") 

------------------- 

However, when running the script I get an error with a message I can't
interpret or solve: 

--------------- 

2018-04-25T08:09:51 WARNING Traceback (most recent call last): 

File "<string>", line 45, in exportAnlagenAlsExcel 

File
"C:/Programme/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis-rel-dev/./python/plugins\processing\tools\general.py",
line 84, in run 

return Processing.runAlgorithm(algOrName, parameters, onFinish,
feedback, context) 

File
"C:/Programme/OSGeo4W64/apps/qgis-rel-dev/./python/plugins\processing\core\Processing.py",
line 193, in runAlgorithm 

raise QgsProcessingException(msg) 

_core.QgsProcessingException: There were errors executing the algorithm.


--------------------------- 

Do you know what is wrong in my Python code above? I am pretty sure that
the very same code ran in an older version of QGIS 3. 

Thank you for your help, 

Andreas

HI,
I face exactly same issue (code was ok with 2.14 and failed with 2.18)
I solved it by removing :
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
and keep direct import :
from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg import NavigationToolbar2QT as NavigationToolbar
from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg import FigureCanvasQTAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure

Hi,

you have probably solved the problem, but for those with the same problem.
You can try install 'python-tcltk' library using OSGeo4W installer. It
helped me.

Hi Kurt,

these tools depend on the 3rd party Python package called "plotly".
So if this package is not available in the system, they will not be loaded.

BTW, it is exactly the same behaviour as in QGIS 2.x, the only difference
is that in QGIS 2.x they depends on matplotlib.

Hope this helps

Hi Tom, 

line 45 is 

processing.run("model:Anlagen-Export",parameters,feedback=None) 

The previous line is setting the parameters: 

parameters = {'vfewsanlagen':
QgsProcessingFeatureSourceDefinition('Anlage', True),
'native:orderbyexpression_1:Ausgabedatei' : 'C:/temp/ews_anlagen.xlsx' }


Thanks, 

Andreas

Sorry, not having worked with models, I don't know. Only thing I wonder is
whether it is a problem to have colons in a dictionary key
(native:orderbyexpression_1:Ausgabedatei).

Thanks for the info.  I didn't know about this one, I'll add it to the next installer upadate.  I verified that this does enable Graphics.

For now, you can install plotly with pip:

sudo pip3 install plotly

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can we remove a confirmation dialog in Refactor
	Fields algorithm?
Message-ID: <CANaz7mwRb4cixCJCdREamjuTifeZ7V_nz_zAvmMW_NS3=8AjXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,


In the Refactor Fields algorithm dialog there is an "Input layer" combo
box. Each time the user selects one layer a modal dialog (message box)
appears, letting her select whether the fields mapping should be reset or
not. See image: [1].


I'd like to ask you if we can get rid of such modal dialog for these
reasons:


1) In general, it's good to avoid modal dialogs as they block workflows and
hamper interaction.

2) Other algorithms don't use such dialog to warn users about potential
changes in other widgets (e.g., field combo boxes dependng on the selected
layer).

3) The dialog is only *useful* if the user clicks on the combo box by
accident and wants to avoid resetting the mapping (a very specific use
case). However, in that case the combo box shows that a new layer is
selected, but the mapping won't correspond to it, which is confusing.

4) Follow these steps:

  a. Open QGIS and load a vector layer.
  b. Open the Refactor Fields dialog and press ESC to close it.
  c. Add another vector layer to QGIS.
  d. Close the QGIS project.

As soon as you close the project (e.g., when you want to start a new one)
the modal  dialog shows up :(  (see this short video [2]).

5) The dialog is triggered too many times when using the "Fields Mapper"
widget in a custom Processing model (and triggering it from a plugin) (see
this short video [3]).



So, the question for you is: Can we get rid of it? I've created a PR for
that :D [4].


Regards,

Germán

That's not unheard of - e.g. a line layer rendered using a simple line
style with an offset applied is using GEOS to offset the lines. A lot
of other symbology settings also call out to QgsGeometry methods which
use GEOS under the hood.

Is this causing an actual error, or just spamming the log?

It's probably just missing a description file - these aren't generated
automatically.

Check the existing ones under
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description
and it should be straightforward to adapt an existing one.

If you succeed a PR would be very welcome!

No - neither SAGA nor GRASS have any concept of QGIS memory layers.
You need to give them a disk-based file path to save their outputs to.

If you use a memory layer as an input to these algs it will also have
to save it out to a disk based format, but this is done automatically
by saving to a file in the temp folder. We could potentially do the
same thing to allow SAGA/GRASS algs to output to a memory layer by
first saving the output to a shp in the temp folder, then loading that
file and copying the features to a memory layer. But it would be
rather inefficient and counter productive - you're still being forced
to loop over the disk-based format, so you're just adding extra
processing for little gain.

I'm VERY interested in seeing this resurrected. I'm available to
mentor this task if someone else wants to take ownership of the plugin
and do the port, OR alternatively I'd be happy for North Road to do
the porting ourselves and take over maintenance if someone can fund
this work.

that's good news. So starting a crowdfunding campaign seems a good way
to go, unless there is a bigger sponsor; do you agree?
All the best, and thanks.

so within a script (or a Processing plugin) both input layer and output
one have to come from a disk saved file.

Thanks for the explanation!

Not quite - the input layer doesn't *have* to, because processing will
automatically save it to a disk file if required.

Hi, 

Issue solved - turned out that the layer in the project file was renamed
(by a colleague) and hence processing could not find the feature source.
All works fine now. Silly me! 

However, the processing error message was really misleading and had no
indication that it could not find the layer. Nyall is going to fix the
error message - thanks! 

Sorry about the noise - it is a classic "beginners mistake" ;-)

That's not quite accurate. Even if they did have
such a concept, it would be of no use in this
context.

SAGA and GRASS commands run as separate processes,
in their own address spaces. Any reasonably secure
operating system (let's generously include Windows
and macOS in that category), will make sure that
processes cannot simply manipulate each other's
memory.

So QGIS needs to create temporary files to pass
both input and output data to/from GRASS/SAGA.

An alternative would be to refactor all
GRASS/SAGA modules as library objects so that they
could run in the same address space as QGIS.
That would probably also involve creating a new
interface API for use by QGIS (or other "host GIS").

Note that we are talking about C/C++ binaries here.
So one would also need to inspect every single GRASS/SAGA
binary and library for memory leaks (which can currently
be ignored, because memory is freed by the OS as soon as
the GRASS/SAGA commands' process ends).

In the case of SAGA, all this auto-creating files
is not too bad, because SAGA uses simple shapefiles
for vector data.

In the case of GRASS, this is a more complicated matter.
GRASS uses a fully topological vector format and all
input data will go through rigorous topology testing
by default. The more intermediate steps, the higher
the risk that data will get crippled in the process.
Note that GRASS now has an alternative way of linking
to external data instead of importing it:

https://grass.osgeo.org/grass74/manuals/v.external.html

So perhaps it would be a good idea for the QGIS GRASS
provider to offer v.external as an alternative to
v.in.ogr for piping QGIS vector layers into the GRASS
backend (however, read "NOTES" on the page cited above!).

Best,

Ben

Hello Germán

Note that I've already fixed some related problems with

Calling deleteLater should delete the dialog on next events processing.
Do dialog and child widgets signals should be correctly disconnected.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing tests for SAGA
Message-ID: <e7346d33-86e9-feb1-bcfd-ad3c4cb35759@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I found some broken SAGA algorithms (just the name of the parameters).
Just one simple question: are the SAGA tests resurrected? I see the test
file is available again:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/41a27f700ff7806cfe29490a757959adfd4f324b#diff-c567084a3d3994247ea380ed25ffff49

is it worth to add other tests or this is still a work in progress?

Thanks

Matteo

Hi Arnaud,


the videos I included in the first message of this thread were recorded
using QGIS master. So, probably the PR you mentioned (which was merged in
2017) didn't fully fix it, since this specific dialog is still showing up
when closing the project.

As a long-time R spatial developer and QGIS user I'll be glad to help out -
but time-poor at work for now. "Helping out" may be more  like "making
unreasonable suggestions" and "finding annoying bugs".

For example, can we find a more efficient way to transfer data from QGIS to
R? Can the new `sf` packages in R work with the data straight out of QGIS'
memory? I *think* the `sf` package stores vector data in GDALs native C++
objects, and if QGIS is doing that too then we *might* be able to get
access from QGIS and R if we write the R plugin as a C/C++ module that
dynamically links with the shareable libR.so.

The current R processing plugin  converts QGIS layers to shapefiles, reads
them into a new R process. On occasion I've hit problems with shapefile
limitations (field name length, usually) that make my scripts fail. Maybe
it should go via geopackage instead.

Should it create `sp` objects on the R side or `sf` objects? This could be
controllable in the R processing script headers, so it can be set on a
per-script basis.

I'll stop now...

Barry

Message-ID: <CABPxTTpkxPqaSPRbNVXZ=zaYViygQGXeS76bMYxFaXZ2bnjgMw@mail.gmail.com>

Where do I find the format for the parameters of the processing description
files. I have figured out  some of them, but for
QgsProcessingParameterRasterDestination I would like to set it as optional
and to skip it by default. This is the string that I have.

QgsProcessingParameterRasterDestination|uncertainty|Name of uncertainty
output map|None|True

This almost does it, but it does not set it to "Skip Output".

Thanks,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Suggestion for improved macOS build compatibility
	testing
Message-ID: <c4882890-6a26-0703-3f2e-67ad18cd9482@comcast.net>

Hi all,

Both yesterday and today, the macOS build failed due to missing CMake 
INCLUDE specifications.

MacOS puts each framework in a separate directory while Linux merges 
everything into /usr/local. Thus, Linux commits will compile when a new 
dependency is added as long as some other dependency already specifies 
/usr/local.

Here is an idea that would help macOS build compatibility. Place each 
dependency on the verification build machine in a separate directory such as
/usr/local/gdal-2.2.3/
/usr/local/geos-3.6.1/

This would make commits fail upfront on Linux if CMake INCLUDES needed 
by macOS were missing.

Hi Tom,

Sorry to hear that. In the past we had macOS continuous integration
tests in place but had to disable them, because the package manager used
there (homebrew) was breaking dependencies unpredictably (I don't think
that's unexpected news for you if you are building on mac though ;) )

There is no "verification machine" on linux, but there is a docker
image. However I am not sure how easy it is to modify this image put
headers in different folders and make all the executables (xxx-config)
return the modified paths - while keeping the infrastructure maintainable.

Alternatively, I would very much like to get the mac builds back up and
running. I don't think we can do this again with the upstream homebrew
repo since we don't want our pull requests flagged erroneous for
external problems. The best alternative I see is, that we need a curated
list of formulae in a separate repository, which would not only help the
testing but potentially also the release process. Would you be
interested in taking a lead on this?

Best regards

Matthias

True...

Not sure what a good solution is here. Those geos warnings are often
very handy to see and for users to be aware of.

Got any ideas?

Yes please! The SAGA tests are enabled for both master and 3.0 Travis

They are directly mapped to the arguments given to the constructor for
QgsProcessingParameterRasterDestination:

https://qgis.org/api/classQgsProcessingParameterRasterDestination.html#aabd2f826354f38db8d9d47767d0015cd

Currently, to set the output to skipped by default, you need to call
setCreateByDefault(False) on the created parameter. So unfortunately
you can't set the parameter as skip-by-default from the grass
description files. https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6873 adds the
argument to the constructor, so when that PR is merged you'll be able
to do this by adding an extra bool argument to the end of the
parameter definition string in the description file.

This was already done in 3.0 - if you check Processing Options, Grass
provider, there's a setting to use v.external instead of v.in.ogr.
It's on by default.

Don't undersell yourself... these would be very valuable contributions!

I've (very roughly) looked into this, and I also believe it should be
possible to directly create R data frames from QGIS layers. Then we'd
just need to add a "R console" to QGIS, and boom! Awesome spatial
statistical analysis tool directly within QGIS!

Hi Andreas,

Should be fixed by https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6874 . I'd
greatly value a test of that branch with the invalid project/model
combination to confirm that you get a helpful error message.

Hi Devs,

now Denis created the beautiful python api docs,
and knowing the api url of qgis:

https://qgis.org/api
https://qgis.org/api/2.18/
https://qgis.org/api/master/

and faintly knowing it started with 'python.qgs.org' I tried:

http://python.qgis.org/api/
and
http://python.qgis.org/
to find out it had to be
http://python.qgis.org/master/

We also have
http://api.qgis.org ... pointing to knowhere.

I propose (plz show me better alternatives, or reasoning):

to not use python.qgis.org, but only api.qgis.org

api.qgis.org -> index page in website (TBD), pointing to:

api.qgis.org/api/master (being an) altname for qgis.org
api.qgis.org/api/2.18   (altname, so qgis.org/api/2.18 works too)
(keeping api in path as it has been there for x years)

api.qgis.org/python/master (being a redirect to the githubpage?)
api.qgis.org/python/2.18

Comments? (Denis, please let me know if have a problem with this_

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I like your proposition a lot.



Using http://qgis.org/pyqgis/_VERSION_ would also work:
+ it makes the term pyqgis a bit more known and would be a nice keyword for
google searches
+ we could officially drop the api subdomain in the url (although keeping
it working as you mentionned)
- it's less obvious that it's python

That would give:
http://qgis.org/pyqgis/master
http://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.0 (there is no 2.18 ;) )
http://qgis.org/api/master
etc.

Just let me know when you want me to change the URLs.

Best wishes,
Denis

QGIS can read vector tiles with the Vector Tiles Reader plugin. It cannot
write them.

Hi all,
Was playing around with the custom python expressions which are super cool and I noticed they don't propagate in QGIS Server and maybe I'm doing something wrong (I only tried copying the .py files to the equivalent directory). Anyone has a clue if this should work and if it's not implemented already, how big the effort would be?Should I open a feature request ticket?
Thank you,
Tudor

Hi Tudor,

I guess you will have good chances that you can write a server plugin
and register your custom expressions in the class factory.

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/server.html

For reference how to register expressions have a look at the
expressionplus plugin.

Mayer there's an easier way too which I don't know

Travelling I can't check proposal... First idea it was managed in wms
provider, not repeating the same message after 1000 instances. Or managing
it before GEOS check... Silent after 1000th failed check.. BTW I don't have
code with me

Cheers

Hi Matthias,

I build QGIS dependencies mostly from source. I don't use homebrew or 
macports. When I started, fink was popular and very useful for the first 
few months. Once I became familiar with Unix-style tools however, 
building directly from source was less problematic than dealing with the 
external issues in package managers.

Currently, I install Qt binaries and Kyngchaos frameworks and use 
configure/make for everything else. I can document the steps. I haven't 
in the past because people asking for mac builds have said they are not 
developers.

After review of my build process, we can determine if it can be automated.

Tom

Big +1 for this and nightly builds :)

Question: Was there any thought on using QT 5.10 in the official MacOSX
distribution? Currently we are using 5.9.3.

See:

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18786

It looks like there are different 'paths' in which expressions are solved.

Somebody can tell if this should be best solved in
- QGIS (to create a better 'sql' string)
- GDAL (fix pickyness with brackets?)

Nyall,

You were right. It is just missing the description file. I have created a
description file for this function. Would it be best to send it to someone
who is already a QGIS committer or should I attempt to do a pull request?

Thanks,

Calvin

I'm sure a PR would be much more welcome (speaking as someone who has only
ever done a docs layout PR for QGIS).

Hi Richard,

I need to add an entry before this deadline, but I can't find the link
to create a new entry anymore!

Am I missing something?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Preparing for the next LTR
Message-ID: <e58e455f-65db-ad05-80ab-ce0717696e23@faunalia.it>

Dear QGIS users and developers,

As you know, QGIS 3 has recently been published. This version introduced
big changes in the code structure that, in addition to the new
functionalities already exposed, makes our code base more modern and
easier to expand and improve on in the future.

As a normal by-product of such a huge overhaul, these changes also
triggered a series of new issues, that you, our users are helping to
discover and document. Our objective is to eliminate the most important
of these issues in time for what will be our next Long Term Release
(LTR) - version 3.4. This release is scheduled for October 2018[0]. The
resources available from QGIS.ORG funds are limited, and we have already
invested in QGIS 3.0 far more than we have done for any previous version.

Now is those a great time for users, and particularly for power users,
larger institutions and enterprises, to invest in QGIS bugfixing. You
have a number of different options: donating your developers' time or
hiring a developer directly to resolve the bugs that annoy you most,
sponsoring our foundation[2], or donating[3] to QGIS.ORG.

Our targets are:

* 20k€ within 2018-05-18 (for 3.2)
* 40k€ within 2018-09-14 (for 3.4)

If you would like to help, feel free to contact us for further details!
