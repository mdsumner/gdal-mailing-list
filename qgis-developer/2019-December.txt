Message-ID: <E89F6E00-0D81-45E2-94D4-482F6D366AE6@kyngchaos.com>

I'm slowly working on updating everything to build my QGIS 3.10 Mac package, and found a disparity between PROJ and SAGA.

I want to have PROJ 6 (and GDAL 3) for QGIS (should be fully supported in QGIS 3.10.1), but found a problem with SAGA.  QGIS is still using SAGA 2.3 (LTS) for API stability.  SAGA 2.3 is stuck on PROJ.4.  It's only the latest SAGA, v7.4 that finally updated for PROJ 6 support.

I must then build and include both PROJ 6 and PROJ.4 in the QGIS package.

But, looking at the Processing-SAGA algorithms, I see no mention of proj, or pj, SAGA modules.  So, maybe then I don't need PROJ.4 after all?  Is there any interdependency within SAGA that some other SAGA module needs to use the proj module?

There is no option to build SAGA without PROJ, but I could hack the makefiles to skip it.  Or I could build it with the old PROJ and just not include those modules in the QGIS package.

>From https://packages.debian.org/sid/saga , I see that SAGA has a dependency 
to both GDAL and PROJ. If your GDAL is a GDAL 3, it must be built against PROJ 
6. If you build SAGA against GDAL 3 and PROJ 4 or 5, then SAGA will 
effectively link against 2 different PROJ versions. This is a perfect recipee 
for potential runtime crashes in SAGA depending on how lucky/unlucky you are 
regarding the order into which libraries and symbols are loaded and resolved.

Forwarding a request for assistance from the PROJ mailing list -- this
is a great opportunity for our Spanish, Catalan, Austrian, Slovakian
and Brazilian communities to contribute (amongst others!)

To: <proj at lists.osgeo.org>


Hi,

I'm requesting help from good wills of the community to help us grow
our datasets of grids at
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/
Below a few candidates I've identified, mentionned in EPSG and with a
number of them with
download links, but license clarification would be needed.

Community members from those countries are probably in a better
position than me to
connect with the relevant authority and see if they'd be willing to
adopt one of the licenses
mentionned at https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid#about-the-datum-grid-package

Spain
-----

* Peninsula and Baleares:

Anyone from the Spanish community to help clarifying license of
https://www.fomento.gob.es/recursos_mfom/gridshift1.zip (ED50 to ETRS89),
presumably whith IGN Spain

The download link is accessible from
https://www.fomento.gob.es/organos-colegiados/consejo-superior-geografico/csg/etrs89/etrs89-nuevo-sistema-de-referencia-geodesico-oficial-en-espana

This file has a sort of CC license
(https://gist.github.com/rouault/1ff4ad2d8053e068f9dbf451572692f4) but with a
annoying non-modification clause that makes it incompatible with our
requirements
(we might want to transform it to another format like GeoTIFF),
and no version/link to the actual CC license.

* Catalonia:

Grid specific to Catalonia for ED50 to ETRS89 : 100800401.gsb
File found in http://www.icgc.cat/content/download/48766/337962/version/1/file/Malla_NTv2_11_03.zip
but no explicit license mention.
https://www.icgc.cat/en/Web/Help/Legal-notice has a vague mention of
Creative Commons,
but no precise identification of which variant of it, and which version.

Austria
-------

The AT_GIS_GRID.gsb grid for MGI to ETRS89 is available at
http://www.bev.gv.at/portal/page?_pageid=713,2157075&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL
:

http://www.bev.gv.at/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/BEV_PORTAL_CONTENT_ALLGEMEIN/0200_PRODUKTE/UNENTGELTLICHE_PRODUKTE_DES_BEV/GIS-Grid.zip

Copyright info I could find is
"Hinsichtlich seiner Datenbanken verfügt das BEV über das ausschließliche
Werknutzungsrecht gemäß §§ 40f bis 40h UrhG und das sui generis-Recht
gemäß §§ 76c bis 76e UrhG."

which by itself is not super promising.

Slovakia
--------

https://www.geoportal.sk/en/geodeticke-zaklady/download/ offers for
download 3 grids
referenced by EPSG:
Slovakia_ETRS89h_to_Baltic1957.gtx
Slovakia_ETRS89h_to_EVRF2007.gtx
Slovakia_JTSK03_to_JTSK.LAS / .LOS

I've emailed the contact mentionned on the site to get info regarding
the license.
But wouldn't hurt to get feedback of knowledgeable people too.

Brazil
------

Looking for official download links & license for the following:

Corrego Alegre 1961 to SIRGAS 2000: CA61_003.gsb
Corrego Alegre 1970-72 to SIRGAS 2000: CA7072_003.gsb
SAD69 to SIRGAS 2000: SAD69_003.gsb
SAD69(96) to SIRGAS 2000: SAD96_003.gsb

https://www.killetsoft.de/p_gdln_e.htm has download links but official
ones from IBGE
would be preferable if possible.


Of course there are certainly gaps to fill for other countries I've
not mentionned...

Ehh... the frustrating saga with SAGA continues...

I suggest we do a gross hack and whitelist SAGA 7.4. It'll be broken
in parts, but as I see it saga support in qgis is (and always has
been) hit-or-miss. Numerous devs have tried to fix this, even to the
extent of there being two 3rd party plugins which tried to expose
newer saga support (one by Alex Bruy, one by myself). No-one has
showed the slightest interest in these plugins or stepping up to
maintain them.

For QGIS 4 we need to revisit earlier discussions, and I'll be pushing
as hard as I possibly can for us to completely drop SAGA support in
master and shaft all this mess off to plugins to deal with.

SAGA 7.3.0 is the new LTS, and supports PROJ 6.

You should upgrade to that.

I know, I made that plugin, in the hope that it would be adopted by
motivated community members who wanted to see a newer saga version
utilised. Spoiler: it didn't.

Hi all,

* I can load them from DB Manager and (for 3.10) from the Browser
* I can save them in a project, but what I reopen it they are displayed
in the legend, not in the canvas
* after reopening the project, subsequent attempts of loading rasters
fail with:

Looks like a bug, confirmed?

I do not confirm: works for me, but of course my test environment is
guaranteed to be very different than yours.

I'd say it is expected and completely predictable. Same happened with OTB.
When it broke our CI, QGIS devs were fixing it, not community members who
insisted on inclusion.

Hi, side note, I missed the existence of this SAGA plugin.
Maybe I missed some communication somewhere, and if so, I'm not the only
one.
So, It might be worth giving it another chance maybe.

Of course, a crowdfunding or a QGIS grant is always an option.
Another long standing idea from Victor is to include in QGIS all the
relevant code from SAGA; of course this option has its drawbacks too.
The fact is that a minority of users, especially power ones, need very
specific functions since now and then, the usual 10% functions for 90%
of users+90% of functions for 10% of users paradox.
Cheers.

Not to forget, that SAGA GIS evolves very fast. There are several new,
modern algorithms from version to version in the codebase. Normally,
these new algorithms work as expected out of the box (within SAGA GIS).
If not, the small core team find a solution within hours, at least
within a few days.

I am voting for keeping the SAGA GIS LTS version, but find a way to
change from 2.3.x to 7.3.x version.

Saying this, I must also note, that I have no skills with C/C++ and can
not help directly. Apopogoies for this :(  Of course, I can help to test ...

Best wishes,
Rainer Hurling (maintainer of the FreeBSD ports of SAGA GIS and QGIS)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 2019 Grant Final reports: Rendering optimisation
	and labeling work
Message-ID: <CAB28Asjvr5NuMBFEfh1BPNVed+zKtnf84QEsYnNaJ02jbTNaYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi PSC, devs,

Following the submission of the last part of our 2019 grant work, here's a
report detailing what was undertaken and achieved thanks to these two
funding grants:


*Profile and optimise the QGIS vector rendering code*

One of the most critical and important functions in the QGIS application is
rendering of vector map layers. QGIS has an extremely powerful and flexible
vector symbology engine, capable of some mind blowing cartography and
visual effects. For efficient use on both the desktop and server, users
require that QGIS rendering is as fast as it possibly can be!

During this grant project, we conducted in-depth research into code "hot
spots" and inefficiencies in the QGIS rendering code using a number of code
profiling tools. This work resulted in many optimisations, including:

   - Cache painter path for font marker when it doesn't change (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30860) - around 2x speed up for font
   marker rendering
   - Optimise checking for active properties (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30861)
   - Fix expensive file modified time check is applied with every check of
   svg/image cache (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30862) - dramatic
   speed up for SVG marker rendering (and SVG rendering across QGIS in general)
   - Optimise reading of multipoints from OGR (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30863) - speeds up use of multipoint
   layers across QGIS in general (not just rendering)
   - Don't perform costly calculation of symbol output units which we don't
   use (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30864) - speeds up all vector
   rendering operations
   - Fix unnecessary calculation of marker symbol bounds when labeling is
   not required for a layer and symbols layers are in place (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30865) - speeds up rendering of simple
   marker points matching this situation by around 3x
   - Fix large speed regression in evaluating string equality expressions (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30866) - dramatic improvement of
   expression calculation times across all of QGIS
   - Avoid expensive symbol clones during label rendering (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30867)
   - Speed up copying of paint effects (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30868)
   - Add a reserve method to QgsGeometryCollection (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30892) - speeds up use of multi
   geometry types across all of QGIS
   - Avoid storing and cloning paint effects for layers if they are just
   the default stack unchanged (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30896)
   - Optimizations for shapeburst rendering (
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/30982)
   - Much faster copying of expression contexts with a project scope

While the focus of this work was on the vector rendering code, some of the
optimisations implemented have resulted in dramatic improvements across
other parts of QGIS also (such as certain Processing algorithms).

These optimisations were made available in the QGIS 3.10.0 release, with
selected low-risk optimisations also being backported to the QGIS 3.4 LTR
series.

*"Rebalance" the labeling engine and fix poor automatic label placement
choices*

While QGIS has a powerful engine sitting behind its automatic label
placement, the labeling results generated by this engine were often
unpredictable and frustrating for users. Labels were frequently positioned
over other features, and regardless of how heavily users tweaked the
various label settings it could be impossible to avoid these unwanted
labels. Furthermore, the settings for controlling individual layer label
and feature obstacle priorities generally had no discernible effect on the
actual placement of labels on the map.

During this work project we commenced by safe guarding the existing label
placement logic with a series of new carefully designed unit tests covering
a range of different label placement situations. We then used these
reference tests as a guide and re-worked the label placement engine
logic. Now, labels will never be placed over features from a layer with a a
higher obstacle weight when compared to the label's priority.

This logic dramatically simplifies the effect of labeling settings for
users, avoiding the complexities and bugs which were present in the older
approach.

In order to avoid disrupting existing projects, the new labeling logic is
only used for newly created projects in QGIS 3.12 and later. We added a
mechanism to allow users to manually upgrade existing projects to the newer
logic, via the project's label settings dialog.

Lastly, we used this opportunity to invest some much-needed time in
modernising and cleaning up the labeling engine code, to help make it
easier to understand and maintain in future.

Message-ID: <e2e8874f-5f8f-aa12-2293-fe5e295b3548@duif.net>

Hi,

Wanting to test something temporarily, I copy an (arbitrary) shp file to
my /tmp dir (on Linux).

I open the shp file (via the Data Source Manager) and browse/open the
shp in the /tmp dir.

The shp opens fine, BUT in the layermanager I see the little 'memory'
icon, as if this is a memory layer??

Also: if I try to close the project (after or before saving it), I get
the warning "This project includes one or more temporary layers. These
layers are not permanently saved and their contents will be lost. Are
you sure you want to proceed?"

Strangely, if I reopen a saved project, the shp (as memory layer) is
opened fine.

BUT... these are not really temporary layers.. these are real shapes
(well, in my /tmp dir, but... as long as I do not restart they are there
and should work... I think).

Is this by design? Or is it a bug because there is 'tmp' in the path?
I tested also to put it in ~/tmp but then it is OK...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

By design -- it was added because many of the processing providers
which rely on 3rd party utilities (e.g. grass, saga) put temporary
outputs there, and users weren't getting any warnings that these are
just temporary. Basically the warning which previously showed only for
memory layers has been extended to include anything inside the
operating system's temporary folder (i.e. /tmp, but not ~/tmp on
Linux).

Ah, thanks Nyall. I understand the reasoning, and agree...

Though it does not feel as perfect yet:

The memory tooltip of this layer says:
 "Temporary Layer Only. Contents will be discarded after closing QGIS"
But compared to a real memory layer, it is still there if you reopen the
project (or quit/open QGIS).
So it seems we mix two concepts?

Thinking out loud here, I know this will all cost time/energy, so I
understand if this is ignored...

What about leaving out the 'memory' icon, and only warn users IF they
have layers in temporary places? And instead of:
"This project includes one or more temporary layers. These layers are
not permanently saved and their contents will be lost. Are you sure you
want to proceed?"
Something like:
"This project includes one or more layers which are saved in temporary
directories". If you want to keep that data, please save or copy the
data to non-temporary dirs" ?

Or as bonus: maybe thing of some icon for these processing output
layers: maybe the little 'gear'-icon we use for processing?
In the case of a processing output I will then see the little gear icons
(AND get the warning).
In my usecase I will only get the warning (and I will ignore it :-) )

As said: I understand there are probably more important things to do,
just wanted to think about it a little...

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I agree with you that in-memory layer and file-based layers stored in
temporary folders are two different things and we should try to not mix the
concepts.

>From a UX perspective they both deserve a warning/icon that reminds the
user that they will be eventually lost if not action is taken, we just need
to make sure that the user understands the difference.

I'd open a question dialog in both cases when the layers are unloaded but I
would choose a (slightly?) different icon to mark the memory and tmp layers
and certainly a different tooltip message.


Cheers

Message-ID: <50c8f7ab-a53c-4a8e-2a47-6391fdd4a839@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
OTB algs apparently do not work on QGIS 3.10 out of the box:

* if a raster output is not explicitly selected I get an error:
“.raster.out.tif” files are not supported as outputs for this algorithm

* if a vector output  is not explicitly selected (with filename.ext) I
get another error:
2019-12-03 12:30:43 (FATAL) Segmentation: itk::ERROR: No OGR driver
known to OTB to create and handle a DataSource named
</tmp/processing_1845b856b9b44fa79bd7d1f2f834ffa0/processing_5bc31a5446744fff806de1d05d4b0240/4083978a97c840adbe135f8409847bfd/mode.vector.out.file>.

If confirmed I can open two tickets.

Additionally (but this must be done by OTB itself, nothing to do with QGIS):

ERROR 1: TopologyException: Input geom 1 is invalid: Ring

I have an external windows standalone python application that uses pyqgis.
When I display a QgsRendererPropertiesDialog, python crashes when the user
clicks on any color button (screenshot: http://psr.me/1903oq2). The problem
seems to be in displaying the color dialog. In previous QGis versions I
could avoid this problem by using:

        settings = QgsSettings()
        settings.setValue('qgis/native_color_dialogs', True)

QGis then used another color dialog that did not crash my application.
However, since I updated to QGis 3.8.3 (OSGEO4W) this option no longer
works. Apparently this option has been removed.

I also noticed that QGis uses a color dialog different from the one that
appears in my application. How can I configure my application (from pyqgis)
to use the same dialog?

I wrote a very small PyQt5 application (below, at the end) that reproduces
the problem. Any thoughts on how to fix this?

Operating system: Windows 10 Home
Python version: 3.7.0 (OSGEO4W)
QGis version: 3.8.3 (OSGEO4W)

Thanks,
Marcelo Metello

yes of course, but this has proven to be very hard for us to keep this
pace within QGIS, especially when in SAGA fundamental modules like
io_gdal change parameters names without keeping retro-compability with
previous releases. Also modules change name frequently from one
release to another (as also their parameters). This is the main reason
we decided to stop trying support every latest release and so stick
with the LTR one.

Said that if the "official" way to support SAGA would be a plugin it
would be much easier to implement and distribute/update such changes.

I checked the daily performance tests for QGIS server available at

Do you have ideas of tests we could add to this framework?

If I recall correctly this was discussed a lot in the mailing lists
before 3.0 release
and most developers involved into Processing support was agains keeping SAGA
and adding any new providers while some community members were pushing hard
to keep them. Final decision at the Madeira meeting was to keep SAGA and include
OTB with one of the arguments that this way it will be easier for
community to maintain
them. Now we have SAGA in core and at least 2 plugins for SAGA and very little
(I'd even say zero) community involvement in any of them.

Do we really want to restart this discussion? I don't think that two
involved parties
have changed their mind. Also it is probably too early as no breaking
changes can
be made before 4.0 and even if we make a decision now it anyway very likely will
be revised again before release as it happened last time.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] BWTA2017 grid support in QGIS >= 3.10
Message-ID: <CAD3koGkbOGFAm1A1F56fjQ1GC+6qPJudteSGY1Cce2zkYWB0_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello QGIS-devs,

in QGIS2 and QGIS-3 versions with proj<6 there was a support for the
BWTA2017.gsb-gridfile which is needed in the state Baden-Württemberg (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg ) in southwest germany
to transform between the former official crs EPSG31467 and the new one
EPSG25832:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6980


For some time there was an issue about including the BWTA in the
proj-datumgrid.

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/issues/22

The main reason why QGIS 3.10/proj6 cannot use the BWTA2017.gsb is that it
is not referenced in the EPSG registry so far but I will get in contact
with the LGL (www.lgl-bw.de) to ask them if they can make a changerequest
on http://www.epsg.org/EPSGDataset/Makechangerequest.aspx

For the meantime there are two pull requests which have been merged today:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/pull/65
and
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/1759 ( Even Rouault:"...As EPSG has no
entry for it, we create a grid_transformation, as well as a dedicated area
of use based on the extent of the grid, under the PROJ authority. With the
hope to be able to remove it once EPSG has an entry...")

@Jürgen Fischer: is there a change that you could "cherry-pick" the
corresponding pull requests and patch them into the existing PROJ release
used by osgeo4w for the upcoming pointrelease?

regards,
Thomas

Just wants to note that a PROJ 6.3.0 release, with the
accompanying proj-datumgrid-XXXX backages, is scheduled for the beginning of 
January.

If you're checking nightly releases, you'd need to track back a couple
of months to before the work began in order to compare (since the
changes have been drip fed in over a couple of months).

Or alternatively you could compare against a 3.6 build (since many of
the optimisations were backported to 3.4 and 3.8/3.10).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Processing: questions on temporary files
Message-ID: <e18aa7ad541df74d4ca4c8d93bb33bdc@carto.net>

Hi, 

I noticed that when running processing algorithms and also models, that
both the in between results, but also end results are only kept in
memory and the end result ends up as memory layer, if I use the Option
"Create Temporary Layer". 

I'd like to better understand how QGIS processing works. What happens in
such a case if the data is really, really big? Would it crash the
machine, or switch from memory layer to a real file "automagically"? If
yes, how would this be decided? Or is it the responsibility of the OS to
swap such really large temporary layers into files, without the user
noticing? 

Or is the user responsible for that and needs to switch to a file as the
output instead of the option "Create temporary layer"? 

In my opinion, the term "Create temporary layer", from a user
perspective, doesn't necessarily mean "Create Memory layer". A temporary
layer could also be stored in disk. 

Thanks for shedding some light on the behaviour of processing! 

Andreas

There is no logic to check input size, so QGIS will try to keep it in memory.
It is user responsibility to decide if using temporary output makes
sense with his data.

> In my opinion, the term "Create temporary layer", from a user perspective, doesn't necessarily mean "Create Memory layer". A temporary layer could also be stored in disk.

I think this wording is historical thing. Previously Processing was
using real temporary files
to store intermediate and final outputs. When developing QGIS 3.0 we
have switched to
memory layers but have not adjusted this placeholder text.

	shadows mean?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSqD+a_-RkmX3=dETBk3gj29tGvbde6fPuDewPtatTDD1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

When setting a shadow item for a label there's a "Blur only alpha pixels"
option (see
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/style_library/label_settings.html#shadow-tab
)
I'm unable to understand what it's supposed to do and there's a report in
the docs source (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues/4264)
that mentions that it's a buggy feature. I can't tell but would like to
know if anyone understands what this should do, and whether it does it. ;(

Seems that interesting/starting point codes might be
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/129165a1001deb4b071c0b1d037e09d10f042ffc/src/core/qgstextrenderer.cpp#L1287

Hi Paolo,

I'm using OTB (6.6.1 and 7.0.0) with QGIS 3.10.0, without any problem, but
I'm on Windows.

About the issues you reported (".raster.out.tif" and vectors not being
loaded), I think this thread can explain almost all of them (I had the same
doubts some time ago):

https://gitlab.orfeo-toolbox.org/orfeotoolbox/qgis-otb-plugin/issues/30

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

I don't see why on Linux it shouldn't work on Linux (6.6.1 as well).

sorry, its 7.0.0 not 6.6.1

Obrigado Pedro.
I don't see why on Linux it shouldn't work on Linux (6.6.1 as well).

Hi Paolo and list,

I am using the Segmentation algorithm on Linux without major problems. 
(OTB 6.6 and now 7.0 with QGIS 3.10).  But indeed it does not work out 
of the box:
Even when raster output does not not apply to the Segmentation alg , a 
"bogus" value would have to be entered in the output box to avoid an 
exception and get the alg running.

Also, the OTB processing provider settings interface has some issues:
when I try to change configuration values (namely the amount of max RAM 
), I get an error " argument has unexpected type  'int' "

Best regards,
Aron

Hi Paolo,

Tested here in Ubuntu Xenial, both with OTB 7.0.0 or 6.6.1, and QGIS 3.4.13
(OTB plugin), everything works, but with the issues reported by Aron.

Best regards,
Pedro

I can confirm it works, but not out of the box: without adding a
filename for raster and vector output I get the error described.
There is a crash due to specific geometry issue, as reported, but this
is related to specific data (available for testing if useful).
Cheers.

Right, hence the recent change to also expose warnings for files
stored in /tmp folders...

It's also because we don't expose anywhere in the QGIS GUI the term
"memory layer". That's an internal, code detail. Everything in QGIS
app refers to these as "temporary scratch layers".

Would it crash the machine, or switch from memory layer to a real file "automagically"? If yes, how would this be decided? Or is it the responsibility of the OS to swap such really large temporary layers into files, without the user noticing?

Yes -- a memory layer is currently purely "memory only", and it's up
to the os to decide what to do if the available ram runs out. (On
linux this usually results in the app crashing, on Windows it'll start
smashing the hard disk and grind to a halt).

What's needed/missing is a method for the memory data provider to
detect when a layer is growing too large, and start writing this out
to disk. (Important note: we CAN'T use any of the standard spatial
formats for this (as they are lossy when compared to the memory
provider support), so we'd need to directly serialize the memory layer
features to a custom binary format, with indexing support for rapid
retrieval of features.

If I understand correct, FME is also working with (indexed) temp files?
I'm not an FME user, so I can bu wrong, but I always wondered what kind
of format that is...

IF we (as FOSS community) could come up with some (new?) indexed file
format, it (besides being a in-between product for transformations) also
a potential data exchange format (maybe some zipped version of file+index?)?

Anybody into this?

Hi all,

I just noticed that the data defined button for the opacity slider is
available only with the Raster Image style type. Is that by design?

If not should I open a feature request?

FYI, the qgis-dev package is currently broken, reporting it can't start
because proj_7_0.dll is missing. I think some dll referencing needs
updating (proj recently renamed its forthcoming branch to 6.3, and I can
see a proj_6_3.dll floating around).

Hi Nirvn,

Yesterday I saw the update from proj-dev 7.0.0-57 to proj-dev 6.3.0-8 on
OSGeo4W. I suspected that it would break QGIS because it was compiled
against proj-dev 7.0. So, I didn't proceed with the update. I think it was
a good option! :)

But I believe that should be fixed in the next build.

Best regards,
Pedro

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Onboarding Day?
Message-ID: <b674b0ac-e9eb-5188-af82-afbb27d7b190@terglobo.nl>

Dear Devs,

Making plans for the next hackfest (13-15 March 2020, The Netherlands) 
we are thinking of a way to attract new people to the project. Quite 
some Dutch people are interested to come over and "see" us, but of 
course we need to help them getting up and running.

So we are thinking on doing an "Onboarding Day" the day prior to the HF 
(Thursday March 12) with workshops teaching:

- How to translate?
- How to write documentation?
- How to compile?
etc...

We already noticed Alessandro's offer to do a Mentor Stream on "my first 
pull request" which would also fit this idea.

Just curious, what are your thoughts on this? And would you like to 
arrive one day earlier in the lovely Netherland to warmly welcome new 
contributors?

Thanks,
Raymond (and Rosa and Aron)

Hi Raymond, 

I think it is a good idea. I was about to ask if we can already arrive
on the 12th - but I guess this would answer my question. 

I could talk about ways to "support" QGIS financially (just a really
short talk summarizing how one can contribute and how the funds are
used, but maybe useful). 

Greetings, 

Andreas

arrange something.

Hi,
that's a big +1 for the onboarding idea. And yes Andrea, a short talk on
how to contribute financially, followed by an open discussion is clearly
something helpfull. I'll be glad to participate or help.

Hi, 

I got information from Matthias, that the new "Temporary Output Folder
Path" is only used by algorithms around GDAL, SAGA and ExecuteSQL, and
not for vector based QGIS algorithms. I don't know about GRASS -
probably this also runs through files? 

I think we need to address this issue with priority, ideally also with
at backport to our LT version 3.10. Running large vector files always
through memory sounds dangerous to me. It can easily bring a system to
halt. 

The question is, if the switch between memory only operations, or disk
based operations can be determined by software or if it requires user
intervention. Often, it is hard to guess in advance, whether an
algorithm runs out of memory or not. Certainly our average users would
have no idea about this. 

I wonder, how other systems do it? As far as I know, FME always does
things disk based, to stay on the safe side - or am I wrong? 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Raymond,

Really nice initiative, with a very suggestive name.

I've added a stream "Get my first QGIS Server up and running..." to the
event page.

Best regards,

Yes, the rebuild has picked the new proj up.

Rhere also a new qgis-ltr now - and new standalones for 3.4.13.

As that also required updates to the build scripts in the release branch -
tomorrows 3.4.14 should be almost the same - except for some translations…

Testing 3.4.13, it looks like you've successfully found a solution to
use gdal < 3 and proj < 6 for the 3.4 build?

Great work!!

FlatGeoBuf indeed looks very exciting!

But to be honest, I think an easier path would be just to directly
serialize the qgis features to disk -- we already have
QgsFeature::operator<< and >> to read and write features to data
streams (without loss of any information), so we could utilise those
during the disk read/write.

	dependencies
Message-ID: <CAFAduOTz=tvGnttAyRY3PksXz6+tuxFgiVXN3FahkhfmHfSm2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I install QGIS on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine with ubuntugis-unstable
dependencies. A few days ago, the ubuntugis-unstable repo updated it's
packages for Bionic (GDAL 3, PROJ 6, etc). After upgrading some libraries
from ubuntugis-unstable, QGIS disappeared from my machine. Other libraries
like qgis-common, etc were still there but qgis itself wasn't. I tried to
reinstall qgis but I always end up with missing/broken package error
(mostly with python-gdal). Looking at the recent update to
ubuntugis-unstable, it seems the python3-gdal lib (with GDAL 3) breaks
python-gdal < 2.5.

Am I correct in thinking that rebuilding QGIS against the
ubuntugis-unstable dependencies would solve this issue?

P.S. It's been a day since I last checked if I could reinstall QGIS with
ubuntugis-unstable dependencies so please disregard this message if it has
been resolved already.

Thanks!

Sincerely,
Ben Hur

Yes, FlatGeoBuf looks nice!

Meanwhile, why not use a well known spatial data file format?

I think rolling serialized QgsFeatures has some gotchas too, like 
writing spatial indexes, getting the file headers right and possibly 
introducing yet another file format.

Because there's nothing which encompasses the full range of field type
and geometry types which the memory data provider supports...

I can be wrong, but using spatial data formats can be lossy in some cases,
e.g. shapefile/dbf has limits for the field name length and field length. Some
other formats may lack support for some datatypes, like datetime etc.

Of course is there is a format which allow fast and lossless storage we should
use it

I think GeoPackage should be fairly stable for this kind of usage.

And leftover files from processes will be easily recoverable with any 
recent software.

Thanks.  GDAL 2 and prøj 5 are now separate packages - prøj 5 being built
statically and shipping with it's own files, although it's actually using the
files from prøj 6 at runtime (as that's where also the grids are) - but those
are identical except for ITRF2005 where +ds=-0.00008 is instead of
+ds=-0.000008 - and I guess that's a fix).

I didn't have time left to test much - spatialite is only there once using prøj
6 and it's used by all GDALs and all QGIS'.

Hi,

the problem with ubuntugis and QGIS being out of sync is a frequent one.
I promised myself a dozen times not to update, but I also stepped into
this trap again.
Had to switch to normal ubuntu release.

See https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html
for the next point release which should solve the issue.
This should have been today, but as far as I understood the threads on
the developers list, this will be postponed for a week or so to solve
other issues.

Cheers,
Bernd

No, it should have been two weeks ago and it was moved to today.

Yes, that would be the last option from the note in the debian/ubuntu section:

"""
The release packages are only produced once shortly after a new version has
been released. As unstable, not yet released debian versions (testing) and
ubuntugis-unstable can have library changes the packages might sooner or later
be broken for these targets, when the development in debian, ubuntu or
ubuntugis-unstable moves on and their packages used as dependencies in qgis
change. In that event you can either

* move to a stable debian version and use the released packages for it,
* wait for the next point release (due 2019-12-06 12:00:00 UTC), which happens
  every month and will include the updated dependencies,
* switch to a nightly repository (available for the two release branches and
  master) whose packages are rebuild on regular basis and will also pickup the
  updated dependencies automatically or
* build your own set of packages (see INSTALL).

Yes, a unfortunate Unicode minus sign that has been corrected to ASCII minus 
sign. Definitely a fix that also applies to PROJ 5. Anyway that only affects 
people playing manually with +init=ITRF2005, which I suspect are only happy 
fews.

Just want to warn in advance that a potential future PROJ 7 that would use 
grids in GeoTIFF format instead of GTX/NTv2 is something likely, and you will 
*not* want PROJ 5 to use such grids... But at that time, QGIS 3.4 will be 
retired hopefully.

Hi,
great news.
Does that mean QGIS 3.4 LTR will continue its life as expected? Or is
3.4.14 the last one?
thanks for your lights, we need to communicate quickly if LTR is frozen
now.
Regards
Régis

Well, yes, may be, but given I've seen some issue (locks/crashes etc
etc) with GeoPackages, and myself having issue with true
DateTime/TimeZones's in it... I thought to propose an alternative :-)

My impression is that the community is experiencing some drawbacks with
GeoPackage/SQLite, but maybe I'm wrong.

Since these files are created as an output and no concurrent access is 
expected, I don't think there's a risk for locking issues here.

For DateTime/TimeZones etc, are we sure we will be in a better situation 
with "our own" serialized format?

> My impression is that the community is experiencing some drawbacks with

Other proposals are very welcome as well. I don't insist on GeoPackage. 
All I do is being a bit skeptic that rolling our own format will 
magically solve problems that one hundred other formats did not solve :-)

The idea is to continue as expected.

From the guy that expected that upgrading to GDAL 3 and prøj 6 was a good thing
for 3.10 and harmless for 3.4 ;)

Hi Raymond,
I think especially getting QtCreator or Visual Studio under Windows OS up
and running would be a good topic if the are windows users as newbies at
your hackfest.

On Linux and Windows I got the debug setup with QtCreator running with the
help of our paid QGIS support but the setup on windows with Visual Studio
which i tried on my own was just a nightmare.

I'm still not sure if there are essential parts missing in the docs at the
moment (adding Version.lib dependency, manually creating qgis.env) which
were necessary for me to be able to debug in Visual studio:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/q/340984/67477


I can imagine that a "debug"-boarding directly from the QGIS devs would be
helpful for many users... So I was wondering if you plan to record the
boarding?

If I wouldn't have needed the debug environment for my work I would have
just given up after some frustrating hours and dismissed the idea of
helping bugfixing QGIS.


regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Good idea to also explain this for Windows. However we will need someone 
to teach that since I don't know how to compile on Windows. Could you do 
it? You seem to have managed setting it up and you could prevent other 
people to having the same frustrations you met.

Recording the workshops is also a great idea. I will try to get the 
equipment for that. The workshops might be too long though, resulting in 
long and boring videos, so maybe creating short(er) instruction videos 
would me more efficient.

Thanks for your input, hoping to see you at the hackfest!
Raymond

Hi,

getting to make good documentation of how to run debug traces on windows
would be awesome, that could be a target of the hackfest.
I'm not sure that building QGIS on Windows is really an onboarding task,
it's more a really advanced one from what I understand.
Regards
Régis

The issue is that the memory provider, by design, MUST be a lossless
reflection of all the capabilities offered in QGIS vector layers. That
means support for every geometry type, and field type handled by QGIS.
Geopackage might be capable of that now... but it won't always be, due
to the inherent limitations of that format. (No multi-geometry
support, no mixed CRS geometry support, no support for advanced field
types like range/interval fields, etc).

I don't think it's useful to even think of rolling our own data format
-- that's NOT what's required here. All that we need is a way of
paging the currently in-memory storage of features used by the memory
provider to disk when required. This disk based paging would be
totally temporary (always deleted when the layer is removed), have no
requirement for a stable binary format (we could change the paging
binary structure version by version if needed), and absolutely no need
for ANY other programs to be able to parse or interpret. It's not a
data format at all -- it's just a disk based reflection of what we
currently store in RAM, along with some smart indexing to optimize
access.

Having our own binary format makes sense from a full QGIS data type 
support perspective.

As mentioned before, I don't insist on GeoPackage (but now that you say 
it, does it not have multi-geometry support? According to the specs it 
should. And just like we can binary dump all our field formats into our 
own binary file, we could dump them into any file, like e.g. GeoPackage).

Implementing indexing and paged loading of requested data resolved by an 
index sound like fun, do you think the effort (or the risks involved) is 
smaller than tacking support for the missing bits to another format?

I am counting the days until someone wants to recover from one of these 
files ;)

Nope: https://www.geopackage.org/guidance/modeling.html

"Allowing multiple geometries per feature table would compromise
GeoPackage's position in the GIS application ecosystem"

(FWIW, that page is ridiculous, arrogant, and completely neglects some
very valid use cases)

Honestly, yes. I suspect it's more work upfront, but less long-term
pain of applying hacks on hacks to try to duct tape functionality into
a standard format.

As soon as anyone tries that, I'm closing the bug report/feature

The geopackage specs say otherwise 
(http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#geometry_types) and so does our very 
own dialog to create geopackage.

If someone wrote modelling guidelines, that was probably meant as best 
practice (on which one can agree or not).

Wasn't it just thought as a band aid until flatgeobuf comes (riding on a 
unicorn) to solve all our issues?

That will be a good move if we follow this path. But I still think 
accessible formats have their merits.

If I may chime in: I think Matthias and Nyall are talking about two
different things: 

Matthias: Multigeometry data types, like MultiPolygon, MultiLinestring,
etc. - that is well supported by Geopackage 

Nyall: mulitple geometry columns - that works in Postgis, Interlis and
some other formats, but not Geopackage. Yes, there are some valid use
cases, where the same object should allow different representations,
e.g. for different scales, or as point and polygon. 

Greetings,
Andreas

Thanks for the clarification Andreas, indeed there was a 
misunderstanding on my end.

That's admittedly a pain point with GPKG, I hope this can be resolved in 
future versions of the spec.

But let's be honest, in QGIS we are not much better yet, integration of 
additional geometry columns is not very polished. We have a "main" 
geometry column to work with and "secondary" geometry columns which can 
be accessed to some degree. A concept which we can tack onto GPKG (or 
any format with no field content limitation --  guess who just dropped 
out of the candidate formats) as well.

We have a "main" geometry column to work with and "secondary" geometry columns which can be accessed to some degree. A concept which we can tack onto GPKG (or any format with no field content limitation --  guess who just dropped out of the candidate formats) as well.

Yes, this is something I think we need to work on. Secondary geometry
fields should be exposed as geometry values, not wkt or wkb or another
encoded format.

I've submitted various PRs over the years to try to implement this,
but none of them have been good enough to merge :P (yet!)

I've been there too. And recently had to add yet another regex in a 
project to parse EWKT :(

Let's make sure QGIS 4 will have native geometry type attributes for pg!

Hi Raymond,
I won't be at the hackfest this time but I could record a screencast before
the HF so users can try to get the development setup running even before
they arrive.

If I would attend an onboarding session for me it would be very interesting
to watch how an experienced QGIS developer would debug a bug.

regards,
Thomas

Does this require QGIS 4? I don't think handling of secondary geometry
values is really part of stable api (especially since every provider
does it different)

Message-ID: <dfd14514-df85-1cce-ec76-2c533a7b318f@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
grass vector commands fail when used with older gdal, both on QGIS 3.4
and on 3.10:

ATTENZIONE: OGR non sa parsare la stringa di parametri in stile PROJ.4:
+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +no_defs
+a=6378388 +rf=297 +type=crs +to_meter=1 (il codice di errore OGR era 5)
ERRORE: Unable to create OGR spatial reference

This will be sorted out over time by the upgrade of libs in all major
operating systems, but meanwhile it would be nice to have it working.
Any hint on where to look?
Cheers.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Expression to check if a layer is in edit mode
Message-ID: <CAMCJChvAXYzXRtsnXQ9FaibcKTjy1Sxmn7Uey7EgUMesPK-61g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was thinking that it would be very useful to have an expression to check
if one layer, or at least, the current layer, is in edit mode.

One use case I'm seeing is: imagine that you have a form tab or group
container, and you want to hide that tab or container just when the layer
is in editing mode. If this option was available, simply using the control
visibility by expression with something like (with a behaviour similar to
is_selected([feature=current feature][,layer=current layer])) :

NOT( is_edition_active([layer=current layer]) )

could hide the tab/container in edit mode, and show in "identify" mode.

Could this expression be useful? If you think so, I will fill a feature
request.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro

Hi, 

I agree, it would be a useful. Not only for forms, but also for
symbology and labeling. One could switch symbology from something
complex to simple during edition and then back to the complicated
symbology. Or hide/change labels. 

We already have the "layer_property" expression. It could either be
extended with edit_state, or it could be a separate expression. 

Good idea!

Hi all,

Same thing in GRASS works fine.
In the setting I do not find a possibility to add a path for GDAL help

Anyone confirms?

Got it: it should point to our docs website, but when the connection is
unavailable it returns the error. The point is that qgis seems to verify
the connection at startup, so even if the connection becomes available
the error persists.
Cheers.

Hi,

As I already talked about elsewhere I'm implementing a "minimal OGC-API Features
Server".

Now I'd like to test this service with QGIS as client. And I also
tested QGIS with the "kataster" service [1] the mentioned in the docs
[2].
Unfortunately I count not get both services to work (display) in QGIS.

* Our own service is being asked by QGIS with bbox and "limit=10&" any
time a zoom or pan occurs. But QGIS displays just 10 which are not
replaced by others whatever I do with QGIS.
* The kataster service asks about the CRS, then reports a large number
of features (which means there must be a different "limit="), and
finally does not answer requests from QGIS anymore.

Question 1: Any idea what QGIS makes it's OGC-API-Features reader to
add limit=10?

Question 2: Does anybody know about any another OGC-API Features
service we could use to test?

Perhaps your service doesn't really return true unique ids ?

Works for me.

Because that's the page size it detects from your service, or more presumably 
the default value if your service doesn't implement /api properly. You can 
tune it in the "WFS option" group of the "Modify WFS connection" dialog

Not yet... but consider that GUI works in the main thread => if you need to
post messages in the console you should need to create producer/consumer
queues (see use of Queue module).
I would suggest to simplify everything using QgsTask.

Hi,

the error is

/Users/admin/qgis/builds/nightly/qgis/src/core/geometry/qgsgeos.h:24:10:
fatal error: 'geos_c.h' file not found
#include <geos_c.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~

I will look into it now and see what is happening


P.

Hi,

please see PR https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33334 . I cannot replicate
build issue problem locally, but hopefully this one fixes the problem.

Yes I run the ""QGIS with GRASS" and get this error when trying to run Grass
from within Processing Toolbox: 

*This algorithm cannot be run :-( 
The specified GRASS 7 folder "C:\OSGEO4~1\bin\bin" does not contain a valid
set of GRASS 7 modules. Please, go to the Processing settings dialog, and
check that the GRASS 7 folder is correctly configured*

I do not have a folder called "C:\OSGEO4~1\bin\bin". I have a folder called
"C:\OSGEO4~1\bin" which includes a grass76.bat file

In setting this path is included for the docs and it is existing:
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\grass\grass76\docs\html

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Relation reference misbehaviour?
Message-ID: <619ec784-5dab-2d25-16b7-4bb4adbbbfdb@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
following the example from
https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html#introducing-many-to-many-n-m-relations
I noticed that it does not work, at least with 3.10.
The default Relation Reference, automatically selected, displays the
value column, and tries to insert the same (which obviously fails, being
a string) instead of the key, which would work.
Changing the widget type, by hand, with a Value relation, makes it work.
Is this a known issue?
All the best.

Dear Even (dear Richard, dear all)

Many thanks for your replies. Thanks to your instant feedback we got
our minimal server implementation to work (also with QGIS).

Our issue was with the "/collections/castles/items" endpoint, where we
missed to include a link to the next page so that the (QGIS) reader
client can iterate through all the features pageuntil they’re all
read.

Finally, did I understood you correctly regarding the QGIS client options:

I've added the WFS3 (alias OGC API-F) service using QGIS menu item
"Add Vector Layer..." in menu "Layer".
So you are referring to entry field "Request step size" in the "Data
Soure Manager WMS/WMTS dialog?

No, this way you'll use the OGR WFS3/OAPIF driver

I mean the "Add WFS Layer" entry (which should be renamed by the way to "Add 
WFS / OGC API - Features Layer") which will make you go to the "WFS / OGC API 
- Features" tab of Data Source Manager. There you will use the native QGIS 
provider (if using QGIS master)

Hi Folks

I posted a new feed item today advertising the 24th QGIS Hackfest, but it does not show up for me in either 3.10 or 3.11. Can anyone else see it? Or is anyone aware of why it doesn’t show? See the second item in :

Hi All

I got a strange security popup on my Mac today saying QGIS 3.10 would like permission to record my screen:


I know that these messages can often be related to non-obvious functionality such as colour pickers etc. but it is a bit alarming. Has anyone else encountered this / does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?

The color picker is the only thing I'm aware of in QGIS which is
grabbing the screen contents.

I'm not sure why this message won't only suddenly be appearing now
though. I suspect its' either:
1. A macos update has changed something
2. A qt update means that the qt method we use to grab a portion of
the screen to sample colors has changed behavior on macos

The message is rather misleading though -- if it said "capture part of
the screen" rather then "record" I'd be happier. FWIW, I think we'll
need to eventually change the API used to do the color picking on
linux sessions running with wayland, which will result in a similar
warning message. Not sure about Windows, but I suspect at some stage
the security risk of allowing any application to grab whole desktop
screenshots will eventually result in similar warnings being shown....

There is also QgsAppScreenShot
It was added to make screenshot for the documentation, but the projet did
not go further since it appears not to be the best way.
The class was left though. If it's the one bringing this message, I'd
suggest dropping it.

Hm, it's not being returned in the feed when the "after" parameter is added:

If I start QGIS with Grass by double clicking
"C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-bin-g7.exe" the Grass path is wrong.

If I start by double clicking on "C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\qgis-grass7.bat" the
Grass paths are OK.

On a colleagues PC he cannot start QGIS at all from the .exe but it works
well using the .bat.

Looks like the .exe files coming with the OSGeo4w version are faulty?

Hi,

I am ubuntu 18.04 and everything was working fine but QGIS then just
disappeared on me. I tried to reinstall using the following tutorial:
https://www.gis-blog.com/how-to-install-qgis-3-on-ubuntu/
and updated the key to 2019.

Everything seemed to install correctly but QGIS is still not installed? I'm
completely lost as to where to go from here?

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks

Message-ID: <37908aa3-22b4-5086-f803-5732b7267c85@opengis.ch>

Hi,

I wanted to test qgis server nightly build on a windows machine. The 
3.10 version runs fine on the same machine, but as soon as in the apache 
conf all occurrences of "app\qgis" are replaced with "app\qgis-dev" in 
all paths, qgis server dies upon each request (apparently before being 
able to log anything).

- Did someone else manage to run this version and should I therefore 
assume a local problem?

Interestingly, it seems qgis server is shipped in the qgis-dev package 
whereas there are separate qgis-server and qgis-ltr-server packages for 
3.4 and 3.10. Is this a difference of nightly builds compared to regular 
builds or a recent restructuring of the packages?

Thanks for any hints

Hi Matthias,

Is this only Windows related or do you have the same issue on Linux ?

yes.  the release are built with ms-windows\osgeo4w\package.cmd and the
nightlies with ms-windows\osgeo4w\package-nighty.cmd.   package.cmd produces
several packages, package-nightly.cmd just one.

Hi David,

Since there are server tests in place, running on linux (travis) I 
assume that this is a platform specific or local issue.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to retrieve enum-input value in processing
Message-ID: <2d75c43a-7154-2e2f-3eb3-f4c1df082ed6@duif.net>

Just received a question from a user:

He has a small processing model and wants to use an 'enum' (text) input
in the model as value for a new column. Which in the column  is created
by the 'field calculator' algorithm.

But we cannot find out how to get the 'chosen' value out of the
'enum'-input (which are always 'strings'). Whatever we try the value of
the new column records are always NULL

To reproduce:
- create an fresh model with an input vector layer
- create in 'enum' input call it 'choice' with 2 values 'blue', 'red'
- use the 'field calculator' algorithm to create a new string field
we thought that '@choice' would be the Formula (being the value of the
'choice' input...

BUT: the column is never filled with 'red' or 'blue'...

Anybody a clue?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <003a76f0-8b60-cf48-8093-67b0f0c9879b@duif.net>

When I build QGIS with Qt-Creator to debug something, QGIS always starts
with the error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'processing'

Which is fine most of the time, as the rest runs fine, and because I did
not have to debug some processing thingies recently.

But now I want to debug a processing thing... so... anybody a pointer
why processing isn't picked up?
Should I put a custom python path?
I already did a fresh configure and cleaned up everything.

TIA,
Richard Duivenvoorde

On which QGIS version are you?

I made this ticket a few weeks ago. You will see that the enum will give
its index and not the string as you can think.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/32452

Nyall did some PR in 3.11.

You need to use a CASE WHEN in your expression. You can open Nyall's model
to check.

Hi Etienne,

Ah yes, thanks I see. Your issue is exactly I'm asking for...

I'm on master, and I tested the expression_enum2.txt from the PR of
Nyall. It "works".
But the fact that you you have to do a CASE WHEN in an expression
becomes harder when you have a dropdown with a lot of (changing in time)
options. You will have to keep your CASE WHEN in sync with those values

I think using a dropdown/enum in a model is an usefull input.

Should I create a Feature Request from the Issue? Or add it to this issue?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QScintilla headers not found before compiling
Message-ID: <c925f9bc-3ef7-26a2-09ea-64d7d351b565@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was trying to build the current QGIS master from source on Ubuntu 
18.04 following the Github Pages docu: 
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/INSTALL.html#toc3. 
Mostly to try remote plugin debugging in PyCharm.

While scanning the build parameters, ccmake couldn't find 
QSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR even though the libqscintilla2-qt5-dev library is 
installed (from bionic universe repo). I couldn't locate a 
"qsciglobal.h" on my file system either which the cmake recipe 
apparently is looking for and nothing in my usual include directories. 
Also I couldn't figure out how fix it manually (like copying include 
headers from the universe repo source of QScintilla; naive?!). But I'm 
not really too familiar with c++ dependency management.. Still working 
on that:)

Did anyone get bugged by this before? Or has a clue how to fix it?

Many thanks
Nils

Hi Nils,

It is not difficult to find out where qsciglobal.h is. Try:
dpkg -L libqscintilla2-qt5-dev | grep qsciglobal.h

On my Ubuntu it is installed in:
/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/Qsci/qsciglobal.h

If you need it, just add:
-DQSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5

Hope it works.

Regards,

Jorge Gustavo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Improve build times with ccache
Message-ID: <1576483038873-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I just joined Kartoza and I am going to be doing a bunch of work on the
QGIS core. Can someone share a good practice to avoid lengthy recompilation
times when I switch branches. I'm using ccache in compiling.

Hi,

Ccache is certainly a good idea.

The other one is to actually keep several source and build folders in 
parallel (e.g. release-3_4, release-3_10, master). I would recommend 
getting familiar with "git worktree" which is an amazing utility to use 
several sources in parallel, based on the same git configuration.

I quite often develop small fixes on a master tree with mixed patches on 
top and then compile this mixed branch and do:

git commit

git worktree add ../my_new_functionality

cd ../my_new_functionality

git rebase -i qgis/master

# only keep the commits to be pushed

git push -u my_own_repo my_new_functionality


For small fixes here and there this is super fast to work with

Hope this helps

Matthias

Hi again,

Just remembered another nifty trick. Only compile the target 
qgis_desktop (ninja qgis_desktop) when working on desktop related code. 
That will also skip compiling server and linking tests. Therefore: if 
you want to run cpp tests locally, you have to also to remember to build 
them individually.

And by the way welcome on board :)

Hi Matthias, Thanks a lot. Compiling only the required target (eg.
qgis_desktop) really works well!!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProcessingParameterColor available in 3.10
 pyqgis docs not in master breaks user manual
Message-ID: <CAECJsSoe-d0gMrxndJtzN8r1bXMRi6194YVTz4j_Li+YDZ9xiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Looking for QgsProcessingParameterColor in the PyQGIS API doc, I have
results for 3.10 [0] but nothing when it comes to master[1].
Any reason for that?
Consequently, this class unavailability breaks QGIS documentation. Indeed,
we rely on API docs (PyQGIS as well as C++) to generate automatic links
between the user manual or the Cookbook and the classes documentation. And
if a link is missing, bah... it just breaks the doc build [2].

Any explanation or help on this matter would be appreciated, in order to
fix our builds.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi,

QgsProcessingOutputBoolean has also disappeared from the master API

There is something mixed up between cosmic and disco images when building
the API docs.
Let me check.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPB7-DzoBvjVsWv7sk_Vxw6t7+kqnu=VO2UY6_2+CJrPjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

looks like there is no way to set interpolation method for QgsRasterFileWriter.
In some cases this cause bad results when saving raster with another resolution
while using GDAL directly with more advanced interpolation algorithm gives much
better image.

Is this intentional or maybe I just missing something and there is a
way to set for
example cubic interpolation?

Found QgsRasterResampleFilter and couple of raster resampler classes.
Unfortunately can't make it work, any attempt to add QgsRasterResampleFilter
to the pipe fails.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] backporting bot
Message-ID: <CAMtsY+Y+wj0Y8qByvZq24eNSp3FTFfArf1Up3qoUH==NPk=zpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

Thanks to the work from Gaurav Munjal who has setup another version of the
backporting bot [0], our backporting bot is back :) [1]

It's now a github action. To make it work, the API token has to in clear
access so it can work across forks. So, I created a new user (qgis-bot)
dedicated to this and forked qgis/qgis to qgis-bot/qgis. The PRs will be
issued from this work.

Labels should now be created as "backport [branch]".

As an example, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/33444

Cheers,
Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Codes in Cookbook and User manual : state of art
Message-ID: <CAECJsSqoOXZJgVuzYudTnvfQtqSRxym6T8ix38nBaVsGd6Kvvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

During the last meeting for docs, there were some people asking whether and
to which extent our documentation was linked to our API docs. While some
answers have been given I'd hereby like to expand a bit on the subject.

As you probably know, we rely on Sphinx to build our docs. And we also use
two extensions of Sphinx to link to our code documentation (actually
PyQGIS):

1. intersphinx [0] added by Alexandre Neto: connects user manual and
cookbook with the pyQGIS documentation. Whenever we mention a class, it's
possible to enable a URL that points to the class/function doc in pyQGIS
website, in the corresponding release (ie for LTRs and master). Convenient
for users, imho.
Code is available at [1] and some examples at [2]. We have covered >90%
(not scientific, but probably true!) of what needed to be and this works
pretty well, as long as the pyQGIS doc builds successfully and
classes/functions are still in the target QGIS version.

2. The other extension is doctest [3] added by Arnaud Morvan at La Coruna
if I'm right: runs the target code snippets on QGIS and reports any error.
This is mainly intended to get the cookbook examples fixed faster than
manual trial, and less fragile. Basically, you add ".. testcode" at the
beginning of a snippet and ".. testoutput" with expected output at the end
and this code is tested at each build like if you were running it in QGIS.
Instructions are at [4].
While looking around for information to write this message, I realise that
Victor Olaya also made a precious initial work of updates of the codes from
2 to 3 [5] automatically. But not on all the files as far as I could see.
Maybe could we reuse his code?
Today, we are far from the coverage we should have been imho, meaning that
there still are a lot of codes that are outdated or can become outdated
without noticing, because:
- we need people to pick each
- there isn't a way (or we don't know how) to test iface in the codes,
resulting in many interface-related codes untestable.

Hope that clarifies, and may those who were parts of this feel free to
correct if I miss anything.

Regards,
Harrissou

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding Service and Layer Metadata for WFS
Message-ID: <1576652303628-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, I want to add service and layer metadata for the WFS layers in QGIS. I
have come to realize that the base class used for WFS is
QgsVectorDataProvider which doesn't have  an equivalent function of
htmlMetadata as in QgsRasterDataProvider which is used for other services
eg. WMS, WCS. 

Is there any function that will be of help from the QgsVectorDataProvider or
I will need to implement one from scratch?

Thank you.

Samweli

Thank you Harrissou,

this is very valuable information, I think you should copy/paste it to some
README in the docs repo (if not yet there).

I'd really like to make a deep revision and update of the cookbook and put
code snippets under automated testing, I'll ask the PSC if there are any
funds left for such activity.

Cheers

Hi all,
if anyone knows of a policy document not listed in the ticket, please
let me know. The current situation (one developer, one documentation,
and one plugin document) looks OK to me.
Thanks for help.

Hi,

I was wondering just a day before how we could have lived without this...
Thanks Denis and Gaurav.

Denis, if I want to reenable it for docs repo, I simply need to copy/paste
the action in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/89e3f2ccf98f3563a4e3d3dbd02ed1537c93afce
to our repo and update the label or do I need anything else?

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi,
Good news Alessandro. Would be nice if that makes it. Thanks.
Most of the information (other than the historic part, of course) are
already in the readme and/or in the writing guidelines as far as I
remember. Will double check when I find time.

Regards,
Harrissou

Thanks Matthias for these tips.

Samweli, do you think you can add some notes in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/linux.t2t (which will land in
the INSTALL file) so we won't loose these notes in the mailing list?

PS : Welcome in the Kartoza team ;-)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] What to do about GDAL and PROJ for 3.10.2?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj=q5Spn731mZ7O1Eniy3x88bJ=M6tJJ5inPAf+TLce3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Just want to raise this discussion prior to the 3.10.2 patch release.
The situation as I see it is that there is absolutely critical fixes
in GDAL and PROJ master branches which are not available in any of the
GDAL/PROJ stable releases, all relating to CRS and transformation
handling.

Many of these fixes have been implemented as a direct result of bug
reports filed against QGIS when running under the Proj6/GDAL3
combination.

I personally do not feel comfortable with anyone running QGIS on
GDAL3/Proj6 without these fixes (in fact, I think that we should block
QGIS builds on GDAL/PROJ builds less than master, and greater than
PROJ 5/ GDAL 2 via cmake checks). So we're left in a difficult
position, because the next round of GDAL/PROJ releases aren't
happening anytime soon.

Thoughts welcome on how we should proceed here....

Having helped out chasing down some of these CRS and transformation issues
under GDAL3/PROJ6, I too feel *very* uncomfortable shipping the next QGIS
point release with anything lesser than GDAL3 and PROJ6 master as of
yesterday.

To be clear, QGIS had plenty to fix itself, and that’s been taken care of
(thanks to QGIS’s PSC for financing Nyall here). But those fixes are half
of the story, and if we are to ship a QGIS version built against
GDAL3/PROJ6 that can be trusted to project and transform data properly, we
can’t do so unless we ship with the latest revisions of those libraries.

On the short term, since the next point release is in 24-ish hours, I’d
suggest to update the osgeo4w gdal and proj non-dev libraries to the latest
master revisions (with versions like proj6 version 6.3pre or something) and
have QGIS 3.10.2 built against those. Jürgen, since you’d carry that
library update burden, how do you feel about this solution?

Following that, we should discuss with GDAL and PROJ to see if they can
package an official release prior to QGIS’ next point release (which is to
take place on January 17, 2019 according to our schedule). Once that’s
done, we should consider raising QGIS’ minimum version requirement for
those libraries.

Hi Nyall,
thanks for clarifying this. Wouldn't it be reasonable to ask gdal+proj
teams to release a new fixed version ASAP? Even if we fix this in the
Windows installer, where we (Juergen) have full control, we'll still
have issues on other OSs where we cannot control dependencies.
Cheers.

We can, but I don't honestly see that happening before Christmas (it
is the holiday season after all!)

In this case I don't see a major problem in postponing a point release,
or even skipping it until the next one - am I wrong?

QGIS builds on GDAL/PROJ builds less than master, and greater than
PROJ 5/ GDAL 2 via cmake checks). So we're left in a difficult
position, because the next round of GDAL/PROJ releases aren't
happening anytime soon.

Thoughts welcome on how we should proceed here....

Hi, 

I also think we should postpone or skip the release in the current
situation. 

But it would be good, if we would communicate it to our users with the
various channels we have (release road map, blog post, news feed). 

Greetings, 

Andreas

 In this case I don't see a major problem in postponing a point release,
or even skipping it until the next one - am I wrong?
Cheers.

We have practice with that.  And the last point release was just was
two weeks ago - so this one would be "early" anyway.  And it's holiday season
for some (for others it just false advertizing ;)).

The next point release is on Jan 17th, so after the next PROJ release.  Not
sure about next GDAL release date.

So I'd be fine with just skipping this one.  I updated the schedule
accordingly.

I was floating the idea of having a GDAL 3.0.3 release somewhere in January, 
but that's dependent on a volunteer taking on that. Someone was willing to 
give his first try at releasing GDAL, but I'm not sure if he's still 
available, and if that can be done before Jan 17th. I'll check back.

OK so the volunteer is still on. We'll try to begin the release procedure 
earlier than usual, so he has time to warm up to the exercise. Hopefully we 
should have a 3.0.3 release officially approved for Jan 17th (but no guarantee 
as stated in the license text :-))

In the meantime would be good if people could confirm that
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/release/3.0  is in good shape for QGIS 
needs (I believe I've backported all the needed fixes, but wouln't hurt to get 
some confirmation)

I've built QGIS using it, and the unit tests are passing and my
various reference datasets are working well on the 3.0 branch

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] saving username in QGIS projectfile for tracking
	changes
Message-ID: <CAD3koGkDyWk+nbHJJuFuXqst_5+4t_N0JSSji0wAYg9V2rxz7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS-Devs,

I set up a cronjob to track changes in one QGIS projectfile which is used
as template for a bunch of users.

Apart from knowing which parts of the project file changed it would be nice
to know who saved these changes.

So i inserted the following snippet in the "writeProjectFile"- function of
my qgsproject.cpp:

  QDomElement userNode = doc->createElement(QStringLiteral("lastUser"));
  QDomText lastUser = doc->createTextNode(QgsApplication::userFullName());
  userNode.appendChild(lastUser);
  qgisNode.appendChild(userNode);

which works so I get one XML tag with the username who saved the project
file:

...
    </spatialrefsys>
  </projectCrs>
  <lastUser>Baumann Thomas</lastUser>
  <layer-tree-group>
...

This was as first try. Perhaps it would make more sense to put this
information somewhere into the metadata node.

What do you think about the idea of adding this functionality into QGIS?

regards,
Thomas

Message-ID: <b3384700-47b2-019c-1a33-d52db19ffef0@opengis.ch>

Hello,

I noticed that there have been no qgis nightly builds for since Dec 15.

Looking onto the dash, something has been running, but with the version 
2.11.0 (notice the major version).

https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/buildSummary.php?buildid=24460

Does anyone have a guess what could be going on?

Thank you

Ouch, apparently since the last windows update a successful osgeo4w update -
which happened - doesn't trigger the build anymore.  Manually triggered…

That an attempt by someone else.

Hi Jürgen,

Thanks a lot for your efforts on Windows tests! It's great to see things 
built on Windows even before they are integrated into master.

I really hope this will safe us some trouble down the road, once things 
stabilize.

Right now we seem to have two builds running always, one on azure qgis 
and one on azure jef, where the second one currently times out after 
many hours in the queue. Is there a reason for keeping them both or is 
the jef-build just a leftover from initial efforts?

Best wishes

Not sure if that overlapped - I noticed a ticket mentioning this earlier and
removed my paused pipeline.  I paused the my second pipeline a while ago and
expected that to also stop queuing new jobs, while it apparently just stops
building them.

Removing the builds also cancelled all the queued jobs.

It's looking good.

New jobs now only start a single check again.

Hi,

As I understand QCOMPARE is very strict to data types and output from
GDALGetProjectionRef( ds1.get() ) needs to be converted to QString
before
check.

I'm on Ubuntu 18.04, GCC 7.4.0, Qt 5.9.5.

Anyone confirms?

Yes I got that yesterday and fixed it by changing 3 lines in that test to
compare std::str with std::str instead of std::str with QString.

It's only with proj 6 - I might submit a pr unless someone else does before
me.

I have been using QGIS 3.x for a good solid year, and have come to conclude
that the New CLICK + CLICK method is not intuitive, and I have been finding
it buggy (at least on Mac).
I have been hoping that performance, accuracy and efficiency would improve
with the Vertex Tool in 3.x but it has not (at least on Mac)
I have used many CAD software over the years (AutoCAD, FreeCad,
Vectorworks, Inventor, Sketchup/Layout), and am not familiar with this
unconventional Click+Click method for moving nodes/features.  Perhaps this
is a Windows UI thing?

Besides the issue with having to re-wire the brain to the Click+Click
method of the Vertex Tool, the moving of a node is buggy.
33% of the time Left Click is either not registered or is registering as a
selection box.

I have read the arguments FOR Click+Click, perhaps if it actually worked I
would be okay with it.

It appears there are two Vertex Tools states being used contextually.  The
Vertex Selection Tool state and the Vertex Move Tool state.  It seems in my
case the Vertex Tool defaults to a selection state much too often no matter
how close to the bullseye I click.

Message-ID: <000301d5bfcf$420e0c10$c62a2430$@santannapisa.it>

Hi! I am porting a QGIS plugin to QGIS3.

I get a problem when I try to create a new SpatiaLite DB, in particular when
I initialize spatial metadata (GEOMETRY_COLUMNS and SPATIAL_REF_SYS).

My code is:

import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect(dbname)
con.enable_load_extension(True)
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON")
cur.execute("SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);")

Here I get the error "no such function: InitSpatialMetadata"

My sqlite3 version is 3.29.0

Any idea about that?

Thank you for your support!

Giovanna

Hi Giovanna,
probably you need to load SpatiaLite as an extension module
https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=mod_spatialite before
the "SELECT InitSpatialMetaData(1);" statement:

con.execute("SELECT load_extension('mod_spatialite')")

Best regards.

Andrea
