Hi Nathan

It looks like the CMake module to find HDF library is picking hdf5.dll
instead of hdf5.lib import library for some reason. Maybe as a
workaround you can manually set the HDF5_C_LIBRARIES variable to the
correct .lib file. We are using the standard CMake module to find HDF,
so if this issue persists, we may need to replace that cmake module
with our own version for windows. Or maybe Jurgen has some trick how
to make it work on Windows :-)

Cheers
Martin

No, sorry.  And it doesn't ring a bell.

Is that 32 or 64 bit?   Did you perhaps install 64bit to C:\OSGeo4W?
Looks like c:/OSGeo4W64/share/cmake/hdf5/hdf5-targets-release.cmake has
OSGeo4W64 in it.

Hey,

This is on 32bit but really I should setup a 64bit build and that might fix
the issue, plus I really should do that anyway.

For now I will just override the path in cmake like Martin said just so I
can finish this task off while I setup my 64bit build.

adding to the confusion:

I used the geographiclib API as included in PROJ 5.2.0 following the
example for geod_polygonarea() in geodesic.h and get
geographiclib: 14,737.935 km^2
quite different from
Planimeter: 14,722.522 km^2

GRASS native gives 14,718.097679
as also reported by Helmut and Stefan

Ok, with https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8090 QGIS now exactly
matches GRASS' value (14.718 km2).

(For reference -- not a regression, this bug has been around since
ellipsoidal calculations were introduced to QGIS!)

Hi all,

thanks a lot for this. It's a beautiful example of how open source
works, finding and solving problems through collaboration and highly
skilled people. It would be nice if someone would write about this for a
wider audience.

All the best.

Nyall,

Thanks so much for investigating and fixing this. Also thank you all who
have contributed to this discussion. This was an important bug to find and
fix. I think we will find that the geographiclib calculations are going to
be slightly more accurate coming in at 14.737 km^2, but the GRASS
calculations are quite accurate.

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Geodesic Move, Rotate,
	and Interactive Shape Digitizing
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpDLY6Tk8EsoKzkuZmT7zz7wpj=XSFfed0tsPHEYsoDTg@mail.gmail.com>

My next project with Shape Tools is to add a geodesic move and rotate tools
as well as interactive geodesic shape creation of the existing Shape Tools
shapes.

Normally I would start with QgsMapTool class and work from there, but QGIS
3 seems to have implemented a nice node and outline with the Shape
Digitizing Tools. Can I hook into that work? For shape creating what I
would like to do is to click and release on the map and as the cursor moves
calculate the geodesc shapes based on the geodesic distance from the
clicked point and the current cursor point. Once I click again then the
shape is created. For some of the shapes I would need a popup window to
adjust one or two parameters. During the highlight mode, after each motion
even, I would need to update all the node positions based on the current
geodesic distances and bearings.

The reason for geodesic move and rotate tools is because the current one
works with the local layer units and if that happens to be degrees strange
results happen. With the new geodesic move and rotate tools I would like to
be able to select the shape like the current tools do, calculate the
centroid and then move and rotate each vertex according to geodesic
distances.

I could do all this just with working with the QgsMapTool class, but I
would prefer trying to hook into the existing shape drawing API as it would
provide the same look and feel. It looks like there are the following
classes: QgsMapToolCapture, QgsMapToolAdvancedDigitizing, QgsMapToolEdit.
Which should I use? I need full control of each node after each cursor move.

Thanks,

Calvin

Just noticed that the native QGIS Network Analysis tools in Processing seem
to still lack documentation:

Message-ID: <04528abf-7ee0-3099-36a3-f3b37c286eb2@duif.net>

After some time (Debian removed some Qt 3D related package, which should
be restored now)

There is notion of this (and Juergen :-) ) in:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=895386
and
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=895507


But now I try to rebuild QGIS with 3D again.

For what I know I installed all 3D related Qt packages, but I still get:

 CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:336 (FIND_PACKAGE):
   By not providing "FindQt53DExtras.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
project
   has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
   "Qt53DExtras", but CMake did not find one.

   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt53DExtras"
with
   any of the following names:

     Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake
     qt53dextras-config.cmake

   Add the installation prefix of "Qt53DExtras" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
   "Qt53DExtras_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
   "Qt53DExtras" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
   has been installed.

Looking into
https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/qt3d5-dev/filelist
 Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake
should be installed, but I cannot find it on my disk.

I do find Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake in the repo:

qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras/Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake

But setting Qt53DExtras_DIR to there, I get:

 CMake Error at
external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras/Qt53DExtrasConfig.cmake:3
(set_target_properties):
   set_target_properties called with incorrect number of arguments.
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   CMakeLists.txt:336 (FIND_PACKAGE)

Anybody a clue?
Or able to build 3D on Debian Testing?

Regards & thanks for any hint,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I can't recall details except the fact I've finally made it working by running 
cmake with these parameters:

cmake .. 
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/blahblahblah/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake 
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR=/blahblahblah/qgis/external/qt3dextra-headers 
-DQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so

Of course you only need it to run it once. Note you need the libQt53DExtras.so 
installed, only headers go from QGIS.

Regards,
Borys

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3.3 save style /copy style btw different
	geometry
Message-ID: <38497AD9CA059C42AA3451EFEFF0378E0179C31A1A@P2KITMBX04WC02.unicph.domain>

Hi,
In 3.3 there are possibilities to copy / paste a specific category eg. Forms from one layer to another. Great !
But: It is not possible if there are a different geometry.

Workarround:
Style Save Style
Open the XML
Delete         geom = feature.geometry() and <layerGeometryType>0</layerGeometryType>

Then Load style

Now my Forms are easily imported.

Is it possible to remove the ‘geom’ part from the copy statement on issues not regarding ‘geom’ so I can use a simple copy/paste ?

Regards

I would use Python to do this operation, I was stuck when I wanted to go
from lines to points and got help here:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/268877/copying-categorized-colors-from-line-object-to-point-object-using-qgis

Best regards

Hi,
In 3.3 there are possibilities to copy / paste a specific category eg. Forms from one layer to another. Great !
But: It is not possible if there are a different geometry.

Workarround:
Style Save Style
Open the XML
Delete         geom = feature.geometry() and <layerGeometryType>0</layerGeometryType>

Then Load style

Now my Forms are easily imported.

Is it possible to remove the ‘geom’ part from the copy statement on issues not regarding ‘geom’ so I can use a simple copy/paste ?

Hi,
we need the same, to be precise, we need two things, to allow editing
of data stored in Django/PostGIS in QGIS over the network and let QGIS
Server (WMS) to read data from Django, both using Django filters etc.
If we manage to get data to QGIS from Django (and back), we can use
QGIS Server and WFS-T for editing. So I am looking for something like
Django provider for QGIS or WFS-T application for Django. Are you
aware of something like that?

Olivier, what have you used in the end? [1] is not maintained and it
does not support WFS-T.

Alessandro, in [2] I am missing data reading from Django models. It
seems like the server is launched from python, but data flow goes
through standard QGIS providers?

Marco, if I got it looking briefly into GeoNode code, they just run
QGIS server, but they don't read data directly from Django models,
right?

Unfortunately (as of today),  no. Iterating mode is a bit like the
batch mode, in that it's all handled outside of an individual
algorithm.

Potentially we could add some parameter metadata to indicate that the
parameter should default to having iterating on, but this would only
work if the algorithm is executed from the toolbox (i.e. not from
modeler, batch, etc).

Hi Radim,

I didn't get this sorted in the end (ended just having the layer as read
only in QGIS from postgis and users would do any modification from django
admin).

About a Django provider for QGIS : it is now possible to create python
providers [1]. So creating a REST provider to consume a django rest
framework endpoint may not be that hard anymore ? That would certainly be a
great addition to QGIS !!

And about a WFS-T app for Django : I don't know of any other effort than
django-wfs, but I just saw there's an open PR with some a lot of changed
including python 3 support, so maybe django-wfs is not as dead as it looks
? Still WFS-T would have to be added, and again not sure how hard this
would be...

Let us know how it goes !

Cheers,

Olivier

thanks for the explanation, I thought I was missing some flag :)

Hi all,

I've tested this issue

https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19517

in master (QGIS code revision 234985b59d) and it is still present.

Can anyone take a look at it?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Pedro Venâncio

Hi All,

at GIS3W we developed a suite based on Django for QGIS server [1], the 
code in Open and on Github [2] (main app is G3W-ADMIN).

The suite parse QGIS project file(at the moment is only for QGIS 2.18) 
and stores layer data in to db, alse connection string informations. 
With the layer connection we build a Django model on fly for to get data 
directly from db ora to write on it.

We developed a 'editing' module but for now is not open, but the core 
for build Django model on fly is in the open code [3].

The suite comunicates with Webgis Client (G3W-CLIENT) with custom api 
built with Django Rest Framework.

I hope this can be usefull.

I'm thinking again on django model on fly worflow and his memory 
implication, comments and suggestions are welcome.

Have a good weekend.

Ciao

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] provide an exe with a plugin
Message-ID: <d55bcf99-0a5a-a7e0-cdf2-e73ba7a10ec7@cerema.fr>

Hello,


I've developped a Qgis plugin called "networks" as an algorithm provider 
(github page https://github.com/crocovert/networks) which provide 
several algorithm for network management and the generation input files 
for a multimodal routing tool call Musliw I've previously developped

This tool Musliw (open source) was developped in C# with monodevelop.It 
runs on windows adn linux (with mono runtime). The source code is 
located in my github page (https://github.com/crocovert/muslic)


Is it acceptable to provide this binary file (muslic.exe) with the 
plugin and should I only provide python algorithms scripts


Thank you for your answers

I would say yes because all your code is free, but, in this moment, we
don't have (in plugin manager) a way to verify md5 or sha check sum to
verify that the executable you attach is exactly the original one.
I would suggest to refactor your code to do post download of executables.
Remember there are also processing toolbox components to allow download
files. I Would do a post setup of the plugin asking the user the permission
to download further executables.

so, resuming, IMHO the answer, is NO it's not possible :( but I would be
open to any qgis improvement that could facilitate this cases.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Display of drag and drop forms totally broken
Message-ID: <3cfa5f9d9a2746e04883627a249f244f@carto.net>

Dear devs, 

I have a severe issue with drag and drop attribute forms. Did someone do
any substantial changes in attribute forms recently? 

I was quite shocked when I opened a 3.2 project in QGIS master and the
display of complex forms is totally broken. See issue
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20045 - please have a look at the two
screenshots from 3.2 and 3.3. 

I can provide the QGIS project, but it requires to import a postgis dump
and it contains quite some custom Python code. The OPENGIS people
already have my project - so maybe someone from them could have a look
at how to fix the issue as part of our bug fixing program? Or is some
other dev aware about any recent changes that might have triggered my
issues? 

This is urgent and I hope it can be fixed in master - otherwise many of
our projects using drag and drop forms can be opened in the upcoming LT
version ;-( 

Thank you for having a look at my issue! 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Attrribute forms: widget frames are missing.
Message-ID: <bdd9ef251f371e92ba49124df149d6ea@carto.net>

Hi, 

I noticed that in the attribute forms in master, the frames of the
widgets are missing, except for relation reference widgets. 

See screenshot in this mail - the widgets around the "1" (Anzahl
Sonden), "112" (Bohrtiefe [m]", etc. should have frames. 

This is on Windows 7. 

Any idea what might be wrong here? Maybe a side-effect of the recent
change where the gray parts of "read only" layers were replaced with
black? 

Note also, that the "NULL" in the text editor widget still appears as
gray instead of black. 

Thanks for having a look at this as well! 

Andreas

Hi,
so you don't read/write features from QGIS, only from Web client, right?

Hi, thanks for information.

I tried QGIS <-> WFS-T <-> QGIS Server <-> PostGIS and initial read is
4-5 times slower than QGIS <-> PostGIS (QGIS 2.14). Any idea why it is
so slow and if it can be improved?

Hi Radim,
I have no idea why it is slower, but we should really improve the QGIS
server WFS-T situation I think. Adding  scenario to the QGIS performance
tests would be a good solution to track this and then seek for the
bottlenecks:

Hi,
very nice that performance test.
I found that nginx was misconfigured an it was transferring unzipped
data over the network. With nginx params:
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/xml;
    gzip_http_version 1.0;
WFS is now only two times slower than direct connection to PostGIS.
Sorry for false alarm.

Thanks for the feedback, that would be nice to add to the Qgis server doc (
copying Paul who is going to work on that).

Hi all, Pretty long time ago in similar case we developed django app able to replicate django user and group permissions to PostgreSQL roles and permissions. So each user can use the same user name and passowrd in WEB client and using QGIS/PostgreSQL, manage permissions in django auth app and the same will be replicated in postgresql. Each model is table and django permissions are translated to PostgreSQL role permissions - implementation works also with m2m and related models. In basic cases such model is OK, but ir more complex implementations we loose logic build around model in django or need to repeat it in QGIS or move to PostgreSQL. If this sounds as suitable approach, I believe, we could try to review the code and make open source.

This is exactly what we also end up with and what we would like to
liberate from for the reasons you mentioned. Thank you anyway, at
least we know that we are not crazy alone.

This was an intentional change -- see discussion at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8064

But it needs further work, for instance it's only fixed line edit
widgets, and like you've noted, the NULL representation needs work.

Hi Nyall and devs, 

I have seen this discussion - but on Windows it currently looks really,
really bad. The is no distinction if something is a label or a widget,
which is quite bad in my opinion, as we have the option to hide labels.
How can the user then know if something is a widget or a label? 

I will add my comments on github. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Woohoo! Interactive Travis debugging
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgOG1BJwo8qP-zbiuB47fSxS5sUhje0jFQvytx_VS7Ymg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Good news -- interactive debugging is now available on our Travis
account, which means that it's now possible to remotely login and
interactively run tests on Travis builds! This should save a stack of
frustration when things just don't act the same on Travis as they do
locally.

Quoting the email from Travis:

"Now you can start restarting your builds in Debug mode with an API
request. To trigger a debug job:

0. Get your API token from your profile page at: https://travis-ci.org/profile

1. Send a POST request to /job/:job_id/debug replacing the TOKEN and
JOB_ID values below:

#! /usr/bin/env bash
  curl -s -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
   -H "Authorization: token <TOKEN>" \
   -d '{ "quiet": true }' \
   https://api.travis-ci.org/job/<JOB_ID>/debug

The Job ID is displayed in the build log after expanding "Build system
information".

2. Head back to the web UI and in the log of your job. There you
should see the following lines to connect to the VM:

Setting up debug tools.
Preparing debug sessions.
Use the following SSH command to access the interactive debugging environment:
ssh ukjiuCEkxBBnRAe32Y8xCH0zj at ny2.tmate.io

3. Connect from your computer using SSH into the interactive session,
and once you're done, just type exit and your build will terminate.

Once in the SSH session, these bash functions will come in handy to
run the different phases in your build:

On 64-bit Windows 10, attempting to build QGIS results in many errors 
that seem tied to a problem building the project qgis_core which results 
in the error:
Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec

Running configonly.cmd seemed to complete without errors. I had to 
change package-nightly.cmd to set
WITH_ORACLE=FALSE.

There must be a simple answer to why this is failing.

Hi,

I am still observing some huge delays of the bug tracker to send
notifications. If sending at all, I am still waiting for today's whole
activity.
My last mail about this did not raise much attention.
But this is particularly painful to track activity on issues we are working
on.

I'll try not to be sarcastic, but working with Redmine is already painful
enough when it's working as it's supposed to be.

Or maybe it's just my address that is filtering?

Cheers,
Denis

I added a SPF record.  Maybe that makes it easier for gmail to accept mail.

Hi all,

I have a simple problem for which I cannot find a simple solution: I
have a table in a gpkg, and I have to add often data coming from text.
Ideally I'd like to paste the text as a new record, having it parsed
automatically. Currently this only seems possible from an SQL shell.
Anything I'm overlooking?

All the best, and thanks.

Hi devs,

if I'm not wrong Processing script input combobox can filter some vector
types [0] but does not distinguish between single and multi geometries.

I think this could be useful to add. I faced a problem where an
algorithm could not run with multipoint geometries, but I had to filter
them after the RUN button was clicked

Some opinions?

Cheers

Matteo

Thanks Juergen, for doing this! I also have some domains for which I
forward mail, and Gmail is notorious to claim mail being spam.
Especially if the smtp server comes from a provider which does
forwarding itself (in my case: a big provider which used smtp servers of
smaller providers it recently bought).
For me also ading a SPF record fixed that.

Personally I miss about 50% of our/others Github mails, not sure where
those are eaten...

Richard

Hi,

Thanks a lot Jürgen for looking at.

But am I the only one experiencing this?

I don't have anything in my spams and did not receive anything from
yesterday.


Cheers,

May I support this request by Matteo?
When processing geometries, undesired multi-geometries are a frequent
outcome. It may even be useful to show the users that that the procedure
has a multi-geometry output. This usually means there are uplanned outcomes
and that the algorithm is not properly configured and/or is a wrong
solution for your problem.
Anyway, being able to precede a process with a multi-to-single algorithm
would be really convenient.
Thanks for pointing this out.

What about working on a geometric view with properly configured rules while
on PostgresSQL or with a trigger on other DBMSs (SQLite too)? It seems the
easiest way to avoid the shell. Maybe there could even be a way with a
virtual file based on internal SQLite... Just a thought...

I have been testing it and the main issue I had is that you cannot access
/root...
Or am I missing something?

Cheers,

Hi Carlo,

I think I didn't explain my problem well: I have new data coming as
text, and I'm looking for an easy way of appending these to an existing
gpkg table.

Thanks.

Hello,


Since 2 weeks now I'm trying to build qgis sources to get Qgis Quick but with no success until now...

Could you help me?

following step from https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL I need to build qgis on host and target windows 7 / 64 bits but I received messages

no module named PyQt5.pyqtconfig

and

import PyQt5.QtCore
importError:DLL load failed

I search a lot on Google to try to solve myself but I didn't found something to help me...



Kind regards
Philippe

This usually means there are uplanned outcomes and that the algorithm is not properly configured and/or is a wrong solution for your problem.

Why not just make your algorithms handle multi geometries? They are
very common, e.g. all polygon/line shapefiles in 3.0 are
multipolygon/multiline types. If you don't handle multi geometries
correctly, your algorithm won't work with these.

If your algorithm needs this to operate correctly, then it should be
done automatically within your algorithm itself.

(Apologies for re-posting; I was not subscribed to the qgis-developer list
before)

Dear QGIS developers,

I'd much appreciate some response in the following questions.

I rarely use Windows, yet I would like to learn about the latest status in
accessing GRASS GIS addons (not only regular modules) through QGIS under
Windows.

If I write an addon for GRASS GIS, can I then provide/ensure access to it for
Windows users of QGIS?

The are related documentations:

- https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/grass_integration/grass_integration.html?highlight=grass#customizing-the-grass-toolbox
- https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/addinggrasstools.html

Are these up-to-date?

Thank you, Nikos

Dear Nikos,

Approaches are a bit different for Processing and the GRASS plugin, though both do not allow usage of GRASS addons out-of-the-box.
Assuming you are aiming at integration in Processing have a look here:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/150100/how-to-add-my-own-grass-algorithms-to-processing
and
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/b3d2619976a69d7fb67b884492da491dfaba287c/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/description/r.horizon.height.txt
on how you would have to tweak local GRASS and QGIS installation.

For less experienced users that are supposed to use the addon, you would probably want to write a little installation routine for your addon, that puts txt files into right places in the installation and also installs the GRASS addon systemwide...

Cheers
Stefan

Message-ID: <CAECJsSq2BSS6wyLT=Hi1Zni1H-KdVAu5RKrv=Vdx2k2d_EvMCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In QGIS, there's the "Dissolve" algorithm [1] and in the advanced
digitizing tools, there's the "Merge selected features" [2]. Both afaics do
the same thing: replace input features by a single one whose geometry
represents the combination of their geometries. No statistics is performed
by default though the digitizing tool gives these options.

Questions:
* Why using two different words, making it hard for those not getting the
subtleties either to describe these features (trying to avoid the reuse of
the other word) and to translate them?
* Are there differences between these terms (and their effects) I'd have
missed?
* Any chance of homogenisation?

[1]
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html#dissolve
[2]
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#merge-selected-features

Regards,
Harrissou

Also there is the new aggregate processing tool that do exactly the same task
than dissolve but with much more powerfull options !

I've just hit this on an old vm that still had CMake 3.7.1 - upgrading to 3.12
fixed this (but I guess 3.8 would also have been new enough).

Hi,

Both the code repository link and the bug tracker link are good. They
redirect to the main compagny website. Is the code available somewhere?
Where is the bug tracker?

Hi Nyall,

It sounded great and I spent some hours on that better approach, but I 
didn't succeed. So maybe 3.6 will have it...

Tnx!

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdnbqpCYjNVKCgO0kdg6treXbBo4z5Pf6KLdtb+DEgx0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Recently I needed transformation between points from high-accuracy GPS
to British National Grid (EPSG:27700) which involves datum shift (WGS
84 to OSGB 1936) using OSTN15 grid.

The process to do that with QGIS is currently... well... really
clumsy. One needs to:
1. manually download grids from the web and extract .gsb file to Proj
data directory
2. manually add an entry to tbl_datum_transform table in srs.db in
QGIS installation

There are two main problems with that:
- both steps need adjustment of QGIS installation - not everyone has
admin privileges
- doing manual changes to srs.db is just too much to ask from ordinary user

I understand that it is hard to ship datum shift grids with QGIS due
to various issues (their size and amount, sometimes licensing) and
that's fine. But we should think about how to make it easier to use
them. There is a QGIS plugin [1] that provides a set of algs for
Processing that call ogr2ogr with the right grid files and download
them if they are not yet available - however there is no integration
with QGIS CRS database, so any other transforms inside QGIS can't make
use of that.

Note for those not familiar with srs.db: it is a sqlite3 db living in
QGIS source code which has been generated at some point from GDAL data
files. Over time it has gathered some manual ad-hoc updates of
parameters. Then upon QGIS build/installation we run "crssync" utility
to parse current GDAL data files again and update/insert CRS and datum
shift parameters (see QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::syncDatabase()).

My suggestions for QGIS:
1. any manual additions to srs.db should be listed as SQL commands
because it is difficult to track changes to srs.db which is a binary
blob (sqlite db). During the build of QGIS we would create final
srs.db
2. rather than manually adding entries about datum shift grids to
tbl_datum_transform table (which is generated from GDAL's
datum_shift.csv [2]) and contains parameters of 3/7 parameter
transform between datums, there should be a new table just for grid
files, ideally with links where they can be downloaded. (fun fact:
names of grid files in tbl_datum_transform table are stored in a
numeric column but because this is sqlite it just works)
3. it should be possible to add custom entries about datum shift grids
by users (just like it is possible to add custom CRS) - that is, such
table should be also in user's profile (in qgis.db)

My suggestions for Proj:
1. it should be possible to specify multiple data directories with
PROJ_LIB env variable, so that it is possible to use grids also from
user's home directory (not just the read-only system directory)
2. there could be a database similar to datum_shift.csv [2] that would
list well known datum shift grid files, so that QGIS does not need to
maintain its database and just pull that information out of Proj -
other projects could benefit from that as well.

I am aware of the fact that there is a big refactoring in Proj going
on [3] but I am not sure if any of the above suggestions are also in
the plans...

I would be happy to help implementing some of the above, but I would
like to first hear opinion of others - maybe I got something wrong and
maybe there are better ways to move forward. I hope gurus like
Kristian or Even read this and can offer some of their wisdom too :-)

Cheers

Martin,

It seems you want to have a read at my yesterday-written RFC:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1149

Particularly the part concerning the database:
http://even.rouault.free.fr/proj_cpp_api/rfc-2.html#database

and the data/sql/ files mentionne at

http://even.rouault.free.fr/proj_cpp_api/rfc-2.html#impacted-files

That's an interesting idea. Could you file a ticket to
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues about that ?

Sounds very much like:

https://github.com/rouault/proj.4/blob/iso19111/data/sql/grid_alternatives.sql


It would be good if we could utlimately get rid of QGIS srs.db and just use 
the future PROJ proj.db that could be used by the whole PROJ/GDAL/QGIS stack

I will personally port the plugin to QGIS 3 as soon as I can and
continue to make it available (I could even make a PR and propose it
as a tool that comes out of the box with Processing), this because
anyway has proven a valuable tool for less advanced users that are in
the situation to create copies of their data with a new CRS and with a
datum transformation involved.

Other than this anything that makes easier handling datum
transformations in QGIS is welcome.

Cheers!

By the way, the fragile code solution does not work for me. It does 
toggle the button but it does not activate the atlas preview.

# open layout
designer = iface.openLayoutDesigner(layout)

# turn on atlas preview mode
lo_view = designer.view()
lo_window = lo_view.window()
action = lo_window.findChild(QAction, 'mActionAtlasPreview')
action.toggle()

Just read through all that. Amazing work.

This makes me wonder when we could start using this in QGIS - I am
afraid we will have to wait for some time until it is all out in a
stable Proj release and adopted by major distributions, which may take
quite some time... (a year?)

Pretty much. Looking at the grid support, I see that the OSTN15
transformation is listed there in the grid_transformation table, but
we would also need an entry in grid_alternatives table for it +
include it in a future release of proj-datumgrid-europe package (that
particular grid is BSD licensed, so it should be fine).

Regarding contents of proj.db table, will it be acceptable for apps
like QGIS to browse its contents or should it be considered as Proj
library's implementation detail and any queries to it should go
through Proj API? I am thinking it would be nice to automatically
determine grid packages for missing grid files and to download them in
QGIS if the users wants. Another question is what to do with grids
with license that does not allow redistribution - should we have
entries with URL in grid_transformation table for such grid files as
well? (maybe with a flag that it is not direct link to a package, just
a web page about that grid)

One final thought - how about customization of proj.db by ordinary
users? In QGIS users are allowed to define their custom CRS based on
Proj string - is something like that going to be supported? E.g. to
have system proj.db and user proj.db with customizations?

That would be absolutely wonderful and I am looking forward to that day :-)

Some time ago Even and I briefly discussed the possibility of having
PROJ offer a direct link to grids that are needed for a transformation
but not available on the system. This should let apps like QGIS deal
with grids quite smoothly I think.

This would compliment or perhaps even replace the current
proj-datumgrid packages that we maintain at the moment. It would
still be based on a curated set of grids making sure that they are
free to distribute. For the ones that are not available for redistribution,
well… I guess the makers of those grids don’t really want you to use
them in the first place :-) In all seriousness though, there’s not much
we can do. They are quite often behind a login so direct links can’t
be offered. We do keep a non-exhaustive list of non-free grids here:

https://proj4.org/resource_files.html#non-free-grids

If a feature like this  is something that might be useful to users of
PROJ I we should look into this more closely.

Yes, likely. PROJ 6 is scheduled for February 2019. GDAL 2.4 for May

Well QGIS could do it, but there's the risk that the DB structure might change 
at some point.

I've anticipated that need.

In the PROJ API, there will be a function to list all potential 
transformations from CRS A to CRS B, independently of the availability of 
grids

PJ_OPERATION_RESULT PROJ_DLL *proj_obj_create_operations(
                            PJ_OBJ* source_crs,
                            PJ_OBJ* target_crs,
                            PJ_OPERATION_FACTORY_CONTEXT* operationContext);

and then you can iterate over the potential operations returned, and ask for 
each operation, which grids are needed, and if they are available, and if not, 
where you can find them:

int PROJ_DLL proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used_count(PJ_OBJ* coordoperation);

int PROJ_DLL proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used(PJ_OBJ* coordoperation,

I guess grid_alternatives could receive additional columns, which would be 
used if package_name is NULL, perhaps something like:

open_license BOOLEAN
download_url TEXT
direct_download BOOLEAN

Putting that in my TODO list

The issue is that a PROJ string is a rather low expressive way of defining a 
CRS, but yes that something I've in a corner of my mind, to allow defining 
custom CRS entries by PROJ strings or WKT strings, without going to the full 
relational structure.

> E.g. to

That's another issue. An easy solution would be to copy the system proj.db in 
a editable location and point PROJ_LIB to it

Having both at the same time is more tricky. For example if you add custom 
transformations in the user proj.db between official CRS of the system 
proj.db, you'd have an issue with broken foreign keys, so the user proj.db 
shouldn't enforce foreign keys.
and then PROJ could potentially create a in-memory database, that would ATTACH 
DATABASE the official and custom one, and for every table, create a temporary 
view that UNION ALL the tables of both dbs. Then that would be transparent for 
the rest of the code that does database queries.
I might consider doing this, but this is not a top priority for now.


Thanks for your valuable feedback on this !

Just a follow up here. Turns out the default configuration (shown
above) is limited to a 30 minute timeout, which isn't enough to get
all the dependencies installed and QGIS built, let alone leaving time
for debugging ;)

After some discussion with Travis staff (who have been fantastic, I've
got to say!), there's a workaround. By changing "quiet": true to
"quiet": false, the interactive session is subject to the normal 90(+)
minute timeout. The side effect is that all the commands entered are
visible to anyone looking at the Travis log, so be careful not to do
this with any sensitive information.

The command is full is:

#! /usr/bin/env bash
  curl -s -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
   -H "Authorization: token <TOKEN>" \
   -d '{ "quiet": false }' \
   https://api.travis-ci.org/job/<JOB_ID>/debug

Ok - I've done the proper approach in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8170/files

(I've also exposed an API call to show the item properties for a
particular item)

Let me know if there's anything else you think should be exposed from
the designer to the designer API.

Hi Nyall,

Do we have a place to store it? Developer docs maybe?

Hi, all,
Sorry to bother again. But is there anyone can help?
I have a problem building qgis 3.2 with python plugin. I think it may be related to the character set, as I'm using a Windows 10 OS in the Chinese language. I paste the error image here, hoping someone knows how to solve this problem. Thanks very much. 
This time I didn't change the character encoding to UTF-8 with BOM, instead I add the command "/utf-8" to the project settings to force vs2015 to execute with utf-8 encoding.

Thank you Nyall, compiling now.

Yesterday I was asked to create a plugin that works on layouts, so it 
will need a button in the layout composer. I think I could do this the 
same fragile/hacky way, but is there a proper way?

I also find it hard to create reports from python, but maybe that is 
still too young and not all finished?

Regards,
Raymond

Hi Nyall,

The setAtlasPreviewEnabled(True) still does not work correctly. It works 
exactly like the python workaround you mentioned: It toggles the atlas 
button but does not activate the atlas. I mean, the prev and next 
buttons stay disabled and the map does not display page number 1.

If I then, turn off and on the atlas preview, it works as expected.

Does it need to get some kind of gui redraw/update call?

Regards,
Raymond

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using help button from a third-party Processing
	algorithm
Message-ID: <CAECJsSo+7Etx=mr1xwyyxmLEFOF5Js6=P8-4uzhRxpPgKGAo8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I raised this issue months ago in the community list [0] from a
documentation maintainer perspective. It does not get solved. It arises
again, but from a user perspective (aka as a bug report [1]) and as this
impacts QGIS GUI, let's try to discuss and find a solution here: Have a
guideline for the behavior of help button in Processing dialogs.

Depending on the provider, the help button of an algorithm behaves
differently:

* For QGIS algs, it brings you to our docs;
* For GRASS algs, it brings you to the GRASS official docs. The issue I met
is that the docs link is not updated when the GRASS version changed (for
example, using the osgeo4w qgis-dev-g7.4.1.bat file, it should update the
settings with GRASS 7.4 paths)
* For GDAL, it brings you to the GDAL docs. I think that while perfectible,
our GDAL alg doc is good enough to link instead, and our docs also propose
a link to the corresponding GDAL call.
* SAGA tries to open a page in our docs and returns a 404 (as reported in
[1]). I guess this would be the case for any other third party alg (R, OTB,
TauDem, LASTools... to name those we have docs in our repo).

IMO, and I already exposed it in the previous message (read it for detailed
rationales), other than GDAL, pressing a help button should rely on the
third party algs docs (ie, the way GRASS works). A check in the history of
our doc repo proves that we do not maintain the other algs (reason why I'd
like to remove them from our repo) and they actually have their proper
website, better served than what we document. So better use it.

I don't know if this has to be done in QGIS code or in the plugin that
links the two tools nor if QGIS proposes the necessary configs to help plug
the other providers docs (so that we could invite the other projects to do
the necessary changes/links). But it would be nice to get an official
position and sort this out (both about keeping unmaintained docs and fixing
help buttons).

Hi Harrissou,

thanks for raining this important issue again

+1. I think that for GDAL the Help button should point to our doc (where
the links to the GDAL official docs are listed ). This allows us to
improve these algs with some more specific examples/pictures/etc

for all these 3rd part providers, we know that it is (and always will
be) difficult to keep the links updated to the official docs. I think
that, if we cannot provide this support, we should drop the Help button
for these providers. I know that it could sound harsh, but better than
opening a 404 page

A personal UI opinion: instead of opening an external browser, what
about resurrecting the old Help tab in the alg dialog?

Message-ID: <638d6f37-e2d6-3a5c-02d1-6b97d51f91dc@duif.net>

Hi,

using our national DEM WCS:

https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn3/wcs?

Loading the layer ahn3_5m_dtm for an area of a couple of km in
epsg:28992 is very slow.

I'm not so familiar with the WCS specs, but I see QGIS asking:

https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/ahn3/wcs?SERVICE=WCS&VERSION=1.0.0&REQUEST=GetCoverage&FORMAT=GEOTIFF_FLOAT32&COVERAGE=ahn3_5m_dtm&BBOX=10000,250000,356250,618750&CRS=EPSG:28992&RESPONSE_CRS=EPSG:28992&WIDTH=10&HEIGHT=10

which is the whole of the Netherlands (in a 10x10 pixel output??) and
after that a more proper bbox.

Is this supposed to go like this?
I reckon that (if the WCS data does not have overviews), loading the
whole dataset all the time is pretty intensive.

Anybody more familiar with this can tell something about this?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Dear all,

I have a simple problem.
I'm porting the opeNoise plugin [1] to 3.x
I'm not the author plugin but I'm experiencing that the plugin reload
fails. It tels me that the plugin have been reloaded but the changes
are non applied. Even if I deactivate and than activate the plugin the
same results (no changes detected).
The only way is to restart the software any time losing too much time.

Can someone help me please?
thanks

This should have been fixed for a couple of weeks, since
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8014/commits/c3db16cd6

Do you still see this with recent 3.3 builds?

Hi,

Nyall, the reporter is using 3.2.3 and I do not have third-party providers
installed here. So it might be fixed though regarding the issue report I
mentioned above I'm not really sure given that:
- if I understand the commit, saga is among the providers we keep showing
the help button for
- the link built (
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/saga/rastertools.html#sagaaveragewithmask2)
by the button refers to an alg we don't have in docs (Average with mask 2 -
added to QGIS only a year ago) and more importantly, and this is what leads
to 404, a "rastertools" category we don't provide (and I can't see where
that category comes from). And we are anyway far from covering SAGA modules
(see
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/saga/index.html
vs
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/description
vs http://www.saga-gis.org/saga_tool_doc/2.2.4/a2z.html (latest?))

Does anything prevent us to:
1- apply the same rule to qgis and gdal providers: use our docs
2- apply same rule to grass and saga providers: use their docs
3- hide the help button for other providers and let them implement their
path?

Looks like 3 is already done but 1 and 2 need some tweaks.

Regards,
Harrissou

How sure are you that it is not reloaded?
Can you check by writing some message with a version number?

Normally writing the

__init__
initGui
unload

should be enough. Only thing I could think off is that you do not
disconnect the QActions (though I'm not even sure if that is really needed).

Also note that if you reload your plugin AFTER an exception, often you
end up with a situation where QGIS still has (parts) of the plugin in
memory while also loading a new version of your plugin, so sometimes
showing 2 versions of your pluginbutton/toolbar etc. I think only a QGIS
restart works then.

Another think I've had is that mixing up an already installed version
with the one I'm developing (because the symbolic link was gone, or I
was actually working in another profile then I thought or.... other
silly things)

Regards,

Richard

Hi,

How about reloading with the "Plugin reloader" plugin [0]? You might need
to enable "show experimental plugins" beforehand.
I thik this would save QGIS I/O.

Hi Richard,

I don't know about the QGIS side, but from the server side I'd agree 
with your assessment.

The WCS 1.0 spec says that the server will use the interpolation method 
specified in the getcapabilities (or if none is defined (as here), then 
assume Nearest Neighbour) for alternative widths/heights.

Having to interpolate an entire country down to a 10x10 grid seems 
utterly bonkers for a WCS. Even WMS (where you will have overviews so 
it'll be massively faster) I can't think of why you'd want a tiny 10x10 
output.

Maybe this is QGIS's way of trying to creating a WCS legend icon?

Whatever the reason, I'd suggest raising it as a bug report as it's not 
going to be doing any favours to the WCS servers for no real benefit.

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hi,

It's not so straightforward to recursively reload complex plugins, thus both 
Plugin Manager and Plugin Reloader have a long-standing problem with reloading 
modules placed in subdirectories. This is the case of opeNoise, where most of 
the code is in the 'tools' subdirectory, so all changes there require QGIS to 
be restarted.

I've just released Plugin Reloader 0.7.5 that hopefully fixes this issue 
finally. Could you please test if it helps with opeNoise? If so, I'll apply 
the same to the Manager or even qgis.utils.

Unfortunately it's only for QGIS 3, as I didn't success to make it working 
with Python 2 (and the old opeNoise).

Best regards,
Borys

I can't explain the background here, but it seems deliberate. There's
a comment before this request is made:

"
  // It may happen (GeoServer) that extent reported in
spatialDomain.Envelope is larger
  // than the coverage. Then if that larger BBOX is requested, the
server returns
  // request BBOX intersected with coverage box scaled to requested
WIDTH and HEIGHT.
  // GDAL WCS client does not suffer from this probably because it
probably takes
  // extent from lonLatEnvelope (it probably does not calculate it from
  // spatialDomain.RectifiedGrid because calculated value is slightly
different).

  // To get the true extent (it can also be smaller than real if
reported Envelope is
  // than real smaller, but smaller is safer because data cannot be
shifted) we make
  // request of the whole extent cut the extent from spatialDomain.Envelope if
  // necessary"

 getCache( 1, mCoverageExtent, 10, 10 );


Radim may know more and may be able to explain if this workaround is
still necessary

Hi All,

We, Japanese user, have problem in QGIS 3.x.

In QGIS 2.x was able to use the menu translated into Japanese.
But in QGIS 3.x, some menus are not translated into Japanese.

I looked at transifix, but the translation seems to be done.

We issued a bug report, but we have no reply...

Dear Borys, 


I update the plugin reloader to the version 0.7.5 and I tried to use it on openoise but it still fails. 
No changes are detected. 


I'm using QGIS 3.2 and a ported version of openoise (not the official one that is for qgis 2.x) 


Thanks 
Pierluigi

I uploaded following updates to OSGeo4W (32[0] & 64bit[1]):

- Qt 5.11.2 (from 5.9.2; with sip, PyQt5, QScintilla, qca, qtkeychain and Qwt)
- Python 3.7 (from 3.6; including all 49 currently included extensions)
- PROJ 5.2.0 (from 4.9.3; plus datumgrids)
- GEOS 3.7.0 (from 3.6.2)
- SpatiaLite 4.3.0a (from 4.3.0; also with lwgeom from postgis 2.5)
- GDAL 2.3.2 (from 2.2.4; including updated/rebuilt dependencies ogdi &
  openfyba)

QGIS 2.18 are already rebuilt, but the builds of QGIS 3.2 and master are still
underway.  Nightlies of 2.18 and 3.2 will follow.

For GDAL and PROJ there are also legacy packages (proj4dll and gdal202dll) with
the previos package's DLLs.  So other dependencies (like GRASS) should work on
without a rebuild.

I don't remember more than i wrote in comments and i don't know if it is
still necessary. Better to keep it i think, but it could be done optional.

Looking forward to 3.4,

I installed the latest QGIS master this morning via OSGeo4w (64bit) and installed version 3.3.0-97 of qgis-dev on Windows 7.  I get an error message saying:

 "The program can't start because Qt5WebKitWidgets.dll is missing from your computer."

Trying to start QGIS returns:

 "Could not load qgis_app.dll Windows Error %1 is not a valid Win32 application. Check qgis-dev-bin-g7.4.1.env for correct environment paths."

Is this because the builds are still building or has something changed in the build process?  I'll wait for another build and see if that fixes things.

QGIS 2.18 are already rebuilt, but the builds of QGIS 3.2 and master are still underway.  Nightlies of 2.18 and 3.2 will follow.

Hi Ross

Looks like Luigi is experiencing the same issue, reported on IRC, so I guess
it's not just a local issue for you.

Thanks

Tom

Apparently my recent fix [1] wasn't enough and some modules are still not 
unloaded. Unfortunately I won't be able to work on it soon :(

As a workaround, maybe you can optimize the way you reload the whole QGIS? For 
example run QGIS in a loop (so you only need to press Ctrl-Q to reload), 
create a dedicated user profile (not burdened with other plugins), configure 
the startup project (with a test data), temporarily trigger one of the plugin 
actions in initGui (so the dialog you're currently working on opens 
automatically after reload).

Regards,
Borys

Message-ID: <132393474.3894207.1539613223908.JavaMail.root@gfosservices.it>

Dear All, 


I have a strange phenomena running some code. 
I'm using the processing algorithm qgis:pointsalonglines output = processing.run( "qgis:pointsalonglines" , { 'INPUT' : poly_to_lines , 
'DISTANCE' : spaced_pts_distance , 
'START_OFFSET' : 0 , 
'END_OFFSET' : 0 , 'OUTPUT' : 'memory:' }) 


The output vector should have 3 columns (FID, angle,Distance) 


If I run the code inside the python console plugin (even from a sample code) It works correctly but if I run ti inside my plugin, calling such lines inside a method the output only have 2 columns (distance and angle) so the 
receiver_points_memory_layer = output[ 'OUTPUT' ] 


Ant picking the attribute table with: 
receiver_memory_feat[ 'FID' ] 


tells me attributes = [receiver_points_feat_id, receiver_memory_feat['FID']] 

KeyError: 'FID' 


Where I'm wrong? 


thanks 
Pierluigi

So now I'd like to set another expression, quite similar, but this time 
the svg-path to a QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayer.

Where can I find the name of that property? I found the 
QgsLayoutObject.PictureSource here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/c89a542365eb46317468135cb33236ecc0c3768c/src/core/layout/qgslayoutobject.h#L47

But I don't know what class should hold the data defined property 
enumeration for an svgMarkerSymbolLayer. Searching for "enum 
DataDefinedProperty" in the qgis code doesn't get me any other result.

Hope anyone can help me out here!

Kind regards,
Raymond

The API uses ints instead of the direct DataDefinedProperty enums, as
the enums vary by part of code (there's separate enums for symbology,
labelling, layouts, etc)

For symbology:

layer = QgsSvgMarkerSymbolLayer(...)
...
layer.setDataDefinedProperty( QgsSymbolLayer.PropertyName,
QgsProperty.fromExpression( " some expression ") )

Message-ID: <266D98E0D2152846BFF2A81588EA7F1D989C49@TCE4.TCE.local>

Hello,
I am seeking help regarding importing 'qgis.core' into a standalone python script, python executable in cmd, or in a OSGeo4W shell cmd executable. I have python 3.7 installed on my machine along with OSGeo4W64, QGIS3.2. The current error message I am getting:
[cid:image001.png at 01D46539.86379D80]

Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated. My goal with this is to use qgis geoprocessing tools in the same manner I am able to use the arcpy module to geocode. Most of the solutions online suggested adding to the PATH and PYTHONPATH user environmental variables, one of them being I have tried adding the location of the 'qgis._core.dll' file, and I still get the same error.

Thank you,
-ryan

Hi Ryan,

It is not the dll's that your are missing, but the actual QGIS python stuff.

In your PYTHONPATH you have to point to the in my install avaialbe dir:

<YOURINSTALLATION>/share/qgis/python/

THERE you find the python dirs/modules:

console  plugins  pyplugin_installer  qgis  qsci_apis

It should be revealed to you also when you do the following in your
python console:

import sys; print(sys.path)

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hello,

we managed to add Travis Windows build for MDAL
<https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL>. If you are interested, best is
to look at .travis.yml
<https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL/blob/master/.travis.yml> and
scripts/travis/windows
<https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL/tree/master/scripts/travis/windows>.
The libraries (GDAL, NetCDF, HDF5, ...) are taken from OSGeo4W which is
already included in https://chocolatey.org.

Hello Richard, thank you for the response.



I don't have that path in my QGIS install, these are the only folders in the 'share' directory for QGIS3.2:

[cid:image001.png at 01D46617.7D6F3CB0]





What is strange is that I tried importing qgis.core again today just for fun, and I got a different error message:

[cid:image002.png at 01D46617.EAE4C850]



Im guessing this means I need to be running my python program in a python 3.6 shell instead of a python 3.7 shell? But before I uninstall 3.7 and install 3.6 I would like

To see what you make of this error. There isn't much help online with this ImportError regarding QGIS.



Thanks!

-Ryan

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Bug with Advanced Digitizing Tools - Offset Curve
Message-ID: <CABPxTToUsys7DZ3zxYGy2h6RS9YJ3MYdSrx8GtrVsjK-iy2wBA@mail.gmail.com>

There are several issues with the Advanced Digitizing Offset Curve tool and
I don't think is operating as intended.
1. If a MultiPolygon is selected and then I click on the object I get the
error "Creating offset geometry failed".
2. If I try it on a MultiLIneString object, the line segment that I click
on is resized, but not the whole object. I hope this is not the intended
action.

Is the Offset Curve tool meant to be a resize tool? It seems to do that,
but I wonder if there shouldn't be just a simple resize tool without all
the other options.

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding a panel to layer properties dialog from a
	python plugin
Message-ID: <CAFcNcQYq9fVwfXz2fQrCKfjsthgmGgxjLm_cAH-MwVfkB5Wzqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

The API docs for QgisInterface[1] mention the existence of a
`registerMapLayerConfigWidgetFactory()` method which says in its
documentation:

> Register a new tab in the vector layer properties dialog.

I've been trying to test this out and see if I can add a new panel to a
layer's properties dialog via a Python plugin. So far I've had no luck.
Couldn't find any other docs/samples online showing how to do this. Perhaps
someone can help me out?

Here is what I have:

-  made a custom .ui file in Qt designer with a simple QWidget that only
has a QLabel inside
-  implemented a class inheriting from both
`qgis.gui.QgsMapLayerConfigWidget` and my ui file (after it is loaded with
uic.loadUiType)
- implemented a class inheriting from
`qgis.gui.QgsMapLayerConfigWidgetFactory`. This class implements all of the
methods declared as *virtual* in the cpp API, including the
`createWidget()`, which returns a new instance of my custom
maplayerconfigwidget class
- in my plugin's `initGui()` method I'm calling
`iface.registerMapLayerConfigWidgetFactory()` and pass along my custom
factory

I guess this should be enough to have a minimum working prototype. However,
this is what happens:

- When I load up a vector layer and then open it's properties dialog, QGIS
just crashes with a core dumped message.
- When I load up a raster layer and then open it's properties dialog,
nothing happens. I suspect this functionality is probably not even
available for raster layers. Is this true?

Can someone provide some pointers or some existing reference on how this
would work? Thanks in advance

Hi Ricardo,

For python, looking at the python API is always a good start ;)
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/other/QgisInterface.html#qgis.gui.QgisInterface.registerOptionsWidgetFactory

This means you must give a QgsOptionsWidgetFactory
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/Options/QgsOptionsWidgetFactory.html

Here the docs could be clearer but this is the class you have to inherit.
You need to implement title, icon and createWidget. In the latter, you'll
be able to load your UI and return the widget to be displayed. The widget
you return must inherit QgsOptionsPageWidget.

I hope this helps!

Dear Team,

I need your support for multi file execution with gdaldem (python script).
Could you please provide the code for the same.

Thanks

Hi Denis, all

I keep forgetting there are now also (totally cool) docs for the python
API... I guess old habits die hard ;)

>From your tip I guess the problem I'm facing is likely related to my class
inheriting from the wrong base ( as I'm not using QgsOptionsPageWidget).

I'll try it out later and let you know ;)

As for the raster layer properties dialog , is this indeed not implemented
there?

Best regards

Hi again,

Sorry I pasted the wrong links...
This was for adding a page to global options.

Here it is for layers.
https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/other/QgisInterface.html#qgis.gui.QgisInterface.registerMapLayerConfigWidgetFactory

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/gui/Map/QgsMapLayerConfigWidgetFactory.html

There you have to implement supports layers. So it is very likely that it
will work for rasters but did not check.

Denis

Thanks Nyall, that works!

And now I know the property name, I could also find the other 
properties. And then I started searching the code for more and found the 
ones listed below. Possibly there are more.

It was apparently too hard for me finding these property names and I 
wonder if others are struggling as well. Where could we put this in a 
way where people can find it and where it will be easily to maintain? 
The cookbook?

Raymond

Hi Devs,

Recently people tell me that certain services (WCS or WFS) are not
working anymore for them.

Sometimes I can reproduce the problem locally, but often I cannot
(sometimes because they have a proxy problem or ...).

Would it not be great if those people could easily see the requests that
are fired? Other then only having the debug info and grep into the sea
of output that generates?

Thinking about a 'Requests'-tab in the Log Messages where you can maybe
disable/enable the logging of certain types of requests. Or where you
can filter certain types of requests.

Is this doable? An idea?

Logging all requests going through 'QgsConnectionManager'?

(in my case I have 2 problems at this moment in a
Client-Window-environment: MetaSearch is erroring because I'm behind a
firewall (but I cannot see which requests it is firing) and CWS is
failing on certain services (but I cannot see which requests it is
firing)...

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I'd find this incredibly useful, as I've had to attach an HTTP debugger in
the past, which is overkill when all you want is to see the full requests.

Thanks

Hi Richard,

That is a good idea. I'd also like to see this implemented.

Hi Richard,

I would love this as well, when trying to debug WMS/WFS problems.

In the past I've been using Wireshark for this, which you can try for now.

+1 to have the ability to display all network requests from within the QGIS console. This has been a recent discussion in some of my projects.

Thanks

Hi all,

in fact, the WMS tab is already present in the log panel. Echoing the
requests there should be enough.

All the best.

Doable. Just better make sure that NONE of this would be exposed via
Python, as potentially that's a large security risk. (Plugins
listening in to all network requests happening, including
authenticated requests...)

Sounds like a bug

This is by design.

Nope - it's an offset/buffer tool, not resize.

A followup to my followup: Travis staff made changes based on our
feedback and now the interactive build timeout matches the normal
build, so it's possible to run in quiet mode and still get the full
timeout.

I know in past there's been frustration directed to the Travis CI
infrastructure when things fail, but full credit to them-- every time
one of us has asked something of them, they've been super receptive
and accommodating to our needs. Pretty damn decent service consider
how much we (don't) pay them!

Hi, all,
Sorry to bother again. But is there anyone can help?
I have a problem building qgis 3.2 with python plugin. I think it may be related to the character set, as I'm using a Windows 10 OS in the Chinese language. I paste the error image here, hoping someone knows how to solve this problem. Thanks very much. 
This time I didn't change the character encoding to UTF-8 with BOM, instead I add the command "/utf-8" to the project settings to force vs2015 to execute with utf-8 encoding.

Hi all (well, specifically Jürgen!)

Since the recent upgrades to Qt libraries on osgeo4w I'm getting an
error in my Windows build:

"""

but this file does not exist. Possible reasons include:


* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.


* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.


* The installation package was faulty and contained

but not all the files it references.

Indeed, Qt5WebKitd.dll isn't included anywhere in the osgeo4w install.
Is this an error with the webkit package?

Not sure about the large security risk?

Ok, a quick stab, add into the Python console
(choose the print or logMessage line to your preference)


def request(operation, request, data):
    print('# Request: ', request.url())
     QgsMessageLog.logMessage('{}'.format(msg), self.MSG_TITLE, Qgis.Info)
def response(reply):
    print('# Response: ', reply.url())
    QgsMessageLog.logMessage('Response: {}'.format(reply.url()),
'NetworkRequests', Qgis.Info)

def timeout(reply):
    print('# Timeout: ', reply.url())
   QgsMessageLog.logMessage('Response: {}'.format(reply.url()),
'NetworkRequests', Qgis.Info)

nam=QgsNetworkAccessManager.instance()

nam.requestAboutToBeCreated.connect(request)
nam.requestCreated.connect(response)
nam.requestTimedOut.connect(timeout)



Some questions that come up, will dive into it deeper, but if somebody
has a hint, let me know plz:

- why do I not see WMS firing it's GetMap requests, while all other
requests of the WMS provider are there (legends, capabilities,
getfeatureinfo)
Something to do with handling in another thread?
Can we also show those?

- (having WCS troubles) looking at the Python Console the WCS provider
is firing A LOT of requests. But I have to look into what the responses
are, maybe it is just a http connection which is sending parts or so??

Anyway, I'm aware that this is the very first begin, I know that a lot
can go wrong with http requests, so we could show much more from the
Response objects...

I could start with a minimal Python plugin?

Using current QgsMessageLog would benefit a lot from for example
using/showing one tab (so not switch to another one just because that
one received some info).
Another feature request would be to be able to filter the messages there
(eg only show the wms or getMap or ... requests).

And off course, all this only works for code that actually uses the
QgsNetworkAccessManager (/me hoping I get WMS also working).
So again a FeatureRequest for a common Python codebase to actually use
the QgsNetworkAccessManager, so people do not use Requests or urllib3 or
so....

Anybody has some input?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Message-ID: <a1c26eae-b499-e9a4-6a11-bd7f0d6192c6@duif.net>

Hi,

See also my comments at this PR: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8245

But in short: current Open/Save File dialogs in QGIS use a 'All Files
(*.*)' filter which is not portable. I hit this in
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/19703

So I fixed for the mdal dialog (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8245),
but grepping there are more of places where you will still not see ALL
your files (because *.* does not show files without extension).

Is this something we should/can fix globally (by using some text
constant for it?).

I also read http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfiledialog.html#setNameFilters that
mimetype filters are the preferred way. Not sure if we in the geo-world
have those for the myriad of file types we have though.

Also it is not sure if the file-filters (the little dropdown for the
different types in the dialogs) should be translated fully or not.
In Gnome you ONLY see the text and NOT the actual filter expressions.
On Windows you see both.
What is the preferred way to make this translatable (eg for
japanese/chinese users)? As an example:
 2DM Mesh File(*.2dm)
Should only the text be translated tr("2DM Mesh File")+"(*.2dm)"
OR the whole string tr("2DM Mesh File(*.2dm)").
In code I see both types of use. I was wondering how filenames like
example.2dm or example.shp would look like on Japanes Windows machines...

Last: on gnome I have a silly long file filter list with all emtpy items
in it (see https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20169). Can others reproduce?

Thoughts?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

I just tested on multi polygon without any issue.
Can you maybe post a geometry (multi polygon) with which you fail to use
the offset tool?

Hi Lists,

I'm cross posting this to GeoServer-Users over from QGIS-Dev as the 
current QGIS code seems to be trying to work around a GeoServer quirk 
based on Nyall's code-comment snippet.

Is there something different QGIS can do to work around the stated issue 
in a better way given I guess requesting a 10x10 Coverage via WCS isn't 
going to be doing the host server any favours?

Cheers,

Jonathan

Hey all,

I'm wondering if anyone's aware of any QGIS plugins which are hosted
on gitlab which have a CI workflow setup.

There's quite a number of plugins which have this on github/Travis
infrastructure (using the available QGIS docker containers) which are
easy to use as a template, but I'm not able to find any similar
existing setups for gitlab CI.

Can anyone point me toward any?

The behavior described in the comments might be actually happening...
sorry, no time to
look into it right now, we have the JDK11 code sprint incoming and all
spare time is going there.
I checked the ticket tracker, found no bug report about it.
I would be useful if someone could verify, maybe using a built-in demo
dataset.

Fixing it right now might help, but it will take many years before older
versions of GeoServer
out there are upgraded, we get a surprisingly high number  people running 5
years old versions of GeoServer
asking questions on the list.... just saying, even if one rushes to fix it
now, that code in QGIS might
not be lifted anytime soon (but it could be made configurable I guess?).

Also, in GeoServer WCS 1.0 normally uses overviews when available, but of
course the layer
might not have them, or be a mosaic of many files. That said, the WCS being
queried is not a GeoServer,
not sure how it might work.

Finally...  any chance QGIS could be using WCS 2.0 instead? The 1.0 and 1.1
protocols are ancient and pretty clunky,
WCS 2.0 is so much better from all points of view.
In fact, I believe that WCS 1.0 and 1.1 have received little to no
significant maintenance
in GeoServer for the longest time, I'd venture to guess very few care about
them.
WCS 2.0 is instead receiving interest and more care, likely because it has
been chosen by INSPIRE
for raster download services.

Coming back to this older discussion -- last week a workaround was
pushed to 3.3 master to try and avoid this issue. I'd love for
widespread testing of the currently nightlies to confirm that the
issue is now fixed (or not)! If anyone is still hitting this issue,
please report here the build number and what method you are calling to
retrieve a layout item.

Fingers crossed :) would be great to have this solved for 3.4!

Andrea: confirmed it is not a Geoserver setup (anymore) I am told.

I did a quick test by putting the lines Nyall said in comments, but QGIS
is still requesting this 'testing' url's (and a lot of times if I am
corrent).

But if this (QGIS) behaviour is created for one server-type (only), I
think we should try to make it an optional step?

Hi,

I'm afraid this issue is back, ie translations that use the ellipsis are
not displayed.
Maybe it has to do with the osgeo4w upgrade of last week?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Identify Features icon vs Actions icon
Message-ID: <688c92f8ceeba543fc7e31d849d7593f@carto.net>

Hi, 

We have a "usability" problem in one of our projects: 

The "Identify Features" icon and the "Actions" icon are very similar
(both are blue, both have arrows) and are located in the toolbar next to
each other. Now, one of our users mixed up the two tools, and because
some layers had "Duplicate feature" as the active icon, the user
accidentally started to duplicate features, while he wanted to just
query the attributes. 

Questions: 

1. Can the two icons be made more "distinguishable"? 

2. Would it make sense to place the two tools not next to each other
(personally not sure about it). 

3. I am clarifying with David/Matthias if we can "opt-in" or "opt-out"
from the duplicate features default action, for layers we don't need
this functionality. 

Thanks for your thoughts, 

Andreas

Message-ID: <CAMtsY+YOOb9Vv=u+de3TRAETuVp1_JO=_n5ry7GsBYwK2mHW+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There is an issue (#18891) stating that the measure tool dialog doesn't
keep the last entered units when you reopen it.

Looking at the code, it indeed uses the project units.

This is not optimal to me.
Moreover, there are both preferred units in global settings (in map tools
tab) and in project.

What would be the best approach?
Use the global ones instead of the project?
Then override with a specific setting for this dialog?

Hi,
Any clue on how the "Rotate Point symbol" or "Offset Point symbol"
digitizing tools are expected to work? The docs [0] seems wrong (or
broken?) and whatever I try (including creating a field named "rotation"),
I get a "The selected point does not have a rotation (*or an offset*)
attribute set." message. And no help on how I could *set* this attribute...

Hi

In Spain, but I suppone in every place of the world, there are many
schools, universities or institutions that are dumped with free licences to
their users. This happen especially in school and univerisities.

Do we have best practices (e.g letter templates) describing the effect to
teach proprietary GIS sw respect open/free solutions?

whould be fine to have a template that could be enriched with national or
regional laws.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] restricting layers to be added to legend to those
	turned on in the selected map theme
Message-ID: <004d01d46a33$30d26c40$927744c0$@gmail.com>

Hi, 

in QGIS 2.18 when you had selected for your layout to "follow visibility
preset" and then went to "Add layer to legend" your list of layers would be
restricted to the subset of layers that were turned on for the preset (now
called map theme).

This does not happen in Q3.2 or the latest Q developmental version where
instead all of the layers in the project are listed.

I love the new search dialogue built into the developmental version so that
you can quickly search for your layer to add to the legend; however, it is
still much quicker to add the relevant layers to your legend by restricting
the layers shown in the selection dialogue to those turned on in the map
theme selected to be followed (i.e., checkbox for follow map theme
selected). Usually I have lots of layers in the project that are not turned
on so it can be hard to remember what the layers are called later when I get
around to creating the legend

Possibly this change in behaviour was introduced by design or necessitated
by some other limitation so may not even be possible to retain?

 

Regards

Rob

there already is a change in this. I'm from North Rhine-Westphalia in
Germany. Nearly all universities are part of federal state's licence
program of a well known US-GIS-provider. But some universities seem
to pay more than others. When I've started spatial planning about 13
years ago, GIS license was free for everyone. But it got harder and
harder to get one, since the fee of the shared licensed raised. Right
now, GIS is limited to either your final paper or you have to proof
that you need it for a semester's course. In both variants, it's
limited to a year.

But - like I said - there is a move to free GIS software. About
8-13 years ago, the well known GIS was used about everywhere beside
F*E and M*pInf* (and some special ones with CAD of course). But
because of the new fee and the CRAZY GREAT new abilities of FOSS,
I'm can see much more corporations move to QGIS.

Really, I've worked for a lot of corporations and I've visited lots
of lectures at several universities. Things are going open. There
are much courses about "free beer / free software" (the philosophics)
and GIS courses are moving from A*GIS to QGIS.

Another good point: Some teachers in Germany are civil servants.
They're not allowed to get gifts from corporations, like free courses
or whatever. Whenever teachers got into contact with QGIS in university,
I see them using it at school, too. But for them, one thing is
important: the GUI should not change too much. That's the big benefit
of "old style" A*GIS: it looks equal since about v8.x ;)

Best regards,
Tobias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Min qt version for 3.6?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgbWKAmc8Y=b3EJvMkVUjsoQNtKXVeCGWnayW4WFVfWrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm wondering if we can bump the minimum Qt version for QGIS 3.6 to
something more modern, e.g. Qt 5.9.

The current minimum of 5.4/5.5 (no-one knows which it actually is!) is
very old, and very buggy. (See discussion at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8265). The sooner we can drop
support for 5.6, the better experience we can offer all round.

By bumping to 5.9 we'd lose support for Ubuntu 16.04, but I think this
is perfectly reasonable -- users of that platform would still be able
to run the QGIS 3.4 LTR release. (In my opinion, running an older LTR
distro should never equate to always having the latest end user
applications available.)

Would there be any objections to this change?

The change was intentional, as it allows layers to be added to a
legend when they aren't visible in the main canvas (e.g. due to the
canvas showing a different map theme, or having a layer for "legend
purposes only").

I'd suggest we could satisfy both use cases by adding a checkbox "only
show visible layers" to the bottom of this dialog. Do you agree?

The docs [0] seems wrong (or broken?) and whatever I try (including creating a field named "rotation"), I get a "The selected point does not have a rotation (or an offset) attribute set." message. And no help on how I could set this attribute...

Works fine here. I just data define link it over to an appropriate
field (numeric for rotation, string for offset), and then the tools
work as described.

The only thing I can think of is that the docs are a little unclear here:

"near the Rotation option of the highest level (preferably) of the
symbol layers"

This should be set at the "marker" level, not at an individual layer
level. (i.e. click the "Marker" entry in the list, not "simple marker"
and set the rotation there).

Offset can be set at any layer and it will work.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changelog for 3.4?
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgCUPDXbzZH9SJ3p9P4frQkTev5bZVdbxsebHrvtpCy8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I've spent some time this morning working on adding "shell" entries
for all features added to 3.4 to the changelog. But honestly, the
changelog is in horrible shape given that we're heading to release in
a couple of days. Most entries are severly lacking detail, and we've
almost no screenshots.

This is a call to action -- please fix up your features and make sure
their entries are nicely populated and correct!

Also - I've got to say, I'm rather annoyed at how bad our FEATURE
commit messages were during 3.4. There's way too many vague messages
like "[feature] Improve handling of data" with absolutely no detail
provided at all. I don't envy the job the documentation team has to do
to find out exactly what the features are here. Really -- there's no
excuse for this, it's just plain laziness on our (us developers)
behalf and needs to change in 3.6.

Thanks for nudging everyone on this Nyall. BTW I deployed (just too late for you I guess :-( ) a fix for the issue that required a funder and sponsor link for every entry, so hopefully it will make it quicker to add new entries for those doing so.

Thanks Tim!

I'm also hitting an issue when trying to delete entries -- is that

No it shouldn’t be, AnitaH can you take a look?

Also BTW#@: Those scared off from editing the changelog by the review / disappearing entries after you edit them procedure. We have removed this so any edits you make should appear directly on the changelog.

Thanks for all the work you have put into getting the stubs in there Nyall!

Hi,

Matteo, your issue is confirmed for French also: we also remark that some
wrong translations present in previous releases and that we fixed meanwhile
are back. And, obviously no way to find them on Transifex. Likewise, some
new strings we translated are still shown in English.
So now, we have ellipsis translations that are lost AND some ghost and
wrong translations that are back: looks like if an older translation file
(weeks/months?) was applied to QGIS.

This is really puzzling translators and from a non-English user point of
view, would be a real regression if released in 3.4LTR.

Regards,
Harrissou

Hi Harrissou,

yep, a serious issue. We had a wrong raster -> vector translation in
Processing (that can lead to serious problems), but no chances to find
the string in Transifex.

Cheers

nothing:
- I thought it had to do with temporary layer, hence switched to shp : fail
- swithed field type from integer to double: nothing
- I thought it was because i had not saved the file yet (something that
would be related to auxiliary storage) then I saved the file: niente

I always get that odd message about attribute not set.
I'm on Win 10 using master c94eefb6df. What could trigger that?

OK. Like usual, it's when you send the message that you get the answer by
your own. :)

The problem is an underlying issue where the expresssion "myfield" seems to
not be the same as "myfield" field ie, instead of selecting the field from
the data-defined "Field type" menu, I was mechanically opening the
data-defined "Edit..." expression dialog and selecting the same field. The
field values are applied to rotation but it's not recognized as a field the
tool could update.

Should I report a bug or is it intended/known limitation?

Harrissou

Hi Harrissou, 

I would report it as a bug. I would also expect that an expression with
just the field in it would work.

I think also it should, the expressions are supposed to be tested for this.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changelog for 3.4?

Hi,
thanks for raising this issue Nyall, and many thanks to Tim for polishing
the projecta application.

I agree the changelog is pretty raw, but tho keep optimistic, it looks in a
better shape than 3.0's, where even with the commit message some features
were totally impossible to understand.
Concerning the lack of images, and user oriented comment, I totally agree.
This is a call to feature authors, it's now the moment to explain,
illustrate, cite and advertise the changes you brought. Leaving this on the
shoulders of other contributors is unefficient (and frustrating), just like
pushing a feature without the associated minimal documentation material is.

I would also say that we need to factorize a lot of individual entries. For
instance, all the mesh-layer related features would make a nice "one in
all" entry.

@PSC folks, we could add in the roadmap deadline to trigger call for
changelog and communication, and push systematic calls on our communication
channels. I'd be glad to help here.

I'll spend some time in factorizing the changelog, don't be surprised !

Best regards.

Hi,

we have finished prototyping study to prove that QgsQuick based application
can be run on iOS platform (iPhone, iPad). We managed to run application on
iPad with in-memory vector layer. To have a proper demo, we would need to
be able to compile other providers as static libraries, which can take some
time.

For those brave enough and with a week of spare time, here is the code that
can be used to compile it.

Thanks to https://www.gigaclear.com for funding the effort.

Cheers,

Hello all,

I'm trying to build Qgis in order to test a feature that i have developed,

Hi


Wow! This is awesome stuff…..what is your take on the licensing side of things (in terms of GPL/LGPL code deployed on iOS)? I for one look eagerly forward to being able to make / run QGIS based apps on my iOS devices so thanks so much for your work here!


Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Changing mAction.svg
Message-ID: <6238cae7064aeb4cbe766ac87e58f12f@carto.net>

Hi, 

I'd like to change the color in the "mAction.svg" icon from blue to
yellow (or some other color, if you have a better idea). Would people be
ok with this change? 

It concerns
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/images/themes/default/mAction.svg


Reason: better distinguish this icon from the icon
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/images/themes/default/mActionIdentify.svg
 

People are frequently mixing up these two blue arrows. 

Thank you for your feedback, 

Andreas

Hi,

I am not a lawyer, but I think it we cannot distribute GPL licensed
software through App Store (e.g.
https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement)
But
we can still look back at floppy disks distributions :)

Hi, 

To add a bit more information (concretise) the situation: 

this mainly concerns actions that do not have a different icon
associated, and therefore still display the standard blue cogwheel with
the arrow. 

The question remains open if the icon should stay blue (if inactive) and
switch to yellow if active and no other icon is associated with this
icon. 

I know that yellow is associated with selections, but isn't an action
also kind of a selection (single klick) with an immediate action after
the selection?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Unable to export map with PyQGIS 3
Message-ID: <CAH4UFc_a2xH4z6mkHaYWgmLqVnC2isGX3iyYYbsnnDkx051LGw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to learn and work with PyQGIS 3.

It is a very challenging task cause documentation is really [limited and
out of date][1].

What I am trying to do is to:

 1. create a project
 2. add a layer
 3. save the project
 4. export it as a png

I have done the first 3 steps (see code below).

    import sys
    import qgis
    from qgis.core import QgsVectorLayer
    from qgis.core import QgsApplication
    from qgis.core import QgsProject
    from qgis.core import QgsMapRendererJob, QgsMapSettings
    from qgis.gui import QgsMapCanvas
    from PyQt5.QtGui import QImage, QColor, QPainter
    from PyQt5.QtCore import QSize

    # PYTHON APPLICATIONS

    # prefix path: the location where qgis is installed in the system
    # the easiest way to find the prefix path to run the following commaand
from the python console of qgis: QgsApplication.prefixPath()

    #1. CREATE THE APPLICATION
    QgsApplication.setPrefixPath('/usr', True)
    # second parameter into false disables the gui
    qgs = QgsApplication([], False)
    #load providers
    qgs.initQgis()

    #2. CREATE THE PROJECT
    # create project
    project_name = '/home/dkar/workspaces/qgis/data/test_project_2.qgz'
    project = QgsProject.instance()
    new_project = project.write(project_name)

    #3. READ/OPEN THE PROJECT
    # modify the project e.g. adding more layers and save it.
    new_project = project.read(project.fileName())


    #4. ADD A VECTORLAYER
    # add a layer in the QgsProviderRegistry
    layer=QgsVectorLayer("/home/dkar/workspaces/qgis/data/pakistan_1.shp",
"pakistan", "ogr")

    if not layer.isValid():
        print("Layer failed")

    #5. ADD LAYER TO THE REGISTRY
    project.addMapLayer(layer, True)
    project.write('/home/dkar/workspaces/qgis/data/test_project_2.qgz')

    #6. SAVE THE PROJECT
    all_layers = QgsProject.instance().mapLayers()


    img = QImage(QSize (800, 600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)
    # set image's backgroud color
    color = QColor(255, 255, 255)
    img.fill(color.rgb())

    #create painter
    p = QPainter()
    p.begin(img)
    p.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)

    # THIS IS WHERE THE ISSUE APPEARS
    # THIS IS WHERE THE ISSUE APPEARS
    render = QgsMapRendererJob() # THIS IS WHERE THE ISSUE APPEARS

    # set layer set (am I using here the prohect?)
    lst = [layer.id()] # cause "layer" is the name of the variable
    render.setLayerSet(lst)

    # to remove the provider and layer registries from memory
    qgs.exitQgis()



But when I try to do the last part, following the instructions from the
existing documentation. I get issues because the specific function
(`QgsMapRenderer`) doesn't exist anymore in QGIS 3.

I am not sure how to solve the issue.

I see in the documentation that this function:

    QgsMapRenderer

was replaced by

    QgsMapRendererJob

But then when I try to import and use it in the code as:

    from qgis.core import QgsMapRendererJob, QgsMapSettings
        render = QgsMapRendererJob()

I get an error message:

    TypeError: qgis._core.QgsMapRendererJob represents a C++ abstract class
and cannot be instantiated

Any idea how to proceed with this?

I checked in the site that you should be able to delete your own entries, however you would not be able to delete entries that was made by other users (although the button is there.... @Tim Sutton <mailto:tim at kartoza.com> should I remove the button for those who don't have access to delete the entries?)


I think it makes sense for only the author of the entry and changelog managers to be able to delete it….

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Master fails to compile on Ubuntu 16.04
Message-ID: <CABgOYCfpM-TG9HkyLvXprPOyyrTXdY6Jarj=fkMJhdx6gT_7sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, since this morning, compiling master fails on
src/core/qgsrenderchecker.cpp:197:10: error: ‘class QImage’ has no member
named ‘devicePixelRatioF’

I guess this was introduced by
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/49e8e860293452c5869e01f37c70e1fb3778b660#diff-88ed6cc2d6bc7815dd8b78700d8ecf3a
12 hours ago.

This seems to raise minimum requirement to QT 5.6 when Ubuntu 16.04 only has
5.5.1

Is this something we can mitigate or is that a sudden death for ubuntu
16.04 support?

Regards,
Régis

Hi Dimitris,

It is indeed hard to learn pyqgis 3 with outdated docs.

The following code worked for me (suggested by Martin Dobias):

settings = QgsMapSettings()
settings.setOutputSize(QSize(512,512))
settings.setExtent(layer.extent())
settings.setLayers([layer])

job = QgsMapRendererSequentialJob(settings)
job.start()
job.waitForFinished()
img = job.renderedImage()
img.save("/tmp/rendered.png")

When you call job.start(), it will start rendering in background and
immediately return. That's why you need to call job.waitForFinished()
to block your code until the final image is ready. This approach has a
downside that it blocks the main thread and therefore the GUI will be
blocked until rendering has finished. If you would like to avoid this
blocking, after job.start() you could have a slot that would listen to
finished() signal coming from "job" - and save the image there. This
approach makes the code a bit more complex, but the GUI does not get
blocked and you can even start multiple jobs at a time in parallel.

Hope it helps you. Good luck learning pyqgis!

Raymond

Hey Raymond,

Thank you very much for your answer. It worked. Are you aware of any
resources, online trainings, books or anything else which focuses on the
pyqgis3? What would be your recommendation on this.

Cheers
Dimitris

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Zoom to selected point (if only one point is
	selected)
Message-ID: <d25effcf0286b52adb265eecd9fe5524@carto.net>

Hi, 

Given a layer with POINT geometries, if only one point is selected, QGIS
doesn't zoom to this point, but only pans to the point so that the point
is in the center of the map canvas. 

Now, I know that a single point does not have a dimension - but I still
think that the current behavious is not user friendly. 

As an example: if your zoom level is at the whole dataset (many
kilometers wide), and QGIS only pans to that single point, it is almost
impossible to find that point. 

How can we solve this issue? Here are my ideas: 

a) QGIS points to a fraction (say 1%) of the overall width of all layers
in the project and uses that 1% width and pans to the point 

b) The user can define a map scale that QGIS should use when zooming to
that single point 

c) a combination of a) and b): if b) is set in the project, use the
setting, if not set, use the mechanism of a) 

What are you thoughts? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Um, apparently added after the other devicePixelRatioF had already been fixed.
Fixed in 1113e5b.

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqQmx1BbkvLpyzxs131amx73NCo0_uyrycY8jShpEpFew@mail.gmail.com>

Is there around a piece of code to convert Mapserver mapfile to QGIS
project to start with migration to QGIS server?

I only found:
https://github.com/sourcepole/qgis-mapfile-tools/tree/master/mapfile_tools
which only reads list of layers and then calls Mapserver mapscript to
render the layer as plugin layer (if I got it).

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-gt-Mapserver-export-td5046115.html
talking about 'greatly enhanced mapfile tools' but
https://github.com/Oslandia/qgis-mapfile-tools
does not exist anymore.

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/191729/tools-to-help-migration-from-mapserver-to-qgis-server
asking the same thing, pointed to go via (nonoptimal) SLD.

There is the cookbook, but it is quite outdated since qgis3:

https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html


There is the python api docummentation, I think you already found it:

https://qgis.org/pyqgis/master/index.html


There are many unit tests in python that can act like examples:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/tests/src/python


Then there are many python plugins you can use as examples. Just find 
one that does something you need and look into the code.

On GitLab.com there are at least these ones using CI/CD pipelines :
https://gitlab.com/mst-gko/qupiter
https://gitlab.com/mst-gko/grukos
https://gitlab.com/iac/occfinder/pipelines

FYI, MST-GKO is the Danish Environmental Protection Agency for
Groundwater Mapping.

Hi Bernhard, 

Right - i was pretty sure that others had the issue - long time ago - I
remember i also ran into it before.

Hi Radim, Nothing ready to use, sometime we use some py scripts to extract something QGIS<->MAP, but usually for usage once. We are looking on the same direction and started some brainstorming how to and where we see risks. Convert layers, connection parameters and filters is the easy part. Line and polygon styles at first we see as: a) suboptimal way mapscript -> SLD (good part that contains classes and filter rules) while there is simple styles without complex symbol usage should work fine. b) parse CLASS and translate expressions to QGIS, parse STYLE and translate to QGIS style (initially more work than in mapscript case but in long term can be better). So far no research and idea how to deal with MapServer symbols and symbols based on TTF fonts (we have special symbols developed in TTF). Cool wold be tool able to build QGIS Resource sharing package [1] from map file and linked symbols and fonts for usage in QGIS.   1. http://www.akbargumbira.com/qgis_resources_sharing/ Best, -- Pēteris Brūns SunGIS +371 26336691 pb at sungis.lv ---- On Wed, 24 Oct 2018 11:42:33 +0300 Radim Blazek <radim.blazek at gmail.com> wrote ---- Is there around a piece of code to convert Mapserver mapfile to QGIS project to start with migration to QGIS server? I only found: https://github.com/sourcepole/qgis-mapfile-tools/tree/master/mapfile_tools which only reads list of layers and then calls Mapserver mapscript to render the layer as plugin layer (if I got it). http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-gt-Mapserver-export-td5046115.html talking about 'greatly enhanced mapfile tools' but https://github.com/Oslandia/qgis-mapfile-tools does not exist anymore. https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/191729/tools-to-help-migration-from-mapserver-to-qgis-server asking the same thing, pointed to go via (nonoptimal) SLD.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Python support still broken
Message-ID: <6167692.7rCgyn65Jd@debian>

Hi,

I can't run Python after recent changes with sip:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "/home/borys/sources/qgis/build/output/python/qgis/core/__init__.py", 
line 27, in 
    from qgis._core import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.sip'

For sure python/PyQt/PyQt5/sip.py is executed, the exception there is handled 
properly and the error occurs later. Honestly I'm a bit lost in the paths ;)

Debian Buster
sip 4.19.13
python-pyqt5 5.11.3

and Borys

Sorry, I didn't notice the version of SIP, maybe you want to check this
too:

Thanks. I started from setting the SIP_IMPORT, although it doesn't help so 
far. I'm trying to avoid clearing the whole ccache, but maybe that's the 
reason.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS crashing on closing
Message-ID: <7b3b76e4-b3a1-d491-e221-fed6c1b662c6@carto.net>

Hi,

I am experiencing crashes when closing QGIS with the most recent master:

When I open QGIS (no plugins enabled, completely empty and new profile), 
and I do nothing (not even a simple project opened).

I close QGIS and it crashes on closing.

Am I the only one experiencing such crashes on closing?

System: Linux Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

QGIS: most recent master, self-compiled.

Maybe an issue only on my machine?

-------------------

Here is what I get in the console:

Hi,

I guess that in terms of end user experience, the definition of a setting
would perform the best.
But
- it's one more setting
- the chance that it is not set or correctly set is big

Maybe, the approach would be to fetch the canvas content and determines
that ones needs to zoom out so that the symbol is not overlapping others or
that there is sufficient screen width from its neighbours?

many thanks in advance !

Andreas,

> Maybe an issue only on my machine?

Hum, that somehow rings a bell of something I've seen with past versions. I 
can't reproduce here on my system (16.04) with master, but can you run

valgrind /path/to/your/qgis

and see what it outputs at QGIS closing (but this might hide the issue as 
well)

("sudo apt install valgrind" if needed)

Looking at your stack trace, it seems to be an issue when the 
"static QHash< QString, EllipsoidParameters > sEllipsoidCache" or
"static QList< QgsEllipsoidUtils::EllipsoidDefinition > sDefinitionCache"
objects in qgsellipsoidutils are automatically destroyed by the operating 
system. Looks like some objects have already been destroyed before.

do you think 2 weeks before release would be a good moment to aim at to
have the changelog ready? or do you mean after the release and just
communicate later? (I don't think it is a good idea since all the bells
will be ringing at release date)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Rule-based renderer: show symbol in the legend but
	don't use it for rendering
Message-ID: <CALuHMPB1mxE_RSBXkKnBr0TqY15RoaaDjB=ZaUujEnAWRTrm0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In a tree-like set of rules for rule-based renderer child rule is a combination
of its own symbol and rules with the parent symbols and rules. For example.
in the tree like this

root_1
 - child_a
    - child_a1
    - child_a2
 - child_b
   - child_b1
root_2
 - child_c
    - child_c1
 - child_d

child_a1 will be produced using rules from root_1, child_a and
child_a1. Same with symbols: they all will be rendered one by one.

I'm wondering is it possible in rule-based renderer to have a rule
active but with symbol excluded from the rendering process?

I know that it is possible to disable symbol for rule, but in this
case also nothing will be displayed in the legend and this is not
desirable in my case. I want to have symbol in the legend, but don't
want it to influence child rules/symbols.
This can be useful in geology, military and probably other cases where
"color-shape" legends are quite common, e.g. first feature clasees
defined by color
and then subclasses by different shape of the same color. Having color in the
legend makes it nuch easier to distinguis different clasess without expanding
child nodes in the legend.

If current implementation does not allow this does it make sense to
propose a patch for this, will it be accepted?

Hi Even,

Thank you for your reply.

I created an issue and uploaded the valgrind output. I hope it contains 
some useful information?

See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20211

Thanks,

Andreas

Hi all,

Issue was caused by old library versions. After removing the old stuff 
and reinstalling, the crash was gone.

Thanks Evan!

Hi Tim the issue is in distributing on app store,  if you are deploying
via other channels there is no issues IIRC. But I'm also interested in
case you guys at Lutra had a look at the problem.

Peter Great to hear, thanks for it! I'm sure we'll eventually want to
try this out ;)

Cheers

Marco

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Min qt version for 3.6?

Hi Nyall (Ubuntu user here),

regarding ubuntu 16, I think it's negligible, it is not the latest LTS
anymore it is scheduled for EOL in april 2021 and QGIS 3.4 is planned to
be in LTR until February 2020. so if somebody wants/has to to stick with
a 5yo OS, I guess it should be ok in staying one year more with QGIS 3.4.

moving to Qt > 5.7 will also bean loosing support for Debian Stretch,
which I also think is negligible since it includes 2.18 by default and
Debian 10 should come out around mid 2019 [1] meaning by when the next
QGIS LTR (3.10?) is out  Debian 10 will be the current stable. I hope
this all makes sense.

I cant comment for other distro but IIRC Fedora 27 already has QT 5.9.6

To me would be a +1 but probably, would be nice to get Jef opinion?

Cheers

Marco

Hi Martin, I guess I'm misunderstanding you, but can't you just set the
.gsb files in the CRS datum transformations option panel?

I saw the German grid in the list of non-free grids. I already contacted 
the responsible administration in 2015 and they told me that the 
http://crs.bkg.bund.de/crseu/crs/descrtrans/BeTA/BETA2007.gsb is 
definately free to be distributed with any kind of software.

Indeed, BETA2007.gsb has been incorporated into the
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.8.zip package a few months 
ago. 

It looks like the docs need updates.Thanks for pointing that. I've filed
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/1159 about that.

We (MPA Solutions, www.mpasolutions.it) wrote a Django provider for
QGIS (read only, no editing for now)
https://github.com/MPASolutions/django-provider. It is proof of
concept but it works.

It contains a small test Django project with simple wms Django view
based on QgsServer, so it should be easy for you to test it. The
vector provider in Python requires QGIS master(?), I think.

Any contribution is welcome, especially the write access (i.e.
AddFeatures, DeleteFeatures, ChangeGeometries, ChangeAttributeValues),
which would enable the editing chain QGIS Desktop <-> WFS-T <-> QGIS
Server <-> Django provider <-> Django (<-> PostGIS).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Script vs plugin conundrum
Message-ID: <CAH5HFG=LgZd4WRTNrBGG1XYsSxUkTLTdpoK5eU9zyO-auUm48g@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings!

I can use the QGIS 3 vector dissolve function in the script console like
this:

import processing
processing.run('qgis:dissolve', {'INPUT' : 'c:/temp/input.shp', 'OUTPUT' :
'c:/temp/dissolved.shp'})

But I don't understand how to replicate this from within a version 3
plugin. My basic problem is that I can't locate the 'processing' object -
what do I import? Or do I have to go about this in a completely different
way from within a plugin?

Rich

If we narrow down the environment to uWSGI (with multiple threads
enabled) running a Python application, which means that more instances
of the same application may run in threads but never at the same time
due to Python GIL (if I understand it well), is it still a problem? If
we ensure that there are no static variables and singletons used by
QGIS server? Is it then a problem to create/delete QObject on a non
main thread?

I would go for multiprocess and stick to a single thread per-process.

But David may have a better advice.

Btw, it's nice to see a use case for Python Vector data providers :)

Hi,

Looks like these issues have been fixed. (Correct) Translations are back.
Thanks to whoever dit it.

Python GIL  doess't guarantee thread safety, and it only applies to python
code. It only protects the internal state of the interpreter.
Moreover The C API offers the opportunity to release the GIL (see for
example numpy [1]).

OK, single thread only for now.

Just as a theoretical question: Why, if there are no static variables
and everything (except layer rendering, which works in threads
already) will happen on the same thread?

Hello All,

My name is Robert Moskovitz and I work for the California Geological Survey's Seismic Hazards Program<http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/shp>.  We have been using QGIS for a while because it is a cross platform GIS and it works with our old systems and data.  We also like it because it is so versatile (we can make our own plugins, customizable forms, many different ways to import and export data, solve many problems that would make ArcGIS crawl, etc.).  Unfortunately, QGIS has a weakness that is preventing it from taking off here at CGS... QGIS Relations does not work with composite keys<https://issues.qgis.org/issues/9531>.  So, I was wondering if there are any QGIS developer based in the USA  (preferably a core developer) who can solve this problem for us?

Thank you,

Robert Moskovitz

Hi Radim and friends

What you have built sounds really cool! Is my understanding correct that with eventual read/write support the idea is that a user connecting via QGIS PostGIS connection would have equivalent permissions to a user created in Django auth, so could for example directly edit a feature in QGIS via PG connection, in QGIS via WFS-T connection or edit a feature in Django via e.g. OpenLayers WFS-T connect to QGIS or in Django via django forms?

If that is the goal that sounds really great! Or do some of the above use cases not apply?

Regards

Tim

It's the redundant duplicate entries:

For reference -- we do this also since QGIS 3.0. Every call to a QGIS
(c++) API releases the GIL and reacquires after the call. This means
it's possible to do multithreaded processes in PyQGIS using expensive
QGIS api calls, e.g. you could do a bunch of geometry intersections on
different threads without the GIL blocking other threads.

Not exactly, the idea is to substitute direct PostGIS editing via
Postgres provider for WFS-T/Django to get rid of users/permissions
maintenance on Postgres level. Django will be the only access gateway
where permissions are checked and data are filtered. Syncing
users/permissions/filters between Django and PostGIS is a pain which
we want to abandon. Similarly a WMS vector data source can be filtered
on Django level.

Hi Paolo,

After loading  the text as a delimited text layer, If the attributes are
formatted exactly as the destination table, you can GDAL's Import vector
into PostGIS database processing tool, which contains an "append" option.

AFAIK the only (active) core developers based in US are Larry Shaffer (aka
Dakarto) and obviously Gary Sherman... I alway wonder why so few devs are
invoved from American continent.

There's no technical reason you need a US dev, or do you have issues letting
international contracts?

Hi Tim,

There was a section for Map tools. This is a very nice little feature and
will be good to include under Map tools:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7892
And this is how it works:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] MacOS packaging
Message-ID: <CA+T_MsKo5oxPzSOH758Lpu4w7Qm3Ej4XbrgwK5rpq0DrHwH=MQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

we have been asked to create standalone QGIS package for MacOS. By
standalone I mean that there will be a single package (.pkg) file that will
be extracted to /Application folder and will contain all dependencies
(GDAL, Python3, PyQT, Qt libraries, ...) and will be working without any
additional installation steps (similar to any application you install via
App Store).

As there is no such open-sourced solution I could use or enhance, I started
some prototyping here: https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager
. I hope I can wrap the last bits next week and be able to produce QGIS 3.4
release and QGIS master nightlies on some Mac Cloud server. I used
osgeo4mac homebrew for dependencies, since it looks like it is the most
maintained package manager with osgeo libraries for MacOS. Usage of Conda
packages could be better, but the number of downloads and the activity in
any available repositories is not convincing.

The aim is to eventually have QGIS bundled and shipped similar to Linux and
Windows. Once we finish the work, we will send an email to the PSC and see
if this is something they'd be happy to bring it under their umbrella.

I am open to any suggestions or cooperation for either packaging or
distribution. Feel free to
write me PM or reply here. Thanks

Now its time to celebrate new QGIS release during weekend!

Cheers,
Peter

Note: CMAKE scripts try to achieve similar tasks (qgis/mac/cmake/*.in). But
it seems to me that only bundling of Qt libraries is actively maintained [
QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=1]and bundling of rest of libs (gdal, libzip, geos,
etc.. ) [QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=2 and 3] is not implemented/maintained. Also I
am not convinced that CMake scripting language is best tool for such task.
(due to reconfiguration on change, syntax/readability compared to python,
tools available for path handling, ...)

Hi Peter,

this is great news for Mac users!

I suggest you to get in touch with Larry Shaffer, if I'm not wrong he has
been doing some work on QGIS for conda recently, perhaps you could join
efforts.

Hi Alessandro,

One of the reasons we'd like to get MacOS packaging sorted is to ensure it
is not reliant on a single individual. We have tried and made efforts to
liaise with the rest of devs who have been active on MacOS packaging. But
we'd like to have things in place for 3.4 LTR. Others might have different
priorities.

Regards
Saber

Done.

The geodetic_crs and projected_crs tables have now a 'text_definition' where users can put PROJ strings or WKT strings

Done (for the reading part by PROJ)

There's now a

int PROJ_DLL proj_context_set_database_path(PJ_CONTEXT *ctx,
                                            const char *dbPath,
                                            const char *const *auxDbPaths)

where:
- dbPath is the path to the 'system' proj.db (or NULL to let it find it at its default location)
- auxDbPaths is a list of auxiliary databases. They can potentially
refer to objects of the main database (if you don't need standalone integrity)

Demo:

1) Create an empty DB (custom.db) with the table and view structure of the system DB (proj.db)

echo "SELECT sql || ';' FROM sqlite_master WHERE type IN ('table', 'view');" | sqlite3 data/proj.db | sqlite3 custom.db

2) Fill it with a custom CRS definition expressed as old-school PROJ.4 string

echo "INSERT INTO projected_crs (auth_name, code, name, coordinate_system_auth_name , coordinate_system_code , geodetic_crs_auth_name, geodetic_crs_code, conversion_auth_name, conversion_code, area_of_use_auth_name, area_of_use_code, text_definition , deprecated) VALUES ( 'QGIS', 'MY-CRS-CODE', 'My custom CRS', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,  NULL, NULL, '+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +units=us-ft +towgs84=1,2,3', 0);" | sqlite3 custom.db

3) Query the DB:

$ src/projinfo --main-db-path data/proj.db --aux-db-path custom.db QGIS:MY-CRS-CODE -o PROJ,PROJ4,WKT2_2015

PROJ string: 
+proj=pipeline +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=m +z_in=m +xy_out=us-ft +z_out=us-ft

PROJ.4 string: 
+proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=1,2,3,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft

Pedantic note: the new PROJ string format doesn't capture the towgs84, which is a legacy way of embedding a coordinate transformation. Only the PROJ.4 output does that for the traditionnalists. However internally PROJ has built a BoundCRS object to model the towgs84 transformation that was in the text_definition, so for PROJ.4 output it can recover it, and for coordinate operations, it can use it as well. Not sure I'm very clear here :-), but in short, things should just work.

CMake syntax is not really nice to read (maybe it's personal), but the
point is that all the logic is already written and accessible there, mainly
in terms of dependancy and library location.
I think it makes sense to try to keep the logic in a single place if
reasonably possible.

The QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE is indeed an non completed work from Larry. But as
pointed out, he's also working on something lately.

More generally speaking, and even though nothing is written in QGIS source
code yet, I think that this project is a very good candidate for a QEP.
Do you have any intention to do one?
Is the decision to go for Python and not CMake definitive for your project
or was it more a first quick try?

I hope my message did not sound too pessimistic. Moving towards a solution
to get a complete package for QGIS that is openly maintained in the
community is really great and I'm really glad you started this!

Cheers,
Denis

One of the things that a developer would need to do before we can deal with them is to fill out a "PAYEE DATA RECORD" form (Std. 204) form.  In this form it asks for this:

	Check only one box that corresponds to the payee business type. Corporations must check the box that identifies the type of
	corporation.
	The State of California requires that all parties entering into business transactions that may lead to payment(s) from the state
	provide their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The TIN is required by the R&TC sections 18646 and 18661 to facilitate tax
	compliance enforcement activities and the preparation of Form 1099 and other information returns as required by the IRC section
	6109(a) and R&TC section 18662 and its regulations.
	Payees must provide one of the following TINs on this form: social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification
	number (ITIN), or federal employer identification number (FEIN). The TIN for sole proprietorships, single member LLC
	(disregarded entities), and individuals is the SSN or ITIN. Only partnerships, estates, trusts, corporations, and LLCs (taxed as
	partnerships or corporations) will enter their FEIN.

So, there should be no problem if you are a developer in the United States or an international open source company that has offices in the United States.

I created the Mac app bundle option.  I never fully extended it to 3rd party libraries because I don't have much interest in hiding the GDAL stuff.  Rather than do something new, I think this should be expanded.

Also, there is the problem of extra GDAL formats.  I include everything non-GPL or commercial that I can in my GDAL Complete, with extra plugins for the GPL and commercial stuff - ECW, MrSID, GRASS (not completely sure about that one, GPL-wise), FileGDB, GeoPDF (Poppler).

In a full bundled QGIS, I don't think bundling ECW or MrSID would work.  So you'd still need a plugin installer (not a QGIS plugin) to add those to QGIS in some sort of global application support location like I do with GDAL now.

More notes -

There may be some terminology confusion here - packaging as I see it is making a distributable installation, either an installer or a simple drag-n-drop, on a disk image or zipped.

The install step of the build process is where the bundling happens.  Since this is part of the make install step, bundling needs to be done with cmake.  It can be customized per build with a user cmake script with the QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE_USER option, that's what I do for bundling GRASS and SAGA and a couple other extra libs.  If cmake is not enough, the user cmake can run some other script (sh or python or whatever) and pass on needed cmake variables to it.

Adding more bundling options would have to be flexible enough to not be stuck on a specific distribution of external stuff (ie I prefer the standard Python distribution, others may want Anaconda or something else).  Note that Python bundling would also have to cover extra modules needed by built-in plugins.

Packaging is not covered in the build process.  It's really a personal preference thing, but I suppose there could be an official script.  My main suggestion here is that it should be a standard Apple installer package, not a 3rd party installer system, and especially not as an executable.  Non-Apple installers may use a proprietary or obscured storage/compression system, and I know what the Apple installer executable is doing.  There are tools to extract files from packages if I want to look at the guts before installing.

Side rant - it's unfortunate that Apple is pushing people into the app store mindset.  That's not a good comparison for QGIS, since the QGIS license doesn't work for the Apple app store, and there are many external compenents of QGIS that are usable on their own and in different combinations that would be harder (and more confusing) if combined into a single app.  Also, comparing different systems is not fair either, Linux and Windows and macOS are very different.  Just because others do it shouldn't be the main reason to do something (does Linux have an "all in one" installer, or does it just seem like it because of the packaging system?).

Also note, a single "pkg" installer can still install components outside the main app, though App Store apps are restricted from this, I think.

One option could be to still have separate external components (GDAL, Python, maybe GRASS), but merge them into one mega-installer.  I think it may be possible with the Apple installer packages but it may need a 3rd-party solution or a script (Applescript or Automator might work, so it's a double-clickable app).

One more note: building for older macOS versions is a bit tricky. I'm doing some hackery to use an older SDK than is available in the Xcode on my system (on my 10.12, Xcode only has the 10.12 SDK, but I'm building for 10.10 using an old Xcode 10.10 SDK).  Building with a stock Xcode has only the latest SDK, so building for an earlier system might be a problem.

It used to be a problem, with different system versions having some different symbol names, but this was because Apple was updating their POSIX support, and I think that's all done.  I've heard that you can build for an earlier target than the SDK version now, but I haven't tried it.  And it still might be tricky if a library forces a SDK version (ie Qt 5.11 adds in a 10.11 SDK deployment target)

So, after all that, my suggestions:

- expand the current cmake bundling options to more external libraries, but leave the big items like Python (complex, many choices) and GRASS (complex, normally it's own app) to packager's user bundle scripts

- work on an actual "packaging" script - purpose is to package QGIS app (with whatever is bundled in the app) into an Apple installer package, this would be an all-in-one if user bundling includes EVERYTHING

- consider a mega-packaging script/app to handle separate external companion installers, in the case where separate external component installations are desired

Yeah I was aware of that from previous chats with you - I was wondering if Peter maybe had a different / new take on the problem….

One (probably unpopular and definitely tedious if not impossible) option might be for us to add an exception to the GPL license used for QGIS allowing its distriibuton via app stores, get every committer who has code in the current codebase to agree to the exception and build iOS packages off that. Though that would still leave a large issue of the dependent libraries that we use that are under GPL where the latter approach is even less feasible. So while I am excited at the idea of running QGIS on my iPad / iPhone I am wondering if this is a dead-end excursion in terms of making QGS generally available on iOS?

BTW I think that in a couple of years macOS and iOS will have fused somewhat and whatever gets built for iOS might be expected to run on macOS too. The recent Mojave release has the first example iOS-on-macOS example apps shipped with it (check out the voice memo app on Mojave for an example).

Regards

Tim

This is opening a complete can of worms... but I've wondered for a
while if we need to set up a contributor agreement which grants
copyright of code to the QGIS organisation, so that we have the
flexibility to relicense QGIS in future if (and ONLY IF!!)
required***. Currently we are stuck with the GPLv2 or later license
forever, but I can definitely see a time when we'd like to drop the
"v2" and move to a pure "v3 or greater" license, or even relicense
under something more permissive like the MIT license.

I see this "stuck with the GPLv2 license FOREVER AND EVER" as a
potential risk to the project. There's many other open source licenses
to choose from, including some which MAY be much better to suited for
the project. But I feel confident that with the right approach,
careful wording, and legal fine print we could, at this stage of the

transfer agreement. So I'd like us to at least have a nice discussion
about whether this is a good idea or not.

I noticed after building QGIS 3 with Qt 5.11 (previously was Qt 5.9), the interface appearance changed so that it looks more like Windows or Linux.  Is this some choice in QGIS to use a non-Mac appearance, or some change in Qt?  Is there a Qt switch that can change it back to looking like a Mac app?

Maybe https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8309 ?

Anyway, it's not intentional, unless you're running in dark theme.

Thanks for the links Vincent!

I've had a look at these, but (unless I'm missing something) it seems
like each of these is just using base Python libraries in their tests,
and not testing anything which uses the PyQGIS classes. Getting an
up-to-date QGIS image ready for testing is the tricky bit ;)

Hi William

Can you also check in your settings -> options -> general -> style to be sure that it hasn’t somehow adjusted itself to windows style?

Hi all,

just stepping in into this discussion. While we were (and still are)
updating the pyqgs cookbook, we found that there is a relevant missing
part on how to write test for the plugins in our documentation [0]

I know that for a developer this is not the funniest part, but is
someone is willing to add a part on this it would be really glad to add
this section.

I'm available to help

Cheers and sorry for stepping in into this discussion but I couldn't
resit :)

Matteo

Hi,

My task is to create specific iOS application for a client that depends
only on qgis_core and qgis_quick libraries, moreover distributed strictly
outside App Store. So I assume there is a little problem with licensing
here.

Ad: iOS vs MacOS. This is similar to running full QGIS on android device,
vs running QField (or similar "reduced" application based on QtQuick). One
thing is possibility to run something somewhere, other thing is if it is
usable at all. I can imagine that it may be possible to compile and run
QGIS on a smart fridge, but ... :) If we want to ship something official
for iOS (or Android) on the official store(s), we would probably need to
agree on some  application (&set of its features) based on qgis quick.

Cheers,
Peter

It was sortof that - neither Windows nor Fusion was selected, so I guess it defaulted to Windows.  Selected Fusion and all is well.

I'll put a note in the install readme.

I absolutely agree with you here, this is why I planned QGIS for android
as I did:
- first let’s get it to run on android with the same UI, port all the
base libs and do all the background work and get a decent version
functioning. QGIS for android just had basic optimizations for mobile
devices and touch screens (which btw were implemented so to allow any
touch screen to be used, and not only android) but was very well
received and funny enough we still get requests for updating it.
- Then shift the focus on the UI and UX and replace it completely. And

Where does the need for another official QGIS mobile application come
from? QGIS quick is based on the extracted core modules of QField so
they could be reused for custom applications.
QField has over 100K downloads, is fully open source,has pushed QGIS
forward by pushing things to QGIS core instead of just to the app. And -
foremost - is the origin of QGIS quick and could be ported to iOS with
the same distribution caveats like any other QGIS based app.

I’d really would rather see some more help coming to QField than
investing a lot of time to get to somewhere where QField already is.

Cheers Marco

 Maybe a misunderstanding, I do not suggest to start a new mobile project.
My whole point was that it is not possible to have the same application for
desktop and mobile devices with same set of widgets and features.

Message-ID: <CAC93zU39C0NWfLGa-gr-3j4eNfz2Gmo4H9V7Wk14iT4LEv+3_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need get the signal when have change of layers order of legend.

I tried use the signal of  layerOrderChanged, but, crash QGIS.
Version: 3.4
Code 4a4b62e <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/4a4b62e>
OS: Kubuntu 18.04

I used the Terminal Python:

def changeOrder():
    print('Change order')

root = QgsProject.instance().layerTreeRoot()

root.layerOrderChanged.connect(changeOrder) # Crash for normal layer

root.customLayerOrderChanged.connect(changeOrder) # None crash for normal
layer

It is a Bug ?

What is a custom layer ?

I think this is such a strategic, and potentially divisive, issue that

Hi,

I agree that QEP would be very good thing to do. The python prototype and
this mailing thread are my first steps to fully understand the extent of
the task. Thank you all for the suggestions.

Yes this is a bug.

>

>

It's not the layer that is custom, it's the order. That's the way to have a
layer order that is differement from the one in the legend.
see
https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html#working-with-the-legend-independent-layer-order

For technical details, it seems that the signal is emitted
before QgsLayerTreeModel::removeRows could return true. And a new repaint
of the layer tree is requested (while still in removing rows).

The crash occurs in QgsLayerTreeModel::index2node() at the return line:

QObject *obj = reinterpret_cast<QObject *>( index.internalPointer() );
return qobject_cast<QgsLayerTreeNode *>( obj );

I am not really sure how to fix it here, Martin... can you have a look it?

Denis

I’m also +1 on this approach (ceding copyright to QGIS.org for any incoming commits). Bigger headache is trying to get all legacy code signed over to QGIS.org. I would also prefer to go MIT or some liberal license. We would still have the issue that all the dependencies we use have their own licenses…. Theoretically we could take a snapshot of the current master, and track down only the committers that have touched that code rather than every historical committer which might make the task marginally easier. Anyhow I guess we are firmly in fantasy land here :-)

One thing is possibility to run something somewhere, other thing is if it is usable at all. I can imagine that it may be possible to compile and run QGIS on a smart fridge, but ... :) If we want to ship something official for iOS (or Android) on the official store(s), we would probably need to agree on some  application (&set of its features) based on qgis quick.

I think you understood me incorrectly. Their new frameworks allow running iOS apps on the desktop as native macOS apps, not the other way around. I think this has interesting use cases (I often get asked about making slimmed down versions of QGIS for people for example)….

Ideally I'd agree with the sentiment here, but a large number of our
developers can't attend these hackfests. (And as witnessed by the bug
tracker discussion this leads to lack of ownership of a decision by
those not in attendance).

Maybe something like this would be a possible approach:

1. PSC discuss whether this is something they want to pursue as an
organisation or not. If not, end of discussion.
2. Create a QEP page for central discussion on the point. Advertisie
initially on mailing lists.
3. When enough discussion (and hopefully, consensus) has been reached
on a possible approach, send a link to the QEP discussion to all known
contributors for wider feedback. If no consensus, end of discussion.
4. If there is general approval amongst contributors  AND is appears
to be possible to advance then PSC/org get legal advise before
proceeding. If not legally possible, end of discussion.
5. Formalise the proposal into some legally binding agreement
6. Get voting members to vote on proposal (maybe 5/6 would be
flipped?). If vote is declined, end of discussion.
7. Get existing contributors to sign the agreement.
(8. Replace existing code from any non-signing contributors)
9. Put process in place for new contributors to agree to agreement
before contributions are allowed.

I realise that this is a long and potentially difficult path, but many
other projects have successfully navigated it. And I think we should
at least explore it, if for no other reason then to know if we never
need to have this discussion again :)

Agreed - QGIS.org needs to decide whether it wants to hold all the copyright for the QGIS code base.

Agreed

Agreed

Maybe this step is better done up front - pointless writing QEP’s etc if we don’t have the legal capacity to be the rights owner. Though I would expect this is a formality and would be very surprised if QGIS.org could not be the rights owner...


> 5. Formalise the proposal into some legally binding agreement

Agreed,

Are they voting that they are OK with QGIS.org holding the rights? I would make it 5/6 of actual votes to prevent voter apathy killing the initiative….


> 7. Get existing contributors to sign the agreement.

As mentioned I would make it 'contributors of what is in a snapshot of the current codebase'. We do this by making a fork with no revision history and leave the existing repo with current GPL license and revision history intact. Then we only contact devs who have code in the fork.

Agreed: We can automate the process by using a tool like: https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant (I think there are a few of them out there)...

I have often thought about this over the years - no particularly for iOS which spawned the discussion, but to remove a huge roadblock for us ever pragmatically tweaking our license.

If the above path fails, I think there are other things we could do, like introducing this non-retrospectively, so that any new code coming in is ceded to QGIS.org ownership and we leave whatever is in the code base as-is. Devs could cede their previous work to QGIS.org on an individual basis if they want to. Over time the bulk of the code may naturally become the copyright of QGIS.org (think version 10 here…)


Thanks for the nice breakdown Nyall…

Hi all,

in the current 3.5 the Help button of Processing algorithm is broken. I
think it is a redirect problem (3.5 in the url should be testing).

I don't have a 3.4 release to check if in the stable release the
redirect is valid.

Thanks

I think before proceeding with this approach we should check with the
main devs if they would possibly agree with a change - if not, the whole
thing has little practical chance of surviving.
All the best.

The NextGIS installer was cited to me by an expert user as the best
installation method of which he was aware (discussion here:
https://twitter.com/richardf/status/969522358640881664). I don't know how
useful that information is.

Thanks

Tom

It might be even worth starting it on parallel (as the above provess might
take a year or more). The contributors curve has more an exponential than
linear shape lately.

Hi, 

Before we go to far with the discussion here, I would first ask all of
the core devs if they really would like to do that. 

Without an agreement in place, the code is owned by each contributor
separately. I know of quite a few core devs who are not keen on ceding
their copyright to QGIS.ORG, if the goal is to undermine the GPL
license. 

I am also not sure if QGIS.ORG is ready to prepare such an ownership
agreement. 

Personally, I fail to understand what the benefits are, if we go this
route. On the contrary - I think we are risking to loose many core
contributors if we do that. 

Greetings, 

Andreas

Sounds like a good case for running a survey of the developers!

Thanks Nyall for the nice inputs.

I put an agenda item on the next PSC meeting to see what PSC thinks.

IIRC building is no issue and distributing outside of the app store is
no problem. That is why for QField we were exploring different
distributions options.

You could just package QField for desktop - that is how we develop on it
most of the time :)

Bah... feels like every major release someone ends up sending an email
like this... but in this case, https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20262
has totally destroyed QGIS network based providers with Qt 5.11 and
above.

This is not anyone's fault -- it's an upstream change in the Qt
library which changed some behavior we relied on. Not there fault, not
our fault. But end result is that it makes QGIS basically unusable for
any non gdal/ogr layers on Qt >= 5.11. And unfortunately our major
platforms only saw an upgrade to Qt 5.11 late in the bug fixing
period, which made this one slow to be identified.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8383 should fix it.

Soo.... could we break the normal cycle and get a point release out
quickly? (Ideally with a couple of days prenotice so that anyone else
working on urgent bug fixes could get them in too)

That's rather unfortunate, but most probably needed. The issue raised,
20262, affects WMS(T), XYZ, WFS, etc. layers.

On top of - and very much due to - the gravity of the bug itself, 3.4 is
flagged as LTR, and it'd be most appropriate to insure that people jumping
onto this new LTR aren't left with a bad first impression.

Hi,

> Bah... feels like *every* major release someone ends up sending an email
like this...

My opinion this may show a problem with our development cycle setup. In my
previous company, different closed-sourced software, we had so called code
freeze. For example it could be 1-2 weeks before actual release and ideally
some users would have time to test the "release-candidate" of QGIS before
going public.

>From wikipedia:

   - A *(complete) code freeze*, in which no changes whatsoever are
   permitted to a portion or the entirety of the program's source code.
   Particularly in large software systems, any change to the source code may
   have unintended consequences
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_bug>, potentially introducing
   new bugs; thus, a code freeze helps ensure that a portion of the program
   that is known to work correctly will continue to do so. Code freezes are
   often employed in the final stages of development, when a particular
   release or iteration is being tested, but may also be used to prevent
   changes to one portion of a program while another is undergoing development.

Cheers,
Peter

I feel that this is a really serious issue that IMHO can justify a point
release

there are also two major issues with Processing/GRASS (tools not
working when windows regional settings are not set to English and also
not working for any multilayer datasource like gpkg), this is for many
a blocker for the process of adopting QGIS 3 LTR over 2.18.

Thanks Nyall for raising this.
This indeed fells like "deja vu" and we need to advertise users that a
fresh new major release will for sure need point releases. We didn't
probably explain well enough that 3.4 is the LTR candidate, but will
definitly be a LTR in january at the end of life of 2.18 version.

I am a big +1 on a code freeze period. This code freeze period will need to
be associated with a strict definition of "blocker issues" that really need
to by adressed immediatly. This issue here is a great example of a valid
blocker.

I also think we have now a large enough code base and user base to prepare
a slower release cycle with longer feature freeze, bugfix  and code freeze.
We talked about it in Zanzibar, and I think advertising now that by the end
of 2019, ltr should be supported for 2 years, and releases every 6 months
would be nice.

What worries me in current fast cycle is that we have a lot of packaging
burden for all OS, and each release has a human cost. I think it's time we
just slow down just a little, but 6 months would already be something
really fast for such a big software in fact.

Cheers

Régis

big fan of the "no known regressions admitted", at least for LTR releases.

Hi,

as my prototyping goes forward, I managed to create first dmg file for 3.5
master. If you want to try it out, here is the link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/vkl9oe691lkdrqh/qgis_31102018_1.dmg?dl=0
I used Mojave 10.14, homebrew for dependecies, XCode Version 10.1 (10B61).

I would be glad for any feedback, either positive or negative on PM/email
or feel free to report the issues directly on
https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-mac-packager/issues

Thanks,
Peter

The problem here is the "known" part: if we had more testers on the
nightlies during the two weeks before the release date, we would probably
have catched some of these regression in time to fix them.

I think that it would be a good idea to create a group of volunteer
testers, like we have for translators, that can regularly run test cycles
(for example going through the tutorials that we already have).

We might want to introduce the concept of release candidate, in order to
have a stricter code freeze, and give the testers and translators some
amount of time for testing and translations, during this time only "real"
bug fixes should be allowed.

That said, I think that "release early release often" is still the best way
we can handle release cycles.

Agreed, the more testing the better.

I like the concept of a "release candidate".

I think by labeling a package as RC we will encourage people to

 - download and test the application
 - not use them in production
 - be relaxed about issues (because they are expected)
 - as a nice side-effect, it's also a good point in time for rolling the
   drums about an upcoming LTR.

Either we call the LTR x.y.0 version a RC (instead of the first release)
- or the 4 last weeklies before the release are labeled as RC.

But still then there will be issues and most people will only start
testing the final release and we will run into "unknown issues" and
"unreported issues" while working on QGIS and fix and push them without
a big admin overhead. And we just have to accept that this is our life
as software engineers and we all do the best we can :-)

serious manual/semi-automated testing (of most functionalities, on the
3 major platforms, using multiple type/versions of QGIS and endpoints,
etc.) is a full time job, I know because  I was lucky enough to have
done it for a year and half. Without this type of effort we will
always rely on reports sent in by people that find issues here and
there while doing their normal workflow, which is ok but also has a
good chance of not finding a number of serious bugs.

cheers!

I'm also +1 for release early and often in the pace we do now.
I think FOSS depends on users. If you have are a commercial company you
can pay testers (who create test scenario's etc etc).. costing a lot of
money. We have users who test, and yes, they do mostly around (after?)
release... So: release often.

And I DO test (and compile) all the time (almost daily compiles).
Off course more testing would maybe make some(!) issues be fixed before
a release.

And we DO have a 'feature freeze' in which we should ( try to ;-) ) only
fix bugs (as if it was a RC). So adding another RC is only
theoretical/administrive in my view.
We could be more strict though...

Bugs like the one above can always be introduced even when we had a RC.
That is one of the drawbacks of compiling for so many platforms (with so
many versions of needed libs....).

But that is also our strength!

Anyway, before releasing 3.4.1 please can other check/confirm this one:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20295

Giovanni,

I'm not talking about the test cycles a company could run, but if we did a
call for testers and prepared a page with instructions, we may have had a
dedicated group of people (users) who is willing to help the QGIS project
running test cyles, and as I said, going through the current
lessons/tutorial may be sufficient.

So, the plan would be:
1. prepare a page about how to run tests (based on the lessons/tutorials)
2. ask the community via email, twitter, whatever, to join the effort of
running test cycles when the code freezes
3. before any new release GOTO 2

I don't know if that will work, but worth trying.

I am very much aware of the importance of testing in a structured way.
And I am very happy that we have a solid team of regular testers around you.

The limitation is that our current resources don't allow for employing
people to do more than that unless I am mistaken. So we are left with
less resources than a full-time job for that.

As a result of that, my proposal is aimed towards encouraging volunteers
to test as much as possible within the bounds of the available
resources. Tagging something as RC costs close to nothing but I have
hope that it helps to get more testing prior to a release.

If there's someone that comes up with a team of testers that is
available for serious structured testing, I'll be the last one to say no!

Cheers
Matthias

Not very prominent, but that's already there:
"In the feature freeze phase that [the weekly snapshot] also acts as release
candidate."

Sounds like the best option - other options probably end up with the same
result just with more effort ;)

And to me only people that tested the nightly before the release are allowed to
complain about preexisting bugs right after the release.  If you can jump on
the released packages right away, you should have also been able to do so with
a nightly earlier.  But this time they might even have done that and the
problem was introduced by upgrading Qt late.

So where are we with fixing the urgent bugs?   EPR next friday 12:00 UTC?

Next regular PR would be 2018-11-23 12:00:00 UTC

IMHO our release procedure is OK, I agree with Juergen.
IMHO it's just a matter of communication. We should make clear that upon
release there may still be bugs, even serious, so people are  prepared
to deal with it. Google solved a similar issue by calling their programs
"beta" for a long period.

All the best.

Not that much on their own. I agree. But I don't expect them to hurt a
lot either.

We could try to put this on the main screen of qgis.org and do some
twitter / blog announcements when 3.10 LTR weeklies are released and see
if it helps.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Connected problems with QGIS3 crashes and python
	standalone crashes?
Message-ID: <BF73B3C5-34F7-4D81-B170-47FE94FA010F@gmail.com>

Hello,

Now that QGIS3 is well underway I’ve been looking at getting some Python3 code working with QGIS as standalone and plugins apps.  But I have two - possibly related persistent problems with QGIS3 and this list was suggested as a good place to ask advice.

I’m running 3.4 (just upgraded yesterday) on Mac OSX 10.13.6

I can work in QGIS and have been using it for ongoing work - so everything seems good until I get to quitting.  Shortly after I’ve closed QGIS I get crash report (parts included below).  Its a bit unclear exactly what is causing the crash - and its been happening since I went to QGIS3.  I should (admit) that I was also running the beta and building that so there is a possibility that I have some left over side effects of that I have not been able to clean up.  I have taken out everything I can track down on that and some other dev things (not QGIS) I was doing a year or longer ago.

The other crash that may be related and seems to give more info is when I run the basic standalone app example from the PyQGIS book.  The qgs = QgsApplication([], False) crashes with an abort trap 6 and the message: qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "cocoa" in “"

This looks a lot like a missing path problem, but I have been unable to resolve where it is missing.  As far as I can see the qt and cocoa support libraries are in the GIS3 app contents subdirectories, so I’m at a loss as to what is really missing.

Any suggestions for where to go would be appreciated.

Here is a part of the crash report after closing the QGIS app.  QT seems to be involved in this too - although the details are less clear to me.  So I’m hoping that solving one problem will clear both.:

Someone else will need to fix this one, it's not something I can
reproduce. Any volunteers? If there's none, we shouldn't hold back a
release for this.

Fixed in master (and only an issue on debug enabled builds). Will
backport to 3.4.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGISServer: how to find out shared lib path for
	qgis_mapserv.fcgi
Message-ID: <da354148-89c3-97c4-b24d-b5990fe5a4e1@duif.net>


Hi,

Compiling QGIS + server on a custom Debian machine here, install in my
local dir, make the install dir group www-data.

Put qgis_mapserv.fcgi in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

Testing an url I get ing logs:

/usr/lib/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi: error while loading shared
libraries: libqgis_server.so.3.5.0: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory

It IS working if I copy all the .so files to /usr/lib

BUT I thought I could instruct qgis/fcgi to use a custom, by using
something like below in my apache config (was not sure which one to use,
so used both):

FcgidInitialEnv
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/home/richard/bin/qgis/master/debug/lib"
SetEnv
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/home/richard/bin/qgis/master/debug/lib"

This is not working, any fcgi guru has a hint?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Yep. 100% agree -- this is something we always must keep in mind in
these discussions. We'll never achieve a 100% regression free release,
it's just not possible given the complexity of QGIS. And probably has
never been done in the history of software development ever anyway!

In this particular case I don't see how we could have avoided it. It's
a "perfect storm" combination of:
1. Lack of clarity and huge warnings in the Qt docs about how an API
was designed to be used
2. QGIS developers relying on previous behavior of this API
3. Qt developers putting stronger checks preventing use of the API in
the way it wasn't designed, which as a result broke QGIS functionality
4. The bug only being visible in a highly GUI dependent setup -- it
relies on a very recent Qt version and QGIS network based request with
HTTPS in a background thread. Possibly we could/should have unit tests
for this, but it's a very difficult situation to test for and predict
in advance.
5. A QGIS release falling right at a time when a number of
platform/library upgrades occurred, which upgraded Qt to the newer
version, which meant that users had barely any time to test on these
upgraded platforms before final release.

I honestly can't see how any of these factors could have been avoided.
Maybe for 5 we could ensure that our release schedule doesn't coincide
with Ubuntu's, but we can't predict Windows/macOS/Fedora/etc release
schedules, so that would only be a small band aid.

To reproduce this one, I think you can, just changing your windows regional
settings to, for instance, Portuguese (Portugal).

I meant 2018-11-02.  2018-11-09 would of course work as well, if there's more
to fix.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Connected problems with QGIS3 crashes and
 python standalone crashes?
Message-ID: <14D96032-990C-4160-B5B6-1143E26E1FD6@gmail.com>

Nothing like posting a question to trigger stumbling across the solution.  It appears that a solution was found back in the Summer in this thread: 
https://www.mail-archive.com/qgis-user at lists.osgeo.org/msg40317.html

I tried adding this and both of the problems seem to have gone - although I still did get an exception when I exited the bare bones standalone python code.

export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH="/Applications/QGIS3.app/Contents/Plugins"

John




Hello,

Now that QGIS3 is well underway I’ve been looking at getting some Python3 code working with QGIS as standalone and plugins apps.  But I have two - possibly related persistent problems with QGIS3 and this list was suggested as a good place to ask advice.

I’m running 3.4 (just upgraded yesterday) on Mac OSX 10.13.6

I can work in QGIS and have been using it for ongoing work - so everything seems good until I get to quitting.  Shortly after I’ve closed QGIS I get crash report (parts included below).  Its a bit unclear exactly what is causing the crash - and its been happening since I went to QGIS3.  I should (admit) that I was also running the beta and building that so there is a possibility that I have some left over side effects of that I have not been able to clean up.  I have taken out everything I can track down on that and some other dev things (not QGIS) I was doing a year or longer ago.

The other crash that may be related and seems to give more info is when I run the basic standalone app example from the PyQGIS book.  The : = QgsApplication([], False) crashes with an abort trap 6 and the message: qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "cocoa" in “"

This looks a lot like a missing path problem, but I have been unable to resolve where it is missing.  As far as I can see the qt and cocoa support libraries are in the GIS3 app contents subdirectories, so I’m at a loss as to what is really missing.

Any suggestions for where to go would be appreciated.

Here is a part of the crash report after closing the QGIS app.  QT seems to be involved in this too - although the details are less clear to me.  So I’m hoping that solving one problem will clear both.:
